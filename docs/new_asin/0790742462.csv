116351,4,0790742462,"A different take on a long time classic. My only complaint is that it was too short. It was no where near as great as the Donald Sutherland classic, but it was far superior to that Nicole Kidman remake Invasion. Man, that was absolute CRAP! Body Snatchers, here is a little bit better than in the middle of the two. Able Ferrera did a pretty good job. Forest Whitaker was his usual awesome self and R. Lee Ermy... Well... He's R. Lee Ermy. You know what to expect. He's great in everything. And Gabrielle Anwar. A YOUNG Gabrielle Anwar at that. To quote Campbell's Soup here... ""mmm mmm good."" I give this one only 4 stars because Donald Sutherland's was flawless and the best of the remakes. Only his get 5 stars. But this is still pretty good.",1485129600,,745,4.405797101449275

While it isn't bad per se, it isn't that good either.  It does have a few memorable moments.  Such moments include Meg Tilly's character's chilling  speech about where her family is going to go & Forrest Whittiker's frantic realization of what's happening.

116375,2,0790742462,"Body Snatchers is the third screen adaptation of Jack Finneys science fiction novel about aliens that take over the minds and souls of their human hosts. The first version, Don Siegels 1956 Invasion of the Body Snatchers, has become a classic and Philip Kaufmnas 1978 remake is an eerie exercise in suspense and escalating terror. This time around, the story is set at a military base, an interesting location because of the conformity and regimentation of the armed services. It makes it easier for extraterrestrials to assume identities without much notice. Made in 1994, the film features a few actors destined for stardom  Meg Tilly and Gabrielle Anwar  and future Oscar winner Forest Whitaker. R. Lee Ermey (Full Metal Jacket) plays the base commander.

The concept for alien invasion is actually quite sensible. Take over the bodies of human beings who, though now aliens, still go about their daily life as more and more aliens inhabit human shells. No guns. No prolonged attack. No loss of life. The plan is brilliantly insidious. The notion of your mother, husband, child, teacher, commanding officer, gas station attendant, etc., suddenly being the same yet different is truly unsettling. The army base adds to the tension through the horror of claustrophobia. Theres not many places to hide or escape to, so those at the base are easy prey to being taken over.

Director Abel Ferrara keeps us guessing as to who will fall victim next. Overall, however, this version is the weakest of the three, never achieving the gut-wrenching thrills of the first two. In attempting to milk the best of those films while making this version distinctive, Ferrara has created a routine low-budget horror flick without the sheer terror of the original or the escalating paranoia of Kaufmans film.

with a screen play written by Stuart Gordon & Directed by Abel Ferrara
it's definitely a different version to the previous Invasion of body snatchers versions that's for sure
the run time is about 80mins so the plot story is short & sweet but Great acting performances nethertheless
and warners have given the film a new 2:35:1 1080p HD transfer & new 5.1 master mix
which does look slightly sharper & clearer quality than the old DVD version about 7-8/10
but tragically that's all your going to get
there are no new extras that's for sure, no new interview with Abel Ferrara or Stuart Gordon
all you get is the original Theatrical trailer just like the old DVD version which had no extras anyway
 so the only difference is the picture quality has been upgraded, pretty pathetic effort by warners i must say
amazon are selling it for $17 a big ripoff, this reissue is worth $10 or less
pretty tragic i thought this film deserves a new interview with Abel Ferrara & stuart Gordon, but tragically not

A man (Terry Kinney as Steve Malone) moves his family to a military base that has already been invaded by pod people.  Since it's the military, very little in the way of individuality is shown from the start (they've already conformed to a single model as soldiers).  Figuring out who is and who isn't real is a chore.  Forest Whitaker is decidedly too real while Billy Wirth (as Tim) is purposely vague and blank throughout.  At least this version better explains the need for proximity when the pods merge with their original forms.  What happens to the remaining husk is also handled neatly.  But this version remains a duplicate of a duplicate and therefore suffers the most from overuse.  Aiming it squarely at a teen audience didn't help.  And as with the other versions, the pods exhibit far too much emotion for supposedly unemotional things.  The squeal/battle cry also doesn't help the notion that they above displaying fits of anger.

116438,5,0790742462,"""Body Snatchers"" is the fourth in the quasi-franchise based on Jack Finney's 1955 novel ""The Body Snatchers"" about an alien invasion where people die and their bodies become pod-versions of their former selves. The entries in the series are as follows:

- ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" (1956) - ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" (1978) - ""Body Snatchers"" (1993) - ""The Invasion"" (2007)

The first one is in Black & White and is probably too dated and tame for most modern viewers, but it's still worthwhile; it takes place in small town, California. The 1978 sequel switches the setting to the big city of San Francisco. This 1993 sequel switches to an army base in the deep south. And the 2007 version switches back to the big city of Washington DC. I suppose they could all be viewed as progressive steps in the invasion, particularly the first three; I say this because the 2007 entry changes some aspects and might be better viewed as a variation on the story rather than a sequel.

I think this 1993 entry is the best, followed by the original, and then the 1978 and 2007 installments. What I like about ""Body Snatchers"" is the cast and the setting. The Army base naturally makes it easier for the alien imitations to go undetected as they spread through the community.

Although she was 22 during filming, Gabrielle Anwar plays the 17 year-old protagonist, the daughter of an EPA inspector (Terry Kinney) who's assigned to inspect an Army base in the deep south (shot in Selma, Alabama). Meg Tilly plays his young wife while Christine Elise plays Anwar's friend on the base, the daughter of the commanding general, and Billy Wirth co-stars as Anwar's chopper-pilot beau (Wirth, by the way, looks like an early 90s version of Robert Pattinson from the Twilight films). Forest Whitaker is also on hand as a military psychologist at the base.

Although ""Body Snatchers"" is a horror film it's a creepy/mysterious type of horror film and not a slasher/gore film. The gore you see is pretty much limited to the pod-people and is therefore more like vegetable-gore, lol. Anyway, the film has a nice haunting ambiance and everything works together for a standout film of this genre. The acting is superb and the swamplands of the deep south are utilized.

Gabrielle has a beautiful face, but she's too skinny for my tastes, Elise too. As such, the female eye candy is limited to curvy Meg Tilly and her body-double Jennifer Tilly. Don't expect much on this front.

Despite my fairly high opinion of ""Body Snatchers,"" it bombed at the box office and so did the 2007 entry. It goes without saying, we probably won't see another stab at this story for some time.

The film runs a short but sweet 87 minutes.

116441,3,0790742462,"Interesting remake. The simplicity of the scenario is a bit disconcerting at first sight. The end of the film seems also to be deliberately absurd and grotesque, like a letting go of the fantasy of the girl gone with her "" prince charming "" in helicopter .

Murder of the father as in Badlands. Some will see there a paradox but the viewer accord surprisingly less confidence to this character from the moment he wants nothing but to save his children . A small family very nice at the beginning of the film that does not sink into the ostentatious caricature like the family of Little Miss Sunshine.

Ferrara proposes here a rich though very refined reflection on human nature. Just like in the Don Siegel's movie , he who passes for a psychotic in the beginning of the film is actually one of the last representatives of a creative humanity with feelings.

116479,4,0790742462,"Abel Ferrara with a budget. That's almost science fiction in itself, but here you have it. Warner gives him some money and he makes a commendable, if not great, entry into this story. Aided with a script penned by Larry Cohen, Raymond Cistheri, et. al. this is a bit of a mixed bag.

Here's the scoop. Dad, who works for the E.P.A. takes his newer wife, daughter and son around to various military bases to test whatever chemicals they might be storing for risk assessment. Something's going on on the base and some of the recruits are getting to feel their fellow recruits aren't who they were. As in the original story, an alien race is replacing people with pod people. Who will escape, if anyone, and what will happen if they do?

This version reaches out in several directions and that might be the problem. Here the threat of total conformity is represented by the military mind set. A bunch of guys doing the same stuff at the same time. They also seem to touch on the ""military industrial complex"" conspiracy thing as these pods are being distributed throughout the country by the military, but this is rather weak and doesn't put any real cautionary scare into the viewer. The paranoia card is played but it comes well into the movie so it has some impact but not as much as in the original. This also has a high degree of art in it which one doesn't find in many sci-fi movies. I think it makes this film more classy but less horrifying. There are some genuinely creepy moments though, such as when they are pulling the pods out of the local swamp, so this isn't just a head trip. It just needed a few more scares and a bit more focus.

The acting (with some exceptions) and other production values are very good. Ferrara is a good director and he seems to be trying hard here. It's a shame Warner paid little attention to this DVD. It looks pretty much like a straight film to digital transfer so you don't get the benefits of the new technology in either sight or sound but it's watchable. It wasn't a big money maker upon its original release so I suppose you have to expect it.

For my money the original is still the best but this might rank second. At a trim 87 minutes this is well worth the time to view for any fan of the genre.",1310083200,,2247,4.368421052631579
116480,4,0790742462,"""Body Snatchers"" (1993) is directed by Abel Ferrara (King of New York, Bad Lieutenant, The Funeral). This film focuses on a young girl, Marti (Gabrielle Anwar from Burn Notice), and her family. Her father (Terry Kinney) is sent to a military base to do some scientific studies on possible contamination, and in the process discovers an encroaching evil as people are apparently becoming paranoid and delusional. This film is inspired by the 1956 film ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"", but it takes a new plot line situated as it is in a military base. This is an eerie and engrossing film that keeps one gripping the edge of their seat as things go from bad to worse for Marti and her family. Meg Tiller portrays Marti's mother, and Forest Whitaker appears in the role of Major Collins.

The dvd has no extras, but the quality of the dvd is quite good with rich colors and deep blacks, with only a few instances of dust noticeable at times.",1309046400,,940,4.62874251497006

An exciting and quick-moving second remake of Invasion of the Body Snatchers, Abel Ferrera's version cleverly takes on military conformity by setting the story at an army base; the finale leaves a little bit to be desired but this is still a fine horror film that doesn't disrespect the original.",1241481600,,314,4.9245283018867925
116483,3,0790742462,"Do those sound like the sentiments of independent film and cult icon Abel Ferrara? Hell no! Abel does things his way or he doesn't do them at all. It's that stubbornness and refusal to bend to the whims of others that has made Ferrara one of the best and - sadly - underappreciated directors of the past 45 years. And even though he was celebrated in the early 90s for his twin masterpieces 'King Of New York' and 'Bad Lieutenant', he's struggled to find financing and/or distribution for the last decade and a half. Thankfully, Abel's undergoing a much deserved reevaluation thanks to films like 'Ms. 45' and 'Welcome To New York' which,  despite not being officially screened, was the talk of this year's Cannes Film Festival. I took this occasion to revisit Abel's only studio effort 1993's 'Body Snatchers'.

Life is hell for teen beauty Marti (Gabrielle Anwar). Her mom's dead, she hates her stepmom (Meg Tilly) almost as much as she hates her dad (Terry Kinney) for marrying her and she hates the fact that she's been uprooted, along with her annoying stepbrother , to a military base so that her E.P.A. pop can investigate toxic chemical spills that caused a bunch of soldiers with guns to go a little crazy in the head. No matter where she goes, Marti can't shake the feeling she's being watched. The general (R. Lee Ermey) rules by intimidation and can't stand insubordination. He has his men spy on one another and report back to him with any instances of people thinking for themselves so he can administer a swift response. Even as more and more people start vanishing around her, Marti finds solace with an army brat and a hunky pilot. It doesn't take long (actually it does) however for the paranoia and unease to invade her already fragile home life and really cause things to go to hell. Marti finds herself in constant peril not only from the crazy soldiers but from her crazy family members as well.  Joined by a small group of like-minded confidantes, she desperately tries to escape the base and comes to find out that more important than staying alive is staying herself.

My biggest complaint with the film is its first half. It drags on even though the run time is only 87 minutes. You wish Abel could have livened things up a bit  but I think the blame must go to screenwriters and horror vets Larry Cohen, Stuart Gordon and Dennis Paoli for trying to build up the tension and confusion before pulling the rug out from underneath the audience. Luckily fourth writer and Ferrara regular Nicholas St. John manages to articulate Marti's overwhelming sense of loneliness and feeling like an outcast in a handful of scenes between her and the pilot. The film could have used more of that raw emotion. Thankfully, Abel turns it all around in the film's second half. It's pure Ferrara plunging viewers into a world of madness, sudden violence, ample nudity and nihilism. Ultimately 'Body Snatchers' like most of his work is a maddening experience because you get the sense that there's a better movie lurking around somewhere in there. Who knows what kind of restrictions and demands Warner Bros. placed on Abel and his crew but it's  still a little disheartening that the most enduring mind control/conformity story of all time, in the hands of one of the best rebel directors of all time, isn't more subversive and exciting. In many parts it just feels sort of blah. Oh well. At least the film ends, like all of Ferrara's best, on a truly devastating and hopeless note. Consider it Abel's final eff you to Warner Brothers.",1233532800,,3541,4.7124394184168015

116496,3,0790742462,"This third remake falls a bit flat compared to the previous ones. The first big problem is pace, which is kind of slow in the beginning, it does recover its pace around the middle but it's kind of late. The majority of the cast give a solid performance, especially Forrest Whitaker who gives a creepy scene choosing his fate of whether to join the pod people or killing himself. Anyhow without ruining the movie it has a lot of good moments, some of them are unpredictable and scary others are just okay. Ultimately it's an average flick with some great moments in it.

  The film commences with a family arriving at a military base. It seems that the father of the family is scientist contracted by the army of the base, he is given orders to run test in the local waters to check any unfamiliar activity or chemicals that can be hazardous. Forest Whitaker who comes early in the story explains to the scientist that there is some recent strange activity going on; people who are afraid of going to sleep, fear of themselves and others, scientist tries all he can but it's completely out of his hands because with what he s dealing is not chemicals but alien life form which feeds of humans to create an emotionless duplicate. If you have seen the previous remakes than you are more than familiar with the story. Like the other adaptations the pod people make alarming screaming sounds when there are humans still alive, they also start of like cabbages that feed of the people who are sleeping etc. once again the movie has a lot of creepy moments and a somewhat satisfying conclusion. But there something about the movie that feels that it was sort of rushed. I recommend it to rent on a rainy night or to watch when it's on TV but not to buy.

MY PERSONAL RATING: 3 OUT OF 5",1200873600,,1778,4.461538461538462
116497,4,0790742462,"Body Snatchers, was the 3rd film version of Invasion of the Body Snatchers and one has to wonder why anyone felt the need for a 3rd version? This version lacks the creepy feel and campy feel of the original and lacks the bleak tone of the 1st remake. While Body Snatchers, was pointless and doesn't really add anything new it does make for a fun time. There are some problems though and Body Snatchers isn't nearly as good as it could have been, but does provide enough fun to get over the shortcomings.

This time around the setting is a military base and besides that there really isn't much of a difference between this one and the other two. But there are some problems with the movie. Body Snatchers is one of those movies that has so much potential to really be something great, but never fully lives up to that potential. For me that is always very frustrating. When all was said and done Body Snatchers does work, but there were some missed chances.

The screenplay was written by Stuart Gordon, Dennis Paoli & Nicholas St. John. I have to say I was expecting a lot more from these guys. While the script isn't bad or anything it just lacks the character development. While some of the characters have a little depth most of the others are clichd and just lack any development. Gordon and Paoli are probably best known for Re-Animator and both are very good writers so it was a letdown that their script never rises about being slightly above average.

Director Abel Ferrara does an alright job; his scenes are a mixed bag some work quite well and others just seem to lack. The first half of the movie is mostly spent with the characters and getting to know them and the pacing lacks a little in those areas, but that is more due to the writing. A director is obviously very important, but sometimes I feel the success or failure of a movie isn't always due to the director.

The shortcomings in Body Snatchers have more to do with the writing than it does the directing. Like I said the first half has more focus on the characters and since they aren't exactly the best written for some scenes do lack. Ferrara though is unable to make up for that and while by no means is the first half bad it just lacks. The 2nd half though things really pick up and Abel Ferrara is able to craft some wonderful scenes with plenty of action and suspense; the pacing really picks up and the excitement that was lacking a little early on is there in the 2nd half.

As much as I did enjoy Body Snatchers again it wasn't without its problems. Carol played by Meg Tilly is the first of the main characters to have their body taken over and the problem is we barley get to know her so it lacks in that we the audience don't really care. But what does work is it does provide some creepy moments. I love when Carol says to her family, ""Where you gonna go? Where you gonna run? Where you gonna hide? Nowhere, `cause there's no one like you left."" I just love that scene and it was a great and creepy moment.

Gabrielle Anwar plays the lead Marti Malone and her character is probably the best of them all. While her character is sort of the typical type in these type of movies, Anwar is really able to make the most of it and come across as real and likable; When these terrible things begin to happen around her I suppose we can feel for her even if her character is lacking a bit like I said Gabrielle Anwar makes up for that.

My only other problem is I hate when characters go MIA; Jenn played by Christine Elise appears a couple of times early on and while her character was a little clichd I really like Christine Elise and she makes the character work a lot better than maybe it should have. She figures out there is something weird going on, which she tells Marti, but that doesn't really go anywhere. After that Jenn goes MIA for the remainder of the movie until the final few minutes.

Once the invasion starts to break out and the main characters are under attack it's fairly obvious what happened to Jenn, but point is she played a decent enough part that going MIA like that is annoying. Again it's obvious what happened, but I just hate when characters disappear like that. I think there was potential there for something more with the character, but what's done is done.

Now some people might be wondering why the 4-star review? For starters I love the concept of the movie. I'm a big fan of this franchise and the concept is what really gets me so interested. While in no way are these zombie movies they do have a similar concept. One is about the dead coming back and if bitten by a zombie you become one and the Body Snatcher franchise has aliens taking over bodies. Like zombie flicks, you aren't yourself anymore.

Despite any flaws there is also a lot of fun to be found. As stated earlier Gabrielle Anwar delivers a mostly solid performance and Terry Kinney as her father Steve also delivers a solid performance and both characters were quite likeable as well. Also, Body Snatchers was never boring; despite the first half being a little slow in some spots there was enough going on to hold my interest and the 2nd half has a lot of excitement when the only characters left are being chased around. Forest Whitaker is excellent even if a little over the top, but sadly kind of wasted. He only appears in two scenes, but the last scene he does is one of the strongest and one of the creepiest moments of the movie.

While in many ways, Body Snatchers does lack it's still a lot of fun to watch and the 2nd half more than makes up for the slowness of the first half. Body Snatchers does take a good 45-minutes before it really gets going, but overall I very much enjoyed it. If you liked the original and first remake you'll probably enjoy this. Don't expect anything different just enjoy the ride.",1196985600,,5807,4.3975791433891995
116498,2,0790742462,"This version of the Body Snatchers theme is I believe the most plausible version to-date, clearly depicting an accelerated inutero like development of the aliens, after picking the subject's nose, ears and likely any other available orifice with an array of spaghetti tentacles to suck-out the ""life-force"" of whomever they are attempting to replace.  Plus, it better depicts what happens to the original humanoid immediately upon transition.  Besides each neat-nick clone apparently ordered by the collective to clean-up their own mess, it shows in multiple scenes that the alien's need a single consciousness, because even collectively they're not too bright at detecting humanoids or finding good hiding places for their pal pods---like in a closet, over 1/8"" perforated-balsa bathroom ceiling panels, or under someone's bed.  Now aren't those the first places you'd look for a body snatcher pod?

But the primary problem with this version is that it starts out with depressing sun-down and available-light shots, and it just gets chronically darker after that.  In other words, there was just too much relentless drama, from beginning to end.  Plus, all of the characters were already depressed and suicidal candidates anyway, so there wasn't much difference after the metamorphoses.  While well acted by most everyone in the cast, just don't anyone tell me that was a nude body-double for Meg Tilly's hip-mom character.  That would be truly disappointing.

116501,4,0790742462,"I loved both the '56 and '78 versions of INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS. The paranoia factor is high in both movies, adding to the ultimate dread of such an alien invasion. In BODY SNATCHERS, the alien conspiracy takes place on an army base, where it can barely be noticed. After all, lack of emotion, group-think, and ""following the leader"" are pretty much standard military protocol. Marti (Gabrielle Anwar) is a typical bored teenager, brought along by her EPA scientist dad to investigate toxic waste at the base. As things grow increasingly bizarre around her, Marti must fight to keep her sanity, her identity, and her life. Meg Tilly (Psycho 2) is at first goofy, then blankly evil as Carol, Marti's replicated stepmum. Forest Whitaker (Species) is overrought in his role as the army captain who tries to stay awake long enough to defeat the invaders. R. Lee Ermey (The Frighteners) is General Pratt, the head of more than just an army installation! BODY SNATCHERS is fittingly eerie, with that atmosphere of certain doom that I like so much!

They went a lot further this time in raising my blood pressure and increasing heart palpatations. I must also say that Meg Tilly played her part to the hilt! If they give some sort of Oscar for horror flicks, she has my vote. Just excellent! For younger horror buffs who don't know what 'Pod People' are, this is a must see (or they can visit my town, we have a few). For the older folks who dearly loved the original, don't despair.

116504,4,0790742462,"Did we need a third version of Jack Finney's classic novel about an alien takeover via creepy pods?  Probably not, but Abel Ferrara's treatment on the familiar theme has some faithful relics from the first two (the sleep influence, the horrifying screams to identify non-conversions), and stands on its own as a creepy little thriller.

This time the movie is set on an Army base where the pods are being managed by the soldiers and staff.  An EPA Chemical investigator arrives with his family (a daughter, son and new wife) and soon they all become involved.

Meg Tilly has a smallish role but is frighteningly chilling as the mother who has plans for hubby and kin.  Gabrielle Anwar has one of her first roles as teenage daughter Marty who finds herself falling for hunky chopper pilot Billy Wirth.  Dad Terry Kinney tries to save his family; R. Lee Ermey is the camp general; Christine Elise his wild daughter and Forest Whitaker is the camp medic who takes drastic measures to prevent his takeover.

This time, however, the story revolves around a teenage girl, her brother, her step-mother and her father, who is doing some testing at a military base. There is the clich&eacute;d ""You're not my real mother"" bickering between the girl, played by the luscious Gabrielle Anwar, and the stepmother (Meg Tilley), as well as the clich&eacute;d tension between the girl and her father, who just doesn't understand what its like to be a teenager. Blah. I'm not certain why the producers wanted to make another body snatching alien movie, but wouldn't one assume they would at least want to surpass the first two? Otherwise, why even make the movie? Even so, it is worth watching if for no other reason than to see Gabrielle Anwar in all her splendor.

116538,4,0790742462,"In a life filled with uncertainty, one thing is for sure...once Hollywood latches onto a good thing, it won't let it go...a prime example of this is Jack Finney's ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" story, popularized by the 1956 Don Siegel sci-fi film classic featuring Kevin McCarthy.  Since then, there have been any number of remakes or films based on the story, most popular probably being the 1978 version featuring Donald Sutherland, which I enjoyed, but not quite as much as the original...a few years later a group of writers, including Larry Cohen (It's Alive, The Stuff) and Stuart Gordon (Re-Animator, From Beyond) came up with the film Body Snatchers (1983), directed by Abel Ferrara (The Driller Killer, King of New York), and featuring Terry Kinney (Fly Away Home), Meg Tilly (Psycho II, The Big Chill), Gabrielle Anwar (Scent of a Woman), Billy Wirth (The Lost Boys), Forest Whitaker (Platoon), Christine Elise (Child's Play 2), and R. Lee Ermey (Full Metal Jacket)...by the way, before I forget, there's a film scheduled to be released in 2006 titled The Visiting, featuring Nicole Kidman...here's the synopsis from The Internet Movie Database...'As a Washington psychiatrist (Kidman) unearths the origin of an alien epidemic, she also discovers her son might be the only way it can be stopped.'  Sound familiar?  It should, if you've seen any of the previous `Snatcher' movies I've mentioned, proving that in Hollywood every thing old is new again...and again...and again...

As the story begins, we meet the Malone family...there's Steve (Kinney), who's the father, Carol (Tilly), his wife, Steve's daughter Marti (Anwar), and her younger brother Andy...seems Steve's 1st wife, who was also Marti's mother, passed away a while back...anyway, the family is on the road, as Steve, a chemist, works for the EPA, and is touring military facilities in the south to ensure proper storage and handling of all the nasty biowarefare chemicals they claim they don't have.  After Marti has a strange encounter in a gas station restroom (it wasn't with George Michael), the family arrives at the base and settles into their new quarters.  Things seem normal enough, but strangeness settles in, as more and more people seem not actually to be living, but going through the motions.  Now one might chalk this up to the military and its tendency to squash individuality in general, but it's something else, something more, something alien...and it has something to do with the slimy pods being pulled out of a nearby swamp during the night.  Pretty soon the base is divided into two factions, normal people and spore people (the former dwindling rapidly) and the ominous serenity devolves into extreme chaos...just remember, they get you when you sleep...

You know what?  I enjoyed this movie...I also enjoyed the original release and the one from the late 70s.  The main difference I noticed was that while the previous two tended to share many similarities (the main being the overwhelming sense of paranoia inherent within the story), this one kind of went off it its own direction, choosing horror and action over suspense, with focus given to Anwar as the lead character.  Perhaps they were trying to appeal to a younger audience, I don't know, but the overall result was better than I would have thought.  The budget may not have been large, but I think what they had they made good use of...at the very least the filmmakers knew enough to bring in a very solid cast who worked well together.  I don't know that any one performer stood out above the others, but they felt professional and maintained a sense of belonging in the story.  I did feel a few of the characters got slighted, especially the one played by Forest Whitaker, but oh well. There were a couple clichs running about, like General Platt's (Ermey) rebellious daughter, played by Ms. Elise and the handsome, hero chopper pilot with the perfect hair, played by Wirth, but their roles ended up being relatively minor in the overall scheme of things.  Ferrara keeps things lively with some good shocks, despite the fact the action didn't really kick in until about 45 minutes into the story.  The one gripe I would make, if any, is that the film ended too soon, running about 87 minutes.  It felt like there was more story to be had by the end, but I suppose it's better not to out stay one's welcome.  I thought the gooey effects were good, the spaghetti-like tendrils emanating from the pods especially creepy.  The one scene that stands out in my mind is when Marti is taking a bath, and dozes off...oh looky there...someone stuck a pod above the ceiling tiles.  Hey, something's moving...ewww, here come some creepy crawlers, searching for a host.  You know, I don't think whoever put that pod up there had put much thought into placement, as even I would have know that once the pod started developing a replicant, the weight of said doppelganger would have been too much for those measly tiles to handle...but, it did provide for a nasty little sequence.  And here's nekkid lowdown, if you're interested...Ms. Anwar does bare her teeny tots twice, the second time more so than the first.  While enjoyable, I did feel a little uncomfortable specifically because her character was supposed to be not of drinking age, and let's face it, Anwar is the definitive waif.  Even if her character was supposed to be eighteen, she still looked all of about fourteen (Anwar was about 23 at the time the movie was made).  The movie also features what appears to be a full frontal nekkid shot of Ms. Tilly, but the credits reveal a body double was employed...oh well, boobage is boobage...there is one sequence that was particularly funny (to me, at least), near the end, featuring a boy and a helicopter.  If you've seen the film, you know what I'm talking about...if not, well, I'm not going to say anymore than I already have...overall I thought this film an interesting mix of science fiction, horror, and action, and something along the lines of what a director like John Carpenter might put out, only much more toned down.

This Warner Brother's DVD release features both the full and widescreen versions, the widescreen being 2.35:1 anamorphic, both looking very clear and sharp.  The Dolby Surround 2.0 comes through very well.  As far as special features, there are none, as the film starts playing immediately when inserted into the player.  You can get an interactive menu screen to appear displaying scene access and language options, but nothing else.

116543,5,0790742462,"Not too many films get remade twice with almost identical titles. Sooner or later, you have to say ""enough already."" Jack Finney's novel ""The Body Snatchers"" has seen three incarnations: First in 1958, directed by Don Siegel; then in 1978, directed by Philip Kaufman; and finally in 1994, directed by Abel Ferrara. How many times, and in how many ways, can you tell the same story?

The first two Body Snatcher films are virtually identical. The signs of the times exist within their style, as well as how their stories are presented. The first film was driven by McCarthyism. The second represented the death of the flower people and the birth of the ""Me Generation,"" which eventually would extend into Reagan's 80s. In 1994, Gulf War Syndrome was spooking people back home as our soldiers returned home from Iraq. What were we really subjecting our boys to over there? Why do they share these identical symptoms? These questions are the driving force for this version of ""Body Snatchers.""

Set on a military base, Abel Ferrara's ""Body Snatchers"" tells the story of a family in limbo through the eyes of the only daughter, Marty (Gabrielle Anwar). Her father (Terry Kinney) works for the EPA, and has been called in to investigate possible contaminated by-products of chemical weaponry. Marty resents her father for marrying again, and producing a younger brother whom she has to share space - and love - with.

This simple plot point is storytelling brilliance on behalf of the writers. As we identify with Marty, when all hell does finally break loose, the basis for her revulsion is already in place. Also brilliant is the decision to set this rendition of ""Body Snatchers"" on an Air Force Base. Men and women who are trained to stand the same way, walk the same way; shine their shoes, make their beds, and stare straight ahead... identically. There is already a hive mind in place when the body snatchers come to town. What a terrific place to start an invasion, to slip in under the radar without triggering notice.

With all these elements in place, Ferrara takes his time to build some suspense with some wickedly creepy imagery. Look for the shadows behind Terry Kinney's shoulder in his first scene with Forest Whitaker's base physician. Look for the denture plate laying in the sand. These are wonderful touches, hiking up our awareness ever-so-slightly before Ferrara unleashes Hell.

The last half of this film is as intense as any film I've ever seen. The energy of the film extends into the cinematography, which conducts itself with a calm serenity until the reveal of the body snatchers in Marty's house, and then becomes uncontrollably nimble. Ferrara and his director of photography, Bojan Bazelli, create the perfect look and feel to the atmosphere of their story. Along with the films of John Carpenter and the remarkable visual style of ""Gothika,"" ""Body Snatchers"" deserves a spot among the most visually stunning horror films ever made. It's too bad that not as many people have seen this film as they have the 1978 Philip Kaufman version. I believe this is the better film - the best of the Body Snatcher films. It's fast, terrifying, first-rate work.",1112313600,8,3176,4.884972170686456
116544,2,0790742462,"Body Snatchers (Abel Ferrara, 1993)

Okay. Put together a sure-fire story, with a reworking by low-budget horror master Stuart Gordon. Slap on a B-movie who's-who cast with a couple of more prominent names, and then hand the whole thing to cutting-edge wunderkind Abel Ferrara. As an added bonus, add in that most of them were coming off career-high performances. It's a slam dunk, right?

Well, not quite. Ferrara (who'd recently made news with Bad Lieutenant) and Gordon (cruising high on Honey, I Shrunk the Kids) teamed up to come up with a pretty good script. Certainly not one of Gordon's best, but it's workable. They then managed to find a casting director with impeccable taste. And yet, somehow, the whole thing never quite jells.

Marty (Scent of a Woman's Gabrielle Anwar) and her family are travelling to a military base for the summer. Her father Steve (Terry Kinney, coming off Last of the Mohicans) works for the EPA, and is out investigating rumors of PCBs in the local water supply. Also along for the ride are Marty's brother Andy (Reilly Murphy, in the middle of his very brief film career) and Steve's new wife, Carol (Meg Tilly, who'd had a part in The Two Jakes a few years previous). Needless to say, teenage daughter + stepmother = tension. The base is headed up by General Platt (the ever-present R. Lee Ermey), who doesn't care whether they have a problem or not. His foil is the camp medic, Major Collins (Forest Whitaker, coming off his fantastic role in Article 99), who's not only convinced there's a problem, but that it's causing imminent danger to the men. Unless you've been in a cave for the past fifty years, you know what happens next.

Yet, somehow, a whole lot of good actors, a great screenwriter, and a fantastic director managed to come up with a movie that's just ""eh"". One expects nudity from an Abel Ferrara film, and one is rewarded (albeit briefly). But one also expects good acting, especially from a cast of this caliber, and a certain feeling of unease, and neither one exists. Basically, it just doesn't feel like an Abel Ferrara movie.

Worth watching if you're a fan of any of the principals, but don't expect a movie as good as either of the other versions. **",1109548800,2,2215,4.698453608247423

The first two movies (1956 & 1978) were great because in their own way, each faithfully depicted the atmosphere of total dispair found in the book. This installment didn't adhere very well to the mood or the original plot, at the same time it didn't bring any innovation to the story line, the way that the 1978 version did. If you're a fan of ""Invasion..."", I don't recomend it. If you are watching it for the horror aspect, eigther of the first two is superior to this one. I also recomend, John Carpenter's: ""The Thing""; and Robert Heilein's: ""The Puppet Masters"", staring Donald Southerland.",1066262400,6,809,4.625
116556,4,0790742462,"Many have felt that the ability for the pods to take over the whole town in the first movie was a good stretch.  To take over LA in the second movie was just impossible.  But in this third version of the story, the setting is just right.
An EPA agent and his family are visiting an army base where there might be toxic waste leaking into the environment.  Little do they know that chemicals are not the real threat.  Strange pods have been found in the marsh.
As you are probably aware, the pods grow into duplicates of people and then replace them.  On an army base, once an officer has been taken, it is easy to trap the lower ranks.  It also means that the pod people have access to weapons supplies.
But the locale is not the only improvement in this version.  We get plenty of key scenes where you never quite know who is still themselves and who can not be trusted.  The conversion process has also been improved to explain how the pods can copy people and what happens to the bodies afterwards.
There is quite a bit of nudity in this version, so it is not as accessible as the earlier versions, but is definitely worth it.",1063065600,15,1129,4.2924528301886795
116557,4,0790742462,"The third screen version of Finney's novel is the least necessary, the former two versions succeeding brilliantly, each in different ways, in conveying the horror of undercover invasion and increasing paranoia.  But that doesn't mean it isn't good.  Quite good, in fact.
As in the previous versions, the characters are real and credible, making the incredible situations more dramatic for the viewer.  The special effects are as gruesome as in the '78 remake, but less horrific than in that version due to mere repetition.
This time, the alien seed pods strike where the iron is hottest, in the military bases of the U.S.  They have more direction, more purpose, and more feeling than before, though they are still plainly alien to our psychology.  The pods are never on the defensive here, having already established dominion and merely defending their footholds.  Meg Tilly has the best scene and line in the show, when she confronts fleeing family members with the stark reality, ""Where ya gonna run?  Where ya gonna hide?  Nowhere.  Because there's no one...like you...left.""

116558,3,0790742462,"The 1956 version of the story (a five-star film) got us where we lived - or thought we lived: in small-town America, where everybody knows everybody, and the good ol' values prevail (under threat of Red Menace, of course). The 1978 version (a four-star film) wisely transported the story out of a setting in which we now knew we no longer lived, and made the tale a fable of urban paranoia. This latest draft may have some interesting creepiness in its barren military-base setting, and may have some good FX for the FX freaks, but it has become essentially a story about a grumpy teenager, just like 95% of the films that emerge from Hollywood. Whatever virtue it may have is sadly diluted by the obviousness of its producer's motives in seeking to empty the pockets of his neighbor's children.",970185600,3,795,4.685714285714286
116559,3,0790742462,"...but entertaining, nevertheless.
Abel Ferrera...I don't really know what to think of his movies.  Some (like ""New Rose Hotel"")are dreadful beyond all probability, and some are quite enjoyable (like Body  Snatchers).
Ferrera's ""Body Snatchers"" is entertainment that  hits its mark.  That is, it isn't a botched stab at ""art"" the way  the inexplicably horrible ""New Rose Hotel"" is. The narrative  moves along at a fast clip, the editing is slick, the acting on target.  It  just isn't as creepy as the earlier versions.  In this version, the body  snatchers take over military bases...well, a soldier's crisp demeanor is  rather body snatcherish to begin with--as it should be! While one might  expect this to heighten the sense of paranoia--""Is he one of  them?""--in this movie, it doesn't.
There are some obvious holes in  the narrative, and the pod people are not quite the emotionless drones that  they were in earlier versions.  They seem to show traces of  malice.
Still, this is an entertaining flick, and worth a look.",964483200,7,1026,5.047904191616767

To be sure, this is a retread of a scenario so familiar that the reference 'pod people' has entered the language as a recognizable expression.  That said, this is simply a sharp horror film.  Miles above the thing done in the '70s, this film is tight, building tension in each scene and never letting loose.  I live for the experience of recommending a class act most folks have probably not heard of.  This is one of those pictures.",953164800,30,609,4.5

While the 1956 original is often thought of as a parody of Communistic  paranoia, this one is definitely a comment  on the AIDS virus and how it operates. Just as HIV attacks the body's  immune system,the pods here take over a military base-the first line of  defense against any invasion. Not only that, they turn the military into a  means of distribution, spreading themselves around to other bases.

116563,3,0790742462,"If books are generally the best editions of any given story, then the first movies adapted from them are usually the best.
""Body Snatchers"", which is based on the book ""The Invasion of the Body  Snatchers"" by Jack Finney, is the third adaption of this story, via  VHS. There is one black and white version from 1956 which I haven't yet  seen (which is really a paraody of the 50s fear of communists, or so I  hear) and then there is a 1970s version starring Donald Sutherland,  Veronica Cartwright and Jeff Goldblum, which scared my hair gray.
This  movie is the americanized version of an alien tale. It is over-done to the  point of glowing, it is so polished. Some people like perfection, but in  horror movies, especially ""hokey"" horror movies, I like a few  flaws. This movie has the sense of having been regurgitated through the  ages. Nothing in it seems ""new"". Despite that, the youthful cast  (practically all the main characters are ""kids"") do the best job  possible, given the circumstances. I rate this movie a 6 out of a 10. It is  a good thing to pick up if you're looking at the video store for a  last-minute rental, and are stumped, but if you want a thriller for a  birthday party or something, see the 70s version.",948240000,2,1233,4.515837104072398
116564,3,0790742462,"While this is not the best of the three versions of Jack Finney's story it is still an enjoyable adaptation. I get the impression that it is meant to be a sequel of sorts to the 1978 Kaufman film, shifting the location from  San Francisco to an army base.
Lacking the suspense and paranoia of its  two predecessors the film manages to lift itself above potential  mediocrity. Its a fun way to pass the time and does not drag on for too  long, but don't expect anything thought provoking or scary.
The DVD  transfer is quite good, apart from very slight artefacting during the  opening titles. The major letdown is the lack of features - no trailer, no  commentary (surely Robert H Solo could have said something, explaining why  he produced 2 different versions of the story?).",944956800,8,777,4.62043795620438

7791617,4,0790742462,"Because every fifteen years or so Jack Finney's seminal novel, ""The Body Snatchers,"" is apparently required to be re-adapted to the big-screen, we have been treated to some versions that are absolutely iconic (1978) and some that are downright awful (2007). Riding the middle lane is Abel Ferrara's 1993 digression, simply titled ""Body Snatchers.""

Set on a military base, ""Body Snatchers"" is notably different from other versions of the story in more ways than one. Because of its isolated (and often one-note) locale, the plot feels slightly claustrophobic and, at a breezy 87 minutes, a little half-baked as well. A change in pace, this version of the story concerns an EPA agent (Terry Kinney) and his family, who are stationed at the aformentioned base. Naturally, an alien life-form has slowly crept in, turning his already dysfunctional family against one another. Meg Tilly plays his wife, who is given perhaps the film's most interesting dialogue (it's all about that chilling ""Where you gonna go?"" speech). Teen daughter Gabrielle Anwar, meanwhile, mashes up with a few locals, which happens to include a walking cliche gen-Xer played by Christine Elise. This piece of the plot doesn't really add up to much and only distracts from the tightly-wound story. Maybe they were trying to play to a younger audience? At any rate, it doesn't really do the film any favors as, aside from the always-game Elise and charming Anwar, the other teens/youngsters are almost as cold and lifeless as the husks left in the aliens' wake.

In spite of its flaws, the film is really quite basic in a charming way yet it's all over seemingly just as it starts to gain momentum. Abel Ferrara's direction is, erm, able. With the look of a Tony Scott or even an early Michael Bay production, his film is perhaps the most stylized of all the ""Snatcher"" films and most definitely a product of the '90s. The special effects are the true star here, with some truly grotesque stuff including the birth of the ""pod people."" None of this improves on the 1978 version, which is arguably the best adaptation thus far, but as a keyhole, glimpse into a small story taking place within a larger event type film (think ""10 Cloverfield Lane""), it works quite well. If you find this one languishing on a shelf, collecting dust, it's certainly worth snatching up.",1501286400,3,2333,4.888888888888889
