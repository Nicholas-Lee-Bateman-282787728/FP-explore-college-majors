8475525,1,B005J9YQ16,"Any documentary that starts with a bible quote is already on shaky ground. This is a biased documentary about a near boarder line conspiracy about the denial of the 'toxic' effects of mold. No proof is given that is is clearly toxic, also there not enough sources speaking out that it is not. Most of documentary focus on a agoraphobic man that plays online poker for an income.  Everything around him, not even mold seems to cause him problems. His wife is even more manic claiming the air conditioner is 'burning her skin'. There is plenty of photographs of their old moldy apartment that launched this whole documentary, however there are no photographs taken by either of their chronic outward symptoms that they have complained. Whether taken either by themselves or their physician. All we see are a hypochondriac couple wrapping everything in plastic and aluminum duct tape. They sometimes wear a mask inside, no gloves or just one. I see this 'documentary' more as therapy for their mental illness that anything credible.",1526342400,,1029,4.9479768786127165

8475527,1,B005J9YQ16,"Very little real information about black mold, particularly from any scientific perspective, but a fascinating study in hypochondria and OCD which seriously tested the limits of my empathy for ""Karen"" and ""Michael"".  While this was billed as ""entertaining and shocking,""  this couple's apparent psychiatric problems were much more shocking than entertaining.  I managed to make it through the first hour, but then I felt an overwhelming urge to just get on with my own life.",1507939200,5,474,5.293333333333333
8475528,5,B005J9YQ16,"I wished managers & owners would take this seriously help protect people and be kind.  I have insensitivities to mold and really get sick from it!  I told the VA that I'm more allergic to mold than most the VA doctors tricked me and injected mold into my body! I became so sick!  We cannot seem to get real help many murders & many are killed within the VA system!  I was looking into the dome homes I was getting excited I thought mold would not grow on concert & steel, but I found that out to be not true.  When you are not educated in the subject matter and people are being dishonest, mean, & tricky how can you protect yourself?  Thank you for the documentary I enjoyed watching and appreciate the information.  I hope all is doing well many blessings!",1507334400,2,758,4.295774647887324
8475529,5,B005J9YQ16,Thank you for validating that we're all not crazy!  At this point I think I am a little crazy but learning to live a moldy life is sometimes very hard,1502496000,3,150,4.0
8475530,5,B005J9YQ16,I've had mold illness for years.  It's a very difficult and debilitating sickness.  Very isolating too since people around you think you are crazy.  This film does a good job of validating the illness and showing how frustrating life is living with it.,1501113600,4,252,4.813953488372093
8475531,5,B005J9YQ16,"This was not what I expected in a good way. It was entertaining, but informative. This isn't a Michael Moore film, where you seem to only get one side. It was a very unbiased viewpoint. It doesn't go on about boring details that you would expect when watching a movie with this title. The stories of the people are amazing and sad. Now I know what to look out for with my own home and family. Highly recommend!",1494633600,,410,4.269230769230769
8475532,3,B005J9YQ16,I found this video entertaining. I expected to find out more scientific hazards of mold however realized it was a documentary. Not completely what I expected.,1368835200,6,158,5.115384615384615
