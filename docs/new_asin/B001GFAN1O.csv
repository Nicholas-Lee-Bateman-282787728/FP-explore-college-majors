8305301,3,B001GFAN1O,"The Harry Potter story and movies are great but this boxset is a complete waste of money if you're expecting something unique to this boxset.  It's just the leftover main feature discs from other 2-disc boxsets because the discs are the exact same discs when orignally released as individual movies; which means if you're expecting special features, chances are they're on the other disc which isn't included.

Also playback is a headache if you're using your computer to view them because Windows Media Player is always crashing when playing these discs.  I tried other DVDs and had no problems with playback.

I'm ordering the ultimate editions and hopefully they will not have the same problems.",1284422400,,698,5.043478260869565
8305302,4,B001GFAN1O,"Harry Potter is certainly an entertaining fantasy series. Overall, the three main characters - Harry, Ron, and Hermione - are well cast and convey both the joy and seriousness of the wizarding world. I do take a star off for the fact that the movies often have huge plots holes and sometimes meander off into irrelevant sidetracks. It seems the directors and scriptwriters weren't quite sure how to transform the books into movies. For example, it never really becomes clear how and why Voldemort has gained so many followers. Is it a certain ideology? Is it because his followers want to kill muggles? It just seems that he's a two-dimensional ""bad guy"" with nothing better to do than be evil. That's something I think could have been explored more than, say, Harry's flirtations with Cho (he ends up marrying Ginny anyway). Hopefully, there will be a extended versions of the movies like the Lord of the Rings extended versions that can fill in some of these plot holes and make the story richer. On the whole though, they're still fun to watch.",1264204800,,1047,4.758241758241758
