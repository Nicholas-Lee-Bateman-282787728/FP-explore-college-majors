1924378,5,B0000DEYSZ,"Wonderful training film that is as good today as it was back in the mid 70's when it was the ONLY film of its kind.  Pele is still the Master and his Method the one to learn and use.  I have been blessed to attend games in the U.S. and actually see Pele play for both Santos and the New York Cosmos.  Along with this DVD training film - if you have not seen the movie&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Victory/dp/6304779666/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Victory</a>&nbsp;it is a must see movie with Pele, Bobby Moore, Michael Caine, Sylvester Stallone, Max Von Sydow, Werner Roth and a host of other great players.",1277337600,2,652,5.25
1924379,5,B0000DEYSZ,"""Soccer - Pele: The Master & His Method"" principally shows Pele demonstrating his extraordinary skills on the beach, the park and as a professional playing for Brazil and in practice sessions with his team Santos FC.  It is a great introduction for those new to the sport not only to see the talent of this famous player and the skills required to succeed at the game but the passion surrounding the game as well.  Set to a lively samba beat, with many children shown, it is both inspiring and lighthearted and would be enjoyed by the entire family.  You can't come away without a love of this man and the beautiful game.",1262995200,4,621,4.526785714285714
1924380,5,B0000DEYSZ,"My son is a fairly talented 9 year old who absolutely loves this game and is keen to learn the key soccer skills.  While I was a decent player in soccer, I was better at other sports and clearly, didn't have the talent for soccer that my kid does.  Since at this age, it is very important for kids to learn the right techniques for shooting, trapping, heading, dribbling etc, I did a thorough internet search on good soccer coaching books and DVDs etc.

While I found and read couple good books (e.g. Baffled Parents Guides to Coaching Youth Soccer), I can honestly say that I have never come across a soccer book or a DVD that demonstrates all the necessary skills in a very simple, easy-to-learn manner - like this Pele DVD does.  Now, whenever my kid has any questions about his shooting or trapping technique, he just puts this DVD in and watches how Pele does it.  In fact, that's exactly what I do also, since after all, who the heck am I to argue against Pele :)",1255478400,13,969,4.361111111111111
1924381,5,B0000DEYSZ,"You can watch this video over and over and learn something new everytime.  It is not just instructional, but, it has historical information that inspires a passion and love for the game.",1219622400,4,186,4.8125
1924382,4,B0000DEYSZ,"This video was interesting, but I thought it would be about Pele's history, but instead it is a video teaching you how to play like Pele.",1153008000,6,137,4.3076923076923075

8000799,4,B0000DEYSZ,I watched this video in High School on the soccer team.  I thought it was a really inspiring video then.  When my daughter started playing soccer I remembered this video and went searching.  It has some great instructional content and (what I like best) some cool video of Pele in World Cup games doing what he does best.  I got it to educate and inspire my daughter.  I hope we will watch it many times before each season.,1347408000,2,423,4.371794871794871
