8416882,3,B0045X9A7C,"I pretty much love all the West ladies dvd's but, this one had some hard to do crafts along with some I don't think people would readily do. For example, the making of a Quill Pen. It was fun to watch though. The bird feeder was absolutely gorgeous by the time it was finished but, too much work, time and materials were put into it. The Baby Basket was adorable and pretty easy to make along with the rest of the crafts.",1391126400,,421,4.146341463414634
