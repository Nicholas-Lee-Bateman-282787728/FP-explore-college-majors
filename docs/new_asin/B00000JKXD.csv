1233721,5,B00000JKXD,"Very enjoyable program about the history, variety and community of ice cream.  As with other programs from this producer, he has a way of producing a program about a topic, presenting it very well--yet, the show is really about americana and the people behind the topic.

Please, don't you dare watch this show without plenty of ice cream and toppings on hand.",1094169600,6,360,4.790322580645161
1233722,3,B00000JKXD,"What is not to love about an ice cream show? No matter what, you know you are going to see a lot of happy people, lots of interesting places, and an insiders look into how this combination of cream, sugar, and fruit gets  made.  This was an enjoyable, though disjointed, cruise through an american  pasttime, eating ice cream.  The variety of different locations, and  different flavors kept me in the seat, and the fun narration was constantly  assuring me that it wasn't taking its topic too seriously.  I will admit to  eating more ice cream since I watched it, what the heck...it's June.",962150400,5,591,4.669902912621359

7912394,5,B00000JKXD,"I grew up watching this show nearly every summer since I was around 12 years old and it has sort of become a tradition of mine to see it. So when PBS stopped showing this as frequently,  I decided to buy it. And it was wonderful. Especially with the extra footage!
Highly recommend this!",1468800000,,287,4.314814814814815
7912395,4,B00000JKXD,"Likely it was a manufacturing shortcoming but the tape inside the cassette was not fully wound and could have ruined my VCR if I had not noticed. I was able to fix the malfunction and the video played as well as a VHS can be expected.

Thanks",1383264000,,242,4.148936170212766

7912397,5,B00000JKXD,"PBS what more do I need to say, they make great shows! Travel to all kinds of ice cream shops, learn a little history, hear of some flavors better left untried. Pure enjoyment.",1277942400,,176,4.363636363636363

But ""An Ice Cream Show"" is also informative.  Learn how much milk fat it takes to qualify an ice cream as 'premium.'  See how cones are made.  Delve into the technological mysteries of Penn State's Ice Cream Lab.

So sit back and enjoy the road trip as Rick visits ice cream lovers across the USA.

7912399,4,B00000JKXD,"Actually, knowing the views of some of

the PBS crowd, harmless videos like this

almost want to make me contribute, again.

But then they took Red Green off in my area!

Seriously, one of the best programs they did

in the last few years. Really shows all the

faucets of this industry. I have been to the

places in here in VA and out in Oah'u, Hawai'i!

Great job, PBS!",1154304000,,372,4.214285714285714
7912400,5,B00000JKXD,This is just fun to watch. You get a mini tour of the United States via ice cream. The people and the places are the stars of the show. We watched this the same night as A Hot Dog Program and enjoyed both!,1148428800,,205,3.7906976744186047
