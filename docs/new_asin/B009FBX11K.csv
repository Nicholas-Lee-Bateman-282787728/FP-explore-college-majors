5324106,4,B009FBX11K,"Yes this is another Thomas DVD with the same wholesome lessons as the others, but my boys love it.  This DVD features four episodes each featuring Thomas and his friends getting into mischief but learning lessons in the longrun.  They are wholesome episodes with the trains solving problems, working together and getting into mischief.  I like that they focus on solving problems which my boys could definitely use help with.

Episodes include:
""Stuck on You""
""Spencer the Grand""
""Gordon and Ferdinand""
""Charlie and Eddie""",1359504000,5,522,5.178571428571429

5324108,5,B009FBX11K,"I just love Thomas DVD's!  Not quite as much as my son Reed but, enough to watch them all with him.  The characters are cute with lots of personality and most importantly, they are well behaved.  Well, most of the time!  And when they aren't, it's to teach a lesson.

Thomas and Butch are using magnets and literally get stuck.  I like the comparison between that and friends sticking together. Reed is at the age (four) that friends are a huge part of his life.  I talked to him about friends helping each other out with they get stuck in certain situations.

Another thing my son really seems to enjoy is the humor.  It's a bit corny but that's perfect for kids!  They crack jokes and Reed laughs like it's the funniest thing ever!  And this kid does not usually laugh out loud at shows!  I think train lovers have a certain kind of brain so they probably have similar senses of humor too!

Hit Entertainment has another high quality, entertaining DVD! It amazes me that these Thomas shows are released so often and yet they never suffer in quality based on the quantity.  This would make a fun stocking stuffer for little boys!",1354752000,3,1130,4.4754901960784315

8540937,4,B009FBX11K,"My nearly-two year old son loves the Thomas episode collections.

This DVD includes:
Stuck on You- Thomas is chosen to be the Sodor Rescue Engine for the day, with Butch as his assistant. Victor fits Butch with a magnet and tries to explains how it works, but Thomas thinks he knows everything about magnets and drives off. Thomas gets himself stuck to Butch and has to drive back to the Steamworks for Victor's help.

Spencer the Grand- A thick fog has descended on the island of Sodor and Sir Topham Hatt asks all the engines to stay put until it lifts. Spencer tells them all that he's grander than them and ""I can puff perfectly,"" setting off for the Duke and Duchess' summer house. He ends up at the quarry, the waste dump, then back at Tidmouth Sheds. He's embarrassed that he can't find his way in the fog. When the engines discover Percy is lost in the fog, Spencer sees it as an opportunity to redeem himself and sets out to find him.

Gordon and Ferdinand- Ferdinand is rewarded for being a useful engine by being assigned to help Gordon pull the very grand Lion of Sodor around the island, where all the visitors can see them. Gordon doesn't want to be seen with ""funny, frumpy Ferdinand,"" and doesn't want to share HIS special. Gordon decides to puff on deserted tracks. His mind on other things, he is the reason the Lion of Sodor ends up in the mud. Later, Gordon later feels bad about how he treated Ferdinand, and although he doesn't apologize, he DOES praise him to others and calls him a ""very good friend.""

Charlie and Eddie- Edward is tasked with getting a message to the mechanic to repair Sir Topham Hatt's car before the mechanic leaves the island. Charlie, the self-proclaimed ""fun"" engine, arrives and tells Edward a joke but because Edward does not laugh, Charlie says he is no fun. Edward spends the day trying to prove to Charlie that he IS fun, and forgets to get a message to the mechanic. Sir Topham Hatt is upset that his car is not fixed and Edward has to answer for his mistake.

Mr. Perkins Clips- Mr. Perkins is organizing a Scavenger Hunt for the children, but Sir Topham Hatt has organized a mini-scavenger hunt for him to complete first!",1413504000,2,2177,4.5152284263959395
