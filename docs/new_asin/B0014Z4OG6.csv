3136543,5,B0014Z4OG6,I just ordered the set. This week's Entertainment Weekly magazine called this a best bet and gave it a A rating. I'm going to give it a shot.,1212192000,,141,4.071428571428571
3136544,4,B0014Z4OG6,"This is not my ""final"" review of this fascinating box set. I hope to do that after I return from vacation. But, it is such a landmark production that I wanted to at least post something. Having just finished all 17 hours (!) of material, there is so much to digest. I hope I can give you at least an idea of what to expect.

First, I don't think there has ever been a documentary project of this scope in documenting the ""History of Popular Music"". Director Tony Palmer literally traveled the world to film thousands of hours of performances and interviews with the ""key players"", who shed light on all aspects of the ""popular music"" business. These interviewees are singers, musicians, agents, critics, record producers and composers. And the quotes that Palmer - who seems to actually be doing the interviewers in most cases are gems. Phil Spector in the mid-70s discussing his music while playing a guitar! (Have you ever seen Spector playing an instrument?). Producer John Hammond on racism in the industry. Hoagy Carmichael on his hit ""Stardust"", Pete Seeger on ""what is folk music?"". David Bowie saying ""I never wanted to be a rock star."" It's gems like these that make this essential viewing for anyone, of any age, who cares about ""Popular Music"".  And Palmer conducted interviews with Bing Crosby, Rudy Vallee and Eubie Blake before they died.

Let me also point out that ""Popular Music"" as covered in the 17 chapters of this set means any music that is not ""Classical"". Presented mostly chronologically in the order that these musical styles occurred, there are Episodes devoted to Ragtime, Blues, Jazz Country, Vaudeville (and Music Hall, since this is a British production), Swing, Protest Songs and , finally - for the last four Episodes - Rock music. Actually the Rock sections are the weakest of the set as quite a few of these artists' careers went nowhere. And the set ends with Virgin Records founder saying, in 1980, that Mike Oldfield (whose ""Tubular Beels"" was a smash hit on Branson's label) is ""the future of Popular Music"".

It's also very important to know the background of the project. From 1976 to 1980 the 17 Episodes were broadcast on British TV and, to my knowledge, never aired in the US. So we are missing the last 27 years of pop music history. No Disco, no Punk, no Alternative and no Disney on Broadway. Younger viewers will be surprised to see all the long hair and sideburns, leisure suits and wide shirt collars. But this was the period when the interviews were done.. The series was recorded on film and, though the soundtrack has been remastered, the film stock was not restored. It looks dated. Palmer sometimes becomes quirky in his choices of visuals. The early ""Vaudeville and Music Hall"" Episode has some nice footage of Al Jolson and some British Music Hall performers but it also has a topless stripper from circa 1975. In the Episode on Protest Songs we hear a protest song while we watch some really violent footage of a Roller Derby! The authorities that Palmer enlisted to ""write"" the scripts are experts like Stephen Sondheim (show music), Paul Oliver (blues), Derek Taylor (the Beatles) and Ian Whitcomb and Rudi Blesh (Ragtime).

So, despite some missteps and a visual quality that looks like a 16mm print it's the interviews and the live performance footage that Palmer captured (mixed with lots of newsreel and TV footage) that make this set special. Knowing of the few moments of nudity and violence which is included, I feel that a copy of this belongs in every school and public library to act as a visual and aural history course on both American and British pop culture for at least the first  of the 20th century.

It lost a ""star"", in my opinion, because of the film and sound quality but don't let that deter you from buying it. Nothing like this project will ever be attempted again, so this is the best we can hope for.

HIGHLY recommended!

8256787,4,B0014Z4OG6,"It is quite a musical roller-coaster ride (the image of one suchlike coming back onto the screen here and there in the video!) to see and to hear the entire British TV series, ""The Story of Popular Music"" (5 DVDs together in the container, in ""The Palmer's Classic Series"", the North American edition viewed being Isolde Films TPDVDBOX-1), most of which offers good image at a 4:3 screen ratio (expressed as 16:9 on the container), with infrequent exception. Actually, since the playing time per disc is not particularly long, it is possible to get through it more quickly than one might suspect at first glance.

The first evening spent with the set, I viewed and enjoyed immensely the first three DVDs in the set, comprising the introductory DVD and episodes one through nine on discs two and three. The range of pop and related styles there and throughout is so much broader than in many documentaries of this kind that the set never loses a single moment of interest. There is the usual inane sociological sort of commentary or focus on song texts that non-musically-trained commentators annoyingly natter on about at the expense of the music itself, but even that sort of thing is less heavy-handed, for the most part, than what so many thick-skulled American academics and other would-be specialists mouth off! (Such people really need to read Gunther Schuller's close, truly music-oriented two-volume historical examination of jazz, blues, swing, and such styles, although, of course, the series casts its net even wider than that among black styles); Schuller's is a really pathbreaking work unrivalled even since its initial volume came out so many decades ago (at a time when I was working for Gunther Schuller as one of the staff of the New England Conservatory of Music).

For example, that fashionable black liberation/identity dude, Leroi Jones (a.k.a. Amiri Baraka), is among those whose inanities are even more irrelevant, all the more marking him out as a ""faux-savant"", than those of some of the others heard speaking about the music. Baraka even makes a ludicrous comment, given the example that he chose to prove his point, about how catering to white taste degraded black music. The song and performance of it which he singles out is a good ""cover"" of the Platters' hit, ""Only You (Can Make My Dream True)"". That song is a wonderfully sophisticated and beautiful one, by any black or white standard, even if it does not conform to the jazz-blues/saloon-roadhouse-bordello/gospel model that Jones so esteems, The poor nincompoop, obviously, does not notice some of the soulfully refined detail to be heard in the rendition, the bass playing, for example, being very artful, but Leroy Jones has too much social theory clogging his head to perceive such musical subtleties! Black music is as varied in type, expression, and musical means as white music has been, in all of its own ebony and nearly infinite variety also is, and ""Only You"" is a song to which any ethnic group should be proud to lay claim.

Anyway this production is very enjoyable, despite such gaffs that occur along its course. Of course, the ""All You Need Is Love"" documentary is a very famous series which got loads of well-deserved attention when it came out. Not having had TV since 1962, I never had seen it previously, which makes discovering this 1976-1980 documentary gem so much later makes it all the more fun to view. The segment, to single out something among so many treasurable episodes, which is devoted, quite generously, to the variety show genres (music hall, vaudeville, burlesque, etc.) in the U.K., in France, and in the U. S. of A., is particularly fine, with much interesting footage included that apparently (some of it, anyway) had been little known or viewed previously.

The set gradually winds down, by the 4th and especially the 5th disc, in regard to continuity, production quality, and cohesion at these points, but I still enjoyed the last two discs immensely. There are, alas, more flaws in the commentary, but not enough to spoil things unduly most of the time. It was particularly outrageous to compare black gospel music to the wonder-bread white, icky, bloodless likes of Pat Boone, whose tepid music-making is in no way a fair comparison point with black gospel. (This is not even particularly to have in mind such other lily-white neo-evangelical crud as C.C.M., a.k.a. ""Christian rock"" and the at least equally lame Christian hootenanny, whiningly intoned dross that also constitutes another strand of C.C.M. slop!) For one thing, gospel music, black and white alike,  traditionally is a Fundamentalist and Pentecostal musical phenomenon, of the gospel-based Baptist, Wesleyan Methodist, and Pentecostal/Holiness sects in the inner city and in small towns of the South and Midwest. Boone has been part of what is called ""neo-evangelical"", white suburbanite, tamer-than-tame blas, less strict, often kitschy, middle-class Christianity.

There is a common thread, a strong, musical, and pervasive one, that is at the root of what genuinely constitutes traditional white gospel music as well as black gospel music. That, namely, is the repertory and practice of the singing and playing found in the Revivalist heritage of ""hot-gospelling"" Fundamentalists and Pentecostals. Both  whites and blacks share the same repertory of 19th century Revivalist hymns and gospel songs which, as the common starting point, one finds in the gospel music anthologies (and, to some extent, the shape-note hymnals of the mid- to late-19th centuries) of those religious movements. The most famous compiler of 19th century repertories (anthologies) of gospel music (hymns and gospel songs alike) was Ira D. Sankey. His publications have never gone out-of-print. I have vintage 19th century and reprint 20th century copies of these, as do many others who cherish this music. The content of such volumes still forms the backbone of gospel music, black and white alike, as heard in its genuine manifestations. That gospel music is RED HOT, neo-evangelical dross is NOT. The reason that I, for example, as a young fellow, could sing in  racially integrated white and black vocal quartets in gospel music, as I would do with another white boy and two young black dudes at the famous Baptist church (demolished in recent years, which made me sad to learn) in its heyday of gigantic gospel concerts with great celebrities involved as well as regular church-goers, black and white, is that the four of us were accustomed to singing the same thing, from a musical aspect: the kind of four-part harmony which traditional white and black gospel music share.

What makes the white and the black sound differ in how they perform gospel music is tonal quality, vocal and dialectic accents, and different degrees of rhythmic articulation and freedom within the beat. Otherwise, black and white gospel music, ""the real thing"", is the same, which is why black and whites could be singing together in that music. Leroy Jones rears his ""polically correct"", rather Marxist, and sociology-obsessed head again, to sow misunderstanding, making his contribution to obfuscate the real issues about black and white music, secular pop or religious. He is a musically-deprived, crazed ideologue who does not know so much  as he assumes about the substance of what he is ranting on about when it comes down to the music itself!

However, all of that is incidental to the enjoyment of so much of the really fine musical documentation and journalism that one finds in this series, which covers such wide ground and diverse styles that to discuss more (let alone all) of it surpasses the scope of a mere review. I love this series!",1504569600,,7702,5.0566929133858265

8256789,2,B0014Z4OG6,"This set was given to me as a gift by a friend who knows how much I love music and music history.
This is NOT a good set of DVDs.  It is NOT a proper documentation of the history of popular music.  It is extremely poorly edited, and the interviews are often misplaced, marginally coherent, and/or uninteresting.  The choice of music that was included, especially in the later episodes, is misguided at best.  In fact it is incredible how boring and tedious the producer managed to make one of my favorite decades of music during the last few episodes.  And watching the late Lester Bangs prove to the world what a miserable, unhappy mess he was just was not the least bit appealing to me.
So why have I given it a robust two-star rating?  There is some unique and historic footage included here, that I have never seen elsewhere.  I also am giving it some leniency, considering that it is 40 years old and produced in the pre-Ken Burns era, when documentary filmmaking was not yet elevated to the standards that we expect today.
All that being said, I managed to make it through every minute of the entire series because I tore my rotator cuff and it gave me something to watch while working on a stationary bike.  But really, the series ""Jazz"" by Ken Burns is infinitely superior.",1471392000,,1281,4.515151515151516
8256790,2,B0014Z4OG6,"I hate it when the companies who produce DVD sets of old TV broadcasts insist on cropping the picture in order to give the image a widescreen appearance.  The top and bottom of the picture, as originally broadcast, are missing (I still have an episode on VHS from an early 1980s PBS broadcast to compare). As I watched this set, I kept wanting to hit the zoom-out key. It's a nice show. They should've done it right.",1337990400,5,416,4.402597402597403
8256791,2,B0014Z4OG6,"If you can find a cheap 2nd hand set (I paid about $6 for mine) I recommend you buy and watch this long pre-punk documentary, which can be considered a piece of tv history itself. The 16 episode long series contains some gems like the interviews with Jerry Lee Lewis, Hoagy Carmichael, Jerry Wexler, Leroi Jones, Bo Diddley.
The first 4 episodes follow a straight chronological order and include enlightening comments by blues expert Paul Olivier.
I particularly found Lester Bangs interviews very funny. The guy had a true passion and nostalgia for 1960s music but, for what is shown on this series, he had no clue whatsoever of what was about to happen with the massive punk movement at the time this documentary was filmed. He keeps whinging about the lack of inspiration in contemporary music (we're talking mid 1970s here) and says rock'n'roll has given all it had to give. I find that hilarious to watch nowadays.
From the 10th episode on the series loses its track and becomes messy. Music styles are badly presented as in the R&B and Country sections (episodes 10 and 11). A good 20 minute of the Rock'n'roll episode (no. 13) is wasted with such performers as Cliff Richard, Pat Boone, Tommy Steele who are absolutely irrelevant to rock'n'roll history.
I found songs of war and protest (episode 12) one of the poorest music analysis I've ever come across, with military songs getting mixed with Irish folk music and Country Joe McDonald. Pointless and misleading.
I regret watching the last two episodes which are an absolute tragic description of the worst commercial music produced in the 70s. I get sick when I think that Palmer completely ignored Neil Young, but had the gutts to roll his film on utter trash like Gary Glitter and Helen Reddy.
The series doesn't pay any attention to fundamental artists such as Hank Williams, Ray Charles, Johnny Cash, Fats Domino and the New Orleans scene, James Brown and many more. Bob Dylan is hardly mentioned. A full -wasted- episode on the Beatles adds almost nothing to the glory of the Fab Four. No trace of soul music, psychedelic bands, girls groups, rockabilly, doo-wop, the west coast singer-songwriters, Van Morrison, the Band, not to mention the New York underground scene which is completely ignored (hence the total lack of attention to the punk phenomenon).
I don't want to sound too harsh. I admit it is a big effort that was done back then and that many scenes are very enjoyable like the links they try to find between Northern American and African music. However, I would also like to warn that ""All You Need is Love"" is a definitely not to be considered a guide to popular music history. Have fun spotting all the flaws!",1305590400,13,2689,4.772532188841201
8256792,3,B0014Z4OG6,"This DVD series left me with mixed opinions.

On one hand, the scope of topics and genres is impressive. I thoroughly enjoyed seeing interviews with musicians who were still alive and relevant at the time of this production (early 70's). I specifically liked the interviews with John Hammond, and some of the Tin Pan Alley composers, like Hoagy Carmichael. As the series moved closer to more contemporary genres, like Rock and Roll, it was interesting to see and hear what was thought of those genres nearer the time of the making of this series.

On the other hand, I was unsure as to what this series was suppose to be. If it was supposed to be an educational documentary, then it was inconsistent in its approach. It's one thing to present something just for the sake of presenting it, and another to explain it, analyze it, etc. I did learn a few things, and saw great footage, but historical and musical facts were few and far between.

I'm glad I watched the whole series, and it does have historical value, but one almost needs to know something about each genre to truly ""get it."" In other words, younger viewers with limited musical references will probably not know, nor truly appreciate, what they are watching. It was almost like watching somebody's home movies.

Maybe this is a British thing, but I remember three of the early segments dwelling on the relationship between early American music genres and burlesque shows. So much so, the producers included a stripper doing her thing, and showing everything - and I mean everything. If you plan on viewing these early segments with minors, you're advised to first screen them.

The series is obviously dated. After all, the interviewing styles and footage are nearly 40 years old.

Again, this series left me with mixed opinions. It was worth watching, but I didn't learn many new facts. If you're into history, pop culture, and pop music, the series is worth a look, but as a classroom teaching tool, it would have limited benefit.",1305331200,3,1996,4.771014492753623
8256793,5,B0014Z4OG6,"One of the reviewers here is under the misapprehension that popular music is *American Music*, but one of the beauties of this set is its wider perspective. The set is called All You Need is Love (a Beetles song), and in 1980 when the series finished I would guess the Beetles and the Rolling Stones, both of them English bands, were still the biggest names in popular music. It was never marketed as a documentary on American Music, and needn't apologise for not being focused on the US of A.

I watched the entire series on TV back in the late seventies and eighties, and all the great features identified by the other reviewers are there. The roots, the social history, the lines of stylistic evolution. It was made before globalisation kicked in, and it would be a good update for anyone who comes from a part of the world that wasn't originally exposed to what were the roots of much of our contemporary youth and pop culture. What rock-and-roll is beyond just the music is made crystal clear, and as far as I remember it does finish with punk and new wave, including footage of Patti Smith (an American performer who has no illusions about rock's and the USA's international debts).",1302739200,3,1188,4.60377358490566
8256794,5,B0014Z4OG6,"I shall preface this review by writing that I do not have the DVD set (yet) and that I have only seen one of the 17 episodes. Still, I give it five stars just for the episode on The Beatles. Back in the late 1970s when I was in my mid-teens living in New York, The Beatles episode was broadcast on television. My family was fortunate to have one of the first clunky videotape recorders, so I taped it. For years and years I watched that tape, to the point where I had the entire episode memorized, and I could speak the dialogue right along with it. I am sure I still remember it all. I have since misplaced that tape and had been saddened by its loss, up until I discovered that it is now on DVD. True, the cost is high, for me, especially when I am really only buying the set for that one hour-long episode, but hey, I am sure I will like the other 16 episodes...and even if I don't, its purchase will be well worth it, just to relive a moment in time when I was a carefree teenager.",1226448000,5,985,4.056410256410256
8256795,4,B0014Z4OG6,"This DVD set is of course not a complete history of popular music. Tony Palmer, however put in great effort and came very close to creating an historical document. Not complete, but with moments of brilliance none the less. Especially the episodes dealing with the earlier years of popular music were very revelatory to me.
What makes it a true gem is that he interviewed many musical icons not long before they died. This makes it not only a historical document, but also a testament to some of the icons that were elemental in the early years of popular music.
Is it a must see for everybody? Well, no. The last episode of this documentary aired in 1980, so there is no music included made in the last 28 years. This might deter some youngster. On the other hand, it may also introduce to music made for the sake of the music and not just for the sake of making stars and bucks.
I gave it for stars, because there are imperfections. Nevertheless this will be the only document ever that contains many of the key players in the development of popular music.",1215388800,9,1058,4.487046632124352
8256796,3,B0014Z4OG6,"I found this set overrated at best.  Although there is some interesting footage, much of it is woefully dated and, frankly, dull.  Have your remote handy to move through the segments where the director spends wwaaayyyy too much time.  You'll know 'em when you see 'em.  I will be hard-pressed to watch most of this set a second time.",1213142400,6,333,4.593220338983051
