My only complaint with this one is, the last episode of this DVD is continued on the next one, and guess what, there is no announced date as to when volume 3 will be released. So my advice is wait until they announce the next one or even wait until it is available or you will really have a cliff hanger.
Good news Central Park Media has announced on their internet site a Nov 4 pre-release date for retailers and a Dec 2 public release.  The cliff hanger may finally come to an end.",1025049600,,539,4.133333333333334

Patlabor didn't get the recognition it deserved in North American over other worthy series, because it was not very well promoted and badly represented as a ""mecha-action"" show. This couldn't be further from the truth of what this program had to offer.  The movies, while technically brilliant, were more about the ideas and less about what made the show so popluar overseas, namely storytelling and character development.  Shows such as Neon Genesis Evangelion and Dominion, even Love Hina can trace many of their thematic and character development roots back to this wonderful show where mecha takes a back seat to the world which Headgear (the creative group responsible for the show) creates. In a sense, it's real success was in part due to the believability which they lent to the whole giant robot genre by popluating it with regular people who happen to use large machines in everyday life.  The basic premise is at the end of the 20th century, newer more efficient construction methods needed to be developed, and robots were employed to fulfill this role. As a result, the number of crimes committed using these robots, or ""labors"", resulted in the need to create a special detatchment of the police force to deal with labor related crime.  This is the premise in which we are introduced to Tokyo's newest section of the Special Vehicles Department and their crew: a crazy mix of personalities.  Once you watch the show, there is bound to be at least one character you recognize from your own life, or maybe even yourself. From the regular folks who inhabit the Patlabor environment, to the cops, the construction workers, the media and their pets, everything is included and as the show comes to a close, it forms a wonderful symmetry which is rare on television.  The show is the perfect set-up for the more political and philosophical approach of the movies which has been criticized for being boring; but try the series, and you won't be dissapointed.  As far as I'm concerned, Patlabor was the last show that had anything interesting to offer with giant robots, and was the final word in the genre.",996796800,,2281,4.845758354755784
