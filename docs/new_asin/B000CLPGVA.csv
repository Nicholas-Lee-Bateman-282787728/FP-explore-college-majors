8099188,4,B000CLPGVA,"It's truly a pity that not all of the bonus features for ""Pocahontas"" were carried over from the Deluxe Laserdisc edition to the dvd and blu-ray releases. Although the 10th Year Anniversary edition had several of the Laserdisc features, it still lacked the audio commentary and several other featurettes with optional commentaries. And not to mention the essay by the crew! The blu ray release, however, completely skipped the missing featurettes and had the recurring ones on the ridiculous virtual vault! So the Laserdisc edition of ""Pocahontas"" is really something that is truly worth to still keeping. And if you don't have a laserdisc-player, it's worth the purchase.

The most important component that was never imported from the laserdisc was the Audio Commentary from directors Mike Gabriel and Eric Goldberg, as well as producer James Pentecost, screenwriter Carl Binder, art director Mike Giamo, songwriter Alan Menken and lyricist Stephen Schwartz. The Anniversary version had a new commentary that was recorded for the new version (which included the deleted love song ""If I Never Knew You""), but just featured the directors and the producer.
So you'll wonder, is the new commentary an replacement for the older? Yes and no. Surprisingly, the later commentary does have some fun facts which the former didn't have (as the inclusion of Michelle St. John, the live action reference model for Pocahontas crying while posing for the ""Farewell"" scene and other stuff). However, the problem with the latter one is that the directors really keeps it still at some places. It's obvious they've haven't seen their film in a while. The older commentary can be dry at some places as well, but is mostly informative, we'll learn some interesting details (that Pocahontas was supposed to have a younger brother named Pochins, deleted songs and information).

Even better is the essay for the movie, which is an optional commentary played during the featurettes of the fourth disc! All the same people who voiced the former commentary gives their thoughts here. It's a quite engaging and informative listen, learning some interesting facts.

The other featurettes that were never imported to the minor disc editions were the Pocahontas Animation Discovery Tour. For us who never grew up in the United States got never that opportunity to experience it. And while it's an obvious promotional campaign, it's still a peak for something that would've delighted any Disney fan who grew up in the 90's (as myself).

Otherwise, the supplemental discs has some production notes about the historical Pocahontas and the film itself. As well as storyboards, concept arts, featurettes about the characters and some deleted scenes with optional commentaries (including a shirtless Smith).

So this Laserdisc edition is truly a gold mine for any ""Pocahontas"" fan and something that is worth consider. Even ""Hunchback"" didn't have all the featurettes from the Laserdisc imported. So check it out ;)",1437868800,,2981,5.2280334728033475

8099190,5,B000CLPGVA,"Even if you own the 10th Anniversary DVD set, this is worth the purchase. Loads of extras not on the DVD and the books and animation material make this an essential purchase for any ""hardcore"" fan of the movie. Makes it worth going over to Ebay and getting a laserdisc player just to have all this additional material. They don't make box sets like this anymore kids, so get them while you still can. Originally retailed for $100 back in 1997 and a bargain at any price if you love this movie.",1185926400,2,493,4.369565217391305
8099191,5,B000CLPGVA,"Meeko, Flit and Percy, these the are names of the animal friends who get in and out of mischief, befriend each other and accompany Pocahontas in the vast panorama of pristine North America that is the setting for ""POCAHONTAS."" No Disney animated film would be complete without these familiar looking creatures and rightly so. These are films for the whole family, but POCAHONTAS was a notch above many of the animated films from Disney over the past two decades.

POCAHONTAS was a change-of-pace from the recent trend of animated films from Disney in 1995. This is one of my favorite Disney films and one of the best since the 1960s. It has substance and deals with real issues. We see the Native American Indians at peace and harmony with the land and nature. This is beautifully captured with the exceptional animation of vibrant green forests and flowing blue rivers. These scenes have a breath of fresh air about them that you can almost feel. When the European settlers arrive we know that it is only a matter of time before they begin to erode this paradise. The Europeans with closed minds did not realize how much they had to learn from the Indians and tried to impose their brand of civilization on them. Their brand of civilization is to subjugate or annihilate the ""savages"" and ravage the land.

We see the two cultures meet in one of the finest animated scenes ever presented by Disney. Captain John Smith and Pocahontas come face to face by a waterfall. Smith lowers his rifle, as Pocahontas stands erect and unafraid. Their eyes meet and he no longer sees a ""savage"" but a human being. Their eyes tell us that they immediately fall in love. As Pocahontas ""listens with her heart"" as Grandmother Willow has taught her they both communicate with each other. Soon their differences become apparent, but it is John Smith's ignorance revealed by inadvertently referring to Pocahontas as a ""savage"" that is the focus of the rift. He states that there is so much the ""savages"" can learn from the English. Pocahontas asks, ""If the savage one is me, how can there be so much that you don't know?"" During the ""Colors of the Wind"" sequence John Smith learns first hand the value and reverence of nature and that it should not be exploited out of mere human greed.

The message of POCAHONTAS is that European settlers leveled forests and imposed their own vision of a ""civilized"" society, whether or not it was welcome by the Native Americans. The corrupt Governor Ratcliffe is shown gleefully using cannons to level forests while his other men wield picks and axes in a mocking musical number. The brown piles of shoveled up earth stand in contrast to the majesty of the green untouched forest. When the settlers open fire on the Indians, they retaliate by capturing John Smith and prepare an execution for him. Only Pocahontas, who can empathize with both sides, can bring them to see their transgressions and teach them that violence only breeds violence.

The dramatic structure over which the film's message is delivered deals with her father's disapproval of the man she loves, because he belongs to a different race. The film thus takes on more significance as it deals with ethnic discriminations as well. Her father wants her to marry a member of the tribe, who she dislikes because ""he's so serious."" A similar theme is taken up in THE LITTLE MERMAID.

POCAHONTAS is based on legend, rooted in murky historical events. In real life, Pocahontas was about 13 when she first met John Smith. Smith claimed in his journals that Pocahontas saved his life. John Rolfe was the Englishman that she eventually married. She did indeed get to go to England (See POCAHONTAS II), where she was treated as a princess. She died in Europe, near 21 years of age.

What is particularly good about POCAHONTAS is the artistry of the animation. The virgin land of towering green forests, sparkling blue steams and rugged cliffs are drawn with a freedom and energy that posses real power and reverence. Very effective is the jutting rock that overlooks the landscape giving the entire film a feeling of sweep and grandeur. Anyone viewing the finale of this film can not help feel an emotional outburst as the ""colors of the wind"" blow past this precipice toward the horizon. I know I did. The image is unforgettable.

The songs by Alan Menken and Stephen Schwartz include one unrestrained emotionally charged standout, ""Colors of the Wind."" This is an unforgettable song that can be appreciated on so many levels. It is a consummate example of melody and lyrics that make you ""Listen With Your Heart.""

The Walt Disney POCAHONTAS Deluxe CAV Laser Disc Letterbox Edition 3-disc Set is outstanding for its content and incomparable nostalgia. It is indeed a true artistic product rich in feel and substance. The Special Edition of The Art of Pocahontas Book and the Artist's Portfolio showing the artistic evolution of the character is well worth having in your collection. There are also video extras such as ""The Making of Pocahontas"" and others plus audio commentary that are well done and encompass the entire spectrum of this film's original release. This is a real treasure.",1145836800,2,5167,4.823927765237021
