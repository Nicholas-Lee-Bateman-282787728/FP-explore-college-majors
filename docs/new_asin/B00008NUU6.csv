1854905,3,B00008NUU6,"I purchased this as a birthday gift for my granddaughter after seeing the Pinafore production on PBS.  Even though my granddaughter doesn't fully understand the story line, she loves to dance to the music.",1355270400,,205,5.029411764705882
1854906,5,B00008NUU6,"I watched this version of HMS Pinafore on PBS and thoroughly enjoyed it. Yes, the orchestration was ""modernized,"" yes, there were sight gags I'd never seen used before, and yes the staging was unique. But coming from a theater family, I'm always open to innovation, and having sung in G&S operettas myself, I don't think ""tradition"" needs to be rigid--this was a unique and clever performance, well sung and played for laughs--and it got a lot of them from me!",1352246400,,460,4.7625
1854907,2,B00008NUU6,"I've been a Gilbert & Sullivan fan all of my life (I'm 70 years old) and I've seen nearly all of the DVD versions of this opera.  My great-grandmother, Carrie W. Wilcox, performed in HMS Pinafore in 1889 (Little Buttercup).  This is the least appealing of the lot of them.  I think it was an honest effort but just not up to par.  The casting was poor, the set mediocre and the singing and music just not quite satisfactory.",1343952000,,424,4.329113924050633
1854908,1,B00008NUU6,"The Guthrie theater is renowned for innovation.  This production -- from conception to execution -- was just a bad idea.  Take the plot line and the melody, and then put it through a meat-grinder with arrangements and orchestrations straight out of Andrew Lloyd Weber.  What do you get?  Not a very appealing meal -- just a pile of mush.

The production values were fine, the casting and costumes fine.  But musically, it was just an abortion.  The dancing and ""acting"" could not have been more gay.  Well, let me be more specific here:  almost everyone who does Gilbert and Sullivan these days may be gay, and that's fine.  But this particular style, I'd just rather they were back in the closet.

All the cleverness and wit of G&S are just washed away here.  I'm sorry, this is just a POS that shouldn't have been made.",1328832000,5,821,4.586206896551724
1854909,1,B00008NUU6,"I have not seen this DVD, but watched the PBS television broadcast. I really wanted to turn it off at the end of Act One, but the interval was short, so I stayed till the bitter end. Oh dear. I didn't mind the re-orchestration as much as the deliberate alteration of virtually every tempo indication and note value. In the amount of time it took the arranger to trash Sullivan's score, he could have written something of his own. By comparison, Gilbert's book and lyrics were relatively untouched, and it's worth noting that none of the ""improvements"" got as big laughs as the author's original jokes. Some of the performers are quite capable, and some viewers might enjoy this for what it is, but is is NOT Gilbert and Sullivan's H.M.S. Pinafore.",1325462400,13,747,4.666666666666667
1854910,1,B00008NUU6,"What a total embarrassment to the ""institution"" of the Guthrie Theatre.  Didn't the Managing Director of the Company watch any of the rehearsals.  The only way I can describe this ""happening"" is to say that one is drawn in to it because it is so terrible.  You can't believe what is happening before your eyes.  Walk away for twenty minutes and come back to it.  It's even worse than before.

Having worked with The New Savoy Opera Company in Portland, OR and The Lamplighters in San Francisco, CA, I can honestly say that this in NOT Gilbert and Sullivan.

I don't know what it is; p'haps something Doctor Who brought back from an alternate universe",1325030400,9,650,4.6
1854911,5,B00008NUU6,"I thought this was delightful.  Very cleverly staged, great performances, and very well filmed (which is often an issue with musicals).  I agree that the subplot with Queen Victoria was unnecessary, as were the balloons, etc. at the end, but my overall reaction was ""gee, I wish I'd been able to see this performance in person.""  Perhaps not the thing for the hardcore Savoyard, but perfect for someone who loves G&S and innovative theatre.",1322438400,2,440,4.918918918918919
1854912,1,B00008NUU6,"This is by far the worst production of HMS Pinafore I have ever had the misfortune to see.  Simply put it is not Gilbert and Sullivan.  The genius of Gilbert has been destroyed by silly nonsense, sight gags, pratfalls, pants loosing and boob jokes, there is also a goofy added plot line with Dick Deadeye and Queen Victoria (who turns up at the end) and Sullivan's score is just about unrecognizable.  There are long (albeit well-performed) meaningless dance sequence inserted in the oddest places (the tap dance right at the dramatic climax of the 2nd act for example). In a nutshell, the core issue is simply one of respect - it is obvious that there was no respect for or trust in the original work of the team of Gilbert and Sullivan. I found this production to be - in words of Gilbert, which were cut from this production: ""Horrible, Horrible!""",1321315200,18,850,4.6158940397351
1854913,5,B00008NUU6,"This ""live"" performance, aired on Canadian TV around 1980, and its video presentation are nothing short of superb. Whoever thought that so much talent - and fun - could be gathered on one stage?
The video could have been even better with closed-captions, but otherwise is exemplary. Highly recommended to anyone, G & S fans or not!",1310688000,4,331,4.824561403508772

7985799,2,B00008NUU6,"This production is not the Gidon Saks production made famous by the wonderful Mikado performance at the Canadian Stratford not long ago. It is obvious that this production is probably 30-40 years earlier (just look at the pictures of Queen Elizabeth II in the special features) than the new production made by the Canadian Stratford. I made the mistake of thinking that,  because the cover of the DVD was so similar to the later Mikado, it was one of the wonderful productions made by Gidon Saks. Don't make the mistake I did. Although the production is charming, it is still the old static performances made famous by the Doyle Carte Opera Company. Wait for the gold; it will be worth it.",1476316800,,689,4.694214876033058

7985803,3,B00008NUU6,NOT AS GOOD AS THE AUSTRALIAN VERSION. WE WERE SURPRISED WITH THE RAVE REVIEWS FROM THE BRITISH PRESS.,1424476800,4,102,4.722222222222222
7985804,2,B00008NUU6,"Yes, I too watched this on PBS broadcast, and thoroughly agree with all the bad things every other reviewer says about it. I would NEVER be tempted to add it to my collection! The Corcoran exemplifies everything Gilbert did NOT want in a performer! At the same time, just for the sake of controversy, I remember a FEW things to justify giving it two stars instead of (if it were possibly) MINUS two. The Josephine did her second act scena and aria ""A simple sailor, lowly born"" quite well. The treatment of Cousin Hebe, now having a few lines, was interesting and potentially worth having been in a better production. I rather liked the Dick Deadeye, even if I absolutely LOATHED his being made a former lover of Queen Victoria! (How anti-Savoy spirit can you get?) And the Buttercup played a good part -- pity it was no character Gilbert and Sullivan ever created for any of their collaborations.",1423872000,,897,4.647798742138365
7985805,1,B00008NUU6,"Terrible musical arrangements badly played. One star for Little Buttercup Dick Deadeye and the enthusiastic dancing - they'll have to share, I couldn't give more than one star. Just dreadful - a travesty.",1382400000,2,204,5.212121212121212
7985806,1,B00008NUU6,"I'm glad we borrowed our library's copy of this as a preview before buying the DVD, because we only got into the second song before we gave up.  It's not Gilbert and Sullivan: those may be Gilbert's lyrics but certainly not Sullivan's music.  The music has been replaced by the most bog-standard, meaningless ""Broadway-style"" music instead.  Frankly, ""The Simpsons"" does faux-Broadway better and at least they're just kidding.  Yes, that means I'd rather watch Sideshow Bob's version than this even if murder was in the cards!

The only good point is that this is the only Pinafore DVD I've been able to find with subtitles/closed-captioning.  Someone really needs to do a faithful production of Pinafore with CC for those of us who have minor hearing impairment but can still detect terrible music when we're unfortunate enough to hear it.",1365811200,2,840,5.0071942446043165
7985807,5,B00008NUU6,"This is a very nice performance.  The singing and acting are excellent.  There are some cuts and changes in dialog, most of which work, but the deletion of one of the verses from Josephine's act two area is bothersome.",1361664000,3,218,4.564102564102564
