2349306,5,B000A1IMFY,"Look at these reviews mainly written by males. There are so Few all girl cast action movies. Probably can count them on one hand. Why such harsh reviews? I really liked it. Plenty of action. Tough girls who can hold their own. What's not to like. Cynthia Rothrock, I wish she had more fighting scenes. She is so accomplished. 5 time World black belt kung fu champion. Also won in weapons, She is like the girl Bruce Lee. Why wasn't she more famous? Probably another double standard.. Come on girls stand up for your own here. Don't let these fellas bash a rare girl film.",1413504000,21,571,4.447619047619048
2349307,4,B000A1IMFY,"Waaaaaaaay better than the 3rd installment of The Expendables!!! Personally, I think that franchise is just going down the drain. If Asylum Studios is smart, they'll produce sequels for Mercenaries. Now, on to Mercenaries. Overall I love it!! I give it an A- only because there were a couple of spots in the movie where I thought they could have had more action than dialog. The acting is a little cheesy but then again, these actresses have been in some movies on the big screen with bigger budgets. However, with all of the ladies swearing like sailors and truck drivers, that just makes it all up for me =)

Again, the action was non-stop and I'll give that a B-. My only complaint was when they were involved in the vehicle chase, it looked like the two jeeps were traveling at about 50 miles an hour. They did this scene old school and they probably drove the jeeps at slower speeds for safety reasons (not sure) but I have seen low budget movies with car chase scenes that actually looked like they were doing more than a 100 mph or so. They could have switched to green or blue screen for this action sequance just to make it look like they were going faster but it was good.

Storyline: I'll give that a B. Women as Mercenaries is a really interesting subject and if the US government has any government contractors with such a team, that would be really cool. I think that women have to work smarter to acheive their goals and accomplish the mission. I don't necessarily think women as mercenaries would go toe to toe and full bore all of the time (then again I have seen some women throwdown with the guys). Personally I think that they would sneak in and get out rather than try to engage in any uncessary wetworks, my opinion.

Special effects....now this is where I was really impressed with the special effects that they had created for this movie. Over the years, Asylum had really picked it up some in the computer department. Of course, you can tell it was done on a lower budget and smaller scale, however, they have made some improvements on this one and it's good!! Normally I'd give this category for them a C+ but I give this one a solid B.

I am a fan of The Asylum studios and out of all of the movies that they release this year, this one is definitely worth my money. I was not disappointed at all. Whether you buy the DVD or rent it online, check it out. It's definitely good movie with hot chicks with attitude!!!",1413331200,3,2441,4.417777777777777
2349308,2,B000A1IMFY,It is too bad I couldn't collect this on my shelf because it does not contains any English captioning. Low budget usually don't include them. :-/,1413331200,2,145,4.615384615384615
2349309,2,B000A1IMFY,"Why haven't we seen either a particularly gender-integrated version of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Expendables/dp/B002ZG999U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Expendables</a>&nbsp;or the long-promised all-women ""Expendabelles"" by now? It's absolutely nuts that the hated Asylum studios would beat Sylvester Stallone (or anyone else) to executing the idea, especially since they've given him almost four years head start. But no, even the recent second sequel in Stallone's supergroup trilogy features only a conciliatory role to a female performer, and now it's up to the makers of fake-out classics like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Abraham-Lincoln-vs-Zombies/dp/B007BS396G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Abraham Lincoln vs. Zombies</a>&nbsp;to finally put together a group of well-recognized, beautiful butt-kickers to supply the adrenaline. And the star cast they put together certainly isn't a bad one.

Zoe Bell: stuntwoman supreme who graduated to dramatic roles and brought her unmatched physicality with her. The real&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Xena/dp/B0007DA3VG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Xena</a>.
Kristanna Loken: model-turned-actress who defied convention by becoming a veteran of action television and the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/first-female-Terminator/dp/B001TK80C0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">first female Terminator</a>.
Vivica Fox: award-winning dramatic actress who earned her stripes by&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/beating-the-heck-out-of-Uma-Thurman/dp/B004SIP8OI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">beating the heck out of Uma Thurman</a>.
Brigitte Nielsen: beautiful Razzi queen and staple performer of the golden days of American action filmmaking. The ultimate evil diva.
Cynthia Rothrock: record-setting martial artist and Hong Kong action empress who later dominated the American B-movie circuit.

Looking at this lineup, our first complaint may be that as cool as all these stars look together, the list still isn't complete. Where's Sigourney Weaver? And Linda Hamilton? And Pam Grier? The first concession this ""all-woman action hero team"" makes is that, through and through, it's a low-budget ensemble. That's not to say that I don't think most of this cast oughtn't also appear in appear in a bigger-budgeted version of the movie, but it's conceivable that Weaver and the rest would sooner not be involved at all than star in such a cheapo movie.

And the second complaint about the film is that it sucks like a chest wound.

Maybe that's a little harsh, since ""Mercenaries"" is clearly not as bad as it could have been, but at best, it's a squandered opportunity and an example of why Asylum is not a beloved studio.

The story is very straight-forward: when the president's daughter (Tiffany Panhilason) is kidnapped by a female warlord (Nielsen,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Red-Sonja/dp/B0001Z37HM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Red Sonja</a>) in Central Asia, CIA director Mona (Rothrock,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Above-the-Law/dp/B000NVT0RK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Above the Law</a>) taps four imprisoned female specialists (the abovementioned women, plus Nicole Bilderback) to stage a rescue mission. There's potential here, but the screenplay by Edward DeRuiter is a mess of poorly-executed ideas and illogic. I enjoy some of the strange little touches, like the buttons made of plastic explosive, but then there are ideas that just don't pan out, like the contrived scene of Kristanna Loken taking a man's eye out by flicking a penny at him. Other, more important scenes provide no shortage of head-scratching, like when Zoe Bell's thought-dead body just happens to be left on top of an enemy truck that just happens to drive her to a place where she can recuperate. On occasion, the badness of some ideas is self-evident even in the film's context: after a bunch of imprisoned civilians are released by the mercenaries, they decide to arm them...which promptly leads them to being mown down by lead henchman Tim Abell (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Soldier-of-Fortune-Inc/dp/B00001U0NG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Soldier of Fortune, Inc</a>) and his machinegun. Simply said, this screenplay could have used an editor.

Equally disappointing is what little use the movie makes of most of its stars. Everybody here partakes in at least some of the action, but most of the time, it's not nearly enough. Zoe Bell's fans may be pleased for her good balance of dramatic scenes and adrenaline sequences, but devotees of almost all the other stars will be left wanting. A shootout here and a hand-to-hand tussle here do not make anybody stand out, woman or man. Nicole Bilderback, who may have been turned into a credible action heroine via this venture, is a comic relief character at best. The most disappointing of the bunch is Cynthia Rothrock, who's afforded one single fight scene with Vivica Fox that lasts less than ten seconds. The only person I felt was really made maximum use of was Brigitte Nielsen, who steals the show with the fury of her performance. No one will ever accuse her of not being enthusiastic, and these filmmakers appear too inexperienced to downplay the wilder parts of her acting: every over-projection and every goofy facial expression is showcased to its fullest extent, and I am quite happy about it.

Back to the action scenes. There's a lot of them, but they're not very good. I counted four shootouts and seven substantial hand-to-hand fights. The shootouts are flimsy and poorly-edited, and the fights tend to be slow motion displays of Zoe Bell whipping her hair around. A brawl featuring the very talented Morgan Benoit (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Forbidden-Kingdom/dp/B001BEK8GA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Forbidden Kingdom</a>) somehow completely misses its mark. Eventually, Bell manages at least one decent karate bout against a slew of attackers, though by the time it came around, I was so starved as to accept anything that hadn't been ridiculously over-edited. Why Cynthia Rothrock was hardly in on any of the brawls is anybody's guess. The action content clearly wasn't an afterthought, but it's just so bland that it left next to no impression on me.

If there's one thing that ""Mercenaries"" is good for, it's for taking that first stab at what could be a very cool concept. Even if this is intended as nothing more than a rip-off of Sly Stallone's idea, it's a valuable map of potential pitfalls for more talented filmmakers to consult. What I would like to do is send a copy of this movie to Millennium Films as a blueprint of how NOT to make ""Expendabelles."" Other than that, this one can collect dust on store shelves.",1412726400,2,7018,6.176049129989765

Ulrika (Nielsen) has just taken the President's daughter captive and is demanding for the US to recognize her as a Head of State or she will kill the daughter. The government has only one option, they must send in a team of mercenaries to rescue her. A team of women is picked and the mayhem begins. There isn't really a whole lot to say about this movie. This is an Expendables with women. That really tells you all you need to know. The dialog is cheesy and the acting isn't that good. The action sequences are OK but generic...like I said another version of Expendables. The movie was entertaining enough and I did stay with it and wasn't too bored but that's about all I have to say. Overall, a female version of The Expendables with roughly the same acting, dialog and plot. I give this a C+.",1412553600,2,924,4.377906976744186
2349311,2,B000A1IMFY,"Ulrika (Brigitte Nielsen) wants to be president of anarchy torn Tajikistan. In order to do this she kidnaps the President's daughter (Tiffany Panhilason) and demands the president eliminate her competition and make her president. After a series of bad plot point explanations, the only people who can rescue the daughter are women, and the only women they can come up with are in prison. They managed to assemble a team of four mercs, creating a female Expendables grindhouse, that is still Asylum grade. The women are quickly introduced by their unlikely rap sheets. They are Cassandra Clay (stunt double Zo Bell - Raze); Kat Morgan (Kristanna Loken - Blood Rayne); Raven (Vivica A. Fox- Kill Bill); and Mei-Lin Fong (Nicole Bilderback- Bring it On...Hey! Those Cheerleaders were tough!).

Along the way they are aided by a Yuffie Kisaragi type character (Obscure FF VII reference). Things don't go according to plan. Blah, blah, blah...look for a sequel, because if Asylum made ""Sharknado 2,"" quality films is not an issue.

It is Asylum and this is a ""B' list of Hollywood bad a** females. The dialogue is hokey by design as when Clay tells Lexi, they are ""doing bad things to bad people."" I missed any references to past films made by the actresses which would have been a plus to the dialogue. For some reason the action didn't grab me as much as it should have. The lack of character development subtracted from lines and scenes. Should have been better. They dropped the ball on this one. On the plus side, they didn't work for Eric Roberts.

Might work as a cheap rental.

2349313,5,B000A1IMFY,"I saw this movie when i was 17 in 1967 when it was titled 'The Mercenaries'and it blew me away! This is an extremely dark(no pun intended) and violent,for it's time(1967),movie. As the movie poster in it's day stated:""You don't kill for women.you don't kill for diamonds,you kill because you are paid for it"".This is Rod Taylor at his best, as the tough and violent captain who leads a team of crack mercenaries deep into the Congo, to retrieve $50 million worth of diamonds, and rescue people who are 'cut-off' from the outside world,where they have to deal with the blood-thirsty,violent and extremely efficient Simbas! There is a scene where Rod kills the other German mercenary in such a horrifying manner that it shocks the regular Congolonese army private who witnessed it to exclaim,""you kill,kill like that!""(Yes,i still remember that line! How can i forget!) Yet this classic is still not released on dvd! Hope it will be released soon so that this marvellous movie can be viewed and kept for eternity!",1234051200,,1011,4.883720930232558

Hired by the President of the African Congo, Captain Curry (Rod Taylor) is a mercenary who is instructed he has three days to journey three hundred miles upland on a special train, through rebel held territory, to rescue trapped Congo citizens. Actually that is the cover story. Truth is, he is sent to recover a cache of cut diamonds worth fifty million dollars. Opposing him is a fixed time schedule, United Nations air security forces and the ""Simbas"" an extremely lethal group of African soldiers, led by their merciless leader, Moses who's intent on bringing destruction to the country. Curry, has a couple of aids, namely Striker Blue Force, and Jim Brown who aptly plays Sergeant Ruffo an experienced and well educated Congo soldier and the ruthless, unpredictable ex-Nazi named Captain Henlein. (Peter Carsten) Veteran actor Kenneth More plays Dr. Wreid, as the group heads directly and literally into the Lion's mouth. With explosive action, and war torn conflicts, combined with raping, looting and nationwide destruction, this exciting human drama which includes, beautiful, Yvette Mimieux as Claire is played to the hilt. A superb film the likes of which has established this one as a true classic.",1151366400,10,1368,5.057522123893805
2349315,4,B000A1IMFY,"This is the 1968 film, ""Dark Of The Sun"", starring Rod Taylor. It's based on the actions of mercs in Africa in the '60s, and offers an action-packed, chest-thumping testosterone trip.

Taylor nails his role as the cynical, tough Captain Corry, a paid soldier who's able to take on all challenges...for a price. In this film, he and his sidekick Sgt. Ruffo, played ably by football legend Jim Brown, take a contract to travel deep into rebel territory to secure a fortune in diamonds and bring them back. Action ensues, and although it's not asa ""realistic"" as that of today's movies, it is nonetheless fun and entertaining. Yvette Mimieaux is also onhand to lend some female eye-candy and a romantic diversion for Taylor, although the modern tendency to have the female lead be TOO much of a ""softener"" for the hero is avoided, refreshingly.

This film is worth the extremely reasonable price, and has been long awaited by fans of the ""Merc Film"" subgenre. It would make an able companion for the other great ""Merc Movies""...""The Wild Geese"", ""The Dogs Of War"", and ""Ronin"". Recommended highly!",1128038400,13,1094,4.876344086021505

Plot holes, really unbelievable character reactions and general story lines, terrible special effects (I've never actually noticed gun shot flares looking bad before), topped off with god-awful timing and forced delivery of lines. Just for fun, someone decided to layer on some really unnecessary lines, such as ""Let's bring a PMS from hell on this place"", excessive use of ""bitch"", etc. Last but not least, you cannot tell me that these women are wearing full fledge make up with shiny lip gloss while in prison, let alone maintaining a perfect application of mascara while participating in shoot-outs.

The chreography is as bad as the acting as well. No Krav Maga, Karate, or anything resembling a self-defense class. A woman kills a man from 40 paces with a penny?

2349498,3,B000A1IMFY,"This is a fun little action film not meant to be taken seriously. Others reviewing this film seem to think it was meant to be a serious action film .While I would not go so far as to call it a parody of films like the Expendables The film is  directed by Christopher Douglas Olen Ray son of veteran film maker Fred Olen Ray (Hollywood Chainsaw Hookers) who does a good job of keeping Mercenaries on course. Starring a nice mix of current action stars and veterans from the past Mercenaries is a basic go and find the girl and bring her home film. Special Agent Mona (Cynthia Rothrock) must come up with a plan to recue the Presidents daughter from the clutches of Urika (Brigitte Nielsen )a would be leader current rebel/terrorist of a small soviet satellite country. With limited options its decided that a group of women with criminal pasts currently housed in various prisons will be linked together as a barnstorming group to penetrate Urika's defenses and get past Urika's forces led by her right hand man Grigori(Tim Abell) a sadistic brute. Drafted for the mission are demolitionist Mei-Lin ( Nicole Bilderback) ,ex Marine sharpshooter Kat (Kristanna Lokken) former government spy turned villain Raven (Vivica A Fox) and former Marine platoon leader Clay (Zoe Bell) Mona and Raven have a history and don't like each other but with a shot of freedom via a Presidential Pardon Raven and the other 3 agree to take on the mission. Of course it doesn't go smoothly, they lose their guide, pick up a teenage local,get betrayed by one of their own and have to still rescue the girl and get back home. Acting wise nobody embarrasses herself veterans Nielsen(51) and Rothrock (57) still look good and are believable though neither was ever a ""great"" actress. Fox(49) lives it up as bad girl Raven ,Bilderback (39)  who I was least familiar with is good as the wise gal Mei Lin who likes to blows things up. Zoe Bell (36) and Lokken (35) are still in their primes and both do well with their roles ,Bell and Lokken have done their fair share of genre films already and look to carry on the mantle from the Rothrocks of the cinema world.  So if you like female action stars and fun if sometimes silly films check out Mercenaries I think you'll like it I know I did.",1460160000,,2261,4.591584158415841

2349670,5,B000A1IMFY,"Let me start by saying that no car or building was hurt during this movie.  As a matter of fact, with all the shooting you never see a bullet hit either a car or building, a person yes.
 This is text book example of totally bad movie done on purpose { I hope this was on purpose} to be campy and let the viewer know to let belief go and let the fun roll. There is one scene in the early part of the movie that tells the viewer this is not serious. The President's daughter grabs a big knife and holds it to the neck of the female leader and as the scene goes on you notice the blade of the knife begins to bend in a 40 degree angle.
The dialogue is so bad  it is good for example, the hero answers the question of ""What will we do now?"" with ""We will go PMS all over this place!""
There is one strange thing about this movie.  You would think with four attractive women fighting one tall  gay blonde woman there would be nudity.  No there is no nudity whatever, a shot of a bra is all you get. I can't leave out Rothrock.  Rothrock was the first female karate bad ass movie star of the b movies in the 70s and 80s.  Here she is the handler of the four women,  But someone went to sleep when it came to her make up, with red streak hair and black eye shadow, I had a hard  time not laughing.

This is a campy movie with bad dialogue, fun action, and three crazy ladies.  It is not great, but it is never boring and always fun.",1450828800,,1424,3.923344947735192

2349739,3,B000A1IMFY,"In some ways this is like every other actin movie you've ever seen. The cliches are everywhere. The heroes are misfits in prison, one beat up a superior officer, one's a spy. ones a bomb tech, etc. The plot is n't too surprising either; president's daughter gets kidnapped by hostile regime and a crack squad of unconventional ""soldiers"" is recruited by the CIA to rescue her. There's even a ""now I'm really mad moment"". Plot-wise, script-wise and even character-wise there's not much new here and that's a shame.

What sets this apart is that the butt-kickers in this case are women. They do a good job with the limited material they have to work with. The action sequences look real enough even if in one case seem barely credible (how many bullets does it take an assassin to kill someone a few feet away). Zoe Bell and co. keep the action moving and add a refreshing spin on the action hero movie. I just wish they'd had a better plot and script to work with.

I thought this was some campy fun.  Exactly the kinda film I like to watch late at night on Netflix when I'm still awake and high on holiday cheer.  And despite the low budget, so-so acting, and cheesy script, I'd of given it 4 stars if there were any real lesbian scenes... because there are ladies here who would do some believable F/F scenes for sure, lol.  Nah.  Nothin' aside from one booby grab, girly jokes, and some serious invasion of personal space.  But these ladies are nice to look at... and not in a male-oriented, icky porn star way.  In fact, mostly they have issues with men and kick men booty, lol.  No sex or nudity here.

Occasionally it was pretty funny, and I'd watch it again just to ogle Kristanna Loken (from Terminator 3 & the L word) some more.  Yep.

So the daughter of the U.S. president is kidnapped by Ulrika, a tall, femme-butch warlord (Brigitte Nielsen) who hides her away in some former Soviet prison.  The CIA (headed by Cynthia Rothrock, known for her martial arts films) taps into some women's prison to put together a team of highly skilled fighters who will save the day.  In return they are offered a full pardon for their crimes if their mission is successful.

This team is led by Cassandra Clay whose power lies in her Ranger school/Delta force experience.  She is played by Zo Bell, a badass actress/stuntwoman known for her doubling stunt work for Lucy and Uma in Xena and Kill Bill.  She was pretty good and gets the most screen time.  Her crew also includes the 5'11"" Kat Morgan (Kristanna Loken), ex-Marine Corps and scout sniper.  Her height and beauty gave her some serious presence- she's an awesome looking action figure.  Then there is Raven (Vivica A. Fox, from Kill Bill) who is former CIA but turned on them for some assassin work.  Lastly there is Chinese Mei-Lin Fong (Nicole Bilderback, one of the adorably bitchy cheerleaders from Bring It On), whose expertise is in explosives and piloting.  I love it when delicate looking Asian women have a crazy badass side... she was hilarious when they gave her the opportunity to be.

A mostly interesting choice in cast for sure... if Michelle Rodriguez had been part of this crew... they'd of been perfect, in my opinion.  The kooky local girl who helps them had the potential to be pure comedy gold... she shoulda had a bigger and more developed role.  Brigitte Nielsen made for a cartoonishly fun looking villain but her acting and attempts at seducing Zo Bell were so hilariously bad, damn.  Cynthia Rothrock's performance is also cringe-worthy and I wish some of these actresses had been chosen for their acting ability and not some other skill.

If you're a fan of The Expendables... you'll definitely get the comparison.  The only thing they have over this film is a higher budget and fancier action scenes... their script and acting really isn't any better.  And still.  I'll trade this all-female cast for 68 yr old Sylvester Stallone and the rest of his geriatric crew any ole day.

Ya gotta have a taste for camp to appreciate this one.  It had the potential to be so much more.  But what do you expect from the studio who brought us Sharknado?!  I say enjoy it for what it is.  Still a fun ride.",1418774400,2,3221,4.612676056338028

The plot may be pure B-movie hokum, but the cast pulls it off with such ease, it is a delight to watch. One of the best movies The Asylum has ever released and that's mighty praise (especially coming from me) indeed.

She hires four mercs fresh from the prison blocks to go and rescue her. All have a promise of immunity and pardon when and if they return from this suicide mission.
Once dropped into Kazakhstan,the four amigos ambush a van which carries two ICBM heads and some gold. With that they bargain their way into the ""citadel"",the fortress where the Prez's daughter is being held. Nielson is the head of this rag tag group of bandits trying to take control of the Kazakhstan government. She and the mercs enter into a ""partnership"" ,which is just a ruse on the part of the mercs to gain her trust then snatch the prez's daughter when the opportunity presents itself. This they eventually do, but along the way one of the group,Fox,turns on them and joins Nielson and her group,which of course complicates things greatly.
Bell is forced away from the Citadel in their escape attempt, alone and badly wounded. When she finds a girl dumped on the roadside that the group on the way in had befriended,practically dead,this imbues her with the courage to go back and take down the rats nest. She makes her way back and indeed rescues her pals,rescues the P's daughter,and they hoof it to an airfield with  an awaiting military transport plane. They take off but Nielsen manages to get on board the open back and fight and shoot up the plane's inhabitants. After a struggle they subdue her and handcuff her to a sled filled with explosives. When Nielsen tries to shoot one of them,unbeknownst to her target,another pushes her and the sled out the back which just coincidentally happens to land on the Citadel! After a very short flight they crash land onto an airstrip and there to greet her is Rothrock and her aid. They take the prez's daughter into custody and the three mercs leave walking arm and arm into the sunset. After all Kazakhstan is just around the corner from L.A.right?
The fact that this is NOT Kazakhstan is brought painfully home in the last scene, where a VERY busy Los Angeles area freeway is seen in the background. And just how does a sled loaded with explosives land on the Citadel that they were supposedly flying away from? The extras/stuntmen they use look and act just like what they are. The best acting job of the bunch?.....surprisingly,Nielsen! Never thought I would ever say that but yes,she was awfully good as the baddy in this otherwise lame opus. She was followed in kind by Fox,Bell and Loken. Rothrock had to be the weakest of the bunch as the CIA rep. Trouble was her character needed to be one of the toughest,but there was no way I was buying her offering what so ever. The next weakest was Bilderback,whose stock in trade was making self deprecating remarks about her race. Sure a lot of blame has to go to the script writers. But a decent actor does the best he can with what he or she has.
Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 1:78:1 and is clear and crisp. Extras include commentary and a gag reel(far too short).
All in all this female send up of action movies falls flat on its ""Kazakhstan"" lovin' butt. Nielsen is surprisingly good as the head baddie,but the domino's fall rather quickly,acting wise,after her. With a terribly weak and lame script,this was thing was doomed to failure from the get go. It was obviously a low budget production,which unfortunately couldn't overcome its' weaknesses enough to put something decent onto film. 2 - 2 1/2 stars.",1415664000,,4004,4.734957020057307
2350035,3,B000A1IMFY,"This is a good movie for Zoe Bell fans she has the most screen time, On the other hand Cynthia Rothrock fans will be disappointed with her screen time although she does display some moves. Brigitte Nielsen is OK as the protoganist. The remaining actresses; Kristanna Loken, Vivica A. Fox and  Nicole Bilderback have their moments. The movie attempts to be like the Expendables but with a much smaller budget. Good escapisim a fun action movie not to be taken too seriously.",1415318400,27,473,4.7682926829268295

8072125,3,B000A1IMFY,"Well...you don't see something this bad that you have sympathy for and just can't bring yourself to hate it. I knew that this would not be 13 Hours but it was similar to seeing a car accident in progress: I could take my eyes off of it. I don't know where to start - continuity issues were the least of the problems while constant re-use of extras, poor effects and the only thing missing was William Shatner in the area of over the top acting. In fact, William Shatner would have been Shakespeare in comparison to this team of acting. Now while Bridgett and Cynthia were never known for the acting chops this was an experiment in how staying off camera would have been a great idea. So why did I watch it to the end - well it was free and who doesn't want to see women running around in tight fitting, leather BDUs shooting up people and blowing up things? The awful acting, terrible story, poor use of locations, and rubber knives were all contributing factors of seeing each spin, crash and burn of this multi-car accident.  And the dialogue...oh the horror. You'll be saying ""Did...did she really say that?"" While it's not so bad it's good, it is a good enough film if you have nothing to do and want to watch a mindless show that makes 1970s Charlie's Angels look like PBS' Masterpiece Theater. Now that I think of it, Bridgett and Sesame Street's Big Bird looked like they had the same costume and make-up artist.  Just saying...",1508371200,2,1435,4.473282442748092
