5382279,2,B00A6HL704,"I've been waiting for all the Twilight movies come out, just for buying them all in a really nice box set... As it shows in the picture of this product, it looks like a thick box set, so I thought the movies were coming in this pack with each individual case and cover, for my surprise its a single box with all the movies inside (only the discs)... So I didn't like cause it doesn't come with the covers of each movie, neither information about them in this pack! Btw, the digital copies don't come in this pack, its comes with a code to you get them on line!",1363564800,46,560,4.146788990825688
5382280,1,B00A6HL704,(that's the current price) - when you can get part 1 and 2 of the last movie for 20 bucks; and the three before that for 10 each?  Just stupid.,1363305600,11,143,3.7666666666666666
5382281,5,B00A6HL704,"Picked this up at Best Buy, where it is ""exclusive.""  The MSRP on this is $50, so I'm not sure why anyone would pay closer to $80 with shipping and all that.

It's just the movies, no special features or anything.  Comes in a convenient extra thick bluray case (standard height, thicker to accommodate the extra discs).

Clearly the sellers here are scalping a few copies.  If you can wait a week or two I'm sure Best Buy will have these restocked.  Also anticipating other ""versions"" of the complete Twilight saga to be released to other stores.  Find it hard to believe that Best Buy will get the ONLY box set to be released ever.",1362355200,92,632,4.443478260869565
5382282,5,B00A6HL704,"After looking online at all the options to own the complete collection, and deciding that I would opt to get the Blu-ray box set, I still felt nervous. I had read tons of reviews and looked at pictures of different versions of the set. Some people had errors on their disks or received a duplicate of the same movie in the set. Also one box looks like it was likely to rub the disks when removing or replacing the disk into the sleeve. I was so relieved that it was exactly what I had been hoping for. It took me about a month to have time to watch the whole series, but everything was perfect. I am thrilled with the quality of the films and the extras that were included. Its truly the ultimate collection!",1528934400,,708,4.2518518518518515
5382283,5,B00A6HL704,I was a big fan of the books and the movies and the blue-ray Forever editions was just the icing on the cake. All discs worked perfectly and am totally satisfied with this purchase...,1528588800,,183,4.411764705882353
5382284,1,B00A6HL704,"This advertises as a book set, but when I got mine it wasn't like the photos at all or even in a book set. I was really looking forward for this special collection bc my friend had it and bought it from here. If I knew it was going to be a floppy disk collection I wouldnt have bought it,",1528416000,,288,3.816666666666667
5382285,4,B00A6HL704,Pretty good set. I enjoyed it but my husband went to sleep. lol The book it came in was nice but the slips that hold the movies was terribly hard to get the movies out of and when I put them back I noticed they had scratches on them. Need to put them in something else or I'm afraid they won't last long.,1528243200,,304,3.8412698412698414

5382288,3,B00A6HL704,"So it was tough for me to decide on a rating for this DVD set.  I absolutely, positively loathe these movies.  I tried to sit through the first one and I think I ended up losing enough brain cells to the horrible acting than I did huffing paint.  It was like watching 2 cardboard boxes with faces painted on them acting.

That being said... the main reason I bought this was for my wife and her daughter and they absolutely loved them.  So I will split my rating.  If I could do 2.5 stars, I totally would.  The movies are terrible, the stories are worse, but the DVDs are of decent quality and they are still being watched to this day.",1527552000,,636,4.206611570247934
5382289,5,B00A6HL704,Omg i cant even say anything it is the cutest thing ever when i saw the package i was like ugh its small but when I opened it i fell inlove its like a tiny hard cover book with all the movies and more i 100% recomend it.,1527206400,,220,3.6041666666666665

5382292,1,B00A6HL704,"The product stars would be 0, if possible. I absolutely detested this sorry excuse for a box set! I thought this set would have been a lot more comprehensive. It's sad when you can buy them in other sets and/or individually and get more from them than this, which is what I recommend. Now, where to begin, some of the discs don't have menu screens and just play the movies automatically. That leaves out so many options for deleted scenes, commentary, music videos, etc. As for the ""Special Features"", I'm pretty sure I can find all of that online, in short, which all of them are (short), not very ""SPECIAL!"" Finally, The Twilight Forever Disc is just Edwards scenes, WTF!? I just watched ALL of the full length movies and now you want me to watch all his scenes again, and call that a ""special feature!?"" I'm now having to buy these movies again! I wanna cry!",1526515200,,861,4.490445859872612

The  ultraviolet codes did work though so Im hoping it will be better quality with them. The physical set of movies came in an awesome book-like box, very unique. The dvds skip a bit but not horrible, I think its due to the disks being hard to get out , you have to grab them with your fingers causing smudges.",1525564800,,458,4.088888888888889

5382311,4,B00A6HL704,"Movies themselves are good, the last one was surprisingly awesome, but I think that's just because of the end fight scene. The Box Set itself is a bit misleading in a way. The design is elegant an beautiful so I absolutely enjoy it. Except, overtime, and many removing then adding the movies back in, their slots create scratches since the holder has a fold on the bottom. Hard to explain but I still love the case. Only wish it didn't ruin the DVDs like it does.",1522281600,,463,4.395348837209302
5382312,1,B00A6HL704,"Two of the disks are damaged.  It took us a month plus to watch all of the DVDs.  My daughter was reading each book first and then allowed to watch the movie.  Two of the DVDs had damage so that they skipped the last 15 to 45 minutes of the movie.  The first one we wrote off, but last night we went to watch the last one and it did the same thing.

For the price I'd expect less to be honest and was happily surprised.  No issues with the quality of the images either.",1521417600,,411,4.075

5382317,4,B00A6HL704,"It would have been a 5-Star review for this item if the BREAKING DAWN - PART 2 disc would have played. I would have to send back the ENTIRE set in order to get a replacement for just the one defective disc. I simply ordered the single DVD of the one movie since that's all I HAD to have. I don't agree with the policy of not replacing a single defective disc since the replacement set might have had a different defective disc in it. While I understand Amazon not wanting to break up a set, it makes me question getting ANY set now in case 1 disc is bad. I LOVE TWILIGHT but HATE Amazon's replacement policy. Hopefully your set will have ALL discs be able to play! ~TCK~",1520726400,2,670,4.161538461538462

The movies themselves are in perfect condition. The cool thing about this set is that the disks are laid out as a book. The images are very pretty and crisp.

5382422,5,B00A6HL704,"I thought I would add to the good reviews on this product and help to debunk some of the claims in the bad ones.

I only tested the actual movie discs since I don't care too much about the special features but

All discs are in English
All discs play properly as far as I can tell {I only started each movie so I could make sure they worked and that I didn't have to return them}

So those two things seem to be the major parts of the bad reviews, on to a little bit else.

I love how the case looks like a book and the images are very pretty {Only missing Emmett as far as the pictures I believe} but I wish it was a bit easier to get the discs out a few of mine have finger prints now that I'll have to clean off later since I didn't realize you could hold the pouch like part open enough to pull the discs out with just your finger but if you know you can its easier, also its a little nerve wracking to push the discs back in sometimes they get stuck but I'm sure its not enough to damage the discs or case unless you are pulling them out all the time as many big fans are out there I highly doubt anyone is watching all the movies about 10 times a day.

But overall it is good just wish I would have notice the pulling out part faster so I didn't have to clean the discs.",1506556800,8,1276,3.854961832061069

5382546,1,B00A6HL704,"My son Jon and I spent a night in Forks on a week-long bicycle ride looping around the Olympics, and there was much talk in Forks about this film series. I had no great interest in watching this series, but then, curiosity killed the cat. It is a series of three episodes, the last episode dived into two parts. The movie is based on a series of books, written by Stephanie Meyer. The plot is easy to summarize. A girl (Bella Swan) moves from her mother in AZ to her father, who is a town sheriff in Forks, Washington. She is in her last year of high school, and needs to find friends. She first encounters a native Indian (Jacob Black), who is quite attracted to her. She also encounters another dude (Edward Cullen) who looks and acts more like a creep than anything else. The creep also has other family members attending the school who are just as creepy. Through a variety of events, Bella becomes attracted to the creep Edward as well as the Indian boy Jacob. Eventually, she discovers that Edward is actually a vampire with remarkable talents and doesnt age with time, and that Jacob is a werewolf, but worse, that the vampires and werewolves really don't get along too well together. Eventually, she totally falls in love with Eddie the vampire, partially because she fears growing old and thus would like to become a vampire herself. After many sub-events, she eventually marries Edward, has a baby from him which almost kills her, but is saved by becoming a vampire herself. Her baby though becomes imprinted to Jacob, making a crazy threesome.

There is just too many things wrong with this movie series to know where to start. First, this movie really doesnt have good acting, and how Kristin actually became famous by playing the lead role testifies to the desperation of the Hollywood audience. None of the acting was remarkable. The visuals were good, but not outstanding. Secondly, the storyline was just plain stupid. Too many things were inexplainable, or inconsistent. Why would a 107 year old vampire wish to place himself in a high school situation? Why would the vampire father masquerade as a doctor? Why would the vampire family move away in order to keep their identity concealed, only to return later for no good reason? Similar questions could be asked of the werewolves. Why would the lead female fall in love with a creep? Why didn't the female experience the problems of becoming a vampire and losing her soul, as she was warned? In both the vampire camps and the werewolf camps, there were bad vampires and good vampires, bad werewolves and good werewolves. Whats going on there?

My only explanation to this story is that the author really wrote with flight of thought, not even giving thought to what she previously wrote. Perhaps the books offer a better explanation? The mindset of the entire tale is with teenagers living in a solipsistic world of their all important selves. After all, high school is so great, and even 107 year old vampires would eagerly love to re-experience high school. So, my advice to anybody curious about this seriesdont waste your time. It isn't even good entertainment. There are too many other reasonable movies to watch to waste your time on the stupidity and poor acting of this series.",1494892800,,3253,4.745583038869258

5382700,4,B00A6HL704,"I bought this set from different seller on black friday but wanted to give some information on what was included. (I purchased the 10 disc blu ray set) It's a really good set and the only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the new moon disc was missing some of the features that were stated in the description and my set didn't come with the storybook that holds the discs.

I don't know if they've changed it recently but my discs were in a fold out type holder with pictures on the back. It did come with the outer double sided box with Edward and Bella on one side and Jacob on the other. It also came with ultraviolet codes but they said they expired in 2014. I went ahead and tried them anyways and luckily they still worked. The codes were only for the movies, not the special features.

All the movies look and sound great. In Breaking Dawn 2 the CGI is a little distracting in some scenes but overall the movies are clear and the colors really stand out and set the tone for each film. The special features are good to okay, but I really enjoyed the making of documentary on each movie. They have a ""jump to"" feature that just fast forwards to scenes of that character. I haven't listened to any of the audio commentaries yet but each movie does have one. I put a list below of everything that was on my discs and how long it was.

5382750,1,B00A6HL704,"Ah, Twilight. Mix together random elements of Anne Rice, Anita Blake and devout Mormonism, add some horribly wooden acting, and finish off with a story that spends more time on teen romance than vampire stuff.

This is the winning formula for the hit movie pentalogy ""Twilight Forever: The Complete Saga,"" five movies chronicling the overwrought romance of a creepy century-old vampire and a completely self-obsessed plank of wood. It's the stuff of a thousand teenage girls' fan-fiction fantasies, and somehow the plotlessness and tedium of Stephenie Meyer's original books are amplified by the conversion into cinema.

Our heroine is Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart), who is mopey and emo about having to move to the gloomy town of Forks... until she focuses like a laser on the local hot rich bad-boy, Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson). And after he saves her from a car, she figures out his secret: he's a vampire. A sparkling vampire. Who doesn't drink human blood, and belongs to a close-knit vampire ""family."" How cute and cozy.

But their budding relationship is thrown into turmoil when an evil vampire decides to hunt Bella, and draws her into a dangerous trap. Then things get even worse when Edward and his family depart Forks. So Bella starts doing dangerous sports that allow her to hear Edward's voice, when she isn't hanging out with hunky werewolf Jacob (Taylor Lautner). But a mistaken vision leads Edward to believe Bella is dead -- and soon HE might be if Bella doesn't stop him.

Of course, the werewolf and vampire vie for Bella's attentions, even as an old enemy attacks the vampires of Forks so it can get to Bella (who is apparently the center of the universe). But even the long-awaited marriage of Edward and Bella doesn't make things peaceful at last -- on their Brazilian honeymoon, they conceive a superpowerful, blood-drinking vampire baby. And of course, this brings the wrath of another angry vampire group down on them: the Volturi, law-enforcers of the vampire world.

""The Twilight Saga"" is a teenager's dream of vampire romance -- hot smoldering teen boys, magic powers, a swooning damsel who never does anything for herself, and clumsy references to classic literature. That fantasy element is what gives the story a lot of its appeal... and if those things don't appeal to you, then the story's flaws begin jutting out like so many broken bones.

Quite simply, the story is tedious and mostly predicated on teen romance -- ""Eclipse"" in particular has virtually no story except two boys feuding over Bella, while ""Breaking Dawn Part 1"" torturously covers every single detail about the wedding that nobody cares about (including several minutes of unfunny toasts). It's also hampered by some of the corniest romantic dialogue you can imagine (""I could never let go of you. I just couldn't live in a world where you didn't exist""), and many moments that succeed in being unintentionally funny (anytime the vampires run is pure comic gold).

I will give credit where it's due to many of the directors, who attempt to add action and drama to the story -- actual battle scenes, onscreen fights between vampires and werewolves -- but they're swimming against the tide. And for a series called a ""saga,"" it's remarkable how small and unimportant the story is -- everything boils down to teen melodrama in a small town, without even a real fight against the villains of the piece.

It also has fairly consistent -- consistently bad -- characters and acting. Kristen Stewart is only capable of one kind of performance -- a twitchy, awkward, lip-biting mumblefest -- and she gives a prime example of what she can (and can't) do in this story. Of course, it doesn't help that Bella is one of those characters who is only likable if a viewer identifies with her, and comes across as a conniving, gold-digging, self-important, sad-sack load otherwise. Even her magical ""best vampire ever"" transformation fails to make her seem like anything but a shallow, whiny burden.

Robert Pattinson does the best that he can with Edward Cullen, but he sometimes looks visibly pained by playing a a creepy stalked with some very odd sexual issues. Taylor Lautner likewise gives an awkward but earnest enough performance as the werewolf Jacob, and most of the other actors range from forgettable (Ashley Greene, Kellan Lutz, Jackson Rathbone) to likable enough that I wished I were seeing a movie about them instead (Nikki Reed, Billy Burke, and the utterly delightful Michael Sheen).

For teen daydreams, ""Twilight Forever: The Complete Saga"" is an effective story of brooding controlling vampire hotties. For anyone seeking a story with action, drama and interesting characters, look elsewhere.",1476921600,,4703,5.010243277848912

5382802,5,B00A6HL704,"I bought this set for myself.  I love these movies so much that I watch them once a year! The set includes Twilight, New Moon, Eclipse, Breaking Dawn Part 1 & 2.  It has extra discs with special features and has an extended edition.  I like to watch the extended edition once and a while and the bonus features are fun to watch also.  You can see what they took out and maybe wish they left in. There's not many movies that I will want to watch over and over so these movies are definitely worth the watch.  Normally I don't like the vampire story lines of movies but I absolutely love this one.  If you are in the mood for action and adventure coupled with love and loyalty then these are the movies for you. Each movie has an interesting story line so you don't get bored. My husband even watched them and he's not normally into these types of movies either. As the movie progresses you see how Bella's relationship with Edward and Jacob change.  The plots of each movie has twists and turns that keep you wanting more!

A bonus is that the case that the Blu Rays come in are like a storybook complete with pictures. (see below for a pictures)",1470441600,11,1145,4.293023255813954

5382805,1,B00A6HL704,"The movies are great. The extras are so-so. What made me rate it so low is that the packaging automatically scratches the discs anytime you take it out or put it back in. I consider myself somewhat of a dvd nazi in that I take the discs out, put them in the player, then put them directly back into the cases so that none of my dvds get scratches on them. This book-style sleeved format forces you to get fingerprints on them just to get a grip on the discs, then you have to painfully yank it out of the sleeve. When you put it back in the sleeve you have to push just to get in there. It's no wonder the cardboard scratches the discs so badly. One by one my discs are becoming completely unwatchable. HUGE waste of money!",1470009600,2,723,4.134751773049645

This is a movie set we already had, but had purchased as each one came out. Wanted to have the whole set in one box (takes up 1/3 of the space) and have them all on blu ray. The discs are set in a very nice book format inside so no worries of coming of the plastic thing in the center and getting scratched. The book is a very nice presentation. The extra discs are nice bonus material for the die hard fans. The movies also came with codes for Ultraviolet/Flixster which is awesome because then when I go visit my daughters, we can watch movies without me having to travel with them!",1454371200,,636,4.178861788617886

5382989,2,B00A6HL704,I wouldn't recommend this particular product purely because of the casing situation. It's a nice idea but I pulled the first DVD out and it already had small scratches due to the low grade cardboard it was surrounded by. It was also difficult to remove. And then you have to slide it back in which was also tedious being as I didn't want to damage it any further. I'll be buying seperate casings for the DVDs.,1453161600,,409,4.394736842105263

5383036,1,B00A6HL704,"Breaking Dawn Part 1 has a section that freezes my Bluray players. Breaking Dawn Part 2 will not load on any of my Bluray players. I was going to return but I got the set for $20 on a cyber sale. Instead I ordered BD Part 2 to replace the bad disc because it would cost more to get a refund and repurchase at the non-sale price.
I believe one issue is the discs are stored in a cardboard ""book"" and you must slide the discs in and out of the sleeve. To get them out you are forced to put fingerprints on the playing surface which can and will affect playability. The disc that does not play has a fine scratch across the entire surface that was either caused during the initial insertion at the factory or from the first time I removed the disc. I put the discs in more traditional storage containers (jewel cases).",1450051200,2,815,4.197452229299363

The only reason I didn't give this five stars is because of the poorly designed envelopes holding the disks - a big disappointment because I love the movies!  The envelopes are not roomy enough to allow easy removal of the disks.  It's difficult to remove and replace them without getting fingerprints on them or eventually scratching them with repeated use.  I placed each disk in a paper sleeve to protect them and then had to ""undo"" each envelope at the side in order to remove and replace the disks easily.  Of course now the album does not fit into the holding case!

5383101,3,B00A6HL704,"To start off, I'm not a huge Twilight fan at all, so perhaps this review maybe a little bias.

Let's start with the movie's Review:
Looking at the movies / story themselves, I feel that they totally contradict, and destroy the ""Vampire"". I mean where have you ever seen a ""Fairy Vampire""? If you can get over the massive disappointment of seeing these fairies glittering in the sun, the story itself is very much like most love stories. Two boys, falling in love with same girl and showing off who has the most testosterone. Nothing to really write home about... I really think had it been the ""Traditional"" vampire traits, I probably would of had a more positive outlook on the movies, because the vampire / werewolves to make an interesting and different love story.

As for the boxset / packaging:
Being a collector of movie boxsets, I have seen a number of really epic designs and boxset packing. This one, I would have to put down to being pretty average. The collection is nicely packed into a illustration booklet, which does look really nice, however, I don't like the ""Envelopes"" inside the book that the discs (Blu-Ray / DVD) are placed in. If you use this set a lot, the discs will be subject to scratching.

All-in-all not a bad set for the Twilight Fanatic, and a must for the collector's set.",1444262400,,1306,4.5965665236051505

While I agree with others that the booklet's 'slot' style for the disks is not ideal, the movie content is more than worth it.

5383194,5,B00A6HL704,"I was very pleased with this product. I believe I ordered it on July 10th and it arrived on July 15th, so I was very happy with the delivery time. The DVD's are contained in this adorable little picture book, and overall the entire set-up is very appealing to the eye. The ONLY flaw is that the discs are difficult to remove, especially since you don't want to risk hurting them, so just remember to be gentle. The quality (blue-ray) is absolutely amazing. Everything was high quality and high definition, I was very impressed.

The Twilight Forever Complete Saga comes with:
1. Twilight (Movie)
2. Twilight (Special Features)
3. New Moon (Movie)
4. New Moon Special Features
5. Eclipse (Movie/Special Features)
6. Breaking Dawn Part One
7. Breaking Dawn Part One (Special Features)
8. Breaking Dawn Part Two
9. Breaking Dawn Part Two (Special Features)
10. Twilight Forever (Special Features)

My product just arrived today, and I have only had the chance to watch/review Twilight, and Twilight (Special Features) both of them were amazing, I have never experienced Twilight in such high definition and clarity, I was very impressed. In addition the Special Features disc had about 10 segments, in which included behind the scenes, interviews, red carpet footage, and many other things. This is a great purchase! Worth every penny. If you're a Twi-Hard like me, and you want to gather every little piece of Twilight you can, I highly recommend starting with this great product. These movies did a great job of capturing the excellence the book provided in a more time-conservative way! They're great!

5383289,3,B00A6HL704,I was under the impression when I bought this set that it had all 5 extended movie versions but the only extended version was Breaking Dawn part 1. however I felt this was a beautifully boxed set and great for any Twilight fan but felt it would have been better and more complete with all extended versions of The Twilight Saga. so I caution you not to buy this if you want the extended versions you're better off buying The Twilight Saga triple feature with extended versions of Twilight new moon and eclipse. and buying Breaking Dawn 1 and 2 extended edition set.  since they obviously do not make a complete set with all 5 extended versions.,1429056000,,644,4.504273504273504

5383495,5,B00A6HL704,"So glad to have the whole Twilight Saga on Blu-ray. Picture quality and sound are excellent. My secret in dealing with the SUPER TIGHT cardboard disc holders is to use a microfiber cloth (like the one I use to clean my eye glasses) to grab the edge of the disc to remove it. This avoids getting finger prints on the disc. Once out and in my player, I use a letter opener to GENTLY check that the cardboard holder is as open as possible before putting the disc back in it. I don't try to enlarge or change the shape of the cardboard holder, I just try to ensure that it will hold the disc without scratching it. I use the microfiber cloth again when reinserting the disc. This process has kept disc scratches from happening with every cardboard holder type set I've purchased. So far so good.",1421884800,2,791,4.351351351351352

5383540,3,B00A6HL704,"So, I'll start by saying I'm a huge fan of Twilight. I've been looking for the movies with the extended scenes/director's cut included in the movie since I had seen them playing on TV. From what I read in the description of this product, I was under the impression that the deleted scenes would be included in the original movies, however, I was sadly mistaken. Though they are included, it isn't in the movies, they're included in the ""special features"" section which I find to be a huge waste. Sure, it's cool to see the deleted scenes, but what in the world am I paying $40+ for if I'm just watching them separately? I could just go on Youtube for that. Also, I must say I was pleasantly surprised by how detailed the packaging was, however, once again the product becomes impractical like others have said. The cardboard lining isn't a safe place to keep the DVD's simply because over time they will be scratched from being so incredibly difficult to get out of the packaging. I suggest using plastic slips or something of the sort to keep the discs from being scratched over time. All in all, I'm glad I have the movies but feel like I've been ripped off. If I knew I was just getting the regular movies without the deleted scenes included in them, I would have went to Target and purchased all of the movies for under $5 each. Anyways, I really hope others see this and think twice for what it's worth. Also, if anyone knows where I can actually purchase the real movies with the deleted scenes included in them that would be great. *Sighs*",1420761600,8,1546,4.48581560283688

5383560,3,B00A6HL704,"On the plus side, the packaging is decent (I haven't had the scratching of discs issue that some have.) I like that it takes up much less space than if all the discs were in their own cases. Also, there are tons of extra stuff on the ""extra stuff"" discs; interviews, deleted scenes, etc.

On the con side, the packaging is made in a way that it's hard to get the discs out. I can see how many have ended up scratching discs. Most likely out of rough handling from frustration. Also, really disappointed that only one of the movie discs contained an extended edition. I don't want to watch the regular movie and then dig through the extras disc for deleted scenes and have to piece it all together in my mind. (And the one extended edition.... Frankly, it wasn't extended very much.)

I got it when it was marked way, way down, so don't feel like I've been cheated/scammed. Had I paid the $40+ they're asking now, I'd be seriously ticked off, even with all the extras.",1420502400,,967,4.396648044692737

5383737,5,B00A6HL704,"The Twilight Saga took up much fame and popularity through 2008-2012. There was four books that were made into five films. Twilight, New Moon, Eclipse and Breaking Dawn which was split into two parts. Stephanie Meyer the author of the novels is known for many other popular works but not as popular as her werewolf, vampire, and human love story. The Twilight Saga contained three main but very different characters, a shadowy script, heart wrenching emotion and favoritism.
 The films contained three main characters, Bella Swan, Edward Cullen and Jacob Black. Bella is a very pale, slender, brown haired girl freshly new to the Forks Washington area where her father lives after her mother decided to travel. Bella is very clumsy, stubborn and always has a habit of biting her lower lip. Many would say her acting is strange and does not fit the part very well. However I beg to differ, I think she portrayed the new vulnerable girl very well.  Next is Edward Cullen, the even more pale but seen to be glowingly and sparkling in the sun beautiful. His hair always seems to be messy throughout all of the films but his appearance is confident, with his muscular body and sharp face features. Lastly is Jacob Black, the childhood long friend to Bella. Jacob has many dark features like his hair, skin and eyes most likely originating from his Native American background. He represented this hot headed character through his acting very well to go along with his dark features.
By the first film Twilight it is known that the entire Cullen family had something weird about them and that weird thing was that they were all vampires. Never getting any younger or older, time was stopped at the age they were bitten at. After Bella and Jacob spent much time together working on bikes and doing homework Jacob started to distance himself and Bella knew something was up. By the second film Eclipse, is was also evident that something strange had changed within Jacob and his Quileute tribe, Bella soon found out they are all werewolves. Meyer had the intent that vampires and werewolves were the two worst sworn enemies of the century. This obviously proposed much conflict between all three characters when in time Bella had fell in love with each Edward and Jacob for many different reasons.
The majority of the plot is romance filled with not knowing which side Bella will choose, to be a blood sucking vampire forever or run wild with the werewolves? The two men obviously fight hard physically and mentally to do whatever they can to have Bella on their side. Everyone I know that has watched the film has chosen a favorite side, either Team Jacob or Team Edward. The one spat I could pick with Meyer is how important of a character Jacob is and how much his screen time lacked. Personally, I had always loved Edward from the start and it was evident to me he was the lead male. Jacob was always coming in second and I felt he never got the fair chance to be as of importance. He was that one step behind Edward for every little thing such as having to forcefully kiss Bella when she didn't want to just to see if there was anything there. It was hard for any viewer to see Jacob at equal standards although in the last film Breaking Dawn Meyer starts to realize his importance and his very vital part in completing the saga.
Ultimately, the battle between human, vampire, and werewolf will forever live on. You can pick sides and have favorites but in the end Meyer created the Twilight Saga for all aged viewing entertainment to what she knew the audience would come to fall in love with.",1411603200,3,3590,4.651968503937008

The Saga embodies so many of the 21st century's social and political issues.  It reflects the pain so many are in, and offers hope.  Bella and Edward are what love is meant to be, and what society has forgotten.  It takes great strength to love the way Bella and Edward do.

The Beauty in each movie is diverse.  The beauty of Nature,of a small loving Community, of friendship, and of a Father's Love. Each movie is a monument to loyalty, sacrifice, courage, honor, and Irrevocable Love.

The films are shot, and the hype has passed. The Cast is moving on.  Even Stephenie is moving on.  Still the Saga gains more fans all the time.  This set is perfect for new fans, who want the entire Saga.",1410566400,,771,4.5144927536231885

5383792,5,B00A6HL704,"I love twilight and waited for a set like this one to be made. It's nice having everything in one spot in such a nice box, which I had no problem removing them from. I was hoping breaking dawn two would include the dance scene at the end of the film as I had seen at the theater. Maybe it's included in the extras. I've yet to watch the whole set.",1409356800,,347,3.9014084507042255

5383794,5,B00A6HL704,Thoroughly enjoyed & highly recommend the DVDs.  Some of the discs were very hard to remove from their sleeves which could definitely lead to damage.,1409356800,,149,4.96
5383795,5,B00A6HL704,"Great! I love that it looks like a book. While I agree with some others about the difficulty/impracticality of getting discs in and out of pkg, therefore scratching them being an issue, the collectible box/book is nice for display. Extra footage and music videos was a really nice addition. The 39.99 price tag is awesome. If you do have issues or worry discs will be scratched, I bought a 2.00 cd case at the dollar store, labeled it artistically as Twilight , and I display the nicely photographed box.
IF the cardboard material bothers you, look  for another set. Remember- if it were made of another material, that would drive the price way up. All in all I love my purchase!",1409270400,,679,4.6115702479338845

I am glad I waited and found this one here! They were sp creative in the way the movies were boxed and then booked together displaying each movie with it's own picture as if you were reading the books all over again.

I haven't watched all of the discs yet, but I'm really thrilled to have this collection at such an affordable price. Really, I'm super impressed. Anyone who enjoys this saga, or even just the first movie, this set is well worth every penny to have the complete saga in one convenient (and pretty) package.

5383927,3,B00A6HL704,"The loved 3 out of the 5 movies of this saga, but I must say I'm really disappointed and angry in the way it's packaged. It's hard to get the discs out and when you do they are scratched up from the struggle. If the box set cost $20 I'd be okay with the inevitable repurchasing of the discs, but we have to shell out some pretty hefty cash and 2 hours of bonus features isn't worth it when it comes down to it since who knows how long you will be able to enjoy it. Shame on the studio for this. Honestly purchase the dvds/blu ray separately in the long run you will be grateful for it even with less footage. Don't feel bad for not owning this since I highly doubt the studio feels bad for milking you out of your money.",1404345600,,720,4.006944444444445

I wanted a nice set for all of the films, rather than all the separate boxes, but the discs have to be pulled out and can get scratched by the back of the sleeve.  You can barely get your fingertips in to grab the top of the disc, and they just should have put some sort of material on the back so the discs wouldn't get messed up, or made the hole larger.  The photos are gorgeous, and I like having the set, but I'm so worried I'll scratch everything by just wanting to watch it...",1404086400,2,528,4.116504854368932

5383937,5,B00A6HL704,"I fell in love with the Twilight book series 5 years ago and frankly love the movie series just as much. It's great to see the special features, interviews and red carpet premiere coverage all in one set. There are 12 DVDs altogether--all 5 movies and ""making of"" documentaries for each movie. The ""behind-the-scenes"" documentaries are worth the price alone. It's truly breathtaking to find out the secrets behind the special effects. For example, how the producers worked out the special effects for Bella's dangerously failing health while pregnant with Renesmee is nothing short of miraculous. Anyone who watches these documentaries will appreciate how difficult it had been to bring the Twilight books to life. One thing that impressed me throughout the movies is how true to the book they all were. The songs for each movie were well chosen.",1403568000,,846,5.05
5383938,4,B00A6HL704,"I only have two complaints about this box set: 1) The discs are hard to get out of the book. The glue around the slots the dvds are supposed to slide out of comes apart fairly easily when you inevitably struggle to get the dvds out. I'm worried that this will lead to the discs getting scratched.
2) The UltraViolet digital copies that you can download have no option for closed captioning. However, you get get closed captioning from the discs or from streaming the movies online at the Flixster site.

There are tons of  great extras on the bonus dvds.",1403481600,,554,4.475247524752476
5383939,3,B00A6HL704,"I already had the first 3 movies on DVD but wanted the complete collection just to have. I'm by no means a die-hard twilight fan but I enjoyed the story enough and the later films are pretty good in the grand scheme of things. I'd say it's still worth it for the price I got it at ($40 for blu-ray) if you want to upgrade your DVD set to blu-ray or only have a few of the 5 movies. If you already have the complete collection, or are happy with your DVDs and have no need to upgrade to blu-ray, keep the set you have.

The special features are nothing new - as far as I can tell they're the same as the original movies except for a bonus disc with the ""Twilight Forever"" special features. There's a bit of new stuff but if you've watched all of the special features from all the films, there's a lot of repeat footage as well.

The set itself is nice but far from perfect. One side of the box as Edward and Bella, and the other focuses on Jacob. The photo album with the discs comes out of the bottom of the encasement rather than the side, so beware of this when you pull it off the shelf or when you first open it. It's also the height of a DVD case rather than standard blu-ray. The discs slide into the album pages, and while I have a few disc sets similar to this, this is the first one I've had a problem with. The discs are physically impossible to just slide out meaning I had to use my fingers to grip the disc and forcefully pull it out, leaving fingerprints all over it. My discs don't seem to be scratching as a result of this, but I do worry how long they can last in this type of packaging. You also get a digital copy of each movie, but these are only available via Ultraviolet and the associated apps. I have all of my digital movies on itunes and I'd prefer to keep it that way, so don't get too excited about the digital copy if you want it in your itunes library.",1403481600,,1882,4.056451612903226

The separation of content across the discs is great.

5383951,5,B00A6HL704,"It was a few months ago that I found out about the entire Twilight movie set being released in one package.  I love that it contains all 5 movies, as well as 7 additional DVD's just LOADED with extended/bonus content.  It seriously can't get any better than this.  :)

I have already begun the process of watching all 5 movies, so I intend to post my comments on each separate movie in future reviews.  I've always loved Kristen Stewart's acting, especially in the movie Snow White And The Huntsmen with ""Miss Monster"" (a.k.a. Charlize Theron).  She is truly a force to be reckoned with.

I also think it's great to be able to download all of the movies to your tablet, phone, etc.  So if you are a ""Twi-hard"" like myself, you cannot afford to miss out on this wonderful box set.  It's definitely worth the $40, and then some.  :)",1402531200,,830,4.437086092715232

You may argue if the movies itself are good or bad, but to have this version look and feel like a book, an the disks on each page, really, kudos for the people who imagined it, and the people that actually made it. On the down side, disks may get scratched if not treated REALLY carefully, since they're inside the pages of the book.

5384014,5,B00A6HL704,"I bought this set because of all the extras. I already have all the movies, some in special editions from previous releases, but it's so difficult and costly to have run to this store and that and buy this version because of this and what not. This has EVERY special effect and extra from EVERY version released. I'm also happy to have it because, when I purchased Breaking Dawn 2, I got ZERO special effects but I have them now. Also, the box is very beautiful. Love both sides, although, I admit, I'm not a Jacob fan, so the Edward Bella side is the one I leave in sight. The inside, the photo album case that holds the dvds is beautiful. The pictures are so pretty and each picture relates to the movie the pictures protect. All pics are iconic moments from the films, so it takes you to favorite moments when you flip for the dvd you want. The only downside I have to it, is that it's very difficult to get the dvd's out. You really have to give them a tug to get them out of the sleeves. Other than that, perfect!",1398297600,,1018,4.225641025641026

Edit: Oh, I just remembered, I have a perfectly good excuse, er, reason, for giving it 4 stars. Whoever designed the actual box enclosure just HAS to be a Twilight fan (read: stupid). They have the entire inner box fall out of the bottom of the outer box. So basically the outer box has a hole in the bottom so when you pick it up the whole inner box falls out. Very stupid design.

I immediately made the openings a bit bigger so that mine would not scratch.  However, this does mean they could fall out if not careful.  For the price it was so worth it though.  Even if I had owned one or two of the DVDs the price would have been unbeatable for the rest of them.  It is put together very nicely as well.

That is my own preference and it is because I have found letter box close-ups are lacking and the color (on my dvd anyway) is not constant with letter box.

5384074,4,B00A6HL704,"Caught bits and pieces during the endless marathons playing on various channels.  It seemed interesting and instead of searching for a rental, I just purchased the set.  The first 2 movies were pure fluff - okay, I am not into love stories especially teenage love stories.  The third was interesting, but the last two were well worth the purchase price.  I would recommend this and will watch the later ones again.

On a side note - Kristen Stewart is boring.",1395187200,,459,4.6875

I absolutely LOVE the packaging and everything, but my discs are already scratched just from taking them out of the sleeve D: The first disc I watched today froze for a millisecond close to the end. I really hope this doesn't happen to my other discs. I just don't know what to do...the set is beautiful, but I'm really upset that my discs are getting scratched which will probably lead to crappy playback. Also, is it just me or are other DVDs a little more resilient? I mean since when does a disc get all scripted from sliding against cardboard?",1394755200,,587,4.444444444444445

I love the black photobook design. You really relive the series by just going through the packaging. I don't find the discs hard to remove from the sleeves as some people have said. I got them out easily. You just gently squeeze the sides of the sleeve toward each other and it opens enough to remove the disc easily.",1394582400,,494,4.2105263157894735

5384091,5,B00A6HL704,"I tend to think of this ""Saga"" as being geared more to younger people; but, I have to admit I've really gotten hooked in to it (female, 46).  I've only viewed the first two movies prior to this purchase.  However, I've heard the remaining three are quite good as well.  I'm not sure how men feel about the series; but, think most woman like the romantic story line. But, there's a lot of action too; so, hopefully, these are more than just chick flicks.  There's great music and the vampires are very upscale and appealing (even the evil ones).  I paid $46.27 for the set ($39.96 + $2.49 shipping & $3.82 tax).  The set comes with 12 discs.  I can't verify that the disc are undamaged since I haven't viewed them yet; but, the product was extremely well packaged and the ""set"" has absolutely no signs of damage.  I paid $5.00 (+ $0.43 sales tax) each for single discs of the first two movies in the saga from a local retailer (big, ""hint"", ""hint"")  If my math skills don't fail me the 12 disc set ran me about $3.86 per disc.  One of the reasons that Amazon rules!  Shipping was super fast.  I received the set much earlier than expected.  I'm totally pleased with this purchase and hope other buyers will have the same experience.",1394496000,,1231,4.417777777777777

It makes it so easy to access which ever movie  or special features you want and is so easy to transport.,1393891200,,261,4.22
5384108,5,B00A6HL704,"I was honestly surprised that this box that was smaller than I assumed it would be. Now, what I mean by smaller is that I thought there would be more included, such as a book. Considering the money that this movie franchise has made I am shocked that the final movie box set was not more spectacular. Take a look at the ""breaking bad"" box set. Now that is a box set!
 That said, I am truly a ""twi hard"". I was excited from day one that I saw this on Amazon to order it, and receive it in the mail. I was unable to get it right away, so I had to wait a little while. The waiting made it that much sweeter.
 It was package beautifully. The packaging itself is small and compact. The coloring, pictures, the fonts, etc. Is beautiful.
 As for the movies themselves, well, I have seen each of them multiple times. I was happy to see every movie represented and each movie had 1 to 2 extra discs associated with it. Those discs had a lot of extra stuff on them that any Twilight  fan will love.
 When I first looked at the advertisement for the box set it looked as if there was a little booklet included. I was wrong. The DVD holder is what is a booklet. Each page is like a little envelope that holds the DVD/DVDs associated with each movie in the saga. And the pictures I saw were just the illustrations for each of the little envelopes that held the DVDs. Like I said for the movie making as much money as they did I am truly shocked that the DVD box set for the entire franchise was not more spectacular.
 Others may disagree with me and that is quite alright. But from talking to quite a few of my friends and fellow twilight junkies they agree that more should've been included for the fans that have made this franchise as a worldwide famous as it is and will be for many decades and generations to come.
 But if you're looking for just a review on the actual quality of the item, there is absolutely nothing wrong with it. The quality of the movies and the extra DVDs were phenomenal, high-quality recordings. The way they boxed it up was very presentable. Well worth the money. Despite my few small , but valid complaints, this is a thing that any true twilight fan would love to have in their collection.",1393804800,,2209,4.245238095238095

Whoever thought up the design to slide the disks unprotected inside a cardboard sleeve should be demoted. That is not a good idea for a dvd. The first set I received skipped so badly that minutes worth of the movie were just gone because of it. I sent it back and received a new one in only a few days. The second one worked great. I haven't watched any of the special features, but every movie played without hesitation or skipping so I am happy with that.",1392076800,,632,4.104838709677419

5384168,5,B00A6HL704,Before I ordered this box set I read almost all of the reviews and was a bit concerned about how to get the discs out of the sleeves without scratching or damaging them..When it came I gently started to pull a disc out and it was very snug..So I gently ran my fingernail around the top right edge of the sleeve and it separated so I was able to take out the disc..One of the sleeves opened all the way so I just used a bit of scotch tape to seal the edges and all is well. Yes I would have preferred if they made the sleeves a bit larger but I was glad I did not have a big problem with this set. The color on the first 3 discs is not so great the last 2 are better..but I don't mind they play ok and that works for me...So just 2 problems with this really good looking box set..They should have made the sleeves a little bit larger and made sure the color quality was better but all in all I am happy with this purchase...I think the way they packaged this box set is really neat...,1391817600,,983,3.9447236180904524

There is a lot of extras, but I do not know how it compares to extras on the individual blu rays. I do like the extended version of BD Part 1.

5384233,5,B00A6HL704,"I got hooked on this movie series when it was getting towards the original release of Breaking Dawn Part One. The series most of my friends told me at that time was en quote: ""A Chick Flick Series"". Maybe to a certain degree for young guys. Many older guys like myself appreciate the originality and the romance with the realistic aggressive action throughout this entire series. For me, the casting was perfect and the acting was the best collaboration of actors and actresses ensembled, plus top quality on the story. I did see them in order and I have not read the books. My daughter introduced me to this series and told me pretty much it was filmed extremely close to the books that she has and she has read them all. I saw the first film on a cable channel and when it was over, I wanted more. Fortunately my daughter had the next 2 films on discs and I watched them and was definitely hooked. The action is great. The romance is so good that you can almost feel it live through the TV screen. It was so hard waiting for the last chapter to come out in the movies.  It's nice to know that there are some ""Good Vampires"" out there who don't melt in the sunlight, and don't have to return to a coffin during the daytime. Now I'am sad the series is done. The last chapter was fantastic.  I'd sure would not mind if the author would write a new series of books to bring this team back together for more. It would not be money wasted. This total Blu-Ray set has it all with great pictures inside. You must be careful taking the discs in & out of the cardboard sleeves because eventually they will get scuffed. I took all the discs out and put them all in a separate store purchased case that holds all of them for easy access, which will keep this nice box in pristine condition. If you like romance with some mystery/suspense, plenty of action with great acting and a great story saga, you will not be disappointed with Twilight. Highly recommended. The discs quality is top grade. Thankyou.",1389571200,,1993,4.383783783783784
5384234,5,B00A6HL704,"My wife loves the Twilight movies, once we knew there would be 5 of them we decided to wait and purchase them as a set. The box and binder they come in is very nice. Art work and still on each page from the various films. While I would prefer a plastic jewel case to hold them all and prevent any damage to the disc's. I can say that the alternative they used is very sturdy and takes care of the discs just fine. I would put this up there with the Alien series boxed set in terms of quality.

Love that it includes all the digital copies as well. If you don't have them already this is a great set for the money.",1389571200,,613,3.943548387096774

Mom, Bryana, and I are team Edward! So as you can see, the books nor movies just appeal to the young.

It is made to look like a book but when you pull the disk out it catches and sometimes scratches the disk. Not to the point where they do not play but it does scratch the disk some.. I think we are going to remove the disk from the book and place them in protective containers.

But over all this is a great movie and neat way to keep the collection together.

However, a family member rec'vd her copy and I got to watch all of them.  Disappointed, once again - myself and 2 others.  Nothing new, we have seen all of it before and what a waste.  All the special features are the exact same as the ""2-disk Special Editions"" and the ""limited (mass produced) DVDs.  They are just packaged different.  As a fan, when I completed the first 4 books. I was so sad it was over.  I was addicted and loved finding new material to read up on (I found all the extras online and at Stephanie Meyer's website.)  I understand why the author has little interest in continuing the saga and she has stated she is on to other ideas and books.  Every now and again, they announce the pending release of ""something new"".  But it's always the same as before, just repackaged and more expensive.  Disappointment all the way around.

5384272,5,B00A6HL704,"Honestly I really didn't want all the extra behind the scene's stuff, but this was the best deal instead of buying them individually. The hole booklet package that holds the DVD's is kind of lame, and I'm not really feeling the paper/ pockets- I fell like it makes it to easy for the dvd's to be damaged. Besides that I enjoy having all the movies in one big collection and the options of extra footage(even though I won't be watching them anytime soon) I'm not some crazy Twilight fan but anyone who enjoys the books and movies will also enjoy the collection set.
Was it worth it? -Yea I guess...  just wish the packaging was a little bit more creative instead of paper pockets to hold the movies.",1388707200,,698,4.453125

I have to say I was actually surprised that the outer cover isn't flimsy and cheap feeling. It feels safe and secure. My only concern is that the discs are kind of hard to take out and you have to touch the bottom to pull them out. It's something I have to get used to I guess.

5384297,3,B00A6HL704,I got the set for my oldest daughter for Christmas and New Moon does not play at all. We contacted Amazon and they replaced it immediately but New Moon does not play in the replacement set either. It keeps saying there is not a signal. We have tried it in the computer as well as the DVD player.,1388448000,,295,4.103448275862069

Mostly the same things I have with my original DVD's.  I liked the special piece they did on the fans.  It was like taking a walk down my Twilight memory lane.  Overall,  the set is nice,  I am glad I got it,  but was kinda hoping for more.",1388361600,,376,3.92
5384314,5,B00A6HL704,"Okay - must have may be a bit strong, but it's definitely a must want.  I had all the movies on DVD or Blu-Ray already, but was drawn to the extras included in this set.  These may not have been Academy Award caliber films, but as a huge fan of the books, I enjoyed each and every one of the movies, and have been feeling a little withdrawal with no more films forthcoming.  This set is a nice addition to my collection.  I'm enjoying the extras, and the packaging of the set is top notch - possibly even display worthy for the hardcore Twi-Hard.",1388361600,,546,4.221153846153846

5384335,5,B00A6HL704,"My husband bought this collection for me as a b-day present and totally made my day (and perhaps year, lol)
It has a lot of extra content that I haven't been able to find anywhere else, but be prepared that some of the footage has leaked already, and I know that at least some of the deleted scenes I've seen on You Tube.

I love that all the CDs are in a small case that is designed as a book with great pictures of Edward and Bella (and Jacob, but I'm Team Edward, sorry). Excellent picture and sound quality.",1388275200,,511,4.161616161616162

5384349,4,B00A6HL704,"Bought this as a gift.

It is packaged really nicely in terms of presentation. The quality is very good--except for one detail. They tried to make it sort of like a ""photo album""--so the Blu-Ray discs slide in and out between some very think poster board material acting as disc sleeves/jackets; however, the ""sleeves"" are extremely tight making getting the discs in and out extremely difficult and I worry that over time this will ruin the Blu-Ray discs. So I'm going to have to buy some empty, multi- Blu-Ray disc cases to hold the 10 discs included in this box set.

Overall, if you're into the Twilight saga (I for one, am not), then as other reviewers have said, you will be happy with this.",1388188800,,696,4.56

She opened it Christmas morning, and started crying she was so happy! Safe to say I did a good job with this one. The box set quality was great, and very nicely packaged. There is a book with all the movies inside, including special features for each film. Girlfriend loves this box set!",1388102400,,420,4.397435897435898

5384354,2,B00A6HL704,"Horrid disappointment with the DVD quality.  If I pause and restart, the DVD starts playing 'behind the scene dialog'.  When the kids go to LaPush beach to surf, I paused and when I restarted the kids were all complaining about the weather !!??  Each DVD does the same thing.  I enjoyed the interviews.  So sad to pay this amount of money and receive defective product.",1388102400,,369,4.615384615384615

5384369,5,B00A6HL704,I was really late to catch up on this Twilight craze but once I got hooked off of the third movie Eclipse I had too see all the movies and I went out and brought the first  2 and now I have them all. I even have 2 sets of all the movies. But this one Twilight Forever is the best and I got it on sale.,1387929600,,301,3.4925373134328357
5384370,4,B00A6HL704,"I bought this around Thanksgiving when the set went under $40. Considering I only owned the 5th movie in BluRay, that's a smoking' deal. The downsides: reviewers are right that it is really difficult to get the films out of the ""book"" which is beautiful by the way. So I took their advice and removed the movies and placed them in a safer case. The extras were also a bit disappointing. What I, and I think most other fans want to see, is behind-the-scenes stuff, making of the movie, actors being filmed when scenes aren't going, how actors/film professionals set up for a scene etc. There was little to none of that. It was a lot of stuff I had never seen before, but nothing I was really excited about.",1387929600,,705,4.430769230769231
5384371,5,B00A6HL704,"This is such a nice set, it comes in sort of like a book, with all the DVD's together, so saves some space and looks sleek. The picture is good.

5384372,5,B00A6HL704,"If you like the series, this box set is a great keepsake.  I found, after watching all the movies, I really enjoyed looking at the extra DVD's with the behind the scenes displays and the interviews with the actors.  I'll admit that the first two movies really dwell on the teenage romance and heartbreak, which may be a little slow for adult viewers.  But the last three movies more than made up for the slow start (that really was more for character development).  I especially like the last movie and the amazing battle scene, which without spoiling the plot twist for those who haven't seen it, you need to watch for yourself.  I personally think it is a good value for the price I paid.",1387929600,,690,4.488

The DVD's come in a beautifully designed box - and then the DVD's are enclosed in an album-type hard-cover book.  As you turn the hard-cover pages, there are some favorite movie scenes - with the DVD's in their own separate hard-cover ""page"".  Also included is a list of codes.

I almost didn't accept it from the post man. It was not well package for shipping and due to that, the cover box is screwed up either from it bouncing around in the package, or it was like that before it was shipped.

I don't remember seeing that mentioned in the listing but I could be wrong. I decided to get all the movies on blu-ray since I have them on DVD already. Can't wait to see how the quality is when I have time to sit down and watch them all. I'd say this is a definite must have for any huge Twilight fan.

It's a great collector set, but since I already owned all five movies... I was really looking forward to the special features.  There was not as much behind the scenes with the three main actors as I was hoping.  I wanted to see them joking around and messing up their lines.  There was little of that.  There weren't even many interviews by Pattinson, Stewart, or Lautner that were new for this disk set.  After 5 movies there must be so much gag reel kind of content... why couldn't they put more in?  Or more deleted scenes?  The longest bonus feature on the new disk was about the Twihards and FanFiction craze.  I didn't need to see that... I live it every day!  I wanted more of the joking around and conversation between the actors.  I felt like this was a tribute to Wick Godfrey. He dominated the bonus footage.  I got up from the couch happy with the purchase, but looking back I expected more.",1385769600,4,1055,4.348717948717948

I was really please by how fast I got the product as well. My one and only remark (the only reason I didn't give 5 stars) is that the digital copy of the movies you're supposed to get can only be accessed on American websites, which I can't get here in Ireland.

The only thing I liked was the album that holds the DVD's.  So if you already own the movies don't bother wasting your money.,1384041600,4,300,4.0508474576271185

In other words, the extras and the packaging are just not worth it.

I have all the Blu-rays already and bought this for the hyped-up extras.  Absolutely not worth it.  It's really only second-rate webcasts and fan stuff I wouldn't cross the street to get free, and star interviews conducted by dopes and non-professionals.  Embarrassing.  I guess I'm surprised Lionsgate put the thing out with this little meat on the bone.  I really shouldn't be surprised.  They're just milking the cash cow.

I won't buy any more Twilight stuff until they re-edit BD1 and BD2 into ONE movie with an hour of additional footage.  That I'd pay for.  Heck, I'd pay for ALL the movies edited with substantial dropped footage--not just deleted and extended scenes we already saw.

5384537,4,B00A6HL704,Having never owned any Twilight movie I waited and waited until I would find a box set that can do justice to the saga. I never thought I would fall for the Twilight mania but I guess I got sucked in also. My girl loves the box set I purchased for her. However the only downside is how difficult it is to remove a movie from the photo album. A few scratches are already visible without even watching the movie one. Luckily the bluray movies have more durable scratch proof than normal standard dvd's. I definitely will recommend this to anyone looking for a set that doesn't break the bank. You also get the movies on UltraViolet which is pretty cool. I gave it 4 stars since the movies are really difficult to  remove from the album.,1383782400,,734,4.357664233576642
5384538,5,B00A6HL704,"I LOVE HOW THIS SET IS PUT TOGETHER WITH THE EXCEPTION OF WORRYING ABOUT SCRATCHING THE DISCS WHEN TAKING OUT OF THE CARD BOARD BOOK IT'S IN. I WISH THEY WOULD HAVE MADE THAT A LITTLE DIFFERENT, BUT OVER WALL IT ROCKS! I LOVE HAVING THEM ALL TOGETHER AND THE BEAUTIFUL PICTURES!",1383782400,3,278,4.365384615384615
5384539,1,B00A6HL704,"I love the Twilight Saga and have seen each movie.  However the negative review is due to the false representation of this item on the Amazon page.  The product name ""Twilight Forever: The Complete Saga Box Set [DVD + Digital Copy + UltraViolet]"" would have you believe that there is a Digital Copy (one that would work with iTunes) AND an UltraViolet copy.  Unfortunately this only has the UltraViolet copy.  So please be very aware if you are considering to purchase this with hopes of using it on iTunes because it will not work.",1383696000,23,532,4.627659574468085
5384540,4,B00A6HL704,"Summit Entertainment releases what fans of sparkling vampires and shirtless werewolves have been waiting for since the day the last film was put in theaters - ""Twilight Forever: The Complete Saga."" Many will be sad that it is probably the last item we'll likely see from Stephenie Meyer's series of best-selling novels. Others will be ecstatic that they'll hopefully never have to see another piece of product from it again.

""Twilight Forever: The Complete Saga"" is a 10-disc collection that includes everything you could ever want in regards to the blockbuster film series. It's all encased in a cardboard slip-cover and housed in a hardback book holder. Every entry gets its own movie and special features disc except ""Eclipse,"" which only gets one with bonus material and the feature combined. There's also an extra disc filled with even more extras.

It would be literally impossible to list all the special features included in ""Twilight Forever: The Complete Saga."" Let's just say that if you love these films, you'll have days of material to sift through. Audio commentary, behind-the-scenes featurettes, music videos, and deleted and extended scenes are just the tip of the iceberg.

While most religious folks tend to frown upon the idea of a girl pining for a dead guy who drinks blood and wants to be a vampire, I tend to look at the positive aspects of the ""Twilight"" series. The films reflect strong moral values when it comes to the subjects of abstinence, dedication, family loyalty, and even hints of a pro-life message.

To give my two cents worth, I find ""Eclipse"" to be the strongest entry in the series. It has a good balance of the romantic and horror elements thanks to director David Slade. It's obvious that he was constantly trying to push the darkness and vampire / werewolf violence as far as he could in a teen-friendly PG-13 movie. This comes as no surprise since Slade headed up the extremely gory and satisfying ""30 Days of Night"" and obviously has a fondness for the undead.

To go over the high-definition transfers of each film would be redundant. The video and audio qualities are clean and clear. Whether you like them or not, the surround sound will pull you into the middle of the action, drama, and romance found in these movies.

""Twilight Forever: The Complete Saga"" will be pleasing to the people who it was designed for. Millions of teen and adult females will scream in delight at the sight of this exhaustive box set. There will even be a few guys like me who get excited. If you're looking for a way to collect all these movies and their special features in one simple package, you need not look any further.",1383696000,16,2655,4.786026200873362
5384541,5,B00A6HL704,"I bought the Blu-ray box set yesterday and was really impressed with the packaging.  The photo album style DVD case is really unique and visually appealing.  I am taking note of those warnings from other reviewers about scratching the discs when taking them in and out of the case. I have not previously purchased any of the Twilight movies because I wanted them all at once in a box set exactly the way this set comes so I am totally delighted with my purchase. I have watched the first two discs so far and was completely satisfied with the content of the ""special features"" of Twilight so I am confident the rest of the ""special features"" will be just as good. Although I have watched all of the movies at the theatre, it will be very nice to watch them back-to-back. Since I bought this set on its release date, the price I paid was very reasonable which makes the purchase that much sweeter.  Enjoy!",1383696000,2,904,4.466666666666667
5384542,5,B00A6HL704,"Even though I already have all the movies, this is a great way to have them all together.  And I like that they came with a digital copy code so they are always available on my computer.  The extras are great, I'm not even half through them yet. Don't care about the red carpet interviews, we have all seen them before but still others are a bonus.  Would recommend if you are truly a fan.",1383696000,,389,4.16
5384543,5,B00A6HL704,"Really excited about this one, there's a lot I love about this but I really love the digital copy's of it",1383609600,,105,4.0476190476190474
5384544,2,B00A6HL704,"I'm not a fan of this movie series, and since everyone has their own opinion of it, I'm not going to rate that aspect of it.

I bought this set for my mother, who really enjoys this series.
The packaging, although pretty, is not very good for the disks. We've already had a bit of a scratching issue just taking the disks out to make sure they were not damaged in transit.

The ""art book"" case also inserts into the box from the bottom, so you have to be careful and remember about that when you pick it up or the whole book falls out. I had that issue when I took the plastic wrap off, before I even realized it came out of the bottom.

If you get this I recommend buying some blank blu-ray cases to keep your disks in, and using the ""art book"" as just an art book.

I only give this two stars because it's a pretty good price for 5 movies on Blu-ray. Otherwise it would have had only one.",1383609600,3,890,4.0397727272727275
5384545,3,B00A6HL704,"I am a great fan of the series, but this set offered very little extra, if you had previously purchased the other DVD's with extras as they were available. To someone who has not previously owned or seen the DVD's with extras, this will be a goldmine. Disappointed in the actual ""extras"" that I had hoped made this set worth the price. Nice packaging. UV copies avalaible only through Flixster or Vudu, which is not ideal.",1383609600,,422,4.565789473684211
5384546,5,B00A6HL704,I collect any Twilight product due to the fact that I am hooked! The Box set is nice to have and having all the DVD' s in one place is great.,1383004800,2,141,3.5806451612903225
5384547,3,B00A6HL704,"This box set is okay but it has way too many special features to keep count, which might be fustrating for some people. Anyways all i care about is the movies. Time to let go and get on with your lives.",1382918400,,202,3.951219512195122
5384548,5,B00A6HL704,Omg this is so tempting to buy I don't care if I already have the movies I own three sets of the books the movie tie paperbacks and the hardcovers so I'll probably buy this it has so many features that mine current ones don't what can I say I'm a twihard,1382832000,3,254,3.9038461538461537
5384549,5,B00A6HL704,"Don't care what anyone says for this price (currently $44.99)!  I stupidly and previously bought all the BD Sets separately before this set came out and before, hunted down the best sets with extras over a year's time for my wife as a surpirse gift, she's a big twilight fan!  Even though i had the previous set and all the extras, i really love this set for the price!  Only 50 bucks?  Not bad, not bad at all considering how much was spent on the other sets.  She can either keep the older sets or sell them, doesn't matter to me.  Also, i did compare the older additional extras to the new extras and there's a lot of new stuff!  So when i saw this set with tons of new and old extras for only fifty bucks I couldn't pass it up!  Over 2 Hours of new material included:

5384554,4,B00A6HL704,"Twilight is about a teenage girl (Kristen Stewart) who risks everything when she falls in love with a vampire (Robert Pattinson). Twilight Forever: The Complete Saga encompasses all five films with almost 2 hours of brand new content (not to mention over 10 hours of bonuses containing every special feature ever released for the films). Twilight fans will love the deluxe treatment their franchise receives in this release. You also get an UltraViolet copy of each film (not compatible with iTunes). If you already own the films you should know the movies have not been remastered for this release but they still look and sound great. The new content is fairly average overall and somewhat repetitive so some fans may not want to upgrade if they already own the films.

If you don't yet own the movies on blu-ray, then this is probably the set you'll want to purchase.  If you do already own them, then you need to decide if an upgrade is worth it.  I'm not sure if it is, but below is a breakdown of exactly what's in this set (the most important of which is 2 hours of new Bonus Features) so you can decide for yourself.

The packaging is double-sided, with Edward/Bella on the front and Jacob on the back.  The blu-ray discs come housed inside an exclusive photo-album case (with the discs inserted into the pages rather than in normal blu-ray cases).  Unfortunately, while this type of book-style packaging is nice to look at, it has been known to scratch the discs - you'll want to be very careful removing the discs for viewing.

Other reviewers have stated that this was a limited time offer and it is completely sold out and this set will not be restocked. This is incorrect! The Best Buy website (last I looked) said item was on back order. I went to the local Best Buy store (in May 2013) and they had a ton of them.

This is a great deal (for $49.99 at Best Buy) if you don't care about marketing fluff, fancy packaging, and all the extras. You get 5 movies on 5 disks all in one double-thick Blu-ray case. These are not director's cuts. There are no bonus disks of special features. If all you want is the collection of 5 movies in one compact case this is the one to get.

***I don't use the digital copies, so I have no comment on them.",1369785600,22,905,4.130681818181818
5384570,1,B00A6HL704,"You can buy each movie separately with individual cases for almost half this price. Still on blue ray. Its about 70 bucks individually. I love having complete box sets, but when its 50 dollars more for all the same movies to just come in one Case VS 5 not worth it at all. Dont waste your money because the industry makes you think you'll be happier with 1 case VS 5 cases.",1368489600,5,373,4.194444444444445
5384571,3,B00A6HL704,"The movies were fine.  However, the quality of one of the discs (Breaking Dawn 2) just freezes in random places.  The only way to unfreeze it is to unplug my blue ray player.  No other discs before or since have this problem, so it has to be just this disc.  I've tried it 3 times, and it still doesn't work right.  The other issue is that no matter what settings I use, all of these movies are sized to about 4 inches of black frame around them, so they will not play full screen on my 42-inch flat screen.  Again, other movies play just fine.  I must say that I am disappointed in the quality.",1368489600,8,595,4.121739130434783
5384572,5,B00A6HL704,I brought the Twilight Saga cause I wanted the complete set. And I wasn't disappointed. I love these movies especially in the HD quality.,1368489600,4,137,4.75
5384573,1,B00A6HL704,"Nowhere in the description of this article, or on the outside of the packaging, did it mention that the DIGITAL COPIES would not be available outside of the 48 contiguous USA States.  This is an outrage!  I live in Puerto Rico, which is part of the USA (it is a USA territory), and the CINEMANOW site will not allow me to activate, or download, or any way to use, the Digital Copies THAT I PAID FOR as this collection cost me $112 USA Dollars.",1368057600,5,443,4.261904761904762
5384574,5,B00A6HL704,The Twilight Saga has never looked better.  The movies were well done; much like the book but not as detailed.  I received the disc in a very short time.  Thanks for excellent service.,1367452800,3,184,4.515151515151516
5384575,5,B00A6HL704,"Surprisingly, as an adult, I loved this series.  I do like sci-fi, among other genres so it was not a stretch but I thought it was more of a teen movie.  For an adult it gave a unique depiction of the fictional vampire, that I enjoyed.",1367107200,,235,4.086956521739131
5384576,5,B00A6HL704,"I admit it I love the movies and getting all of them on Blu-Ray for 89 bucks is great, of course it's not jam packed with extras and whatnot for the die hard Twihards but it's not that big of a deal (unless that's more your deal). They've got a few extras on there but nothing crazy.",1366070400,2,283,3.982456140350877

5384578,5,B00A6HL704,My husband is a HUGE fan of Twilight & doesn't care!! The first day Breaking Dawn part 2 came out he was already on the hunt for a box set that had all five movies. He was getting frustrated because no one anywhere had a box set yet & still today don't. So I looked around online for him & viola the ONLY place to have a box set!! We bought it & he loves it!!
