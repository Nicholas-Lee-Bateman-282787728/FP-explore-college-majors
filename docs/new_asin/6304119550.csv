7866469,5,6304119550,"I remember the good old days when Cabbage Patch dolls were the talk of the town, but now I can relive some of those yester-years with this VHS from Time-Life!!! Beenie, Biffy, Sourkraut and Kimchee! All of my favorite Cabbage Patch Kids all wrapped into one salad, I mean VHS tape! Was I willing to spend $99k for an old VHS tape, normally - NO WAY, but this is Cabbage we are talking about! Give me a bottle of Ranch dressing and it's a weekend to remember! True, I was thinking of waiting until the Patch Trilogy comes out in February, but I couldn't wait! Now, I can throw out all those old Blu-Ray discs and watch it in true 240 x 240 pixel VHS clarity! No longer will I have to put up with all those spoiled salad scenes, when they all become a blur in VHS!",1292889600,,762,4.155405405405405

There are always 2 ways to do everything. My 18 mo. old boy  loves the cabbage patch kids. The songs and their actions are adorable and  keep children and adults interested. It is not something we thought he  would like but one day they were on TV and by that night we had bought  ""The Clubhouse"" video. You will enjoy it!",946684800,,485,4.2967032967032965
