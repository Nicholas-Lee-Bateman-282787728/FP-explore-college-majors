4912803,4,B0060MYLNY,Still love the series. Just not as bright as the previous seasons. The story-line feels tired. Duchovny saves the show though.,1356220800,3,126,5.0476190476190474
4912804,5,B0060MYLNY,"I almost decided against buying this season because of the critical reviews on here...  then I realized I could buy an episode to stream and see what I thought.  I ended up buying them all!  This season is great!  I just love it!  The relationships between characters are some of the most real, riveting, challenging, honest, surprising, and keenly observed I've ever seen!  Duchovny delivers his unparallelled and constantly revelatory performance as Hank with all the skill and timing of a master.  The supporting characters are the punctuation that breathe infinite life into the story line.  Bravo!",1356134400,6,602,5.134020618556701

4912807,5,B0060MYLNY,"This show is so tantalizing, funny, naughty, and damn right ridiculous. Once again the writers have given the viewers a roller coaster ride of a a season, and boy what a climax in the last episode. I can't wait for season 6.",1355702400,10,224,4.357142857142857
4912808,3,B0060MYLNY,"CALIFORNICATION, for me, was initially a show about a bitter, desperate and damaged artist looking to regain his muse and the child they share whilst he made increasingly poor decisions in regards to sex, drugs and his career. Hank Moody felt like a true American original, or at least an original in terms of what American society has bred; a frustrated writer with one hit book turned into an abysmal Hollywood rom-com whose Peter Pan complex regarding women, sex, booze, drugs and generally irresponsible behavior is just barely trumped by his fairy-tale love for his beautiful and almost impossibly cool ""baby mama"" and their cherubic, wise-beyond-her-years daughter. The conceit of the show essentially is how he keeps trying against his nature to be a decent guy, a good father and a responsible human being, and that gives us a great and unique character with a lot of internal struggle going on. It also doesn't hurt that the show has a pretty astounding cast, with David Duchovny firmly holding the show together with his mix of humor, melancholy, and seductiveness. Each season has dealt with a new facet of Hank's continuing out-of-control spiral and how he either gets back in the good graces of his great love and his daughter, or loses even more control of the situation.

But with Season Five, the show seems to be running on auto-pilot as it continues to put Hank in increasingly absurd situations with new groups of people that will eventually be an outlet for his creativity and his sexual thirst.

This season shows the return of Hank back to Los Angeles after slightly over a two-year return back to New York as he begins to work in a psuedo-hack capacity as a writer for a lame action-comedy under the control of rapper-turned-actor Samurai Apocalypse (The RZA). Returning for action as well is Hank's muse Karen (Natascha McElhone), their daughter Becca (Madeline Martin), his agent/best friend Charlie Runkle (Evan Handler), Charlie's ex-wife Marcy (Pamela Adlon), and her new husband and movie producer Stu (the awesome Stephen Tobolowsky). Karen has gotten married to novelist Richard Bates (Jason Beghe) in this hiatus, Becca has started college and is dating a slightly older grad student and hipster tool Tyler (Scott Michael Foster), and Marcy has given birth to Charlie's baby. On the flight from NY to LA, Hank meets the beautiful Kali (Meagan Good) and there is that instant attraction that leads to something slightly physical on the flight. It is, naturally, later that Hank finds out that Kali is the girlfriend of the extraordinarily jealous Samurai Apocalypse. Then the situation becomes increasingly more insane as seemingly divergent roads all head on a collision course toward one another. Cop ride-alongs, falling off the wagon, professional discourtesy, rap culture posturing, the never-ending parade of women and the never-ending pummelling of Hank from his loved ones as they call out all of his flaws and as he continues to create situations he cannot extricate himself from.

Hank Moody is clearly a man who is less in love with the woman of his dreams and more in love with his charming, roguish, devil-may-care attitude about life and responsibility. He keeps trying to live up to the standards that others have set for him to be something more than he is, but it just seems to be more that what he truly wants. Aside from his obvious concern for Becca, Hank is a pretty unlikable but still strangely admirable human being; he's a being driven purely by the moment. He has no respect for the past and no regard for the future, and this is one of the reasons that I love this show. Having your main character be kind of repellant, despite his obvious charm, is a great idea to build an edgy post-modern comedy around, and the first few seasons were rife with dark and compelling moments for Hank that were very bracing and fascinatingly cruel. With this season, though, they literally seem to have run out of ways to tell that story, so the focus seems to be making Hank more likable and having his flaws seem more cute than compelling. The show therefore suffers because by making Hank a more likeable character, they lose part of the purpose of the show; to challenge you to like a very unlikable man and want to follow him on his adventures through the seedy underbelly of Los Angeles and the entertainment business.

Of course, the season still has some really strong comedic moments. Hank's quips are still razor-sharp, Charlie (with the help of Handler's giant infant visage) is the perpetual Charlie Brown of this show as he continually makes one poor decision after another, and Stu, as handled by Tobolowsky, is a joy to watch as the single greatest character actor schlub gets to play against type as a true power-player and a man of legendary endowment.

Sadly, it's the women who suffer the most in this season. Karen is the hot-and-cold-running ex who seems to be still very much in love with Hank one moment and then utterly repulsed by him the next. Becca similarly has the many of those character beats, but with slightly more gravitas, because Madeline Martin plays her so well. Marcy is so incredibly irritating in this season with her constant ascerbic commentary and seemingly no real concern for her child, which is a shame because Adlon is such a terrific performer. Meghan Good is fine as Kali, but doesn't get much time to shine here. The two women that make the biggest impact this season are guest stars Drea De Matteo as a stripper with little-to-no impulse control and Natalie Zea as Hank's psychotic ex.

This brings me to something else that has been kind of an issue from the beginning which is the arguable casual misogyny that takes place in this show. Los Angeles is either populated by literal or figurative whores; women who will do just about anything with anyone at any time. It's more likely that this is an unintentional result of the way that creator/showrunner Tom Kapinos wishes to tell Hank's story as well as presenting Los Angeles as a modern-day Sodom and Gommorah where debauchery runs rampant, but it seems much more evident in this season since none of the female characters seem to have any real confidence, power or control over their lives, unless it's sexual politics, and this is pretty troubling. Even though we're essentially done with the character of Mia, at least she had an interesting arc.

I guess the real question is if I disliked this season as much as I apparently do, why do I still give it an above-average rating? As a man, there's something about this show that still appeals to the adolescent in me, and I don't know if it's the constant cavalcade of casual nudity, filthy jokes, or wish-fulfillment fantasy, but it's something, and I still think that Hank Moody is a very special character, and I'm hoping that this next season will be more about character and less about events, because Season Five of CALIFORNICATION, while still somewhat appealing, is certainly its weakest.",1353196800,13,6997,4.855108877721943
4912809,5,B0060MYLNY,"I can't talk about this show enough. It's just genius. The dialog pacing is flawless and the humor timing is spot on.
Seriously, David Duchovny is Perfection! David Duchovny's delivery has the timing of a master comic actor and his portrayal of Hank is winning.

This show  has it all. It has made me laugh, cringe, smile, cry, and yes, best of all, kept me thinking about each episode long after the credits have rolled.
This is a David Duchovny showcase and he is iconic but Natacha (Karen), Madeleine Martin (Becca), Pamela Adlon (Marcy) and Evan Handler (Charlie Runkle) are AWESOME too. And I'm in love with Stu too.:) Season Five is my favorite because this show is getting better and better each season. I loved RZA (Samurai Apocalypse) and Megan Good. I've never laughed so hard.

The soundtrack is epic.

Lots  of gratuitous sex and drugs and rock and roll and hilarious situations. LOL",1352764800,22,895,4.748387096774193
4912810,5,B0060MYLNY,"This series is amazing, and show time gives it a new spin each season, keeping us on our toes on how this will all come together. I think this is one of the best series out right now and I hope it lasts as long as possible. I want to see a good story from the series, and I haven't lost any interest yet. Californication live strong...",1348012800,14,335,4.014925373134329
4912811,3,B0060MYLNY,"I love this show, but it is seriously time for it to end. Season 5 of ""Californication"" had its moments, but they were few and far between. Also, the final scene of the season annoyed me more than any episode ever has before (which is saying a lot). It's just like, seriously? What other ridiculous nonsense is going to happen to these poor people? Can't Hank and Karen enjoy a mere five minutes of happiness? Apparently not, because then I guess the producers figure then there'd be no show. UGH. It's so frustrating.

Prior to the season finale, I probably would have been generous and given this season a whopping four stars. There are some episodes that are much better than others, but I had many more laughs this season than I did in several seasons past. The major storylines of the season are as follows:

* Hank and Karen aren't together (obviously). In fact, Karen is married to another guy that fans will recognize from a past season of the show, and that character's antics are some of the best moments all season.

* Hank is screenwriting again, this time for a popular rap artist/wannabe movie star (and violent, crazy psychopath) named, ahem, SAMURAI APOCALYPSE. Just watch.

* Becca is head over heels in love with a total jerk named Tyler. Karen thinks all is fine and dandy but Hank can't stand the little punk (shocking, I'm sure).

* Marci is married to Stu after all, and she named her and Charlie's baby Stuart (gross!).

* Charlie steals the show this season, as usual...there is one especially hilarious moment that involves him in the backseat of Samurai's car. Best moment of the season by far.

* Another scene-stealer is Drea de Matteo, who guest stars in one episode and is an absolute riot. I wish she'd stuck around a bit longer.

So those are the highlights. If you've seen the other seasons of this show, you can pretty much fill in all the gaps. Hank is still sleeping with everything that moves. His constant shenanigans exasperate Karen and Becca. Becca struggles with loving her dad and being totally fed up with him. Charlie makes an ass of himself numerous times over. Near the end, you think Hank and Karen may finally have a chance together, but then a stupid, STUPID turn of events totally ruins everything at the end. So what will happen next season? Will Karen be upset at Hank? Will it tear them apart for the 763,934 time? Gee, I wonder.

Seriously, Showtime, come up with something more original for these characters, or let Season 6 be the final curtain.",1333324800,14,2502,4.62979683972912
4912837,5,B0060MYLNY,"I'm a published author of a memoir that covered my life up until my son's birth when I was 30 years old. I'm mentioning that fact because my life's story is very similar to Californication. The similarities are not exactly to the letter, but Hank and I share a whole lot in common. In fact, whenever I watch the show and my son (who's now 18) walks into the room he makes comments to me like, ""I know why you like this show. It's because you could have written it."" Or he'll say something like, ""God, they're so depraved. How can you watch this? Oh, right, it's as if you wrote it.""

My first husband was in a ""thrash metal"" band called ""Kaotic Kontortion."" We were in ""the scene"" a whole lot. We sold large quantities of certain products that artists (like those in the show) consume in large amounts. That husband's name was Jeff and his band was very close to being signed. They opened up for Pantera twice. They did a show in California with Tom Araya's (lead singer of Slayer) live-in girl friend's band. I don't recall the name of her band (too many substances consumed during that era of my life) but she new Jeff from High School and that's how his band got the gig. In fact, the band stayed at Araya's house while in CA doing the show.

I could go on and on, but this isn't the place to tell my life's story. Plus, I've already done so and that book is sold on this site, however, my last name was Imes when I wrote and published that book. Anyway, I love Californication because it reminds me of the part of my past that was filled with adventure, money, parties, lots and lots of music, concerts, parties and substances I no longer ingest. It reminds me of the time when doing all those things was still fun and it reminds me of the fact that if you don't stop to smell the roses - everything that's good or that you enjoy, even those you love, will be gone before you blink.",1484265600,,1886,4.26536312849162

Hank is ferociously funny, sexy and loveable despite his many flaws and indiscretions.  It's always a shame when things don't go his way because deep down, Hank has a big heart and loves Karen and Becca immensely, which is quite evident in Season 5.  I can't wait to see how this series ends - I hope Hank finally gets what he's wanted all along - to live with Karen & Becca as a real family unit.",1428364800,,531,4.135922330097087

I found (and find) her to be shallow, immature, and hypocritical.  I was really relieved last season when Hank's lawyer called her on some of it during his hearing.  Although Hank is most definitely flawed in a LOT of respects, I think Karen tends to use him as a convenient scapegoat for the choices SHE made, and the mistakes she seems to make over and over again.  She seems perfectly content to cast herself as Saint Karen the Long-Suffering.  I'm really saddened to see Becca following her mother's lead, especially after episode 7 and that breath-takingly cruel speech she gave to her father.  Hank just takes it, though, which I honestly think speaks volumes about his character, even though he obviously hides it behind a lot of jack-ass-ery.",1425427200,,924,4.7375

The show is becoming predictable. The writing in Ep 4 was amazing.  Loved it. But the character development is just not going anywhere. I am bored.  This is not Breaking Bad. Time to end. Don't keep beating the dead horse, please.  As much as I love this show for how it shows Venice and Santa Monica and the Culture... it's going to that whore-ish compromise-y place that the show mocks.  How ironic.  Y'all know it.  The black angle is just so lame too. It feels actually very childish and this show is not deep anymore.  I did love ep 4 as for the first time Hank was being the moral police which is a big change.

 This fifth season is a bit of a stretch.  The script writers simply recycled some the story lines; Sam Apoc is really just a rehashed version of Lou Ashby, but not nearly as coarse and textured, nor engaging.  Stu and Marcy's character arcs are just a way for Pamela Adlon to have any relevance.  It seemed almost like everyone connected to the show was just showing up for their paycheck while trying to wring out the last drop of profit even if it meant chafing their hands in the process.
 I will admit though that Tom Kapinos' writing still shines through in some spots.  Madeline Martin as Becca delivers several wonderful monologues despite her storyline also being aa tad overdone.

Hank remains to be everywhere at once and it seems that even on an innocent airplane ride he sits next to the the very chick that is the love lady of the guy that he has gone to California to write for, only Hank...
I have loved the entire series and my heart is always with ""the Hankster"" because no matter which way he turns there is always an adventure.

I admire and love him for the unconditional love that he always shows for his daughter, Becca, the love and hugs seem truly genuine.

Season 5 is a winner and all of the characters in the season are great and diversified, I also see faces from shows from other genres and it is great to see that they are still gainfully employed.

4915246,3,B0060MYLNY,"I think all fans can agree that Season 1 & 2 of Californication are by far the best. There was something more than
just sex & drunken debauchery. Like character development & intelligence lurking beneath stupid actions.
Season 3 was the nadir. The absurd school teacher plotline of Hank's affairs w/ stripper student, TA, & head of college all at the same time was idiotic. Then Rick Springfield & Kathleen Turner really made things worse. Season 4 was a bit better, & now Season 5 is about the same as 4. Except the sparkle is gone. The 2 - 3 years Hank was supposedly back in NYC are skipped over completely (& that might have added some fresh ideas). Instead, he goes right back to LA where everything is pretty much the same. This time-jump is handled in a sloppy manner, as if the producers just don't care.

How many more times do we have to see Charlie Runkle walk around bare-ass naked, or jerking-off to porn? How many times do we have to see him having sex w/ ridiculously beautiful women half his age? He would have to be a major movie director to pull that off, not just an agent w/ a nice house. Tom Kapinos has gotten into a rut like Judd Apatov with catch-phrases. The first time you hear ""man-gina"" it's kind of funny, but the 10th time, not so much. Rapper ""Samurai"" doesn't add much to the proceedings beyond a vague, stupid plot-device about Hank writing his ""Santa Monica Cop"" movie. Amazingly, it's actually a relief when Rob Lowe's character reappears toward end of the season. Marcy's marriage to Hollywood producer is boring, un-funny & sometimes just gross to observe...

I still watched the season because the Hank Moody character is still a funny screw-up. But you can predict everything, like the annual flashback episode to when they first moved to LA (but look exactly the same age).
I hope they end this series really soon, so we can remember the great writing, verbal jabs (& sex & debauchery) from the first two seasons. Maybe Hank could die having sex & then they give him a Viking funeral. Either that, or get Larry David to write the scripts.",1356998400,6,2078,4.568364611260054

4915249,4,B0060MYLNY,"First and foremost I must say that I watched this season, in its entirety, in one sitting, as people are won't to do in this modern age. That being said, I think this season was a season of new beginnings for Hank Moody. I loved the time passing between season 4 and season 5. I believe the Mia (sp?) arc had run its course (the fans of the show know what I'm talkin 'bout). My beloved series needed a revitalizing shot in the arm. However, I am a human being, and change is hard for me. So, not everything about this season was as charming as previous yearly installments. There are several moments that jar me, but not quite enough to disrupt my suspension of disbelief. Old side stories continue, but the new side stories (nanny and Kali, fo sho) did not charm me, to say the very least.
I will say that this season is not without its charm. The revisiting characters, themes, and tropes (oh my) are what keep me coming back. More Moody? Yes please.
(***Oh so minor spoiler) On a final note, this season like the previous seasons does not give Hank the happily ever after he claims to want so dearly. Instead, it gives him merely a glimpse of the house with the white picket fence. Oh well. There's always next year to see how deep the rabbit hole goes. Pour me another whiskey, bartender (top shelf, please).",1356480000,3,1312,4.403292181069959
4915250,2,B0060MYLNY,"It was the worst season yet. Tired and lazily written. Seasons 1 though 4 were edgy, funny and always seemed to have a creative direction.

This was chocked full of homie slang and thuggery, boring twists and lots of yawns.

Don't get me wrong... it had the potential for greatness when Hank got seated next to such a beautiful woman on the plane. Things could have progressed in a very different and interesting direction. But they didn't.

Later that day, they conveniently meet up at the thug rapper's mansion. ""Oh, you again?"" What a coincidence.

Yawn.

There are so many more story lines in which Hank's character could have been introduced to such a woman other than the tired ""watch out for my angry, jealous, gang banger, criminal boyfriend who hired you"". As if there aren't any other interesting black guy character types.

The ending was so terrible I couldn't believe I watched it completely.

Hey... it's just a show right? A premium show that I spent hard earned money to buy. I choose what I spend that money on and if Hollywood wants to keep getting that money... I'd recommend putting a little more thought and effort into this stuff.

4915251,4,B0060MYLNY,"I think this is an interesting show with very wild and sometimes funny storyline. I finally get the understanding of the title in this season. In my mind, it comes from the process of how a young couple feels California has made their lives more complicated and somewhat broken. I did not watch any of the series in real time I purchased all of it through Amazon and had selected due to popularity, so was able to watch a season in a sitting. It was sometimes unnecessarily very sexual with a lot of nudity. Sometimes the nudity is good, and sometimes seemed placed just to have the nudity. This season in particular the main charter played by David Duchovny starts to show more of his maturity and be more true to his values with an interesting twist at the end. I wonder if it will be continued next season.",1356480000,,809,4.436241610738255
4915252,3,B0060MYLNY,"A fun series still, but this season's scripts and story arc didn't captivate the attention as previous seasons had. If another season is in the works, I hope the series's freshness and pizzazz can be restored.",1356307200,,209,4.833333333333333
8490471,5,B0060MYLNY,"I love this show.  CALIFORNICATION comes as close as any show can get to an X-rating and still survive in the mainstream media.  It's a breath of fresh air inhabited by gorgeous women who love to show off their nakedness; and by the lucky men who just happen to be there to appreciate it all.  After  watching this show, it's torture going back to the frustration of watching ""normal"" censored TV shows.  And you soon realize that society has it ass-backwards, i.e. that the delightful world of CALIFORNICATION is the ""normal"" one.",1515542400,,531,4.728260869565218
8490472,4,B0060MYLNY,"Well I've made it to the fifth season of what I thought should be a 2-3 season show at best. And yes, some of the themes are getting thin, and the seemingly excessive ""raunch"" (to condense all the off-the-reservation elements) is... needlessly excessive. BUT, the writing, the scripts, the dialog is soooo good. And the authenticity of the relationship between Hank and Karen continues to amaze me. Those long, slowly played out, unplugged conversations they have with one another feels REAL. Like two real people really going through what these characters are going through.

And the theme that keeps getting pounded on, episode after episode, season after season -and is still working- is that poor Hank, no matter how good he tries to be, there's always another situation coming toward him that he just can't sidestep. He's like the old west prototypical gunslinger with a reputation. The guy will sit in the corner of the bar, minding his own business, yet trouble will come through the swinging doors right over to his table.

Poor Hank. I'd give anything to be him.",1506211200,,1071,4.911602209944752

8490475,5,B0060MYLNY,"Outstanding performance by David Duchovny and Evan Handler.  If you can ignore the graphic nudity and ubiquitous profanity, the script is very witty.  Hank Moody's story is a cautionary tale for those who are not willing to commit to a monogamous relationship or who think casual sex is harmless.",1490659200,,296,5.020408163265306
