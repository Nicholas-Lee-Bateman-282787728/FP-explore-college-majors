3803236,5,B001UNSZW6,"this is exactly what i was looking for.  four entire games, including the super bowl win.  no commercials, just every minute of the games.  the win against baltimore to win the division, the two playoff games and the super bowl.  every steelers fan will love this.",1246665600,3,264,4.673913043478261
3803237,2,B001UNSZW6,"I'm disappointed with this ""Super Bowl XLIII"" DVD set.  Sure, it contains four football games as advertised, but that's about all the good I can say about it.  In almost every way this set is inferior to the ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pittsburgh-Steelers-Road-to-Super-Bowl-XL-Post-Season-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B000FTCLTO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pittsburgh Steelers - Road to Super Bowl XL (Post-Season Collector's Edition)</a>"" DVD box set.

The video quality is quite similar and almost exact.  However, the video presentation seems quite rushed on the XLIII set, as if the on-field action was cut even shorter than the XL set.  (The DVD menus are ""flashier"" this time around, although you look at them for about three seconds.)

The XLIII audio track features the inferior television commentary as opposed to the superior radio commentary used for the XL set.  The XLIII set also uses an audio track that seems to have been mixed in a studio with a four-year-old child constantly pushing buttons.  The audio track is very uneven and distractingly so. (The crowd noise keeps rising and falling although nothing is happening on-screen and it occurs too often to be replays on the ""Jumbotron"".)  BOTH sets, XL and XLIII, feature English-only subtitles.  (But considering the target audience, I'm not surprised.)

The XLIII set is without any extras.  NO extras.  None.  Zilch.  Zip.  Nada.  This is a major disappointment.  The XL set had one documentary per disc.

The packaging is different and less eco-friendly.  However, I personally prefer the hard plastic XLIII packaging to the cardboard XL packaging for long-lasting presentation.

Here's the short version:

Super Bowl XL (40) set
VIDEO - DVD
AUDIO - Radio commentary
EXTRA - One documentary per disc
PACKG - Cardboard

Super Bowl XLIII (43) set
VIDEO - DVD
AUDIO - TV commentary
EXTRA - None
PACKG - Plastic

While I believe that the video quality of the XLIII set ""MAY"" be better due to the fact that a Blu-Ray version was produced, it's imperceptible on DVD.  I also believe the extras were cut to make room on the discs for this imaginary ""improved video quality"".  The audio commentary difference is one purely of preference and is obviously inferior to me.  The omitted extras are a disappointment.

Aside from having four more football games on DVD, this set is almost a WASTE OF MONEY.  (A DVR-version would be better, at least then I'd have the commercials.)  The XL set is far superior. Buy that.

3803238,4,B001UNSZW6,"As a long time Steeler fan, and an owner of the Road to XL dvd set, I was looking forward to getting this set. The quality of the dvd's is great. The video and sound is fantastic. If all you want is the same old, tired commentary of Al Micheals and John Madden, then by all means, buy this set. However, if you have a dvd recorder, you could have done just as well, except for editing of commercials, of course, but I kinda like them
If, however, you are like me, and were looking forward to hearing the Steelers radio announcers, as in the Road to XL set, you will be VERY DISAPPOINTED, as I am. While the quality, as I said earlier, is great, the decision to include NO BONUS MATERIAL...NONE!!!, is a MAJOR disappointment. If you didn't record the games, these are worth having, if you did record them, save your money.
I hope the NFL corrects this mistake soon and releases another set of discs soon. I am sending them a request, and my opinion of this set, tonight.",1244073600,12,969,4.300546448087432
3803239,3,B001UNSZW6,"Any Steelers fan already knows about the games, but one important note is that the announcers on these disks are the network guys rather than Tunch and Hillgrove. Don't know why they did that, it was the local guys on the Road to XL package.

If you get the Blue-ray version you can get Bill and Tunch on the Super Bowl broadcast, but that's it.",1244073600,2,345,4.3076923076923075
3803240,5,B001UNSZW6,"The first disc the NFL produced for this season teased us a little, but now we can watch the whole post-season + a great Baltimore-Pittsburgh late-season battle in high-definition.  Hopefully the NFL will be putting out their ""America's Game"" for Superbowl XLIII and that will be when the players tell more of the story of the whole season, these discs only have the games, but what FANTASTIC games they are!

The first disc has Game 15 of the regular season-a hard-fought Steelers-Ravens game for the AFC North title in Baltimore as well as the Divisional Playoff game where the Steelers face off against the Chargers.  The second disc has the absolutely brutal defensive fight for the AFC Championship-a grudge match of the Steelers vs. Ravens, followed by arguably the best superbowl, the Steelers vs. the Cardinals in Superbowl XLIII.  The under-respected and unexpectedly great Cardinals fight tooth & claw against the Steelers from start to stop.  The Steelers show why they are the #1 defense - watching Harrison's 100-yard interception return for a touchdown NEVER gets old.  The Pittsburgh offense puts together the most memorable finish (maybe the Giants from the year before could lay claim to an equally-impressive run) as they move from deep in their own territory to make a huge last minute drive ending with a Roethlisburger-Holmes reception in the corner of the endzone.

There aren't too many extras (in fact there's only two) but I was really excited to to see that they have an alternate audio track for the Superbowl featuring the WDVE broadcast.  So if you've ever enjoyed listening to the Pittsburgh guys calling the games, it might just warm your heart a little to hear the game called by the unashamedly partisan WDVE crew.  The only other special feature is a trivia track that pops up during the superbowl.  Watching these games in high-def is definitely an improvement and the Steelers look better and better each time I see these games.",1243900800,21,1964,4.960365853658536
3803241,5,B001UNSZW6,"I am a diehard Steelers fan through and through. For any Steeler fan this is a must have to your collection of Steeler DVDs. I went to the Steelers Sideline Stores which have it priced the same as Amazon for it. The DVD consists of....

Week 15 vs. Baltimore - Steelers clinch division
AFC Divisional Playoff - vs. San Diego
AFC Championship Playoff - vs. Baltimore
Super Bowl XLIII - vs. Arizona

This collection is a near perfect collection...what I don't like is

*You have 2/3 of the classic matchups with Baltimore this past season. EACH game was a classic. Why did they omit the Monday Night thriller against Baltimore? This series has done this before. For the Giants Road to XLII DVD which I have they added the Week 17 loss to the Patriots and the 4 playoff games so the 5th disc has happened and I would have added that game

*You have minor hesistations in the presentation of the Super Bowl and some minor skips in the other games but they are not big enough to complain about but you will notice them (esp. SB XLIII) but it should not disappoint

*There are no special features...which is terrible...what I loved about the Road to XL DVD was the featurettes about the Steelers, the Giants Road to XLII DVD for the Super Bowl had an option of Michael Strahan doing his commentary on the game..there are no Special Features on this DVD

What I like about this....

*Those Steeler fans that bought Road to XL remember the Steelers Radio Team of Bill Hillgrove, Tunch Ilkin, and Craig Wofley do the play by play well its not the case, you get the TV annoucers so you get John Madden's last game as an analyst, historic there. NFL Films started this with the Colts Road to XLI dvd

*These are the actual games...not NFL Films cutting material or NFL Films tapes like the ""Road to XXXIX - Patriots""

Overall - If you love the Steelers, if you love football, if you love John Madden this is an absolute must and for $25 - $30 you get to relive in my eyes 2 great games with the Week 15 Baltimore and Super Bowl, and two ok games in the AFC Championship (which you can relive the Troy Polamalu touchdown return) and San Diego game.",1243900800,18,2136,4.414758269720102
3803242,5,B001UNSZW6,"I'm a long time Steelers fan who happens to live less than a mile from McDaniel College in Westminster, MD where the Ravens hold their spring training. That being said, I think it's AWESOME that they included the week 15 game against the Ravens. I can't wait for this set to come out. I still occasionally watch the whole Road to XL set. I was wondering if this one would only have three discs, I couldn't have thought of a better game to add. The Ravens were a big surprise last year, nobody around here thought they'd win more than five or six games. I really enjoyed the watching them lose to the Steelers in the playoffs.",1243382400,2,625,4.35042735042735
3803243,5,B001UNSZW6,"I just looked at the zoomed in back cover of the regular 4 disc standard dvd edition and it will be full screen versions of the four games just like the road to Super Bowl XL from a few years ago.  They do not yet have the back cover of the blu-ray posted so hopefully this version will be the wide screen version for those like myself with wide screen TV's.  Also the back cover for the regular standard dvd states that the total run time is 448 min and not 240 min.  I am assuming that the Blu-ray will be closer to the 448 min mark than 240 min.

Some other notes to consider.  The newly posted front covers show that the Blu-ray will just be 2 discs with two games on each one since Blu-Rays can hold more information.  The standard edition will be 4 discs with one game on each disc.",1238198400,5,788,4.084415584415584

For the first time ever the NFL will release the original High Definition broadcast of Four Pittsburgh Steelers Games during this phenomenal run for their NFL Record Sixth Vince Lombardi trophy on Blu-Ray.

Warner Brothers has not yet announced what special features may be included with this set, but just to be able to get one of the Best Super Bowls ever played in High Definition is well worth it alone.

The fact that I am a huge Steelers Fan, only enhances my excitement for this Blu-Ray, but even if you were just a fan of football, to get a copy of the Most Watched Super Bowl of all times in High Definition, I think would be a wise investment.",1237334400,2,776,4.375

3803266,5,B001UNSZW6,"I have NO idea what some of these other reviewers are talking about, the picture quality of this Blu-Ray set is 3x that of the XL DVD set, which I also just recently bought. & I have numbers to prove this... Using the display feature on my PS3, this set's video files play at around 20 megabytes/ second. I kept the display up & watched the fluctuating numbers for a minute or so at different points during each game. The lowest I ever saw it dip was 17.4 mb/s. The highest was 30.1. Like I said, average usually hovered around 20. I popped in the XL DVD, 5-7 megabytes/ second. Numerically & visually... NO COMPARISON!!! The audio is identical on both sets: 2 channel stereo only, 48 khz, 224 kb/s. Sounded pretty decent, would've liked if at least the Blu-Ray was in 5.1 DD.

Again, the biggest difference for me was the picture quality. I should add, though, that tv size makes a huge difference. DVDs look good on smaller tvs & it'd be hard to discern the difference between a DVD & a Blu-Ray. However on larger tvs, DVDs look like s***, even when ""upscaled,"" which barely does anything, at least with the PS3 & a few other ""upscaling"" players I tried out before returning back to the store in the past. I watched the XL DVD on a 65"" Samsung using a Sony Blu-Ray player & HDMI. Looked very grainy & dated, even with the upconvert feature. Watched the XLIII Blu-Ray on a 60"" Sharp Aquos off a PS3 w/ HDMI, picture was phenomenal!!! I was very, very happy with just how good & sharp the picture quality was. Looked awesome!

& I was kinda shocked how good the CBS & NBC computer graphics were that they use to display the score, time remaining, etc. in the upper corner of the screen. If you've ever watched old baseball game footage or old NFL footage & you happen to catch a glimpse of the capability/ limits of the computer generated graphics they had back then, you'd instantly notice it & laugh. I was pretty impressed considering these games were from December 2008 & January 2009 - about 4 years ago. I felt like I was watching a live NFL game on tv. I guess little progress has been made with those types of things, but don't get me wrong, they look super-sharp & smooth. Guess we'll just have to wait & see what they come up with once the whole 4Kp thing gets rolling.

Who cares about the Pittsburgh radio guys not being on the audio... I actually prefer the original tv commentary from the actual games with Phil Sims, Jim Nantz, John Madden, & Al Michaels. I heard the Pittsburgh guys on the XL set, gotta say that I really enjoyed hearing them. I'm not from Pittsburgh, so I've never heard them before. But for this set, I like the CBS & NBC guys. I dunno, Jim Nantz & Phil Sims just have those classic NFL on CBS voices, legendary for me. THAT'S what I remember. & had I been living in Pittsburgh at the times of both the XL & XLIII eras, I still would've heard the CBS & NBC commentators on TV. IMO, the original game commentary is the best. The ultimate would've been if the sets included BOTH the original + the local Pittsburgh guys on a secondary audio track.

Whoever said this set is a waste of money is crazy! I got a pretty good deal on it & would've gladly paid double. Plus, a huge bonus of this set vs. the XL set is that these are ALL home games + the Tampa XLIII whereas the XL is 3 road games + the Detroit XL. There's nothing like being able to rewatch 3 games in Pittsburgh in HD in that psychotic madhouse. I like both sets, but the picture quality was just SOOO much better & HD caliber on this set & the fact that they're all home games - I have to give this one the nod.

Definitely a must-have for any Steelers fan & a 5/5, regardless of the absence of 5.1 sound & how they have to cut out a lot of the time in between plays, huddles, etc.",1392249600,,3777,4.247566063977747

You can relive all those moments you might not remember and is the perfect gift for any Steeler fans collection. The HD quality and sound is great too, making you feel like you are watching it Live again. The bonus features are great too. That years run was great, dominating San Diego at home in the snow, beating Baltimore at home to go to the Super Bowl when Troy sealed it with the interception, then the Harrison return before halftime of the Super Bowl, and of course the Holmes catch in the end zone to secure the Championship.

3803275,5,B001UNSZW6,"I am a huge Patriots fan but I also love watching other teams as well. I have gotten some other team championship DVDs including the great Road To XL dvd set.

Most reviewers have covered everything positive and negative already about this set.

The main issues are lack of features and the quality. While the quality is good it is kind of lacking a bit. The image quality could be improved a bit but I won't complain since I only paid $20 for the set and for that price, the quality is good enough.

There is something though that reviewers have not yet cleared up....the Aspect Ratio for the DVD version of this set. On this site it shows the set is in Full Screen with an aspect ratio of 1.33:1. That means people with Widescreen TV's will have black bars on the side of the screen. Even on the actual DVD case it says Standard Version.

Both this site and the DVD case are wrong. I have seen the first two discs so far and the games do in fact fill my entire 16:9 Widescreen TV. Which means the games are actually probably in the 1.78:1 Aspect Ratio which will fill an entire Widescreen TV without black bars or loss of picture.",1283558400,,1132,4.300469483568075

The only drawbacks are, as mentioned by other commenters, that there are no extras and they are broadcast with the TV commentators instead of the local guys.  Personally, I would have preferred the local announcers since I am not a big fan of Madden or some of the comments he made in the Superbowl (like saying Harrison should have been ejected- and this coming from a guy who used to coach the dirtiest team in the league, whose players would do things like clothes-line Lynn Swann in between plays [I wonder how often he called for his own players to be ""thrown out"" back then?]- end of rant).
