2190038,5,B0006O9M6S,"Wonderful performance from the Met Opera, with great staging by Moshinsky. Levine conducts well and both Pons and Ramey sing excellently. Guleghina sings off pitch a couple of times and has a wild time as Abigaille. On the whole a wonderful production on which the Met can stand proud",1109289600,8,284,4.816326530612245
2190039,5,B0006O9M6S,"I purchased this dvd on the very first day it is available. I really like the sets, they give you the feel of sacredness.

The highlight of this dvd is Verdi's most renowned chorus, ""Va, pensiero."" The chorus sing with smoothness, sadness and grace. This one is so brilliant that the audience couldn't help applauding.

Samuel Ramey is as great as always. I really like his Escamillo from Carmen, Filippo II from Don Carlo and am looking forward to viewing his Attila at La Scala. Maria Guleghina is also good, though uncomparable to Callas.

A big hand for Maestro Levine for his wonderful conducting.",1108944000,10,602,4.769230769230769

2190048,5,B0006O9M6S,"I saw this production on PBS many years ago and I liked it very much. I was surprised with the quality of this DVD since it was a production filmed before HD technology.
I had one performed by  Renato Bruson as Nabucco and Ghena Dimitrova as Abigaelle Nabucco before and if I have to compare both versions even though both have an outstanding cast this one has much better costumes and the overture which it is a very important part of this opera.
The singers and the chorus were very impressive and the wonderful The Corodi schiavi ebrei (Va pensiero) was performed twice. I also was impressed on how the camera registered the sadness of the slaves faces. The directions as well as the orquestra were amazing.
This DVD deserves 5 stars.",1442707200,6,737,4.583333333333333

I PURCHASE ANYTHING  THAT COMES ALONG REGARDING NABUCCO.  I WAS THRILLED WHEN THE CONDUCTOR HAD THE SONG REPEATED -- YES, REPEATED -- BEFORE HE COMMENCED WITH THE REMAINING PERFORMANCE .  BRAVO ! !  . .",1429833600,,283,4.58
2190052,5,B0006O9M6S,"A truly outstanding production of a ""Grand Opera"" requires capable singers, beautifully authentic (the composer's setting period) costuming, an appropriate (composer's setting) stage setting and an excellent orchestra with inspired conducting. And in such an opera with choral requirements the chorus must also be capable and well directed. Verdi's Nabucco tends to be respected and loved by opera devotees for two particular reasons; the ""Va, pensiero"" chorus and the especially difficult soprano role of Abigaille. This MET Opera production is virtually superlative. The third act scene between Abigaille and Nabucco is wrenching. Immediately following this scene the choral performance of the ""Va, pensiero"" can induce goose bumps and tears. There is even an unheard of (At the MET) encore of this choral treat. If one collects opera videos, this one is required.",1416528000,3,866,5.568181818181818

I received my copy today - Saturday - in the mail, listened to it this afternoon and will be returning it on Monday morning.  The instrumental distortion is beyond anything I would have expected.  Maybe 20 or 30 years ago, but today?  I nearly wept because it was so bad.  Hopefully, I can get a DVD in which the sound is as beautiful as the opera.  I liked the singers and expected nothing but the very highest quality since James Levine was the conductor.  To receive something of such low quality was more than disappointing - it was a travesty.

2190078,5,B0006O9M6S,"I was introduced to Nabucco in the 50's in a live recording from Naples (?) with Maria Callas.  She has been a hard act to follow!  Suliotis & Dimitrova were serviceable, but not great.  I love a soprano who can pull off an early Verdi role; very few have - Sutherland & Tebaldi were among the best.  Maria Guleghina sets the new standard.  She can handle the lower register, the upper register & and the middle is like velvet.

In fact, this production has a dream cast.  Gwyn Hughes Jones & Wendy White are new to me, but they put their mark on this production.  Ezio Pinza has always been my favorite basso & Samuel Ramey is his equal.  He is a very versatile singer (Handel, Mozart, Rossini, Donizetti, Bellini, Verdi, Puccini & all three Faustian Devils).  Juan Pons (not a Gobbi & not one of my favorites) is very convincing in the role.  The rest of the cast is more than adequate.

James Levine and the Metropolitan Opera Chorus & Orchestra superb.  Levine, as usual, puts on a great show.  The staging is very dramatic and visually exciting.  This is the best ""Live from the Met"" production I have ever seen!",1336089600,4,1117,4.46039603960396

WHAT I LOVED: GULEGHINA, GULEGHINA, GULEGHINA!!!!! SHE CARRIES THE SHOW. PLUS, I REALLY LIKE THE OPERA.  NOT SORRY I BOUGHT IT.",1314057600,,393,4.75
2190080,4,B0006O9M6S,"This is a very strong performance from the Met. Terrific orchestra conducted by James Levine, excellent sound on the DVD (I listened in stereo). Right away with the overture you know you are in for a treat. Traditional, grand staging in the Met. manner -- no attention-grabbing Euro silliness or time-shifting confusion. As for the singers, they are all good, and some are excellent. Maria Guleghina isn't pitch-perfect 100% of the time, but she has a tremendous expressive range and can pull off this most difficult of parts. Juan Pons as Nabucco is commanding, and vulnerable when the role calls for it. Gwyn Hughes-Jones, a tenor, as Ismaele, was very impressive -- I had not heard him before and had no expectations but he has a very strong and beautiful voice, acted well, and was clearly working hard (he's sweating like a pig inside of five minutes into Act I). Wendy White and Samuel Ramey (who has never been all that impressive to me) were fine.",1296691200,2,955,4.759036144578313

2190083,5,B0006O9M6S,"I just checked this out at the library and I was really blown away.  I watched it two times straight in a row and I almost never do that.  I am really not sure why it is so good, though.  There are a lot of problems: the soprano is all over the place vocally, the Nabucco pretty much refuses to act, the sets seem a little silly (but at least they are spare enough not to look kitschy), and there is mostly ""stand and deliver"" acting/singing.  I think that the contribution of Levine may have something to do with my enthusiasm, but it is hard to analyze.  Also, the soprano (Guleghina), for all her vocal shortcomings, does really seem to love this opera and be so into every moment of it.  The lack of kitsch in the production also helps you to focus on the serious drama (the weird amazonian breastplate that Dimitrova wears in the Muti DVD, with big, fake metal [......] and the other types of silly costumes that you often see in this opera are absent here, with the cast wearing simple costumes that suggest the 19th c. with a slight overlay of ancient touches).

Anyway, I highly recommend this DVD, even if I don't really know why. :)",1235347200,5,1142,4.3584905660377355

2190085,5,B0006O9M6S,"I didn't even bother to read the reviews of less than 5 stars.  This performance is the Met at its best, Levine at the top of his form, and one has to wonder if, in Verdi's lifetime, it was ever performed this well.

Its other dvd version, from La Scala, is stodgy and plodding; this performance moves with the winds of freedom that were just beginning to blow through Italia of the time.

Disclosure:  I wept during Va pensiero...that never happened before...and I wept during the encore (I can't remember another Met encore in my day)...the Metropolitan Opera Chorus should be counted amongst the wonders of the world.

So, whoever found something to object to, I leave them to their spleen.  I had a grand time and a Big Fat Bronx Cheer to those who didn't.",1187395200,10,760,4.551470588235294
2190086,5,B0006O9M6S,"Amazing effect -- the chorus stars but everyone -- even ""old"" Ramey -- eventually comes through. Oh, and disregard the ""critic"" who praises the Naples production and criticizes Ms. Guleghina as not singing in the true ""early Verdi style"" -- the heck with ""early"" or ""late"" -- to me, this production and cast achieves a greater Aida-effect than the Met does in the Aida or the Don Carlo available on DVD.  I think that Verdi -- if they have DVD's in musician's heaven -- would say: Bravo! and not ""OK but not correct as early Verdi.""",1181779200,7,532,4.541666666666667
2190097,5,B0006O9M6S,"Speaking of timing, we do sense that the early Beethoven and the late Haydn sound like Mozart, kind of, specially in their piano pieces. But Verdi, since when the early Verdi was being classified as bel canto? Though, it's timing fell right into the period of Bellini and Donizetti. I am not a musicologist. So I am not going to make a strong argument on that. But that is what troubles me: Lauren Flanigan is a very accomplished singer at NYCO. Certainly, in my opinion, she is more than qualifying for staying in the Met (not just for stand-in, now and then). I have not seen the San Carlo tape and therefore I cannot talk about her performance there. But I do know that she is not a `dynamo.' No matter how beautiful she sang, as a bel canto singer should, it is just not right for Nabucco. In which, Abigaille is militant, bad, may be even evil. She is in charge (she thinks she is, or at least try to). One reviewer here got it right; he compares Abe to Lady Mac Beth. That is, vocally these two characters should sound ugly (as many music critics had said). In addition, I think, a singer ought to be a powerhouse to sing Abe. I saw the Met-PBS broadcast and the LA Opera version (also with Ms G., on stage) the following year. Paraphrasing those words coming from one critic of the LA Times: She is the real thing. In this CD (which is derived from the PBS tape), among the rest of the cast, the chorus, I think it was a superb performance. Although I had a slight reservation on the costume and the setting, I think this CD well deserves a full mark (five star).",1170720000,5,1570,4.3074324324324325
2190098,5,B0006O9M6S,"My father is an opera enthusiast, and Verdi is his favorite composer.

We own several other DVDs of Verdi operas, but this one is definitely one of the best we've purchased.

2190099,5,B0006O9M6S,"Great cast under the baton of the great James Levine.  Requires a great chorus for this opera, and the Met chorus is well up to the task.  Don't miss this one!",1156032000,6,159,4.096774193548387
2190100,5,B0006O9M6S,"This Met production of Verdi's ""Nabucco"" finds that dear old ""Metropolitan Institution""  at the top of its form delivering a wonderfully exciting operatic production; one that is filled with HUGE sets and  brilliant colors.  This stage production has some astounding visuals including massive staircases, columns (on a revolving stage) and giant statues (idols) plus at one point half the stage is set on fire.  Added to all of the aforesaid there is some wonderful singing from a superlative cast as well as marvelous and heartfelt singing from the chorus.  The orchestra, under Levine, (as expected) plays marvelously. Levine keeps the proceedings moving along very well.  I was never made aware that Nabucco is rather immature Verdi.
 Having followed Samuel Ramey's career from his very early days, I was somewhat saddened, at first, to hear and to see him sounding and looking rather old realizing that indeed time had slipped away.  However, once his voice warmed up and he discarded some unflattering costumes, he sounded and looked as if not too much time had gone away delivering his usual sonorous bass tones.
 Juan Pons has never been a particular favorite of mine; however his singing of Nabucco is awe inspiring portraying the character believably while delivering a full rich sound.  After all, there aren't too many of the heroic Verdian Baritones hanging around opera houses' stage doors these days!  So I was very impressed with Juan!
 A fearless Maria Guleghina tackles that voice-killer role of Abigaille with much nerve and sings it very well.  She displays no trills and not the greatest floritura; however, she lets fly with many astounding high C's at one moment then plummeting into the lower depths the next-brava!  I guess we really can't have everything in this role for it is really impossible to sing well.  (Callas dropped it early in her zenith later advising Caballe not to even think of singing it)
 Gwyn Hoghes-Jones as Ismaele and Wendy White as Fenena are also very good displaying rich full voices.
 If you want to see and hear opera at its most exciting do not hesitate to buy this DVD.  (By the way, the picture and sound qualities are great!)",1122854400,81,2181,4.961432506887053
2190101,4,B0006O9M6S,"Contrary to the very poor review given by other(s), I, being a singer myself was blown away by the live 2005 production of this opera and it is excellently recaptured in this DVD.  Having grown up on the stage of the Met for 5 years in the children's chorus,the daughter of reputable classical musicians, and the godmother of a diva who graced the stages of the Met, City Opera, and La Scala in the 60's, great opera has been a part of my life from the beginning.  THIS is great opera.  Guleghina may slip a pitch once in a while, but popping out one fearsome high C after another is no easy feat.  The chorus gives one of the better performances I've ever heard them do in the ""Va pensiero,"" that ends in a near impeccable pianissimo, garnering the now traditional cry of ""Viva Italiana"" followed by an encore. Embodying great Italian literature, Verdi's masterpiece is done great justice, despite a note here or there.  To those who may not agree, I only suggest that you try singing it.",1118188800,31,989,4.5027932960893855
2190102,5,B0006O9M6S,"I bought this DVD Friday to enjoy it during a bankholiday and I have enjoyed it each day. The chorus performance in ""va pensiero"" is so impressive that enjoy it four times each performance because the audience obtained an encore when it was performed. Guleghina and Jones fit into the character as a ring to the finger. The darkness and light contrast in the revolve of Assyrian versus Israel choirs is highly effective and the setting of fire of Bible scrolls in the Jerusalem Temple make the end of Act 1 unforgotable. Also the distruction of Baal temple in Act 2 sets the limits to understand Nabucco's insanity. At Met they know how to make credible special effects on stage and on multimedia. Just buy (or rent) the DVD and enjoy it. There is nothing else I can say.",1117324800,15,771,4.553956834532374

I saw this production at the Met and have since watched it twice on DVD and find it to be a truly historic Metropolitan Opera experience.  The entire cast gets into their rolls with a frenzy seldom seen on the opera stage.  The Met production out does their massive sets for AIDA, which I've also seen on the Met stage.  Levine has the orchestra eating out of his hand and the singers/chorus are with him every note of the way.

2190104,1,B0006O9M6S,"Early Verdi is NOT verismo. Early Verdi requires belcanto, attention to all the detail and embellamenti that the genius of Verdi put on the musical page. Nabucco was written during a period when belcanto was supreme. Abigaille is not Turnadot or Santuzza. You cannot ignore the trills and runs and fine vocal details Maestro Verdi lavished on this fiery character. ""Anchio dischiuso"" must be sung with a delicate tracing of a lost love, a longing for the past, not some out of tune caterwauling that would disgrace a first year vocal student. Miss Ghuleghina would do well to embrace the noisy excesses of some Strauss characters, Electra, etc. Never have I heard such gorgeous music served so badly as Miss G. does in this ghastly Nabucco production. It is not up to the singer to re-write the music to fit their very limited vocal technique.

If you want to hear and see a contemporary Abigaille do this role to perfection get the Abigaille of Lauren Flanigan from Teatro San Carlo, Naples. Here is vocal perfection; all the fierceness and fire Verdi demands, but here too is complete attention to each note and marking on the page. The markings are there for a reason. Verdi had a vocal language that MUST be followed. Each and every little quarter note is there for a reason. It is not enough to approximate the vocal line, skip the trills, and scream the rest. Shame on Miss G. She is a disgrace to opera.",1116979200,29,1410,4.662650602409639
2190105,5,B0006O9M6S,"I wrote this review in spanish first, then i translated to english for respect for most users. As it follows:

I was thinking on rating this DVD with 4 stars. The reason? Juan Pons. He's a great baritone, with a deep strong voice. But on stage is terrible. I have this idea since i saw him the last year as Rigoletto at the Met. I feel that he's the less brilliant of all principals, and his bad acting, make us lose much information about his character. Nabucco, on the opera, goes trough arrogancy, ,madness, etc. It's really important that the singer will be able to portray this emotions and to exprese them. Pons satisfies only the musical part, not the characterization, as maybe is more important on DVD.

However, the DVD deserves 5 stars because the performance is amazing. Levine, conducts in an intimistic manner, but with energy and dynamism. As well the chorus, another character by itself in the opera, gives us great pleasure troughout their different moments. Even that ""encore"" of ""Va, pensiero"", something unprecedented in the Met,  is totally justified. Considering that this opera, and this part on particular, was seen here jus a few times. The sound and acting of the chorus is great.

Maria Guleghina, awesome! She's so a strong woman, ideal to portray women like Tosca, Lady Macbeth, Odabella, or Abigaille of course. Able to sing those dangerous notes, specially on the scene of the second act. She gives the character the personality required. Those things made her an excellent and top of the line performer. Sometimes out of pitch, as many say, but never ruining the interpretation. I think is her style and is not necessarily disturbing. I had the chance to see her performing Lady Macbeth, and i noticed that, then I heard Nabucco by radio, and enjoyed the same effect.

Samuel Ramey creates again a great Zaccaria. His convincing performance and his voice make this Zaccaria a perfect role for him. Two big surprises are Gwyn Hoghes-Jones as Ismaele and Wendy White as Fenena. Two great discoveries, wouldn't be better.

The production of Elijah Moshinsky and John Napier is elegant and dynamic. Using contrasts of lightning to create nice pictures for each scene.

-------------------

Yo pensaba calificar este dvd con 4 estrellas. La razn: Juan Pons. Para mi, el es un magnfico bartono, excelente voz, potente y grave. Pero en escena es un fiasco. Esta idea me la hice cuando lo v el ao pasado haciendo Rigoletto en el Met. Luego, cuando supe que este gran esperado Nabucco sala en DVD con l en el papel principal, estuve un poco escptico por eso. Siento que es el menos brillante del conjunto, y su mala actuacin nos hace perder mucha informacin. Nabucco debe pasar por varios estados, soberbia, locura, entre otras. Eso es muy importante y no se debe obviar. Pons no esta a la altura del personaje. Slo lo est musicalmente, pero esto no es un disco...

Como sea, le pongo 5 estrellas porque, definitivamente, la energia que se percibe en esta performance es nica. La razn? No slo la impecable direccin de Levine, quien sabe darle un toque natural y relajado, pero dinmico, a la ejecucin de la orquesta; tambin el Coro, quien, como un personaje mas de la pera, nos conmueve y lleva al clmax en sus diferentes pasajes. Ni que decir del bis de ""Va Pensiero"", algo no visto antes en el Met, pero perfectamente justificado. Pues, la mayora de personas de este coro tan estupendo quiz nunca antes la haba cantado en este teatro. Impecable el sonido y actuacin.

Maria Guleghina, impecable. La presencia de esta mujer la ayuda a interpretar papeles fuertes, como Tosca, Lady Macbeth, y Abigaille por supuesto. Pero esa voz que tiene, tan gil para jugar peligrosamente con las notas, casi mortales, de la partitura, adems de la potencia de la voz, que inunda los teatros, la coloca en primera lnea de las sopranos actuales. Si bien algunos lectores aqui tienen ciertas objeciones, yo recomendara conocerla ms, adems de conocer mejor al personaje de Abigaille. Quien conoce a Guleghina, sabe que ella juega con la orquesta, saliendo de tiempo a veces, pero nunca desmejorando la interpretacin. Cuando la vi como Lady Macbeth, tuve la misma impresin, pero al escucharla en Nabucco por radio luego, confirm ese estilo.
Samuel Ramey aporta de buena manera pues, no solo su porte actoral convence, sino la franqueza y belleza de su voz, que encaja como anillo al dedo al personaje de Zaccaria.
Dos gratsimas sorpresas son Gwyn Hughes-Jones como Ismaele, y Wendy White como Fenena. Voces que dan un tremendo aporte al conjunto, no hubieran podido ser mejores.

La puesta de Elijah Moshinsky y John Napier es elegante, dinmica, y, aunque tradicional, bastante estilizada. Jugando con una buena iluminacin y contrastes de luz que crean postales de cada escena.",1111104000,50,4780,4.874384236453202
2190106,3,B0006O9M6S,"Maria Guleghina has to be the nerviest singer on the planet.  Basic tenets of good singing such as accurate pitch, legato, a steady tone, and fidelity to text and musical line seem to perpetually escape her.  She seems to thrive on a gutsy, no-holds-barred approach that might suffice for Tosca but completely sabotages what musical integrity there is in an already extreme role such as Abigaille, who is rather like a bel canto heroine on steroids.  When this video first aired on PBS, I watched her aghast as she heaved and lumbered through this treacherous role, all blowzy nerves and no finesse, with the kind of old-fashioned clutch and grab, heave and sob approach that gives opera a bad name.  In this latest Met offering, there is no stop left unpulled--she even interpolates a few high notes.  Her ascent to the high C and two octave drop in Abigaille's recitative is a complete botch, but no matter:  on she goes like a one-woman dynamo, clearing away every last vestige of good taste and tame musicality in her path.  And, yet, I have to hand it to her:  in her hamfisted, heavyhanded way, she's undoubtedly committed.  The kind of cool elegance that one takes for granted in, say, Mozart, is completely beyond her, but, then again, this is early Verdi, so I guess some vulgarity is to be expected.  She's the anti-Stepford prima donna and everyone's worst nightmare of an Italian opera singer:  loud, overblown, and tacky.  But strangely compelling anyway, either despite of or because of it (I haven't quite figured that one out yet).  In this Met production with its massive sets that look like they were designed with the theme ""Hebrew sadomasochistic dungeon"" in mind, she's joined by Pons, a serviceable, if unremarkable Nabucco, and Ramey, somewhat past his prime but noble and affecting anyway, despite the cornrows.  The veteran Wagnerian James Levine conducts.",1109635200,27,1881,4.9113924050632916

8041931,5,B0006O9M6S,"Where to start? I own multiple versions of nearly 100 operas and I consider myself a bit of an enthusiast. For me to praise an opera, I must have singing, acting, direction, and believability. I respect the art of operatic singing and I realize overacting (Terfel comes to mind) has been taught for the benefit of the distant audience. For this reason, I'm able to forgive any acting flaws in this production. And I wouldn't deduct even a fifth of a star for such frivolous pickings.

This may be my favorite opera DVD on earth. I ignore critics who dismiss this as Verdi's ""Lohengrin"". I will point out my favorite part, being the act one trio between Abigaille, Ismaele, and Fenena. I have never seen this beautiful music performed with such passion and elegance. Most Ismaeles throw their voices at this trio and either overwhelm the females or are a distant 3rd. The harmony here is perfect, yes perfect.

As for Maria Guleghina, any imperfections in her voice are lost on 99% of opera fans, which is probably less that 1% of earth's population. I'll take those odds, and I'll take this Abigaille as the definitive performance on DVD, and there is no close 2nd. She acts with passion and she completely invests her everything into this role. Her final aria is a tearjerker and I have NEVER seen such a thunderous and deserved curtain call.

In summary, if you can get beyond Pons' wooden acting, another easily forgivable sin, you will find an absolute gem here worthy of 6 stars. Considering this opera is widely considered outside Verdi's ten best, how can you lose? And in closing, Gwyn Hughes Jones, in my opinion, is the absolute gold standard for any future interpretations.

8041935,5,B0006O9M6S,"This is one opera I wanted to see, but it is almost never performed anymore.  So I decoded to buy a DVD and see it.  So  many to choose between, so I chose this because of good reviews on Amazon, and because it was conducted by Levine and featured Samuel Ramey.  All of the soloists were excellent, and I cannot fault any of them; the Met chorus was as always, perfection.  Samuel Ramey's voice was not as steady as it had been years ago, but still strong, and always on key.  I am more than delighted with this purchase",1465171200,,520,4.202020202020202
