4994415,5,B006JN8748,"This is an extraordinarily powerful film that takes us to the streets of Chicago and illuminates the courage, finesse, truth and restorative justice practices of a growing group of ""Interrupters"": people who go in and speak truth, provide alternatives to the cycles of murder and violence, and show that it is possible to unwind the cycles of pain and violence by caring enough to do the grassroots one on one work it takes to redirect vengeance into forgiveness and healing.

Perpetrators are often victims themselves, and this film provides ample evidence that it is possible to interrupt violence even in the most extreme cases. We get to see this in action as the camera crew goes into real situations of conflict and the full stop, on-the-spot cycle breaking that Ameena Matthews and other Interrupters do in some of the most difficult and complex scenarios, risking their own lives to help retrieve people from the endless cycle of gang violence and murder.",1339632000,,963,4.9813664596273295

'The Interrupters' is an excellent documentary about a group called CeaseFire, which primarily employs streetwise, ex-cons as 'Violence Interrupters' on the tough streets of inner city Chicago. The 'Interrupters' are reformed criminals who know the lingo of the street and go around trying to defuse potential confrontations from occurring, cooling down members of their community, who often become enraged due to minor sleights which are misinterpreted as major signs of disrespect.

The group is led by Tio Hardiman, an ex-petty street criminal who later earned a Master's Degree and now heads a ""Mission Impossible"" team who are 'on call' to nip any potential violent incident in the bud. Remarkably, during a staff meeting shown at the beginning of the documentary, a fight develops right outside where the Interrupters are discussing strategy, and they rush out to quell the violence which involves one youth threatening another with a knife.

'The Interrupters' focuses on the lives of three members: Ameena Matthews, an ex-Gang enforcer, now a spiritual Muslim, who has communication skills as good as any highly-trained social worker; Cobe Williams, who served 12 years for Drug Trafficking and Attempted Murder, now a gentle family man, and Eddie Bocanegra, who was incarcerated 14 years for murder, now a talented artist.

We follow these 'Interrupters' as they work on various 'assignments', troubled individuals (a good number of them young people), who are prone to acting out behavior. Matthews acts as a grief counselor for a family whose son was murdered, a case which was widely publicized on Youtube and received national attention. She speaks at the funeral and we see the devastating effect the murder had on the victim's family members. Matthews also counsels a teenager named Caprysha, who ends up back at a youth facility at film's end. She concedes that not all their interventions will be successful. In the case of Caprysha, she appears to vacillate between good conduct and bad (although I read on google that she eventually earned her high school diploma).

Cobe Williams works with two brothers who can't seem to stop fighting with one another and later gets good results with a neighborhood hothead, 'Flamo', who wants to take revenge on some thugs who beat up one of his relatives. Williams manages to calm him down and in the last segment, we see 'Flamo' has obtained a job as a security guard and is wearing the uniform, ready to head off for work.

Eddie Bocanegra not only teaches art to elementary school students but also works with a young parolee, who was sent away three years for armed robbery. There's an emotional scene where he returns to the scene of his crime, a beauty salon, and apologizes to the victims. One victim accepts his apology but still makes it clear that his actions had a devastating effect on her life. The young man eventually obtains a job as a gardener at a school and is proud that he has put his violent past behind him. Eddie would like to apologize to the family of the victim he murdered, but indicates the family is perhaps not ready to forgive him.

While 'The Interrupters' do valiant work, one wonders how effective they are at what they're doing. One Interrupter concedes that their work is only a 'band aid' and the violence simply continues unabated, all over this country. The Interrupters admit that you can't work with someone who ultimately doesn't want to change.

Steve James, known for the award-winning documentary 'Hoop Dreams', has done an excellent job showcasing the noble aims of this group. Sometimes I felt that 'The Interrupters' could have been a tad bit shorter, especially toward the end. But all in all, it's a fascinating look at how one group attempts to deal with the plague of violence, in their own community.",1329177600,10,3853,4.981337480559875

Director Steve James, whose classic Hoop Dreams captured the difficulty of teenage hoopsters with startling intimacy and power, has delivered yet another haunting portrait of life in urban America, and even though there were many great documentaries in 2011, I think The Interupters was one 2011's best documentaries.",1329177600,16,713,5.155172413793103

4994490,5,B006JN8748,"The Interrupters
 The Murder Capital of the United States is the title that Chicago has gained over these past years. This makes citizens of Chicago far from happy and its a title that no city wants to bestow on itself. What is been done to lose this horrible epidemic of violence? According to the documentary The Interrupters there is not much that is been done because people aren't putting much effort or importance to this matter. The documentary introduces an organization that is trying to stop the violence that is occurring in the streets of Chicago. One of the first issues that the group Cease Fire presents is that people are setting bad examples for the kids that are living in the neighborhoods. Most of the kids learn from imitating the same violent actions that their role models in the community have set. Moreover, Cease Fire states that most violence that occurs in Chicago is not well handled. Meaning that problems resolved in the neighborhoods of Chicago are through fights and usage of firearms. To conclude with, Chicagos police department and government need to start addressing this issue the number one priority in the city.
 To begin with, the organization Cease Fire brought up one of the major problems that keep the violence in Chicago to keep proceeding. Kids that live in Chicago lack the present of a father and the only way the find role models are when they are out in the streets. According to the U. S. Census Bureau one in three children will live in a home with out a father. Who are these role models that adolescent find on the streets? The Interrupters claim that the role models of these children are gang members and convicted felons that teach children their way of life to survive. The movie even shows interviews with young thirteen year olds that have been shot because they encounter trouble or because they were caught in the middle of a gunfight. The life that the children lead will just leave them in crossroads between death and jail.  Even if adults in the communities of these kids want to start setting good examples it will be extremely hard. Most of the adults in these communities cannot get jobs to start a new way of life because they have criminal records. The organization Cease Fire has tried to encourage people to keep looking for hard working jobs. Adolescents in Chicago communities need role models that are trying to get out of that violent life or adults that have successes in a job/school.
 Mediation between fights that happen is yet another factor to stop gang violence and gunfire misusage. In Chicagos communities people are use to protecting their pride and their family by the means of violence and verbal abuse. The film manages to capture a mediation that Case Fire has with two gangs that were fighting in the streets. The gangs were fighting over five dollars and they were at the point of killing each other. When Cease Fire counselors step in the fight both gangs agreed to speak to each other about the situation that is occurring. Since these people got the correct type of attention they manage to avoid the situation without injuries. Young adults and adults need to learn to seek the correct type of attention from professionals that are willing to help out with any type of problems that they have. Unfortunately not all the cases presented in The Interrupters have had the opportunity to seek the correct attention. In the film many of the problems that occur between people in the streets where unable to be talk about with the group Cease Fire. This ended in many fatalities of young adults between the ages of 13 to 24.
 According to CBS, Chicago is the most corrupt city in the United States. Not only does Chicago have problems with uncounted money, but also with the police. During the film a fight was record in the middle of the streets and police were called in. When the police got to the scene they were covered in feared and left without resolving any issues. The police should be there to Protect and Serve as the motto states, but in reality they do not provide any type of help.  During the time of the documentary Chicagos politicians wanted to bring the National Guard to stop the number of violent events that where occurring in the city. Bringing in the National Guard to Chicago will only have two outcomes; provoke fear in citizens or provoke more gang violence against troops. The city needs to come up with a well develop planned on how to save the city from violent attacks. Chicago has heard plenty of speeches from politicians promising things will change, but at this point only actions can prove that the city is becoming a safer place.
  In conclusion, Chicago is a wonderful place to live in and many diverse cultures help citizen expand their knowledge about one another. Like every great city it has its flaws that it needs to work on. The hugest problem that the city of Chicago faces is violence. The first step to address this problem is to encourage and help children to find role models that will help them improve their life styles. The children of the city are the ones that will be in charge of future generations and we need to keep the change going. Second, there are so many fights that occur in many communities between individuals that people need to be thought on how to handle unwanted situation. Some individuals might even attend counseling to solve problems with strangers in their neighborhoods. Finally, the last problem that The Interrupters focus on is politicians and the government. The government and spokes person need to present the public with solutions that can actually change the violence rates in Chicago. Violence is not something that the residents of Chicago should have to face everyday.",1395100800,,5749,4.747747747747748

In addition to trying to interrupt potential violence in the moment, these ""violence interrupters"" also take on the less dramatic but perhaps even more important long-term work of acting as mentors and support people to youth at risk and ex-offenders.

It is as compelling as it is heartbreaking, and beautifully told. Tacitly, it is a story of how systemic bigotry and racism has resulted in a poor community of color turning on itself. Overt racism has quieted in the media and polite conversation among Whites, as Black and Brown people in poor communities continue to receive inferior public educations and fewer job opportunities, thereby mystifying the whole process.

But the way this group of brave people worked to make small differences (that can add up to big changes) left me awed. Cobe and Ameena and Eddie will stick with you as examples of what young hoodlums can grow up to be ... and why we shouldn't give up on even ""hopeless"" kids.

Yeah, the movie did run a bit long, but I was so glad I stuck with it to hear the incendiary ""Flamo"" talk about how one interrupter was so persistent, like a fly buzzing around his ear while he slept.

Each of the admirable volunteers has their own history of violence - making their pleas and initiatives far more credible than otherwise. Expert analysis has found decreases in violent crime associated with this program. I was also impressed by the incredible talent/skill previously hidden in each of the volunteers, as well as the depth and seriousness of the violence problem in inner cities.",1353542400,,801,5.573770491803279
