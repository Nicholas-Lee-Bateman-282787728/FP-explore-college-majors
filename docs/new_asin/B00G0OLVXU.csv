8619923,1,B00G0OLVXU,This is the worst type of pseudo sciences and all you intelligent design theorists are to blame for giving credence to this line of inquiry. Just because we don't understand how humanity did something in the past it is a phalicacy to assume humanity needed help. This is faith and religion disguised as scientific inquiry.,1495670400,,322,4.872727272727273

8619927,4,B00G0OLVXU,"This is a video of a live conference, with 4 (I think there were 4) speaker guests. They do cover ancient technology, the Sumer  culture, and Planet X and Mars subjects. A lot of it I have seen elsewhere, or it was knowledge I already knew. But the section on Sumerian language and culture was somewhat new to me, and I want to look into that subject and that civilization more now. The guests use slides / or powerpoint to cover their discussions.

It's not a polished documentary, or anything like that. Just a stationary video cam. The picture quality is average, the sound is good. How much you enjoy learning is up to you, depending on how much you already know on the subjects, you will either be interested or bored. I believe they mentioned it was taped around 2010 (?).",1420243200,3,778,4.471830985915493
