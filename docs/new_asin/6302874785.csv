523144,5,6302874785,"I bought this movie primarily because I loved it as a kid.  I really enjoyed watching it again, and it is an interesting tale of life in the 70's in a small town in Texas.  Fun stuff watching the antics, activities, and styles!  The movie played well.",1299542400,,251,4.297872340425532
523145,4,6302874785,Great story of how residents in a small town cope with their lives and works their stories around a bad on purpose drive-in disaster movie. Certainly worth watching. Hopefully it will be out on DVD very soon.,1288828800,,208,4.648648648648648
523146,5,6302874785,"There's a lot going on in ""Drive In"", with several different subplots, as other reviewers have said, but the best part of the movie, for me at least, is the ""Widowmakers"" story line.  Enoch, played by Billy Milliken, as the Widowmakers' leader, lounges in the back of his shag-carpeted van and delivers the best lines of the film while toying with his switchblade.  ""Sassier than a Cadillac Seville"", he tells his truant girlfriend.  Good stuff.",1280188800,,445,4.906666666666666
523147,4,6302874785,"I'll echos the review here, one of the funniest comedies out there. But why isn't it on DVD?",1176940800,,92,4.166666666666667
523148,4,6302874785,"In the mid-1970's the Texas Film Commission provided considerable assistance to local filmmakers in an effort to grow the in-state film industry. One benefit of this was a little film appropriately titled ""Drive-In""; a feature about drive-in movies meant to be shown at drive-ins. Although set in a small town outside Dallas, it could be Anywhere, USA; or at least any place where teen entertainment is centered around a town's roller skating rink and the drive-in theater.

If ""Drive-In"" was nothing more than a loving look at drive-ins and a time-capsule of the mid-70's it would be a treat, but this film is actually very well made. I originally saw it at a drive in Orange County, CA a few months after moving there from Texas. Although most of America's drive-ins have vanished, the entertainment aspect of this film has held up very well.

Don't go looking for a lot of familiar faces in the cast, part of the film commission's mission was to utilize local talent so you will see a lot of Texas folks getting their first and last screen credits. You might recognize Engelberg (Gary Cavagnaro), the fat catcher from ""The Bad News Bears""; and character actor Glenn Morshower but the rest of the cast are folks like Michelle Franks, a local beauty who just acts natural.

The main story involves the efforts of the town's hottest girl (Glowie played by Lisa LeMole) to convince nice but very shy Orville (Morshower) that she is sincerely interested in him. But the film is loaded with side stories that weave into and around the main story. These include two wimpy teen gangs, The Widow Makers and The Gear Grinders who have a mild fight witnessed by a couple of outlaw bikers who comment: ""Gang violence, its frightening"". There are a couple of bumbling small time thieves who attempt to rob the theater box office. There is an auxiliary sheriff with gun rack and right-wing bumper stickers who shuts up his nagging mother by smoking a joint with her. There is an engaged couple having second thoughts about getting married, especially after the guy gets a look at Michelle Franks at the concession stand.

Much of the humor comes from ""Disaster 76"", a movie within the movie. It is being screened at the drive-in and there are frequent cuts to the action on that screen. It is a nice spoof of a whole group of disaster flicks including ""Airport"", ""Jaws"", and ""The Towering Inferno"". Current viewers will be shocked when a 747 crashes into the side of a skyscraper in a manner almost identical to the 9/11 attack on the World Trade Center. Obviously this idea has been around for a long time although apparently no one in the FBI ever viewed ""Drive-In"", wonder if it got any play in the Middle East?

There is also a television show within the movie as The Widow Makers spend their downtime watching ""Ozzie and Harriet"" reruns on the television set in their van.

At one point Engleberg refers to Oklahoma as Baja Arkansas and says ""reasoning with a woman is like eating soup with a fork"". Glowie turns down the offer of a ride home from a guy hitting on her with the immortal line: ""I'd rather have a nonspecific infection"".

Fans of classic country music will love the soundtrack featuring Loretta Lynn, Conway Twitty, Ronnie Milsap, Merle Haggard, George Jones, Tammy Wynette, and Jerry Lee Lewis. ""Whatever Happened to Randolph Scott?"" by The Statler Brothers is the theme song.

Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",1131580800,23,3433,4.729096989966555
523149,5,6302874785,"Many years ago my girl and I saw ""Drive-In"" and have been looking for it ever since. In a small western town, the locals social life is wrapped around the nightly showing at the drive-in.
  The numerous sub plots build like a classical farce to an inter-twined climax. Watch for the bumbling guys who plan to rob tonights receipts, the nice kid who rescues the girl, the cowboy planning to propose at tonights movie until ... Cute girls, clean fun, the ridiculous on screen disaster movie comprising the nightly feature, the memorable moment when the drive-in manager finds the punks about to burn their enemy's car. Gather a few friends, get some popcorn and join the locals at the drive-in. I highly recommend it for easy fun that brings back the memories of what the drive-in was all about.",1043193600,7,793,4.697841726618705
523150,4,6302874785,"I saw ""Drive-In"" at a real drive-in in 1976 -- and then I watched it on HBO countless times afterward.
The main characters of  ""Drive-In"" were forgettable, but I'll NEVER forget ""Disaster  '76,"" the ""movie"" that's showing at the drive-in that's the  subject of ""Drive-In.""
""Disaster '76"" was a parody  of every Seventies disaster movie from Jaws to Airport '75 to The Towering  Inferno and more. ""Campy"" was an understatement.
If you're old  enough to have suffered through Seventies disaster flicks (and maybe even  if you're younger), you'll chuckle at the tacky special effects and  deliberately bad scripting of ""Disaster '76."" I wouldn't be  surprised if the writers of ""Airplane!"" (1980) found some  inspiration in this earlier flick.
""Drive-In"" is, in essence, a  movie-within-a-movie, shown in the Seventies at a  drive-in-within-a-drive-in.",966038400,25,849,5.396946564885496
523151,5,6302874785,When I saw this film it was the support for Blazing Saddles.  Despite its poor reviews it went down far better with the entire audience that night than the main feature did.  I consider it the funniest film I've ever seen.,955497600,19,222,4.390243902439025
523152,2,6302874785,"I first saw this movie in the 1970s, back when the genre washot. I grew up on the genre and would love to see it again (the 747was cool).",945475200,5,137,3.7586206896551726

523164,5,6302874785,"I love this movie. It's dated but so am I! I first saw this movie when I was in elementary school and I have often thought about it over the years. I checked online for years and all i found was VHS copies on ebay. I am so glad I purchased this DVD copy. This movie is 70's fun. The plot is corny at times, the music is great, the actors are funny and the cars are classic. What more do you need? A true period piece! It should be shown in history class. Makes me wish I was 12 again.",1440288000,,484,3.801980198019802
523165,4,6302874785,"I first saw ""Drive-In"" in the 1970s on HBO.  I thought it was one of the funniest movies for its time.  It's a campy, cult film.  Thus, I will refrain from reviewing the movie.  If you saw it in the past and want it on DVD, you already know if you like it.  I have a copy on VHS, but no VCR to play it on.  That's why I got the DVD.  The film does have a kick-ass country music soundtrack that you would have heard on a 1970s AM country radio.

This is a 'made on demand' DVD so it may not play properly on some PC drives.  However, I have a Pioneer DVD player in my home theater system and it played fine on it.  I did watch a few segments on my PC with a CD/DVD drive, but not the complete movie all the way through.  The bits and parts I watched played OK, so I think it's reasonable to assume the DVD will play on at least some PCs.  When played on my Pioneer unit, the DVD looked great.  Other reviewers said the color looked washed-out, or had other issues.  To me, it almost looked restored!  But I am biased because I am used to a 20 year old VHS picture.

I held back on a 5star review because there are no extras (they would have been nice, but the movie is the main attraction.)  You must also sit through the multiple copyright/piracy messages.  There is no way around them on my Pioneer.  Don't we all already know this stuff?",1440028800,,1339,4.003787878787879

523169,4,6302874785,"I was a movie projectionist in a small Texas town in 1976, and remember showing this movie.  They were fond memories, so I ordered a copy to see if it was as good as I remembered. It was better.  It's a light, fluffy summer movie, but it's both fun and funny.  And as another reviewer has said, the cheesy disaster movie showing at the drive-in just makes this movie the more memorable.",1436227200,,386,4.333333333333333
523170,5,6302874785,"I've loved this movie since the first time I saw it in a drive in as there is a movie inside the movie, a compilation of every disaster movie ever made. The packaging was certainly bare bones. No scene menus, no sound options, It's like they took it straight from the reel and put it on a disc. But this is a classic movie with at the time unknown stars. The Main characters are Glen Morshower known for many TV shows from 24 to West Wing to CSI. On the big screen he was most recently scene in the Transformers franchise. Also starring is Lisa Lemole, now known as Lisa Oz, an American producer, writer, actress, and frequent co-host of The Dr. Oz Show.

523172,2,6302874785,"I like old B-movies and 70s drive-in flicks, so I checked this rarity out. It's 90 minutes I'll never get back (as the expression goes). Some reviews here say ""funniest movie""...but I say far from it. Unless you were in this movie, worked on this movie, or just want to be sentimental about the '70s in a small town, I found it to be horribly slow, aimless and pretty horrid slapstick, simple hillbilly humor (if you like ""Dukes Of Hazzard"" this may be for you). The soundtrack had 4 songs over & over, with a few other short clips thrown in. While it is nice they reissued this for some to enjoy, I found it to be a real waste of time. Roller skating, drive-ins...great to reminisce. Don't expect much more out of this one.",1428710400,,724,4.37037037037037

523184,4,6302874785,"In 1976, we had a movie critic on TV in St Louis who was the equivalent of ""Mikey"" (he hated everything).  This critic thought ""Drive-In"" was absolutely hilarious.  So I had to go see it.  I loved it.  My standard of what I consider hilarious has risen over the past 39 years, but having just seen the movie again for the second time, I still enjoyed it.  It is amazing because the movie's characters were entirely local talent. My favorite part of the movie was (and still is) the movie within the movie, ""Disaster 76"", although it is sad that the airliner crashing into the ""Towering Inferno"" came true 25 years later.

523187,4,6302874785,I saw this movie back in the day and remembered laughing hysterically. I bought it mostly on sentimentality but also to see how it would fare with some of the so called comedies today.,1419638400,,184,4.4411764705882355
523188,4,6302874785,"Low budget charmer about drive-in night in a small Texas town circa 1976.  The movie follows an assortment of characters whose lives converge when everybody goes to the movies--two wanna-be robbers who don't have a single brain between them; a ""club"" of silly looking white dudes who think they're tough looking to beat up on some rivals; an inexperienced young man who doesn't quite know what to do when a pretty girl dumps her abusive boyfriend (and head of the previously mentioned club) and decides she wants to be with him; the inevitable scammers sneaking people in; a young couple having second thoughts about their engagement and more.

Drive-In was entirely unambitious, pleasant fun when it was originally released but it's turned into an unintentional treasure trove of nostalgia for those who grew up in the 1970's.  The second half of the movie takes place in the drive-in of the title--cars with speakers on the windows; the rusty playground set in front of the screen for children too young or bored to watch the movie, the shoe-box shaped building containing the refreshment counter--it all brings back vivid memories for those old enough to have frequented these places--drive-ins were still very common when this movie was made but they're almost completely extinct now.  As if that wasn't enough there's also an extended, nicely detailed sequence in a roller rink--another popular 1970's entertainment that long ago vanished.

Beyond the nostalgia Drive-In remains fun but it also bares the unmistakable stamp of TV veterans applying the lessons they learned working on sitcoms to the big screen--Drive-In moves quickly and delivers some well-placed laughs but the characters aren't memorable or well-developed and the plotting feels like little more than a shallow riff on American Graffiti--basically it's a ninety-minute episode of Happy Days set in the 1970's.  But the unfamiliar faces--most of the cast is filled with non-professional or barely professional actors and the specificity of the Texas setting give the film an authenticity that helps to offset the more generic aspects of the material, resulting in a movie that ends up being better for its lack of polish.

Drive-In isn't likely to have much appeal for young viewers but for those who are the right age it will likely bring back memories and offer some enjoyable laughs as well--but you might have an uncontrollable urge to watch Airplane! afterwards.",1418860800,,2440,5.162025316455696

523191,5,6302874785,I think this is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. Many will disagree. The plot centers around life in a small Texas town and mostly it's teenage population getting ready and going to the drive in. There is the slightest hint on women starting ti take control of their lives but there really is no serious message here. It's mostly bad jokes and one liners. This movie was hard to find for a long time but now it's available on DVD. This is replacing my grainy VHS copy I recorded years ago from cable tv. It's so nice to have a good clear copy.

523194,5,6302874785,"As I look back on my youth, the more I love this movie. I am from Texas and I grew up going to drive ins like  The Skyway,The Trail, Palo Duro, and other super sleezy ones in my home town.  Drive ins were places where I grew up. Cold nights with on the post heaters that made more noise than heat, and driving off with the speaker still in the window.  Yes I even snuck into them in the trunk of cars and don't get me started about the ""back row.""

Drive In the movie is a comedy, but to those of us from Texas rural towns, it is a documentary.  Yes, we talked like that.  As for the skating rink scene, yep dead on!  All the way to the pom poms on the skate.  The drive in concession stand was the place to meet and hook up with girls, if you were lucky.  For me I just got to look.

This little seen jewel is what is called regional film making.  It was made to fit the middle America audience.  It was never ment for the urban audience.  A very good reason to see this movie is the movie showing at this drive in.  If you remember the old disaster movies then you will get a kick out this.  But a BIG plus is the music!  The music will bring a big o' smile to all the good ole boys and girls of Texas!

The use of the songs is wild.  The scenes of the movie run right into a song that makes a comment on the scene.  The Texas town was like the small towns of West Texas.  To city slickers this a spoof because you never lived in these places.  I no longer live in Texas and this sweet time is gone and this is a shame, it was a wonderful time to be teenager.",1380844800,7,1561,3.8459119496855347

I thought I had a copy of ""Drive-In,"" but this new 2012 Sony MOD edition demonstrates my VHS transfer was but a pale imitation.  Home video audiences still don't realize how much poor picture quality cuts into their viewing enjoyment.  When you have access to superior picture and sound, your enjoyment is multiplied.

So I am very pleased with the quality of the Made-On-Demand Sony Choice Collection DVD of the 1976 comedy ""Drive-In.""  Regardless of what the Amazon Product Details reports, I was happy to find this DVD is actually anamorphic widescreen.  The video transfer was excellent, furnishing a sharp representation of everything a fresh print of this low budget film has to offer.  The audio is vivid as well, so we can better appreciate the many 70's country/western classic songs that appear throughout the soundtrack.  There are no extras, no trailers and in fact no DVD menu.  Pop this into your player and the movie just starts.

For those unfamiliar with the movie, it's a lighthearted visit to a small Texas town on a Friday in 1976.  We meet some citizens and learn of their various agendas for the evening, all of which culminates at the local drive-in, The Alamo.

There is not one familiar face among the cast, but they all do a very nice job in their roles.  Even though some of the situations are a little silly, you know that the filmmakers meant it to be that way, so nothing feels like a misfire.  We are in good hands from beginning to end and its all comfortable and reassuring fun for the whole family.

You may see some earlier reviews stating that they shipped the wrong movie in the first batch.  That mix-up has been straightened up, as I ordered ""Drive-In"" two months after release and did, indeed, receive ""Drive-In.""",1342828800,4,1875,4.705521472392638

If you grew up in Texas, ever spent any time in a drive in, or just want to see what it was like to live in the days before video games and vcr (Pong exlcuded) this is a movie to see. The star is still on television from time to time but you would not recognize Orville. Other than that, just one actor might be noticed since he was in the Bad News Bears. This is all local people doing funny bits. The movie that is showing on the drive in screen will crack you up, as well. I had not seen this movie since the 70s but I am glad I bought it to keep. This was once a cult classic on HBO in the days when they needed movies to fill the time. It is really worth a watch. The soundtrack is good too.",1341878400,3,717,3.8187919463087248
523220,5,6302874785,"This movie was made in 1976 on a micro budget that was augmented slightly by the Texas film commission. Although the plot is implausible, the over-the-top way it was performed made it very memorable and a treat to watch. What is amazing about this film is that there were virtually no recognizable actors among the cast. Almost all of the cast were comprised of people from Terrell, Texas, where the film was shot, and the surrounding area.

Despite the lack of professional talent among the cast members, the funny home-spun style of the plot and the excellent directing made this a surprise gem when it was released later in 1976. The film was picked up by HBO and played multiple times on that network during the summer of 1977 where it was an instant success with its national audience. This was no small accomplishment as HBO had, even back then, many prospective films to choose from for its summer line up.

Those who grew up during the 1970s or early 80s will appreciate Drive In the most. It was a time when we were still living in the shadow of Viet Nam and Watergate. This film was comedic respite involving the lives of young people in small town America during this period. Those who lived through the era will remember fondly the days of the local roller skating rink and drive in theater in their home towns.

Yet, no matter who you are, you just can't help but love this movie. The film reflects a much simpler time in America when the after shocks of America's 1960's cultural revolution had still not made their way to small town America.

Even some young people today still might find it interesting to see what life was like for those of us who lived our youth without the internet, faxes, cell phones, HD TV, gang bangers or drive-by shootings. Back in those days, social networking was done at school dances, the drive-in, the skating rink and the mall.

The plot of this story unfolds in a multi-narrative style which is to say it tells the stories of several different people and groups of people all at once. All of these characters converge at the Alamo Drive-In in Terrell, Texas for the last half of the movie. I'd prefer not to say anymore about the plot and let you see it for yourself. You won't be sorry.

The film was a popular VHS rental in the 1980s. As a testament to the movies strength, you can now get it on DVD. However, you'll have to buy it online more than likely.",1341187200,,2407,4.496567505720824
523221,1,6302874785,"I ordered this DVD, and although the package and disc read ""DRIVE-IN"", the actual movie on the DVD is BOSTON BLACKIE.  I returned it for a replacement, and the second disc was also BOSTON BLACKIE.  I don't know if all of the copies of this disc released by Sony are also incorrect, but I'd think twice about ordering it until this mix-up is resolved.",1335916800,7,350,4.453125
523222,5,6302874785,"This just came out on DVD.  I was 16 when it came out, and one of the first movies I  ever saw in the drive in after I had my license and could drive in myself.  I saw it a number of times at the drive in.  A great slice of the 70's.  This was my teenage years.  Roller rink, drive in, hanging out.  In the 70's We didn't have computers, Cell phones, Facebook.  This is what we teens did in the 70's.  It's the story of a shy boy named Orley who goes to the drive in with his little brother and hooks up with the girl friend of the local bully.  That afternoon,  before they go to the drive in theater, the two brothers  go to the local roller rink.  There is plenty of charecter development here, as we see Orley  and his little brother  meet up with many of the others people in the film , indulding the bully and his gang. This is also where the girl first  tells  Orley  that she likes him.  The roller rink is just like the one I went to as a teen.  This movie is a little slow paced but that is because it takes it's time developing the relationship between the two brother and the relationship between Orley and the girl.  There  are also two bumbeling would be robbers who want to steal  the cash box from the drive in.  Naturally everything they  do is wrong.  One of the best parts of the movie is the movie with in a movie.  The film the drive in is showing is Disaster 76.  Well, if you grew up in the 70's like me, you know we saw all of them.  All the Airport films,  Earthquake, Jaws, Towering Inferno.  All of them are satarized here.  The film on the screen is just as funny as the reg film and  it is a  hysterical send up of diseaster film.  Nearly as funny as Airplane.  In fact I bet the  Zucker brothers saw this and got their idea from it.  This film has no stars.  I do not remember ever seeing anyone in this film in anything  else.  Though Glen Morshower, the actor who plays Orley, did go on to do much on TV and in the movies.  He can be seen in many episodes of Star Trek and the TV show 24.  They all look like normal reg people, not plastic hollywood types.  This adds to the film.  It has a very regional feel / look to it.  Rod Amateu directed this.  He also direted most of the TV show ""Dobbie  Gillis""  and ""Our Miss Brooks.""  It's easy to see that he took his time with the actors to get them to be likable.  This film has no blood.  No nudity.  Not much swearing and just a little violence, fighting.  You know the hero has to fight the bully in the end.  Highly recommended.",1316131200,,2512,4.006109979633401
7832287,5,6302874785,Love this little treasure that allows me to enjoy my own memories of the drive-ins I grew up with.  Just a completely fun flick overall.  Will watch this many times in coming years...,1514246400,,183,4.515151515151516

7832289,4,6302874785,"I first saw 'Drive-In' ironically enough NOT at a drive-in but at my regular hometown cinema. It wasn't Oscar-worthy by any stretch but it was a very amusing, very enjoyable flick. I only saw it once but I never forgot it.

It took another ten plus years before I could snatch a copy off cable. And I immediately fell back in love with this movie and its very motley assortment of characters and what seemed an endless array of plots and sub-plots all intertwining on a fateful summer night near Dallas, Texas.

A quick caveat for the average viewer: a lot of the jokes seem to be rooted strictly in the Texas vernacular i.e. ""Her old man is on a pipeline job in Baja Arkansas"" ""Now where is Baja Arkansas?"" ""Oklahoma!""

And other strange homilies like: ""He's busier than a man with his hat on fire"".

A lot of the actors went on to greater success, like Trey Wilson (later seen in ""Raising Arizona"") and especially Glenn Morshower, making his film debut here as shy teen Orville Hennigson. The luscious vamp Lisa Lemole didn't do a whole lot of films afterwards but she did indeed rock those jeans cut-offs she wore throughout this movie.

Sorely under-used and under-rated actress Dejah Moore was awesome as the exasperated snack bar clerk. Her previous claim to fame was as the store clerk Tatum O'Neal cheated in ""Paper Moon"". Does anybody have a clue where she is now?

The scenes with the skating rink resonate with me because they could have just as easily been filmed in my hometown as we also had a skating rink where we all hung out.

At the time this was released I was about the age of Orville's precocious kid brother 'Little Bit' and likewise had an older brother who had a hot girlfriend and a hot car. Thus I immediately identified with him when he couldn't resist looking down at Glowie's ample bosom and uttering the classic line that I used to title this review.

There were too many memorable moments to go into here but a few of them include: The fortuitous addition of the gospel standard ""God's Gonna Get You For That"" when Glowie kisses Orville.

The concept of a film within a film which was pretty unusual for a low-budget flick like this but added an interesting dimension. (If I had seen this at an actual drive-in it would have seemed like some sort of 'Inception'-like scenario.)

The old lady ragging on her stoned, redneck son with the classic line: ""Oh, if only they had the Pill when I was young.""

The pairing of Trey Wilson and Gordon Hurst as the bumbling, would-be thieves who set out to rob the drive-in only to watch their plans go painfully awry.

Kudos to the music editor who decided to use the banjo-driven ""Misty"" by Ray Stevens as chase music. It really added a lot.

I kind of wish there was a sequel but I can see why there wasn't. I doubt this outing made a whole lot of profit for the film company.

I have a feeling a lot of the acting talent were locals who were willing to say a few lines ( seemingly off a cue card) to get their 15 minutes of fame. At least two of them went on to work in the film industry in support roles, like transportation and make-up.

The movie does seem a bit dated now but for someone like me who came of age in the '70's, it is an enjoyable diversion...even if you're not from Texas.

P.S. Does anyone have a clue of the name of the winsome steel guitar instrumental playing when Trey and Gordon are sitting in their car  waiting to make their robbery attempt? It's beautiful and I cannot find the title anywhere.",1494374400,,3494,4.434375
7832290,3,6302874785,"This movie is one of those that is better in memory than if you are seeing it again for the first time since it came out. Several different storylines that all intertwine at local place to be on a Friday night. There is also a movie within a movie as you watch Disaster 76, when the movie came out those kinds of movies were all the rage. It alternates between broad comedy and slice of life - intros case a Texas town in the 1970's. If you grew up in that time (even if not in that place) it will bring back hopefully fond memories. If you didn't there is a sort of anthropological aspect to it if you want to see what life was like before we had so many electronics in our home. Still worth watching, and entertaining.
