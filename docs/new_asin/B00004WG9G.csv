7925221,5,B00004WG9G,Great dancing but unfortunately did not like the background scenery.....The dancing is at its best and I have seen a few in the past,1402963200,,132,4.541666666666667
7925222,5,B00004WG9G,Tremendously vibrant dancing with great sets and excellent music. All round a very good buy. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys ballet and good music. An excellent production all round.,1366588800,,194,5.09375
7925223,5,B00004WG9G,"This 2007 recording is really quite special in so far as it is an entirely Cuban production. Not only are all the dancers Cuban and Cuban trained, so is the (pre-recorded?) Havana orchestra. Most importantly though, the whole development of the present Cuban ballet expertise is the result of the dedicated work of the choreographer, Alicia Alonso. There are currently 80 dancers in the Cuban Ballet plus 250 students and a further 2000 in other provincial schools across Cuba.

The Cuban choreography is described in the sleeve notes as a combination of Russian, American and Italian influences allied to the vitality of the Cubans. The notes go on to describe the outcome of this as producing `an expressiveness and a joy of dance without equal' and I am definitely inclined to agree based on this extraordinary production.

The dancers dominate a colourful but minimalist staging set - probably a touring solution. The costumes, however, are of high quality and are extremely attractive, capturing exactly the mood of the piece. The music by Minkus is precisely as expected, with no alterations, but from there on the production differs from any other I have seen.

The choreography is the creation of Alicia Alonso as mentioned above, and she has been able to create a spectacularly vibrant rendition of this rather slight story. The two key dancers representing Kitri (Viengsay) and Basilio (Ramel Frometa) dominate as they should with dancing of tremendous energy, skill and enthusiasm. The youthfulness and good humour of their roles comes over strongly. This is also supported by all the subsidiary roles plus the excellent Corps de Ballet. The most spectacular moment of many comes at the end as Basilio throws Kitri, who holds a joyous star-like shape, a full half metre above his wide stretched arms before catching her for a final set-piece hold. Fantastic and unforgettable!

The camera work is supportive and excellently portrays the production although I suspect that the high definition recording may be a bit over-contrasty. I would expect this to be rectified on any Blu-ray should there be one in the future. There is good surround sound - clear but a little reverberant which is why I suspect a pre-recording. You would not know otherwise. These, to me, are minor quibbles when so much else is of such excellence.

Whatever other version you have of this ballet, I would suggest that this is worth a try and likely to become an absolute favourite. For me then, a clear 5 stars.",1342051200,3,2497,4.9784172661870505
7925224,5,B00004WG9G,Last night we saw the complete Ballet in wide screen and color.  It was shot in Paris where the company was on tour.  As an extra there was an interview - primarily with Alicia Alonso - and some clips of her dancing earlier in her life.  And the performance of the Cuban Ballet is great! 6 stars were it possible.,1249862400,9,313,4.183333333333334
7925225,3,B00004WG9G,"This may be interesting to people compiling a history of dance, but I was disappointed in the old black and white poor quality film, the sets and camerawork.  It was an expensive lesson.",1233619200,4,186,4.636363636363637
7925226,5,B00004WG9G,"There are very few artistic accomplishments in the 20th Century to compare to the creation of the Cuban National Ballet from its beginnings to one of greatest ballet companies in the world. In Cuba, ballet is almost as popular as the national sport(baseball, followed by boxing and soccer), a situation not easily found anywhere else. All this is due to the tireless efforts of Alicia Alonso and her friends.
This performance of Don Quixote is one of the best available on DVD. It is also the first DVD we have of the Cuban National Ballet in the 21st Century. We have many examples of Cuban ballet stars dancing with other companies, like the ABT and the Royal Ballet, but not the entire company. The ballet world can only wonder where the Cuban magic comes from. Perhaps it is something in the water!
This performance, done in Paris in 2007, has fantastic choreography, artistry and technique. The costumes and sets are also beautiful. The camerawork, sound, and image are all up to the highest standards. The only thing it lacks, is the presence of the Orchestra of the Great Theatre of Havana. They recorded the music before they left for Paris. They used this pre-recorded music for the performance. Obviously, this was done to save money, since dragging the entire orchestra with them would have probably cost more than the expense for the rest of the entire ballet! The Cuban National Ballet is not exactly flush with cash. We should be glad we can see them at all.
The version of DonQ as performed here was especially created by Alicia Alonso and is a very convincing version, indeed. Choreographically modern and stimulating, it is perhaps also more faithful to the story as conceived by Cervantes. A great bonus feature is included which includes extensive interviews(in Spanish with English or French subtitles) with Alicia Alonso and the principal dancers. A wide variety of interesting topics are discussed, such as the formation of the Cuban ballet, and the basic philosophy that is part of their art and technique. Scenes of rehearsals of this and other performances are also shown. Lovers of classical ballet should try to add this to their collection. For further exploration into Cuban ballet, you might consider reading the recent biography of Carlos Acosta, ""No Way Home..."", as well as the biographies of Alicia Alonso.",1223164800,27,2340,4.926582278481012
7925227,1,B00004WG9G,"I ordered the 1933 Don Quixote directed by G.W. Pabst from Caiman.com via Amazon.  Their listing clearly said 1933 as does my reciept.  I paid more than $8.00 in ""expidited"" shipping for a $3.50 movie which ALSO shows on my receipt.  I received the movie 10 days later and it is some stupid 2005 cartoon version that doesn't even say 1933 ANYWHERE on the box.  I was VERY dissatisfied and will tell anyone who will listen not to bother ordering with Caiman.com.  You'd get it faster to remake the movie yourself.",1140220800,6,512,4.582417582417582
7925228,1,B00004WG9G,I purchased this video thinking it was the Peter O'Toole/Sophia Loren movie of the same title.  It turned out to be a poor quality animation that had very little redeeming value (even for kids).  Do yourself a favor....skip this one.,982800000,19,233,4.8
