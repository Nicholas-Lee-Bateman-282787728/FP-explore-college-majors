8231745,3,B000YB6EA0,"If you are used to Geraldine Chaplin, romantic Omar Sharif and Julie ??? do not buy this. But if you are fascinated with the history of the author and book this is authentic. This is the version of the book the CIA proposed for Nobel prize of literature and it won! Unfortunately Pasternak, under threat of permanent exile from  USSR (Mother Russia) never went to Stockholm to get his prize (manuscript was smuggled out of Russia by ab Italian billionaire machinations).",1356652800,,470,4.802469135802469
8231746,4,B000YB6EA0,"I've been a fan of Dr. Zhivago since seeing the David Lean film as a 10-year old.  Since then I've read the novel multiple times, seen the Lean film many times, and the British mini-series a few times.  This Russian version has a lot going for it, especially its authentic settings and interesting performers.

My favorite filmed version is still the original David Lean/Robert Bolt version (even though I don't like the anachronistic looking make-up and hair on the two female leads) for it's emotional punch.",1330041600,,510,4.906976744186046
8231747,5,B000YB6EA0,"The emphasis in this excellent film is on the dreadful nature of the calamities that afflicted Russia between 1905 and 1929 - revolutions, war, tyranny - as experienced especially by the protagonist. Thus the character Zhivago spends almost the whole film looking sad and this, in my view, misses the extraordinary POSITIVE SOUL LIFE that Pasternak infused into his poet-doctor.
  Apart from this defect, the film is beautifully made and includes parts of the novel omitted by both English films, notably Zhivago's liaison with Markel's daughter at the end of his life. It is good to see a Russian version at last available, even if some of the actors' faces are unexpected - notably that of Lara with her weak chin and Sasha Gromeko with his pudgy face. Both these actors in fact perform brilliantly and one soon gets used to their unexpected appearance. The depiction of Komarovsky is especially good - he has a convincing and utterly likeable charm, unlike the two English films' presentations, which explains how easily Lara falls for him.
  Personally I regret that the film does not begin with the burial of Yuri's mother, which seems to symbolise and anticipate the collapse of Holy Mother Russia, that it omits Yevgraf and does not give us Kubarikha's song clearly with sub-titles for it. However, we are certainly given a memorable picture of the horrors of war, civil war and totalitarian tyranny. Thank you, Russia!",1318464000,3,1426,4.9789915966386555
8231748,5,B000YB6EA0,"This is an interesting alternative to the Hollywood version. If you expect it to be the same you will be quite thrown out. I like both: this, version is closer to the original novel, as you would expect from the much longer, mini-series format, and authentic origin. The hollywood version is harmless fun and well acted too though. My DVDs arrived promptly from Marina's Books. I had a problem with two of the disks 'playing up' but after contacting Marina's books she promptly dispatched me replacement disks. A good series, and good service.",1297209600,,543,4.849462365591398
8231749,5,B000YB6EA0,"Russia has been reclaiming its classics for several years now, with remarkable remakes of such classics as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Idiot/dp/B0002FHR0Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Idiot</a>&nbsp;(2003) and Dead Souls (2005).  What makes this mini-series special is that Aleksandr Proshkin and Yuri Arabov fill out many characters and many scenes, which Pasternak had been content to leave as sketches.  This is particularly true of the first three chapters of the book which capture the years between the 1905 strikes and the onset of WWI.

Pasternak treated this merely as prelude, but Arabov, a master storyteller in his own right, gives the Gromeko family much more character, and develops the initial love between Yury and Tonya to the point you wonder why he would ever look anywhere else.  Komarovsky is played less as a nasty villain and more as wily lawyer who knows how to get the best of any situation.  It also doesn't hurt having the great Oleg Yankovskiy play the role, as he gives the old reprobate much more charm than I think Pasternak ever intended.

During the war, Proshkin is content to pretty much follow Pasternak's lead, although he gives much more attention to the breakaway Republic of Zybushino led by the blind prophet Blazheiko.  Of course, the centerpiece of these years is the democratic love that develops between Yury and Lara, beautifully played by Oleg Menshikov and Chulpan Khamatova.  No need to write in scenes here.  Pasternak fills them out himself, as it is clear that in his mind Yury's only love is Lara.  But, Proshkin doesn't let the viewer make such an easy choice.  He seems to have a greater affinity for Tonya, and forces the viewer to suffer through Tonya's pain as Yury grows more and more detached upon his return to Moscow.

The mini-series, like the book, is unflinching in its depiction of life in early Soviet Russia.  This is one reason the book, and indeed a Russian film took so long to make.  The book was banned through the Soviet era, finally published at Pasternak's son's insistence in 1988, during the Perestroika years.  Not that illicit Russian copies weren't available, but there was no way to get any official approval for a film production.  Sir David Lean's film had been the standard since 1965 with a very weak adaptation made in 2002 for Masterpiece Theatre.

Lean's film is probably truer to the novel in that he focuses primarily on the love between Yury and Lara, but Proshkin's epic production is much richer in scope and in many way more enjoyable to watch.  Menshikov is excellent as Dr. Zhivago and while Chulpan Khamatova may not be the glorious beauty Julie Christie was back in 1965, she gives her character much more resonance.",1291852800,10,2768,5.086283185840708
8231750,5,B000YB6EA0,"Delivery was very fast and I'm happy to report that fact.  I purchased this from Amazon.com.

To my knowledge, Dr Zhivago has been filmed 3 times.  Each film is different.  I shall try not to write spoilers.

A note at this point---if you have read the book, you know it is complex and covers a long time span.

1965---David Lean's film was made a few years after the publication of the book in western nations.  It was widescreen in both 70mm and 35mm at aspect ratios of 2.2 to 1 and 2.35 to 1 respectively if I am accurate.  However, it was very popular.  It was about 200 minutes long which is 3 hours and 20 minutes.  The music and scenery were, and still are, classic and popular.

2002---Basically a British Masterpiece Theater film of 225 minutes.  Same book, different movie.  Aspect ratio of 1.85 to 1.  Meant as a tv miniseries.  It is based on the book but is quite different from the 1965 film.  If you have read the book, then you may find this closer to the novel.

2006---A Russian film is now available with English subtitles.  It is very much longer and a tv miniseries at 16 to 9 (1.78 to 1).  Almost 8 hours in 11 parts.  It is full of details not in the previous 2 films.  I shall say a ton of details.  It is a deep study of the themes, events, and characters of the book.  It is complex, has many characters done in depth, very well acted, edited, music is used with great care and precision----in short, it is magnificent.  A film made with great concerns and artistic efforts.  It is very different from the previous two films.

Of course, film companies would not try to copy previous films but would endeavor to make a unique film.  What defines this Russian film company production, in my opinion, is the massive detail which is evident in the length of the movie and means many more events of the book are included while there are more characters portrayed in depth.

I wish there were special features about the making of the film, interviews, and scene locations, and such like.",1273708800,12,2009,4.415300546448087
8231751,5,B000YB6EA0,"Some years back,  I spent some time in Russia.  That was the time of transition from USSR into Russia.  This series brought back the memories of bitter freezing cold, the stoicism of Russian people, the brutal and callous Russian officials, and the existential angst of living in Russia if you are not one of the ruling class.

Though my Russian is poor, but I could still make out the subtitles did not convey the full depth and the subtle nuances of the dialogs. Oleg Menshikov, as usual, was superb.

I would highly recommend it.  ""East West"" and ""Burnt by the Sun"" are some other quite good movies, which deal with the early years of the USSR.",1260835200,16,647,4.5344827586206895
8231752,5,B000YB6EA0,"I saw David Lean's ""Doctor Zhivago"" when it was first released in 1965 in 70mm. It remained my favorite film for a number of years. I was delighted to see this new 2006, Russian interpretation of the Boris Pasternak novel ""Doktor Zhivago"". It is truer to the original novel than the David Lean version, though it still diverts from the novel in several places. It does not have as rich a complexity as the original novel, but neither did the David Lean version. It is very different from the David Lean film.

This Russian ""Doktor Zhivago"" is a magnificent dramatic portrayal of old Russia and the Revolution that shaped Russia for nearly a century. Zhivago is not the ""hero"" of the David Lean film, he is an intelligent but ordinary man caught up in a tremendous social upheaval. More depth is given to the characters than in the David Lean film. I was especially impressed by the authentic locations, the authentic language and the powerful performances given by the cast. This film shows many of the Russian cultural traditions and mannerisms that were missing from the earlier film. (For just one example, in Russia it is customary to sit down for a few moments before embarking on a long trip.)

It is 8 hours long in 11 parts, originally made as a mini-series for Russian television. When I received the discs I immediately took out the first and intended to watch only the first episode that evening. Four hours later and very tired I finally went to bed, saving the second half of the film for the next day. It was hard to take my eyes off it. I lived in Russia for a year, so I was able to brush up on my language skills. The subtitles are good. The original Russian is deeper, but in film subtitles you can only expect an approximation, fair enough. I recommend it if one wants to see a quality Russian production.",1242864000,31,1824,4.541033434650456
8231753,5,B000YB6EA0,"Doctor Zhivago has been done and redone throughout the years.  Who can of-course beat the Omar Sharif version?  The classic take on such an amazing book.  The mini-series was nicely done by the BBC, however, nothing ever really came close to creating the TRUE feel.
Of-course, not until a Russian production company decided to create their own version.  An 11 part series.  This books needs that much time to be able to tell this story.  Oleg Menshikov (Burnt By The Sun, The Barber of Siberia) is stunning as Doctor Zhivago.  The cast is incredible and this is HANDS down the BEST version that has ever been done.
The only sad thing for me is the only version that is available is fully in Russian with no English subtitles.  Being a Russian speaker, viewing this is fine for me; however, for my friends who enjoy foreign films/series like this, they will have to wait to see this version.",1200960000,17,890,4.624203821656051
