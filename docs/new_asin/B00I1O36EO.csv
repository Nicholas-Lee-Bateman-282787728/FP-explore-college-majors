8638316,1,B00I1O36EO,I really enjoy many of Tracie's other workouts and was so disappointed to have the audio-video mix up. Twice. I don't know. Maybe I thought the  would have been fixed I bought it a second time? It wasn't.,1501113600,,204,4.368421052631579
8638317,4,B00I1O36EO,"I agree with other reviewers. The voice is a bit off in portions of the video, but overall, Tracie's step work out class is fantastic! Considering that after a while I don't listen to DVD abyway, as I put on my own music blasting to be more fun, it does not make a huge difference that the audio is a bit off.....",1497139200,,313,4.064516129032258
8638318,1,B00I1O36EO,I would love to rate this 5 stars but unfortunately the video does not match the audio.  She is doing something completely different from what is being said.  Way too confusing.,1472774400,,177,4.67741935483871
8638319,2,B00I1O36EO,"About 10 minutes into the workout, the audio doesn't match the visual. Very challenging when you're trying to do a step workout and relying on cues. I received a replacement DVD that also had a problem. Took 3 attempts to contact customer service before I finally got my money back. Very frustrated with the whole experience.
If the audio/visual matched up, I think the workout would be great. I love Tracie Long and her instruction is always outstanding.",1455580800,,455,4.846153846153846
8638320,5,B00I1O36EO,I have  several of Tracie's exercise  dvd's and she is a very  intense trainer. If you work out with her  routinely you will  see a change in your body. Very good workout.,1447718400,2,171,4.21875
8638321,2,B00I1O36EO,"This workout would get a higher rating if not for poor production quality.  My specific issue is that a major section of the routine has a disconnect between the audio and the video.  I.e., the directions you hear on the audio don't match the routine Tracy is doing for ~10 - 15 minutes.  It's frustrating and disconcerting.  As a result, this was a waste of money that is now stuck on the back of my shelf.",1443398400,3,407,4.315789473684211
8638322,4,B00I1O36EO,I like this workout but the audio does not match the video in one part.  If not for that I would give it 5 stars.  This is a tough all step workout that will make you sweat!!,1427673600,,174,3.675675675675676
8638323,2,B00I1O36EO,"I guess I should have read the description in more detail...not a typical tracie long workout- it's all step. If you like step, you'll love it. I'm not a big fan...I love her other 2 much better!!!",1427241600,2,197,4.351351351351352
8638324,5,B00I1O36EO,I have been a FIRM believer for many years.  My favorite workouts are the Tortoise and the Hare.  I have been looking for a workout that was literally non stop and challenged me.  This workout fulfilled all my expectations.  It is definitely not for the beginner but definitely for a person who wants to take his or her workout to the next level.  This DVD was certainly a job well done.,1414454400,2,387,4.394366197183099
