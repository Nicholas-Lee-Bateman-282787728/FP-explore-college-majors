4227835,5,B003Y7F1NM,"NICE GUY JOHNNY is another offbeat, casual story written and directed by the inimitable Edward Burns.  It boasts a good story, some very fine actors, and carries a message that we all too often forget.  This is that polished little gem of a film that surprises the viewer with its quiet manner and message.

Johnny Rizzo (Matt Bush, a VERY promising your actor) spends his nights as a radio sports talk show host, a career he loves but one that his fiance Claire (Anna Wood) feels is not a money maker and has made Johnny promise that if by age 25 he does not make at least $50,000. a year, he must go to work in a cardboard factory.  That time has come and Johnny reluctantly prepares for his interview for the 'new job'. Johnny is nice, loves, Claire, but is frustrated at the promise he's made.  Enter Johnny's philandering Uncle Terry (Ed Burns) who wants Johnny to stay with his dream of being a radio host and in order to try to dissuade the ardently faithful Johnny, Uncle Terry invites him for a weekend at the Hamptons. There Terry, unknown to Johnny, uses the home of one of his married 'regulars' and encourages Johnny to have a last fling before his upcoming marriage and before he goes for an interview for the cardboard job. Johnny is nice and respectful and will not jeopardize his relationship with Claire.  But he meets a tennis pro Brooke (Kerry Bish) and soon finds himself in an innocent but apparently compromising position with Brooke: Brooke respects Johnny's engagement status but finds him different and more real and honest than most men and tries her best to win him over.  But Johnny rides the waves of discontent his night away form Claire cause, and at Terry's insistence and Brooke's influence makes a decision that changes his life.

The script is sharp, tightly written, and the acting by everyone in the small cast is first rate.  Matt Bush is a very fine new actor who is able to stand his own with the pro Edward Burns very well.  By the end of the film nice guy Johnny has completely won our hearts - and makes us wish we had the thoughtful courage of this lad to alter our own lives.  Very fine film.

4227836,4,B003Y7F1NM,"We need movies like this to continue to be made. Ed Burns get's it right again and again. Nice Guy Johnny is a film that everyone will find easy to relate to. We've all had or have known someone who has had that ""crossroads"" which invariably life throws at us. Specifically where you have to choose between your dream and some other competing interest.

Sometimes you are very aware of the choice other times you awaken to it as Johnny did becoming more and more  aware of the stakes. He had a lot of prodding from his colorful Uncle Terry (Ed Burns Character). But I've known others, and I'll include myself in this group, who didn't get the benefit of seeing the choice so objectively or didn't have the benefit of an Uncle Terry to give them a verbal kick in the ass when it was most needed. Quite frankly in my life my dreams never seemed to be as fully formed as Johnny's were at his age. But don't get distracted by the main characters age - that's not the point. Hang your hat on your ability to take up the cause of your own dreams at any age.

It's easy to get distracted by the alternatives of something shiny or sexy or maybe its an ideal whose threshold you tease yourself across because of some arbitrary time line - marriage comes to mind. I think for some young people there can be a lot of gravity around the notion that your life starts after marriage. This film deftly portrays this and all the while entertains us with equally real dialogue and solidly formed characters throughout the film.

This is a very enjoyable film, It's innocent and truthful and you easily go along for the ride with Johnny. What's rock's even more about Nice Guy Johnny is knowing that a passionate filmmaker told a great story on a small budget and presents a film that has the power to change people's lives.

Some of us need the wisdom of maturity from which if you're smart and have paid attention you can see that in hindsight the competing interest that KO'd your dreams in an early round - only artificially had risen to an equal importance during that period in your life. The lucky ones might stumble across this film and think twice about what Uncle Terry has to say.

In the Indie world Ed Burns once again - steals home - with class.

Terrific work by Matt Bush and Kerry Bishie !",1291075200,2,2288,4.3947990543735225
4227837,5,B003Y7F1NM,"I thought this movie was great!!!

I thought that the young actor Matt Bush (I believe now also a lead in the TBS series ""Glory Daze"") did a wonderful job.  I felt some great chemistry from Matt Bush's character and Ed Burns character.

I look forward to more stuff from this young actor and director!

Keep up the great work.",1290816000,,326,4.383333333333334
4227838,5,B003Y7F1NM,"Nice Guy Johnny is a realistic film that has wonderful characters played by a stellar, mostly unknown, cast.  Edward Burns returned to his roots with this film, made for a scant $25,000 with a 3-man crew.  Burns plays the antagonist Uncle Terry who harangues the main character about his impending marriage.  He gives the nephew some bad advice, crudely stated.  But his underlying message to the kid is a wise one.",1290729600,3,415,4.802816901408451
4227839,4,B003Y7F1NM,"Edward Burns is an interesting filmmaker. He is not interested in being the next blockbuster director. He just wants to make films his way and tell an interesting story in the process. Films such as The Groomsmen, Sidewalks of New York, and Purple Violets tell every day stories about regular people. Burns claims to want to be like Woody Allen but even Allen works in a ghost or a fortune teller every once in a while. Burns keeps it simple. Nice Guy Johnny tells the story of a young man who is faced with a dilemma; does he continue his dream of being a sports radio personality or does he take a boring job that pays well. There is no real suspense in what Johnny is eventually going to choose. There is never usually any suspense to Burns' films, but that is not why you watch them. You watch them because there is something comforting about them, like sitting down to have a casual conversation with an old friend. You are not discovering anything new, but you sure are enjoying yourself. I sat down to watch this one late at night when the previous two nights had resulted in me falling asleep trying to watch other movies. Not once did I get tired or lose focus on the story. And by the end I was smiling and felt all warm and fuzzy inside. I have never loved an Edward Burns movie, but I have immensely liked all of them.
As a side note, Burns continues to give the most educational director commentaries on his movies (he skipped Purple Violets which I was sorely disappointed). If you are someone wanting to shoot a film of your own, skip taking any film classes and just listen to Burns talk about how to make an engaging film on the cheap.",1289260800,,1652,4.384364820846906
4227840,2,B003Y7F1NM,"but this film is certainly not one of his better films. Boring and predictable.  Having seen just about all of his films, this one is sorely lacking.

4227844,4,B003Y7F1NM,"Entertaining movie, but don't take it at face value.  What we have here is a pretty accurate portrayal of a mealy-mouthed, easily influenced guy who lives in a fantasy world, and his homewrecking, enabler, beach bunny.

It's obvious that Johnny and Brooke are not going to stay together - they'll soon get bored and run off again with other people.  It's also obvious that Johnny is on his way to becoming an exact clone of his Uncle Terry down the road.  I got the feeling that the filmmaker (Edward Burns) was slyly trying to make that point between the lines.

The only character I *liked* was the ""evil"" fiancee (honestly, most single guys would be thrilled to find someone like her) who gets stabbed in the back by the ""hero"" couple.",1409961600,,738,4.603053435114504

4227847,5,B003Y7F1NM,"I stumbled upon this little film on Netflix and it became an instant classic in our house. I'm partial to the ""sports guy from the Bay Area"" main character but the film is much more than that. The interplay between Brooke and Johnny is cultivated with the perfect gentle touch, but Uncle Terry steals the show here. He is both charmed and charming, and every time I watch this movie I spend the next day telling everybody about him. A wonderful film and I'm happy to read here that I'm not the only one who thinks so.",1388966400,,517,4.34020618556701

4227862,3,B003Y7F1NM,"I purchased this out of intrigue as I had heard about the movie, specifically from the point of view of how Ed Burns shot it on a very tight budget, with no name actors in the main roles and then released the movie himself, with success. So I was interested to see what had been produced under these circumstances and in my opinion, the movie is definitely worth a look. There's some good acting and then some not so good acting, but overall it is enjoyable. Don't know that I would recommend spending $20 on the DVD but if you can rent it or purchase a used copy that would be best.",1326153600,,583,4.214285714285714

I do agree to a much less degree, that some of the acting and such was not the best.

At the end of the day, the movie is great.  The movie runs an appropriate amount of time (89 minutes)  It's a great story about love and to me the decisions our generation will go through (love, money, both?).  The story is well thought out, well told and believable.  It is refreshing to see that Johnny (the leading guy) isn't some hack who cannot act and is just ""Tall, Dark and Handsome.""  He is also considerably short than much of the cast, but these are some compromises you make in producing an indie.

4227865,3,B003Y7F1NM,"Nice guy Johnny is still a ""kid"" at 24 right down to his looks and voice that make him appear to be 17.  He is smart and a good guy at heart, and he has a low paid, radio sportscasting job that he loves and hopes will launch him, eventually, into a major career. He also has a stunning, dominating fiance who is basically saying , ""show me the money, honey"",  and he won't admit to himself that he is sick of her materialistic demands, her parents, and the condescending way they piss on his dreams. His womanizing, bar tending uncle (Ed Burns) gets it right away and recognizes that, while Johnny has no designs on being his uncle's type of player, he does need to be a little more selfish about his own happiness rather than capitulating to the fiance's agenda. So...he drags Johnny away for a weekend in the Hamptons, some exposure to an easy going and empathetic tennis pro, who is also gorgeous, and a lot of straight talk about how he is being railroaded into a life he does not want. While it is a little hard to believe that two beautiful women are attracted to a puberty-voiced wuss, the banter between Burns and Johnny is worth it.  It is a lightweight film, but the clever dialogue and Burn's cad character makes it very entertaining and funny.",1310169600,,1255,4.424242424242424
4227866,4,B003Y7F1NM,"The movie was predictable, but enjoyable. Ed Burns as the free-wheeling, loose-cannon uncle is perfect- doing what he does best. Great scene when he asks Johnny if he thought the girl was attractive, so that he could know 'he wasn't dealing with a fruitcake'. That is vintage Ed Burns and you never get tired of this cool dude.
Even though you can see this one coming a mile away, the film still keeps you glued to it. It's still captivating to see what Johnny is going through and how he is going to handle it. Simple, funny, a good story on life and the sacrifices we make.",1305590400,,575,4.383177570093458

judging be their performances, they shortly will.  Much better story than his previous Looking for Kitty,

4227868,3,B003Y7F1NM,"In one of the first major indie films to skip a theatrical release and prove that online and video-on-demand (VOD) distribution can work, Actor/Director Edward Burns recently brought us Nice Guy Johnny (2010). Made for $25,000 according to Burns, and with a production crew of three people, Burns being one of them, Nice Guy Johnny is an impressive all-digital effort by one of the brightest young filmmakers to buck the studio system. Ironically enough, Burns made his first feature film The Brothers McMullen (1995) for the exact same amount of money 15 years earlier. It was this film, shot on repackaged 16mm film stock, that started Burns' career. It's exciting to see him go back to his indie roots now that he's made a name for himself. I have enormous respect for Burns as an Actor, a Filmmaker, and a person. Even if I don't always think his work is the best.

Nice Guy Johnny is the story of a young guy, played by newly minted actor Matt Bush, whose been following his dream career as a sports talk radio show host. But he made a promise to his fiance years ago that he would leave that career behind and get a ""real"" job if it didn't start paying well when he turned 25. Now he's 25, about to get married, and he's still stuck in a middle-of-the-night time slot for his radio show, with little income to show for it. But he absolutely loves his job. And he doesn't really want to leave it behind for a dull job working at a cardboard box manufacturer on the East Coast, provided by his fiance's father. Being the dutiful ""nice guy"" that Johnny is though, he travels back to the east coast to interview for the job anyways. While he's there, he visits his Uncle Terry, played by Ed Burns, who questions his choice of getting married and quitting his job. Uncle Terry seems to know that Johnny isn't going to ""win"" by getting married to a woman who doesn't want him to be who he is. Against Johnny's vehement objects, Terry decides to set Johnny up with a girl that will appreciate him for who he is and what he does, seemingly to give Johnny a taste of something else so he has a more balanced outlook on life and his decisions. Kerry Bish plays the girl that Johnny is tempted with.

Shot on the Red Digital Cinema camera and edited using Apple's Final Cut Pro, Nice Guy Johnny looks good. I watched the film on DVD through Netflix ironically, instead of by streaming or video on demand. It wasn't as good of a presentation as the High Def trailer looks, but it was still decent. The cinematography in the film is better than average and I felt like Burns and his cameraman did a good job of lighting and shooting the picture. I think the film ""suffers"" for not having a larger crew to finesse the details of camera work and filmmaking, but when I remind myself that 3 people made this for $25,000, I'm very impressed with the results. What more could be done given those circumstances? I probably shouldn't compare this small indie film to a $30 Million Hollywood studio film. But I think most people just watch a film and compare it to all the other films they watch and make a judgment simply based on what they see and hear and not on what it cost to make or how it was made. Or at least that's the general way I look at movies as a cinephile. I see all films as equal in terms of the possibility for me watching them or loving them. At the end of the day, it's an experience you go for a short ride on, and it works or it doesn't.

Overall, I give Nice Guy Johnny 3 stars out of 5. The story was interesting and told pretty well with the cast of actors that Burns chose. The editing led by Janet Gaynor was solid with good pacing. The movie moved along well and kept me engaged. If this is the future of Indie films, I think there's a bright future ahead! While Nice Guy Johnny isn't landing in my top 5 films of 2010, it was a worthy film experience and I think it sets the foundation for more creative work to come at a similar production level. If more filmmakers can learn how to tell their stories at this level, just imagine how many more possibilities for great films there can be! You could make 80 Nice Guy Johnny's for the cost of one Winter's Bone (2010). Or 1,500 films compared to one The Social Network (2010), a film also shot on the Red camera. Granted...quality always trumps quantity in my mind. But I think you get my point. The more opportunities for work from filmmakers, the more opportunities for great films. Especially films we can watch at home or on the internet instead of in the theater. There's a new demand for a new type of film venue. I can't wait to see what Burns does next!",1295568000,,4626,4.364269141531323
