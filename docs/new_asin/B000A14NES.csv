8071874,5,B000A14NES,"I love listening to live music, wheather it is MTV unplugged to other live productions.  This album/dvd byfar is the best I have ever heard and purchased.  Unfortunately if your not Filipino or know of the Filipino music scene you won't know this album.  I personally found out about this album when I was visiting relatives in the country (Phillipines) this past year (07).  If your browsing and happen to see this DVD, the review, and happen to like live music of all types: BUY THIS DVD!",1200009600,,490,4.597701149425287
8071875,5,B000A14NES,"An intimate show from Nina singing familiar songs(18 total) all in english like ""Through the Fire""(my favorite), and ""Anything for you"" with music mix ranging from soothing to pop beats. The best filipino made music DVD I've seen to date with clear crisp video, Dolby Digital 5.1, DTS, and other bonus features like videoke mode. Nina's voice is very soothing, elegant, and powerful. Give her a try and you'll love it. This DVD for me has all the criteria I seek of a ""Very Good"" quality which is why I gave it a 5 star. Also available in CD.
