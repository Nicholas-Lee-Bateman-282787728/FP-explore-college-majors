2561717,1,B000FDFSJK,"I bought the Invitation to Worship DVD and I must say that I'm diappointed to say the least.  Here's why:

1. The audio quaility of the DVD is extremely poor.  On some songs I can hardly hear Bryon singing.

2. The DVD plays like a VHS - you cannot skip through the DVD which is very frustrating.  You have to hold the FF and hope you don't go pass the next song.

3. The audio seems to go from stereo to mono to just plain horrible at some points.

4. It was a very poor mixing job both video and audio. The transitions between songs leave you wondering what's going on.

5. The Presence of the Lord DVD is soooooo much better.

Unless you are a diehard fan, buy something else.  I recommend Tri-City's - Blessing of Abraham.  Excellent DVD all-around.  There is no comparison.  I like Bryon Cage's music, but I thought the DVD was lacking a bit.",1157587200,6,847,4.251572327044025

8121144,5,B000FDFSJK,Bryon Cage is truly the Prince of Priase.  The presence of the Lord was in that place I totally enjoy watching this concert over and over again.,1402876800,,144,4.333333333333333
8121145,5,B000FDFSJK,If your looking for an hour of pure praise and workship this dvd is the one.  Byran Cage allows the Lord to really use him and he brings you along for the ride.,1197676800,,160,3.8484848484848486
8121146,4,B000FDFSJK,"I must say that this CD though not as good as the last, put's Byron in another atmosphere of praise and worship. ""Breathe"" is my favorite track because it is a song that people from all nationalities and cultures can relate to.  I love to sing that song when I worship the Lord.
 The backgup singers are off the chain. However, there is one thing that kinda turned me off about the video.  It just seemed to me that the people were there for a show and not a worship experience.  I didn't like that part. Maybe it was the way the video was made. I don't know. I know Byron is anointed but I could not sense the presence of the Lord while watching the video. It was still a great project though, and I look forward to seeing what's next.  Keep up the good work Byron!!",1194825600,,767,4.155405405405405

8121148,5,B000FDFSJK,I was really surprized with this DVD. It was a great investment I am pleased to watch it over and over again.,1194220800,,109,4.0
8121149,1,B000FDFSJK,I was very much looking forward to this DVD as I love Byron's other music. But this left very much to be desired. It looked like an independent artist put this together. Byrons lips were moving and nothing was heard...or what was heard wasn't what he was saying by watching his lips. The transitions were very choppy and there was no smooth transitions. I got tired of hearing the same canned applause when you saw no one in the crowd moving. I would not recommend the DVD to anyone. Just be happy with the CD and save yourself the disaapointment.,1157932800,6,547,4.48
