8282172,5,B001B7H2I4,I love this cd . It's easy and comfortable to just play and do it. Not at all fast it's at a very normal pace so that you can actually do yoga along with the cd been played,1478217600,,172,3.5526315789473686
8282173,5,B001B7H2I4,"I love the asana demonstrations on this dvd, and the narration that goes with it while you're doing the postures.  The way the whole thing has been organized also makes it easy and efficient if you want to focus on certain asanas, or if you only want to do a few minutes of yoga during the day.  I've been doing yoga on and off, and this dvd provides the basics that I need to review. If you're a beginner, it's a perfect way to start a yoga practice and understand and do the postures the right way.",1467763200,,500,4.144329896907217
8282174,5,B001B7H2I4,"This is the best Yoga work out I have found on the market!!  It is slow moving, yet you need to be precise, you will be moving slowly but will notice the increase in your heart rate.  I love it and do it as often as I can at least 3 days a week!!",1423180800,,246,3.537037037037037
