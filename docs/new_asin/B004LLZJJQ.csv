8434497,1,B004LLZJJQ,"The film opens as if it is going to be a snuff film, but basically doesn't deliver unless your idea of a snuff film is to keep the victim unseen in a bag like the DVD cover. Two dweebs from New York drive to Wisconsin to team up with fallen reality star Meredith Phillips (playing herself) now a newscaster. They want to film the site where two little girls were killed. They stay in a small town with some local creepers and get more than they bargained for.

There is a ton of useless filler in the film including the road trip...oh-oh his buddy is sleeping..let's put our foot by his mouth and film it. We also watch them eat when farm land isn't boring enough.
