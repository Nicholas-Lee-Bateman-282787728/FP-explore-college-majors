8350692,5,B0024LQRAK,"I really like this film, as already stated well by the other reviewers,""Alice's House"" is about a manicurist that's living a pretty sad existence. A young family friend(some friend!) causes strife and more. How you ask. Read my other review.(Scott Cunningham's The complete book of incense,oils&brews.)",1321401600,,302,5.586956521739131
8350693,5,B0024LQRAK,"Ah, what a sad little morality tale. Well, not a morality exactly - an extended following-through of the troubles we can get into when our dissatisfactions combine with our unfulfilled desires.  Yet who can really blame Alice for being attracted to the husband of the woman who is her client at the beauty parlor? They knew each other long ago, as youngsters, so at first it's just a ""Hey - remember when...""  But the sparks fly, or perhaps old embers flare up...and Alice's husband is insensitive and absent long hours driving his taxi - and there's another thing that comes to light... Meanwhile Alice is dealing with her three unruly sons, the thuggish Lucas and the pretty youngest one he keeps under his wing:  the middle son is left out but the favorite of Alice's elderly mother who is treated like a housekeeping machine by all the others, liable to have her purse raided (by the favorite grandson), and forever working, preparing meals, washing clothes, resisting efforts to put her in a retirement home even though her eyesight is failing. (there's not too much wrong with her perception of what's going on, however).  Let's just say it doesn't end well...
Intensely human and speaks to all of us who have ever felt the stir of temptation...",1289001600,,1251,4.777777777777778
8350694,4,B0024LQRAK,"""Alice's House"" is a crowded high-rise apartment building in Sao Paulo, Brazil.  Alice (Carla Ribas) is a middle-aged manicurist who shares an apartment with her cabdriver husband, three grown sons, and elderly mother.  The husband is having an affair with a teenage neighbor, one son is a gay hustler and another is a petty thief.  Both Alice and husband appear to be in denial as they lie about their home life and finances to other people.  Only grandma (Berta Zemel) sees everything as it actually is and, ironically, she is going blind.  Alice sees new possibilities for herself when a one-time lover comes into the beauty parlor for a manicure.  Like Alice, he is married -- to Alice's best customer -- but he's sexy, wealthy, and far more attentive to her than her husband.
 Director Chico Teixeira has crafted a drama of family, friendship, betrayal, and frustration.  Ms. Ribas is particularly effective, and we feel both the physical and emotional claustrophobia of her situation.  The film in Portuguese with English subtitles.  Special features include a behind-the-scenes featurette and interviews with Chico Teixeira and Carla Ribas.",1248307200,6,1147,5.151351351351352
