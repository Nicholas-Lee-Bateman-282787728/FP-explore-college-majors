2518878,5,B000EHPXP6,"This movie answers all the questions I have asked many many times!! It moves along extremely quickly and the content is quality, pure quality! I would recommend it to anyone!",1140393600,7,174,4.833333333333333
2518879,5,B000EHPXP6,"I won't review story details from the film. The above reviewer has already done a fine job of that. I will give you my reactions.

I saw it Sunday night on TBN. I went into it knowing nothing of the movie or the novel on which it is based. I did turn on TBN knowing that they sometimes have interesting films on Sunday evening that are Biblically based. I confess, however, that I joined the film a little late, right when the character Nikki was sitting down to dinner in the restaurant with The Perfect Stranger.

At first I thought, ""What is this? A guy introduces himself as Jesus."" I was ready to be skeptical, but then that's how Nikki reacted, too. I kept watching and decided that this was a well-produced, well-acted something-- something that is often poorly done.

I found myself riding the roller coaster of emotions with Nikki. I loved her questions, I was saying out loud what I thought the answer might be. You may have seen me and thought I was watching my team play football with all the advice spoken out loud, the disappointments, the joys... the film swept me along like this.

One of my favorite scenes in the Gospel is the encounter Jesus has with the woman at the well. I was reminded of this encounter. Imagine a perfect stranger who knows you and your whole life... WHO IS HE???

I came away feeling like I understood Jesus better. I was struck by the intimate interweaving of three things: a) Nikki's unqualified love for her child; b) my own love for my children; and, of course, c) the Lord's love for each of us on a deep, personal level. My largest emotional response came when The Perfect Stranger asked Nikki if her child grew, fell in with a bad crowd, got high on drugs and killed someone-- if Nikki's child was slated for execution for her sins, wouldn't Nikki quickly offer herself in her daughter's stead? Of course she would. Of course I would, for my own child-- AND THAT IS WHAT GOD DID FOR US! He substituted Himself to suffer and die for what we deserve as punishment because He loves us that much! It all made sense.

This is one of the many truths that are arrived at in a logical, entertaining way. The film is entertaining on many levels AND it delivers truth to you in a way you can absorb, you can mull over, and with which you can identify.

No matter where you are in your walk with God; no matter if you are the most skeptical person in the world, but you find yourself reading this review, don't fail to purchase or rent this film. See it with friends. Give it to family members. The Perfect Stranger will give you lots to enjoy and the most momentous things to discuss.",1140307200,27,2622,4.404958677685951
2518880,5,B000EHPXP6,"I happened to see this last night on TBN's station. What an  imaginative beginning to a story: dinner with Jesus in a fancy restaurant! A woman who is having a difficult time in her  marriage goes to a resaurant where she thinks her husband will be and finds Jesus--with short hair, coat, and tie.  They have a long, deep, and sometimes funny, conversation. The main message He wants her to understand is God loves her and wants her to know Him so she can be happy. She asks Jesus some tough questions and He has some interesting answers.  The repeating messages of love and reconciliation touch the woman's heart and she is changed.  Only two things--minor compared to the real message--bothered me about the movis.  First, the actor claimed that God and Jesus are the same Person (in Luke, my favorite book of the four gospels, He declares Himself ""Son of God""--Luke 22: 70).  I believe God sent Jesus, and Jesus fulfilled His mission with the absolute authority of God; that whatever He did and said is the same God would have done and said if He were there.  I think they are so perfectly ""One"" that Jesus was in complete harmony with God's will.  Otherwise I don't understand Who He prayed to throughout His life, in Gethsemane, and on the cross. I think They are separate in physical or spritual form, but in perfect harmony in thoughts and actions.  Also, the actor stated that Jesus was pierced through His wrists when He was crucified, otherwise His hands could not have borne the weight of His body.  See the third DVD in the ""Jesus the Complete Story"" set and see what you think.  In Luke it states His hands (Luke 24: 39",1140307200,8,1632,4.551369863013699

2518965,5,B000EHPXP6,"I am glad I ordered this movie. The plot seems rather strange for the kind of world we are living in, but it could happen that God decides to show Himself today and have an intimate dinner with someone He loves. Of course, He loves all people but also knows those who long for Him and don't know it fully. Of course, He was among the human race centuries ago as the God/Man, Jesus Christ of Nazareth. He is in the world today in the Person of the Holy Spirit and only His own know Him.
It is a movie that makes you think and ponder.... what is it all about? Why am I here?  Certainly not just to eat, sleep, go to work and eventually...die!!
How boring! It awakens a strong curiosity to find out our destiny as human beings.

2518968,5,B000EHPXP6,"I had never heard of this trilogy and was introducted to it by a dear friend of mine.  I am usually skeptical of such movies as they make Jesus seem like a bit of holy hippie or over all unapproachable.  This series does the opposite.  This series runs against what churches generally teach where God is concerned.  He is approachable, non-judgmental and he doesn't kick us to the curb with every mistake we make.  This basically takes religion and turns it on its ear.  Of the three, the first is the one I liked the best.  In any case, each movie speaks to some of the questions we as people have when it comes to God.  This movie, for once, doesn't offer religion but it does offer the invitation for relationship.  Fantastic feature.",1484352000,,737,4.481203007518797

2519105,5,B000EHPXP6,"This is still my choice for sharing the message. I stumbled across this one time when I was laid up with a back injury and really loved it. Basically, it's very simplistic. As far as movies, sets, props, acting and all that goes, it would probably classify as very B or even C rated. But if you look past that, and pretend you were watching a play in a theatre, instead perhaps, and just simply listened to the message, you will soon see how masterfully BRILLIANT each of these films are!
I love how they present the questions and answers just as we all would wonder or ask; or have at some time or another. And it is great to have those questions - but the ANSWERS are what are so powerful.
If you have questions yourself; or maybe you know someone who does, this is really a helpful tool. These make great gifts again and again.

I saw The Perfect Stranger and after that I feel a total change in my life.
The actors are great,and everyone seems to relate to each other. You are drawn into the story as if you
were there and a part of it.

What would I do if I found myself face-to-face with Christ?  I doubt He would be interested in spending an evening with a woman who kept apologizing for things she had done nor would He want to sit across from someone who was sitting, gaping, in open-mouthed amazement.  I still don't have an answer.
I do cry at the end.  The movie does a wonderful job of taking the viewer to the point where the love Christ has for us and the value He places on our relationship with Him is realized.",1424390400,,609,4.2155172413793105

This was her first and only movie role. I asked him about that. Turns out she prefers to do stage plays. I believe she is working on Broadway. She is that good! And remarkably, several of the reviewers of this movie complained about the acting. I don't get it. Jesus does not display a lot of emotion. The role does not lend itself to demonstrating a wide range of acting talents. Jefferson Moore is very natural and at ease and his character actually promotes a feeling of peace. I thought the script was quite witty. I just watched this again for the second time. It was just as awesome the second time around.  The theology offered up doesn't jive a hundred percent with mine, but I was not tempted to stand up and scream blasphemy. The words uttered by the character of Jesus didn't deviate far from what is preached in many of the pulpits in America.",1368403200,,1032,4.48936170212766

At first I just let that play for about 15 minutes as I sat there waiting for my wife to come downstairs so we could watch it together.  I enjoyed that piano music a lot.  Okay, so this movie was most excellent and the dialogue was pure joy to experience with the lines being delivered in outstanding fashion.  One thing I must warn you about... do not, I repeat, DO NOT watch this movie when hungry... Oh man!  Not to spoil anything, but a large part of the movie takes place in a fancy restaurant and the food that keeps coming to the table was making my stomach growl with hunger!  Awesome!  Wow man!  To meet the Lord in such a way... But for now I'll continue to pray and listen for His still small voice until the day we all dine with Him in Heaven.  Wonderful movie and worth thanking God for.

2519574,5,B000EHPXP6,"The first time I saw this movie was several years ago in a cable channel that was Christian-based.  Later, I watch it again and it seems more inspiring and enlightening.

""The Perfect Stranger"" is a faith-based and spiritual-based movie with two characters interacting about questions about God and His relationship to the world.  Now, there are some people who do not like those type of discussions.  Then, this movie is not for you.  Also, there are some people who love these kind of movies.  Then, you will definitely love this movie.  But, there are some people who believe in God but had some strained experience with religion.  Then, this movie may benefit you.

Just like the 80's classic movie, ""My Dinner with Andre"", ""The Perfect Stranger"" deals with spiritual-based issues in a casual yet endearing way.  When you think of it, it is difficult to ""break bread"" with someone you dislike. Conversations will go longer even to the point of reaching some understanding of why...

Although Christianity is all about the heart, my logical mind guarded my longing heart.  The Perfect Stranger kick started my heart. It's so very well done. It's not pious but keen logic that stirs the heart.  Soft questions but with hard hitting answers. Although I'm now far into my Christian journey, I will still re-watch this movie at least twice a year. For me it's Christianiy 101 and I need that foundational reminder again and again.

Instead, listen to the heart of this message and let God stir up your heart. While the acting isn't going to win any academy awards the story is still riveting.  The only reason I knocked this down to a 4 star rating from a 5 star was the acting.  Even at that it moved me like few films have moved me.  The love of God is free to anyone who wants to accept Him.  His forgiveness is just waiting for the apology.  Eternal life can be yours.  Do you want it, or would you rather trade it in for a few moments of self-indulgence?

This movie answers a lot of the hard questions that Christians face, the Trinity, pain, death, sickness in the world, why God's way is the only way.  I particularly liked the ""There is a way, but there is no path"" to God dialog.  Open your heart and let God speak to you.  Those who don't like this movie have already closed their hearts to Him.

I was blown away with the first of my experiences and found that it was the latest in the series, preceded with these two productions and a seven part miniseries. This is the Jesus I know. And while not identical to the David Gregory books, the dialog holds very true.

You can top it off with a little trivia. Listen for the pilot's voice. The voice is David Gregory. I just sat through the credits and was astonished, but at the same time felt it was ""Perfect."" While the differences are subtle, I do recommend reading the books, Dinner with a Perfect Stranger and A Day With a Perfect Stranger (the two books these productions are based on).

All He wants in return is for us to accept Him in our hearts.  To love Him.  To want to be with Him in prayer and fellowship every single day.

I loved this set so much that I also purchased the 'made for TV' series ""Stranger.""  It continues this theme in a 5 DVD set of 9 short stories that are moving and lets you know how incredible God's love is for us.

However, in the end of the film when ""Jesus"" writes down how to get ahold of Him, Revelation 3:20, the writers of the movie are completely wrong! That verse is taken out of context! Jesus is talking about a church, NOT a believer's heart. So many christians use that in evangelism, and whether they think it works or not, it is WRONG. All scripture must be read and used in its context.

Other than that, and I hate when people do that, it's a good watch.
Also, has anyone else thought of simply opening a bible if they want to know God? This may give the impression that something huge like having dinner with God has to happen for someone to know Him.",1253318400,,721,4.294117647058823

I am so impressed by its simplistic, understandable answers to some of the hardest (a.k.a. complicated) life questions that I am buying several copies as Christmas gifts. In addition, as a Drama Ministry Director, I am attempting to organize a dinner and movie night at my church for *anyone* who just wants a free meal--because this film feeds the soul--The dinner will be free, of course--it's a gift, after all. And there will be no catch; no basket-passing, no hard-sell; nobody coming to anyone's door the next day, no Bible-thumping, hellfire and brimstone alter call--that's not what this movie is all about-- (nor my church's style for that matter).

I've enjoyed reading the reviews on this site, especially reviews written by those who are not believers/Christians, etc--because IMHO, their reviews carry so much more weight than those of us who are believers. These 'critics' have no hidden agenda to get you to watch the film. So take note this site has rated this movie with 83 out of 112 5-stars (at the time of this review.) And more importantly take note that people outside the ""faith"" said they were ""glued to the TV,"" the conversation was ""crisp and lively"" and the film addressed ""up-to-date issues"" with a ""simple, personal, straight forward presentation.""

2519665,5,B000EHPXP6,"This short movie (about 1:09 excluding the extras) is superb.

The basic plot is very simple:  A young lawyer, Nikki Cominsky (Pamela Brumley) receives an invitation to dinner with Jesus Christ.  She thinks it is a joke being played on her by either her husband or the neighbors.  Nevertheless, she decides to attend.

Most of the show centers around dialogue in the restaurant between Nikki and Jesus (Jefferson Moore).  Although a flick which is comprised almost solely of conversation may sound dull, this is anything but that.  Imagine what it would be like to have a dinner chat with the most influential figure in world history and you have a great story.

It is based upon the novel&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dinner-with-a-Perfect-Stranger-An-Invitation-Worth-Considering/dp/1578569052/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dinner with a Perfect Stranger: An Invitation Worth Considering</a>, which I also recommend.  During the course of the talk, Nikki asks Jesus questions that most people would probably like to explore.  Some of those include the following:  Design vs. chance, evil done by those claiming to be Christians (the Crusades, Salem Witch Trials, etc.), why God does not directly reveal Himself to individuals, 'contradictions' in the Bible, the existence or non-existence of Hell, and the purpose of suffering.  Another one that is discussed is the exclusivity of the Christian faith (No one can come to the Father except through me), and the fundamental difference between Christianity and all other religions (the Christian position that one cannot earn his/her way to Heaven no matter how good he/she may be).  In this area, there is a brilliant illustration of this point.

Rarely do I watch a movie twice.  Even when I have occasionally seen one a second time, I do not believe that I have ever done so in successive days.  I did that with this one.  It is profound, thought provoking, and potentially life changing.

I highly recommend this to any believer, anyone seeking answers to the big questions of life, and even anyone who is strongly opposed to Christianity.  It will help promote knowledge and understanding of what is really the essence of the message of Jesus Christ.",1238284800,,2247,5.405172413793103

A young woman, whose husband is suppose to go to a ball game, receives an invitation for dinner. She decides to go thinking it may well be her husband, but it is not. She decides to stay and see exactly what this is all about and soon finds out this man feels He is Jesus. Wow....
Our young lady decides to ask him all the questions about faith, God, Heaven and the many whys that all of us have had locked up in our hearts, Christian and non and perhaps were afraid to ask.
I sat glues to the TV as I awaited each answer. Some of her questions were straight to the point, hard and intense.  I was amazed at the wisdom given in this movie to answer each and everyone.
Trust me, this movie is not boring as you may think. It has a deep drawing effect, gives you peace, and understanding in so many areas.
However, my favorite and I mean my favorite is the ending when she hugs Jesus good-bye.  I thought my heart would beat out of my chest when he turned and smiled at her.  It was great.
I truly think Christians will love this movie and those who do not follow the faith will learn from it.  Acting is well done and it will definitely answer so many of your questions with honesty and love.

Nikki, the lawyer at first thinks it only can be a joke, but as she is sad and annoyed with her private life, decides to accept the invitation. From a skeptical person, Nikki, little by little becomes an amazed listener as the time goes by and Jesus answers all her questions which turn to be universal questions as you listen to her.

It is very simple, with simple settings and no 'special effects' to speak of, yet it completely engages the viewer.  The topics are thought provoking and Nikki (the protagonist) asks hard questions.  Jesus, as portrayed in the movie, is someone I would really like to meet.  He comes off as a true friend, a brother, a father and a teacher without trying to be those things.

2519689,4,B000EHPXP6,"This movie simply does an excellent job of presenting Jesus Christ as a very personal, loving savior.  But at the same time it makes clear his divinity and omnipotence.  Plain and simple.  A fascinating concept for a movie.",1217030400,,223,4.815789473684211
2519690,5,B000EHPXP6,"Everything Jesus says and does in this movie is consistent with the New Testament scriptures, but takes place in a modern setting. Jesus as portrayed by Jefferson Moore (who also portrayed Christ in the Louisville Passion Play) is a wonderful combination of gentleness and strength. Jesus' answers to questions and objections to the faith are fresh and well-reasoned, although understandably brief, to fit the pace of the movie. Regardless of whether or not you are a believer, you are sure to find the Q-and-A thought-provoking.

I had seen ""My Dinner With Andre"" years ago, so I knew that a movie featuring two people talking over dinner for the entire movie could actually be quite interesting. Sure enough, I found myself feeling enraptured, like I had entered a very special world and found myself experiencing the emotions of Nikki, as she went through a full character arc during the course of the dinner, climaxed by her emotional farewell to Jesus afterward. Another reviewer found the farewell maudlin, but I felt it was right on target. The movie was quite moving, and would probably make a great introduction to the Gospel message for people who are turned off by ""religion"", as I once was. (Funny thing is, I still am-- it turns out you don't have to be into ""religion"" to be a follower of Jesus!)

I was pleased that the production values were so high. I would not have known this was a low-budget independent film. As the movie progressed to its climax, it wove a powerful spell. It could not have done so had the lighting, acting, photography, music and editing not been consistently of the highest quality.

I am sending this or recommending it to my family and friends, some of whom are believers and others who are not. I believe the film has something to say to all.",1215216000,,1786,4.754838709677419

The Perfect Stranger is a great way to share your faith and some fundamental Christian beliefs.  Watch it yourself and then plan to have friends or family over for a ""dinner date"" that advances your faith and allows a fine way to finally share it with others.

The movie maintains an air of professional production.  Once you've moved through the first few minutes of the film you won't need to worry about showing off a ""corny"" Christian movie.  Humor, sadness, anger and joy all make it into the honest questioning of the faith.",1209859200,,662,4.672413793103448
2519696,5,B000EHPXP6,"This is one of the best Christian films we have ever seen in regard to discourse about what is Christianity and who is Jesus Christ.  The film, titled The Perfect Stranger is based on the book titled Dinner With a Perfect Stranger by David Gregory.

  We were startled by how well it was done and the setting which takes place in a restaurant.  Nikki Cominsky is a lawyer and she is having stress with her marriage and child raising.  She receives an invitation from Jesus Christ to have dinner with him at one of her favorite restaurants and thinks it a joke pulled by her husband who had to stand her up that evening.  She finds a well dressed man who identifies himself as Jesus Christ and as a talented lawyer she decides to call his bluff.

  The personalities of the two stars click in a short film with a long message.  Practically every question you would want to cover with Jesus is handled in an understandable and concise way.  Subjects from creation, the crucifixion and resurrection, how Christianity differs from other religions especially Islam, the Trinity to Heaven, eternity  and Hell as well as how to know you are saved.  That's only a few.  It is NOT a dry stuffy discourse, but a conversation between two who become friends.  Yes, it is Jesus Christ and you will love Him even more as you will love the film.

  I am using this in our church and have sent out the above review to everyone on our email list.  I have also bought extra copies as gifts.",1207958400,,1472,4.462406015037594

Both the screenplay and the acting are superb. The characters are believable (and think about how difficult it would be to create a casual role for Jesus). Jefferson Moore does wonderfully and Pamela is awesome.

This running conversation with Jesus is not only perfect for evangelizing friends and family, it will ""evangelize"" the soul of the believer as well. What starts as apologetics ends as personal devotion. Beautiful.

The sequel, Another Perfect Stranger, is moving as well, but hands down I have to give honors to this first episode.

Bravissimo to everyone involved. I'd like to air-drop this over a few nations that come to mind, if not the whole earth.",1200873600,2,907,4.75796178343949

2519739,5,B000EHPXP6,"I first saw 'Perfect Stranger' on TBN one night and was so moved by the exciting message and quality of the production that I had to share it with others. As a matter of fact, I went on to order it the very next day. This movie is a very powerful tool for bringing the message of Christ's unconditional love to those that do not yet know Him while answering many of the basic questions asked by people searching for answers to the problems facing us in today's world. And perhaps finding their own true freedom in the process.

The story revolves around a young wife and mother, Nikki Cominski, caught up in a seemingly no-win marriage where her husband has become aloof and less sensitive to her concerns and needs. And when he opts to forego a long anticipated outing to a restaurant with his wife in favor of watching a ball game that night, the story starts to take shape beautifully.

Nikki is immersed in both anger and frustration on her way to work as a lawyer in a legal firm. Upon arriving there, she spots an invitation on her desk from Jesus Christ to join Him for dinner at the very restaurant that she so much wanted to go to with her husband. She perceives the invitation initially as a joke and then believes it to be a reconciliatory act on the part of her husband to meet him for dinner. It is upon arriving at the restaurant that the rest of this movie becomes most memorable and endearing to believers and non-believers alike; culminating in a wonderful conclusion that will leave many speechless at the end.

This is a great screenplay adaptation written by Jefferson Moore, based on  David Gregory's book 'Dinner With A Perfect Stranger'. The movie also has its humorous moments thrown in as well, making this a well-rounded and thoroughly engaging movie.

Does that bother you?  It should.

It is personally disheartening to me that so many people think this movie, and others like it, is so useful for evangelism when it leaves so many doubtful reviewers confirmed in their unbelief and even some Christians reviewers ashamed.  Are you listening to them?  Do they or what they say matter to you when they explain that they find this Jesus laughably (or sadly) simplistic?  How many who say they loved this film have really had a serious conversation with an unbelieving lawyer?  Did you find them to be the pushover this film suggests?

Hard to find a movie that is not R or PG 13 rated...and this seemed like a different twist, but I did not expect what we delightfully viewed.  We are Videographers (coasttocoastvideo.com & action-vp.com) so we immediately knew this was low budget because they did not use a sound studio or re do the sound especially in the echoes of the kitchen first scene.  Then things improved dramatically. The acting was poor in the kitchen scene and we were skeptical if we would continue it...until we got so fascinated & moved to tears with the conversation in the restaurant.  The acting was wonderful... really awesome.  I repented for not keeping my relationship as close as God provides.  This movie is for everyone...believers, skeptics, critics, those in cults and non-believers.  I hope my children will watch and learn how much God loves them and how we were only created for a relationship with Him and for no other reason, but to know Him and enjoy Him forever.  To avoid, ignore or deny Him is the greatest loss to both Him and us. We are going to buy it to share with as many as we can.

I liked the way the actor playing the Lord subtly slipped in his knowledge of Nikki's past experiences, and only when it was necessary to accomplish something specific. He didn't change the wine into water, as she requested. He only wanted to reach into her heart and draw her to come in and dine with him, to accept the gift Christ paid for with His very life.

This movie has terrible acting, choppy editing and an insipid script. I watched the first half hour of it and I couldn't take it anymore.

I have not read the Bible, and this movie did answer some of my questions and gave me even more questions and answers.  It certainly won't answer every question, and you won't agree with everything they say, but it will at least get you to think more.  Refreshing change of pace, a nice viewing experience.

2519755,5,B000EHPXP6,"OK the acting was not the best in the world, but unless you are used to turning out trashy Hollywood movies on a nearly unlimited budget, the movie has a good message.  Unfortunately, modern man has had his senses bombarded and dulled by the propaganda that God will allow those who believe the liberal church ""shades of gray"" gospel, salvation.  Unfortunately, the Gospel teaches that we must be perfect, in other words, no shades of gray.  We cannot achieve this, but Jesus did, and our belief in His perfect works lands us a trip to Heaven. Where does this land the shades of gray ""believers"" and believers of other false religions?  Sorry, a ticket to hell.  Jesus Himself said that narrow is the way to heaven and few are those who enter it; while the wide road, with its broad Hollywood-like appeal will land many in hell.

That is indeed black and white; the wonderful thing is that I know that Jesus love me and I know that I will be with him someday soon.  For this message I give the movie 5 stars.

I can only hope a lot of people answer the knock at the door. (Rev 3:20)

I just finished watching this movie and I want to see it again. It is powerful! It answers so many questions that people have about God and Jesus. Great for believers, non-believers and seekers.

Definitely watch this movie; you won't be disappointed! Jesus saves, heals, and delivers! Praise be to His Glorious Name :-)",1179705600,4,545,4.333333333333333
2519768,5,B000EHPXP6,"I really liked this DVD, from the actors to the incredible story line.  Some pretty important things stuck in my head, and it reminded me how Jesus hates legalism (how his followers sometimes don't act so Christ-like at times and it confuses non-believers) and it is SO much more important to love people and sometimes uses a tragedy or serious event to turn us to him.  I am glad Jesus loves me and reached out to me....what a FANTASTIC tool to witness to others!  Thanks Jefferson Moore!",1179187200,4,489,4.597701149425287
2519769,1,B000EHPXP6,"A single star review will, I believe, genuinely elicit the expectation that the reviewer is emotionally biased and much too negative... but let me ask you a simple question.  If you were an author with a desire to explore pertinent aspects of the faith you adore through engaging dialogue that might grip others, would you really presume to write the script for the LORD of the universe to follow?  If you would, then I suppose this review is not for you...

In all honesty, as a faithful follower of Christ, I cannot humbly give any more than a star to an author who attempts to write the script for GOD.  In a strange way, it is like a kind of reverse inspiration where a man writes the inspired words for GOD to relay to others, and... as the author is only a man, the end result cannot realistically do better than a star (if that much).  That is a virtual truism.

Now, there's the dilemma, because I don't agree with a good deal that was passed on over ""Jesus'"" side of the table in this film.  Does that mean I disagree with Jesus?  Hardly... only one gentleman's interpretation of Jesus.  I am willing to say that my interpretation is exactly that: my own.  That, in itself, does not make it false or true but it is at least capable of being questioned.  Of course, the author (David Gregory) would probably say that his interpretation can also be challenged, but that is exactly the problem and it is why, I believe, so many Christians are unwilling to critique this movie...  It is because, in the end, it will be said that Mr. Gregory was simply portraying the faith to unbelievers, that he was using a stirring method for introducing the gospel, and that is all that need be said.  But my question is whether Mr. Gregory's portrayal of ""Jesus""--and with ""Him,"" of Christianity itself--was really a very good one.  Was it?  And should it represent the rest of us?

I have been a Protestant Christian apologist for 9 years now.  I have met untold numbers of people who held various opinions about Christianity, its nature, soundness and its usefulness.  Not a few of those people have understood Christianity very much like that basically portrayed by ""Jesus"" in the movie... and they have rejected it.  To be as straightforward as I think I should be here, most non-Christians are neither as simplistic nor as credulous as the woman meant to represent them in the movie.  What is more, the responses of ""Jesus"" to her questions, were they to be passed off to real non-believers, would most often elicit a very different reaction.  I know they would from me and from every person I have ever helped to Christ when they were still non-Christians.

If a modern looking man invited me to a free dinner and told me he was ""Jesus Christ,"" I would certainly be intrigued enough to talk with him, not of course because I thought he really was Christ but because I would be fascinated how a man thought he could (or should) portray Christ to others like myself.  I would have a load of questions for him and I doubt very much that he would have very good answers because, as I said, he is just a man and not Jesus himself and I have been at this kind of thing for a while now... And, more importantly, in the end I would probably do whatever I could to convince this person that, if this were his motive, his chosen method is no way to introduce others to our faith.  It is, because of the nature of its obvious limitations, at best a complete let down.

When a man whom others know to be a professed Christian addresses them with the highest and most ""perfect"" standard he knows, offers them the most beautiful and wisest and most magnificent portrait that can be given, and in the end it rises no higher than an above average intelligent Christian, what can be said for this?  We might say that everyone knows this isn't really Christ, that this is only the mind of the author David Gregory, a piece of semi-elaborate fiction... but then, it must also be said that it is clearly David Gregory's best supposition as to how Christ might appear to any of us at dinner.  I am assuming that Gregory did his best to portray Christ as a ""Perfect Stranger.""

Anyone who loves Christ must be disappointed in the picture that was painted because, no matter how much we like actor Jefferson Moore's character, it wasn't after all really very much like our perfect LORD and it couldn't possibly be... not if Christ really is all that we say He is.  If He isn't far more than what I saw at that table, then we really have nothing to say to the world, no greater hope than they already possess.  And isn't that hidden trade-off, a less-than-perfect stranger, more important than whether Gregory slipped in a little evangelistic message at the end?

Aside from the production values, The Perfect Stranger was a terrible movie on every measure. From direction to acting to screenwriting, the whole film was poorly done. Any unsaved person who happens to be channel-surfing and comes across this stinker won't stick around long enough to hear anything that ""Jesus"" had to say (most of which, by the way, sounded more like a lecture from a first-year seminary student than the omniscient Son of God). In a unispiring performance, the man who plays ""Jesus"" drones on and on about apologetics, evolution, and counterfeit religions like Hinduism and Islam. The conversation between ""Nikki"" and ""Jesus"" is stiff and cerebral. That's not to say, though, that there's no emotion. From the very first scenes, I got the distinct feeling that Nikki needed to be medicated. She just about slips a gear when her child (""Peanut"") takes too long to get ready for school.

I am a born-again Christian and I appreciate the ostensible goal of this film. However, it was a really, really, bad movie. Don't waste your money on this.",1171324800,13,1201,5.096446700507614

2519786,3,B000EHPXP6,"What would you do if a mysterious invitation appeared on your desk at work cordially inviting you to a dinner at a very exclusive and expensive restaurant? You would probably be rather excited, that is until you saw that the invitation came from someone claiming to be Jesus Christ. If the invitation peeked your curiosity and you decided to show up for a free meal and an evening of conversation with this mysterious stranger you better be prepared for the expected, a theological conversation. The rest you can probably guess.

`The Perfect Stranger' released in '05 is what you might describe as a Christian version of `My Dinner with Andre.' Somewhat intrigued by the opportunity to see how a modern day portrayal of Jesus would be handled I decided to give the film a viewing full well knowing that it was first and foremost designed to be an evangelistic tool for the Protestant church.

Watch Jesus grapple with the ultimate questions of life while consuming a meal consisting of artichoke soup, tortellini salad and salmon fillet (Ah.., just like a good Catholic, ordering fish on a Friday);

- Are all religions equally valid?
- Was Mohammad a true prophet?
- Can Hindu cosmology be reconciled with modern scientific theories pertaining to the universe?
- Is there a path to God?
- Is there a Hell?
- What does everyone want most in life?
- And most importantly, how much would Jesus' autograph sell for on E-Bay?

Prepare for an evening of rousing conversation and fine dining sure to satisfy the most discerning pallet. Best of all he's picking up the tab! Don't bother offering to pay, ""It's a gift.""

Seriously, knowing what the parameters and intent of this production I wasn't disappointed. Overall I enjoyed the time spent around the dinner table with the Master. The conversation was crisp and lively though somewhat slanted and the issues were up-to-date with the mentioning of such well known and pertinent personalities as Mother Teresa and Osama Bin Laden. Stop and think about it for a moment, what question would you ask if you had dinner with Jesus of Nazareth?

There's nothing particularly new, complex or revelatory about the information being shared, however if you are unfamiliar with the Christian faith the simple, personal, straight forward presentation of the gospel in this film might appeal to your inquisitive mind.

People are afraid to deal with uncertainty, not realizing the world is full of shades of grey can create a lot of suffering. Conflict arises when people sink their heels in and are unable to open up their minds and hearts to others.

To think that one belief is better than all the rest, is cheating yourself and others. It is really an act of ego and pride, not your heart and love. Anyone who has truly experienced the love of GOD knows it is achieved with the act of letting go, relaxing. A view point that creates tension and black and white views, does not allow this.

If reading this makes you feel tense and irritable, it is likely that you are reacting with pride. You are right and I am wrong. Let go. Be with GOD now by understanding we are all unique and different - and that is OK.

2519811,5,B000EHPXP6,"I have read other reviews that are criticle of this movie. And that would be good.  Except I wish these criticle reviewers had their facts streight when they do a review on this very thought provoking movie.  Read my thoughts below before you see this very worthwile movie.

First; Evolution is a theory supported by some but not ALL scientists. Science has not found the biological mechanism a life form uses to (for example) ""construct"" itself with.  Moreover, if, as they say, in the beginning life started from a single cell to produce every life form on earth, the question of how this is done must be answered. Whatever mechanism is being used - that mechanism in the first place must be very much aware of its enviornment, even at the single cell level.  That same mechanism is responsible for inventing such things as legs, arms, stereoscopic eyes, brains, etc. etc. To create an eye, that mechanism must have gone thru many experiments (like Edison did with his light bulb) before an eye was suitible.  No evidence to date has found such a wide range of expirimentation going on.  Furthermore, that same mechanism must have had a fore-knowledge of the very nature of light and what frequencies it contained before the eye was constructed.  No evidence exists to explain this.  Only bones, and even there, it calls into question how that same mechanism was able to figure out what bone framework was needed, much less know also that it needed a specific density.  So much for Evolution, except to say it is only able to draw inferences similar to what would be the case if in the far future someone found a car encased in ice, but no evidence of any other life form on earth.  That car would be disected almost exactly as the evolutionists do now with the prehistoric life forms.  They would reason that the two headlights were an evolutonary step in the cars construction, nothing more.

Second:Creationism is also a theory with no fundamental, repeatable evidence of how the universe began. There is great controversy within the scientific community about its beginning. In one such case recently described in Scientific American, and other journals, a particle physics experiement is said to be able to show what the universe looked like only a few hundred microseconds after the big bang. It described a very tight ball of engergy so dense that light could not excape it just before it went ""bang.""  Still others, suggest by calculation that the universe has many multiple universes or constructed by so called strings, or black holes.  Yet, none of those theories can explain where the engery came from to form even a single universe in the first place.  Even those of alternate universe theory.

Third, Religion: Or let us say, spiritual thinking created by the mind. Thought has no energy or matter.  The only thing that exists - exists in our mind as thought.  It can not be weighed, it can not be measured, it can not be seen by another observer.  Yet, we all know it exists. You can prove it exists by describing it to someone else who also has a mind to reason and think with, therefore knows it first had also. In this way, religion is like science.  But Religion has a much harder problem explaining things. Evolutionists and creationists can point to something they have physically observed. Those in Religion can show you no such thing. Still, by physical observation and thought, their explaination is that a creator must have made all things, including all life.  Of all the books writen, only the Bible attemps to describe the beginning of time and a creators role in it. There are many scientists who believe what the Bible says. They can not explain all of it, any more than they can the big bang, yet compelling evidence does exist for them to believe in Jesus. And there are many more scientists who just might find some answers in this movie, too.

This movie is the work created by the mind trying to persuade others that Religion (Christianity in particular) does indeed have the answer to everything. Religion has one compelling issue the others do not have.  It claims to have an ""answer,"" the others claim only a theory. If GOD does exist, and according to the Bible He is infinately powerful, all knowing, and has no beginning and no end, the possibilities of what he is capable are therefore endless.  I doubt anyone who ever existed could fathom what GOD is like, much less try to figure out the Bibles ""Trinity.""  But in the Bible, Jesus was the ONLY living person who claimed he ""knew the Father."" And He and the Father are one"". The movie answered this eleoquently and sincerely.  It tackles some tough Mind bending qestions, and provokes some serious thought within the mind about GOD.

Can anyone prove it is true? Can anyone prove it is not?  Can anyone prove evolution and creation beyond a doubt?  No to all of these.  But which one of these settles comfortably in the Mind? Which one is capable of altering the future of you, your kids, grandkids? Which one of these explains GOD the best in human terms?

Look at it this way; If you believe but GOD does not exist, you will never know it when you die. But if you do not believe, and GOD exists when you die, which one of you would make out the best? You have a 50/50 chance.  Which one would you chose? Want to make a bet?",1148947200,13,5321,4.644610458911419

Even though a Catholic she like many have struggled with the concept of Jesus being the only way to God, that the Bible is the authentic Word of God, if God is so loving why is there so much suffering in this world and that just being a ""good"" person qualifies one for heaven regardless of their belief. To our delight (and relief), we came across ""The Perfect Stranger"" in our cable guide. Without all of the typical religious voices of Christian broadcasts this movie simply and cleverly answered our friends questions all within a modern, intimate dinner setting with none other than Jesus, business suit and all.

The thematic of the movie is that it's all about relationship and NOT religion. It's about accepting God's gift of grace to you and not trying to earn God's favor, because...well, you just can't. This ""My Dinner with Andre"" format is both entertaining, challenging and engaging. When the program ended our friend sat in total silence then exclaimed that ""This was an incredible movie"".

She believes that the invitation is really from her husband who feels bad about leaving her alone on a Friday night, so she accepts. When she arrives at the resteraunt she finds instead someone she has never seen before, a man, well dressed, who claims to be Jesus Christ. At first she thinks it's a joke and wants to leave, but hey, why give up a free meal? She goes along with his story that he is Jesus Christ and proceeds to ask him questions about everything she can think of from various religions to the creation of the universe. What follows is one of the most interesting conversations put on film.

Let me state that I am not a born again Christian, but when I first saw this film I was glued to the TV, it is a film that makes you think. It is a film that is entertaining, it is a film that is as interesting to those of you who are not religious as to those of you who are.

I dispute the running time of the movie as listed here. The film times in at about 1 hour and 8 minutes in length. The closing credits include interviews with the stars of the film and the director and clock in at about 17 minutes. For a film that is a little over an hour the price is not bad. There are extra's on the DVD, behind the scenes ect.

If you are still not sure if you should see this keep in mind that it is a little over an hour long. Chances are you've wasted your time being dissapointed with films clocking in at over 2 hours before. The choice is always yours, if you don't like it- return it. Or better yet, because of the price, give it to a friend. I'm sure you know someone out there who would want to see this.",1142726400,137,1779,4.062678062678063
2519827,4,B000EHPXP6,"It seems that I'm kind of like the rest of the reviewers, that I caught the movie by-chance while flipping through the channels. I was scanning the channel guide on T.V. a week ago and seen nothing else worth watching and I decided to turn on TBN. Although the channel guide said that the show ""Praise the Lord"" was on, I knew from previous times that they sometimes play a movie during that time-slot. Now, usually I find a movie that sparks my interest but I become easily tired or bored with it and turn it off within an hour. Not with ""A Perfect Stranger.""

I caught the movie just when He introduced himself as Jesus to Nikki. I was rivetted to my seat from that point forward. The long extensive dialog that took place really captured my interest. I can see how people like Nikki would ask those exact questions. I found the answers compelling, realistic, and things that Jesus might say.

This movie seems to have no specific dogma attached to it, so I imagine it will offend some denominations or certain Christians, but I do pray that this film can be used to bring people to Christ and to strengthen faith of believers. I know it did mine. I'm not a Bible scholar, but I am a born-again, spiritually thirsty Christian who likes to take in possibilities.

I can't put my finger on it but there is something missing in this movie so I only give it four stars. Maybe it's just not exciting enough for my tastes, but I will recommend this movie for Christians and non-Christians alike... especially non-Christians. The theme to this movie is Jn 3:16. I just purchased this DVD myself. I'm so looking forward to it.",1142467200,11,1620,4.503401360544218
2519828,5,B000EHPXP6,"I just happened to catch this movie on tv and loved it. It pushed no church agenda. It just told a story about A God that cares about people on a one to One bases (personally). Who wouldn't want that? Well probably a lot of people, but the movie made that point too. It's your choice. It didn't answer all the questions but then what is Faith for? If I knew all the answers I wouldn't need A God. I'd be god. Is it a correct adaptation of what the Bible teaches about God? Time will tell won't it.

2519829,3,B000EHPXP6,"This movie is a witty, clever presentation of evangelical christianity. It's fun to watch (as a former born-again christian who no longer has much of a tolerance for evangelism of any kind, I caught it on TV while channel flipping and was hooked within the first few minutes) and has much going for it, including pretty darn good acting on the part of Pamela Brumley. Jefferson Moore was also interesting as the italian suit clad, upper class version of Jesus.

As interesting as the movie was to watch, however, there were many problems with the answers Jesus gave to Nikki which, frankly, disappointed me and which I believe detract from the movie's credibility as an evangelical tool (this may be due to weaknesses in the original book, which I have not yet read). In fact, most of the answers Jesus gave to Nikki's doubtful questions were simply the same old circularly reasoned defenses that evangelicals have been regurgitating for centuries, all the while claiming said defenses are perfectly logical and airtight. I'll go through a few of my problems with Jesus's defense of his religion to Nikki, but space will not allow a comprehensive critique.

One of the first things Jesus said at the dinner table that raised my eyebrow was during his examination of Hinduism. Nikki had brought up the fact that the world has so many different religions and mentioned Hiduism as one that should be considered just as good as Christianity. Jesus then, in an attempt to obviate the falseness of Hinduism, claimed that science has proven that the universe had a beginning, and that therefore the Hindu belief that the universe has always existed was obviously false. The problem here is that the science Jesus is relying on to make his point is called the ""Big Bang Theory,"" which is a widely accepted mainstream scientific theory regarding the birth and development of the physical universe, but not one without it's critics (many of whom include creationist christians). Many christians, in fact, have argued that the Big Bang Theory is incompatible with a literal interpretation of the Genesis creation story, and I would agree (for example, Genesis clearly states that the earth was created before the sun and the stars, while the Big Bang states that the earth formed long after the sun and stars). Jesus, however, doesn't address this issue. Jesus's awkward position vis a vis science is further exacerbated when, later in the dinner, Jesus tells Nikki that scientists don't accept the biblical creation story over evolution because they refuse to accept God's authority over them!

So, one mainstream scientific theory (the Big Bang) is good enough to disprove Hiduism, but another mainstream scientific theory (Evolution) is not good enough to disprove Christianity?? Jesus seemed to be selectively using scientific theories that seemingly disprove competing religions, while casually dismissing scientific theories which seemingly disprove his religion. This seemed very hypocritical and the attack on other religions seemed very petty. I think the writers would have been much better off not putting Christianity into a steel cage match with the other great world religions, especially not using science as a club. All religions and supernatural belief systems will inevitably run into severe confrontations with science and rationalism.

Another part of the dinner scene that had me shaking my head was when Nikki asked about the concept of the Trinity. If there is one God, how can there be a father, son, and holy spirit who are all divine? When I heard Nikki ask the question, I prepared myself to hear a long, convoluted explanation of how something that can't possibly be obviously is. But, no, we didn't even get any good theological sophistry. Jesus's answer was simply that Nikki, being human, couldn't possibly understand the Trinity, and so she shouldn't even worry about it. Oh, of course! For millennia, religions of all kinds have always explained apparently nonsensical, illogical doctrines by telling their followers that it's all a great ""mystery"" that's far beyond us poor slobs (a cop-out, in other words). How terribly convenient. For some reason, I was expecting a little more from Armani Jesus on this one, but he let me down.

There were a few other parts of the dinner where Jesus frustrated me, like when he addressed the issue of biblical contradictions by picking an example from scripture that is easily explained while ignoring the real contradictions that bible critics have been pointing out for centuries (this is the Red Herring tactic, which Jesus apparently knows well). Anyone interested can simply google ""bible contradictions"" for several web sites that deal with this fundamental and crucial issue of biblical credibility that has convinced many, including myself, that there is nothing divine about the Bible.

Finally, the movie ends with Jesus walking Nikki to her car and Nikki finally realizing that the man she had just dined with really is Jesus. She emotionally collapses into his arms and thanks him for his sacrifice. This was a truly moving scene that reminded me of how I felt when I first embraced Christ, totally ignorant of Christian scripture and theology. All of those emotions came up to the surface and I teared with her.

Upon finishing the movie, two conclusions of mine that I had come to many years ago were strongly reinforced. The first is that the Christian story (particularly the protestant version) has many truly beautiful elements that make it very attractive and which explain it's great popularity over the centuries. The other is that Christianity also has very many insurmountable logical problems and credibility flaws that make it impossible for most modern people who try to approach things rationally to take it seriously. It's a beautiful fairy tale, but that's all it is.",1141776000,8,5857,5.094791666666667
2519830,5,B000EHPXP6,"I read the book first and I loved it!! I just finished watching the movie on TBN and I was glad to see that they stayed true to the book, almost. They did switched the character- in the book its a man that has dinner with Jesus, in the movie its a woman. No biggie, though, the message is still the same. Jesus loves us so much and He is as real as we allow Him to be. We can go to Him with our doubts and questions and know that He is there to help us through and will give us the answers we seek. Amen!! :)",1141689600,7,508,3.712962962962963

2519833,5,B000EHPXP6,I'm usually leery about movies made from books I've read and loved.  The movie seldom lives up to the book and often changes the story completely.  The Perfect Stranger was the exception to the rule.  The movie was magnificent!  They kept the storyline intact and only made minor adjustments for film.
