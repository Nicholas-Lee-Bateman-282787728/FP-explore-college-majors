8083258,3,B000B86N0W,"I bought this movie because our family loves ""Lion of Judah,"" however, I found that movie was not quite as well done. Still the plot was a nice story and reflects how Christ can redeem even those whom others have given up on.  I think they could have reduced some of the crassness and sarcasm.",1449014400,,293,4.327272727272727

8083261,3,B000B86N0W,It was cute but hardly any bible in it. The story line was simple good for toddlers,1420070400,,83,3.9411764705882355
8083262,2,B000B86N0W,The overall story was good but presented a Christmas story in a rude sarcastic way...no appropriate for small impressionable children,1362441600,3,133,5.7

8083264,4,B000B86N0W,"I enjoyed this short film and while I haven't watched it with kids yet I think they will enjoy it as well.  The characters are funny and memorable, the ""evil"" is foreboding but turns out to be just mis-understood.  The message is clear and not complicated.",1245024000,4,256,4.543478260869565
