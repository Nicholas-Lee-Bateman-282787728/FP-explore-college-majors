8413998,3,B0009UZGJQ,"This DVD contains some fantastic performances particulary from Buju Banton, Turbulence and Anthony B that is at times awe inspiring and makes you realise how great this music is but it is let down by the usual boring and pathetic obsession with Homosexuality that is so damaging to this great music.

Why, when there is so much trouble in the world and people are dying from Aids (and Credit to Turbulence for the condom references), poverty and war do the new breed of Cultural Singers focus so much attention on such a non-issue which so few people (outside of Jamaica) see as a problem. How is spouting off about Homosexuality helping the youth. Or is Homesexuality to blame for the poverty and gun culture wrecking Kingston?

A pity because Jamaica is producing so many talented singers at the moment and this prevents exposure to a wider audience

Having said all that I still recommend the DVD for the music.",1138752000,,914,4.735849056603773

Buju Banton was electrifying, Anthony B lit up the show with nuff fyah tunes and Fantan Mojah who is still coming up in the business showed that even though he does not have a large catalog as the other long-established artists, he already has some of the biggest tunes in the world; he is also a good performer. Assassin, who came on during Buju's act brought on some spice to the show. Richie Spice brought a different style in his performance, but still put on a good act; Chuck Fender was his usual self - poised, good delivery, etc, etc. Sista Carol demonstrated that she is still one of the biggest artists in the business. And even though Queen I-frica was hoarsed and could not perform as her usual self, she is someone to look out for. She has nuff fire in her music........ I give this DVD 4 stars because Jah Mason - whom I believe is still underrated - was not quite on target with his delivery even though a lot of his tunes are well known, while Perfect, who is an upcoming artist, only received respect from the audience since not too many people are familiar with his music. On second thought and if I could, I would probably give it a 4.5 out of 5. Finally, I just want to add that this is a good DVD for any reggae fans. But, this is a must have DVD for all true reggae fans especially those who are in to culture music. Big up Tony Rebel! The show was really NICE......",1124409600,,1507,4.217993079584775
