3446144,5,B001A7GODY,"OMG....I rented this video (1st season) from block buster and I loooved it so much it was so hard for me to return it..I watched it every day for the full 5 days that I rented it, cracking up like it was my first time with each watch. Once I returned it I rented the 2nd season which wasn't as funny as the first but still very entertaining. You can and will NEVER get tired of this video(s).I instantly logged on to Amazon to order it and was soo glad to see that there were other seasons available so I ordered them all. I looove Martin and I love stand up comedy so I have seen them all from Cedric the entertainer, DL Hugley, shaquille oneal all stars, kevin hart etc,etc,etc and NONE I mean NONE of them compare to these videos. Martin did indeed do a good job recruting great comedians! Kudos to u Mr. Lawrence",1283472000,,816,4.203821656050955
3446145,5,B001A7GODY,"I loved this DVD. At 2 o'clock in the morning, I put it on thinking I would doze off to sleep. No way! There were so many funny comedians, I couldn't go to sleep.
If you have a comedy collection, this DVD is an absolute must have edition.
By giving other comedians a chance to shine, Martin Lawrence is following in the footsteps of his mentor, Russell Simmons.",1270857600,,361,4.323529411764706
