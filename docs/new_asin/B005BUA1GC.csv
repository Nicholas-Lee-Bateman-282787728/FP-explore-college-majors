4647779,5,B005BUA1GC,I love this show and glad they made the first season 30 episodes and got a second season and now a 3rd one. I hope they get at least 6 seasons because I love this show and it should continue. I hope the next season gets a dvd release soon.,1351209600,,239,3.8

4647781,5,B005BUA1GC,"Wow, this is really a great show. Big fan of both
Melissa and Joe. I grew up watching both of them
act on different shows I liked as a kid and it is
really nice to see them on another tv sitcom that
is successful. I can't wait for Season 2 to come
out on DVD, and Season 3 to make it's debut on TV.
Def would recommend this title to anyone who wants
a lighthearted laugh.",1348099200,,371,3.831168831168831
4647782,5,B005BUA1GC,I enjoyed the 2nd season of Melissa and Joey. i was disappointed that there was no blooper reel with part two.,1322006400,,110,4.285714285714286
4647783,5,B005BUA1GC,"I've been waiting for this release and couldn't wait to play it the day it came. I love this show very much. So I will rewatch epidodes over and over again.
My point for this review is that THE MAKERS OF THIS DVD SHOULD BE IN TROUBLE!!!

They messed up on their editing of these dvds.

SOME OF THE EPISODES ARE LISTED UNDER WRONG NAMES. FOR EXAMPLE THE EPISODE THE OTHER LONGO IS ON THE DVD AS BEING WAITING FOR MR. RIGHT AS THE TITLE. WHICH THAT EPISODE IS LISTED AS JOE KNOWS WHICH IS THE EPISODE TITLE OF THE LAST EPISODE ON DVD OF MELISSA AND JOEY SEASON ONE PART 1 WHICH IS TOTALLY STUPID... ALSO THE EPISODE LISTED AS THE OTHER LONGO SHOULD BE TITLED ENEMIES WITH BENEFITS. TO ME THIS IS VERY UPSETTING AND I NEVER WRITE REVIEWS ABOUT ANYTHING BUT I COULDN'T LET PEOPLE BUY THIS WITH MISTAKES BEING MAKE BY SHOUT THE MAKER OF THE DVD. THEIR EDITORS NEED TO MAKE SURE THEY CHECK EVERYTHING BEFORE THEY RELEASE A DVD ON THE MARKET.

HERE'S THE DVD LIST OF EPISODES IN ORDER.
1. THE OTHER LONGO. SHOULD BE TITLED ENEMIES WITH BENEFITS.

2. WAITING FOR MR. RIGHT. SHOULD BE TITLED THE OTHER LONGO

3. JOE KNOWS. SHOULD BE TITLED WAITING FOR MR. RIGHT.

4. ALL POLITICS IS LOCAL

5. TOLEDO'S NEXT TOP MODEL

6. AUCTION HERO

7. DONT TRAIN ON MY PARADE

8. JOE VERSUS THE REUNION

9. LOST IN TRANSLATION

10. A HOUSE DIVIDED

11. YOUNG LOVE

12. MEL & JOE'S ANNIVERSARY

13 GOING THE DISTANCE

14. PLAY BALL

15. DO AS I SAY, NOT AS I DID

16. THE MEL WORLD

17. TEACHER/TEACHER

18. THE SETTLEMENT

NOT SURE IF THEY MESSED UP ON OTHER EPISODE TITLES YET BECAUSE I HAVEN'T WATCH THE WHOLE SET YET.
ALL HAVE TO SAY IS I LOVE THIS SHOW JUST WISHED THE MAKERS WOULD TAKE ANOTHER LOOK AT WAHT THEIR MAKING BEFORE RELEASING IT TO THE PUBLIC. SHOUT NEEDS TO FIX THIS PLEASE.
I DON'T KNOW IF THIS WAS JUST MY COPY OR NOT. JUST THOUGHT I'D TELL FANS.",1317772800,14,1842,4.2057142857142855
4647784,5,B005BUA1GC,"Even though ""Season One, Part Two"" doesn't come out until October 4th, I feel compelled to say that the final eighteen episodes of season one are superb, after watching the final two episodes tonight. Shout! Factory, who is releasing ""Melissa & Joey,"" has announced that there will be no special features this time around; however, that shouldn't discourage anyone from buying this set. I have been a fan of Melissa Joan Hart since her days on ""Clarissa Explains It All"" and ""Sabrina, the Teenage Witch,"" and she remains my favorite actress to this day. Regardless of my bias, the series excels mainly due to terrific writing and wonderful acting. The cast meshes so well that the story of this dysfunctional family seems as though it could happen in real life. I can't wait for Season Two to begin airing. But, whenever ABC Family decides to air the show again, I'll be the first one watching. Melissa, you and Joey have struck comedy gold, again.

UPDATE (7/3/12): I am very disappointed that the producers of this DVD set have incorrectly labeled the first three episodes! I have contacted the studio, and they inform me that there are currently no plans to re-release the set or even offer a replacement disc! This is surely not enough for me to lower my rating, because the series is truly 5 stars. However, I wish more time and effort had gone into issuing a release of this excellent series!",1315958400,8,1398,4.729508196721311
4647785,5,B005BUA1GC,Great show!!,1437782400,,12,5.5

4647788,3,B005BUA1GC,"For some reason, ABC Family decided to break up the first season of their sitcom Melissa & Joey into two halves that aired about nine months apart.  They've also released the show on DVD in those parts.  That's why, less than a month after the last episode aired, we get Melissa & Joey Season 1, Part 2 on DVD.  The show continues to be inconsistent, although it is growing on me.

The set up finds Toledo, Ohio, councilwoman Melissa Burke (Melissa Joan Hart) suddenly saddled with her teenage niece Lennox (Taylor Spreitler) and nephew Ryder (Nick Robinson) when her sister and brother-in-law are caught in a Ponzi scheme.  To help this single woman deal with the kids, she hires Joe Longo (Joseph Lawrence) as a manny (male nanny).  Joe is currently down on his luck because he worked for Melissa's relatives and has his reputation ruined in the scandal.  Rounding out the cast is Lucy DeVito in the recurring role of Melissa's assistant Stephanie.

There are eighteen episodes in this ""half"" of the 30 episode first season.  To start things out, Joe thinks his ex-wife wants to get back together.  When Melissa has to work with a businessman who only speaks Japanese, she has to rely on Joe as her translator.  Lennox has the potential to become a model and tries to get a job editing the school's literary blog.  Meanwhile, Ryder gets an obnoxious girlfriend who tries to micromanage his life.

Like many shows, this one is still struggling to find itself in the first season, and that's the case here.  I did feel these episodes showed more promise than those in the first half of the season.  A few produced few if any laughs, but most of them had some moments that truly made me laugh.

The storylines of the episodes are fairly predictable.  They follow traditional sitcom guidelines, so if you are looking for something new or surprising, you won't find it here.  And that predictability is one of the reasons I didn't find certain episodes that funny, the jokes were too predictable.

That predictability also shows up in the Melissa and Joe relationship.  Surprise, we've got a will they/won't they get together chemistry between the two of them.  Actually, that's a part of the show that is really starting to work.  The writers have come up with some great stories that hint at the attraction between the two main characters, but they still find ways to keep them apart.  It's very easy to root for the characters to get together and soon.  Melissa Joan Hart and Joseph Lawrence obviously have a great time playing their chemistry, and those moments are completely believable.

Honestly, most episodes give the adults a plot and the kids a sub-plot, and poor Taylor Spreitler and Nick Robinson aren't given nearly as much to do.  They make the most of what they have, however.  I really do like the storyline they started late in these episodes involving Ryder's obnoxious girlfriend, Holly.  While I didn't like her at first, the way they have played that relationship has provided some of the best laughs.  I hope they keep Rachel G. Fox around as Holly.

While none of Melissa Joan Hart's relatives have shown up yet, Matthew Lawrence appeared as Joe's brother while Andy Lawrence played one of Ryder's teachers.

Speaking of laughs, Joseph Lawrence must have decided to grow his hair back for the first time in years as these episodes aired.  But they don't air in the order filmed because in one episode, he's still bald or has very short hair, and in the next, he's got a full head of hair.  I had lots of fun watching that progression and regression as the episodes aired.

The eighteen episodes from this ""half"" season are included in two discs.  They're wide screen and full surround, but they are all we get.  There's nothing in the way of extras to be found here.

At best, Melissa & Joey is amusing, but part 2 of season 1 shows more promise than the early episodes did.  It still might grow into something worthy of the talents of the cast.",1432425600,,3966,4.677745664739884
