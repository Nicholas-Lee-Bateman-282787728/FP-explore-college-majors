1409663,3,B000059XUR,"If you're a fan of Jet Li or Josephine Siao, you may want to see this no matter what. It's not terrible, but it's a complete letdown compared to The Legend (Fong Sai Yuk). First--the dialogue is often incomprehensible or stupid. This is obviously due to Dimension's ""need"" to match the overdubbing to the movement of the lips. I can't help but think a LOT of meaning has been lost. Second--they recycle some of the same jokes, visual references, and plot devices from the first film (including, geesh, a fight competition for a daughter's hand in marriage). If you've seen the first one recently, you'll be rolling your eyes. Third--this film just doesn't come together like the first one (until the end). It just meanders around--again I wonder if a better translation would help. Fourth--the fight scenes are nowhere near as interesting or exciting as those in the first, with one notable exception: Sai Yuk's entry into the square, blindfolded, packed with swords, guided only by Heaven in his quest to rescue his mother. Now THAT is an awe-inspiring scene. Finally, the ""two wives"" bit was really lame whatever the translation. Note--this review refers specifically to the American release The Legend 2. I would bet cold, hard cash that ""Fong Sai Yuk 2"" is a LOT better.",992217600,,1274,4.875576036866359
1409664,5,B000059XUR,"The Legend 2 is the Disney rerelease of Fong Sai Yuk 2. Fong Sai Yuk 2 is the greatest kung fu movie of all time, better even than Fong Sai Yuk 1, which is saying something. The Disney version of The Legend was decent visually, but they cut way too much out and absolutely ruined the dialog, which is quite important to this movie. As stated elsewhere here, DDDHouse has the originals in DVD format with subtitles--and they cost significantly less than the Disney versions and are even encoded for North America.
Forget Disney. They pulled The Legend 2 because (I suspect) they plan to release it theatrically. I'll be there. But my DVD bucks are going to the original version.",991612800,5,677,4.603305785123967
1409665,4,B000059XUR,"This is one of the best Jet Li films available - it is in the ranks of Fong Sai Yuk (The Legend), Tai Chi Master (Twin Warriors), Swordsman 2, and Fist of Legend.  If you loved The Legend, you're sure to love this sequel.  Buena Vista apparently cancelled this title without warning and without indicating that the release date would come later.  They cut about 6 - 8 minutes out of this one anyway - like they did for the first one, so no big loss.  It's a shame they didn't include the original language also.  It should be a bargain title as barebones as it is.  I'm quite happy with my copy of Fong Sai Yuk that I got at DDDHouse.  If you want to stick it to Buena Vista and Disney, then buy Tai Seng versions of these films or else the HK versions like Mega Star, Universe, or Mei Ah.",990057600,3,789,4.117647058823529
1409666,4,B000059XUR,"The story isn't as great s the story in The Legend, but The Legend 2 continues with the tale of Fong Sai Yuk as her pursues matters as a member of the Red Flower Society.  The martial arts are excellent, as usual.",989366400,,213,4.071428571428571

1409668,5,B000059XUR,this is one of the best movies Jet Li has played in. I have seen most of his movies and it's one of the best. It has everything in it from comedy to very good martial arts fighting. A lot of wire work but very good. And the endign is one of the best fighting movies you ever going to see. I have the dvd and it's very good.,985824000,3,323,3.6956521739130435

7934317,4,B000059XUR,"NOOOO...this movie isn't based on some anime film. NO NO NO!, but it unfolds like a hilariously awesome classic the likes of which ive only seen from old school anime films of the late 80s/early 90s.

If the matrix was suppost to be a Ghost In The Shell rip off, then this film, The Legend 2, embodies even more of what the matrix was supposivly influenced by.

 NOOOO...this is not a cold hearted all serious flick...it doesnt take it self overly seriously...yet it is at the same time quite INSPIRING...

Now this is the genuis of this little film, its not this masterwork of film making...yet it has times of genuine hilarity, while still stirring your spirit in awe. Something like this can be a little toung-n-check, yet still evokes one's admiration.

 Without sounding to lofty on the descriptions here, people, The Legend 2 might of not been exactly like the chinese language version...But it is very memorable in its own right...

 The voice actors behind the talented cast here are some from the finest films in Japanese Anime...thats right...you might notice some from Ninja Scroll...Project A-Ko...and MORE...These voice actors bring that comprehensive hilarity to the screen....Yes, sorry if i sound like a washed up editoral hack...but bare with me...

For instance... When the men tease Fong about him following his mother around...its just random and so damn funny. And the main bad guy, is great...he's a frstrated bully of a character who at times won't relent at insulting Fong about his closeness to his mom.

 And speaking of which , Fong and his ""legendary"" mom are one funny duo. And so is the man who sorta looks after Fong, who was the mothers ex lover i think. He has a funny deep serious voice.

The action looks like it inspires the great anime films...thats right...not inspired by the anime...it seems like it would INSPIRE the anime world itself...It doesnt draw influence from great anime, but i bet films like this inspire japanese artists to create great anime series and stories!

 You might not understand all this, but its a different take , a unique review of the film that no one has noticed yet on amazon, for this film anyways.

 Sure, this english dub, American version of the film isn't true to the original...But i remember seeing this on tv...and it was even more edited than this im sure...and it was awesome...i taped it...but lost it i think, but now i finally have it, in its entirity.

 This film embodies a lot of what makes Kung Fu films so loveable and great. HUMOROUS CHARACTERS, AWESOME ACTION, INSPRING STYLIZATION.

The scene where Fong walks slowly into battle as the colorfull pedals or leaves fall and float down from the sky is just beautifull and has power,cinematographically.....if thats a word, hahaha.

 This is a classic...it melds together serious inspiring action and laugh out loud hilarity.

 And i haven't even seen the first movie yet.

Hope this helped ya out in deciding if you wanna get this movie or not. Its not too expensive...when you buy it, just don't expect some oscar winning film...it aint...its not the greatest film ever produced...

IT DOESNT HAVE TO BE.",1170028800,,3142,4.8389513108614235
7934318,3,B000059XUR,"This movie is ok in its own right, with spectacular fighting scenes, but I confess I was a bit disappointed since it looks more like a remake of Fong Sai Yuk than its sequel. In the first movie Sai Yuk wins a wife in a kung fu fight, here it wins another one..... and then he saves one of his parents from being executed (the father in the first part, the mather here). All fights are excellent and comedy is ok, although I preferred the gags in the first movie: here some of them get ways too silly, like Sai Yuk's mother believing of being 9th month pregnant just after a few days.....
Overall, I think this movie can be recommended only to true Jet's fans (they will not be disappointed!): for anyone else, the original Fong Sai Yuk (aka The legend) is probably a better choice to enjoy one of the best HK action movies made so far.",1089676800,2,835,4.2578616352201255
7934319,5,B000059XUR,I love this movie and the original. The fight scenes are great. Very cool to watch. This one has a better store then the original. Jet Li is so fast that you almost belive he could beat up that many people at once and the lady that plays his Mom is great too.,1085184000,2,259,3.9056603773584904
7934320,5,B000059XUR,"Not many Kung-Fu flims can combine comedy with good action, a gripping storyline, amazing action, and hilariously funny, The Legend 2 is fantastic.
  Although the story line is almost a typical Kung-Fu flim, it is very different, leaving you breathless, either because of the powerful action scenes or hilarious comedy scenes.
 I can't see why any body should dislkike this film.",1066608000,,379,5.180327868852459
7934321,3,B000059XUR,"I truely enjoyed The Legend, but The Legend 2 was lacking something that the original movie had.
The thing that really annoys me though, is that there is no original language track, and Dubbing is never very accurate.",1020556800,,217,4.7368421052631575
7934322,1,B000059XUR,"Fong Sai Yuk 2 is my favorite Jet Li movie bar none. I'd give it 6 stars out of 5. Why do I enjoy it so much? Because in addition to a lot of wonderful over the top martial arts you get a tremendous amount of hilarity and top shelf comedic acting from both Jet Li and Josephine Siao, who plays his mother. Sadly, the english dubbing of this version of the movie re-titled apparently at random by Disney as ""The Legend 2"" eliminates Li and Siao's priceless performances. What you get instead is 10th rate otherwise-unemployed American actors stumbling their way through a lot of generic, sanitized dialogue in the footage which remains after much of the comedy has been edited out. That's right, actual footage has been edited out of this version. Sheesh. Do yourself a huge favor and avoid this version of the movie. Look for the original language, subtitled, uncut version entitled ""Fong Sai Yuk 2"" which is available from various online sources.",1016150400,11,947,4.676646706586826
7934323,5,B000059XUR,"I have not seen this US version of the movie, but the original Legend of Fong Sai Yuk II.  Jet Li and cast create yet another martial arts masterpiece with great acting, conflict, and of course, fighting.
This is one of my favorite series from Li; very humorous and action packed.  It just goes to show that being a martial arts master with a mother who knows 10 times more than you about martial arts can be real pain in the butt sometimes.",1010188800,2,441,4.301204819277109
7934324,4,B000059XUR,"I am now totally conviced that original language is very important for any martial arts movie...although this dvd has great sound, the fact that voice overs were none of the original actors started to really annoy me...im sorry, but i cant stand it when theres someone else dubbing over for jet li cuz it just sounds stupid...it takes away all the original emotion of his talking...so I instead replaced it with the original Fong Sai Yuk II, the HK version...100% complete and better...not only that, but i discovered that the American release did cut a lot of great humor between Fong and his mother as well as other speeches...considering how rare this american release is, i got lots of money for it too on ebay, and i immediately replaced it with the original...i suggest you do the same if you hate hearing a fake jet...dubs just doesnt cut it for me now...nonetheless, this is a classic martial arts movie and the best of the two Fong Sai Yuk films...if superior sound and picture clarity is a super big deal, then get the american release The Legend 2 if it ever comes out, but if you want originality and a decent picture and sound(it's 5.1 DD too, not as high as the american one, but loud enough), then get the HK version...I'll give the HK Fong Sai Yuk 5 stars in a quick second...laters",1007510400,7,1298,4.575107296137339
7934325,4,B000059XUR,"This is definitely one of Jet's finer movies, much better than the first one...The Legend(Fong Sai Yuk)...what can i say about the dubbing, i mean conversion wise it is truly one of the worst. I mean so much was left out from the HK version. However, the English dub was hilarious on its own based on how badly it was done. Now the action, this film had much better and much more fighting than the first. If you want to see another title like Fist of Legend or Twin Warriors, The Legend series (or Fong Sai Yuk for those originals seekers)are worthy titles. I prefered The Legend series over the original Fong Sai Yuk for the audio. 5.1 baby!!!From what I heard, The Legend 2 was delayed from releasing, but i was able to get mine from a store who didn't quite get that news yet. Here's a little tidbit for those interested in getting this title, check out the Suncoast Video store,if you got one in your area,because thats where i got mine. Apparently they weren't sent the word to return those dvds. But in conclusion, a great movie with a pathetic but amusing dub. The second Fong is far better than the first action-wise, but not plot-wise(decent enough tho).But both titles should be watch, one can't survive without the other. Good luck to those who are searching for this title.",992217600,,1285,4.543103448275862
