2378947,3,B000A7Q1Y2,"This box set includes the first 3 species movies all in good quality and anamorphic widescreen. The trilogy also includes a bonus disc which goes behind the scenes of all 3 films. Now how good are they? Well if you are expecting a masterpiece like alien or a solid action flick like predator than this is not for you. But if you want to sit down and have a good time making fun of cheesy looking aliens who all they want to is mate than look no further this is trilogy is for you

SPECIES (1995)-R-WIDESCREEN (2:35:1)
The first one in the series is the best one; it begins with a laboratory experiment gone wrong. From that experiment we are given Sil a beautiful seductive female alien in the outside but a tentacle ugly alien in the inside. The movie is cheesy but can be taken seriously at some points.

MY PERSONAL RATING: 2  OUT OF 5

SPECIES II (1998)-R- WIDESCREEN (1:85:1)
The first sequel falls down into oblivion; it has no real plot, things just randomly happen, and because the movie lacks real plot it all gets substituted with gore.

MY PERSONAL RATING: 1  OUT OF 5

SPECIES III (2004)-UNRATED- WIDESCREEN (1:77:1)
The second sequel does some improvement over the second but don't expect much. it continues where the first one left of, with the body of eve being loaded in to the military truck for further investigation. It still bad and corny and at times suffers from bad lighting.

MY PERSONAL RATING: 1  OUT OF 5

2378948,3,B000A7Q1Y2,"If crazed scientists and unrealistic plot lines combined with great special effects are your bag, then the Species Trilogy is worth your while.  H.R. Giger designed the alien and the special effects are done realistically.  Very little CGI stuff here so the Species flicks look like real movies, not glorified cartoons.

The first movie, Species is a pretty decent film.  The cast is somewhat of a mixed bag.  Hack actor Michael Madsen is cast as the government fixer. Forest Whitaker, an up and coming actor provides a sympathetic figure. The always great Ben Kingsley provides some great one-liners to lighten things up a bit.  Natasha Henstridge gives the best performance of her career as a genetically engineered ""human"" beauty.  This is a fun flick.

Species II is a continuation of the story with a somewhat higher level of acting and scientifically implausible script.  The special effects even better than in the first. This is a rare sequel that is even better than the original.

Species III is the worst of the trilogy.  It provides a poor finish to the trilogy's story and the movie as a whole is awful. The producers opted for cheap actors and even worse special effects. The script takes  what was already a scientifically implausible scenario and brings it past the point where the suspension of disbelief ends.

As a whole, this is a moderately worthwhile trilogy in that it does offer some mindless escapism and unintentional laughs.  Its best to rent out one of the Species flicks first before deciding on whether or not to buy the trilogy as a whole.",1175731200,2,1570,4.853383458646617
2378949,4,B000A7Q1Y2,"STOP! If the title of this review sounds bad, stop reading and find a serious movie.  However, if science running amok, aliens and eye candy sound like fun read on.  Species is a three movie set with a filler DVD of maybes.  H.R. Giger did the design of the alien and the special effects while not great by today's standards are very good.

The first move, SPECIES is the best of the group.  The cast is excellent actors, all being second leads or the starts buddy.  Michael Madsen, a great tuff guy actor, is the government fixer.  Forest Whitaker, one of America's best actors, is the empathy.  Ben Kingsley, always an excellent performance, feeds Madsen some great one-liners.  Natasha Henstridge provides the eye candy as the alien driven to reproduce.  For the type of film, this is a five-star movie and great fun.

SPECIES II was released three years later, with Michael Madsen, Marg Helgenberger and Natasha Henstridge, repeating their roles from the first film.  The producers continued to cast top quality actors in almost all the roles.  The story is a continuation of the first movie with a couple of new twists.  The dialog starts to slip and gore is used as a substitute.  The special effects are above average, with the ending making the movie.  This is a three or four-star film depending on how much you liked the first film.

SPECIES III was released nine years after the first film.  While providing a continuation of and ending to the story, the film is a cheap knock off production.  The producers stopped using quality character actors and went with inexpensive.  The dialog drops badly and the story line has real problems with reality.  However, they do answer questions raised in Species II and that makes it worth watching.  This is a two or three-star movie depending on how much you like the first two.

Is the series worth it?  Yes, if you like movies with mad scientist, aliens & eye candy.  Overall, I rate this three and a half stars, which Amazon rounds up to four.",1169942400,21,1998,4.672413793103448
2378950,3,B000A7Q1Y2,"The entire trilogy of ""Species"" held such a tremendous potential to be a great sci-fi set of films, and go down in sci-fi history as one of the greats of all time. But, the screen writers, director, and producers instead went for flash-in-the-pan sensationalizm and totally forgot about putting any real effort into the ""sci"" of sci-fi.  There were so many self-made contradictions within the story line, and outright anti-scientific foolishness, that these errors almost totally destroyed the films' worth.  The saving grace of the films is that the storyline - as hard as the makers of these films tried to trash it - still came through as moderately entertaining, and the female nudity in the films was indeed exquisite; some of the absolute best female nudity you will ever see in any film. These two factors saved it from being a ""1"", and boosted the films to getting a 3 star rating from me.  It's a good set of films to have on in the TV room during a party, but for ""great"" movie entertainment, you'll have to look elsewhere.",1143158400,,1033,4.696132596685083

2378952,1,B000A7Q1Y2,"The Species trilogy is arguably one of the worst franchises ever. The films all follow the exact same premise: there's an ultra-hot alien babe with a sex drive that would put rabbits to shame, and she's running around trying to screw every man she meets. You have to wonder what lonely pizza-faced eighth-grader came up with this garbage, or what pot-smoking Hollywood big-shot decided that it should be done another two times. Actually, Species 3 isn't completely horrible. The main character in that one is slightly interesting, and the movie's emphasis is much less on the hot alien sex.",1126828800,4,590,4.96969696969697

2378974,4,B000A7Q1Y2,"None of the Species movies, except the 1st one, are worth buying individually. The first is the best. It has a good cast, an intense story, and the action has a point. The other movies are much weaker in every aspect. I do recommend this DVD set. The 2nd and 3rd movies aren't bad, but unless you're getting them together they are not worth the money. So if you're gonna buy the 1st film, you may as well get #2 and #3. The 4th movie isn't in this set, but that's okay. It's not even worth watching. This is a good set, and I recommend it to any Sci-fi/action enthusiast.",1354233600,,571,4.2
2378975,5,B000A7Q1Y2,"I got this four disc collection at Kmart, $16.00. All disc's were in perfect condition. The original episode is definitely the best, but isn't that how it usually goes. However, I still found 2, 3 and 4 entertaining. The storylines are basically the same, with slightly different scenario's. I guess it depends on what you're looking for in a movie, for me, these are kickback and enjoy, without to pay to much attention. The ladies are grade A eye candy, nice looking, great bodies, and nicely breasted. I enjoy a movie with naked ladies, and there is just enough nudity to keep one interested, without it being overdone. Sometime's it's nice to get a movie that you don't have to analyse ever part of it to enjoy it. Easy watching, I'm glad I bought it.",1329782400,10,755,4.6
2378976,3,B000A7Q1Y2,"This set comes in a flimsy slipcase with nice artwork and contains four standard-size Amaray DVD cases. The discs I received were shoddily made and sloppily handled. Two of them were riddled with fingerprints and one (Species II) had multiple scratches. Back they went, and the replacement set fared minimally better: though unscratched, one disc (Species II, again) had smudges and two others had cloudy swirls between the polycarbonate layers. Though playback may not be affected, these flaws aren't acceptable.

As for the films, they vary in quality:

Species: Engaging, suspenseful film with top-notch special effects. The 2.35:1 picture is sharp, with solid blacks and very good contrast. The extras are largely forgettable.

Species II: Inferior to its forerunner in every way.

Species III: Enjoyable for the most part, decent story line, crisp picture. There are some nicely shot nude scenes, especially the one with brunette hottie Amelia Cooke sauntering down a hallway in her birthday suit.

Species IV: This final release has a razor-sharp 1.78:1 picture but little else to offer: hardly any action and scant nudity. Nevertheless, it manages to be mildly entertaining, mostly because of Helena Mattson's and Marlene Favela's solid acting and good looks.

In sum, this set is worthwhile only for the sci-fi completist who can get it at a bargain price from a seller with a good return policy (like Amazon), should the discs arrive marred. For everyone else, only Species I and III are worth watching, making this four-movie collection superfluous.",1325030400,6,1559,5.266129032258065

8075928,4,B000A7Q1Y2,"Species:The Trilogy contains the first three of the franchise,and the best,in my opinion. All three have the actress that made the role hers,Natasha Henstridge,in them. As with their filming,the three slowly deteriorate in quality with each successive film. However the concept was original and while they don't hold up today as well as they might,they are still enjoyable Sci-Fi.
Species(released July/95)stars,besides Natasha,a stellar cast which includes  Ben Kingsley, Michael Madsen, Alfred Molina, Forest Whitaker and  Marg Helgenberger. The story finds Kingsley as head of a Government program which has successfully spliced human DNA with alien DNA,and created ""Sil""(Henstridge).A ""recipe"" received through SETI;a recipe for disaster. Kingsley realizes this and tries to gas her. She escapes. Running throughout the film, she is finally tracked to a sewer where she has given birth. She is""killed"" and so is her offspring. The film ends as a sewer rat munching on some alien leftovers starts to mutate. This is the one that started it all and it has a power house cast and script. 4 stars.
Species 2(released April/98)stars,Henstridge,Michael Madsen, Marg Helgenberger and James Cromwell. This film finds a three man crew going to and coming back from Mars(two men and one woman).For a seven minute period NASA loses communications with the space craft. They arrive on Earth and it soon becomes apparent they have brought back something they shouldn't have. The female and one male astronaut have the same kind of strain in them as Sil from the previous film. In fact in this film Sil's dead corpse provided enough DNA so they could clone a look alike and call her Eve(Henstridge).Eve spends most of the film trying to link telepathically with the infected male astronaut who is copulating and producing a horde of alien kids. They finally track the astronaut down and while he kills Eve,they get him also. As she is being taken away she is giving birth. This film finds three of the original stars on board again,which helps the weaker plot. There is a cameo appearance by Joe Boyle who is a former Government employee who is now confined to a  mental facility ,decrying that he told them not to go to Mars. Three stars.
Species 3(released Nov/04)stars,among others,Henstridge, Robin Dunne, Robert Knepper and Sunny Mabrey. This film starts where the last one left off with some military types returning Eve's body(Henstridge) to a lab. Along the way the driver detours off the road,to the bewilderment of his passenger. Suddenly the latter is killed from behind by Eve's offspring. He gets out to witness an alive Eve giving birth to yet another child. The first one kills Eve and the ""military""man runs off with the newborn. We soon find that he is a professor at a University who wants to study the alien hybrid. We also find when this alien girl matures she becomes a lightning rod for all other half breeds/hybrids,which are slowly dying but want to mate with her. The film's climax occurs in a nuclear facility where a dying hybrid,who killed the professor,is now after his assistant. He is saved by the professors alien. He creates a mate for her(a sterile one!) and the two walk off together. The weakest of the three this film suffers from trying to do too much. Henstridge is only seen at the beginning. 2 1/2-3 stars.
Technically speaking Species one and three are w/s,while Species two is both w/s and f/s. All prints are very good and clean and crisp. Each film has its own extras and there is a fourth disc included which has around seven featurettes and an alternate ending to the original film. Here is something important to know. There is a FLAW in Species one,which is probably why MGM pulled this set off the shelves. You will hit play and not hear anything. You have to go to your audio button and keep hitting it until you find the track that your player will read to go along with the film.
In conclusion this is a good set to get the best of the Species franchise. The quality goes downhill in order of the films,but overall they are good and at least passable Sci-Fi. The bonus disc has everything you wanted to know about Species and then some. The S/FX don't hold up quite as well as they once did due to the terrific advances since then. And of course be mindful of the TECHNICAL FLAW in disc one before considering this set. 3 1/2-4 stars.",1483660800,,4377,4.833333333333333
