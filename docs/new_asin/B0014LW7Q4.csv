8326098,5,B0014LW7Q4,"This is a well done early 1990s documentary about the life and times of Robert F. Kennedy because it is filled with interviews with family, friends and colleagues.  There is motion picture film we have seen before in other programs and some film that has not been shown too often. Seeing this 2 hour programs reminds me how much we lost with Kennedy's death in 1968.  We could use more politicians like RFK.  He was a tough man who get things done-attacking successfully mafia corruption in business and labor in the 1950s.  After JFK's 1963 assassination, RFK knew real pain, suffering and sorrow that led him to become more sympathetic and empathetic than ever before towards people suffer in America.  This RFK of 1964 to 1968 is best remembered in his riveting speeches during the 1968 presidential campaign.",1419292800,,812,4.855072463768116
