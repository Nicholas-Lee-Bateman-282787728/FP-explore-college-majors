8340762,5,B001T852SW,"This outstanding historical feature documentary DVD (two discs; four parts, 50-minutes each) is a Jerzy Hoffman film--his films have received numerous awards, including:  Oberhausen, Venice, and Moscow IFF.  In 2006, he was honored with ""Eagle,"" the Polish Film Academy Award for Life Achievement.  In 2008, he directed and produced ""Ukraine.  The Birth of a Nation.""  Hoffman is a recipient of the highest state honors both in Poland and in Ukraine.

Director/Producer/co-Scriptwriter Hoffman is a Pole born in Cracow, Poland in 1932; in 1940, he was deported together with his parents to Siberia; in 1955, he graduated from the National Film Institute in Moscow, USSR (WGiK). Today, he is one of the most revered Polish filmmakers.  His works include over thirty documentaries and thirteen feature films, including the Academy-nominated Deluge and With Fire and Sword, the largest film production in Polish film industry.

Critically-acclaimed author of ""Ukraine:  A History,"" Professor Orest Subtelny critiques this DVD as:  ""A professionally-made, interesting, generally balanced and informative documentary film that covers all of Ukrainian history; it contains rare film footage, good cinematography and Hoffman's perceptive summaries of distinct historical periods. Well-worth having!""

The Ukrainian Film Club of Columbia University states, in part:  ""Mr. Hoffman's love for Ukraine, obvious to anyone who can see and hear, does not compromise his level-headed depiction of even the most controversial aspects of Ukraine's history. This film is both a great introduction for novices and a summary for those who already know a lot. It's a must have for everybody who takes interest in Ukraine.""

Made and printed in Poland, ""Ukraine.  The Birth of a Nation,"" is distributed in Canada and the U.S. through Yevshan.  Lacking subtitles, the original language is in Polish (Jerzy Hoffman narrates intermittently throughout); voiceovers are available in English, Ukrainian, and Russian.

If future editions are released (and, I hope that they are), I'd definitely like to see subtitles (not only are they an aid for the hearing-impaired, but also they provide a visual aid for anyone wishing to explore in greater detail some facet of history which is referenced).  The subtitles should have spellings of Ukrainian cities (Kyiv, Lviv, etc.), rivers (Dnipro, Dnister), and other terminology written in Ukrainian; and, the voiceovers should have pronunciations in Ukrainian, not in Russian (Kiev and Dnieper are Russian spellings and pronunciations).  Perhaps, English-speaking Ukrainians should read the English narratives, since other nationals usually have an accent, and, in the process, confusion may ensue.

A glaring error is the usage of the phrase ""the Ukraine,"" and needs to be corrected to read ""Ukraine"" (both in the written words and in the pronunciation throughout)--the country name is one word, ""Ukraine.""  Throughout the film, the narrator erroneously states ""the Ukraine"" rather than one word ""Ukraine.""  The DVD jacket shows ""Ukraine""; however, the opening title shows ""The Ukraine.  The Birth of a Nation,"" and, the caption shows ""Film 1, From Rus to the Ukraine.""  Perhaps, the error was caught after the DVDs were burned, and that's the reason why only the DVD jacket reflects the correction.

This professional production is enhanced with maps, Ukrainian music, photos, film footage, crisp colors, fast-paced presentations, transitions, and, most importantly, balanced and informative narrative (caveat:  country name is one word ""Ukraine"").

Scientific consultants for this film include:  Professor Roman Szporluk, Professor George Grabowycz, Professor Serhij Plochij, Professor Oleksij Toloczko, Dr. Hab Ola Hnatiuk, Professor Borys Woznickij, Professor Jurij Czarnobaj, and Janusz Pulnar.

In 2004, Jerzy Hoffman read a book by Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma entitled, ""Ukraine is not Russia.""  The title surprised him, since, as he said, ""Poles know that Ukraine is Ukraine and Russia is Russia.""  It was while  reading that book that an idea occurred to him--why not investigate the Ukrainian nation?  And, thus, Kuchma's book became the inspiration for making this feature film historical documentary.  Watching this film, it's evident that it was a labor of love.

Enjoy exploring Ukraine's unique history  la cinema, however, mind the caveat throughout--it's one word--""Ukraine.""  If it's not available for purchase, get a copy from your library or through interlibrary loan.  Then, keep checking Amazon; for once you watch this documentary, without a doubt, you'll want your very own copy.  This highly-recommended feature documentary DVD should be in libraries worldwide--both personal and public.

Addendum: Readers, you're invited to visit each of my reviews--most of them have photos that I took in Ukraine (over 600)--you'll learn lots about Ukraine and Ukrainians. The image gallery shows smaller photos, which are out of sequence. The preferable way is to see each review through my profile page since photos that are germane to that particular book/VHS/DVD are posted there with notes and are in sequential order.

To visit my reviews: click on my pseudonym, Mandrivnyk, to get to my profile page; click on the tab called review; scroll to the bottom of the section, and click on see all reviews; click on each title, and on the left-hand side, click on see all images. The thumbnail images at the top of the page show whether photos have notes; roll your mouse over the image to find notes posted.

8340763,4,B001T852SW,"Three stars or four?  Three stars or four?  I agonized a bit over this decision before finally settling on four only because of the novelty and ambition of the project as a whole.  And, while there is much to recommend about this four part DVD set, there are very deep flaws in style and substance that occasionally make ""THE Ukraine: the Birth of a Nation"" borderline unwatchable.

Judging by the names in the opening credits, this was made by a Polish production company. There's nothing wrong with this (of course), but in style the script (at least in the English version that I saw) does not meet the overall quality standards of a western production.  Basically, it reads like something between a Wikipedia article, a badly written masters thesis (complete with context-less, assertive quotes from people who don't matter), and the Soviet ""droning on"" method of giving ""formal"" speeches.  With regards to the latter point, unfortunately too many people from former Warsaw-pact countries continue to confuse being dull and reciting rote facts with being ""informative"" and ""academic"", and ""THE Ukraine, the birth of a nation"" is quite guilty of this, and that they choose a doubtlessly very well read but monumentally dull and uncharismatic professor to be the ""go to academic"" voice in the whole thing hurts the effort further.

At the end of the day, what this video gives us is a very dry reading of Ukrainian history that is broadly sympathetic to the Ukrainian cause but without going too overboard.  In this, there are some novel achievements.  If you want to see a good chunk of Ukrainian history compressed into 50 minutes or so, then part 2 is for you and there's certainly something to be said for some of the more interesting visual images used to illustrate this.  However, had I not already a ""top 1%"" knowledge of Ukrainian history, I'd be hard pressed to remember ANYTHING from the whirlwind tour provided - it's like drinking from a firehose.  That the English-language narrator is chronically able to pronounce neither English nor Ukrainian words and names correctly  despite the pretense of a pseudo-posh English accent makes things worse.  Surely, instead of sourcing a (I suspect) Pole for the English voiceover track the producers could have asked the Ukrainians at Harvard or Cambridge to lend a native English speaker?  There would have been plenty of volunteers.

Here's a flavor:

At one point, Shevchenko is discussed.  The narrator describes his work: ""Some fragments of his poetry sounded so heretical and revolutionary that they could only be published after the revolution of 1905. Having finished his studies, Shevchenko returned to the Ukraine.  He joined the Cyril and Methodius brotherhood in Kiev.  Professor Kostomarov and writer Kulish were the major figures in this brotherhood.  It also comprised a group of students in Kiev University.  At present, the national University of Kiev bears the name of Taras Shevchenko.  {Dull professor speaks:} 'the program of the brotherhood was reflected in the ''Book of Genesis of the Ukrainian People'' modelled according to the work of Adam Mitzkevich.'""

So, in the space of a few seconds, Kostomarov, Kulish, and Mitzkevich are name dropped (there are no further references to them).  We a sidetracked to get a bit of trivia about the present-day university in Kiev.  Meanwhile, a golden opportunity is lost to actually give the viewer an actual taste of Shevchenko's ""heretical and revolutionary"" poetry.  Had the producers just slowed down and thought about what they actually wished to convey, they could have taught a lot more by saying a lot less.

Who will benefit from this video?  Ukrainians in Ukraine who have the interest and patience to watch it may well be the primary beneficiaries - this speaks to the paucity, slant, and poor quality of other general histories available to them.  Some Ukrainian diaspora students preparing for ""matura"" or similar baccalaureate examinations may also benefit from this as if they pause the video at key points and pick out the various key names it may help put some things into an overall context, though, if your ""Matura"" is anything like mine was many years ago, you'd best be careful about repeating (true!) things mentioned in the movie such as that the defining characteristic of Ivan Franko was that he was a socialist radical, even if he was an anti-Marxist.

If you are looking for a video that will allow you to chat up a cute Ukrainian girl or boy with your knowledge of Ukrainian history and culture, well.. the target should be very cute indeed to justify your hard slog ahead.  And, in case it's not obvious already, if you harbor any illusions that you can simply drop off this video set on the doorstep of even an open-minded and intellectual Russian nationalist and hope to in so doing convincing them of the legitimacy of the Ukrainian cause, forget them now - it won't work.

Is there good to be gotten from this video?  yes, of course. But that such a semi-professional production is in effect the current champion of telling the Ukrainian story on film really hits at the core message of this story - Ukraine is a very old nation that is still seeking legitimacy.

one postscript: while a small number of modern academics (and I have no idea this includes  Roman Sporzluk, who is mentioned in the film's typical butchered English as a 'scientific consultant' to the project) have no problems with the term ""the Ukraine"", it's pretty well common knowledge that a large number of people find the definite article to be in effect a diminutive.  Even the BBC has finally wised up and has stopped with ""the"" Ukraine.  That this film continues to use ""the"" throughout the work (including in the title on the cover - while in amazon it's not listed as such, if you look closely at the cover you will see it there in the product's logo) is a testament to its occasional cluelessness.

Umm.. it seems like I've spent too much time being negative.  But, don't forget, I've given this 4/5, so I must clearly see some value in this.  If you've made it this far, you may want to give it a try anyway.",1259539200,6,6140,4.866346153846154
