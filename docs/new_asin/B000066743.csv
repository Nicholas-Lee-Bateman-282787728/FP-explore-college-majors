1711838,3,B000066743,"As a 20-plus year fan, and (very)occasional associate of Mr. Rundgren, I can say that a Todd show rarely disappoints. Oh, sure there are the folks in the nightclub audience who only came to hear ""Hello, It's me"", and ""Bang the Drum"", who go home comfused and a little pissed if he passes those gems over for deeper, more satisfying chunks from his vaults. I'm going to be honest, and give you my beefs with this one.
  Firstly, throughout the video, there are white subtitles which appear in the top screen corner, reminding you that this video is from a show in Ohio (Columbus or Cincinatti,I was too disgusted to write it down).I hate to nitpick, but I was looking for a hometown show, in front a hometown crowd (Todd is a recently transplanted San Fransiscan), but there is none of that energy here. Secondly, as anyone who has seen Todd in the past can attest, the stripped-down, trio format of this gig, is a dissapointment in contrast to his 'mini-orchestra' shows from the '2nd Wind' and 'Nearly Human' tours. I hope that Image will at least repackage this one in a more honest manner.
Two thumbs out!!!",1026345600,3,1110,4.601010101010101
1711839,4,B000066743,"This is probably the most interesting Todd delivery since 1990's Japan concert.  A powerful set of not too common songs as anyone would have expected, backed by a powerful duo on bass and drums  in a very intimate enviroment.  The results are amazing, proof that time has no effect on Todd's ability to write and perform great music.
About the DVD.  Sound quality exceptional, but the video is below average and there are no extra stuff.
At the end of the day, thanks Todd!!....It's good to have you arround !!",1026172800,2,510,4.633333333333334
1711840,3,B000066743,"This DVD is decent...I saw this set list live and have to admit
that Todd's lead guitar skills are great. If you are a true Todd
fan from the 70's...you might be let down a bit when you look for
acoustic songs, ballads, etc...because they are not here.
Highlight: Bang the Drum on ukelele...its great. Todd is
a genius, no doubt.",1024876800,2,329,4.409836065573771
1711841,3,B000066743,"have been a huge tr fan for lots of years. loved the set list for the video, but the technical quality is way below average. had to turn the volume way up on my tv just to basically hear the toons. very disappointing. the visuals are ok, but streaky at times. saw the power trio 3 times while on tour,and this video barely does it justice. but i dig todd and what are you gonna do?",1024876800,,381,4.026315789473684
1711842,5,B000066743,"The Sacrificial Lamb of Rock returns to his rock and roll roots in this angst filled medley of musically mutated minimalist masterpieces! No Sales brothers here, but tunes from Nazz, Runt, Todd , Faithfull, Todd solo, Utopia, TR-i and some new ones to boot are performed by OH backed by maestro Kasim Sultan (of Utopia, Meatloaf, varying guest spots with Patty Smythe, Patti Smith and Joan Jett to name a few as well as a multi - instrumentalist solo artist and producer- sort of a chip off the old Todd!) on bass and superb background vocals and Trey Sabatelli (Tubes) on drums and background vocals. (Ok, there are some mp3 keys on a couple tunes, but other than that, it's a true triumvirate) Can our beloved Hero, known for his impeccable production skills, carry this off?  Read on and find out!
First the snafu's: a little too much glare from the overpowering lights and the stage crew fumbled their way around a bit, amps conking out, monitors dying and a couple of guitar switches flubbed - but hey no broken strings (a rarity for this tour!). The film crew leaves a lot to be desired as the picture can be hazy and the camera angles are odd at times. Packaging also COULD have been better, e.g., a group picture for the cover, Kaz and Trey could have been CREDITED on the cover or any other indication that it was a power TRiO!?

There must have been technical problems at the beginning of I Hate My Frickin' ISP, cuz OH chose to splice together some sound checks of varying quality to begin the song with. Yer Fast rocks pretty hard and Todd appears to be in top form. The guitar playing is so hot that you forget about the problems with ISP! Todd ""Faithfully"" pulls off a searing version of Black And White that prepares the way for No. 1 LCD, the song is slow and seductive Hendrix style ballad and culminates in a ""screaming"" guitar solo! Back to a TRiO of rockers, the NAZZ song Open My Eyes, has an almost grunge sound to it but sounds like it was made for a little garage band. Trapped is always a hits you like a mack truck doing 120mph! And segues into Trapped, a great Utopia tune. The opening of Love In Action quickly follow and Todd does a pretty good job of performing the keyboard solo on guitar. Kaz and Try get a break while Todd performs Bang The ""Ukulele"" Daily Hawaiian style with reference to ""Elvis in Hawaii"" and some entertaining whooping. Another song reinvented by Our Hero. One of Todd's later compositions, Temporary Sanity follows. It's another musical hybrid with funny lyrics and a great bass line laid down by Kaz. Todd, sensing the end of the show gives his vocal chords a work screaming, literally!  Todd does his SRV impersonation in the Mystified/Broke Down And Busted Medley. Despite technical glitches, it's a bluesy ballad that showcases the cohesiveness of the group and a side of Todd we rarely get to see anymore! Buffalo Grass is the only mellow-ish pop tune preserved from the show.  Mp3 keyboards are quickly drowned out by the band and the background vocals are superb. One World kicks off immediately and is carried off extremely well. The Ikon - TRi-O version, starts the encores. Great riff, truly awesome solos! This song alone is worth the price of the disc. Hammer In My Heart follows and truly rocks. This song sounds more like a ""hit"" now than ever! World Wide Epiphany, again Todd's musical mutational foray into new worlds shines brightly! Despite playing to an mp3, the song comes off as raucous, rowdy, funky and very, very much like a perfect ""Todd"" anthem to finish a show with! They really bring this song to life and much like Temporary Sanity, you'll be humming, singing, playing ""air"" bass and screaming this song for hours after you've heard it!
Usually, I dislike concerts being edited for release. In this case though less IS more! Most of the songs were NOT meant to be played by a three-piece band. But given their new life, and Todd's refusal to grow old gracefully, the Power TR-iO comes off sounding like Cream and the Jimi Hendrix Experience! Coming in at 81 minutes, it's just a little linger than a CD so it DEMANDS repeated play. In less than a week, I've watched it about 13 times. Record companies rarely put out decent product, especially ""live"" DVDs and they've bare boned this one as well. The less than stellar picture quality and flawed start of ISP should NOT keep you from buying this disc. Technical problems of the show aside, this is an absolute historical gem of a keeper. They do, after all, add a little flavor to the live act. Hell, if you want to hear the record, PLAY the record!",1024617600,4,4582,4.577344701583435
1711843,4,B000066743,"This concert DVD only runs about 81 minutes.  Better than zero minutes, of course.  The concert is Todd supported by his Utopia bandmate Kasim Sulton on bass and vocals and Trey Sabatelli on drums.  The lack of liner notes, insert card, or other materials clues us in that this DVD was assembled on the cheap.  The only insert in the DVD case is a catalog of titles available through Image Entertainment, the distributors of this DVD.  Perhaps that was the deal - Image would absorb much of the cost of producing and distributing this DVD in exchange for advertising space inside.  Since Todd usually records away from the major record labels, perhaps that is the best we can get.  Usually only the big corporate labels have the money for a fancy, features-packed DVD release.
But be happy, Todd fans!  Another Rundgren concert DVD looms on the horizon!  A rare 1990 Japan concert, once available on VHS and now only recently easier to find, is scheduled for DVD release in August 2002.  That one runs over 90 minutes and features a relatively large band of Todd regulars and semi-regulars backing him up.
But even with skimpy extras and a lack of insert packaging, there is no such thing as a bad Todd Rundgren release!",1024099200,4,1220,4.685446009389671
1711844,4,B000066743,"Something new for Todd fans.  First off, all Todd fans will thoroughly enjoy seeing the Power Trio in concert on DVD....with great songs like Open My Eyes, Number One Lowest Common Denominator and the Ikon....great to finally get these songs live!  Not that this title was a quicky (well maybe it was), but there are several things that bothered me about it, especially when comparing it to earlier releases.  There are no liner notes or anything like that. There is nothing that takes advantage of the DVD format (no special features short of an index and a way to adjust the sound)....this point is a little upsetting because of Todd's love for anything digital.  The camera angles are sometimes akward....can't explain it, but with 80% shot from a crane looking down at Todd, it just seems kind of wierd.  Shots of Kasim are often fuzzy.  As far as the music, sometimes its amazing, sometimes its tentative.  There's also no chit-chat from Todd and with a very sparse stage and Kasim often stepping back during Todd's solos, it seems empty.  Please understand that these are not complaints, just comments.  I love the DVD and am going to watchi it over and over and over.  Would I show it to my non-Todd friends (that's what us Todd fanatics do...try to convert people), I might lean towards some of the other titles.  OK, so where is the Ringo Tour and the Abbey Road tour...we're all waiting for those!",1023840000,24,1407,4.702040816326531
1711845,5,B000066743,"The key question for any Todd Rundgren concert or disc/DVD is, Which Todd will show up?  In this case it's power-trio Todd, accompanied only by Kasim Sulton on bass and Trey Sabatelli on drums (both of them provide background vocals).  It is a no-frills recording of a live concert in front of a small but enthusiastic crowd.  And the three of them proceed to tear the hell out of some golden oldies and what in the year 2000 were newish songs.

This is a solid five-star DVD for anyone remotely interested in Rundgren's work or rock guitar artistry in general.  Not only does Todd infuse new life into songs that seem not to lend themselves to power-pop, but the camera focuses generously on Todd's technique on Foamy, the light-green guitar that he's been playing for years.  And folks, let me tell you, Todd Rundgren has been ridiculously underrated in the Flash department; this guy can really play.  Aspiring and practicing rock guitarists will learn a lot from this DVD.  The then-52-year-old Todd is in very good voice and possessed of tremendous energy.  I'm not going to mention the play list; suffice to say I was thrilled to hear a song from Todd's very first album, Runt.  And OBTW:  Think a garage band can't play Utopia prog-rock songs?  Think again.

This garage band on steroids proves emphatically that Todd's true milieu is not the studio but in front of a crowd with just two other like-minded guys.  The performances and energy are outstanding.  Mental deduction of a half-star for lack of any extras and for the spartan production values.  The deduction is more than made up for by the performances of all three of them.",1319328000,,1641,4.725352112676056
1711846,5,B000066743,"I only know of Todd Rundgren through his work on Bat Out of Hell. Since that is one of the great rock albums, and his work on it was masterful, I decided that I needed to expose myself to more of Rundgren. I'm really glad I did. This concert showcases his virtuoso guitar playing talent, which is great. I also enjoyed his raw singing, the immense range of styles between the songs, and, on at least a couple of the songs, the ridiculous and funny Meat Loaf-style lyrics which would have made Jim Steinman chuckle. If you want to see a great musician rock out, I highly recommend this concert.",1312243200,,593,4.4
1711847,4,B000066743,"Almost passed on this one due to some of the reviews posted here, but found it cheap and took the chance. Glad I did. Good performances of a nice selection of songs. We even have a Nazz song, not to mention, ""The Ikon"", one of the last songs I'd ever expect him to perform with a three-piece. It's a truncated instrumental version, but really gives Todd a chance to show off his guitar prowess. Completely different guitar solos from the recorded versions on some cuts make for an interesting change of pace. Was very happy to see Kasim Sulton from the Utopia days handling bass and vocal duties with his usual top-notch skills on display. First time I've seen this particular drummer, but he also did a fine job. 81 minutes-no extras. I'll be keeping this one.",1309996800,,761,4.562043795620438
1711848,3,B000066743,"I spent a good portion of my adolescence watching and listening to Todd Rundgren. From my mid-teens to mid-twenties, I never missed a show when he played in my hometown. Twenty-five years later, I was  a little skeptical that he still had it. Still, I liked the song selection on the DVD so I thought I'd take a chance. I wasn't disapointed. Even with a smaller band, he was still excellent. What a guitar player!! Although wasn't in the best voice, the show still delivered. Made me wish I hadn't missed his last vist here, when he played all of A Wizard, A True Star. Definely will go see him next time he's in town. Yea Todd!! Good video and sound quality too.",1271376000,,663,4.390243902439025

1711850,3,B000066743,"I saw several of these shows and this video doesn't do them justice.  While it's musically sound, it doesn't capture any of the energy from the crowd.  It's kind of sterile in it's presentation but the trio rocks.  Lot's of Todd guitar which is why it's worth buying.  The theater shows on this tour just didn't have the crackling vibe that the bar shows did and this comes across as a theater show.  If they had recorded the added, spur of the moment show from the Chameleon Club in Lancaster, PA, you could crank that up, rattle your walls and your brain, and really get a feel for what this tour was all about.  That said, it's still a nice musical momento.",1128038400,2,660,4.368852459016393
1711851,5,B000066743,"This video arrived in the mail from Amazon.com 30 years after I first saw Todd on tour (Wizard/original Utopia). Granted, nothing will ever top that event, but thinking back on all of the other times that I have seen Todd through the years, I am really glad that this tour has been preserved on video for posterity. I cannot ever recall seeing him rock this hard as what is presented here!  No keyboards, just guitar, bass, and drums. Tood's guitar fans will absolutely love this video! The set list is predominantly the boogie and blues influenced numbers. Songs like Public Servant from Second Wind and Determination from Hermit would also have fit very well into this long set list, to give you an idea. The only slow parts are the ukelele version of Bang The Drum, and the experimental Number One Lowest Common Denominator. As for the quality of the video, I initially did not like the very amateur feel to it, especially since it opens up with some bad sound checks from various cities. Then I realized as usual, Todd is a genius, and this video makes the viewer feel like he/she is actually in that small concert hall. This video will also serve the purpose in helping the Todd fan to decide if it is worth driving 8-12 hours to see him on his next tour (Jan. 2003). Give me the car keys!",1038960000,9,1294,4.506382978723404
1711852,5,B000066743,"Excellent show with the trio. I enjoyed this DVD alot. I really like the song selection and the playing is hot! I hardly ever miss a Todd Rundgren show. I have seen nearly every tour he has done since 1973, but I missed this one because he didn't make it this far south. So I was happy to see it appear on DVD. Always different, always interesting, always exciting and creative!!!! I rarely ever find anything worth critisizing about his work and this is no exception. Todd gives us another meaty chunk!!",1027036800,12,504,4.489130434782608
1711853,4,B000066743,"I originally bought this out of loyalty and few expectations since it ties in with the very poor One Long Year release. My original feelings were confirmed with the first 2 tracks. However, once Todd gets started on his old classics, the concert and the audience warm up considerably. This has an unusual and inspired mix of tracks. The best aspect is hearing Todd performing so much guitar.
Visually, the dvd does not exploit the dvd medium. As other reviewers have commented, the camera work is not very good, especially when compared with the excellent work on the Utopia Redux video. Howeve, the dolby digital sound mix is superb and you really feel you are right there in the concert. To hs credit, Toddd also includes a 2.0 mix for people who don't have 5.1 sound and a dts mix which I can't comment on. As an extra it would have been nice to see some interviews with some of the audence after the show. When are we going to see Live in London released with a  multi-angle feature? That concert was shot on digital synchronsed cameras and was made for puting on dvd",1026345600,7,1071,4.520618556701031

I like all the songs included on this set, and though this isn't like going to one of his live shows which are full of electricity, it is a decent alternative. He does a lot of guitar work on this one and he is in top form on this one.

7961945,4,B000066743,"Todd Rundgren is an extremely talented musician, who's musical output has been pretty diverse.  Being more of a hard rock and metal fan, I never really got too much into Todd, regarding him as more of a pop music guy.  My favorite work of his was Utopia's album, Oops! Wrong Planet.  Finding that Live In San Francisco was available to Amazon Prime members, I decided to check it out, and am really glad I did, because I discovered that Todd Rundgren is a more talented, and much heavier guitar player than I had thought.

The band is a trio that includes long time Utopia bass player Kasim Sultan, and drummer Trey Sabatelli joining Todd on stage at the Maritime Hall in 2000, where the audience is just a few feet away.  Rundgren wears the sunglasses seen on the DVD cover throughout, and uses his blue P-Project guitar most of the time.  His processed sound is a little raw and spacey, as his playing style incorporates elements of rock, blues, fusion, and jazz.  The sound is pretty raw and at times uneven, with perhaps not the greatest job of mixing.  Todd's vocals sometimes get buried, but you never have a problem hearing his guitar.  Image quality is decent, but not great.  There are movable suspended cameras in the venue that provide some interesting and unusual views of the band.  Often you get a wide angle view, but shot from right of the center.  There are no camera operators visible, and the whole show looks to have been shot with perhaps four or five cameras.

Not being that familiar with Rundgren's material, I didn't recognize most of the songs, but as they were mostly rock numbers, I pretty much enjoyed the entire performance.  One World, and Buffalo Grass, are a couple of the more catchy tunes.  Todd, who has lived in Hawaii, performs Bang The Drum All Day using a ukulele, which is the most mellow moment in the show.  The band plays Trapped, and Love In Action, both from Oops! Wrong Planet, with Kasim handling the vocals on Trapped.  On Mystified/Broke Down And Busted, Todd plays some pretty mean and nasty blues guitar.  The Ikon is an instrumental fusing rock and jazz where all the players get a chance to improvise.

The setlist is as follows:

1. I Hate My Frickin' ISP/ 2. Yer Fast (And I Like It)/ 3. Black And White/ 4. Number One Lowest Common Denominator/ 5. Open My Eyes/ 6. Trapped/ 7. Love In Action/ 8. Bang The Drum All Day/ 9. Temporary Sanity/ 10. Mystified/Broke Down And Busted/ 11. Buffalo Grass/ 12. One World/ 13. The Ikon/ 14. Hammer In My Heart/ 15 World Wide Epiphany.

There aren't that many concerts featuring rock artists available on Amazon Prime, so I really appreciated this show, and also&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Todd-Rundgren-Live-in-Japan/dp/B000069HZ5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Todd Rundgren - Live in Japan</a>, which is also currently on Prime.  These are two vastly different types of performances, and illustrate the range of Rundgren's creativity and talent.  Watching them, I gained a whole new appreciation of Todd's music.  Rock fans might like the San Francisco show better, while pop music fans might prefer the show in Japan.",1327881600,,3159,4.905838041431262
