3737087,3,B001P1WM18,"This seems to be a fairly accurate account of the Passover Seder as practiced by a family in their home, but the end of the movie consists of the main figure, the grandfather, expounding Jesus as the Savior.  Since I'm not a Jew, I don't know what is going on here.  Are they Messianic Jews?  Why doesn't the movie description state that?",1388880000,3,338,4.419354838709677
3737088,3,B001P1WM18,"I purchased this video on the Passover to get information on how each element of the Passover Seder relates to Christ as I would like to have a Passover Seder for my Sunday School Class next year.  The video starts slow with a reenactment of the Jewish Passover Seder.  It is not very well done and seems outdated and at times comical.  However, the video has a second half that provided the information I was looking for on how the elements of the Passover Seder relate to Christ.  I will use the information as one of the sources for my Seder next year.",1365465600,2,555,4.359223300970874
3737089,3,B001P1WM18,"Was hoping to learn something new and it just didn't happen. However for someone just beginningn to study Passover, it was excellent but the quality of the performance was very dated. (I knew it probably would be.)",1358640000,,214,4.8108108108108105
3737090,5,B001P1WM18,"the presentation is by one of the ""completed Jew"" pioneers; Zola was a wonderful man with a powerful message; this DVD is quite old - I would guess it was made 10 -15 years ago, well before he became ill.  A great message of the importance of Passover to Christian believers",1358467200,2,274,4.372549019607843

3737092,3,B001P1WM18,I thought I was ordering Zola's teaching about the Passover.  Although this was not the DVD I thought I was ordering it was o.k.,1288137600,,128,4.333333333333333
3737093,5,B001P1WM18,"This movie was wonderful. The only down side was that the dvd did not have chapters or fast-forwarding so to start it where I needed to for a presentation I had to already have let it play to that spot and pause it before the program I was giving. Other than that it was great. Zola Levitt is wonderful as 'Grandpa' and he even made non-excitable highschoolers laugh twice! The perfect length for a presentation.
Great!",1241481600,5,419,4.526315789473684

8331845,4,B001P1WM18,"This is a very good Passover for Gentiles DVD. It, however is a little dated in the video quality. Appears to have been converted from a VHS tape. We liked it, but preferred the DVD offered by JewsforJesus.org",1397952000,,209,4.526315789473684
