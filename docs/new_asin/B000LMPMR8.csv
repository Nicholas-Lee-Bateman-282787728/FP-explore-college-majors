2818511,4,B000LMPMR8,When you watch this movie you think you know what is going on?  A woman having an affair?  Then she gets her lover to kill her husband and you think that is that.  Not.  Then it gets to the end and the woman is having a relationship with another woman.  Yuk.  I was disappointed that Michael Dudikoff would engage in this kind of movie. So I watch another one that is good that he did.,1186790400,,385,4.066666666666666

8191194,3,B000LMPMR8,"A great idea for a movie that was spoiled with idiotic sexual scenes between two people with zero chemistry. Not only that, there was no romance at all between the two love-birds, it was wham bam, etc. One particularly disappointing moment was when these two were alone in the rain  and a car Marlee just suddenly goes down on the guy. I almost upchucked it was so sickening. This is the way prostitutes conduct their street business, I hear. The rain, the car, being together after being apart..it could have been a passionate and loving moment, but no they go for the raw deed. Gross. The other bed scenes didn't make sense either. No real attraction ever came through but all of a sudden they're stripped and going at it. Stupid, but the plot and the ending of the story were good.",1517529600,,784,4.52112676056338
