8325688,2,B000S0GYNY,"Unfortunately this DVD have not subtitles ( nor in English even less in spanish!!!)..therefore for somebody like me, whose language is not english , it is hard to understand what the people are saying and then the video became boring. Although it is good to watch many differents species of turtles and tortoises and  knowing (according the information of DVD box) that somebody does something for chelonia.",1506816000,,407,5.074626865671642
8325689,4,B000S0GYNY,"While there are a lot of documentaries on wildlife and conservation, ""Chances of the World Changing"" is unique because it focuses on one brave man's attempt and ultimate failure to create a turtle institute. The protagonist, Richard Ogust, is truly an unsung conservation hero. He gave up his writing career in order to save turtles from Asian markets and keep them in his apartment. Unfortunately, he encounters problems in his quest to establish an institute for the turtles, from the New Jersey Department of Environment to fundraising. I won't spoil the end, but it is amazing to see his journey. I only wish the film had spent a bit more time on the turtles themselves or discussing the Asian turtle market, perhaps profiling a few species, as a way to get the viewer to understand what is really at stake. But nonetheless, this film is inspirational and has inspired me to think about how I as an individual could take a chance on the world changing.",1249257600,2,956,4.765060240963855
8325690,5,B000S0GYNY,"It was sad to learn about how turtle populations are being decimated around the world.  Although, there are things we can do with our grief.  Depressed moods can be used as fuel for progressive action.  The film itself offered a list of organizations that are doing important work on the issue.  There is an infinite variety of things we can choose to do for this or any other cause.  Simply sharing this film with others, or  writing letters to editors raises awareness.  Progressive talk shows enable us to reach many where a lot of people, like that of author and activist Thom Hartmann&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Last-Hours-of-Ancient-Sunlight-Revised-and-Updated-The-Fate-of-the-World-and-What-We-Can-Do-Before-It-s-Too-Late/dp/1400051576/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Last Hours of Ancient Sunlight: Revised and Updated: The Fate of the World and What We Can Do Before It's Too Late</a>.

Yes, there are a lot of people on the planet, some who want turtle soup.

Another issue is that of turtles being swept up by giant factory trawlers.  That is an industry that needs to be pressured and shamed.  Groups like the Sea Shepard are doing a lot to accomplish that.

There are many examples of people successfully defending species and ecosystems&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Heal-the-Ocean-Solutions-for-Saving-Our-Seas/dp/0865715009/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Heal the Ocean: Solutions for Saving Our Seas</a>.  I think one of the major problems halting more progressive change is the hopeless attitudes that neutralize people.

I don't know if we can change the whole world, but we can change the parts of the world we reside in.  We can also change where we put our time, attention and resources.  That itself would be a helpful revolution.

8325691,5,B000S0GYNY,"I don't know any other film that's made me feel more in the gut how life on earth is an ultimately passing state of being that we as humans happen to share with millions of other forms of earthly life, and a much much smaller number that actually are pretty much like we are only silent about it.  So the film is about one man and his turtles--or some 1500 or so turtles and their one man, and how no one alone has much effect on anything unless he or she thinks it through and does what's feasible for now, even if he/she does start out with a pile of cash and great intentions. I think this moving film can't be so much about the chances that our biosystem will survive and keep the humans as happy as they've ever been (which is?), but about how much control we collectively have over that change and how one driven individual does end up being a small but actual part of that stumbling collective impulse to sustain and cherish life.

I love what the film ultimately shows about ark colonies and the folks among us who are sailing them.  I won't say more and give the last part of the film away. But I found it ultimately more sobering than depressing.  There are some heavy realities of population, scarcity, greed, stupidity, and extinction that are beyond what our collective selves can much lighten (and not at all by ""electing"" dimwit presidents, etc.); but we can do better for life as a whole, and we can exercise whatever power and intelligence we can muster ourselves and our groups and lean them toward what looks like light.

Or do we all just stay busy with whatever we were doing?",1216252800,4,1597,4.4
8325692,4,B000S0GYNY,"I found this movie profoundly depressing, but expected to do so since the topic is so difficult to resolve.  I thought it did a great job calling attention to the plight of turtles and the difficulties involved in their conservation.  I guess I wondered, though, if the perspective was a little too narrow and whether the isolation in which these turtle breeders appear to operate is as real as it appears in the film.  With many zoos focusing on breeding endangered species in captivity and many international organizations concerned about wildlife I just have to wonder if there is no support out there and if so how best to connect with these groups in order to help people interested in conservation find ways of focusing their energies most effectively.  I read reviews of the movie on line and found myself annoyed with some conservation officers who were quoted therein- the response being that you don't have to be involved internationally to protect turtles- you can start in your own backyard.  While I agree with that summary to a certain extent I believe it misses the point- which is or should be, how can we develop organizations that can help us understand the most effective way to focus our efforts- if Vietnamese turtles are more in crisis from the turtle trade, then we do have to focus on them.  But with a better organized group keeping track of their status, we would know of the needs of turtles nationally and locally as well.  And know when to take action at whichever level.",1193875200,7,1500,4.724137931034483
8325693,5,B000S0GYNY,"Saw it tonight on the Hist channel. Super absorbing study of a guy who gives up his life to save turtles. Sounds crazy but the guy either has a passion for saving turtles from extinction, or he's just another nut using it as an excuse to escape this world. Either way you respect him for the good he is attempting to do no matter what his motivation. But because he's such a nice guy his tragic story sucks you in and totally captivates you. But in the end he fails in his quest and he seems to end up directionless, broken and with quite a bit of repressed pain. This is a real person with real tragic pain through no fault of his own as he gives it everything he's got in him and you kind of want to hug the poor guy and tell him to forget turtles because all the love and energy he gave them could have and still can be used to raise some wonderful human kids. Hands down a human being child would cure him and he would be the best dad ever. Buy the video because it's great and you learn life lessons from watching this poor guy who is as nice a person as there is.
