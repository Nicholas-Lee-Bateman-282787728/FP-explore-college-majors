8402676,5,1501845861,"Tiffany covers a wide range of personal examples of emotions and challenges that we as women may encounter as we navigate life. She uses 6 women in the bible who experienced feelings of shame, abandonment, rejection, and fear but also triumph and deliverance through encountering Jesus Christ.  I liked how Tiffany concluded that Jesus is our deliverer, comforter, companion, Father, friend, true lover, and most of all sustainer and strong tower in any situation.

If you need encouragement as you journey through these inevitable experiences of life regardless of your age and status (married, single, going through now or later), I recommend picking up a copy of a Tiffanys book, Neve Alone it will help assure you that Jesus longs to be your true companion to guide you and give you victory at all times.",1517875200,2,808,4.977777777777778
