8109238,5,B000EGDAU2,"After seeing ""Playing for Change"" on the Sundance Channel I emailed the producer to find out when the DVD would be available...He took the time to reply and told me that it would be available soon and that if I could not find it, he would send me a copy....Well, I bought the audio CD first, enjoyed it thoroughly and purchased the DVD as soon as I found it was available on Amazon...Being a music and blues lover, and as someone who enjoys and values the talents of street musicians and their sheer love of their music, I found the various artists and their stories facinating...To see the sacrifices they make just so that they can continue their passion is inspiring...I particularly enjoyed the New Orleans segment as I have been to the Quarter several times and watched and listened to the artists portrayed in the film...I would recommend this DVD and the audio CD too to anyone who feels that the current trend in popular music is too manufactured, corporate, bland and uninspired...",1162684800,24,990,4.695402298850575
8109239,4,B000EGDAU2,I enjoyed this documentary a lot and it taught me a lesson about the human spirit and how resilent people are.  Street musicians deserve respect for they are keeping alive a centuries' old tradition in the face of the modern world. I loved it and highly recommend!,1151452800,4,264,4.617021276595745
8109240,5,B000EGDAU2,"PLAYING FOR CHANGE!! Musically enchanting, brilliantly directed, superbly edited! Truly a trip through a musical subculture that only those who live in certain cities are priveleged to enjoy! Playing For Change captures the souls of these dedicated American artists who seemingly live for their artistry and not just for economic gain-a refreshing change from the current norm.

 To the directors- How about an international edition?",1147824000,9,433,5.6461538461538465
8109241,5,B000EGDAU2,"Playing for Change showcases street musicians in New Orleans, California, and New York. These are people who literally pick up  an  instrument walk out into the street and start playing-sometimes alone , sometimes with a few friends. There is something really refreshing about that simplicity and I suppose that is the theme of the film.  Every type of music is here - rock, jazz, blues, and folk,  so this is a DVD for everybody.  What makes the movie work is that it is wonderfully edited, allowing you to effortlessly move from muscician to musician, and from city to city.

In the end Playing For Change reminds us that these musicians are people, ordinary people,sharing their gift of music.  It's a beautiful song coming up from the street, it's got a beautiful sound and a beautiful beat.",1147651200,14,795,4.801470588235294
