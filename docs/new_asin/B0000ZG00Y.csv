Watching this video brings back the joys of studying Johnny Sheffield, who was so captivating as Boy, in the Tarzan movies. Here you see Boy all grown up--and wooo, is he one sexy young hunk! He was the Brad Pitt pin-up of the late 40s and 50s. Although the Bomba movies were made on a modest scale, they're still charming, harmless entertainments for the whole families. Bomba never gave his female co-stars even a peck on the cheek. His sole goal was to escort the femme star to safety and of couse the heroines were forever wandering off alone into the jungle or diving into alligator-infested water. At the center of them all is the beautiful, talented, charismatic Johnny Sheffield who retired back in the mid-fifties to marry and raise children.",1082937600,3,877,4.701298701298701
