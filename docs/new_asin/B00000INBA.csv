8188751,5,B00000INBA,"This is a must have in the Dragon Ball Z DVD set.  Goku finally reaches his destination and starts his training.  The Z fighters on earth train at Kame's palace in the pendulum room, where they fight Saiyans from the past.  Meanwhile Gohan gets entranced by a Saiyan spacepod and he and Piccolo go on an all out fight.  This gets to the Dragon Ball Z bascis, which is fighting, lots of fighting.  The Z fighters against the old Saiyans is great, but the best is the Piccolo and Gohan fight.  Goku's training is quite humorous and one laughs at King Kai's methods.  Definetly a must buy, you'll thank me after watching it.",970617600,6,621,4.442477876106195
