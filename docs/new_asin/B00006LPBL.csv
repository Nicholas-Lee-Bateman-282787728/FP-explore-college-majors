1785667,1,B00006LPBL,"(...) TCheesy and very low budget are the best words to describe these DVDs. The instructors are a big joke, especially the guy on the ""Fat Burning"" portion who is wearing neon orange tights that leave absolutely nothing to the imagination (and he is scrawny and hairy, also)...not a pretty sight. Then you've got Traci Lords doing aerobics in a teeny tiny bikini, which may appeal to some but that's not something I want to watch! I think the director forgot to tell her that this isn't a porno (she closes her eyes and breathes heavily quite a bit).
I basically put each DVD in and watched the first few minutes of each one and that will be the last time they are ever near my DVD player.",1046822400,5,690,4.3984375
1785668,1,B00006LPBL,"I wish I could have the option of 0 stars for this DVD set.
For 1 thing, its innate with these DVD's that there are tracking problems with them. Thank goodness I was able to return it, since it was a defect.
Secondly, these videos are old 80's and early 90's stuff, but mostly 80's. They are TERRIBLE. I can't believe they had the nerve to put this on DVD. They should be ashamed of themselves.
2 of the workouts are Traci Lords Jazzthetics (yes, THAT Traci Lords) She actually has a rhyme for every single move you make. A few examples :

""Keep your tummy firm and tight/if it hurts you've done it right""
""Roll your hips round and round/a perfect circle should be found""
""Move your hips left to right/keep it firm, keep it tight""
""bend your waist, turn round and round/burning off another pound""
 and another one, I can't remember what it says, but it ends in ""Come on baby, please don't poop""
And many many more. The workout itself is ridiculous. I must admit, though, you'll pee your pants you'll be laughing that hard.
Another thing you need to be aware of, they have changed the title of this DVD set, and changed the cover. It now has a purple cover with a woman with blonde curly hair, and its titled Fitnessheaven.com's 10 Best Workouts.
This is the absolute worst fitness video set I have ever, ever seen.
Keep your money, avoid this set like the plague.",1046390400,3,1363,4.426294820717131
1785669,1,B00006LPBL,This is a sad set of fitness videos.  They are full of late 80's to 90's videos (that probably were not even popular in their day.) and are packaged as if they are the best new set of videos out there.  The picture quality is very poor and the content quality is even worse.  The only thing this set has going for it is the number of different workouts it has.,1044403200,5,360,4.042253521126761
1785670,4,B00006LPBL,"I was looking for a video program that would give me a variety of exercises. This DVD set is exactly what I have been looking for. It has kickboxing, yoga, aerobics, tae fit, weightlifting (arms and shoulders strengthening) .The workout range from easy (where you don't feel any sweat) to hard where you are just wiped-out after performing the video.
There are ten program series on this five DVD pack (there are two series on each DVD, on each side of the DVD). Some of these series are pretty old (some going back to the late 80's) but they are still quite stimulating. Also, some of the DVD's (on my copies) have some video glitches (but do not interfere that much with the workouts). Some of the instructors are kind of nerdy but it is the exercises that you want to perform not how beautiful the video looks or sounds.
This is the lineup of the DVD fitness series that come in the pack:
Kick Butt Kombo: A series of two programs featuring kickboxing as an exercise. The second program is real intense.
Yogacise: Featuring Yoga. I found it ho-hum but I am not into Yoga.
Fat Burners: Three programs. Not to bad on the intense part. Involves aerobics.
Body Focus: Very light exercise. More like stretches.
Jazzthetics: Tracy Lords (sp?) (yes, that Tracy Lords) is your instructor. This video involves a lot of lower back exercises which I could not do so I have to be neutral about this video.
Tai Fit (not Tai Chi; not sure of the difference): Shows you the movements in one video and the applies them to the workout in another.
Rotation and Motivation series:
Back in Action:",1043366400,5,1580,4.566901408450704
1785693,4,B00006LPBL,"This box set, if you can see beyond some of the eighties clothing, the senior stretches, and the erotic yoga, is actually pretty good.

GOOD -- It has aerobics. Yes, aerobics, and a few hours of them. Not tae-bo, pilates, power-yoga, but hard core, totally late-eighties, aerobics. I can't find them anywhere on the market, except here. Aerobics were my initiation into the world of fitness, so for me those programs bring back memories. They have been (rightfully) replaced with safer methods, but why take everything so seriously?

GOOD -- It has something like tae bo, which is good too, and that is far less dated than the super '80s aerobics sequences. The kickboxing segments are called ''kick butt'' and ''tai fit.'' Both of them have outstanding instruction.

BAD -- It has stretching for the elderly -- really, it is called more alive -- I guess if you follow the exercise routine, you will be 'less dead'. Yes, that is kind of disturbing, if you are awake and alive enough to see why.

BAD -- There is a yoga sequence, which is a total perversion of everything yoga. It is an erotic portrayal of the blond yoga student (Jerry Hall) theoretically working under a more experienced Indian lady who knows yoga. The student has blue eyes, and bright lipstick.

BAD -- The introduction totally paints her whole body with henna, which turns into a pattern on her eighties sweat pants. She sits in a lotus position, and she morphs into 'some-sort-of-oriental-symbol.'

I was horrified at this approach to teaching Yoga.

I don't see any compensation postures, reps, or flow in the sequence. But I guess that really wasn't the point of the video, so why bother with the yoga part anyway?

It attempts to teach yogic breathing; Jerry Hall inhales, and her eyes sink back in ecstasy. The camera zones in on her eye-lashes here, and stays there. I really wonder if the camera man and the director weren't freelance guys that had been in the pornography industry too long.

EXCUSE -- as I see it, the programs aren't as awful as people are claiming. The mixture is as terrible as the presentation. ''yogacize'' and ''kick butt'' are on the same DVD. Totally inappropriate. Imagine confusing the steak sauce with the hot fudge, or eating cole-slaw with sushi. bla!!!

GOOD -- I say that the tai-kick, and the awkward aerobics are the strengths of this totally random series. Really, this is the rocky horror picture show of the fitness industry.",1122163200,17,2441,4.79047619047619
1785694,1,B00006LPBL,"I was very excited when I first saw this set.  So I bought it not thinking that these were programs so outdated, if I did I never would have bought it. The cover information is very misleading. It gives all these great programs that you can workout with but nowhere on the cover or back does it say that these are all programs 15 years old or more.",1120867200,6,348,4.117647058823529
1785695,1,B00006LPBL,"I was so excited when I bought this DVD because I thought that I was getting a good value.  Boy was I in for a shock!  I like to sit down and watch the workout tape before I actually do it and to my shock and horror, this was not a new workout series, not even within the last 10 years.  Boring, yawn!",1114387200,8,301,3.746031746031746
1785696,4,B00006LPBL,"I think that for the price this is a good deal. The Kick Butt and Tai Fit are good kickboxing workouts. The first Kick Butt is milder, the second and Tai Fit are higher level. Tracy Lords' workout might be somewhat disturbing for some people but the second version is without words except 'transition' to indicate each new exercise so once you learn the moves you don't need to look at her much. It is low impact but great for weight loss. It includes stretchning and all body parts. The step workout is good as well. It definitely helps with weight loss. It is relatively low impact. Yogacise is OK if you just want to stretch and you can do all of the segments for a fuller workout.",1111363200,5,684,4.3515625
1785697,3,B00006LPBL,"I agree with everyone else.  This is very dated and cheesy.  I was so excited when I bought this - thought the concept was good.  I bought this at a Name Store, and it was one of the few workout videos they had on the  shelf that wasn't yoga.  So I am very disappointed that this is all you can get out there.  But on the fat burners dvd - there is one workout that has funky aerobics, hot bods and baby boomers aerobics.  The Hot Bods and baby boomers are 30 minutes each and they are pretty good.  You have to ignore the outfits, though.  I laughed my behind off, I did one of the other aerobics programs and I had to stop after 5 minutes and just sat there and laughed.  My 3 year old came into the room and asked what the weird girl was doing on the tv.  It was actually a man in a one piece black leotard with a white belt!!",1099612800,11,829,3.904191616766467
1785698,1,B00006LPBL,"I've never left a review before - but this one is so bad I just had to keep others from wasting their money. My 10 year old decided to start some daily exercise.  When looking at DVD's she decided that this would be a good starting point so she could get a variety of different options and then decide what she liked the best.  She was most interested in the ""More Alive"" and ""Fat Burners"" programs.  Not only are ALL of the programs EXTREMELY dated, but the ""Fat Burners"" looks like it's the 50th copy made of the same video tape - not even watchable (due to the static) in some areas - and on my copy the ""More Alive"" program has been replaced by the ""Tracy Lords program"" - which can only be described as disturbing. This program was NOT listed on the cover.  My $20 would have been much better spent on one QUALITY (this century)fitness DVD.",1097625600,10,845,4.29559748427673
1785699,1,B00006LPBL,"This was a good idea, put 10 different types of workouts on one dvd set. Nice concept, right?? Well they ruined it by using the oldest most generic videos, that probably didn't sell back in 1988. I only watched the beginning of most of them. There were some Funky Aerobics on one of them and they had some funky outfits to go with them. The TaiFit is not nearly as good as Billy Blanks TaeBo. I watched more of the Jazzthetics than anything, because it was so funny. Obvious Traci Lords thought so too, because I noticed her laughing in some spots. And I wouldn't recommend doing sit-ups like she did, I think she was trying her best to make her chin touch her chest.

I recommend not wasting your money on this dvd set and instead build you a 10 best workouts slowly. Maybe buy Kathy Smith Kickboxing now and a Taebo later, etc.",1090454400,7,829,4.348387096774194
1785700,5,B00006LPBL,I found if i feel i cannot be bothered to exercise this is a great set of workouts -- because I work my abs so much from laughing -- especially the Traci Lord's workout -- give it a go if you want a tongue in cheek workout!!!,1090022400,,225,3.8085106382978724
1785701,1,B00006LPBL,This is the worst workout program that I have ever seen in my life.  I am sorry that I wasted my time and money on it.  I definately do not recommend this set to anyone.,1071619200,2,169,3.8
1785702,1,B00006LPBL,"I bought this dvd because I found it for $9.99 and thought for over 12 hours of workouts that was a great deal - I checked the release date and it was 2002 - so I wasn't worried.  I put in the first tape, though, and wow!! Talk about outdated!  I had a really hard time getting past the little things (like hot pink shiny workout outfits and girls with short bangs curled and hairsprayed) - still - I figured I'd give another workout a try and I couldn't even get through the intro. - it was a segment talking about backcare that was simply outdated and too much to take...waste of money.",1065571200,9,588,4.1946902654867255
7971877,5,B00006LPBL,"Some of these workouts are horrible, some are mediocre at best.  I give this 5 star rating for ""Back in Action""...it is the best workout all around for back pain!  I have tried somewhere around a dozen others and nothing else compares.",1435536000,,235,4.571428571428571
7971878,4,B00006LPBL,I love having different workouts to choose from when I work out.  I can do a hard super intense workout or a more moderate workout it all depends on my mood and the way my body feels.,1366588800,,183,3.945945945945946
7971879,5,B00006LPBL,"Like many of you have written, I myself find the the videos are dated, but I have to say the ""Fat Burners"" (high intensity) workout is the best! I have been so toned and lost weight with this video. When visiting my family after I have done this workout, they all have great things to say about how I look. I tweaked it a bit though. I used 3lb weights for the workouts :-) and that helped. My CD just cracked, so I'm going to order another set so that I can get that one CD. Hope this helps.",1276732800,,492,3.9797979797979797
7971880,1,B00006LPBL,"I was also excited when I ordered this but it was terrible.  Very outdated and a complete waste of money.  Yes, it is cheap, but I wouldn't take it if it was given to me.  Its just taking up a spot on my dvd shelf, reminding me that I was dumb to order it without looking at reviews first.",1201564800,2,289,3.864406779661017
7971881,4,B00006LPBL,The Kick Butt program is the redeeming factor in this set. This program was worth the waste of all the other dvds. I watch it over and over and it never gets old.,1184371200,2,162,3.9393939393939394

7971883,1,B00006LPBL,"I was excited to buy the box set because I thought since it had different types of workouts that meant I would never get bored.  When I played one of the DVD's it was so outdated and the DVD began pausing on it's own and pixelating.  Most of the DVD's were poor copies.  Not worth the money.  It's not even good if it was free.

  DON'T SPEND ANY MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT!!!!",1143331200,4,372,4.083333333333333
7971884,1,B00006LPBL,I'm the type of person who can normally over look cheesey exercise program.  I take it as a point of humor but I COULD NOT tolerate these workouts.  This copywrite might say 2002 but these workouts are from the early 80's.  It was like fingernails on a chalk board.  I'd highly recommend keeping your money.,1140652800,3,307,4.527272727272727
7971885,5,B00006LPBL,"I am like the other two consumers.  I loved the variety of excercises.  I am not very active, so when I went to the store I did not know what to get.  Some of the other DVD's seemed to be so much alike.  I only wanted to spend a certain amount to start off.  I have videos at home, but I needed something new to give me that extra boost.  I then stumbled on this video.  For the price I decided to give it a try.

I was amazed of the 12 hours of fitness.  If you compare it to the others this one hand 11 more hours and more exercises.  I previewed the first 2 dvd's.  I was amazed.  Like the other people stated, it may be a little cheesy with the outfits, but it kept my heart pumping and I also was sweating.  I like how they have everything broken done from the introduction to beginning/advanced from the techniques to cool down.  If you are a person that is not used to excercising like me, it was the perfect thing for me.  I learned alot.  The bottom line is getting your heart to pump and being able to relax your body to the fullest.

You can spend the same amount for 1 type of workout on another up-to-date workout dvd that also gets your heart pumping or decide to choose from 9 different styles of workouts from the 10 Best Fitness DVD to having more of a variety.  This is also a good buy because if you are like me, I get tired of seeing the same moves from one dvd.

Just get over the 80's style and focus more on the outcome.  It's all Exercise!!!",1137801600,3,1465,4.020833333333333
7971886,1,B00006LPBL,"Looks tempting, doesn't it? TEN big fitness DVDs in one box. And for the same price as any other one DVD. Boy--that's got to be a winner, right? Even if there's just two winners in there, it's like getting two DVDs for the price of one.

Here's my verdict: Don't do it. Don't even bother being tempted.

Here's what you're getting: 10 videos from the 1980s.

First off, by videos, I do mean videos. While this is a DVD, it's a DVD of transfers from videos. Videos from the 1980s. With all the subsequent loss of quality, picture problems, and even tape hiss that accompanies an old VHS tape. This is sort of the fitness DVD equivalent of those dollar movies and cartoons you can buy of old movies that have entered the public domain.

As for the content--if the idea of a guy with a perm in neon spandex and a smoky room going, ""Let's blast this workout to a whole new dimension--with weights"" sounds like your idea of a serious fitness video, and if Shirley Jones and Jerry Hall are people you want to take fitness advice from, then you're in luck! This is your series!

Otherwise, just look for deals on newer stuff. Because the other problem you've got is that many of the videos on here are designed for different audiences. For instance, ""Back in Action,"" is designed for people who are having back problems but trying to work on building back strength. But ""Lite Aerobic Workout"" is designed for active elderly people. And ""Yogacize"" is, apparently, designed for the clinically insane. (The box says that one was a ""Bestseller in Europe."")

The kickboxing workouts probably aren't that bad, and I'm sure the aerobics, if you squint to block out the brightness of the day-glo outfits (or maybe just wear sunglasses?) are probably fine, but if you're the kind of person who buys exercise videos anyway, it's not going to add much to your routine. I say don't bother.",1136851200,8,1870,4.6006006006006
