4396333,5,B004KCAYXC,"Judge Brett Cullum, DVD Verdict -- ""Hildegard von Bingen is someone you could play many ways--a saint or mad woman possessed by her own insanity; a daft con woman; or a supernatural force. Smartly VISION does not play into the hype, and is comfortable showing a woman who sincerely believes that God speaks through her. It also avoids putting a modern feminist spin on a figure who had no exposure to these concepts. She is simply a woman who learns how to maneuver in a world where men have always had the power. The film moves slowly, and goes through von Bingen's entire life. While it sometimes feels a little too calculated, it is amazing what von Trotta and Sukowa manage to do with the rich material. And the DVD from Zeitgeist is as much of a treat as the film itself. We get panel discussions from both the Telluride Film Festival, as well as the film's premiere at the Goethe Institute in New York; a sit down interview with the director by Gary Giddings; and a booklet that reminds me of something Criterion would put out.""",1303257600,20,1034,4.53475935828877
4396334,5,B004KCAYXC,"For my tastes, this was one of the top films of 2010 - a gorgeous biopic of a strongly willed nun of the Middle Ages who reinvented the meaning of spirituality for her time.  Barbara Sukowa gives a subtle, nuanced performance of this philosopher, mystic, herbalist, musician, playwright who insisted on creating a special cloister of female nuns against the wishes of the male religious hierarchy.  There were those after her, of course...one thinks of St. Theresa of Avila...but the accomplishments of Hildegard Von Bingen were certainly more varied.  For example, she created an entirely new kind of musical religious play.  She experimented with the healing power of herbs.

What makes her portrayal so interesting in the movie is that she is not uni-dimensional.  At various times Hildegard Von Bingen appears submissive or strong,  compassionate or stern, independent and emotionally weak, hard headed and mystic.  The power of the actresses performance is that Hildegard's thoughts are not necessarily the same as her actions.

I love the luscious historical background of those authentic, old European cloisters.  Every moment, the film kept me breathless.  This is a thinking persons' movie about the wonders of true religious spirituality.",1298073600,100,1248,5.348717948717948
4396335,5,B004KCAYXC,"I have always been fascinated with Hildegard von Bingen, her music, her books, but although the film was well acted, brilliantly filmed, and had an amazing score, I think it needed to be a bit longer. I wanted to know more about her illness. That said, I liked the portrayal of her humanity as well as her spirituality. She was one of many enlightened, talented, intelligent women living in a very backward time for women, and in an oppressively male-dominated religion; this film addressed that very well and left the viewer wanting to learn more.",1500681600,,548,4.778947368421052

4396341,4,B004KCAYXC,"The movie was very entertaining, but definitely take it with a grain of salt. There are many details of this movie that are historically inaccurate, or just plain didn't happen. There is little knowledge about the day-to-day life of these nuns, so it makes sense that they had to fabricate small details to make an interesting plot.

4396352,3,B004KCAYXC,This movie took artistic liberality regarding the relationships and great misrepresentation of religious life.

4396364,5,B004KCAYXC,"I have seen this movie a few times and like it.  I am an orthodox Roman Catholic and enjoy learning about saints.  Writings, and in this case, music of the Doctors are often considered inspired by the Holy Spirit; this does not mean they are infallible, but it does mean that they contribute significantly to the formulation of Christian teaching in at least one area. I think those who produced this movie may have overemphasized Hildegard's independence of intellect and will and overly denigrated Church hierarchy.  However, on balance, the film shows that the Church very much valued her as a prophetic visionary and a brilliant intellect.  I would recommend it.",1470873600,3,666,4.972972972972973

The religious and cultural details were really surprising. There are lots of reasons to watch this. I think there will be something for everyone. I've only seen it once, but I also suspect that it's the type of movie where you will see something different with subsequent viewings.

Nuns walked hugging the walls, heads down, hands hidden in their habits.  Nuns did not run flopping around like giant vultures, hands akimbo, shoes clattering on walkways.  They did not sit at choir w/ hands exposed, resting on their laps.  A nun, even an abbess, did not appear anywhere alone in the presence of men, unless escorted by at least one other nun.

Why were no religious consultants used, e.g., an older Benedictine nun whose speciality is ancient religious life, or perhaps beloved Hildegard herself?",1462147200,9,656,5.150943396226415

4396397,4,B004KCAYXC,"Vision: From the Life of Hildegard Von Bingen
Hildegard Von Bingen in Portrait

These are the kinds of movies Hollywood does not produce.  Hildegard von Bingen was a 12th century nun.  Ohalso abbess.  Ohalso visionary.  And unofficial saint.  And musical composer [some of her liturgical music is still performed today].  And scholar.  And nurse, and pharmacist, and physician, and scientist.  And theologian.  And playwright.  This woman undoubtedly was a genius.  After centuries of relative obscurity, in recent decades there is renewed interest in this astonishing figure.  These two movies tell a part [only a part] of her tale.  Vision is in German with English subtitling available.  The second is in English.  Both are very much worth watching and it is interesting to watch both and see how the same events can be portrayed very differently.

4396402,4,B004KCAYXC,"This is a gripping historical drama. I agree with some of the other reviewers that the film seemed to end abruptly and that some areas seemed skimmed over. For this reason, I gave it four stars. Because I do not know enough about the period, it is hard for me to judge the degree of accuracy in the portrayl of Hildegard  von Bingen or her world. But as a film, it held my interest.
  As usual, the photography, screenwriting, directing and acting are all first-rate.  I am a big fan of both the director and the lead actress, having seen the work of both in other films, most especially the biopic about Hannah Ahrendt. I have already told several friends about the film because few directors seem interested in attempting an honest historical drama...as opposed to a soap opera in period costumes and setting.  The question I have about the film, which is leading me to further reading, is how much of Hildegard's conduct was a function of ego/ambition and how much was the result of genuine faith. This is ultimately the question posed by the film.  It deserves an honest answer which I hope to find by reading primary sources in translation.",1446768000,,1145,4.615763546798029
4396403,5,B004KCAYXC,"Prior to watching the movie, I had no idea of the life of St. Hildegard. The movie shows her to be a courageous individual with a gift of visions. Later, I was surprised to learn that she is considered, ""Doctor"" of the Catholic Church; one of four females Saints to be granted that status.  Now, I am glad I chose to watch the movie.",1446422400,,333,4.203125

4396409,4,B004KCAYXC,"I have watched this movie numerous times over the course of some years, if that says anything for it. However, I would not recommend it for everyone. You have to have an interest in the life of a holy woman, and at least a relative curiosity about life in a medieval convent, which unfortunately not everyone has. I say unfortunately, because if you do have that interest, this is a great chance to get a feel for what it might have been like to be a woman, a mystic, a writer, a visionary, a nun, a healer, a composer of music, an advisor to kings, an author, a prophet, a saint, a doctor of the church, and a preacher - all in an era so foreign to ours! I do wish the movie had explored her life more in depth, and I am not entirely sure on some of the casting choices. Some other nuances seemed a bit off too, but overall, if you are the type of person capable of VISION - go for it! It is unlike any other film out there in many ways.",1444348800,2,938,4.021390374331551

4396413,2,B004KCAYXC,"I was initially drawn to this film by the reviews, but ended up being disappointed. I am not sure what the intended approach of this film was, whether the producer wanted to portray a negative, neutral, or positive view of nuns, monks, Catholicism etc. Doing what I can to learn more about the Catholic faith over the past couple years, this film stands out as one of the ones I liked the least. I did not find the acting convincing at all, but that aside, I also did not find the movie to be in line with other books, movies, documentaries, or experiences that I have had. I have been on a few monastery and convent retreats, and they were wonderful. Even if the film's intended aim was to portray the church negatively, I found the acting to be lacking. I did not find the nuns or monks convincing at all.

As a side note, some works about the saints and the church that inspired me are: The Reluctant Saint, Into Great Silence, God's Doorkeeper, Mark Twain's book on Joan of Ark,  The Passion of Joan of Arc, The Secrets of St. Therese, Mysteries of the Jesus Prayer (a good film about the Orthodox faith), Monsieur Vincent, and A Man for all Seasons.

Those of you interested in Benedictine live would see his Rule come to life; Hildegard was an ""oblation"", given by her parents. Also, there are other interesting aspects of monastery life portrayed in this film. It is also exquisitely filmed (cinematography). However, one part I didn't understand or like: Hildegard's illness was never explained. I always thought that she had migraines? But in this film, it appears more like catalepsy? Or perhaps it was a sort of Basilar Migraine? It didn't show any of her famous migraine/fortification drawings (very disappointing), but it did display her musical talents. It also strongly showed how she had to contend with both monastic and feudal authorities, and the way she had to overcome her own attachments, as well as reigning in her passions, and governing her gifts.

4396420,3,B004KCAYXC,I watched the whole thing because I wanted to know more about this lady. It is not that well done as far as continuity and assumes the audience has some pre-existing knowledge of the time she lived in.

4396424,5,B004KCAYXC,"Sometimes I muse: what if I woke up and found myself in the middle of the 12th century in Western Europe? What was life really like? The present film centering on one of the most ""uppity"" women of the Middle Ages, Hildegard von Bingen, takes you into the medieval world as few films do. As much as we often like to idealize the Middle Ages, particularly since the 19th century, the period was anything but ideal. Unlike today, people had few rights, and the powers-that-be could uplift or destroy almost at a whim. In the church, people with power used threats of persecution, usually in the name of heresy or blasphemy, which could result in excommunication and even execution as a means to reign people into modes of behavior which fit their desires and designs. Hildegard von Bingen was one of the few people who stood up to these forces and refused to bow to unreasonable demands easily.

Hildegard was remarkable because she was a woman who challenged predominantly male authority during an age when women wielded very little political influence outside of noble circles. Some queens did have some authority in political realms, but an abbess of a monastery making requests and even demands of bishops and other nobles was almost unheard of. An abbess had authority within her cloister but rarely outside. Typically abbesses were expected to be completely obedient to the local abbot and bishop, following their orders without question on bended knee. But Hildegard was not afraid to vocalize her desires and even her frustrations in front of very powerful forces. She is famous for having visions and claiming communication with God, an assertion which infuriates the local church leaders, who contest that such claims are an insult to the prophets of scripture. Why should God single her out and give her insight not given to bona fide holy people of the Bible? However, she wins favor with one of the bishops who allows her dialogs to be transcribed. Another aspect of Vision, like Name of the Rose, concerns the beautiful medieval books.

The 12th century was markedly different from modern society today but I think there were aspects more similar than we like to acknowledge. If we take a peak behind the curtain of castles and cathedrals, we see the same human desires and weaknesses we all share, which I think is one of the points of Vision. A large part of the film involves Hildegard's attachment to a young novice nun, Richardis, and the relationship becomes closer than even one of mother and daughter. Unfortunately, political and ecclesiastical power threatens the relationship, and not even Hildegard has enough influence to stop it.

The present film is a wonderful tribute to one of the most remarkable figures of the Middle Ages. Barbara Sukowa offers a tour-de-force performance as the medieval abbess who defied convention during an age when non-conventional voices were often silenced, and sometimes violently. The scenes appear to have been shot in real medieval churches and castles which brings the viewer into the 12th century in a way very uncommon in most cinema which depicts these times. Although the 12th century is now 800 to 900 years away, the atmosphere is strangely familiar. Although details about everyday life would probably be unbearable for most of us in the modern age, such as the darkened candle-lit rooms and the constant threat of illness, many desires and fears which permeated life then are not unlike today. High-ranking officials often sought power while there were others who simply wanted to love and be loved and find the best means possible to bring this into being. People in the Middle Ages were still human beings.",1433894400,,3676,4.944983818770226

4396441,5,B004KCAYXC,"I have watched this film many times, and each time I find some new information - it's a wonderful film.  I do not mind the subtitles because I always have them on, even when watching a movie made in English, because some actors mumble!  This film is very enlightening, it's an open window to learn as much as possible about the restricted lives of women religious in the early Middle Ages.  Who knew that women of modest means were not allowed to enter convents then - it didn't matter if you had a vocation, to be accepted, wealthy women had to bring in a ""dowry""  - either money or land - because that was how convents paid their bills.  There is also another movie (which shall remain nameless) out on St. Hildegard; it was filmed in English but pales by a comparison, no character development at all, much like watching a comic book come to life.

St. Hildegard was so exceptional in so many areas that it would be impossible to include every single event in a movie of only 110 minutes - some of the reviewers set the bar of what wasn't covered so high that it would take a movie running for over a week just to hit all of the high points. Suffice it to say that In the Middle Ages women religious were not allowed to preach - St. Hildegard was the only woman ever allowed then, and that by papal approval, to preach outside her abbey.  Her advice was sought by many notables of the day.  The jealous abbot of the larger male religious abbey to which her smaller convent was attached, did everything in his power to ""keep her in her place"", but ultimately failed.  She kept up a running communication with fellow mystic St. Bernard of Clairvaux who championed her cause.  What a woman!

There is a previous reviewer who objected to and made much out of ""all of the kissing"" in the movie...In all the times that I've viewed this movie, I hadn't noticed that at all - I had to go back to rewatch it to pick up on it, but I guess that ultimately, we all find what we're looking for.  It's probably due to the movie being a ""foreign"" European film - I have immediate family still living over there, and when we get together, there's always lots of kissing, air-kisses and lip kisses - to them it's just like Americans shaking hands - it's just what they do, it's a cultural thing, not a sexualized thing.",1408579200,,2305,4.359813084112149

4396444,1,B004KCAYXC,"I wanted to like this film but it was a waste of time.  Sure the photography was good as well as the costuming and some of the acting.  The musical score was well done but maybe only a very little was taken from what St. Hildegarde, herself, wrote but I am not expert here.  St. Hildegard wrote books of her visions and the revelation of what they meant told to her by a Voice; music, and poetry; books about diseases and medicinal cures and things observed in nature and thus was a student and teacher of science.

This movie was basically a kind of soap opera in German with english subtitles IMHO with characters borrowed from history but not historically accurate.  My main impression after watching it was I didn't learn anything about why St. Hildegard is considered a saint or why she was declared a Doctor of the Catholic Church.  Nothing in this movie would clue anyone in on that.  It seemed to focus on someone's ideas of what were the relationships in St. Hildegarde's life and then interpreting them for everyone.  No thanks! If I had wanted to watch a fiction movie I could have.  This one pretends to be about St. Hildegard but sadly it isn't.

One of the most glaring lies was that Abbot Kuno when she got sick was ready to let her die rather than let her move.  Actually when Hildegard got sick then Abbot Kuno became convinced that the move and founding of the new convent was God's will and gave her permission to go.  Was the pregnant nun real? Who knows and I don't have time to do the research on it so considering this film makers track record on number lies detected thus far I am assuming that incident didn't happen or if it did it was unconnected with the move of the convent to Rupertsberg.

There should some kind of penalty here on earth for film makers who doing a biographical work outright lie or just make up things about the person biographed.

You will do better to search google on St. Hildegard or get some of her books.

 I was hoping and was again disappointed by a biographical movie of a Saint.  Can't these filmmakers stick to the facts?  The lives of all the Saints I have read are amazing and provide plenty of material for a good movie but movie makers ignore the truth and instead focus on fictionalizing the lives of the Saints.  So far the film that has come the closest to not offending the truth about a Saint has been The Song of Bernadette.

This movie:  What a disappointment!

4396449,5,B004KCAYXC,"I had heard Hildegard von Bingen's music but only knew a little about her life.  I think I expected the film to be somewhat dreary and dark so I  was wonderfully surprised.  I have no idea how accurate the portrayal of the lives of the nuns is.  Some reviewers think that the film overly modernized them.  Others felt that significant portions of Hildegard's life were omitted.  Still others (quite a few) objected to seeing the nuns and priests kissing on the lips!  I guess my ignorance served me well because I enjoyed every bit of it.  If I had any criticism it's that the star, although a brilliant actress, seemed a little too  robust for the role.  Hildegard described herself as physically weak and I would have expected a more delicate, ethereal type woman.  The supporting cast is very good.  I particularly liked the man who played Hildegard's long-time support and friend. Besides his usual benign face he is terrific when he's playing the devil in their play.  The young woman who plays Hildegard's protegee is luminously lovely.

The film is visually sumptuous, even though most of it is set inside convents and monasteries where the prevailing color is black.  Perhaps it does over-emphasize what we would consider feminist principles but I didn't find it objectionable.  I thought the film maker struck a good balance between presenting Hildegard's visionary life and her practical one.

I think this is a very enjoyable film for a wide range of people.  I'm not Catholic and I loved it.  It is in German with subtitles so if this upsets you, stay away.  Also beware....there is some kissing on the lips!  :-)",1389312000,2,1625,4.794223826714801

Women had no real place even in the convent and in the Church.  Well worthwhile for the history of that period in Europe.  A.M. Seidler,1375142400,3,484,4.465909090909091

4396453,5,B004KCAYXC,"Barbara Sukowa stars as the twelfth-century nun and magistra Hildegard of Bingen who defied an abbot at Disibodengerg, who had visions, who stood up to her persecutors, who founded two convents, who wrote nine books and one play, who taught herself and her nuns the healing properties of herbs (two of her books are about the care of the body and the various elements), who corresponded with Popes and Kings, who composed over 100 hymns, antiphons, etc. that are still played today, who traveled the country preaching, and who invented a language (not mentioned in the film, alas). And who was supported in her endeavors by her life-long friend and provost Volmar. Sukowa is brilliant as Hildegard--funny, passionate, pious, manipulative, jealous, brave, talented and charismatic. Those who want a more faithful rendering of her adventures and discoveries in better chronological order will be disappointed by their truncation in the movie (expected). For instance, there is no reference to the vivid illustrations in her first book, Scivias. For a film called ""Vision"" this absence of the highly visual nature of her divine reveries is a huge omission. My speculation is that it was too costly for the filmmakers to show the heavily guarded images without paying the libraries that ""own"" them, or that the movie attempts to throw into question Hildegard's veracity. It is a very human portrait of a complex and mysterious woman. Also, I wanted more of her own music played--there is the Ordo Virtutis enacted--LOVELY! But the film downplays her compositions (same reason? copyright issues?) BTW, she was finally canonized in 2012 and made a Doctor of the Church, the highest honor given to a Catholic ecclesiast--an acknowledgement of one's contribution to ecclesiastical knowledge and faith.

4396464,4,B004KCAYXC,"Saint Hildegard von Bingen get the star treatment in this wonderfully evocative film of her life. Hildegard is one of a number of unusual medieval women, who bucked the male-dominated church hierarchy to establish monasteries and gain prominence. Barbara Sukowa is absolutely stunning as Hildegard. She plays her with a combination of toughness and vulnerability that captures Hildegard's fierce internal drive as well as her deep emotional needs. A relationship with a younger nun borders on desperate attachment, but never crosses the line into the erotic.

Hildegard was a pioneer in music and medicine. She wrote chants that are still enjoyable today. Her medicine, based on herbs and precious stones, may not be as useful today as it was in her day. But in combination with her certainty and tender patient care, it likely inspired the confidence that allowed healing to begin. Hildegard was also an able political tactician, playing off donors and supportive bishops against her clerical enemies.

The film didn't do as well with portraying the vast difference between the medieval world and our own. Superstition, ignorance and extreme piety were extreme and accepted. While the film does show self-flagellation and spurious medical practices, it shows characters reacting much as moderns would - with revulsion at self-injury and bland acceptance of the power of crystals. And little was said about the value of Hildegard's heavenly visions, upon which her reputation hung. Probably a good thing - they might have made her seem silly or offputtingly pious. I wish too that more of Hildegard's ethereal music had made it into the film.

But, given that I knew next to nothing about this extraordinary woman before viewing this work, I am grateful to have a visual peg to hang my future reading about her. The Catholic Church has just named her a Doctor of the Church. That alone should bring interest in her life. Though ""Vision"" tones down the strangeness of Hildegard's belief system and work, it is not a bad way to get to know her.",1351468800,2,2042,5.053412462908012

I'm waiting for the US format version of ""The Intouchables"" to become available, and the collection will be complete.

4396466,1,B004KCAYXC,"This movie is beautifully filmed and interesting, but offers a cold and superficial interpretation of Hildegard, tainted by secular historical revisionism. It is the sort of movie that attempts to depict a Christian mystic as admirable, but quite apart from the mystic's relationship with God, leaving a half-sketched caricature as protagonist. Rather than evoking the real Hildegard through her writings and spirituality, this film chooses to focus on how she got want she wanted through intelligence and cunning, inviting us to admire her political will rather than any sort of religious wisdom or example she might have offered. The content of her visions is barely touched upon, with the director inviting us to admire Hildegard as a proto-feminist who simply happened to be a nun. The problem is that Hildegard was a nun who happened to be a proto-feminist, not vice versa, and her relationship with Jesus in prayer is central to understanding her. As a result, one walks away from this film with a mild interest in medieval politics, but without any sort of deep insight into Hildegard's personality or understanding of her as a real person. She remains as remote from the viewer as the director is from God. An intriguing film for agnostics, perhaps, even though it is neither gripping nor involving. I'm glad I saw it, and it is certainly worth a rental, but I would not encourage others to actually purchase it. For a much better example of an avant garde European treatment of a Catholic saint, check out the ""Therese"" film that won at Cannes in 1986. It is neither preachy nor fawning, but at least gives you a sense of who Therese of Lisieux was and what she believed, whether you agree with it or not.",1343260800,68,1714,4.853242320819112

4396469,5,B004KCAYXC,"Simply astounding. There is a wisdom and grace to this film that transcends religion. It is lushly and richly portrayed, acted, filmed, directed and shot; yet moves with both simplicity and deep humanity. It is a tender look at the tenderest sentiments of love, loss and other emotions and paints a majestic tapestry of medieval life in general, as well a religious life. This film is not so much religious as it is emotional; spiritual. I highly recommend it.

4396470,3,B004KCAYXC,"First thought this is a visually beautiful movie! I did not really seem to care for Hildegard like I do when watching other saints movie's but it does make me want to learn more about this amazing woman. In my opinion the real star of the movie was Hannah Herzsprung who played Richardis a young nun who joins the abbey and becomes like a daughter to Hildegard she has a glow about her that just draws you in to her character. The one thing that bothered me was all the kissing! According to the director Margarethe von Trotta thats how people concluded a contract and to celebrate meetings. So a couple of times and we get the point but in my opinion she goes overboard.  It starts off when Hildegard is given to the monastery at the age of 8 and to seal the deal her dad kisses the Priest on the Lips, another time after she tells her friend (a monk/priest) about her visions she kisses him on the lips, when a new girl Richardis is brought to become a nun, her mom seals the deal with Hildegard with a kiss on the lips, one more example when Hildegard and another nun go to the bishop for permission to build a monastery the deal is sealed with you guessed it the Bishop kissing both Hildegard and the other nun on the lips.  This may have been how contracts were done but just seemed weird in a religious movie.",1330300800,9,1315,4.27710843373494
4396471,4,B004KCAYXC,"Overall, this movie is really good and well acted, but there are a few things about it that made me somewhat uncomfortable. First of all, it does show everyone kissing eachother on the lips as a greeting, or to show affection, and I do realize that this was the custom in the Middle Ages, but it didn't feel right to me to see a nun kissing a priest on the lips. Last, but definitely not least, there is a scene where Hildgard,( who is a very educated and learned woman), graphically describes certain anatomical functions of a man that I think would make anyone blush . I always fast forward that part when I come to it to be honest. Other than those two things, this is a good movie worth buying.",1327017600,5,698,4.295454545454546

I have recommended it to several friends unafraid of watching foreign films.  It is one of the best films about a woman who was deeply gifted and unafraid to share that giftedness even in the face of danger to her own life.  Hidegard von Bingen is a Medieval religiuos leader and mystic many are being exposed to in modern times. And from whom they are finding both wisdom and life meaning.

Of course, two hours traffic of no stage (or screen) can truly do justice to so remarkable a polymath; but the beautiful cinematography, eloquent screenplay, heartfelt performances, and gently wry humour here combine to offer an admirable and heartfelt attempt -- one which hopefully will move viewers to explore for themselves more of the legacy of this extraordinary woman!",1322697600,2,613,4.903846153846154

Knowing a little about the life and works of Hildegard von Bingen, I was surprised by the omission of her contributions to music and science as well as the depiction of the anchorite Jutta.  Von Bingen's most known work, the Scivias, is completely ignored as it relates to her visions.  Oddly enough, the director also neglects Hildegard von Bingen's wide correspondence with political and religious figures of the day.  If you don't get caught up in the historical 'expectations' of the life of the saint and enjoy it as a work of cinematic art, the movie was a beautiful representation of the period.",1314144000,2,647,4.801801801801802

It seems that movies with spiritual figures rarely capture the sense of the spirituality, compassion, love, and strength of that figure without going overboard in one direction or another, and this movie did a nice job of getting it just right with Hildegard. It was interesting seeing her interactions with those with positions of authority in the Church, as well as with her fellow nuns. Whether accepted or hated, she kept going her own way and doing what she needed to do for the good of humanity, then and into the future.

With very nice cinematography and music to complement the story, I was glad to have seen it.",1311638400,5,683,4.636363636363637
4396481,3,B004KCAYXC,"I am a Hindu, and I am interested in saints of other faiths, especially their Spiritual discoveries. Saint Hildegard is certainly one of them. I am not an expert on her, and I should say I liked this movie to an extent. I know she was a catholic, but this movie is far too limited to the catholic audience. From the little I know about her, I can say with reasonable certainty that she extended catholic teachings. To me, that is the essence of Saint Hildegard, and this movie absolutely fails to capture that. It is really a movie of personal relationships with other nuns and church officials.

Perhaps the movie makers did not want to think outside of the box. But I so wished they did so. I would have loved to see a discussion on the impact of her spiritual revelations on the catholic doctrine, in what ways they challenged and in what ways they complemented the existing teachings.

The biggest failure of this movie is that they have failed to present her relevance in today's world. She certainly is relevant today. I hear that she is quite an inspiration for New age spirituality, although I do not know the details exactly how. Nevertheless, I would have liked to see a bit of that as well.",1309219200,7,1201,4.504587155963303
4396482,4,B004KCAYXC,"From German director Margarethe von Trotta comes ""Vision"", a biopic of the 12th century Benedictine nun, composer, herbalist, and visionary Hildegard von Bingen. Given to an abbey in childhood by her affluent parents, Hildegard (Barbara Sukowa) is elected magistra, or ""teacher"", in adulthood. Sickly and always hungry for knowledge, she continually conducts experiments to increase her knowledge of herbal medicine, passing it on to the other nuns, all while composing poems, songs, and dictating books of her religious visions. She claimed that God communicated with her through visions of a bright light. With the support of a sympathetic monk Brother Volmar (Heino Ferch), she is recognized as a visionary. But her commitment to building a separate abbey for her nuns places her at odds with the Abbott (Alexander Held) to whom she has sworn obedience.

Hildegard von Bingen actually founded two abbeys. Many of her accomplishments have been omitted or hinted at in order to focus on her interactions with Jutta (Lena Stolze), a nun with whom she was raised, and her favorite pupil, the spirited young Richardis von Stade (Hannah Herzsprung). These relationships are used to illuminate Hildegard's character, but I'm not sure how much could realistically be known about them. She was quite accomplished as a scientist and composer. She corresponded with popes and kings in a time when it was hardly possible for a woman to contemplate such ambition. And she was later canonized. Margarethe von Trotta's treatment has a transcendental quality, which she has chosen over a litany of Hildegard's accomplishments. This is effective, if a little open-ended, but it sometimes left me wanting more facts.

The DVD (Zeitgeist 2011): There are three interviews with director Margarethe von Trotta. ""Margarethe von Trotta Tribute and Q&A with Annette Insdorf and Barbara Sukowa"" (27 min) was filmed at Telluride in 2009, when von Trotta received an award. Sukowa introduces the director, and Insdorf, a professor from Columbia University, interviews her. ""Margarethe von Trotta Interview with Gary Giddons"" (12 min) is also from Telluride. Giddons is a film writer. ""Goethe-Institute Q&A"" (40 min) is a 2010 conversation with von Trotta and writer Robert Boyers. There is also a US theatrical trailer (2 min). The film is in German with optional English subtitles.",1306800000,8,2358,5.319034852546917
4396483,3,B004KCAYXC,"My wife and I really enjoyed this video-- as far as it went. Which, alas, was not far enough. We have studied the life and work of St. Hildegard for almost fifteen years, so were familiar with her biography. This is very nicely presented here: the scenery is beautiful; the music (though not enough of it) was lovely; the acting is excellent. There is much to recommend this film, certainly. But it draws to a close much too quickly: We are barely introduced to the emperor, Frederick Barbarossa, when Hildegard is off on her preaching tour across Europe. We hear nothing more of her relationship with the emperor, or of the pope whom she [persuaded to return to Rome. There are no references to the illustrations of her visions, magnificent in their own right. Indeed, her works (including Scivias) are touched upon quite briefly, some of them (like her work in medicine and the natural sciences) barely at all. Indeed, the entire last twenty years of her life is completely missing-- details of her tours and correspondence, her moving of her convent to Eibingen, the interdict which she managed successfully to have overturned-- all not mentioned at all. Instead, the film seems to dwell too long on her relationship with her dear Richardis, an interesting topic, but hardly as pivotal as it is presented here. In the desire for ""narrative"" (that is, soap opera) many aspects of her fascinating history are ingored or paid short shrift. We were very disappointed when the ending came so suddenly, with Hildegard rising from her sick bed, hitting the road, and literally riding off into the sunset-- a full twenty years too early! There is a great need for a sequel to finish off the story of the remaining 20 years of this fascinating woman's life.",1304380800,98,1751,4.801324503311259
4396484,5,B004KCAYXC,"I had the honor of previewing the extraordinary German-language film ""Vision"", the story of  the great Benedictine nun Hildegard von Bingen. Not since the magnificent 1980's Spanish mini-series ""Teresa de Jesus"" has a film so accurately yet poignantly portrayed a famous woman saint. Newly released on DVD, the Zeitgeist production, directed by Margarethe von Trotta, stars Barbara Sukowa as the enigmatic twelfth century German abbess. One of the most extraordinary figures of the Middle Ages, Hildegard was not only a mystic but an author, a musician, a foundress and a director of souls, learned in the natural sciences as well as in theology and philosophy. She wrote some of the first mystery plays, laying the groundwork for modern drama. Madame Sukowa is able to convey the inner stillness of the contemplative spirit of Hildegard along with her strength and common sense. All the while, the very human side of the saint is always present as she struggles with those who oppose her, as well as with the devil, and with herself.

Resisting the temptation to make the film into a piece of feminist propaganda, ""Vision"" portrays Hildegard as an obedient daughter of the Church. Her obedience is by no means mere childish acquiescence, as the vow of obedience is too often misconstrued, but an expression of a vibrant faith. St. Hildegard is not afraid to take a firm but charitable stand against injustice. She will brook no infractions of the Rule which protects the serene and disciplined life of her nuns. She is a true mother ready to fight to the death for her spiritual children.

Because of the film's commitment to authenticity there are many elements of medieval life, such as the custom of everyone embracing each other on the lips, which seems odd to modern sensibilities. Hildegard is deposited with the nuns when still a small child as a gift to God from her parents. The cloister becomes the only world she has ever known and the nuns her only family. When a young nun Sister Richardis becomes like the natural daughter she never had, Mother Hildegard objects strongly to Richardis being sent away to become the abbess of another community. At first it appears that the saint has given in to an inordinate attachment but eventually it becomes clear that Hildegard can see that no good will come of the transfer, and she proves to be correct. An exceptionally powerful scene is when Hildegard is summoned to be questioned about her visions by several formidable churchmen. As they glower in anticipation of proving her to be a crazy woman or a demoniac, Hildegard faces them with such calm assurance that there is no doubt as to who will emerge triumphant.

Another unique aspect of the film is the rare but real depiction of the vocation of nuns as joyful brides. From the lustrous beauty of the herb gardens to the austerity of the monastic halls, every scene radiates a light and beauty that suggest there is more to living than what the eye can see. Although the viewer is gently and continually reminded of the sacrificial lifestyle of Mother Hildegard and her nuns, a mysterious sense of exultation permeates the film. It becomes clear that while the Benedictines have renounced the world they have been given in return a gift so precious that it is beyond price.
