8319031,3,B001LNON6W,"I love obscure horror, particularly Paul Naschy and his multi-roled B movies. I was excited as hell when I found Dr. Jekyll and the Werewolf, a film that I hadn't seen, only to be dismayed at the horrible quality. If you are a Paul Naschy fan, then buy it  but if you aren't a huge fan of VHS to DVD tranfers then wait for a company like Severin or Blue Underground to pick it up and put it on Blu Ray.",1371859200,3,402,3.962962962962963
8319032,3,B001LNON6W,"Great movie, if you like the Spanish way of doing horror, and pretty much an essential purchase for any self-respecting Paul Naschy or Jack Taylor fan. This is definitely one of my favourites from the long running series of Wolfman movies that Naschy did throughout his amazingly prolific career. The transfer is ok (B or 6/10) and certainly very watchable, though it's not anywhere near as good as the brilliant Mondo Macabre version (A+ and 10/10 for quality) which is pristine and very obviously not sourced from video tape - as this version is - and here the picture is a little dark and grainy, as is pretty common with video to dvd transfers. But the really big attraction of this very worthy Sinister Cinema version is that it's 100% uncut, so all the 'nudity' and general naughtiness - not vast amounts of gore on show - is still very much intact ;-) So all in all a very decent package - artwork is fine too - and one I'm very pleased I made. But I would add also that for real fans of this series, or Spanish/Euro horror in general, that you should try and purchase a copy of the Mondo Macabre version, if only for it's superb picture quality. This SC version is also dubbed into English, wheras the Mondo Macabre version is the original Spanish version (clothed), with English subtitles. So to sum up, whilst I'd give the film itself 4 stars, I can only really give this version 3 (three and a half would possibly be fairer) due to the nature of the transfer, but as is say it's very watchable indeed, and nowhere near as poor as some of the video to dvd transfers available out there to fans of this kind of marvellous trash ! Recommended.",1308096000,6,1651,4.470198675496689
8319033,4,B001LNON6W,"The Mondo DVD is a beautiful transfer of the widescreen Spanish language 'covered ' version.
It is in Spanish and contains English subtitles.
This release from Sinister contains the English export cut of the film, which has 4 sequences filmed with nudity and more sadism.
These scenes are in the Mondo Spansih version, but are alternate, covered takes.
The Sinister release is full screen and has some color problems, but it is in English and has the better exploitation content.
Buy them both!",1304640000,15,494,4.963855421686747
