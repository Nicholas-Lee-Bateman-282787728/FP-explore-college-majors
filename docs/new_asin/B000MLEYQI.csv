8169794,4,B000MLEYQI,"This great 1981 French-German co-production, whose focus is espionage and counter-terrorism, stars Philippe Noiret as the head of a covert European counter-terrorism group called ""Hangar"" which suspects a woman, Birgitt Haas, of several acts of terrorism. Although in some ways dated in the context of today's political atmosphere, the film's premise is strong and nicely plotted, as well as paced.

One of Hangar's members, Colonna, is having an affair with the wife of Bauman, a man whom Colonna picks as the patsy for snagging Birgitt Haas. The film works really well because there's a perfect fusion of emotional need, almost bordering on dependency, and political violence; ultimately we see that the two are so closely correlated that it's impossible to separate them. This fusion of emotional need and political violence converges in the overwhelming sense of desperation both Bauman and Haas are driven by, and that ultimately brings them together.

The English dubbing does not exactly ruin the film, but it certainly would have been significantly better to have heard the original language and voices of the actors which include, besides Noiret, Jean Rochefort as Bauman and Lisa Kreuzer as Birgitt Haas.

It's a shame this is not on DVD. The development of the story is strong up to and including the ending; there's a real sadness that pervades the film which is reflected in Birgitt Haas' eyes, the soul of the story itself.

Definitely recommended.",1177804800,3,1462,5.182203389830509
