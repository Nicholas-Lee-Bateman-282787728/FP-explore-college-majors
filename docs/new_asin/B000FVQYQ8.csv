2592350,5,B000FVQYQ8,"This series is so good. It is about this awesome vampire named Alucard (Although it says Arucard on the credits) that works for a vampire killing organization named Hellsing. Kinda ironic isn't it. Anyways he turns this police girl named Seres into a vampire and kicks some major .... It is very short though which really ..., but you have to see this series anyways.
  The box set is worth it and you'll be happy with it. I don't reccomend this to any little kids out there below the age of four. You should be able to see what you want. There is a lot of blood and darkness. It's great.",1054598400,2,588,4.288288288288288
2592351,3,B000FVQYQ8,"The characters are awfully one-dimensional, the story is far from deep, and it just about all falls apart at the end -- so why should anyone care? Well, nobody should, really. And yet, I do. Sure, the story, set in modern day Britain, isn't particularly brilliant: Alucard, an incredibly powerful vampire decked out in a blood-red coat, serves a gelid female by the name of Sir Integra Hellsing, who runs a secret organization that eliminates vampires. They, along with Seras Victoria, a somewhat ditzy police girl Alucard turns into a vampire early on in the series, spend much of these 13 eps investigating 'freak' vampires, humans turned into vampires by having chips implanted -- none of which is really all that exciting. And there's no real character development to speak of; the characters are exactly the same at the end of the series as they are when first introduced. But the creators make up for most of this with style. Lots and lots of style, actually. Bloody battles, cool weapons, gorgeous gothic backdrops, heaps of attitude, slick soundtrack -- truly excellent stuff. And, of course, there's Alucard, whose cool, laid-back personality never gets old (nor does him showing off those enormous guns he wields). Taking place in Britain, the Japanese voice actors feel greatly out of place, so thankfully the dub is quite adequate. The extras are fairly standard stuff: sketches, ads and the like. But despite all its shortcomings, Hellsing manages to remain entertaining throughout, even during the last few eps where our hero does battle with Incognito, one of the most asinine villians in anime history. It's slick, violent, and always cool, one any vampire fan could enjoy, so long as they don't mind turning their brain off for a bit.",1054080000,25,1751,4.979522184300341
2592352,4,B000FVQYQ8,"Hellsing is a secret organization whose main objective is to destroy evil creatures, primarily vampires, in order to protect the country.  This set follows a rather loosely strung plot involving the Hellsing organization and more importantly it's most insteresting member; the enigmatic Alucard.  Alucard is infact a vampire who works with the Hellsing organization to help destroy those evil forces mentioned above.  Clearly this series is about style; the cool characters and their mysterious nature.  The soundtrack is astounding, think cowboy bebop type theme with spot on accurate jazz/rock music overlays (especially apparent when Alucard comes out to play).
The animation ranges from incredible to moderate.  I especially like the overexposed white effect they used to give characters and scenery a certain ""glow"".  Again, it's the overall style that wins you over.  When Alucard whips out his 454 custom pistol and blazes a few rounds off, you can't help but smile.  This animation is also a bit graphic in nature.  But there should be no problem seeing exploding zombie goons and blood soaked vampires in a series of this nature.
The plot as mentioned previously is not the best but it is enough to perpetuate the series.  Basically someone is making Vampires through the use of a cleverly designed chip that changes the poor victims body and DNA into that of a vampire.  Hellsing basically hunts and kills them.  But who's behind the these fake Vampires?  Why are they being made?  Most importantly can they be stopped?
The music is brilliant.  The funky suedo jazz music that Alucard strolls to is great.  The theme song is catchy and makes you want to watch the title sequence.  I can't speak highly enough about the musical value of this set.  The sound effects and voices (even in the dub) are accurate and depict the characters justly.
So now you ask, why only four stars?  The plot could have used some fine tuning and more character development.  The audio should have been remixed into Dolby Digtal or even Pro Logic to take greater advantage of this audio spectacle (Pioneer apparently likes to leave anime it in its original stereo sound).  I would reccomend this series to those who like great vampire stylistic anime.  But not to those who are looking for the next Vampire Princess Miyu (OAV).  This set won't likely lead you to rumunation.  But it will make you smile.",1053993600,9,2391,4.949748743718593
2592353,5,B000FVQYQ8,"It's about time that a vampire series has come out where the vampire isn't a [wimp].  This series offers some great animation, a cool story and some of the best characters that has appeared in a gothic series like this. Arucard doesn't take...from anybody and isn't afraid to tell that to anybody.  This is the best vampire series (along side Vampire Hunter D) as the standard for gothic animation.",1052524800,,398,4.753623188405797
2592354,5,B000FVQYQ8,"If you already are interested in anime, then you have heard of this one. Everything good you hear about this show is true. I really can't add too much except to comment on the english voices. I had seen all the episodes before I bought the box set, but they were all with sub-titles. Most of the time when they re-dub an anime, the voices are something they always manage to screw up (exsample, Vash from trigun, most of the cast of Rama) but I have to say here they are almost as good as their japanse counter-parts.",1052092800,,517,4.285714285714286
2592355,5,B000FVQYQ8,"Hellsing is the perfect mix of style, music, talent and idea. It takes place in Britain (where most bad things seem to happen) but present day. To mix things up though they add old school story, basic vampires controlling the world kinda plot... they add a twist though, at the head of fighting off this horde of demon vampires is a grand vampire called Alucard... as you find out he is not any NORMAL vampire in any sense... he shows off to be one of the most evil, heartless, intelligent and powerful characters of all time... villain and hero alike... the series combines excellent music, voice acting and animation. Great detail was given to each character and such. The weapons are awsome and the fight scene brilliant... the only complaint I have is under development... the series is 13 episodes... 13... from what I understand thats IT... FAR too short... no one, not even Alucard had any real development... you didnt' have time to get attached to the characters or story like that of the great Cowboy Bebop. Alucards powers were pushed, laying out everything he had within 13 episodes... Victoria had a huge story setup for her... but again within the 13 episodes nothing was done with her. Many MASSIVE characters were brought up and quickly passed from the show, the Valentine brothers for instance come in and leave in three episodes... HUGE characters that could last a good 30 episodes alone delt with in three... or Incognito... a villain of massive perportions delt with in 3 or 4 episodes... a vampire that matched Alucards power delt with so quickly?... he could have gone for some time... the entire series was rushed... none the less... it's worth the buy... wether your a Vampire fan, action, horror, fiction or just a anime fan... this is for you.",1051747200,11,1770,4.768729641693811
2592356,5,B000FVQYQ8,"The Japanese seem to find the western version of the Vampire myth quite appealing, and the expression of that fascination reaching a peak with the anime series Hellsing.
Set in modern-day Great Britain, Hellsing focuses on the effots of a powerful private enterprise headquartered in Great Britain and dedicated to defending ""God, Queen, and Country"" from the ravages of vampires.  Led by Dr. van Helsing descendent Sir Integra Hellsing (an icy-cool, determined woman) with the aide of her vampire minion Alucard--the coolest and toughest anime hero to come along in many a day, the Hellsing Organization faces an onslaught of man-made ""freak"" vampires and ghouls plus the dangerous Iscariot Organization of the Vatican and their knife-wielding human regenerator.
If you enjoy bloody anime, this series is for you.  It's not nearly as gruesome as many out there but does have more blood and violence than any of the stuff shown on Cartoon Network today.  If you like vampire anime, then this series is also for you; it's a neat take and breath of fresh air in a genre well-exercised in Japan.
The animation itself is done really well in terms of visual quality, with a blend of CG and hand-drawn cel work; however, it is somewhat more static in nature than much contemporary anime, comparable to that done for the Record of Lodoss War series.
The audio, though presented only in stereo sound, features a soundtrack you'll want to hunt down like a freak after fresh blood.  Surprisingly, the english dubbing is quite good, featuring British-accented voice actors far superior to the average anime dub.
Hellsing is an excellent addition to any anime fan's library and a must-watch for vampire lovers everywhere.",1051142400,104,1709,5.049645390070922
2592357,3,B000FVQYQ8,"Words can not describe how excited I was anticipating a full (even if only 13 episodes) series with a premise this [darn] cool.  The excitement only increased after the first several episodes.  Alucard has got to be the most wickedly awesome anti-hero in animated history (sorry, D).  No problem there.  The problem lies in Miss Seres Victoria who should have been an awesome and deep character, but instead remains whiny and virtually helpless throughout the entire series despite becoming a vampire in the very first episode.  Hello! Character development, where are you!?  In fact, the only distinguishable difference between her and the normal humans is that her eyes are red (and she's also drawn in a traditional stylized anime heroine manner whereas every other character is drawn more realistically, but I digress), she's got super strength, and she drinks blood -not from people, mind you, that would make her too interesting- from transfusion bags which she empties into a saucer (here, kitty, kitty).  All that aside, This is an interesting and stylish anime for those with darker tastes.  The first half of the series is thrilling, and the buildup is just brilliant.  But the second half gets bogged down in much less interesting plot ideas. They spend so much time setting the mood and chronicling Seres's almost nonexistent change from helpless police girl to helpless vampire girl (though she does get one good action sequence towards the end) that they forget to do anything particularly interesting over the second half of the series.  Nonetheless, Alucard alone is worth the purchase and Seres is still a very likeable character, even though I feel she was done a great disservice in this show's treatment of her.  Check it out if you're a vampire freak like me, but don't bother if you're looking for brilliant writing.  I pray for a second season that does the brilliant concept justice.

Addendum: Really, I should have rated this 4 stars, but anyhow ""Hellsing Ultimate"" is finally here and it is awesome.  It's essentially a remake of this series, but with much faster pacing, much less Ceres Victoria, and better action sequences.  Check it out.",1049328000,7,2168,5.016759776536313
2592358,5,B000FVQYQ8,"Hellsing in a nut-shell is the story of Dracula if he hadn't been killed but actually had been enslaved by Professor Abraham Van Helsing via alchemical means to serve him and his descendants.  The Van Helsing family forms a monster hunting organization known as Hellsing.

It's a fun anime for any Dracula fan.

I am disappointed in amazon's offensive editorial review though.  His name is Alucard.  he is Dracula.  Dracula is Alucard spelt backward. The fact that the editorial review uses the name ""Arucard"" is an insult.  It's only Arucard in Japan because of the lack of L in most Japanese pronunciations but in the anime the name is meant to be Dracula spelt backward so calling him Arucard is... kind of insulting.",1349222400,,720,4.804878048780488

This Anime has it all Good Action, Vampires, Vampire Hunters, A bad ass AntiHero, and lots of Violence.

The bad part of this anime is the Plot seems hurried and they quickly come up with a ending and the last fight is hard to understand.

The voice Actiong is good but i have seen better.

The Animation is Fluid and realy done well.

2592366,2,B000FVQYQ8,As a fan of the Hellsing series I can not honestly say this series is worth watching. There is no real reason to watch this series when Hellsing Ultimate is clearly the superior work.  While Alucard is badass if you watch the Hellsing Ultimate OVAs and compare them to the manga of the series you will see that the Hellsing Ultimate OVAs are perfectly animated version of the manga. So don't waste your money on the impure souls series as one it has nothing to do with the manga and two its not even finished. Hellsing Ultimate is the only true way to enjoy Hellsing animated.,1302048000,3,576,4.433962264150943
2592367,5,B000FVQYQ8,"This is an excellent series for anyone interested in vampire-related media. Main characters Alucard, Seras Victoria, Sir Integra Hellsing, Walter, and Ferguson. Alucard is a very old vampire in the employ of the Hellsing family who hunts down other vampires. Seras Victoria is a police-girl who gets turned by Alucard after a nasty incident involving an undead priest. Sir Integra Hellsing is the last remaining member of the Hellsing family and runs the Hellsing Organization responsible to the Queen for hunting vampires and ghouls. Walter is the retainer to the family and is also known as the Angel of Death, and Ferguson is in charge of the Organization's troops. The final episode (there are 13 in all) is my favorite episode and it's easy to see why. A little bit of intelligence is needed to understand the plots of the episodes, but the battles  are great for those who just want to see bloody brawls.",1299110400,,910,4.870967741935484
2592368,3,B000FVQYQ8,"There is one thing that I have to say about Hellsing, both this series and the OVAs: I love the English dubs. This is the one and only anime where I genuinely prefer the dub over the original, because the main characters are absolutely spot-on. Crispin Freeman is always good, and the English VAs for Walter, Seras, and Integra are so delightfully dry and British -- which feels appropriate, considering that the characters are British, and that the story (at least in this particular Hellsing) takes place mostly in Britain.

All that being said, this older Hellsing is pretty lackluster as a series, especially when compared to the OVAs. It's fun enough for a bloody vampire show, but that's about it. The plot doesn't follow the manga and ends up being holey and silly, the characters are underdeveloped, the animation is dated, and the music is hit-or-miss. The newer OVAs are markedly superior. They're much more intense in terms of story, character, animation, action, music, and philosophical underpinnings (for those who like a side of provocative moral questions with their vampire action).",1292198400,2,1099,5.038461538461538
2592369,4,B000FVQYQ8,"This anime was extremely well made. The graphics were dark and graphic matching the type of series this is. The audio was outstanding and the action was amazing. There were, however, a couple of things that did not make this series hit home for me. First the series is only 13 episodes, which leaves room for longing more. The series also is pretty incoherent, the beginning and end really do not fit in with the middle plot. The beginning just seems like they are adding much to the story except to further the characterization, the fixes this problem and has a smooth transition between episodes, but the end leaves wonder as to what happened, and what will happen.

*spoiler*Arucard pretty much just hack another vampire and boom series over. *end spoiler*

Though there are a few things that I found problematic with the series I still suggest adding it to your collection.",1286668800,2,877,4.7631578947368425
2592370,5,B000FVQYQ8,Very fast delivery and the item was in perfect condition. Hellsing is my favorite anime series and this service was excellant in getting it to me.,1280016000,,146,4.653846153846154
2592371,3,B000FVQYQ8,"As with many anime series this was made while the manga was written and so the animators quickly run out of source material and have to make up stuff (""filler"").  The problem here is while the filler material is good in its own right it is doesn't quite fit the rest of the series and so the series feels uneven.  Of the 13 episodes only 1-3, 5-6, part of 7, and 10 come from the manga and even they feel ""off"" due to different amounts of filler material being mixed into them.

Sadly by Episode 11 this series give up any attempt at even following the manga story line and as seen by the other filler material the anime suffers as a result.  There is a story going around that the studio doing this series quite literally ran out of money and had to wrap up the series in a hurry which would explain the totally unsatisfactory ending that is done in TEXT that leaves a LOT of plot thread dangling.

For fans of the manga who want a complete storyline I would recommend skipping this and going for the Ultimate OVA version as Seres, Walter, Anderson, and even Alucard get far more character development in that version then here.",1279238400,9,1129,4.357142857142857
2592372,5,B000FVQYQ8,"Very, very stylish and dark, with modern-day forces fighting against vampires.  Their ace in the hole is the vampire Alucard, one of the most powerful of his kind.  Team Hellsing faces off against real and artificial vampires, and the rest of the team members are not just window dressing, squaring off in their own epic battles against the forces of evil.

This is a very viscerally satisfying anime, with plenty of violence and blood to go around.  Definitely not for pre-teens, the series has some very disturbing undercurrents in the plots, as well as a very high violence quotient, sadistic villains, and so forth.  The opening theme is very well matched to the tone of the series, and the closing theme is ""Shine"" by 90's band Mr. Big, and a couple of cuts above most anime music.

2592376,4,B000FVQYQ8,"Out of many Vampire series I bearably watch, Hellsing and Vampire Hunter D are the only ones that make the list. It really isn't much about the art, the story line that is great (by today's standards they are ""weak""), but rather the characters that bring in some complex attitudes and feelings in this world of vampires. Alcuard, is pretty much your anti-hero; cold blooded and really doesn't care if humans die as long as he has his ""fun."" To him it's all about fighting the strongest of the strongest and satisfying his urge for blood. Seras Victoria the other main character on the other hand tries to fight the urges she feels to kill and maim, unlike Alcuard who follows his true feelings. Integra Hellsing, the leader of the Hellsing organization is just one tough cookie. To her killing, hunting vampires, keeping her men alive, and maintaining her family's image is much more important than anything else. As you can see Hellsing is filled with interesting characters that just completely make this a great series to watch despite the somewhat lacking storyline and decade old art. Another thing I found really well suited was the choice of using very English voices (for the dub) that, in my honest opinion, suits it very well. Heck even the crazy regenerating father had his Irish accent as well. I can say for sure this anime is a solid 4. I would not recommend this for small kids (12 and under) because it is very very violent and does have some adult situations (no nudity, but ""other adult situations."") I also would recommend Hellsing ultimate, which sticks closer to the original story and IMHO, is superior to this series, but I definitely do recommend this.",1253404800,,1676,4.743150684931507
2592377,4,B000FVQYQ8,"Hellising is an exciting feast for the eyes and a stunning display of animated action. It is also gratuitously bloody and rather pointless as a story. It has perhaps the most ridiculous plot I've yet seen in any anime. It simply doesn't make sense. Hellsing, apparently a secret organization formed to fight evil creatures, particularly vampires, employs one in its service. There is never any clear understanding of why a vicious brutal sadistic and very powerful vampire like Alucard ( yes... it's Dracula spelled backwards...) binds himself into the service of the Hellsing organization , or more precisely to it's attractive ( human ) female leader Integra. Somehow he was ""Defeated"" by Integra's ancestor Abraham Van Helsing and then ""swore"" service to him and his ancestors. Yet Alucard hardly seems defeated at all.  Anyway, the series consists of Alucard fighting off various attempts to awaken undead monstrosities or to attack the Hellsing organization directly, engaging in battle at Integra's orders.  She gives him a mission and some sort of code word as to how much force or violence he is permitted to use to complete the task. Again, VERY strange, and rather pointless. The only reason I can see why she would want Alucard to limit his attacks is to build up excitement in the series at wonderment over just how powerful he really is. And she does just that. As the series progresses Integra allows Alucard more and more leeway in the use of his powers until a final climatic battle with another very powerful vampire, when she basically orders him give it everything he's got. Ever since Bram Stoker wrote Dracula there has been an attempt to romanticize vampires as reluctant heroes tormented by the limitations of their vile existence. Looking at Alucard's power and ferocity as he fights, one can only wonder what horror would ensue if he ever decided to use his power for evil. This series is well worth watching for the beauty and detail of the animated fight sequences. They are breathtakingly fast and dramatic. The angles at which the perspective carries the viewer can only be done in animation. Just don't expect the story itself to make much sense.

Check out [...] if you are looking at this item its only like $[...] for the box set new.  I don't know what some people are thinking when they post prices.  I'd feel bad if I gave no review so here it is.

If you are a Vampire Hunter D or Black Blood Brothers fan then you will love this series.  Basic premis is that Master Vampire Allucard is the ultimate weapon against ghouls, necromancer and things that go bump in the night.  His powers progress through the series similar to those in Trinity Blood ie he keeps restricitions on his power and only release certain restrictions against worthy opponets.  The story line is a bit choppy at spots but the animation is very interesting.  Certain characters are drawn in different perspectives and Allucards transformations look like something straight out of your nightmares.  I was a bit disappointed when it ended because frankly I wanted more.  But don't let that sway you because any good series should leave you wanting more.  Voice dialog is decent drawing varies on the character but it should keep you interested and for a blood and guts action flick there is enough of a plot line to get you curious.  If anybody has heard of any other Hellsing release please give a shout but to the best of my knowledge this is the only set there is and nothing new is in production.",1212105600,3,1440,4.4541984732824424
2592385,5,B000FVQYQ8,"I have always had a tendency to like stories involving vampires, so picking this one up was a no brainer. What I found was an anime with very good graphics, really great action, mesmerizing characters and a highly addictive storyline. The fact that the anime does not follow the manga closely was not a big issue for me. There are some differences here and there and considerable deviations in terms of the order of presenting events, but I thought that the final product in the anime was very good.

One of the main things I liked about this anime is its ""cool"" main character. Alucard -I still can't believe the translators in the subtitles went with Arucard! Is it that hard to spot the anagram of Dracula? - is a powerful vampire that works for the Hellsing organization, helping solve issues with the undead. He carries a slick weapon and dresses in a very peculiar way. He has a great sense of humor and enjoys facing challenging opponents. On top of that, several of the characters he interacts with, such as Seras Victoria, the police officer turned into a vampire by Alucard, or Integra Hellsing, the measured but ruthless head of the Hellsing organization, provide added interest to the series.

Next, I am going to follow this up with the new set of OVAs released under Hellsing Ultimate, which are supposed to follow the manga more closely and have improved animation. If the original is any indication of the quality of this improved version, I am going to have one hell of a time!",1205107200,2,1494,4.65530303030303

Though some may complain how it doesn't follow the manga all the way through its run when it does seperate it does it well. The animation isn't as flashy as its newer Ultimates counterpart, but it is done well, fits the theme and is consistant, something the newer one would benefit from.

The characters are fleshed out fairly well in this version of the series and the mood, atmosphere, soundtrack, storytelling, are all very well done. You have a tendency to get into the characters of this version than in the newer one which relies more on action to drive it, this is especailly true of Integra and Seras, though Sera could do to be less timid. The english Dub is also very good, and as a whole elevates the series, given its location and subject matter.

I have never read the manga, my first exposure to Hellsing was this series, I have seen the first three volumes of the new one and without a doubt this version is the superior overall series so far, even if it does not follow the manga religiously.

I highly recommend this series.",1188345600,5,1107,4.47029702970297
2592389,5,B000FVQYQ8,"First off, it's worth noting that this anime series is not really about plot subtleties or detailed storytelling. The plot is basic in the extreme (seek and destroy) so if that is what you're looking for, look elsewhere.

Also, this is not a series for children as violence, language, sexuality, and sadism are all to be found in abundance.

This is a series which basically has two major appeals:

1. While the plot is simplistic, the triad of main characters display a wide range of subtle behavioral undertones. The odd moments of caring displayed by Alucard, the background of Integra, and the progression of Seras are all intriguing to watch.

2. The real reason to watch Hellsing is simple. Alucard is 9 kinds of kickass, and his battle scenes are a blast to watch. I seldom enjoy ""overpowered"" characters, but the way Alucard always holds back and toys with his opponents makes the moments when he truly unleashes his powers  really fun.

On the whole, great show, very compelling to watch. I started, and was unable to stop until I watched the whole show in one sitting.

Finally, if you find that you like this show, I'd highly recommend checking out the OVAs, as they feature some really great, higher production value versions of content in the series. (The Luke Valentine battle in particular looks MUCH better in the OVA)",1187913600,3,1334,4.773913043478261

2592397,5,B000FVQYQ8,"Tne biggest problem concerning the ""Hellsing"" video series...its over too quickly. Those of us with a ""Hellsing"" addiction discover all too soon there is no other production, anime nor western animation, that will placate our longing and we are forced to suffer the reality of being unsatisfied over and over again.

Technically, ""Hellsing"" is not much more than a slide show that drips and oozes. The artwork and graphic design is almost minamalist by today's standards. The storyline ranges from the far-fetched to the ridiculous.

With all of the above problems, ""Hellsing"" is still the most compelling and alluring series I have seen to date.

I find myself being mesmerized by the graphics, while simple they glow of raw talent. The idiot storyline is not only tolerable but enjoyable due to the wonderful sophisticated characters and their interactions aided by the marvelous voice acting. Between the art and the voice acting, these inspired characters jump off the screen.

If the reader has gotten as far my post, the basic set-up of the story is more than likely understood: The ""Hellsing Organization"" searches for and destroys vampires (as did Stoker's Van Helsing) with a twist; the ""Hellsing Organization"" uses vampires to kill vampires...and with one very special vampire in particular.

What is interesting is the triangular relationship of the three main characters: Integra Hellsing (the woman in charge and ruler of the Hellsing empire), the vampire Alucard who is also Hellsing's powerful secret weapon, and Seras Victoria the newly created reluctant vampire and devoted follower of Alucard.

The characters are so very interesting (but subtle), they could have written any old plot and I would have watched hungrily. Sometimes it seemed as almost the writer Hirano was out of a fresh idea for a storyline and threw in Sett towards the end. The way the series ended, though, corrected the course with smart scenes that kept its viewers guessing and never underestimated its audience intelligence.

2592401,3,B000FVQYQ8,"I feel as though the style and especially the main character of this story never reached it's full potential in these thirteen episodes. The editorial review sums up the story pretty well. But that's just it, that's the whole story. There aren't any eloborations on the power of Alucard, Walter (that string technique was so friggin' awesome), the ""police girl"" whos the story seemed to center on for at least 4 of the first episodes. The story should have been about Alucard. You, I, and I'm sure the creators know he's the coolest thing about this series, so why spend more than half the series showing the army being trained or being prepered to go into deal with the situation when all they do is just get killed when they go in? Everything about this series could have been thrown away and most of the people who like this series would have still liked it if it just had Alucard shooting guns in it. To tell you the truth I'm one of those people as well. He's so god damn bad ass that most of the time I was watching an episode it was spent waiting for him.

Yes I know the series is called ""Hellsing"" not ""Alucard"" what did you expect? Well for one thing maybe some power from anyone else besides Alucard. It seems as if everything that was done by the organizations troops could have been done by Alucard and saved people lives. Really though, when we're the troops in the series helpfull even once? I sure as hell don't remember. A big powerful organization like Hellsing is run over in one episode by two vampires with a bus load of brainless ghouls, after the kill the one (that's right ONE) guard at the gate and run through it with their bus. Well if you think these highly trained skilled ghoul killing professionals might have a chance especially with the home turf advantage you'd be very wrong.

Alucard is awesome, and the style is fun to watch, and that's what gets this 3 stars, everything else could have been done without.",1137283200,4,1943,4.4858757062146895

2592403,5,B000FVQYQ8,"The premise is fairly simple. The Hellsing organization has been around for about a century bringing down the various undead creatures that pop up across the globe. The organization is headed up by Integra, a woman who so closely resembles a bishounen that even the most trained anime fan's eye will have trouble discerning her exact gender at first glance. She controls Alucard, an uber-powerful vampire who does all the things you'd expect vampires to be able to do and takes out vampires and zombies with ruthless efficiency. Watching these characters interact is a joy; the dialogue and character interaction here is charmingly written and executed. Hellsing has the honor of being the most character-driven horror series ever. Horror almost never focuses completely on characters. Hellsing does the opposite; the characters are given as much detail and background as possible. Therein lies the beauty of Hellsing; it isn't just about blood and guts. The violence is tempered with drama that takes itself seriously enough to validate the entire thing.

The show isn't without its problems, though. After the first episode, which is beautifully animated and brings the unconventional and daring character designs to life, the animation quality gets wildly inconsistent. Characters are frequently off-model and change from scene to scene. I'm not sure why the vampires have gigantic tongues but it winds up looking poorly-drawn and gets fairly distracting at times. After the first 8 episodes or so, the series derails a little and starts developing an ""original"" storyline that has nothing to do with the manga series it's supposed to be based on.

  The synopsis for the anime is about a secret organization in England called ""Hellsing"" who investigates and ""silences"" disturbances of vampirism that stirs just below the radar of the mortal world of London. When a slew of artificially spawned vampires start appearing they call in Alucard.  Alucard is Hellsing's top hunter who is also a vampire himself with strange powers. He can change his form to a hellish multiple eyed dog, to bats, he can even fade away and disappear into nothingness.  He also has different levels of power.  When he takes the restrictions off, he can upgrade his power to meet the challenges of his opponent, power level #1 being the most powerful.  Alucard is a dark character, an elitist who revels in the carnage of ghouls and those he sees unfit to be a vampire.  He looks forward to when he comes across an opponent who challenges his power.

  Despite how dark he is, he's compassionate to his charges, Seras Victoria being one of them.  She is a police officer of the section D-11 division. Alucard is forced to mortally wound her in one of his missions in order to kill a target vampire.  He offers her to ""come with him"" as an alternative to death, which she accepts. She then becomes an agent for Hellsing.  Alucard in return becomes her master.  Through out the series, Alucard is concerned for Seras's wellbeing, guiding her through her new identity as a vampire. He is also honor bound to serve and protect the commanding leader of Hellsing, Sir Integra Wingate Hellsing, (whom is a woman but is given ""Sir"" because I assume she has been dubbed a knight). Alucard rescues her when she was a child from her uncle who planned to murder her in order to gain leadership of the Hellsing organization. In the last episode, even though it's not said, there are hints, if you are a vampire enthusiast, and if you can figure it out, it is revealed who Alucard really is.",1134172800,,2122,4.658602150537634

The repeated theme for Hellsing is very basic: the cocky jerk gets put in his place.  That's about it.  In just about every episode there is a villian (at least one) whose character is developed as an arrogant, selfish, evil pig.  Then, enter Alucard (Arucard) to educate the cocky jerk on the insignifigance of his existance. (most often by ending it)  Simple, but brilliant!  The music is awesome.  The animation is very dark and appropriately gorey.  In my opinion, this series is superior to every single vampire anime I have seen.

With the planning of the series being completely redone and staying true to the manga, I would not buy this series unless you really can't wait. This one has a lot of plot weaknesses.

This is a dark anime with great dark humor the quality of sound is overwhelming it realy makes you feel alive. The animation isn't the best but is well Perfect in this setting. The charictorization is also not the best but it doesnt need to be in this anime.

Una de esas tantas (que lamentablemente me llegaron tarde ya que hace bastante que se estreno)es HELLSING, titulo que hace alusion al conocidisimo cazador de monstruos Von Helsing, responsable de la muerte del Blad Tepes, alias, Conde Dracula.

La primera impresion que tube de la serie al introducir el DVD (que viene en un packaging IMPECABLE, lleno de ilustraciones originales de sobervia calidad) es que estaba viendo una obra excepcional, con una grafica impecable y con una trama que atrapa desde el 1er capitulo.

La serie en si, a pesar de contar con tan solo media temporada japonesa (12 caps) es excepcional. Cuenta la historia de la ultima heredera de la familia HELLSING (no Helsing, que por algun motivo de derechos de autor o por agregarle un poco de chapa se le sumo una L, haciendo un paralelismo con la palabra HELL = Infierno en Ingles) que comanda un grupo militar de ""caballeros"" destinados a destruir a los vampiros y demas criaturas infernales que pululan por Londres, Inglaterra, locacion elegida para el desarrollo de la trama.

Ahora, apsemos a los puntos fuertes: es una serie de VAMPIROS, DEMONIOS Y DEMAS BICHOS DEL INFRAMUNDO, lo cual deja un abanico de posibilidades infinito, y en este caso, lo supieron usar. La hambientacion es BIEN oscura y la direccion es muy buena, haciendonos acordar al estilo de nuestro buen amigo Timmy Burton...

lo que falta es que la vean...

I collect anime movies and series since 1990 and, in my humble opinion, Hellsing is the most original, intriguing and well-plotted anime series to have been released in twenty years. Next generation graphic style and a powerful storyline, with in-deep development of characters and great soundtrack, Hellsing it's, simply put, a masterpiece. Created by the increasingly famous GONZO Studios, Hellsing is hard and unforgiving. Among the dark war between humans and vampires, the even darker rivalry between the Royal Protestant Knights of Hellsing and the Roman Catholic Iscariote Section 13 and the terrible threats of the Millennium, the viewer is frightened by a simple fact: it's through the eyes of the Monster outside (Alucard The Vampire) that we come face to face with the real Monster, the one inside us. The hunters of monsters should be aware not to look too deeply into the Abyss....because the Abyss looks at them too. Nietzche at his best. If you are an anime fan, you simply have to see it. If you aren't, see it nonetheless. You'll be not disappointed.",1117324800,,1105,5.076923076923077

Hellsing, is the name of a secret organization based in a modern-day England. Hellsing has religous ties and aims to eliminate creatures in the land. Fighting a war against vampires and demons for many decades without the general public's knowledge. Lead by Integra Hellsing, a woman of conviction and determination has amassed an army of soldiers which look a lot like a (S.W.A.T.) team, they use special silver-laced ammunitions and blessed bullets to kill vamperic and zombie-like creatures that feed on innocent people. Hellsing soldiers sometimes get over-whelmed and murdered by creatures, but as a last resort they can rely on their own vampire! Hellsing has a powerful vampire named, Alucard, who is the star of the show! He is sadistic, arrogant, creepy, and fighting on the side of good! Fighting evil with evil! Alucard is the best anti-hero to come in a long time. I love it when he talks trash to his enemies, then blasts them with his giant gun or he cuts them up with his super-strength! He is arrogant and pratically fearless and he has an attractive servant named Victoria who is loyal and a good warrior herself! Alucard carries a mysterious past which little of is revealed and a secret that will shock you. The action is intense with bloody fights that include; severed limbs, decapitations, and a bit of cannibalism. The story is mysterious and is told in an excellent pace filled with good character developement and interactions. The artwork and animation is fantastic everything looks great fluid animation. The anime has dark noir over-tones, but everything could be seen good even with all the darkness and shade they used! The voice-acting is excellent and you'll notice that the english language has real british accents. If you like vampire anime or enjoyed, Vampire Hunter D, you will love Hellsing! I loved every single episode! It's a MUST own anime! And hope they bring us more Hellsing!",1115596800,3,1962,4.963525835866261
2592417,4,B000FVQYQ8,One of the things I love about Hellsing is the purity of Arucard's evil. He isn't a romantic vampire as one finds in other series. The anime is imaginative. A resfreshing spin on vampires.,1115510400,,188,4.5588235294117645
2592418,5,B000FVQYQ8,"The Hellsing anime is by far, my favorite anime. In Hellsing you follow the story of a God-like vampire named Alucard and his master, Integra Wingates Hellsing of the Hellsing organization that gets rid of ghouls and vampires. I absolutelty love this anime.. Its so cool and its fun to watch. Its a good anime to sit down at night at watch with a few friends or even by yourself~! Not only do you get to look at the hawt vampire Alucard all the time, (lol XD) but you get to watch a really neat story unfold with each episode. I reccomend this anime to anyone who loves a good vampire anime.

  Although this anime does end quite well, there are a few things that suggest that there was, in fact, supposed to be a second season. But from what I heard, the Japanese public didn't like the Hellsing anime too much and the ratings weren't very good so they decided to not do the second season. So a couple of things are left unsaid. All-in-all, its a great anime. However.. I would have to say that this anime is very mature. Having said that, I would have to rate this anime for 14 year olds and up. *nod nod*

  After the dvd came in the mail, I couldn't stop watching! I love this anime. Its really interesting and entertaining to watch. Many people get confused with the movie Van Hellsing and the Hellsing anime, but the two are QUITE DIFFERENT! different story line and everything.. so don't get those two mixed up. ^^; Once again, I reccomend this anime for anyone who is anyone that loves a vampire story. So remember, Alucard is hawt, this is a great anime, and it is a MUST-SEE!

2592419,5,B000FVQYQ8,"Luckily, word has it another season is under works! Watching this will make you want to buy the manga series all in one wack.

Here we have another Japan-made Vampire named Alucard; not the slinky biseinen from Castlevania, but he's deffinately awesome. He has 3 character designs, though he seems to fit in the SLAYERS' description of a monster; no real physical body, can't be destroyed. That black eye-bally goo he turns into must be his true form because he can shed his body like a snake skin. He enjoys violence....big suprise there.

Integral Hellsing looks & dresses like an attractive man, but has the coldhearted, loud, bossy unrelentig personality of a token female CEO. Sorry bishie-fans, Integral's a lady, a crossdresser. But we can forgive her cuz she oozes girl-power. Even though Alucard could have just killed her as a child & freed himself from the Hellsings, he analized her personality & willingly chose to serve under her. She's a very confused girl who doesn't know what she really wants in life & feels very alone, but she's learned not to take crap from others.

Next we have Ceras Victoria. A girl Alucard saved by giving his blood. She looks like a newspaper boy with a D-cup & a mini skirt, & she carries a big big gun. Even though there's no real romantic relation between Alucard & Integral, Ceras seems to be a bit jealous of his masters' master.

Walter is awesome! He's like a Ninja Alfred! (Batman) & there's a bunch of bad guys but none last longer than 3 episodes.",1115078400,2,1500,4.670454545454546

2592421,5,B000FVQYQ8,"Hellsing is perhaps the best anime I've seen since Cowboy Bebop. It has action, mysterious characters, and a soundtrack that can compete with Cowboy Bebop. The main theme is simple enough. The Hellsing Family of Great Britian has guarded the Royal Family for hundreds of years from vampires and ghouls and other supernatural creatures. The family is currently head by Sir Integra Hellsing (a woman, I swear) who has the ultimate trump card: a vampire of her own. She ressurected the vampire Alucard, who serves her and hunts vampires for Hellsing. At the start of the series, Alucard rescues a young police girl named Seras, and makes her a vampire in his service. Through the course of the series they discover more and more about a plot by another organization that is creating ""artificial"" vampires. The series ends with Alucard fighting the strongest of them, Incognito (yes, the name is funny.)

What really makes the series is Alucard, who it is suggested is Dracula. He takes great pride in what he is, and finds the freak vampires to be disgusting abominations. Through the show, the viewer gets the impression that Alucard is bored. He spends his time trying to find a worth opponent that he can go all out against. He finds this in the form of Father Anderson, a Paladin working for a secret Vatican organization, and Incognito. But still, one feels sorry for the vampire because he is so alone. He had wiped out most of his race and can find no enjoyment in missions anymore.

Seras is a less likeable character at the start though. She has what I call ""Anne Rice Vampire Syndrome"" where she feels so conflicted about drinking blood and leaving her home. She does get over it, but very late in the series. The other characters are much more impressive like Integra, Anderson, and Walter, Integra's retainer. He seems like a nice old guy, but he's as ruthless as Alucard.

I really enjoyed Hellsing, but apparently Japan did not, since it was never that popular. It felt to me like the series was expected to continue, since there are so many plot holes left at the end. The ending notes seemed really tacked on, and there is so much that suggests a second season was intended. I really wish that it was, since the show could have only gotten better. The manga answers many questions, but in a way that seems cheap. But this is good DVD reguardless. The dubbing is well done, and the subtitles are accurate. The price is worth it, and if you get really into it, check out the manga.",1113091200,8,2492,4.64625850340136

(for lack of a better word at this moment) The grim and wicked smile he has at all times just makes him the badest anime character period. Put him up against any character you want, he will beat him up.

The whole series is delightfuly well balanced, from the opening scene to the over the top action-siting at the edge of your seat-biting your nails off ending; you will just love this anime.

2592426,2,B000FVQYQ8,"I expected to see something good and exciting but up to now this is probably the worst manga that I have seen. Having seen the first 2 volumes I can only detect the negative aspects of the series.

 1. No character development and depth at all. At the first 2 volumes we know almost nothing about Arukard, some minor and insignificant details about the female character and in general there can be no attachment to the characters at all. I still don't understand who is the main character of the series. Ash from the pokemon has more personality than the vampire in this movie!!! He He!!

 2. Back to the pointless dialogues that many anime have. The characters talk and talk without really saying anything. They are trying my patience.

 3. What about the story? Well there is a pattern where there are some people who create artificial vampires and the Hellsing org. hunts them. Personally, I believe the storyline sucked, and in no way I would buy the rest of the volumes.

I don't understand how people give this series a good review. Either they are at the age of 10-13 or I don't know what. Anime like Akira, Trigun, Berserk, robotech, escalflowe, record of lobos, evangelion, bewpop are excellent.

 Well Hellsing compared to the above is 0!! I was very dissapointed. Even if in the next volumes the story gets better the animation is still not the best out there with no atmosphere and no character direction.",1107820800,6,1417,4.658634538152611

A beautiful woman who has learned self control (maybe a bit too much) in order to control her organization, which she inherited from her late father when she was 13 years old.  Her nature is quick to anger, but her control is obvious.  The Hellsing Organization battles vampires, ghouls, and freaks (manmade vampires).  Their motto:  ""In the Name of God, impure souls of the living dead shall be banished into eternal damnation. Amen."" Along with inheriting the organization, Sir Integra also inherited a vampire - Alucard.  Alucard made a pact (what that includes is never made clear) with the Hellsing family long ago to submit to levels of control that can only be removed under certain conditions.  Alucard is a totally insane immortal creature.  He loves nothing more than a good battle, but he's often disappointed by his opponents.  Alucard is often condescending to Sir Integra (which helps her from getting too arrogant), but at other times his admiration and respect are obvious.  Sir Integra is his master.  During a battle with a vampire - Alucard meets police girl Seras Victoria.  He has to shoot thru Seras to get to vampire.  Alucard offers her the choice of death or ""coming over"".  Seras Victoria chooses to become a vampire.  Sir Integra is not pleased.  After a rocky start Sir Integra discovers that Seras common sense and sense of honor could be an asset to the Hellsing Organization.

2592432,4,B000FVQYQ8,"I've been afraid of vampires movies all my life and finally my guy got me to watch this series. I was scaried as hell at first but it wasn't like most vampire series. There were no good vampires, no 'interview with a vampire' pansy vampires, no stakes, no cross, and no vampires dying cause of daylight.

Alcard was bordering on the psychic side. He has a female(took me a bit to figure out her gender)master who he doesn't seem to care if she dies or not. She does die by the way. I was a bit upset about that, I thought she was the queen of B****s and was my personal favorite character in the story. The police girl turned vampire annoyed me a bit with her not accepting what she ASKed to be turned into. She was better later though. The speed of the story didn't bother me that much, the way they started and ended the story did. The story just jumps in with no explaination of what is going on or why. I expected more to the ending then there was. I also, expect more character background on Alcarad and his master and how things came to be. The freak chips' background was stetchy as well.

I've went on to read manga now (it has more to the story). The anime was refreshing if you're tired of normal vampire stories but if you can stomache more gore read the manga after you're done.

2592433,3,B000FVQYQ8,"Fortunately, the series does little to hide it. While the depth of the characters and a strong central plot is sorely lacking, the show still manages to be intriguing nonetheless. The dark art style created a very nice, grim (how's that for an oxymoron) atmosphere, and considering the nature of the show, (revolving around the killing of ""ghouls"" and vampires) it certainly fit the bill. The music was also well composed and helped add to the mood. The redeeming factor of the show by far and away, however, has to be the main ""protagonist,"" Arucard.

  The character design for Arucard is really something to marvel at. It's a memorable one. Arucard plays his role as a vampire perfectly, looking only to pick fights with those who can come close to rivaling his power. However, for reasons unexplained even at the end of the series, Arucard is controlled by (ironically enough) a vampire and ghoul hunting organization known as Hellsing. Although the series it titled Hellsing, most of it (or at least what the viewer will care about) revolves around Arucard. The roles of the other characters, however, are seriously void. Seras Victoria, another ""central"" character to the story was sorely underdeveloped. She is transformed into a vampire during the very first episode, and at fist, the series showed her struggling to accept her newfound role. By the end of the series, nothing had really changed about her except her ability level and position within the Hellsing organization.

  The fight scenes are fleeting and aren't really all that fantastic. I'm not someone who typically enjoys super long fight scenes, but 1-2 minute fight sequences, including some with no resolution, aren't what I'm expecting, especially with a show that could have offered so much more. Perhaps it was time constraints, perhaps it was budget concerns, but Hellsing really didn't deliver everything it could have. The show was often disjointed and felt rushed at times.

  For those looking for a dark, quick fix of anime, much like a popcorn movie, Hellsing will certainly deliver. If you are looking for top notch anime and go in with high expectations, then Hellsing will probably disappoint you. That being said, it is certainly not a bad watch and offers decent entertainment value. However, if you have not seen at least a couple of episodes of the show,I would suggest holding off on an impulse purchase. In my humble opinion, Hellsing was good but not great, and had the potential to be something much more special.",1100217600,4,2509,4.968973747016706
2592434,5,B000FVQYQ8,"This series is will be a clasic.  Based off the clasic Japanese Manga (Japanese Comic Books). However, is has absolutly nothing to do with that cheesy Hollywood movie ""Van Hellsing.""  The story line follows a vampire by the name of Allucard as he hunts down kills various evolved forms of vampires.  He serves Sir Integra, head of the Hellsing Orginazation.  Also joining Allucard is the lovly Victoria, or Police Girl as her master Allucard calls her.  Together they used specially designed weapons used to hunt these evolved vampires and various other undead courpes.  Though the MANGA is much more indepth than this animated series, the series is still a work of art.  The animation and characters devoped by GONZO DIGIMATION STUDIO (Blue Submarine #6, Vandread, Last Exile, Kiddy Grade, ECT...) the series definatly lives up to fans expecations of this particalar studio, which is arguably the best anime studio out there.  The story is clear however a little short.  I recomend this series to any fan of the Vampire Hunter D movies or anyone that has convinced him / herself that they are truly immortal vampires.

2592435,4,B000FVQYQ8,"I'm an avid fan of anime and love all aspects of every genre, whether it be a romantic comedy or action thriller, but I was looking for something darker and that's when I stumbled upon ""Hellsing"". Based on so many recommendations I bought the Japanese import, which I actually like more than the one advertised here for the entire series (episodes 1-13) are included in two discs, packaged within a light gatefold box, therefore much more compact.

Although I enjoy ""Hellsing"" for what it is and laugh with shameless mirth at the pure delight Alucard gets when battling a true vampire, I was hoping for something more atmospheric. I basically wanted something moodier; more mysterious. Something sinister to give me nightmares at night. This, however, did not do the trick, but neither was it supposed to, I assume, so that's my own personal gripe, I guess. This unfortunately won't give you shivers nor chills down your spine but there are some fine points I must mention about this anime. For one I loved the Gothic backdrops (blood red skies and intensely glowing moons, for instance). Also, I instantly became curious as to why the vampire Alucard was serving the human Sir Integra - head of the Hellsing organization, and found myself intrigued with the growth of Seras Victoria - known as kitty before her transformation, while she was still a feeble, timid police girl, so the character's in general and their development throughout the series is fascinating to say the very least. As for the plot, their best weapon against the legions of evil is the powerful Alucard, equipped with special ""blessed"" bullets capable of disintegrating unholy creatures, as well as ghouls (undead slaves of the vampire - corpses that move under their control). With his and even Victoria's help, the loyal troops of Hellsing fight to protect mortals from secret wars brewing in the wicked night.

2592436,5,B000FVQYQ8,"No, this is not Big O, this is Hellsing.  The idea is that Hellsing is a English organization, with permission of the Crown, to search and kill vampires.  You would think this was hard enough but as the story unfolds we find that fake undead are being made.  There is a chip, which, when inserted into the neck makes a human a vampire.  This allows the problem of vampires, the fake ones known as freaks, to spread like wild fire.  Neither the government nor the Pope in Rome is pleased with this (there seems to be a lot of infighting) and none of them are happy with the fact that Hellsing uses vampires within its own military units.

There is lots of fighting, gore, bad language, almost-sexual scenes and lots of links to other myths and even suggestions that some of the great vampires are still alive and well.  Arucard, the rogue vampire working for Hellsing, is himself a powerful creature.  Hints about who he is pepper the show, but the big give away is in the last episode.

Lots of good artwork, a great soundtrack (I might end up getting the music CDs) and the selection of the English voice actors is perfect.  The manga is also available (and I might get that too!)

If you enjoy bloody anime, this series is for you. It's not nearly as gruesome as many out there but does have more blood and violence than any of the stuff shown on Cartoon Network today. If you like vampire anime, then this series is also for you; it's a neat take and breath of fresh air in a genre well-exercised in Japan.
The animation itself is done really well in terms of visual quality, with a blend of CG and hand-drawn cel work; however, it is somewhat more static in nature than much contemporary anime, comparable to that done for the Record of Lodoss War series.
The audio, though presented only in stereo sound, features a soundtrack you'll want to hunt down like a freak after fresh blood. Surprisingly, the english dubbing is quite good, featuring British-accented voice actors far superior to the average anime dub.
Hellsing is an excellent addition to any anime fan's library and a must-watch for vampire lovers everywhere.",1081728000,4,1705,5.049645390070922

I highly recommend this series that has not only a great plot, but wonderful voiceovers, colorful characters and kick ass fight sequences. If you want your anime collection to be complete or you are just starting to get into anime I cannot recommend anything above this.

Hellsing takes up a standard setting, the dark underbelly of a major city, the main character is Alcuard (Probably the MOST COMMON VAMPIRE NAME EVER!) who works for the Hellsing orginization as a vampire hunter, boy oh boy, a vampire hunting vampires!? Don't get me wrong, I like the series, if you love action or seeing Zombie cannon fodder being blown away by some chick who's gun\breats keep getting bigger in every other scene you are going to fall in love with this series, there is story devolopment and character devolopment, and over all I sugguest this to any horror action fan, it is also easy to get into if you are just now getting into anime, the reason for this is because it is so familiar, by now every one knows about violent zombie\vampire hunt movies, and if that is your thing, pick it up. If action and violent zombie killing is not your thing, you MAY want to pass this one over.",1080864000,,932,4.488235294117647

Hellsing revolves around a vampire named Alucard and its says little about his past. Thats were the baffling twist comes in. At the end of the saga there is a twist. There is  a man by hellsing who he is i don't know. All i know is that this baffled me. So if your into character plots and such stuff. Hellsing is not for you !!!!!!",1080777600,,546,4.2
2592445,3,B000FVQYQ8,"I expected Hellsing to be something like a dark gothic story with a human who controls a vampire.  The theme of vampire hunting vampires have been used thousands of times.  Hellsing surprised me in many ways.  There was a very fresh feeling to the anime.  The jazzy music created a mood that I never expected to feel.  The story was not dark as I anticipated.  Hellsing managed to created an atmosphere that broke away from the overused cliche of vampires hunting vampires.  Alucard was one of the most coolest characters in anime.  Whenever you saw him you knew something was going to happen.  He DEFINED Hellsing.  HE IS HELLSING..... which leads me to a sad point.  It really doesn't matter where or when this happened.  Many characters were pointless (especially one of the MAIN CHARACTERS, Ceras Victoria)  Other characters were also very abstract.  Hellsing would have remained almost the same without them (maybe even better)  The reason some of the characters were so weak as characters in the story is that they served little purpose than to play their role.  Their motives, wants, past were either just barely touched on or never even mentioned.  Even Alucard could have used some background. (but then again he's like D, no need for a past when your one of the coolest characters ever)
 As Far as episodes go, they are excecuted pretty well.  Most of the episodes up to seven were GREAT, but the finale was not done too well.  (I especially hated Incognito's character design.... It was very.... unHellsingish)",1078963200,2,1521,4.844357976653696
2592446,2,B000FVQYQ8,"After being subjected to the hype of my fellow anime-lovers about this series, I really expected a more interesting story. While I thought the animation was done passably well, artwork can only hold a film so far...the story and character development really needs to pick up the slack at some point. In this case, I lost interest after the second episode as it was fairly clear that the story wasn't moving at a pace comparable to it's simplicity; it simply wasn't complex enough to struggle along so cryptically. While I agree Alucard was an interesting character, his overthetop attitude mostly made him annoying (I'd like to see Vampire Hunter D tear him a new one, quite frankly) and the other characters were cardboard cutouts at best. Sera, who's struggle with her budding vampirism should have made a good center for this story, but her petulence and unwillingness to give in to the hunger that would make her a valuable asset to Hellsing simply makes her unnecessary to the series.
In all, I was enormously disappointed...it really seemed that this idea could have had real depth; instead, it's creaters fell into a common Hollywood style trap: flash over substance.",1076025600,4,1174,4.934343434343434
2592447,5,B000FVQYQ8,"Hellsing is an anime that should be looked at from a different perspective then a few other animes. The story in Hellsing isn't exactly in-depth, but I don't think it was ever intended to be deep. What you get with Hellsing is a great action anime, with awesome fight scenes, decent dialogue and dubbing (ten times better then 90% of the other dubbed anime in America) and one of the coolest anti-heroes ever to be created. Grooving guitar licks and even the hint of jazz makes the soundtrack perfect for the anime, and the art style, although a little static, fits the series well. Although the box may say 16 and up, I believe it should really be 18 and up, with plots containing snuff films, violence against women and torture all being used, especially early in the series. In some episodes the language gets downright foul, but it still fits the series. Overall, if you are looking for a great action anime, that has a dark sense of humor and an excellent soundtrack, then pick up Hellsing. And if you just plain love vampires, then you should already own this thing.",1075334400,3,1072,4.588541666666667
2592448,5,B000FVQYQ8,"This is simply the best anime I have seen.  It is not silly or goofy like a lot of anime and it doesn't have a host of farout stuff like robots as big as cities, guys that turn into girls, or stupid jokes.  It is more down to earth.  Basically the story line is as follows.  The Hellsing organization is kind of like a pest control company except that their pest are vampires and other undead.  Their top exterminator is Alucard.  He is one powerful vampire with all manner of abilities.  in the first episode Alucard converts a policer officer name Victoria Ceras into a vampire and from then on it's a constant showdown between Hellsing and the rest of the vampires.  Love the way the picture looks, cool voice actors, interesting characters.  The only short commings were the fact that the series is only 13 episodes which in return reflects on the lack of depth in the story. Besides that it is a great anime especially when you compare it to others. There was nothing typical about this anime in my opinion which is why I rate it 5 stars.  If you like anime then you should love this series",1075075200,,1095,4.402985074626866
2592449,4,B000FVQYQ8,"Welcome to the Hellsing Organization; an army dedicated to keep the country safe from the undead.  The group fights against vampires and ghouls of all sorts in the dark of night.  Their ultimate weapon is a hunter that is a vampire himself, Alucard; an unstoppable figure that can face just about any sort of evil that the darkness has to offer him.  Vampires and ghouls are not safe with this elite team of hunters and soldiers lurking about.
This collection of ""Hellsing"" is a set of four DVDs that reveal this exciting and bloody journey--a quest against the undead and all of their defects and imperfections.  Join Alucard; a vampire who has dedicated his life to serving his master, Sir Integra, and leads to fight against the sleepless dead.  You'll also follow the journey of Hellsing newcomer, Seras Victoria, who was once a police officer until turned vampire.  The Organization is determined to defend humanity against all creatures of the night and vow to face any deadly foe in their way.  These four volumes tell the story of ultimate darkness and evil--and how a certain group is possibly the only weapon against it.
I found ""Hellsing"" to be a complete joy to watch.  While being very stylish and flashy, the series still has structure and depth to it.  The characters are extremely fascinating in their own unique ways.  Alucard has become one of my new favorite anime characters, as he's one not to mess around with!  The series is short, with only having a total of 13 episodes.  While this is a bit of a downside, it also works in a positive way as it won't take much of your time to get through it all.  The first three discs run at about 75 minutes each and the fourth one runs at about 95 minutes total.
As I indicated in the reviews for the individual volumes, this is nothing young children should watch.  This eerie and sinister anime series is extremely adult and offers what can be considered sometimes frightening and horrific moments.  The series contains graphic violence, more than a fair amount of blood and gore, strong language, adult content, and dark and disturbing themes and imagery.  The series gives you a feel of the ""Spawn"" series in some ways, but still offers a fresh and ideal concept.
""Hellsing"" is recommended for any fan of anime, as well as any fan of ghouls and vampires.  The series is exciting and thrilling as well as completely mesmerizing.  These 13 episodes give you a wildly trip into the darkness.  Are you ready to do battle against the undead?  Do you think you can follow Alucard, or will you be left behind?  The decision is yours, and it has always been yours as he would tell you himself...",1074816000,9,2653,4.650214592274678

2592453,5,B000FVQYQ8,"I'd never actually heard of Hellsing before, until my friend bought the first DVD out of impulse based on something she'd read on the internet.  She leant me the first two and at first I was sceptical - vampires and Christianity don't really appeal to me much - but after watching only the first episode I was totally hooked!  Whatever you read, whatever your original thoughts based on the cover art, the blurb or whatever, you really have to see it for yourself to make your own opinion.
The main character Alucard is one bad-ass vampire; arrogant as all hell, but he's got the skills to back it up: he's never let a target escape.  It's impossible not to love him.
The story - set in modern day London - revolves around the Hellsing organisation, a secret society dedicated to freeing Britain of all Impure Souls.  It is led by Integra Hellsing (sound familiar?  She's the decendant of Dracula's Dr Abraham Van Helsing) a strong woman who is dedicated to eliminating Undead of any kind.  So why is a vampire her secret weapon?  (that's just one thing you'll have to work out for yourself from watching)
With the addition of Seras Victoria, a timid police officer turned vampire when Alucard has to shoot through her lungs to eliminate a target, the story kicks off.
Throughout the series the Hellsing Organisation has to deal with ghouls and a new type of man-made breed of vampire.  That's not to mention interference from the Iscariot Organisation, a Catholic based organisation also dedicated to the elimination of vampires (Hellsing is Protestant, hence the enmity between the two)
Of course, there's much worse to come.  In Hellsing when they say 'bad guy' they mean REALLY bad guy.
The series doesn't have a down moment.  It's all fantastic!  There's great action, characters you either love or love to hate and a brilliant soundtrack on par with Cowboy Bebop.  The complete collection is a must have because it's so easy to watch the whole series at once, again and again (believe me, I do all the time ^^)
You need to watch it all more than once, because there's so much more to it than it originally seems.  Anyone who says it's all action and no plot has really only taken in less than half the show.
And so, to sum myself up in a few words: Hellsing is one of the greatest anime to date.  A must see for any anime fan and a must have!  Trust me, you won't regret watching it.",1071878400,10,2389,4.562060889929742
2592454,5,B000FVQYQ8,"Take Trigun's action, Cowboy Bebop's soundtrack, Biohunter's blood/gore. Mix well, and whaddaya' get? Hellsing of course! Hellsing is very very very bloody (but I'm assuming you all ready know that), definatley not an anime for the kiddies. I found it moderately entertaining hearing the Brittish vampires/humans voice actor's accents. They keep saying ""Fok"" as a cuss word, whats ""Fok"" mean? *chuckle* And yes, it does have cussing with flying colors, even the big three. Alucard, the main character (which is Dracula spelled backwards), is a billion times as bad (the good kind of bad) as Vash, Spike, Inuyasha, etc. He has brains, brawn, and really cool vampire powers. Watching these ephisodes would be really cool if you just smoked a couple joints, or did some acid (either one should be just fine). In conclusion...

The picture is a little disappointing and there seems to be a few audio pops when subtitles are turned on.  Also, the extras suck, so don't think you're getting anything special.  BUT, it is still a really good package overall.
I really enjoyed the series, even though I am not an avid anime watcher.  There have been only a few anime series that I have actually finished watching mainly because it's so expensive to buy DVD's of every other three episodes.  This series is fast paced, even though a little confusing at times for me (probably missed something the first time around).

2592458,3,B000FVQYQ8,"The good:
I'm usually no fan of vampire stories, because they often turn corny. This does not apply to Hellsing, though. When I watched the first episode my jaw simply dropped, because I had never (and still haven't) seen anything that could beat the style and the atmosphere it mustered.
The setting takes us to modern England where a secret institution ""Hellsing"" exists in order to protect the living from the undead (and keep them unaware about it). The institution is run by Integra Hellsing, who is pictured as a cold, distant and extremely strong-willed lady. Although the intstitution eliminates vampires, it doesn't prevent them from having one (later two) in their service. The vampire lord Alucard is in fact the most potent weapon the institution has at its disposal...
It's apparent that not only a lot of work, but also a lot of genius has been invested in creating the characters - especially Alucard whose personality seems to be a delicate blend of Japanese samurai, English gentleman and unpredictable madman. Usually when the moviemakers try to make a character ultracool, they usually only end up with something ultra-annoying - but not this time. Alucard is the very definition of cool, and there's nothing anyone can do about it. :-)
The style of this series is nothing shot of awesome. The drawings, the music, the characters, the timing - everything is set up perfectly to deliver a haunting atmosphere that just won't let you out of its grip...
The bad:
Unfortunately the series suffers from a few flaws, of which at least two of them are critical.
The first (and worst) flaw is that there is ""too much story"" crammed into a mere 13 episodes of 22-24 min. each. Were supposed to take part of the Alucard - Anderson duel, the FREAK-chip conspiracy, the rise and fall of the evil Incognito and then some, while at the same time getting to know the characters, and watch their development... The end result is that none of these things are done with anything that would even resemble the excellence of the other parts. In fact I would have to say that the story becomes severely incoherent about half-way through. The worst thing is probably that the ""FREAK-chip plot"" is suddenly just dropped in favour of the ""Incognito plot"". It is too bad that an otherwise extremely professional series would suffer from such an amateurish mistake.
The second critical flaw is Celes Victoria. Not because of what she is - she is in fact a great charachter, probably the most likeable in the entire Hellsing institute. The problem is that she is a character that's just begging for development that never happens, because the series ends so soon. Despite the fact that she gets lots and lots of screen time, she never really seems to accomplish anything important. You keep waiting and waiting for a breakthrough in her character, and then... the series ends. A true anticlimax that is incredibly annoying. In the end it feels like a waste of an extremely nice and promising character. :-(
Other flaws that also deserve brief mention is the fact that some parts seem to display a poor understanding of British culture. (The UK is a protestant nation in sharp opposition to anything catholic etc.) This brings us to the part that religion as a whole has been drawn down to the level of superstition. In order to go any deeper there would have to be a counterweight against fanatic priests, baptised knives and blessed silver bullets. Also as the story unfolds, the focus will move more and more towards action and gore, and although this isn't poorly done, the series as a whole simply can't deliver on the expectations that are created by the first episodes.
I still recommend that you at least watch the first episodes (you can get them separately). They're worth it for style alone.",1069027200,3,3793,4.810107197549771
2592459,3,B000FVQYQ8,What was there was good.  The voice acting.  The animation.  The soundtrack.  The dialouge.  But it could have been so much more.  I think a large part of that is that they stopped after so few episodes (although I heard there might be a sequel).  Why is Alucard bound to the Hellsing family.  Why does he seem to care so much for Hellsing (it seems like it's more than just her name).  Does Victoria ever learn to deal with her Vamprie-ness.  Like that Sett worshiping dude wanted to know: what *is* Alucard?  It'd watch it again though; it didn't suck.,1068595200,2,554,4.44

2592462,2,B000FVQYQ8,"But it was somewhat entertaining nonetheless.  Here's the basic premise of the movie:  take Vampire Hunter D, a movie based on a supremely powerful character that has more power on reserve to tap into than the entire national power grid, build the plot to a climatic conclusion where this powerful character duels another supremely powerful character, ala Vampire Hunter D, and finally, when you think the good guy is over and done with, have him tap into his ""lineage""...-- in the style of Vampire Hunter D.  And to top it all off, you end on the same theme; the main character is related to the one and only original, except as in Vampire Hunter D, the main character IS the original; namely, Dracula himself.  Infact, the movie ends on such a cheezy historical reference.  You see the Incognito character IMPALED on a large pike.  This is in reference to the Turkish prince, Vlad the Impaler, who is famous for inspiring the true to life legend of Dracula by impaling all his victims on large pikes.  Hell, even Alucard is backward for Dracula.
