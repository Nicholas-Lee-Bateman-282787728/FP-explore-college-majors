8383301,4,B002WNUVKW,"This work is reasonably intelligent and interesting. Acting by most of the players is above average to impressive. The speed of sequences usually move at ""quick-time"",or,if you prefer,at a typical US pace,with only a couple of places that it appeared the director wasn't exactly sure what he was doing there for so long,but nothing to write home about as this happens in most movies. The other reviewers are sure to tell the storyline: twin orphans separated pre-teen,one forced into a gang while the other becomes a cop and they spend nearly twenty years looking for each other. To tell more would be a spoiler. There's lots of brutality,blood,thumping on a woman,woman thumping back,remorseless pre-teen kids proficent in the use of sharp objects longer than their own arms,more violence and blood and beatings,back-stabbing gang bosses,etc. In short,a movie that is typicaly Korean. Not for the kiddies but good enough for the dudes and some of their more rowdy girlfriends and tolerent wives.",1301702400,2,996,5.192546583850931
