1882075,5,B000099T3R,"At first I was surprised to see the ""Critters"" films on DVD. Of course, then I remembered that the company was New Line, a company that does a stellar job on all of its DVD releases, from the ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" collection to the current ""The Lord of the Rings"" DVDs. Every one made is well done, unlike several companies that put out mediocre crap for movies they don't appreciate. With this knowledge, I eagerly purchased ""Critters 2.""
For those uninitiated (in which case, you should probably see the first movie before getting the second,) Krites (Critters) are little hairball monsters with giant mouths of teeth and little projectile's that launch poison into their victims. Of all the movies following ""Gremlins,"" these are probably the best.
In the first ""Critters,"" an alien species known as the Krites came to Earth to feed and terrorized the Brown family until being destroyed by bounty hunters.
2 years after the events of the original movie, the bounty hunters (now with Charlie as a companion) are called back to Earth. Apparently, their mission of exterminating the Krites has not been fulfilled. The Krites of the first movie had lain eggs in the Brown farm, now abandoned, and a teenage punk has discovered them. Locked in a cold barn for 2 years rendered them unhatchable, but by being pulled out to be sold as Easter Eggs, they're into warmer territory.
At the same time, Bradley Brown, the kid from the first movie, is returning to Grover's Bend for the first time since the incident to stay with his grandmother for Easter. The town starts talking about his return, when all of a sudden, the Krites start hatching and turning the town into dinner.
Of the four ""Critters"" movies, ""Critters 2"" is probably the best. The monsters of the last film came in two sizes: juvenile and gigantic. No critter has gotten as big as the one from that movie, but in this film we get little baby ones, as well as nice, plump, adult ones that make the most of their attack on Grover's Bend.
Of course, there are flaws, but that's expected from a B-movie. Charlie's acting kinda dies at times. And the fact that the Krites can chase after a truck so well, but have trouble catching up with a little girl on her bicycle is a little unbelievable. The ""Critterbusters"" joke. Also, why could Ug transform his clothing?
None of that really matters. ""Critters 2"" is a fun little monster movie that builds up well, is highly entertaining, with bits of horror and humor mixed together, and ends with the climactic pinnacle of the series, the great ball of Critter (not spoiling anything considering its on the cover of the DVD and the menu.)
Speaking of the menu, it's obvious that the people making this DVD cared. The picture is sharp and crisp and the sound comes in both stereo and surround sound. The menu has a neat little techno-horror theme to it, set to the bouncing critter ball (I'm ssurprised they didn't make it the cursor icon.) While extras are sparse, New Line did include trailers for all 4 ""Critters"" films that have as good of quality as the movie itself. In fact, they picked such good quality, I'm probably going to end up getting the rest of the series, despite the fact that I KNOW the final two movies suck.
If you like monster movies and are looking for some fun horror/comedy, ""Critters 2"" is one of the best films of the genre. Make sure to pick up the original ""Critters"" as well, both for completeness sake, and because if you like one, you'll certainly like the other.",1070668800,21,3500,4.646774193548387
1882076,5,B000099T3R,"I have been a fan of the Critters Movies, since I was a little Boy.  I remember being about three years old and sitting on my fathers lap, watching these Movies.  I was really scared.  Now I watch them and I'm not that scared, there just very good campy fun.  And there is little to no gore, and maybe 3 Adult Terms, through the hole film.
In the second film, ""Critters 2: The Main Course,"" we find the hero of the first film returning to his hometown to spend easter with his Grandmother.  But when his Grandmother purchases mysterious eggs for there Easter festivitys, he realizes (to later) the eggs are the spawn of the Aliens. And now the pesty little hair-balls have invaded a hole town.  THE BEST IN THE SERIES.",1051401600,,718,4.401515151515151
1882097,4,B000099T3R,"Critters 2 picks up where the other one leaves off in Grovers Bend, Kansas. The eggs left behind are placed too close to a heater and a Children's Day Care. The alien bounty hunters return as does Brad Brown (Scott Grimes) the teen hero in the first film. Brad develops a love interest in a teen reporter (Liane Curtis) a ""Jimmy Olsen with breasts.""

With the characters established, this film moves quickly into the action which provides us with more camp than the first feature. The Critters are less hidden from the camera in this feature. I enjoyed the sequel more than the original. Nothing like a little girl on a tricycle being chased by Critters.

1882098,3,B000099T3R,"For whatever reason, this second entry in the Critters saga starts by canceling out everything in the first film, denying it ever happened and blaming what didn't happen on Brad Brown (Scott Grimes), the young hero from the first film.  On vacation, Brad returns to his hometown and is immediately treated as a scourge for something no one wants to admit happened in the first place.  Worse, they look upon him as the boy who cried CRITTER!  I've never understood this idiotic approach because there were witnesses to the first thrashing this town suffered.  AND.  There were bodies!  They weren't the figment of some kid's imagination.  Be that as it may, in this film, no one has long to wait for the 2 year old Critter eggs to finally hatch and play havoc with the town's Easter celebrations.  At that point, everyone is a believer and seeks to fight back.
For a lot of reasons, this film isn't nearly as good as its predecessor.  Foremost, the incomparable M. Emmet Walsh isn't playing Sheriff Harv this time.  Instead, we have Barry Corbin grinning like a loon in the same role (hardly an adequate replacement).  Most of the cast is new, few give out memorable performances.  The town of Grover's Bend seems a lot smaller.  Everything seems watered down; more of an appetizer than a main course.  Still, it has a few moments (the mishap in the bunny costume for one).",1366761600,,1372,4.686192468619247

1882101,3,B000099T3R,"I knew then when I finished watching the first movie there was a second movie either done or was planned at the time.  With this movie it's not like with the first movie though it takes place in more of the town than that of the first movie had.  While the bounty hunters had thought they had eliminated all the Critters from Earth but unaware that there were still a few eggs that had been left when they had left at the end of the first film.  The humor in the movie has a little more in this one compared to the first movie and the story though hasn't improved in a sense by today's standards, but I feel that it's still a good movie for a sequel to a Sci Fi/Horror/Comedy.  I think that some people may need to check out these movies if you haven't yet.  Overall Critters 2, gets 3 stars out of 5.",1299888000,,801,4.076433121019108

Apparently, some eggs survived the bounty hunters in the first movie, hatched and their occupants decided to wreak a little holiday havoc... Who in t heir right minds thought that Crite eggs would make good Easter decorations? They just don't learn, do they?

As to the discs, they're attractive, but relatively bare, including only trailers for the other Critters movies. No commentary, no special features, a bit disappointing in that regard.",1231977600,,526,5.337349397590361

1882117,4,B000099T3R,"You can look at the cover and know it's not an A-list blockbuster. That being said, for a horror/comedy, I've always thought it was awesome. The aliens are reasonably original (obviously there was a first movie, but you know what I mean), they are cute and cuddly, with lots of teeth and poison darts in their heads; how can you not love them? The characters are reasonably well developed between the two films (they're best watched back to back, though I would skip parts 3 and 4). The special effects, while not stellar, are definately good enough to support the film in the necessary ways. And yes, who can forget the giant ball o' Critters rolling down fleeing citizens and leaving twitching skeletons in its wake (I tend to watch that part five or six times every time I watch this movie). Again, not a deeply fulfilling interpersonal drama, or whatever, but very entertaining, campy alien horror, with enough humor to keep it from being too dark. I definately recommend it.",1177286400,,979,4.730994152046784
1882118,4,B000099T3R,"Critters is one of those sequels that actually tries to continue the storyline from the original film rather than just throw the Critters into a totally new environment and slap a ""part 2"" on it.  Basically those Critter eggs we saw in the last shot of the first film have now hatched.  Why it took two years for them to hatch is a mystery, but who can afford to be logical with a concept like this?  At the same time as this goes on, Brad, the hero boy from the first film, comes back into town to see his hardcore vegetarian gramma.  This time the whole town is under siege rather than one farm, coz there are many more Critters to deal with.  The bounty hunters also return to help.  Terrence Mann is back as the Johnny Steele bounty hunter.  No poofy, blonde rocker hair this time, and he doesn't sing ""Power of the Night""!!  Charlie(Opper) has been hanging out with Mann and his faceless sidekick as an apprentice bounty hunter, and he returns as well.  M. Emmet Walsh doesn't reprise his sheriff role, too bad.  So, what follows is more Critter squishing/blasting, Brad finding romance, the faceless Lee constantly changing his appearance(one of them a hot Playboy centerfold), lame attempts at cutesy Critters humor, and that gigantic Critters ball that rolls over everything in it's path.  This one was directed by Masters Of Horror creator Mick Garris, and hopefully isn't the film that gives him that ""Master"" qualification.  Critters 2 isn't a failure.  Like Halloween 2, it's about as good as it could be considering it's pretty much telling the same story.  Kinda gruesome for a PG-13 too, but then again most of these films were.  While not fantastic, it's a fun slice of schlocky nonsense and makes for a good double feature with the first film coz they do go together nicely.",1174780800,,1791,4.659235668789809
1882119,3,B000099T3R,"Director:  Mick Garris
Cast:  Scott Grimes, Terrence Mann, Don Keith Opper, Cynthia Garris, Al Stevenson, Tom Hodges, Douglas Rowe, Liane Alexandria Curtis, Lindsay Parker, Herta Ware.
Running Time:  93 minutes
Rated PG-13 for lots of critter violence, gore, language, and nudity.

The two alien bounty hunters from the original ""Critters"", Ug (the returning Terrence Mann) who still has the physical appearance of the rock star Johnny Steele while his partner Lee (Gregory Patrick) is still a 'nothing-face' & Charlie (the returning Don Keith Opper as Don Opper) who left Earth with them at the end of the original Critters is now a bounty hunter as well, are reintroduced to the viewer. After having successfully captured their latest bounty the threesome receive a message stating that residual Crite life remains on Earth & that they're payment is being withheld until all trace of the Crites on Earth have been destroyed, the three immediately head for Earth. It's been two years since the Crites tried to eat their way through the small American town of Grovers Bend & Bradley Brown (the returning Scott Grimes) is back in town to visit his Grandmother (Herta Ware) just as a local teenager named Wesley (Tom Hopges) finds some unhatched Critter eggs in the now abandoned Brown barn & sells them to an antiques dealer called Quigley (Douglas Rowe) who in turn sells them as Easter eggs. Predictably enough the Critter eggs begin to hatch & the little bloodthirsty hairballs start to eat their way through Grovers Bend. Only Brad & his reporter friend Megan (Liane Alexandra Curtis) know the truth, together with ex-Sheriff Harv (Barry Corbin) & the three bounty hunters they must convince the townspeople about the Crite's & wipe them out before it's too late.

Co-written and directed by Mick Garris, ""Critters 2: The Main Course"" is very similar to the original, it's almost as if the filmmakers said to themselves 'why fix it if it ain't broke?' The script by Garris & David Twohy as D.T. Twohy will seem very familiar to anyone who's seen the original.  The comedy elements in ""Critters 2: The Main Course"" become distracting and feel a little out of place at times, when a Critter bumps it's head we hear birds chirping on the soundtrack, or when a Critter has the hair on top of it's head shot off it looks at itself in a reflective surface and says 'b*tchin' or when Lee turns into a topless model (Roxanne Kernohan) from a Playboy magazine complete with a giant staple in her stomach which she pulls out and throws away. There seems to be less straight horror this time around which is a shame, the atmosphere and threat is also missing because of the increased comedy elements.  The special effects on the Critters themselves are moderately effective, yet they aren't noticeably any better than the original There is very little in the way of blood or gore, a bitten foot and flesh stripped skeletons and bones is as graphic as ""Critters 2: The Main Course"" gets,  Technically the film is decent, while editing, music, direction, photography and acting certainly aren't going to win any awards.  Overall, ""Critters 2: The Main Course"" is an good time waster especially for those who enjoyed the original, while this is not quite as good.  Not a classic by any stretch of the imagination but certainly worth a watch as long as you have reasonable expectations.",1135987200,,3374,4.872600349040139

There are way more effects, and the critters this time around have seemed to take on more of a ""gremlin like playful quality"" to them. The giant critter ball, the jumping in the bunny suit, and the whole scene of them at the Hungery Heafer is just classic. Too bad this would not carry over to the next two installments.",1124150400,,395,4.351351351351352
1882122,2,B000099T3R,"Critters 2 both improves and falls short of the original. Though it gives the writers more freedom in imagination and the cute, little killer furballs and various ways to cause havoc it simply cannot escape the 'been there done that' factor that cripples most sequels.

Set two years after the first film, the people of Grover's Bend are shocked when Brad Brown comes home to visit his grandma. He was branded a liar and hoaxer and apparently no one believed his stories of the Krites and extra-terrestrial bounty hunters. Which is a little harsh considering they had several eaten humans and dead Krites as proof. And as soon as he returns, the Krite eggs seen at the very end of the first film begin to hatch and the feeding frenzy begins all over again on a bigger scale.

There's fun to be had in watching the critters go mental all over town. And the film could have been a four-starrer but there's a major lull at the end of the second act in which nothing happens and it really slows down. But the massive furball at the end is brilliant.

They really should have left the Critters movies after this and I wouldn't bother with 3 and 4. They're rubbish. Still the Krites are cute (I don't care what you say) and Brad's girlfriend is gorgeous too.

Return from a mission the are informed by the space king that and early mission is not accomplised. He inform them that the have detected  signs of krite life on Earth.
Refusing to pay them until the Krites are total anilimated Charle Ug and Lee Return to Earth. A now older bradly Brown returns to Grovers Bend to stay with his grandmother for easter. The misleading thing about the movie is there is  a lot more krites on earth than I expected.
Instead only four there are hundreds of them. The owner of the Newspaper formides on of his employes to wqrite a story on Brad Browm. Apparently the incident at his farm caused some bad  palblicity for  grovers Bend.
This of all the Critters movies is the gorrest. It also is full of funny lines. One of my favorite is when Bradly Brown saids"" who we going to call criter busters.
I thought the part at the end when all the Krite  connect together to become a giant ball is cool. The roll toward  the church and try to crush it.  It looks like the end for Grovers been.  When suddenly Charle goes kamazike.  He fly the space ship directly at the ball.  The plane crash in fire  vaporizes the  the remaining krites.
Think Charley is dead they all norman. Ug even  turns into charley to cheer Brad up. Ug along flies up into space. Were he later in Critters 4  would become the owner of a coperation and go form good to bad.
As for Lee is killed by the Krites  the game on  him and he dies in the form of a model.  Ug and lye can change there shape.  Ug and lee in there reel form luck like the invisible man with out a mouth. There is a seen in the movie that is really fun when Lee tries to transform into Freddy Krugur. Is presuade by Charley to transform into a swim suit model again.  This and the 4th one are the only that Charle has a major rule in.  In the firts one he is a minor charater. In the third one he is barely evolved only being in about 10 percent of the movie. He does not real get involved much until like the last 15 minutes of Critters 3. This is the best of the horror movie series  that  came out after Gremlins that I have seen. I you like this I also recomend Ghoulies 1 and 2.

This movie does continue where the first one left off even though it takes place 2-4 years later.

Despite the fact that Critters 2 may not be as dark (literally) as the first movie and the little bit of humor seems cheesy at times, this film pretty much ranks up there with the first one. As I said in my review of Critters, these movies are geared more towards teenagers than adults. After all, the Critter films are ""B movies"".",1076112000,,808,4.541095890410959

It's been two years since the small Kansas town invaded by the Krites in the previous film was, well, invaded, and now, bounty hunters Ug, Lee, and their recruit from Earth, Charlie, are being contacted to return and clean up the planet once and for all. See, at the end of the first film, a nest of Critter eggs was left behind. Well, they're finally gonna hatch, but not before being painted and hidden for the local egg hunt! Mayhem ensues, along with some nasty deaths. It's just Brad Brown's luck to be visiting his old hometown again too. He naturally is immediately considered to be part of the cause of what's going one. Together with the bounty hunters, they must again do battle with the Krites to the bitter end! And it's going to be just as weird and dangerous as the first time!

Critters 2: The Main Course is a fun little sequel to the 1986 classic. The key castmembers return, and the Critters are bad as ever. It's another great ride in the tradition of alien monster invasion movie sequels. The DVD includes the sequel and can also be bought in a DVD set with the other 4 films.
