8644425,5,B00IPAORS8,"GREAT DVD, picture is clear and because it's been digitally remastered.
It is unlike some DVDs of old movies that the pictures were blurry, grainy and fading and seems to be produced by Desert Island videos and Mr fat-W videos. I now avoid these two productions like I avoiding defects because there are defects.",1471305600,,312,4.796296296296297

8644427,4,B00IPAORS8,"Interesting movie. Glad I took a chance to check it out. Another excellent-looking (and sounding) Raro release. I do want to express a specific opinion here; this is, in no way, a giallo. It's a police procedural with a solid solve-a-murder plot. Nothing wrong with that, though; it's quite a good police procedural, with a brisk pace and bizarre juxtaposition of humor, violence and tragedy. As with many Italian films of this period, there are GREAT, interesting faces on display. (and some gorgeous bodies as well). The quirky soundtrack is a bit hit-or-miss for me. I'm accustomed to even the most serious and brutal Italian police films of the late sixties/ early seventies featuring some dreadfully schmaltzy theme music. That isn't the case here, it's just that sometimes the music-as-counterpoint-to-action approach just went too far for me. The music itself is cool, though. The other aspect which missed the mark for me was the ivory-tower preaching from the main investigator. It just didn't seem to fit his character. And another scene of his friend trying to talk a prostitute out of staying in the trade was equally at odds with the wearily strident, business-as-usual approach to many of the undercover investigation sequences. Things get a little too melodramatic here and there but, given the nature of the family tragedy I was able to accept it. Be warned, though, the subject matter IS lurid and disturbing, even if often more from implication than display. And another nice enthusiastic and informative video introduction from Chris at Fangoria. Good stuff.",1429142400,3,1577,5.1400778210116735
8644428,5,B00IPAORS8,"Intriguing Italian mystery/crime-police detective from 1970 Milan. I think the film stands the test of time, it is as compelling to watch this movie today as it was forty years ago.  The movie also is unlike many of its genre at the time because it focuses a lot on the moral issues of revenge and lives of prostitutes, and small time hoodlums.  For example, two of the characters (one small time crook and a black prostitute) change for better during the course of the film.  So basically, the movie can appeal to people with high standards of morality, and or to folks who are on the verge and need help from others in order to change their lives around.  However, that being said, the focal point of the plot is the disappearance of a young woman who suffers from a sickness that renders her incapable to think and behave like an adult person.  It is a woman with a mind of 5-year old.  Her father and only parent, who also happens to be extremely devoted to her, one day finds that his daughter has disappeared. After some time goes by, and without any luck in finding his daughter he goes to a well known detective and bags him to help him find his daughter.  The detective (Frank Wolff) together with his younger and more hot-tempered partner devote their entire time on finding out who has kidnapped the young woman. At the same time, the father proceeds with his own investigation...will they be able to find the girl in time? who is the kidnapper? what was the reason for the woman's disappearance? -- watch and find out...A little known fact about this film: Frank Wolff committed suicide in the bathtub of his hotel room in 1971, a year after Death Occurred Last Night came out.",1411344000,4,1689,4.536184210526316
8644429,4,B00IPAORS8,"A father shows up at police headquarters telling the inspector in charge that his daughter has gone missing but there is one catch, the daughter is in her twenties with the mind of a three year old and unfortunately is a nymphomanic.  This sets up Director Duccio Tessari's 'DEATH OCCURRED LAST NIGHT' aka 'LA MORTE RISALE A IERI SERA'-1970, an unclassifiable thriller that emerges as a pressure cooker that explodes with a ferocious climax and is different than any of his other films.  Cutting his teeth with early screen writing credits with Directors such as Sergio Leone and Sergio Corbucci, he is known primarily for his collaborations with actor Guiliano Gemma  but here, he approaches the thriller drama with an intensity that sets it apart from other similar films at that time.  The film stars one of America's most underrated actors Frank Wolfe who worked with such Directors as Roger Corman and Monte Hellman before pursuing a career in Italy assembling a body of work with many major talents but succumbing tragically to suicide over a failed relationship with an actress.  Wolfe brings an intensity to his inspector role that cannot be shaken and really enhances the proceedings.  Along for the ride are actors Raf Vallone in one of his best roles as the tragic father figure, Gabriele Tinti as Wolfe's partner who appeared in many Euro titles in the seventies and was the lucky husband of Black Emmanuelle herself, Laura Gemser and beautiful Eva Renzi who plays Wolfe's innamorata.  The screenplay is based on a work by crime writer Giorgio Scerbanenco and German Producer Artur Braun who is known for his adaptations of Edgar Wallace murder mysteries in the sixties and also produced films with Director Jess Franco.  All in all, it is Tessari's most accomplished work lacking humor which weakened some of his other titles and shows what he could have done with a Giallo thriller if given a chance.  Raro Video is up to its usual high standards by getting a beautiful high definition transfer from a 35mm negative (I viewed the DVD transfer and it was flawless) in Italian with English subtitles and an enhanced Dolby Stereo track bringing out the impressive Music score by Gianni Ferrio.  The only extras are an Italian trailer and a useless Introduction by Fangoria Magazine Editor Chris Alexander ( the enclosed booklet goes over the same territory).  Highly recommended for Euro film fans,  it's a great rarity in need of repeated viewings.",1399766400,10,2460,4.944174757281553
