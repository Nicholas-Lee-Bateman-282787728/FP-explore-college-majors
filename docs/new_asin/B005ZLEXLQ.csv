The PAL DVD masters are edited with brand new digital photoshop-looking ""title cards"" (to correct US spelling with UK) and ""ending credits"" (to stick on [...] to look modern I guess? The worst of it is they removed the original music and used some stupid happy music that isn't from the original series. Since the copyright on the package states it is a joint ownership I can only assume this was done just to make a ""derivative"" work.

The NTSC masters by WB (available on DVD and Instant video) are the original unedited masters with everything in tact the way you remembered them.",1386892800,,628,4.598214285714286
8489867,5,B005ZLEXLQ,"I am the proud owner of the smurfs ultimate collection volume 1 and 2.
First off this product is region 2/4  so for those of from USA / North America ,
our dvds are region 1,  region 2/4 WILL NOT PLAY ON THE STANDARD DVD PLAYER.  A region free player or modified settings on your pc will allow you to view these gorgeous cartoons ......  First off let me say kudos to the Magma Corporation for giving me the opportunity to purchase these cherished childhood memories.  The quality of picture and sound is at no way at a loss, if anything it looks to me like new.  If you grew up in the 80s and want the smurfs this is the only way to get the complete collection as the USA has no intentions to release this to us.  I paid a little over $400 for the 2 sets and shipping ...  small fee for the complete collection of one of my favorite shows ....  specials are included.  This set gets 2 big thums up and 5 stars ............  a  perfect 10 if there ever was on to be given .",1331769600,6,973,4.036649214659686
