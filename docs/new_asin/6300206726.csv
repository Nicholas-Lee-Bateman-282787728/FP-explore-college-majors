Laurel and Hardy are funny. And they do it without foul language, sexual inuendo, violence or racism. How refreshing to watch them.

This particular tape was full of some of their more well known sketches.

Well worth the money and can be enjoyed by anyone! A miracle today.",1168473600,,345,4.622950819672131
