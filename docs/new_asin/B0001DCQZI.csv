8010262,2,B0001DCQZI,"This looks like a routine whodunit in which the cops must figure out which of the characters inhabiting a so-called mental clinic killed one of the staff.  But the clinic's jaw-dropping incompetence or lack of interest in controlling its inmates kept distracting this viewer from getting into the basic yarn.  The patients seem to wander around unrestrained and unattended, engaging in such recreations as firing bows and arrows and sharing beds with one another.  One unbalanced chap simply takes the stairs to the top of the building and flings himself off.  Throughout all this, the place is crawling with cops, who have their own problems just getting the cuffs on the murderer, who manages to skip away down to the seashore, where he becomes mired in a bog, relying on commander Dalgleish to pull him out.

And then there's Roy Marsden as Dalgleish.  As reputable British actors go, Marsden ranks well down on the charisma scale.  He's tall and well-spoken but has almost no affect at all, rarely changing expression or evincing any emotion.  I've not read any of P.D. James' books, but I gather that Dalgleish is styled as a published poet.  It's hard for me to imagine Marsden's Dalgleish mustering the emotional involvement to compose much of any sort of poetry.  Perhaps that's why the TV scripts only infrequently allude to his poetic bent.",1312675200,,1350,4.933628318584071
8010263,4,B0001DCQZI,"This adaptation is quite short, under 2 hrs.  So the pacing is quicker and story necessarily a more direct than the other 6 hr adaptations.  The acting is really nice though, and this is one of the adaptations that I have watched multiple times for that reason.  The ending is over the top, but I loved it.  I hope they paid that poor actor a lot to do the ending scene!  You'll have to see it to see what I mean.",1112054400,6,413,4.049382716049383
