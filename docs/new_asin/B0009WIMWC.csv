8165672,4,B0009WIMWC,"Overall this is a pretty good story. The cast was pretty good and played their parts well although I was a bit disappointed in the character of Tasembeker. For some reason Eric Saward, the writer, made Peri more whiny than usual. The part of the DJ was superbly performed by Alexei Sayle and Clive Swift's performance of Jobel was fantastic.

Never having seen this story before, I was confused a bit with the cream and gold Daleks until the second half when the good old grey pepperpots made their appearance and it all fell into place.",1490227200,,537,4.59375
