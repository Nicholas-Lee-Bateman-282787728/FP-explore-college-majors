8403680,5,B003RHZ64S,So funny! Yes it has closed caption (CC),1404518400,,40,4.125
8403681,2,B003RHZ64S,"It started out with promise, but it quickly goes way downhill and does a splat into the gutter, and the laughs become few and far between. The film is cast with mostly has been stars and the script is weak. Watching the main character shoot up with heroin and never change his clothes in 110 degree heat isn't a recipe for hilarity...",1392249600,,334,4.403225806451613
8403682,2,B003RHZ64S,"This one went to the round file after I watched it. Not fond of bathroom humor or the obvious, but typical, sarcastic put down of Christianity. Weak story line, most of the characters seemed like this was just another film to churn out to make the bill payments.",1385856000,,262,4.479166666666667
8403683,5,B003RHZ64S,Great little almost unknown movie with an all-star cast!  Ronnie Blevins is on his way to being a force to be reckoned with in the motion picture business!,1382313600,,155,4.535714285714286
8403684,5,B003RHZ64S,"An original, extremely colorful, ultra-trippy comedy featuring an all-star cast.  This film is uniquely individual and takes a trip down the rabbit hole of one man's life in the strangest neighborhood in California.  Ethan Inglebrink is a lovable and clownishly endearing character who annoys and at times frightens many of the people around him.  Living alone in his family home, unable to leave due to agoraphobia, and on the brink of being evicted by his belligerent landlord (played by Rip Torn), Ethan concocts a plan to stay by growing the exotic American Cowslip flower in order to win the local gardening competition.  Will his jealous neighbor ruin his attempt or will he implode of his own doing?  Unexpected (or maybe not completely unexpected) ending.",1363046400,,763,5.120967741935484
8403685,1,B003RHZ64S,"I was pretty intrigued by the movie. well, at least by the actors who were in it and the fact that it seemed quirky and offbeat. I watched it and don't know how they ended up with the description redneck comedy. neither one is accurate. A small town heroine addict can't leave his home for agoraphobia and is being evicted for not paying his rent. This all makes no sense to me, and I love weird movies with little plot. The performances by Rip Torn and Bruce Dern were great, but all the other amazing actors were under-utilized. How can you have Cloris Leachman, Val Kilmer, Diane Ladd and Peter Faulk in a film and it fizzles? Oh, yeah, they need a script. I can understand how people may like this movie. If you are into very detailed well acted scenes; it has them. Unfortunately they are strung together oddly and the plot plods along and eventually goes no where. I really wanted to like this.",1315612800,,900,4.427710843373494
8403686,4,B003RHZ64S,"I friend of mine told me about this film - said it was akin to Tim Burton/Terry Gilliam. Honestly, I didn't know what to expect.

The opening sequence hooked me. And the film carried me along for the duration. Really good stuff. I was very surprised - especially at the fact I had never heard of the film before.

Read what you want about the plot, actors, etc., this one's a keeper.",1302307200,,383,4.305555555555555
8403687,1,B003RHZ64S,"***high points****
interesting charters
decent acting
good cinematography

***why you should pass on it***
flimsy plot that drags and drags then goes nowhere
gratuitous drug use that is long, painful and adds nothing to the story

I don't know how this movie was made. I think nepotism or someone own someone a favor.
who ever edited is was far to attached to the material. If they would've had the sense to edit it down to 20 min this would have been with out a doubt a big winner at sundance as a short film. 2 hrs of my life that I will never get back.",1286928000,,555,4.276190476190476
8403688,5,B003RHZ64S,"There are three reasons you should watch this movie:

1) Ronnie Blevins (the lead) is an amazing actor.
He really lets loose in this film and it's fun to watch.

2) The story reminds me that beauty comes in many different forms.

3) Rip Torn is out of his mind. His character is kinda kooky too.",1283990400,4,295,4.232142857142857
