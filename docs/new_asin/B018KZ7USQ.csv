8742603,5,B018KZ7USQ,Thoroughly enjoyed this beautiful film. The tug between judgement/revulsion and being caught up in their romance made for a interesting conflict as a viewer.,1494115200,,157,5.583333333333333
8742604,4,B018KZ7USQ,"A French avant garde movie with an unsavory topic:  I thought I would be disappointed but quite the opposite.  There were moments in this movie where its Frenchness was a detraction.  The juxtaposition of different eras was at times confusing and took away some of the seriousness of the topic.  That aside, I really loved the acting.  There was a certain lushness to the characters despite the icky fact that they were siblings.  Somehow, I could get past that and see them as two individuals who for whatever reason, have formed an unusual attachment that no one can break.  Despite the best efforts of their parents to separate them, they run away together.  At this point, Marguerite had been married off as an attempt to break the siblings' bond.  The jealous husband calls the authorities and presses charges of adultery and incest.  Their story is based on a true story that happened in the early part of the 17th century in France.  Because of the religious morals of the time, their ending is not a happy one.  Please see this movie with an open mind and judge for yourself.",1479254400,2,1083,4.671957671957672
8742605,4,B018KZ7USQ,"I just love this movie.  It is so touching.  However, I must say that the film may not be acceptable to some who are used to traditional story-telling.  It is a bit too French, so to speak.  But for those who are open to new experiences, it is a great film",1469836800,2,256,3.9607843137254903
8742606,2,B018KZ7USQ,"Marguerite & Julien uses the theme of forbidden love between siblings and is based on a true story that took place in 17th-century France. Director Valerie Donzelli moves the time period to an unspecific blend of the 19th and 20th centuries, judging by the fashions. When Marguerite (Anais Demoustier) and Julien de Ravalet (Jeremie Elkaim) are reunited as adults, their childhood affection blossoms into carnal passion and the lovers escape into the woods to live as a couple, far from the moral judgments of society. Though the premise lends itself to thoughtful drama and sympathetic performances, the movie cant shake a consistently icky feel.

Its tough to elicit sympathy for incest, however charming or attractive the leads may be. The script portrays the lead characters as naive, probably so we make allowances for unwise youth, but it never rings true. Though good-looking, Demoustier and Ekaim are wooden, partially due to bland dialogue and a male lead who looks far older than the character he is portraying. This succeeds in alienating the viewer, who is already put off by the notion of sex between siblings.

Apart from script problems, the movie is a mishmash of cinematic showiness that takes the viewer out of the action and draws awareness to the filmmaking process. Visual compositions are sloppy, anachronistic rock n roll music blares from the soundtrack, editing choices are awkward, production design is uninspired, and overall the film looks like it was made quickly on the cheap. There is also an unrelieved aura of oppressive solemnity in a movie that could definitely stand a bit of levity. The film was originally an early 1970s project planned for Francois Truffaut, who went on to direct Day For Night instead.

The only special feature on the unrated widescreen DVD is a theatrical trailer. The film is in French. English and Spanish subtitles are available options.",1468627200,2,1899,5.09967845659164
8742607,5,B018KZ7USQ,"I kinda loved this movie.
It is the true story of a young brother and sister, Marguerite and Julien, close as children, who were accused of incest as adults and were pursued and eventually caught and executed by French authorities.  This all happened hundreds of years ago-- or did it all happen in a sort of eternal now?  The movie is told as a timeless story (with plenty of anachronisms: a french monarchy, execution by beheading, photography and helicopters all exist in this world at once).  Flirty, tragic, gorgeous, romantic, depressing, and uplifting in turns.
It both lets you feel the intensity and genuineness of Marguerite and Julien's bond, while subtly questioning whether any romantic/sexual relationship is worth sacrificing (perhaps literally) one's future.
The performances especially by Jeremie Elkaim, who plays Julien, were beyond good, they were absolutely essential to telling the story.  Luckily all of the quite constant directorial flourishes took a solid backseat to the performances, otherwise we would only have an eccentric act of film-making instead of a narrative, and certainly not a love story.  Elkaim's performance was a revelation, (gonna get girlie here) I pretty much fell in love with him.  He is a point of quiet, inexorable magnetism in every scene.
So, yes, I guess I love this movie.
A NOTE ABOUT THE CRITICS:
This film has been criticized for its narrative framing: throughout the movie the action cuts back to young girls in an orphanage talking about Marguerite and Julien.  Critics describe the framing devise this way: ""The story of Marguerite and Julien is told as a romantic fairy tale to young orphans in the future, which is inappropriate and improbable considering, ya know, the incest.""
In my opinion this is completely wrong. The story of the incestuous lovers is not recited during story-time by an authority figure. It is night, the children are in bed secretly discussing Marguerite and Julien in whispers because they are scandalous lovers who have been in the news lately. A young woman awakens and tells the tale in a rather theatrical manner. You get the feeling that the woman is not really supposed to be contributing to the children's scandalous stories.  This obviously does not take place in the future because the orphans disappear never to return about 2/3 of the way through the movie, M&J's ultimate fates were unknown to them, and so, had NOT HAPPENED YET.
Just wanted to clear that up.  Jeez, critics.",1464307200,4,2475,5.046568627450981
