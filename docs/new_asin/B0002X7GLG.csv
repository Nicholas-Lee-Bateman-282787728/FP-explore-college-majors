8034005,4,B0002X7GLG,Sister really in joys the show a lot but a little disappointed there wasn't more to it. We all thought there would be more to it.,1388707200,,129,4.0
8034006,4,B0002X7GLG,"The plot, while its seems recycled, comes with its own originality.
This OVA is only 50 minutes long, but its worth every minute, especially if you plan on watching Munto 2.
Don't want to spoil the plot. You're just going to have to see it for yourself.",1383004800,,253,4.404255319148936
8034007,3,B0002X7GLG,"""Munto"" is the start of a fasinating story with incredible characters!  Unfortunately, the movie doesn't do them justice.  It's too short, and doesn't get the chance to get deep into the characters and their relationships.  The animation style is beautiful and detailed, which is strange that they put so much effort into just a short 52min movie!  And the soundtract--awesome!  The opening tract on the dvd menu rocks.

The story is about a Heavenly World which floats as 'island continents' in the sky, but invisible to ordinary humans because it is in another dimension, secured in it's own time and space barrier.  Akuto is the energy which supports the Heavenly World and it cannot survive w/out it.  Alas, similar to humans using up our earth's resources, the heavenly beings have used up all the Akuto, and the only way to save what's left is to destroy the kingdom that Munto is king of.  But Munto learns of a prophecy of a human girl, Yumemi, who carries Akuto w/in her, and goes to find her in order to save his kindgom--and the earth also, cuz if it is destroyed it will fall and smash into earth!

Meanwhile on earth, Yumemi has always been able to see the 'islands in the sky' though no one else can.  And suddenly she is seeing visions of Munto calling for her to give her power to him to save his world.  But she is scared, as anyone would be if suddenly seeing such things, and thinks she's going crazy.  Later, after realizing her duty to save everyone's future, she finds a way to help Munto, and all live happily ever after... well, maybe not, as there is now a ""Munto 2"".

I absolutely LUV Munto's character, and Gass, and.. well, all of them!  Munto could easily become one of anime's top hotties!  But the movie go much into the characters since it was so short, and the interaction between Munto and Yumemi was very superficial as there just wasn't enough time to develop any relationship.  The story is very original (I think so) and has huge potential!  This should be an actual 'series' not just a 'movie', if you ask me.  I was hooked from the trailer, but the movie left my mouth dry and wanting so much more that it didn't deliver.

""Munto"" is definately worth watching, for the music, backgrounds, amazing detailed animation style, and awesome characters (ok, yeah, I have the hots for Munto ^_^).  I would like to see more development in Munto and Yumemi's relationship.  Perhaps Munto 2 will be more fullfilling??",1147910400,5,2446,4.613425925925926
8034008,4,B0002X7GLG,"I think that Munto OVA is underrated! Is not a bad anime as many ppl say, the little problem is that it's only 50 minutes for a fantasy history being explained. Without this I find it excellent, the drawings, backgrounds and simplicity and beauty of the characters! Is an interesting movie and it has his own original and cool history!

I's a movie of friendship, confidence and strength! Besides this is the first episode of this OVA, there is coming the second one in 4th April of this year!",1142035200,,493,4.53932584269663
8034009,4,B0002X7GLG,"Yumemi is a psychic schoolgirl who just wants to be normal. But will discover the true value of her gift, when Magical King Munto arrives in her world, with enemies in hot pursuit! Munto's realm is linked to ours by magic, but the power is fading, and his world is on the brink of death.",1137888000,,287,4.236363636363636
8034010,4,B0002X7GLG,"This movie was very good. I would recommend it to any anime fan. The artist could have added more to it, such as having th girl actually visit the world and such but it was still a great movie. It's about a girl who is able to see another world that floats above ours, but when that world is in perral they need her help. It's all about how she has to believe in herself and others, so she can save this world.",1100995200,4,410,3.9518072289156625
