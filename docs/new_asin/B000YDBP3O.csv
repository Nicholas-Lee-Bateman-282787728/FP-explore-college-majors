3026058,1,B000YDBP3O,"Despite two fine actors (Christian Slater, Willian H Macy) in this film, the plot is pretty dumb and hard to figure out. Is this a comedy or a drama?  There are a few good moments but most of the time I had to advance to the next chapter to get an idea of what is going on.  This is a C movie at best.  I suggest to rent it -- not buy it if you want to figure it out yourself.  I rented it and I feel I threw away the money for the rental.  Try something else--just not this movie.",1200700800,4,481,3.722772277227723
3026059,4,B000YDBP3O,"Any movie featuring Christian Slater is worth checking out, he only seems to appear in character-and-dialogue driven plots that develop conflict and personalities rather than cars, cleavage, and pyrotechnics (though it is ironic that all three play a part in the film).  'He was a quiet man' has variously been described as a cross between 'Brazil' and 'Fight Club,' or a hybrid of 'Office Space' and 'Taxi Driver,' take your pick, either description is accurate.  Both touching and witty amidst the darkness, 'he was a quiet man' features cynical talking goldfish egging the protagonist on, and a portrayal of rush hour traffic zooming by that is simultaneously claustrophobic and unforgettable.",1200614400,4,696,5.318181818181818
3026060,4,B000YDBP3O,"I had the pleasure of being invited to watch the screening of ""He Was A Quiet Man"" in LA the 15th of March at the Wilshire Fine Arts Theater. I am not a film critic therefore I can't really dissect the film and all its cinematic attributes. I can only say that the story was very cohesive and consistent. The characters were completely believable and the dialog, camera work, music, editing and special effects were first rate. The story itself is what makes this film special. I don't even want to start to recap any part of it for the readers because being a ""dark comedy"" requires fast transition from being taking down a serious and dramatic path only to be presented with dialog and/or visuals that instantaneously transition to comedy. That takes witty dialog, perfect timing in presentation and results in audience spontaneous reaction with laughter. This film does all those things and very well. Therefore, if I ""preview"" any of the film's action or twists and turns, it will utterly ruin it for you when you see it for the first time.

What this film does not do is wrap everything up in a neat package in 100 minutes. Nor do I think it is supposed to. The film and its story is very complex but not in a confusing way. What I mean is that when you walk out of the theater, the film literally continues in your head for the next 24 hours. As you will process what you saw and experienced and remember details that you might have missed or overlooked in the theater and you will experience what I call ""Ah Ha"" moments of understanding. I recommend that you see it with a friend that you can talk to about it over the next several days and compare impressions and observations with. Frank Cappello who wrote, directed, co-produced and even wrote the music for the movie has given his best work yet. The cast and crew responded in kind and created a real work of cinematic art for us to enjoy. If you enjoy a film that is a bit quirky, contains lots of nuance, makes you think and at the same time may expose a little of your own insecurities, I highly recommend the film as a must see - not just once but several times.",1199318400,9,2127,4.412213740458015

3026062,5,B000YDBP3O,"All 5 stars!  What a fantastic alternate role for a great actor.  Christian Slater blew me away...never would have known it was him based on previous acting performances.  And what a ride it was...just not sure if it was real or unreal...only to discover in the end that it was BOTH!  And the soundtrack enhanced the mood(s).  Great hidden gem!  Then again...even though it was somewhat tongue-in-cheek, the creepiest part is the reality of the work environment.  It may give us a different opinion of the ""quiet"" people in our workplace.",1321228800,2,538,4.846153846153846
3026063,4,B000YDBP3O,"I have always appreciated Christian Slater, growing up in the Heathers generation and always appreciating his stereotyped role of arrogant teenage angst from that movie to Robin Hood and others. I was sad to see him disappear off the silver screen and hope this movie will mark a resurgence of his career. As a movie, it is clever in several respects and typifies the dissonant culture in which we inhabit, however I felt at times the movie tried too hard to establish some credence that it was somehow removed from this milieu when in fact the exact same cinemtic techniques (quick-cuts, graphic upclose shots, etc) that mark our current are of cinema experience. The cast as a whole fills the story well though everyone except Cushbert and Macy have but a passing role, however the main strength of this movie is a career renaissance for Slater in a role and look he has never quite inhabited before. I recommend this movie on these grounds, and though disappointed with certain aspects of this satirical look at corporate life, find the beauty of an actor's ability to transform himself so thoroughly as to make the audience forget that one is watching what even after a decade or so is still someone with star power.",1316995200,,1220,4.759433962264151
3026064,3,B000YDBP3O,"Other reviewers have done a good job of reviewing the basic plot, so no need to go into that here.  The reason I gave it so few stars is that the whole thing felt like slapstick comedy.  It felt very plastic, very contrived.  And, of course, the whole plot made no sense.

*** SPOILER ALERT ****

There are three endings.  I suggest you watch the two alternate endings in the Extra Features section.  Personally, I preferred the second alternate, it felt much more cohesive and integral to the film.  Both alternate endings made it clear that the whole movie was a fantasy, and that's more what the movie felt like - like it was SUPPOSED to be a dream.

With the ending it had, however, it just seems like a poorly-directed, internally-conflicted film with poor writing and some good actors in it.",1313107200,,797,4.556338028169014

3026066,4,B000YDBP3O,"This movie was recommended by a former co-worker, and I finally got around to seeing it. I am so glad that I did. A social outcast office worker witnesses a shooting and saves a beautiful woman's life. She asks that he end her life so she doesn't have to live as a quardraplegic. A really creepy performance by Christian Slater highlights this one, and it is quite an interesting film. Elisha Cuthbert is excellent here, and the two meld well onscreen. Too bad this one didn't find an audience because it is a real winner.",1305417600,,522,4.505263157894737
3026067,5,B000YDBP3O,"The bluray video and audio quality is good enough (this kind of movie does not rely too much on clarity, etc; it is more about the characters). Story is fantastic. Something I can really relate to. If you like Donnie Darko, Fight Club, Man From Earth, etc kinda movies, you will enjoy this. I don't really like Slater (thinking of Broken Arrow) but he nailed his performance in this one.",1293321600,,387,4.542857142857143
3026068,3,B000YDBP3O,"This movie is OK. Personally I think you will be better off renting this movie to see for yourself if it is worthy to be in your collection for replay value. I will watch it again but it's not one of those movies I will watch often. So, save yourself a few bucks and rent it - I think you'll be happier you saved the money. If not and it's one of those cult classics for you that you can't stand to live without, well, then you'll have to pony up a few more bucks to own it.",1276300800,,474,3.8469387755102042
3026069,4,B000YDBP3O,"Christian Slater takes on the role of the bullied office worker hopelessly infatuated with a young female colleague.  His boss is verbally abusive, his colleagues remote and his personal life lonely.  Other than his pet fish and TV he has no other activities once he leaves his miserable office.  Even his next door neighbors are hostile.

This film is a cross between many movies we have seen in not so recent past.  I keep thinking about ""The Machinist"" film about a man who is so delusional that he is unable to distingish his thoughts from reality.  In this role, Slater brings performance that is absolutely amazing.  Even his physical appearance makes him a whole new persona.  I was mesmerized by the film but the ending left me wondering.  That is until I saw film extras and realized that director himself had difficulty deciding on the ending.  There were three alternate endings.

Performance and story are compelling.  Fans of the actor William H. Macy will be delighted too.  While this film may not have a mass appeal of box office smash, it is definitely worth watching.",1265328000,3,1085,4.8
3026070,4,B000YDBP3O,"This movie grabbed me!  Very thought provoking movie- all about that person in the office or neighborhood that no one really takes time to know.  All they can say about him in hind sight is ""he was a quiet man...""  All actors were perfect for their roles, and gave wonderful performances.",1257984000,,288,4.607843137254902
3026071,5,B000YDBP3O,"In societies where the main values are power,money,status,and where you have to be the best,  shy citizens looking  for a normal life are starting to feel out of place - When a  society pushes their normal citizens to the limit, paranoid behaviours would be common. This is what happen to the main character (Christian Slater) in this movie.
The movie in my opinion is a satire of the contemporary US society with Christian Slater brilliant as usual. In certain way I think  Billy Wilder  in his movie The apartment with Jack Lemmon started to denounce the beginning of this kind of social problems.",1239408000,,599,4.776699029126213
3026072,3,B000YDBP3O,"Christian Slater gives a chilling performance in this small, but effective film. Slater plays a weak alienated man who is constantly ridiculed and bullied at work and through his daily life. We all know that there are people in this world like this, but watching this film, makes one think twice about dumping on the ""quiet man"". This is a well made film with more than a few surprises.",1224806400,,386,4.608695652173913
3026073,2,B000YDBP3O,"A man, played by Christian Slater, takes his gun to work every day.  He is a disgruntled employee and simply cannot muster the strength, thankfully, to actually pull the trigger.  One day as he his performing his daily ritual -- loading live amunition into the gun -- another coworker opens fire on the department.  Slater's character then shoots that man and puts an end to his rampage.  And he is almost declared the hero, though no one ever knows if he shot that man in defense or out of spite because that man did what he never could.

No matter how many times anyone describes this movie to me as a comedy, I will simply not understand where that comes from.  You may call it a dark comedy, but it is dark without the comedy.  The characters are all so uncomfortable around each other, you cannot help but feel uncomfortable seeing them on screen.  The plot is weak, which would lead me to assume the characters were the focus, but consider that not only does Slater's guy take his gun to work everyday but he only talks to his fish.  Oh yeah, and they talk to him too.  You decide.

The movie glossed over the fact that he carried a gun to work every day, almost as if society has become so accustomed to violence that this is acceptable behavior.  Society has become accustomed to a certain level of violence, which is sad in and of itself, but movies that take characters like this protagonist lightly are not ones I will enjoy.",1222905600,,1436,4.438931297709924
3026074,5,B000YDBP3O,"This is a little gem of a movie...it was made in 11 days and on a dime.  But it's a powerful movie.  Christian Slater was great.  I hadn't even heard of this movie, but I really enjoyed it, but then I like off-beat movies.",1208908800,,222,4.0
3026075,4,B000YDBP3O,"A review on the cover of the DVD likens this film to David Fincher's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fight-Club-Two-Disc-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B00003W8NM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fight Club (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)</a>&nbsp;and Jean-Pierre Jeunet's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Amelie/dp/B0000640VO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Amelie</a>.  To some extent, this is a valid comparison, but He Was a Quiet Man fails to reach the brilliance of the other two films.

Bob (Christian Slater) is an office worker at the end of his tether who dreams of blokwing up his place of employment.  At home, he has no one to talk to but his goldfish, and one of them actually talks back -- mostly to berate Bob for his lack of initiative.  One day, as Bob is trying to talk himself into turning a gun on his co-workers, a fellow worker beats him to it.  But when the other man turns his gun on Vanessa, Bob's secret crush, Bob takes an action that changes both of their lives.

While the ending isn't particularly surprising, this film is worth watching for the performances alone, particularly Christian Slater's.  I'm used to Slater playing the wise-cracking self-assured hero, but he's very convincing here as the office loser with no redeeming qualities.",1207440000,2,1338,6.122994652406417
3026076,5,B000YDBP3O,"What a gem this film is! ""He Was a Quiet Man"" is an examination of the ""inner self"" in us all. How much of ourselves do we show in public? Is that hunky guy REALLY a mouse at heart? Is that gorgeous blonde REALLY a nagging shrew?

Christian Slater has finally delivered his best! He plays Bob Maconel, a bookish nerd office worker who talks to his pet fish, moving headlong into middle age with nothing to show for all his toil. Elisha Cuthbert plays a woman who works in an office upstairs, with the CEO (William H. Macy), after sleeping her way to the position she holds. While it may seem that these two have absolutely NOTHING in common, an incident in Bob's office basically brings these two together in the most unexpected way.

The relationship that developes gives Bob a new lease on life. he no longer dreams of revenge (did I say he keeps a loaded revolver in his desk?), but rather, how he can make life worth living, for both himself, and the new woman in his life. Because of the circumstances surrounding his part in the office incident, Bob is a hero! He is given an office upstairs! The job is really nothing more than a senecure, but it affords Bob a greater sense of security. Life is good! Until..........

Many have compared this film to ""Brazil"", and while it has more than just a passing similarity to it, the performances of the principle actors in this most darkest of comedies, is awards-worthy! If you want to see one of the best Indies to come out in a while, you MUST see ""He Was a Quiet Man""!!",1207008000,,1522,4.390070921985815
3026077,2,B000YDBP3O,"The first time I tried to watch ""He Was a Quiet Man,"" I had to stop after about twenty minutes. There was something about the insincerity of all the characters that I found extremely grating.

A few weeks later, I picked up where I left off and watched the rest of it, complete with all the alternative endings. I stand by my first impression. This is a quirky film about an angry office worker, named Bob, who brings a gun to work and by an unexpected set of circumstances becomes a hero instead of the villain.

There's not one character in the story that is particularly likable, except possibly Vanessa, who undergoes a life-changing experience after becoming a quadriplegic as a result of the shootings. A touching love story quickly becomes unraveled by Bob's idiosyncrasies.

I suppose if the film is setting out to portray, as a black comedy, the profile of a deeply paranoid individual, ""He Was a Quiet Man"" succeeds magnificently. There's a paranoid edge to this psychological thriller from beginning to end. If that's what you're looking for, it's quite effective.

It's just that it's not what I'm looking for when I set out to see a show. While the film is effective at what it does, I can't think of a person I'd recommend it to.",1204243200,2,1243,4.636363636363637
3026078,4,B000YDBP3O,"Christian Slater's portrayal of a tortured soul in ""He Was A Quiet Man"" has us experiencing the character's torment. We become immersed in the character's unbearable mental strain. We share in the confusion between reality and hallucination. Just as Slater's character, Bob Maconel, is on the brink of meltdown, a bizarre event propels him into the role of hero. Maconel's life slowly turns around. He finds love and healing. And then suddenly his life again unravels. The film keeps us guessing to the end with its many twists and turns. Elisha Cuthbert gives a fine performance as Maconel's love interest. A taut commentary on the consequences of an inhumane workplace.",1203811200,,671,5.109090909090909
3026079,3,B000YDBP3O,"Poor Bob Maconel (Christian Clater) is an overworked and underpaid office worker. He lives alone and besides being stressed-out is also mentally unstable; he sees singing hummingbirds outside his kitchen window and his pet goldfish talk to him. Bob is walked over by everyone at work and becomes fed up with his life. He hates several of his coworkers and decides to do something about it. He brings a gun to work and prepares to shoot some of his colleagues. On the day that Bob decides to go through with his plan, he's beaten to the act by another coworker, ends up shooting the gunman, saves the life of the girl he loves, and becomes a hero. The girl he saves, Venessa Parks (Elisha Cuthbert), wishes she would have died because the wound she receives leaves her as a quadriplegic. She asks Bob to do something for her that could change both of their lives forever. Yet, in the world that Bob lives in, nothing is quite as it seems and everyone around him might just be using him for ulterior purposes.

HE WAS A QUIET MAN was written and directed by Frank A. Cappello. In light of the various public and school shootings that have happened in the past few years, the questions that HE WAS A QUIET MAN raises are particularly relevant, such as what causes a seemingly normal man go over the edge and take the lives of other people?, can such a person be saved?, and is there any way to stop their actions before they happen?

The overall tone, mood, and setting of the film is very minimalistic. The acting is well done, especially Christian Slater who offers one of the finest film performances of his career as the troubled Bob Maconel. Slater is typically known for playboy or bad boy roles, but is completely unrecognizable as Maconel. Also noteworthy are Elisha Cuthbert as Venessa Parks who gives a star performance by using only her face and pinky.

Even though I enjoyed the acting performances and some of the cinematography, I just found HE WAS A QUIET MAN to be an average movie. It is a decent drama with some fine acting and explores some important issues, but I just didn't find it all that compelling. It's a must-see movie for any Christian Slater or Elisha Cuthbert fans, but most others probably won't find it as compelling and may be turned off by the rather dark and bleak ending.

The DVD offers a featurette entitled ""First Look at HE WAS A QUIET MAN"", deleted scenes and alternative endings, an audio commentary with director Frank A. Cappello, and the theatrical trailer. I found the deleted scenes and alternative endings with the director's commentary to be most interesting. The film could have turned out much differently.",1203724800,2,2655,4.654584221748401
3026080,4,B000YDBP3O,"Bob (Christian Slater), a meek, lonely office worker on the brink of explosive violence, keeps a dashboard hula girl on top of his cubicle wall and a gun in his desk.  He even has a detonator in his lunch box.  His co-workers belittle or ignore him.  He eats lunch alone outside and imagines blowing up his office building.  At home, his bug-eyed goldfish tells him like it is -- and the truth is not pretty.  What's a lonely man to do?  When a tragedy takes Bob and his co-workers by surprise, Bob finds himself in a strange and demanding relationship with his long-time crush Venessa (Elisha Cuthbert.)

We see Bob's slow, steady drive toward work as other cars whiz by in a blur of colors.  Bob vanishes and reappears as he makes his way from front door to driving seat.  In a world where everything appears fractured, Bob is the only stability, even though he is far from stable himself.

Christian Slater is superb as the uptight, tortured, outwardly impassive but inwardly enraged Bob.  Elisha Cuthbert makes the transition well between ephemeral office beauty to the bitter, emotionally demanding woman she becomes, although she occasionally forces the acting just a little.  William H. Macy is properly self-absorbed, though not memorable, as their boss, Gene Shelby.

The special features are notable for the cut scenes, with commentary by director Frank Capello.  Fortunately, we are made to watch the entire film again, looking for red Xs or other signs to see these scenes in context.  Instead, Capello shows the excised snippets with the beginning of the next scene only; Capello makes it clear why the scenes were included in the original shooting and why they were eventually cut.  Most interesting is the two alternate endings, both of which are not quite as compelling as the one that made it, although one comes close.

In the end, this film doesn't hold together as well as some, but it is intriguing nonetheless.  The plot turns are much more startling than those in the earlier&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Falling-Down/dp/0790742780/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Falling Down</a>, a film with a similar repressed male character, shot in a completely different style.",1203552000,3,2782,5.99746835443038
3026081,5,B000YDBP3O,"I don't know that I've ever seen an actor's performance hailed as implosive (as opposed to explosive), but I think Variety really nailed it on the head when they used that word to describe Christian Slater's performance in this film.  Elisha Cuthbert doesn't exactly embarrass herself, either, in a fairly challenging role opposite the most uncommon of film protagonists.  I can't truly say that I love He Was a Quiet Man just because it's such a dark, somber, and somewhat confusing film, but I can say that I consider this to be a fantastic movie.

Slater plays Bob Maconel, a meek and generally submissive cubicle dweller with a real jerk of a boss who is constantly bullying and belittling him.  It's pretty easy to see why Bob fantasizes about blowing up the building or making his tormentors pay dearly for their abusive attitudes and actions toward him.  Unfortunately for Bob, fantasy and reality have started to bleed in to one another.  When we first meet him, he is assigning targets for each bullet he loads into a handgun, then struggling to work up the courage to put his plans into action.  On that occasion, though, the timing just isn't right, as he explains to his pet fish (with whom he has several conversations throughout the film) when he returns to his rather ramshackle home that night.  This theme of living life in a fishbowl is further brought home by a lot of up close and personal camera shots of Bob with a fishbowl-like lens and some great shots of Bob plodding along while everyone around him zooms along at a much faster pace.  The only small breath of fresh air in Bob's world of quiet desperation is co-worker Venessa Parks (Elisha Cuthbert).  She is the only person who ever speaks to him without a trace of malice.  A kind smile and a small comment here or there don't seem like much, but it means the world to Bob.

Then Bob's life changes dramatically, catapulting him from would-be mass murderer to hero.  As he is loading his gun and once again trying to work up the courage to execute his own murderous plans, he drops the last bullet (the one meant for himself - gotta love the symbolism), and while he is under his desk trying to retrieve it, the guy in the next cubicle steals his thunder, so to speak.  After exchanging some ""how did it feel?"" notes with the guy, Bob acts to save the life of Venessa, becoming a hero in the process.  All of the sudden, he is given a cushy vice president job upstairs, his former tormentors become all buddy-buddy with him, and everyone is suddenly nice to him - everyone but Venessa, whose life has undergone even more drastic changes than Bob's as a result of her injury.  When she demands one favor from him, Bob feels he has no choice but to reluctantly agree.  And so begins a journey of two lost souls depending upon one another for survival.

If you're expecting some kind of fairy tale ending, you can forget about that right now.  Don't expect the story to come wrapped up with a pretty little bow, either; in fact, don't even read too much into my limited plot summary.  This is definitely one of those ""what the --?  So what the heck actually happened?"" kinds of films - except this film succeeds magnificently where so many others fall flat on their faces.  Writer/director Frank A. Cappello has given us the most impressive and intelligent film I have come across in quite a while.  There is symbolism buried all through the movie, all but begging viewers to watch the whole thing time and again.  And guess what?  The alternate ending included in the deleted scenes available on the DVD is, to my way of thinking, even more powerful and moving than the original ending - and then you have the director's commentary to further satisfy your craving for additional insight.  20 or 30 years from now, He Was a Quiet Man is one of the films we'll point to when we say ""they don't make `em like this anymore.""",1203552000,4,3897,4.563218390804598
3026082,4,B000YDBP3O,"I actually quite liked this movie. It reminded me of the movie 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' with its storyline, or to 'Mulholland Drive' with its twists.

The story leads us to reminisce about the many quiet co-workers we've encountered throughout our careers and leaves us to question what has gone through their minds (i.e. could they have gone postal?). The movie digs into the needs of every human - recognition, dreams, achievements, and succeeds with its message through the performance of its actors. My hat is off to Christian Slater. He is exceptional at portraying the confusion, the dynamics and the sickness of the main character's mind.
I recommend this movie to those who like unconventional storylines and to fans of movie characters with depth.",1203552000,,771,5.070866141732283

Then he goes on to (inadequately) explain what sets his particular version apart.  His rationalizations, and the remarkably artful clues that brim throughout the movie, do little to soften the blow.  Most viewers are bound to feel cheated.

The good news is that, although the conclusion is of the cheap-variety, the movie that precedes it is captivating (and intelligent) enough to (mostly) make up for it.  The film follows office drone Bob Maconel as he desperately tries to hold on to all of his marbles.  Played marvelously by a hardly-recognizable Christian Slater, Bob is about to go on your run-of-the-mill killing spree when an amazing thing happens: someone else goes on a killing spree first.  Bob, gun in hand, stops the murderer, and instead of being the psychopath in his life's grim tale, Bob is thrust into the unlikely position of Hero.

Bob is suddenly fast-tracked into the upper echelons of corporate life.  The office sexpot starts making moves on him.  And the alpha males that once mocked him are now schmoozing up to him every chance they get.  Bob's life, once a mural of insignificance, has become a charade of chivalry.  Bob tries to live up to his new heroic image, but something's awry.  The world he once loathed -- the masks and mockery -- is now a part of him.  It doesn't sit well.

The one thing that does sit well is Vanessa Parks, a beautiful young co-worker that was paralyzed from the neck down during the shootings.  Bob takes her under his wing, and it is her helpless need and love that really injects meaning into his once futile existence.  But Bob's new life, just like his old one, doesn't stay put together for long.

Exactly what's wrong is hinted at with some sumptuous and masterful directing.  Dreams, background news shows, calendars, scribbled notes, broken hula figurines, and gray Rubik's cubes: keep your eyes open, and you'll be able to trace the fissures in Bob's life to their inevitable conclusion.  It may be a well-trod path that the film treads, but it treads it well.

Ultimately, the best part of the movie is how it takes an old question and turns it around.  People often wonder why anyone -- teens in trenchcoats, demoralized office oafs -- go nuts and start killing people, but this movie seems to wonder why the rest of us don't follow suit.  What keeps us sane, anyway?  Why aren't we all as unhinged as poor, poor Bob?

The disc contains several alternate endings, most of which work in equal measure, although the ""LIFE SAVER"" ending I found to be the most poignant.  In any case, the movie's answers aren't nearly as captivating as its well-phrased questions, questions that are delivered with a darkly comic spin.  The finale may arouse some disappointment, but it will also arouse discussion.  He may be a quiet man, but he still has a lot to say.",1203552000,2,3519,5.638783269961977
3026084,3,B000YDBP3O,"I was not quite sure what to expect with Frank A. Cappello's movie He Was A Quiet One. The story is about a depressed, nerdy employee named Bob Maconel (played by Christian Slater). In a bizarre turn of events, Bob accidentally becomes a hero, by stopping a crazed gunman in his office. The other main character is a woman named Venessa (played by Elisha Cuthbert) who is shot and left paralyzed from the neck down. The film also stars William H. Macy as Bob's boss after he is promoted to a high level position as a reward for his heroism.

The acting in this film is fairly good, particularly Christian Slater. The cinematography is also good, and there are even a few special effects. This is a fairly dark film, and left me feeling very depressed and dissatisfied.",1203552000,,768,4.565217391304348
3026085,2,B000YDBP3O,"In the Twilight Zone episode, ""An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge,"" a man miraculously escapes death but discovers that his mind has played a cruel trick on him.  Much the same appears to occur in ""He Was a Quiet Man,"" starring Christian Slater, Elisha Cuthbert, and William H. Macy.  Unfortunately, this modern take on a classic story won't stand the test of time.

Picture Bob Maconel as a thinner, angrier, and slightly more articulate version of Milton from the movie ""Office Space.""  Behind the pulled shades of his dank home Bob shows Son-of-Sam potential during animated discussions with a foul-mouthed goldfish, and the highlight of his lunch break is mentally blowing up his massive office building with a twisted version of the ""Easy"" button.  Living in a fantasy world and fuming over life's injustices, he plans to exact revenge on his workplace tormentors.

But right before go-time, something happens that transforms him from wacko to hero.  He gets his 15 minutes of media fame, gains a promotion, and former antagonists become friends and colleagues.  Even the beautiful but aloof coworker he loved from afar begins to return his affection.  It looks like Bob finally gets everything good he ever wanted.  So, why can't he relax and enjoy his new and improved life?  It seems that Bob is the kind of guy who isn't happy unless he's miserable.  Sadly, but predictably, his new house of cards begins to crumble, and events hurtle toward another violent climax.  Or do they?

When the credits roll, we are left to ask: What the heck just happened?  Was it all a pipe dream, concocted by a feverish soul grasping for redemption in the last possible instant before disaster?  Or was Bob on an irredeemable fast track to meltdown despite having the good life handed to him on a silver platter?  Either way, it left a bad taste in my mouth.  We see the cracks forming in Bob's shiny new world, and dismay builds when they enlarge.  Watching Bob take the road less traveled is like watching a train wreck in increments.  Indeed, perhaps it was the filmmaker's intent to show that some people are simply FUBAR, no matter what.

Still, I hoped for a more redemptive angle vs. what actually played out in ""He Was a Quiet Man.""  That's not to say I don't like downer movies now and then.  I've enjoyed well-made bummer-fests like ""The Remains of the Day"" and ""One Hour Photo.""  Sometimes it's fun to go to a dark place cinematically in order to see how good we actually have it, or vicariously feel the emotions of characters whose hopes are dashed.  But it's way too easy to take the prototypical office sad sack and make him, well, sad.  I'd rather see more positive themes played out in the too-familiar office milieu - repressed butlers and Robin Williams are far removed from my workplace (well, more or less).  Therefore I can't really recommend ""He Was a Quiet Man.""

As for the nuts-and-bolts stuff, the DVD doesn't come with many extras.  There's a small ""making of"" featurette where the filmmakers exult over crafting the movie on a shoestring budget and actually getting the starring actors, who are the best part of the movie.  Mr. Slater does a good job as the tightly-wound nebbish that is Bob Maconel, Ms. Cuthbert gives a layered performance as the ambitious secretary with a luminous smile, and William H. Macy could've played the boss role in his sleep.  As for the commentary - well, I didn't want to sit through this movie again, because once was enough.  Bottom line, if you're looking for a downer movie, skip ""He Was a Quiet Man"" and check out the flicks I named in the previous paragraph - or take a detour to the darker parts of ""The Twilight Zone.""",1203379200,3,3677,4.714733542319749

Slater is nearly perfect as Bob the maligned, ignored, nearly invisible cube dweller of yet another anonymous, overly bloated corporation. Elisha Cuthbert delivers a surprisingly fine performance as the beautiful Vanessa with the deceptive smile. And, of course, William H. Macy is his usual awesome self as Mr. Shelby, the smooth talking, double-crossing boss. Bob also has his goldfish who serve as his mirror and conscience. He has the golden boys at work who gleefully bully him and then cozy up to him with his sudden fame. He has neighbors who, although they don't know him, revel in his notoriety and who ultimately deliver the infamous title line.

Cappello has written quite a good script...until the end. I'll avoid spoilers here and say only that the extra features helped to explain why this ending was chosen over the original one that would have worked so much better. This movie would be almost perfect with a different ending, but ends up being a bit confusing as a result of what seems to be a rushed bit of punctuation for the overall story. Fortunately, the rest of the story is so dark and captivating, that the ending, although bothersome, does not ruin the movie.

I'm very glad I stumbled across this movie, and I've already recommended it to quite a few people. This is the type of movie that is meant to encourage discussion and possibly some debate.

Keep the brown hair, she looks so hot as a brunette.  The extras include, a commentary, a featurette on the making of the film and deleted scenes (including the orinial ending whic I preffered).

My biggest mistake was expecting Mr. Slater to play the kind of comical role he's always played in the movies I've seen.  This movie is a fascinating look at the life of a schizophrenic man and how he sees the world around him.

Honestly I almost turned this movie off about 10 minutes into it simply because it seemed so bizarre but the longer I watched the more fascinating I found it.  With so many people 'losing it' and gunning down coworkers, fellow students, families, etc, this is a movie that not only provides an intriguing entertaining couple of hours but makes you think about the people around you and how they act or even how you treat them.",1202947200,,754,4.522058823529412
3026089,5,B000YDBP3O,"This is Christian Slater like you have never seen him before. The DVD jacket says that his performance is ""fearless,"" and that is exactly right. No Hollywood pretty boy in this film (not that he is, anyway), but he deliberately took his characterization to a level where he is almost unpleasant to look at. Then with the director's use of distorting lenses and extreme close-ups, Slater's quirky, odd-man character is accentuated even more. It would be interesting to find out if he was emulating someone he knows.

Bill Macy's character wasn't much of a stretch for him; we've seen it before. Still, Macy is always fun to watch on the screen.

Elisha Cuthbert did a wonderful job running the full spectrum of emotions. She did a marvelous job `limping out' her body in her portrayal of a quadriplegic.

Lots of surprises in this film.

3026090,4,B000YDBP3O,"I wasn't quite sure what to think of this film when first requesting it. It was going to be an independent film, which means it would not be your typically Hollywood production.

Our disillusioned protagonist begins to look like a character from the move we all know to well, ""Office Space"". Nevertheless, the movie soon turns to more of a drama then a comedy one would want to laugh about. Though the movie still portrays that certain stereotype of corporate America with the cubicled employees and the higher ups in their beautiful offices, the movie still leaves the viewer with many surprises. The viewer is often left wondering what is happening is real or a dream of the protagonist (or another character), which adds additional suspense to the plot when the violence erupts. Bits of comedy are then intertwined once again, nevertheless, the film retains its dark and tone of disillusionment.

If you like surprises, a bit of mystery, and a bit of humor, this might be the film for you. It's not going to be the next Office Space, nevertheless, but it will keep you wanting to the see the end.",1202774400,,1099,4.71875

I have always like Christian Slater, and when I watched the preview for He Was a Quiet Man, I was amazed with how he looked in this film. From the balding to the chipped tooth, it is a physical transformation only topped by his performance. With this role, Slater joins fellow cast member William Macy in the pantheon of great character actors.

Elisha Cuthbert was an unknown to me, and after this film, I want to see much more of her. She showed a range of emotions in this movie that was both refreshing and inspiring.

I don't want to give too much of the plot away, but I will say there were many places in this film where it could have gone one way, but didn't. It never takes the easy or expected path, rather going down a dark and somewhat twisted one.

Christian Slater reminded me, in his transformation in this film, to Michael Douglas in Falling Down. In fact, both films left me in a similar state after watching them for the first time.

His inability to function, even when events go his way, is always present.  As his courtship of a paralyzed coworker progresses his life seems to be improving but he cannot escape his delusions and paranoia and self hatred.  There are comic elements to this movie, but Bob Malconel's self destruction isn't one of them.

But even Venessa quickly comes around when she discovers a glimmer of hope for the future. She and Bob become an unusual item, and Bob is suddenly in suburban paradise, but for how long? If Bob was disturbed enough to be planning a murderous rampage in the beginning, could Venessa's attention really be an instant cure? Or is it even real?

A dreamlike masterpiece from writer/director Frank A. Cappello, ""He Was a Quiet Man"" takes viewers on a mental dark ride through the thoughts of a madman teetering on the brink. Bizarre visuals that mix fantasy with reality will keep you unsure of everything you're seeing. The knowledge that Bob is a ticking timebomb will keep you on the edge of your seat, and the end result will leave you contemplating the film and its ideas for some time after. Make-up and an amazing performance make Christian Slater as Bob absolutely unrecognizable and highly award worthy. Elisha Cuthbert is no less remarkable in her role as the beautiful but perplexing Venessa, and William H. Macy is as flawless as ever as their sleazy boss.

The film's twist ending is sure to leave most viewers a bit bewildered, but if you can't stand having to figure things out for yourself, you need only explore the DVD's bonus features for understanding. There are deleted and alternate scenes, a trailer, a behind the scenes look, and director commentaries. The main extras, of course, are those director's commentaries over the film and the deleted scenes/alternate endings. These will answer most of your questions about vague things that were seen in the film, though they also may leave some viewers confused or disagreeing with the director's overall feelings on the subject matter. His stance seems to be that the problems of society are not the bullies and such, but the disturbed people they create. I would have to say that both are a problem. The suggested cure, ""thinning the herd"" by weeding out the dangerously disturbed victims of bullying and neglect, is important, but it doesn't strike at the source of the problem. What is needed is a non-violent answer to dealing with not only the potentially dangerous nuts, but the more socially-accepted nuts that create them as well. But, hey, that's just some of the debate this film inspires. One could also spend hours contemplating the symbolism, what is real and what is in Bob's mind, and if any of the alternate endings would have been preferred (I rather liked the last one). All in all, this film is a must see at the very least. The DVD is excellent and presents the film in a beautiful anamorphic widescreen format.",1202774400,4,2894,4.809236947791165
3026094,2,B000YDBP3O,"Proceed with caution if you don't have a taste for macabre, pitch-black humor.  That said, if you like dark - somewhat twisted - subject matter, then I recommend ""He Was a Quiet Man.""  Not without reservation, I have to add, because while there are interesting ideas presented here - this movie ends up being a bit puzzling.  I found the conclusion highly unsatisfying.

The description on the DVD case says this movie is sort of a hybrid of ""Office Space"" and ""Taxi Driver.""  That's actually pretty accurate, but the problem is, the movie isn't as good as either of those.  A movie like ""Taxi Driver"" doesn't need to advertise it's influences - it's a unique movie that stands completely on it's own.  More often than not, when a movie touts itself as being a cross between ""movie x"" and ""movie y,"" the end result doesn't live up to the predecessors it borrowed from.

I found the central theme presented by the movie to be a disturbing and a bit distasteful.  Bob (played by Christian Slater) is such a social incompetant that he would actually prefer his girlfriend to be physically disabled so she will rely on him.  Bob has struck out with women so many times, when given the opportunity to begin a relationship with a newly quadriplegic co-worker (played by Elisha Cuthbert) he embraces it wholeheartedly.  Problem is, there is little substance to their relationship other than Vanessa's need to be cared for.  This is fine for Bob, after all he obviously doesn't care about whether they actually love each other as long as she needs him to provide for her.  In Bob's mind, this is the perfect set-up:  he can control the relationship entirely, and also prop up his own self-esteem by reminding himself what a ""good deed"" he is doing.  It's all a bit sick, quite frankly.  Not that Bob is having this relationship - but rather the reasons why.

None of this ends up mattering much anyway, because the ""twist"" ending is a cop-out that pretty much negates everything that preceeded it.  It is simply bad storytelling.  I can't explain why exactly, and that is for two reasons: 1) I don't want to ruin any surprises for anyone, 2) I actually still don't quite understand why the intent was.  The ending is muddled, to say the least.

This really would have been a one-star review, but I do have to note that Christian Slater is very effective in the lead role.  As many reviewers have said, this is quite unlike the commonly known Christian Slater persona.  It's worth seeing mainly for his performance.  To a lesser degree, but still noteworthy, Elisha Cuthbert does good work in an underwritten role.",1202688000,,2605,4.699779249448124
3026095,3,B000YDBP3O,"After watching the film, ""He Was A Quiet Man"", my summary of the film would read something along the lines of, ""A sad, and at times beautiful, haunted little vision of the world.""

However after some reflection and wading through the sparse EXTRAS section of the DVD, watching the alternate endings and listening to the director's commentary track, my summary now reads, ""A fine forum to showcase Christian Slater's talents.  Though one wonders why he did not choose to release it in the confines of a film that focused on form over function.""

The ending of the film feels tacked on...and with good reason.  It was, to paraphrase the director, ""not how the film originally ended but how the film should of ended being nearer in spirit to the original draft of the screen play.""

What?

There is nothing wrong with a little rewrite. To say that the ending was telegraphed does a disservice to the years of fine work the telegraph has done as means of mass communication.  All the good will the movie has built up with clever uses of FX, the fine work of the aforementioned Mr. Slater, and a cast of slightly underused supporting players (and let us not forget a talking fish - who doesn't like talking fish?), all this is washed away in the last 10 minutes of the film.  The last line of dialogue uttered by Mr. Slater is, ""There comes a time when the diseased and the weak must be sacrificed in order to save the herd."" Well that's just dandy, thank you very much I'll take my molotov cocktail and cyanide capsule now, please.

Now, I love a little existential angst as  much as the next woman but a movie that dares to brandish the quote, ""Like the bastard child of Brazil, Fight Club and Amelie..."" on its DVD box-cover better bring the goods in one of the areas of at least ONE of those films. Quirky romance, dystopian visions of a society where man is reduced to drone, cinematography that either screams ""LOOK AT ME, MY COLORS FLY OFF THE SCREEN"" or ""DON'T LOOK AT ME MY COLOR PALETTE IS DRAB AND MUTED, SO COOL, SO UNDERSTATED"" or at the very least have a script with enough verve and panache that I'm willing to overlook the huge leaps of logic it takes for Tyler Durden, Brad Pitt and Edward Norton to all be dancing on the same psychological ID card. Unfortunately somewhere along the way, ""Quiet Man"" becomes as unhinged as it's protagonist and never really measures up in any of these categories.

For film geeks, the 10 minute featurette on the making of the film does give a good, if short glimpse of the interior works of a low budget film. The commentary track with the director, Frank Cappello, tends to lean towards the anecdotal as opposed to the informative, though a few low-budget tips can be gleaned for those willing to give their hard earned free time to listening to it.",1202515200,4,2797,4.540755467196819
3026096,4,B000YDBP3O,"Count me as one of those that really admire (most) of this film.

My disappointments:  I don't like the fire hose volume of profanity and don't believe it represents real life as much as those justifying it want to pretend it does.  And there is one rather disturbing sex scene that could have been handled differently to make the same point.  These kinds of scenes aren't ""real"" and certainly can't compete with movies made to arouse.  So, why have them?

Christian Slater is terrific as the deeply disturbed Bob Maconel.  He is a cipher and used as an office whipping boy by a couple of low-level low-quality bullies passing for managers.  Like many office drones, he dreams about a woman at the office.  His dreamgirl is named Vanessa who notices the ceramic bobble hula girl he keeps on his cubicle, but she is too absorbed in her blazing rocket of a career to even pay attention to real people in anything but a passing manner.  But she has a smile that lights up a room, as the movie keeps noting.

Bob takes his lunch on a spot where he has a view of the company skyscraper and has a little plastic box with a button so he can fantasize blowing the building to kingdom come.  More disturbingly, he has a real gun with real bullets that he ritualistically loads by naming who each bullet is for.  But he hasn't been able to bring himself to pull the trigger.  During one performance of his rite he drops a bullet and while he is on the floor a gun is fired and people start dropping while others scream.  An old man has carried out Bob's fantasy and they strike up a conversation that ends up with Bob emptying his gun in the old man.

The rest of the movie teases out how Bob is treated as a hero, is promoted, and his connection with Vanessa who was made a quadriplegic in the shooting (the shooter thought she was someone else).  So, Bob has this secret that others approach but no one will really confront.  Even the company shrink appears only to be be circling the core issues.

William H. Macy plays the CEO, Gene Shelby.  Vanessa was an up and coming VP who reported directly to him and their relationship combined the very personal with the professional.  Gene isn't really a bad guy, but just a ordinarily flawed guy running a company.  Others project their own fantasies and frustrations onto him and that is a quite realistic aspect of the film.  One funny aspect of the film is that Gene's desk is made up of multiple tables that are, together, somewhat larger than Rhode Island.

The way the movie is filmed handles the madness and melting realities very well.  I had not seen these kinds of visual symbols before and thought they were quite effective.

Why some call this a comedy or a black comedy is beyond me.  Yes, there are some comic moments, but the overall intent of the movie is serious.  True, Bob carries on mutual conversations with his goldfish, but what do you expect such an isolated man who has drifted into madness to do?

I think this is a very effective movie and recommend it for the right audience (keeping my caveats in mind).  For me, it was a Christian Slater tour-de-force.

3026097,4,B000YDBP3O,"HE WAS A QUIET MAN echoes the all too familiar news item of irrational killings in public places - here, in this country, by seemingly 'normal indistinguishable people'. Writer/director Frank A. Cappello has a good grasp on his subject matter and probably intended the rather slow movement of the film to underline the 'ordinary' situations that in a flash become extraordinary.  And he has a fine cast to demonstrate his thoughts.

Bob Maconel (Christian Slater in fine distorting makeup) is a nerd, an ordinary geek who checks numbers form his sterile cubicle in a massive corporation, heckled  by the 'fast guys' like Scott Harper (Jamison Jones).  He loathes his life, his crumby house and unkempt lawn, and most of all the loathes the people with whom he works - except for one Vanessa (Elisha Cuthbert) who has a 'smile that lights up a room', but pays no attention to the geeky Bob. Bob is deranged, talks to his goldfish at home (and they answer back!), and plans to kill the most offensive of his fellow workers.  But in the adjacent cubicle there is a like mind who beats him to the show and one morning opens fire killing five people and wounding Vanessa with a bullet to her spine that leaves her paralyzed: Bob serendipitously uses his own gun to kill the assailant and becomes a hero for the corporation.

Though Bob is unchanged in appearance or outlook he is elevated to VP of Creative Thinking under the head boss Gene Shelby (William H. Macy).  He visits Vanessa in the hospital, suffers her tantrum at being a quadriplegic, but finally is called back to her bedside and sweet-talked into being her hero life-saving guardian - and more.  Once Bob feels needed and perhaps 'loved' by Vanessa he begins to change, only to have unfortunate reminders of reality enter and alter his life yet again.

Though the subject matter is rather terrifying, Cappello elects to present this tale as black humor.  In the hands of less competent actors it would like have been a dud, but with Christian Slater's finely nuanced performance the film takes on a powerful sheen.  The line between madness and normalcy is a thin one indeed and there are many disturbing lessons to be gained from watching this small but well-done film.

Then one day, someone else beats him to it...and that someone else wounds the one person Maconel actually liked in the office. Maconel shoots his ""postal"" co-worker and becomes a hero.

Stop after this paragraph if you want to totally avoid spoilers. It is definitely good enough to warrant a look especially if you are a Slater fan or a big fan of the movie ""Brazil."" This is good work (by the actors) with some dark laughs.

I can definitely see why some are confused by the ending. I don't believe it was set up well enough by the script. It's obvious from the talking goldfish and hummingbirds that we are in Maconel's fantasy world...it's just not clear when we entered it.

Slater did do a very nice job here as did the rest of the cast, but the script needed one more draft before shooting. The similarities to ""Brazil"" down to the music are also a little uncomfortable. It is not startlingly original, but it is a solid enough three stars.",1202083200,,1335,4.332
3026099,4,B000YDBP3O,"What if Milton from ""Office Space"" decided to go postal, planned it out and brought a gun to the office?  What if another cubicle drone beat him to the punch?  That is the basic set up for ""He Was a Quiet Man.""  The put-upon office jockey, Bob Maconel, is played by Christian Slater, in a bravura performance.  Maconel seems to have a tenuous grasp on reality, and much of the film has a dream-like/hallucinogenic quality to it, including substantial 2-way dialogue with the fish in his fishtank.

At the beginning of the film, Maconel is clearly at the end of his rope.  In the first of several unexpected developments (I won't spoil the others), just as Maconel is getting ready to open fire on his tormentors, the guy one cubicle over beats him to it, shoots several co-workers and badly wounds the office cutie (Elisha Cuthbert).  As it plays out, instead of the stressed-out psycho, Maconel  is hailed as the take-charge hero who saved the office from an even worse bloodbath.

From this set-up, numerous unpredictable options become possible.  How is Bob viewed by others after his ""heroics?""  How does Bob handle the huge upgrade in status, and settle into a thoroughly unfamiliar role within the company?  Does his instability and loneliness get better or worse?  And how about the ladies -- does he get the girl ... any girl?

Perhaps the greatest pleasures in movies are presented by the well-told, gratifying albeit predictable story arc, mysteries where you generally know what happened but not who was responsible, and the rare flick in which you really don't know where they will take you but the ride is enjoyable in part due to the total unpredictability.  ""Quiet Man"" is firmly in the latter category, and to me was the most utterly unpredictable movie I've seen since ""Being John Malkovich.""

Is it just me, or are we in a reverse-golden age of too many movies with bad, bad endings?  The ending on this one, without spoiling anything, is one that has been done before, and has never been found satisfactory.  It does not negate the rest of the film, but ... oh, I'll just leave it at that.

When, as the result of an accident, he becomes a hero instead of a murderer, his life changes radically, and he starts a relationship with a co-worker who before seemed way out of his league. But outside changes cannot change who Maconel is, and his transformation is threatened by reality.

He Was a Quiet Man deals with serious, and even tragic, issues, but does it so skillfully and tastefully, that the movie is compelling and on occasion even funny. Christian Slater is simply brilliant as Maconel, and the supporting cast is equally great.

3026102,3,B000YDBP3O,"Starring Christian Slater as Bob Maconel, `He was a quiet man' tells the story of an office employee who owns a gun and secretly desires to kill his coworkers. The movie is an interesting drama about Maconel's life suddenly giving a twist for good that could end up making him a different person, as the story unfolds Elisha Cuthbert's character and Slater's crash into an ending that pretends to be dramatic, but that builds up so much that when you see it you expect what happens.

Prior credits of writer/director/producer Frank Capello include the writing of the screenplay for `Constantine'. Being this his debut film it is understandable that he loaded it with all the techniques he liked and wanted to use. The technical aspect of the film does not present any innovative ideas, some of the effects used are the Snorricam (an apparatus strapping a camera to an actor, a trademark of director Darren Aronofsky in `Pi' and `Requiem for a dream') as well as the CGI shots going into small places (there is a shot in which the camera goes inside an ear of Slater's character that you can't help to compare to the initial gun shot of David Fincher's `Fight Club') Another thing to note is that this low budget movie uses lots of CGI effects, most of them looking so unrealistic that end up distracting the viewer from what's happening to the characters.

The music is in charge of Jeff Beal (who composed the music for `Rome' and `Carnivale'); after his work in the HBO series `Rome' I expected something original, the music is clearly influenced by the Dust Brothers' job for `Fight Club'.

After watching the film I was wondering why people were comparing this to other films such as `Fight Club' or `Amelie', as this film has nothing to do being compared to the mentioned movies. In the `first look documentary' included there is a moment in which director Frank Capello (in a moment of arrogance) claims his movie is an ""Amelie meets Fight Club"" story. I still don't see what the reference might be but please don't fall for it as this movie is nothing close to any of the two mentioned.

Extras are a few, some deleted scenes that do not add anything to the story (which explains why they were removed) and a 10 minute length featurette called `First look at He was a quiet man'. Audio is mastered both in 5.1 and 2.0 with no subtitles (not even in English, though it is close captioned).

An entertaining film with average performances by the actors (I believe William H. Macy was wasted in this film), a simpler way to describe this film would be `the serious version of Office Space'.",1201651200,,2594,4.642701525054466
3026103,3,B000YDBP3O,"He was a Quiet Man stars Christian Slater, William F Macy and Elisha Cuthbert.

He was a Quiet Man tells the story of Bob.  Bob is a nebbish of an office drone, who has two way conversations with his fish, is generally put upon by all around him, and leads what can charitably be described as a pathetic and pitiable existence. His life is a mess, and he has fantasies about shooting his co-workers and himself.

As you might expect, being such a nebbish, Bob lacks the guts to actually accomplish his plan.  On yet another day when Bob is pushed around, another co-worker's rampage provides Bob the unexpected opportunity to be a hero...

So begins ""He was a Quiet Man"", a movie which is a compound of motifs and other movies in an uneasy jumble.  Despite an unlikeable protagonist, Slater's performance is very unlike most of his previous characters. We do get a sense of just how put upon Bob is in his life.  Elisha Cuthbert, William F Macy and the minor actors in the movie do decent jobs.

Still, the movie isn't cohesive.  Talking fish, a nebbish protagonist, and strands of several plots just don't add up to a whole. It feels like pieces of several movies put together.

The ending of the movie is an twist which causes you to re-frame most of the events seen.  It doesn't feel like a cheat, however, and given what we had seen of Bob, it fits in with his personality.  It does bring the movie together somewhat in the denouement.

He was a quiet Man is an alright movie. The parts don't jell together as well as they might, but its a okay night's viewing.",1201564800,,1565,4.4491228070175435

At lunch, he sits outide atop an ugly concrete slab and stares across at the giant monolith that is his office building. He dreams of blowing it up. At night, Bob returns to his murky home, trudging through the weeds in the yard. He sits in front of the tube, and readies a yummy TV-dinner. Life is so good that he talks to his fish(Life is so good that they talk back to him!).  But Bob has had enough. One day, sitting in his cubicle, Bob loads six rounds into his 38-special. Damn. One bullet falls on the floor.  Bob gets down to retrieve it, but wait...Someone is just about to beat him to the punch...... ""He Was a Quiet Man"" is the fast-paced, often humorous effort of director Frank Cappello.  Ancor Bay's new DVD transfer is in the original Aspect Ratio 1.78:1, and features the director's commentary, the trailer, Alternate and Deleted Scenes,and the featurette ""First Look At He Was a Quiet Man"".  The anamorphic dual-layered DVD is progressively transferred on almost 7 Gig of space. Colors are true and detail is sharp. Christian Slater is very good as Bob. ""He Was a Quiet Man""'s nightmare is enhanced by Slater's performance, which is surely on of his best. William H. Macy co-stars as Gene. Macy appeared in his first film in 1980. He received the Award for ""Fargo"" in 1996, and played a sleazy cameraman in 1997's ""Boogie Nights"".  The writer and director of ""He Was a Quiet Man"", Frank Cappello, may have something to prove, after writting Hulk Hogan's ""Suburban Commando"", and directing the quirky ""Constantine"". He's so much better here. This is not a great film, but it does contain some great moments. A fool once said that: ""Good movies reflect the truths of our lives"". I don't know about that.  Orson Welles said it best: ""The trees of the cinema comprise the forest of life"".",1201564800,,1945,4.620289855072464
3026105,4,B000YDBP3O,"Without giving away the ending, this film does feel very contrived throughout, but it's all leading to a thought provoking and somewhat fulfilling conclusion.  Along the way, we get powerful performances from Christian Slater, and Elisha Cuthbert, that tend to take our mind off the absurdity of some of the plot intricacies, which include Slater interacting with digitally altered goldfish and hummingbirds; many over the top, stereotypical supporting characters; and seemingly unrealistic and out of place props within the sets.  The pacing of the film moves along at just a steady enough speed for us to go with the flow of what's being presented, and not become caught up with whether the characters' actions are plausible.  It will all make sense once the credits roll.

Bob Maconel is the geeky loner played by Slater, and it's easily one of the best performances of his career.  In many films, this type of character would receive some sort of pity from the audience, and a degree of likability, but not in Slater's case.  I believe it was the film's intention to not have this person gain any acceptance, and Slater pulls this aspect of the character off to a tee.  He remains the secluded, picked on office worker with suicidal and homicidal tendencies, without ever becoming anything more.

Supporting roles are minimal, with the most noteworthy being William H. Macy in prime form as Slater and Cuthbert's boss.  The cinematography is crisp and many daylight and well lit scenes pull away from the dark tones of the film, and lead viewers away from any dreary feeling a story like this could convey.

Overall, it's a very entertaining and unique twist on such oft covered plots such as the picked on office worker snapping, the nerd obsessing over the prom queen, and the question of pulling the plug on a quadriplegic.  It's depressing topics covered in a rather entertaining way, with a very suprising turn from a veteran actor who has never quite been taken seriously throughout his career.

There's two alternate endings in the special features section, with both of them running along nearly the same path of events as the original ending, but taking very abrupt and different turns right before the fade to credits.  It's amazing that any of the other two could have been dropped in without taking much impact away from the entire movie.  It really shows the strength of this 4 star film.",1201564800,3,2405,4.891625615763547

This is part ""black-comedy"", part drama, part ridiculing some of the ""phonies"" in life that we all secretly despise, and even includes a ""TALKING GOLDFISH"" with perhaps the best line in the movie. It's true this film has a core setting much like OFFICE SPACE but the absolutely tremendous acting performance by Christian Slater creates some very real touching moments in the midst of the surreal bizarre story lines. A great acting job includes more ingredients than just dialogue. If you pay attention to the nuanced facial expressions that embody Christian's work I believe you will be very impressed. Elisha Cuthbert also shows her acting chops with most of her screen time spent in a wheel chair. There is also some unique attention grabbing camera work that adds to the gleam of a well-made movie.

3026107,5,B000YDBP3O,"After seeing the WEATHERMAN some time back, I did not think I would see a depressing film with a ""message"" in a short amount of time.
The Production Values on HE WAS A QUIET MAN are quite high, but then so were the production values on WEATHERMAN. Much of the work is crossed with FX work done by the Director. This comes out especially in the fact that there are 3 endings  made for the film. One of the endings was done entirely by the director. The ability to do this was basically  because  of the digital cameras. This also gave rise to the production problem that no-one saw Dailies, since none were available, the film was done and seen  in post production.
 The director says, in the DVD  extras, that this film  is about ""looking for a way out"" of his difficult situation in cubicle hell. In the process of doing this ( whether in dream or in real life, especially if you see ending Number 3 which supports the Dream view of the film) part of the extras show that his ( Christian Slaters Character) has the love for the girl (Elisha Cuthbert) to keep him breaking down.
 In the extras, the director states that his message is that those people in these situations, should, if they don't want to be here in this world, then they should take themselves out and not take anyone else out.
This view is highly debateable, and to say the least controversial, and it is what the director wants.
 Slater delivers the goods in this film, as does William Macy, and the Director breaks many ""rules"" in making the film. It certainly was a Make it or die style of film production.
 In a linear story sense, the film goes from negative to positive, and then back again; so in that respect it is different to the WEATHERMAN, but the tone still varies greatly, and has a weighty depressive tone, and as the writer-director says, he pulls people in unexpected diections. This is definitely a film that falls into the ""teach
me a lesson"" sort of film. Listen to the Directors commentary, and see the three endings, this will give a wider view of a film with a lot of depth, even though the depth might be turgid and murky",1201305600,2,2112,4.420103092783505

This film is none other than HE WAS A QUIET man which stars a very different and withheld Christian Slater in the role of an office and societal recluse whom fanatsizes about revenge, but when faced with his macabre fantasy seems to break free of his malicious intents and become that of a hero.

Not to be overshadowed is the riveting performance by Ms. Elisha Cuthbert whose role of the office ""looker"" turned quadriplegic demands an emotional response from it's viewer.

3260557,4,B000YDBP3O,"I had the pleasure of being invited to watch the screening of ""He Was A Quiet Man"" in LA the 15th of March at the Wilshire Fine Arts Theater. I am not a film critic therefore I can't really dissect the film and all its cinematic attributes. I can only say that the story was very cohesive and consistent. The characters were completely believable and the dialog, camera work, music, editing and special effects were first rate. The story itself is what makes this film special. I don't even want to start to recap any part of it for the readers because being a ""dark comedy"" requires fast transition from being taking down a serious and dramatic path only to be presented with dialog and/or visuals that instantaneously transition to comedy. That takes witty dialog, perfect timing in presentation and results in audience spontaneous reaction with laughter. This film does all those things and very well. Therefore, if I ""preview"" any of the film's action or twists and turns, it will utterly ruin it for you when you see it for the first time.

What this film does not do is wrap everything up in a neat package in 100 minutes. Nor do I think it is supposed to. The film and its story is very complex but not in a confusing way. What I mean is that when you walk out of the theater, the film literally continues in your head for the next 24 hours. As you will process what you saw and experienced and remember details that you might have missed or overlooked in the theater and you will experience what I call ""Ah Ha"" moments of understanding. I recommend that you see it with a friend that you can talk to about it over the next several days and compare impressions and observations with. Frank Cappello who wrote, directed, co-produced and even wrote the music for the movie has given his best work yet. The cast and crew responded in kind and created a real work of cinematic art for us to enjoy.

The cast as a whole fills the story well though everyone except Cushbert and Macy have but a passing role, however the main strength of this movie is a career renaissance for Slater in a role and look he has never quite inhabited before.

The plot is weak, which would lead me to assume the characters were the focus, but consider that not only does Slater's guy take his gun to work everyday but he only talks to his fish.  Oh yeah, and they talk to him too.  You decide.

The movie glossed over the fact that he carried a gun to work every day, almost as if society has become so accustomed to violence that this is acceptable behavior.

One day, as Bob is trying to talk himself into turning a gun on his co-workers, a fellow worker beats him to it.  But when the other man turns his gun on Vanessa, Bob's secret crush, Bob takes an action that changes both of their lives.

While the ending isn't particularly surprising, this film is worth watching for the performances alone, particularly Christian Slater's.  I'm used to Slater playing the wise-cracking self-assured hero, but he's very convincing here as the office loser with no redeeming qualities.",1207440000,2,1338,6.122994652406417
3260573,5,B000YDBP3O,"What a gem this film is! ""He Was a Quiet Man"" is an examination of the ""inner self"" in us all. How much of ourselves do we show in public? Is that hunky guy REALLY a mouse at heart? Is that gorgeous blonde REALLY a nagging shrew?

Christian Slater has finally delivered his best! He plays Bob Maconel, a bookish nerd office worker who talks to his pet fish, moving headlong into middle age with nothing to show for all his toil. Elisha Cuthbert plays a woman who works in an office upstairs, with the CEO (William H. Macy), after sleeping her way to the position she holds. While it may seem that these two have absolutely NOTHING in common, an incident in Bob's office basically brings these two together in the most unexpected way.

The relationship that developes gives Bob a new lease on life. he no longer dreams of revenge (did I say he keeps a loaded revolver in his desk?), but rather, how he can make life worth living, for both himself, and the new woman in his life. Because of the circumstances surrounding his part in the office incident, Bob is a hero! He is given an office upstairs! The job is really nothing more than a senecure, but it affords Bob a greater sense of security. Life is good! Until..........

Many have compared this film to ""Brazil"", and while it has more than just a passing similarity to it, the performances of the principle actors in this most darkest of comedies, is awards-worthy! If you want to see one of the best Indies to come out in a while, you MUST see ""He Was a Quiet Man""!!",1207008000,,1522,4.390070921985815
3260574,2,B000YDBP3O,"The first time I tried to watch ""He Was a Quiet Man,"" I had to stop after about twenty minutes. There was something about the insincerity of all the characters that I found extremely grating.

A few weeks later, I picked up where I left off and watched the rest of it, complete with all the alternative endings. I stand by my first impression. This is a quirky film about an angry office worker, named Bob, who brings a gun to work and by an unexpected set of circumstances becomes a hero instead of the villain.

There's not one character in the story that is particularly likable, except possibly Vanessa, who undergoes a life-changing experience after becoming a quadriplegic as a result of the shootings. A touching love story quickly becomes unraveled by Bob's idiosyncrasies.

I suppose if the film is setting out to portray, as a black comedy, the profile of a deeply paranoid individual, ""He Was a Quiet Man"" succeeds magnificently. There's a paranoid edge to this psychological thriller from beginning to end. If that's what you're looking for, it's quite effective.

It's just that it's not what I'm looking for when I set out to see a show. While the film is effective at what it does, I can't think of a person I'd recommend it to.",1204243200,2,1243,4.636363636363637

3260576,3,B000YDBP3O,"Poor Bob Maconel (Christian Clater) is an overworked and underpaid office worker. He lives alone and besides being stressed-out is also mentally unstable; he sees singing hummingbirds outside his kitchen window and his pet goldfish talk to him. Bob is walked over by everyone at work and becomes fed up with his life. He hates several of his coworkers and decides to do something about it. He brings a gun to work and prepares to shoot some of his colleagues. On the day that Bob decides to go through with his plan, he's beaten to the act by another coworker, ends up shooting the gunman, saves the life of the girl he loves, and becomes a hero. The girl he saves, Venessa Parks (Elisha Cuthbert), wishes she would have died because the wound she receives leaves her as a quadriplegic. She asks Bob to do something for her that could change both of their lives forever. Yet, in the world that Bob lives in, nothing is quite as it seems and everyone around him might just be using him for ulterior purposes.

HE WAS A QUIET MAN was written and directed by Frank A. Cappello. In light of the various public and school shootings that have happened in the past few years, the questions that HE WAS A QUIET MAN raises are particularly relevant, such as what causes a seemingly normal man go over the edge and take the lives of other people?, can such a person be saved?, and is there any way to stop their actions before they happen?

The overall tone, mood, and setting of the film is very minimalistic. The acting is well done, especially Christian Slater who offers one of the finest film performances of his career as the troubled Bob Maconel. Slater is typically known for playboy or bad boy roles, but is completely unrecognizable as Maconel. Also noteworthy are Elisha Cuthbert as Venessa Parks who gives a star performance by using only her face and pinky.

Even though I enjoyed the acting performances and some of the cinematography, I just found HE WAS A QUIET MAN to be an average movie. It is a decent drama with some fine acting and explores some important issues, but I just didn't find it all that compelling. It's a must-see movie for any Christian Slater or Elisha Cuthbert fans, but most others probably won't find it as compelling and may be turned off by the rather dark and bleak ending.

The DVD offers a featurette entitled ""First Look at HE WAS A QUIET MAN"", deleted scenes and alternative endings, an audio commentary with director Frank A. Cappello, and the theatrical trailer. I found the deleted scenes and alternative endings with the director's commentary to be most interesting. The film could have turned out much differently.",1203724800,2,2655,4.654584221748401

He even has a detonator in his lunch box.  His co-workers belittle or ignore him.  He eats lunch alone outside and imagines blowing up his office building.  At home, his bug-eyed goldfish tells him like it is -- and the truth is not pretty.  What's a lonely man to do?  When a tragedy takes Bob and his co-workers by surprise, Bob finds himself in a strange and demanding relationship with his long-time crush Venessa (Elisha Cuthbert.)

We see Bob's slow, steady drive toward work as other cars whiz by in a blur of colors.  Bob vanishes and reappears as he makes his way from front door to driving seat.  In a world where everything appears fractured, Bob is the only stability, even though he is far from stable himself.

Christian Slater is superb as the uptight, tortured, outwardly impassive but inwardly enraged Bob.  Elisha Cuthbert makes the transition well between ephemeral office beauty to the bitter, emotionally demanding woman she becomes, although she occasionally forces the acting just a little.  William H. Macy is properly self-absorbed, though not memorable, as their boss, Gene Shelby.

The special features are notable for the cut scenes, with commentary by director Frank Capello.  Fortunately, we are made to watch the entire film again, looking for red Xs or other signs to see these scenes in context.  Instead, Capello shows the excised snippets with the beginning of the next scene only; Capello makes it clear why the scenes were included in the original shooting and why they were eventually cut.  Most interesting is the two alternate endings, both of which are not quite as compelling as the one that made it, although one comes close.

3260578,5,B000YDBP3O,"I don't know that I've ever seen an actor's performance hailed as implosive (as opposed to explosive), but I think Variety really nailed it on the head when they used that word to describe Christian Slater's performance in this film.  Elisha Cuthbert doesn't exactly embarrass herself, either, in a fairly challenging role opposite the most uncommon of film protagonists.  I can't truly say that I love He Was a Quiet Man just because it's such a dark, somber, and somewhat confusing film, but I can say that I consider this to be a fantastic movie.

Slater plays Bob Maconel, a meek and generally submissive cubicle dweller with a real jerk of a boss who is constantly bullying and belittling him.  It's pretty easy to see why Bob fantasizes about blowing up the building or making his tormentors pay dearly for their abusive attitudes and actions toward him.  Unfortunately for Bob, fantasy and reality have started to bleed in to one another.  When we first meet him, he is assigning targets for each bullet he loads into a handgun, then struggling to work up the courage to put his plans into action.  On that occasion, though, the timing just isn't right, as he explains to his pet fish (with whom he has several conversations throughout the film) when he returns to his rather ramshackle home that night.  This theme of living life in a fishbowl is further brought home by a lot of up close and personal camera shots of Bob with a fishbowl-like lens and some great shots of Bob plodding along while everyone around him zooms along at a much faster pace.  The only small breath of fresh air in Bob's world of quiet desperation is co-worker Venessa Parks (Elisha Cuthbert).  She is the only person who ever speaks to him without a trace of malice.  A kind smile and a small comment here or there don't seem like much, but it means the world to Bob.

Then Bob's life changes dramatically, catapulting him from would-be mass murderer to hero.  As he is loading his gun and once again trying to work up the courage to execute his own murderous plans, he drops the last bullet (the one meant for himself - gotta love the symbolism), and while he is under his desk trying to retrieve it, the guy in the next cubicle steals his thunder, so to speak.  After exchanging some ""how did it feel?"" notes with the guy, Bob acts to save the life of Venessa, becoming a hero in the process.  All of the sudden, he is given a cushy vice president job upstairs, his former tormentors become all buddy-buddy with him, and everyone is suddenly nice to him - everyone but Venessa, whose life has undergone even more drastic changes than Bob's as a result of her injury.  When she demands one favor from him, Bob feels he has no choice but to reluctantly agree.  And so begins a journey of two lost souls depending upon one another for survival.

If you're expecting some kind of fairy tale ending, you can forget about that right now.  Don't expect the story to come wrapped up with a pretty little bow, either; in fact, don't even read too much into my limited plot summary.  This is definitely one of those ""what the --?  So what the heck actually happened?"" kinds of films - except this film succeeds magnificently where so many others fall flat on their faces.  Writer/director Frank A. Cappello has given us the most impressive and intelligent film I have come across in quite a while.  There is symbolism buried all through the movie, all but begging viewers to watch the whole thing time and again.  And guess what?  The alternate ending included in the deleted scenes available on the DVD is, to my way of thinking, even more powerful and moving than the original ending - and then you have the director's commentary to further satisfy your craving for additional insight.  20 or 30 years from now, He Was a Quiet Man is one of the films we'll point to when we say ""they don't make `em like this anymore.""",1203552000,4,3897,4.563218390804598

The story leads us to reminisce about the many quiet co-workers we've encountered throughout our careers and leaves us to question what has gone through their minds (i.e. could they have gone postal?). The movie digs into the needs of every human - recognition, dreams, achievements, and succeeds with its message through the performance of its actors. My hat is off to Christian Slater. He is exceptional at portraying the confusion, the dynamics and the sickness of the main character's mind.

Then he goes on to (inadequately) explain what sets his particular version apart.  His rationalizations, and the remarkably artful clues that brim throughout the movie, do little to soften the blow.  Most viewers are bound to feel cheated.

The good news is that, although the conclusion is of the cheap-variety, the movie that precedes it is captivating (and intelligent) enough to (mostly) make up for it.  The film follows office drone Bob Maconel as he desperately tries to hold on to all of his marbles.  Played marvelously by a hardly-recognizable Christian Slater, Bob is about to go on your run-of-the-mill killing spree when an amazing thing happens: someone else goes on a killing spree first.  Bob, gun in hand, stops the murderer, and instead of being the psychopath in his life's grim tale, Bob is thrust into the unlikely position of Hero.

Bob is suddenly fast-tracked into the upper echelons of corporate life.  The office sexpot starts making moves on him.  And the alpha males that once mocked him are now schmoozing up to him every chance they get.  Bob's life, once a mural of insignificance, has become a charade of chivalry.  Bob tries to live up to his new heroic image, but something's awry.  The world he once loathed -- the masks and mockery -- is now a part of him.  It doesn't sit well.

The one thing that does sit well is Vanessa Parks, a beautiful young co-worker that was paralyzed from the neck down during the shootings.  Bob takes her under his wing, and it is her helpless need and love that really injects meaning into his once futile existence.  But Bob's new life, just like his old one, doesn't stay put together for long.

Exactly what's wrong is hinted at with some sumptuous and masterful directing.  Dreams, background news shows, calendars, scribbled notes, broken hula figurines, and gray Rubik's cubes: keep your eyes open, and you'll be able to trace the fissures in Bob's life to their inevitable conclusion.  It may be a well-trod path that the film treads, but it treads it well.

Ultimately, the best part of the movie is how it takes an old question and turns it around.  People often wonder why anyone -- teens in trenchcoats, demoralized office oafs -- go nuts and start killing people, but this movie seems to wonder why the rest of us don't follow suit.  What keeps us sane, anyway?  Why aren't we all as unhinged as poor, poor Bob?

The disc contains several alternate endings, most of which work in equal measure, although the ""LIFE SAVER"" ending I found to be the most poignant.  In any case, the movie's answers aren't nearly as captivating as its well-phrased questions, questions that are delivered with a darkly comic spin.  The finale may arouse some disappointment, but it will also arouse discussion.  He may be a quiet man, but he still has a lot to say.",1203552000,2,3519,5.638783269961977

The story is about a depressed, nerdy employee named Bob Maconel (played by Christian Slater). In a bizarre turn of events, Bob accidentally becomes a hero, by stopping a crazed gunman in his office. The other main character is a woman named Venessa (played by Elisha Cuthbert) who is shot and left paralyzed from the neck down. The film also stars William H. Macy as Bob's boss after he is promoted to a high level position as a reward for his heroism.

The acting in this film is fairly good, particularly Christian Slater. The cinematography is also good, and there are even a few special effects. This is a fairly dark film, and left me feeling very depressed and dissatisfied.",1203552000,,768,4.565217391304348
3260582,2,B000YDBP3O,"In the Twilight Zone episode, ""An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge,"" a man miraculously escapes death but discovers that his mind has played a cruel trick on him.  Much the same appears to occur in ""He Was a Quiet Man,"" starring Christian Slater, Elisha Cuthbert, and William H. Macy.  Unfortunately, this modern take on a classic story won't stand the test of time.

Picture Bob Maconel as a thinner, angrier, and slightly more articulate version of Milton from the movie ""Office Space.""  Behind the pulled shades of his dank home Bob shows Son-of-Sam potential during animated discussions with a foul-mouthed goldfish, and the highlight of his lunch break is mentally blowing up his massive office building with a twisted version of the ""Easy"" button.  Living in a fantasy world and fuming over life's injustices, he plans to exact revenge on his workplace tormentors.

But right before go-time, something happens that transforms him from wacko to hero.  He gets his 15 minutes of media fame, gains a promotion, and former antagonists become friends and colleagues.  Even the beautiful but aloof coworker he loved from afar begins to return his affection.  It looks like Bob finally gets everything good he ever wanted.  So, why can't he relax and enjoy his new and improved life?  It seems that Bob is the kind of guy who isn't happy unless he's miserable.  Sadly, but predictably, his new house of cards begins to crumble, and events hurtle toward another violent climax.  Or do they?

When the credits roll, we are left to ask: What the heck just happened?  Was it all a pipe dream, concocted by a feverish soul grasping for redemption in the last possible instant before disaster?  Or was Bob on an irredeemable fast track to meltdown despite having the good life handed to him on a silver platter?  Either way, it left a bad taste in my mouth.  We see the cracks forming in Bob's shiny new world, and dismay builds when they enlarge.  Watching Bob take the road less traveled is like watching a train wreck in increments.  Indeed, perhaps it was the filmmaker's intent to show that some people are simply FUBAR, no matter what.

Still, I hoped for a more redemptive angle vs. what actually played out in ""He Was a Quiet Man.""  That's not to say I don't like downer movies now and then.  I've enjoyed well-made bummer-fests like ""The Remains of the Day"" and ""One Hour Photo.""  Sometimes it's fun to go to a dark place cinematically in order to see how good we actually have it, or vicariously feel the emotions of characters whose hopes are dashed.  But it's way too easy to take the prototypical office sad sack and make him, well, sad.  I'd rather see more positive themes played out in the too-familiar office milieu - repressed butlers and Robin Williams are far removed from my workplace (well, more or less).  Therefore I can't really recommend ""He Was a Quiet Man.""

As for the nuts-and-bolts stuff, the DVD doesn't come with many extras.  There's a small ""making of"" featurette where the filmmakers exult over crafting the movie on a shoestring budget and actually getting the starring actors, who are the best part of the movie.  Mr. Slater does a good job as the tightly-wound nebbish that is Bob Maconel, Ms. Cuthbert gives a layered performance as the ambitious secretary with a luminous smile, and William H. Macy could've played the boss role in his sleep.  As for the commentary - well, I didn't want to sit through this movie again, because once was enough.  Bottom line, if you're looking for a downer movie, skip ""He Was a Quiet Man"" and check out the flicks I named in the previous paragraph - or take a detour to the darker parts of ""The Twilight Zone.""",1203379200,3,3677,4.714733542319749

Slater is nearly perfect as Bob the maligned, ignored, nearly invisible cube dweller of yet another anonymous, overly bloated corporation. Elisha Cuthbert delivers a surprisingly fine performance as the beautiful Vanessa with the deceptive smile. And, of course, William H. Macy is his usual awesome self as Mr. Shelby, the smooth talking, double-crossing boss. Bob also has his goldfish who serve as his mirror and conscience. He has the golden boys at work who gleefully bully him and then cozy up to him with his sudden fame. He has neighbors who, although they don't know him, revel in his notoriety and who ultimately deliver the infamous title line.

Cappello has written quite a good script...until the end. I'll avoid spoilers here and say only that the extra features helped to explain why this ending was chosen over the original one that would have worked so much better. This movie would be almost perfect with a different ending, but ends up being a bit confusing as a result of what seems to be a rushed bit of punctuation for the overall story. Fortunately, the rest of the story is so dark and captivating, that the ending, although bothersome, does not ruin the movie.

My biggest mistake was expecting Mr. Slater to play the kind of comical role he's always played in the movies I've seen.  This movie is a fascinating look at the life of a schizophrenic man and how he sees the world around him.

Honestly I almost turned this movie off about 10 minutes into it simply because it seemed so bizarre but the longer I watched the more fascinating I found it.

No Hollywood pretty boy in this film (not that he is, anyway), but he deliberately took his characterization to a level where he is almost unpleasant to look at. Then with the director's use of distorting lenses and extreme close-ups, Slater's quirky, odd-man character is accentuated even more. It would be interesting to find out if he was emulating someone he knows.

Bill Macy's character wasn't much of a stretch for him; we've seen it before. Still, Macy is always fun to watch on the screen.

Elisha Cuthbert did a wonderful job running the full spectrum of emotions. She did a marvelous job `limping out' her body in her portrayal of a quadriplegic.

Our disillusioned protagonist begins to look like a character from the move we all know to well, ""Office Space"". Nevertheless, the movie soon turns to more of a drama then a comedy one would want to laugh about. Though the movie still portrays that certain stereotype of corporate America with the cubicled employees and the higher ups in their beautiful offices, the movie still leaves the viewer with many surprises. The viewer is often left wondering what is happening is real or a dream of the protagonist (or another character), which adds additional suspense to the plot when the violence erupts. Bits of comedy are then intertwined once again, nevertheless, the film retains its dark and tone of disillusionment.

If you like surprises, a bit of mystery, and a bit of humor, this might be the film for you. It's not going to be the next Office Space, nevertheless, but it will keep you wanting to the see the end.",1202774400,,1099,4.71875

I have always like Christian Slater, and when I watched the preview for He Was a Quiet Man, I was amazed with how he looked in this film. From the balding to the chipped tooth, it is a physical transformation only topped by his performance. With this role, Slater joins fellow cast member William Macy in the pantheon of great character actors.

Elisha Cuthbert was an unknown to me, and after this film, I want to see much more of her. She showed a range of emotions in this movie that was both refreshing and inspiring.

I don't want to give too much of the plot away, but I will say there were many places in this film where it could have gone one way, but didn't. It never takes the easy or expected path, rather going down a dark and somewhat twisted one.

Christian Slater reminded me, in his transformation in this film, to Michael Douglas in Falling Down. In fact, both films left me in a similar state after watching them for the first time.

His inability to function, even when events go his way, is always present.  As his courtship of a paralyzed coworker progresses his life seems to be improving but he cannot escape his delusions and paranoia and self hatred.

3260590,5,B000YDBP3O,"While preparing to open fire on his co-workers with a sneaked in six-shooter, unnoticed office drone Bob Maconel gets the tables turned on him and becomes an instant hero. The one person not showering Bob with praise is the object of his desire, Venessa, who is left a quadriplegic by the mayhem. But even Venessa quickly comes around when she discovers a glimmer of hope for the future. She and Bob become an unusual item, and Bob is suddenly in suburban paradise, but for how long? If Bob was disturbed enough to be planning a murderous rampage in the beginning, could Venessa's attention really be an instant cure? Or is it even real?

A dreamlike masterpiece from writer/director Frank A. Cappello, ""He Was a Quiet Man"" takes viewers on a mental dark ride through the thoughts of a madman teetering on the brink. Bizarre visuals that mix fantasy with reality will keep you unsure of everything you're seeing. The knowledge that Bob is a ticking timebomb will keep you on the edge of your seat, and the end result will leave you contemplating the film and its ideas for some time after. Make-up and an amazing performance make Christian Slater as Bob absolutely unrecognizable and highly award worthy. Elisha Cuthbert is no less remarkable in her role as the beautiful but perplexing Venessa, and William H. Macy is as flawless as ever as their sleazy boss.

The film's twist ending is sure to leave most viewers a bit bewildered, but if you can't stand having to figure things out for yourself, you need only explore the DVD's bonus features for understanding. There are deleted and alternate scenes, a trailer, a behind the scenes look, and director commentaries. The main extras, of course, are those director's commentaries over the film and the deleted scenes/alternate endings. These will answer most of your questions about vague things that were seen in the film, though they also may leave some viewers confused or disagreeing with the director's overall feelings on the subject matter. His stance seems to be that the problems of society are not the bullies and such, but the disturbed people they create. I would have to say that both are a problem. The suggested cure, ""thinning the herd"" by weeding out the dangerously disturbed victims of bullying and neglect, is important, but it doesn't strike at the source of the problem. What is needed is a non-violent answer to dealing with not only the potentially dangerous nuts, but the more socially-accepted nuts that create them as well. But, hey, that's just some of the debate this film inspires. One could also spend hours contemplating the symbolism, what is real and what is in Bob's mind, and if any of the alternate endings would have been preferred (I rather liked the last one). All in all, this film is a must see at the very least. The DVD is excellent and presents the film in a beautiful anamorphic widescreen format.",1202774400,4,2894,4.809236947791165
3260591,2,B000YDBP3O,"Proceed with caution if you don't have a taste for macabre, pitch-black humor.  That said, if you like dark - somewhat twisted - subject matter, then I recommend ""He Was a Quiet Man.""  Not without reservation, I have to add, because while there are interesting ideas presented here - this movie ends up being a bit puzzling.  I found the conclusion highly unsatisfying.

The description on the DVD case says this movie is sort of a hybrid of ""Office Space"" and ""Taxi Driver.""  That's actually pretty accurate, but the problem is, the movie isn't as good as either of those.  A movie like ""Taxi Driver"" doesn't need to advertise it's influences - it's a unique movie that stands completely on it's own.  More often than not, when a movie touts itself as being a cross between ""movie x"" and ""movie y,"" the end result doesn't live up to the predecessors it borrowed from.

I found the central theme presented by the movie to be a disturbing and a bit distasteful.  Bob (played by Christian Slater) is such a social incompetant that he would actually prefer his girlfriend to be physically disabled so she will rely on him.  Bob has struck out with women so many times, when given the opportunity to begin a relationship with a newly quadriplegic co-worker (played by Elisha Cuthbert) he embraces it wholeheartedly.  Problem is, there is little substance to their relationship other than Vanessa's need to be cared for.  This is fine for Bob, after all he obviously doesn't care about whether they actually love each other as long as she needs him to provide for her.  In Bob's mind, this is the perfect set-up:  he can control the relationship entirely, and also prop up his own self-esteem by reminding himself what a ""good deed"" he is doing.  It's all a bit sick, quite frankly.  Not that Bob is having this relationship - but rather the reasons why.

None of this ends up mattering much anyway, because the ""twist"" ending is a cop-out that pretty much negates everything that preceeded it.  It is simply bad storytelling.  I can't explain why exactly, and that is for two reasons: 1) I don't want to ruin any surprises for anyone, 2) I actually still don't quite understand why the intent was.  The ending is muddled, to say the least.

This really would have been a one-star review, but I do have to note that Christian Slater is very effective in the lead role.  As many reviewers have said, this is quite unlike the commonly known Christian Slater persona.  It's worth seeing mainly for his performance.  To a lesser degree, but still noteworthy, Elisha Cuthbert does good work in an underwritten role.",1202688000,,2605,4.699779249448124
3260592,3,B000YDBP3O,"After watching the film, ""He Was A Quiet Man"", my summary of the film would read something along the lines of, ""A sad, and at times beautiful, haunted little vision of the world.""

However after some reflection and wading through the sparse EXTRAS section of the DVD, watching the alternate endings and listening to the director's commentary track, my summary now reads, ""A fine forum to showcase Christian Slater's talents.  Though one wonders why he did not choose to release it in the confines of a film that focused on form over function.""

The ending of the film feels tacked on...and with good reason.  It was, to paraphrase the director, ""not how the film originally ended but how the film should of ended being nearer in spirit to the original draft of the screen play.""

What?

There is nothing wrong with a little rewrite. To say that the ending was telegraphed does a disservice to the years of fine work the telegraph has done as means of mass communication.  All the good will the movie has built up with clever uses of FX, the fine work of the aforementioned Mr. Slater, and a cast of slightly underused supporting players (and let us not forget a talking fish - who doesn't like talking fish?), all this is washed away in the last 10 minutes of the film.  The last line of dialogue uttered by Mr. Slater is, ""There comes a time when the diseased and the weak must be sacrificed in order to save the herd."" Well that's just dandy, thank you very much I'll take my molotov cocktail and cyanide capsule now, please.

Now, I love a little existential angst as  much as the next woman but a movie that dares to brandish the quote, ""Like the bastard child of Brazil, Fight Club and Amelie..."" on its DVD box-cover better bring the goods in one of the areas of at least ONE of those films. Quirky romance, dystopian visions of a society where man is reduced to drone, cinematography that either screams ""LOOK AT ME, MY COLORS FLY OFF THE SCREEN"" or ""DON'T LOOK AT ME MY COLOR PALETTE IS DRAB AND MUTED, SO COOL, SO UNDERSTATED"" or at the very least have a script with enough verve and panache that I'm willing to overlook the huge leaps of logic it takes for Tyler Durden, Brad Pitt and Edward Norton to all be dancing on the same psychological ID card. Unfortunately somewhere along the way, ""Quiet Man"" becomes as unhinged as it's protagonist and never really measures up in any of these categories.

For film geeks, the 10 minute featurette on the making of the film does give a good, if short glimpse of the interior works of a low budget film. The commentary track with the director, Frank Cappello, tends to lean towards the anecdotal as opposed to the informative, though a few low-budget tips can be gleaned for those willing to give their hard earned free time to listening to it.",1202515200,4,2797,4.540755467196819
3260593,4,B000YDBP3O,"Count me as one of those that really admire (most) of this film.

My disappointments:  I don't like the fire hose volume of profanity and don't believe it represents real life as much as those justifying it want to pretend it does.  And there is one rather disturbing sex scene that could have been handled differently to make the same point.  These kinds of scenes aren't ""real"" and certainly can't compete with movies made to arouse.  So, why have them?

Christian Slater is terrific as the deeply disturbed Bob Maconel.  He is a cipher and used as an office whipping boy by a couple of low-level low-quality bullies passing for managers.  Like many office drones, he dreams about a woman at the office.  His dreamgirl is named Vanessa who notices the ceramic bobble hula girl he keeps on his cubicle, but she is too absorbed in her blazing rocket of a career to even pay attention to real people in anything but a passing manner.  But she has a smile that lights up a room, as the movie keeps noting.

Bob takes his lunch on a spot where he has a view of the company skyscraper and has a little plastic box with a button so he can fantasize blowing the building to kingdom come.  More disturbingly, he has a real gun with real bullets that he ritualistically loads by naming who each bullet is for.  But he hasn't been able to bring himself to pull the trigger.  During one performance of his rite he drops a bullet and while he is on the floor a gun is fired and people start dropping while others scream.  An old man has carried out Bob's fantasy and they strike up a conversation that ends up with Bob emptying his gun in the old man.

The rest of the movie teases out how Bob is treated as a hero, is promoted, and his connection with Vanessa who was made a quadriplegic in the shooting (the shooter thought she was someone else).  So, Bob has this secret that others approach but no one will really confront.  Even the company shrink appears only to be be circling the core issues.

William H. Macy plays the CEO, Gene Shelby.  Vanessa was an up and coming VP who reported directly to him and their relationship combined the very personal with the professional.  Gene isn't really a bad guy, but just a ordinarily flawed guy running a company.  Others project their own fantasies and frustrations onto him and that is a quite realistic aspect of the film.  One funny aspect of the film is that Gene's desk is made up of multiple tables that are, together, somewhat larger than Rhode Island.

The way the movie is filmed handles the madness and melting realities very well.  I had not seen these kinds of visual symbols before and thought they were quite effective.

Why some call this a comedy or a black comedy is beyond me.  Yes, there are some comic moments, but the overall intent of the movie is serious.  True, Bob carries on mutual conversations with his goldfish, but what do you expect such an isolated man who has drifted into madness to do?

I think this is a very effective movie and recommend it for the right audience (keeping my caveats in mind).  For me, it was a Christian Slater tour-de-force.

3260594,4,B000YDBP3O,"HE WAS A QUIET MAN echoes the all too familiar news item of irrational killings in public places - here, in this country, by seemingly 'normal indistinguishable people'. Writer/director Frank A. Cappello has a good grasp on his subject matter and probably intended the rather slow movement of the film to underline the 'ordinary' situations that in a flash become extraordinary.  And he has a fine cast to demonstrate his thoughts.

Bob Maconel (Christian Slater in fine distorting makeup) is a nerd, an ordinary geek who checks numbers form his sterile cubicle in a massive corporation, heckled  by the 'fast guys' like Scott Harper (Jamison Jones).  He loathes his life, his crumby house and unkempt lawn, and most of all the loathes the people with whom he works - except for one Vanessa (Elisha Cuthbert) who has a 'smile that lights up a room', but pays no attention to the geeky Bob. Bob is deranged, talks to his goldfish at home (and they answer back!), and plans to kill the most offensive of his fellow workers.  But in the adjacent cubicle there is a like mind who beats him to the show and one morning opens fire killing five people and wounding Vanessa with a bullet to her spine that leaves her paralyzed: Bob serendipitously uses his own gun to kill the assailant and becomes a hero for the corporation.

Though Bob is unchanged in appearance or outlook he is elevated to VP of Creative Thinking under the head boss Gene Shelby (William H. Macy).  He visits Vanessa in the hospital, suffers her tantrum at being a quadriplegic, but finally is called back to her bedside and sweet-talked into being her hero life-saving guardian - and more.  Once Bob feels needed and perhaps 'loved' by Vanessa he begins to change, only to have unfortunate reminders of reality enter and alter his life yet again.

Though the subject matter is rather terrifying, Cappello elects to present this tale as black humor.  In the hands of less competent actors it would like have been a dud, but with Christian Slater's finely nuanced performance the film takes on a powerful sheen.  The line between madness and normalcy is a thin one indeed and there are many disturbing lessons to be gained from watching this small but well-done film.

Then one day, someone else beats him to it...and that someone else wounds the one person Maconel actually liked in the office. Maconel shoots his ""postal"" co-worker and becomes a hero.

Stop after this paragraph if you want to totally avoid spoilers. It is definitely good enough to warrant a look especially if you are a Slater fan or a big fan of the movie ""Brazil."" This is good work (by the actors) with some dark laughs.

When he gets back to work, Maconel finds he's been promoted. The woman he saved, however, wants him to help her end her life. At first he does...but they fall in love. I can definitely see why some are confused by the ending. I don't believe it was set up well enough by the script. It's obvious from the talking goldfish and hummingbirds that we are in Maconel's fantasy world...it's just not clear when we entered it.

Slater did do a very nice job here as did the rest of the cast, but the script needed one more draft before shooting. The similarities to ""Brazil"" down to the music are also a little uncomfortable. It is not startlingly original, but it is a solid enough three stars.",1202083200,,1335,4.332
3260596,4,B000YDBP3O,"What if Milton from ""Office Space"" decided to go postal, planned it out and brought a gun to the office?  What if another cubicle drone beat him to the punch?  That is the basic set up for ""He Was a Quiet Man.""  The put-upon office jockey, Bob Maconel, is played by Christian Slater, in a bravura performance.  Maconel seems to have a tenuous grasp on reality, and much of the film has a dream-like/hallucinogenic quality to it, including substantial 2-way dialogue with the fish in his fishtank.

At the beginning of the film, Maconel is clearly at the end of his rope.  In the first of several unexpected developments (I won't spoil the others), just as Maconel is getting ready to open fire on his tormentors, the guy one cubicle over beats him to it, shoots several co-workers and badly wounds the office cutie (Elisha Cuthbert).  As it plays out, instead of the stressed-out psycho, Maconel  is hailed as the take-charge hero who saved the office from an even worse bloodbath.

From this set-up, numerous unpredictable options become possible.  How is Bob viewed by others after his ""heroics?""  How does Bob handle the huge upgrade in status, and settle into a thoroughly unfamiliar role within the company?  Does his instability and loneliness get better or worse?  And how about the ladies -- does he get the girl ... any girl?

Perhaps the greatest pleasures in movies are presented by the well-told, gratifying albeit predictable story arc, mysteries where you generally know what happened but not who was responsible, and the rare flick in which you really don't know where they will take you but the ride is enjoyable in part due to the total unpredictability.  ""Quiet Man"" is firmly in the latter category, and to me was the most utterly unpredictable movie I've seen since ""Being John Malkovich."" OK, it's not quite up to ""Being"" but it is a terrific ride ... up until an ending that pretty much everyone will find unsatisfying, untenable, and a whole lot of other words that start with ""un.""

Is it just me, or are we in a reverse-golden age of too many movies with bad, bad endings?  The ending on this one, without spoiling anything, is one that has been done before, and has never been found satisfactory.  It does not negate the rest of the film, but ... oh, I'll just leave it at that.

Prior credits of writer/director/producer Frank Capello include the writing of the screenplay for `Constantine'. Being this his debut film it is understandable that he loaded it with all the techniques he liked and wanted to use. The technical aspect of the film does not present any innovative ideas, some of the effects used are the Snorricam (an apparatus strapping a camera to an actor, a trademark of director Darren Aronofsky in `Pi' and `Requiem for a dream') as well as the CGI shots going into small places (there is a shot in which the camera goes inside an ear of Slater's character that you can't help to compare to the initial gun shot of David Fincher's `Fight Club') Another thing to note is that this low budget movie uses lots of CGI effects, most of them looking so unrealistic that end up distracting the viewer from what's happening to the characters.

The music is in charge of Jeff Beal (who composed the music for `Rome' and `Carnivale'); after his work in the HBO series `Rome' I expected something original, the music is clearly influenced by the Dust Brothers' job for `Fight Club'.

After watching the film I was wondering why people were comparing this to other films such as `Fight Club' or `Amelie', as this film has nothing to do being compared to the mentioned movies. In the `first look documentary' included there is a moment in which director Frank Capello (in a moment of arrogance) claims his movie is an ""Amelie meets Fight Club"" story. I still don't see what the reference might be but please don't fall for it as this movie is nothing close to any of the two mentioned.

Extras are a few, some deleted scenes that do not add anything to the story (which explains why they were removed) and a 10 minute length featurette called `First look at He was a quiet man'. Audio is mastered both in 5.1 and 2.0 with no subtitles (not even in English, though it is close captioned).

He was a Quiet Man tells the story of Bob.  Bob is a nebbish of an office drone, who has two way conversations with his fish, is generally put upon by all around him, and leads what can charitably be described as a pathetic and pitiable existence. His life is a mess, and he has fantasies about shooting his co-workers and himself.

As you might expect, being such a nebbish, Bob lacks the guts to actually accomplish his plan.  On yet another day when Bob is pushed around, another co-worker's rampage provides Bob the unexpected opportunity to be a hero...

So begins ""He was a Quiet Man"", a movie which is a compound of motifs and other movies in an uneasy jumble.  Despite an unlikeable protagonist, Slater's performance is very unlike most of his previous characters. We do get a sense of just how put upon Bob is in his life.  Elisha Cuthbert, William F Macy and the minor actors in the movie do decent jobs.

Still, the movie isn't cohesive.  Talking fish, a nebbish protagonist, and strands of several plots just don't add up to a whole. It feels like pieces of several movies put together.

The ending of the movie is an twist which causes you to re-frame most of the events seen.  It doesn't feel like a cheat, however, and given what we had seen of Bob, it fits in with his personality.  It does bring the movie together somewhat in the denouement.

3260602,4,B000YDBP3O,"Without giving away the ending, this film does feel very contrived throughout, but it's all leading to a thought provoking and somewhat fulfilling conclusion.  Along the way, we get powerful performances from Christian Slater, and Elisha Cuthbert, that tend to take our mind off the absurdity of some of the plot intricacies, which include Slater interacting with digitally altered goldfish and hummingbirds; many over the top, stereotypical supporting characters; and seemingly unrealistic and out of place props within the sets.  The pacing of the film moves along at just a steady enough speed for us to go with the flow of what's being presented, and not become caught up with whether the characters' actions are plausible.  It will all make sense once the credits roll.

Bob Maconel is the geeky loner played by Slater, and it's easily one of the best performances of his career.  In many films, this type of character would receive some sort of pity from the audience, and a degree of likability, but not in Slater's case.  I believe it was the film's intention to not have this person gain any acceptance, and Slater pulls this aspect of the character off to a tee.  He remains the secluded, picked on office worker with suicidal and homicidal tendencies, without ever becoming anything more.

Supporting roles are minimal, with the most noteworthy being William H. Macy in prime form as Slater and Cuthbert's boss.  The cinematography is crisp and many daylight and well lit scenes pull away from the dark tones of the film, and lead viewers away from any dreary feeling a story like this could convey.

Overall, it's a very entertaining and unique twist on such oft covered plots such as the picked on office worker snapping, the nerd obsessing over the prom queen, and the question of pulling the plug on a quadriplegic.  It's depressing topics covered in a rather entertaining way, with a very suprising turn from a veteran actor who has never quite been taken seriously throughout his career.

There's two alternate endings in the special features section, with both of them running along nearly the same path of events as the original ending, but taking very abrupt and different turns right before the fade to credits.  It's amazing that any of the other two could have been dropped in without taking much impact away from the entire movie.

The Production Values on HE WAS A QUIET MAN are quite high, but then so were the production values on WEATHERMAN. Much of the work is crossed with FX work done by the Director. This comes out especially in the fact that there are 3 endings  made for the film. One of the endings was done entirely by the director. The ability to do this was basically  because  of the digital cameras. This also gave rise to the production problem that no-one saw Dailies, since none were available, the film was done and seen  in post production.
 The director says, in the DVD  extras, that this film  is about ""looking for a way out"" of his difficult situation in cubicle hell. In the process of doing this ( whether in dream or in real life, especially if you see ending Number 3 which supports the Dream view of the film) part of the extras show that his ( Christian Slaters Character) has the love for the girl (Elisha Cuthbert) to keep him breaking down.
 In the extras, the director states that his message is that those people in these situations, should, if they don't want to be here in this world, then they should take themselves out and not take anyone else out.
This view is highly debateable, and to say the least controversial, and it is what the director wants.
 Slater delivers the goods in this film, as does William Macy, and the Director breaks many ""rules"" in making the film. It certainly was a Make it or die style of film production.
 In a linear story sense, the film goes from negative to positive, and then back again; so in that respect it is different to the WEATHERMAN, but the tone still varies greatly, and has a weighty depressive tone, and as the writer-director says, he pulls people in unexpected diections. This is definitely a film that falls into the ""teach
me a lesson"" sort of film. Listen to the Directors commentary, and see the three endings, this will give a wider view of a film with a lot of depth, even though the depth might be turgid and murky",1201305600,2,2112,4.420103092783505

3260606,5,B000YDBP3O,"In a year filled with films that take a wide base of characters to throw them all into a single storyline that try their best to connect you to the plethora of characters (most with little luck).  Seemingly in this onslaught a brillinat little film slipped through the theatrical cracks and has now landed on DVD.  This film is none other than HE WAS A QUIET man which stars a very different and withheld Christian Slater in the role of an office and societal recluse whom fanatsizes about revenge, but when faced with his macabre fantasy seems to break free of his malicious intents and become that of a hero.

Not to be overshadowed is the riveting performance by Ms. Elisha Cuthbert whose role of the office ""looker"" turned quadriplegic demands an emotional response from it's viewer.

THIS IS A GREAT FILM PEOPLE, give it a shot, watch it for the performances given by Slater and Cuthbert, watch it again to question your own reality!",1201046400,2,938,4.666666666666667
3260607,5,B000YDBP3O,"I've never been a fan of Christian Slater although I've not been a detractor either.  This movie turned any opinion I had of him on its head. Well scripted film beautifully acted (By Slater, Macy and Cuthbert).  The movie has a twist but the script is good enough to make it gentle and not too much of a surprise. It also doesn't try and get too clever as some movies tend do with twists, sometimes to the detriment of the movie.  The story was strong enough to carry me all the way through to the end. And I was rewarded.  Buy it, go see it, rent it.",1200787200,,551,4.121495327102804
8231946,4,B000YDBP3O,"I thought going into this, He Was a Quiet Man would be similar to Falling Down (1993) starring Michael Douglas, a movie I really enjoyed, so that's how I'll structure this review, assuming the reader has seen the other film. Quiet Man isn't similar, but still very enjoyable. Imo, more so. Bob Maconel (Christian Slater) is the relatable character in a way of actually feeling some level of empathy for him, whereas the D-Fens character (Douglas) in Falling Down is too meme in spirit, so whether he lives or dies almost becomes irrelevant. It's just fun to watch D-Fens play out a fantasy I'm sure most of us have entertained, at one point. There seems to be more structure, albeit pathetic, with Bob Maconel, which is odd considering D-Fens is without question the more sane of the two.

Spoiler free smry: Bob works in the lower ring of a Co. and often thinks of shooting up the place, but can never get on with it. He knows this will never actually happen, and so does his talking fish that likes to bust his balls about it. Then one day a co-worker, apparently having those same thoughts, does what Bob couldn't. Someone close, well close may be too strong a word here, but someone who has always been nice to Bob gets hurt and this forces him to take action. In taking this action, life begins to have meaning for Bob and if you squint just right, you may even see him smile once in awhile. However, all good things must come to an end, especially for those who have it coming. The acting overall is decent enough, and Slater does a great job with this character. My only complaint, if one can call it that, is the ending kinda bummed me out.",1483142400,2,1648,4.456953642384106

The movie came early and I was able to watch it at the weekend.
Thanks for the great service",1402272000,,328,4.061538461538461

8231952,5,B000YDBP3O,"I started this one with a bit of skepticism. I mean, here is Christian Slater, the handsome devil from the nineties who played spooky and romantic roles with equal ease. The guy is talented, so I decided to give it a chance. Well, he's older than he used to be, and I've missed his work, so I didn't know what to expect.
The movie starts in a very unsettling fashion that is both grim and strangely funny in an ironic sense. He's got my attention 100% immediately. The makeup they did on Slater was very creative and it definitely added to the character. They used his real life cosmetic transformations to accentuate the awkwardness of the role. Many unexpected things happened in this film. It's difficult to surprise me, as I'm very into story telling in literature and films and after a time they get predictable. At first, the character didn't seem likable but as the film progressed I felt more compassion for him. This is a multi-dimensional character, not flat like so many others.
In general I thought it was a unique story about characters you might actually find the likes of in real life. They weren't over the top or poorly portrayed. All of the actors were chosen well, as there wasn't one I questioned as far as their placement was concerned. The ending rocked me, and there's hardly a day that goes by where I don't think about it in some way or other.
In short, this movie is deep in a disturbing but not altogether unpleasant way. Definitely give it a shot.",1362182400,,1475,4.548872180451128

Breaking Bad and the Sopranos were also good shows.  I liked Deadwood, but my wife thought they cussed too much.  Dexter was ok, but like 6 feet under its is slipping away.  I think i have twenty words now.",1347148800,,357,4.101449275362318
