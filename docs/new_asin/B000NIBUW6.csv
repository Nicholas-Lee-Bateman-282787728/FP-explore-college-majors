8177852,5,B000NIBUW6,"Guyver is an anime adaptation of a 1980's manga and an early 1990's Mark Hamill movie. Sadly the movie was dumb. Imagine Mark Hamill as a power ranger. That's pretty much the size of it. The anime is a different story. I was totally rocked by this series. There are tons of cool fight scenes. Lots of good villains and heroes. The voice acting is good and the animation is also pretty good. There is really good character development and some emotional scenes. This series also has lots of action to keep you interested.

I can't think of anything bad to say about Guyver. It's one you can watch several times and not get bored. It's not exactly one of the better anime titles out there, but it's still a lot of fun. I recommend giving it a try. I hope you like it as much as I do.",1353369600,,781,4.241610738255034

8177854,5,B000NIBUW6,This DVD is gonna be a tease. Everything thing starts to get moving even faster now and it leaves you wanting more. Make sure you pre-order the new volume. Also this DVD comes with a 28 page booklet like the 1st volume as a bunch of cool stuff. This is a must have.,1179014400,,265,4.018867924528302
