8238220,4,B0009IWFG0,"What can be said - I liked this DVD as much as vol 1! As with the first, this shows various kata and movements from different angles and you can really see what is happening.  The nice part about this is that they don't rush through the techniques as they show them more than 1 time.  You can learn a lot of subtleties by watching this DVD.",1370390400,,340,4.059701492537314
8238221,3,B0009IWFG0,"This is a very fine production indeed.  The opening graphic is really beautiful, with the reflection of the sea and some fancy kanji in 3-D.  I really like it.  The Tsunami production team made their martial arts video with taste and craftmanship.

However, in terms of content, it's just too short.  This volume shows hojoundo (preparatory excersice derived from kata) and basic katas of Uechi ryu.  Each technique in the first part, though very well demonstrated by two young men from Uechi ryu school, are shown only four times each, in their normal very fast speed with very little explanation.  Very hard to follow unless you are familiar with the style (I am not practicing Uechi ryu but did Goju ryu for ten years, so I can somehow figure out what's going on).

What I am trying to say here is this video is probably one of the best and most professionally filmed karate videos in the market.  The very small numbers of Uechi ryu materials available for public makes it even more valuable.  But having an instructor like Mater Gushi, I just wish that they make a longer video with more explanation, otherwise this beautifully shot but very short video couldn't bring justice to his teaching.

As said earlier, ""good but too short!""",1166745600,,1238,4.738317757009346
8238222,5,B0009IWFG0,"If you don't watch carefully you will miss it! Oh so subtle technique, relaxed, perfectly timed, and the key to the explosive power of Uechi Ryu.

Shinyu Gushi is a legend in Okinawan karate circles, and from the ability of his students, it is clear that he is training the next generation of truly traditioal karate fighters.

As with all Tsunami programs, great production value, camera-work, and sound editing. Classical Fighting Arts magazine",1152230400,,446,5.095890410958904
8238223,3,B0009IWFG0,I was a little disappointed with this DVD. The overall length is short and the opening graphics make it shorter. I would have preferred to see Master Gushi perform all segments of the DVD.  I did enjoy seeing Master Gushi's katas...the slow motion and multiple camera angles are nice.,1152144000,,284,4.795918367346939
