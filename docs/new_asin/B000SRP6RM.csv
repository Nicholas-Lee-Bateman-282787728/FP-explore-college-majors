8206531,2,B000SRP6RM,"this short film is silent as the editorial review says--BUT i think the average viewer would expect some voice-over or even subtitles to inform you as to whats going on. this is NOT the case- it's totally viewer-unfriendly.
do not buy this if you are expecting anything moore than a dvd-ized copy of  undoctored silent raw footage without any titles or subtitles. the impression i got from the product information was that this would be footage of helen keller's visit to tokyo and yokohama, BUT it only covers her visit to tokyo.",1188432000,9,530,4.760869565217392
