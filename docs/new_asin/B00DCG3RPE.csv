8591786,4,B00DCG3RPE,"A brisk script (co-authored by Sam Fuller) and numerous colorful supporting performances (by a who's who of British character actors) distinguish an otherwise by-the-numbers war-prop film, here told from the point of view of a wisecracking Blitz-era-London-based journalist (Don Ameche, the lone 'yank' in the picture).  'Confirm or Deny' (Fox, 1941) plays out fairly predictably as a morality study, and Ms. Bennett and Mr. Ameche do not exactly Bergman and Bogart make, but it does have its tense moments and is handsomely shot.  Fox's DVD-R offers a sharp b&w print, marred throughout by all kinds of specks and scratches, with clear audio.  No extras.  Movie and presentation merit about 3 1/2 stars",1387843200,7,703,5.25
8591787,5,B00DCG3RPE,"A terrific little flagwaver set in England tackling the question of a journalist's instincts for breaking a big story versus the greater good of staying silent. You will remember Roddy McDowall's excellent peformance as the cheery patriotic kid. Fritz Lang started this film, but, preposterously, was removed. But as with the later ""Moontide"" which Lang had also been removed from, Archie Mayor steps in and is dependable.",1383350400,5,422,5.313432835820896
