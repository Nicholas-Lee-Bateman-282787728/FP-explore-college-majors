8181086,5,B000BY49AW,"Whether populated by a veritable army of ""peculiar"" characters, cf Million Dollar Hotel, or two lonesome travelers, (cf this film, Kings of the Road,) or teams of earnestly morose seekers in scientifically sumptuous sets ( see Until the End of the World), no need to go on, the themes of these Wim Wenders films remain the same.

8181089,5,B000BY49AW,"This is the Road movie to end all Road movies. There are two main characters: Bruno, a movie projector repairman who lives in his van and whose job requires him to travel all over Germany repairing movie projectors in small-town theaters, and Robert, who is depressed, estranged from his father, his marriage on the rocks, and whose life is a mess. The two meet when Robert, depressed, makes a half-hearted effort to kill himself, drives his car in a river.

The movie is set in the rural villages of Germany of the 1970s, in what surely must now be as long-gone as the areas around Route 66 in the United States. The dialogue is minimal, the scenes of the German villages are lovingly depicted, and camera pans of rural Germany are long and expansive. Wenders was making a statement in this movie. This movie is about self-discovery, both for the characters involved as well as the German countryside Wenders must have known and knew was vanishing.

For years, this early masterpiece was not available in DVD. The only copies which could be had were cumbersome two-pack VHS tapes. This DVD is remastered and the black and white cinematography has a crisp, sharp picture, unlike the graininess of the original. In many ways, the murkiness of the original print was a perfect match for the existential struggles experienced by main characters though the picture.

While this is a Road movie, it has none of the destructiveness, self and otherwise, of Easy Rider, a movie which heavily influenced Wenders. Every character, major and minor, live in a quiet desperation and Bruno and Robert, while traveling throughout the country, attempt to resolve their anxiety and inner demons as best they can. While there is no final resolution from the film, any conclusion that may be drawn can be obtained from the original title of this movie, Im Lauf in Zeit, meaning, ""in the course of time.""

The ONLY drawback is that this movie is available only in a PAL format, and will not play in DVD players formatted for the United States and Canada markets. This movie is a good excuse to find a serviceable region-free player and savor this marvelous film.",1421712000,9,2142,4.796747967479675
8181090,5,B000BY49AW,"This is one of Wim Wenders's masterpieces, one of the best examples of New German Cinema and a brilliant conclusion to Wenders's ""road trilogy"" (the first two films are Alice in the Cities and Wrong Move).  Kings of the Road (aka In the Course of Time, which was the original German title) is simply about one man who travels around West Germany (this was made in 1976 when Germany was two countries) repairing movie projectors for small town cinemas.  He picks up another man who tried to kill himself, but just ended up making a fool of himself and losing his car in the process.  He decides to drive along with the ""film"" guy.  The film is brilliantly shot in black and white and filmed in mostly long shots, all wonderfully composed.  It's a very leisurely film (it runs 3 hours), and it's very slowly paced.  The first time I saw it, a friend of mine wondered openly what the hell was I thinking.  I rented it again when he wasn't around, and I loved the film.  It's hypnotic when you finally adjust to its rhythm, and this film is the culmination of Wenders's early German work.

Wenders is the third of the ""New German Cinema"" movement that included Fassbinder and Herzog.  He was the first one to be ""discovered"" by America, and Francis Ford Coppola invited him to America to make films.  Needless to say, when Wenders made it across the pond, his artistry deserted him slowly.  He made a few great films in Hollywood (most notably Paris, Texas), but his best films are German (Wings of Desire was arguably his last great movie).  Wenders's recent work is stodgy, extremely preachy, dogmatic, and pretentious beyond belief.  Fassbinder and Herzog were the more talented of the three men.

This film is still not out on DVD, and I'm not sure why.  Wrong Move made it to DVD a while ago, but most of Wenders's early work isn't on DVD.  This is the best of Wenders's early work, and needs to be on DVD now.",1218931200,4,1911,4.508720930232558
8181091,3,B000BY49AW,"Wim Wenders, along with Werner Herzog, Fritz Lang and of course Fassbinder, are my favorite German directors. This film is considered to be Wenders first epic masterpiece. Shot in black and white and nearly three hours long, this had all of the elements to be a great road movie. The first half was brilliantly directed, had excellent rock/soul music, some terrific action sequences and some heartfelt scenes mixed in. Truly a great viewing experience.

 However, the second half was a different movie. The two buddies go there separate ways, briefly experience their childhood villages and one even has a fling with a movie theatre ticket taker. The soulful music stops and the pace of the film grinds to a screeching halt.

 Still, the viewing experience is a positive one. You'll also see something in this movie you've never seen in another; not something I would recommend, but still one of a kind: you will actually see a man defecate, literally pull his trousers down, squat and wipe. Why would the director show this? Truly disgusting and one of the key scenes I'll remember from this potential masterpiece.

 I'd write more about the plot but it's just the story of a film projectionist who picks up a recently separated man after he crashes into a river. The two travel across Germany, open up to each other and meet some interesting characters as they go from village to village.

 First half is worth seeing, but the film as a whole is not up to par with my personal Wenders favorite, ""Wings of Desire"".",1176681600,2,1515,4.777777777777778
