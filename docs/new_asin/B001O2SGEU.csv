3726361,3,B001O2SGEU,"Zafir is another movie for horse lovers who are satisfied with images of horses. The story line is ok, but not captivating. The viewer does empathize with the children who love Zafir and are frustrated by adults who do not understand this. The movie fills an evening well enough, however, I would not watch it twice. Zafir serves its purpose for an evening.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Zafir/dp/B002QCWM38/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Zafir</a>",1346630400,2,483,6.333333333333333

If I don't have this confused with a different movie (didn't watch recently) it's in a foreign language and I'm sort of a slow reader, which means I miss some or a lot of the visual aspects.
