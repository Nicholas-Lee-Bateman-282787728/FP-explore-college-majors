1222455,5,B00000IBLC,"My family fell in love with ""Greater Tuna"" after seeing it on HBO in 1985.  Since then, we've seen Joe Sears and Jaston Williams, two of the most talented and uanappreciated comedians of our time, perform on stage three times.  There is a magic to ""Greater Tuna"" that will keep you coming back again and again until you know all the characters and dialogue as well as Sears and Williams.  You will love the many characters who are so ridiculously funny and believable, and be amazed that they were all portrayed by these two wonderful actors. I also highly recommend the ""Tuna Christmas"".",1018396800,,588,4.689320388349515
1222456,5,B00000IBLC,"We saw Joe Sears and Jaston Williams perform ""Greater Tuna"" live in Atlanta when they were first out and thoroughly enjoyed the play. Over 10yrs since and we still utter favorite phrases. The video does not disappoint. A very well written and acted piece that true Southerners can be proud of without fear of being mocked. The characters are real and fully developed. It may even take awhile to figure out that all these eccentric characters are being played by two great and talented actors.",997833600,5,492,4.8
1222457,5,B00000IBLC,"As a writer who lives in West Texas, I know that there are enough absurd characters here for a thousand plays or books. The incredibly talented Joe Sears and Jaston Williams could play all of those characters with total accuracy. You don't have to be a Texan to love this wonderful video, but most Texans should admit that these portrayals reflect many of the people they've encountered.",980726400,3,387,4.791044776119403
1222458,5,B00000IBLC,"This video is the greatest,it will keep you laughing out loud. I cant wait to get the other ones. I don't know why HBO doesnt have these two wonderful performers on for a Tuna Special. They move along at a good pace becoming all the different people who live in Tuna and they are believeable as these characters. You don't have to be from the south to love this video but if you are {as i am} alot of it will ring true. This is a video i'm going to pass around in my family so they can laugh as much as i did. Its a keeper!!",970876800,3,524,3.9065420560747666
1222459,5,B00000IBLC,"""Greater Tuna"" becomes more of a holy artifact the closer you get to Texas: suffice it to say, though, that this is a two-man show which NEVER lags, as the two performers become every citizen of note in Greater  Tuna, Texas--costume, hair, and accent changes intact.  The element of  brilliance comes when you realize that this isn't just a gimmick, but the  result of two actors that are doing everything in their power to SERVE THE  SCRIPT.  Until you actually see this piece of theater magic, there's  nothing I can add.",962928000,4,523,4.681318681318682

1222461,5,B00000IBLC,"This show is hilarious!  Two men play ALL of the citizens of a mythical town in Texas, complete with warped personalities, southern drawls, the whole works.  I think my favorite is Dee-Dee who runs a used ammo shop -- kinda says it all, huh?",1465516800,,241,4.454545454545454

If you haven't watched 1- or 2- person plays before, here's how:  Get some popcorn, a soda, and NO distractions.  At first your brain may not be able to resolve the same men playing several different characters, but after 20 minutes or so they meld together so realistically as individuals, and you can't get enough!  Joe Sears and Jaston Williams have Anytown, Texas (or, in their case, Tuna, Texas) nailed down.  For you ""outsiders"" that watch and think the characters are caricatures:  Nope...they're real!

1222469,5,B00000IBLC,"A very funny, and realistic, though fictional, presentation of many aspects of life in a small town. This one is set in Texas, but is characteristic of small town life anywhere in the US. I've seen it on stage several times (as well as other titles by the same duo). Since Sears has retired, these bits of humor are no longer available live (although Williams still does live one-man versions of other small-town phenomena, which are very entertaining), I wanted to share this bit of humor with a recently acquired friend. We both thoroughly enjoyed watching it together. Very cleverly done and very entertaining.",1446768000,2,613,4.903846153846154

We open Nov 11-13 and expect an audience to sit back and enjoy these zany characters as they reveal their small Texas neighbors in a very humorous way.

Two absolutely amazing actors creating unforgettable characters you either love or hate, but will never forget either way. One or two of the characters may be offensive to some, but there are offensive people in every city; Tuna lets you see them up close.  It's small town stuff that you can laugh at for a long time to come.

I wonder if any people outside Tuna would want to join up with the ""Smut Snatchers."" LOL! To find out what/who the group is, buy the DVD and watch.",1369612800,,541,4.346534653465347

I want these but it seems the folks at Tuna have no interest in their fans.  I can't believe they would let all their fans down by not putting the last two out on DVD.  I think most of us Tuna fans love the characters in this town and it is sad that now we won't' have the last 2 out of DVD. No one ever recorded the last two?
At least I got to see "" Red white and Tuna"" live,  but never got to see them perform  the Vegas one. I feel really cheated b/c I have been a loyal fan and have never looked for bootlegs.",1366329600,,676,3.595890410958904

My only gripe is that the seller didn't identify obviously enough that this format was VHS tape instead of DVD; as a DVD, the price would have been reasonable, as a tape, the product is over priced.  I probably would not have bought this copy if the seller had made it more plain that I was buying a tape, and not a disc.",1286668800,,486,4.271739130434782

vengeance from Di Di Snavely, the local guns and ammo store owner who's slogan is
if we can't kill it it is immortal to Pearl who has a thing against poodles with deadly consequences to Bertha Bumiller,the chairwoman of every committee in town
all of which are super conservative bible belt oriented, Inita Goodwin, Helen Bed and most memorably Vera Carp who is the definitive uptight, churchgoing, chain smoking know it all. The actors are amazing.
The play is a mix of laugh out loud humor and pathos.  The dialogue is hysterical and we find ourselves quoting lines over and over.
GREATER TUNA is the original play which was followed by a TUNA CHRISTMAS and A RED WHITE AND BLUE TUNA which has the most hysterical climax of all.  Its best to view them in the order they were produced so you can follow some of the story lines that carry over.",1286150400,2,1089,4.4623115577889445

Yes, Greater Tuna has a population of 24 and Joe and Jaston have played most of those residents on stage.  You have everyone from DeeDee Snavely with her cigarettes and used weapons store (""We guarantee every weapon in this store to kill.

If you can't stand Texas and get your knickers in a twist every time some Texan comes along to brag about how things are in his state, avoid this title. Go get a John Hughes movie instead. If you love Texas and Texana, get it. Now.",1167868800,,456,4.3023255813953485

1222544,5,B00000IBLC,"I have looked for the film for years. I saw Greater Tuna many years ago in San Francisco. This was just too good to be true. Growing up in a small town in Texas. I could so identify with each part these two brilliant actors play so easyily. This has to be one of the longest running two man show in the history of the country. I was in my late twenty's and it is still running. I saw the two Actors on PBS promoting A Greater Tuna Christmas they both have aged. However they are still portraying the two love and hate characters that keep us laughing year after year.

1222545,5,B00000IBLC,"Like James Thurber's short stories, all three ""Tuna"" plays are wonderful and funny glimpses of Americana.  And, like Thurber's works you will laugh mainly because you recognize the people and even identify with some!

One thing that is so good about these two actors is that they have given each and every one of their characters a distinct and separate personality.  Aunt Pearl is one of my favorites.  (Don't you LOVE her revenge on the judge??????)

If you have never seen this play or the other two, you should see them.... YOU SHOULD YOU SHOULD!",1113955200,4,550,4.747368421052632
1222546,4,B00000IBLC,"I SO wanted to award them 5-stars like all the rest of the reviewers, but the DVD version of this classic play just doesn't meet my expectations.

My wife and I absolutely love the Tuna trilogy (Greater Tuna, A Tuna Christmas, and Red, White and Tuna).  We first saw Greater Tuna on our honeymoon while in San Francisco fifteen years ago and have seen others perform it several times since.  We have seen Joe and Jaston (the originals) perform A Tuna Christmas and Red, White and Tuna twice each.  Every time we see any of these three shows, we absolutely laugh our a$$e$ off!  The writing is simply sheer genius.

I was incredibly psyched to learn that the first two shows had finally been released on DVD and rushed to buy them.  I popped one into the player and that was when my heart sank.

Don't get me wrong.  The play and the performances are absolutely stellar!  I am so glad that they got these performances recorded for posterity (the third one, Red White and Tuna, MUST be done as soon as possible before the opportunity is lost)!

The one star docking from the perfect five is due to the really shoddy DVD packaging and presentation.  There are ZERO extras included on the disc.  NOTHING!  There isn't even an information insert inside the cover of the DVD.  The show itself is just a straight copy of the VHS video recording transfered to DVD.  Period.  No remixing or remastering; any flaws on the VHS video transfered to the DVD playback.  Shame on them.  They could have created something for the ages, but no.

Still, this is an incredible show and well worth the investment to own.  My wife and I will watch these shows over and over now and never tire of them.  If they ever do come to their senses and remix and release some ""collector's editions"" with lots of extras (and they should, by all means!), then we'll probably jump on those as well.  We love them that much!",1104364800,47,1889,4.491176470588235
1222547,5,B00000IBLC,"Sometime during the 80's, I stumbled into a theatre in Los Angeles where this show was playing and was completely won over by the citizens of Tuna, Texas.  Later there was an hour long version on HBO that I was lucky enough to tape and currently still resides in my dwindling VHS library.

This version goes back to the much loved and still touring stage play ""Greater Tuna""  This is a filmed version of the classic stage play.  20 years later, it has lost none of it's hilarity.

The entire population of Tuna Texas are portrayed by American Treasures Joe Sears and Jaston Williams. The Tuna trilogy- Greater Tuna, A Tuna Christmas and Red White and Tuna have a fierce and almost cultish following throughout the country.

This is an excellent character study of the citizens of a small town in Texas, even though there is a murder mystery- the characters who reside in Tuna grab the spotlight and the performances by Mr Sears and Mr Williams are unforgettable, they deserve the long list of awards they have received for these plays.

Even though the show pokes fun at small town life and Texans in particular, the shows are extremely popular in Texas, anyone who knows anyone from a small town will find something to identify with.

I cannot recommend this highly enough. I love these shows so much that I would let the cast stay at my house when they are in town and I make my parents get a hotel room.

Get that tour back to Seattle boys!  But I'll be happy with the DVDs until I can see it live onstage yet again.",1093132800,18,1519,4.471014492753623
1222548,5,B00000IBLC,"I can quote every line from this work of Southern art. I taped it from HBO in the 80's and my precious video has been copied, loaned, went to Alabama and back, and most recently a poor attempt to transfer it to DVD. When a local little theater did a production of this show, I was crushed to find that they only wanted to audition for two men. I now own the trilogy and can only reccomend it as far as my Southern articulation will allow me to express. If you were raised in the South by Southern people, you will both laugh hysterically and shrink with horror. In short, you will identify so with this play that you will weep.
Have some field peas and rice and drink a glass of sweet ice tea. This video IS the South in all it's crazy, comforting, wonderful glow-ry!",1081987200,4,767,4.224489795918367
1222549,5,B00000IBLC,"I saw this gargantuanly funny play during its first run in Atlanta, before it made its way to Broadway and before the actors achieved their fame.  Joe Sears and Jaston Williams have definitely created one of the most hilarious shows ever to grace the boards.  This video is a lived filmed version of one of their shows.
What makes this show funny is the characters and their believability.  Why should this be seen as unique and deserve such high praise?  Because all the characters in this play from Texas' third smallest town (Tuna, Texas) are played by two actors who manage to morph almost instantly into different costumes and personnas.  In short, you've got two quick change artists performing some of the most spot on real performances you'll ever see on stage or film.
Sixteen characters are portrayed by these fine actors and some you will come to love and other you will lovingly hate.  The show tells the story of the a couple of days of the interwoven lives of the citizens of Tuna, Texas.  There's murder and intrigue, but it's all on the light side as we weave our way through this interesting world to discover who the murderer is.
You have Dee Dee Snavely, Bertha Buemiller, Aunt Pearl Burriss, Stanley and Charlene Beumiller, Vera Carp, Reverend Spikes, Petey Fisk, not to mention a pack of dogs and more than one ""bitter pill"".  There's many many others that will have you rolling onto the floor off of your couch.
The show was apparently lengthened after pre-Broadway run, though no one who didn't see that version will know.  If you're wise, you'll also check out the two other shows in the trilogy:  ""A Tuna Christmas"" and ""Red, White, and Tuna"".
