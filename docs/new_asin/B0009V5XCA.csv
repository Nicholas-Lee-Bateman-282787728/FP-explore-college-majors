What d'ya know...A cowboy movie with cows for a change.  Excellent movie.  Great cast, story line, acting, and camera work.  Everyone played their parts well.  Hated to see John Ireland in a bad guy role, but he was soooo good at it.  Vengeance Valley won't disappoint western fans.  5 Stars.

Rage At Dawn, Randolph Scott

Scott plays a secret agent whose job is to put an end to crime by a family of bank robbers.  The scenery and film work are excellent.  The acting is first rate by a very good cast; however, the story line may be a little too predictable for adult audiences. 4.5 Stars.",1424649600,,626,4.54954954954955

2323781,4,B0009V5XCA,"Rage at Dawn & Vengeance Valley

Westerns, or Cowboy Movies, were popular in the 1930s and 1940s (or earlier). They usually told of the conflict between the cattle barons (large corporate ranches) and small ranchers or homesteaders (small farmers). These conflicts were based on historical facts (which are censored from most school books). They became less popular with the rise of the Private Investigator stories in the 1940s and 1950. The search for a missing person is comparable to finding missing cattle. Here are their condensed reviews.

Rage at Dawn 1955
This color movie is the true story of the Reno Gang from southern Indiana. Their looting, killing, and burning was similar to Quantrills Raiders. The Pinkerton Agency sent an undercover agent to get information. He pretends to be a train robber to get their trust and set a trap. The Reno brothers are caught and receive a severe punishment.

Vengeance Valley 1951
This color movie is about cattle ranching where Herefords are raised for meat. Missing cattle are traced to another ranch. There is a fight, then a plot to profit from a roundup of cattle on the range where they will be taken to market. There is the usual personal conflicts among people. Will the conflict be settled peacefully?",1396224000,,1259,4.957345971563981
2323782,3,B0009V5XCA,Nothing better than an old western. Really brings back memories. Great actors. Usually a really good ending with the good guys winning.,1392508800,,135,5.181818181818182
2323783,5,B0009V5XCA,"Vengeance Valley,  Burt Lancaster, 1951

The old ""Cain and Abel"" plot device is redefined within Western terms in MGM's Vengeance Valley. Burt Lancaster stars as ranch-hand Owen Daybright, who has been raised as a son by rancher Arch Stroble (Ray Collins). Stroble's natural son Lee (Robert Walker) has always been envious of Owen, who in turn has spent most of his life pulling Lee out of trouble and keeping the boy's misdeeds a secret from the elder Stroble. When Lee fathers an illegitimate child, he tries to shift the responsibility on Owen, leading to a life-threatening confrontation with the vengeance-seeking brothers of the baby's mother (Sally Forrest). There's plenty more plot twists before virtue finally triumphs. Joanne Dru co-stars as Lee's long-suffering wife Jen, who harbors a secret yen for Owen.

A good, classic western nicely restored. Great audio and visual quality remastered by DigicomTV. A great watch for the entire family! I high recommend this interesting film featuring a young, handsome Burt Lancaster!

Rage at Dawn, Randolph Scott

Based on the exploits of the infamous Reno gang, the film casts Scott as a federal agent assigned to squelch the Renos once and for all. After staging a few phony train robberies, Scott is accepted into the gang. While posing as a criminal, he discovers that the Renos are able to operate freely because they've paid off several important local officials. Once he's managed to round up the surviving gang members, Scott must contend with a self-righteous lynch mob led by Howard Petrie. Mala Powers is the leading lady in Rage at Dawn, while the dreaded Reno boys are convincingly enacted by J. Carroll Naish, Forrest Tucker, Myron Healey and Denver Pyle.

A captivating film beautifully remastered by DigicomTV. Wonderful audio and visual quality. A good, western classic the whole family will enjoy! I highly recommend it! Its a good watch.",1387670400,4,1910,5.12540192926045
