1658986,5,B00005T33J,"I had a total hip replacement earlier this year and wanted to expedite my recovery so I could get back to my own extensive walking program.  I used all three tapes for a total of about 2 months (3-4 times a week), graduating from the 1mile, 2 mile, up to the 3 mile walk.  I was very gratified by my speedy recovery--my doctor was too.  These tapes did me more good than the physical therapy program I was in.
  I was on a walking tour of the New England states this fall (walking 5-6 miles each day) when a took a terrible fall and fractured my pelvis.  That was a long recovery period and I was truly out of shape again.  Guess what--I went back to my ""Walk Away the Pounds"" system as soon as I was able and am, again, delighted with the results.  I have told other people about Leslie Sansome's system--the only way to go!",1008374400,,825,4.177215189873418
1658987,5,B00005T33J,"I have tried a multitude of different exercise forums over the years and this is the first time I have found something that I can actually stick to.  Leslie and her group actually make this Fun to do. I own the set, so If I am not so energetic I do the first tape.  If I feel really great I go to the three mile walk. I walked away thirty pounds in two months. Now, I ate really sensibly during that period of time, but I am sure that Walk Away the Pounds was at least 75% responsible for my drastic weight loss. And I am positive it was responsible for my increased energy and more positive outlook. Thank you Leslie Sansone for making my life a whole lot better. P.S. If I can do this anyone can.  I have Fibromyalgia and this has practically eliminated my pain and stiffness in the A.M. I have been searching a LONG TIME for something that will take off the pounds . . . and I am 48.",1006646400,26,886,4.051428571428572

1659005,5,B00005T33J,"The ""Walk Away the Pounds"" videos are great--especially if you have reached your senior years.  I have never had an injury exercising with these tapes.  You don't have to use the weights and my substitution of standard 2-lb. weights purchased locally take the place of the weighted balls used in the video.
With my school-term schedule, I grew frustrated not being able to walk first thing in the morning.  The ""Walk Away the Pounds - 1-Mile Walk"" was the perfect answer.  It takes 20 minutes from start to finish and, while I might still be carrying around some of those pounds, I can move around much better than many of my younger co-workers.
I used my first video so much it wore out which was why I made this purchase.",1491696000,,723,4.538461538461538

It's a great beginner workout or for those short on time. You can make it as hard as you want to by upping the weights. I use 1 pound weights and I can feel it the next day. I hope to progress to 2-3 pound weights soon. Perfect for those with health problems and need a gentle yet effective workout, I highly recommend!",1472083200,,478,4.206521739130435

1659085,5,B00005T33J,"These exercise tapes come as VHS or DVD.  If you're older &/or have problems with your joints, I recommend her exercise program.  Start with the 1 mile and skip using the hand weights until you feel ready.  Save yourself some money and just buy 2 inexpensive 2# hand weights vs the weight balls she uses.  Her programs really does work.  I lost 95# using the L Sansone tapes along with the book by Joyce Vedral, ""Bottom's Up"".  When you feel ready then move up to the 2, 3, or 4 mile programs.  Another thing I liked is I was able to do these tapes any time of the day and the weather didn't matter.  I could also do them in the privacy of my own home, which I really liked.  The program really does improve your strength and balance and you don't need alot of space to exercise in.  I found that her stretches at the end were inadequate for me and added some additional and different ones that worked for me.",1363651200,2,909,4.232558139534884
1659086,5,B00005T33J,I discovered Leslie Sansone after a surgery. These tapes are very beneficial to your overall health. They practice what they preach. Keep moving is the key. Very easy and effective. Diane.,1343779200,,188,5.096774193548387
1659087,5,B00005T33J,"I first came across Leslie Sansone's Workout tape in one of my recent excursions to the library. I had never heard of it until then. ""Walking away the pounds,"" seemed like a good idea to me. Before I realized there were ""steps"" to this program I put the video into my VCR and worked out to the 3 Mile Walk. I huffed and puffed my way through it-proud of myself for sticking to the end of the workout. I also was pleased with the renewed verve of energy I felt racing through my body. I considered the workout well worth the effort. This was a video I decided I wanted to own and came to Amazon. com to purchase one.
I found a good bargain that included the 1 mile, the 2 mile and the 3 mile. I purchased mine from a company called lexiphiles. AS of today I have lost 8 pounds since startng the exercise program just over a month ago. My bath scale is cantankerous and gives off different readings at various times. This morning it gave me a reading of 161.4 pounds; I'll stick with that because yesterday and the week before I weighed 161.6 pounds. I allow for a 4 pound weight difference. That is generally how much my scale is off. It is a new scale so I will give it time to ""fix"" itself.
I can tell when I am shedding weight pounds by how my clothes fit (I never wear larger fitting clothes; I keep my old clothes in anticiption of shedding the weight.) A few months ago-when I was at my heaviest-up to 173 pounds-I bought a nice Nike jacket on sale. I loved the color a hot pink and couldn't pass up the bargain. It would not zip up at all in the front; so I just wore it loosely with the front unzipped. A few weeks ago, I put it on and zipped it ALL THE WAY UP so I know I have lost at least ten pounds! Praise God for that! This is a high recommendation and the AARP also gives Leslie Sansone's Walk Away the Pounds Workout a thumbs up endorsement.
I am still on the 1 mile program but am anticipating advancing to the 2 mile soon. I am taking it slowly since I am coming off of major surgery. I showed this workout to my doctor and he highly approved it. I also timed it and it amounts to 22 minutes including the stretching exercises. Not the eighteen minutes on the box. The weighted balls  Leslie is so fond of are helpful but I can not seem to keep enough water in mine-they tend to cave in-unlike the ones used in the video. The shiny blue spheres the exercisers use must have sand in them, instead of water.
The miles go by fast because you are having fun getting fit. For couch potatoes and those reluctant to start an exercise program-this is it! I can only echo what Leslie says in her intro-Get UP and Get Started!<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nature-s-Way-Alive-Multivitamin-180-Tablets/dp/B0009F3RO2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nature's Way Alive!

It is the 1 mile walk and you get muscle strengthening, aerobic fitness and flexibility all in this video. It doesn't require a lot of room in your house to use it, so it is very convenient.

1659127,5,B00005T33J,"I have tried lots of exercise videos over the years, but never any by Leslie Sansone.  I always dismissed her as being ""Not hard enough or whatever"".  I was a faithful exerciser for a good number of years, then one day a couple years ago, I simply stopped.  I went from a energetic person to a lazy bones, I wanted to start exercising again but
needed something simple.

I found Leslie's compilation DVD (which contains this program)at Target and bought it.  I heard about Leslie from coworkers, and even joined them one day for their lunch hour walk.  I immediately liked Leslie and wanted my own copy.

This is a perfect workout for beginners, I have used it quite a bit, great for days you don't have a lot of time or just don't feel like doing anything.  I also like this as a warmup to other workouts, some of my strength DVDs in my opinion don't have a long enough warmup, this solves that dilemma.  Leslie has 4 basic steps in her walking programs, walking or marching in place, side steps, knee lifts and kicks.  She also uses some light weighted balls in this workout (and others).  I usually don't use the weights as I do other strength training, she does have a modifier who doesn't use the balls, plus another modifier who uses smaller range of motion.

I like Leslie quite a bit, she can be a bit chatty but it doesn't bug me at all.  She comes across as friendly, non intimidating and very genuine.  I am glad that I finally discovered her, she has become a regular in my workout routine and she will stay there.",1256342400,,1526,4.4035714285714285

When I get better at it, I will use the 2 Mile Walk which I also purchased but haven't used yet.  I would recommend this workout tape to anyone who is starting out.  It is an aerobic walk so you do get a good workout but not too strenuous.

The 1-mile walk is fast and easy--about 20 minutes and you've knocked out a mile and used lots of different muscles. I do the one mile every morning (in my work clothes!) and the two-mile in the evening. (It takes 35 minutes.) After a month of this, I'm still not bored and...most importantly...I'm down two pants sizes. It's great!",1216166400,,431,4.333333333333333
1659154,5,B00005T33J,"I was always finding excuses to not exercise, and after hearing success stories, i wanted one of my own.  This is short and simple, and VERY motivating.  It's only about 18 minutes, with a small amount of stretching at the end.  Between this and the three mile, is how i get my exercise, it's also motivated me to go out and take an outdoor walk daily!!  PERFECT for beginners.

 At the end of the movie when she talks about how she knows you'll make it to the 2nd and 3rd mile, i was like ""NEVER""!!  Then two days later i went after saving up my money and bought the three mile at my local target.

I LOVE THESE!!!  I use cans instead of weights, i don't have weights. I just ordered 3 more videos and one of her books from amazon, i'm addicted!! Just get up and try, it's so simple and you have nothing to lose....except those burning calories!!!! THANK YOU LESLIE!!!",1210291200,,869,4.282208588957055

Obviously, all the people in the group were supposed to make some positive comment in the course of the workout and some had a hard time doing it. There's ornery ol' Randy in the back, Jenay who comments on how comfortable the exercise balls are, Jody who just had the baby - you learn about all these people just by watching them interact so it makes it amusing while you're walking. The steps are simple but effective, anybody can benefit from the exercises regardless of fitness level, and if you - heaven forbid - haven't shelled out a ridiculous amount of money for the handy dandy Walk Away the Pounds weighted balls, just use 2 pound hand weights. Highly recommend.",1177545600,,746,4.533333333333333
1659156,5,B00005T33J,"This was one of the first Walk Away the Pounds videos I bought and I still find it (months later) to be useful & fun to do.  I prefer to walk outside but with winter coming, I need to do something else that will not hurt my knees with a lot of lunges & difficult dance-like moves.  I enjoy the quick pace, the distance meter & the  ongoing encouragement - I tune it out sometimes but usually I find it takes my mind off the time.  I have since bought several other, longer videos to vary the workout routines but I recommend this video as well as the 3-mile for a good, strong workout.  I have never found an aerobic workout to benefit my weight loss goals but this program seems to be the exception. I am looking forward to trying more of Leslie's videos this winter!",1130025600,7,768,4.197278911564626

I'm trying to up my excercise everday to try to lose 20 pounds that I've gained over several years of basic inactivity and a desk job. This tape is great because I can squeeze it in with very little time commitment. I get up at 5, jump into my tennis shoes and excercise in my pajamas, and it feels great that even if I don't get any more excercise for the rest of the day, I've at least done a mile!",1128384000,10,496,3.872549019607843

I was watching the video while my mother did it and I really had an urge to try it. Leslie seemed very friendly and inviting, but not overly annoying (like other instructors in many workout videos), and the workout is simple with just enough difficulty. This is really great if you're out of shape and don't have a lot of time. Anyone can do it...it's really easy and dare I say, fun! Whether you're 17, like me, or 70...skinny or chubby...this video is for you. I highly recommend it.",1121472000,12,615,4.4035087719298245
1659169,5,B00005T33J,I love this workout. It is so easy with no complicated moves. I was able to work up a sweat doing it. It is only about 18 minutes so I can always find time to do it. My children even try to do the moves. I have the 2 and 3 mile also and they are great. There is not much stretching in the end though.,1111881600,6,300,3.5606060606060606
1659170,4,B00005T33J,"Within a short amount of time (less than 30 minutes) you can walk two miles while burning a ton of calories because of the extra movements Leslie adds.  While it's not challenging, I felt great after finishing the video because I felt a sense of accomplishment.  I walked two miles, in my house.  There's no excuse for putting this one off.  It's easy, fun and it's also a nice change from my yoga & pilates routine.  This would be a great video for someone who puts off exercising.  You don't need one single piece of equipment.  Do it in your bare feet if you want.  You'll feel great but completing the video.

This is one of the few exercise videos I've seen that didn't have thin people in it.  No one was obese but they weren't thin either.  Not a bad thing, just an observation.",1110499200,10,785,4.344827586206897

It has has minimal variety compared to other workout programs (dance-based aerobics, etc.), and I like variety.  Still, this tape is a great workout for those days when I don't feel like thinking and trying to remember the next step/combo.  Also, during the summer, it is great, because you can walk inside in the air conditioning and only break a light sweat! Just a note--if you buy this tape by itself, make sure you purchase two pound weights.  You will need them if you want to make your arm toning more effective.",1090800000,13,641,4.5964912280701755

I love to walk outdoors but I live in a very hot climate. This video makes it possible for me to do my walking in the comfort of my home. My 4 year old loves to go along with the tape also! I am looking forward to getting Leslie's newest tape, the hour-long 4 mile walk. Her chattiness doesn't bother me at all, although some viewers may not like that.

The best part of Leslie's videos that I've seen, is the fact that her routine is easy to follow, you don't need that much exercise space and the people whom you can watch if you don't want to use the weighted balls one day or you need a lower intensity.
The only minus I can see is that Leslie and he rest do a lot of talking in general and about the greatness of her exercise balls specifically. I can't take a star away from my review for that, though, because Leslie seems like such a sincere person.

It is a great video that is easy to follow if you have kids under feet and don't have an hour to spare for tricky routines and hard core body sculpting. This gets the job done without leaving you wiped out. Very simple but effective moves that even my kids join in once in awhile. I don't have those ""I don't feel like working out today"" days anymore b/c I just pop this in and am done with it in 30 minutes and that just feels great. The banter between the ladies gets old fast but it is so easy to follow that I just mute it and put on my own music. I am on ... right now to order another of Leslie's tapes.

I would highly recommend this video for just about anyone, especially those who've recently had a baby (or not so recently), anyone just getting back into shape after any medical event, or even older folks- especially fellow mall-walkers.  There is very little if any impact to worry about and if you live somewhere cold, wet, hot, humid, ect., and have been using the weather as your excuse to not go out and get some exercise (like I've been- which means I can find an excuse for 3/4 of the year), let your excuses stop here.

I feel incredible and I am happy to say that I have lost 12 pounds!
Leslie uses simple movements that are very effective. I was never a candidate for complicated workouts or ""dance moves."" I even tried Taebo, which I learned, but didn't like.

If you are used to ""The Firm"" type work outs, you may not find this too challenging, though it does get your heart pumping.
Yeah, some of the chatty is a bit corny, but I tend to overlook it.  Leslie seems to be a great motivator. I just use 3.3 lbs weights which work fine with me.",1034812800,,533,4.086538461538462

I have been able to work this video in my routine just like showering or brushing my teeth. I am hoping that with a little more time I will be able to work up to the next level. Leslie Sansone is very easygoing and the simple moves and transitions are great. The only minor flaw in the video is that there is no real warm up, she just starts walking. I would recommend some stretching to start off. I purchased this vudeo used and it came in brand new condition and the service was superb.

They are diabetics and have a hard time to do any excercise because of their age, but they can keep up and enjoy this workout with me.  They have lost 10 pounds each doing these tapes and they feel energised and healthy.  You don't even have to use their weights to feel it working.  We don't have that many weight balls to go around so we use our own weights and we get a great burning workout anyway.

It's definitely a challenge doing them, but I just loved them so much that I bought this set for my mother for mother's day.

Leslie is a very relaxed instructor that gets her people motivated to this exercise and is not afraid to ask how her participants are doing.  She is very untderstanding and knows that everybody is not going to get for the first time.  If you have not bought this video, I should you do it now.",1027123200,3,475,4.064516129032258

I did 8 years of Jazzercise-circuit-step with 5 lb hand and leg weights and exertube, so I know what a good workout is.

I even get up earlier in the morning to do the 1 mile tape since it's only 20 minutes, and then in the evening I do the 2 mile tape. So far, I haven't tried the 3 mile tape, but I will as soon as I hit a plateau. Some people have said that Leslie is a bit chatty, and she is, but I don't think it's distracting. She seems genuine, and her interaction with the other people on the tape doesn't bother me at all. Also, when I bought these tapes, I didn't know about the ""Walk Away"" weights --you don't really need them; you'll still feel the burn without them. However, I think if I had it to do over again, I'd order the video set that comes with the weights.
Sometimes when I read reviews, I don't really believe that the person could possibly like a workout video as much as they've said.

Yes, Leslie is very chipper and excited, but it doesnt bother me.  The people on this tape are REAL people..all shapes and sizes. Old, young, heavy, and fit.  There is a lot of chatter, but it sorta keeps things from getting dull.  If you ever get sick of hearing the chatter, just turn the volume on mute and play your own music.  The tape starts with a warm up and learning the four basic (EASY) steps of indoor walking.  Then you start your 2 mile walk with basic upper body exercises and small weight work thrown in...very easy.  It starts slow, then the intensity level does go up until you are sweating and then the cool down begins to ease those muscles.  The meter at the bottom of the screen tracks how ""far"" you've walked.  At the end of the half hour, you actually feel as if you walked 2 miles, but had the benefit of doing upper body work as well.  This tape is easy and effective.

I really enjoyed this video.  Leslie has REAL people in her videos, not ultra-fit models and I find that encouraging.  She has people, throughout the workout, demonstrate modifications that may be done if you're not yet capable of exerting as much energy.
This video is only 30 minutes long (covers a 2 mile walk) and by the time I want to quit exercising, this video is nearly over.  Leslie is charming and enthusiastic (although, I get tired of hearing her repeat the same phrase over and over).

These tapes did me more good than the physical therapy program I was in.
  I was on a walking tour of the New England states this fall (walking 5-6 miles each day) when a took a terrible fall and fractured my pelvis.
