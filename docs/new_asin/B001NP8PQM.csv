The image quality rates about a 4/5 with some of the close-ups not quite as clear as they could be but overall great video quality. The sound is easily 5/5. I was not a big fan of the crazy legs album but the extra set that was also recorded at Ronnie Scotts and included on the Blu-ray version has gone a long way to changing my opinion. Sounds fantastic. This Blu-ray is a must have for any Jeff Beck fan",1237680000,,494,4.2105263157894735
3719917,5,B001NP8PQM,"wow wow wow..
after years of pretty much nothing on Beck as far as video...this is a monster package!
besides a 20+minute rockin rockabilly set with the Big Town Playboys we get an 8 minute interview with him about it..
another 30 minute  interview about his career and a massive set of over 21 tracks with fabulous sound and camera work...oh and Joss Stone and Eric Clapton stopping by...
I can't wait to stop writing and watch for a second time!
picked it up a bit early at a local shop ....and boy am I a happy happy guitar fan...
Amazon.com lists the set so no need to go into song titles..suffice it to say he hits many of the absolute must haves...and as I said..he is a master of tone and taste...his fingerstyle approach to his guitar is truly unique , oh others like Knopfler play with their fingers instead of a pick but Beck is really and truly a ""one off"" as  they say...
DVDs like this make me truly happy to have invested in my blu-ray player and HD tv...
rock on Jeff!!

UPDATE: the normal DVD of this title does NOT have the bonus Rockabilly set and interview for that set...so Blu-RAY is the way to go for  another reason.",1237507200,,1139,4.308411214953271
3719918,4,B001NP8PQM,"OK, sorry, unlike others I have had the advantage of an early release in Australia to actually review the DVD instead of the concert.  Sure I saw Jeff in concert at the Enmore Theatre in Sydney in January 2009 & it was an incredible show, but this is about the DVD filmed at the famous Ronnie Scott's jazz club in London in November 2007, not the concert.

The the DVD/Ronnie Scott show is very similar to the Jeff Beck 2008/2009 world concert tour, in terms of set-list & band personnel, but the DVD production doesn't seem to fully/properly capture the tour.  It's one of those ADD/ritalin (no offence intended) edits, if you know what I mean.

Jeff Beck is probably the greatest living WHITE guitarist, (the greatest living guitarist is Buddy Guy) but I felt that Eric Clapton stole the show on his guest appearance.  Jeff seems to have a magnanimous dimension to his personality & doesn't care about stuff like that, & all power to him for that attitude, it's all about the music with him, not personal aggrandisement, and so it should be.

EC appears on two numbers;  Muddy Waters' Little Brown Bird & Willie Dixon's You Need Love, as a brief ""relief scene"" (back into The Blues) as a counter/derivative of Jeff's stunning & peerless abstract jazz-rock sound-sculpture playing.

Clapton, as a life-long student/disciple of the blues seems to be proving a point (on You Need Love), shortly before the Led Zeppelin ""reunion"" shows, where it all really came from.  Thanks Ecca, it's a point well made!

Jeff has a stellar band of musicians & is able to faithfully create in a live setting the studio tracks.  As an Aussie I want to make special mention of youthful Australian bass playing prodigy Tal Wilkenfeld.  It's not only her beyond-years playing, but some of the expressions she gets on her face.  In particular, there is a guest appearance by Imogen Heap on Rollin' & Tumblin' where Tal's expression is just sublime.  Whilst Tal is a surprisingly experienced ""slave to the groove"" player, her expression on Rollin' & Tumblin' betrays a stunned disbelief in what they are actually doing on that track.

Having seen the actual live performace in concert (minus EC & guests), I prefer that to the DVD, but given this DVD is close to that performance, & there is bugger little other vision of The Rare (Beck) Bird of Paradise, my recommendation on this DVD is "" wrap it up!...""",1237507200,3,2383,4.722222222222222
3719919,5,B001NP8PQM,"Jeff Beck may be the only man over 60 who can get away with wearing a choker! Why? Because no one has such mastery of his instrument, so therefore, he can wear whatever he wants. NO ONE can play like this guy! It's all touch and taste, and his very mysterious whammy bar thumb technique, that has luminaries in the small club looking both amazed and delighted. The band has been touring together for over a year, and with Vinnie C. on drums, excellent song choices spanning his career, a few so so vocal appearances for people who can't take an hour of straight guitar, this THE DVD to have for anyone who likes music on DVD.

One need not look any further than the track ""Nadia"" to get the point of what a master he is. It's amazing people compare him to Clapton and Page, because there is no comparison. By the time he closes with the Beatles ""a day in the life"" it's time for guitarist to throw in the towel and realize they have just seen the tiger woods of guitar...",1235174400,47,971,4.2771739130434785
3719920,5,B001NP8PQM,"The overwhelming majority of this DVD consists of Jeff Beck's nonpareil guitar virtuosity. The instrumental performances that showcase his inimitable whammy bar mastery, tones, riffs and fretboard prowess include ""Becks Bolero"", ""Where Were You'"" Blast From The East,"" ""A Day In The Life,"" ""Stratus,"" ""Scatterbrain,"" ""Brush With The Blues,"" Big Block,"" and ""Angel(Footsteps)."" No other guitarist on the planet can strangle, coax and caress a universe of sounds from his instrument like the incomparable Jeff Beck. His guitar and bare fingers are fused and hardwired to his heart. Jeff Beck only uses his fingers and very few effects to summon majestic tones. There are sterling guest performances by Eric Clapton ""Little Brown Bird,"" ""You Need Love"" and Imogen Heap ""Rolling and Tumblin""  and ""Blanket"", and a soulful Joss Stone rendition of ""People Get Ready."" Not only is the music magical-so is the aura and ambience of Ronnie Scott's renowned Jazz Club in London. This DVD is all killer and no filler. An imperative purchase!!!!

Update. "" On January 31, 2010, Jeff Beck won a Grammy for his iconic instrumental performance on ""A Day In The Life.""",1234915200,132,1151,5.182795698924731
3719921,5,B001NP8PQM,"I can't wait for this DVD gig.  If the sound and playing is the same as on the CD then we Jeff Beck fans will be in heaven.  Great guitar player, very different from your standard RnR players but that is what makes him so great.  No cookie cutter stuff here.  The backing band seems like they got it going on also.  Like I said, can't wait for this one.",1234742400,,353,3.9857142857142858
3719922,5,B001NP8PQM,"Finally I have my own copy of this DVD and I was pleasantly surprised that this historic performance at the intimate Ronnie Scotts easily beats their amazing concert in Auckland. (I saw Jeff Beck, Vinnie Colaiuta, Tal Wilkenfeld and Dave Sancious rip through one of the most amazing one and half hours of spell-binding music when they played in Auckland at the end of their Australasian tour (3 February 2009). They pretty much covered all the songs on the Ronnie Scott set list although omitting `Space Boogie' and including I think a Tony Williams ""Lifetime"" track, that Tal seemed to lead.) Yet the DVD is even better because of three reasons:

1. The DVD allows you so close that you can see every action of Beck's playing (which even with binoculars I couldn't quite see at the concert)
2. There is greater variety in this concert in comparison with their tour as here there is the addition of soulful singing of guest artists. Joss Stone with 'People get ready', Imogen Heap with 'Blanket' and the driving 'Rollin'and Tumblin'' which provides opportunity for Becko to show his support and bluesy side.
3. This DVD records the historic magic of two blues songs sung and played by Eric Clapton and Becko...with Jimmy Page watching in the audience. Wow!

If you have only heard Jeff Beck then a live performance or this DVD, is a must. I had never seen Jeff Beck play before so was astounded to watch his unique style of brushing the strings with his thumb, caressing the whammy and combined with volume swells producing those tones that only he can do. As you'll see, he doesn't use a pick at all.

This is unique in that as far as I am aware this is the first full DVD concert of the drumming maestro, Vinnie Colaiuta (other than specialized Drumming festival DVDs). This intense rock fusion catalogue of Beck's is brilliant with its varied time signatures from reggae to poly-rhythm frenzy to showcase Vinnie's talents - but always within the context of the song and the music. Next to the diminutive figure of Jeff and Tal, Vinnie is a tall man and his enthusiasm, smiles and outright mastery capture and add to all the Richard Bailey, Simon Phillips and Terry Bozzio fills that we know from albums like `Blow by Blow', `Wired', 'Guitar shop' and the rest of the Beck catalogue. To hear Vinnie live is great - watching is an overwhelming marvel.

My only criticism of this DVD is that in the first few songs including 'Stratus', the camera work misses most of Vinnie's great fills. This is most frustrating and often the camera panned onto a watching Jeff or the face of a smiling Tal while missing sublime drumming. Fortunately this concert has a enough opportunity to see Vinnie at other times but generally the small venue meant that there are never great views of the drum kit. Fortunately this does not apply to the clear camera work on Jeff's fretboard.

Seeing the young Tal on bass melodically groove with these musos all at least 30 years older than her is like watching all the post-Woodstock generations salute the music that we have come to know as rock fusion. There is a sense of togetherness and fun as they all interact and watch each other. Jason Rebello is literally out of the picture for the first quarter of the concert but later takes a more prominent role and takes a number of great solos.

As usual Eagle Vision have exemplary production qualities and the sound, 5.1 and DTS, is magnificent.

Jeff, doesn't speak much other than to thank guest artists and the audience at the end. He just plays his heart out. Hammering, tapping, wrenching and bending strings, Jeff shows how far he has explored where his contemporaries of that generation have never ventured. This best value DVD is an historic showcase that salutes the master guitarist in top form still playing as if there are no tomorrows.",1233878400,13,3826,4.701492537313433

Vinny does a great job with the difficult ""Stratus""(b.cobham)  Tal has some solo work also. Joss Stone chimes in with sparkling vocals on ""people get ready"" followed immediatly by a hyperdrive version of 'scatterbrain'!!  Imogen Heap has a couple of great songs, incl. the classic..""rollin and tumblin''....(she  is 6-1..Jeff ISNT)-lol. Oh btw Eric Clapton sits in for a couple of real bluesy songs  at the end. What a show !!!!",1432771200,,617,5.202020202020202
3720043,5,B001NP8PQM,"This is the way performances should be filmed. It succeeds on so many levels that it's almost not worth writing about it....just BUY it. First and foremost, it is an excellent overview of the best of Jeff's many albums. Second, he is in fine form and is very gracious toward the audience and is having a blast with his band (as they are with him). The word ""joy"" is the best word to describe it, and you'll also see it on the faces of Jimmy Page and Robert Plant as they sit in the audience. There are three vocal performances on the DVD, including an encore with Eric Clapton, but the interplay between the band members is so tight that when the guests come out on stage it almost seems like an intrusion. In addition to virtuoso and Zappa alum Vinnie Colaiuta on drums, you get bass phenomenon Tal Wilkenfeld and keyboardist Jason Robello. Much has been written about Tal's age and gender but I think dwelling on that does her a disservice. Yes, she was 21 at the time of this show (Beck was 64), and yes, she is a ""female bass player,"" but so what? She more than holds her own here, especially among such heavyweights. You have to do your homework when you purchase Jeff's music...there have been hits like his ""Blow By Blow"" / ""Wired"" / ""There And Back"" trilogy, but there also have been some misses where things just didn't gel. In terms of what you probably want to hear from the man, this one is a 10 on a 10 scale.",1432598400,,1422,4.329588014981273

3720081,5,B001NP8PQM,"I am not quite sure I have the words to properly state how f***ing killer this show is. I have loved Jeff Beck since he left the Yardbirds. Two of my favorite albums were Blow by Blow and Wired but I kinda stopped listening to him when after the Jan Hammer stuff, not that it was bad, it just got a little too jazz fusion for me. I still wish he would get back together with Rod Stewart they were so good together and this show actually gives me hope for that. He seems to be much more open to working with vocalists. The tracks with Joss Stone and Imogen Heep are awesome as are the two he with Eric Clapton who is another one of my favorite guitar players and I hate to say it but Jeff Beck smokes him on those two songs. I think he is better now than he ever was, better than anybody ever was. This is some of the best guitar playing I have ever seen.
A I have seen almost every great guitar player out there. I'm 54 years old and have been going to concerts since I was 15.
I saw Jeff Beck in 1980 and 82. Anyway I could go on and on about this show but I have to go back to work so I will simply say If you like guitar buy this Blu-ray. Picture perfect. Sound perfect. Band perfect. Bonus tracks awesome. I swear to GOD if I could give this 10 stars I would.",1407196800,6,1263,3.9182879377431905

3720109,5,B001NP8PQM,"Jeff Beck is, for me, the most creative electric guitar player of all time. See hime live, if you haven't, and you will know the truth.
This is a journey from ""Beck's Bolero"",through his fusion career, and onward.
The band is top notch, the venue small, and intimate,the playing flawless,and.
then there is a benchmark piece-Jeff's modified version of Lennon/McCartney's ""A Day In The Life"".He pulls deep from his artistic repertoire, and creates a musical masterpiece, for which he deservingly so, was awarded a grammy.
You might not like all the styles on this recording, however there is no argument that Jeff, is Jeff-over the top,creative,genius, master of less is more, and where did you find that octave?

It also has a fantastic couple songs with he and Clapton. Two of rock's guitar gods. There is a reason why Beck is considered one of the greats - watch it and you'll understand. Also a couple songs and great footage with Imogen Heap. She is amazing on vocals. Probably the greatest version of Rollin' and Tumblin' that i have ever heard and i have about 12 versions in my itunes. i saw this performance late one night and recorded on my vcr. i watched many times.

For a video capturing a live performance in a relatively small jazz night club in 2007, the visual and audio quality is outstanding.

He's played with some of the greatest bands ever, with most of the greatest guitar players ever, and by many accounts sits on top of that heap alone.

She looked so out of place.  And yet she belongs wholeheartedly.  What an amazing talent that complements the whole band and IMO makes the whole performance all that much more enjoyable to watch.  Great chemistry with her there.  Beck is amazing, the drummer is amazing.  Imogen Heap's appearance is amazing. Great show and great to have in my collection.",1375747200,,518,4.677777777777778

This DVD is among one of the finest and most enjoyable concerts I have seen.  Since it is recorded and filmed in a small club venue, the atmosphere is  intimate and we practically feel as if we are in the audience.

The video ranges from okay to very good, but it's the sound that makes this a killer set. It sounds good enough that I invited some friends over to watch in in my HT (JBL Synthesis One Array) and they were drooling idiots by the end. (And no, they're not drooling idiots all the time.)

The best part about the video portion is it shows some of the interplay and camaraderie among the musicians and also highlights Jeff Beck's phenomenal technique from time-to-time.

Female Australian bassist Tal Wilkenfeld, whose funky bass lines and style keeps time to Beck's own frenetic playing.

Drummer Vinnie Colaiuta,with his ferocious technique,impeccable timing and his boundless energy lays down the structure.

Keyboardist Jason Rebello ""allows everyone room to breath and like the other members of the band, never overwhelms the song. When he breaks free on ""Scatterbrain,"" you just marvel at what he plays.""

Guests include:

Eric Clapton
Joss Stone
Imogen Heap

And of course, Jeff Beck, ""The Governor"", who effortlessly continues to rule the guitar world with his technique and jaw-dropping ability, transcending space and time.

DVD Track Listing:

1) Beck's Bolero 2) Eternity's Breath 3) Stratus 4) Cause We've Ended As Lovers 5) Behind The Veil 6) You Never Know 7) Nadia 8) Blast From The East 9) Led Boots 10) Angel (Footsteps) 11) People Get Ready - with JOSS STONE 12) Scatterbrain 13) Goodbye Pork Pie Hat / Brush With The Blues 14) Space Boogie 15) Blanket - with IMOGEN HEAP 16) Big Block 17) A Day In The Life 18) Little Brown Bird - with ERIC CLAPTON 19) You Need Love - with ERIC CLAPTON 20) Rollin' And Tumblin' - with IMOGEN HEAP 21) Where Were You

When you think about a Jeff Beck concert, first thing that comes to mind is ""Im going to witness guitar work par excellence"", but after watching this concert DVD you come away with a wider perspective. The tight musicianship, the melding of music and melody, soulful energy, complimenting arrangements and stellar individual as well as collective performances.

The musicianship is like an atom, central nucleus(Jeff Beck) surrounded by a cloud of charged electrons(his band mates). The electrons of an atom are bound to the nucleus by the electromagnetic force. And this is what this concert is all about, force and energy.

I had the good fortune to see Jeff Beck live at the Casino New Brunswick last year. This was my first time seeing Jeff Beck live after years of following his career. I sat there six rows back with Jeff taking his position right in front of where we were sitting. To say that this was one of the highlights of my life would be an understatement.",1348444800,2,2248,4.828125
3720153,5,B001NP8PQM,If you are true Jeff Beck fan you will love this dvd. Jeff Beck in a small venue. He is upclose and personal with audience. The special guest are amazing too.,1347494400,,158,4.129032258064516
3720154,5,B001NP8PQM,"In this wonderful recording from Ronnie Scott's jazz club, released in 2008, Jeff Beck delivers an absolutely definitive demonstration of guitar techniques coupled with a remarkable level of musical and sonic imagination. There are many fine guitarists on the world stage but few can match Beck's equal mastery of so many varied and differing genres including blues, rock, jazz, soul, funk, reggae and Asian influences - and all heard to perfection on this inspired night.

The four-piece band features the outstanding talents of Vinnie Colaiuta on drums, Jason Rebello on keyboards and the new sensation on bass, the talented young Tal Wilkenfield from Australia. The Stevie Wonder 'Cause we've ended as lovers' is a good track to sample the multi-talented line-up, but every track is a winner in its own way.

The guest artists, Joss Stone, Imogen Heap and Eric Clapton all make valuable contributions and there is a very enjoyable extended extra bonus with 7 items featuring the opening set played by the Rockability Band who all happened to be in London at the time and who reprise an earlier disc which had never before been played 'live'.

Eagle Rock has provided a recording with involving camera work with crisp imaging. The sound is presented in excellent  DTS 5.1, DD 5.1 and stereo.

This will give enormous pleasure to anyone to whom the program appeals and is a perfect example of Jeff Beck at the very top of his considerable game. For purchasers such as those this will be an unmissable 5 star release.",1346803200,3,1517,4.933333333333334
3720155,5,B001NP8PQM,"Eric Clapton rates Jeff Beck the greatest guitarist of them all, and this is the only time I've seen Clapton play backup to anyone's lead.  There is not a note that leaves his Fender Strat that Jeff Beck does not intend. What a performance. Tal Wilkenfeld on bass lights up this DVD and Vinnie Colaiuta's manic work on the drums is reminiscent of Keith Moon.  Joss Stone is adequate on ""People Get Ready"", but Imogen Heap is smoking' on ""Blanket"" and ""Rollin' and Tumblin"".

A day in the life is pure genius.",1339113600,2,376,4.544117647058823
3720157,5,B001NP8PQM,"Jeff Beck has consistently been mentioned as one of the great guitarists, but I wasn't too sure what to expect. I think my primary thought about him, over the years, was that he was 'the other guy' in the Yardbirds.

That thought has changed. Perhaps it was Eric Clapton who was 'the other guy'!

This was a virtuoso performance, right up there with the best I've seen. The variety of playing styles Jeff Beck uses are an amazement and a delight; the rest of the band is first rate and the interaction between Beck and the sexy, incredibly talented bassist Tal Wilkenfield was great fun. I'm so glad I rented this DVD and I just might have to buy it so I can watch it over and over again.

3720158,5,B001NP8PQM,"I am not a fan of Jeff Beck or at least I wasn't until I watched this.  The whole performance is incredible from beginning to end and this is a moment of pure genius by the best guitarist in the world.  Not only does he create amazing songs but he plays them to a level which is astounding.  I am a fan of Michael Schenker and Eddie Van Halen who are both brilliant but Jeff Beck has an extraordinary talent which puts him on a whole new level plus he brings into his music other musicians who are talented in their own right.  The drummer, keyboardist, bass player and singers he uses are all world class musicians and his choice of songs is perfect.

This performance was in a club and he was literally a few feet away from the audience so everyone can see every note he plays so there wasn't room to make any mistakes and he totally pulls it off.  I will not go into describing each individual song because this has probably been done already but this is a world class performance by an amazing guitarist but it is also a superb performance by a great band.  The only weakness in the show is the part where Eric Clapton sings but it was meant to be light-heart-ed so I was OK with it.  I did like Eric's guitar playing and they both work well together.

Don't hesitate, just go out and get this!",1336867200,4,1298,4.222672064777328

3720160,5,B001NP8PQM,"I'll make this quick... Jeff still has that ""it"" thing, whatever it is.

His band is stellar, with young star bassist Tal Wilkinfeld making her presence felt again. There are touches of most of Beck's catalog here. Sometimes I watch Beck play and think he is amazingly sloppy, but in this DVD he corrals all of that into the energy that makes you listen in awe of how he hears things.

Joss Stone drops in for a tune, always a treat to see and hear her. I was thinking this was one of the high points of the DVD until...

Imogen Heap comes out, appearing to be about 7 feet tall among the folks surrounding her. During the night, this is the only point that really challenges Beck for true focus on the stagefront. She is awesome in every tune she does, and is captivating to watch perform. She and Beck play so well off of each other that you would think they should record together.

Eric Clapton stops in for a few songs, and shows he also is still in that elite group that founded the British blues invasion.

Definitely worth a viewing!",1332460800,,1041,4.345360824742268
3720161,5,B001NP8PQM,"I run this Blu-Ray over and over and just love it.  I've known of Jeff Beck for decades but I didn't really start paying close attention until I added guitar to my instruments a couple years or so ago.  The immersive quality of this video is really something...lots of tight shots and great editing give you not just which-finger-is-Beck-doing-what-with details but also a feel for all the players' personalities.  With no one is this more evident than the very solid and talented bassist Tal Wilkenfeld, whose face is caught lighting up like a Christmas tree time and again.  Also especially noteworthy is keyboardist Jason Rebello, who was known mostly for his piano work up to this point but was able to cop the Jan Hammer lead-synth role in this band quite admirably.  The inclusion of Clapton and vocalists Imogen Heap and Joss Stone help break up the proceedings for the benefit of the non-guitar-worshipers.

I recommend this Blu-Ray highly; a wonderful document of a wonderful guitarist in a perfect up-close setting.",1332201600,2,1025,4.964912280701754
3720162,5,B001NP8PQM,"As another friend pointed out who's also seen Beck many times live, as I have, Jeff's tone is more subdued than it used to be years ago. Maybe that's because the venue is so small and intimate (yes, I've been there), or because he just likes that tone now.  But I don't mind as the cleaner tone allows for more subtly and nuance to shine through than the type of bigger sound we've seen at the big venues.

Getting great tight shots of his technique is awesome, love the editing.  The sound is quite good.  Overall one of the best produced live DVDs I've seen.  No messing around with artistic crap in the video, I want to feel like I'm right there in the front row watching every lick, and this DVD delivers.

If you've followed Beck over his long career, it's great to see that he's still got it at this age, and if you've never seen him, do yourself a favor and check it out.  He's one of the few Jedi masters of guitar out there with chops that are wholly unique.  Not many guys shape each note the way he does.  It's almost like every note has to be perfect for him or why bother?",1330560000,,1085,4.177884615384615

3720166,5,B001NP8PQM,"Check out all the five star reviews that have been written here.  I just can't write anything that would add to what has already been written.  All I can say is that I have seen literally hundreds of concerts and live shows in both large and small venues over many years (from the 1960's to the present), and this is one that I would have given my eye teeth to see.  Jeff Beck is the real thing, and certainly a legend in his own time.  Just go ahead and buy this DVD for a lousy $14 and find out for yourself just how good this man and his world class band look, and sound on your home theater.  Don't read anymore reviews, you're wasting time when you could be punching the ""add to cart"" button on your monitor.  Please have it sent 2 day shipping, or better yet, next day shipping, and wait with baited breath for the package to arrive.  It's ok, you'll thank me later!",1322524800,,872,4.18562874251497

3720169,5,B001NP8PQM,Jeff Beck is a master and this video contains a great selection of material. The venue is nice and intimate. The band is assume. Vinnie is at the top of the list for drummers. Tal is a perfect match for Jeff. And the keyboard player does a great job of background. The guest singers really add a new element.,1319846400,,308,4.237288135593221

the concert is great too, including five or six songs that just blew me away",1319241600,,199,4.102564102564102
3720171,5,B001NP8PQM,Love this performance. Jeff has a top notch band. All the players are entertaining showmen and virtuoso musicians. The camera work is really good showing Jeff's hands a lot so you can see his extraordinary technique. My son an aspiring guitarist watched this with me and while he wasn't totally convinced by the bluesy simplicity of the music (he likes strong melodic artists like Yes and Rush). I knew the video impacted him because the next time I saw him on the guitar he had lost the pic and I haven't seen him use a pic again.

And this is perhaps the essential DVD for seeing Beck working his fingerpicking magic. (Hates picks, does Jeff.) And lovely young Tal is an amazing bassist, to boot. Even if you don't buy this, at least Netflix it. Clapton in '85: ""I think of Jeff as probably being the finest guitar player I'd ever seen. And I've been around.""",1316304000,,484,4.705882352941177

My only criticism (very minor) is that during the fastest version of ""Scatterbrain"" I have ever heard they didn't show Beck's guitar work much. I would have enjoyed seeing ""how the heck he does it."" I hope Jeff does more of this type of material on upcoming albums.",1315008000,,379,4.588235294117647

Many of us out there have known this for years!  He seems to be having a great time as well, which makes the video even more enjoyable.  There is also a really cute female bassist that can wail on the bass!  I wish he would come somewhere near me, because I only have seen him once...  If you are a Jeff Beck fan - get it.

3720186,5,B001NP8PQM,"The past couple of years have been golden for me in regard to music -- my ""discovery"" of Derek Trucks and, later, Susan Tedeschi, the Clapton 2010 Crossroads DVD, and laugh if you will, The Pretenders ""Live in London"" blu-ray.  For differing reasons I love all of them, but the one DVD that I keep returning to over and over is Jeff Beck's ""Live at Ronnie Scott's.""

There may be one or two guitarists who have greater technical versatility.  I doubt it, but maybe.  But I can't think of any of whom are able to get more out of their guitar than Jeff Beck.  Every note is rounded, enhanced, pushed and pulled to get just the right sound.  It's incredible to hear him play. Since there are no technical skills that he hasn't mastered, the only limit is his improvisational imagination, and there's no limit to that, either

The band?  The drummer is incredible -- Colaiuta lays down a barrage of thunder in ""Stratus"" that is peerless.  Rebello is always there in ways subtle and profound.  And Tal Wilkenfeld?  OMG, she's, what, early 20s?  A structural genius who is already at the top.  I can't even dimly imagine what she'll be doing by the time she's in her 50s.  I only wish that I could be alive to hear her then.

Just to close by saying that ""Stratus,"" ""'Cause We've Ended As Lovers,"" and ""Behind the Veil"" is the best 3-song series I've ever heard.  Ever.

I agree with another reviewer who said he wants this music played at his funeral.  If they do that at mine, I'll rise and dance again.",1299715200,4,1499,4.448529411764706

His band is a well oiled machine that flows with him on every tune. The featured singers Joss Stone and Imogene Heap are superb! Then to top it all off a couple numbers with none other than Eric Clapton where the two show their massive talents. Now I know why it has been stated, BECK IS GOD!

I have always put Hendrix at the top of the heap and everyone else below.  Now I think there is room for two guitar Gods for me on the top podium.  His guitar is literally his voice. This DVD is amazing.  If you haven't seen his performances on the 2007 and 2010 Crossroads DVDs by Clapton, get them as well.  He steals both shows in my opinion.",1296086400,,613,4.342105263157895

He is *so* talented and imaginative... yet humble, like when he acknowledges the performances of the other band members during the concert, and appreciates the applause from the crowd at the end of it. A virtuoso, and humble to boot... pretty rare combination. And the band members are just as awesome... Tal Wilkenfeld on bass, Vinnie Colaiuta on drums, and Jason Rebello on keyboards- all excellent musicians that put together some fine solos during the concert. Simply great stuff from everybody.

The video and audio on this disc are excellent- no problems with either of them as far as I'm concerned (though 96/24 hi-res audio is always nice when you can get it). And there are some interesting folks in the audience- such as Plant and Page of Led Zeppelin fame... as well as some special 'guest artists' that perform with Jeff and his crew during the concert. In total, just a great concert experience... I would give it two bonus stars if I could!",1288396800,2,1113,4.737113402061856

3720196,5,B001NP8PQM,"Some reviewers could offer criticism of techical aspects of this, or any, DVD but I am unlikely to unless some deficiencies subtracted from the viewer's enjoyment. I didn't find anything distracting any of the 3 times I've watched it so far. What I DID find was some of the most inventive, soulful & alive guitar playing I've ever heard, regardless of genre - and not being concerned about what genre he fits in at any given moment is one of my other favorite things about Jeff Beck. Now add to that a superb band - the lot of 'em: Vinnie on drums, Tal on bass, and Jason on keys - who play as if they've ALWAYS played together. Add, on top of that, a wildly inventive and varying set of tunes - more genius whether it's an original or a Lennon/McCartney song or Stevie Wonder's, whether it's a slow, sensitive blues or a cranking rocker. Overall, the playing, both individually and collectively, is heavenly and the production does not distract from that in any way.

As far as guests go, all 3 (Joss Stone, Imogen Heap, and Eric Clapton) do a great job as well. The bonus interviews, particularly with Beck himself, are also a ""hoot"" as some of us say. But at the end of the day, and the end of the show, the star is Jeff Beck. And he is one of a kind, as displayed throughout!",1287014400,,1279,4.351464435146443

3720198,5,B001NP8PQM,"Amazing, totally absorbing performance.  Even if you're not familiar with Jeff Beck you'll be completely drawn-in to this night club performance.  I stumbled onto this show in progress on cable, watched it to the end, got on my PC and ordered a copy of the BluRay disk, along with a copy of ""Wired"".  The performance is so good, so enjoyable you'll want to watch this over and over.

I'm not a long-term hard-core Jeff Beck fan, previously owning only a single CD.  This performance BR disk is a totally different experience from listening to a CD.  Beck's band is composed of truly world-class players, all of whom are fascinating performers.  Regardless of what instrument you play, or even if you don't play, each performer is truly interesting.  When this disk is playing, you will watch it, not treat it as background music.

My single issue with the show is the fact the bass and keyboards are mixed too far in the background.  It's clear the bassist is a phenomenal player (who looks to be 16 but is in her early 20's) but it's difficult to hear the bass line.  The keyboard player is doing a lot over there, but it's difficult to identify just what, sometimes.

If you have any interest in guitar of any genre, buy this BluRay.",1281830400,,1235,4.589041095890411

What many do not know, was, ""and this was aired on 60 minutes"", A very influential ""organization"", offered to buy Mr. Becks recording contract, offering him incentives such as ""cocaine"",etc, as to which he refused. After several attempts, and finally intimidation tactics, stating his career would be ruined, Mr. Beck would not compromize. This is should be applauded. As far as his guitar playing, ""go change your diaper Mr. Van Halen""! I am not the greatest review writer, but to any young up ang coming guitar players, please give Mr. Beck a listen.

3720200,5,B001NP8PQM,"Since the early days with The Tridents and The Yardbirds Jeff Beck has been innovating to the point of making the electric guitar an extension of his body.  Beck has gone through differents styles and territories, sometime he is on the rock field and soon after he is playing funk, jazz rock o even reggae: Beck has no boundaries as he is constantly changing.  Without having a huge following he is one of the most respected musicians around, even by his own colleagues like Jimmy Page (he is seen on the video) and Eric Clapton.

This DVD is a great example of all the above as we can see Beck on differents stages and styles, doing a fantastic quick resume of his carreer as a musician, something like a presentation card.

Beck is wise enough to get musicians that made the perfect mixture between experience and quality (V. Colaiuta an ex Zappa member) and freshness (T. Wilkenfeld) and not forgetting the keyboard player (J Rebello) that thanks to the current technology can jump to a Minimoog sound with just sliding a couple of knobs so he can match Jan Hammer duets with Beck.  He does a great work (great subtle Hammond organ playing as well).

By the way Beck's 2010 tour band shows another great move including now Narada Michael Walden on Drums and Rhonda Smith on bass (ex Prince musician).

A special mention to guest artist.  This shows once again, along with the play list, a perfect mixture of old and new, experience and freshness.  Joss Stone, Imogen Heap and Eric ""Slow Hand"" Clapton fit perfectly in this unique film concert.  By the way I like Rod Stewart vocals on People Get Ready, but sorry Rod this time you are the first runner up.

Don't forget to see / listen Jeff interview that gives lots of clues and information about this talented guitarrist's guitarrist (as he is currently refered to)

If you are into Jeff Beck then you must have this DVD and if you don't then give it a chance you won't be dissappointed, you can't.",1280707200,,1953,4.580459770114943

I've always been a 'casual' fan of Jeff Beck's as I'm not a huge fan of Jazz/fusion, however the best concert I ever saw was the Beck/Jan Hammer band in the mid 70's.

Jeff Beck, to me just seems to translate better when you can see him play.  Besides being the best guitarist I've heard live I like the fact that he seems to be so 'grounded'.. (unlike some of the narcissist guitarists of his day) and this concert and the bonus material really seem to show that.

I can't argue with the beginning introductions that say these are some of the best musicians in the world.. It's a concert not to be missed, even if you are a casual fan. The tracks with Imogen Heap and Joss Stone are just incredible, as are the DTS sound and Blu-ray picture quality.",1280275200,,864,4.415094339622642

The audio section (and video) of this disc is superb. Every instrument is clean and distinct; the imaging like you were right there watching and listening. The level of musicianship is amazingly good and thankfully, done justice by the quality of the blu ray production (I am referring to the DTS-HD Master Audio track).  If you are a Jeff Beck fan, purchasing this blu ray should be a no brainer. If you aren't familiar with him but are looking for something to show off your system, this is the disc to get.

Jeff Beck is hands-down the best, most creative, most musical guitarist playing today, and the chemistry between him and the others in the band--especially bass player Tal Wilkenfeld--is thrilling to watch. This live version of ""Cause We've Ended As Lovers"" (including Wilkenfeld's utterly inspired solo) totally eclipses the studio version on ""Blow by Blow"" (which Clapton said was his favorite Beck track), and ""Stratus"" is just mind-numbing. I would give this one six stars if I could.",1276300800,,544,5.488095238095238
3720208,5,B001NP8PQM,"I should point out that I have never claimed to be a huge Jeff Beck fan. I own maybe half a dozen CDs of his, but I never really kept up with his work. On top of that, I never listed him as one of my favorite guitarists (although I do consider him a great guitarist).
That being said, I had heard and read a lot of great things about this disc, so I decided to pick it up. Needless to say, I do not regret this decision in the least. First, the audio and video quality on this disc is amazing, akin to the Return to Forever Live at Montreaux BD. Of course, not to be outdone by the film and sound crew, the performance is outstanding, with a nice blend of rock, jazz, and fusion selections, and is sure to please even the most casual Jeff Beck fan. In fact, even if you're just a fan of music you'd probably get enjoyment out of this disc. Accompanying Jeff in the core band for this performance is Jason Rebello on keyboards, my second favorite Zappa drummer Vinnie Colaiuta (second to T. Bozzio IMO), and the extremely talented and very cute Tal Wilkenfeld on bass. Guest appearances include Joss Stone, Imogen Heap, and Eric Clapton.
Also, as a bonus (exclusive to the Blu-ray), you get a shorter Rockabilly set with Jeff and the Big Town Playboys as sort of an opening performance (if you watch it first, which I did not).
In any case, if you're a fan of good musical performances, I highly recommend this disc. If you're a fan of Jeff Beck, it's a no-brainer.",1275264000,2,1464,4.2888086642599275

As it turns out this is a diverse selection of songs, not merely fusion.  The vocals by Imogen Heap and Joss Stone on 3 of the tracks are outstanding.  I like the blues songs the best.  The inclusion of Eric Clapton on 2 tracks was incredible.  As I listened I was drawn in by how wonderfully played this music was.  Beck has never sounded better.  I think Tal said it all in the interview, ""musicality"".  Beck and the band will astound you with their masterful and emotionally driven playing. I've listened to this DVD over again several times and I am just blown away by Beck's mastery. He challenges the listener; he drives you to the edge, and always brings you back. They have truly mastered the art of expression with this one. THE BEST MUSIC PURCHASE I HAVE EVER MADE!",1273968000,,886,4.425925925925926

3720212,5,B001NP8PQM,"For anyone that is into music or has never seen Jeff Beck play. This is in my opinion some of his best work on guitar that by the way  he uses his fingers instead of a pick to get incredible sounds as he has for years.he is joined by another former Yardbird Eric Clapton so their dual lead guitar is nothing short of outstanding.the two and a half hour video is great,second only to Claptons Crossroads tour that also  boasts a multitude of talent in which the DVD has some of.

long story short this is highly recommended.oh and the one on one interview is good too",1273536000,,566,4.271028037383178
3720213,5,B001NP8PQM,"I'll keep this brief but this DVD is a must have for the guitar fan.  If your idea of guitar nirvana is a hair-band shredding robotic scales at blinding speed then you will need to look elsewhere for your bliss.  Jeff Beck is nothing if not a master of good taste, selecting notes judiciously then caefully bending, stroking and coaxing them to speak a sonic language all his own.  He walks effortlessly between the disparate worlds of rock, jazz and pop.  Joined by guest vocalists Joss Stone and Imogene Heep the performance is well divided into rock, jazz, and fusion instrmental journeys interspersed with moving, crowd-pleasing songs.  I especially enjoyed Imogene Heep's hauntingly soulful renditions.  The rhythm section comprises drum virtuoso Vinny Colaiuta and the seemingly pubescent Tal Wilkenfeld a young curly-haired bass prodigy for whom Mr. Beck displays obvious admiration and encouragement.  The venue is warm and cozy, the audience respectful and appreciative and the acoustics (whether natural or the result of post-production magic) come across as clean and dynamic.  I even think I noticed a certain Robert Plant among the audience members! If you enjoy experiencing a seasoned and mellowed master of his craft perform with dexterous inventiveness in an intimate setting among close friends - performers of the highest caliber themselves - the I cannot recommend this DVD more highly.

I've been a fan of Jeff Beck since the early 60's and because you don't see him very often I had to own this DVD. Jeff Beck is like the father of machine gun guitarists but it isn't so much that he can rip a rift like lightening he is also the very cleanest of guitarists.  The man generally doesn't use a guitar pick but you wouldn't know it as every note rings out beautifully and clear. If you like classic rock you have to own this DVD. If you like progressive or fusion rock you have to own this DVD.  If you like light jazz (I mean jazz that still carries a melody line)you have got to own this DVD.  See the DVD description for the guests he has appearing with him and the track listing because if you've ever been a Jeff Beck fan there is a track just for you.  If you are really a Jeff Beck fan there are like 17 tracks just for you.  Buy this DVD, there is no way you'll be disappointed.",1271203200,,980,3.9242424242424243

This band obviously enjoys playing together, and are all superb musicians. There is something for everyone on this effort, from heavy jazz fusion to reggae, blues, and gospel. There is also a very nice transition from high energy to slow and mellow. I personally loved the killer rendition of Billy Cobham's Stratus that Jeff does. Every song played in the intimate, acoustically perfect setting is stellar. This one is more than worth it!",1270771200,,555,4.791666666666667

This DVD captures Jeff Beck showing his best, without the high volume that you would think that he would need to use the whammy bar skills that he has.  Jeff shows off the best of his band while not stealing the complete show.  I have been a fan since the 1968 Truth album.  This DVD showed me that I should have followed him more closely, than just buying the odd album or CD since then.

This DVD is really worth having in your collection.  The guest vocalists are terrific.  Having Eric Clapton was great. The only other guitarist that could touch Jeff's skill is Satriani.  The interviews with Jeff were great.",1268611200,,731,4.526717557251908

I bought it here on Blu Ray, and after viewing it in 1080p, I was floored. On a 62"" screen with surround, it was easy to immerse yourself in the performance, and wow! What a performance!  Jeff's whole band is unbelievable, (especially the child-like waif of a bass player) and Jeff's skills are jaw dropping.  The set of rockabilly tunes in the ""extras"" section on the Blu Ray are almost worth the price of admission on their own.  Standout tracks to me are ""Because We've Ended As Lovers"" and ""A Day In The Life"".  This disc is the first time I've heard Imogene Heap sing, and I must say, she is striking.

3720227,5,B001NP8PQM,"If you were interested in a musical group or individual back in the 1960's and 70's, you waited until you could: 1) See the act live in concert; 2) buy the record album or tape; 3) Wait for them to be on The Midnight Special, Don Kirchner's Rock Concert, American Bandstand, Ed Sullivan or a late night show, or 4) read about them in the printed media. I had collected the "" Truth "", "" Beck-Ola "", "" Jeff Beck Group "", "" Beck Bogart Appice "", and "" Blow By Blow"" albums but nothing since. I happened to see Jeff Beck on a video clip from [...] and was blown away. Having played drums for 40+ years, I have played with some very talented musicians both in the studio and onstage. Nobody, and I mean nobody can get the sounds from a guitar like Mr. Jeff Beck. You really have to see this DVD to believe what you're hearing. His band is one of the finest ever. You get the best seat in the house and don't have to travel to England. What could be better? So, get the popcorn ready, sit back and prepare to be amazed!!!",1265068800,,1015,4.105527638190955
3720228,5,B001NP8PQM,"I've been a guitarist for three decades and have always appreciated Jeff Beck, though some other guitarists have admittedly appealed to me more.  Nevertheless, I had to give this DVD a try, and my expectations and hopes were far surpassed.  I was reminded why Beck is deservedly a legend, and indeed still going strong.  His style uniquely blends rock, jazz, blues, and much more, and his artistic expression reaches the level of complete virtuosity.  He doesn't simply play the guitar, but rather makes it a material extension of his soul.  I was deeply moved many times during this performance, and there are moments of tender beauty so subtle you could almost cry.  Simply put, I was blown away.  Beck is truly a creative original, and there will never again be another quite like him.

Of course most of the credit for this magnificent performance has to go to Beck, but let's not altogether forget his excellent supporting band.  Vinnie Colaiuta is himself a legendary drummer of seemingly limitless ability, and he works so hard that he winds up drenched in sweat.  Tal Wilkenfield is a bassist who looks 14 years old, but plays like she's three times that age (and understandably seems totally stoked to be part of this band).  Jason Robello delivers the goods on keyboards, capably alternating between support and solos as his role requires.  And the guest artists are also a nice touch, with Joss Stone and Imogen Heap delivering vocals which nicely complement the band, and Eric Clapton serving as icing on the cake (it's great to see these legends honoring each other by performing together).

This performance was surely magical for those in attendance, and this DVD captures a decent helping of that magic for the rest of us.  I highly recommend it to all guitarists as both a master class and a profound experience, and others who enjoy this type of music should check it out also.",1264896000,3,1895,4.826625386996904

Add all of that to the rediculous playing of Jeff Beck and the band members and this is one of the most exiting bits of music I've ever heard or seen. Keep in mind that I have been a musician for 38 years and have been listening to Beck,Mahavishnu,etc... since the early days. The drummer on the video (Vinnie Colaiuta) is an amazing drummer who really nailed Cobham's style when appropriate on this video. You will not be dissapointed.",1264636800,,564,4.53921568627451

It is basically rock guitar, but as pure and mature and eclectic and absolutely stunning as one can imagine.  The performances by the female vocalists are also stunningly artistic and captivating.  If you have always been a fan of electric guitar, this performance will absolutely glue your eyes and ears to the TV for 2 hours without blinking.  I was left with a feeling like watching an Olympic gymnast pulling off a perfect 10 on his or her floor exercise; stuck every landing and with confidence and flair throughout, having just done things you never thought humanly possible.

3720234,5,B001NP8PQM,"One night back in May 2009 I was out late partying. When I got home I was still in the mood for couple more beers, so I popped on the HD music channel on my cable system (Palladia I think it's called?), and I came across Jeff Beck jamming with this wicked-awesome drummer and some young looking girl (that I thought was probably his daughter) just shredding a bass guitar to pieces.

The next morning I woke up to quite a hangover. I had stayed up, watched the whole show, and probably washed down the 6 beers that I had at the party with 6 more watching the Beck performance. So my memory of the show was vague, but also that it was great, although I thought that maybe I enjoyed it more than I otherwise would have because of the alcohol. So I picked it up at Amazon the day or so after...and promptly forgot about watching it again...until recently. I watched this Blu Ray disk last weekend and then again this past weekend. Jeff Beck Live at Ronnie Scott's is one of the best rock performances that I've ever seen.

This 2007 show should be held up not only as an example of the way a rock group should perform live, but also as an example for DVD music producers on how to deliver an excellent product. The concert is all musical performance. No indulgence by some videographer that thinks a viewer wants to see effects like cut to black and white, psyschedelic swirling pictures, quick frame to frame edits or other video effects. Long shots of the individual performers dominate the screen throughout and capture not only the great talents of the players, but also the intimacies between the bandmates that are often missed in other DVD musical shows.

For this performance at Ronnie Scott's, Beck was accompanied by Vinnie Colaiuta on drums, Jason Rebello on keyboards, and Tal Wilkenfeld on bass guitar. Beck is completely on throughout the show as are his mates. Colaiuta lays down some impossible beats and chops. Wilkenfield blows away many of the bass guitarists that I have on my list of the best. And Rebello is in top form on the keys.

The picture and sound are terrific. If you've got a surround system, you're in for a pounding Rock experience. The sound has an amazing 5.1 mix. Most importantly, like I mentioned earlier, the video doesn't jump around every 4 seconds, so you really get to see the performance in a way that feels like you're in a front row seat right there at Ronnie Scott's.

I could write the set list for you here, but not only is it right here on the Amazon product page for you already, would you really know any of the songs by their titles? I mean a devoted Beck fan probably would, but I've never even heard any of these compositions until I saw them on the DVD. I will say that there are 5 songs with guest performers: one with Joss Stone; two with Imogen Heap; and two with Eric Clapton. Now you might think, ""Clapton! Holy Moly...what a show stopper!"" But that would be completely incorrect. I'd even endanger a No-Vote to this review by going as far to say that the guest performances are skipable compared to what Beck's band does on its own for 16 of the total 21 songs on this DVD. But please don't skip the guest performances; they are definitely worth a viewing...at least the first time you watch the show.

In the Extras on the Blu Ray version you also get a Rockabilly set with Beck and the Big Town Playboys. I was able to watch one or two songs in this performance before I quickly shut it off so as not to ruin the amazing impression that I was left with from the main performance. Rockabilly is not my thing.

Any Rock fan will enjoy this disk immensely. Any Jazz fan will enjoy this disk immensely. Any music fan is making an immense mistake by passing on this disk. Add Jeff Beck Live at Ronnie Scott's to your collection.",1264377600,21,3785,4.437410071942446
3720235,5,B001NP8PQM,"This is a great DVD.  If you even remotely like Jeff Beck, it's worth the money and then some.  Don't forget to pick out Robert Plant and Jimmy Page in the audience.  Can't say enough about this concert.  Buy it.",1264032000,3,212,4.225

Tal Wilkenfeld was an unexpected treat~!  Very glad to find this dvd with more of this band.
Indoors in a small club Tal was just amazing.  She is mega-cute and slings bass with the best.
The set list covers a wide area and Jeff continues his reputation for playing in a style no one can come close to.  Keys and drums are equally astounding.  There is no possible way you cannot enjoy this show.

3720241,5,B001NP8PQM,"It didn't take me long after reading that at long last Jeff Beck had released a DVD for me to order this. But it did take me a while to fully appreciate the rare musical treat that is Performing This Week: Live at Ronnie Scott's.  For one thing, with nearly two and a half hours of music its hard to find time to enjoy it in one sitting. But now that the holidays are upon us, I have been able to give this the close attention it deserves.
I admit to having been a sometimey Jeff Beck fan. Actually, I hadn't heard anything new of his since his mid-seventies heyday but thought of albums like Blow By Blow and Wired with delight when this DVD appeared on my horizon. Since this has been reviewed to death and mostly positively, I am not going to analyze it but rather just put in my two cent's worth on what I like and do not like.
First you have to know that Beck's band is spectacular and his play seems particularly sharp. My favorite cuts here are: Beck's Bolero, Cause We've Ended As Lovers, Behind the Veil, Scatterbrain, Goodbye Pork Pie Hat/Brush With the Blues, Blanket, Big Block, an interesting A Day In the Life, and the Little Brown Bird duet with Eric Clapton. What don't I like? Well, I think People Get Ready has no place here and I did not particularly care for Rollin' and Tumblin'. Other than those two, this is a pretty mesmerizing set. As for the Beck interview, I have yet to see it so I cannot comment on it. I do note that there is value enough here without it so if you find it enjoyable, so much the better.
Though a lot of attention is focused on the young, attractive bass player Tal Wilkenfeld (who looks like Ginger Baker's daughter on the import cover of the Blind Faith album), special plaudits are due drummer Vinnie Colaiuta who did a yeoman's job. His work is just exquisite!
If you were a fan of Jeff Beck back in the day and have been wondering what happened to him, well here he is as sharp as ever. This DVD is accompanied by an attractive 8-page insert that features pictures, DVD info, and useful commentary on the concert. Get this soon, its a real value.",1261526400,3,2097,4.308860759493671

3720245,5,B001NP8PQM,"This is the DVD that Jeff Beck fans always dreamed of seeing but never thought possible - a full length concert performance that features both great cinematography and memorable musicianship. Jeff Beck's current band (and a few guests) run through some of the high points of Jeff's lengthy and innovative career, focusing primarily on the jazz fusion style that Jeff helped redefine in the middle 1970s. You're not going to find a lot of heavy rock, and you're definitely not going to hear any of the techno/drum-and-bass that dominates most of Jeff Beck's output over the past decade or so. You will find some of Jeff Beck's best playing ever, and an incredibly supportive and enthusiastic band. I have never seen any guitarist demonstrate the amount of attention to detail and care in playing his material as Jeff Beck does, and this video allows you to see him gently manipulating his tone and volume knobs to achieve the dramatic and expressive dynamics that make him so special.

My jaw dropped after the first number and I never really recovered for the remainder of the disc. The musicianship is that good.

There's also a lengthy interview with Jeff Beck himself as a bonus, along with a very short segment featuring band interviews. Who knew that Jeff Beck could talk that much, when he almost never says anything on stage?

This is nothing less than an inspiring DVD. Buy it!",1259798400,2,1385,4.810924369747899

The performance, the video, the audio are all of equal levels of perfection. The absolute best DVD I have ever had the pleasure of watching! Jeff Beck has always been a premier Guitar God along with Clapton. A must have for any audio/video enthusiast and even more so for for fans!!!

I wish Amazon had a 3 Criteria rating that would make for a quicker and more accurate rating of Cd's, DVD's and Blu-ray's.

1. Performance
2. Quality of Audio
3. Quality of Video (for DVD's and Blu-ray's)

1.*****
2.*****
3.*****

Bands that wish to have there performances recorded and recognised should be held to a standard. Poor audio, no matter how good the performance, is still a bad product. Those who would still purchase sub-standard audio quality recordings and rank that product highly are not doing the industry or the band justice. Demand better and we will get it, settle for less and that's what you'll get.",1258502400,,1217,4.594470046082949

I've enjoyed his playing since 1966 and he has been one of my 3 all-time favorite guitarists (Hendrix, Knopfler).  He shows more casual adeptness at anything he plays;save for a delay unit on his amp,
he plays straight from guitar to amp - find another rock guitarist who does that.  His touch and control is astounding, he can stand with any player today.  I was luck enough to see him in 1989 when he was on tour with SRV.  This video brings up close all his skills, style, and composition in such a fun to watch package.

After viewing this concert event on Palla, I immediately fired up the laptop to see if a DVD was available on Amazon. I was overjoyed to find this available for sale.

Between the special guests (like Clapton, Joss Stone, etc.) and his 'dead-on' solid band (which includes young phenom bass player, Tal Wilkenfeld), this is one of the best live performance captures of Jeff's work that I've ever had the privilege of seeing and hearing.

This is a first rate performance with top of the line musicians (each amazing in their own rate - especially Tal Wilkenfeld) backing up the legendary Jeff Beck. Unorthodox techniques combined with deep soul, attitude and creativity make Beck the best I've ever seen. Not as fast as some of the other great rock guitar players out there (Vai, Satriani, etc.)- but his uniqueness, mastery of the entire guitar (whammy, volume pots, pickups, etc.) and ""human voice like"" approach to melody make him way more inspiring, entertaining and enjoyable. He plays the guitar like a true extension of his self.
Any fan of great guitar playing and all around musicianship should own this DVD. It's awesome!! Plus great guest appearances including Eric Clapton (who is spurred on by Beck to play with more fire than normal.)

I saw him throughout the 70s and enjoyed each performance; his style of play now is faster and even more pronounced. He now relies on a wonderful finger picking style-even more power!

Ronnie Scott's is obviously a comfortable venue for the audience and the band. The band compliment and inspire Jeff. I'd heard numerous times of his great new bassist Tal Wilkenfeld, she has major chops! Vinnie Colaiuta on drums and Jason Rabello on keys round out the band. Works by Tony Hymas, of Beck Bozzio Hymas fame, are the core of this show. My favorite is the Billy Cobham tune ""Stratus"", its been stripped down to its hard edge. Shots of the audience reveal Page and Plant and the two duets with ""God"" Eric Clapton bring a ghostly blessing from the Yardbirds to a fantastic gig.

Jeff is the only one of the big three (Beck, Clapton, Page) from England who still tries something new and fresh. I was inspired by his playing and the beautiful music.

3720269,5,B001NP8PQM,"My music video library includes over 200 titles, and Performing This Week: Live at Ronnie Scott's is without question one of the best concert DVD's I've purchased in the last five years. As a guitarist, I've always wanted a full length Jeff Beck concert to study, and this is incredible...it's set in a small jazz club in London. The supporting musicians are all world-class instrumentalists, and it's obvious they love playing this music together. Bassist Tal Wilkenfeld is particularly fun to watch, and an incredible player for her young age (20 at the time of filming)and stature (her custom Shadowsky bass is almost bigger than she is, but she's in complete control of the instrument). Drummer Vinnie Colaiuta is very tight, and keyboardist Jason Rebello is stellar. The guest performers (Joss Stone, Eric Clapton, Imogen Heap) each turn in good performances. There are a number of recognizable musicians in the audience (including former Yardbird Jimmy Page and bandmate Robert Plant). The song selection is a nice cross section of Beck's catalog, spanning his lengthy career. If you are a fan of Jeff Beck, you must own this DVD. If you're a guitar player, it will either inspire you to practice or make you want to hang it up. Either way, you should add this to your collection.

His band is tight and tasteful, filling the spaces and standing out without overpowering.  This set proves again what a joy it is to hear rock performed in something smaller than a stadium.  The only thing that would have made the performance better would have been Rod Stewart in classic form on vocals (well we can all dream...and then put on our old copies of Beck-ola!)",1250899200,,506,4.588888888888889

If you play guitar, bass, or drums this is an excellent opportunity to take a ""master class"" from the masters. as usual Jeff has surrounded himself with some of the best. Vinnie Colaiuta on drums, From Australia, 23 year old Tal Wilkenfeld on Bass and Jazz keyboardist Jason Robello.
I've had the thrill of standing in the wings while Jeff did his sound check a couple of times, this venue would be like everyone being able to be in the wings. hearing Jeff, watching those hands play would be a lifetime memory. Ronnie Scott's is a cozy jazz club with a small stage, the kind of venue that a lot of musicians look forward to playing.
With most of the camera time focused on Jeff's hands from about four feet away you can actually see how he plays, this video is a dream come true, not just for any player, but for anybody who loves this music. At the end, Jeff brings his friend Eric Clapton up for a couple of blues tunes. A low point, for me was after Imogen Heap sang one song, she comes back out to take the encore bow with the band. It's not like she is with them, she sang one song.
 This is a GREAT DVD and should get six stars.",1250640000,,1248,4.1570247933884295

3720275,5,B001NP8PQM,"I first got the audio CD of this performance and it progressively grew on me.  The Blu-ray video and sound are spectacular.  On my high-end system it is like sitting in the club.  The video is well shot and captures the intimacy of the club.  I like his current band because they have a funky vibe.  His drummer really has a great beat and flashy fills, without overplaying.  I never knew his bass player was young girl -- she can really rip out the funky bass riffs. And the keyboardist fills Jan Hammer's shoes well. There are few places in the performance that are a bit loose, but I think you can expect that on a no-overdubs live performance.

This has a lot of additional material that isn't on the CD, and it is well worth having.  People Get Ready is really well sung by Joss Stone (wow is she hot too).  Blanket is a really neat song that changes up the pace of the concert, sung by Imogen Heap. Rollin' and Tumblin' is cool too.  Clapton appears on two songs.  The set with the Big Town Playboys is fun -- not the normal type of music I listen to, but I can dig it every once in a while.

3720278,5,B001NP8PQM,"well, what can I, as a non-guitarist, say about Mr. Beck that others haven't already said? It is no fluke that he is widely considered to be one
of the greatest guitar players ever. That's actually a no-brainer. Any parent that buys a guitar for their young kid should also include a copy
of this DVD and make then watch it every day for a month before even letting them touch their guitar. Jeff's touch on the guitar is an absolute
thing of beauty. His use of the whammy bar is unlike anyone else I have seen and he coaxes such sweet sounds from his Strat. I was commenting to a
guitarist friend how Jeff's Strat doesn't even have that identifiable Start tone that you hear from guys like Blackmore, Hendrix, Stevie Ray, etc.
Jeff's sound is all his own. And when you see the look on Jeff's face he was clearly in a good place during this recording. He is truly enjoying
himself and it's great to see his ear to ear grin.
The band, what a band! Tal Wilkenfeld on bass looks 12 years old but don't let that fool you. She can play and she came to play. The fact that she's
in Jeff's touring band says it all. Drummer Vinnie Colauita needs no introduction and if he does then you haven't been paying attention. Ask anyone in
the know about Vinnie's playing and 10 times out of 10 it will be something like ""oh yeah, Vinnie!"" I am not familiar with keys man Jason Rebello but I'm
sure I'll be hearing more from this guy. He's great on this DVD.

He has done some really wonderful solo records over the decades and his time with the Yardbirds has established his status as a legend. But this clearly is very self-indulgent jazz-noodling guitar playing, the very reason why punk rock came along. I am shocked that it has gotten such amazing reviews, Also the young female bassist swaying to the reaggae basslines makes one cringe. I mean...what do they think?

3720280,2,B001NP8PQM,"This was a remarkable show from a music and audio point of view, but the visual also captures the tightness of this very good band in close cabaret-like quarters, and the person Jeff Beck who I'd never seen before or even heard talk. Of course he doesn't need to sing or talk because he presents so ably, smoothly but forcefully a great sense of jazz/blues/rock, even if he has said in the past its about making rude challenging noise. The man is a brilliant guitarist with a wonderful sense of blues/jazz/rock, a blend of Rory Gallagher, Eric Clapton, John McLaughlan. The DVD brings to life a bloke who has always been invisible, perhaps a bit reclusive or socially awkward. The usual DVD extras with interviews add something extra. Energetic tracks but beautiful ones like Angel sees his fine soft touch and at one point briefly reaches across to play the frets on the bass of the neck  of the young bass player's guitar. Cute. Lennon/McCartney's A day in the Life seems a weird notion but its great. But the energetic tracks are also there. The three guest vocal tracks are nice but unnecessary. And even the two tracks with Clapton are unnnecessary but of course interesting, historical and meaningful. Beck's awkward manner again shows a respect but not soulmates?

After seeing those few segments, I rushed on to AMZ.com to get the Bluray Disc.  I was not disappointed.  The intimate setting of Ronnie Scott's makes it as if you are there.  The sound is phenomenal.  The song selection covers the gambit of Jeff Beck's virtuosity - Mesmerizing!  The cinematography captures the feel of the venue and the artistry of his technique.  Drummer Vinnie Colaiuta matches the energetic and virtuous playing technique of his cohorts - I thought somebody had thrown sneakers in the dryer on the spin cycle and put silverware in the blender - this guy can play!  I first saw the bass player on the Eric Clapton Crossroads piece.  Tal Wilkenfeld plays soulfully, effortlessly, comfortable as can be, playing with legends.  Its as if she were re-incarnated and this was her 150th year playing the bass!!!  Jason Rebello on keys rounds out group.  His melodic sensibilities seem to be the glue that keeps things cooking when the shredding gets tough (and fast enough for you too!).  In particular you will enjoy the appearance of vocalist Imogen Heap.  She is pure ""Diva"" in her delivery of a simple song about a blanket - It literally leaves you stunned - She has fantastic stage presence, mysteriosity, and a simply scintilating voice!

3720284,5,B001NP8PQM,"Once upon a time there were three British players. Eric Clapton, Jimmy Page, and Jeff Beck.

Eric Clapton left the Yardbirds and defined the super group, the one-off project, and the guest appearance. Ordained god-like by the Baby-Boomers... Then there is Jimmy Page, all he ever did was reshape the Delta blues into hard-rock, become a studio wiz and riff master, and craft the imploded Yardbirds into a little band called ""Led Zeppelin"", maybe you have heard of them.

This leads us to Jeff Beck... Visionary, eccentric, reclusive, and in my opinion probably more talented than Clapton and Page put together.

This DVD... Performing This Week: Live at Ronnie Scott's is the kind of performance that will inspire those that never played to pick a guitar instead of a video game, for Beck is what being a ""Guitar Hero"" is all about. On the flip-side if you are a musician, you might want to avoid this DVD... it might just be the kind of thing that makes you decide to learn to sell real estate.

Beck strolls through his catalog and blends genres, styles and music flawlessly. Always allowing his band equal time to shine, Jeff Beck dances in and out of their fills, lines, and beats like Baryshnikov with a strat.

He welcomes the vocal talents of Joss Stone and Imogen Heap and they add youth and fire to the night... there is a noticeable shift when Clapton joins in for a couple of spot on blues numbers. With Clapton Beck seemed old enough to be a Yardbird... with the rest of the band he played like ""Free Bird""... his music bouncing between 1965 and 2025... Beck creates a sonic landscape that shows where Satriani wants to go but can't find the map.

Simply outstanding... not surprising if you are a fan, but a wonder to own and to share. If there is anyone out that thinks of Jeff Beck as that ""other"" Yardbird guitarist... they should pick up this DVD... the CD too while they are at it.",1247270400,12,1899,4.570588235294117

The guy has absolutely perfect pitch. Aside from the guitar heroics, he is an outstanding accompianist for the three singers on the DVD, and puts a lot of effort into making them sound their best - in Heap's first song, Beck has some great phrasing, at times leading her lines, other times a beat or two behind to provide a nice emphasis.

For guitar nuts (like me), the photography is outstanding; how they managed to do it given the tiny stage and the capacity night club crowd was quite an accomplishment, and one never sees a distracting cameraman creeping around the set. Sound is near-studio quality. The interview section is worth checking out. Jeff isn't overly articulate on stage, but has some interesting things to say in the interview.

Jeff Beck is a true virtuoso on the guitar. The unbelievable licks he plays and the amazing arrangements of the songs are incredible to see and hear.
Vinnie Colaiuta is a monster drummer. Tal Wilkenfeld plays outstanding bass guitar and Jason Rebello is a fantastic keyboardist.

I watch this DVD almost daily. It is a must have for any musicians collection.

3720293,5,B001NP8PQM,"Jeff Beck's Live at Ronnie Scott's is as good as it gets.  On many levels!  Jeff Becks playing is spectacular.  He is always pushing his own limits and on occasion there are a couple of weak spots.  But, after all it is a live recording and Beck has the class to not go back and fix things.  The production is also superlative, the audio is clean and crisp and the band's nuances come through clearly.  For me the highlight track is Angel (Footsteps), I sit in stunned amazement every time I listen to that track.  Somewhat ironically, the weakest tracks are the two with Eric Clapton. But I think this performance is must for every guitar player and every fan.  There are guys out there that play faster but there are none that play better, none that are more creative and none with an as impressive catalog of music. It still boggles my mind that Beck, Clapton and Jimmy Page all grew up within a few blocks of each other.  I don't know what was in that villages water then, but I wish I'd had some.",1245456000,3,1001,4.338709677419355

3720295,5,B001NP8PQM,"I have been a rather high tech guitar player for more decades than I care to count. Jeff Beck was one of the players who started me on the guitar. Jimmy Page, Robin Trower, and Clapton being being perhaps more of an influence. That is, until Beck came out with Blow by Blow and Wired in the mid seventies. After watching this DVD you will agree, no one plays like Jeff, and as hard as it is to say (being a Satriani/Vai fan myself) I do not think anyone actually can play like Jeff!

  Wired still remains my fav album of Jeff's and I was delighted to hear some of the tracks on this suburbly flawless masterpiece DVD. Jeff laughingly just missed I think maybe two lines, but who could tell? His master class ability to manipulate the guitar with an unparalleled ability to use the Strat Whammy bar and his unique finger-style picking technique, leaves old players like myself wondering how he does what he does.

  As Steve Lukather, in the rather esteamed and blessed audience, commented ""God plays guitar using Jeff Beck's hands"". And that, I believe, is a far accessment of this treasurable DVD.

  The little cutey bass player Tal Wilkenfield, is not only a treat to look at but an incredible bassest. She cops some bass lines which would tax and defeat a lot of players, a finese of an older accomplished player in the prodigy hands of a 22 year old wonder. Her technique and tone is astounding. His drummer, Vinnie Colaluta, is as good or better than anyone who has played the drums. He cops the old vintage flawlessly and is able to roll and punch whenever the muse hits Jeff, and it hits him a lot.

  KeyBoardist Jason Rebello, not only plays like Jan Hammer but may have been able to teach him a thing or two, he is too underrated, this is the first I have heard of him, the tones and interplay of the keys and guitar was just a treat for the ears. The interplay of Behind the Veil and Led Boots was just an arm raising ovation. Jeff was right to raise his hands in the air as a salute to his bandmates. You have to be the best to play with Jeff and this band sets the bar very high!

  I raise my hands in the air to hear Jeff play in front row view with every bit of his ability, perhaps better control than he had back in the mid 70's when Wired just blew me away. Modern equipment improves upon the old sounds. It is Jeff's hands that make the tone and he kills on these tunes! I am 52 this year and beck must be 60 by now, thank you Jeff, and thank you Robin Trower and Jimmy for still playing for us. To think one can have a set of hands like that at 60 puts these teenage strummers to shame with their chart success.

  I have been a Jazz Fusion fan ever since Wired and no one does it like Beck. Clapton was brave to come on the stage with him, as was obviously an incredible hot night for Jeff. Not trying to over play on Clapton and of course allowing for Jeff's full rig and pedal line, this was not a competition but I am sure Eric would agree Beck was Wired that night and no one could touch him. Better to sit in the back like Page and just enjoy this performance. Mike Myer and wife in the front mid table were grooving with the vibe as well. There are not enough stars for this DVD. I am disapointed not to have heard Blue Wind, Come Dancing, and a couple others but he did provide a good mix, when you hear the opening Bolereo track, you realize you are about to witness something special. The Beetle's Tune A Day in The Life made you mourn for John. How Beck orchaSRATed that piece was an much a wonder as listening to it.

3720303,5,B001NP8PQM,"I'm always turning my friend Ricky on to all kinds of music and he amply repaid me today when he played me this concert DVD of who I believe to be the most nuanced, sensitive, versatile guitarist of all time. It's easy to imagine Clapton's jitters as he took the stage to share a couple of encores with the group, having just witnessed Beck's dazzling display of boundless creativity and virtuosity. But Eric is a legend, too, and puts in a very respectable performance, keeping pace with Jeff and creating a wonderful return-to-roots mini-set that takes you back to the mid-sixties when the two of them were Yardbirds, worshipping Sonny Boy Williamson and the like. Beck does so much with tone and attack here that words will never do his performance justice. He plays with the subtlety of a classically trained musician, the improvisational fluidity of a great jazzman and the grit and power of rock's best musicians.

One of the visual highlights for me was watching all the smiling on stage. These players looked like they were having as much fun as those watching, particularly the Australian prodigy Tal Wilkenfeld, who's probably looking at a career that will span the better part of this century. She has an engaging, innocent presence that seems to bring out something in Beck that compliments it.

I wonder what Jimmy Paige was thinking, as he sat, along with Robert Plant, in the intimate, relatively small audience. Was he also called up to play, but the material wasn't up to acceptable standards and didn't make the final cut? Or was he just not up for it?

And finally, the rockabilly set that's included in the special features is the real thing - like Johnny Burnett with James Burton. Only the drummer's shaved head and Beck's 70s hair-do let you know otherwise.

An incredible documentation of some fabulous music. Very highly recommended.",1244332800,3,1858,4.851735015772871

3720305,5,B001NP8PQM,"The Yardbirds left the world with a guitar legacy with the likes of Eric Clapton, Jimmy Page and Jeff Beck add to that list their contemporary, Jimi Hendrix and that pretty much sets the standard for blues-rock guitar. Jeff Beck started his legacy with his late '60 psychdelic blues, morphed into hard driving R&B player, and then the in the '70's combined all those elements into his present fusion instrumental direction. Listening to Jeff is always a treat, but watching him is even better. His virtuosity seems effortless but alwasys inspired and unique. There are a lot if high points on this DVD but Billy Cobham's ""Spectrum"", Jeff's own Indian/eastern inspired ""Nadia"" and the vocal piece with Imogene Heap ""Blanket"" all prove everything Jeff touches turns to guitar gold. Whether playing all out rocking riffs or restrained heart-wrenching melodies Jeff leaves an indelible stamp on everything he plays. From beginning to end which unites him with Eric Clapton on two blues numbers (Where was Jimmy Page? You'll see Robert Plant in the audience grinning ear to ear), this is worth every penny and more. The CD does not include the vocal numbers nor the Clapton stuff which for me really put the icing on this cake. Oh and the band Colaiuta, Moran and Wilkenfled smoke throughout.",1244160000,,1287,4.962962962962963

3720307,5,B001NP8PQM,"What a great DVD.  JB plays with such touch, nuance and sophistication.  Absolutely love his band and their top musicianship that they bring.  My only comment for me is; it would have been nice to have Joss Stone sing ""Rollin n Tumblin"" instead of Imogen Heap.  It is a blues song and the way Beck and company played it so funky rockin blues (Jeff in particular), a grittier bluesy voice I think would have made it come across in the true vain that it was being played.  No disrespect for I.H., she is just not a rock singer by any means.  I did like her on the song ""Blanket"" with the band which seems to be more her style.  Beck and Co. pretty much could back any average singer and make them sound pretty damn good.  This man really knows how to compliment a singers voice with his fills and backing chords etc.....to perfection.  This in itself is an amazing talent let alone all the other stuff this man is capable of doing.

I am a huge E.C. fan, but his vocals were kind of on the pedestrian side though his guitar work was good as always. But really, this small venue concert at Ronnie Scott's is really about Jeff Beck and his current band.  Totally entertaining and fun to watch.  They all seem to be having so much fun playing together with their smiles and disposition.  Just a thought:  Though Tal Wilkenfeld (bassist) is a young prodigy, energetic and cute to boot, I think she kind of pushes Mr. Beck to play to his up most potential by having this attractive young lady on stage smiling and giving off the ""wow"" factor vibe like this is too good to be true.  Not to psycho babble too much, but just a thought.  Makes it even better!

I absolutely love this DVD.",1244073600,,1677,4.340836012861736

Beck rocks, but he also swings, especially with this combo of musicians.  While a Brit, Beck and his mates play like classic American jazz quartets, jammin' and smokin' with all kinds of dynamics, tempos, moods, and thrills.

3720309,4,B001NP8PQM,"Jeff Beck's DVD, ""Performing Live This Week...at Ronnie Scott's"" is a great DVD if you like the music of Jeff Beck.  While Jeff has some of the best chops and techniques around that play well opposite his youthful female bass player, Tal Wilkenfeld, the music is what it should be: entertaining, and everything that you would expect from Jeff Beck.

However, the video editing leaves something to be desired.  While the video is clear and crisp in picture, the editing is choppy and jumps around, never focusing on one musician for too long.  This causes the eyes to be distracted.  If the reason you buy this DVD is to learn something about Jeff's playing technique, you may be able to do so only briefly; the DVD is not an instructional DVD that would enable you to learn more easily.  The DVD is a concert DVD.

While I personally enjoy Jeff's music, if you are a purist of watching good video, you may find that this particular video doesn't deserve 5 stars.  I gave it 4 stars for the less than desirable editing.  The music, however, being played in a medium-sized classy nightclub, in a warm, intimate setting, is what earns the remaining 4 stars.",1243900800,,1154,4.617647058823529

So much can be built up but, like he doesn't need flash, shred nor dropped-down doom (Christ, the man doesn't even need a plectrum nor a change of guitar!), there's little need for more than what's been and what will be said later on.

Everyone else will either get it or go for American Idol. Guitarists: he'll either make you re-boot what profound technique you've already attained or make you reach higher/more than you thought possible.

I've viewed this film thrice and the first 2 almost made me give everything up (been playing since '72) but tonight, I choose the latter. Thank you, Almighty for giving us Jeff.

Performing This Week: Live at Ronnie Scott's was on my recommended suggestions, and as soon as I saw the name, Jeff Beck I clicked on buy without even looking to see what I was buying.  I didn't care, it said Jeff Beck and I was ecstatic!  Like a kid in a candy shop when I got this DVD I propped it up on my night stand like a young woman in love would an 8x10 of her lover and just left it there for a few days, still having not looked to see exactly what was on it other than a cursor y scan of the song titles.  Then one evening, I decided it was time to watch...

To my complete surprise the entire band that Jeff Beck used on the  Crossroads concert was with him on this DVD and I already knew I wouldn't be disappointed but when I saw he would be performing this concert with this group of musicians I knew this would be extra special.  I have wanted desperately to see a concert with Jeff Beck playing more than just one or two songs and this was it for me.  I love seeing the body language and the facial expression of an artist with their instrument. It's just wondrous how the instrument and the artist are one.

The price of this concert scared me.  I thought it was a misprint, so I hurriedly clicked on it.  So many times artistic beauty is pricey, and I want to really give kudo's to whomever is responsible for making this concert affordable for those of us who don't make the big bucks but know true art when we see and hear it.  If I were ever lucky enough to see Jeff Beck in person, I would pay him again for this concert, and thank him for allowing me to see and hear it.  Imogen Heap sang ""Blanket"" and I kept playing it over and over as the two of them together were in complete sync with that song.  I loved that performance.  Joss Stone did a fantastic job as well.  The added bonus of Eric Clapton was ""off the hook"" excellent in the two songs he and Jeff performed together.  Mr. Clapton is the master at bringing people together and I've ""met"" a lot of artists I would never have heard had it not been through some of Eric Clapton's collaborative music sessions.

And not to exclude the band, I hope this band remains together as is.  They are truly ""one"" .

I want to see the number of people who have bought this DVD go up!  Don't let the low price fool you people, this concert is a MASTERPIECE!  Everyone who ever loved Jeff Beck and any person who fantasizes about playing the guitar should buy this DVD.",1243123200,,2669,4.186274509803922

And, this may have been the perfect way to experience Beck live; small, intimate jazz club, up close, warm room. His playing has never been better. Speaking of the band, though, and being a drummer myself, I found Vinnie Colaiuta's playing to be simply unbelievable and quite inspiring. Absolutely incredible. I'm also a big fan of Tal Wilkenfeld and she has a tremendous future ahead of her. She's already a great fusion bassist but she seemed slightly less outgoing on this video than on her Crossroads gig w/Beck in Chicago. Regardless, surrounding Beck with this extremely high level and quality of musicianship makes this DVD a must-own, must-have-in-the-library.

3720316,5,B001NP8PQM,"I've never seen Jeff Beck play live. So, when I missed his recent concert here in Philly at the Electric Factory, my brother in California called me up to chew me out. Disgusted, he was, with my lack of initiative. I liked Beck well enough. I've owned ""Wired"" since before I can remember, but I just never really bonded with his music in a deep way.

Out of guilt and curiosity - they call him a guitar ""God"" - I bought this DVD pretty cheap here on Amazon. What a bargain! What a Band! What a Sound! WOW! I can hear y'all going ""Duhh.."" Ok, so I'm a scumbag. Look, I've even got ""Guitar Shop"" 'cause my brother sent me that 8 years ago, so I'm aware of the TYPE of music Jeff was into. But seeing him so clear, up close, and personal is just so great.

It's great to hear Jeff explaining why he had such doubts about playing in such a small venue, he thought the room would be too small for his usual volume. That's actually the reason I didn't rush out for tickets to the ""Electric Factory"" show. It's a large almost empty warehouse of a room with a ton of echo; I thought it would only be a sonic disaster. Well, whatever they did to prep for this DVD is well appreciated. It's a marvel of sound engineering.

The Band are amazing. I know Vinnie from his Zappa work, but still blew me away with his ferocious precise beats. The curly haired bass playing phenom, Tal, is spectacular to hear and watch. Her giggling, smile-afflicted face is a special treat. And on keyboards, Jason Rebello can do it all, even a good Jan Hammer jam, when he has too.

The Guest Vocalists are OK and interesting, and Clapton is solid. But, really, I just woulda been happy with nuthin' but Beck and crew. Maybe a second DVD with ""Guests"" woulda been cool. A small point.

Hearing and seeing Jeff Beck up close in personal for an hour and a half is a real treat. His raunchy 'n ruff sound goes down so well and works killer when he goes soft 'n sweet too. Probably not another rock guitarist with his expressiveness and uncannily accurate pitch on bends tremolo work. What was a GREAT surprise, were the cool guests cameos by Joss Stone, Eric Clapton and especially that Imogene lady, who'd I'd never heard before. The song she sang, Blanket, was such a cool, evocative, perfectly smoky jazzy tune, and you get to see how excellent Jeff is doing rhythm backup playing. Just so cool. The band is top notch too, although I think it would've been extra cool to see Jan Hammer on the keyboards. Him breaking out a moog or mini moog on Led Boots would've been killer. The guy playing is good no doubt though, as is the whole band. The only other bummer was not hearing Freeway Jam and a couple other favorites, but still cool overall. The shots of Robert Plant and Jimmy Page in the audience was neat too.",1242604800,3,1152,4.438679245283019

The show is in an ""intimate setting"" and the surround sound really does make you feel you're there (keep an eye out for celebs like Robert Plant in attendance). It's a treat to finally be able to see the guitar man in action, with close-ups of how he uses his fingers and the whammy bar to create virtually any sound. And, he plays the same strat throughout with no effects pedals. His band is full of great players as well, and they are given room to display what they can do.  Vinnie Colaiuta is a superb drummer, and Tal Wilkenfeld plays bass like she's been doing it for many years, despite looking 17. The keyboard man, Jason Rebello, may not be quite such a standout as a soloist, but he grounds the songs and fills them out to great effect, so that the sound would not be the same without him. Guest vocalists, Joss Stone  and Imogen Heap, add variety and do their jobs with authority. Then, of course, there are the two tracks with Clapton, possibly worth the price of admission alone, and the ensuing fireworks do not disappoint. Others may wish to do a track-by-track analysis, but suffice it to say, this is a great and entertaining concert DVD, and complaints are hard to come by, so grab it if any part of your musical tastes run in this direction (if you're a fan of Jeff, it's a no-brainer) because you're highly unlikely to regret this decision!",1242518400,,1441,4.433962264150943

Vinnie Colaiuta is as good as a drummer gets. Tal Wilkenfeld is a revelation and pure joy on bass. Jason Rebello, who is relatively new to electronic keyboards, is flawless. And Jeff Beck...to quote Jimi Page when he, Jeff and Eric Clapton played together, is ""the best there is.""

For anyone not familiar with Beck's work, this is an incredible introduction. Jeff Beck is a unique player, with an organic style and a command of guitar unlike any other. I've often marveled at songs on his albums, wondering how he came up with what he plays.

The venue on the DVD is intimate, and an unusual setting for Beck, who usually plays much larger venues.

Impressive and a breath of fresh air especially these days where most guitar bands are over distorted, with little if any soloing, and just a din of noise, played by average players just pumping their arms in unison.",1242345600,,1008,4.651685393258427
3720324,5,B001NP8PQM,"If you are interested in seeing a virtuoso performance by a guitar legend with one of the best rhythm sections there is, this is the disc for you. Great from the first note, this is an extremely well produced and paced package, with just enough vocals to break up the mostly instrumental show. The song selection spans his long career, but  is mostly Blow By Blow and later. Vinnie Colaiuta is in a word, amazing. He's one of the greatest drummers of all time, and his suggestion to bring in bassist Tal Wilkenfeld is a masterstroke. Looking younger than her 23 years, she is a world class bassist, apparently comfortable playing in any style. Her solo on Cause We've Ended As Lovers, is  touching, emotional, and will probably guarantee her employment for decades. The two songs with Clapton show just how great Beck is, but it is Imogen Heap that steals the vocal spotlight. Her song Blanket is haunting and beautiful at the same time, but her treatment of Muddy Waters Rollin' and Tumblin'  is a show stopper. Truly awesome.  A must buy for anyone that considers themselves a music fan.",1242345600,,1089,4.68586387434555

The only thing that was off-key for me (to use a phrase) was the female singers. Joss was good and better than the other woman, but I am more of a music man than a song man. The encore was amazing. For 10$-  unbaleevable!!! You can't find a better deal musically! Watch the interview and the extras.

The 21 years old bass player girl has the personality of a 50 years old musician, and her look is charming. And the singers and Eric Clapton are great on the few songs that they appear. The jazz-rock is full of personality and emotional. The show should be recorded in a theather, with a good stage. But the perfection is impossible. By now !!!",1241740800,2,664,4.627118644067797

I was able to go to Eric Claptons Cross Roads and saw the sameline up as whats on this DVD.I have say that Jeff Beck was amazing and his part of Cross Roads was the highlight he stole the show. Me and my son purchased the Cross Road DVD and we disappointed that so few songs from Jeff where on the DVD. I now purchased this DVD and boy was I blown away just the show I saw at Cross Roads. I think this has got to be one of his best lineups and it is everything you would want. This is a great show and just the right mix of songs new and old. Also as bonus you get to hear Jeff play a rockabilly set. I'm a guitar player and I have got to tell you no one plays like Jeff just amazing and some great grooves.

3720336,4,B001NP8PQM,"Jeff Beck has always been good.  Oddly, though, the debate about ""who's the best of the former Yardbird axe men"" often omitted him, focusing instead on Clapton and Page.  While I'll still go with Clapton, there really is nobody who plays the guitar quite like Beck.  His range of techniques and his willingness to rove far and wide in musical genres make his sound a unique voice.

In this DVD, he brings his spectacular band (with his breath-taking base player, Tal Wilkenfeld) to an intimate venue, and invites two of my favorite musicians (Imogen Heap and Eric Clapton) to sit in on a few songs.  The guests, as they should, augment but do not dominate the performance.  Most of the show is just the pared-down, searing sound of Beck's Stratocaster over as tight a band as you'll ever hear.",1241740800,2,793,4.669064748201439

3720339,5,B001NP8PQM,"Jeff Beck just keeps improving with age, and he was fantastic when I first heard him countless years ago with the Yardbirds (..something about making his guitar sound like a chicken chasing a steamroller).  This is a fantastic DVD recorded in a night club venue with great closeups and sound quality second to none. No one else produces the amazing sounds he extracts from a guitar, yet he's so subtle that much of his technique goes by unnotice. Great combo with Jason Rebello, Tal Wilkenfeld, and Vinnie Colaiuta (hey, didn't he play with Frank Zappa?).  Guest artist are all top notch.  Joss Stone does great gospel on People Get Ready, Imogen Heap is one of my favorites (and she's really tall), and Jeff and Eric Clapton work really well together, 2 very different styles that truely complement each other.  Highly recommended for multiple viewing.",1241395200,,853,4.902777777777778
3720340,5,B001NP8PQM,"I've been a guitar player for 30 years now, and therefore waiting for a DVD just like this out of Jeff Beck for just about that long.  While Beck is my favorite guitarist, being a fan of his can be a little maddening because he's traditionally been quite stingy in allowing projects to see the light of day (read The Steakhouse Sessions.)  Oh, he'll eventually get around to puttin' something out ... every 10 or so years.

However, all is now forgiven in Jeff Beck land with the release of this excellent and intimate set. Ronnie Scott's, a famous Jazz club in London, is the friendly confines that affords us fantastic up close and personal footage of Beck and an extremely tight ensemble.  The band is in fine form here and Beck's playing is sublime throughout.  The set leans heavily on classic Beck fusion numbers which, in my humble opinion, is exactly as it should be in the perfect ""Beck"" world.  Gone are any traces of his forays into electronic ""jungle music.""  The camera lingers long and thoughtfully on his amazing playing technique which can finally be witnessed in stunning clarity.

While the appeal of something like this to a guitar player is obvious, these are also excellent compositions that should easily appeal to any fan of serious music.  ""Vocalist? We don't need no stinking vocalist ...""

There are however three guest vocalists on hand.  Eric Clapton fronts a few blues tunes during the encore which are fine and dandy.  Joss Stone, trying way too hard and overshooting by miles here, sings ""People Get Ready."" And finally, Imogen Heap, who in my opinion, sings so well here it would warrant an entire album with her and the Beckster.

Definitely pick up this instantly classic set to show just how swank you are. It easily provides the perfect backdrop for a breezy Saturday afternoon of chasing some broad around the apartment. Cheers!",1241395200,3,1865,4.7725856697819315
3720341,5,B001NP8PQM,"You you like guitars and guitar players, this DVD is for you! Jeff Beck makes guitar playing look effortless. And, he's truly creative with his instrument. Anyone that can make Eric Clapton look like a rookie is one killer guitar player! The Ronnie Scott Jazz Club is a great place to showplace the talents of this truly great guitar player.

3720344,5,B001NP8PQM,"I heard rumors of this DVD over a year ago, and of course it was supposed to have been released in January, and got pushed back to March 31.  Well, it was well worth waiting for.  This should cement Beck's reputation as the best rock guitarist alive, and certainly the most unpredictable.

The band is the best he's ever worked with by far, these are all world-class musicians.  Vinnie Colaiuta and Jason Rebello are well-known and established, and justifiably so, as this set proves once again.  But bassist Tal Wilkenfeld is a revelation.  She was just 21 when this was filmed, and if you closed your eyes you'd think you were listening to Jaco Pastorius!  But don't close your eyes. :)

Highlights are too many to mention, but I'll mention a few anyway. Personally, I can't get ""Stratus"" and ""Behind the Veil"" out of my head.  ""Cause We've Ended as Lovers"" and ""Goodbye Porkpie Hat/Brush With the Blues"" are also outstanding.  John Lennon's classic Beatles track ""A Day in the Life"" has to be seen and heard to be believed.  Beck comes close to duplicating the sound of the 41 piece London Philharmonic with just his guitar and amp.

I've been a Jeff Beck fan for 45 years, since his first album with the Yardbirds, and it's great to see this DVD finally released to show the world what they've been overlooking all these years.",1241222400,,1331,4.617021276595745

I also purchaced the CD, but it is way more enjoyable to watch him as well as listen to him. And the video is NOT one of these creations that feels you have to keep the camera moving in order to like it. It actually stays on the subject so you can actually see whats happening, instead of getting sea sick trying to watch. So anyway...... this is a must for Beck fans....

Sadly, the song begins OK, but then suddenly goes right into an extended bass solo.  Then it ends and that's it!  Oh well, I'm told there's a good version of the mentioned song elsewhere on another DVD, so I'll seek it out.

3720352,5,B001NP8PQM,"Jeff Beck has done for the electric guitar as much as Hendrix and Clapton, perhaps even more. Beck has never looked back and does not dwell in the past. His musucal career has broken new ground for guitarists exploring jazz, rock, metal, techno and pop.

This DVD is the first ""official"" release by Jeff Beck. There are several bootleg concert videos available but this release gives you a front row seat to his playing and the song selection is very complete with a good sample of Beck's instrumental music repertoire.

To note, Beck is outstanding as expected but kudos to the excellent band. Vinnie Colaiuta on drums, the beautiful and skillful Tal Wilkenfeld and Jason Rebello on Keyboards.",1241049600,,694,4.872881355932203

The guest spot with Clapton is really fantastic... definitely a highpoint...sure to induce scratching one's head as to why its taken so long for this to happen again on film...
The band is absolutely stellar and the chemistry between the four players is quite obvious. Many of these performances far outshine the original recordings, and all of them receive a cool makeover in Beck's finely nuanced playing, which has never been more delicate and vocal.",1241049600,,608,5.09
3720355,5,B001NP8PQM,Jeff Beck has finally released a whole concert DVD! What a show it is. An amazing show from the best guitarist of all time. Great band with him.

3720357,5,B001NP8PQM,"Jeff proves himself to be the greatest living electric guitarist in this video. His band is devastating, as well - the obvious chemistry between he & bassist Tal Wilkenfeld is a joy for the viewer, as well as contagious within the band (Particlarly drummer Colaiuta). I'm not sure what Imogen Heap brings to the table, and I've heard Joss Stone sing better than in this performance (In addition to an uncharacteristically out-of-control vibrato, she forgets the lyrics). Clapton is latter-day Clapton... a nice addition, although this DVD would have been a singular triumph withough his presence, because Beck is BECK. I give this my fullest recommendation.",1240790400,,657,5.2075471698113205
3720358,5,B001NP8PQM,"I also picked this up on Blu-ray recently. Even before I bought it I had a feeling it was going to be good, but this is way beyond that. From the opening notes of Beck's Bolero you get a feel for the small club atmosphere that lets you know right away this is going to be an intimate night of music with you seated in the front row. But the clincher for me was John McLaughlin's Eternity's Breath in track two. I hadn't seen the song list ahead of time, so when Beck launched into that piece, quite unexpectedly for me, and which I had never heard outside the Mahavishnu Orchestra, I transcended the whole experience. Whatever happened after that didn't matter. The ultimate had already been achieved.

Of course there is more. There's Nadia, Scatterbrain and Goodbye Porkpie Hat. There's Imogen Heap and Eric Clapton. And there's the Australian high-school dropout, bass phenom Tal Wilkenfeld that everybody's talking about. And yes, she's good. Really good, even though she doesn't get a lot of opportunities to solo. The entire band plays with commitment and a strong sense of unity. I think this is the advantage of the small club. All the performers are able to connect with each other in a way that would not be possible in a large arena.

The instruments on stage - particularly Beck's guitar - are not those you would typically hear in a small venue, so some may nitpick about acoustics. However, overall, the audio and video capture on Blu-ray are very good. The camerawork does not detract from the ambience and for the most part avoids the excessive angle changes every two seconds that has become such an irritating part of many concert videos.

In conclusion, this is a disc to treasure and a performance I will return to again and again. In fact I already have.",1240790400,3,1775,4.646496815286624
3720359,4,B001NP8PQM,Jeff Beck's documentation of his multiple nights at ronnie scotts really has paid off in the sense of capturing the essence of what an intimate performance should be. You can definetly feel the club vibe working for this type of music in it's favor. Very strong musicianship in his musicians as well as Jeff himself. When you get an ensemble as this together you can't really go wrong. I was particurlarly impressed with 21 year old virtuoso bassist Tal Wilkinson even thought I had seen her perform before with Jeff but not a whole concert. I also enjoyed the interview section in the bonus material. Highly recomended for anyone who apreciates and enjoys good music.,1240704000,3,668,4.817391304347826

I saw Beck fronting Rod Stewart and the Faces in the early 70's and his guitar playing was very good back than but it doesn't compare to the way he plays today.  Absolutely amazing.  He is also backed by a truely fantastic, tight backup band.  Clapton also plays on 2 songs but doesn't compare to Beck.  Truely, truely a great DVD.  Rudy C",1240531200,,510,4.03

Jeff unique style fills the room with an amazing sound; musics from all his career. The band also follow his quality and what immediately calls everyone eyes is to the young bass player - a 22 years known as the Most Exciting New Bass Player from the Bass Player Magazine: Tal Wilkenfeld! She takes the responsibility to give life to the bass, and she perform it perfectly. Vinnie Calaiuta is another show inside the show, his drums control is amazing: fast, accurate, with a great stage performance. This is a MUST HAVE Blu-ray Disk!

It would have been nice if they had chosen to include a CD of the tracks. I'd love to listen to this on my iPod, but I'm not too crazy about buying it again on CD (or download). There has been a trend to include ""digital copies"" of movie discs, so why not the same for music concerts?

Jeff Beck at 64 years old still bending unbelievable notes and playing faster than the speed of light is complemented by a stellar back up band.

3720365,5,B001NP8PQM,"Jeff Beck is simply brilliant as he blazes through a set of fusion classics and also a few blues tunes (with Eric Clapton guesting). The band is outstanding, especially monster drummer Vinnie Colaiuta. Tal is still coming into her own here but lays down great grooves and provides a solo highlight on ""Cause We've Ended As Lovers"". Beck is amazing - one guitar, no pick, and few effects. Almost everything is done with the whammy bar, volume knob, and his delicate (and sometimes not so delicate!) fingerwork. The filming is very well done, the sound is great, and the performance and material are top-notch. But why didn't he include two of his most famous tracks, ""Freeway Jam"" and ""Blue Wind""? And of the five vocal tracks the one Imogen Heap original is rather out of place here. But overall a spectacular disc and one of the best music DVD's that I've ever owned.",1240185600,,868,4.6797385620915035

Then you get special guests as follows: Joss Stone, Imogen Heap, and Eric Clapton. You get 21 great songs, including two he & Tal performed on Eric Clapton's 2007 Guitar Festival: ""Cause We've Ended As Lovers"" (Tal does an excellent bass solo during this song), and ""Big Block"".

Other highlights include a great performance of the Beatles classic ""A Day in the Life"" (You can hear the words, through Beck's guitar play ...""I heard the News Today, Oh Boy!...."", ""People Get Ready"" with Joss Stone as vocalist, and ""Blanket"" & ""Rollin & Tumblin'"" with Imogene Heap. Then you get ""Little Brown Bird"" & ""You Need Love"" with Eric Clapton.

Total run time is approximately 155 minutes. Plus you get bonus interviews with Jeff Beck & his band members.

This is an excellent close-up concert, where Jeff Beck demostrates his guitar playing greatness, along with his personal techniqies. Plus, the sexy, 22 year old, bass guitar player ""Tal Wilkenfeld"" is entertaining to watch, plus she's a very talented bass player.

3720368,5,B001NP8PQM,"First - the DVD - so many great things have already been written about it - hard to add much else except to say that it must have been very cool to sit up close in a tiny jazz club and see a living legend like Jeff Beck perform just a few feet away. If Jeff swings the neck of his strat too far out he'd have knocked over somebody's drink! When money comes to upgrade my hardware I will certainly grab the blu-ray disc of this.

And now the show I saw just a few days ago at the MGM grand theater at Foxwoods casino - simply amazing! Much on the DVD setlist was performed, but a few surprises as well - won't spoil it for anyone still yet to see the tour, but go to youtube and key in - jeff beck mgm - and you can see several clips from the show and some even with pretty decent audio quality. Related items on the MGM search will show clips from many of the shows performed during the first full week of April '09 - Philly and NYC included - BECK IS THE MASTER!!!

3720369,5,B001NP8PQM,"Que increible musico!.
Que es lo que diferencia a beck del resto de los guitarristas?
Creo que lo absolutamente imprevisible de su discurso musical.
En todos los grandes musicos, cuando improvisan, puede sentirse la ""coherencia armonica"" del discurso. Es como un escritor o poeta, usa el lenguaje conocido de manera bella y reconocible.
en cambio beck es casi bizarro en su lenguaje. El extraordinario uso de los semitonos y microtonos en su decir colaboran en esto. Su superlativo, unico diria, uso del whammy le pone el broche de oro a su musica.
No puedo decir que todo lo que hace me gusta. cuando recorre caminos tales como un(fast)""fussion jazz-rock"" y anexos me aburre mucho, destacando solo fragmentos de sus solos en estos temas, pero en canciones donde destaca el lirismo o en en arreglos de rock mas simples, puedo afirmar que me parte la cabeza. y pagan por demas la compra de este dvd.

3720370,5,B001NP8PQM,"In a world where ProTools Software can sample and make a chimpanzee sound like the awesome Alison Krauss and a 16 piece jazz orchestra comes Jeff Beck and one of the best rhythm sections of the past few (10?) years.  I got this DVD in the mail yesterday from Amazon and watched it twice last night absolutely in awe of the playing and material from all 4 players.  1st - Jeff Beck - I knew he was legand but I had absolutely underestimated him in my mind without ever owning any of his material.  I plan to seek out the rest of the catalog from here forward.  Great player, great solos, great nuances, chord arrangements, and sheer burning from a whisper to a scream.  2nd - Vinnie Colaiuta - One of my favorite (and 1,000,000 others) favorite players.  I have to bootleg, YouTube, borrow, and import to get good video footage of Vinnie's playing.  This is a great rep of his playing.  I recommend his work with Karizma and Robben Ford for anyone looking for more in the same vain.  3rd - Tal Wilkenfeld - I was really impressed with her as well.  I look forward to a long/great career from her.  And folks, don't get too bent on her age.  Remember that Vinnie Colaiuta, Patrick O'Hearn, and Warren Cuccurullo were all 22 when they played with Frank Zappa, Steve Vai around 20 when he played w/ FZ, Neal Schon was 15 (!!!) when played with Santana, and Tony Williams was 17 when he did '7 steps to Heaven' with Miles Davis.  Last, but not least - Jason Rebello - In the keys cockpit comping, supporting ,and soloing like anyone else in the game.  This guy was a protege of Kenny Kirkland and Sting and has the chops to back it up.  Check out Sting's Brand New Day Live DVD for some great work from Jason.  Last plug - Eric Claptons track is great as well as Joss Stone's (side note: hubba hubba) take on 'People get ready'.
Thank you very much Mr. Beck for giving a distant warning of hope in a time in music where software and marketing are more evident than substance. Yeah, you can tell I'm a drummer/musician with my own share of soapboxes to stand on.  :)  Bob Ruthven  robert.ruthven@sbcglobal.net",1239840000,8,2103,4.415584415584416
3720371,5,B001NP8PQM,"I'll just confirm what everyone else is saying here. Beck's playing is beyond amazing, and to hear someone his age still pushing the envelope of what's possible with an electric guitar is to wonder what all the other geezers are doing (I'm that age, too, so I can say that). The recording here is much better than the companion CD, which is drenched in reverb that puts the music at a distance. Here the sound is immediate and really captures the superlative touch and dynamics that Beck brings to it. The only weak spot here is the editing, which is annoying as hell, never leaving the camera on anything for more than a couple of seconds and jumping all over like a snake on caffeine. I find that this is true of most of the music videos I see these days, and it makes me crazy. If I were at that concert, my eyes wouldn't be jumping around that like (I'd be sick if they did). I'd be focused on the whole band and whoever was soloing at the time. Why can't editors just do the same thing and let the music do the work. This sort of hyper editing seems insulting, as though the music isn't exciting enough. And in this case, it's more than exciting enough. But the performances are so strong that you can listen through the editing and still enjoy it. Absolutely essential DVD.",1239753600,,1279,4.378151260504202
3720372,5,B001NP8PQM,"What Jeff does with a note, is the same as what Piacasso and Dali could do with one stroke of the paintbrush. That is the reason why there are only imitators out there.
My only complaint is as a big fan, money is not the object, access to his material is. He played a five night residence and played with the Bigtown Playboys which there was none presented. I would have paid for a five or six dvd's of all five nights, then really see how Jeff goes night by night.
Tal was great, her beaming smiles told how both how tight the band was and the energy she brings.

I Think it was off Beyond Appearences;could be wrong. It takes ALOT of guts to cover those 2!!! Watching him tackle those 2 after a fine intro of Becks Bolero was almost better than sex. Almost. The only thing I can add also is the fact that you can buy this for a whole 10 dollars!!!Unfreakin real!!!Buyin this disc is a no brainer. Ill be at the ParkWest Fri nite and Millwaukee on Sat with my 14yr old son. He'll get his little blonde fro blown completely back!!!This band is AMAZING!!I haven't seen anything like this in a long while.

3720376,4,B001NP8PQM,"Why does Amazon cross post these reviews?  I don't want to read about the DVD version under the blu-ray title.

What can one say about this video?  It's Jeff freaking Beck.  When is the last time you saw a JB video?  Never.  At 64, the guy comes out of his shell, get's inducted into the RNR Hall of Fame, goes on tour and does a full length video.

This show was taped at Ronnie Scotts in London where JB played for a week.  As far as I can tell, the video is all from the same night.  The band is tight.  I could do without the two guest singers although People Get Ready is a great song.  The songs off of Blow By Blow and Wired are what I came for and the rest to me is filler.  One star off.  I think Tal, the almost jailbait bassist is good but a little gimicky.  She seems to get lost on Space Boogie.  Eric Clapton makes an appearance on a couple tracks and the bonus material is a rock a billy set with the something or other playboys.

I was really excited about this video and watched it straight thru on back to back nights.  Jeff Beck is one of the guitar gods.  It's great to see him (live) looking almost the same as he did 30 years ago.  Still has the same hair style and guitar chops.  Never realised before how much he uses his whammy bar to make the sounds he does.  Would like to have seen more just straight ahead playing but that is not jeff's style.  He would be bored and boring just playing the guitar.

Good BD picture quality but not the best I have seen.  Jazz Legends just sets the bar for BD PQ and this is full star below that.  The sound is pretty incredible and I have yet to detect a studio over dub but still may have been polished up a bit in post production.  Great sound and 5 stars for that.  I don't think the DVD would come close with it's lossy compression.

Eagle Rock, give us more Jeff Beck on DVD or BD, please!",1239321600,6,1857,4.027472527472527

3720378,4,B001NP8PQM,"Superb show.  Jeff Beck is in as fine a form as he could ever be.  The sounds this guy coaxes out of his guitar...amazing.  A virtual greatest hits package!  And yet, Beck was apparently smart enough to intersperse the set with a few guest musicians to break whatever 'monotomy' might have been creeping in with the audience  ( if that were possible with this line-up ).  Speaking of which, WHERE oh WHERE did he find Tal Wilkenfeld?  She is incredible on bass.  She's actually in her early twenties here, but comes across as a teenager just delighted to be sharing the same stage with Beck and Colaiuta.  And she holds her own extremely well!  I just wish her bass was a bit hotter in the mix.  My other complaint was with their treatment of ""Scatterbrain""...they jump into it with guns blazing, at breakneck speed.  It would have been sweet to have begun it slowly, gradually building to the frenzied climax...there's a nice 4/4 'oasis' in the middle, laid back and featuring the wonderful Jason on keyboards, and then it's full throttle back into the furious ending. That's just a matter of personal taste, of course; everthing on this set is subject to interpretation.  As to the guest musicians, Beck is comfortable enough and secure in his ability on guitar to invite no less than the legendary Eric Clapton up for two numbers.  And you simply cannot compare these two virtuosos:  if Beck has the 'edge' for technical ability on guitar--again, highly subjective!--Clapton brings an added dimension with his superb vocals.  For those not caring for the vocal tracks, the companion CD omits them.  This one runs the age gamut:  from the youthful Tal and Jason, to the fifty-plus Vinnie Colaiuta on drums ( monster! ) and sixtyish Beck himself. Everyone here looks like they're having a great time, which is what it's all about.",1239148800,,1831,4.777070063694268
3720379,5,B001NP8PQM,"I cannot recommend this highly enough to anyone who appreciates good rock or blues music. The audio and video quality of the blu-ray is first rate! The performance is completely engaging and draws you in. I loved the interaction between Jeff and the cute bass player. I got the impression they were both having one of the greatest times of their lives during this concert.

The disk has a really great extra on it too - and it's not just something you'd want to watch just once and then forgot (like most extras). This one is another performance but with a complete 7 track set playing Rockabilly with the Big Town Playboys. Personally, I don't like it as much as the main performance, but it's still quite good!

Finally, as if the Jeff Beck band isn't already good enough, they have some very special guests strut their stuff on a few tracks: Eric Clapton, Imogen Heap, and Joss Stone - all very cool!",1239148800,,903,4.533742331288344
3720380,5,B001NP8PQM,"What can you say?  Its amazing, start to finish and when you see Beck and Clapton on stage you have to think about their different musical paths.  One, constantly innovating and taking chances; the other playing it safe.  Beck is actually a little older than Clapton, yet he plays like a young man.

True, sometimes Beck's experiments haven't worked out.  But when he hits, he really, really hits.  And this is one of those times.  There are other videos floating around but for those who wonder what the fuss is all about this is a great way to find out.",1239062400,,555,4.49

I know some people like that, but I had to turn my subs down seven db to get a reasonable balance.  Still more than enough punch - you can still feel the kick drum in your chest even at moderate levels - but more crispness in the treble (which you need to fully get Beck).

3720382,5,B001NP8PQM,"""Wow"" is the first word that comes to mind in trying to describe this concert footage of Jeff Beck at the London jazz club, ""Ronnie Scott's.""

I have seen Jeff Beck play guitar a few times here and there over the years, but never more than a couple songs at one venue.  Now, I pretty much have an idea of all his guitar-playing talents......and it's even more awesome than I had guessed they would be.  This review, thus, is for people not all that familiar with Beck's talents. If you already are, you've already bought this DVD.

In  this concert, you see Beck play everything from jazz to blues to rock to  ballads to fusion.  The camerawork is very good in that you really get a good look at Jeff's ability on the guitar. You see how he produces some of his amazing sounds.

You'll also see what a great band he has put together. Vinnie Colaiuta on drums, Jason Rebello on keyboards and Tal Wilkenfeld on bass are all exceptional musicians and fun to watch. All four members of this group can be seen constantly smiling and really enjoying themselves.  That goes for the three guest stars, too, who are fantastic in here: Joss Stone, Imogen Heap and Eric Clapton.

A great addition to the Blu-Ray disc, and a reason to buy it, is the bonus material beginning with the seven-song rockabilly set with Beck and The Big Town Playboys. These guys do a great job of sounding like the late `50s rockers like Gene Vincent and Carl Perkins.  It ends with a great sax solo on the old Bill Doggett number, ""Honky Tonk."" Great stuff!

In addition, there are interviews with everyone all they're all interesting.....really.  This Blu-Ray disc is worth the extra money and highly-recommended.",1239062400,4,1682,4.604026845637584
3720383,5,B001NP8PQM,"This DVD is for anyone that truly appreciates great music.  Yes, Jeff Beck is a guitar virtuoso but he's foremost an incredible artist.  Forget about all of the over-hyped guitar shredders out there that emphasize speed over soul.  A vintage Stratocaster and a half stack Marshall amp are all he needs to inspires us with some of the most beautiful and gutsy playing I've ever heard. His guitar volume control and whammy bar technique are simply amazing.  While many of Jeff's contemporaries from the old days are resting on their laurels, he's still breaking new ground.

""Kid you're good and play mighty fine...but you ain't no JEFF BECK!""

3720385,5,B001NP8PQM,"The Jeff Beck live at Ronnie Scott's DVD is now available and for $10  every guitarist should have one. Jeff is in great form, seeming happy and relaxed and his playing is quite precise. That man really knows how to work a whammy bar.

The whole band is good, but Drummer Vinny Colaiuta (a Zappa and Sting alumni) especially stands out. Tal Wilkenfeld, the female bassist who looks like a 12 year old, is also very good. Her appearances at the Crossroads show attracted a lot of attention due to her youthful appearance and the fact that she looked incredibly surprised and happy to be on stage with Beck.

On this DVD she doesn't seem as confident in her playing and as extroverted as she did in the band's appearance at the Crossroads festival. (I believe this DVD was shot before the Crossroads concert) However, as in the Crossroads videos, there's still those odd, charming moments when Jeff gives her a gesture of approval after she takes a solo and she looks back with a big proud and happy smile. It's a cross between the look of a proud father and daughter and the look of a lecherous college professor giving approval to the ambitious and lusty female student that he's having an affair with.

In this video we don't see much of keyboardist Jason Rebello, but he does a fine job of responding to Jeff's lines and emulating his predecessors in Beck's bands.

The interviews indicate that the band was put together shortly before the shows were shot, with about one month of rehearsal. Everyone knows their parts, but I think this project could have been taken to another level of excellence if the band had worked together for a longer period of time and had the collective experience required to confidently stretch out and improvise a bit more.

Stereo, Dolby surround and DTS surround soundtracks are provided. As usual the DTS soundtrack sounds audibly better than the Dolby. I hate it when concert films use the rear speakers only for audience noise; I want my DVD to sound better than what the audience heard, and audience noise is not my favorite part of the live performance experience. In this case, the use of surround is good, placing the listener in the middle of the band without being too obvious or gimmicky.

Another of my peeves about concert videos is that they rarely let you see the details of what the guitarist is doing. This one stands out for providing a lot of good shots that will help guitarists figure out how Beck gets his unique sounds.

The choice of material comprises a good ""greatest hits"" for Beck with a nice mix of the fast fusiony material and the slower, soulful material. I would have liked to have heard a bit more of the excellent techno influenced material from his most recent albums, but I'm surely in the minority in that opinion.

There are guest appearances by Joss Stone, Imogen Heap and Clapton. Stone was OK, but doesn't have the maturity and depth to add much to the proceedings, she's just another young Janis/Arethra wannabe as far as I can tell. Imogen is more unique with a quirkier presence that made for a more useful contribution.

Clapton joined the band for two blues numbers, one fast, one slow. Clapton has been in fine form lately, but as a guitarist he's not in the same league as Beck. However, his vocals have never been better and Jeff and Clapton do a nice Yardbirds style raveup on Willie Dixon's ""You Need Love."" (the inspiration for Led Zep's Whole Lotta Love.

This DVD is the only commercially available video of a whole Jeff Beck show and overall they did it up right. If you like Beck there is no doubt that you should get this DVD.",1238630400,103,3617,4.600931677018633

This is a MUST purchase and an absolute gift from BECK to all the guitar fans who have waited sooo long for an official pro-shot gig available commercially. Now I'm going to say a few things that do not diminish the 5 stars but are points I'd like to make. 1. Too bad there are no good views/ camera angles of the amazing drum performance of Vinnie!:( 2. Why Beck doesn't speak about Billy Cobham's ""Stratus"" in the interview is a shame too as it would have been interesting to hear his take on Tommy Bolin. 3. This is not BECK at his finest...It's doubtful he will ever play as well infront of cameras as he might other wise. I have seen him countelss times and when this guy goes off it's other- worldy. There are some moments on this DVD in which he does, but it is a tad conservative in places for BECK. Sorry to those that disagree, but that is a fact. ""Big Block"" is a tad rough. I still LOVE this DVD and will upgrade to the Blue -Ray when the prices come down in 2010 (for the rockabilly set).
I'll probably take some criticism for that last comment but it is a bit conservative in places.(For him).and yes, I totally understand the amazing dynamics of what he is doing with his right hand which is unmatched by any other player in the world today (That we know of) The guest performances are great too..especially I. Heap...She is awesome! Sorry but Clapton is sooo over-rated...BECK SOARS over him like a vulture waiting for the feeding. Yes, Clapton has his unique blues phrasiology and place in history but just doesn't have anywhere near the creativity of JEFF BECK. I know BECK respects Clapton as a player as well but he just doesn't move me like Beck or other players.(He was great in the late 60's on Mayalls album though!

My request was favorably granted, and not only did I run into my Keyboard Player whom I hadn't seen in about 6 months, but I also spoke with my Preacher's Wife, there shopping, too.  I had to meet Dearest ""in 20 minutes"" in the food section, so I next literally ran back to the DVD, etc, department.  Ugh.  I am NOT interested in the ""New Millenium/fifth goodbye tour"" Eagles, Celophane Dion, or the Anti-Hank, Garthie B.  But just as I was thinking, ""I gotta RUN, but whaddya expect?"" I glanced down and saw a Jeff Beck - Jeff Beck, now! - DVD with a ""cutout"" price, only 9 bucks.  Whoah!  That Performer!  That Price!  And then (duh!) viewing the DVD is a treat. Beck does material from nearly all his career, and the band is (horrid eighties adjective, here) AWESOME!  I knew about the drummer, Vinnie Colaiuta, and I was impressed with the new keyboard player, Jason Rebello (no masturbatory synthesizer bleets, bless his heart...in fact, it sounded like he had whatever set to sound like a Hammond B-3), but - WHEW!!! - that bass player, Tai Wilkenfeld - is PHENOMINAL.

The only drawback - folks, these are major league downers! - are the two ""guest vocalists"" JB drags out.  Forgotten-but-not-quite-gone Joss Stone ""does"" ""People Get Ready,"" and her vocal is an insult both to the great Curtis Mayfield who wrote the song, and even to Rod Stewart, a gent I have no great love for, who had ""covered"" the tune with JB back in 1984.  Bad as ""Joss"" was, this other...""individual"" that came out to ""sing,"" Imogen Heap, looked and sounded like the illicit progeny of Tiny Tim and Kate Pierson (B52s).  A great deal of gasping and grunting, I reckon she found, ""sexy"" - NOT!  But still, so as not to close this review negatively:  except for that performance that JB did on the last ""Crossroads"" thing, I'm not aware of any other DVDs of him (unless you have a boot of the 1983 multiple sclerosis concert for Ronnie Lane).
