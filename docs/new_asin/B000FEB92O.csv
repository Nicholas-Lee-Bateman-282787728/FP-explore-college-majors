8121376,5,B000FEB92O,"Wow, there are a lot of DVDs in this package. Almost all of them are good, some better than others. The racism DVD is the best, though they all have something to reccomend them. What I like is that the total package gives you a solid overview of the problems that faced America in the 20th century, from racism to drugs to emerging teenage sexuality. It's a great historical value.",1153440000,,381,4.457142857142857
