555472,5,630308110X,"Very underrated comedy from the 90's! One of my favorites actually. Also, it includes the song ""Idiot Summer"" by Gin Blossoms and also shows them arriving at Waynestock when the credits start rolling. Wow what a flashback!

555781,5,630308110X,"Mike Myers and Dana Carvey reprise their roles from Wayne's World(the original film, based on a skit from Saturday Night Live.)  This is a brilliant comedy that makes no missteps and never lets you rest until the end.
The plot is simple: Wayne and his sidekick want to impress girlfriend Tia Carrere(who's under the spell of Christopher Walken in a wonderful turn as a promoter/mogul.)  In doing so, they run into Chris Farley as a disturbed rock n' roller, the crowd at Makita's(named after hockey great Stan Makita)donut shop (including the clerk who reminds us of 'Al Bundy' strangely enough).  Wayne has to literally fight for his girl with her father in a wonderful spoof of ninja films and that genre.
The concert somehow gets on, Wayne(of course) gets the girl, or does he?  They give us a realistic ending and then a formulaic Hollywood ending just to tweak our sensibilities...
The film throws in the 'kitchen sink' comedically, with ghost apparitions of Jim Morrison and Sammy Davis, Jr., the real life Aerosmith, and best of all, a customized, stretch limousine built from an AMC Pacer...
What's great about this film is one simple concept: they know that we(the audience) are smart and they make the entire film an 'inside joke', but one that we all 'get'.  That's priceless and a rare commodity...",1417824000,,1310,4.856502242152466
555782,5,630308110X,Great classic. I think I like this one better than the first one.,1415664000,,65,4.076923076923077
555783,4,630308110X,Hard too believe it's 21 years old.,1414540800,,35,4.142857142857143
555784,5,630308110X,"""Wayne's World 2"" came out a year after 1992's ""Wayne's World"" with Mike Myers as Wayne Campbell and Dana Carvey as Garth Algar, who run a silly cable show rooted in rock/metal culture. In this sequel, Wayne receives word in a vision from none-other-than Jim Morrison to put on a concert in Aurora, Illinois. He dubs it Waynestock. If he ""builds it"" will they come? I saw this film before the first one in a motel with my wife circa 1994-95 and, by the end, I was crying I was laughing so hard. The scene that put me over the edge was when a certain classic actor appears as a gas station attendant.

Memorable moments abound: The encounter with the albino-eyed city official, Wayne's martial arts fight with Cassandra's father, Wayne's visions with Morrison and the half-naked Indian, and many more.

The original film is actually a let-down compared to this one. Don't get me wrong, it's a solid comedy and consistently amusing if you're in the mood for goofy humor rooted in 70s-90s rock/metal, but there are a number of flat areas. This sequel flows better and is way funnier. It helps if you're up on the rock/metal scene and cinema though, otherwise you won't get half the jokes.

I gauge comedies by how funny they are (naturally), as well as how compelling, and ""Wayne's World 2"" delivers exceptionally on both fronts. It's one of my all-time favorite comedies along with ""Coming to America"" and the original ""Ace Ventura: Pet Detective.""

The film runs 95 minutes and was shot in Chicago and Southern California.

555788,5,630308110X,Wayne's world 2 is based on how Wayne dreams that he sees Jim Morrison from the doors and a weird naked Indian man to bring Waynestock to town. And Cassandra also has a career now but Christopher walken wants to take off with her and that gets Wayne mad so he spys on her. So i won't go in to no more details because i don't want to spoil it anyway this movie stars Mike Myers has Wayne and Dana carvey has Garth and also special guests Alice Cooper and Aerosmith.,1408838400,,464,4.1098901098901095

Wayne Campbell(Mike Myers) struggles to get concert Waynestock off the ground. Wayne's World 2 spoofs kung fu films, The Graduate(1967) and The Doors(1991). Wayne, Garth, and their friends do a Village People homage in one scene. The formula for Wayne's World 2 is similar to the first film. The sad ending, the Scooby Doo ending, and the happy ending are crammed into one film. Christopher Walken played the film's  ""bad guy"". Drew Barrymore made a cameo in the film. Myers moved on to the Austin Powers movies in the late 1990's. His career has been in trouble since the 2008 bomb The Love Guru. Myers and Dana Carvey played Wayne and Garth on an MTV special in 2008. Wayne's World 2 is a decent sequel.",1360627200,,812,4.6

We never stop enjoying the Three Stooges; sex jokes; passing gas; and the wonderful gags featured in Wayne's World. Jeff Daniels once said that Dumb And Dumber was designed for 15-year-old boys. This movie is close.
 Wayne and Garth are recently moved into their own homes, still recently out of high school, rubbernecking whenever hotties walk by, maintaining the kind of intensely close friendship that you see among teen-age guys. However, it's time to grow up. Wayne gets this from Jim Morrison while Garth's messenger is Kim Basinger. Like the original, this terrific sequel keeps the clever laughs coming in a variety of ways: parodies of famous movies, cameo appearances by stars that will surprise you, hilarious dialogue, even looks back at our pop culture. There's a tribute to 70s Chinese martial arts movies that should have you roaring. That two mature men (well, physically anyway, remember?) like Myers and Carvey can very believably come off as kids just out of high school is impressive, and that this sequel can come so close to duplicating the quality of the original is equally so.
 Enjoy it--unless you've decided to grow up...",1246752000,,1214,5.0049504950495045

I also thought this ""sequel"" was better than the first Wayne's World movie anyway. From what I see here, most people agree with that.

I did not appreciate showing a minister blaspheming. That's Hollywood for you. Without the extreme irreverence in here, I might have held onto this DVD ust to have something stupid to laugh at once every few years....and to laugh especially  at that scene when Dana Carvey meets Bassinger in the laundromat .",1245715200,,607,4.611111111111111

555978,2,630308110X,"""WAYNE'S WORLD 2', the 1993 sequel to the financially successful 1992 film was released in the theaters.  And although not as successful as the first film, the sequel still manages to contain a lot of the wackiness and craziness that Mike Meyers and Dana Carvey can dish out of their popular SNL characters.

The film is based on the popular Saturday Night Live skit ""Wayne's World"" featuring Mike Myers as Wayne Campbell and Dana Carvey as Garth Algar, hosts of an Aurora, Illinois cable access show ""Wayne's World"" in which the guys talk about their personal lives and rock music.  And quite low budget and shot in the basement of Wayne's parents home.

During that time, ""Saturday Night Live"" definitely had a surge in popularity with their current comedy lineup and the skit was so successful that various catchphrases from that skit became part of American pop culture as people would use words like ""That's what she said"", ""Shchyea"" and ""Schwing"".  And because the first film was quite successful and made money, a second film was released a year later.

For the sequel, SNL producer Lorne Michaels selected fellow Canadian Stephen Surjik who was known for his work on the show ""The Kids in the Hall"" and a return for writers Bonnie Turner and Terry Turner.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""WAYNE'S WORLD 2' is presented in 1080p High Definition.  If there is one thing I've noticed is that many films that appear during the late 80's and up to the mid-90's tend to have a soft, dull look in terms of picture quality on Blu-ray.  The good news is that ""WAYNE'S WORLD 2' features plenty of outdoor shots.  A lot of sunlight and there are scenes that look nice and colorful and vibrant.  The bad news is that throughout the film, you can see dust particles and white spotting at times.  Granted, unless you are truly looking for it, then you will see it.

I looked back at the my review for the original DVD and I mentioned no artifacts and dust but watching it on Blu-ray, it was quite evident.

As for the audio, ""WAYNE'S WORLD 2' is featured in English 5.1 Dolby TrueHD and French and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital.  For those who are familiar with ""WAYNE'S WORLD"", it's always about the crazy dialogue and the music.  And this second film does feature music by Aerosmith singing ""Dude, Looks Like a Lady"" to the Village People with ""Y.M.C.A"" and Joan Jett & the Blackhearts ""I Love Rock n' Roll"".  Music is crystal clear, dialogue is clear and the soundtrack is primarily front channel driven.  There are some scenes such as a ""Jurassic Park"" parody where you see the low frequencies in your subwoofer being utilized.  But all in all, the audio quality was good, but nothing spectacular.

Subtitles featured are in English, English SDH, Spanish and Portuguese.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Wayne's World 2' comes with the same features from the 2001 DVD. Primarily the one commentary and one featurette.

  * Audio Commentary by Director Stephen Surjik - It would have been great to have Mike Meyers and Dana Carvey as part of the commentary but Surjik's commentary was more appreciative of the works of the various talent and ideas that were utilized by Mike Myers and Dana Carvey.  Commentary track was a bit on the dry side and I suppose I was expecting a bit more humor.  If anything, Stephen wanted people to laugh and that was his goal.  Also, to not be anything like the original film, which I feel he accomplished.
  * The 14-minute featurette ""Wayne's World 2 Extreme Close-Up: Exclusive Cast & Crew Interviews"" - This featurette features interviews with  Producer Lorne Michaels talking about why he wanted Stephen Surjik to direct.  Director Stephen Surjik and the many talent of ""WAYNE'S WORLD 2'.  Meanwhile, the cast talked about their characters, the role of the character's for the film and meeting and working together with Aerosmith.  You get interesting tidbits of Aerosmith being invited for the original film to Tia Carrere talking about working with Christopher Walken.

First, let's talk about the positive.  ""WAYNE'S WORLD 2' is a sequel to the popular hit film.  You are no doubt going to laugh or be intrigued by a variety of scenes that parody popular films or just characters that are just wild and crazy.

With that being said, having watched this film several times already, I'm a bit critical when it comes to the sequel.  ""WAYNE'S WORLD 2' is no doubt a very fun film to watch bu the truth is that I felt it was a bit too rushed.  I felt with the original, Mike Meyers brought a lot to the original screenplay but this time around, not being a writer for the film, the sequel was a bit average for my taste.

I did enjoy the appearance and performance by Aerosmith, seeing the cameos of several celebrities in the film was pretty cool.  Kim Basinger, Heather Locklear and Drew Barrymore were absolutely gorgeous and to see Charlton Heston on this film, seemed unreal.  And of course, there were other talent that brought some comic relief such as James Hong who plays Cassandra's father, Jeff Wong.  His fighting scenes with Wayne was quite fun to watch.  And of course, you get film parodies such as ""The Graduate"" and ""Thelma & Louise"".

Not to say that ""WAYNE'S WORLD 2' was a bad movie because it wasn't.  I was entertained, I just felt that the original was more fresh and crazy, while the second which was also as crazy but had a storyline that felt a bit rushed.  Part of the enjoyment of the ""WAYNE'S WORLD"" SNL segment and the original film is showing the cable access show ""WAYNE'S WORLD"".  It seems as if that was all ditched in the second film.

I went to see both films in the theater and during that time, I really enjoyed the SNL ""WAYNE'S WORLD"" segments and so, there were so many golden moments from that original film that just made me laugh.  Scenes such as the QUEEN ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" to certain jokes being quite fresh and new.  I felt that there were scenes that I just felt were classic and memorable.

With ""WAYNE'S WORLD 2', it was more like, been there and seen that.  After all these years, the only thing that stuck in my mind is Kim Basinger and the beautiful Olivia D'Abo (of the ""Wonder Years"") looking quite weird as the spitting image of Garth.  And of course, Aerosmith and ""The Graduate"" parody.

But overall, ""WAYNE'S WORLD 2' is about getting people to laugh and there are plenty of scenes that probably will.

For many films, sometimes the sequels are compared to the originals and we have high expectations.  And for ""WAYNE'S WORLD 2', personally for me, it fell way short of my enjoyment of the original film.  Again, not to say its not funny but I enjoyed the original so much more.

And last, for those who own ""WAYNE'S WORLD 2' on DVD, sure...its a better audio an video improvement from the DVD release.  But it still has the same two special features from the DVD and it's not exactly a film you want to show off to friends in terms of picture or audio quality.

Granted, it's been sixteen years since the film was released and nearly nine years since the original DVD release but there's no real incentive to double dip and rebuy this on Blu-ray if you own the original DVD.  That is unless you want the Dolby 5.1 TrueHD soundtrack and to watch this film via 1080p High Definition.

If you do not own ""WAYNE'S WORLD 2' on DVD and are feeling nostalgic about watching Wayne and Garth all over again, then definitely pick this film up.",1242086400,3,7394,4.63412759415834

556041,5,630308110X,"Wayne's World 2 was released in the magical year of 1993. Yes, the very same year that gave us the emergence of the Dogg, Sonic 2 and the legendary&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Death-Ring/dp/B00069QD74/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Death Ring</a>. This film obviously is the sequel to the wildly successful original. The first film was a huge commercial success, and it gave us the famous Bohemian Raphsody scene, but not much else. Wayne's World 2 is a much better, and infinitely funnier film. We will not argue about this. The difference might be as simple as Garth not being a complete tool in the sequel. Also, the first film was made on the strength of the wonderful SNL skits. But, the sequel was more like the skits than the original, based mostly on Wayne and Garth doing Wayne and Garth things. Those things, in the sequel, are among the funniest in Sid's comedy collection.

The plot of Wayne's World 2 is a very simple one. Wayne is visited in a dream by Jim Morrison and is told to put on a concert in Aurora. Casandra is still Wayne's girl, looking a good 50 times hotter than she did in the original, where she still kind of had a Chinee takeout counter girl look to her. Because of Casandra's significant upgrade in smokin hottness, Wayne's got some compitition. Wayne has to compete with the one and only Christopher Walken. Walken plays the part of a cocky calculating record exec from Casandra's label to perfection. So Wayne not only has to battle Walken for his woman, he also has to put on a killer rock show in Aroura. Sprinkle in at least a laugh per scene, and that's your flick. A comedy classic.

We, Sid the Elf, would be doing ourselves and the film a great disservice if we did not cover the highlights of Wayne's World 2. We loved this movie growing up, and we still love it today, maybe even more. First, there's the classic Stan Mikita's drive-thru scene where Wayne messes with the poor sap working at Mikita's by dropping sylables from words in his order, but the guy gets it anyway. Just classic. If you haven't tried this at least once, you're missing out just trust us. Every scene with Walken is perfect. In fact, it could be argued that he makes the movie, including the line we used for the title, and allowing us to perfect a dead-on Walken impression. Then, there's Del Preston, the guy who helps the fellas put on the show. The best scene in the movie possibly belongs to him when Wayne and Garth find him sleeping hanging upside down in his apartment. His ""That's my old lady,"" line has been a staple of Sid's for years now. There was also a small apperance by Chris Farley probably just acting naturally. Also, Jeff Wong was brilliant. He apparently has given up being an evil General in the Vietnimese army from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Missing-in-Action/dp/079284582X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Missing in Action</a>to just be Casandra's concerned father here. He contributes the hilarious fight scene between himself and Wayne.

To be honest, Wayne's World 2 has too many great moments to go through them all. It is a much funnier movie than the original, and it is in the Sid the Elf pantheon of comedies. We even made it a part of our legendary Bahamas trip, watching it the night before we left. This caused us to spout roughly 35,000 ""What?"" from the drive-thru scene and send a fat life into an irreversible downward spiral. This film is deeply woven into the iegend of Sid the Elf, so you know it's wonderful. If you see this movie based on us and don't crack up at least 10 times, we'll give you a full refund of this review. Seriously, if you haven't seen Wayne's World 2, join me now. We guarantee you will say ""thanks a pantload, Sid.""",1219190400,5,3787,4.832049306625578

In their ode to die-hard 80s hair band fans, Wayne and his faithful sidekick, Garth, set out on another adventure.  This time around, Wayne begins to question his mortal purpose.  He is soon visited in a dream by a naked indian man who leads him through the desert sands to Jim Morrison.  Morrison tells him that the purpose of his life is to put on a concert.

Of course, there are obstacles... Namely, Bobby (played by Christopher Walken), the smooth-talking and suave record producer in charge of managing Cassandra's (Wayne's girlfriend) budding music career.

Garth has issues of his own, though. He has just ""gotten his first pubes"", so he is eager to become familiarized with the ways of the woman. A snake of a woman, played by Kim Basinger attempts to take advantage of his innocence and loyal nature. The scenes Dana Carvey shares with Basinger are hilarious.

This is just a funny and ridiculous movie. With a good cast of actors, the story leads from one funny scene to the next.  Carvey and Myers are great together...

Highly recommended for fans of SNL comedy.",1145923200,3,1266,4.6877828054298645
556047,4,630308110X,"Wayne's World 2, starring Mike Myers as Wayne and Dana Carvey as Garth is the short awaited sequel to the  smash hit of 1992.

Wayne and Garth have moved out of the parents basement and now have their own place across town, still doing their low budget local access TV show and still worshiping every rock musician out there. Wayne and his girlfriend Cassandra, from the first movie are still an item only now she has a manager trying to help her get her career started.

This time Wayne has been sent a message from the spirit of Jim Morrison, of the Doors who tells Wayne he must put on a concert in Aurora and find the meaning of his life. Wayne takes the message very seriously and even flies to London, England to find Del Preston who used to be friends with Jim way back when. Now our duo must deal with putting on their TV show, raising enough money for a permit to hold the show Wayne titles ""Waynstock"" and deal with Cassandra being taken away from him by her manager. Not to mention Wayne has to prove himself worthy with Cassandra's father and Garth has a close encounter with a beautiful woman, Honey Hornee' (Kim  Basinger) who takes an instant liking to him but may be up to more then just a one night stand.

Overall the movie is on par with the first one. All the funny one liners and sight gags and situations fly by us with the same familiarity that the first gave us. We jump right back into the universe we left a year ago and it's like we never left it. A classic mock Kung Fu fight between Wayne and Cassandra's father with dubbed English while they talk is a priceless moment. As well as Wayne, Garth and two friends dressed up in outfits that the Village People music group wore spying on Cassandra and her manager only to be spotted by them and having to perform as said group in a Male only bar.

The only thing holding this movie back is that it seems too familiar, like we did this all before. There is enough original in this to make you forget the first but too much was taken from the first to make it more like a different version of the same. It still holds it own though quite well. Many more stars this time around play bit parts like for instance Drew Barrymore, Jay Leno, Heather Locklear, Metalica and Rip Taylor having parts that are just randomly thrusted upon us. Some play themselves while others playing different parts. Of course we can't forget the late and great Chris Farley who I must admit seemed a bit out of place in the part they gave him, but always cool to see him any time.

While some of the jokes were recycled from the first movie, Ie) the alternate ending and the new guy stealing Wayne's girlfriend from him while Wayne gets jealous all the while.. there are some great new gags. I loved the moment towards the end when Wayne stops at a gas station for directions and some bad old actor is giving Wayne some sad story about the street he is looking for only for Wayne to say he wants a better actor for this part and they suddenly change the actor before our eyes to someone better. Some new jokes didn't work like Wayne and Garth being lifted on their backs at the concert they are at and after they are placed down a lot of weird items are being sent in the same manner to the security guards. That was probably one of those better on paper then it actually turned out to be moments that should have been left on the drawing board. It is also a bit dated, jokes that were funny in 1993 may seem a little silly now. For instance the Jurassic Park moment but that's to be expected in these type of comedies. Usually popular pop culture of the time will be spoofed and if anything it brings back fun memories of yesteryear.

Overall if you enjoyed the first film, there is no reason not to get this one. It has all the same actors we loved, even a cameo from Ed O'Neil reprising his Glen role from the first. It may not have the same originality and charm the first did, but it is a welcome addition to any fan of a good comedy, follow up to a good film or something that the whole family can get a good laugh to.

The DVD has commentary from the director and about 20 minutes in little tidbits from the cast about moments in the film. More then worth it, especially at the more then affordable price.

Check out the adventures of Wayne and Garth one last time as they put on the greatest concert in Aurora, IL history. You won't be sorry you did.",1137456000,7,4406,4.272182254196642
556048,5,630308110X,"Seriously, this is one of my all time favorite movies. I 100% agree with ""a kids review"" ..but I knew I would love this movie before I even saw it! It is surprisingly great for a sequel, that is exactly what I thought as well! It has the same characters, their same mannerisms, but the story takes a different turn this time, not focusing as much on ""Wayne's World"" the show, but as Wayne puts together Waynestock.

Chris Farley is hilarious as usual, and during tryouts for the crew for Waynestock, there is a hilarious scene where Chris gets pelted by tennis balls after not being able to keep up with the fast moving balls he is supposed to go after! HILARIOUS!

I love that Wayne is helped out by his dream and ""Jim Morrison"" ..very funny!

Bottom line, if you are reading this page, you obviously have some interest in Wayne's World, so if you have seen the first one and loved it, you probably will love the second one as well! I hold both in high regard, I think they are both hilarious in different ways, and if I had to choose, I prefer the second movie over the first, because the characters are established, and it is a perfect idea for Wayne to put on a concert!

556049,2,630308110X,"With ""Wayne's World"" becoming a surprising box office smash in 1992, the people at ""Saturday Night Live"" were itching for a sequel to continue the succes it had with the recurring sketch. Enter ""Wayne's World 2"". Exit funny.

There are a number of reasons this film doesn't work. For starters, by the time this film was released in 1993, ""Wayne's World"" wasn't even that popular a sketch anymore, as sketches like Matt Foley, Motivational Speaker and the Gap Girls shoved it out of the picture. Dana Carvey had left the show just before the film was released, so it's obvious in reprising Garth his heart isn't in it. The same can be said for Mike Myers, who beats Wayne into the ground with such a hackjob. He essentially overacts here, whereas in the first film he let it flow effortlessly. Tia Carerre, the only other returning cast member from the first film, is essentially given nothing to do, and if it wasn't for the fact that she was such an essential part of the film, she should have just sat this one out. Even worse, perhaps worst of all, Christopher Walken (playing essentially the same role Rob Lowe did lightyears better in the first) wastes his talents as a sleazy record executive trying to ruin Wayne and steal Cassandra. Sounds familliar, doesn't it? And it's obvious that Waynestock was added just so this film didn't come off as dead on carbon copy of the first.

Granted, there are a few things that make this film work. The Villiage People sequence in the gay bar is inspired and very funny, as is Garth's fantasy of him at a Kenny G. concert. Also, like the first film, there is a heavy reliance of cameos, this time by Ed O'Neill (reprising his role as the disturbing donut shop owner), Aerosmith (who do a great performance of ""Shut Up And Dance"" at the end), Drew Barrymore, Kim Basinger (though she has somewhat of a main part as Garth's girlfriend), Olivia D'Abo (as Garth's female doppleganger), Rip Taylor, Kevin Pollack, Heather Locklear and most surprisingly, Charlton Heston. Also, be on the lookout for Chris Farley, who appears sporadically as a friend of Wayne and Garth's.

Other than these saving graces of sorts, ""Wayne's World 2"" is essentially a one star movie. Stick with the timeless part one. Just wish I hadn't bought it as a boxed set, because now I have to keep part two. Oh well.",1114300800,5,2329,4.648058252427185

With so many comedic performances like when they make fun of the Graduate. Or the infamous Kim Basinger line, ""Garth, I'm going to be frank,"" while Garth replies, ""Okay, but can I still be Garth?"" It's no wonder why this film was so successful.

556090,1,630308110X,"Wayne, Garth, and friends take it too far this time.  The first ""Wayne's World"" film has some classic scenes that are timeless (the ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" headbanging and the airport scenes come to mind immediately) while the references in this film are dated, as if it's concocted almost entirely of throwaway bits that were rejected for SNL.  That show is a good place for timely references, and the box office for this film didn't suffer for it, I'm sure; however, on DVD all these years later, one wonders why anyone thought it funny back in the day.

I never did get around to seeing this when it first came out, and that's a shame because it may have still been funny at the time.  With the passage of a decade or so, this limp excuse for a sequel is shown for the blender humor it is:  Toss in a few scattered, disjointed, dated, unconnected gags and puree until done.  Even the lovable goofiness of the lead characters is practically nonexistent, as Myers & Carvey are trying too hard to sell their weak material.  Any film in need of a laugh track or live audience is in serious trouble, and frankly I needed cues to tell me which parts were supposed to be funny.  The first film needed no help at all.

And the whole ""Garth is seduced by Kim Basinger"" bit is so far over-the-top ridiculous that it just doesn't work.  Probably looked like a good idea on paper, but instead of inspiring laughs it only inspires one to poke fun at the filmmakers here.  At least Kim never looked better!  She is truly a one-babe band; it she were a president she'd be Babe-raham Lincoln, to borrow an old SNL line of Wayne's.

I could go on and on, but won't waste your time.  Unfortunately, ""Wayne's World 2"" will do that and say ""Thanks for wasting your bucks on me too.""  Don't fall into that trap.  This is one of the few films I've seen that was so bad that I literally couldn't stomach the idea of watching the whole thing, and just shut it off about halfway through.

556091,3,630308110X,"WAYNE'S WORLD 2 has some bright spots (i.e. the ""Village People"" segment in the gay bar) and has its funny digs on pop culture and movies of the day (i.e. THE DOORS & JURASSIC PARK), but somehow the energy level is not there from the first movie and Mike Myers seems bored with the character.  There were some reports that Dana Carvey almost didn't make the sequel because his part (as Wayne Campbell's sidekick, Garth Algar) was limited and Myers had to do some rewrites to the script to appease him.  Also, some of the plot is recycled from the first film. Cassandra (Tia Carrere) is being wooed by another executive-type slime ball coming between her and Wayne.  In the first movie, Rob Lowe was brilliant as tv executive Benjamin. One could sense the comic timing underneath his low-key but evil persona.  This time around,Christopher Walken plays a record producer (Bobby Cahn) almost in the same vain but there is no humor in his character at all. Walken's comic talents are wasted because he plays his character serious (too serious) in the WW2 to the point of being non-existent in a film which is supposed to be a comedy. Lastly, the sub-plot with Garth and love interest Honey Hornee (Carvey and Kim Basinger) seemed unneccessary (probably the result of Myers's writing appeasement to Carvey) even though Basinger was very hot in the film. Overall, the film is very unorganized and disjointed, the main plot device of Wayne trying to put on a pop festival (Waynestock) is not very inventive (the Del Preston character is stereotypical if not bizarre), the relationship triangle of Wayne, Cassandra and another executive-type was a retread from the first film, and many of the characters don't seem to be on the same page (even the presence of the late Chris Farley didn't add punch to the ensemble).

There are some exceptions: ""Mission Impossible 2"", ""Godfather Part II"", ""Spider Man 2"", and the ""Lethal Weapon"" and ""Die Hard"" sequels"". One that is not an exception is ""Wayne's World 2"". This sequel to the 1991 blockbuster lacks the freshness that made the first one so great.
There are several things that are wrong with this film. First, Mike Myers (Wayne) and Dana Carvey (Garth) overact. Whereas in the first film they let it flow effortlessly in terms of their performances, they seem to be trying to hard to recapture the magic of the film. Maybe it was because Carvey was in the processs of leaving ""Saturday Night live"" and was disinterested in playing Garth again. Plus, as one reviewer pointed out, this one actually had a plot. Unlike the first one which captured Wayne and Garth being themselves, this one has them actually acting like adults. The only similarity I found is between Rob Lowe's character in the first film and Christopher Walken in this one. The only difference is that Lowe's character had a smarmy charm  to him that made you love to hate him. Here, the usually excellent Walken makes you just hate him, without ever giving the notion to say, ""hey, for the villian, he's charming in a strange sort of way"". Another flaw to the film is that Penelope Spheeris didn't direct it. She made the magic happen in the first film. Here, new guy Steven Surjik doesn't seem to be putting in any effort. Plus, the music here stinks with the exception of Aerosmith. The only times in this film in which I laughed are when Garth is havng his teeth fixed at a Kenny G concert, the Kevin Pollak eye sequence, and the Village People scene, whereas in the first one I laughed at just about every scene.
Extras are better than the film. There's another documentary. In fact, if it wasn't for the scenes I mentioned, this would be the sole reason to buy this movie. A horrible way to end a great series. Let's hope a third will be released soon.",1089417600,3,1987,4.581460674157303

556095,5,630308110X,"Wayne's World 2 came to theaters on December 10,1993. That month also came sequels to SISTER ACT and BEETHOVEN. Wayne's World is now taped in the building where Acme Doll Factory once operated in. Wayne and Garth are now living together(platonically of course). Wayne and Garth attend an Aerosmith concert in downtown Chicago(part of Aerosmith's GET A GRIP tour). They meet Heather Locklear(as herself in a cameo) who is also in attendance. Wayne is still dating Cassandra(Tia Carrere). She now has a new producer Bobby(Chris Walken). Wayne and Garth plan to form an all-star concert called Waynestock(parody of Woodstock,the famous '69 concert held in upstate New York). One day at a business luncheon,Wayne spies on Cassandra and Bobby,angering Cassandra when she learned of it. So they broke up briefly again. Chris Farley plays Milton,an obnoxious buddy of Wayne's and Garth's. Wayne and Garth fly to England to meet a guy named Del Preston who helps organize Waynestock. Surprise,Cassandra plans to marry Bobby and the wedding almost happened! Also in the film we meet Cassandra's father,who is impressed by Wayne's knowledge of Cantonese,which he learned in the first film. It was the father who told Wayne about the Cassandra/Bobby wedding. The father told Wayne on the phone,""You're an excellent warrior but I require more in a son-in-law"". Wayne and the father briefly do a sword duel. At Waynestock,guess who arrives at the request of Wayne and Garth? Their idols,Steven Tyler,Joe Perry,Brad Whitford,Joey Kramer and Tom Hamilton,aka Aerosmith. They perform from their GET A GRIP album,SHUT UP AND DANCE. In the Aerosmith concert scene,they perform DUDE(Looks Like A Lady).",1064102400,,1683,5.307116104868914
556096,5,630308110X,"When I was getting ready to watch this movie I was saying to myself ""there is no way it will be as good as the first"" I was right. While this movie was still very funny, it just wasn't as fall down funny as the original. The problem was this one focused too much on a completely diffrent plot rather than the actual show. They only show footage of Wayne And Garth doing the show I think twice in the movie. This one has more of a ""plot"" than the 1st. Which kind of ruins the Wayne's World fun that they brought to the 1st.
In Wayne's World 2, Wayne is now out of his parents house and into his own appartment and he is living his dream: doing Wayne's World for a living. The movie starts off hilarious with a Batman spoof and Wayne and Garth attending an Aerosmith concert.
That same night, Wayne is visited in a dream by Jim Morrison of The Doors who tells him he must put on a rock concert in Chicago called Waynestock (Woodstock). And he must travel to England or something to find an old rock star to help him out.
But Wayne then makes this already challenging task into something even more hard by telling a record producer all of these great bands that are going to be there off the top of his head to impress his girlfriend, Cassandra. He then wins over her attention from her producer (who Cassandra is actually interested in throughout the movie) but realizes that doing what he says will be next to impossible. So now he has to deal with setting up an almost impossible concert while still trying to keep his relationship going with Cassandra.
This movie did have some hilarious moments such as the japanese fight scene between Wayne and Cassandra's father where their voices are dubbed in English just like an old japanese movie. And of course some more of the random things popping up as in the 1st save this movie from being completely bad. But still this movie will never be as good or funny as the original Wayne's World. Still worth the buy though
""Wayne's World 2"" runs for about 90 minutes. It is rated PG-13 for language, sexual humor, and some cartoonish violence.",1041552000,,2084,4.401554404145077
556097,5,630308110X,"Somewhere in the world, there are probably people who don't understand why Mike Myers's character, Wayne Campbell, is funny--which is too bad. Granted, the laughs are often cheap and silly, but there's no one who can embody a comic character and riff within that character the way Myers does. Wayne and his pal Garth (Dana Carvey) were fixtures on Saturday Night Live before the unexpected success of Wayne's World, which is about what happened when they tried to take their local cable-access show citywide. This time, they want to stage Waynestock, a mammoth rock festival in their little Chicago suburb, even as Wayne copes with girlfriend Tia Carrere's interest in record-company exec Christopher Walken. For extra fun, Garth gets involved with the babelicious Kim Basinger. Yes, the humor is scattershot and the plot is lame--but you'll find yourself laughing nonetheless.",1041465600,,877,5.271428571428571
556150,3,630308110X,"Wayne and Garth are back and well, just back. Wayne had a dream about a naked native man who took him to Jim Morrison. He must put together the biggest concert in Aurora, Illinois. Well, it takes forever for them to actually assemble the concert, Waynestock. Because before that, Wayne fights his girlfriend's father in subtitles and he gets shunned by Cassandra's new record producer. Not as funny as the first, but Chris Farley shows up to make things better. Enough partying already.",1031875200,,486,4.867469879518072

556154,2,630308110X,"Don't get me wrong, I *love* the original Wayne's World.  But WW2 suffers from a classic case of sequelitis: 90% of it is a tired retread of the humor from WW, without the freshness that made WW so brilliant.  Of course, that other 10% is worth seeing (in fact, it's worth seeing this movie more than once for the Village People bit alone).  But, um, worth buying?  Shhhyeah!  Maybe if you have this, like, weird obsession with Mike Myers in his underwear...",990576000,2,458,4.536585365853658

Wayne's view of his career prospects: ""I have an extensive collection of nametags and hairnets.""
...and make 90 mins of them. Throw in a bit of the YMCA and some kung-fu capers (one of the funniest, satirical moments in movie history) and you can't not like this movie. Christopher Walken is also excellent as Bobby, the nasty record producer for Cassandras band.
This movie is much better than any other comedy because the characters are so hillarious- much more evolved than Austin Powers, less catchphrases. In a word: Ex-ce-leeeeent!",982108800,,766,4.7669172932330826
