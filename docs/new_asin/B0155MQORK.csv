8732719,5,B0155MQORK,"Good character study of a tailor with a local business, (circa 1947),  who dreams of making bigger money by providing suits for the mobsters located in a ""social club"" around the corner from the tailor shop. When the tailor's wife accidentally knocks the bumper off the limo owned by the mob boss, a major threat to the tailor and his family takes place, the solution for which is that the tailor finally gets his wish to go to work for the mob. When he ultimately realizes that he wants to get out of his obligations to the mob, the story gets suspenseful as he wrestles with ideas as to how he can do this and remain alive. A double twist ending makes this film unforgettable.",1463097600,,678,4.424
8732720,2,B0155MQORK,"Unlike the other reviewer, I was not very impressed with this movie.
Untypically for early 21st century movies, this movie did have a positive message of moral determination in the face of tyranny.  THAT was a positive and welcome thing.
That being said, I find very little else in this film to recommend.  There was nothing crass or offensive but the acting was mostly pretty bad and the scripting was largely predictable and poorly developed with black and white 2D characters.  Yes, it was a small movie but there are hordes of excellent wannabe writers/actors who could have turned this into a tiny jewel.  It never drew me into it beyond the moral subject. The people seemed to develop those clear morals beyond lip service only AFTER choosing the route along the path that skirted or plunged into the morass they claimed to want to avoid-- as humans are generally prone to do.
It reminded me of a HS sophomore film class project or one of those movies they show in the basement of the church to the Christians in the congregation who are personally struggling with fighting sin and backsliding and looking for reinforcement of the rewards of living in grace.",1460592000,,1164,4.747524752475248
8732721,5,B0155MQORK,"High comedy and nostalgia fuse to delightful effect in SHARKSKIN. The place is New York's Italian Harlem, the time the late 1940s. John Aprea is Mike, a skilled tailor who has never quite succeeded on the scale his talent would merit. Christopher Amitrano is his son Sammy - a genial social climber who thinks his Dad should cultivate the local mob bosses. Mike hates those guys. As an Italian-American, he loathes the way mafia guys just take over everything and poison whatever they touch. By a sharp comedic twist, his wife (Donna Ponterotto), forced to conceal a blast of front-end damage she's done to a mobster's car fast-talks him into ordering a fancy sharkskin suit from Mike. Pretty soon another crime boss - that first big lug's rival - wants an identical suit built. Mike must work overtime to extricate himself from this pickle. The film looks like The Godfather while its hard comedic bounce recalls the rubber-bat extremes of Miller's Crossing. As with that film, the over the top funny moments are anchored by the soft-spoken truthfulness of Aprea's lead performance, as well from such support players as David Proval, as the wily Uncle Charlie, and Cara Pifko, outstanding as Franki, a young woman for whom contact with these big lugs has made her wise-before-her-time. The exceptionally beautiful camera work by Elie Smolkin and Paul McIlvane has both a golden color palette and a rich element of contrast (the hard shadows one enjoys in old black & white films) which forcefully support the feeling of a film not just about the 40s from them. Dan Perri, who both wrote and directed this charming farce, brings a wealth of interesting experience in the door with him. For over 40 years he's been a top title designer: he created the dynamic opening graphics for such diverse classics as The Exorcist; Taxi Driver; Nashville: Star Wars; Raging Bull; Insomnia, Gangs of New York and The Aviator. Coupled with such chops is a subtler but no less important abundance of first-hand life experience. As extreme and even slapstick-buffoonish as his people and events may sometimes become - their extremities feel grounded, lived-in, as will any event you look back on across decades and ask yourself: ""Did that actually happen?"" Yet you know it did. Through thick and thin, Perri keeps this lifelike feeling alive.",1454889600,6,2325,4.948849104859335
