Can't wait for Nikki and the Perfect Stranger to be released.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pieces-of-Easter/dp/B00BH1V94W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pieces of Easter</a>",1363910400,2,318,8.666666666666666
5620906,5,B00BH1V94W,"We loved this movie!  We have seen all of the movies by Jefferson Moore and know what fine quality and
family friendly films they make so we were really looking forward to seeing this one!  I don't think I have
ever seen a movie with Easter as a theme except ones about the life of Christ or the Resurrection so I
was curious as to how things would all tie in with this movie.  They did, from the music, to the scenery,
the storyline...it was wonderful and kept us chuckling throughout!  Thank you so much for making this!",1363824000,2,522,4.295918367346939
5620907,5,B00BH1V94W,"I absolutely loved this movie!!!  It was so funny.  The interaction between the two stars, Jefferson Moore and Christina Karis, was really great; it seemed as if they had known each other for a long time.  The supporting cast of characters were just as funny, and some of the scenes had me laughing louder than I have in a long time.  Even the minor characters in the film, the restored truck, the rabbit, and even the tractor, matched so well with the entire film.  The music was such a wonderful fit with the movie, too.  I hope that you all see this incredible film, and the others produced by Kelly's Filmworks.  They are beautiful films that are able to be seen by your entire family without worrying about the content.  I'm sure that anyone who sees this amazing movie will love it, just like I did!!!",1363824000,8,807,4.47945205479452
5620908,1,B00BH1V94W,"There is no sound. I was really disappointed when I tried to watch it and I could not hear it. It didn't work on my Kindle fire, PC, or Roku player. Amazon.com didn't answer my support e-mail as well. ",1363737600,,201,4.153846153846154
5620909,5,B00BH1V94W,This film will make you and your family laugh and also encourage your souls! Perfect for the Easter holiday and family gatherings. Loved it!,1362009600,2,140,4.875
5620910,3,B00BH1V94W,"On her way home for Easter, Alza Bennet is left stranded in the middle of nowhere when her car breaks down. Desperate to get home in time for the holiday, she offers loner-farmer Lincoln James one-thousand dollars to drive her home to New Bristoll, North Carolina. They begin their three day journey across the back roads of rural United States in a restored 1952 Chevrolet truck. As they come across different hurdles on their journey the hardest is learning to reconcile their very different worlds.

Alza is afraid of not receiving her family's acceptance having been too caught up in her own world to stay connected with them. Lincoln a recluse, a ""hermit"", struggles with facing the outside world. They both have problems, and through this journey discover the answers.

Centering this film around Easter was a fun idea because, really, how many movies do you know that take place around this often overlooked holiday?

Starring Christina Karis and Jefferson Moore this is the seventh film by Kelly Filmworks. Based in Louisville, Kentucky, Kelly Filmworks produces family friendly films, such as this romantic comedy, with a Christ centered message.

5620911,5,B00BH1V94W,Fun and heartwarming movie. Actors really maintained their character roles.,1519516800,,75,6.6
5620912,3,B00BH1V94W,"Kind of dull. Actors are nice, but it just doesn't flow. Long uncomfortable pauses. Give it three stars for effort. I've only got 12 more minutes to go, so I won't turn it off.",1519344000,,176,4.205882352941177

5620914,5,B00BH1V94W,"Simply said, the movie left us feeling happy and wishing it was not over. Christina was so good we wanted to adopt her into our family and Jefferson could say more with his eyes and looks than a person can with words. Laughter until we cried. this is good for a single, a couple or a family. no sex or violence or shooting. Just great fun and joy and excellent acting.",1518652800,,368,4.197183098591549

5620921,4,B00BH1V94W,"I enjoyed this movie; I wouldn't buy it, but it was a relaxing watch for free.  Both characters were a bit over-exaggerated and perhaps a little less than believable, but the messages of community and family and humility were valid.",1509148800,,232,4.8

5620925,5,B00BH1V94W,"Loved this show. Perfect doses of everything. I will say that you should watch this with a happy mood and light heart. If you're cranky, you may have a hard time with her snarkiness, but the whole point of the show is watching her grow and learn about herself. I love the characters, and I'm soooo glad they didn't make it about race. Too often, Hollywood wants to pack everything in a movie. This was a feel-good, funny movie that wrapped itself up in a nice bow. My dad and I laughed all the way through it.",1507593600,3,509,4.257731958762887

5620927,5,B00BH1V94W,"Well done quirky movie. If your a fan of slightly off-center timing (like Napoleon Dynamite) you will probably enjoy this movie. It is not a romance (hard to tell from the cover and description) but is a solid depiction of two people learning to relate to each other and growing themselves. There is a Christian theme (not hard hitting just present) and the character motivations are not original, but the acting makes it real. Enjoyable movie.",1507075200,3,444,4.855263157894737
5620928,1,B00BH1V94W,So slow and the main female character is so whiny I could not stand her!  You could have cut 45 min out of this movie and it would maybe have been bearable...maybe.  Fast forwarded to the end to and very anti-climatic.,1506988800,,218,4.2926829268292686

It't just plain enjoyable!",1506124800,,53,4.3
5620931,2,B00BH1V94W,"Wow.  That was hard to get through.  Its okay for the first 30 minutes, but then the same story drags out for another 30 minutes of nothing happening.  I mean seriously, the same slow dragging whiney woman with untalkative man trying to get someplace.  I finished the movie almost out of some commitment to the two main actors whom I thought probably gave the script and their characters the best they could.  Hence the two stars.  Buts that's a stretch.",1505606400,,454,4.6125
5620932,5,B00BH1V94W,"Pieces of Easter--a beautiful well-portrayed story made into a movie that warms the heart, makes one laugh, makes one cry.  What more can I say.  A movie that serves its purpose.  A very feel-good movie about Easter, people, laughter, crying--all the human emotions contained in one movie.  I will definitely be ordering and watching more movies by Jefferson Moore.  Well worth the time spent watching this movie.  You will not be sorry.",1505433600,2,437,5.0

5620946,5,B00BH1V94W,"A wonderful movie with Jefferson Moore (who also directed it), full of life and life changes, wit, insight into what Easter is all about, really, not Easter eggs, bunnies, and some such, but about love and affection in a platonic way. I enjoyed the movie very much. Christina Karis was absolutely fabulous and an excellent character casting, full of spirit, enthusiasm, vibrancy and an excellent cinematic mating for ""Mr. Smith"" (Moore)  who is a man who seeks seclusion and nothing to bother him in his ""hermit"" existence until the frantic ""Alza Bennett"" (Karis) comes along to upend his world and who wants to get home to her family at Easter. I recommend this movie. Saw it on Amazon Prime Video and loved it.",1435536000,,712,4.788617886178862

I now have the movie at work and its going around my department for the ladys to take home and watch.  Very cute show!  I've alreay seen it 4 times and really woulnt have a problem watching it again!!  These two actors were awsome together in the movie.",1431648000,,385,4.0131578947368425

5620952,1,B00BH1V94W,"Do NOT order this movie!  Amazon has it for free under the title ""Backroads And Lillies"".

I found this out the hard way. I ordered Pieces of Easter after watching Backroads And Lillies because I thought it was a different movie with the same stars.  It has a different title and a different cover picture, and a slightly different description, so I figured it would just be a similar movie.  WRONG!  It's the same move with a different title.

After watching the first thirty seconds I realized it was the same movie and tried to get a refund, but since I had already ""watched"" it I was sent an automated message informing me that I was not eligible for a refund.",1428192000,2,664,4.446280991735537
5620953,5,B00BH1V94W,"All of Jefferson Moore's movies are great. They reach you in a way that is very special.
God and religion is given to you in away where you feel and understand,not where it is forced on you.
I saw The Perfect Stranger and after that I feel a total change in my life.
The actors are great,and everyone seems to relate to each other. You are drawn into the story as if you
were there and a part of it.
If you haven't seen his movies,do so! You will not be sorry. I bought every one of his movies.
I pray he continues to make more.",1425081600,3,528,3.990566037735849

In this movie she made me laugh several times.

5620960,3,B00BH1V94W,"Having seen all of the Stranger movies and TV dramas, I was interested in seeing Jefferson Moore in a different role. I have to say that I prefer him portraying Jesus as opposed to a curmudgeon who seems to hate everything and everyone.

My husband and I very much enjoyed watching this movie and highly recommend it to those of you who enjoy good family films that are free of profanity, violence and nudity. It has a great storyline, some comedy, and of course some disagreements along the way, family and otherwise. It's another Jefferson Moore/Kelly Filmworks movie added to our collection!",1398211200,,462,5.092105263157895

5620967,5,B00BH1V94W,"I love the Jefferson Moore movies and I also like how he uses the same actors/actresses that have appeared in his other movies. This story was humorous and does speak a lot to current times and how we grow accustom to our electronics and fast way of living, wanting things now, our way and such. This is portrayed in a much kinder background than is most of real life. It also shows how the commercialism of Easter and Christmas is not what is important but love, family and what God has done for us which is the reason for celebrating these holidays. Forgiveness and loving one another and helping people even perfect strangers. I also love having a film I can watch without politics displayed or foul language, nudity etc. Something clean, pleasant and that all can watch and enjoy. Kind to the heart and soul type movie and leaves you feeling good inside. Great movie and different from the Stranger Series and the Stranger movies.",1388102400,,934,4.632530120481928
5620968,4,B00BH1V94W,"I truly enjoy all of Mr. Moore's movies, especially ""The Perfect Gift"" which was totally phenomenal.  This is the least favorite of all his shows.  It was slow moving, it probably could have been wrapped up in a little over an hour.  But, the acting was superb, the storyline enjoyable, and the message was powerfully moving.  I would have liked a little more Bible reference and a faster moving script, but overall, I'd recommend it for a lazy Saturday night viewing with popcorn!",1372204800,,481,4.759036144578313
5620969,5,B00BH1V94W,"In a new direction for Kelly's, the makers of the Perfect Stranger films, the message comes as a result of one of the most entertaining cross country journeys ever filmed. In a great romantic/comedy style without any suggestion of anything improper, Christina Karis and Jefferson Moore, cross swords and half of the United States in one of the most beautiful trucks ever to star in a film. The nods to the Three Stooges and many other greats of the comedy past and the final message of family, God, faith and being a part of all these things as a part of our lives, topped with a healthy dose of chivalry and honor that takes us all to a higher level.
I love tis film and congratulate Kelly's for their excellent work.",1372032000,9,718,4.488549618320611

It is a charming whimsical comedy with more than a hint of road movie thrown in. As they journey together we begin to feel for this odd couple. This is a moving,humorous film with a serious message of forgiveness and restoration. The ultimate message of the movie is God""s love is always waiting to welcome us home and His love for us is never ending. Join Alza and Lincoln on their journey and as you travel with them,discover how God""s love is patiently waiting for you.",1365724800,,578,4.411214953271028

The writing of this movie is incredible, the acting fabulous, and the comedy outstanding. I loved every creative moment. This takes the place of my first place movie, replacing ""While you were sleeping"" with Sandra Bullock. One of those movies that makes you think the rest of the afternoon and puts a smile on your face. I will definitely be purchasing for my dvd library in the future and several for friends birthdays.  This is great movie for a ""date"" night or a group of single women getting together for a ""movie"" night.",1364428800,,637,4.587719298245614

With the difficult transitions that my family is experiencing, ""Pieces of Easter"" was just what I needed with the perfect balance between a ""fun, feel-good"" kind of movie and a strong, Godly message for my entire family that made the sacrifice of time WELL worth it! I am SO glad we made the time to watch ""Pieces of Easter!""",1364342400,4,463,4.395348837209302

8568375,5,B00BH1V94W,This was a really funny movie. Watched because of the concept and Jefferson Moore. Liked the comedic side of his acting. The young actress was very good too. Really acted well together!  They both grew and needed what they each brought into a growing friendship. So glad they made it about the love of fellow man and woman as friends. It is a movie 2 see for sure. Would like 2 own it. Grieving so was nice to be able to laugh as well as cry. Watched Jefferson Moore in The Perfect Stranger Trilogy Movies and he was super in that  and I am Blessed 2  own them.,1519516800,,561,4.175925925925926
