The professor stands in many of the places in which it is believed that Abraham, Moses or David made covenants with God.  It just helps to have the visual as he is talking about these covenants and how foundational they are to the Christian faith.  In a world where people are constantly trying to remove God from everything, it is a fantastic reminder that the places in the Bible are real and still exist today.

This would be an excellent DVD to play for a Sunday School class.  You could separate it into the Abrahamic, Mosaic and Davidic covenants and cover the material over the course of a month.  The professor presents a lot of important Biblical theology in a very condense and concise manner.  The material he covers and the geographic locations filmed within the DVD would make for lively conversation.

This is also a good DVD for any Christian to better understand how and why these covenants are important to the life and ministry of Jesus Christ.  It gives great insight into the Jewish history of the Old Testament and why it is an integral part of the Bible.  I would highly recommend this DVD to anyone interested in learning about Biblical covenants.",1364515200,4,1310,4.579399141630901
