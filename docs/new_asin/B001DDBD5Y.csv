Can't go wrong viewing or reading anything written by J.O. Frontier life and dealing with trying times and her stories reveal some tlc spilled onto others in need as well as family trials and how their faith was strong and belief enough to get through them just trusting in the Lord and letting him have their problems while they just lived and worked to improve in spite of setbacks, losses and gains. Stories showed how living right really prospered one's heart and became a way of life; to do otherwise, reaped lesser blessings.",1391731200,3,695,4.69672131147541

3528392,4,B001DDBD5Y,"I bought this series for my mother for Christmas.  She loves the entire series, all EIGHT movies.  I was disappointed in myself that I didn't double check what I was purchasing because when it arrived along with volume 1, it was only 3 movies.  I have to still order the last two movies to the series.  Make sure you get the series volumes with FOUR movies in each volume, otherwise you'll have to order the last two.  Other than that, I love the series myself and am very pleased with it.  So it my mother who cried when she opened it for Christmas.  :)",1294790400,16,554,4.269230769230769
3528393,5,B001DDBD5Y,I can not tell you how many times we have watched this complete series of movies. I have both sets vol. 1 and 2. We have bought these for friends and have received thank you cards as well as phone calls telling us how much these movies have touched their hearts. These movies tell a story you will never forget. They are beautifully made and amazing to watch. Thank you Janette Oke and Micheal Landon Jr. OUTSTANDING. When is vol 3 going to be released and what happened to the Marty and Clarks sons?,1272758400,5,500,4.329787234042553
3528394,2,B001DDBD5Y,"I've watched this series several times.  I find it soul-satisfying in an odd way because it probably in some way represents my grandparents' and their grandparents' experience.  However, I hate the fact that the producers of this series are creepy about interchanging actors, as though people are not who they are.  Even to the face in the locket of the last of the series, """"Love Takes Wings.""  So the viewer has to just feel that no one is who they are, and they are as interchangeable as if they were cardboard cutouts.  This got to me.  Clark Davis's wife becomes someone else.  Missy is at least three persons--possibly four if you count that her voice in the letter is not the Missy in Love Takes Wings.  Andrew is not Andrew in a picture in the locket.  Poor Belinda, the orphan who becomes a doctor, is three different people in the series and there is no way one can feel that any of them are the real Belinda except by details scattered throughout the DVD series.

I have never experienced so much incoherence.  It is clear to me that the producers think Bible thumpers are fairly dumb, don't know who from whom, and that the producers can get by with whatever they want to.

And I would guess they have.  Because I have watched them a few times.  But when I get a chance to replace the inauthentic cardboard-cut-out characterization by some other more respectful treatment, I am going to dump this series in the can.

Why do the people who make this series think we are so stupid they can play all these games with us?  True, maybe you can't get the same actors or actresses.  But a locket picture seems quite easy to do.  Why not get the same actor picture to put in the locket that everyone watching the series would expect?  ""Drew"" is not the real Andrew.

This feels like a vast fake series, and if the series is fake, maybe the whole basis for the series is fake.  Go with that where you may.",1257724800,4,1908,4.425287356321839
3528395,5,B001DDBD5Y,"This volume continues with strong themes of positive messages with interesting story lines. Refreshing movies compared to many box office ""hits"" today.",1246320000,4,151,5.909090909090909
3528396,5,B001DDBD5Y,I love all these movies in the series. I have the 1st two volumes. I will end up buying all the movies in this series. A great gift to buy for someone also.,1237334400,,156,3.757575757575758
3528397,2,B001DDBD5Y,"This was a new three disk series. I bought it as a gift for my mom. The 1st and 3rd disk work beautifully, but the second one halfway thru digitally stalls and will not run. We tried it on two DVD players, it is flawed and pretty much makes the series incomplete. I am sadly disappointed. But recieved it quickly and view it a fluke.",1236211200,,333,4.138461538461539
