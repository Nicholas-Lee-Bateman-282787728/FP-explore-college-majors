4706231,5,B005HWAODE,"If you like dark gritty Noir films this movie is a must see.  Great acting, wonderful directing.  Heard they did this film on a micro budget and you have to give it to the Production Companies.  For what they had the work with this film turned out to be a fast paced, quick turns, thriller that will leave you guessing until the end.",1339977600,,333,4.253968253968254
4706232,4,B005HWAODE,"This is a fast mystery which should keep you going throughout trying to figure out what is happening and who has the money. I enjoyed it very much.

It is clearly not a high budget movie, so do not expect lavish sets or super expensive stunts. What there was, was good enough.

The acting was good, two main actors Dean Cain and Christie Burson played well. I liked very much the characters.

Well worth a view

PS It confirms my view that you do not need megabucks to make good movies",1331856000,10,485,4.2967032967032965
4706233,1,B005HWAODE,"the producers must have paid off people to write positive reviews of this sloppy amateurish film. looks like it was shot with an iphone in a trashy strip mall and edited with windows movie maker. the acting is atrocious and the dialogue horrendous to say the least. the dirty trick's tight little body is the only thing worth looking at. film would have been worth it if the director knew how to shoot a sex scene and if the dirty trick actually took her clothes off. instead he bores you with amateur cheese. the cop wears a uniform that looks like it was purchased at a Spencer's gift shop. the best part is when the dirty little trick gets blown away with a shotgun to the back at the end. don't worry, it's impossible to spoil a film that's already sour to begin with. a total waste of 80 minutes of my life. honestly, I feel like I should be paid $20 for being subjected to this load of crap.",1328400000,2,897,4.2823529411764705
4706234,5,B005HWAODE,"I went to see this movie when it came out during a film festival here in Arizona.  It was very well done. At the time of the showing it was in black and white, I would love to see it again in color.  This movie kept my attention and left me wanting to see more. I would say this would be a great addition to your movie collection.

Enjoy.",1328140800,2,338,3.869565217391304

is awesome in the movie.",1327881600,3,117,4.318181818181818
4706236,5,B005HWAODE,This movie will capture you quickly and keep you guessing all the way through. Totally provocative as it twists and turns. Totally recommended for a thrilling movie night!,1327881600,,171,5.142857142857143
4706237,5,B005HWAODE,"Sarah (Christie Burson) is young, provocative, spontaneous, and unpredictable. She is every man's dream and nightmare rolled up into one. She captures our imagination from her very first scene as she is hitchhiking. She reminded me of Melanie Griffith in ""Something Wild"" only not as tame. The picture has a quirky Tarantino influence. I loved the black widow tattoo on Sarah's back. That added to much to her personality.

Sarah is not a nice person. She is all about money. The film shows us the present situation of Sarah with Michael (Dean Cain) then gives us flashbacks of her dirty little trick involving Danny (Joe Jones) who works for Vito (Michael Madsen). Characters who are introduced as seemingly minor, come back with importance and a connection. Excellent writing.

F-bomb, sex, no nudity. 4 1/2 stars",1327708800,2,815,5.029629629629629
4706238,3,B005HWAODE,"""Once you go down this road there ain't no coming back."" Michael (Cain) is driving home when he sees the beautiful Sarah (Burson) hitchhiking. He stops to pick her up and his life is thrown into chaos. I have to start by saying that this is not an amazing movie at all. It's not even technically a good movie, but it is an entertaining movie. There have been a few movies recently (Take Me Home Tonight is the main example) that have tried to have the feel of a movie set in the 80's. Most come off as trying too hard. I don't know if this movie was trying or not but it definitely had the feel of a very cheesy low budget 80's movie. The effects were bad and even the plot seemed to be a throw back. If you judge the movie based on effects and acting this is terrible. If you judge it based on entertainment and watch-ability it's not that bad. There are much worse ways to spend 90 minutes of your life. Overall, not good at all, but it is entertaining. I give it a B-.",1327622400,,971,4.0890052356020945
4706239,5,B005HWAODE,Saws this movie at a screening and this is truly an original film unlike any other I've seen recently.  It kept my attention through the entire movie.,1327276800,,150,4.555555555555555
4706240,5,B005HWAODE,I saw this at the Phoenix Film Festival. It's like a Tarenteno movie but better.  Michael Madsen is great as always but the plot is so intricate it kept me going the whole time. Recommend this bigtime.,1324512000,3,201,4.4324324324324325

8473774,3,B005HWAODE,This film was OK but if your a Michael Madsen fan like myself he wasn't in the film much so a bit dissapointed but the movie was something different Dean Cain had the Main lead in this movie,1443484800,,190,4.026315789473684

8473776,5,B005HWAODE,One of my favorite movies and it a great way to show how the desperation for money effects people.,1426377600,,98,4.2105263157894735
8473777,3,B005HWAODE,Worth a watch if your into crime dramas.  Dean Cain is a film editor driving home through the desert and picks up a young conniving hitchhiker that sucks him right into the middle of her attempt to steal mob money.  Cain has no idea of what is going on and that he is being set up by her to be a patsy.  Michael Madsen plays the crime boss - which he does so well - who is out to get his money back.  Keeps you interested.,1411516800,,422,3.872093023255814

8473779,1,B005HWAODE,"This has got to be the worst movie ever made. Predictable scenarios. Poor acting on EVERYONE'S part, and the special FX makeup was amatuer also. Bad movie all the way around.",1374019200,2,174,4.645161290322581
8473780,4,B005HWAODE,"Dirty Little Trick stars the attractive Christie Burson playing the role of a hitchhiker who dresses up and scams people (older men) out of money and sets them up to appear guilty for a crime they didn't commit, using her sophisticated charm and sex.  Sounds appealing doesn't it?  Oh yeah, it is, mainly because Christie is incredibly hot.

She's apparently capable of intelligently and connivingly screwing men (sometimes literally) out of thousands of dollars using elaborate schemes (or maybe all the pieces happen to fall into place for her quite often, who really knows).  She often dresses up in wigs and changes her appearance when she encounters *other* men as a means to go undetected (the bank or hotel room is where the setting usually takes place).  This can admittedly be quite the confusing plotline!  That's why it's important to pay as much attention to it as possible.  I love how she wins over mens trust only to end up using them later on by leaving them in the dust.  What a gal!

Dean Cain is fantastic in his role as the clueless nice guy that doesn't know what's going on whenever the cops pay him a visit with lots of questions and accusations, which is appealing.  And wow, does Dean STILL look remarkably young or what?  Great actor.  Love his performance here.  You have to have good characters to present a compelling storyline, so solid job by the writers there.

Of course this is basically a cheesy action flick but the storyline is decent and fairly original enough that I can't help but enjoy it.  Some of the violence near the end is quite bloody and graphic which is surprising.  Oh and the ending is INCREDIBLY unpredictable.  Who would have ever seen *that* coming?  It happens completely out of nowhere too.  Actually I'm referring to two different parts (the scene at the VERY end is surprising too).  A short, well-written, enticing drama with just enough suspense to keep me happy.

On a final note, perhaps I'm a tad disappointed since I felt that, by reading the description at least, the story would be about a wild ride through the desert involving a hitchhiker, but the truth is, I was only assuming the storyline would go in this direction.  I was wrong but, who cares.  Awesome movie.",1372723200,,2233,4.713178294573644
8473781,5,B005HWAODE,"Very good movie. Great mystery, great acting. I enjoyed it very much!!! Took me a minute to figure out what was going on, but once I got it I loved it",1362355200,3,150,3.870967741935484
8473782,4,B005HWAODE,This one is not quite my cup of tea but it is a good mystery.  I am just not fond of mob movies.  It will keep you guessing especially if you miss some very important clues.  It will keep you guessing as to who done it.  There is a lot of language and violence so if you're squeamish you may want to pass this one up.  All in all it's a good mystery.,1362096000,2,350,3.73972602739726
