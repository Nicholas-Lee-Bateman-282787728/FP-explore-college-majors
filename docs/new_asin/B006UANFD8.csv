8504436,1,B006UANFD8,If you want to be bored out of your mind and don't mind wasting your time then watch this movie. It was almost torturous to sit through this. Long lapses of anything happening.  (just to add to the length of  the movie I suspect),1426723200,,229,4.181818181818182
8504437,1,B006UANFD8,"This movie contains poor acting, slow material and frankly did not make any sense.  I would not recommend it for anyone.",1403049600,,120,4.714285714285714
8504438,4,B006UANFD8,"There is rarely a film about the difficulties of older people.  This one hits the nail on the head with it's portrayal of an elderly couple struggling with an stagnant and unloving marriage.  The question is, do they stay together or end the relationship?  Ending means starting over which is hard at any age, but particularly cumbersome in the senior years.  In this poignant film, Julie the wife, decides to end her commitment to her husband.  Now her choice to make is how to end it.  Her decision will shock you!
Very interesting film.",1377561600,,539,4.680851063829787
8504439,2,B006UANFD8,"The acting in this movie is often very good, but the story is poorly executed (as is the overly loud and usually discordant music).

It's true that couples can drift far apart emotionally yet stay together for a long time, but there's no indication here of why this couple ever felt attracted to each other in the first place. There's also not enough suggestion of why the wife does the horrible thing she does to her husband -- one brief scene with a priest that seems to delve into horrors from her own past isn't enough (and it's not even clear that that's what the scene is about).

This movie strives for an artistic, art-house feeling, but it fails to convey a genuine sense of the lives of these characters. Seemingly significant events happen that never get picked up on again. The actors deserve better than the several forms of clumsiness surrounding them.",1354406400,,866,4.65359477124183
