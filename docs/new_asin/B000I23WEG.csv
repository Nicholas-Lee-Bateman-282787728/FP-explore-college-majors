8143163,5,B000I23WEG,"This Best Dance DVD is the ""best"" yet.  Not only do you learn the steps so you can get out on the dance floor but it's great exercise as well.  I've seen other instructional video's and none were as clear and easy as this one. Marcia and AL go slowly so that you can understand the steps and the timing.  Then they put it all together with the music so you'll know how fabulous your going to look when you go out dancing.  If your truly interested in learning how to dance this is a must have!",1157760000,9,493,4.051546391752577
