8042980,5,B0006SSQ7K,"This is one of the most artistic, new age, styles of ballet I've ever seen.  If you only like traditional, classic choreography, this is NOT for you.  If you like modern takes on old classics, highly unique dancing, and really fun costumes? Give this a try.  The story is supposed to be a little girl playing with her dolls, acting out the story of Cinderella, so you'll see a lot of those ""doll house"" features through the stage and props. All the dancers wear doll masks throughout and yet still are able to portray a surprising about of emotion.",1489276800,,548,4.515151515151516
8042981,5,B0006SSQ7K,"I'll join the 5 star group, something I rarely do. But this performance is creatively unique. While the doll-faces are stationary, every micro-movement of head, shoulders, and hands conveys the intended meaning and feeling. I could not keep my eyes off the screen. And the music is by Prokofiev--what's not five-star about THAT?",1480464000,,328,5.2075471698113205
8042982,2,B0006SSQ7K,"I barely saw any actual ballet in this ballet.  Spooky dancers walking around with big baby heads and making baby noises.  Think of chucky from the horror flicks dancing.  I admit I'm not a huge fan of modern ballets,  but this is just too weird to be called ballet at all.",1370131200,,273,4.294117647058823
8042983,5,B0006SSQ7K,"Lyon has provided a home for dancers with an appetite, and the French call us disgustingly overweight which unfortunately is a mea culpa. The prince looks like a naive dullard. The fairy godwhatever looks like a fugitive from George Lucas with the appearance of a sword carrying Christmas tree. The music is glorious and the performance is hilarious. When the princes reps come with the glass slipper and evil stepmother hides cinder chick by sitting on her, the sight of step mummy rising in the air to reveal cindergal is priceless. It seemed to drag occasionally and that may be due to the fixed doll expressions but overall it is a delightful, memorable experience",1332460800,2,668,4.868421052631579
8042984,5,B0006SSQ7K,"Quirky yes but this take on a classic brings me many memories, i love the interpretation, this is a must have!",1160265600,4,110,4.285714285714286
8042985,5,B0006SSQ7K,"Marin and the Lyon National Opera Ballet have brought unique insight, humor,  and to Prokofiev's musical joy, Cinderella.  They have breathed new life into the tale, now seen through the eyes of a young girl as the dance of her dolls in their dollhouse. BLee correctly states that the faces of the dancers are hidden beneath their dolls' masks; some perform as wooden dolls -- others as dolls of cloth and china.  But far from detracting from the individuality of the dancers, Marin has provided each ""doll"" with distinctive movements and steps  enhancing and expressing that character's individuality.  It is comparable in insight and creative power to Kylian's L'Enfant et les Sortileges.

I have bought and watched this disc on HDTV with a 5.1 channel audio system.  The image is clear and sharp (though only 4:3), and the colors vibrant despite the 1989 recording date. Its sound quality is rich despite the limitations of dolby 2.0.  By contrast, the Shilling/Berlin Comic DVD of Cinderella is a disaster -- with washed out images and sound.  Though well danced and choreographed, it lacks Marin's originality and genius.",1114300800,20,1126,5.043243243243243
8042986,2,B0006SSQ7K,"This is very dull. Often, personification makes things so much more interesting. Here the process is reverse and so is the effect. It is most unnatural, not being able to see the dancers faces or expressions. And even their movements and actions mimic those of wooden dolls. Photograhy is poor too. Just terrible! The music is quite alright though.",1113091200,6,348,4.915254237288136
