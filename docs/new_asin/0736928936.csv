2865,5,0736928936,"I was so excited to see this new Bible Study from Lysa TerKeurst. I LOVED Made to Crave and was thrilled to see not only a new book by Lysa, but also an Interactive Workbook and a 6 part DVD series called ""What Happens When Women Say Yes to God""!

I received the the DVD series and the workbook in the mail to review from Harvest House Publishers.

This is a wonderful series speaking exactly to where women are today. We do need to be willing to say Yes to God!

One of my favorite phrases from this study is, ""When the Messiah touches our mess, it becomes our message to the world.""

We all have a story, a mess that God has or can touch and He wants us to say YES, to allow Him to use those things in our lives for His glory.

Such a powerful word from Lysa!

The description of the workbook says, ""Excellent for individuals or groups, this workbook companion to the DVD helps women discover and delight in God's joy and purpose for their lives."" It does that through personal questions, activities and discussions. There are a few lessons in the workbook to go with each session which allows you to dig deeper into what Lysa taught during the week's DVD session.

I am excited to use this material in my women's Sunday School class and give them the opportunity to go through this study again with me!",1306108800,9,1305,4.302040816326531

2875,4,0736928936,"A group of ladies from church are having this Women's Bible study in our home. The facilitators purchased the study guide, and DVD set, and book for each of them. The rest of the ladies just are either using the book or ebook version for the study.  This is a group of 8-11 women who are using it as a summer study and reading a few chapters each week, watching the video, and then discussion from the study guide has helped the group to grow closer to God and each other.
  The DVD has been pretty good, but the audio quality is sometimes lacking.  I would recommend this for those who want to say Yes to God.",1341532800,4,610,4.188034188034188
