8607538,1,B00EON8T6Q,"Save your money. This dvd set of two discs is one of the worst I've ever seen. Incredibly low budget, very low production. People walk in front of the camera. Lighting was horrible. The topics were poorly written and horribly executed. I do not recommend this unless you basically want to see people gathered together in a small room talking about what they think about ufos. Very bad. Very boring.",1417478400,2,398,4.7
