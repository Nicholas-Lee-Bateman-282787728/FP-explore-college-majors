7424666,5,B014TYHK32,"This is one of the best stories ever lived and the DVD was done very well.  When it comes to missionary life and trials, this man's life excels!  The DVD did justice to Hudson's life!  I recommend it highly!",1351900800,,207,4.256410256410256
7424667,4,B014TYHK32,"I enjoyed the Hudson Taylor story and admired his self-sacrifice for God's work.  This is an old movie and the production was not the greatest, but well worth the watch.",1350604800,6,169,4.633333333333334
7424668,4,B014TYHK32,"I received this free with the purchase of the DVD, so can't complain--but why only allow it to be viewed on computer or Kindle?  We can use a Kindle app on an android phone to read Kindle materials, but can't view Kindle videos on the android.  There is no logic for this, other than that Amazon is pushing us to buy the Kindle (which I would certainly do if it had the full functionality of my android phone).

The movie itself I enjoyed.  Not Hollywood, but good insights, and gets the point across well.",1345593600,,506,4.351063829787234
7424669,3,B014TYHK32,"This film of Hudson Taylor's life was made by some Christian film making company, not Hollywood.  So, while being true to Christian faith, it's film making, and acting chops were quite mediocre.  The content is very good.  The presentation of the content is mediocre.  Just depends what's important to you.",1317427200,3,306,5.06
7424670,5,B014TYHK32,"The Hudson Taylor movie was extremely well done. It was very accurate to Hudsons life & not hollywood tainted as so often happens. It was very inspiring to anyone interested in the Lord's work to get at it and not let ANYONE OR THING get in the way or discourage you, but to follow the mind of the Lord if the Lord is leading you as he did Hudson. Ken Anderson did a great job keeping it real & factual.",1300579200,28,403,4.05
7424671,5,B014TYHK32,"This wonderful documentary of Hudson Taylor's ministry to inland China is done in a way taht reveals the authenticity of the times in which he lived.  It does not show the modern life but rather shows things as they were.  What is significant is the spirituality of Hudson and his wife, who also went to China as a missionary and met Hudson there. Being a missionary as such requires much dependency on God far beyond what many Christians are even aware of, so this is a wonderful way to see grace manifest.  The more we trust in God, the more God can use us in His mission for the salvation of mankind.  This is why Jesus says you cannot serve two masters, God and money in Matthew 6. If we do not trust in God for finances, we will be loyal to the system where we can get money.  That is Satan's primary scheme to lure us away from God, and then he enslaves us to his system.  From this DVD you will see how God provides where there is nothing but His provision to sustain his people and provide the salvation message to others.  Whether you are a missionary in American to all you meet or to inland China or another foreign country, you should trust as the Hudson's and the Muller's did, as this is putting God and His Kingdom first.  Matthew 6:33 But seek (aim at and strive after) first of all His kingdom and His righteousness (His way of doing and being right), and then all these things taken together will be given you besides.",1299801600,17,1436,4.312267657992565
7424672,3,B014TYHK32,"I had seen this movie on TV once before.  A scene where Hudson Taylor and his wife were sitting at a table in China without food or money stayed in my mind.  A desire to purchase this DVD stayed with me and I purchased it from Amazon.  It is an older movie without all the bells and whistles of newer movies.  The movie takes you from Hudson's arrival in China,the challenges he faces while there, and his love for the people of China.  One quote from the movie and the scene described above is, ""God's will, done God's way, will never lack God's provision.""  It is amazing to see even through very difficult times, Hudson Taylor trusts God and God is faithful to Hudson Taylor.  It will challenge you in your walk with God and your faith in Him.",1282521600,30,746,4.323741007194244
7424673,5,B014TYHK32,"Beautiful and tender story of Faith growing in the Lord's Disciples into China and other places. Touching and honest accounts of faith being tested, pruned, and polished for the Glory of God and the good of others.
The Gospel of the Risen Lord Jesus Christ is flowing throughout the movie and life story of Hudson Taylor and his wife Maria, their little girl  and others.  Enjoy and share with others to be encouraged and uplifted by this ""missionary life adventure"" through obedience and love for God. There are still many Nations and millions of people to reach with the love of God and salvation through Jesus Christ..  This movie is a good one to share with church schools, etc.",1479945600,3,682,4.714285714285714

7424675,4,B014TYHK32,The film quality is old but the account of Hudson Taylor's life is inspiring and humbling.  I was glad to learn more about this great man of God.,1467849600,2,145,4.178571428571429

7424678,3,B014TYHK32,Interesting movie on Hudson Taylor's mission to the Chinese. Production and acting leave something to be desired however the story was enlightening as to the great sacrifice he made for the salvation of the Chinese people.,1458518400,,222,5.194444444444445
7424679,4,B014TYHK32,"The faith we claim, but seldom live is displayed here. Physical infirmity, emotional pain and heartache never prevented
this gentle soul from serving our Heavenly Father faithfully. It is worth it to view this true story of a family's devotion to our Creator.",1456617600,3,259,5.046511627906977

7424688,5,B014TYHK32,"How many times was Hudson Taylor's heart deeply broken, and yet he remained true to the mission and call of God on his life.  There is a cost of commitment.  This portrayal of his life reveals the depth of his commitment, regardless of the cost.  Five Stars for the powerful message.  One star removed because of the quality of the film, but added back in because the producers did an excellent job with a very low budget.",1407196800,,422,4.441558441558442

7424690,4,B014TYHK32,"Hudson Taylor's life was inspiring. He just humbly lived his life where he felt called, stood by his principles, and trusted God to provide all he needed. The film certainly isn't modern day quality, but the content was inspirational.",1401321600,3,234,5.0256410256410255
7424691,4,B014TYHK32,I did like it anyway. I knew the story but not some of the details. It was interesting and scenes were nice.,1394841600,,108,3.9545454545454546
7424692,5,B014TYHK32,"I watched this with my kids, whom have already been exposed to William Carey as their first missionary story.  As with others, I agree that the quality of the film isn't ""Hollywood"".  The movie does give the sense of rushing  from one event of his life to others with hopes of either not dwelling on particulars or trying to stick to what the producers felt was most important.

On a positive note, I felt that they still did a decent job in revealing the life of Hudson Taylor and keeping the story line alive.  To say the least,  my kids, grades 2, 5, and 7 were actively involved and equally critical, came away with the central message and purpose of the movie, which was my initial goal.  Since my goal was accomplished, then for me, it has all stars.

A remake would be great!",1393286400,4,782,4.381944444444445
7424693,3,B014TYHK32,Earnest movie that shows the pioneering struggles of Hudson Taylor both in his Chinese mission and personal life. It is helpful for one who is called to missions especially regarding counting the cost. Gets the job done but does not draw the viewer in. Could be the subject of a remake.,1391385600,,286,4.627450980392157
7424694,3,B014TYHK32,"This film may be reasonably accurate history but the mediocre to poor production took away from the story.  As portrayed in this movie, Hudson Taylor's personality seemed rather discouraged through most of the movie.  I wonder if this was true in real life?  If you are going to buy this movie, don't get your hopes up too high.",1391040000,,328,4.620689655172414
7424695,5,B014TYHK32,"Lots of biographies generally make their subject into a super hero with no weaknesses, one who conquered kingdoms, was always faithful, never wavering, rarely tempted or discouraged, rarely troubled, and did it better than any of us know we could have... Thankfully the producers of this film drew out the weaknesses and struggles of Hudson Taylor better than any other works I'd seen before, and presented a real, weak man who put his hope in a great God, and saw God provide in great ways despite Hudson's own weakness. Great to watch with the kids too as there is ZERO questionable content or romance in any of it!",1390867200,2,617,4.722222222222222
7424696,3,B014TYHK32,"I expected more from this one. It was okay, but I was hoping for much, much more. You might like it better than I did.",1388707200,,118,3.76
7424697,5,B014TYHK32,"I gave it a 5 for the quality of the message that the movie delivered, even though it was a low budget making. It  was though provoking and focused on a trueness instead of entertainment.",1388275200,2,187,4.3428571428571425
7424698,3,B014TYHK32,"Good story much more material in Hudson's life. An armature effort but  I,'m grateful for the attempt. It would be wonderful to have a good series on the lives of missionaries.",1386115200,3,176,4.67741935483871
7424699,5,B014TYHK32,Gives the many struggles he went through in his walk with JESUS!  Brings the man of GOD alive with all his imperfections in full view!,1385769600,,134,4.36
7424700,2,B014TYHK32,"I thought the story about Hudson Taylor itself was great but the quality of the film & filming was disappointing. The film seemed to be blurred as well as the sound wasn't as clear as it could be, to my husband & myself. Maybe I received a inferior copy of the film.",1379030400,2,266,4.134615384615385
7424701,5,B014TYHK32,"Hudson Taylor's life story is SO inspirational...one of those movies a person could watch over and over again, and one that you have to tell everyone about!!",1370649600,,157,4.851851851851852
7424702,5,B014TYHK32,"This documentary gives glory to Christ and a great man of faith.  This is highly recommended to all Christians.  The documentary presents Hudson Tyler with his great faith in God and also his struggles, such as his battle with his temper.",1369094400,2,238,4.780487804878049
7424703,3,B014TYHK32,"My 5th graders read a biography of Hudson Taylor and used the DVD as part of our culminating projects.  The movie does not have the best graphics or sound, but it gives you a taste of what life was like for those with China Inland Mission.  Good video if used for the purpose of instruction rather than entertainment.  We will watch again.",1367452800,6,339,4.435483870967742

7424705,3,B014TYHK32,Living in China (for more than five years) has given me an interest in early missionaries. This movie portrayed Taylor as a weak  guy who whined more than he prayed. . .but accomplished far beyond his greatest imagination at a great personal cost. The Chinese was accurate but it might have been better with a little more emphasis on the positive things that happened rather than the troubles that followed his every move.,1365724800,2,422,4.780821917808219
7424706,5,B014TYHK32,Hudson Taylor was another of the amazing missionaries of all time.  This movie told his story well.  I would highly recommend it to those interested in m missions.,1364947200,,163,4.785714285714286
7424707,4,B014TYHK32,"This movie is not strong in production values, but it tells the story of a great hero of Christianity, a story that needs to be heard. I liked it a lot, but Hudson Taylor is one of my heroes, and it reminded me of the sacrifices people have made throughout history for the cause of preaching the Gospel. It was humbling and challenging to me, but I know people will scoff at it not being a top-notch production. Pay attention to the story.",1364601600,7,439,4.301204819277109
7424708,5,B014TYHK32,"A humble movie for a humble servant of the Lord Jesus.  I really enjoyed the Chinese people and authentic setting. I think it would be difficult to achieve that authenticity in a more modern movie. I've was inspired by China Inland Mission when I was a girl of 15.  It was quite influential on my choices when I was young.  I was also reminded that I had been impressed that unlike many European and American missionaries, Taylor didn't try to Westernize the people he served.  Now I am 52 and was again inspired by Hudson Taylor's story.  I watched this movie on a whim as I looked through the documentaries for something to relieve boredom. The actors weren't Hollywood Stars, but they were sincere.  They did a good job of finding an actor that resembles Hudson Taylor. This movie reminded me that we don't only serve God for only what he can give us. The story challenged me not to be discouraged and to continue to be faithful when life is difficult and painful.  We are here for a purpose and that purpose is to serve God by serving others.  I imagine others like myself may think of men and women like Hudson Taylor and his wife Maria Dyer must have been stronger than we are because they could do so much for God, but they struggled as much as anyone else.  The story was a reminder that being a faithful Christian doesn't mean nothing bad ever happens to you, but Hudson Taylor and Maria Dyer Taylor were determined to be faithful no matter what, and many people were blessed because of that faithfulness.  Life is difficult.  Everyone has something.  Wouldn't it be better to be like Hudson and Maria Taylor if we must be here anyway?  Without purpose, the joys of life aren't frequent enough and the pain is too difficult to bear.  The story was more important than stunning cinematography and Oscar winning performances. It is rather ironic that many great men and women have struggled so much with their own faith.  I actually don't think the man would have appreciated a Cicil B. DeMille version of his life even though his life actually affected a vastly greater number of people and the success of his endeavors were far more reaching than this humble movie depicted.",1361145600,6,2183,4.59020618556701
7424709,4,B014TYHK32,Interesting show but the film quality was fair. Worth watching at least once. A story about the missionary Hudson Taylor.,1360454400,,121,5.1
7424710,5,B014TYHK32,"This movie has a modest beginning with a cast that is as equally as modest.  While the cinematography could be better and the plot can take a little bit to develop, the themes of the movie are strong and portay God in a strong and benevolent way.",1358812800,,246,4.23404255319149
7424711,4,B014TYHK32,"We enjoyed this DVD very much. very glad we purchased it, and will be lending it to friends.

7424712,2,B014TYHK32,I found the acting to be painfully unreal and the events not to be thorough.  I would have preferred to have a good audio-book about Hudson Taylor if they can't get actors who are believable.,1353456000,4,191,4.457142857142857
8731822,5,B014TYHK32,Inspirational and encouraging at the same time as telling the true story of a Christian missionary devoted to seeking God's will and spreading the Gospel to the Chinese. I hope it is on DVD.,1510012800,,190,4.617647058823529
