8273065,5,B00199Z96G,"I have seen this vide and I have seen Al Gore's video.  I will say the same thing that I did about ""An Inconvenient Truth.""  If you use both films as a guide to do your own digging, then both are wonderful works.  That said, neither can be taken at face value.  There was a court case in Britain which ruled that 34 of the 35 major claims of Al Gores video were either false or impossible to prove scientifically.  Similarly, an Australian case rejected Moncktons notions that several key IPCC reports were intentionally falsified.  Anyway, take it with a grain of salt and use it to go look things up for yourself, then both videos will have served their purpose.",1256860800,6,664,4.446280991735537

This dvd will have a very difficult time swaying any critical thinking.  Lord Monckton presents a conspiratorial view that data is intentionally cooked to make the problem look worse than it is, but two of his lines of evidence show the disingenuous nature of this claim.  First, he harps on about four data points having their decimal places moved by one space in a table about sea level rise.  He claims that the IPCC multiplied the true numbers by ten to intentionally increase the apparent risk from melting of the ice sheet.  But if that was the intention, why did they not adjust their total sea level rise as well?  I think it is far more likely that this was just an accidental misprint in the final draft, though Mockton is incapable of giving any benefit of the doubt, it must be the most insidious answer.  After all that furthers his own agenda.
Another example of his deliberately misleading his listeners is his displaying of what he claims are the two temperature graphs of the last thousand years from the IPCC reports in 1991 and 2001.  The first one shows a very prominent Medieval Warm Period and Little Ice Age and the second one shows a much more muted MWP and LIA.  He claims that this is evidence of a grand conspiracy to eliminate the MWP from the records so to make the modern warming look exceptional.  But what the original graph from 1991 has on it is a very clear label of the record as a European temperature curve, and the 2001 record is the global record.  The MWP was barely prevelant in North America and Asia, so when you input those records in with European records in a compilation of data, naturally, the signal gets muted.  Because he knew that if he put a European temperature graph against a global temperature graph, his viewers would notice he is comparing apples and oranges, he DELIBERATELY erased the Europe label from the first graph.  This is the example of the misleading info within this documentary.  He never addresses any of the science of climate change, he merely tries to push this paranoid conspiratorial view on susceptible viewers.  I expect it will only work on the people who already believe that view anyway.
By the way, the nobel prize he claims he has, he got that because when he spotted the accidental decimal place referenced earlier, he wrote a half page paragraph addressing it, submitted the the IPCC, which published it, realizing its error.  That officially made Lord Monckton a contributor to the IPCC report, so when they gave the Nobel to the IPCC, he was one of 17,000 recipients.  But don't let that stop him from trying to convince you his Nobel prize makes him smarter than the other Nbel prize winning IPCC scientists.",1240617600,7,2869,4.627218934911243
8273067,5,B00199Z96G,"Lord Monkton does a great job here, and he is clear that he is not letting either side off the hook. His presentation is thorough and passionate. I think of particular interest is his expression of human feelings for people dying of disease due to absurd decisions made by governments under pressure from special interest groups. However he is not a scientist, as Al Gore is not. Still, this is the man who took Al Gore's Inconvenient Truth to court in the UK and got a court order to notify UK schools of 9 serious errors. On his web site he lists some 38 errors, and they are unambiguously one sided. He has challenged Al Gore to a debate and Al Gore is not accepting because he knows Monkton would wipe the floor with him.

My one disappointment is universal with all such DVDs and books I've seen to date. That is that nobody is actually challenging the physics of the greenhouse effect as a German physisist recently did, offering formulas for warming as a result of atmospheric pressure and then demonstrating the calculations work for Venus. Go read the description of the greenhouse effect on Wikipedia and see if it doesn't stink. They take an observed difference in temperature per unit of alititude and work their way back from a theoretical point in space... in denial of convection and other physics. Even if one did accept the greenhouse effect Monkton uses the IPCC numbers and formulas to prove it is still no effect. In fact the entire alarmist positioin is quite absurd and exposed as such here.

The Great Global Warming Swindle has some great extras, but this is a title you can give to your brainwashed friends more easily. I recommend both.",1214092800,24,1662,4.649659863945578
