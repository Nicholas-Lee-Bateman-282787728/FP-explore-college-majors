8753253,5,B01CJCQDNY,"Sweet, touching, endearing - you name it, this film shows it. As a child I asked my dad if animals loved each other; he thought they ""probably"" felt ""something."" Every year I buy the calendars of the animals ""Unlikely Friendships"" after buying the original book. I can promise you, not only do animals Feel ""Something,"" they bond and they love and it's INTERspecies! Every time I read the stories, see the photos, I wonder what's the matter with us that we cannot get along among and with our OWN species. We are supposed to be the one's self-conscious and at the top of such awareness, but hard to believe given the way we treat one another.",1481673600,4,642,4.543103448275862

8753255,5,B01CJCQDNY,"Love these animals!!! I wish more people understood that 4-legged animals & 2-legged animals are mammals, and share qualities in common, even though those on 4 legs do not have verbal speech. However, many manage to speak with their eyes and facial expressions.",1470873600,5,261,5.093023255813954
