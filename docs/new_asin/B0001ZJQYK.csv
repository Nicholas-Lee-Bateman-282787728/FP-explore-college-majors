I am a fitness instructor and I found this video to be very professional, safe, and a great workout!  I loved how it incorporated exercises with my baby!  To the gals who made this... thanks for finally making a video that lets me workout and bond with my baby at the same time!!!",1080864000,2,361,4.279411764705882
2050453,5,B0001ZJQYK,"I needed a workout that wouldn't take a lot of motivation to do. I have found that, post baby, if I have to psych myself up to do a workout (even a treadmill), I don't do it. This DVD starts out with on the floor stretches that let you mentally warm up. The workout covers all of the major muscle groups, and when you are done you feel good. There's nothing fancy, just the basic moves that we all know and love. My 25 pound 14 month old makes the lifting exercises quite challenging, I am happy to do 5 or 10 reps right now and I will move up from there. I like that they devote a few minutes to kegels since we all just love those. I never did them before, but since they stuck them in the middle of the workout, it is a good time to sit and play with my little one. I like that the music is just background type so that you choose the pace and number of reps you want to do. You don't have to follow the instructors exactly. I like that one of the ladies talks some during the workout, because sometimes I get caught up in doing a move and forget to play with my baby. They do use a stepper at one point, but I just walk around the room looking at pictures with my daughter during that. The bonus at the end is the Hawaiian song they sing while showing babies playing. Even if my daughter skips out on the workout portion, she always comes around to watch this part in my lap. I got this DVD about 2 weeks ago, and I do it 3 times a week right now, and that is plenty. I will work up my reps and hope to do it everyday at some point.",1142208000,9,1536,3.9105431309904155
2050454,5,B0001ZJQYK,"After reading the reviews, I decided to order it. I wasn't looking for something vigorous, just something to involve my 2 year old toddler while getting a decent workout.

It was really fun, my son had a blast. Of course, it took him a few minutes ""get"" it but eventually he started playing along. The workout itself is fairly easy if you do it without the baby, but if you do it WITH.. its a pretty good session. I used my 2 year old (33lbs) on as many as I could and I worked up a damn good sweat. The only thing that is annoying is that one of the girls talks over the whole time about this and that... but I just tuned her out.

If you can get over the cheesy quality of the video and don't take this as a real serious, get down and dirty workout, then I think you'll be really pleased with this.",1139616000,14,800,4.0251572327044025
2050455,2,B0001ZJQYK,"its tough when you watch and work out to a video that has people leading that shouldn't be on film, this was a one time viewing that i cannot watch or try again",1129248000,4,160,3.878787878787879
2050456,5,B0001ZJQYK,I love this tape. My 6 month old and I laugh and laugh and I feel like I've had a good workout.,1128384000,4,95,3.3636363636363638
2050457,5,B0001ZJQYK,"You know how videos can be...I am usually a pessimist, but gave a try on this one after reading the reviews. I am SO glad I got this workout! My son is 6 months old now, and I was a bit overweight from my pregnancy, y'know..so after 3 months of working through this about every 2-3 days, I am now at my pre-pregnancy weight and have WAY BETTER muscle tone. When I started, I was not motivated, but I was inspired somehow I guess by the soothing music and perfect pace. I am sooo glad I got this, I just wanted to share my thoughts! Thank you!!!",1127952000,18,544,4.093457943925234
2050458,4,B0001ZJQYK,"I initally was not crazy about this video- the production quality is lacking and the pace seemed a little slow for my taste.  But, I decided to give it a try and I am SO glad I did.  I absolutely love this tape.  I do this workout every morning with my 8 month old and he truly enjoys the activity time with his mother.  It took several tries to master engaging him in each activity, but now, we go through it like old pros.  I can see drastcally improved muscle tone and I have experienced significant weight loss. I would highly recommend this video to anyone who wants to get a fantastic workout while bnding with your baby!",1120089600,34,627,4.279661016949152
2050459,5,B0001ZJQYK,"This video is perfect. It's well shot, and has a serene background.  The instructors explain all of the movements and why they are beneficial, and the developmental cues for me to use with my baby are only found in this DVD.  The two instructors individually demonstrate a different level of each exercise, one advanced, and one beginner. I have owned three other post-natal workout videos, and this one is by far the most comprehensive assortment of fitness, development and fun for my baby and me.  Thank you so much for making this DVD!",1088035200,24,539,4.774193548387097
2050460,1,B0001ZJQYK,"I really had high hopes for this -- it looked cute, and the idea is good.  But it really turned out to be a disappointment.  The exercises are not nearly challenging enough, they're not instructed well, and the video is quite short.
There are other similar products out there that I use -- and are much better.",1087257600,12,310,4.421052631578948
2050461,5,B0001ZJQYK,"I recently had a baby boy, and felt a ""little"" out of shape after having him(HA!)I did a search on amazon and found this video. I got it in 3 days, and began right away. My son works out with me every day, and I couldn't be happier! We both have fun doing the exercises which work my whole body, and I use him for the weights! I am also learning about my baby's development from the video. It's educational and rewarding. Thanks MBBB.",1085529600,17,434,4.178571428571429
8019333,5,B0001ZJQYK,"This is a great workout! It is not so intense that you are horribly sore the next day, but good enough to make you feel like you got a good workout. I bought this after my baby was over 6 months old, so when she didn't want to do the workout with me I used weights. When she does want to do it with me, we have a blast! I love this and will continue to use this for quite some time. I also like that it wasn't done in a studio and you actually see how nature affects filming.",1296345600,,475,3.76
8019334,2,B0001ZJQYK,"Based on other reviews, I was expecting a lot better product.  I wasn't concerned about the corny music and scenery if the exercises were good, but they did not meet my expectations, either.",1277424000,,190,4.757575757575758
8019335,4,B0001ZJQYK,I enjoyed this dvd workout.  The baby was involved through the majority of the workout unlike other dvds that I have purchased. The instructors target different problem areas.  It was pretty good.,1266710400,,196,5.09375
8019336,1,B0001ZJQYK,"I was really looking forward to this video and hoping it would help me shed some of the baby weight. I bought it too late. I felt that this video was meant for moms with young infants...ones that were not moving around and just want to be held. By the time I bought this, my son wanted to move around. I also felt that the movie was a bit old and not very current.",1238371200,3,364,3.9324324324324325
8019337,5,B0001ZJQYK,"I recieved this dvd the other day and did it with my 3 month old daughter right away, and we both loved it! I got to work out and play with her at the same time! Also, while you are doing some of the exercises, you are still engaging interaction with the baby, and at the same time they can either practice tummy time or sitting up. I've already reccomended it to my sister in law who has a 6 month old!",1232582400,,403,3.926829268292683
8019338,4,B0001ZJQYK,"I realy like this DVD. I was super lazy and did nothing throughout my pregnancy so i found the excersise to be challenging but not impossible. I read a review that said that this DVD was gritty and looked like it was taped on camcorder. I disagree. The backround is calming and senic and besides, it's an excersise tape not Star-Wars, geeze. The only problem I had with MBBB was that i'm a total clutz and needed more time inbetween excersise to get into position. I just paused and got into position and restarted. I also think a person should stretch a little more than they have at the end.
My baby realy enjoys this DVD for the most part but we do stop half way for a little break. She also hates tummy time so will get pretty fussy during that part of the DVD but I just keep on because it's good for her and is just enough time so that I don't feel bad about leaving her in that position.",1210550400,2,894,4.173410404624278
8019339,3,B0001ZJQYK,"The quality of the picture is not good in my DVD player. Plus my son is two years old. He can not be still when I am trying to working on the Yoga with him. But this vedio might be good for mothers with younger child, for example 3 or 4 months old child would be the best suit.",1209340800,,277,3.711864406779661
8019340,4,B0001ZJQYK,I like this video and so does my baby.  It is fun to watch him smile and laugh while I work out.  Working out is not chore time it is play time!,1187740800,,144,3.46875
8019341,1,B0001ZJQYK,"Updated 2008 Review (Hope this new detailed review will be more helpful):  I bought this DVD to help get back in shape post-pregnancy.  Out of the many post-pregnancy exercise videos & DVDs that I purchased, this one was the least useful and least enjoyable.  The DVD has a very cheaply & quickly produced feel to it.  I did sit through this DVD once and attempted to follow the exercises.  I have to admit that I questioned the safety of some of the baby/mother exercises.  As I mentioned I have several baby/mother DVD exercise videos and this was the only one that I felt the exercises might pose some safety risk to my baby.  Personally I feel there are much better DVDs available for post-pregnancy exercise so I have to rate this DVD as a total waste of my money.",1184457600,4,769,4.489208633093525
8019342,3,B0001ZJQYK,"The exercises in this video are good, and the instructors clearly enjoy working out with their babies. However, the production quality is very low (like it was filmed using a low quality VHS video camera), and worst of all I can't play this DVD on my computer (unlike every other DVD I own). Since my computer is in the room where I work out and I don't have a TV/DVD player in that room, and there isn't room to work out in the living room where we have our DVD player, this is a big disappointment for me. Don't buy this DVD if you plan to watch it on your computer.",1143849600,6,568,4.126126126126126
