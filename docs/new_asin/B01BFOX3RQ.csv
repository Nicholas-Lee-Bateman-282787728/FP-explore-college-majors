8750032,5,B01BFOX3RQ,"Thanks for posting the episode lists/back covers for Volumes 3 & 4I just got Vol 3 (also bought Vols. 1 & 2 individually a while back), not sure why 4 and even 5 are so overpriced?? Hoping they take Vol. 4, 5, and 6 when it comes out and put all three in a box set like 1, 2, and 3 at a good price!!

I grew up with the 80s Chipmunks series and later saw The Alvin Show in rerunslove them all of course, but this Chipmunks series is the BEST!!!! Cant say it enough!! Hope other long-times fans are enjoying it just as much!

(Also, I reported to Amazon months ago that some DVDs are listed as Chimpmunks, but nothing was ever done about italso not sure why it looks like Eleanor is making a face on the Amazon cover??)",1504828800,,718,4.049295774647887
8750033,5,B01BFOX3RQ,Love these episodes and was thrilled to find them available on DVD since they were quickly removed from iTunes. Hopefully additional seasons will become available in the future. I'm attaching an image that provides the back of the DVD case to help others see what episodes are included since there wasn't one included (at least at the time I purchased). Hope that helps.,1504051200,,370,4.888888888888889
