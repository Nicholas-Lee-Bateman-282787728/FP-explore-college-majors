2500940,4,B000E6ESJ4,"It's obvious from this film that Gene Wilder learned his lessons well from Mel Brooks.  Yes, he employs alot of Brooks' stock company and Mel even has a voice cameo.  Wilder, however, imparts his own style on the proceedings.  This is a raucous parody that, for the most part, is consistently funny.  The visual gags, verbal puns, and slapstick are top-notch.  Wilder is in good form and the Brooks' vets (the late, great, Madeline Kahn and Marty Feldman, Dom Deluise) contribute hilarious support.  As a bonus Brits Leo McKern and Roy Kinnear(""Help!) add to the fun.  Though the film doesn't approach classic Brooks(truth be told Brooks peaked at ""Young Frankenstein"") it should not detract from the fun.  Look close for Nicholas Smith(""Are You Being Served?"") and Albert Finney in an unbilled cameo.",1144972800,,801,5.015151515151516
2500941,5,B000E6ESJ4,"I love this silly movie, hilarious, Madeline Kahn, Dom Deluise, Marty Feldman, and of course Gene Wilder.

2500942,5,B000E6ESJ4,"Finally!  Finally!  Finally!  Practially unavailable for years on VHS, I'm so happy this in now on DVD to laugh at forever.  I worked in a movie theater in high school in the 70s and we showed this first run for four weeks and were howling with laughter the whole time.  It is an under-appreciated gem.  The ""opera"" at the end is a hoot, but what always KILLED us was the exchange between Dom DeLuise and Leo McKern:

McKern lifts a huge vase over Dom's head about to bash him with it, and Dom turns just in time to see him do it.  McKern looks at the vase and says

McKern: ""You've got a LOVELY vase!""

Dom (HEAVY italian accent while grabbing McKern's face): ""And-a YOU'VE got-a lovely vase!""

Oh too funny  LOL",1144368000,,713,4.318181818181818
2500943,4,B000E6ESJ4,"No, it's not the funniest movie in Wilder's career, nor certainly in the late, great Madeleine Kahn's, but they obviously had a wonderful time making this film and I have a soft spot for the cuddly, silly, sexy chemistry between them. It's definitely worth a look and worth  the modest price, and the takeoff of ""Uno Ballo in Maschera"" is, well, priceless.",1142899200,3,356,4.741935483870968
2500944,5,B000E6ESJ4,"This was one of my favorite movies as a child.  The scenes with Dom DeLuise are hysterical and Madeline Kahn and Marty Feldman are great as always.  The Hop, Hop, Kangaroo Hop song always brings a smile to my face.  Being a big fan of Blazing Saddles, Young Frankenstin, and Silent Movie, I always thought this was a Mel Brooks film.  It had the same crazy humor and eccentric characters as those films, so I was surprised to find out that Gene Wilder directed this.  Highly recommended along with ""The World's Greatest Lover"" also directed by Wilder.",1142640000,5,551,4.639175257731959
2500945,1,B000E6ESJ4,"One of the lamest comedies of all time, with nary a chuckle to be found. Virtually ended Gene Wilder's career as a star; after this, he was dumped in increasingly unfunny comedies with Richard Pryor. Just a dreadful, dreadful piece of dreck.",1142467200,6,241,4.761904761904762
2500946,5,B000E6ESJ4,"While some have ridiculed this Sherlock Holmes' parody, I love it and rejoice at its long-awaited DVD release. Made in 1975, funny man Gene wilder wrote, directed and starred in the film, which also boasts the incomparable talents of the late and truly lamented Madeline Kahn and Marty Feldman. It also stars Dom DeLuise and Leo (Rumpole of the Bailey) McKern.

Wilder, a well-schooled actor in parodies having starred earlier in his career with Kahn and Feldman in Mel Brooks' classic and beloved ""Young Frankenstein,"" turned is considerable skills to create this loving send-up of the world's most famous sleuth. Wilder was well-equipped to do so as he is a life-long Conan Doyle fan and bonafide member of the Baker Street Irregulars, a famous real-life Sherlockian scholarly society whose members include Christopher Morley. (In this film, Brooks has a cameo role, but he is heard and not seen.)

In this Victorian era film, Wilder portrays Sigerson Holmes, the ""smarter"" but very jealous younger brother of the brilliant Consulting Detective, whom he derisively refers to as ""Sheer-luck."" (In the Conan Doyle canon, ""Sigerson"" was an alias Sherlock Holmes used during his ""missing years"" after his falsely believed death-plunge at the Richenback Falls at the hands of his evil nemesis, Professor James Moriarty; while Mycroft Holmes was actually Sherlock's smarter brother.)

In the Adventures of Sherlock Holmes' Smarter Brother, Sigerson begins an investigation, at the request of Sherlock, into the disappearance of a vital cache of government documents. Sherlock and Dr. John Watson leave England to travel to the Continent on another assignment, apparently confounded by the missing document mystery.

Kahn, who in her life was a classically trained singer, was given the opportunity to showcase her impressive vocal talents as Jenny Hill/Bessie Underwood/Opera singer, a compulsive liar and Sigerson's love interest. The film is well worth watching if for nothing else than a zany drawing room musical scene when Sigerson and Jenny first meet, which culminates in the truly unforgettable, ""Kangaroo Hop.""

Feldman is Sigerson's Watson, Sgt. Orville Sacker of Scotland Yard who possesses ""photographic hearing,"" and who, along with Jenny, help Sigerson recover the documents and thwart Moriarty (with some invaluable behind-the-scenes assistance from Sherlock Holmes!)

McKern is wonderfully evil as the new Moriarty, while DeLuise is a bumbling blackmailer.

This film is fun, wacky, sweet and very off-beat. Kudos to Wilder for choosing to enlist his old partners Kahn and Feldman, providing yet another permanent chapter in their unforgettable and immortal careers!",1137974400,90,2678,5.469733656174334

2501149,5,B000E6ESJ4,"I originally saw this little comic gem in an old well-kept Art Deco neighborhood theater in Wilmington, Illinois in the summer of 1976.  It was one of those dollar shows several months after the film's release in the bigger cities.  It seemed like a good (and cheap) choice since Gene Wilder had been so good in ""Blazing Saddles"" and ""Young Frankenstein"" in years past.  Wow!  I can safely say I got so much more than my money's worth!

I won't repeat the plot points and scene descriptions since others have covered that.  But I just want to enthusiastically recommend the silliness in this movie.  I bought it on VHS tape and again on DVD, and I'm debating purchasing the blu-Ray disc, just to get the best-looking version.

2501153,3,B000E6ESJ4,"It's impossible not to wish that Gene Wilder and Mel Brooks had continued to work together after Blazing Saddles and Young Frankenstein or to recognize that both would have benefitted immensely from a continued collaboration.  Silent Movie and High Anxiety would have been improved with Gene Wilder in the lead--Mel Brooks can't act to save his life and can't play anything resembling an actual character.  As a performer, he is 100% schtick while Gene Wilder is a genuine actor and leading man.  On the other hand, Mel Brooks was not above using as many writers as necessary to make the funniest film possible, while Gene Wilder as a solo writer/director seemed to greatly overestimate his talents as a writer/director.

The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes' Smarter Brother offers a small handful of good, goofy laughs, but, on the whole, any Mel Brooks movie, even the pretty mediocre ones, are a lot funnier.  Gene Wilder is also an actor who needs to be restrained a bit to be effective.  Giving himself free reign here he gives a performance that is frequently shrill and overly broad.

Still, this is a decent enough comedy viewed entirely on its own merits.  The story involves Sherlock Holmes' younger brother Sigerson who is an average detective at best and is frustrated about living in his older brother's illustrious shadow.  And since they have the same initials, when Sigerson does manage to accomplish something (in one of the films better throwaway gags) the paper names S Holmes and everyone simply assumes it must be Sherlock.

Sigerson is enlisted by his older brother to investigate the theft of a document of national security importance by Professor Moriarty (an amusing Leo McKern).  Sigerson Holmes blunders his way through the case, not because he is an idiot, exactly, but because he is determined to copy his older brother's famous methods rather than be his own man.  Meanwhile, the more famous Holmes faked an exit from town and his helping his younger brother from the sidelines without Sigerson realizing it.

It's a promising enough idea, but Gene Wilder never humanizes the insecure, younger Holmes sibling or manages to make him particularly likable, which is a miscalculation because actually rooting for Sigerson would make this whole concoction go down much easier.  There also simply aren't a lot of inspired comic moments, although there are a few--including a dance number that breaks out for no particular reason and a carriage top fight that suggests Sigerson does have some makings of a hero after all.

The wildly insecure Sigerson gaining some confidence and becoming a better detective during the course of the film would have been a nice dramatic arc, but Wilder's character remains nearly the same shrill creation from beginning to end, leaving little reason to sit through this except for the slightly too infrequent laughs.  The lesson Wilder apparently did not learn from Mel Brooks was that if you are going to make a movie this broad you better have the laughs to back it up.  Wilder doesn't, and he neglects to take a more subdued, character-based approach that would have benefitted his acting talents and script.

Gene Wilder's solo efforts as a writer/director (which also include The World's Greatest Lover, The Woman in Red and Haunted Honeymoon) are all but forgotten today and don't hold up particularly well.  The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes' Smarter Brother is maybe the best of the bunch, which is unfortunate, but there are worst comedies you could be wasting your time watching.  I was a Gene Wilder fan in the 1970's but at this point, that seems an unbelievably long time ago.  On the other hand, if you are still a Gene Wilder fan you can easily add one more star to this review.  As for myself, I kind of wish this movie had remained a fond childhood memory and that I had never rewatched it.",1465603200,,3862,4.918335901386749
2501154,2,B000E6ESJ4,"Given the way the preview looked and the fact that Gene Wilder was in it I was expecting hilarity.  What this film actually delivers is a few moments of dry rapier wit and a whole lot of blegh.  Non wonder this film is not very well known it is overall very mediocre.  Not horrible just not very good.

Madeline Khan and Marty Feldman add to the misadventures and general mayhem.  Feldman, playing Sgt. Orville Stanley Sacker, uses his unique appearance to great advantage.

Wilder, playing Sigerson Holmes, Sherlock's younger brother, hates living in his brothers widely cast shadow.  Sherlock, off on another task, has Sigerson attempt to solve a crime locally.

Yep. There's a lot of sex in the movie. Part of the joke, in fact, as there is really no sex in the Doyle books.

Also, a huge number of the jokes are very specific references to the Holmes stories. If you've read the books you may not find the jokes as funny as I did, but you will understand them. I saw this movie as a young teen, and because I laughed like a crazy person at the parts I *did* get, I was motivated to read *all* of Doyle's Holmes stories, and then re-see the movie.

2501440,4,B000E6ESJ4,"My own personal history with this film is a bit unusual.  While in the Navy in the late '70's, the ship I was stationed aboard made a homeport change halfway around the world, taking about two months.  They had a limited number of movies and TV episodes to play on the closed-circuit system, and this was one of them, so we got to know it pretty well and I became a fan during that time.  I would often catch myself reciting bits of dialogue, like ""Good night, boys!  Don't have bad dreams!"" or ""You've got a lovely vase!"" ""And you've got a lovely face!""

It's been criticized for not having the most coherent plot in the world, but it's never bothered me.  It's supposed to be silly and farcical, and Wilder's love for the source material shines through.  The obvious comparison to contemporaneous film comedies is to those of Mel Brooks, especially since it stars many of his regular players, and it holds up as good as most of Brooks'.

Given its age before coming out on DVD, I knew there wouldn't be much in the way of bonus features, but I have to say--with all due respect to Mr. Wilder--that there wasn't a whole lot to his commentary track.  He does bring out some interesting details, such as the real fencing expert inside Sigerson's mechanical opponent and the uncredited cameo of Albert Finney.  But there are long stretches where he has nothing to say.  Obviously it's been a long time and he's not getting any younger, so he can be forgiven.  It's too bad most of the principals (Marty Feldman, Madeline Kahn, Leo McKern) were gone by the time this was put together (2006); I would have loved to hear their own takes.

Even during those earliest viewings over 30 years ago, I found some lines of dialogue tricky to make out, especially ones sung during the opera scene in the last half hour.  Anyone who encounters the same problem, don't hesitate to turn on the captions.

2501442,5,B000E6ESJ4,"This is one of Gene Wilder's best films in my opinion.  Along with some of his
favorite actor friends (Marty Feldman and Madeline Kahn), Wilder plays
Sherlock Holmes' younger (and, he insists in a severe case of sibling rivalry,
SMARTER) brother.  Madeline Kahn plays the ""damsel in distress"" who is
referred by Sherlock to the younger brother, for unclear reasons (and of
course, with Sherlock Holmes, nothing ever is clear to anyone but himself).
Marty Feldman plays Wilder's assistant, a peculiar counterpart to
Sherlock's Dr. Watson.

This movie is a comedy and has some great singing as well (I am generally
NOT A FAN of musicals but I have to face it--some great singing although
not too often).  Furthermore it has a scene that, when I first saw it, I laughed
so hard that tears were running down both my cheeks, I couldn't catch my
breath, couldn't stop laughing and my diaphragm hurt, that's how funny it
was.  And it wasn't sexual nor was it gross.  It's rare to find movies with that
degree of funny (now or then).  If you liked ANYTHING that Gene Wilder and

The plot spins around a stolen document that ays to be retrieved for the sake of the Queen (Victoria) and the Empire.  Sherlock ostensibly turns down the case and refers it through Feldman to his self-styled ""smarter"" brother.  Needless to say, the game is afoot.

On one hand, it is in the so-bad-it's-good category with some of the over-the-top scenes and acting, but on the other hand, in large sections of the movie, the acting is spot-on, and the comedy is genuinely funny. This movie certainly doesn't compare to Wilder's performances in Willy Wonka, or Young Frankenstein, or even as the ""Waco Kid"" in Blazing Saddles. But as a period piece set tongue-in-cheek in the Sherlock Holmes universe, and co-starring Madeline Kahn (whom you may also remember from Blazing Saddles), we found the movie to be entertaining and interesting. Comedy tends to be hit or miss, and some of the sections of the movie were certainly misses, but we got enough laughs out of this to recommend it to fans of Gene Wilder, and fans of comedies in general.

I felt that the film was one part funny, one part silly, and one part totally irrelevant and unnecessary, actions that should have been removed from the film, action that was neither funny or silly, I wondered why they were in the film.",1288051200,2,564,4.53921568627451

2501541,5,B000E6ESJ4,"I first saw this upon its initial release back in 1975, and although I was much younger, I still enjoyed the humor. To clear up any confusion: This is not a Mel Brooks comedy, but a spoof of the great detective written & directed by Brooks' close friend & associate, Gene Wilder. It's easy to believe how this film might be perceived as a Brooks spoof, as Wilder (as star) is re-united with his ""Young Frankenstein"" co-stars Madeline Kahn & Marty Feldman here (although Brooks makes a funny ""cameo"" voiceover). Looking at the picture now, the humor is clearly not for everyone; there are moments where the viewer(s) might scratch their heads at bits like the evil Prof. Moriarty (the late character actor Leo McKern) shouting ""Yes yes!"" But Wilder's such a sly satirist that even the most slightest bits can get a chuckle out of you, such as: Sherlock Holmes communicating with cue cards to Dr. Watson that there's a huge, ugly murderer peering through the keyhole; the running gag with Sigerson Holmes' assistant Sacker (Feldman) as a human tape recorder; Wilder's trademark hysterics, particularly when dealing with both Kahn & Feldman; the silly operetta conducted by Moriarty's accomplice (wonderfully played to the hilt by Dom DeLuise); Sigerson Holmes (Wilder) predicting the entrance of pretty Kahn, and instead, getting the male dwellings keeper; a great slapstick brawl atop moving carriages; and the climactic sword fight between Sigerson & Moriarty. The most outrageous moment has to be when, after narrowly escaping a death trap, Sigerson & Sacker attend a formal dance with the backs of their tuxedoes sheared away, exposing their bottoms to everyone.
The look of the production is deeply embedded in the late nineteenth century period, filled with sumptuous stylized sets & costumes. The detail is impeccable.
To be sure, this is not Wilder's funniest work. However, it's an extremely likable spoof that benefits greatly for having the late great Kahn & Feldman there to help things along.",1259539200,,2003,5.072727272727272

perfect by any means, the pacing gets a bit bogged down in the middle.

Although Mel Brooks expertly directed Young Frankenstein, Sherlock Holmes' Smarter Brother was Gene Wilder's first attempt at directing. After this turkey he's fortunate he was given another chance.

Can't call it uneven - this miss is slow, boring, predictable, and unfunny from start to finish.

Don't bother - what a waste of talent.",1235865600,5,546,5.112359550561798
2501567,3,B000E6ESJ4,"As a child, I thought this 70s Sherlock Holmes' parody, was brilliant. Sadly, now, decades later, I see and realize the tarnished elements to the film.

Gene Wilder, fresh from his brilliant performance in Young Frankenstein does do a fine job in the role of a bitter and pompous younger brother to the more known Holmes. However, outside of one case mentioned (that of the Three Testicles, a throw-away line), we have no idea how good of a 'consulting detective he is.' There are moments he is bumbling and then moments where he is clever. And this odd variation is endemic to the entire plot.

We have the wonderful and talented Madeline Kahn as the love interest and mystery lady. Unfortunately, her character never makes any sense - all her scenes are meant to elicit laughs but there is no depth behind her character. Why would someone who is a governess be working as a dance hall singer and an opera singer and be romancing the head of the household? It's a shame as she can only do so much with the material presented. And despite their friendship, the two lack romantic chemistry.

Then, there's Marty Feldman, who is never given enough to do. It's a shame as he's quite a good physical actor. And Dom DeLuise hams up every scene, often for a touch too long.

Fortunately, Leo McKern provides the silver screen with one more memorable Moriarity's filmed. A shocking claim? Not at all. McKern's character, at times whimsical, other times pathologically vicious, steals every scene. You can see that he is a man motivated by his (hilarious) curse to commit a heinous act every 24 minutes. He's not a bumbler (except at math) and his lines are the best written in the movie.

The plot wanders a bit. But generally this is a decent comedy of its era. Not on par with the best of Mel Brooks, or with the other Holmes spoof, Without a Clue, but worth a laugh.

However, what is not worthwhile at all are the extras. The film's original trailer is dull (a monotone voice narrating). And the most disappointing aspect of the entire DVD is Wilder's commentary.

I hate to read into his own narration, but there was the sense that Wilder had grown tired and distant from his early work. There is barely any effort to reference scenes, characters, to give the audience a real sense of what happened in the making of this movie. There are long pauses when he remains quiet, as if he's seeing the film for the first time again. There are moments where he states the obvious. I became so frustrated because I wanted to know why he did scenes this way and that, to hear the clever details. One would never know that Wilder is a comedy legend by the painful way he (barely) relates his commentary.",1227052800,11,2690,4.568464730290456

2501610,5,B000E6ESJ4,"On the surface this is a silly Sherlock Holmes parody, courtesy of Gene Wilder and Co. And as a parody it works OK, though at times (several times) it is almost too silly.

However, there are several bonuses here:

1) Wilder is wonderful. Playing a character (Sigerson) who is wildly intelligent and talented. His character would be an absolute standout in any field he might choose to pursue - except his chosen field - following in the footsteps of his brother - Mr. Sherlock Holmes. As such we see this intelligent, talented fellow as a miserable failure who is just smart enough to realize by the end of the show the genius, competence and love of his brother.

2) The Sherlock Holmes of this movie is superb. Here, Sherlock, has a small and mostly behind the scenes role. But the Holmes we see is THE BEST HOLMES ever brought to film. He is simply superb.

3) The ending scene where Sigerson approaches a costumed Holmes and through eye contact conveys his understanding and acceptance of their relationship and acknowledges their relative skills and talents - this is a well done scene. It is worth watching a whole movie for a scene like this.

4) Lots of nice hat tipping to Holmesian lore.

5) The zany Moriarty. Leo McKern does a nice performance here.

6) As do all the ""friends"" of Wilder (Feldman, Kahn, De Luis, etc).

Without a collaborator on the screenplay and taking the directorial reins himself, as well as the starring role, there's far more unfettered self-indulgence here than wit. There's thankfully a little less pointless hysteria from Wilder than usual, although this is sadly more than compensated for by excessive yelping from Leo McKern and tedious showboating from Dom De Luise (now there's a surprise). Indeed, this may well be the only film in which chronic overactor Aubrey Morris gives the most restrained performance. There's also an excess of messy eating and childish humor to contend with, not to mention the unforgivable waste of Marty Feldman's unique talents in a dull sidekick role. There is one funny sequence in a ballroom and a couple of moments where the ideas are good enough to survive the sledgehammer execution, but when Albert Finney, in a one-shot cameo in the film's Night at the Operatic finale, turns to the camera to ask ""Is this rotten or is it all terribly brave?"", it's not difficult to come up with an answer.

Aside from the theatrical trailer and trailers for three other Wilder films (Young Frankenstein, The World's Greatest Lover and Silver Streak) the only extra is an audio commentary by Wilder that is so sparing and uninformative that you'll wonder if you clicked the wrong button on your menu!",1172016000,5,1821,5.04983388704319
2501638,5,B000E6ESJ4,"This movie is a classic written in the same vein as the other Mel Brooks / Gene Wilder movies such as ""The Young Frankenstein"", ""Blazing Saddles"" and all of the other fine movies of Mel Brooks. Although not a Mel Brooks production, lovers of Mel Brooks will be very pleased. Marty Feldman and Madeleine Kahn also star in this production and are hilarious!

Watch this one - you'll be pleasantly surprised.",1168300800,2,405,4.704225352112676

2501640,5,B000E6ESJ4,"The comedy team of Gene Wilder and Marty Feldmen was one of the funniest I'd ever seen.  It's sad that they were only together in two movies that I know of: Young Frankenstein and The Adventure of Sherlock Holmes' Smarter Brother.  The first time I saw this was on the 'big' screen in 1976, I believe.  While I love Gene Wilder's maniacal intensity, it's always Marty Feldman's performance that steals the show.  The dialogue between the two while they are in Siegerson's apartment at different times is great.  And I laughed so hard at the ballroom dancing scene (after they had survived the saw room) I thought I was gonna pass out.

Feldman's performance as the police detective with a 'photographic sense of hearing' is also right on.  He can crack me up with just a quizzical look at the camera.

And who can forget the dance 'The Kangaroo Hop'?

Of the three main stars of this film; Gene Wilder, Madeline Kahn and Marty Feldmen, only Wilder is still alive.  That's sad--Kahn and Feldman were a delight in this movie.

This is a great movie.  I'm tickled to death to finally have it on DVD--no more wore out VHS tapes for me.",1162684800,2,1131,4.544554455445544
2501641,4,B000E6ESJ4,"There's nothing worse than a Reviewer too wrapped up in his own cleverness...

I love this movie, but it's not perfect by any means.  This was GW's first writer/director attempt and it lacks a little structure...maybe some things ended up on the cutting room floor?

The movie has many non sequiters, yet reading the paperback book which accompanied the movie (written by Wilder's nephew) every action has a full explanation - e.g. Why Lord Redcliffe throws away the scroll in that way, why he checks the dirt on Orville's hat and shoe.  Bad editing indeed.

The movie was not a success in way Young Frankenstein was - I think people expected a rip roaring Brooks style comedy and they didn't get it.  It got panned over here in England - not because we thought that he was - to quote Mr Wilder - ""some snot nosed American trying to tell British people what to laugh at"" but because the movie wasn't as funny as perhaps we all expected.

That said, Gene Wilder fans will NOT be disappointed by this one. Gene looks fab!",1149897600,,1019,4.53551912568306
2501642,4,B000E6ESJ4,"Like ""Young Frankenstein"", ""The Adventure of Sherlock Holmes' Smarter Brother"" is a knowing and affectionate spoof. It does not set out to destroy its target, but to show appreciation for it.  Wilder, a member of the Baker Street Irregulars, shows his knowledge of Holmsian lore by including many references and quotations from a number of the stories, though mostly from ""The Naval Treaty.""  Wilder, Kahn and Feldman are once again a wonderful, cohesive trio, Dom DeLuis is a riot as a bizarre and untalented opera singer, and Leo McKern shows both utter strangeness and menace in his role as Moriarty.  The film has moments of total manic humor, such as spontaneous singing (""The Kangaroo Hop""); Wilder and guest villain Roy Kinnear having a coach-top battle with a giant shoe and glove taken from businesses they pass; and a hilarious spoof of the opera, ""The Masked Ball"" with very funny English ""translation"" from the Italian.  McKern and Wilders' final duel in a spooky prop room is genuinely exciting and nicely choreographed and the film perfectly captures the look and sounds of 1890s England, with a nice John Morris music score evoking Korngold, as Wilder wanted him to do.

Everyone clearly had a good time making this film and it shows in the enthusiasm for the material. The film is not out-and-out funny all the way through, but it wasn't designed to be.

At the end, for example, there is a genuinely poignant scene where Sigi has Sacker leave the sought-after Redcliff document in the prop room, clearly realizing that his famous older brother has been watching out for him and will retrieve the document himself. The elder Holmes later plays some violin music to bring Sigi and Jenny back together, and Wilder's look tells us he realizes the old fiddle player is really his older, despised brother.

Wilder's commentary at times is insightful, at other times, he doesn't have much to say. I wanted more behind-the-scenes anecdotes from the production; in the final duel between Holmes and Moriarty, I wanted to know how they created the very effective forced-perspective shot of the wharves below the opera house, making it appear as if the fighters were many floors above the river.

I have great affection for this movie, as both a Sherlock Holmes fan and someone who appreciates Gene Wilder's talent. This is a lost gem, finally available to enjoy again. If you can watch Roy Kinnear hail a taxi with a four-foot-long glove on his hand without laughing, there is no hope for you! And don't forget to drink some sexy wine while you enjoy this film.",1145232000,22,2568,4.873853211009174

8106659,3,B000E6ESJ4,"I bought this in 2013 and have been waiting for a BD version but after reading the reviews of the KL Blu Ray disc I will stick with the DVD.  The disc I have is a double sided, single layer disc but it has never given me any problems.  One one side is the Full Screen version and the other has the Widescreen version.  Picture quality is very good on both and the sound quality, either original mono or fake stereo is very good as well.  My only complaint is the subtitles.  My disc has Eng, Fra, Spa on both sides BUT only for the dialog.  When the songs are being sung there is no subtitles other than ""song"".  This annoys me as I bought the DVD just so I could see the lyrics during the singing.  Having the Lyrics makes it easy to catch a word or phrase that you miss in the sound track.
The Movie itself is pretty good especially if you like Wilder, Khan and Feldman.  Plot is silly and many of the scenes are like those in Young Frankenstein done to be funny but still stay withing the plot line.",1506988800,,1002,4.097435897435897
