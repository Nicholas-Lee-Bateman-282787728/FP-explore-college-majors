3555434,5,B001EL6EAO,"After saving the world from Nagi's insane destruction plot, the Windbloom kingdom and Garderobe Academy are back to normal. A disaster strikes, and Mai & Mashiro are transported to an island with no way off. The rest of the Otome are trying to find them. Arika cannot use her powers since Mashiro is gone. There is also a terrorist group that is trying to free Nagi and resurrect an ancient Otome. There is plenty of action and drama to see in this OVA. The good thing about this is that since it's a short OVA, the production quality is much higher than the series. But My Otome is still not as good as My Hime.",1356393600,4,612,4.3304347826086955
3555435,5,B001EL6EAO,"Everything went swift and smoothly. I received the items only a few days after placing the order and in pristine condition. I only have one to say: ""Thumbs Up!"" .

For those who wonder what happened to the Archduke or how the unification of the several countries went... one item to buy. ^^",1323302400,,290,4.471698113207547
3555436,3,B001EL6EAO,"I like this series and this one is no different.
 The only thing I ran into was that this disk would not load right or play on my Philips DVD player. This may be due to the player but I suggest that one checks your player brand name first. I have two copies of this DVD and neither one of them would load or play. I've had this problem with one or two other titles. I don't believe it's the DVD as they all play on a Magnavox DVD recorder and JWin player I have.  Watch out for this though.
  As for the contend......Great!",1273017600,3,523,4.0
3555437,4,B001EL6EAO,"I enjoyed this Anime collection very much. You can find other reviews that will tell you all you could want to know about the story and content. So in summation it was amusing and enjoyable.
Buy it used. One story that ties togather a few loose ends from the two series, My Z-Hime and My Hime, is not worth full price in my opinion.",1253577600,2,332,4.203125
3555438,5,B001EL6EAO,"Needless to say, If you liked the TV series, you're gonna love this one.  The main advantage of watching anime movies and OVAs is that as opposed to a full size TV series, the animators have substantially less episodes and scenes to spend their budget on, and as a result, you will not see any of the recycled or simplified animation sequences you see  in anime sometimes.
What this means to you, is that when you watch My-Otome Zwei (Being an OVA), you will enjoy an all-new story, featuring the characters you already know and love (not to mention the same wonderful sountrack from My-Otome/My Hime), plus the added bonus of a markedly more fluid, lively animation, and much more solid, more dynamic battle sequences; all of this ultimately makes the characters and the story feel even more captivating and full of life than before, and thus it makes the experience much more enjoyable.
  In short, you'll have everything you already like and more.",1228176000,12,950,4.774390243902439
3555439,4,B001EL6EAO,"I was very frustrated that there wasn't even an editorial review for this product but I decided to take a chance. I was very satisfied. If you are a fan of the My-Z-Hime series, this is great. The same characters in 4 episodes a year after the Windbloom City battle a new mysterious enemy appears. That's all the story I'll give you but these episodes provide some good closure and ""what happened to the characters after"" to the original series. I only gave it 4 stars because they went on the cheap with the artwork for some of the minor characters, all the suviving Schwartz (pardon the spelling, I didn't check it)that still have a crystal to call a ""child"" have plain black face masks with yellow eyes.",1226188800,3,706,4.5234375

8298594,5,B001EL6EAO,"My-Otome Zwei completes the Otome series. It allows the audience to reconnect with Nina, whom I personally liked, and allows us to see more use of the Blue Sky Sapphire's true form. Zwei follows the manga more than the original series did, with the introduction of childs and the all too familiar Kagutsuchi. If you've got My-Otome in your collection, Zwei is a good addition.",1373328000,2,376,4.8

but was VERY happy with this edition!",1359417600,,144,4.178571428571429
8298596,4,B001EL6EAO,The product was a special edition. The box should have been of better stock. It was cheap cardboard. For the price I couldn't beat it. Any fan of anime would have to have this item.,1358380800,,181,4.2
