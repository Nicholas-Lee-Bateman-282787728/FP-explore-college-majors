8138774,5,B000HDR89G,Awesome sci-fi epic the acting is good and the soundtrack is good as well.,1431388800,,74,4.357142857142857
8138775,4,B000HDR89G,"I did not see this movie with overly high expectations.
My demands for a movie are fairly rigid. Whatever happens must be within the bounds of the world that is portrayed. As long as this consistency is maintained I am willing to suspend disbelief to what occurs.
It is well made, well written, the acting is good (but why do these movies ALWAYS need a comic relief character?).
I was actually impressed with how well the story was told, how the contrivances of the story were incorporated and made perfect sense within the the boundaries of the story. The characters and dialogue were believable for the story.
Zeiram is not the first but the second movie in this story.
The first is the anime Iria.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Iria-Zeiram-the-Animation-Complete-Series-Limited-Edition-Collector-s-Tin/dp/B00018WEP0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Iria: Zeiram the Animation - Complete Series (Limited Edition Collector's Tin)</a>

8138776,5,B000HDR89G,"It's a simple and well done sci-fi monster movie, like the Godzilla sequels only better. The plot revolves around 2 delivery men who play the dumb sidekicks, a girl bounty hunter from space and a near un-killable monster who seems to die but keeps coming back. It mixes sci-fi and martial arts a bit with a great monster and a plausible story. The monster has to be isolated in an alternate dimension that looks like the original city but without people where it can be defeated. The story goes from there as the trio try to capture or defeat the monster. Very much like the Godzilla sequels but much better than almost all of them. Deserving of cult status. There is a Zeiram 2 that's almost as good.",1381536000,2,701,4.484375
8138777,4,B000HDR89G,Nice reissue of the Zeiram movie with Japanese track and English subs for those who don't care for dubs.  Nice compliment to Zeiram II and the animated version IRIA,1192233600,2,164,4.655172413793103
8138778,5,B000HDR89G,Those reviews are about the Fox Lorber release which is dubbed. This is not that DVD. This is the Tokyoshock release with it's original language and subtitles.,1163203200,8,159,4.925925925925926
