8400043,4,B003M3A868,"NAPOLEON DYNAMITE / REVENGE OF THE NERDS is an odd coupling of two teen films from two different generations. 'Nerds' is set in college, 'Napoleon' in high school.

The earlier work is a feel-good story that celebrates the triumph of the weak and unpopular over the jocks. In 'Nerds,' geeky or just plain weird college kids create their own fraternity, but the bullies still won't leave them alone. Their revenge is in winning a wacky Olympics competition to determine what frats and sororities will wield power next semester. Sophomoric, with plenty of naked girls to tttiltate the Clearasil crowd. Goodman, as evil Coach Harris, is literally 100 lbs. lighter here.

Everything about Preston, Idaho's Napoleon Dynamite is odd. From the top of his red frizzy hairstyle to the soles of his moon boots, this youngster epitomizes individuality. Nappy's hobby is 'puter hacking, which he works on when not busy feeding Grandma's llama. Yes, Mr. D. is from a family of eccentrics. His much older brother hits on ladies in chatrooms, Uncle Rico the door-to-door salesman dreams of the days he was a high school gridiron star, and Granny tools around the sands in a hot little dune buggy.

At school, Napoleon is determined to help his buddy Pedro win the class presidency, which won't be easy as they're going up against an egotistical yet very popular girl named Summer. Pedro, Napoleon and their few friends are the opposite of Summer. They're considered by classmates to be uncool and geeky, so it looks like Pedro's not winning anything. Napoleon, though, has something up his sleeve...
