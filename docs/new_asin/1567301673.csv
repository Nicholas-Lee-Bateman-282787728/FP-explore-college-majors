I loved it really much.

I loved Francois Simon acting, the story, the creativity, the society's autopsy.

A rather ""different"" film, that obviously had not a very large budget, but is nonetheless in my 10 preferred films of all times.
(but I haven't seen it in the last 20 years, so I might change my mind next time I see it... - perhaps put it in my 5 preferreed films of all times ? - )

I really consider writing to Alain Tanner to ask him why this film is not released as a dvd... so that He could collect my letter and Yours to lobby the producers... (His address can be found on the net. He lives in Geneva.)

I ordered this film, but it never came... looks like it is not available anymore...",1133654400,,776,4.052287581699346
