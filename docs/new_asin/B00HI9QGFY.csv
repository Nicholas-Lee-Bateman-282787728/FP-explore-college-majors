8633018,5,B00HI9QGFY,"Drawing with Mark is a great program; people of any age can learn to draw with programs like this one.  First, you take a field trip and are shown great stuff.  And secondly, you get to draw the things you see and learn about.  Isn't that convenient?",1464048000,,250,4.276595744680851
8633019,5,B00HI9QGFY,My Grandson and I enjoyed drawing along with this DVD.  My Grandson felt a sense of accomplishment because Mark makes it easy while he's entertaining.,1393545600,,150,5.0
8633020,1,B00HI9QGFY,"Though it may not seem like it, I did not set out to slam Drawing with Mark. As the father of a young child who loves art, I hoped it would be something she would enjoy. However, we both ended up disappointed, me more than her, as her boredom drove her away, while I dutifully watched on. Nothing about this release is really worth recommending, though Marderosian has a cute style of drawing. Hopefully there are better options than this out there for kids who want to learn to draw.",1393459200,,484,4.388888888888889
