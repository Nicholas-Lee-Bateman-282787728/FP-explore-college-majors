6133046,1,B00H5NY7O0,"LOVE the movie BABE.  Cute, family friendly... sweet movie.  Babe2 is horrible!  NOT family friendly, not kid oriented.  half dressed women, drunken ppl, voilence, inuendos of a poodle being loose.  What a disappointment!!  Buy BABE... but buy it as a single movie.

6133260,4,B00H5NY7O0,"I enjoyed the first movie as much because I've a serious interest in livestock dogs. I've seen films of a few people actually teaching a pig to herd sheep. They succeeded well. It does raise the issue as to why bother training pigs when the dogs are much faster in the process of moving livestock and safer, truly. Unlike the pigs, the dogs can and WILL keep the sheep safer than a pig is likely to achieve..
I disliked the 2nd movie without qualification.",1439424000,2,456,4.440476190476191
6133261,4,B00H5NY7O0,"I ordered this because ""Babe"" is my daughter's favorite movie and we needed a back up for when she goes to her grandma's house. I will break my review down to a few categories:

Convenience- I looked everywhere locally for a second copy of this movie before turning to Amazon. I found it right away and got ""Babe"" and ""Babe Pig in the City"", which was great.

Value- This copy with the sequel was just $1 more than just buying the original, so I figured we'd just get both.

Product Satisfaction- I gave the 2-pack a 4 rating. ""Babe"" gets a 5 and ""Babe Pig In the City"" 2.5, so I rounded up to a 4.  The first movie is far better than the second, in my opinion. With the farm setting, fun plot and  characters, I think it is enjoyable to watch multiple times, for kids or adults. The second move is not such a happy tale and I didn't find it as enjoyable as the original (and neither did my daughter).

Overall, this is still a good value if you think you may like having the set, as it isn't much more to get both. My baby loves the ""pig movie"" so it was okay for her and I do not regret this purchase.",1438128000,6,1103,4.083333333333333

6133291,5,B00H5NY7O0,"So I've seen a few reviews on here extolling Babe as wonderful and Pig in the City as a nightmarish hell scape that no parent should ever submit their child to (apologies for hyperbole). Here's the thing, Babe IS an adorably sweet movie with talking animals, and it's great.

Pig in the City, which I think is the superior film, is very different, though. Remember movies like The Neverending Story, or Dark Crystal, where it was okay for kid's movies to be scary? Where everything wasn't rounded edges and cartoonish? Pig in the City leans towards that vein. There IS danger, not everyone is your friend, and life can get complicated sometimes. I'm not telling you to show your kids Taxi Driver, but PitC can be scary at times. But through empathy, and a bottomlessly compassionate heart, Babe's heroic nature shines through. Sorry moms, if you're looking for a flick to sit the kids in front of while you get loaded on red wine in the kitchen, Babe 2 ain't that. But it's an exquisite and beautiful film, accessible by audience members of any age.",1431993600,14,1049,4.6702702702702705
