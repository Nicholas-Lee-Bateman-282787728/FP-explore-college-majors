7960907,5,B000065B2K,"Don't be misled - this circa 2004 product is a worthwhile review of GED skills, but it doesn't cover the latest high school equivalency exams. Instead, look for Video Aided Instruction's 2014 versions!",1387756800,3,201,5.121212121212121

7960909,5,B000065B2K,"I have a 14 and a 17 year old and they were both really having a time with algebra. So I gave this a try (free from my library) and they both said it was the first thing to really help them. I had them sit and watch, then pause it and take notes on each issue with algebra that came up.  Admittedly, there is a guy at a chalkboard explaining math, so it was a shock they got so much out of it. Personally, we homeschool and algebra was a long time ago for me.  Well, the kids raved about this guy. He puts everything into simple terms, no complex craziness; he really breaks it down. I'd say giving this 5 stars was super easy...but I borrowed it for free. Perhaps your library can do an inter-library loan on these? If not, and you have the money for it, get it. It's awesome. It's just like having a math tutor in your house.",1300147200,5,827,4.036585365853658
