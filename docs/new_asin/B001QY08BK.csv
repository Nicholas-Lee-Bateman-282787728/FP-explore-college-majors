3771521,5,B001QY08BK,I was pleased to see that most of the westerns in this package I have never seen. The quality is OK some are worn but are OK to watch. Delivery was fast and packaging great with titles and plot on each sleeve. I also purchased Cowboy Classics 100 Movie Pack and Western Classics 100 Movie Pack I was surprised to see that out of 300 movies only 7 were duplicated I haven't had a chance to view most of them yet but a random sampling showed they were OK viewing.,1348012800,,461,4.133333333333334

These monochrome western movies were very popular from the 1930s to the 1950s in theaters, and on television in the 1950s and 1960s. Their message was: those who do right win in the end. You will find them entertaining and educational. These popular movies defended small ranchers against the big landowners who sought their lands. Others defended people against criminal gangs with collective security. The right to keep and bear arms was well-recognized. Many were set in modern times and showed telephones, radios, and automobiles. Was it changing tastes or economics that caused their decline? This package combines two separate 50 Movie pack collections: The Way West and Frontier Justice. You can see the reviews for each separate package.

The newer westerns changed from property conflicts to personal conflicts. High Noon was an example of personal conflicts (with a hint of business conflicts). One movie noted how an increase in settlers disadvantaged cattle men since they could no longer graze their cattle on publicly owned range land. Store owners could do more business with 500 families than 1,000 transient cowboys. This government land was given to homesteaders, people who would earn the land by working and developing it. These dramas show life and culture as seen by Hollywood and accepted by their customers. This package combines two separate 50 Movie Pack collections: The Way West and Frontier Justice. You can read the reviews for each movie.

These movies were popular before big corporations began to put small owner-operated stores and farms out of business. One way was to cut off small business owners from wholesale distributors. If banks red-lined small businesses they could not get the loans needed for running their business. There were no government loans for farmers and ranchers then. Many of these films were produced by small studios who operated on a low budget. They were threatened by big movie studios with their cartel of theaters. These movies were later shown on television to fill up their broadcast schedule (the way some older TV shows are recycled today). Many of the films were edited for television by reducing their running times to less than 60 minutes. You can notice the loss of scenes in some of these movies.

These movies had little padding and have more action than in some longer big studio productions. Some have songs and dances for entertainment. This collection has Roy Rogers movies, he acted in a wide range of roles. Gene Autry was the best Singing Cowboy. The other stars are: Johnny Mack Brown, Buster Crabbe, James Newill, George OBrien, Tex Ritter, Bob Steele, and Tom Tyler. Many are little remembered today. Tim McCoy and Hoot Gibson were real cowboys; Ken Maynard was a rodeo rider Johnny Mack Brown and Buster Crabbe were athletes. The formula of the Three Mesquiteers seems to have inspired the Range Busters and the Rough Riders (who played undercover investigators who fought gangs of criminals).

3771523,4,B001QY08BK,"The ""Guns of the West 100 Movie Pack"" includes a lot of fine B-western of the 30th/40th and 50th.
Most of them are not shown in Germany. And so it is pleasure for me , as a friend of old Western movies,to have now the opportunity to watch a lot of this movies. In the 50th in Germany they had the rude habit to make from two movies with a runtime of 50-60 minutes one 75 minutes movie. So you had seen two pictures with the same actors,but different stories. They did it mostly with the Al St. John, Bob Steele, Buster Crabbe, Tim McCoy and the Range Busters movies. And so it is fine, that I can watch them now in the original version. What movies in this pack are included is written down from the other customers. The quality of the dvd's are different. You have dvd's with good picture and sound,and some not so good. But it doesn't matter, you got a lot of movies for a really cheap price. I recommending this pack to my friends, who like this kind of movies and know enough english to understand. Final is to say, that the buyer of this pack will got a wonderful collection of western for a good price.",1293148800,6,1108,4.206572769953052

Prior to 2008, MCE multi-packs consisted of flip-discs. Their movies are now issued on single-side, dual layer DVDs. Thus, the first half of this set is flip-disc, the second, dual-layer. The collection's durable snapcase is the thickness of a 500 page book.

Transfer quality of these unrestored films depends entirely on source material. None are pristine studio quality but rarely are they so bad as to be unviewable. Certainly, the price is right for such a large offering of less-common works.

Several of the later Roy Rogers pictures in this collection were originally in ""Trucolor."" The b&w copies here are probably dubbed from 16mm prints once used on early broadcast TV. Despite this source material limitation, ""Guns of the West"" remains an excellent choice for fans of vintage westerns. It's also a fine introduction for newcomers to the fondly recalled bygone era of western movies series.

3771525,5,B001QY08BK,"The 100 movie pack 'Cowboy Classics has the same movies as the two 50 movie packs 'Cowboy Legends' and 'Western Legends' combined. The 100 movie pack 'Guns of the West' has the same movies as the two 50 movie packs 'Frontier Justice' and 'The Way West' combined. The 100 movie pack 'Western Classics' has the same movies as the two 50 movie packs 'Western Classics' and 'Gunslinger Classics' combined. List of the movies in each of these sets can be found in other reviews on Amazon or at the Mill Creek Entertainment website. I bought these sets for the movies from the '30s and '40s.
  I removed all of these movies from the manufacturer's boxes and placed them in a file box for ease of use. I entered all movies into an Excel spreadsheet along with year, rating, runtime, actor, movie pack, and control number. This allows me to use filters to search for certain stars or place the movies in alphabetical order and then return to original order. With this many movies, this very handy.
  Quality of the transfers might be an issue for some people. One movie had what appeared to be several frames from a different film. Another jumped back during the movie and repeated a few minutes. The runtimes on the sleeves aren't always correct. Of the movies that I have watched, most were entertaining even though the quality wasn't pristine.
  If you decide to buy any of these sets, expect lots of Roy Rogers.

  If you're looking for Bob Steele, there are 12 of his films in 'Guns of the West'.

3771526,4,B001QY08BK,"Beware that Amazon is trying to sell Guns of the West as a package deal with The Way West, presumably unaware that they contain the same movies. Guns of the West is merely different packaging containing the two 50-movie sets The Way West and Frontier Justice.

Here's a paste of the movie titles in Guns of the West from another site:

I'll give Amazon the benefit of the doubt -- some of these packages are pretty new and the seller hasn't had a chance to find out what's in them (even though other sites have, and offer lists of the titles, which seems the least a seller should do). I hope Amazon realizes what's up and deletes the package offer for two items that contain the same movies. Amazon, are you listening? What you're offering there would be a really bad deal.

Otherwise, the contents are what they are: old B-Westerns, some better than others but nothing that's going to rise to the level of Once Upon a Time in the West. If you like this sort of thing, you can't beat the price. I get a lot out of these sets, but I'm mainly interested in locations and can live with formulaic scripts and acting that would be bad enough to get you kicked out of the junior high holiday pageant.

Frontier Justice is much better than The Way West, but if you buy the whole 100-movie set you can see for yourself.",1250899200,19,3192,4.8388278388278385

While I could wish for a little better picture quality they're still very watchable.  I'm not sure if these could be restored to their original pristine condition or not.  I am sure if they were to be restored they would cost a lot more than what they are now.  Some people could afford a much higher price but I for one could not.
