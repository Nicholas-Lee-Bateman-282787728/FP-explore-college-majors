683780,5,6303568068,"Fay, Batty, Chundo, Crooky, and their dog Buster celebrate each of the twelve days of Christmas with canine curiosity and cleverness.  They count the days for us through their Christmas preparations: cleaning the house,  decorating, making ornaments and cookies, wrapping gifts, and finally  trimming the tree.  For a fun afternoon, we recommend you try their  fruitcake recipe.  Almost as good as their alphabet soup.  (Aunt Mary will  never be the same after you send this gift.)  Dogs and their humans, young  and old, will thoroughly enjoy this holiday extravaganza--again and again  and again.  (If you don't trust us, just ask RME's five-year-old son and  two-year-old-airedale.)",911520000,10,685,5.40952380952381
7850624,5,6303568068,"Faye, bom bom bom bom, presents:  Faye's 12 days of Christmas.  Not to be confused with any other 12 days of Christmas  You'll meet Faye, Crooky Batty and Chundo and their dog.  You'll learn how fruit cake is really made.  You'll see lovely diamond patterns.  You'll see Santa's workshop.  You will laugh.  Your kids will probably enjoy it too.  But not as much as you will.

You like dogs, don't you?",1391385600,,401,4.52112676056338

7850626,2,6303568068,"As a fan of Wegman and Fay, I was hoping this would be as amusing as Alphabet Soup, but no, it's tedious. Normally the 12 days of Christmas refer to the day itself plus those following ( think five gold rings, four mockingbirds, etc) but this video charts the dogs' activities leading up to Christmas. Even our 7-year-old was bored. Not recommended.",1327449600,,349,4.645161290322581
7850627,3,6303568068,"OK, once you get past the first few minutes the laffs wear off.  Its mildly amusing, but, really, I cannot see why people think this is so funny.  If you haven't seen it yet, I won't give the punch line away, but it wears thin pretty quick.  Add a star if you are a dog lover and you have a really, really dry sense of humor, like Sahara dry.",1167523200,,342,3.927536231884058
7850628,5,6303568068,"This is a video we have watched year after year.  Sometimes we try to watch it on the 12th day before Christmas.  If you love those dogs, you'll love this!  Hey!  It's the one they made!",1163808000,,186,4.083333333333333
7850629,5,6303568068,"at a party, we popped this in the VCR just for fun. About five seconds later I was rolling on the floor in laughter. This is by far the funniest thing I have EVER seen in my entire life, no joke. I laughed so so hard that I cried. I'm now a huge fan of Fay, Crookie, Vatti and the whole gang. If you need some laughs, this is the perfect thing for you.",1078617600,3,352,3.77027027027027
7850630,5,6303568068,"This video has gotten a cult following at Rutgers University.  It's so funny and random.  You get the feeling that the whole think took one take.  It almost seems like the narator is making it up as he goes along.  This is absolutly one of those things that was probably made for children, but can only truly be apreciated by young adults on.  Definetally check this out if you want a wacky christams expierience.",1038700800,3,413,4.527027027027027
