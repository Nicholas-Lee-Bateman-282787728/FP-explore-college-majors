A little goes a long way. Many of the quotes left me thinking ""Huh?"" These writers marched to the beat of their own drummers, and their drums were often strange.
  Their heads were in the clouds
  Their feet not on the ground
  They said a lot of words
  But most were only sound",1488067200,,444,4.531645569620253
8417848,3,B00478ED72,"Enjoyable movie to pass a hot summer afternoon in a cool refrigerated movie theater.  That's what they said back in 1950.
Kent Smith plays a down on his luck man who is picked out by a nefarious lawyer to play a double to an almost 7 year missing millionaire. The plot thickens as Kent picks up the pieces to the mystery and the viewer gets drawn into the play. Kent provides his typically good performance in this slightly campy black and white early 1950's era movie. Notice the unethical attorney performance of Robert Douglas who 2 years earlier played the nemesis and adversary of Gary Cooper's Howard Roark in ""The Fountainhead."" This is a fun romp of a light weight cinematic mystery.

Definitely not a four star movie but a solid Warner Bros. film noire example and enjoyable to watch.",1331078400,3,793,4.6571428571428575
