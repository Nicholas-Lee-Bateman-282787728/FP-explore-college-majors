8317992,3,B001LF368G,"I attended graduate school at the University of Alabama from 1996 to 2001. Therefore, I was excited to see that Rachel Goslins had made a documentary about Jessica Thomas' attempt to become UA's 5th black Homecoming Queen by overcoming the power of the infamous Greek-run ""Machine"" that controls student government at UA.

There are a number of strong aspects of `Bama Girl:
-  I learned a lot about how student candidates practice ""retail politics"" at UA. The scenes in which the candidates go across campus scrambling for votes are educational. Goslins also does a good job of building the tension as the votes for Queen are counted.
-  An interesting subplot is the tensions that exist between the black sororities at UA. Two black sororities run candidates for Queen, and the tensions create some dramatic scenes.
-  `Bama Girl contains an interesting segment on the Kappa Alpha fraternity's celebration of the Confederacy during its ""Old South Week."" Some of the visuals (guys in Confederate uniforms, women in hoop skirts) are memorable. One of the black sorority members wryly asks her sisters whether the KAs expect to drop their laundry at the women's sorority.
-  Bama Girl has excellent cinematography. The filmmakers did an excellent job of shooting on campus; even the night scenes are easy to see.

Unfortunately, much of the film is disappointing:
- Goslins includes almost no material from members of the UA Machine fraternities and sororities. Instead, she simply caricatures these people as villains. For instance, the filmmakers play a slow, mournful version of ""Dixie"" when The Machine's Homecoming Queen candidate is on screen. The film would be more interesting, and subtle, if Goslins had presented all of the characters as complex human beings.
- `Bama Girl does not examine the extent to which UA's Machine relies on the apathy of the average student. Only about 20% of UA's students are Greeks; the Machine dominates student politics at UA because the other 80% of the students simply do not care. There is no drama in apathetic students (and the politics surrounding the Queen begin to seem somewhat trivial if few people care).
- Goslins' viewpoint is predictable and the film, therefore, is redundant given the thousands of previous works on Southern race relations. Everything the film says has been covered by more-thoughtful artists dozens of times before. If Goslins had looked at race from a creative perspective, `Bama Girl would be much better. For example, Goslins never articulates why it is important that UA have a 5th black Homecoming Queen. She never asks whether ""beauty queens"" are anachronisms or examines the white sorority woman's motivations to become Queen. Ideas such as those would have required a bit of independent thought, and Goslins shows no inclination in that direction.

In the end, `Bama Girl ""seesaws"" between showing the viewer what Goslins discovered without comment and telling the viewer what to think. `Bama Girl is well worth a look. But viewers should be aware that, while Goslins attacks the worst of the Old South, her own views are both predictable and unreflective.",1248480000,,3137,5.103313840155946
8317993,5,B001LF368G,"I'm a proud alumni of Alabama, and this documentary perfectly captures the culture there.  If you've ever said ""race isn't an issue anymore"", watch this film - I bet you'll change your mind.",1247702400,2,190,4.757575757575758
8317994,4,B001LF368G,"Bama Girl shines light in a very dark place, the unreconstructed racism at the University of Alabama. As the viewer follows the competition for homecoming queen, the suspense builds steadily. Can ""The Machine"", operating in that dark, continue to prevent a black girl from ever again becoming queen? This excellent documentary will leave you wondering for years to come.

8317995,5,B001LF368G,"`Bama Girl is an intriguing documentary about the Homecoming Queen race at the University of Alabama.  It follows a black woman against a century of ingrained racial segregation, internal black politics, and a secret group of all-white Greek organizations called 'The Machine.'

Directed by the brilliant up and coming filmmaker, Rachel Goslins, the film tells a story that is as delightful and hilarious as it is achingly painful and serious.  A complicated story of racism which is presented in such a charming and balanced manner that people actually seem to be able to take it in.

I highly recommend `Bama Girl for it's critical content, charm, style, great music and beautifully honest representation of the characters portrayed in the film.",1228521600,2,747,5.2
8317996,5,B001LF368G,"I loved this movie.  I saw it on a friend's recommendation and was so taken by it that I've bought two copies.  I was intrigued by the premise - an African-American contender in a homecoming queen election controlled by a voting bloc of all-white fraternities and sororities - and I thought the movie really delivered.  It provides a unique, sometimes chilling, window onto some of the realities of politics and race relations that still affect the deep South.  And it's also simply the great story of a really compelling heroine.",1228089600,,530,4.855555555555555
8317997,5,B001LF368G,"I first saw this film at the SXSW Film Festival in Austin, TX where it played to a sold out crowd, drew rave audience response and hugely enthusiastic applause.  The second time I saw it, at the Sidewalk Moving Picture Festival in Birmingham, the audience of over 1000 people gave it a sustained standing ovation.  This is an insightful movie about a seemingly innocent subject - a woman running for homecoming queen at the University of Alabama.  But as the film unfolds, you begin to unravel a spider's web of hidden agendas, racial politics and an insidious organization called ""The Machine"" whose implications, influence and alumni stretch far beyond student government, but have made their way into our country's highest political offices today.  In addition to being eye opening, the film's subject is a charming heroine behind whom you can't help but rally, you get caught up in her quest and the larger implications it has.  And beyond that, it's just really entertaining and very funny.  Will intrigue you, scare you, make you laugh and think.  Highly recommended.",1227139200,,1073,4.99438202247191
8317998,4,B001LF368G,"I went to a southern university and was a little bit involved with campus politics and I found the story of 'Bama Girl very familiar and compelling.

The film is well-paced and keeps the viewer involved.  After watching it, I found myself coming back again and again thinking about Jess' campaign.

Anyone interested in coalition building, race relations, or student governance would find this a valuable addition to his or her collection.",1227052800,,439,5.069444444444445
8317999,5,B001LF368G,"I have had the immense pleasure of seeing "" 'Bama Girl"" at several film festivals and private home screenings, and each time I am struck by the picture's sheer entertainment value. Jessica, the film's main subject, is so engaging and likable that it's easy to become invested in her story. You share in her triumphs and troubles, laugh at her jokes, and feel like you get to know her pretty well. When she shares some opinions near the end of the film that might be controversial, the uneasiness one might feel is tempered by your view of Jess as a thoughtful, intelligent individual. There's some amazing footage here -- those rare moments that documentarians thank their lucky stars they were able to catch -- but also a well-crafted story and some accomplished editing. If a captivating story of a young, intelligent African-American taking on an entrenched political machine interests you (and after the recent election, how could it not?), then 'Bama Girl is a film you must not miss.",1227052800,2,989,4.8579881656804735
