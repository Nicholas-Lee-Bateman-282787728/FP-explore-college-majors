8046814,2,B0007CNXW8,"I agree with the other reviewers regarding the less than ideal elements in this instructional material.

I find it more than frustrating to discover the product I just purchased, with this beautiful, elegant, graceful dancing couple on the outside box is not what it seems!

The actual dancer/teachers present a stark contrast to the image on the media package cover.  Check it out from the library first, prior to buying...see for yourself!

This is yet another dust collector on my dance media shelf!",1209772800,,502,5.0120481927710845
8046815,2,B0007CNXW8,"Even though on screen it reads social two step, if you listen you will hear them say Foxtrot and the video practice is the same as the foxtrot.  So there is an editing error.  The foxtrot was repeated in place of the two step.  They should fix this error before you pay a high price for this DVD.  The steps were slow enough to follow for the absolute beginner, but the counting at times did not match the foot movement.  So you were already moving your foot onto step 3 while they were counting aloud step 2.  I would have to say my own counting aloud above theirs to make sense. It still works to do that, but it slows down your learning.  If you are lost in dance class, this DVD may help with practice at home.",1193961600,,714,4.130434782608695
8046816,1,B0007CNXW8,"The instruction offered was lousy.  The waltz is incomprehensible, it bears no resemblance to the way the dance is supposed to look.  I highly recommend ""Learn to Dance in Minutes: Party Dancing"" By: Cal Pozo for the ballroom beginner (like me.) Play it along with a CD of appropriate music.",1179705600,,291,4.8
8046817,3,B0007CNXW8,"They video is very helpful. However, you need more space then the normal living room. I am always bumping into something and have to cut the run short.",1168300800,,151,4.428571428571429
8046818,2,B0007CNXW8,Disappointing! Very boring presentation. Instructors mix up their left from their right so what you see on the DVD isn't what they are saying. Two of the dances -- Fox Trot and Quickstep -- are identical.,1143504000,7,204,4.694444444444445
8046819,5,B0007CNXW8,My wife and I are enjoying the dvd's of ballroom dancing very much.  It is a great way to learn.  Quickly you are able to dance with basic steps. The only drawback was the lack of music to practice the steps after the instruction.  Not a problem if you have a computer and can quickly download a few.  Which we did.  Enjoy!,1141603200,5,323,4.145161290322581
8046820,2,B0007CNXW8,"This DVD claims to teach you four dances: The waltz, foxtrot, social quickstep, and the tango. What they fail to mention however is that the instruction for the foxtrot and the social quickstep are exactly the same. The only difference between the two is the speed of the music playing in the background.

The dances are very thoroughly taught, until you get to the tango. The waltz, which is probably the second hardest dance to learn, takes the most time to learn with it taking up probably forty-five minutes of the DVDs total play time. The quickstep and foxtrot, both the easiest dance to learn, take up about a half-hour each, and the tango, the hardest to learn, they zoom through in about fifteen minutes, as if they were afraid of running out of time on the dvd. The video is relatively low quality, and after a time, the voices of the instructors tend to get on your nerves.

Pick this one up if you want to learn the basic steps, but that's about all you're going to get, and remember that it's three dances, not four. Once you've learned the foxtrot, you know the social quickstep.",1139443200,28,1093,4.543147208121828
