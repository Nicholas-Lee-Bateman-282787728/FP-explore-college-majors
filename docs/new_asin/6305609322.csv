It provides an excellent visual componenet to accompany Erickson's stages of development.  While it is a bit outdated the message and impact are still there.",1354233600,3,267,5.045454545454546
8569644,4,6305609322,"I bought this for the Doonesbury Special, but found myself delighted by the other pieces on the disc as well. Everybody Rides the Carousel is an exploration of the stages of life as defined by psychologist Erik Erikson. My Universe Inside Out is a self-portrait/creation story by Faith Hubley. All three shorts are wonderfully animated and voiced, and are a great introduction to the Hubleys' work if you're unfamiliar with it.",1004400000,7,427,5.028169014084507
