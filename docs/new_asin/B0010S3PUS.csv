8238253,5,B0010S3PUS,One of my favorite William Hartnell stories. A chance to see that all Time Lords are not the same (and what a fully working TARDIS looks like). Anyone collecting the classics should have this one.,1489190400,,196,4.628571428571429
8238254,4,B0010S3PUS,A classic episode that is a strange  mix of comedy and history.,1487808000,,63,4.25
8238255,5,B0010S3PUS,"This story, in many ways, can be considered the precursor of  the later stories with the Master. A rouge Time Lord who is the nemesis of the Doctor.

This story offered a couple of  firsts for Doctor Who, The first appearance of someone else from the Doctor's own world and the first appearance of another TARDIS. This story also was the last Doctor Who story produced by Verity Lambert

The Monk is the other Time Lord and played by Peter Butterworth. He reprised his role in The Dalek's Master Plan from 1966. There was no Time Lord nemesis again until The Terror of the Autons in 1971 when the Master made his first appearance.

I enjoyed this story even with the Doctor not being in the second episode.",1435622400,3,706,4.484375
8238256,5,B0010S3PUS,"Although he was the original Doctor, William Hartnell is often overlooked by all but the most determined Whovians.  During his tenure, the character of the Doctor was still in the formative stages.  ""The Time Meddler"" marks a major turn in the series when the early historical episodes are first combined with science fiction elements.

I've been a fan of this show since 1981, but this was one of the few episodes I hadn't seen.  Now that I've watched it, ""The Time Meddler"" has earned a place on my list of favorite episodes.  Certainly, it's my favorite episode of the Hartnell era.  I rarely give anything five stars, but I loved this episode so much, I couldn't give it even half a star less.",1401321600,2,697,4.626016260162602
