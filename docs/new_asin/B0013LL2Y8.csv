3117738,4,B0013LL2Y8,I have only watched one Rat Pack movie to date. Robin and the hoods was funny. That movie alone was worth the price of the  entire package.

3117739,5,B0013LL2Y8,"It's been a long wait for Rat Pack fans to see the release of ""Sergeants 3"".  This package is worth the price of admission even if you already own the other included films as you will also receive promo photo repros, a press book repro, and the opportunity to mail in for the repro movie posters.  ""Sergeants 3"" is a dirty western in the time of clean westerns - you can see the sweat and filming on location in Utah gives the film a reality that many westerns of the day just didn't have.  Sammy and Frank put in their requisite fine performances with Deano pulling the pranks on the side.  Silly ""Indian"" Ghost Dancers wearing Mexican Festival Masks up the cheese quotient.  There's plenty of drama, camp, shenanigans, and story here to please everyone.  Plus a mule performance that may deserve an Animal Academy Award.  If you have never seen the other films included in this package, well, you've just been missing out.  Who can forget the drama and suspense of the original ""Ocean's 11"", the great songs and campy fun of ""Robin and the 7 Hoods"" (esp. Sammy's stunning song and dance routine for ""Bang Bang""), and the goofiness of ""4 for Texas""?

3117740,4,B0013LL2Y8,"What an era it was! JFK and the 'New Frontier', 'Camelot', ""High Hopes"", and the combined electricity of Frank, Dino, Sammy, Peter, and Joey, linked forever to the magic of the times. It was inevitable 'The Rat Pack' would make movies, and, at last, ""The Rat Pack Ultimate Collectors Edition"" offers all of their major film work. Are these films 'classics'? Certainly not! But they are all entertaining fun, and provide a glimpse at the hottest stars in America back when optimism was the key word, and the future seemed bright!

""Ocean's Eleven"" (1960): Director Lewis Milestone (""All Quiet on the Western Front""), not known for his 'light' touch, did provide the most balanced direction of all the ""Rat Pack"" features. 11 army buddies execute the ultimate heist in Las Vegas, a device revived in George Clooney's 'remake', 40 years later. While most of the fun occurred 'off camera', as the boys drank and entertained at the Sands, each night of filming, you do get to see Dino sing ""Ain't That a Kick in the Head"", Sammy dance, a bit, and Frank with occasional girlfriend Angie Dickinson. Richard Conte, as a dying buddy, is terrific, and the film is a straightforward crime film with a twist. (3 stars, out of 4)

""Sergeants 3"" (1962): John Sturges (""The Great Escape"") was another director not known for comedy, but excellent in westerns and action films, which provides this Western reworking of ""Gunga Din"" a fast pace, and terrific climactic scenes. While the stereotypes of the time are present (Indians are all bloodthirsty and superstitious savages), the guys are obviously enjoying themselves (with Dino delivering Cary Grant's immortal line when confronted by hundreds of homicidal Indians). Famous as the film where Sammy borrowed, and lost, Duke Wayne's ""Rio Bravo"" Stetson! (3 stars, out of four)

""4 for Texas"" (1963): Director Robert Aldrich's follow-up to ""Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?"", this Western comedy only loosely qualifies as a 'Rat Pack' film (only Frank and Dino appear), but offers a flippant, laid-back attitude that personified the team. As competing gamblers who unite to open a riverboat casino, the pair share a taste in exotic European women (Anita Ekberg and Ursula Andress), and face some terrific villains (Charles Bronson and Victor Buono). Dino even has a comic moment with the 3 Stooges! Not great, but fun... (2 1/2 stars, out of 4)

""Robin and the Seven Hoods"" (1964): Remarkably, the only true musical Frank, Dino, and Sammy ever made together! Directed by Gordon Douglas, this Capra-esque comedy resets the 'Robin Hood' story in 1930s Chicago, with the guys as likable mobsters assuming the persona's of Robin, Little John, and Will Scarlet. The villains are top-notch (Peter Falk and Victor Buono), Barbara Rush is an opportunistic 'Maid Marian', and, best of all, Bing Crosby guest stars as bookish Allen A. Dale (in the role Peter Lawford was to play, until Lawford and Sinatra had a falling out). GREAT songs (including Frank singing ""Chicago...My Kind of Town""), classic screen character actors in support, and Edward G. Robinson, as Sinatra's mentor, all combine for a first-rate entertainment. Sadly, JFK was assassinated during the filming (which affected Sinatra, deeply, and ended the 'Rat Pack' era), but this would be a fitting finale, and the best of the films. (4 stars, out of 4).

It's been my experience that you either really enjoy these movies or you won't get them or like them at all. The film database has them all rated at around 6/10, some higher, some lower. However, that seems rather low if you know what you're getting as far as a group dynamic. None of these films were ever intended to be tightly plotted thrillers. Instead they are just each an opportunity to see a bunch of cool guys - as cool was defined in 1960 - who were close friends with some kind of plot in the background to give them the opportunity to interact with one another and act cool with a purpose. I give the set five stars because, if that's what you like, you'll love this set.",1202601600,18,1970,5.195583596214511

3117748,5,B0013LL2Y8,"The Rat Pack is, in my opinion, the greatest group of movie stars we have ever seen.  Watching a movie that has multiple members of this ensemble of players may not introduce you to the greatest cinema of all time, like a Schindler's List or Godfather, but will enjoy yourself none the less.  Watching them on screen, you could tell they simply enjoyed each others company.  They were friends, and they had a good time together, whether it was work or play.

This collection of films is a good introduction to The Rat Pack.  During most of the films, the tendency was for the group to film during the day, go out and either perform on stage or party in the evening (depending on where they were), party late into the evening, catch some shut-eye in the early morning hours and then wake up in the early afternoon and do it all over again.  Ocean's 11 is the original film that the modern version staring George Clooney and Brad Pitt is based on.  In each of these, again, do not expect the world's greatest dialog (I don't want people to expect more than what they are if you've never seen them before...they are great though!)
