I didn't see where the ""leveling"" was evening things up for children to play with adults.  It's just a ""miss"" as far as games go.  You're better off with Playstation or Nintendo games than something like this.",1210464000,,353,4.46875
8144613,5,B000IAIC02,"This game is great family fun. I have 3 kids age 11, 7, and 20 months. It is hard to play games with the 11 and 7 year olds without the toddler trying to get into everything and taking all the game pieces. This DVD game is great, as there are no pieces to lose, it is purely a digital game. It is very educational. We have learned so much about animals and wild-life. It is one of the only games I can play with the toddler in the room. She just oohs and aahs at the video clips of the animals. I am looking for more DVD games like this.",1188086400,,537,3.8468468468468466
