7874742,4,6304611765,"When a doctor, a beloved pediatrician, unexpectedly dies in what everybody believes to be an accident, though the viewer knows better, her husband (Alan Rachins) and grown daughter (Rena Sofer) try to cope with their loss.
A year later he introduces his daughter to a widow (Linda Evans) that he has met and to her beautiful, sexpot daughter (Bridget Wilson). All seems too good to be true, and when her father seemingly rushes into marrying this woman, his daughter is a little concerned, especially as her would be stepsister seems to be a mantrap, stopping at nothing to get any man.
Shortly after the marriage, the daughter notices that her stepsister's behavior, where her father is concerned,  has exceeded the bounds of propriety. She also notices that her father seems to be ailing and his concerned colleague and professional partner has commented on some behavioral changes he has noticed. She mentions this to the stepmother, who advises her stepdaughter that she will take care of it. What she does and what the viewer discovers is a little surprising, as it is a bit of a twist in the expected.
Soon all becomes clear, as this cat and mouse thriller wends its way to its inevitable conclusion. Good, competent performances are given by the entire cast in this reasonably enjoyable thriller that seems like a made for TV movie.  It is certainly worth a rental. It would also be worth buying, but not at the current asking price of the video, as it is still priced for the rental market and exorbitant.",1050969600,5,1513,4.793103448275862
