2415817,5,B000BGH254,"Because they are never happy. They'll complain about how every other series after G1 ""Wasn't good enough"" for whatever reasons, and yet they'll complain about what they didn't like G1.

Okay guys, so the series didn't fit your mioptic little idea of how a series should have wen't, great, good.

Suspend your disbeliefe folks. If you take the series for what it is, instead of looking at what came before it (come on, Generation 1, despite it's classic status, was poorly animated and the plots were horrid.) This is an excellent series.

The animation is top notch, and the storyline has a great technology vs nature plot not to mention that it is a clash of two different idologies.

Great great series.",1127001600,6,705,4.754098360655738
2415818,3,B000BGH254,"The first thing ill say about the beast machines series is that it wasn't THAT bad. ok so the references to previous series were a little choppy. and the transformation method they use lacks the old familar clank and bang sound affects we all grew up with. But put it this way, this is the only continuing series to follow up our much loved beast wars, if you refuse to watch this than i suggest you invest in the beast war action figures and make your own follow up show. however in this reality beast machines is in fact a peice in transformer history, and if your a real fan then you would be happy to respect this chapter of the transformers saga and buy this dvd set.  ""I AM TRANSFORMED"".....heh...that was kinda corny",1127001600,3,723,4.395522388059701
2415819,3,B000BGH254,"This show was an absolute slap in the face to fans of Beast Wars.  Of course, not a few people thought Beast Wars was the same to fans of the original Transformers, but that's for another review.  If you have invested in the amazing Beast Wars DVDs, you were left wanting even more--they were just that good.  This is not what you want.  Mainframe's different animation style, lacking reflective metals, was the first slap.  A complete discontinuity with the excellent Transmetals story line, including breaks from character despite the use of the same voice actors, was next.  Dragging out a ""mystery"" across two short (13 episode) seasons whose resolution was the all-time ultimate slap in the face of robot-lovers everywhere (including those who like them in animal form) was the last.  Throw in the fact that you have a show about robots who shoot bullets and missiles at their enemies all day long but have--wait for it--NO bullets or missiles, and why would you watch this show at all?  Now, that all stated, if you have no allegiance to Beast Wars (or G1 Transformers, for that matter), then this might be for you.  The animation was terrific, very much the same as everything from Mainframe at the time (think Action Man, Cubix, etc.).  There are a lot of robots that are pretty cool.  Tankorr was really awesome looking.  Looking.  (Terrible character whose secret was nothing short of utter disappointment for a Beast Wars fan, ruining a fan-favorite character and all as it did. )  There are redeeming storylines for some of the characters.  I can't say the pacing was enjoyable, but maybe you enjoy a ""mystery.""  Pretty icing on a crap cake, really though.  A real shame, because I think Mainframe usually does awesome work.  Bob Skir, show runner for Beast Machines, was no fan of Beast Wars and tried to make connections back to it and G1 Transformers with little reverence or even awareness of the source material that came before it.  Anyway, you've been warned.",1126915200,9,1978,4.816023738872404
2415820,5,B000BGH254,"""Beast Machines"" was definitely a unique show. Airing from 2000-2001, it was the follow-up to the enormously successful ""Beast Wars"" (1996-1999). ""Beast Machines,"" while retaining the ""Beast Wars"" characters, story background, voice actors, animation studio, and even music composer, took the Transformers story in a very different direction. Rather than a straight-ahead battle between good guys and bad guys, ""Beast Machines"" presented its audience with a much darker, more philosophically driven story.

Fans of the ""Matrix"" trilogy may enjoy this series, as it has much more in common with that than with other Transformers series, in my opinion. Old-school Transformers fans might raise a few eyebrows at the departures from the original 1980's cartoon (and even from ""Beast Wars""), but if you're interested in a more mature and thought-provoking series, then ""Beast Machines"" is definitely worth checking out.",1126915200,9,915,5.630434782608695
2415821,5,B000BGH254,"There was a good amount of negative reviews about Beast Machines: it wasn't a real Transformers show, the missing characters, bringing organic life to Cybertron, etc.

First off, this is a Transformers show. But the way the characters transfrom is different from what original Transfomers and Beast Wars fans are used to. Here, transforming is more involved since they have to learn how to do it. When you think about it, it makes sense since they were reformatted into tech-organic bodies.

Second, there is a mystery of what happened when the Maximals returned to Cybertron. Their transmetal bodies have been lost, the entire planet is hunting them, Megatron is ruling the planet, and Rhinox and Silverbolt have disappeared. The mystery is solved later on, so you got to keep watching to find out.

Having organic life on Cybertron puts a very interesting twist to the show. Since it was believed for a long time that the planet was entirely technological, revealed that it supported organic life adds to the depth of the show.

Say what you want, Beast Machines is a superb Transformers show.",1126915200,7,1095,4.934782608695652

It still isn't clear to me exactly how they got into the predicament, except vague flashbacks, and the conclusion leaves you wondering how things are going to be fixed.

2415829,3,B000BGH254,"I bought this since I never saw it, but I really liked Beast Wars.  The animation is okay and the music is cheesy.  The scenes are always dark since the Maximals are always hiding from Megatron's henchmen.  And it just seems hopeless the entire time.  The characters are weird looking until you get used to them.  I wouldn't recommend this to a kid since they may get bored from this.

I like the series since I'm a huge Transformers fan, and this completes my collection, unless a new Transformers Prime is done.  This isn't a bash on this series even if it sounds like it.  If you're a die hard fan, go for it.  If not, you'll probably better off checking out G1, Prime or Beast Wars.",1479859200,2,686,4.338582677165355

2415849,4,B000BGH254,"Taking place shortly after the finale of the Beast Wars, Optimus Primal and half his crew awaken on their home planet of Cybertron.  But something's wrong, they're stuck in the original Beast Modes they acquired in BW's first season, unable to transform on a world seemingly devoid of life.  But they're not alone on a world full of threats, both old and new.  This series is the controversial end to the 1980's Generation One animated canon, with an odd focus on spirituality as the origins of the Transformers are again in question.  The animation is decent, if dated, but a lot of the characters are badly off, well, character.  Their growth through three seasons of Beast Wars is all but ignored as they become rough she;;s of their former shelves.  A desire to bring a new element to the franchise subverts the characters we've grown to know.
The series, mind you, is not without merit.  The animation is still solid, if dated, but not as badly as its predecessor series.  The new characters, chiefly mechanical as a callbaack to their robotic roots, have sharp looks and slick personalities.  While it's an odd cyber-duck with a questionable ending, it's also a mostly satisfying to the series many grew up with.",1436918400,6,1218,4.7894736842105265

I finally decided to try it. And it's totally different.  While it attempts to continue the storyline everything is different.  Personalities, philosophies, and even motives. Not to mention Megaton who was arguably the most entertaining individual on beast wars is now a brooding politician that just so happens to be a floating head.

2415870,4,B000BGH254,"Thank you Shout Factory for sending us this DVD set to review.

Transformers Beast Hunters takes place after the Beast Wars series.  In this universe the part organic part robotic Maximals are descendants of the autobots and are led by Optimus Primal who has a gorilla like appearance.  The Decepticons are now known as Predacons with Megatron as their leader.  The scenery on Cyberton has changed as the planet is lifeless and mostly empty with the exception of deadly Vehicon drones patrolling it. Since Cybertron is filled with Enregon, both factions are fighting to save or control it.  Can the Maximals master their beast like forms and stop Megatron from taking over?

This DVD series has 4 DVDs which include both seasons and all twenty-six episodes.  There are 690 minutes of nonstop action with 3D rendered computer animation.  The voice acting and character development is pretty good if you can look past their animal appearances.  Many episodes teach about the value of friendship, teamwork, restoration, and forgiveness.  While those are good attributes, there are some flaws worth mentioning as well.  There's some adult humor and a few phrases may go over younger kid's heads.  For younger kids/preschoolers  I recommend the Rescue Bot series since the action in Beast Machines may be a bit intense for them.

For grade school age boys this is a DVD set worth looking into.  The price is a reasonable $22, especially for nearly 700 minutes of entertainment!",1418428800,,1472,5.024793388429752

This series is really good, breathes new life into the beast wars saga, while changing it a bit. The story for this series is megatron managed to get to cybertron first, and he managed to take over. But worse where are all the transformers? Megatron took all their sparks. Can optimus save all of cybertron, and do as the oracle wants and bring organic life to cybertron?

4 total dvds, good series tho different.
And im glad I was able to get it for such a decent price.

Now if only they'd do a beast wars movie, like they did to transformers movies. I'd love to see that. Specially if they had transmetal, and transmetal 2.

As a Transformers fan I have to say that I continued to be impressed with not only the story of this series, but also the animation throughout the entire series while I watched it (again) with my kids for the first time. My girls were enthralled and entertained and kept wanting to watch more and more which is exactly what I want to see when they get into a series. There are some twists and turns that any Transformers fan will love to see!

There's a misconception that this show was more for little kids. This could not be further from the truth. This was much grittier and darker than Beast Wars. If you don't compare it too much to Beast Wars, you won't be disappointed. Take it for what it is and you might enjoy it!

One thing is for sure: this show was consistently good from beginning to end, whereas Beast Wars fell in quality halfway through the show, and the ending left much to be desired. The ending to Beast Machines feels much more complete.",1409961600,3,628,4.607142857142857
2415887,3,B000BGH254,"Beast Machines is a polarizing take on the Transformers and Beast Wars lines. Set a short amount of time after the last Episode of Beast Wars, Beast Machines opens up with the Maximals on the run from an onslaught of Vehicon transformer drones on Cybertron. Initially we learn that after getting back to Cybertron the Maximals have lost some memory of their recent past and have been trapped and and reverted to their original non transmetal Beast modes. The first season delves into the remaining Maximals quest to gain new Techno Organic forms, finding out whats happened to Cybertron and their lost comrades from the Ark Shuttle ship, Megatrons whereabouts, contending with three Vehicon Generals, and discovering the hidden past and reemerging future of Cybertron.

Gone are the cartoony antics of Beast Wars. Beast Machines matures its story to hit an aging fanbase from the original Beast Wars. Each of the surviving Maximals, including Optimus Primal, Cheetor, Blackarachnia, and Rattrap, get an interesting character arc over the course of the series. Some aren't bad while others just makes the series suffer some.

Season two shakes things up a bit with regaining a lost character and losing two Generals in the process. But Megatron makes up for it late in the season by introducing two more very competent generals to take their places. The entire second season seems to be the shake up for control of Cybertron. The Maximals Techno-Organic balance vs. Megatron's Vehicon Machine purity.
The ending of the series, if not the entirety of it leaves many fans a tad jaded. I myself find the ending  and the series itself a very decent watch.

The animation used is a big point of contention..Again done in CGI as was Beast Wars. But where as Beast Wars normally tried to have the character models stay in their solid component forms unless hitting a cartoony moment, the Maximals as Techno Organincs seem to be able to flex and bend in ways some people don't think robots should. The Vehicons tend to be slightly more rigid but also display some flexing to certain elements. And the biggest point of contention is the Maximals transformations. During Beast Wars we had the simple parts becoming robot parts and extra kibble as per the originals always had. In Beast Machines the Maximals don't transform as much as fluidly Morph from one form to another as a light passes over them. Add to this the constant darkness over the entire series compared to the bright skies of Beast Wars and it just doesn't hit as well as Beast wars did.

 Many of the previous actors reprise their Beast Wars Characters including Garry Chalk as Optimus Primal, Venus Terzo as Blackarachnia, Scott Mcneil as Rattrap, Ian Corlett as Cheetor, and David Kaye as Megatron.

2415888,4,B000BGH254,"I enjoyed Beast Machines quite a lot.  Mainly because it was quite a dark series. It is a direct sequel to Beast Wars.  But even from the beginning, it was quite a dark series.

All transformers on Cybertron (aside from the main group of Beast Machines Maximals) had already been defeated & their sparks (aka souls) had been removed by Megatron. Megatron actually already won before the series even started! It was quite philosophical (some times too much), but once Megatron purified himself (I won't say any more than that), it was a really cool series.

I especially like the series finale, which had a much better fight than the series finale battle in Beast Wars (although Megatron was a bit too dominant in both fights IMHO).

A lot of the episodes weren't what I was expecting, it was basically nature/Zen vs technology.  However, once you got more into the series, it really started to pick up.

It had the best final fight out of any Transformers TV series (aside from the original animated TF: Movie's Optimus VS Megatron of course), but it is a bit too philosophical to recommend to everyone. Still, if you watch it with an open-mind and you stick through the initial episodes, you'll definitely like it.

Also, despite being quite dark (even to the very last episode), it does have a happy ending, but some characters do die.",1403481600,,1337,4.708154506437769
2415889,3,B000BGH254,"Mainframe Entertainment had come a long way technically since that first two-part pilot of Beast Wars. More powerful computers, better software and greatly-more-experienced technical staff had made the final season of Beast Wars, as our heroes rode off into the wormhole, a great hook for the upcoming Beast Machines.

What happened? Most importantly, Robert Forward, who'd contributed so much to the Beast Wars mythos moved on, to be replaced by Bob Skir, who apparently had little understanding or appreciation for either Transformers in general, or Beast Machines in particular.

One of the most important points of the original Beast Wars series was that our robots were just that. Robots, who reprogrammed themselves to take on the appearances and behaviors of local fauna that most closely matched them. Their leader took on the form of a mountain gorilla, both strong and intelligent; their spy became a rat, small and sneaky, and so forth. Still and all, though, they were robots.

Suddenly, they find themselves on a nightmare version of their home planet, trapped in bizarre recasts of their animal forms, unable to transform to their more versatile robot forms. Far too many episodes in, our leader discovers that they  must now use a kind of ""robot zen"" to achieve their transformations. A difficult thing to do in the middle of a firefight, even if it did provide some amusement as Rattrap desperately tried to reach a Zen state while in a blind panic.

Now, let's get this straight. Somewhere in the electronics of a Transformers body, there's a switch of some kind that reads ""Robot<-->Alternate Form"".  When the computer brain sends a pulse to that switch, our hero goes from one form to another. It's that simple, they are, after all, ""Robots in Disguise"".

Instead, we find ourselves stuck in a world part Matrix, part Tron and completely confusing. Characters suddenly switch sides against teammates whom they've risked their lives for just a season ago for reasons that make no sense in general, and even less in character. Motivations make no sense, and explanations less so.

Still, this isn't to say it's all bad. As a stand-alone series, it's more than adequate, occasionally quite entertaining. However, as a sequel to Beast Wars, I just can't accept it. It has some fun light moments (""Okay, so I'm a Tree Hugger."") but to me they were too few and far between.

Ironically, Bob Skir went on to write for ""Godzilla- The Animated Series"", where his storytelling was, in my opinion, far superior to the movie it was based on. He seemed to have a strong grasp of what made a good kaiju story.

If you're a completist, by all means, buy this set. It's technically brilliant for its time. If you can get into a world that's one step past The Matrix, definitely get it. As an independent universe, it's a good view, and interesting. If you're a fan of Beast Wars or the other Transformers titles, approach with caution and try to see an episode or two before you buy. Otherwise, you might be in for a disappointment.",1402358400,6,3035,4.864341085271318

2415893,4,B000BGH254,"What you are about to read is the ramblings of a man with too much time on his hands, a Transformers collection that consists of 300+ characters across different toylines, and his own opinion.  That said, take what I say with a grain of salt.  This is my opinion, and my opinion alone...and a lengthy one, at that.  Transformers is a hobby of mine, one that I have had since I was ""young"" kid back in the 80's.  When most kids my age were eating up Star Wars, Star Trek, Ninja Turtles or Spider-Man, I was nose-deep in TF lore.  I am not an expert, but am more knowledgable of the franchise/universe tham most.  My favorite series tend to be the ones the general fanbase doesn't like...this is not intentional, mind you...but seems to happen because the ones I do like are the most plot-heavy and/or deviate ""somehow"" from the original, to the disdain of most ""GenWhiners"" and ""purists"".

Personally, I think this show was a long time coming.  As a child, I watched Gen 1, and realized that, with the introduction (and sudden end) of the series during the Headmasters, that Cybertron had never really been saved, never really knew peace since the Autobot/Decepticon war began.  They were always compromising with resources and energon.  (Even their ""upgrade"" to Maximal and Predacons was a compromise to use less energon, but effectively weakening themselves to some degree.)  The only thing that made sense was to find balance between mechanical and organic for the planet and its populace to not just survive, but THRIVE.  (The planet did not become completely organic at the end of BM, but rather, a merging of both.)  If you look to another series (The Matrix Triology) and the world in general, one realizes that the mechanical is as dependant on the human (organic) as much as the organic is dependant on the machine.  When nature and technology are allowed to work in balance, civilization (Cybertron included) are better off than if one or the other became the dominant force.

This show also used time travel elements...at least on two occaisions...and seeing as to how the Gen 1 cartoon contuity (which this is a part of) had a lot of holes and incosistencies, how does anyone say that this ""slaughtered"" the continuation?  When time travel is involved, a lot of unseen effects can happen, and things can very well change.  In the end of Beast Wars, Dragon Megatron wasn't shown returning Gen1 Megatron's spark...did he?  If he did, it wasn't shown in the show...and how did that effect the timeline if he didn't?  Maybe by Beast Machines, aspects of Gen1 Megatron began to take over...and really, do you think Gen1 Megatron would have approved of being in a ""meat sack"" of a body, or allowing Cybertron to go that wat, for that matter?

Also, merging Primal and Prime's spark...you would think THAT would have effected Optimus in the future as well, right?

I think that fans of Beast Wars who slam Beast Machines as an attack on the continuation are using ""selective judgment"", weeding out/ignoring what they don't like, rather than realizing WHAT IS.  To me, accepting Beast Wars is to accept the outcome of Beast Machines...if you can't, forget the impact of Beast Wars on the timeline, and leave it all at Gen1 Headmasters.

This show can also be seen as a nod to the Nazi reign of terror, with Megatron being somewhat of a conflicted and oft-hypocritical figure like Hitler.  The Maximals on the run adds a sense of desperation, much like the victims of the Reich probably felt unti the time that the war could finally be taken to the madman.  Of course, there are some people out there who could argue with me on this one.

As far as the character personalities ""changing for the worse"", or being ""one dimensional"", I have to differ.  They became more focused, and things that were hinted on in Beast Wars were brought out to full light.  They grew naturally to me, and the choice/direction that every character underwent could be seen as foreshadowed in Beast Wars.  I am not going to bother covering characters like Nightscream, Savage Noble, or Botanica, instead focusing on the evolution of the Beast Wars survivors.

The breakdown is as such:

Optimus Primal:
During Beast Wars, he often made references to the Covenant of Primus, especially during season 3, quoting passages of scripture.  For example, when referring to Tigerhawk, Primal referred to the Vox emmisary as ""the mighty warrior from the heavens.""  When Dinobot II sacraficed himself to save the Maximals, Primal again quoted from the Covenant: ""In the spark of an enemy, there will be salvation, and in the darkest hour, there will be a light.""  So, it is safe to say that Primal was already one of the more religious characters under the surface, and it was little shock to me when he became a prophet of the Oracle.  Once you consider the fact that he has been ""reborn"" so many times...a religious symbolism within itself...you can see why people compare him to a ""messiah"" or ""buddha"" in his own right.  It could be argued that he became a ""bigger deal"" than even Optimus Prime, as his actions brought restoration to Cybertron, instead of simplly sustaining it.

Rattrap:
Comes across as a blend of Gen1 Bumblebee and Cliffjumper, but with a few quirks.  Was a cocky and arrogant bot right out of the gate in Beast Wars.  If one understands cocky/arrogant characters, those types are usually cowards and insecure at the core, but can come across as ""tougher than the rest"" as long as they had something to hide behind and protect their insecure center.  Rattrap had guns, explosives, and a well-armed crew to hide behind/work worth, so he could continue the ""tough guy"" charade during most of Beast Wars.  In Beast Machines, when he is stripped of his firepower and ability to convert for some time, his true core was exposed and all the tough talk had nothing to prop itself on.  Suddenly becoming a coward?  No...he always was, but always had something to hide behind until now.  (He was my favorite Maximal in Beast Wars, so this is by no means a bash on his character.)  His depression was understandable...I mean, imagine being stuck in rat mode with a tank threating to squash you all the time.  I think bravery would have, at this point, taken a back seat to survival.  (Like it or not...sometimes, cowards DO survive.)

Rhinox:
Intelligent, logical, and would rather relax than fight.  Good to the spark, sure, but you can believe a character like that hated war, hated suffering, hating fighting...and to him, devoting himself to Megatron's cause made the most sense, as Megatron offered a FASTER way out.  I really don't think he would have defected if not for his spark being put in Tankor and got a ""taste"" of the other side, but once there, logically AND emotionally, it made the most sense.  The war and all suffering would have ended in the blink of an eye, Rhinox realized, if the Maximals would have simply surrendered.  Logically, why suffer if you don't have to?  Emotionally, why suffer if you don't have to?
There were NUMEROUS Gen 1 characters, both Autobot and Decepticon, who could have been on the other side if not for a key point or two.  For example, the only reason Grimlock wasn't a Decepticon is he hated bullies.  He loved to fight, loved to destroy, thought only the strongest survived...all that would seem to make him a perfect Decepticon, except for the fact he didn't think the strong should impose their power onto the weak.  Thundercracker, a Decepticon, could have been an Autobot if he didn't fear Megatron.  When talking of some ""lesser"" opponents, Thundercracker's attitude was similar to that of Grimlock: ""These creatures were never worthy adversaries. The Decepticons are forged through combat, not slaughter.""  If he would have trusted the Autobots more and feared Megtron less, Thundercracker could have very well been an Autobot...and a decent one at that.
When Black Arachnia and Dinobot (originally Predacon) went Maximal, very few people complained.  To some people I knew, Black Arachnia made a better Pred...but they didn't get their way.  Can't win them all, and very few characters are sacred in a plot that involves war and change.

Cheetor:
Hot Rod ver. 2.0...Cheetimus Primal...really.  If Gen 1 Hot Rod/Rodimus would have showed up pre 1986 movie, you better believe he would have been as thick-headed, rebellious, and foolish as Cheetor started out as.  However, with war, a character like this usually either dies or evolves into a natural leader of sorts.  Since Cheetor survived Earth, where not all Maximals had, Rhinox was gone and Rattrap was falling to pieces (and rightfully so), Cheetor had to step up.  He had made so many mistakes in his past, it allowed him to understand failure well enough to know how to succeed.  While Rattrap was the default #2, I don't think it would have made much sense for Ratttrap to be #1, as he hated the limelight after a while.  Cheetor thrived on it, so it makes more sense for him to be the leader at the end of the series.

Black Arachnia:
The female heart/voice of the team, so it made the most sense that she would be motivated more by romance than any of the other characters.  Her search for Silverbolt was indeed romantic, and it often took priority over Primal's plans.  I mean, really, in life I have found that most females put ""the plan"" #2 in comparison the needs of herself and her loved ones.  Wether you appreciate that angle or not isn't the case: it is what it is.

Silverbolt:
The knight in shining armor.  The noble, the pure of heart, take-no-bull but slightly naive personality that many people liked.  Justice is blind, wrong is wrong, right is right, black is black, and white is white.  When his love of the then evil Black Arachnia threw his ""black and white"" world in question during Beast Wars, the character fleshed out a little.  Perhaps love was a good reason to bend the rules a bit?  However, he did his best to uphold ""right"" best he could, as ""love"" is stil a ""white"" concept to most.
Now, let's take his body, take his spark, take his sensation of love and snuff it out when it is placed into Jetstorm...what do we have when he is freed from it?  Hate...the extreme ""yang"" to love, the ""black"" he was yet to feel.  His life was essentially taken from him, and there was hell to pay for it.  Now, the world has become even more grey to this character, and bitterness has crept in along with love, and smashed his ""white and black"" world to pieces.  That may be ""one dimensional"" on the surface at the time, but if you look at the character across the span of his existence in the BW/BM continuation, this is indeed a deeper angle.  I for one sympathize with this character, having a simple ""black and white"" view until I served in a war and almost lost bot my life, and the love of my life, to it.  There are sparks of my old ""love is the answer"" personality, but there is also the side of me that understands the world has both love and hate in it, which are both required for survival.  ""There is a time for love, and a time for hate.  There is a time for peace, and a time for war.""

Waspinator:
OK, this one is easy.  Chronic loser (Waspinator) gets the chance to be a general, bad@$$ fighter, with an upgraded body, living out a fantasy, even if he can't remember who he was at first.  Rather than cheer for his newfound prowess and ability, showing some sympathy to the character, people would rather he be the ""victim"" again?  This makes no sense.  I guess ""rags to riches"" or ""zero to hero"" only works for the good guys?  I myself enjoyed Thrust...even when his Waspinator spark was remembered...and because of his new body, you often seen what Waspinator could have been should he have not been a defect.  Poor guy...people only want to see him fail?  Seems that way.

Megatron:
Made a lot of sense this time around, more so than even in his Beast Wars days.  Sure, he took on a ""darker"" role, but perhaps one could argue is that he matured as a mastermind, realizing that his past weaknesses/mode of operation was as much to blame as his old minions were for past failure?  Many of his plans WOULD have succeeded, if not for the miscalculations of his Predacons, or their betrayals, or their inability.  What better way to make completely compliant minions than to strip from them their organic parts...both physically and emotionally...so their only function/ability is to mechanically follow orders?  What better way to ensure that you, as a ruler, keeps order than to strip from yourself the very same, to free yourself from bias and emotion, so that things run with a mechanical efficiency?
One also had to understand that Cybertron had a sentimental meaning to borth the Maximals and Megatron, even more so than Earth.  Megatron was a little less concerned with Earth and its inhabitants, but Cybertron...that was a different matter.  To him, saving Cybertron...the planet, not the population... ""by any means neccesary"" was more important than destroying or saving Earth.

In closing, I think this show was ahead of its time, as was the toyline...hence the natural stigma against it.  Some great things aren't appreciated in their time, and I think this is one of those things.  Hasbro got ahead of themselves somewhat with the toys...if the toys would have been made with today's technology, they would have been more show accurate AND aesthetically pleasing to the general consumer.  I myself am a ""concept"" guy, and could see the ideas behind this show, and that is why I think I can appreciate this series...toyline and show...more than most people.

I give this a 4/5 because it is the highest rating I dare give any show or film...it takes ALOT to push me over to the 5/5.  These ratings are always based on biasness, and I am partial to the ""techno-organic"" and Cybertron modes myself.  To me, there simply aren't enough TF shows that take place on Cybertron enough...in cartoons and fiction, where we can explore the universe or another dimension, why limit ourselves to Earth?  Why not let ourselves escape it from time to time, and in this case, allow Cybertronians to be more Cybertronian?",1385337600,2,14144,4.7223807582551975

The animation is now a bit dated, but it's the intricate and continuing storyline that makes this a set for the discriminating Transformers fans.  Very smart and intelligently written for what would normally be considered a 'kids' show.  Give it a try, you may be pleasantly surprised.",1337472000,,372,5.065573770491803
2415905,5,B000BGH254,"Picking up where Beast Wars left off, Beast Machines finds Optimus Primal and the remaining Maximal team returning to their home planet of Cybertron. There, they discover that the planet is without power. A race of drone machines, known as Vehicons, are on the lookout for them. Megatron is behind the loss of power and the Vehicons. He uses two re-wired Maximals to try & uncover the Key to Vector Sigma, the mega-computer that gave life to all robots, and destroy the Maximals by transforming organic matter into ""technomatter"". That's pretty much where this saga begins.

It's clear, from the get-go, that this series is a bit different than Beast Wars. It's evident because it is serious and darker in its' tone, dealing with more mature subjects than the previous series. I must admit, even though I love Beast Wars, I love this show even more because of the fact that it is more serious and 'grownup' in its' nature. It's a different 'beast', pardon the pun, altogether but a very entertaining one.

If you look at the animation in the series, you'll see that it has come a long way in this series since Beast Wars. I'm glad, too, as the previous series showed how its' CGI was still in its' infancy. Course, CGI has come a long way since this show aired as well..it's pretty clear if you watch the new Transformers show, Transformers Prime.

I'm sure that everyone doesn't share my sentiment but Beast Machines is a show you'll either love or hate in the Transformers mythos. All in all, Transformers Beast Machines isn't an awful series. If you look at it as its' own show- it's actually pretty good.",1318291200,,1608,4.6749116607773855

Though the story is that the Maximals are being pursued at first by mindless tanks, but later on 3 of them get sparks put in them and that's when it starts in for the Maximals.  Although that they'll encounter old foes, along with trying to find out the whole situation, in just 2 seasons and 26 episodes.

Character personalities were inexplicably altered, with one being crippled with cowardice, and another going traitor.

2415921,3,B000BGH254,"It's inevitable that Beast Machines will have comparisons to its predecessor, Beast Wars. This show followed BW and featured the exact same characters, but both shows were very, very different. Upon first viewing of the show, I, like most Beast Wars fans, felt quite alienated due to the major differences.

However, it's been a while since I've seen either Beast Wars or Beast Machines. Since I stopped watching BM after the first few episodes, I decided to go to local video store and give it another chance. Many aspects of Beast Wars had escaped me, so I watched the series with a fresh point of view.

I can say that I actually enjoyed Beast Machines more a second time around. It is a very unique series in the Transformers franchise, with the protagonists starting out as the underdogs against the world rather than fighting an equally matched opposing force. The ideas of transforming were quite different, not to mention the look, the music, and the themes of the show.

After I watched Beast Machines for a second time, I decided to watch Beast Wars again and compare the two. The main thing that bugged me and many other Beast Wars fans were the complete 180 change in the majority of the characters. Optimus Primal was changed from courageous leader to a Zen-like hippie, willing to do whatever it took to save Cybertron, even at the expense of alienating his once-loved Maximals. Bad-Girl Blackarachnia was suddenly transformed into a constantly pining annoyance, Rattrap turned from a mighty warrior into a technicians expert, Rhinox became a traitor, and worst of all, the once chivalrous Silverbolt changed into a completely unbelievable clone of the self-hating Maximal loners Dinobot and Depth Charge, and as a result he lost much of his previous charisma. While some may say that I am simply whining about the characters, what made Beast Wars so enjoyable was watching the characters grow and interact. To see these characters butchered really alienated the original audience.

However, despite this, there were many highlights within Beast Machines. The animation was slick and beautiful, which made the action scenes fun to watch. The techno-driven soundtrack was really an interesting counterpunch to the guitar-based one back in Beast Wars.

And there WERE interesting character arcs within Beast Machines. Cheetor's journey from ""the kid"" to second in command was arguably the next step from his original arc from Beast Wars. The lovingly hostile Jetstorm and the silent loner Thrust were arguably the breakout characters for the show, while the Botannica and Savage/Noble provided unique kinds of Transformers previously unseen in the franchise.

Overall, the series was not that bad. It will always draw criticism from fans of Beast Wars, but it should be watched with the mindset that it is its own series. With that point of view, you have a very enjoyable 26 episodes of good tv.",1217548800,2,2908,5.022821576763485
2415922,5,B000BGH254,"I'm one of the few that really loved this short series.
I totally understand why most didn't like it and preferred the more monotonous (repetitious) BEAST WARS over enlightened BEAST MACHINES.

BEAST MACHINES was one of first great advances in TV CGI. It also tried not to rehash every plot we've seen a million times already. Sure, it had its filler episodes, but over all the intelligence of it's story arch had more depth than 20 other TV kid shows put together.

The spiritual tone offended or missed some, but these are universal memes (ideas, thoughts, and events) that are embedded in all religions and societies throughout history. Light/ Dark; hot/ cold; good/ bad. But really they're just yen an yang.

For me, I love the CG and the well thought out premise of this overlooked refresh of Transformers.",1211328000,2,811,4.820143884892087

2415924,4,B000BGH254,"Beast Wars was enough of a departure from the Transformers mythology, but the show proved to be something special indeed.  Beast Machines picks up where Beast Wars left off, and things take even more of a turn with this series.  Beast Machines picks up with Maximals Optimus Primal, Cheetor, Rattrap, and Black Arachnia on Cybertron and trapped in their original beast forms.  Silverbolt and Rhinox are missing, and none of them have any memory of what happened.  Things are complicated even more so by the fact that they are being hunted by the drone-like Vehicons, who are controlled by Megatron.  As the series develops throughout it's two seasons (both of which are collected here) the Maximals slowly learn the truth behind their comrade's disappearances and what Megatron is planning, while gaining new attack modes, finding new allies, and learning the truth behind Cybertron's history as the barrier between the organic and the mechanical begins to break.  Unlike on Beast Wars, the Maximals don't transform, instead they ""morph"" into their robot modes.  This alone is one of the reasons that Beast Machines never attained the greatness that Beast Wars achieved, along with the convoluted, and a bit confusing, storyline, and the whole ""organic VS mechanical"" storyline just really didn't fit here.  Not to mention that the new robot forms of many of the Maximals (Rattrap comes to mind) just come off as lame.  Still, there's plenty of great twists and turns, spectacularly animated battle sequences, and a downbeat, shocker of an ending to the series that may come as a surprise to longtime viewers of the Beast Wars/Machines saga.  All in all, while Beast Machines never reached what Beast Wars managed to achieve, it's still a more than worthy addition to the Transformers mythos, and needless to say, if you loved Beast Wars, you should give Beast Machines a chance just to see how it all comes to an end.",1198368000,2,1918,4.984326018808777
2415925,4,B000BGH254,"I'm a huge TF fan and have been since their US release in 1984 when i was a little kid.  I grew up with the cartoon show and loved it, so it's hard for any new TF show these days to compare with it since alot of them seem more anime and pokemonish these days.
  In my late teens when Beast wars came out i instantly hated it at first, thinking it was stupid about transforming animals etc.  But by season 3 when it started tying in more with Gen 1 i was hooked, grew fond of all the characters and had to watch Beast wars again from the beginning, and it turned into my 2nd fav TF show.
 Beast Machines continues the story of Beast wars on their homeworld, cybertron.  This seemed like it would be great at first, but this show lacks the great storytelling in Beast Wars, and the new characters are not narly as cool and forgettable.  Megs spends all his time in a cybertroian coocoon type thing sending 3 incomptenet generals (which all look like gobots) and their mindless drones. Optimus turns into a monk in this show, rattrap is utterly destroyed cosmeticaly and looks like a happy meals TF. Cheetor has a major attitude and behaves liek an annoying rebellious teen, Nightscream is a joke, welll you get the point.  There are some good episodes scattered throughout the series, but most of the time the maximals are just running down alleyways or tunnels fleeing vehicons. And the whole concept about cybertron once being organic and the maximals trying to restore nature to cybertron to turn it into a planet like earth was retarded beyond belief, so i consider this TF story a tale of an alternate universe and not my beloved cybertron from 1984.  AAnyway if you're a TF fan its worth owning. I know it sounds like i have ragged on it the whole time, but it has its moments here and there.

And it just overall wasn't nearly as well-written as the first Beast Wars.  Although I do still like the overall message it sends, about finding balance between nature and technology.  Still a good source of entertainment for transformers fans.

I really hope mainframe and hasbro re-make a Beast Wars sequel so they can do it right this time.  Way to fumble the ball on the 1 yard line guys!",1188950400,,564,4.59
2415927,1,B000BGH254,"I very recently, and very luckily happened upon a website containing archived episodes of all the seasons of both BEAST WARS and BEAST MACHINES. As a child, I pretty much grew up watching BEAST WARS, and I thought it was pretty much the coolest show ever.

Going back and watching it again, I was astounded at how GOOD of a show it actually was. Once it got past the initial one-shot adventures of the first couple of episodes, BEAST WARS proved itself time and time again to be capable of immense characterization, plot development and quality, action, innovation, drama, and on more than one occasion brought me close to tears (such as the episode where Dinobot died.)

Unfortunately, BEAST MACHINES absolutely slaughters the good repute of the BEAST WARS series, pretty much by either removing or entirely changing favorable aspects from BW. For instance: All of the Maximals (with the exception of Optimus Primal, who is reduced to a religious zealot) are so glaringly childish, ignorant, and just plain stupid that you want to throw something at the screen. As others have said, the absolute worst example of this is what BM did to Rattrap. In BW, he often provided comic relief for more intense scenes, and was a fairly decent fighter to boot. In this abomination to the Transformers legacy, Rattrap is about as useless as Waspinator, only sans Waspinator's loveable personality, frequent deaths, and aspirations to power. (Waspinator does turn up, albeit as a brainwashed Vehicon General whose spark has been warped by Megatron and turned into a ruthless purple motorcycle...*sigh*)

Unlike BEAST WARS, where Megatron was arguably more of a fan favorite than Optimus Primal, the BEAST MACHINES incarnation of the Predacon commander resorts to horrifically convoluted plotting and spends most of the show's span trying to rid himself of his ""disgusting Beast Mode."" Megatron also no longer speaks to himself when planning against the Maximals, never says ""Yessssss"" anymore, and is only ever seen outside of his Citadel about 2 times, other than when he installs his spark into a gigantic floating head (WTF?) Even worse, the final episode finds Megatron in a new body - that of Optimal Optimus from the third season of BW...enough to make any BW fan cringe.

The only, and I repeat, ONLY saving grace of BEAST MACHINES is that it retains the original voices of the Maximals and Megatron.

In short, in every facet that BEAST WARS succeeded, BEAST MACHINES fails miserably. Whereas BW was a brilliantly produced drama worthy of the original TRANSFORMERS TV show, BEAST MACHINES is a flaccid attempt at continuity of the BW universe, and is insulting to watch, even to small children, which is exactly how I felt when I was 11 watching it.",1187049600,15,2744,4.969498910675381
2415928,5,B000BGH254,"I used to watch Beast Wars and Beast Machines all the time. I had them all on tape, but for some reason, my Beast Machine Tape has been misplaced, so when I saw the opportunity to buy it here, I was overjoyed.

Beast Machines is not for everyone; I know a lot of people who loved Beast Wars were disappointed how Beast Machines turned out. I don't blame them -- only the original characters were not ""out of character"" {which is obviously because they were new}, so this discourages many Beast Wars fans. Me, however, I approached the series as if it were something separate and connected, and I liked the characters a lot, so I had fun teasing out what was wrong with them.

What I like about Beast Machines is the humanistic issues it tackles within the series. Nature versus Machine, how both sides are equally dangerous. Freedom versus Tyranny: The dangers of individual thought and free will versus the enslavement and emptiness felt by a despotic rule. The problems about running as an individual and dangers one can face when he has friends and teammates on the line. Prejudice, betrayal, being too trusting and not trusting enough and how friends can turn against each other, even unintentionally. The more I watch the series, the more I can find in it.

Although many of these issues are lost to little kids, and older ones don't care for how many of the characters appear in this series, it still remains to be one of my favourites and I think you just need to give it a chance. I didn't at first, but after I caught a few sporadic episodes on tv, I couldn't stop watching.

As far as product, regarding the DVD format, what better way to enjoy the 26 episodes than in this elaborately designed 4 disc box? I love the graphics on the box and discs. Oh, the menu opening is intriguing and fit to the series, not to mention the action at pressing the ""Play All"" option is hilarious and well done. Curious?

Watching it again years later, I realized that BM is actually a really good and insightful show. True, it's much darker than G1 and beast Wars, but that's what gives it depth. None of the characters are perfect, but again their flaws make them worth watching. Cheetor, who I didn't care for at all in BW, has grown up to be a likable character and a decent second-in-command. I especially liked that Optimus was no longer the perfect leader and that while the other Maximals respected him, they thought for themselves. The only thing I was sad to see (as I read many fans were) was the loss of Silverbolt's former charm. I do miss him as a white knight type.

BM isn't pure action-adventure like G1 and BW were. It still has those elements, but it's also more higher-plane, with Optimus being more soul-searching and thoughtful than before (sometimes to the chagrin of his teammates).

Megatron strapped securely to the (outside) of the Autobot escape shuttle, and everyone - plus or minus Transmetal and so forth forms - heading back home for good. The ending, with Dinobot 2 and the well-handled wrapup was great.

Then they included this. I remember watching the series as a kid, and not quite having it 'add up' with the rest of Transformers as a whole.

Well, it still stands. The fact is the techno-organic dribble that's put out in the series doesn't quite 'fit'. It never has, and probably never will. The pseudo-spiritual message constantly conveyed seems as though someone tried to write a sci-fi cartoon and ended up with the Transformers lisence - the resulting glue never really took enough hold to be 'okay.'

But having said thus, the series is worth seeing again. Optimus Primal's character is still as noble and heroic as ever, mixed in with his constant effort for peace and new mystery prophet overlay, and he is still Optimus.

Cheetor has matured over Beast Wars, and we all know it. Now, he's a young adult, second-in-command, and as fiercely heroic as ever. His immaturity slowly falls from his body, leaving him better than before.

Blackarachnia's still as cynical but as get-things-done as ever. The same goes for Rattrap, and the two share a much more profound connection than was displayed in Beast Wars Season 3.

Spoilers!-

The later addition of new characters - Nightscream and Botanica - was rather well-played. Botanica's plant-based transforming body has always been unusual, but she was still a well-played character. Nightscream easily slipped into the immature-but-powerful role Cheetor left behind, and he fills the role well.

Silverbolt's return caused me some dismay. His character, once noble and fiercely chivalrous, now is the same brittle, hate-driven revenge-seeker as Depth Charge. It was supposed to be badass - and I must admit, it was rather cool seeing him flip out and throw explosive feathers in all directions - but given the options between the two, I missed the corny lines of Beast Wars Silverbolt. I was glad to see his ever-hilarious attitude return at the end of the series of Beast Machines. His attitude in Beast Machines playes more like the ronin from japanese culture - indeed, his robot mode features a topknot and a oriental goatee, as well as asian eyelids.

All in all, Beast Wars is hard to improve off of, but I think that the lack of Larry Foreward and Bob DiTillo truly hurt Beast Machines. However, it's still a worthy purchase for all, with the exception of the die-hard purist Transformers fan.",1149552000,3,2641,4.91685393258427

I loved the dark aspect to it (sort of a Batman meets Matrix thing). The story was great and well thought out, and Silverbolt has to be one of my new favorites (just something about that samurai look that I find way cool).

I'm not going to go into too many details on the plot, as others have already done that, but if you didn't like Beast Wars and dislike a fundamental change in the Transformers Universe, then you probably won't like this. However, if you were into Beast Wars you'll be awed at the improved animation and more adult storyline.

2415943,4,B000BGH254,"In 1996, about 12 years after the premiere of the original Transformers series (G1), America was introduced to a computer-animated sequel to this series, known as Beast Wars Transformers, which quickly gave something for the old TransFans to enjoy.

A few months after Beast Wars ended, FOX introduced to us a new series meant to take place right after Beast Wars known as Beast Machines Transformers. And according to the search that I have had on Transformers websites, the majority of the TransFan community actually HATES this series.

I am one of those people who likes this series. This is my review. (Warning: Do not read this if you want the series to be a true surprise. I will hint at some major plot points in this review.)

Beast Machines is assumed to take place right after the end of ""Nemesis, Pt. 2"", but Optimus Primal, in his Season 1 beast mode, finds himself being chased by fleets of hostile, mindless tank-like Transformers. As he finds out he cannot transform, he starts running and eventually finds Rattrap, Cheetor, and Blackarachnia, also unable to transform.

Optimus then realizes that a super-computer known as the Oracle has guided him to find his comrades and helps him lead the others to the deepest reaches of Cybertron, leading them to the Oracle itself. It shows Primal that a great transformation awaits, and in order to save the Maximals from the virus they are experiencing, the Oracle reformats them into new ""techno-organic"" bodies.

Primal and the others soon realize that these mindless Vehicons are the only inhabitants of the planet now, and Megatron himself is in control. Because of this, Optimus feels a great deal of guilt throughout the series, seeing how this dark age of the planet seems to be his fault.

Optimus now has a great connection to the Oracle, giving him visions at what their mission is, but as the visions become clouded and corrupted, he is put to the ultimate test as he discovers that the Maximals' mission is to bring a balance to Cybertron between the organic and the technological.

That's pretty much a brief summary of the series. Now...

What I like about the series:

1. The spiritual theme and the many balances to achieve were

  actually interesting to me.

2. The psychological character changes seem to make sense, even

  if they are a little rushed.

3. The physical changes are nice as well, showing off a much

  more sci-fi look to the Maximals, instead of being basic

  robot designs.

4. Megatron's megalomania reaches an all-new level in this

  series. If you thought he was insane when he had the

  Nemesis, just you wait!

What I dislike about the series:

1. The occasional misinterpreted continuity between this series

  and its two prequels. (Example: Megatron saying that there

  were only 4 million years of Transformers civilization; there

  were at least 6 million years.)

2. The short lives of Obisidian and Stryka. (Even though they

  don't actually die, they only last six episodes.)

The epic feel of this show is addictive to me, and I hope it will to some of you now that you have read this review.

Every aspect of this series can be described in one word:  Rich.  The story is edgier, deeper, darker, and more profound.  The animation is eye-popping, fluid, and downright beautiful.  I LOVED the new look that my favorite characters got.

""But they don't look anything like robots.""

That's because they're ""technorganic"":  a mix of mechanical and biological.  They're kind of like androids now; they're more human.  And they can show more emotion in a series that is emotionally charged.

""It's too dark and it's not funny.""

When was war ever funny?  Our beloved Transformers have grown up and, in case you haven't noticed, so have we. Life can be dark.  War happens.  Tragedy happens.  People die.  The world is not candy-coated and laa-dee-daa.

I'd recommend this for any sci-fi fan who enjoys a deep and well developed plot and cutting edge CGI animation, or just any Transformers fan.  Unless you're one of these pacifier sucking, close-minded purists who gave this kick-ass series 2 stars or less.",1142380800,8,1172,4.877551020408164

2415947,5,B000BGH254,"I could tell from the first episode when it first aired that this would be very different from both G1 and BW, which I and countless others had grown up watching, and cherished. The series as a whole touched home for me on many levels; I got and understood instantly what was trying to be said and done with the series, especially messages being sent concerning Primal and Rhinox. What really surprised me was the uses of the word ""genocide"" and ""fanatasism"" among others. Even more so were lines such as ""No planet is alive, Optimus; merely INFESTED, and I intend to restore it to its natural condition"". And ""The seeds of YOUR future lie in RUINS.""

I still find it difficult to fully accept how DARK and DIFFERENT this show is. Ultimately, I feel that the series as a whole is a CRITICAL story that had to be told. There are very obvious references to what happened during WW2 concerning the 'maximal shell yards' as they're called during ""Revelations Part 1 and 2"", another name for the concentration camps. I experienced utter shock at what was exposed in those episodes, and the shock hasn't completely subsided. Then there is Primal's ""shock revelation"" during ""Fallout"", another storyline that is minutely ever seen on ""kids"" networks. A cool G1 reference that I haven't seen anyone else mention is from ""Endgame 3"", right after Primal says ""Say farewell to arms, Megatron."" He just stands in the background of the fire, missing half of his left arm down from the elbow. In the G1 episode ""Dark Awakening"", Zombie Optimus' arm pops off while he's trying to fight Hotrod.

I can easily understand and accept all the inherent ""problems"" this show had; I was one of them for a while. One thing I tell people who are always shocked by my description of the series, is that this is, for all intents and purposes, is a CGI/sci-fi version of Schindler's List. I studied WW2 as a requirement in junior high, and the connections are unmistakeable between the that time period and what happened during the course of this show. There is even an obvious connection between Megatron and Hitler. They both wanted to eradicate a part of themselves in others that they couldn't face in themselves: Hitler's particular religion he was born into, and Megatron wanted to eradicate his Beast Mode, something he clearly shared with his enemies.

I am very glad I decided to get this on DVD; it's too important a story to not view and learn from. Most of the episodes were written by the head writers of the Fox Kids X-Men show from the 1990s, and that series has tons of references to WW2 and other issues throughout the series. It's no surprise that the writers incorporated those elements and amplified them.

I highly recommend this series.",1142294400,55,2730,4.716981132075472
2415948,5,B000BGH254,"I'm a Transformers fan going all the way back to the early 80's. I was also a fan so fanatical that I never even wanted to discuss Beast Wars while it was airing. I saw the whole notion of Beast Wars as an illegitimate child trying to barge in on the legacy of the one true Transformer series.

Luckily a fellow fan changed my mind and I gave Beast Wars a chance when it came out on DVD. I loved it so much that I wanted more.

I was hesitant to buy Beast Machines due to a lot of negative feedback it received from fans of the original series just like me. I heard it didn't follow cannon, animation was good but the story was terrible and everyone did things that were out of character. However, remembering how I originally felt about Beast Wars, I decided to get Machines regardless.

I was not disappointed. It is close enough to the original cannon that as a fan of the 80's series, I can appreciate this as a continuation of what I'd come to love.  At the same time it's original enough that you don't really need to have seen what came before to enjoy this show. It helps to have seen previous shows. It makes the experience fuller, but it's hardly necessary.

This is by far the darkest Transformer series out there. But it's also that darkness, that seriousness, which lends Beast Machines its credibility.

Recent cartoon series I've seen, both Transformer and otherwise, are usually cookie cutter ""let's go out and beat the bad guy because we're the good guys and that's what we're supposed to do"" story lines. Here you know what the stakes are and you know it's serious.  It's a deepness of story telling that's missing in a lot of today's television.

The only cringe I have with this series is the techno dance pop music that gets rather incessant throughout the series. Barring that, I'd have to place this as the last great Transformer series that was made.",1142208000,6,1874,4.45906432748538
2415949,4,B000BGH254,"Ok, first off:  this ain't Beast Wars.  To paraphrase Megatron, the Beast Wars are over and the Maximals lost.  Badly.  After watching the first few episodes for the first time in years, I am now hooked more than I was when the series first aired.

The first thing I realized (or remembered) is how much this series was influenced by The Matrix.  Take the first Matrix movie and substitute Optimus and crew for Neo, Morpheus and the gang, and you get Beast Machines.  The tech designs, the music, the fight scenes, the ""free your mind and transform"" bit are all lifted directly from The Matrix.

This is the darkest Transformers series ever.  As in Beast Wars, there are no humans around to make things goofy.  The situation is serious and Megatron has gone from stereotypical bad guy to a genocidal maniac who is not trying to rule the world - he already does.

The series does have it's problems, or at least things that I don't agree with.  First off, the Transformers no longer transform, per se, it's more like morphing.  Second was the controversial decisions made with some beloved characters (I won't spoil it but for those who've seen this show you know what I'm talking about).  Third is the character designs.  I understand what they were trying to do, but they just don't look like Transformers to me.

Beast Machines isn't as good as Beast Wars but it's not as bad as I remember either.  I was initially on the fence about this set, but now I'm very happy I purchased it and I can't wait to finish it.",1141171200,5,1514,4.527675276752768

The evil Megatron seeks to destroy the Maximals because... um, I think because their animation and robot-forms suddenly look like crap. He's also really angry and wants to take over all of Cybertron because any sense of continuity the planet or series once had got really messed up by bad writers that couldn't live up to Larry DiTillio and Bob Forward. That's right, jettison the guys who helped make Babylon 5 memorable, get some cheap hacks, and stretch a 3-episode story stretch over two seasons. THERE's a recipe for success. I have no illusion the old G1 stuff was Shakespeare, and Beast Wars was no Tolkien epic, but this was a sad swan song.",1140652800,12,802,4.695035460992908
2415951,4,B000BGH254,"While Beast Machines was not as Good as Beast Wars, it's still a good series and better than a lot of people are giving it credit for.  Beast Wars was pretty big shoes to fill.  After years of no new transformers animation, Beast Wars came out of nowhere to be a bigger hit than anyone ever expected.  It was able to capture even the support of original Transformers fans by making a strong connection to that original series and even having a few G1 transformers show up.

Beast machines is decidedly darker and grittier than Beast Wars.  Here the Maximals find themselves back on Cyberton (somehow) and further they are locked into their beastmodes, and also suffering amnesia.  To make matters worse they're pursued by an army of tank drones who attack relentlessly.  Thus would begin the running theme of the Maximals on the run and trying to find out what exactly happened to their homeworld.  Throughout they encounter old friends and enemies and old friends in new guises as they eventually learn to transform (or perhaps morph is the better word).

I consider Beast Machines a very good entry in Transformers lore and continuity.  Yes some changes were made to character's personalities but it fit perfectly well with the whole plot of the new show.  All 26 epsisodes are included and I'm really happy they put out the entire series in one boxed set.

Great show, passable animation.  I dug on how the G1 characters were still referenced, making the show canon with what I was familiar with.  Then I saw Beast Machines!  This is what I had been waiting on; a well written plot driven story line.  Having a cherished character (Rhinox) become a bad guy, brilliant!  The really sinister manipulation of our heroes.  Stunning animation.  My biggest problem was that I wanted more.  The current crop of Transformers shows are simply painful to watch.

2415953,1,B000BGH254,"First off, I was a fan of the original Transformers series.  I saw them right up till it ended suddenly during the ""Headmasters"" introduction.

Then came BEAST WARS.  This brought back all the love I had for the original series, and kicked it up a level.  Took me a while to adjust to CGI, but the brilliant writing kept me coming back week after week - for all three seasons.

Then came BEAST MACHINES.

They took the characters I came to know and love from BEAST WARS, and butchered them beyond recognicion.  Lovely eye candy, but the writing was horrible.  It kinda took what Transformers was all about, and crumpled it up into a little ball - then tossed it in the trash.  The characters became NOTHING like what became established in BEAST WARS.  Okay, I can understand you want to have characters grow and change, but when you take the most loyal and intelligent of them, and make him become one of the big bad guys (for no *real* good reason and a pi$$ poor explaination), you've lost me.  It's like taking Trek's ""Scotty"", and making him suddenly turn into the evil ""miracle worker"" batting for the other team to destroy the good guys.  Doesn't work.  BEAST WARS had a serious storyline that would use humour to break up the dark tones.  Rat Trap was the comic relief character.  It worked great.  In BEAST MACHINES, he's a real jerk. There IS NO COMIC RELIEF.  It's all dark, all the time.  Some call that ""intelligent writing"".  I call it a sure fire way to end a series that could have been great.

And considering it only lasted ONE season (as opposed to the THREE that BEAST WARS had), I was right.  The characters I came to know and love died a horrible death (figuratively) in the first episode of this new series. I kept watching - blindly hoping that it would redeem itself and show me a glimmer or (pardon the pun) a ""spark"" of the original versions of these characters.  But it was not to be.

Bottom line, RENT IT first.  If you find you like it, THEN drop the cash.  Personally, I think it's one of the worst story arc's in Transformer history.",1140480000,9,2065,4.442666666666667

Instead, the took their chances on a profound, complex storyline and ambitious character arcs.  As with any risks, there are the possibilities of mistakes -- and this series has some.  Some of the character changes are too extreme (Rattrap comes to mind) and some of the storylines are almost too esoteric (the Noble/Savage storyline, for example.  It's phenominal, but it really takes what it means to be a ""Transformer"" to an all new level).  The successes, though, far outweigh any missteps.  And the ultimate message of the series -- balance between technology and organics -- not only pre-dates Matrix Revolutions, but is also done in a far more immediate and effective way.

2415955,5,B000BGH254,"SOME SPOILERS IN PARAGRAPH 3

Beast Machines is really a very good show, however, it's something I would not recommend for children.  I saw this as a kid and I remember hating it.  Seeing it again as a 28 year old adult, I am extremely pleased with it.  There are  story lines and themes that children just cannot understand.

Beast Wars is my all time favorite show and has been for many, many years.  The story, characters, animation, humor, and swashbuckling action were great in that show.  The episode ""Code of Hero"" is perhaps the greatest episode in Transformers history.  Beast machines took the ending of Beast Wars and  brought our characters back to Cybertron.  This show is EXTREMELY dark and disturbing.  It deals with death, or even more so, genocide.  It deals with isolation, fear, guilt, oppression, and slavery.

You know how the Ninja Turtles are?  You know how the Avengers are?  You know how the X-Men are?  You know how Batman is?  You know how Superman is?  You know how every other kids show is on TV?  They all follow the same formula.  Beast Machines is NOTHING like those shows.  I see many reviews here complaining about the characters, but you have to put yourself in these character's shoes.  What would you do if earth was pretty much destroyed and all of the humans had their minds enslaved and you were one of these characters in a small group of people.  You have to go very deep into all of these characters minds, you struggle with them, you feel their pain.  When Optimus Primal  deals with the guilt of losing the Beast Wars and seeing the destruction of the millions (billions?) of lives on Cybertron, you deal with the guilt with him.  When Rattrap realizes he has a robot mode with no weapons and feels useless, you feel useless with him.  When Cheetor struggles with the question of whether or not Optimus Primal (like his father figure) is leading the Maximals down the wrong path, you struggle with him.  When Blackarachnia tries so very desperately to bring Silverbolt back, you feel her pain every step of the way.  When Silverbolt breaks out of his slavery from Megatron and struggles with the very deep questions of whether or not he wanted to be freed, or if he even wants to life out his existence, you are right there with him.  When Rhinox is freed from his slavery and willingly decides to turn his back on the Maximals, you have to put yourself in his shoes and look at things from his perspective.  When Nightscream acts like a child and whimpers annoyingly for most of his screen time, you have to think about what an average teenager would do in his circumstances.  He's the only Cybertronian who was there to witness all the horrors, and from every choice he could have made, he chose to save himself instead of help others, and that's something he deals with by lashing out on others.

So in short, this show is dark, depressing, and sad.  That's how life is sometimes, you can't always be happy.  Serious things in life usually aren't happy, but they must be dealt with.  After you finish this show, you will think about things in a different perspective.  I thoroughly enjoyed this show and highly recommend it to adult viewers.",1140048000,4,3189,4.618538324420677

Whilst there is a lot in the show for younger views to enjoy, the real geneius of Beast Machines is how it draws on the mythology's of the original Generation 1 programme.

It may not have the humour that was present in Beast Wars, but what it lacks there it makes up by making you feel that the whole story is trully rooted in the past that you watched as a child 20 odd years ago.

They essentually took all the surviving characters from BW, threw ripped them to peices, then let blind monkeys put them back together. Primal went from a proud leader to a reglious (they're twisted veiw of it anyways) crackpot. Rhinox they amde from a powerful wise character to a homocidal maniac, and worst of all, they RUINED RATTRAP! I don't care WHAT their excuse was, Rattrap was a wisecracking fun loving rodent in BW, but in BM he became a sniveling, crying WEAK pansy. And what was with the wheels? Seriously that was just rediculous. Megatrons plans weren't all that interesting, they lost his flair, his spark. In BW, he was conniving, devious, and treacherous.

All of the japanese transformers don't even come close to compare. Beast Machines on the other hand was done with a more creative story line, it was also more serious and the characters that we have all come to love, and like us have all matured.

I loved the show so much that I bought a poor copy off Ebay, because I had thought that they were not going to release this set on DVD, but hey they did, and I sold that copy as soon as I found out the official DVD was being released.

Bob Forward and Larry DiTillio really did their homework (or just made alot of lucky guesses) when writing stories that crossed generations.  Bob Skir and Marty Isenberg did a very bad job of connecting the generations and just made alot of jibberish nonsense in Beast Machines.  Half of each episode was spent running away from the Vehicon Drones while Optimus Primal was spending about half of his screentime communing with the Oracle.  As a huge G1 fan, the references that they through in could have been good such as the Vector Sigma computer and the plasma energy chamber and especially some of the extra guys that were spotted in a few episodes that ""looked"" like G1 characters but were not......but the stories they wrote around those references were god-awful.  And when the end of the series came about and Cybertron ended up being organic, that was completely ridiculous and basically destroys all previous legacy of Transformers.

The Maximals are now fugitives and must seek out and master new 'technorganic' bodies in order to defeat Megatron once and for all. The animation in this series was vastly superior to Beast Wars and lacked the corny humor that was so prominant in that series. The story was dark with many twists and turns, and revisits not only story elements introduced on Beast Wars but many from the original Transformers series as well, gelling the three into a solid continuity. Character development is strong here, wheather it be Rat Trap dealing with his new, ""useless"" body, Silverbolt turning from chivalrous to brooding or the fate of a beloved character, all are handeled well. Is it better than the original Transformers or even Beast Wars? That's a matter of opinion.

The first being that it was aired on FOX. FOX had several rules for it's 'kids' shows, they didn't allow projectile weapons or characters losing limbs or being decapitated. Beast Wars was sold right into syndication so it was able to do things like that. Another thing that was not allowed was deaths, including heroic deaths, Beast Wars had both of these. Now as for the animation I can see why some people didn't like it. I wasn't that fond of it myself, but it is good. The transformation sequences were very different, it seemed like they morphed rather than transformed. One thing I really didn't like was the directions that they took some of the characters. Cheetor became the second in command and Rattrap, one of my favorite characters from Beast Wars, became a bumbling idiot. Also this show contained politically correct elements (technology vs Nature). Also, at times it seemed to borrow very heavily from ""The Terminator"" and ""The Matrix"". Aside from that it introduced some engaging storylines. It isn't really a self-contained show, to properly enjoy it you might want to watch Beast Wars, some of the episodes contain very detailed references and flash-backs to Beast Wars, and sometimes even Generation 1 Transformers. The new characters introduced range from OK to really good. The plot-lines were very deep and emotional with what was occasionally intense material. I'm glad that I can own the whole show on one set.

Anyway, just saying that since we grew up with the original and wouldn't like anything else really isn't fair.  Now granted, I haven't been a big fan of what I have seen from Robots in Disguise, Armada and Energon, although I have not watched the new Cybertron show as of yet.

The biggest reason I don't like most of those shows can be split into 2 parts.

#1 - I'm not a big fan of Pokemon style anime.  When I see a human being in a cartoon for example, I don't like seeing huge bug eyes and big spikey hair.  It's not limited to Transformers, I can't watch 90% of the shows on Cartoon network for that reason.

#2 - I like some sort of contuinity.  Each show will have its own take on things, but watching some of these new shows is rather confusing.  Okay, so Optimus Prime is a big red truck and he's the leader of the Autobots...but wait, he isn't your Optimus Prime, no this one is kinda like him but different, he's from an alternate universe and Ironhide, Prowl, Perceptor, Jetfire, Starscream, Thundercracker, Skywarp...those aren't the same ones either.  But there is a Cybertron, a Unicron, Decepticons, Quinetssons...but different ones.  Huh?

Having said all that, I was a real big fan of the Beast Wars series.  They had some of the best storylines for any kind of show, period.  They did an excellent job of creating the characters and evovling the story.  They also tied the show directly to the original Transformers line in realistic ways that didn't damage the previous legacy and/or inhibit the Beast Wars one.  I know some people didn't like the 3-D animation and it was a stretch at first for me, also.  However, after you sit through 2-3 shows it seems very natural.

Having said that, the Beast Machines series just doesn't quite measure up.  The writing is inferior in my opinion and the characters do a lot of things that don't make sense, especially the ones carried over from the Beast Wars shows.  I remember watching it and thinking it was written by a doped up enviromentalist hippie but that's just my personal take.

Taking place shortly after the Beast Wars finale, things have gone VERY wrong for the Maximals.  They return to Cybertron only to find the entire planet turned against them, and no allies in sight.  They've lost the ability to transform, and most of their friends (and all of their enemies) seem to have vanished.  Eventually, Optimus, Rattrap, Cheetor, and Black Arachnia learn the truth--Megatron escaped his captivity, took control of Cybertron, and unleashed a virus that systematically wiped out all of the transformers on the planet.  Their only means of survival is to find a new way to transform, becoming ""organics"" and eventually being tasked with returning Cybertron to it's original, organic state.  New allies and enemies are introduced, and a lot of long-lost secrets are revealed.  There are references back to the original Transformers series, however vague, and a whole new fight for survival.

I've heard a lot of complaints about this series, but personally, it's one of my favorites.  Don't get me wrong--Beast Wars was incredible, and did some amazing things with the Transformers mythos.  I just thought this series did a great job of taking that mythos in a new direction, and lead to a new way of looking at the Transformers line as a whole.  Just like Beast Wars took some Transformer pre-conceptions and played with them a bit, this one just goes a step further and turns them on their head--what if the Transformers weren't ALWAYS machines?

The animation in this series, to me, was great.  While the backgrounds and some characters (particularly the vehicons) may appear a little ""static"" and poorly animated, the main characters and the action scenes MORE than make up for that.  The animation for the Maximals shows more emotion and liveliness than it ever did in Beast Wars.  But perhaps best of all was the story--it takes a few episodes to really get going, but once it does, it never really stops.  By the middle of the second season, the story moves so fast you really have to pay good attention to keep up.  The twists and the revelations this series throws at viewers is really a lot of fun, and it's nice to see a ""kid's"" show really deal with some more mature themes and concepts without pandering to it's audience.

For my money, this series makes a great compliment to Beast Wars, if you're willing to have a few of your pre-conceptions and beliefs twisted or outright reversed.  It's the sign of good fiction, to be able to take what you think you know and turn it into something entirely new.  I'm not much for extras on DVD sets for TV series, so I feel comfortable rating this five stars in advance without having seen the discs yet.

Go ahead, take a chance--you might be surprised at how much you'd like it.",1127260800,12,3116,4.727777777777778
2415977,4,B000BGH254,"It's great that this show is finally coming out on DVD. It begins right after the end of Beast Wars, and everything is a mess. The Maximals are back on Cybertron, they're trapped in beast mode, can't transform and there are tons of robot tanks, bikes and jets after them! They don't know what's going on, how they got there or where their friends are, they just know they have to survive. But Optimus is receiving strange messages from ""The Oracle"", and after they find it, they find out Megatron has taken over Cyberton and killed every transformer there ever was! Now, reformatted by the Oracle, the Maximals need to adapt to their new biomechanic bodies, learn to transform and try to stop Megatron before he absorbs the sparks of all cybertronians!

This series takes some getting used to. You obviously go in expecting more Beast Wars, and that's not exactly what you get. The characters have evolved. Optimus is like a sensei, Cheetor has matured, Black Arachnia is all Maximal, but misses Silverbolt. The biggest changes were inflicted in Ratrap and Rhinox, though. I won't say what happened to Rhinox, it's a huge spoiler to those who haven't seen the series. But I was initially incredibly disappoited with Ratrap, and that's what made me turn away from this at first. His design was radically changed, and they messed with this character to a point where, in an episode, he betrays his friends. After I got kinda used to his new looks, I gave the show another chance, and was not disappointed.

Would more Beast Wars have been better? Sure! But this is Beast Wars 2, it's a sequel, the series evolved. Give it a chance. If you really care for these charaxcters, you won't be disappointed. THey're still your old friends, they just grew up... and changed clothes. ;)",1127174400,17,1775,4.72258064516129
2415978,5,B000BGH254,"Okay, no it's not crappy animation, and no there are no clicks and pops when they transform, but don't you for a second turn a cold shoulder to the Beast Machines series.  This series turns the Maximals victory in Beast Wars against them, and gives Megatron the means to destroy the maximals once and for all.  The entire show has increadible animation via Mainframe, and awesome voice actors, cream of the crop in the animation world in my opinion.  The show produces thick plot-lines, and is very well written, and animated.  Old trans fans and antaganist critics shut your mouth, and watch with an open mind, you might enjoy yourself!  To all my new new school trans fans, thank the matrix because now we can complete our new blood transformers dvd collection, so thanks go out to Rhyno for giving us Beast Wars, and now giving us Beast Machines.  I'm gonna go turn off my tv because Transformers Cybertron is coming on now, so I'm gonna watch Beast Wars until my copy of Beast Machines arrives",1127001600,8,997,4.636363636363637
