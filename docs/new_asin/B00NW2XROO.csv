8680563,1,B00NW2XROO,"I don't like people watching me while I workout, or even thinking that someone might be watching me while I workout, it's one of my self esteem issues that come with being Obese. BUT I have been working out with DVDs for a while (down 11 pounds, woohoo!) because I have a large collection of them. If only the physical act of owning a DVD would make me skinny, you actually have to do it. So I cracked this one open today.

With very little explanation of any of the movements in the routines, the trainer leads you through two frantic workouts that seem to have been created moments before filming started, and apparently they could only do one take. At a few points during the ""bootcamp"" the 'instructions' don't even match the movements at all. There are cut aways with no warning (pan away, blackness, pan back) and when they show the two on screen they're doing something completely different (like "" do this shuffle, shuffle hop with me!"" *cut away* ""keep jumping rope!!"")
At least twice both women were so confused that they were both doing the wrong thing in opposite directions, when they self correct she says ""well as long as you're moving!""

your cool down? a 10 second laying quadriceps stretch on one leg.

Don't buy this one, there are SO many good workout DVDs that you can do instead",1437004800,,1381,4.542168674698795
