6332627,4,B00J49R1G4,very good shows... a lot parts are unanswered questions however I'm hoping there will be other season of it. It is pretty unique and different than usual fantasy anime. It is well made anime. I like the characters develops and I also like a idea how they develop the storylines.,1410393600,2,278,4.58

6332630,1,B00J49R1G4,"Glancing at the trailer I thought this anime would be epic but it's boring at best. The storyline had major potential. However, it failed to deliver. The protagonist encounters these random individuals and kills them because it is just. They never explained the origins or purpose behind the organization he works for either. The music was terrible and failed to capture any emotion. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.",1406505600,5,420,5.101449275362318

6332633,4,B00J49R1G4,"OR MAYBE EVERYONE JUST NEEDS A HUG! (a reference to a couple moments in the show)

Excellent animation and an engaging story make this an interesting anime to watch, though it might not quite reach classic status.

Sakura is the most popular girl at school and seems to be special in just about every way.  Everyone at school wants her or wants to be her.  One night she is attacked by local gang members and witnesses a kind of supernatural execution as a boy with blue flame intervenes to save her.  This event brings her into the orbit of Ogami, part of a secret order called Code Breakers.  Sakura realizes that he was intervening on her behalf, but also realizes that he is a killer.  These Code Breakers are sort of avenging angels who destroy evil people to protect the innocent.  Ogami joins Sakura's school in order to watch her and ensure that she does not reveal his secret.  Conversely, Sakura develops a wary relationship with Ogami so that she can somehow stop his destruction, preaching that it is not necessary to kill to stop evil.

Ogami fully accepts that the nature of his role makes him as evil as those he destroys.  He can be evil and threatening, even to Sakura as their relationship advances.  But, Sakura (as the ultimate good), sees something redeemable in Ogami's character.  Numerous other Code Breakers with different powers are introduced.  A greater conflict emerges as the controlling organization called Eden is revealed along with how the Code Breakers are developed.  Furthermore Eden has enemies, including a rogue Code Breaker called Hitomi who was formerly the leader of the Code Breakers and the most virtuous of them all.  Sakura also seems to have some special power and it is revealed that she is something called a ""Rare Breed"".  Who is Eden?  What is the Rare Breed's role in this struggle of good vs. evil vs. really evil?  What could possibly cause Hitomi to go rogue?

Generally all the questions are answered and the story is engaging.  However, there are many story tangents that are left hanging and not all the attributes of the major characters are explained.  This is not uncommon in Anime of course.  But I did feel it held this story back from being something greater.  As usual, there is a high school setting and everyone gets a little bent out of shape when it appears Sakura is off-the-market because of her relationship with Ogami.  There some exaggerated high school dramas that are silly and out of character for the darker subject matter.  I am not saying that Anime doesn't often get silly.  But, in this case it didn't seem complimentary to the story.  I suspect it was included to juxtapose the triviality of high school worries compared to the life and death struggles going on outside.  There is no fan service in this show.  However, there were a few breast grabbing moments that also seemed a little out of place.  I am not saying I don't appreciate fan service as I own shows like Ikki Tousen.  The moments were just a little comedy relief in this case.

I do recommend this show and some may connect more closely than I did.  I suggest trying it as a rental or download somewhere before you buy.",1404172800,31,3168,4.669077757685352

Thougth Episodes With No Spoilers
I over all the quality of the episodes
I think if you watch it in blu ray it will look amazing

Characters
This one is very important for me that each character don't have much of a good personality because it's really hard to judge on their appearance and how they look or how they act tell you that honesty characters act random in time basically you have to figure out the character if code breaker had season 2 then characters have more screen time knowing what kind of purpose that they had for being coming a code breaker to fill in the gap.",1428192000,,843,4.461038961038961

Its short and gives a lot of storyline that suggest there could be more seasons to follow but for now the show ends with most of the questions being answered.

The dub is good and like I said, other than being short its a good anime to have. Needs a 2nd season.",1424995200,,439,4.116279069767442

6332684,3,B00J49R1G4,"Not complaints about the actual box set, but the show wasn't exactly impressive. With only thirteen episodes ""Code Breaker"" manages to give you a solid story that actually is concluded by the end, but the entire show feels a little rehashed. Like many other anime, the main villain is an ex-good guy who believes he has been wronged and the protagonists are have strange powers and are part of a secret government sanctioned assassin team. One thing that ""Code Breaker"", does differently is that is doesn't try to justify the character's actions as justice, or pass them off as the right thing which I found very refreshing. Overall, it's a decent series that I would recommend maybe watching online before purchasing the set to see if you really like it. Also, i would suggest watching it subbed since the dubbed version has quite a bit of coarse language in it, especially for a TV-14 show.",1419897600,7,892,4.7612903225806456

6332686,5,B00J49R1G4,Good series and the story line is great. Love the Blu-ray /DVD combo.,1419897600,,69,4.384615384615385
6332687,3,B00J49R1G4,"The tagline for this anime brings to mind gruesome moral dilemmas and criminals brought to justice using questionable methods a la TV's Dexter. While this is how the show operates on the surface, the remainder of the show revolves around a dull villain with excessive screentime devoted to his paper-thin personality and history.

The other Code: Breakers do have their own personalities, to the show's credit. It would have been better if three or four episodes were tacked on to the show's length (currently a mini-season of 13 episodes) and used to flesh out the other independent hitmen. Of course, original superpowers would be a bonus, but the creators couldn't be bothered with that.

Add to this mess one of the dullest and most irritating heroines and you get something that's better off omitted unless you're completely bored and need something to fill a weekend.",1418083200,,873,5.0137931034482754

8647934,3,B00J49R1G4,"Plot: Riding the bus one day, Sakura Sakurakji looks out the window to see people being burned alive with a blue fire as a boy her age remains unharmed and stands over the people. When she goes back to the site the next day, there are no corpses or evidence of any kind of murder, just a small fire. When Sakura goes to class, she discovers the new transfer student is the same boy she saw the day before. Sakura soon learns that he is Rei gami, the sixth ""Code: Breaker,"" a special type of assassin with a strange ability and a member of a secret organization that serves the government.

My Review:
The concept behind this plot is good. For a short anime, it has some good character development for 13 episodes.
However, the anime focused the first 4-5 episodes (some parts in the later ones)on the main character's (Sakura) redundant naive perspective of people to the point where I felt like I had wasted my entire time watching some episodes.
Example: Sakura will literally argue Rei (The Code Breaker) down about how he shouldn't kill someone who literary just killed someone, bragged about it, and/or was about to kill her just for the hell of it. Her reasoning is always along the lines of ""real justice"" and ""people being good"", but nothing in the story happens that actually strongly supports her argument COMPARED to what happens in the story to go against it nor is she even able to give Rei a good rebuttal to this. Yet, almost every time she gets in the way (literally sometimes) of Rei from doing his job as a Code Breaker. With the series only having 13 episode, time wasted on that could've been used towards the story an further explaining the other Code: Breakers along with their past.",1518480000,,1705,4.5537459283387625
8647935,3,B00J49R1G4,"it chickened out at the end.

It follows the standard Japanese anime tropes:
Innocent, well-meaning student.
Most scenes take place in a school.
There is a Japanese ranking system
The lead characters have special, magical superpowers which conveniently come out when the heroes are about to be defeated.

I thought it had a lot of promise in the beginning because the male protagonist is kind of a murderer and sociopath and does heinous things.  Not that I like this - it simply would have been more interesting than what it became - standard anime, mean male lead (who the female loves no matter how often he is a jerk to her) learns to care and find a heart at the end.

There is also nothing really that terrible about this.

I would not recommend purchase.",1518307200,2,761,4.607407407407408
