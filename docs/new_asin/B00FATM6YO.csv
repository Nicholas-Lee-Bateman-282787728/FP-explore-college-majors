8613905,1,B00FATM6YO,"Lousy depiction of a very serious social problem. This film treats a horrendous social issue like some kind of two-bit (Twenty-five cent) crime novel, and does it in a fashion that defies credulity. I wasted my time trying to understand why sometimes brilliant people drop out of life simply because they have either  had it with the system, are  down and out, drug addicted, or simply too  lazy to cope with the vicissitudes of life, and prefer to ""escape"" into this type of dangerous life style, which serves no purpose other than giving up on life instead of seeking a way to find hope,
