8715770,5,B00XDBMBZA,"Paxmans Empire series is not the usual documentary that addresses the typical narrative of how, when, and where the British Empire emerged and evolved. He concentrates on the legacy of the empire.  He visits a modern day Maharaja who was educated in England and asks him some penetrating questions about the influence of the imperial experience on India today.  A section on the Indian Army reveals how the imprint of British traditions and culture lingers.  One my favorite scenes is his attention to that greatest of imperial traditions: the club.  Two old expats in Singapore reveal how their club life grounds them in a larger community of people. It makes their life enjoyable, and one can absolutely see how British colonials would have thought similarly around say 1900.
  My chief complaint about Paxman as a narrator is his guilt complex that pervades the series.  It does not detract at all from the over-all quality of the film, but I have never understood this pathology that western intellectuals have of wallowing in a cesspool of guilt over every error and frailty made by people in the past.  It is a peculiar disease of westerners like Paxman, and it is incomprehensible.",1486425600,3,1188,4.934673366834171

8715774,5,B00XDBMBZA,"Empire is a British television series, co-produced by the BBC and Open University, which was written and is presented by  veteran BBC broadcaster Jeremy Paxman (THE VICTORIANS). It is based on Paxmans book EMPIRE: WHAT RULING THE WORLD DID TO THE BRITISH. The series is now showing, in syndication, I guess, on a secondary station of my local PBS station, and might be showing on yours. The in-depth documentary tells the story of Britains imperial ventures around the globe, from the arrival in foreign lands of the earliest explorersusually Scottish-- through their colonization of the countries, up to the final lowering of the Union Jack around the world, during which, an empire that had been 200 years in the building was dissembled in 20 years.  This five-parter, through the use of interviews, current film footage, archival film footage, paintings, artifacts, and archival photos, examines the impact of the empire at home, and in Britains former colonies; how it continues to exert an influence today. It examines the complex legacy of Britains imperial history: what drove the British to leave their cozy little island home for parts unknown? How did they take, then hold on to power?  How did they change the lands they conquered, how did those lands and their peoples change themtheir language and culture? To help answer those questions, Paxman travels to India, the Middle East, Canada, Africa, the Caribbean, and the Far Eastthe outposts of an empire four times larger than ancient Romes, on which the sun famously never setthere was imperial pink all around the globe--  nor as some wits were known to say, the blood never dried. There, he finds extraordinary individuals and an enduring legacy that, for good or ill, continues to shape the behaviors and beliefs of peoples all around the globe, as well as  now at a fairly newly multicultural home itself.

The episodes are:  A Taste for Power, Making Ourselves at Home, Playing the Game, Making a Fortune, Doing Good. The box set, which I received as a review copy, consists of two discs, totaling approximately 303 minutes.  It has subtitles, thank goodness: the numerous foreign accents were hard on my American ears.  It also has a 12 page bonus booklet, a guide with a timeline of the empire; a map of British colonies; articles on the empire under Queen Victoria, the British Commonwealth and modern multicultural Britain.  But beware, sensitive viewers, it does contain some strong language.

Paxman, who is arguably Britain's most respected political journalist, is known for his tough, rigorous interviewing of public figures; he was born in Leeds, educated at a prestigious private school, Malvern College, graduated from Cambridge University with a degree in English.  He here presents a lively, rewarding documentary on a compelling subject, with an epic world view.  Absorbing enough that in this house we binge-watched it. An excellent choice for anyone with an interest in British history, world history, economic history.",1447632000,,3005,5.133196721311475
