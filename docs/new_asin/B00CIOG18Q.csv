5722941,1,B00CIOG18Q,"ANOTHER FOUND FOOTAGE HORROR FLICK! This one belongs with so many other found footage movies that should never have been found.
I'm sorry, but this is just another ""I'm a filmmaker"" wannabe movie with a cheap camera and five friends on a camping trip thinking they will make the next breakout indie horror film.
Everything from the dialogue, camera work (shaky cam), acting, lact of direction and story to the acents is hard to sit through to the bitter end and yes, I did watch the whole thing!
The story of satanic worshiping and sacrifices taking place at Ash farms is the draw for the groups documentary director/camera guy leader of the pack to convince  four of his mates to venture into the unknown. It takes quite a while before anything starts to happen, but when it does the pace picks up quite a bit albeit nothing more than shaky cam wonderland with some running, screaming, talking repeat. At the end we find out the real reason Paul takes his friends into the woods???
There is a fair amount of cursing including the f...word I think (acents) with little violence and next to zero blood or gore and no sex or nude scenes. -5 stars",1414886400,,1144,4.580487804878048
5722942,2,B00CIOG18Q,"Was really disappointed in this movie, glad I rented it because sometimes I buy a movies before renting it. It is a found footage movie, which I like and was the reason I rented this. But the actors english accents are so hard to understand and the quality of the found footage video wasn't good. It was a good concept, and I liked the idea. Sort of a blair witch seem. But I would not watch it again mainly cause I basically needed subtitles to understand them.",1411862400,3,462,4.32183908045977
5722943,1,B00CIOG18Q,"Fake documentary about a search for Satanists. There are no hooded dudes, no bound girl. Just lots of really amateurish, in your face camera and a lot of random ground and tree footage as four people supposedly search for evidence in the woods.",1395014400,7,244,4.6976744186046515
5722944,1,B00CIOG18Q,"or rather, as BAD as blair witch project...I agree with Jeremy, there's something quirky about the 4 stellar reviews this received...additionally, close-up hand held photography and girls who shriek on cue are lousy watersheds for generating fear in an audience...watch the youtube trailer for free and know that is as good as the whole film gets",1377216000,4,346,5.196428571428571
5722945,3,B00CIOG18Q,"4 reviews. The movie is starring various artists. No listing on IMDB. So either they saw it at a screening or they worked on the set. If it's the latter and they are trying to hype it up to make a couple bucks it's not good for anyone because by doing this they make more and more people just go torrent the film for free because they don't trust reviews anymore and it also discredits the director, actors and anyone else's name tied to the film for future releases. I'm not saying that 1 or all 4 reviewers wrote false reviews but just in case they did, think long term impact, not short term fast cash because it affects the industry as a whole, not just one film. 3 Stars due to not knowing any info.",1375833600,6,704,4.1838235294117645
5722946,4,B00CIOG18Q,"This movie was crazy! I thought I knew exactly what to expect with this one, but it really surprised me! Lots of weirdness here. Great unsettling atmosphere to the whole thing. Yay for a great horror movie find!",1374969600,,211,4.578947368421052
5722947,4,B00CIOG18Q,Kind of reminded me of Blair Witch in ways. This kind of movie has been done before obviously but it was still entertaining and had original elements. I'll take this any day over Hollywood processed cheese.,1374710400,,206,4.75
5722948,5,B00CIOG18Q,"I loved this film wow, you thought you've seen it all, not until you have seen The Devils farm. I'm a horror buff & I'd highly recommend this to any horror film nut. A found footage film better then Blair witch!",1370649600,,211,4.170731707317073
5722949,5,B00CIOG18Q,awesum film its a must see . Really good film . This is found footage at its best with great acting and a great upcoming cast.,1368316800,2,126,3.8846153846153846
5722950,1,B00CIOG18Q,the sound quality was so bad i couldn't get into it...couldnt figure out what was being said...after five mins i gave up it wasn't worth the effort to try and figure it out...and im into these kind of movies so that says alot.....not worth buying or viewing spend money on another stupid movie that is at least stupid funny...,1422230400,2,326,4.5423728813559325
5722951,1,B00CIOG18Q,"Terrible.  I gave up with about 10 minutes left, hoping for the plot to redeem itself.  I'm pretty tolerant of bad movies to give them a chance, but this one wasn't worth watching.  There are a lot of the ""found footage"" movies out there, and this one felt like a film student project.  A C- student.",1420502400,,300,4.303571428571429
5722952,2,B00CIOG18Q,Movie  didn't make much sense.  Have a prime membership so didn't have to pay for it.  Join prime.  Dont pay for this movie.,1419465600,,124,4.260869565217392
5722953,1,B00CIOG18Q,"Wow, what a really terrible movie. there's nothing redeeming about any aspect of this tragic attempt at film making.",1418601600,,116,5.157894736842105
5722954,1,B00CIOG18Q,"Dude, this will BLOW YOUR MIND! You know the Blair Witch Project? Imagine that exact film, only done REALLY REALLY BADLY!
Whoa!",1418428800,2,127,4.818181818181818
5722955,3,B00CIOG18Q,"First thing I will say is, I know that this is a U.K based 'film' (shot on location in South Wales Valleys, UK) I've visited South Wales, among other surrounding areas and I even have a few friends from there... but with this film  ..uh, what? stop eating your face and just talk. Stop trying so hard to sound like you have an accent! I beg of thee.

..few of the people in this 'film' you will not, cannot understand a single word that is coming out of their mouths without captions on. And that's just plain annoying. It will be for anyone. {If I didn't have the captions on, I would not even know what the hell was going on.}

...The first female that is heard on film sounds as if she is trying way too hard to sound the way she is, with an accent. And again, I've said, I have friends from there and I've been there and honestly, she's trying way too damn hard to sound 'in place'. She relaxed for a moment and the words were understandable, but once she started trying too hard, again, it just sounded too forced.

...the girl who played Becca - omg girl, stop eating your face. Say your lines. If Nikita can, so can you. ...Guess she's from that high country in South Wales that I didn't get to visit?

..all acting in this was less than desirable, but we all have to start somewhere... (it's one of those train wreck movies - you just can't help but stop and watch and then after wonder why in the hell did you..) Brought around by the ""Blair Witch"" fade.. first person video camera shooter.

not to be a spoiler, but at the end, who in the hell moved the camera in the right direction for the shot? ..whatever. you all tried. ..just some tried too damn hard that you wanna shove your fist down their throat and pull out their tongue so they'll shut up. But hey, it was okay otherwise.

...I watched it 2 times. ...and I still don't know why, but I don't feel I lost any of my life either. :)

I won't say anymore about it so I won't ruin it for you.. just give it a watch, it is entertaining; which is what it's meant to be.",1416700800,,2033,4.168367346938775
5722956,2,B00CIOG18Q,Most of this movie was about running away. The scare scenes didn't even make up for the stretched out running scenes. It feels like they were trying to achieve a realism effect by showing whole footage of running around but they didn't do such a good job.,1416700800,,255,4.446808510638298
5722957,1,B00CIOG18Q,"This was a pathetic  try at making a horror movie. What a waste of time.
Recommend I DON'T THINK SO",1416009600,,99,3.95
5722958,5,B00CIOG18Q,Gud movie suppose to be true events !! Only part i didn't like real people after the first body was found they would have left. Why are u waiting around to die other than that its ok thanks for reading my review!!!!,1415318400,,215,4.142857142857143
5722959,1,B00CIOG18Q,"I am a native English speaker yet I could maybe only understand about 5% of what the actors said. Besides being nearly unintelligible this movie was very slow, talky and seemed to be a rip-off of other found footage movies. Lots of girls screaming in the woods but not much else. A real yawner.",1415059200,,294,4.462962962962963
8582130,1,B00CIOG18Q,"This is a found footage film with heavy accents that could have used English subtitles. Paul decides to take his camera and friends and go unannounced trespassing on Ash farm where it is rumored David Sullivan sacrificed two people to Satan. Rather than drive up the road to the gate, they hike a day and camp along the way to take up about 40 minutes of film and to annoy us with everything we hate about these films.

You don't get to see any action up close, everything is from afar. It does include out of focus pictures of the ground, a close-up of Becca's eye and a quick night/day filming while running reminiscent of Ed Wood style of cinema excellence. The picture on the DVD cover has nothing to do with the film. They  budget couldn't afford three red robes and a blindfold.

Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity. Worth a hacker's punch.",1524182400,,842,4.454545454545454

So... Do you like pretending your going on a long walk in the woods with really annoying friends constantly yelling at you? THEN YOU WILL LOVE THIS! but if you don't, i'm sorry. You will be stuck watching a horribly long ""walk in the woods, with some dialogue and cliche ""we filmed this"" shaky camera moments. Ugh.",1423526400,4,423,4.5064935064935066
8582139,1,B00CIOG18Q,"Sorry but I couldn't get into this film, I kept fast forwarding because it was so boring.  Most of the footage was of trees, the ground and faces.  Also, it was hard to understand what they were saying because of the water running in the background. Just another wannabe film maker.  It really was horrible.",1422921600,2,307,4.545454545454546
