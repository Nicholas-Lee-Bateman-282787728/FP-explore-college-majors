8624227,5,B00GL4XAWO,"This is a one of the top animes ever released ever.  if you look at any lists showing the best animes, this movie is consistently near the top...  The story is based on a girl who discovers that she has the ability to leap back in time to change the outcomes in her life.  The story is well thought out but there was a somewhat hole in the overall plot (if you think about time travelling as a whole).

The biggest issue is that the film was released by Bandai Entertainment for Region A and that company went under.  You can no longer buy this film in a Region A format except from Japan, but the Japan disc does not have English subtitles.  I see region A discs listed on eBay for $300+.  I wish they would find someone to re-release the movie in Region A.  Currently, the only way to view the movie in the U.S. is by buying a region free Blu-Ray player.

If you stumble across a region A copy of this movie, buy it!",1426204800,,918,4.112359550561798
