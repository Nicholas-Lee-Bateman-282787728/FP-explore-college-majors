1350399,5,B00004TJGZ,"Ilkka Jrvi-Laturi one of the Finnish great film directors brings something different to the screen with major stars! I heard that this movie was flop in America. Well, I'll understand that, this picture touches only Finnish people and especially people who lived in the capital. Almost every exterior shots have been filmed in Helsinki, only some short parts in northern Finland. The reason why this film interest so many Finns is that, Bill Pulman is in locations where you don't really imagine see that fellow -big Hollywood name. Anyway, this is the first large budget Hollywood picture, where city of Helsinki plays in it's own! (Not some Russian city, like all other films before that).",982627200,10,691,5.017391304347826
1350400,5,B00004TJGZ,"I must say I'm amazed by the vitriol the southerners have spilled on this entirely amiable little film. I found the movie an absolutely delightful surprise, never even having heard of it before stumbling upon it in the video store. The romance is sweet and sexy and completely charming, the satire of the Cold War extremely witty and clever, and the faintly submerged parody of Cold War and spy thrillers genuinely hilarious. The plot SEEMS complicated, but that is just parodying the intricacy of straight thrillers. When you get down to it, the plot of Spy Games is neither very complicated nor hard to follow. It's not trying to be the brilliantly tortuous Defense of the Realm; it's parodying and paying homage to movies like that at the same time. It reminded me very much of the great British TV movie Sleepers, which seems to be unavailable in any form now.
That said, however, the thriller aspects are just loopy and lumpy enough that they probably wouldn't carry the movie by themselves. But bolstering them is the genuinely sexy, sweet, believable adult romance between Bill Pullman and Irne Jacob.
I don't understand the criticism of the dialogue, either (or the complaint about the unintelligibility of the ""presumably Finnish"" actors-the cast consists mainly of Americans, French, and German performers; the only Finns I can remember who even HAVE dialogue are the shopkeeper and the hotel maid and bellboy). I wouldn't describe it as a golden script, by any means, with every line a winner (a fair amount of exposition is required in any movie like this-and the performances are so quirky and funny that I liked even these parts), but much of the dialogue is so funny that I'm laughing out loud just remembering it.
The movie is very European, from its attitude and sense of humor to its pacing and overall sensibility. That may be an acquired taste, but I thought this was the best movie I've seen in about the last year.",977961600,25,1936,4.816816816816817
1350401,2,B00004TJGZ,"The Cold War is over and two adversarial spies (Bill Pullman and Irene Jacob) fall in love and dream of living a normal life.  There is trouble in paradise, however, since they find themselves on opposite sides of an attempt to pass satellite codes to the Russians encoded into a homemade porno film.  This is a good premise for an international thriller, but the execution does a belly flop.
This film was produced in Finland to very low filmmaking standards.  Since I haven't seen many Finnish films, I can't say whether this is typical or atypical, but it was full of bad scene setups, plot inconsistencies and generally poor directing.  The soundtrack was jazzy and nice, but it often didn't fit with the scenes to which it was applied.
Director Ilkka Jarvi-Laturi was trying to present this as a lighthearted romantic comedy and international thriller, but it was marginal on the first count and a disaster on the second.  Bill Pullman can carry off the lovable romantic hero role, but as a spy, he is a joke.  Irene Jacob was better at handling the two aspects of the role, but the dialogue was so excruciating that her acting talent and beauty were not enough to save it.
Jacob and Pullman had some chemistry in the romantic scenes, but both seemed flummoxed in the comedic espionage scenes.  This was some incredibly bad writing and it must have been very difficult for these actors to say their lines without kecking.
This film is a jumbled mess with terrible writing and amateurish direction.  I rated it a 4/10.  Be sure to miss it.",972000000,6,1543,4.685185185185185
1350402,2,B00004TJGZ,"Although I rated the movie 2 stars, I give 5 stars to the soundtrack. The plot of the movie was extremely spastic. The scenarios jumped around so much, without much cohesion, that one feels like they are spending most of  the movie trying to discern what is going on and where it is leading. I  enjoy movies with complicated plots, but somewhere along the line they need  to be tied together. In my opinion, this one did not. I only watch movies  over again when I have really enjoyed them. When this movie was over, I  felt like I needed to watch it again to figure out the whole purpose.  HOWEVER, this movie is worth watching solely for the purpose of listening  to the 5.1 soundtrack. It has one of the best audio musical formats I have  heard in a movie. In fact, sometimes the music overpowered the dialog,  which, in the case of this movie, was just as well.",963964800,6,865,4.35625

7922579,5,B00004TJGZ,"Max (Bruno Kirby) is a conniving entrepreneur. He tries to make a deal with a Russian by copying and selling a painting, stolen from Russians that stole it from Nazis that stole it from France. Instead, he is given the job of delivering a tape to people in Helsinki. He must pose as a ""Reindeer condom"" distributor.

It turns out that the tape on the surface is a porn tape, which sees a lot of mileage in this movie, which is somehow embedded with a coded message. The CIA wants to be sure it does not reach KGB hands.

Of course, the cold war is supposed to be over but enter Harry Howe (Bill Pullman) CIA, and Natasha Scriabina (Irne Jacob) KGB, supposed lovers. Toss in Dave, a renegade CIA agent and you have a strange mix.

Everyone is out for them selves and still has to be civil. A substitute video is produces and we get to watch. Will Harry and Natasha get over their different backgrounds? Will Max ever make a profit? Someone is bound to be shot. The real question is, is Louise Hodges (Porn Woman) now an actor?",1504656000,,1025,4.328125

7922581,4,B00004TJGZ,"As I watched this movie, I came to the conclusion that it was slapstick comedy.  That is the only way to describe it.  I like Bill Pullman in comedy, and I love Irene Jacob in anything, particularly Incognito, but this movie was just plain fun to watch, as long as you like slapstick.  I would have given the movie 5 stars but the DVD music kept interfering with the actor's lines.  If you don't like slapstick, don't watch this, otherwise, enjoy.",1250985600,5,447,4.481481481481482
7922582,1,B00004TJGZ,"A so-clever-it's-confusing script sinks the good actors, locations, and direction. This is the type of film that would include a very naked (and very unerotic) porn scene and play it again and again. In fact, this movie does exactly that.

There's no suspense. No intellectual content. And there's no chemistry at all -- especially between the two leads, boy-next-door Pullman and delicious Irne Jacob -- who successfully overlays her French accent with a Russian one. (At least, Irene's nudity is done tastefully...more or less...)

This movie aimed high and hit itself in the pebbles.",1186099200,,586,5.223404255319149

7922586,5,B00004TJGZ,"I love this film, and so will you. I saw this film by the first time at the movie theatre and I had difficulties to sit on my chair because it was so funny. Jrvi-Laturi achieved to create an unique athmosphere to this film, for example scenes from Lappland are superb. Super-star Pullman is one of the most interesting actor in Hollywood at the moment and his performance in this movies is even better than in Independence Day! You have missed a lot if you haven't seen this movie. Best Buy Movie!!!",987897600,6,499,4.434782608695652
