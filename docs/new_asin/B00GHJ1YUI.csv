6076083,5,B00GHJ1YUI,"Chinatown and L.A. Confidential, together. How can you go wrong!!!

Two of the best movies I have ever seen. Atmospheric, well written, great cinematography and terrifically acted. Of the two, L.A. Confidential is the better, in all categories - my favorite movie of all time.",1431993600,,276,5.133333333333334

6076085,5,B00GHJ1YUI,"These two movies definitely rank high with me.

I had never seen Chinatown before I purchased this DVD set.  I did read numerous good reviews for the movie and being a fan of crime fiction as well as Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway, it seemed like a good fit for me.  It did not disappoint.

Nicholson plays private eye J.J. Gittes who is hired by the wife of Hollis Mulwray to provide evidence of Mulwray's adultery, but soon it becomes evident that not only was the woman not Mulwray's wife, but a much darker sinister crime is going on than simple adultery.  From a hilarious joke about how a china man has sex to someone almost losing a nose to John Huston's riveting role as a less-than-caring father, Chinatown packs a punch from beginning to end.  Lots of surprises you will never see coming.

I had seen L.A. Confidential before.  This dandy of a crime drama has a star-studded cast in a young Russell Crowe, Kevin Spacey and Guy Pearce along with Danny DeVito, Kim Basinger and James Cromwell.  Three L.A. cops in the 1950s deal with their own struggles while solving a string of murders that culminate in a huge climax where power and corruption abound.  I read the book by James Ellroy and this movie follows it very well.  The acting in this character driven piece if excellent and the back drop feels very real, showing how the glamorous appearing to be as natural as the McDonald's in your neighborhood.

This collection was in great shape and I have no problems playing either one.  And for the price, it cannot be beat.",1423094400,,1535,4.5583941605839415

6076089,5,B00GHJ1YUI,"Both films are worthy of merit.  I mean they can be watched over and over.  In the case of LA Confidential, the book is much wider in scope, clarifying some of the incidents taking place. Chinatown is a real weird film when one considers the plot, there are not many detective movies with water distribution/fraud as a subject.  At any rate, I wonder how the film industry can put out such quality films when the great majority of  Hollywood productions are mostly special effects junk for people under 35.",1416009600,,506,4.651685393258427
