2783759,2,B000NVIGL6,"Despite being overqualified for a job at a call center, an extremely intelligent man gets fired on the first day. Later then, he alongwith 2 other people (one, a teen waitress and two, his co-employee for one day) decide to venture into crime to make a quick dollar. If you're rolling your eyes right now or even if you're not, wait. The film starts on a good note but starts going downhill almost half an hour into it. I tried to like this movie but it's absolute shambles by the time the first tumultuous hour of warped direction, haphazard editing and wanna be script writing is over.

The Good - David Schwimmer, the trailer, maybe one funny scene in the whole film

The Bad - Irritating co-actor, Ugly villains with cheesy dialogues, boring use of the soundtrack, Very sketchy

I couldn't stand the co-actor, Gus. I couldn't stand the last 20 minutes and could barely wait for them to get over with. Towards the end, it's funny how the movie makers decide to play loud music in the film to prevent people from snoozing. Too much fake blood. Don't insult your humor around here.

I LOVE to be surprised like this.  The writing is clever, inventive and sharp.  I didn't expect much from this movie and was happily wrong.

David Schwimmer plays Charlie, an ex-teacher who wrote a book and while waiting to hear from a publisher (any publisher), gets a job at a call center where he is fired the first day!  But not before meeting Gus (Simon Pegg who shows his acting chops), who has a plan to blackmail the town's Reverend.  While they are discussing it at the pub, their plan is overheard by Josie (Alice Eve), a former beauty queen, who wants in on the deal.  So begins a comedy of SO MANY jaw-dropping errors that an hour and a half flies by.

2783799,5,B000NVIGL6,"Pretty much every movie that has former Friends star David Schwimmer acting in a lead role has gone straight to DVD as a result of the poor quality of films that the type casted actor starred in in the final seasons of and early years after Friends ended. 2006's Big Nothing certainly made no impact in the box office, I have to admit, I'd never even heard of it but when I came across this one and saw Simon Pegg's name on the cover, I thought I'd give it a try. Pegg had starred in Shaun of the Dead two years earlier but that film took a few years to become a smash hit, Hot Fuzz wasn't released until a year after this and other big box office films later than that.  If this was a fresh new film today with Pegg a household name I think it would be a lot more successful.

The film itself is a fun one.  It's not a realistic film by any means, but that's what makes it fun.  Dark comedy would probably be the best way to describe this one.  It's basically about an extortion plan by a group of strangers coming together who are in desperate need for money that doesn't go according to plan, but other than that it is best to go into this not knowing much, as the turns in the plot and surprises are what make it so enjoyable.  Pegg's character Gus, is a little different to his usual Paul, Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz characters but there are still enough similarities for fans of those films.  Schwimmer's character Charlie is sort of like Ross, but thankfully a less annoying version.  Alice Eve the other lead also does a great job, I'd never heard of her before but hope she pops up in more movies I watch in the future.",1369872000,,1629,4.182108626198083

2783824,3,B000NVIGL6,"And it really is nothing. They all lie to one another. They all are mentally deficient in a way or another. They all want to make an easy dollar, or rather an easy $100,000 that turns a just as easy $2,000,000. And they don't know what to do with it and the complications.

It's a generic remake of a Coen Brothers' film. You might find it funny, but it is a gross comedy with a touch of romantic attachment and a stroke of vain and painless silliness. The film has no meaning whatsoever. It is just a farce.

But if your stomach is slightly delicate, better abstain. A septic tank stinks. Vomiting in the bouquet in the living room stinks. Killing someone with an axe in the middle of the skull stinks. Killing a diabetic person with an overdose of sugar stinks? Killing some one or oneself with an overdose of concentrated valium stinks. ETC.

But, like all farces, it is funny ah-ah and nothing else.

2783827,3,B000NVIGL6,"Dark criminal comedy with the trope-laden twists and turns surrounding characters with little or no redeeming qualities. Playing on the now tried-n-true formula for these kinds of flicks, which is kind of sad. I remember when this was a fairly fresh concept back in the early 1990's, gotta give Tarantino credit where credit is due.

It took twenty years - but now this type of production is now so ploddingly predictable.

Only thing I enjoyed screening this movie: Simon Pegg doing a turn as a no-good bleeping bleep. A bit of a role changer as he's almost always the good egg. But, dang, he's still funny playing a turd.

Otherwise, a passable flick if you enjoy these blood-soaked-who-gets-to-live-while-fighting-for-the-money productions.

Note: Maybe it's me, but while watching the ubiquitous blonde babe, I honestly thought was watching Rebecca Romijn. It wasn't until after the film that I found out that she has a ""twin sister"" in Alice Eve.

2783841,5,B000NVIGL6,"Big Nothing is actually a pleasant surprise to me personally.

I thought it was going to be a really average movie considering who was starring in it.  Turns out, not only is the movie interesting, I might even go out on a limb and say it's a classic in some kind of weird way!

The MANY plot twists, the comedy and drama segments combined *perfectly* to keep your attention, and just *every single line* that's delivered by the characters... wow what a film!  I'm seriously quite shocked just how good it was.  I never would have expected a quality film of this level.

Anyway, the story is about two guys and a woman who come up with this complex plan to take someones money over a pay phone... but many MANY things go wrong along the way, including some murders and trying to cover their tracks and explain themselves to the police, and it's just incredible how exciting the storyline is.  I'm by no means a fan of that guy from the hit TV show Friends, but something about his performance here... he totally nails it.

This is the kind of movie I'd like to watch again to catch all the little jokes I may have missed, along with trying to figure out exactly what was going on the entire time (because let's be honest, with so many things happening at once, it's real easy for your mind to get a little bit confused at times!)

And WOW is Alice Eve a hot actress!  Watching her in this movie in that ""bad girl"" role, she was incredibly attractive to me, and fit the part perfectly.  Great movie.",1250208000,2,1498,4.371841155234657
2783842,5,B000NVIGL6,"Recommended by one of my Ammie buddies (Thanks FM!), this film is one bloody crazy ride! This film starts out funny and never lets up. It reminded me of 'Blood Simple', but it stands on its own as a solid dramedy. Simon Pegg has delivered more good comedies in the last few years than many A list comedians. This one should not be missed! The DVD has an excellent transfer and there are some interesting extras.",1248566400,,411,4.421052631578948
2783843,4,B000NVIGL6,"David Schwimmer plays Charlie, an ex-teacher turned reluctant call centre employee who gets fired on his first day after muttering obscenities to a caller that he thought was on hold. Distressed and unable to provide for his family, he agrees to accompany Gus (whom he befriends on his one day of call centre work), played by Simon Pegg, on a scheme that is sure to yield big bucks: blackmail a reverend who has frequently turned up in a listing of visitors to child-porn websites. Along with Gus' ex, the plan moves into motion. But all goes awry when the trio inadvertently murder the reverend in his own house.

What follows is one of the most bizarre movies that I've seen in quite some time. It's at times side-splittingly funny, and others gruesomely gory. Somewhat in the vein of an American-styling of Pegg's other project, Shaun of the Dead, this thriller-comedy lives up to its billing. I laughed hysterically, and nearly soiled myself from surprise. The story is anything but conventional, with so many twists and turns that I hadn't a clue how it would all play out in the end. Main characters are killed, while others kill themselves. Whether the gang succeeds in the end remains to be seen, and I'll leave it for you to decide if they did or not.

The film is carried by the charm of its two stars. Schwimmer and Pegg make a good duo, with Schwimmer being the straight-laced emotional centre, as Pegg provides the high-strung hijinks and hilarity. Alliteration aside, their dichotomy allows for the right amount of interesting interaction to carry the movie along towards the insanity that goes down at the reverend's house and beyond. Once the plan goes wrong, the viewer can just sit back and revel in the chaos.

I'll admit that this one won't appeal to most, but for the people who get it will be pleasantly surprised. Fans of Schwimmer, Pegg, and comedic-thrillers can't go wrong with The Big Nothing.",1248307200,2,1920,4.75975975975976

2783859,5,B000NVIGL6,Just a joy for me to watch! I haven't ever been let down yet by Simon Pegg (the guy from Shawn of the Dead) and his wit plays off of Schwimmer's drollitivity(?) perfectly. The chick is dynamite and she mentally kicks the crap out of the two men who are smart enough to acknowledge it with just the right amount of self deprecation. The plot constantly twists and turns and the comedy is all black. That's key for me.

2783860,4,B000NVIGL6,"This is one of the more enjoyable ""bumbling amateur criminals"" movies that I've seen.

It's a UK/Canadian production but it's set in the U.S. and it stars David Schwimmer in my favorite movie role of his to date. His lugubrious manner is perfectly complimented by bouncy, James-Cagney-like Simon Pegg, a British comedian donning a perfect American accent. Their screen chemistry is wonderful.

Joining them is another Brit with another perfect American accent plus tremendous sex appeal, Alice Eve, playing a third kooky wheel in this unlikely team of extortionists. I gotta say: the acting by everyone (Brit, American, and Canadian) is top-notch.

The script by Frenchman Jean-Baptiste Andrea and American Billy Asher tries to avoid cliches -- or at least improve on them -- and Andrea's direction gives the film a slightly surreal touch altho the film retains a down-to-earth quality.

That surreal touch plus its dark quality may limit this film's appeal, but those who like terrific acting and fast-paced fun may revel in that appeal.

(To people who have already seen the film: there's a difference of opinion here and at the Amazon UK site about Simon Pegg's accent. I think that those who are familiar with Simon Pegg will be influenced by that familiarity and find his accent strange -- while those of us who aren't familiar with him will find his accent perfect, albeit energetic, Midwestern. Can you click on the ""comments"" link below my review and reveal (1) if you were familiar with Pegg before this movie and (2) how succcessful you thought his accent was?

A former school teacher in an effort to help support his family financially teams up with a con artist and his ex-girlfriend in blackmailing a reverend with a soft spot for illegal on-line adult entertainment.
The plot has elements of both comedy and drama making it rather difficult to label it as one or the other; it's actually a bit of both.
In short, the acting is good, the plot is just average, while the humor is decent.
In a nutshell, it's probably not a movie you would want to add to your collection, but it might provide for an evening's entertainment, and that's about it.

 Filmed in the UK and Canada and set in anywhere USA . For reasons that become clear in the plot Schwimmers character  has problems and Peggs character brings him unwillingly into an extortion  plan. Confusion and murder follow.  I liked the timing and comedy and comic plot twists but it has British dry humour so ""Friends"" fans you may not get it.

It feels like there may be one scene missing or cut  at the end (is the wife in the truck ? ) and the diabetic murder scene is kind of pointless ( why not just shoot him) which is why i give it a 4 not a 5.
