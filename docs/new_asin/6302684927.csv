7999219,5,6302684927,"I have watched this VHS 100 times. It has some of the greatest moments in baseball, that you will not find on any other baseball movie. It has a variety of things to see and hear. All fun! My favorite part is at the end of the movie with a classic confrontation with Earl Weaver, and the umpire. Watch the ump pop a pill to keep his cool. Totally classic. Kirby Puckett, the small version of Barry Bonds, and the beefed up version of Mark McGwire. A must see for a true baseball fan.",1332547200,,483,4.148936170212766
