It combined many bad actors from many bad movies to combine in a wonderful exercise in...[nothing].  The plot is just completely ridiculous and unorganized.  I won't even get into it.  If you want some specific details on how bad it is check out the review above me.  I would recommend this movie to you, but it is terrible...",978825600,2,442,4.382716049382716
1330852,1,B00003IXDG,"Oh my God, I can't believe they actually released this movie onto video! ...I had the dreadful misfortune of actually watching this film....thank GOD it was on HBO (I actually thought it was an HBO  made-for-tv movie)...anyways, this movie was SOOO bad, I'm surprised that  the Air Force even allowed their aircraft to be photographed for this  movie..seriously..there's no plot and horrendous acting, but what can you  expect from a movie with the title ""Stealth Fighter""?  Besides  that, the movie is bad almost to the point of being funny....like the  ending, I won't ruin it or anything (wouldn't that be bad! )......just  don't bend over to pick up your beer (probably #12 by that point in the  movie) because you might miss the whole ending...it's over that quick!  One example of why this movie stinks so bad: Ice-T WALKS onto an Airforce  base...decides to meander over to a hanger, knocks down a couple of  <good> guys that look like offensive-tackle-types...then just jumps  into a Stealth fighter (that happens to have the keys in it, and is fully  gassed up)...and flies away non-chalantly....and he doesn't even rap!  Anyways, might be good if you're inebriated and need a good  laugh....otherwise, avoid this like a port-a-potty at a Buffet  concert...like my roommate says of this movie in the same voice as that guy  from the Simpsons, ""Worst.....movie......ever!

1330861,2,B00003IXDG,"This a very bad made movie. I would have thought it was made by someone, who did zero research on what this movie was about. Navy does not fly Air Force planes. Navy seals do not fly Jet Fighter planes. The US Navy does not have colonels. And the mistakes go on, and on. If you know nothing about a subject, then you may not want to be making a movie about it, if you are not willing to do the research or hire someone who really does, and that not your friend who washed out of basic training, and now is a know it all. This movie would be good to get drunk or high and then you and your friends watch and make fun of all the dumb mistakes and bad acting. I gave it a 2 star only because I was able to finish watching it within a 24 hour period.",1470182400,,746,3.8506493506493507

1330870,5,B00003IXDG,"I bought this as a gift for my father. He saw it on TV and asked me to buy it for him. No, it's not an action blockbuster like say Expendables or Top Gun but my dad likes it and the disc works just fine.. He is happy with the purchase...",1371168000,,237,3.6666666666666665
1330871,2,B00003IXDG,"I have yet to see how Ice T keeps getting roles in movies.  He is such a bad actor, and he has no screen presence.  Yet he keeps cropping up in inane movies like this one.  This time he's a traitorous pilot who fakes his own death so he can resurface working for some drug or munitions lord and steal a stealth fighter to accomplish assassinations for the criminal.  He is tracked by his former co-pilot, a straight arrow guy whose marriage is floundering because he spends too much time at work?  Come on, ladies..you marry a military man, you expect this.  Having recently seen HOT SHOTS 1 & 2, this is the kind of movie those gems spoofed; this would have been better had it been a spoof.  Aside from Ice T's stony performance, we get Wishmaster's Andrew Divoff with some kind of phony accent; Costas Mandylor huffing and puffing his way through his standard role; Erika Eleniak pouting in her few scenes as Costas' estranged wife; and funniest of all, Ghostbusters' Ernie Hudson as the President of the United States.

It's all tastelessly dull and routine, and I give it two stars only because I finished watching it.",1111536000,2,1122,4.575
1330872,1,B00003IXDG,"We have a competition to see who can find the worst movie. Then we watch it with a group of guys and call it ""Men's Stupid Movie Night."" This movie qualified, as do all of the movies by this director. It was pretty entertaining if viewed from that point of view. Bad dialogue, an incomprehensible plot, innappropriate and ultra cheesy sets, lousy ""acting"", stolen footage from other movies, no regard of military protocol, uniforms, weapons systems, and anything that resembles a real military situation. Since we invite our sons, we actually look for clean movies to mock, and this is full of gratuitous bad language, such as the scene where Ice T unloads a barrage of F-Bomb flak at the President of the United States. As Ice T states so succinctly, ""What a wasthte!"" (an attempt to spell Ice man's pronunciation). I could not agree more. But then again, that's what Stupid Movie Night is all about.",1110758400,4,901,4.745222929936306
1330873,1,B00003IXDG,"AN AIR FORCE PILOT [ICE-T] FAKES HIS OWN DEATH ONLY TO RESURFACE AS THE PARTNER OF A DEADLY LATIN AMERICAN ARMS DEALER [ANDREW DIVOFF]. WHEN A STEALTH GETS STOLEN AND IT'S USED TO TARGET THE MILITARY, IT'S UP TO ONE MAN [COSTAS MANDYLOR] TO STOP HIM BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE. ONE THING THAT CAN'T BE DENIED IS THAT THIS MOVIE IS BORING. THE ACTION IS NOT WORTH WATCHING, THE SCRIPT IS DUMB, AND THE STORY JUST GETS TIRING AFTER A WHILE. ERNIE HUDSON'S ACTING TALENTS ARE ONCE AGAIN WASTED IN ANOTHER LOW-RENT DIRECT-TO-VIDEO FILM. IF YOU LIKE ICE-T AND WANNA SEE ONE OF HIS MORE RECENT FILMS, SAVE YOUR MONEY AND RENT OR BUY ''OUT KOLD''.",1095033600,4,634,4.474137931034483
1330874,5,B00003IXDG,"Picture the scene...
Saddam Hussein (apparently French judging by his accent) goes to Thailand to purchase a case of machine guns... personally.  To celebrate cliching the deal the devout muslim pours a glass of vodka for his Thai warlord friend and swigs from the bottle himself uttering one of the classic lines of modern cinema... 'A toast!'.  He then stumbles on to the veranda of the hut to be nuked by Ice-T in a sttthhtealth (sic) fighter.  We laughed for hours! OK so the film is terrible but that one scene makes this a work of absolute genius!
Here is 'a toast' to the inspired direction and sparkling performance by 'Saddam' he diserves an Oscar!!  Perhaps the CIA could replace the real Saddam with the star of this film.  No one would be able to tell the difference!",1004227200,6,779,4.615942028985507
1330875,1,B00003IXDG,"As far as Ice T vehicles go this one is pretty good.  Ice T gives a totally believable performance as a former rap artist desperately trying to parlay his past sucess in the music business into a career as a bad actor.  His acting is probably improving though, but who can tell?  Unfortunately Science cannot yet measure the miniscule improvement in his talent and Amazon does not provide me with the option of anything less than one star... All that aside, Ice T is not totally to blame for this movie's garbage-ness.  The script is pretty weak and the supporting cast is not very supportive.  Maybe I couldn't suspend my disbelief, but in certain scenes, like all the ones where people are being stealthy, they are not stealthy, they are clearly in plain view of the people they sneak up on.  The Stealth Bomber featured in the film spends most of its time parked in a garage.  And when it attacks targets it certainly doesn't ""smart bomb"" them...nor does it make any effort to go unseen.  It actually attacks in broad daylight.  I guess we are supposed to chalk that up to Ice T's lack of flight experience.  Bottom line: if you name your movie ""Stealth Fighter"" then by definition it should have some stealth in it.  Maybe its ironic.  Maybe the quality of the movie is ""stealthy"" making it appear as if it is without quality.  Bearing that in mind I give it no stars but it gets five stars--all in stealth mode.",983318400,7,1416,4.52755905511811
1330876,1,B00003IXDG,"Ice T is a air force pilot turned evil doer for hire in this action ""thriller"".  Apparently on US Air Bases, they don't lock anything and easily allow their stealth jets to be taken.  Also, the guards that are supposedly looking out for people trying to break in to the base are completely surprised, when the exact thing they are supposed to be doing happens, and allow themselves to be shot.  And where exactly did a man that feined his own death get at least 5 bank accounts all in different countries?  Wouldn't it suffice just to have one Swiss bank account?  Apparently not for Ice T.  Of course in the conclusion he is ultimately spoiled by a wristwatch with no band, that can apparently counteract all the stealth features of his jet.  I would recommend this movie, but it is terrible...",979171200,4,795,4.556338028169014
