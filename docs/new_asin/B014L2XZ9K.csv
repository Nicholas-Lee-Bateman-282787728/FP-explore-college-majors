7414480,5,B014L2XZ9K,"VIGILANCE!!! FORNICATORS!!!! > I love this season, BOBBY HILL shines in these episodes!
ORDERED = 10/07/2016 || SELLER = MovieMars || PAID = $23.11
(Beware of Seller changes! That's when you may get burned!)

:: PROS ::
1.)  Good story telling & funny lines for many of the cast!
2.)  3 FULL Blu-Ray Discs - so happy this season is a FULL one! (Blu-Ray is a MUST HAVE!!!)
3.)  Picture Quality is fantastic, NO BARS AT ALL!!!
4.)  Bobbys Vigilance line and the Sinners/Fornicators lines are HILARIOUS!!!  (Reminds me of his self-defense training episode!)
5.)  STRONG ENDING FOR A GREAT SHOW THAT I TRULY MISS!!!!!

:: CONS ::
1.)  Hanks lines are somewhat repetitive, feels like Hank got short end of the writing :(
2.)  If you own ALL of the discs & know the show well, Hank seems to have amnesia? (ie: Bobby finally joins a sports team?  But he did that in earlier seasons.)

OVERALL :: I LOVE KotH, it reminds me of when America was not so messed up & crazy.  I can't watch any more Family Guy stuff, just to sick of cut-scenes & camera stares.  I love all animated sit-coms (Bobs Burgers is my KotH fix nowadays!) but KotH will ALWAYS have a special place in my heart.  You can sit with your FAMILY and watch KotH.  People that get offended by this show need to GET REAL!!!  KotH is funny, thoughtful & has genuine character development.

KOTH IS BETTER THEN ANY REALITY TV SHOW IN MY OPINION!!!!",1479859200,8,1400,4.466403162055336

7414498,5,B014L2XZ9K,"This was one of the greatest shows from the ""millennium"" era. Everybody could identify with at least one or two of these charmingly exaggerated characters. As I'm sure everyone here knows, animated characters can get away with a lot of things real actors can't, and that makes a terrific animated show like this (and especially The Simpsons) even more special. I will have to say, there was a stretch there in the 9th - 10th seasons when I thought they were losing the ""touch"" (they almost ran the ""Bobby the iconoclast"" vs. ""Hank the uptight traditionalist"" thing into the ground). There were a few episodes that came close to the ""cringeworthy"" line; I'm picturing Bobby baking girl scout cookies, joining witches, etc., but they recovered nicely and got back to the more subtle tension, which was much funnier. Example:  Bobby in a frilly pink apron baking girl scout cookies is not as funny as Kahn catching Bobby in Connie's room and telling Hank he has a ""sex-starved hillbilly with one thing on his mind"" on his hands. Hank walks out of Kahn's view and says, ""WHEW!"" - One of the best moments of this gem. Highly recommended for any fan of The Simpsons, the offbeat, or satire in general. And special kudos to all the guest voices, esp. Governor Ann Richards, Johnny Knoxville, Ellen Barkin, Sarah-Michelle Gellar - well, they're too numerous to list. I miss it already.",1450742400,,1377,4.785714285714286

7414503,5,B014L2XZ9K,"The final season is full of laughs, quotes, and memorable episodes. After floundering for a few seasons the show really finished surprisingly strong. The Blu-ray looks great and b/c this was the only season originally made in HD, it's great to see it properly presented on Blu-ray. The picture and audio quality is absolutely superb, no artifacts or sound clipping. It's a total joy to own the complete final season in one slick Blu-ray set. My only complaint is that the case itself held the discs to tightly, that is... until I modified the inner plastic holders by removing some bits. Now the discs pop in-and-out perfectly.
The set includes all the episodes from the final season, including the four 'lost' syndication only episodes, presented properly in originally intended order. And this set suffers from no odd issues/nitpicks like some of the previous sets did.
Go ahead and get this final season of the animated hit on Blu-ray... I tell you what.",1449187200,7,957,4.91358024691358

8731259,5,B014L2XZ9K,"I tell you what, man, back in 2006 Fox released the sixth season of KOTH on dvd and shortly after that they announced that they scrapped their plans to release any more seasons of KOTH. Dang it, man, Dang it! The fans went crazy and petitioned Fox to please release KOTH but we just got ignored. That is just bad business Fox, dirty pool, Fox, dirty pool. Now listen up Fox, at Strickland the customer comes first. That is right, the customer comes first. I reckon Fox needs to be schooled on that lesson.

Flash forward to 2014. After nearly nine dang years of praying for this to come out, Olive Films comes to the rescue and starts releasing KOTH on dvd. Now I read some reviews on here and I got mighty scared to buy this, I tell you what. People were saying that their screens would just go black after an episode and not return to the menu, or the dvds wouldn't play, or there are black lines on the side of the picture. I don't know if they got bad copies or what but the set I have plays perfectly. There are no freeze ups and my dvds go back to the main menu after each episode. Every time, man, every dang time. That is all good BUT THERE ARE black bars hard matted on the image on the first seven episdoes just like the Season 11 set. Someone at Olive done gone and messed up but my friend Ron2900 thought he found a fix, I tell you what. I'm going to let him explain in his own words...

Boomhauer isn't always that easy to understand so we thought I should explain this. When I have a full frame 4:3 dvd I will watch it in 4:3 mode on my tv and there will be black (in my case, gray) bars or I can watch it in 16x9 or screen fit and the image stretches with no black bars. On the first seven episodes of this season the black bars will not go away in 16x9 or screen fit and when I watch it 4:3 there are black bars in addition to the gray bars on my set so the image is scrunched and the image is too tall and skinny. From episode eight on the show went HD and the aspect ration changed from 1.33 to 1.78 and these episodes look like they should. I think someone messed up at Olive and I'm going to contact them about re-authoring these and getting replacement dvds but in the meantime...

I was able to fix the same problem with the Season 12 set and view the show ""normally"" just like the previous seasons by changing the tv type setting in the menu on my Sony dvd player from 16x9 (I have a 16x9 tv set) to the 4:3 letterbox or 4:3 pan and scan setting. You would think it would work with this season too but all it did with is create a black border that surrounds the entire picture. The only way I could get rid of the black bars was to set my screen resolution to 1280x720 from my dvd player and then set my tv to zoom 1. It is not an optimal solution because the top and bottom of the picture gets cropped but that is the only one I found if you want to fill your entire tv screen. If anyone has a better solution or any questions about setting their player, feel free to comment or email me and I will try my best to help y'all. Back over to Boomhauer...

Those dang ol' Fox flipper dvds, man. No worries, man, no worries. All 24 uncut episodes of Season 13 are on three single sided dual layered dvds. Let me break it on down for y'all:

Disc One:
01 Dia-Bill-Ic Shock

04 Lost In Myspace
05 No Bobby Left Behind
06 A Bill Full Of Dollars
07 Straight As An Arrow
08 Lucky See Lucky Do

Disc Two:
09 What Happens At The National Propane Gas Convention...
10 Master Of Puppets
11 Bwah My Nose
12 Uncool Customer
13 Nancy Does Dallas
14 Born Again On The Fourth Of July
15 Serves Me Right For Giving Gen George S Patton The Bathroom Key
16 Bad News Bill

Disc Three:
17 Manger Baby Einstein

19 The Boy Can't Help It
20 The Honeymooners

24 To Sirloin With Love

Video: Black bars aside, the first seven episodes are presented in a solid 1:33 transfer just like they aired. The rest of the season is presented in solid 1.78 transfer just like they aired. The colors on all pop and for the most part everything looks good. Sometimes I'll notice some jaggies in certain scenes but it isn't too dang bad or distracting.

Audio: English 2.0 and Spanish 2.0. The audio is clear sounding and I have no complaints.

Subtitles: English

Extras: Boy, I tell you what, man, this dang ol' set just has the episodes and nothing else. Dang ol' bare bones dvd. Dang it!",1501977600,29,4515,4.136830102622577
