2836924,3,B000QFAFQ8,This movie was a bit more interesting then i expected because it goes throughout the whole story of big and not just the commercialized stories the public always display,1227398400,,169,4.862068965517241
2836925,5,B000QFAFQ8,"i was and still dig Biggie his story telling and overall vibe and the Brother was funny as well. this footage captures him busting freestyles on the street and offers reflections on his career, and during the Bad Boy era. it was sad just thinking about him not being around anymore. this documentary showcased so many sides to the Biggie Legacy. this is a must for any Biggie fan indeed. him and 2Pac are forever linked and this documentary touches on that and Biggie's old neighborhood and also reflections from his running crew,etc.....",1205625600,4,538,4.795698924731183
2836926,5,B000QFAFQ8,"Seldom seen home video footage, newly-released interview captured shortly before his death, footage of the crime scene, and recollections from such close friends and collaborators as Easy Mo Bee, Raekwon, Ditty, and Method Man, this comprehensive portrait of a hip hop superstar will have fans dusting off their old copies of Life After Death for another, nostalgic listen.

2836927,3,B000QFAFQ8,"Prolific hip-hop documentarian Peter Spirer (Thug Angel, Beef) delivers another fast-paced and stylish piece.  The high points--rare home video footage of B.I.G. in candid moments;  Memories by Matty C, Method Man, Easy Mo Bee and several childhood friends illuminate exactly what made him such a legendary emcee.  and strictly UNBELIEVABLE footage of B.I.G.'s caravan leaving the Peterson Automotive museum literally seconds before he was shot.  The downside is that there is absolutely NO MUSIC BY BIGGIE in the film at all.  Interviews with Diddy and Ms. Wallace are glaringly absent.  The bulk of this film is made up of outtakes of B.I.G. from the superior Rhyme and Reason.  Even the bonus feature, LIVE FROM BEDFORD STUVESANT shows other kids freestyling, but whenever B.I.G. reaches for the mic, it fades to white.  It seems likely that they have their own film projects in the works.  So if you are a true Biggie fan, you will definitely want to cop this.  Spirer definitely has the chops and cred to pull off the definitive documentary of Biggie, but without the participation of Bad Boy and Biggie's estate, it's impossible to give this 5 mics.",1189382400,5,1155,5.0

8195942,5,B000QFAFQ8,"Been a Biggie fan since the day he came out and was pleased to watch this. No real music performances, but great story, narration and discussions about the greatest rapper on this earth. A few great and never seen before clips that were good to see. The stuff you hear on this DVD will make you think. And the whole east-coast west-coast beef was something that should have never happened. The Notorious B.I.G. and Tupac were friends until mistakes and assumptions were made.

Biggie will always be the best for many reasons. R.I.P Notorious B.I.G.",1321056000,,548,4.768421052631579
8195943,1,B000QFAFQ8,"Good for the BIG fan,tells his side of the story and a look back at his life which ended tragically sadly. I am not a fan of him or his music so I am biased however this should appeal to his fans even if the casual ones or the so-called backpackers.",1293148800,,249,3.9019607843137254
8195944,5,B000QFAFQ8,"...except maybe in the background.  I don't think it would have bothered me if another review hadn't told me.  On the other hand I knew there wouldn't be any so I didn't sweat it.

OK The movie really tells some things that I didn't know concerning B.I.G.and for that point alone I think Biggie Die Hards ought to peep this out.  As for the regular ""hip hop fan"" there is a lot to like in this, but it is basically a documentary about BIG, so unless you are peripherally interested, realize that it's all about BIG and(lesserknown) story's about his life. It'b great for a collection of HipHop Movies.  On this other hand-To get a sense of the ""Voice"" and his ""Velvety Flow"", you'll need to supplement this with an album. I recommend:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ready-to-Die-The-Remaster/dp/B000JJ4PDK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ready to Die: The Remaster</a>

It's obvious there were a lot of things that this movie lacked specifically because of licensing issues, certain Film Footage and of course the music. Even the On the Corner Freestyle-Before He Blew Up footage wasn't included. They have almost that complete footage EXCEPT the freestyle in the blue and white button down shirt.  That was disappointing.

For some Biggie history it's worth grabbn@50% off. Alotta weed alotta fowl language, so don't give it to your 12 year old for her birthday",1265587200,,1401,5.2792792792792795
