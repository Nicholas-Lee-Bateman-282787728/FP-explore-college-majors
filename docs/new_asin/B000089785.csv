7980750,4,B000089785,"The reviewer lecudedag is right, in that misogyny is prevalent throughout the movie Jin Pin Mei. However, this is a historical depiction, and I would wager closer to how things really were than those lighthearted 1990s fantasy CAT III eroticas wherein the independent and sexually liberated women are actually anachronisms given those movies' historical settings . If you wanted to see a western where the good guy always wins and the bad guy falls dead from a bloodless gut shot, you would watch an Oater from the 40s or 50s. if you wanted to see a realistic depiction you would watch Deadwood. The latter might be more challenging in terms of content, but it will be far more realistic. The same applies here.",1434326400,,711,4.788617886178862
7980751,1,B000089785,"If you've ever seen good Chinese erotica (Sex and Zen, Erotic Ghost Story, etc), then you might have, like I was, been hoping that this was one of those films.

It is not!

It is an adult film but I did not enjoy it. Women were 'victims' of male lusts. The only 'power' women had were in scheming behind the scenes against other women.

On a technical side too, the subtitles were blurred - maybe you don't watch this film for dialogue, but for me, it helps.",1137628800,18,458,4.241379310344827
