8604284,1,B00EDP5UWG,This is the worst chess instruction I've ever seen in my life. Charlie goes too fast and hardly provides any explanations.,1466640000,,122,4.857142857142857
8604285,1,B00EDP5UWG,"A Disgracefully Bad & Lazy Chess Video

This is - bar none - the worst, laziest and least useful chess video I have ever seen

First off - Charlie Storey spends an enormous amount of time and repetition plugging his other products - the similarly awful book and DVD set on the Black Sniper

Second - the arrogance of Storey to term this White opening of moves like 1.c4 or 1.g2 the ""White Sniper"" when in fact he is just rehashing games from the English Opening, Botvinnik System, Catalan - beggars belief

Next - speaking of games - and that is all the this video does is cover games

- there is 0% instruction or theoretical analysis of these opening systems by White

 - almost every game is from the games of Polish GM Tomasz Markowski

- are simply replayed by Storey at breakneck speed - with such wonderfully 'deep' strategic analysis from Storey as:

""Here Markowski played a good move"" - Thank you so much Charlie - so insightful
and

""My analysis shows that this setup for White leads to a draw"" - a conclusion he reaches even before one move has been played!

A total waste of time and money",1409356800,,1102,4.405940594059406
