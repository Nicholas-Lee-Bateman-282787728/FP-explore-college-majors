2737520,5,6305090246,"Lupin the third the mystery of mamo was the first feature length animated Lupin the third film and is one of the best films ever made and now its back. This re-release comes with all 4 dubs for the movie:
The Japanese 1979 Dub w/ Subs Ft. Yasuo Yamada As Lupin The Third
The Geneon/Pioneer Dub Ft. Tony Oliver As Lupin The Third
The Streamline Dub Ft. Bob Bergen as Lupin The Third
And The Manga UK Dub Ft. Bill Dufris As Lupin The Third.
All 4 Are Fantastic With My Personal Favorite Being The Geneon Dub.

Plot: The Headlines All Read ""Lupin The 3rd Is Dead"" But Inspector Koichi Zenigata/ Detective Ed Scott Refuses to belive that Lupin Is Dead. He Investigates The grave to find Lupin alive and breathing. Then The Chase Begins Again! Lupin Steals A Stone From A Egyptian Pyramid For His Lover Fujiko Mine. It All Goes Well With The Help Of Goemon Ishikawa The 13th But A Conspiracy That Nobody Could've Seen Coming Unfolds And A Man Named Mamo Threatens To Destroy The World With Only Fujiko Mine To Live On. The Fate Of The World Rests In Lupin The Third And His Gangs Hands!",1361923200,3,1081,4.378109452736318
2737521,4,6305090246,"This is the 1995 Streamline/Orion dub of the first LUPIN THE THIRD animated film from the late 1970's, which has many titles but here is called MYSTERY OF MAMO. Pioneer would redub it roughly ten years later when they had the LUPIN license as ""SECRET OF MAMO"" and while that is probably an easier disc to get your hands on, this is the superior dub. The translation is closer and the jokes are less topical. This disc was released by IMAGE ENTERTAINMENT during the brief period of time when Streamline shut down their anime business in the mid to late 90's (basically after Laserdiscs were long dead) and before Pioneer/Geneon got the rights to LUPIN. That means it is a DVD from about 1997-1998, and as such it is bare bones. The menu is a bit weird and there are really no extras, not even a subtitle track. But for those who just want the best dub of this flick, this is the release for you.

The plot centers around Lupin the Third stealing several items to try to win the love of constant rival Fujiko, much to the chagrin of his allies Jigen and Goemon. This ultimately leads to a confrontation with the mysterious Mamo, a villain who puts most Bond villains to shame. Love him or hate him, Mamo is a very memorable foil for Lupin, which is key as many of his villains in his films blur after a while.

The voice cast put in excellent performances and if you can nab this for under $40, do so!",1260835200,2,1399,4.35632183908046
2737522,1,6305090246,"I love this movie, but it is a simply atrocious to release a Japanese movie on DVD without including the original Japanese language dialogue as an optional audio track.",933206400,27,168,4.827586206896552
8170262,5,6305090246,"An underrated classic which in my opinion stands right alongside Cagliostro in terms of overall quality and entertainment value, but for entirely different reasons. This is a more hard-edged interpretation, but still has everything that makes the series great. The dynamics and drama between the main cast in this film is really well done, and there are a lot of great action set pieces. And while the animation overall isn't as refined as it is in Cagliostro or Fuuma, the extremely stylized designs and hard-70's style that bleeds throughout the film more than make up for it. Highly recommended if you're a Lupin fan looking for an entry that's wholly unique, more mature, and also just a tad bit strange.",1519430400,,708,4.908333333333333

8170269,2,6305090246,"Just finished watching ""Lupin the 3rd - The Mystery of Mamo"" released by Eastern Star Inc.
Not exactly sure what to make of this re-released entry in the Lupin series.  All the elements of what makes a Lupin adventure great silly fun to watch are here in this movie; but the way-out science fiction detour this movie takes makes it a bit difficult to watch.
The near immortal Mamo is busily putting the finishing touches on a 10,000 year plan of his to rule Earth.  Why it took exactly 10,000 years to complete is never really explained in the movie.  The movie starts out with Lupin's execution - he's been hanged for being a thief.  Or has he?
It turns out Lupin is very much alive - but is he the real Lupin?  Mamo does love to clone people.  Interpol Inspector Zenigata doesn't believe the news of Lupin's demise and sets off to Egypt where he believes Lupin is at and in the process of stealing an artifact from the Great Pyramid.
Lupin gets the artifact, escapes from Zenigata's well laid trap, and meets up with Fujiko -called Margo in this English-dubbed version-in Paris where she knocks him out with a sleeping gas and steals the artifact - all in a bid to secure Mamo's promise of eternal life and youth - Mamo is smitten with Fujiko/Margo.
Naturally, Lupin's friends are miff and they split up from him citing that Fujiko/Margo is a really bad influence on Lupin>
Lupin sets off on his own to find Fujiko/Margo and unravel the mystery of who and what Mamo is.
Not the greatest of Lupin movies, and should not be the first Lupin movie anime fans should watch if they are curious about Lupin.
Disappointing.
Not Recommended even to Lupin fans.
Two Stars.",1433030400,2,1664,4.53
8170270,5,6305090246,"Excellent release of a Lupin classic.

The movie, while not the best, is still a great movie for any Lupin fan, and probably most anime fans. Streamline did a great job with the dvd, it looks great. I don't know how they did it, but they managed to track down, and obtain rights for, and include FIVE different English dubs on the dvd, each has it's own charm.",1414108800,,360,4.294117647058823
8170271,4,6305090246,"For years Mamo was an expensive collector's disk, now it is out in the best and cheapest release ever, so you can add it to your collection without punishing your wallet.
This is a Lupin movie, self contained and wide screen. While Lupin may not be the best anime ever made, it is definitely one of the great comfort foods of the anime world. It is warm and comfortable and you feel better after having watched it.
The other advantage of Lupin is that it is generally good for all ages, though this movies does have a few non graphic deaths and an little bit of nudity. Young and old alike can enjoy Lupin.

This Discotek/Eastern Star release is even more top notch that the others I have acquired since starting my Discotek binge.
The audio as was mentioned in the other review contains 5 language tracks. 5! 4 in English and 1 in Japanese. If you love dub you can pick and choose. There are differences in the voicings, volume level, audio quality, and big differences in the regionalizations. If you hate dub, there is 4 times as much dub to hate!

The presentation as I mentioned is wide screen (you may have narrow black bars on the edges as it doesn't fill the screen completely but is not 4:3) and had been cleaned up very nicely. Crisp vibrant colors like the other recent Discotek offerings.

All in all another great re-release of a classic. This leaves me waiting for the next one.",1362009600,10,1392,4.47244094488189
