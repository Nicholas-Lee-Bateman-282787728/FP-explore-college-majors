8144187,5,B000I5XCYS,"if you are fan of late great carlos gavito, as I am. then you will find this disc worthwhile.  it is more of a tango star telling his story and style of tango than an educational disc.  if you are advanced and want to see what a star can do in his own great style than this disc is for you.  I bought and wasn't disappointed.  long beach ca.",1396396800,,341,3.898550724637681
