8160952,5,B000LC3JG4,love the workout - very practical and easy to follow along.,1492905600,,59,4.454545454545454
8160953,1,B000LC3JG4,Very disappointed! I've seen better suggestions for how to walk in heels in fashion magazines. Save your money...the secret here is not worth the price of admission.,1447804800,,165,5.148148148148148
8160954,4,B000LC3JG4,"Wondering what the big secret/how-to of walking in high heels is?  It's posture & leg strength.

The video covers both, although not equally (really, how long does it take to explain proper posture?).
In looking over the other reviews, I would agree that that the big downfall of the video is it's length.  Although, who actually wants to watch a 2-hour film on how to walk?  Furthermore, to see exercise results, it takes longer than spotily following a video for a week or two.

The other issue that comes up frequently is:  ""It's just an exercise video with only a few minutes on how to walk properly in heels.""  Hmmm...  Well, the secondary title is ""The Secret to Sexy High Heel Walking.""  Might that not suggest that having strong, fit ankles/legs/hips is the secret to walking well & safely in high heels?

Honestly, as someone who recently had a bad ankle injury, I bought the video as a way to rebuild my lower-body strength.  The exercises included were slightly more advanced (with optional, easier modifications) than the ones that my physical therapists had prescribed to me, but they worked the exact same muscles.  In talking with my physical therapists about re-building ankle strength & flexibility, most of the exercises I was assigned focused on strengthening muscles in my hips and thighs.

Buy this video if you want to strengthen your lower body properly, and thus, protect yourself from high heel injuries.",1337385600,4,1429,4.8796680497925315
8160955,3,B000LC3JG4,"Some good tips, but not a workout video I used more than once or twice. The video quality is mediocre.",1303689600,3,102,4.15
8160956,1,B000LC3JG4,"The initial 10 second clip that we can all see IS the only part that you will see in this video talking about how to walk in high heels.  This DVD is a workout video for your legs and DOES NOT FOCUS ON HOW TO WALK IN HIGH HEELS!!!  I'm looking for a video that will show me how to pivot, stand straight and walk properly at the same time and how to walk in different shoe heel lengths.  This video does not do it at all!!! It is a waste of money!!! I'd like to see a video that teaches people how to possibly walk in heels up or down a few flight of stairs without falling on your face. Plus learning how many inches a basic two step in high heels would help.  There are a lot of people who would LOVE to learn the art of walking in high heels and feel confident at doing it, but this video DOES NOT TEACH YOU THE TECHNIQUE IN DEPTH.  THIS WAS A WASTE OF MY 20 BUCKS!!!  IT'S JUST A LEG VIDEO, YOU CAN WATCH THAT ON THE EXERCISE CHANNEL ON DEMAND!!!",1274832000,2,949,3.8911917098445596
8160957,4,B000LC3JG4,It was a very good leg workout but it was a little fast. Also there was only a very small segment on how to walk in heels.,1223424000,2,122,3.5555555555555554
8160958,5,B000LC3JG4,"I have never been able to walk gracefully in heels so my close friend suggested that I try this video. I incorporated this into my workout routine and its a sure bet! I work out every other day to this video and have definitely seen results - especially when I go out dancing!! I now feel more confident about going to clubs and dancing in high heels. I'm able to distribute my weight more evenly and I can dance without wobbling or with the fear of falling or twisting my ankle.

These dancers know what they are talking about! Keep on doing this video and you WILL see results.",1185753600,5,579,4.3119266055045875
8160959,3,B000LC3JG4,"I thought this was an excellent idea for an exercise DVD. I love high heels but am chronically tripping and stumbling in them.
This DVD offered some good tips the best way to walk to maximize comfort, it also had some good exercises.
Overall, after a few weeks of doing this, I don't feel like I am any better at walking.
Also take notice, that it is a very short DVD, and does not have a variety of special features.
I don't feel like I got very much for my money.",1182211200,12,465,4.1208791208791204
