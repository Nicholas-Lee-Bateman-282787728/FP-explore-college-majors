2325125,2,B0009VGIL0,"No disrespect to the author, but the DVD wasn't what my wife and I were looking for. Thought it would feature a lady massaging a guy but was of 2 guys massaging each other.",1350172800,5,172,4.088235294117647
2325126,1,B0009VGIL0,"I found this a total waste of time and money. The examples shown were extremely repetitive and limited. The techniques for couples were exactly the same as the techniques for a solo. The entire DVD was more about breathing together as a couple and the extreme basics of body massage. It was supposed to be transcendental but only mentions a few points of yoga. It never explains chakras and for that mater actually NEVER EXPLAINS anything at all, it just presents one or two basic touch techniques. This DVD is slow paced, boring and shows nothing new .",1340582400,4,553,4.653061224489796
2325127,4,B0009VGIL0,i enjoyed watching this video. it showed a couple of guys doing things to the penis that i have never thought of before and i play with it a lot. my copy would freeze on me so i didn't get to see the whole video but i liked what i saw. A real turn on. my partner and i plan on trying some of these moves on each other ourselves.,1329091200,,328,3.7
2325128,2,B0009VGIL0,"Look, it's jerking off without release. I'm not sure what mushrooms these guys are on, but nothing in the DVD makes me ""see colors"" when my ""gateway to my consciousness"" is being stroked. It's a couple of average naked dudes touching each other's meat like they were at a 5th grade bible camp.",1326499200,14,293,4.547169811320755
2325129,3,B0009VGIL0,"I am a woman who bought the DVD to use with my husband. The techniques are easy to pick up, and my husband really enjoys them. Also, we have better communication in the bedroom now, which has allowed us to invent our own moves. In this sense, the DVD delivered, and I'm glad I got it. But we had to ignore much to be able to learn from it.

It's geared to a gay audience. At times it's campy and cheesy. For example, in the intro, Kramer stands in front of a six foot tall sculpture of an erection wearing a tuxedo with a carnation in the lapel. He refers to the massage as Taoist erotic massage, but doesn't explain what makes it Taoist. He also claims that it is c*** reflexology (his words), that each part of the penis corresponds to a different part of the body. It could have been interesting, but he abandons that line of teaching after showing us what corresponds to the head and the spine.

It teaches a really, very, super annoying breathing/moaning technique that the actors use throughout the entire DVD. The warm up begins with two nude men taking turns saying and signing, ""You are special among all my relations."" It's cringe inspiring. Then they move into a standing ballet-type warm-up with head, shoulder, and hip rolls. More viewer cringing.

The massage segment is shot well, though low budget. Kramer refers to the male member as the `magic wand,' and the names of the techniques are just as silly. The production value makes the product seem overpriced at 40 dollars. But we got good results. If you have a sense of humor and the ability forgive corny camp, you'll learn a few tricks.",1204588800,125,1606,4.512027491408935

8067492,5,B0009VGIL0,"I love it gives a true demonstration of male genital massage & male masturbation. Though i don't have a partner i love making love alone masturbation is very healthy for the mind,body, spirit,",1514764800,,192,4.848484848484849
8067493,1,B0009VGIL0,"Whoa, this is a bad-quality movie! It's hokey, cheesy, oh so very outdated, and the models are disgusting. Any interest in the educational benefit goes out the window by the extremely unappealing models and poor production of the entire thing. I asked to return it and fortunately was given a refund without having to pay the postage to return it.",1478736000,,347,4.8

8067497,1,B0009VGIL0,"This is stupid.  Highly staged, and pretty much just a nice massage of the guy.  No real special or unusual technique shown.",1394323200,2,124,4.590909090909091
