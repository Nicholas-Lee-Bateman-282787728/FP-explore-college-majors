2714030,1,B000LSBXH0,"I tried the half hour version of this video and did not even break a sweat, then I tried the full hour and could not finish it because I was falling asleep from boredom. The music is flat without any inflection. Ms. Moreno has zero personality, she takes forever to show the simplest of steps in the slowest way imaginable and then the actual dancing part is over in the blink of an eye. I don't know what kind of shape the other reviewers are in but this tape is clearly not for somebody who actually wants to bring their heart beat up, break a serious sweat or have a bit of fun in their exercise routine. Unfortunately I lost my receipt or else I would have returned it the next day.",1198281600,5,686,4.204545454545454
2714031,4,B000LSBXH0,"YogaGirl wrote a great review. I agree on almost every part.

The only thing I can add is there is no warm-up, but there is a short, walking w/arms raised breathing cool down for like 2-3 min.

There is a bonus standing 12 min abs workout w/some arms stretches since you use your ams as well for isomentric contraction & mostly working your obliques more then your abs, it actually is a decent workout for those who have don't have killer abs yet.

The bonus interview with Patricia looks like the same as her Dancer's body one which was nice.

There is still the bonus learn the moves step by step that she will spend several minutes on each simple move that is for people who are perfectionists or like to learn very slowly knowing evey nuance of a step which is a nice bonus though for morst, the 60 min is more instruction then almost any dance fitness video.

As yogagirl said, once you do it, you have to listen to the detailed instructions again which can be overkill after then 5th time. She is great with it, but... the 30 min will probably be the favorite part once you get it down. I only did the 60 min & I could follow easily & with mistakes that I could correct after 2 or 3 more viewings.

The moves are more hip rolls, hip bumps, cute stripper move, jump, mambo kinda to 4 corners, chasse kick step cross, hands side, side, up/down while knees swivel in/out, same thing on the other side, shimmy knees, ankle swivel walk, a kinda hip hop move, broadway leap... I may have only missed 2-4 moves in there.

It is a bit more high impact & not overly simple like Dancer's Body, but still very easy for even the most out of shape beginner. The music is better",1181174400,12,1670,4.2993630573248405
2714032,4,B000LSBXH0,"Ok.  I was skeptical about buying this dvd.  I was the one who trashed her first video because of horrible music.  I threw that dvd in the garbage.  This dvd is actually good, music included.

Setting:  The same studio and same dancers as in the Dancers workout video. The dancers wear sneakers or jazz shoes.  I did it barefoot.  Works best on hard wood floors

Music:  Smooth jazz with a definite beat.  You can actually groove to the music, sort of. Mind you it's not hip shaking music but it's better than that generic Kenny G stuff she used in her last dvd.

Choreography: There is a 60 minute and 30 minute workout.  The longer of the two goes over each step over and over again.  The shorter workout goes over the steps quickly and ends with 1 run through of all the steps.

The movement is jazzy, no ballet here.  Some leaps, turns, chasses, large leg movements.  She goes over each step many many times.  She does the routine 2x at the end.  My only minor complaint is so what happens after you learn the routine.  You have to go through the whole class again learning the steps.  She should have added a performance section where you can go through the routines as many times as you want until you break a sweat. One solution I found is that if you are watching this dvd on your computer, the full routine is chapter 21 (60 minute) chapter 25 (30 minute), on media player, and you can just repeat the chapters as many times as you want.  On the Broadway dance dvds, they have performance, step by step and work it sections. That way once you learn the routine, you can just go to the other sections and do it x times.

Also, there is no warm-up, stretching or cool down. The moves are fast but doable.  I got 95% of it at the tempo, the first time around.  As you learn the steps, you can make the movement bigger.

Overall:  Will I do this again? Yes but I don't know for how long.  I have been doing Soul Sweat for 3 months and I am still not tired of it.  That is because it's a workout instead of learning a routine and the real workout at the end.  I can see myself getting bored with the learning part after I already know the steps. I could use another dvd to warm-up and just go to the performance chapters and to do the routine xtimes, but that could get boring too.",1180051200,26,2285,4.234338747099768
2714033,5,B000LSBXH0,"i'm really impressed with this video.  i'm a horrible dancer, and every video to teach dancing that i've tried has made me cry with shame.  in the extras, there's a section where she breaks down every single move in the dance routine.  she breaks down every single movement and goes pretty slowly (plus, there's rewind).  i haven't worked up to incorporating everything into the 30 and 60 minute dance routines yet, but i'm just excited i can actually learn a move at a time!  that's more than i've ever accomplished before.  also, she's fun to learn from.  she has a contagious smile/mood and encourages you to enjoy yourself instead of worrying about getting everything exactly right.  that's nice :)",1179705600,10,702,4.840336134453781
2714034,5,B000LSBXH0,"I became a fan of Patricia Moreno after I bought her first dvd, Dancer's Body Workout, and after doing this workout, I am an adamant fan and follower.  The combinations are not for the uncoordinated, but are not difficult to follow, and there's always the rewind button if you need it.  The steps are fun and she's an excellent instructor, and there are both 60 minute and 30 minute versions of the routine.  It is an excellent video, and I highly recommend any video Patricia Moreno puts out!",1176508800,8,493,4.579545454545454
2714035,1,B000LSBXH0,"Outrageous video in my humble opinion. Definitely not for the time-conscious. However, if you don't mind the beginning of the video where Tony Little toots his horn with a brief synopsis of his life story of how he got into fitness, followed with the two newest success stories on his ""wall of fame"" (a la his infomercials), you might stay around (or fast forward) to get to his WORKOUT.
  First, you have to overlook the ""dungeons and dragons"" kid in him that appears in a skin tight suit and a huge ridiculous helmet with bull horns and dances around in it in his exercise ""ring"" for the ""freestyle"" warmup.  Tony also appears later in a ridiculous floppy ""cowboy"" hat in another segment, and throughout is eccentric and outragous. While holding a move, he says louder and louder, ""I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me"", a great scripture, but need he do it THERE, lying on the floor in his ""element"", showcased in ""disco"" lights in what looks to me like a wrestling ring? I didn't know how to ""take"" this. Was he ""repenting"" or ""making fun"" or expressing ""true faith"" or what? Who knows!  This will not appeal to everyone.
  If one can get past all the antics that took time from the WORKOUT, his exercise form and exercises themselves are great. For me, however, the positive aspects of his exercises were camoflaged by the distractions.",994291200,8,1362,4.677824267782427
2714036,5,B000LSBXH0,the most i like is that you make your effort class by class .and you get coordination and condition coordination and most of all fun,1359158400,,132,4.32
2714037,5,B000LSBXH0,"This is a fabulous workout.  The combination of the fast pace, intervals of an even faster pace and the strength training really works.  I am losing weight doing it every other day.",1325808000,3,181,4.625
2714038,5,B000LSBXH0,"I am still a fledgling (I suppose) to the whole ""exercise is part of my lifestyle"" reality as I have exercised with regularity for almost 3 years now.  During that time, I have done all kinds of workouts, both in the gym and at home.  In the process, I have lost 90 lbs. and have changed the shape, strength, and health of my body considerably (which I thought was next to impossible to do in my 40s).  I recently purchased and tried this workout; I found I like it very much.  It is great for giving me some cardio, strength training, and ab work.  It is not ""killer"" in that the moves are very possible for EVERY person to do, but it does combine the essentials that many good workouts untilize.  I really like Leslie's calm, rational approach to exercise as she tells you that you ""can't do it wrong!""  As with ANY workout, you get out of it what you put into it.  The bands are nice and compact which is cool, however, you could use any set of bands or handweights, as is the case with many workouts.  I will be using this workout a lot!  Thanks Leslie...you rock!! ;)",1324252800,4,1072,4.262376237623762
2714039,5,B000LSBXH0,Love this video but what is with the price?  This is double the price of anywhere.  Walmart had it for under 20 bucks when it first released.,1320364800,,141,4.185185185185185
2714040,5,B000LSBXH0,"These at home workout DVDs are fantastic!  I recently lost 25 pounds & needed a way to firm everything up and this is a wonderful way to do it in the privacy of one's own home at any time of the day or night, and best of all, here in Arizona, whether it's burning hot outside or too cold in the winter months, I can get my exercise workout every day in comfort.  You will be surprised how many calories are burned off and how good you feel at the end of each workout, whether it be 2 miles, 3 miles or 5! The time goes by very quickly and the DVDs are just plain fun! I highly recommend all of the 7 DVDs that we have recently purchased for a great, low impact exercise program and we plan to purchase more of Leslie Sansone's workout DVDs from Amazon!",1316736000,4,752,4.040268456375839
2714041,4,B000LSBXH0,"What I like:  It is a good, sweaty workout for me.  I classify myself as an intermediate exerciser (I probably walk 10 - 20 miles/week)and this is aerobic for me.  The work with the resistance bands is a challenge (however, if you're really going to tone those muscles you probably need more work with the bands than is offered on this video).  If you only have an hour to workout, you can get it all done with this workout and have some time to spare.  The footwork and arm movements give variety without getting ""dancey"" -- they are easier to follow than many routines on video.

Things that I'd like to change:  I miss the countdown clocks that show you how many minutes you have to work in each mile.  The background music is a little strange, but better than the music in many of Sansone's earlier workouts. I wish the stretching segment was a little longer.  I also prefer Sansone's own studio -- the background for this one looks like a gym with blank, white walls.",1316649600,2,972,4.446327683615819
2714042,4,B000LSBXH0,"I, like nearly everyone else who reviews Leslie's DVD's, have several of her workouts.  I've been althernating a number of the 3 mile workouts for several weeks, so I thought that this one would be fine.  Boy, was I wrong!  You can't just zone out on this DVD(as I often do with some of the other workouts) because she's changing what you do- you walk, you run, you use the bands, you do it all over again, but you still have to pay attention, especially with the bands.  The one thing that kept this from being a 5-star review was her counts.  I am very glad to see from the other reviews that I am not the only one who noticed that Leslie's verbal counts were off throughout most of the workout.  Why this happened or why it wasn't corrected/re-recorded, I have no clue, but it as annoying as heck to have her counts off.  Still, if she releases another boot camp workout, I'll buy it- as long as she goes back to counting on the beat.",1315872000,,937,4.259887005649717
2714043,5,B000LSBXH0,"I love the WATP DVD's. Leslie is fantastic... This DVD has just the right amount of cardio and resistance band use. Some DVD's I have used in the past have left me so sore and unable to work out the next day, this one does not. I am left feeling confident and refreshed.",1315526400,,270,4.113207547169812
2714044,4,B000LSBXH0,"This is a great workout! Very sweaty, very challenging and works all your major muscle groups. Since I hate to do cardio and THEN have to do toning this workout is perfect since it combines them both in one workout. HOWEVER, the bands are NOT good quality at all. Very cheap rubber which WILL break in no time flat. You can, however, buy a set of stretchie bands (also called thera bands) either here on amazon or on leslie's web site which are a great sub for these resistance tubes. I would like to inform people that you can buy this bootcamp set at wal mart for $14.00 even. So don't spend $41.98 for a new set here on amazon or even $22 + for a set from amazon's sellers. The set is located in Wal Marts Sporting goods section",1312934400,2,731,4.228571428571429
2714045,5,B000LSBXH0,I have been doing Leslie workouts for the past four years and when I say this workout is one of the best. I am challenged which has not happened with her workouts lately.,1312761600,,170,4.181818181818182
2714046,5,B000LSBXH0,"I love, love, love this bootcamp workout!  It is my first Leslie Sasone DVD, so I was not familiar with her moves as some other reviewers were.  I have not grown tired of it yet and I have been doing it for 2 weeks now.  I would like to challenge myself further, so I hope she makes another bootcamp workout with more intense training.  It is the only workout that I have ever tried and stuck with for this long.  It's AWESOME!!!",1311638400,,429,4.182926829268292
2714047,5,B000LSBXH0,"I've been doing Leslie's workouts for 3 years now.  I have lost 45 lbs and have been maintaining my fitness during that time (lost the weight in 4 months).  This particular workout offers some new steps, more challenge and a good mix of boosting.  I have a lot of her workouts that I rotate to keep exercise interesting and my body challenged.  The core exercises at the end are good too!  To add more challenge, if needed, I add ankle weights and/or her weighted belt to any dvd.  That really boosts any workout!  I was never a fan of exercise but Leslie has made it not such a chore for me and has gotten me in the best shape of my adult life! This kind of workout does break through plateaus for those that are already on a fitness routine. Definitely not for a beginner.  Thank you, Leslie!",1310169600,4,794,4.3175675675675675
2714048,5,B000LSBXH0,The 'boot camp work out is not for the beginner. It is for folks who have worked out and have built up to a intermediate . The directions and music are the reason why we are called Sisters in sweat..It works all muscles. Waking up some I never knew I had. Recommend it for all intermediate folks.,1308960000,,296,4.2105263157894735
2714049,5,B000LSBXH0,A have a few Leslie Sansone workouts and this one is my absolute favorite!  I was actually sore the next day and I am not new to working out.  It's a great workout that goes by fast and works the entire body.  Highly recommended!,1308700800,,229,4.159090909090909
2714050,3,B000LSBXH0,"This dvd wasn't challenging enough, and I'm intermediate-slightly advanced. Let's just say I'm not ready for Jillian Michaels yet. The bands weren't effective, especially the red one for the upper body, because it wasn't used much. Seems as if the dvd was made, with the music added later, because she was off-beat for most of the video. This Bootcamp dvd should've been titled, ""Baby"" Bootcamp Kit. I'll stick with Leslie's Fast & Firm 4 Really Big Miles, 5 Mile Fat Burning Walk, and 4 Fast Miles. Still love her tho.",1307750400,3,519,4.777777777777778
2714051,4,B000LSBXH0,"I've been walking with Leslie for many, many years.  I'm 58 and I've always enjoyed Leslie's workouts.  Over the past few years, I've been buying some of her different workouts.  This is a really good workout, and if you want to sweat, this is the one for you!  It's definitely a ""step-up"" from just the walking ones.  I did feel a little awkward at times because it seemed like Leslie was out of step at times and it took a few seconds to get in step with her.  I will definitely keep using this, but not on a daily basis.  I'll probably do this a few times a week and use the 5-mile fat burning walk and the punch up your walk with the weighted gloves on other days.  For a 45 minute workout, it went rather quickly.",1307577600,2,718,4.1521739130434785
2714052,5,B000LSBXH0,I picked this one up to add more variety and was surprised! I worked up a great sweat and was challenged. I am fairly out of shape so this was just what I needed. I burn about 400 calories every time I do it accoring to my HRM. So that makes it worthwhile. Definately give it a try!,1305244800,,282,3.8793103448275863
2714053,5,B000LSBXH0,"I've been using the walk @ home series for a few years now, off and on.  I started with the more simple dvd routines.  I ordered this one from Amazon a few weeks ago and was NOT ready for this workout!  IT IS INTENSE!!!  But its a great workout!  I'm glad I ordered and stuck with it.

Initially I was only able to complete the first mile and a half.  I kept at it every other day for about 2 weeks and have been able to complete the entire workout!  Be prepared to sweat, but you will feel fantastic when you are done!  Since beginning a consistent workout/walk program, I've shed about 11.5 inches and lost 34 pounds.  I really do recommend the Walk @ Home workouts.  You won't be disappointed.  I'm well on my way.  I have a goal of about 20 more pounds! This was a home run for Leslie's walk at home!

2714056,5,B000LSBXH0,"Love the Leslie Sansone Walk Weight Loss Bootcamp Kit I recently received.  I've used it twice and both times I thought, wow, why hasn't she done something like this sooner.  I have been a ""Leslie user"" for more than 10 years now.  I really liked this workout and felt great afterwards.  It's just enough to get your heart rate moving and the added strength training is perfect.  I especially like that I can get all that in within 45 minutes.  As a single mom of three and a full time student 45 minutes is about the maximum amount of ""me"" time I can spare these days.  Some complain of Leslie's chatter in her videos... and on some videos I happen to agree, but on this one she is explaining the importance of proper shape, she gives advice on breathing etc.  The one thing I would like to complain about or at least share a concern about is the  quality of the stretchy bands.  They seem like they won't last very long, but only time will tell on that one. But for now, they work great.  I like using them and can definitely feel the workout.

I love when she uses the boosted walking. The two bands included are a stretchier one for lighter work and a heavier one, which is for heavier work. The third mile is a boosted walk, then the cool down, floor work. There is no walk clock in this DVD, but it still goes by fast. The only thing I didn't like was stopping the walking to do the strength moves. This interrupts the rhythm of the walking, but I modify the moves and use the bands for an arm workout so I won't have to stop walking in the middle of the workout. The bands are good for me as are the basic strength moves, and they are helpful in strengthening my upper body.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Leslie-Sansone-Walk-Weight-Loss-Bootcamp-Kit/dp/B003F3NDS0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Leslie Sansone: Walk Weight Loss Bootcamp Kit</a>",1300492800,3,997,5.122699386503068

It is a little different from some of her other workouts with the figure 8 bands. It is not a ""killer bootcamp"" workout like some may be expecting, but it has decent toning moves, a good ab floor workout extra at the end and the workout itself flew by. I am in good shape already (skiing, backpacking, teach scuba) and tend to bore easily when working out at home. This one will be used often.

For a while now I wished she would create a workout that was a little more intense---this Boot Camp workout is just that--a little more intense.  I monitored my heart rate while using the dvd,and it stayed in the correct zone for most of the workout.  Also, the strength intervals helped me do more in less time  (instead of two separate workouts--a cardio and a strength--I got basically what I needed in one workout.  I recommend this dvd to any Leslie veterans who want to carry their workout to the next level.  The very good news (as usual):  This workout gets results but it is not sooo difficult that you just want to give up.  You can do it!  There have been many other (non-Leslie) workouts that were so difficult I just couldn't keep up and eventually gave up.

I have just enough time in the evening to do a 45 minute work out but sometimes it can seem like an eternity.  Not with this DVD.  The pacing is excellent and the strength exercises break up the routine nicely. The stretch bands that are included work great and I've seen an improvement in my arms already! I usually skip the intro and just do the three miles (which must be selected individually). I also appreciate that she put a floor exercise on the DVD as a bonus.

Miles 2 and 3 are the bootcamp with interval sets of walking, ""boosted"" walking, and strength training with the included bands.

2714090,3,B000LSBXH0,"It's typical Leslie Sansone, so if you've done her stuff before you'll be happy with this new DVD. Despite the claims, there are very few `new' walking moves - putting your heel in front/behind you while taking side steps is really the only `new' move. However, the new item(s) this time are stretch bands, which are used only in mile 2 of this 3 mile walk. Mile 1 is a warm-up walk, mile 2 uses the bands and it's basically boosted walk - band - boosted walk - band - boosted walk - band - about 6 times over. There is a lot of boosted walking, and that is tiring (in a good way). There are two bands included in the set, a yellow and a red, the red is slightly smaller than the yellow, but both are flimsy and might snap with overuse. You have to stop and pick up the band after each boosted walk, so you have to make sure the bands are right close to you during the 2nd mile. The 3rd mile is a still a fast pace/boosted walk, but doesn't use the bands as much. And then there is a cool down walk, and a final piece, which is about 15 minutes, is the core strength moves (on the floor). The final core moves can be done separate from the walk. The walking workout is 50-53 minutes long, and then the 15 minutes of core building. I like this DVD, but it won't be a fave. The cons: no countdown timer so you have no idea when each mile is nearing the end, each mile is about 15 minutes long - which makes for a really long workout, the music is the same music as many of her other DVDs, and she talks way to much. In her 3 Miles Slim and Sleek with Pilates there is an option to turn off her voice and workout to music only, which is great. One thing I did notice: I'm 5'10 and the bands feel too short for me. Anyhow, the bands are used for very basic strength moves - you won't get ripped doing any of this stuff, but it's enough to make you feel like you're doing something and that's helpful.",1283817600,41,1896,4.031830238726791

Within a couple of weeks, I could already feel that I was up to speed and ready to start tackling the longer walks and so I ordered the Walk Weight Loss Bootcamp DVD and I LOVE IT!!  The pace is just right and I feel like I'm walking right alongside of Leslie as she is so personable and makes everything so easy.  You actually look forward to exercising.  The two figure 8 bands are also easy to get use to and you definitely ""feel the burn"" after a few short minutes of use.  I recommend this DVD to anyone just getting started in a walking program (because you can stop it after 1 mile or 2 miles or go the full 3 miles)and know that you will get hooked like I am and want to start your day with Leslie from now on.

I had the same problem another reviewer noticed, which was Leslie being completely off the beat of the music.  It's almost like she recorded it with NO background music and the music was only added during the editing process.  Even trying to tune out the music and following Leslie's cues alone was no help, as she consistently did not synchronize her cues to the actual steps she was doing.  The toning exercises she demonstrated DID get my muscled fired up and I really wanted to like this DVD but after getting lost for the fifth time in a row I wanted to throw it in the garbage and demand my money back.

2714109,5,B000LSBXH0,"I've been walking with Leslie for a few years; she helped me lose 36 pounds.  So I'm very familiar with the music, moves, etc, from her workouts.  This latest, however, offers something completely new: her first boot camp style walk.  It comes with two ""figure eight"" bands; the yellow is lighter resistance, and the orange is heavier resistance, so you can work your way up.

This is a 3 mile walk which, with warm up and cool down/ stretch, comes in at around 45 minutes.  It's just you and Leslie, no other walkers.  The music is updated in this one and it's pretty good.  In mile 1, it's all walking with the four basic Leslie moves: sidesteps, knee lifts, kicks and kickbacks.  Some new moves are included here: a sidestep with heel crossed in front, sidestep with toe crossed in back, and a sort of box step that incorporates a knee lift.  I could definitely feel those moves hitting the harder to reach areas of my legs.

Miles 2 and 3 consist of 5 intervals: 2 minutes of brisk walking, 1 minute of ""boosted walking"" (jogging) and two minutes of strength training with the Figure 8.  The strength training uses basic moves such as bicep curls, tricep kickbacks, chest presses, lunges, and an upper back exercise.  The intervals REALLY pumped up the walk.  Using the ""boot camp"" interval style is supposed to keep your metabolism revved and burn more calories; I could feel every muscle in my body got worked with this one.  As an added bonus, it goes by fast.  This would be a great introduction to Leslie; or, if you've been walking with her a long time, a great way to shake things up.

The moves are uninspired and have little to do with dance today.  The choreography reminded me of the worst kind of jazz/Broadway routines that you might see on a cruise ship ""80's Night"".

2714114,5,B000LSBXH0,"This is a lot of fun, it's all dancing so you better like dancing.  It's fun and energetic. Great ab workout included on dvd and there are two options for the dance workout, 30 min and 60 min.  It goes by quickly and you get a great workout.",1199664000,3,241,4.0
2714115,1,B000LSBXH0,"The routines on this video were so slow and lackluster; thanks to the many, many pauses to learn the dance steps, my heart rate never rose, and I never broke a sweat. Moreover, the music was awful: canned elevator music with no beat, and Patricia Moreno's demeanor was very irritating and condescending.

I am certainly not a dance expert, but there must be a way to incorporate dance moves into a lively, upbeat aerobics routine that keeps you constantly moving and thus gives you a good workout! If high-impact exercise is what you are looking for, leave Patricia Moreno and her simpering smirks on the shelf.",1199664000,3,611,4.764150943396227

8164154,3,B000LSBXH0,"I really like Patricia Moreno. I have a number of her DVD's that I use regularly.
This one was a bit too much for me. Maybe it is because I don't know dance moves.
The format of her DVD's is generally to give instruction on each section and build on it.
The sections just never ended. Before I could ever come close to putting it together she was adding another section.
I really want a good workout but when I am stumbling around I tend not to work up a sweat. I suppose if I practice and practice and practice I could eventually get it,  but since I have other options I will work out to those.",1452384000,,596,4.094017094017094

8164156,5,B000LSBXH0,"I've had numerous back surgeries, early stages of PD and I've found that this workout is spot on. Whenever I want a HITT exercise this is it for me. I've read reviews here that state it's a ripoff and it's off base. Well, they are wrong it's a perfect workout and I am glad that I took a chance and bought it. If you are looking for a cardio workout that can get intense for awhile this is it. Believe me it's definitely a great workout and you can burn around 320-375 calories depending on your weight and let me just say definitely worth the money. There's no risk just another way to help you on your health journey. :)",1425772800,,622,4.191666666666666

8164160,5,B000LSBXH0,This was a pleasant surprise from Leslie Sansone's previous dvds .  It's a little different with new moves and steps. It does break a sweat if you adjust to a faster pace for more advanced workout. Love the strength training and intervals. The bands are not that durable and will not last. You need to purchase a set of strong bands. This is a great buy but hard to find now.  I found it a Walmart  about 2yrs ago and I have also seen it on Ebay.,1394668800,,446,4.103448275862069
