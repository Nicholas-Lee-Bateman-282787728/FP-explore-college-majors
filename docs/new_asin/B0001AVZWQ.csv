1985464,5,B0001AVZWQ,"I was fortunate to have seen this film when it came out, and I will not repeat the very good reviews it got at the time.  I will say, though , that the acting is superb (it is worth price of the DVD just to watch what Tim Curry does with his character)and the film gives a wonderful sense of Place without depending on cilchs about the currently fashionable Cajun culture.  I would also like to complement the writing: the characters are engaging and there are some surprising plot twists - not the kind that are out of character or anachronistic, but the kind that make us realize just how little we were ever taught about this era in American history. Highly recommended.",1083456000,,673,4.463414634146342
1985465,5,B0001AVZWQ,"I had just finished watching this film and I must say, I had enjoyed it tremendously.  The scenery was beautiful and captured the true essence of the bayou.  The story was compelling and really kept the viewer interested.  It was very well written and the dialog was extremely intelligent.  I must also comment on the wonderful acting delivery of Tatum O'Neal.  Far too long has this gifted actress been away from the screen. It was refreshing to watch how she interacted with her co-stars.  It was superb.  Her mannerism, expressions, and on screen charisma kept me enthralled through the film.  I was so glad to see her back!!
I will highly recommend this film to all who will listen!!! Enjoy!!",1082419200,,696,4.741666666666666
1985486,4,B0001AVZWQ,"THE HOME FRONT also know under a different title of: THE SCOUNDREL'S WIFE, is set in the era of World War II when espionage ruled and reigned supreme. Thus, making everyone suspicious of one another, unnecessarily. Particularly, of innocent people in a small community within the State of Louisiana in the United States of America. Especially of a widowed woman, as portrayed by Academy Award winning Actress - beautiful Tatum O'Neal. Who..., had to endure being shunned and ostracized due too wrongful character assessment by the minute minds of a fearful town, whose occupants obviously didn't get out, much. Narrow minds are easily influenced and expounded on by established traditions and the prevalent status quo. In addition too, being bound by a variety of fears, particularly 'fear of the unknown.' Any new person or idea, is perceived as a threat. Why? Because they don't think or stand on their own two feet and/or check things out for themselves. They just go with the dominant, flow. Regardless of whether it's fact or fiction, truth or assumption and so forth. And so, 'thought' to be a Nazi spy who had murdered her husband (O'Neal), prospective employer's were hostile even defiant in considering..., let alone granting her employment. Incorrectly, 'thinking' that she would set them up somehow and that they would all..., lose their jobs or worse. Again, assumption and actual truth based on facts, are not one and the same. Because groundless fears have no substance. And, unsubstantiated hearsay based on someone's inability or lack of desire too 'think things through' combined with a big mouth for the spreading of gossip by the local 'Town Crier', is meaningless and malicious. Their suspicions were attributed to assumptions with no proof. And, since this woman lived on the outskirts of town and her daily routines were unknown, the citizens of this village added insult to injury, by spicing up what they 'thought', she was doing. So much for the ""proof in the pudding."" Truth be told, this poor little town was filled with individuals whose perceptive density was not caused, by the fog. They didn't see, anything. They didn't hear, anything. And, they didn't want to be enlightened to anything, outside of what little they did know or 'thought' that they knew. Because unsubstantiated fear makes assumptions and presumptions and makes a point of taking hearsay and gossip as points of fact, too judge another, falsely. For what one 'thinks' is reality, is not the factual truth..., in reality. Thus creating a mental stronghold which they don't even realize, that they have. Yet, when you approach these types of people even nicely and politely, those that are confronted by the truth based on facts, often say: ""Don't judge me!"" Why? Because it rocks their 'little world' and they may have to apologize for being wrong. Pride - is often a huge stumbling block. As is stubbornness, narrow-mindedness and abject stupidity. But, be that as it may, one woman... finally and very reluctantly, gave the new comer (O'Neal) employment, and she persevered and was exonerated. Then, a Doctor moved into town and the two of them, fell in love. And, when tragedy struck, she again stood firm and in so doing, helped to save the lives of some of those who were intimidated and afraid of her, unreasonably. Thus, the once falsely maligned, hated and even despised - woman, turned out to be the widely appreciated heroine of them, all. This color, single-disc, DVD is not only entertaining, but it also presents the viewing audience with plenty of food for thought. Nina Kish",1260748800,,3587,5.0
1985487,2,B0001AVZWQ,"The story is very slow paced with the bad lieutenant, the bad priest, the bad ""doctor"", the bad daughter, the bad Chinese killing love interest, the bad son, the bad crowd, the prejudicial town folks with a thirst for blood and the high command wanting someone to hang... Who are you going to love? Not until the last few minutes do you find any redeeming qualities in; the Mother, daughter, son, priest and the doctor. The love interest is weak and the ""hidden secrets"" characters face are lacking in support.  The opening confusion that was to set the scene added more confusion than hinting at what was to follow. Read other reviews but this film is bad.",1238976000,2,657,4.615384615384615
1985488,3,B0001AVZWQ,"Scoundrel's Wife is a sometimes meandering, occasionally confusing little ""period piece"" indie film. The cast is generally good, and Tatum O'Neal's powerful screen presence is worth the price of admission, but it's still a long way from a 5 star film.",1187568000,,251,5.146341463414634
1985489,5,B0001AVZWQ,"I found this to be a very compelling movie.  There are so many issues that come up that it should provide good family discussion for quite a while.  First, the priest is not respected by the village people because he is an alcoholic.  The mother of the two teens was involved is a sin for which the townspeople have ostracized her and her kids for years.  A gypsy escapes for Germany early in the war, stealing the identity of a Jewish doctor, and is eventually sent to Cajun country to be their town doctor.  An inexperienced Coast Guard ensign is put under such pressure to find any locals who are assisting the German U-boats that are lurking in the Gulf that he resorts to setting up the ostracized woman as helping the Germans.

All this comes together in a climax that most traditional values families will find satisfying.  It is a story of facing up to one's past sins.  Unfortunately, it is done only tangentially in the context of a loving and just God.  Still, this is one true story that those who like moving drama will surely be glad they viewed it.  I don't know why it is 'R' rated because most of the violence is off camera, and nothing erotic is shown of the one love scene.  Indeed, virtually of the the terrible injuries the sailors suffered when the Germans sank their ships are shown in the context of the 'medical team' saving their lives.",1174521600,3,1362,4.473684210526316
1985490,4,B0001AVZWQ,"Ok, we bought this DVD because it was filmed on our area, our friends were extras and it was about our home town of Cut Off, LA. But we were surpised by how very good it really was. All the actors did a awesome job. They really captured that era and this culture. Over all, it was a very good movie and I'm amazed it didn't do that well over all.

BTW: I gave it 4 not 5 stars because the parts with the expolisions were very low grade to today's standards.",1120953600,2,457,3.967391304347826
1985491,4,B0001AVZWQ,"I think this is the best role I've seen for Tim Curray.  The Rocky Horror Picture Show was excellent, but it effectively ruined his career.  He's had many roles since, but none as convincing as this.

Tatum O'Neal was amazing.  My two images of her are the little girl in Paper Moon and as an adult in this movie.

The movie is not fast-paced.  Rather, it gives you an opportunity to absorb the time period and the mind set of people at that time.

This is a movie for people who want to connect, emotionally, with the characters in a non-artificial way.  I believe we saw some real acting in this movie, minus the typical hollywood glitz.  Emotions weren't jerked out of you, the just come out naturally.  There's not a character in this movie that someone can't identify with.

Tatum, you did an excellent job.",1105660800,2,812,4.493150684931507
1985492,5,B0001AVZWQ,"Moving World War Drama which brings a welcome return to the screen for the gorgeous TATUM O'NEAL after way too long an absence.  The Scoundrels Wife is well-told and played by all and benefits from a strong central emotionally charged performance by Tatum in a film which deserves a wider audience than it will probably get.  For fans of w.war drama's and Tatum O'Neal, you won't be disappointed!",1084838400,5,396,4.8088235294117645
1985493,4,B0001AVZWQ,"I think this was a really good movie.  It may seem a bit slow in places but that is usual for a drama -- I usually lean toward action or comedy myself.  However, this movie had enough going on so I didn't get bored.  A very interesting story line and the acting was superb.  The actors and actresses picked for this movie showed top class talent.  I was very pleased with this movie and gladly add it to my collection.",1084665600,3,418,4.175
1985494,4,B0001AVZWQ,"While this is only the begining of what is sure to be a very successful carier in film for Lacey Chabert, without a doubt this is her best work yet. The film is an accurate dipiction of life during this era and offers a very suspensful story that gains your attention from the beginning. Each character adds to the story and work together wonderfully. Any fan of Lacey Chabert of Tatum Oneal, this is a must see.",1083456000,2,412,4.363636363636363
8009438,2,B0001AVZWQ,"S L O W moving, and most of the people you meet do not develop into fully fleshed-out characters. It flits in and out of back-story but in a superficial, vague way that doesn't seem to draw you in. You're in the dark for most of the movie about the sins committed that drive the town opinion. Great actors, but weak writing in my opinion.",1492041600,,338,4.2153846153846155

Plus, shouldn't the main subtitles be of French origin instead! Keeping the movie b/c of Tatum but ultimately a letdown!",1413331200,,308,5.3061224489795915
8009446,5,B0001AVZWQ,This is a movie about my great grandmother.  Names were changed and changes for dramatic effect were taken but I loved watching it because Tatum O'Neal's portrayal was just as my great grandmother really was.  it was a very well done movie and I enjoyed it tremendously,1409011200,,269,4.702127659574468
