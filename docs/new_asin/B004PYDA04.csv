4482570,4,B004PYDA04,"I sure wish there was a list of compatable remotes for the Mickey Mote.  My Blu-Ray player is a Samsung and the remote apparently is not compatable with this thing.  Let's just say that a little 3 year old doesn't understand the word ""COMPATABLE"" and really gets upset when Daddy can't make something work for her.  Otherwise the videos are great on the DVD - Next time I'll skip the add on version, just in case..",1298332800,,414,4.421052631578948
4482571,5,B004PYDA04,"Disney has done it again- another wholesome, fun and entertaining set of Mickey Mouse Clubhouse episodes!  My girls, ages 4 and 5, are consistently captivated by these shows, and this DVD is no exception.  The shows encourage kids to think and to problem-solve.  These episodes reinforce basic skills like counting, sorting, completing patterns, days of the week, and identifying shapes.  The shows are full of interactive fun, music, and dancing with Mickey and company.  Each of the five episodes runs about 24 minutes, making them the perfect length for small kids.  This DVD contains the following episodes:

""Minnie's Masquerade""- Minnie and the rest of the gang plan a masquerade ball
""Minnie's Mouske-Calendar""- Minnie loses the pages of her calendar, and must find them and put them back together
""A Surprise for Minnie""- Mickey wants to come up with something special for Minnie for Valentine's Day
""Secret Spy Daisy""- Daisy leads the group on a mission to protect Clarabelle's secret recipe
""The Friendship Team""- The Clubhouse gang plans a Friendship Day party, but first they need to find the missing party hats

Though the episodes prominently feature the girl characters, I believe that the shows would be enjoyed equally by boys or girls.  I would recommend it.",1297468800,52,1276,5.155339805825243
4482572,5,B004PYDA04,"My daughter (who will be 3 next month), has been eagerly waiting for, what she has been calling, ""The Minnie Mouse Princess Movie,"" to be released.  She had seen the preview for it on tv, and every time we walked by the DVD's in any store, she would start looking for and asking for it.  Knowing how bad she wanted this movie, I went ahead and pre-ordered it from Amazon.  It arrived yesterday while she was napping.  So when she woke up from her nap, I presented her with her surprise.  She gasped, put her hands on her cheeks and squealed, ""The Minnie Mouse Princess Movie!!!!""  She was so excited when I put it on for her!  Our copy came with a cardboard/paper mask that she proudly wore throughout the entire episode.
  She was not disappointed in this movie.  Since yesterday afternoon, she has watched it probably 6-8 times!  Definitely a new favorite!  And definitely a must have for all the Mickey Mouse Clubhouse fans in your household!  Mickey Mouse Clubhouse episodes are educational fun!  Keep them coming Disney!",1297209600,15,1025,4.653631284916201

4482585,5,B004PYDA04,"My 1.5yr old granddaughter loves the Mickey Mouse Club series for preschoolers, and has several of the DVDs. She and I just watched this DVD together -- I gave it to her as a Christmas present. Mommy and daddy were glad to have a new one to watch, since the baby knows every show by heart. My granddaughter is fully engaged, sings along, names the characters, and dances to the music. There's lots of problem-solving choices in the story, and cooperation among the characters. Watching ""Minnie"" is one of her very favorite activities in a very busy little person's day.",1484006400,,569,4.7
