4330115,5,B004CYF73U,I'm a Super Fringe Fan - this was an Excellent experience seeing and hearing from the people behind creating and producing the show ... surprisingly a laugh a minute!!,1354233600,,167,4.793103448275862
4330116,5,B004CYF73U,I am an Amazon Prime member so this was included in my membership so maybe that is the difference but I found this very entertaining!  I laughed out loud multiple times!  It was fun to hear Anna and John's Australian accents.  They joked a lot on this but that made it funny.  I'm a huge Fringe fan and I liked this.,1352937600,,316,4.131147540983607
4330117,3,B004CYF73U,"I was very much interested in watching this DVD since I had purchased the one for Castle and enjoyed it very much.

There were 5 crew including J.J. Abrams, Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman, but only three actors: Anna Torv (Olivia Dunham), Joshua Jackson (Peter Bishop), and John Noble (Dr. Walter Bishop). I would have liked to have seen Jasika Nicole (Astrid), Blair Brown (Nina Sharp)of whom they did speak, and Lance Reddick (Broyles). They mentioned Leonard Nimoy who would appear in future episodes but this was old news. It was interesting to hear Ms. Torv and Mr. Noble's Australian accents as I had never heard their real speaking voices before.

I wish there had been closed captioning /subtitles as I didn't get a lot of what was said - especially since some comments were in-jokes. The moderator, Ken Tucker, kept touching his (balding) head for some reason -- maybe he was nervous, but he works for Entertainment Weekly and should be used to interviewing.

The show is 58 minutes long and I was constantly distracted by the quality of the film - it had a multiple vertical line texture which seem to change and distorted the people's faces when it passed over them - do not know why this was so and I used a DVD player and then tried my Blu-ray player - did not go away.

They had finished their first season and mentioned a commentary was finished for the DVD. I think the show would have been better after more seasons had passed.

There were strange comments like the moderator mentioned American Idol because Fringe followed it at first and that it was the ""spawn of the devil"" but he wanted Adam Lambert to win a/c he saw him while waiting for Fringe to come on (it always seemed to run over).

They had audience questions, all of which were really not answered - they joked about the questions or person asking. An example was that J.J. Abrams was enthralled by a gentleman's speaking voice - apparently broadcast quality - and he kept interupting the gentleman and then said he didn't hear what the man said because of his listening to his voice and not his words -- I am not sure if his question was even answered either. Another question was about the ""cards"" (actually glyphs), butterfly, apple, etc. etc., which appear at the end of each scene, was asked and they just said they do mean something = they are a code and there is a code in the code, etc.  I think this was actually revealed in the subsequent season DVDs but I haven't watched mine yet.

There WAS a funny part -- One of the audience questions was from a nice woman who asked if some of the strange things they saw ""Walter"" do might turn into the fact that he was a cross-dresser in the show and John Noble (the actor) started to tell a ""true story"" about cross dressing and Joshua Jackson intervened and said to ""stop this man"" from telling the story and he was very adamant about it so it was left alone.  That question from the audience was never answered either.  AND they did mention the cow amd had some jokes about that.

I really do not like it - very little was disclosed. I do not know if you should even rent this for $4.99.  It is disappointing and I will probably sell mine or give it away to a library.",1352678400,7,3203,4.456410256410257
4330118,4,B004CYF73U,"Over the last couple of weeks, I really got into Fringe and wondered how so many fans watched this over 5 years. What torture! Anyway, I love finding out more details and behind the scenes stuff of a good series and this hit the spot. It was good to see the actors' interpretation of their characters and the audience interaction. It was a good supplement during my withdrawal period after the series ended. I needed a Fringe fix!",1401235200,,430,4.5256410256410255
4330119,5,B004CYF73U,"Really enjoyed hearing from the cast, writers and directors.  We had recently finished watching the series and it was interesting to hear some of the behind the scenes and thought process that went into the show.",1388361600,,212,4.888888888888889
4330120,3,B004CYF73U,"I was hoping for more discussion of characters and storylines.  In the first season, I was very much intrigued with the character of David Robert Jones played by Jared Harris.  He's so good.  In fact, I'd like to see a panel with some of the secondary characters featured.  Blair Brown as Nina Sharp was simply stunning.",1383955200,,320,4.660714285714286
4330121,4,B004CYF73U,"fun discussion with the people behind one of my favorite shows.  The producer, director, writers, and stars weigh in on their a variety of topics, shared funny stories, and answered questions from the audience.",1383523200,,210,5.176470588235294
4330122,4,B004CYF73U,"This is similar to Inside the Actors Studio, where several of the cast and crew discuss their tie on the show and their characters.",1373328000,,131,4.5
4330123,2,B004CYF73U,"I watched the streaming version of this; there weren't any unfortunate video artifacts.

I found it irritating and frustrating.  The interviewer seemed very ill at ease, tended to stammer, spent a lot of time head down in his notes, spoke very slowly, asked long drawn-out confusing questions that the actors clearly had trouble keeping up with sometimes.  He set the tone for the whole thing which ended up with very little content and a confused style full of interruptions and in-jokes.  The writers were often sarcastic and not very responsive.

The audience questions were given short shrift.

The three actors came off very well and it was interesting to hear them speak in their own personas and with their native accents.  For me they were the worthwhile part of the show.

I did not pay (directly) to see this and I'm very glad I didn't.",1368748800,,846,4.786206896551724
4330124,3,B004CYF73U,"Parents should know that this unrated video has some foul language.  Specifically, at least one f-bomb and a couple GDs.

The interviews with the actors was interesting to hear their real accents.  This video appears to occur between seasons 1 and 2.  If you have already watched Season 2, you may not find anything interesting in this video.",1365465600,,342,4.844827586206897
4330125,5,B004CYF73U,"Fantastic! Nearly an hour long. I enjoyed the cast members answering the thoughtful questions by the moderator. I also like hearing what was behind the Fringe concept from JJ, Robert and Alex. Great video!",1360281600,,205,5.0588235294117645
4330126,5,B004CYF73U,"I'm of the opinion that Paleyfest content should be bottled with the seasons you buy on DVD/Blu-ray.  Judging it as a separate product seems a bit of a stretch for me.  However, if the price is acceptable to you, or your membership allows you to view it for free, then they are often very entertaining and insightful.

In this case, with Fringe, it was more entertaining than insightful.  With only 3 cast members present, I was expecting a lot of detail from J.J.  Sadly, they did not get very deep into the back story nor did they discuss future potential for the show.  However, this has its positive side as its relatively spoiler free if you are still making your way through the show (as everyone was when this was live).

What stands out to me is to see the actors/actresses when not on script.  Simply hearing them speak sheds great light on their talent as their native accent isn't remotely close to what we hear when they act.  Many actors, even some very famous ones, are the same on camera and off.  Its very rewarding to see those few who really transform their demeanor, mannerisms, voice, attitude, etc... for their roles.  You can clearly see that in this episode of Paleyfest.

What helps keep this event entertaining is the level of humor brought on by the cast and crew.  The jokes abound throughout their discussions even though we don't receive many answers to the questions we wished for.  If you are a Fringe fan, I can recommend this as a great way to help appreciate the folks that work to put together such a great show.  Its a well written, phenomenally acted show, and we can partly see why from this event.",1360195200,,1636,4.535836177474403
4330127,5,B004CYF73U,"This was made a couple of years ago, and I hope they do another interview before the show ends. It was nice to see the people who write the show talk about how they came up with the idea for it, and gives some perspective about the TV entertainment business.
I really enjoyed seeing the actors laugh and have a good time.
The only thing that was strange, was the dumb remark from an audience member about cross-dressing.
I liked the way John and Josh laughed it off.
Anna is absolutely beautiful, and plays her role on the show superbly, as do all the regulars.
Luv the show, and all the actors too.
Thank you for making Fringe a fun ride.",1357171200,,639,4.289256198347108
8423895,5,B004CYF73U,"The meeting with the authors, producers, and cast was very interesting. It allowed ""Peter"" and ""Walter"" to act a bit during this meeting.",1472515200,,137,5.0

8423903,5,B004CYF73U,Paleyfest coverage of your favorite TV Shows is fantastic. I can't believe I lived in CA for that long and never heard of it before. While you have to be a fan of the shows being covered to appreciate the panel if you are I highly recommend this series. Of note on this one is the exchange between John Noble and Joshua Jackson when Mr. Noble was asked about cross dressing.,1424390400,,374,4.28169014084507
