1037720,4,6305470456,"I'm performing as Demetrius in A Midsummer's Night Dream this November (2002) for my college, and I bought this movie to see another version of the play, and perhaps to get some inspiration for how certain scenes should be played out.
From what was there, it was excellent.  Finbar Lynch as Puck was a great interpretation of the character.  Definitely a racy version of this classic character, but it fits in well with how Shakespeare writes his plays to appeal to both the groundlings and the royalty (ie comical and slightly perverted humor vs. intelligent humor and themes).
Another thing to note is the fact that the actors doubled up on parts, something common in theater (especially during the time of Shakespeare), and in this play it adds more weight to the relationships between the character's ""fairy"" and ""mortal"" counterparts.  Alex Jennings does an excellent job at being Oberon.  He commands respect in his performance.  Same goes with his performance as Theseus, although we don't see much of him because of cuts (more on that later).  Lindsay Duncan does an excellent job at being Titania.  She conveyed the sense that she lived in a sensuous environment, and made this known when she was charmed to fall in love with Bottom.  But, because of cuts, her Hippolyta fell flat, and it made it difficult to understand why Hippolyta was so angry at Theseus in the beginning of the play, but came around at the end.
Desmond Barrit was an excellent Bottom, much better than Kevin Kline's in the 1999 production.  Bottom came across as a well-meaning, although slightly egocentric man that just wants to put on a very realistic play for the duke.  When confronted with Titania, you get the sense that he just rolls with the punches and accepts this new thing thrown at him.  His braying as a donkey is awesome, and I couldn't keep from laughing.  And the ""love"" scene between Bottom and Titania is absolutely hilarious.  About as raunchy as one can get while keeping all the actors' clothes on.
The mechanicals played their parts well too, although I wish they wouldn't have cut out the part in the woods where Bottom comes up with ideas on how to solve different problems, such as the lion with ladies problem, the wall problem, and the moonshine problem.  The one problem they DID address (the need for a prologue) was then cut out in Act 5.  Peter Quince never said the Prologue that he was supposed to prepare.  He instead jumped straight to the ""dumb-show"" where the actors played out the play quickly.  If one says they are going to add something, then it shouldn't be cut...
Which brings me to the one problem with this production.  The overabundance of cuts to the script and scenes.  One can notice I haven't mentioned the lovers at all yet.  That is because their parts were practically butchered.  The lovers are what tie the story together with the fairy land, and I didn't get a sense of that when I watched this production.  Lines were snipped, scenes split up, and an entire sequence was completely omitted, which serves to tie in several important parts of the play which dealt with the mortals.
First, Lysander and Demetrius I felt were mis-cast.  I felt Kevin Doyle would have been a better Lysander, and Daniel Evans would have made a better Demetrius.  Kevin Doyle's Demetrius comes across as flakey and a little slow.  Daniel Evans seems a little too angry to be Lysander, who is the slightly more sensitive of the two.  Yes, the parts are virtually interchangable, but Demetrius is not dimwitted, he just doesn't like it when there is disorder (the woods).  Maybe I'm biased because I am cast as Demetrius myself, but hey, that's my interpretation of the character.
The ladies fair much better though.  Monica Dolan did a good job at being Hermia, although there were times when I thought that she could have turned up her energy just a bit (when she had the nightmare about the snake.  I didn't get a sense that she was scared at all).  Emily Raymond's Helena was excellent, and one could really feel bad for her.  It's very easy for Helena's complaining to become annoying (as Calista Flockhart sometimes did in the 1999 production), but Emily avoided this with great acting.  One minor complaint though, she should have dyed her hair blond.  Helena, according to words in the script, is blond.
What angered me was that the second half of Act 4 Scene 1 was completely cut.  This is just too important a scene to leave out.  This is where Theseus, Hippolyta, and Egeus are out hunting.  In the first part, Theseus and Hippolyta finally make a connection because they both like hunting, and we, as an audience, see how Hippolyta finally falls in love with Theseus.  They then come upon the lovers sleeping (either naked or in torn clothing).  When they are awakened, Lysander tries to explain that it isn't what they think, and Egeus gets angry and tries to get Lysander executed.  Demetrius steps in and explains that he now loves Helena, but that he doesn't exactly know why.  This is enough for Theseus to overbear Egeus' will, and then invites the lovers to be wed alongside Hippolyta and himself.  It brings closure, explains why the four lovers end up in Theseus' court, and explains what happens to Egeus.  Without this scene (as this production did), one is left to wonder why they ended up where they are, and Hippolyta and Theseus come across as rather one-dimensional in their actions.
That, and the boy in this story was totally unnecessary, and I could not understand what he was doing in here.  The prospect of a young boy (not even in middle school yet) reading Midsummer is laughable, and it really made no sense.
Aside from those complaints, this is still the best film version of Midsummer that I have seen.  Maybe some day an uncut version of the play will be filmed, but until that time comes, this is a very good version to watch.",1034553600,11,5881,4.706744868035191
1037721,4,6305470456,"I saw this RSC production four times while studying in London in 1995, and also saw Alex Jennings in his Olivier-award-winning performance in ""Peer Gynt"" at the New Vic. (He is an amazing actor.) I bought this to be able to relive the experience of the play, and I was delighted to see that the performers and many of the props and set pieces were just as I remembered them. It is the best version of ""Midsummer Night's Dream"" that I've ever seen, stage or screen. It put some new twists into a centuries-old play and made it so hilarious in the process, but not by altering the story or anchoring it in an incorrect time period. In fact, there are many periods mixed together here and it works well as a ""dream"". They didn't have to add the part of the little boy; he was not in the original stage production, and he detracted from the story. I wish they had left the play alone and not added sets (Theseus' palace, the boy's home, the Rude Mechanicals' rehearsal area) that weren't in the original. They seemed out of place and took away from the magical atmosphere that was, fortunately, still there in the fairies' forest. I loved it that they kept the lightbulbs!",989020800,5,1168,4.462616822429907
1037722,4,6305470456,"I was fortunate enough to see the stage version of this production (same cast, same director, etc.) when the RSC came to Broadway in spring 1996. I loved the show so much that I went to two performances in three weeks.
The video preserves a lot of the most endearing characteristics of the stage show--the double casting (everyone except the four lovers has a ""mortal"" role and a ""fairy"" role), the slightly naughty atmosphere, the mystical world of the fairies. I was espcially glad to see that the ""forest of light"" set wasn't omitted--just as stunning on film as it was live.
  The cast here is top-notch. A number of the leads are Olivier Award winners, and it's easy to see why. Alex Jennings (Oberon/Theseus) is a treasure--as Oberon, he is commanding and masterful; and Barry Lynch is an impish, sexy Puck. All of the mechanicals are splendid, especially Desmond Barrit as Bottom. Among the lovers, Emily Raymond stands out--she really works to make Helena into a unique and sympathetic character. The actors here actually USE Shakespeare's words, instead of reciting them as poetry. How wonderful that all of these performances were preserved on film!
Having said that, I was surprised by some of the changes made to the production for this video. For one, why is the young boy included? During a few of the scenes, the camera is so focused on his reactions that the dialogue is pushed into the background. I also missed the original music--on Broadway, it was sort of Celtic, and the fairies had a beautiful dance in the final scene.
All in all, however, this is a fantastic film and the best adaptation of ""Midsummer"" I have seen.",986860800,39,1640,4.77112676056338
1037723,3,6305470456,"Why is it such a challenge to present Shakespeare as he originally  intended his play to be staged?  We COULD have Theseus and Hippolyta in  Greek garb, and create the atmosphere of Athens, but NOOO!  We have to  bring in bicycles and have Bottom and friends wear bowlers.  And to spruce  things up, let's put characters in the movie that don't even exist in  Shakespeare's play.  I have it, a little boy who falls asleep reading A  MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM (how original), and who keeps popping up in every  surrealistic scene.  And perhaps to cut down on the number of people we  have to pay, let's make Theseus and Hippolyta also be Oberon and Titania.  Yeah.... THAT'S the ticket.
Oh, yes.  Let's make the fairies.... FAIRIES!  Go on, Oberon, give Puck a big wet one right on the lips.  Perfect!  The  high schoolers will love it.
C'mon.  How about a performance without  gimmicks?  Do we really need Bottom and Titania to have really loud and  visual sex in a big umbrella?  I don't think so.  I think Shakespeare's  language and a little passable acting would do just fine.
If you want a  nice performance of A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM, I'd suggest the 1935  Cagney/Rooney version. It may be an oldie, but it's still a goodie.",959126400,56,1230,4.595348837209302
1037724,5,6305470456,"This 1996 film adaptation of the 1994 RSC stage production of A Midsummer Night's Dream is marvelous.  The acting is outstanding throughout the cast and the beauty of Shakespeare's language shines like a jewel.  The costuming and setting are a rather non distinct present day time.  The  stage design is quite different than anything I've seen before - quite  original and quite effective.  The woods around Athens are represented by a  blank stage with hanging light bulbs and various moveable doors about the  set.  Umbrellas are used in a number of unique and creative ways both to  denote scene changes and as the bowers in fairyland.  Also creatively used  is a doll-house.  Another unusual aspect of this production is the use  of a young boy and his dream as a framing device for the play.  The boy is  also the ""Changling Child"" and he observes each of the scenes and takes  part in the scene changes.  Fairyland is often the most difficult effect  for a modern director to conceive and Noble's concepts are both effective  and delightful.  The doubling of Theseus / Oberon and Hippolyta /  Titania also works to tie the storylines together thematically.  The  staging of the Pyramus and Thisby play within a play during the fifth act  is both touching and funny and again Noble's direction brings out  Shakespeare's messages about the nature of love in a most perceptive  manner.  My only criticism of the casting (and it is a very minor one)  involves the two female lovers.  As Shakespeare wrote the play, Helena is a  tall blonde.  In this production  Emily Raymond as Helena is a short-haired  brunette only an inch or so taller than Monica Dolan's long-haired brunette  Hermia.  Both actresses' performance is superb, and the similarity of their  looks does increase the confusion and emphasizes the theme of the lack of  reason when considering love.  Demetrius and Lysander are virtually  interchangeable as Shakespeare wrote them.  At 103 minutes, the play  moves along briskly and some cutting of lines must have occurred but the  cuts must be deftly handled because I didn't notice them.  All of the  famous passages are there as well as all the memorable quotes.  I consider  this production much superior to the more well known and highly publicized  lavish Hollywood 1999 production directed by Michael Hoffman starring  Rupert Everett, Calista Flockhart, Kevin Kline, Michelle Pfeiffer, and  Stanley Tucci.
 I give this production five stars.",956361600,39,2465,4.992555831265508
1037725,5,6305470456,"This movie is much better than the version with Kevin Kline and the other high-profile actors.  The sets were minimal but beatiful - they didn't try to drown you in scenery, but let you concentrate on what matters -  Shakespeare's language.  It is a little racy, as another reviewer said, but  Shakespeare wrote on many levels for all types of people, not just highbrow  aesthetes.  I'm not an expert but I love Shakespeare, and if you love  Shakespeare you'll more than likely enjoy this movie.",952732800,8,495,4.752941176470588
1037726,5,6305470456,This recent version of A Midsummer Night's Dream is absolutely gorgeous and perfect in every way.  The camera work id phenomenal.  I could just imagine William Shakespeare watching and enjoying every minute of this  beautiful production.  I'm sure that this is exactly how he would have  intended it to performed if he were here today.  Kevin Kline does things I  didn't know an actor could do... maybe his best performance to-date!  Calista Flockhart avoids doing anything that could even remind you of Ally  McBeal despite the closeness of the characters.  She is shockingly good and  pleasant as is everybody else.

1037846,1,6305470456,"I was looking for a production of our favorite play to show our small Shakespeare Club after we finished reading it aloud.  I really liked the stage aspect of this production.  I thought the scenes with the craftsman working on the play was fun and my students would gain perspective from seeing how these actors interpreted their roles.  Their drive to the woods was fun.  Also, I thought it innovative for Theseus to also play Oberion. This was true for several of the actors (including the Queen).  The sparse sets were interesting- I liked the use of doors to demonstrate comings and goings in the woods (and used elsewhere in the play).  This left things up to the imagination of the viewer but also left us to concentrate on the actor and his/her lines. There is a modern day boy who is shown first thing and then later throughout the entire production....one gets the impression that he is having the dream of Midsummer Night's Dream.  I thought this was really interesting.  The play scene done by the craftsman is fun to watch but it was marred by my wondering the whole time if the director was going to insert another sex scene.

Why I rated it so low..... Nearly from the beginning, I didn't feel the comedy aspect of this play.  For my purposes, I was looking for a production tha's ""clean"".  It doesn't have to be the most traditional version.  So, while I wanted to see that sparkle of fun, it wasn't the most important factor.  The first indications that this was not to be the right one was near the beginning. There was a kiss between Helena and Hermia and then later one between Puck and Oberion.  Kissing as means of a greeting and goodbye would have been quite appropriate but these were mouth to mouth.  It gave me the impression that the director was trying to inject more sensuality.  Why?  Overall, Puck was played in a very sensual manner.  However, the most disturbing part of this production was the scene with Queen Titania and Bottom though.  As Puck and Oberion and the other fairies look on, Bottom and the Queen have sex.  Really?  Where's the comedy in that?  And, this just does not seem to follow the spirit of Bottom's character.

If this was my first time to see Shakespeare, I wouldn't want to see more.",1390867200,2,2242,4.56390977443609
1037847,1,6305470456,Sent the wrong version the one they sent me had Michelle pfifer in it and I was not happy so instead of exchanging it they just gave me my money back which really didn't make me happy I wanted this movie this version I have seen it on television and it is fantastic.,1375488000,,266,4.037735849056604
1037924,5,6305470456,"This is the fourth rendition of Shakespeare's play I have seen on the small screen, and it is possibly the best so far, with the one reservation that it emphasizes one aspect of the play which I am not sure the Bard would have made quite so weighty. It is filled with modern gimmicks used to emphasize this aspect (which I am not revealing, should that be a ""spoiler"" for some.)

One of the gimmicks in the play is that Theseus and Hippolyta are played by the same actors as Oberon and Titania and the Puck / Robin Goodfellow actor also plays Philostrate, the master of the revels. These fit, each for a different reason. The story is primarily about four pairs of men and women, and their relations, so it is a neat conceit to have two of those pair played by the same actors (although the costuming and makeup effectively hid that fact until I saw the credits.) I recognized the Puck / Philostrate dual role easily, partly because those who know the play easily think of Puck as the major domo of the entire story, not just the play within a play.

Of the three main stories in the play, this version gives more attention to the story of the fairies and to the plot with the six ""mechanicals"" than it does to the story of the four young lovers. This is accentuated by the fact that Lysander and Demetrius wear similar garb, almost like a uniform, in order to add credence to part of the Puck / Oberon business.

The story of the ""mechanicals"", especially the role of Bottom, is not quite up to the realization of that role by the cast of the 1999 Hollywood version, with Kevin Kline as Bottom, although overall, I prefer this film to the Hollywood version. There is something very reminiscent of the ballet in the way the business of the actors is blocked out, with surreal props of doors without walls and light bulbs hanging from bare wires to act as the stars. Oberon, Titania, and Puck are done better than in the Hollywood version.

This version clearly adds to Puck's final monologue things which were cut from the Hollywood version, just as it cuts speeches from the story of the four young lovers.

It is almost impossible to recommend this over the Hollywood version, which is easier to understand and follow, especially with all the familiar faces in the main roles. The Hollywood version has a better balance between the three stories, which means that the peril faced by Hermia is given its proper importance; although this version does a better job at showing the effect this situation has on the relation between Hippolyta and Theseus. I would watch the Hollywood version first, then watch this version.",1370736000,,2619,4.575692963752665
1037925,2,6305470456,"This is my favorite play of Shakespeare's and they treated with the
same sort of care as Sam Raimi did with Spider-Man 3. At first, I
thought Lysander's Irish, that's sexy. His delivery wasn't right. I was
pleased with their idea of making Hippolyta and Theseus and Titania and
Oberon played by the same actors, but I didn't really like the actors.
Puck was sexy, but I couldn't hold back my repulsion from the
fairies. This is the type of stupidity that would be expected from
Playhouse Disney. And what was Macaulay Culkin doing in this?",1341792000,,539,4.625
1037926,3,6305470456,"All the words are there. The pacing is appropriate. That is where it stops. From here the presentation deviates with an overlay of a minor observer that smirks as he views the scenes.

Only occasionally moving a play to a different time or place can it keep its magic. This presentation is of no real time or place but seems to have borrowed from the junk left over from previous plays, containing part stage and part Victorian England, with a dash of Alice in Wonderland.

Lots of nice color and music. However everyone goes around kissing everyone but the person they should be kissing; you can call it artistic license but I call it a distraction for the purpose or base story. For those people that do not like the introduction of bicycles and nudity as in another version, take heart as there is no nudity or bicycles. The bicycles are replaced with Mary Poppins type umbrellas. O.K I lied there is the E.T. bicycle scene, motorcycles with sidecars motorcycles.

Usually this tail is played out by well know actors so I must confess that even though this is the Royal Shakespeare Company production I do not recognize anyone.

One big missing part is where Nick Bottom is transferred into a donkey. Too bad as that is one of the best parts. He just pops put with ears and teeth. That is like showing Hamlet without Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

1037929,1,6305470456,"I have seen many different versions of A Midsummer Night's Dream and this is by far the worst!  It is not only absolutely ridiculous, but poorly acted and badly misinterpreted.  The only interesting interpretation that I took from it was the idea of Titania and Oberon being played by the same actor/actress as Theseus and Hippolyta.  That is the only good thing that I can say about it.  That idea brought in a new interpretation of the play and a different twist to it in the end, which was interesting.

Otherwise, the film was more like a creepy nightmare than a funny dream.  It is odd to me that so many of the film versions tend to forget that Midsummer was a comedy.  Shakespeare included so many funny lines in this play that often get overlooked and butchered....Unlike others, I did not find the sex scene between Bottom and Titania offensive--just stupid (and I mean that).  Also, as others mentioned, the story is told from the perspective of a boy, which some have suggested is supposed to be the Indian boy that Oberon and Titania are fighting over, but that seemed unlikely to me (and if it was the case, it was not clear--especially since the boy was blond and Caucasian); instead the boy just seemed random.  I do not think that this is a child's play; therefore, I found it troublesome that this film was presented as one.  Lastly, the stage, which was painted odd colors and had random doors, made the scenes feel bland and cold to me.

As far as interpretations and acting go, I felt that many of the lines were poorly delivered and interpreted.  There seemed to be many instances where I wondered whether the actors/actresses knew what their lines meant.  Their faces did not communicate the emotion that their words needed.  The actress who played Titania/Hippolyta I felt was the worst (though maybe it was the interpretation that the director gave her).  Hippolyta is a strong warrior, queen of the amazons, and she has been kidnapped and forced to marry Theseus, now there is no saying exactly how she would represent herself in this situation, but my guess is that she would not be smitten with Theseus.  Also, she slaps him, which is supposedly the rebel in her coming out, but if she is a strong woman than a force stronger than her must be keeping her with Theseus; thus, why would she slap him?  It just doesn't make any sense to me.  I had similar issues with her interpretation of Titania.

After all the film versions that I have seen (2003, BBC--1981, 1968, 1935, this one), I hold that the 1935 version is still the best (there are flaws, but at least it's funny--I wish someone would do a better job).  I was hoping for a new, innovative and creative adaptation in this film and, unfortunately, I was incredibly disappointed.  Don't waste your time or money on this; you're better off acting it out yourself.",1275004800,4,2845,4.627490039840637
1037930,4,6305470456,"What one takes away from this production is the triumph of the artistic direction and the splendid performance of Alex Jennings as Oberon/Theseus.  While I certainly liked other aspects of the experience, as a whole it left me a little cold.  Much of this, I suspect, lies in severity of the cuts, most evident in the handling of the main plot (the Oberon/Titania quarrel is a sub-plot, after all-- although one wouldn't know it from this adaptation).  True, there's not much difference between Demetrius and Lysander (which is sort of the point, I suppose), but, in this production at least, I never cared at all for Hermia and missed Helena's comic self-pity (trimmed as it was).  To be even more frank, I didn't find one of the four principal lovers' performances to be more than competent (although one should not take even this for granted in a filmed production), much less memorable.  Others have spoken derisively of the boy's dream that frames the play, but I thought it was an interesting conceit, if not terribly original.  For the life of me I can't understand why it is so controversial here since he speaks no lines, and his presence allows for some very interesting point-of-view shifts.  On the whole, I would recommend it, but as far as filmed adaptations go, I probably still prefer the (slightly stodgy) BBC filmed production from the early 80s (which, it will be admitted, has a host of problems of its own).  In terms of imagination of conception, however, this one is truly remarkable and should not be missed by fans of the play (everyone, I hope).",1266796800,3,1571,4.771217712177122

The costuming is beautiful as well.  So, if you like Shakespeare - you will enjoy this ... just try to ignore that creepy, ubiquitous silent and smiling boy.",1190419200,2,732,4.658914728682171
1037933,3,6305470456,"Greetings,

Right off I'll say this much: I like (Note the use of personal opinion here not global statement) this version much more than the nightmarishly Hollywoodized 2003 one with Kevin Kline and Michelle Pfeiffer.

This version is a bit of extremes. On the one hand it's an excellent portrayal of the Bards work is some ways and in others directly contradicts what many masters of his works consider paramount at times.

The Good:

Well, personally I like the colors and allusions in the motifs of light bulbs and umbrellas. The contradiction of a normal stage, set and settings in the human world and this, oh...quasi-minimalistic, surreal approach when in the woods worked, at least as far as this member of the audience is concerned. Of course there are the basic prerequisites that were matched (This IS the Royal Shakespeare company after all) of wonderful acting, yadda, yadda, yadda and so on, good casting, blah, blah, blah. For me though what makes or breaks these kinds of immortal works are the little things. The physical gestures, facial expressions etc. Oberon is perfect for example, the bare feet, the flowing coat hanging literally all over the young lovers who play their part perfectly by not acknowledging this rather large fellow actor breathing in their ear. Puck too works well. 'Proud Titania' certainly was amazonian enough; protrayed as a bit of a stick in the mud which went a far way to showing her greater, oh, let's say moral authority over her king; though the fae have no concept of morality, but I digress. The 'Human' characters were also quite fun getting yanked this way and that and playing the roles well. Though, as should be evidenced by this review, Oberon and Puck were my personal highlights.

The Bad:

As in The Good, it's the little things. In this case the sex scene with Bottom and Titiana. Um... As I've also said this IS The Royal Shakespeare Company so I have to wonder what industrial accident happened near their HQ to induce a dementia to the point where someone thought a sex scene was a good idea? One of the major charming points regarding Bottom is the idea that he is an innocent. A prime point of this comedy is how Titiana, who is a Fae Lord for God's sake, one of the most beautiful and enticingly sensual creatures in the history of time, is throwing herself at this mortal and he doesn't even notice being much more charmed, in his childlike manner, by Mustardseed and its kin. The actor who portrays Bottom is a good physical actor, he's just not a good physical actor for Bottom.

So, as I said, this is a creature of extremes in productions of Midsummer Night Dreams. Get it for Oberon and Puck, pay no attention to the kiss, it's a gesture of servile devotion- only a fool associates mortal definitions to fae actions. Avoid it for The Bottom of Bottom and Titian portrayals. Personally, I find Oberon and the young lovers actions and presentation to be of greater value than the detriments caused by the flawed writing and directing that birthed the Titania and Bottom fiasco- but that's not my call to make globally.

The Neutral:

These things did little to harm or add to the play. They came across as 'Charming' or 'Odd' but did not much add pro or con to any sum total of mental assessment as far as I'm concerned. These would be things like- The  Umbrellas, the light bulbs, the feathered hair, the running through doors, the portrayal of the dream as a dream, maybe, and the boy who pops up now and again who I like to think of as 'The Witness'. Really the only thing that's worth commenting on regarding The Witness is how this young actor is apparently also in the Anthony Hopkins version of Titus, directed by Julie Taymore where he has has much the same role until the last third or so. As I said, a bit odd.

I remain, as always,
Mad-Hamlet",1189036800,31,3826,4.628318584070796
1038014,1,6305470456,"I had a couple of major problems with this version of ""A Midsummer Night's Dream.""

The little boy -- Titania's changeling? -- who kept cropping up was just one of those conceits that directors and screenplay writers feel that they have to slip in there to keep the story interesting. As if the story needs to be made more interesting. *sigh*

I don't mind the representational forest and the umbrellas and all that, but PLEASE don't write parts for characters that aren't even part of the original play.

The other thing that sent me over the edge was the extremely graphic sex scene between Bottom and Titania. They weren't naked, but the sex was VERY VISUAL accompanied by moans and sighs. It was completely gratuitous and it offended the hell out of me since I was sitting there watching it with my two young daughters. What is the deal with this? It was far, far more than the bawdy talk and suggested action in the play that would go straight over their heads anyway. No, the director and screenwriter felt that we needed to see Bottom thrusting energetically between Titania's splayed legs.

That ruined it for me. Adding the role of the boy in was bad enough, but adding in the frank sex scene was just obnoxious.

DO NOT buy this movie if you intend to watch it with your children.",1156204800,32,1290,4.567099567099567
1038015,5,6305470456,"The Royal Shakespeare Players know how to do a production. This film of A Midsummer Night's Dream did more than take my breath away, it made me think and gasp and laugh till I had tears in my eyes. The sensitivity of the cast to each line they speak is profound and beautiful. So often when Shakespeare is performed on film the actors are not very familiar with speaking in verse, but this version the actors speak beyond the text and break down the barrier of language that is often associated with Shakespeare.

Also in this version there is a brilliant use of light and color to set a mood. The rooms and costumes are wildly colorful and it makes things seem very child-like. This brings in the topic of the little boy in this film. He seems to be the one dreaming this whole play, but in the play he seems to be the changeling boy that Oberon wants to take from Titania. The fairy world is very sexual and I for one find it a bit too racy for my taste, and it makes me recoil to see the perverse gestures as the thoughts of a little child.

Other than this, I was delighted by the themes brought out in the film. One such theme is the relationship between the dream world in the woods and the world of reason in Athens. This is shown by actors playing Hippolyta and Theseus are double cast as Titania and Oberon, (as they would be in Shakespeare's day) and so is every other character except the four lovers, who visit both worlds throughout the play.

It is beautiful and intriguing production and I enjoyed it immensely.",1134000000,4,1526,4.347368421052631
1038016,4,6305470456,"The 1996 production of A Midsummer Night's Dream puts a modern spin on a traditional Shakespearean play.

Having the same actors play the parts of both Titania and Hippolyta, and Theseus and Oberon was a very good move. It accentuated the difference between reality and imagination, which is one of the main themes of the original Shakespeare. We see Theseus and Hippolyta as serious characters in a serious, recognizable set. Then, we see the same actors dressed differently in an ""other-worldly"" type of set - it really stressed the difference between that which is a dream, and that which is real. Costumes were easily differentiated as well, for the fairies had wild, Dr. Seuss-like hair-do's, and the Athenians wore specific costumes according to their sex, in a variety of colors.

The production was very true to Shakespeare in terms of using the majority of his text within the play, which, though staged far differently than he ever foresaw it, offered an accurate presentation of Shakespearean themes and vision nonetheless.

While the little boy seemed to be distracting at first, he also had a role to play in the movie: it was HIS dream. He was the Indian boy whom Titania and Oberon fought over. And, it was the play stage in his room which was used by Puck and Oberon during their plotting. However, some of the shots of his reactions to different occurrences did seem slightly superfluous. But, through the eyes of this child, it was much easier to believe some of the seemingly crazy things that were going on in the woods.

The play-within-the-play remained unchanged in this version from the original text, and the players also performed multiple roles, dressing for the part of Bottom's fairy attendants when the fairy queen falls in love with him. Again, this adds to the distinction between reality and dream. It reminded me of the Wizard of Oz, where Dorothy falls asleep and dreams of a lion, a scarecrow, and a tin man, who are really the people from her own farm in different costumes. An excellent choice by the director.

While the staging and overall presentation of Shakespeare is radically different from any other movie version I've seen, I believe it holds significant value nonetheless. In fact, I believe that, although the set and costumes are very different from the Athenian garb which was worn in the 1935 version, the characterization and presentation given by this version is far more accurate to the original text.

Finally, while this version contains some sexually explicit material, that probably makes it more true to what the original production would have portrayed. Since Shakespeare wrote to please intellectuals and commoners, it was not uncommon for his plays to contain raunchy lines or scenes. This version has captured that, as the sexual themes do not overpower the themes of love, dreams and reality, they do play a part.",1133827200,6,2878,4.94824016563147
1038017,5,6305470456,"Psychedelic and funky, the Royal Shakespeare Players present ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"" with an entirely new twist to the traditional costumes and set. The fairies are portrayed wearing brightly colored tufts of fluff and their hair-do's are something to behold. The actor playing both Oberon and Theseus changes not only his attitude for each respective character but also his hair undergoes massive transformation from a hail to a Sesame Street character to something more subdued. Puck is an 80's rock star re-incarnate.

  The sets are simplistic yet astounding in their simplicity. Many times they consist of only doors opening and closing to symbolize a different setting. Another interesting point to note is the use of color. The doors change colors periodically throughout the performance and can be tied to the emotion being enacted in that scene. Much of the action takes place on an empty and somewhat darkened stage.

 This interpretation of ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"" is a unique blend of modern and traditional. While staying true to Shakespeare's written words they take liberty to play with the characters and how to interpret them. The players in the play (Bottom, Quince, etc) are portrayed as a pseudo-biker group, leather jackets included. Puck is interpreted as an extremely sexual being, which accentuates Shakespeare's tendency to incorporate the intellectual and vulgar into his plays in order to appeal to the groundlings and to the more scholarly.

 Many reviewers have something to negative to say about the boy who randomly appears in this version. In a way it can be confusing but upon a closer look his appearances are not as random as one originally assumes. For example, he falls asleep and dreams himself into the play and we are seeing the action from his point of view. We get to see his reactions to the drama. Another interesting thing to note is the reappearance of the doll house. The dollhouse starts out as just a toy in the boy's room but later you see Oberon and Puck maneuvering the lovers on the stage of the doll house just as they are discussing how to maneuver them through the woods and rectify the confusion. The boy and his dollhouse are actually ingenious devices used to show the audience how true it is that the whole play is about people maneuvering people to feel a certain way or do a certain thing. For example, Oberon dislikes how Titania is keeping the Indian boy away from him so he manipulates her and makes her fall in love with a donkey. Upon awakening from the ""nightmare"" she gives the boy over to Oberon.

 All in all I believe that this version, although somewhat raunchy in certain scenes, does an amazing job bringing a fresh interpretation to ""A Midsummer Night's Dream. With the merging of a simplistic set, fantastical costumes, and overall stellar acting, this play comes to life yet again.",1133740800,6,2867,4.9070247933884295
1038018,3,6305470456,"The beauty if Shakespeare is present in this version of A Midsummer Night's Dream.  The version is quite different from other versions.  Often the fairy world contains no sets- just floating lights and ambient light.  The fairies are portrayed in bright color with wild hair-do's.  Puck is reminiscent of an eighties rock star, and several of the fairies look like oompah- loompahs.  Lysander and Demetrius are introduced wearing the same clothes and appear very whiny at times.  The play is very sexual at times and the acting sometimes appears over the top (several people are slapped in the face in anger at random times).  But staging is marvelous.  The backdrop of the movie is that the entire thing is a child's dream, making the many fantastical happenings much more believable.  The child appears throughout the movie, and if you watch carefully, many things in the child's room are repeated throughout the movie.  The same actor and actress play the Theseus/Hippolyta couple and the Oberon/Titania couple.  The end has some excellent staging using these two actors/four characters portrayal.

The beauty of Shakespeare is interpretation.  Shakespeare has been done on so many levels in so many ways, and this is simply another way of doing it.  The bright color and sometime unorthodox manner of interpretation (at one point Titania and Bottom with a donkey's head are seen making love) may startle at first, but know that the essence of the play is kept.  Many things of this movie are in fact reminiscent of past versions.  The player of ""moon"" in this version of the play within a play is still a skinny old man with glasses as in the Woolfenden and Hoffman productions, and the wall ""chink"" is still two fingers.  Many of the same jokes are kept (Ninus' Tomb! Ninus' Tomb! Not Ninny's!) and the actual Shakespeare lines are treated with respect, unedited with the exception of simple removal.  So, although the movie stands out as utterly different from all other screen versions (and probably from most stage versions too) it contains the remnants of its predecessors along with the nature Shakespeare originally intended for the play.

I personally quite enjoyed the movie.  The over acting can be something amusing, and once you get used to it, you can see through to the interpretation of the play.  The actor of Theseus/Oberon is quite young, and does well in changing his acting.  It is obvious the same actor is playing both parts, but his change in attitude makes it interesting to watch him act.  The players (Quince, Bottom and the others) are portrayed as a sort of subdued biker group.  They are very funny, and the actor of Pyramus, while acting silly during the play within a play, is able to elicit serious emotion as well.

So, give this version some time.  It is quite satisfying to see it through to the end.  The differences can be startling at first, but the interpretation is marvelous at times.  Shakespeare is treated with due respect, earlier versions are honored, and A Midsummer Night's Dream is definitely experienced by all who watch.",1133568000,4,3075,4.895551257253385
1038019,3,6305470456,"I prefer a more traditional approach, and found the funky fairies rather disturbing.  The bare stage and opening and closing doors were interesting.  This will do very well for what I wanted it for--contrasting different approaches to the play in the classroom; however, having seen it once, I will not choose to watch it again just for pleasure.  The young boy, while cute, was very distracting--what was his purpose?  I thought at first he was going to play Puck, but was quickly disabused of that notion.  Again--interesting, but very strange and a bit unsettling.",1074211200,9,567,4.98936170212766

The good thing about this production is the acting.  Excellent acting, excellent deliveries.  Close your eyes and you'll find this a delight.  But open your eyes, and be prepared for bicycles, suspenders, paned windows, dollhouses, and a young boy who pops up here and there -- why?
The sets are, uh, well, interesting.  Some set designer was given lots of latitude for their imagination.  Maybe they think they produced a dream; others will call it a nightmare.  If you would like to see what would happen if you stuck Andy Warhol, Jackson Pollock, and Georgia O'Keefe in an art blender and pushed the mix button, you'll like the sets.
The costumes are, uh, eclectic.  People wearing modern dress mix with those wearing Edwardian, Renaissance, and unidentified era clothing.  I suppose this was supposed to be creative.  To me, it was just confusing without any benefit.
And why did the director invent a prompter for the play-within-a-play?  This prompter simply pops in every now and then to correct the actors' lines.  And the point of this was, what?  Shakespeare didn't think this role was needed, and frankly, neither do I.
If you decide to watch this, watch it for the acting and try to pretend that all the other stuff is just a bad dream.  More to the point, close your eyes, listen to it, and enjoy it thoroughly.  Just don't open your eyes until it's over.",1060646400,9,1593,4.783882783882784

What was Adrian Noble (Normally an excellent director) and the RSC thinking hiring these ...? It features the most unattractive Bottom I've seen since Dennis Franz's nude scene on ""NYPD Blue""! The addition of a child ""Dreaming"" the play is ghastly and intrusive. In the ""Pyramus & Thisbe"" scene, which SHOULD be the comic highlight, they play Pyamus's death for pathos and it's beyond embarrassing.

While I generally don't care for Shakespeare in exotic settings, this version was quirky and funky enough to satisfy. We begin identifying with a child who observes the story, perhaps in his dream. The child (in his striped pajamas) is the silent observer of each scene, whether of the workers who gather to prepare their play for Theseus' wedding (Bottom arrives on a motorcycle), or the lovers and fairies in the enchanted woods. The latter is made of  clear light bulbs hanging at various heights, with a few random doorways with doors that seemingly lead to other unseen dimensions. This latter scene looks like it was designed by Salvador Dali. Oberon reminds me of the criminal from ""A Clockwork Orange."" Helena and Hermia have contrasting long and short hair and body types, each attractive in her own way, while their Athenian lovers seem almost interchangeable. The four convey the sense of being imprisoned in the woods/dream/circumstance, until the suitable resolution effected by Oberon & Puck. The danger in many cinema versions of Shakespeare is that the visual distracts and trumps rather than supports the poetry. In the present case, there is enough internal consistency between the funky features, and a sufficient conviction of the actors, to satisfy this lover of Shakespeare.",1524009600,,1357,5.135746606334842

Okay, maybe the movie framing device using a present day ""changeling child""  doesn't really work; the adorable modern ten year old boy at times is a spectator/participant of the on-stage action in Arden Forest or Theseus' palace which didn't make sense to me. maybe the text cuts went a bit too far-- but productions have made justifiable cuts to Hamlet and the Earth has neither entirely split open nor have demons flown up out of those cracks.
