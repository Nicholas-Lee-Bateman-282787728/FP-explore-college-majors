8609848,5,B00EVIM8FW,"Though this was an at home study instead of the face-to-face class I would have loved to take, Donna and Tom do an amazing job bringing this technique to life in the comfort of your home and/or office. I felt like this process was similar to a homecoming; having that ah-ha moment where it just clicks. That ""oh, this is what I've been doing unconsciously for so long, now I can put some real reason behind it"" moment. Sacred Lomi definitely bridges the gap between spirituality and physical bodywork. It's exactly the modality I've been searching for, and I've been searching for quite some time; always coming back to Sacred Lomi's advertisements.

The principles of this lifestyle (If I'm allowed to call it that. It seems it'd be a lifestyle to me) are also the teachings I believe in for my own self conduct. Very symbolic of Christ Consciousness. All around, I feel privileged to have studied this work and look forward to deepening my studies.

The course was very easy to follow along with. Donna and Tom do an excellent job breaking down and reviewing basic movements to help you as you move along with baby steps and then putting all the pieces together, creating full fluid motions to mimic the air and sea. I give them immense credit for that since this modality really has no right or wrong, no true protocol other than to hold space, stay in this moment and start on the back, finish at the head. Being able to simplify and teach takes a lot of know-how and they really know how! Mahalo, Donna and Tom, for bringing me back to the Ohana Nui! I feel at home...Aloha ",1508198400,,1579,4.552816901408451
