6361851,4,B00JJNLWDI,"The Black Dahlia Murder has just released their second DVD. The follow up to ""Majesty"" which saw instant success. This Michigan based band has gradually been rising in the ranks of one of Americas most popular death metal bands. The DVD is an entertaining glimpse into their touring life, and relationships amongst themselves.

The two disk DVD includes DVD1 which is the documentary of their warped tour 2013, as well as their Europe Tour which also took place in 2013. Outtakes are also included on this disk.

DVD2 contains live performances of both the Warped tour 2013, and their European tour.

The documentary is very entertaining, not as funny as ""Majesty"", but still contains some good laughs. The new line up and member change is explained. The new members are introduced, and the chemistry makes for serious entertainment. The documentary also has small segments of 3D adventure. The DVD includes 3D glasses that one can put on during particular segments and watch the silly animations and backdrops as the band members do silly things.

Over all, entertaining and informative, worth the watch.",1402099200,,1105,5.054945054945055

8651309,3,B00JJNLWDI,"I've been a metal fan for nearly 25 years. I've found most of the extreme metal to come out in the last decade or so to be mostly crap- a lot of glossy production, tough guy poses, and high-speed instrumental antics equating to technical wankery, but nothing that makes a statement worth listening to more than once. Once in awhile, though, a group comes around that really catches my attention. I knew the name of TBDM but never heard their music until a few months ago, when by total accident I came across the ""Majesty"" documentary. Yeah, I'm late to the game and after seeing that documentary, I asked myself how it was even possible that I hadn't checked them out earlier- ""Majesty"" slammed and I became an overnight fan of the band. The songs slaughtered, they were obviously and powerful and polished live unit, and above all, they were fun. I ordered ""Majesty"" to support the band and add it to my collection. When I saw the trailer for ""Fool 'Em All"" on Blabbermouth, I was stoked and got onto the pre-order list for a copy immediately. But once I received it, I was disappointed.

1. Another reviewer mentioned that the laughs here seem forced. I agree. Whereas ""Majesty"" seemed sincere, this one didn't. The guys seem burnt in this one- as opposed to ""Majesty"", when the only one who seemed sick of it was John the guitarist, who's no longer with the band. Here, they all seem fed up and sorta holding smiles while the cameras are running. On the one hand I can understand this- I've been told from friends who have been on Warped Tour that it's utterly grueling, one of the most brutal touring treks despite the benefits afforded to the bands from corporate sponsors (buses et al). In the broader sense, I can also see where the band would be tired in general; TBDM has been touring nearly non-stop for how long now? Over a decade at least. But still, this DVD was sort of depressing to watch, since I got the feeling they are questioning themselves as to how long they're going to keep at it.

2. There was a bizarre disparity between the bulk of the DVD focusing on the Warped Tour, then suddenly switching into the band's subsequent European tour. It's good to show the band in a different environments for contrast and variety, but why only these two? They didn't tour more in 2013? I feel like it should have been only Warped Tour, or if they wanted to include something else, they might have included other touring highlights from throughout 2013, not just the Euro run. But straddling this middle ground was awkward.

3. Too much emphasis on weed and drinking. I'm willing to bet the guys do more than just those two things on tour- but it seemed like every scene, someone's smoking, puffing, passing, etc. It gets old, especially to older fans like me (late 30s) who might prefer some substance in a documentary, not scenery that suggesting that either a) the band really isn't growing as people despite all the experiences they've had in a decade-plus of traveling the world with their music, or b) they're doing it intentionally to appeal to the hipster crowd. If ""Majesty"" showed anything, it's that there are no dummies in TBDM; they're all articulate and, I believe, capable of more than being filmed getting high and/or engaging in annoying macho games (like wrestling matches in the bus while inebriated) when not onstage.

4. The length was, like, way short. Not that I expect everything to be as long as ""Majesty"", but this one doesn't serve as a quality update of the band's activities since then.

I really like what Metal Blade/Cannibal Corpse did in the transition from the ""Centuries of Torment"" DVD to the ""Global Evisceration"" DVD. You get the history, then you get something showing the business and logistics side of the band. Both of those really gave a good feel for the CC guys as people and professional musicians. I feel like TBDM, given how long they've been around and the size of their fan base, would have been better served taking a similar approach in the transition from ""Majesty"" to ""Fool 'Em All"".",1404432000,3,4049,4.649441340782123

8651311,5,B00JJNLWDI,This is a great dvd has awesome live videos of two concerts and a documentary. All I did I mention 3d glasses.,1403481600,,110,4.045454545454546
8651312,3,B00JJNLWDI,"I say this as a fan of this band, but I think this dvd could have been better. For starters, it mainly focuses on the Warped tour they recently participated in during 2013. While it was interesting to see this kind of band play for people who aren't familiar with death metal, the novelty wore off quick. The laughs in this one are forced, and the band doesn't come off as mischievously endearing like they did on Majesty. I also thought the 3D gimmick was lame and not used to great effect like it could have been; there were basically like 3 brief parts of nonsense that finished before you got a chance to put on the glasses. I also felt the part where Trevor and Brian derided ex guitarist John K was low class and unnecessary. This is not to say the entire package is a waste. Both concerts on the second dvd are great, but the sound seems very compressed on the Warped footage. It was disappointing that they didn't include a cd version of the concerts. Not bad overall, but no Majesty for sure.",1402272000,4,1001,4.358288770053476
