7945199,5,B00005MEVM,"""Elysia"" made in l934 shows off some of the best looking beef cake to be found in the nudist movies. The hero is never named in the titles. But his beautiful torso, unusually trim and fit for this era, conveys a strong sense of sensuality--although he does nothing but tour a nudist camp with an equally buff looking older man. The hero is unusually articulate, too, and stylish and wears his nakedness with intriguing ease. One can only wonder if he was a real actor trying to make some extra money--or whether he really was a nudist who agreed to appear in this propoganda film about the joy of nudism. His companion is interesting in that he's always taking his friend's arm, or putting an arm around his waist. We can only wonder what went on behind the camera. The heroine is a stunning natural blonde and she is also a standout in her ease in appearing nude throughout the film. There's no production notes on where this very brief film (about twenty minutes running time) was made, how long its original length, the names and backgorunds of the key players.

I was also impressed with how the filmmakers gave equal time to naked men and quite a few were gorgeous. In these films the camera usually stays glued to female bosoms and rears. In this one, guys are given equal treatment--and some of them you would definitely like to take home--but because this production was released in l934, all the cast and crew are probably dead by now--or in retirement homes.

The second feature on this disc, ""The Road to Ruin"" is unusually turgid and boring for an exploitation film. Usualy these efforts can be counted to move fast and entertaingly. this one is like watching frozen mollases.",1310428800,,1688,4.642140468227424
