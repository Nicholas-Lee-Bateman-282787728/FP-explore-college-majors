The only thing about this whole Dvd i liked is the stories from Kurt's friends, they had a few funny stories to tell about Kurt but that was it. There is no Nirvana music and no footage of them.",1080604800,,259,3.9056603773584904
8691269,3,B00009MEFL,"All in all this is a good dvd if you don't know much about Nirvana already, though some of the facts aren't quite correct and you never see or hear nirvana...you see a few pictures but thats about it. The people interviewed don't really have much to do with Kurt or Nirvana, apart from his uncle chuck, If you just want to find out some facts about Nirvana or Kurt I suggest looking on the web, just search using google you'll get a broader veiw on everything. But it's an ok dvd, and tells you a few thing you won't find many other places and a better view of Kurts childhood and teenage years than on most websites. (If you are having trouble finding this dvd buy i at play.com they have some in stock.) So all in all i say buy it if you have a few quid/dollars spair just to give you better knowlege of Nirvana. :)",1079913600,,817,4.144654088050315
