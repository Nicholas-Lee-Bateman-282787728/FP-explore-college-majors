3129205,3,B0014CCPP6,"As an avid WWII movie buff, I found most of this collection features older movies (30 from 1940 - 1959) with another 10 from the 60's and half a dozen from the 70's. There were even two from 1934 and 1936.  Most of them are worthwhile with a few 'duds' thrown in to make the magical number of 50. For instance, I don't think many of us would expect Mexico and Pauncho Villa to be included in a 'Combat Classic' Collection.  Realizing the cost and hours of entertainment to be realized, it was enjoyable for the most part.  Don't expect all of them to be top knotch movies but if you enjoy older movies then you'll find this collection worthwhile.",1221436800,68,646,4.366666666666666
3129206,3,B0014CCPP6,"The Combat Classics 50 Movie Pack consists of war films primarily set during World War II that have fallen into public domain.  As fans of the Mill Creek Entertainment products have come to expect, the quality of the transfers in this boxed set range from fair to excellent, but the entertainment value of these movies is better than usual.  There are no documentaries included in this set and only a handful of foreign films shot using a figurehead American star TV movies are incorporated.  I'd have given full marks, except for one significant caveat - 25 of the 50 films listed can be found in other Mill Creek 50 Movie Packs:  17 were included in ""War Classics"", 5 in ""Action Classics"", 2 in Historical Classics and 1 each from ""All-Time Classics"" and ""Hollywood Legends"".  In fact, the mediocre `Yellowneck' has been now been included in three different 50 Movie Pack collections.  Since the recently released ""TV Favorites"" 150 episode pack includes 100 episodes previously included in other sets, this is a disturbing trend.

Here are the films, stars and ratings (on a 1 to 10 scale from a popular internet movie website):

3129252,4,B0014CCPP6,"Hey, either you like what Mill Creek does or you don't.  Movies that fall into the public domain are usually there for a reason, but Mill Creek harvests what's out there and puts it all together in a convenient package.  This happens to work great for me--most of the time, I put these flicks on while walking on the treadmill and they eat up the hour or so I'm on there.

I have several of these 50 movie sets--and while this is the only one from which I've watched all 50 films, I think this is probably one of Mill Creek's best efforts.  (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Drive-In-Movie-Classics-50-Movie-Pack/dp/B000AA4KLK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Drive-In Movie Classics 50 Movie Pack</a>&nbsp;might be tops)As long as one isn't going into this set expecting films like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sands-of-Iwo-Jima/dp/B00MGBS54Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sands of Iwo Jima</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Bridge-Too-Far/dp/B00A2YAY3C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Bridge Too Far</a>, you'll probably do all right.

I can't really say I had any favorites--most of the films were mediocre at best.  I suppose I probably liked THE ADVENTURES OF TARTU the best, with Robert Donat, which I thought had some interesting cinematography at the end, and BATTLE OF THE EAGLES, which was interesting simply because it was a Yugoslavian production about their fledgling partisan air force in WWII.  Not really a good movie, per se, but I liked getting a chance to see their version of events.  A couple flicks were more western that war (KANSAS PACIFIC, BUSHWACKERS), but both were decent mid-fifties westerns, so no harm no foul, I guess.

Several of the films were centered around a specific school in the Armed forces, such as minesweepers, aerial gunnery, etc.  These formula films got a little tiring at the end--group of recruits get thrown together, rub each other the wrong way, learn to work it out, and take their new skills into combat together.  Actor Richard Arlen seems to show up in a lot of these.

Lastly, there's some awfully attractive women who show up in some of these flicks--Gene Tierney, Paulette Goddard, Barbara Payton, Claudette Colbert and others.  They certainly add some zip to a flick that otherwise might be a yawner.

If this is your first experience with Mill Creek films, then keep your expectations way down, and you'll be pleased.  Though the price may change, right now you can get this set for around ten clams.  That makes it 20 cents a film.  For some people, that will about 20 cents too much.  But if you enjoy old forgotten films, then this set might be for you, whether you watch them on the treadmill or not.",1413072000,,2791,5.511737089201878

3129269,5,B0014CCPP6,"This is one of the better 50 movie sets from Mill Creek. Most of the movies were originally from top studios like 20th Century Fox, Paramount, Universal, and Warner Brothers. This set also has a lot more ""Star Power"", than many of the companys typical offerings.
Angela Lansbury, Sydney Poitier, Paulette Goddard, Montgfomery Clift, James Cagney, Sir John Gielgud, Sir Ralph Richardson, Tony Randall, Robert Mitchum, Claudette Colbert, David Niven and many other 'A' listers from Hollywood's golden age are featured. There's also a former U.S. President in this collection's lineup! Combat Classics is a good mix of older black and white films and color motion pictures. Like Mill Creek's other 50 movie collections, none of the films are digitally restored. However, the picture quality on most of these motion pictures, especially the one's in color, is much better than usual. They do show signs of obvious wear and tear, but they still look pretty good, all things considered. There are 12 one sided discs with approximately 4 titles on each DVD.

Quality is not very good and never re-worked to clean anything up so that's disappointing also.

3129286,4,B0014CCPP6,"Combat Classics 50 Movies, 2009 film

This collection of fifty movies from ""Mill Creek Entertainment"" is on twelve single-sided DVD discs. Twenty-one are in color, the rest in monochrome. Some used to be shown on television in the 1950s to the 1970s, but are rarely broadcast in modern times. The back of the box has the titles in alphabetical order, its year, the format, and the name of one actor. They presented an outlook that was matched to their audience at the time. I think the best movies are from the 1940s when WW II was ongoing or fresh in the audience's memory. As with the other 50-pack sets, some are duplicated in other collections. Some sort of compression was used to make then fit. These sets offer a low-cost way to see many movies not otherwise readily available. Here are the titles by disc order.

01 This is the Army; Identity Unknown; Kansas Pacific; The Lady from Chungking.
02 The Big Lift; They Raid by Night; The Torch; Yellowneck.

But, if you're like me and have seen them all (I saw Crusade in Europe on TV when I was 10...that's 50 years ago and have been watching war movies since), you can't go wrong for the price. They do include some Civil War stuff to round out the 50.",1353196800,,531,3.94392523364486

I had to view the menu of each disc and write the films down on paper,otherwise it can be a nightmare trying to find a film you want to watch.
Since purchasing this boxset which I bought in Australia,I got another boxset in this series GUNSLINGER CLASSICS from  America which was packaged differently having double sided discs which had the movies listed plus a booklet with notes about each movie. So if you're going to buy this,then purchase it from America,as it is a lot cheaper,even with postage included.

The quality of the recordings is as good as can be expected considering that they were transferred from film to digital. In terms of entertainment value, the movies vary from good to ok to pretty poor to terrible, but when you buy 50 in a pack, that's probably the expected range of reviews. It was surprising to see Civil War and even Napoleon War titles amongst what is billed as a combat collection, but they are a welcome surprise addition.

3129317,4,B0014CCPP6,"Most of the combat in these ""Classics"" takes place in World War 2, although there is the occasional departure such as the Civil War and even African war film. I liked most of them. Even if they weren't thrilling as films in themselves they were interesting artifacts of life from several decades ago.

THE ADVENTURES OF TARTU: aka SABOTAGE AGENT, This film pits a chemical engineer (Captain Stevenson) who is fluent in Rumanian, German and Russian against Nazis. Stevenson becomes an Iron Guard named Tartu and attempts to upset a Nazi plot by destroying a poison gas factory. He needs help from the local resistance to succeed. But how, posing as a Nazi, can he get the underground to trust him? This one is pretty well written and thought out.

AERIAL GUNNER: Chester Morris and Richard Arlen are lifelong rivals who somehow end up in the Air Corps, in the same unit, at the same time, as.... (Drum roll)....Aerial Gunners! When they're not busy training with their .50 caliber machine guns they're busy trying to outmaneuver each other for the attention of the scrumptious Amelita Ward, who looks young enough to be their daughter. This is a typical WW2 propaganda movie which won't do you any damage but it's not really exciting or interesting either.

BATTLE OF THE EAGLES: An interesting Yugoslavian WWII film about the unsung story of the Yugoslavian Partisan air-force which, with outdated biplanes, took on the mighty Luftwaffe in 1942 Occupied Yugoslavia. It's a decent story but suffers from Yugoslavian production values and editing. The story deserves a big-budget re-make.

BLOOD ON THE SUN: A chipper little Jimmy Cagney movie wherein our hero plays a savvy newspaper editor stationed in Japan just before the attack on Pearl Harbor. He gets wind of the invasion and risks it all to get a hold of the plans and get them to US authorities. It's a decent enough little story made much better by Cagney's spitfire performance. It's capped off with an amazing fight scene in which Cagney shows off his Judo black belt.

BOMBS OVER BURMA: Anna May Wong plays a Chinese school teacher who helps keep a supply line open from China into Burma during WW2. It's not a lavish production by any means but Anna May has a natural screen presence and there is enough tension to keep you interested.

DESERT COMMANDOS: Italian director Umberto Lenzi's excellent WW2 film about 5 Nazi Soldiers who parachute into North Africa in order to assassinate Churchill, Roosevelt and DeGaulle, who are holding a major conference. It's more of a thriller than an action movie and it's a little slow getting started but by the end of the film you'll be on the edge of your seat.

DRUMS IN THE DEEP SOUTH: Two buds from West point find themselves on opposite ends of the battlefield in this pretty standard Civil War drama. Meh.

IDENTITY UNKNOWN: An interesting World War II psychological drama in which a soldier survives a bombing but suffers amnesia. His three buddies were not only all killed but all burned beyond recognition, so he doesn't know which of the four of them he is. It's actually pretty interesting and Cheryl Walker, the 1938 Pasadena Rose Queen, is easy on the eyes.

SUBMARINE ALERT: Nazi spies use a stolen shortwave transmitter prototype to broadcast top secret shipping info to an offshore Japanese submarine. Luckily, the FBI, a patriotic radio engineer and good old American gumption trip up the Ratzis. It's a decent little WW2 spy thriller that moves at a decent pace once it gets going. This one is not going to knock your socks off but it's definitely entertaining.

IMMORTAL BATTALION aka THE WAY AHEAD: This is a fine, highly patriotic British WW2 film about the training up of a rag-tag bunch of Brits into an efficient fighting force. David Niven drew on real life experience as a training officer for this film, which was written by Peter Ustinov.

MINESWEEPER: Richard Arlen and Jean Parker team up again to wave the flag during WW2. Arlen is a deserter who re-joins the navy after WW2 breaks out he finds redemption and Jean parker but not without butting heads with Russell Hayden and the Nazis. It's the usual stuff, although you learn some interesting details about the operation of a minesweeper.

ONE OF OUR AIRCRAFT IS MISSING: An RAF bomber crew bails out of their damaged plane over Nazi Occupied Holland. They spend the rest of the movie trying to get back to England with the help of the Dutch underground. Peter Ustinov makes his screen debut as a priest. While it is a propaganda film it purposely eschews many of the stereotypes found in this type of film, substituting realism and genuine thoughtfulness instead.",1294876800,30,4650,4.827889447236181
3129318,5,B0014CCPP6,"How can this not be a good deal? Granted very few are really good. Hitler's SS: Portrait of Evil, One of Our Aircraft Is Missing, Go for Broke and The Adventures of Tartu are some of the best. Most are rewatchable and a couple are pretty bad. But for the price you can't go wrong. Most are WWII with at least one pre-WWII and a few from the US Civil War. I don't remember the exact mix because there are so many it takes a long time to watch them all. Well worth the price for an old war movie buff like me even though I had about 15 of the movies already.

What is in the box is 12 discs with five or six movies on each disc. They come in individual envelopes but they are all stacked in a box thing in the center of the case which makes it a little diffcult to keep them in the right order when you take one out. But the envelopes should last for quit a few viewings. A great deal.",1279497600,20,883,3.9055555555555554
3129319,4,B0014CCPP6,"I bought this collection mainly for ""This Is The Army"" Featuring Ronald Reagan. It was a great oscar winning film that is not available on DVD so when I saw it on this collection I instantly purchased it. The quality of the films included in this set varies some films are very good transfers while others are not very well presented. But overall all the films are watchable and the lack of quality adds to the vintage feel of the included films. I recommend this set for its great value, 50 movies will keep you entertained for hours on end.",1269388800,58,542,4.43

While there are a few, (very few), good films in this collection, far too many of the titles simply are not worth your time. In addition, many of the titles are included in other Mill Creek collections.

Bad scripts, terrible acting, and in too many instances, very poor print quality as well. This is the first 50 Pack I've regretted buying. I'm sure there are better collections out there. Pass this one up, keep shopping.",1244764800,21,534,4.5625

I have been satisfied and find all of them a great value.  Unfortunately, this one, Combat Classics, one which I would have been interested in, contains at least or about half of the movies on 2 other related box titles. I have Action and War and was ok with overlap of one or 2 or a couple of duds foreign or silent.  This is over the top.  On the big collections of 150 or more I would expect some compilation.  I would have preferred 25 for $10.99 rather than the 50 for $17 plus",1228003200,17,627,4.183333333333334
3363702,3,B0014CCPP6,"As an avid WWII movie buff, I found most of this collection features older movies (30 from 1940 - 1959) with another 10 from the 60's and half a dozen from the 70's. There were even two from 1934 and 1936.  Most of them are worthwhile with a few 'duds' thrown in to make the magical number of 50. For instance, I don't think many of us would expect Mexico and Pauncho Villa to be included in a 'Combat Classic' Collection.  Realizing the cost and hours of entertainment to be realized, it was enjoyable for the most part.  Don't expect all of them to be top knotch movies but if you enjoy older movies then you'll find this collection worthwhile.",1221436800,68,646,4.366666666666666
3363703,3,B0014CCPP6,"The Combat Classics 50 Movie Pack consists of war films primarily set during World War II that have fallen into public domain.  As fans of the Mill Creek Entertainment products have come to expect, the quality of the transfers in this boxed set range from fair to excellent, but the entertainment value of these movies is better than usual.  There are no documentaries included in this set and only a handful of foreign films shot using a figurehead American star TV movies are incorporated.  I'd have given full marks, except for one significant caveat - 25 of the 50 films listed can be found in other Mill Creek 50 Movie Packs:  17 were included in ""War Classics"", 5 in ""Action Classics"", 2 in Historical Classics and 1 each from ""All-Time Classics"" and ""Hollywood Legends"".  In fact, the mediocre `Yellowneck' has been now been included in three different 50 Movie Pack collections.  Since the recently released ""TV Favorites"" 150 episode pack includes 100 episodes previously included in other sets, this is a disturbing trend.

3363749,4,B0014CCPP6,"Hey, either you like what Mill Creek does or you don't.  Movies that fall into the public domain are usually there for a reason, but Mill Creek harvests what's out there and puts it all together in a convenient package.  This happens to work great for me--most of the time, I put these flicks on while walking on the treadmill and they eat up the hour or so I'm on there.

I have several of these 50 movie sets--and while this is the only one from which I've watched all 50 films, I think this is probably one of Mill Creek's best efforts.  (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Drive-In-Movie-Classics-50-Movie-Pack/dp/B000AA4KLK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Drive-In Movie Classics 50 Movie Pack</a>&nbsp;might be tops)As long as one isn't going into this set expecting films like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sands-of-Iwo-Jima/dp/B00MGBS54Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sands of Iwo Jima</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Bridge-Too-Far/dp/B00A2YAY3C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Bridge Too Far</a>, you'll probably do all right.

I can't really say I had any favorites--most of the films were mediocre at best.  I suppose I probably liked THE ADVENTURES OF TARTU the best, with Robert Donat, which I thought had some interesting cinematography at the end, and BATTLE OF THE EAGLES, which was interesting simply because it was a Yugoslavian production about their fledgling partisan air force in WWII.  Not really a good movie, per se, but I liked getting a chance to see their version of events.  A couple flicks were more western that war (KANSAS PACIFIC, BUSHWACKERS), but both were decent mid-fifties westerns, so no harm no foul, I guess.

Several of the films were centered around a specific school in the Armed forces, such as minesweepers, aerial gunnery, etc.  These formula films got a little tiring at the end--group of recruits get thrown together, rub each other the wrong way, learn to work it out, and take their new skills into combat together.  Actor Richard Arlen seems to show up in a lot of these.

Lastly, there's some awfully attractive women who show up in some of these flicks--Gene Tierney, Paulette Goddard, Barbara Payton, Claudette Colbert and others.  They certainly add some zip to a flick that otherwise might be a yawner.

If this is your first experience with Mill Creek films, then keep your expectations way down, and you'll be pleased.  Though the price may change, right now you can get this set for around ten clams.  That makes it 20 cents a film.  For some people, that will about 20 cents too much.  But if you enjoy old forgotten films, then this set might be for you, whether you watch them on the treadmill or not.",1413072000,,2791,5.511737089201878
3363750,3,B0014CCPP6,It wasn't exactly what I was after. Some of the production was rather poor and the acting in some of the older war films rather cringe worthy.  For example there was one underwater scene where the lighting was so poor nothing could be seen for a full five minutes.

There's also a former U.S. President in this collection's lineup! Combat Classics is a good mix of older black and white films and color motion pictures. Like Mill Creek's other 50 movie collections, none of the films are digitally restored. However, the picture quality on most of these motion pictures, especially the one's in color, is much better than usual.

This collection of fifty movies from ""Mill Creek Entertainment"" is on twelve single-sided DVD discs. Twenty-one are in color, the rest in monochrome. Some used to be shown on television in the 1950s to the 1970s, but are rarely broadcast in modern times. The back of the box has the titles in alphabetical order, its year, the format, and the name of one actor. They presented an outlook that was matched to their audience at the time. I think the best movies are from the 1940s when WW II was ongoing or fresh in the audience's memory. As with the other 50-pack sets, some are duplicated in other collections. Some sort of compression was used to make then fit. These sets offer a low-cost way to see many movies not otherwise readily available. Here are the titles by disc order.

02 The Big Lift; They Raid by Night; The Torch; Yellowneck.

3363809,5,B0014CCPP6,"There are several quality films in this collection, but don't expect the 50 all-time best.
Lots of these are obscure and feature less than accurate battle footage...but such was Hollywood during those days (not the special effects budgets nor the historic accuracy expectations).",1334534400,,279,5.511627906976744
3363810,4,B0014CCPP6,"As a collector of war movies this collection offers me a large number of the classics at an excellent price. The quality of the recordings is as good as can be expected considering that they were transferred from film to digital. In terms of entertainment value, the movies vary from good to ok to pretty poor to terrible, but when you buy 50 in a pack, that's probably the expected range of reviews. It was surprising to see Civil War and even Napoleon War titles amongst what is billed as a combat collection, but they are a welcome surprise addition. If you like movies that scream patriotism and glory, good guys triumphing over evil, at times with cliched story-lines, then its worth adding to your movie shelf.",1315008000,6,716,4.645669291338582

3363814,4,B0014CCPP6,"Most of the combat in these ""Classics"" takes place in World War 2, although there is the occasional departure such as the Civil War and even African war film. I liked most of them. Even if they weren't thrilling as films in themselves they were interesting artifacts of life from several decades ago.

THE ADVENTURES OF TARTU: aka SABOTAGE AGENT, This film pits a chemical engineer (Captain Stevenson) who is fluent in Rumanian, German and Russian against Nazis. Stevenson becomes an Iron Guard named Tartu and attempts to upset a Nazi plot by destroying a poison gas factory. He needs help from the local resistance to succeed. But how, posing as a Nazi, can he get the underground to trust him? This one is pretty well written and thought out.

AERIAL GUNNER: Chester Morris and Richard Arlen are lifelong rivals who somehow end up in the Air Corps, in the same unit, at the same time, as.... (Drum roll)....Aerial Gunners! When they're not busy training with their .50 caliber machine guns they're busy trying to outmaneuver each other for the attention of the scrumptious Amelita Ward, who looks young enough to be their daughter. This is a typical WW2 propaganda movie which won't do you any damage but it's not really exciting or interesting either.

BATTLE OF THE EAGLES: An interesting Yugoslavian WWII film about the unsung story of the Yugoslavian Partisan air-force which, with outdated biplanes, took on the mighty Luftwaffe in 1942 Occupied Yugoslavia. It's a decent story but suffers from Yugoslavian production values and editing. The story deserves a big-budget re-make.

BLOOD ON THE SUN: A chipper little Jimmy Cagney movie wherein our hero plays a savvy newspaper editor stationed in Japan just before the attack on Pearl Harbor. He gets wind of the invasion and risks it all to get a hold of the plans and get them to US authorities. It's a decent enough little story made much better by Cagney's spitfire performance. It's capped off with an amazing fight scene in which Cagney shows off his Judo black belt.

BOMBS OVER BURMA: Anna May Wong plays a Chinese school teacher who helps keep a supply line open from China into Burma during WW2. It's not a lavish production by any means but Anna May has a natural screen presence and there is enough tension to keep you interested.

DESERT COMMANDOS: Italian director Umberto Lenzi's excellent WW2 film about 5 Nazi Soldiers who parachute into North Africa in order to assassinate Churchill, Roosevelt and DeGaulle, who are holding a major conference. It's more of a thriller than an action movie and it's a little slow getting started but by the end of the film you'll be on the edge of your seat.

DRUMS IN THE DEEP SOUTH: Two buds from West point find themselves on opposite ends of the battlefield in this pretty standard Civil War drama. Meh.

IDENTITY UNKNOWN: An interesting World War II psychological drama in which a soldier survives a bombing but suffers amnesia. His three buddies were not only all killed but all burned beyond recognition, so he doesn't know which of the four of them he is. It's actually pretty interesting and Cheryl Walker, the 1938 Pasadena Rose Queen, is easy on the eyes.

SUBMARINE ALERT: Nazi spies use a stolen shortwave transmitter prototype to broadcast top secret shipping info to an offshore Japanese submarine. Luckily, the FBI, a patriotic radio engineer and good old American gumption trip up the Ratzis. It's a decent little WW2 spy thriller that moves at a decent pace once it gets going. This one is not going to knock your socks off but it's definitely entertaining.

IMMORTAL BATTALION aka THE WAY AHEAD: This is a fine, highly patriotic British WW2 film about the training up of a rag-tag bunch of Brits into an efficient fighting force. David Niven drew on real life experience as a training officer for this film, which was written by Peter Ustinov.

MINESWEEPER: Richard Arlen and Jean Parker team up again to wave the flag during WW2. Arlen is a deserter who re-joins the navy after WW2 breaks out he finds redemption and Jean parker but not without butting heads with Russell Hayden and the Nazis. It's the usual stuff, although you learn some interesting details about the operation of a minesweeper.

ONE OF OUR AIRCRAFT IS MISSING: An RAF bomber crew bails out of their damaged plane over Nazi Occupied Holland. They spend the rest of the movie trying to get back to England with the help of the Dutch underground. Peter Ustinov makes his screen debut as a priest. While it is a propaganda film it purposely eschews many of the stereotypes found in this type of film, substituting realism and genuine thoughtfulness instead.",1294876800,30,4650,4.827889447236181
3363815,5,B0014CCPP6,"How can this not be a good deal? Granted very few are really good. Hitler's SS: Portrait of Evil, One of Our Aircraft Is Missing, Go for Broke and The Adventures of Tartu are some of the best. Most are rewatchable and a couple are pretty bad. But for the price you can't go wrong. Most are WWII with at least one pre-WWII and a few from the US Civil War. I don't remember the exact mix because there are so many it takes a long time to watch them all. Well worth the price for an old war movie buff like me even though I had about 15 of the movies already.

What is in the box is 12 discs with five or six movies on each disc. They come in individual envelopes but they are all stacked in a box thing in the center of the case which makes it a little diffcult to keep them in the right order when you take one out. But the envelopes should last for quit a few viewings. A great deal.",1279497600,20,883,3.9055555555555554

It was a great oscar winning film that is not available on DVD so when I saw it on this collection I instantly purchased it. The quality of the films included in this set varies some films are very good transfers while others are not very well presented. But overall all the films are watchable and the lack of quality adds to the vintage feel of the included films.

While there are a few, (very few), good films in this collection, far too many of the titles simply are not worth your time. In addition, many of the titles are included in other Mill Creek collections.

Bad scripts, terrible acting, and in too many instances, very poor print quality as well. This is the first 50 Pack I've regretted buying. I'm sure there are better collections out there. Pass this one up, keep shopping.",1244764800,21,534,4.5625

Unfortunately, this one, Combat Classics, one which I would have been interested in, contains at least or about half of the movies on 2 other related box titles. I have Action and War and was ok with overlap of one or 2 or a couple of duds foreign or silent.  This is over the top.  On the big collections of 150 or more I would expect some compilation.

many will have you fast forwarding through time wasting scenes like  drawn out pointless horseback rides or  vehicle treks.
ITs hard to disappoint me on old films and this ones came very close .
