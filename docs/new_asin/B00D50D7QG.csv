8589663,5,B00D50D7QG,"Nana Caymmi is a force of nature. This is a portrait of Nana from 2010. George Gachot follows her through Rio as she reminisces about her long career and her many influences. She comes across as very generous and down to earth and someone who has lived life to the fullest every day. A friend told me that she was trying to get into one of her concerts and my friend said ""I'm her best friend can I please go in"" . Security brought her message to Nana and Nana came to the theater entrance and said please allow her to enter, even though sh had never met my friend. The film is punctuated throughout with many of her classics  playing to the beautiful backdrop of Rio. A memorable paraphrase is when she says. ""I don't want a partner, but I never want to lose that feeling of being in love; I can't really say more about that, because they would stone me like Mary Magdalene"". I have been listening to Nana's music for about five years, so the film was great to see because it gave insight into the life of this remarkable artist.",1479945600,,1030,4.282051282051282
