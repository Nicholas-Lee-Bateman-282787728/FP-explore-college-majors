2867032,4,B000RGSX7Y,This is proving to be a great resource.  Alison's directions are clear and easy to follow.  It will be a DVD that I will revisit many times.  Each segment explains a different technique.  The segments build on each other but can be viewed separately.  This enables you to practise one more than another.  The segments build until you end up creating a simple scene.  Excellent!!,1202428800,17,378,4.723076923076923

8200552,5,B000RGSX7Y,"I loved this DVD! Alison Holt is clever, down to earth and inspiratioal. I enjoyed watching Alison as she has a lot of ideas and shows how easy it is to sew and paint a beautiful machine embroidered picture. Her work looks like photos or paintings. I also liked the fact that they left in mistakes, which is what I do and that its not the end of the world. Just keep growing and learning.",1326240000,3,388,4.1866666666666665

8200555,5,B000RGSX7Y,"Beautiful DVD. Explicit instructions, clear views of how to actually do the embroidery. There is nothing like actually watching how to move your hands and the fabric to create the most amazing designs. The instructions are broken down into individual elements so that your can practice and prefect each plant or flower or whatever you are trying to reproduce. Highly recommended.",1269907200,9,379,5.229508196721311
8200556,5,B000RGSX7Y,"I bought this DVD recently and I love it. I have not found anything like this in DVD before because Ms. Holt teaches you how to do machine embroidery only using any zig-zag sewing machine! She is also a great teacher not leaving you to wonder how something is done She explains her self very clearly and when you are first learning this is very important. I love Alison Holt and I hope she makes more DVDs because I will buy them.
Thanks Ms Holt!",1238112000,21,446,4.258823529411765
8200557,5,B000RGSX7Y,"I've been interested in machine embroidery for many years with landscapes being of particular interest.  In this video, Alison Holt shows you step-by-step and in detail how she goes about creating her landscapes. From choosing materials, mapping out your idea, painting the background, and creating the big picture as well as the details, she shares her complete methodology.

Maybe the hardest part of getting started is to design the work.  Alison discusses how she does it and gives a step by step example, discussing her thoughts and design choices as she goes so that you can learn how and why choices are made.  She then follows through creating that same design in the rest of the video, along the way, discussing design choices.

I have few criticisms of this instructional DVD.  One is that she uses an unfamiliar description for the weight of silk she prefers to use as her background.  I have been unable to find it as described though there is no shortage of silks available.  The second is the little grimace-like smile at the end of each segment that should have been cut out or at least brought to her attention during production so that she could stop doing it.  My other criticism is that I would have liked to have had a gallery of her other work to view and maybe a list of materials to print out.

One thing I like about it is that the setting is pleasant but not distracting, enabling one to concentrate on watching what she is doing.  She gives excellent demonstrations of each part of every technique and the camera work catches it brilliantly.

In short, if you want to learn to make your own landscapes with a sewing machine, buy this video, you won't go wrong.",1213315200,23,1686,4.63973063973064
