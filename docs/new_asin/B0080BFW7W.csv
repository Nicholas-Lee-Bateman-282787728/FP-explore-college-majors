5115672,5,B0080BFW7W,"Myself my 31 yr old daughter and her 7 yr old daughter sat down and watched this on it's original air date. We have all watched this on every re-airing since. Thia is the first Disney movie that had me hooked from the opening number to the finale. I have already purchased the DVD, was a ""must add"" to my library. Disney got this one right. I love how it showed that even with young kids Hollywood has a ""standard of beauty"".  The friendship between Kris and Cyrus was outstanding. When it counted each one was willing to do whatever it took to save the friendship. The father the Reverend had some valid points, but misused his pulpit to drive them to his young people. Instead of having a dialog with them, he threw scriptures at them. That is the very reason our young people are MIA today. Mom played a very vital roll, she kept her son encouraged while trying to get her husband to see the error of his ways. If you have not seen this movie, I strongly suggest you and your entire family watch it.",1341014400,15,1002,4.301587301587301
5115673,5,B0080BFW7W,I did enjoy this film.  I've been watching D-coms for a while now but this is the first one I remember seeing where nearly every actor in the film was African-American.  I also liked the fact that it was basically about music.  I really enjoyed the music in the movie as well.  I think the message of being yourself and who you really are is very positive and inspirational.  As with most newly aired on Disney D-coms I watch it nearly every time it airs because I know it will be a while before the DVD comes out.  Also seeing where Cyrus' father was a preacher was very different.  I wasn't expecting that.  Looking forward to this DVD coming out.,1340841600,3,649,4.35
5115674,5,B0080BFW7W,Great movie!! DVR'd the movie. My 4yo and I has watched this movies at least 3 times a day. Ready to watch it again.,1340668800,11,116,3.875
5115675,5,B0080BFW7W,I am a 23 year old college graduate and I cant get enough of this movie. While watching it I forgot it was a disney production. It was obvious they brought outsiders in to help. While other movies seem to have a cartoonish take on the young community let alone the black community that is hip hop oriented I thought this was very realistic age appropiate and fun. For the first time in a long time the kids that look like so many were just that; kids. I cant remember the last time I bought a soundtrack or Dvd instead of waiting for it to be available on netflix or free on youtube. The movie and music is so worth it. The acting and the writing is supreme it was like the characters were written for the actors. Disney and others really took their time with this and it shows. They should be proud. This is entertaining and inspiring for the entire family. If you are looking to be entertained with great music comedy acting and a fantastic plot from beginning to end this is worth it. I can't wait to get it to see what type of extras they have. I have no complaints every element of this was amazing. While most kid movies now a days is cringe worthy to get through I could wach this all the way through and enjoy it. The story is a interesting take on the classic under dog story showcasing popular music. This movie is relevant to all ages races genders and backgrounds.,1340323200,8,1376,4.275862068965517
5115676,5,B0080BFW7W,"Cyrus DeBarge (Tyler James Williams) is a young man who loves to write songs. He also has excellent freestyle rap skills, but lack of confidence is keeping him from performing in front of an audience. Cyrus' friend, Kris McDuffy (Trevor Jackson), has swagger, good looks, dancing talent and has no problem attracting girls, but he can't rap. Their childhood friend Roxie Andrews (Coco Jones) is now a teenage singing sensation and when they enter her contest, she thinks Cyrus' winning rhyme was written by Kris, and, because Cyrus shies away from the limelight, Kris takes his place.

Cyrus and Kris had been friends since childhood. Cyrus was a true friend to Kris, but Kris had quite a bit to learn about loyalty. I liked both characters, but there was a scene in the club that left me disappointed in Cyrus: I was glad he had found the courage to speak up for himself, but he didn't have to do it in a way that disrespected his father. Later on in front of their house he spoke up for himself in a better way, a more respectful tone - it was a bit funny, actually, and the words his father spoke were very touching.

Roxie was a likeable character. It was clear that she was insecure and it seemed to me that Lyla (Nicole Sullivan) was taking advantage,but maybe she believed she was making the right choices for Roxie. Roxie made a choice near the end of the movie I was very happy with. I expected a different reaction from her when she found out the `truth', though. But then again, if she hadn't responded the way she did, Cyrus would have missed out on an opportunity.

Jacob DeBarge (Courtney B. Vance) was Cyrus' father and he was Pastor of Mount Bethel Baptist Church. I agreed with some of the things he said from the pulpit, but for the most part he used his sermons to chastise and condemn. This man of God learned valuable lessons, taught by his wife and son.

Gail DeBarge (Dawnn Lewis): First Lady of Mount Bethel Baptist Church and a devoted wife and mother. She loves and respects her husband and she supports her son's choices. She is also the mediator when tension builds between father and son; I love the way she intervenes to keep the peace. I also loved the scene where she was directing the youth choir -she made me giggle.

Da Bling (Brandon Mychal Smith): All I can say about this character is that he wasn't likeable.

This is the first I've heard of Coco Jones, but I've seen Tyler James Williams in his lead role in Chris Rock's sitcom Everybody Hates Chris and an episode of A&E's The Cleaner, where I got to see how good he can be in a dramatic role. And I watch Syfy's Eureka - Trevor Jackson plays Kevin Blake. These young people are good performers.

This Disney film got my attention from the beginning and kept me smiling until the end. It sends positive messages about staying true to yourself, friendship, conquering fears, how it's not good to judge by appearances, and forgiveness.  The acting is good and I liked the different types of music - contemporary gospel (loved watching the youth choir perform), hip-hop, gospel rap and I really enjoyed the rap battles. It's good family entertainment. I loved it!

5115732,5,B0080BFW7W,"Disney did an excellent job writing and casting this modern day Cyrano de Bergerac story.  The music was surprisingly catchy and well performed.  Dawn Lewis as Cyrus' (Cyrano) mother trying to teach a group of teens ""Precious Lord"" was priceless.  Tyler James Williams as Cyrus was an effective awkward, nerdy teen with a major crush on Roxie (Roxxane)without having to don an oversized nose ala Cyrano. Enjoyed him in Everybody Hates Chris and see a promising career for this young man in acting (and/or maybe rap???).  Coco Jones...wow, such a powerful voice. What a pleasure to see ""smart"" rap again.

As far as the Extended Version of the DVD, there is a scene cut from the TV version in which after Cyrano accidently spills a drink on rapper Bling's  shoes and Bling tells Cyrus that he is lucky the accident didn't happen while he was on stage or he would have embarrassed Cyrano with his rhymes, then Bling comes up with a weak diss of Cyrano that makes Blings crew or ""homies"" as Cyrano later raps laugh.  Cyrano responds that Bling's diss of him was lame and that his rap skills are modest at best and tells Bling that he could on the spot make up 5 better ways to diss himself. Blings crew becomes impressed with Cyrus' skills and at that point he announces to the crowd that the busboy wants to challenge him and of course if you have seen the TV version, Cyrus walks away from the challenge.

My children loved this movie and I enjoyed it as well.  There were a few slow moments, but overall this was a great family movie.",1345248000,4,1534,4.528985507246377

I really enjoyed participating in the movie and I am so proud of the finished product.  I was raised by my parents to be very respectful and to understand the impression that my performance will have on young people like myself, and I know this movie does just that.  It has some great messages throughout, and one of the most important ones is the message from my character Roxxie.  All girls have problems wanting to fit in, but Roxxie's character shows girls and really everyone, that you do not have to try to fit in, by wearing crazy clothes, for crazy makeup, just be yourself and things will work out just fine.  I believe in this message and that's how I live my life.  I know you will enjoy the move, I had a blast making it!!

5115736,4,B0080BFW7W,"This film combines ""Joyful Noise,"" ""8 Mile"" and ""Footloose"" into one film and does it fairly well. Cyrus (Tyler James Williams) is shy and has self esteem issues brought about by a domineering preacher father. He sneaks out at night to bus tables at the forbidden rap club while he composes music for his friend Kris (Trevor Jackson) to sing. They hook up with Roxy (Coco Jones) an old elementary school friend who loves their music, but doesn't realize Cyrus is the brains of ""Truth."" She is a famous singer.

The music was good and the rap insults were light, nothing to shame the Disney logo. The film has its predictable heart warming ending. I enjoyed the criticism of the use of the voice enhancers, but the movie stops short of claiming Katie Perry is nothing more than an overpaid karaoke singer.

Criticism: It appears Cyrus ironically lip synced his rapping and singing parts. Also if you noticed the ""church"" never has a cross or mentions Jesus. It has some out of focus Bible quotes in the background on the wall and mentions G-O-D, but never Jesus, even in song. Disney is trying not to offend anyone. Let me know how that works out.
