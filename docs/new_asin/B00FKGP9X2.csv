8616323,5,B00FKGP9X2,"I loved this series! My only complaint is that it ended abruptly without a real conclusion. I could have watched this series for several more seasons. I'm guessing the show didn't get picked up for another season. Stephen Moyer and Rashida Jones have unbelievable chemistry together and the problems they faced were real life problems. It left me wanting to see MORE of these two. A great, but near impossible, romance.",1380844800,3,419,4.915492957746479
