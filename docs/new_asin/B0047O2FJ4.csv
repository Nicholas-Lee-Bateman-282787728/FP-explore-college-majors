8418278,5,B0047O2FJ4,"Murray Stein's video on Jung's Red Book is actually a seminar presentation for a group of devoted Jungians centered in Asheland, North Carolina. It was done live and online, and it has that spontaneity, vitality, and occasional brilliance of a serious psychological inquiry. It was done when the Red Book was first released in 2009 and it has the freshness (and the meandering quality) of a press conference. There is much good information here and it is well worth the time for someone who truly appreciates the details of Jungian scholarship. Stein's presentation is largely a reprise of the narrative and the storyline of Jung's Red Book with extensive commentary on how this comes out of Jung's life and work. This is mostly applied to our own path of individuation, with emphasis on one's own personal experience. It is not for those seeking entertainment or high and glossy studio production values. It is a seminar pure and simple.",1340064000,3,938,4.943037974683544
8418279,1,B0047O2FJ4,There are three positive reviews of this DVD which appear to be created by people associated with this DVD; let me tell you the reality.  I bought this DVD because I am interested in Jung and also the Red Book.  This DVD is a total and complete ripoff.  The speaker is a befuddled man who had no ability to give a presentation; it is complete disorganized and he is standing in a conference room; for much of the DVD some speaker phone goes off speaking over him!  This is a true rip off and the producers are shameless in selling this to unwitting consumers.  Buyer beware!,1333238400,5,574,4.377358490566038
