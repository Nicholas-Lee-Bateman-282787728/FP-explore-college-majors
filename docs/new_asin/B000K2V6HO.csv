8154041,5,B000K2V6HO,"Some people think that an indie made by a new director would not be that great, but I would have to say that, that does not apply here. This movie has very good acting, great quality, good vision, and very good cinematography. I think everyone will like this movie, although there are a few scenes that may be a little too sexually charged for the little ones...there are no love making scenes, just a lot of kissing and light innuendos.

I am definitely looking forward to see what else this director and actors put out!",1162944000,,521,4.484210526315789

Originally it was supposed to be 90 minutes, but luckily some of the best footage that didn't make it into the film made it into the outtakes.  Jefferson is realistically torn up as the heart broken Chris, and Josh bumblingly warm as the well-intentioned bu hapless Rob Motley.  Alex, one of the most interesting characters to watch, is the one character who you want to know more about, and whose botched relationship you want to understand more about.  The cinematography is done extremely well, with rich vivid sets that a lot of time, thought and effort went into.  The soundtrack and sound quality are both top notch, and help draw you into the movie.  Overall, it didn't turn out the way I expected from reading the first script, but I was pleasantly surprised at the overall quality and enjoyable experience I met on screen.  I'd definitely recommend it for anyone of any age, this holiday season or next!",1162857600,,960,4.644970414201183
