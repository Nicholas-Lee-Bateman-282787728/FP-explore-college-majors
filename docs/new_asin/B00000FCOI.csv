7908372,3,B00000FCOI,"A violent western that takes place in Mexico before the collapse of Emperor Maximilian, The Bandits looks like a synthesis of John Sturges The Magnificent Seven and Sam Peckinpahs The Wild Bunch.  Three selfish gringos find themselves in the thick of the revolution against the French.  Things get off to an interesting start with the eponymous trio, Chris Barrett (Robert Conrad of Young Dillinger), Josh Racker (Roy Jensen of Ride Lonesome) and Taye 'Boy' Brown (future Disney star Jan-Michael Vincent), straddling their horses under a tree with nooses looped about their necks.  Miguel Valdez (Manuel Lpez Ochoa) and his compadres gun down the bounty hunters who were about to hang our heroes.  Chris, Josh, and Boy accompany Valdez and his men into Mexico and participate briefly in the revolution.  They set a trap for Captain Sanchez and he falls into it without a second thought.  Our heroes help Valdez wipe out the French to the last man.  Miraculously, Sanchez survives the shoot-out and Valdez, in a moment of weakness, lets him live.  Afterward, Chris, Josh, and Boy ride into Valdezs village.  As it turns out, the inhabitants of Valdezs village have a low opinion of Americans.  The thing that stands out about the three outlaw Americans is that they shun wearing headgear.  Valdez tries to shame his fellow villagers when they refuse to come out and greet their American guests.  This scene is reminiscent of a similar scene in The Magnificent Seven when the peasants are too timid to come out to greet the seven gunslingers.  Chris has a fling with a lady from the village.  Later, the villainous French commander who was allowed to live after his initial encounter with Valdez shows up and has the lady executed by a firing squad.  Pretty soon our gringo heroes feel compassion toward the poor villagers.  Chris shoots the commander and dies in a hail of gunfire.  Boy goes down shooting.  The supreme surprise here is not only does Robert Conrad and Jan-Michael Vincent bite the dust, but the villains triumph over them in the end.  In a change of pace, our unrepentant heroes pay the ultimate price, and ironically one of them meets his death at the end of a rope.  The scenery is fresh and sprawling, and composer Manuel Espern has written a powerful score that celebrates the bravura of the country and the hardy individuals who thrive in it.  Indeed, this is the kind of Robert Conrad picture where he sheds his shirt during his scene with his lover.  The gunfights are loud and noisy.  The Bandits isn't a predictable, run-of-the-mill oater.  Production values are sturdy.  Clocking in at a trim 88 minutes, this solid, compact, little horse opera never wears out its welcome.",1404345600,,2699,4.8791208791208796
7908373,1,B00000FCOI,"I bought this movie because I am a big fan of Robert Conrad and the wild wild west is my favorite tv show from when I was a kid in the early 70's. Even though they were repeats, that show was great, and I can think of no other than Robert Conrad to play Jim West, along with Ross Martin as Artemus Gordon. This movie was made when Conrad was in his prime, he must have side-tracked from the wild wild west, in order to be in this terrible movie. Maybe he thought that he might make it big on the big screen. Unfortunatley, this movie is a flop! Barely understandable, the acting is terrible, all around him! Why put Jim West in a terrible movie like this? I really couldn't follow it, and found myself reading a magazine, and hoping it would get better or end soon.
  I can compare this movie to Lee Van Cleef, another great actor, capable of terrific peformances, but yet he was in so many lousy B-westerns that you sort of believe that a good script, and coworkers can make or break an actor. He will never be forgotten for his performences in the good, the bad, and the ugly, or for a few dollars more. But death rides a horse, and so many others were forgettable. At least Robert Conrad only made one bad western that I know of. Stick to what your good at, they say. Don't waste your money on this movie.",1269302400,,1308,4.207171314741036
