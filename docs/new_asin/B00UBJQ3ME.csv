7035573,5,B00UBJQ3ME,"Who doesn't love Daniel Tiger?  We have been enjoyed watching his show for several years and even have the games on our devices. On this DVD, Daniel learns about safety at the beach and visits the Enchanted Garden to pick strawberries.  And when a windstorm makes a mess of the neighborhood playground, Daniel and his friends and neighbors work together to clean up and make it ready to play again.  It has a run time of 100 min. and includes the following episodes

Daniel Explores Nature
Its a beautiful day in the Neighborhood! Daniel and his family are spending the day outside exploring, when Daniel spots a beautiful red bird. As they watch the busy bird, they learn about how a birds nest is built. But when the nest falls out of the tree, will Daniel and Katerina be able to help?

Daniels Nature Walk
Theres so much to explore when you're outside! Daniel is going on a nature walk in the forest with O the Owl and Uncle X. They see frogs, worms and even spot a rainbow in the sky!

Safety at the Beach
Daniel and Katerina are playing on Jungle Beach with Mom Tiger. The children get a bit carried away by their treasure hunting play and they drift too far away from Mom. They learn that to stay safe near the water, they need to stop and listen!

Neighborhood Clean Up
A wind storm has made a mess of the Neighborhood playground and no one can play.  When King Friday proclaims that it is Clean Up Day, everyone helps restore the playground by throwing out and recycling the trash.  The children learn that by working together, the playground can be ready for play again in no time!

Fruit Picking Day
Daniel and his friends are enjoying a Fruit Festival in the Enchanted Garden.  Prince Wednesday grows upset because his big brother Prince Tuesday can pick the highest fruit off the tree branches, but he cant.  He wishes he wasn't so little!  Then, when the festival-goers spot a very special magical golden pear on the ground, Prince Wednesday is the only one little enough to reach it.

A Trip to the Enchanted Garden
The Tiger family is making strawberry pancakes for breakfast this morning, but when Mom looks more closely in the kitchen, she realizes there are no more strawberries left.  They all head to the Enchanted Garden, where Mom Tiger shows Daniel the strawberry patch.  Daniel is very curious, and learns that if he looks closely, he may be able to answer his own questions about how strawberries grow and learn something new.

Daniel Plays Ball
Daniel, Miss Elaina and Prince Wednesday are at the park with Prince Tuesday. They decide to play a game with a ball. Daniel struggles to catch the ball and gets very frustrated. All of his friends remind him to keep on trying and finally, he succeeds!

The Royal Sandbox
Daniel and Prince Wednesday are making sand pies in the sandbox. They decide to top off a sand pie with Prince Tuesdays royal crown, but they soon see that this wasn't such a good idea. They learn how to apologize to Prince Tuesday and make the situation better  by helping clean the crown and promising to ask first next time.
