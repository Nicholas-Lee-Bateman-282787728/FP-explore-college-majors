8751714,5,B01BW832O4,"(NOTE-this is a PAL DVD-will not play in most US DVD players-amazon has it listed as NTSC which it is not. This may be worth an investment in a region-free player!) Goblin Rebirth features the 'classic' Goblin rhythm section of Fabio Pignatelli on bass & Agostino Marangolo on drums with brilliant instrumentalist Aidan Zammit on keyboards (he performed with the 'official' Goblin US tour in 2013), Danilo Cherni, on keyboards & Giacomo Anselmi on guitars & bouzouki. The performances are all stellar-arrangements are true to the original recordings with occasional new embellishments to keep things fresh & exciting. Seeing the players execute these complex arrangements so flawlessly is impressive! The editing (by Aidan Zammit) is superb, covering all the players (you get to see the instruments as well as the instrumentalists & what they are doing) as well the amazing light-show & some of the projected film clips (which have some effects as well-not just straight film clips edited together). The pieces played cover all of Goblin's history (including Pignatelli's Goblin OST's BUIO OMEGA, CONTAMINATION & THE CHURCH) & of course classics from DAWN OF THE DEAD, SUSPIRIA, DEEP RED & TENEBRAE (the arrangements are amazing!). No tracks from their self-titled studio album (which had yet to be recorded-it is also a must have for fans). Final word-get this release if you can (it will play on computer-listen with headphones)!",1461024000,,1431,5.226086956521739
