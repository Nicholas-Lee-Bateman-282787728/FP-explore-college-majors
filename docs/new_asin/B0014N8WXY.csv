Yes it's a little cheesy and dated but that's all part of the appeal, along with the fact that it takes place on a tropical island for a change. Anyway to make a long story short- I ended up giving away my copy thinking I'd just get another one. WRONG! Apparently it's out of print. I looked everywhere. And now sellers on Amazon are asking for $208.00 ? I don't think I'll be getting this back into my collection anytime soon sorry to say. Waiting for the price to drop. Perhaps it will be available again for a lower price. Just have to wait and see. Great movie but not at that price.",1506038400,,738,4.096551724137931

8256129,5,B0014N8WXY,"This movie is hysterical.  The relationship between Godzilla and his adopted son is touching and very monster-like.  The other creatures are a bit gross to watch, but I loved Godzilla giving his son tough love.  C'mon-man up and assert your atomic breath kid!",1373500800,,259,4.976744186046512
