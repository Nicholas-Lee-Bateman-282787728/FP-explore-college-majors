8004980,3,B0000ZR1H0,"The Bolshoi is one of the finest ballet companies in the world, but although the dancing was good, the quality of the recording is dismal, and the staging and costuming are not much better.  This was from 1978, so a long time ago, but my Barishnikov/Kirkland DVD recorded in 1977 is superb and still very magical, so unless you want to see the Bolshoi dancers, specifically, buy a different version.  The Birmingham Ballet with Miyako Yoshida is one of my top two favorites and really over the top in every way.",1418947200,,511,4.604395604395604
8004981,5,B0000ZR1H0,"The fabulous soloists V. Vassiliev and E. Maximova with world famous producer Yuri Grigorovich did it again! There are none is better than old Russian ballet school in the world! This is a historical production from 1978 was converted to DVD version in 2003 by Universal Music & Video Distribution, Universal City, CA 91608, so consider some technical imperfections in the recording. Great production!",1379894400,,401,5.28125
8004982,3,B0000ZR1H0,"Amazon has their Nutcracker DVDs a bit scrambled.

This release is the same as the one listed a few above here.  Both are DVDs of the 1978 Bolshoi performance.  The RE-release may have been done in 2004 but this is a much more primitive production dating from 1978.  I've reviewed it above with the other listing, and also the same performance on a different Kultur Video release, also listed above with different cover art.

In a nutshell, the performance is great (especially the two principals)  but the production (i.e. sound and video production) is primitive.  If you can get past the poor production then it's a diamond in the rough.  If you can't it's just rough.  At $5 or less though it's hard to go too wrong.",1222300800,3,720,4.606299212598425
