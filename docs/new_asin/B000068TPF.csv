1726268,3,B000068TPF,"This double feature consists of two of the less successful ""horror"" movies of the late 60s.  After all the Poe hits American International had during the sixties, they must have been disappointed with these films' lack of audience approval.  Although SCREAM is a cult favorite, it still suffers from many flaws.

In THE OBLONG BOX, Vincent Price is somewhat subtler in earlier roles, and his character who starts out sort of heroic is later seen as the real culprit of the film.  The movie's snail pacing doesn't help, and Christopher Lee looks like he wishes he had done another Dracula movie.  What hurts the film the most is its treatment of the ""villain,"" Edward Markham.  Supposedly horribly disfigured for killing a native in Africa, it takes the film forever to show us the man's face and when they do, it's about as frightening as a butterfly.  Its ending is also wickedly tame, and it is not one of the better Poe adaptations.

In SCREAM AND SCREAM AGAIN, screenwriter Christopher Wicking's plot is so disjointed, ineffectively tying the threads to all the different scenarios; the direction is uninspired and has one of the most boring car chases in cinema; and the pursuit of the Vampire Killer (horribly played by Michael Gothard) is so overdrawn, with countless scenes of inept police work, and scenes of Gothard running up hillsides and through valleys.  The club band, Amen Corner, is absolutely atrocious, even singing a song called ""Scream and Scream Again.""  Yipes.

Why bother?  It's always good to see three masters of horror in any film, although Lee, Cushing and Price have very little screen time in SCREAM.  Lee also has little screen time in BOX.  But these gentlemen, only Lee still alive, were masters of the horror genre, and though this certainly doesn't represent their best work, if you are fans of theirs, you'll still have a good time.",1102204800,,1868,4.870253164556962
1726269,5,B000068TPF,"this DVD combines two of Vincent's under-rated horror films from this era. ""Scream and Scream Again"" is a great movie...but the people at AIP ruined the film's legacy by giving Vincent top billing. the reason? Vincent is only in maybe 20 minutes of the movie...and this isn't an uninterrupted 20 minutes either. his big scene is in the lab at the end of the film as he kills one of his own robots that have gone corrupt, only to be confronted by Christopher Lee's character in an eerie scene. Peter Cushing's role is two scenes, and he's killed by the main robot or ""composite"" as Vincent calls them. However, these three horror legends have no scenes together and each one has nearly a minute or two of on-screen time sandwiched between other scenes with the London police and the scientist/coroner on the case. this is a good movie...but beware that the three horror legends that get top billing ARE NOT the stars of the film! the other film, ""The Oblong Box"", IS a Vincent Price starring film. He plays the brother of a man who was mutated in Africa by a bunch of witch-doctors for a crime he didn't do. Price's character {Julian Markham} had killed a child {the victim of a horse trampling} but the natives grabbed the brother by mistake! forced to wear a crimson mask because of his scars, the brother {named Edward Markham} plots revenge on everybody. Christopher Lee plays a doctor named Neuhart who can't help the brother but nevertheless the brother demands satisfaction. later, when the insecure Edward {played by Alister Williamson} feels that the doctor is double-crossing him, a swift slice of the neck with a blade does the trick and Lee meets his demise midway through the film. Lee is wearing a grey wig for some reason!? it's rather funny seeing him in it and deliver his lines in that voice we all know and love! ""The Oblong Box"" is a mixture of voo-doo, cult, and African cultures very different from typical Price horror movies of the previous years by Roger Corman and William Castle. ""Scream and Scream Again"" is a good movie for what it deals with {1970, release} and ""The Oblong Box"" is also good {1969, release}.",1079222400,20,2137,4.6710875331564985
1726270,4,B000068TPF,"There are serveral good reviews of this DVD and I'll not go over ground that's been extensively covered. However, there are a couple of things not mentioned that should be. First, Scream and Scream Again, when it appeared in theaters, was spooky as hell. At least I thought so as a 13 year old. Second, the thread mentioned by several reviews of the runner who wakes up missing parts actually is not a separate thread at all, but background to the main story. You see, Price is making people out of spare parts and well . . . you have to get them from somewhere, don't you? Third, the movie is an adaptation of a book by the same title, written by Peter Saxon--a well respected English writer of gothic horror and mysteries.
The book's better, by the way.
The Oblong Box is sloooooooow.  Not terribly interesting and the end of the film is telegraphed well in advance. Price isn't at his best and I had the feeling this was one film he wasn't terribly interested in, himself.  If you like Price, though, it's worth watching.
Closed Captioning on the DVD is available, though the CC'ing on The Oblong Box is slightly late some of the time. You find yourself looking at someone talking, get about 2 seconds of CC'ing and then the scene will shift to another view, often of someone else and you're still reading the CC'ing. Annoying.",1061683200,23,1330,4.5375
1726271,3,B000068TPF,"The Oblong Box - Not a bad movie...deals with voodoo and revenge. Vincent Price plays Sir Julian Markham, an aristocrat, charged with the care of his brother, Edward, who was horribly disfigured in a voodoo ritual as punishment for some apparent crime he committed against the native tribe. Edward's face is messed up, along with his mind, and creates a devious plan to escape from his brother, who keeps him locked away in the attic. Well, the best-laid plans and such...something goes wrong, and Edward gets buried alive, but manages to escape and plots revenge. Christopher Lee has a bit part as an unscrupulous surgeon who performs experiments on freshly dead and buried bodies. The movie seems a little long-winded, and I felt about ten or fifteen minutes could have been shaved off, but no matter. The movie was passable, even though I saw the surprise ending coming a mile away.

The second feature was much more difficult to watch. Scream and Scream Again was a big mess of a movie. The first hour of the movie jumps between three different plot threads, and finally gets around to trying to tying them together late into the movie. The first thread involves a man who wakes up in a hospital room and only to find a limb missing. He wakes up at some later point, another limb is missing, and so on...the second thread involves Vincent Price as a doctor and a serial killer...the third involves a plot within a military state (the solders look Nazi in the way they dress, but the insignia is different). I ultimately think this movie was about the creation of a super race of human beings, but the scope of the story was too wide to convey this accurately. As I said, it's difficult to follow this movie until about an hour in, when they start to try and tie the loose plot threads together, but not very successfully. Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing make appearances, for like five minutes each, and Vincent price shows up early for a short bit and then at the end for like 15 minutes.

The quality on both pictures is pretty good and the audio is not too bad, although on Scream and Scream Again, I felt the dialogue got drowned out by the music at some points, causing it to become muddled. A couple of trailers, and that is it for extras. I like how MGM seems to now be releasing their Midnight Movies in a two for one deal, as if I had paid full price for one of these movies, I would have felt ripped off.",1058140800,6,2420,4.497727272727273
1726272,3,B000068TPF,"Heres one that i have to give only three stars as Scream and Scream Again is so very terrible. The Oblong Box on the other hand is a great Price horror flick and on its own would recieve 4 stars. You have Voodoo, a premature burial, lots of murder and mayhem and an ending that makes one shiver. At the low price these Midnight Movies are the best deals on DVD, and the double features are nothing less than a steal. The extras are next to none but the picture quality is great.",1038873600,4,478,4.150537634408602
1726273,3,B000068TPF,"Just as Karloff, Lugosi and Chaney were the horror actors of the 1930s and 1940s, the 1960s belonged to the trinity of Vincent Price, Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee. While Lee and Cushing worked together often, collaborations with Price were much less frequent. This DVD offers two such rare collaborations.
Scream and Scream Again is definitely the better of the two movies. It has its flaws: the plot is overly complicated and certain plot lines don't tie together for a long time, if truly ever. The story has something to do with a mad scientist (Price) who is performing mysterious experiments and a serial killer who frequents discos and is seemingly unkillable. Add to all this some intrigue with a East German-country, and you have a mess, but somehow a fun one.
Although billed as starring all three actors, this is misleading. Cushing is in the movie for all of five minutes, Lee not much longer. Only Price has a significant role, and even he's got a relatively small part. On the other hand, both Lee and Price have significant roles in the Oblong Box.
Unfortunately, this movie is pretty weak. Price plays a wealthy gentleman who has just returned from his African plantation, where his brother was hideously deformed as part of a native ritual. The brother, confined to Price's house, fakes his death and is buried alive, only to wind up in the custody of some grave robbers, who sell him to Lee, a doctor who hides him. The brother's quest for revenge occupies the rest of the movie.
The Oblong Box is pretty slow-moving and suspenseless, and even the big payoff, seeing the deformed brother's face at long last, is a disappointment: he's hardly scary or even grotesque.
At best, these are minor horror movies; for big fans of the genre, especially from the 1960s and 1970s, it may be worth watching. Others should find their thrills elsewhere",1033603200,54,1861,4.8006230529595015
1726274,4,B000068TPF,"Another excellent release from the Midnight Movie series of double features gives us the first and second collaborations of director Gordon Hessler & screenwriter Christopher Wicking. The first is `The Oblong Box'. Replacing the tragic Michael Reeves as director and getting Wicking to rewrite Laurence Huntingdon's script, Hessler's first AIP horror film isn't by any means a bad effort, beautifully shot and with some nice performances by Price and AIP's then-current scream queen Hilary Dwyer.
Of course, it's the second film, `Scream & Scream Again', that we have all been waiting for. Subject of one of Tim Lucas' very first Video Watchdog columns before he made it into a magazine, this has until now only been available on home video with a different music score composed by Kendall Schmidt, replacing the original music composed by David Whitaker. Well, the Whitaker score is now back, and its interesting to watch the film having got so used to Schmidt's electronic doodlings, which it turns out actually weren't that bad. In fact sometimes his score is better than Whitaker's own jazz-inspired music, which in places is quite inappropriate to the action taking place on screen.
Some of the reviews on this site have criticized the plotting. Certainly Hessler & Wicking have always maintained that the fragmentary disjointed nature of the story was always intentional. Anyone who has read the original novel `The Disorientated Man' by ""Peter Saxon"" (a pseudonym for any number of writers working at that particular publishing house at that time) will know that the novel is constructed like that anyway, possibly because multiple writers may have contributed to it. `We took out the blobs from space' said Wicking in an interview, but to be honest they don't seem to have done much else. On the other hand, the original screenplay was written  by Milton Subotsky who put everything into logical order, so maybe Hessler and Wicking deserve praise simply for going with a different kind of narrative style. Certainly `Scream & Scream Again' has often been beloved of `art-house horror' critics who have praised its paranoid conspiracy plotline. At least now we get to see it in 1:1.85 and with the original music as intended",1031616000,10,2231,5.112328767123287
1726275,3,B000068TPF,"Vincent Price and American International Pictures were at a lull in their respective careers  -  the Dr. Phibes films and Theater of Blood, which revived them both, were just around the corner  -  when these two were churned out.  Neither film is that good, though Scream and Scream Again was quite successful, both critically and commercially, at the time  -  which is ironic, since it's the weaker of the two.
Scream and Scream Again is a weak updated Frankenstein ripoff, with Price  -  in virtually nothing more than a cameo role  -  utilizing a synthetic process to graft and reanimate dead tissues into superhuman pseudo-living ""proto-people.""  The plot sounds better than the movie is.  Director Gordon Hessler put plenty of gruesome gore effects and gallons of blood into the mix, but missed the boat (along with screenwriter Christopher Wicking) on plot development  -  the movie is disjointed and often incomprehensible.  I've seen it a couple of times, once even not that long ago, and really couldn't tell you precisely what happens.  Except for the occasional splashes of gore, it just isn't really that memorable.
The Oblong Box, directed the preceding year by Hessler, is the better of the two, but still nothing worth writing home about.  Price sells out his brother for fame and fortune while the two are on expedition in Africa, grotesquely disfiguring him and burying him alive.  The brother manages to escape and pursue Price back to England, there to work out his own bit of personal revenge.  The plot and makeup effects are pretty good, but the script is on the plodding side.
Christopher Lee is on hand in both films  -  he and Price met, making them  -  but has little more to do than Price in the first.  They both get more action in The Oblong Box.  And Peter Cushing has a role as an ex-Nazi, in Scream and Scream Again.
These films are for serious collectors who want a complete  -  or at least representative  -  collection of AIP's or Vincent Price's (or Christopher Lee's, for that matter) output.  The idly curious will be disappointed.",1029974400,5,2069,4.792613636363637
1726280,4,B000068TPF,"Some years ago now , about the time of the first Vincent Price Blu Ray collection , I became a Price fan in earnest . Whist I was fool enough to sell that particular set away to a greater fan than I at the time and a happy home at least , I recognized almost immediately that I'd made a mistake  . For over a decade at that time I'd been steeping myself in all things Hammer and Amicus and British horror . No longer a passive Vincent Price fan , I've come to regard him and his films to be as satisfying as those of Peter Cushing , Christopher Lee and the like .
Initially this rental didn't grab me by the lapels for various reasons . A fantastic , lengthy and unusual chase sequence that culminated in a non ordinary manner got my attention and righted things for me though .
If you're a fan of the later 60's and 1970's fright films of Great Britain and the various folks on hand here I'd wager you'll enjoy the rental a good deal . I promptly bought Scream And Scream Again as part of a Midnite Movies double feature that also included The Oblong Box that I'd rented previously .",1458950400,,1084,4.137440758293839
1726281,2,B000068TPF,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

How could you go wrong with a horror film that proclaims Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee and Vincent Price all starring in the same film? Well the makers of this movie tried to do whatever they could wrong and have succeeded. A true disappointment for horror fans. I tried to like this one the first time I saw it and did again this time around. Both times left me wondering what they were thinking.

The plot put simply involves a serial killer who is draining the blood of his victims in London. The police track him down to the home of an eccentric scientists. From there more plotlines evolve including a top secret organization that plans on conquering the world with a superhuman race of beings theyve created. Tossed in are sequences in some Eastern European fascists state and various governmental groups in England and you have a mish mash of storylines that makes the movie confusing at best and nonsensical at worst. The story is so convoluted that you wonder just who is with or against who from scene to scene.

Perhaps the most terrible thing about this movie is that the three icons of horror included here are so utterly wasted it makes it apparent their inclusion was done just to sell tickets. Cushing has what amounts to a cameo appearance as does Lee. Price, a great actor when given the part, hams it up with a role that gets enough to not qualify as a cameo but isn't enough to get star billing either. The fact that they don't perform together also doesnt help this film.

Ive been stunned to find reviews where people have actually said they liked this film. For the most part horror fans have had little good to say about it over the years and the odds are that isn't likely to change with this version being made available. The only thing to keep this from 1 star were the extras that were worth watching.

Twilight Time has done their best to make this THE version you want to own but my suggestion would be that only fans invest the time and money for this one. While Twilight Time has done a great job on the extras I found them to be more interesting than the movie itself. Included are:
-An Isolated Score Track
-Audio Commentary with Film Historians David Del Valle and Tim Sullivan
-Gentleman Gothic: Gordon Hessler at AIP
-An Interview with Uta Levka
-A Still Gallery
-Radio Spots
-The Original Theatrical Trailer",1453334400,,2402,4.5638051044083525

1726285,2,B000068TPF,"""Scream And Scream Again"" is much messier than the murders at the heart of this mixture of horror and science fiction. If you stick with this fragmented sci-FI/horror/murder mystery, you'll  find an entertaining if flawed thriller. Directed by Gordon Hessler and written by Christopher Wicking, ""Scream And Scream Again"" finds the director and writer working once again with Vincent Price after their successful ""The Oblong Box"" (which, in spite of the title, has nothing to do with Poe).

Mixing Exsanguinated corpses left behind by a serial killer (without a drop of blood spilled), a mad doctor  (Price) doing sinister experiments, crypto-Nazis in an unknown European country and a corrupt official (the late Christopher Lee) topped off by a cameo by Peter Cushing and you have a 70's film with a muddled plot that works because of the performances. The fragmented structure of the film works to the benefit of the mystery as you're not quite sure how three different plot threads are tied into each other. It's fun  Good? Not so much but fun.

""Scream And Scream Again"" came courtesy of Amicus and did pretty well in theaters making triple the budget.

This Twilight Time release is limited to 3000 copies.

The transfer we get here is relatively clean and decent looking although I doubt it's much of an improvement over the DVD. This is another nice release from Twilight Time which gives us a special edition with expanded special features that will make this essential for those who picked up the bare bones DVD. The film clearly hasn't been restored some damage to the IP used here at least in one spot that I noticed but it isn't distractinf. There are plenty of speckles evident throughout the film. Detail varies as does depth.

The audio is solid throughout. It has fairly nice presence for a vintage mono soundtrack. The audio score supervised by former Who and Kinks producer Shel Talmy is quite ""groovy"" and sounds a bit like a Laurie Johnson knock off.

The film gets more love here than it probably got in every video incarnation of the film. We get a commentary track by David Del Vale and Tim Sullivan along with an isolated score. We also get a featurette on director Hessler who directed quite a few genre films. Actress Uta Levka appears in an interview done for this edition. We also get a stills gallery along with radio ads and the original trailer.

A interesting mixture of science fiction, horror and conspiracy genres, ""Scream And Scream Again"" is fun flick.

It's not a great film or even a very good one but it is fun.

2 stars for this looney but fun science fiction/horror hybrid.",1446422400,4,2614,4.7844444444444445
1726286,3,B000068TPF,"THE OBLONG BOX was the follow-up to the highly successful WITCHFINDER GENERAL which was directed by the highly regarded young director Michael Reeves. The prospect of making an anti-Colonial horror film would have appealed to Reeves but his early death in 1969 at the age of only 25 ended that. Director Gordon Hessler who took over was no Michael Reeves. The story of two 19th century brothers, one of whom is horribly disfigured by African witchcraft, could have been gripping but a confusing script coupled with uninspired direction make it uneven at best. Vincent Price returns to his theatrical style of acting and it seems out of place with the movie's realistic approach. However BOX has its moments including the disfigured brother's revenge on those who buried him alive, and the final revelation and resolution. Vincent Price, Christopher Lee and period horror fans should enjoy THE OBLONG BOX but present day horror fans will find it way too slow and too literary.

SCREAM & SCREAM AGAIN was based on a book called THE DISORIENTATED MAN by Peter Saxon (a nom de plume for different writers who worked on the manuscript). It's then contemporary setting, science fiction overtones, political conspiracy theories, and ramped up violence will have a much greater appeal to today's horror film audience. The film was promoted as featuring Price, Lee, and Peter Cushing although Cushing is so completely wasted, with virtually no screen time, that it made me very angry at the time. Watching it again, it still makes me angry. I didn't much care for SCREAM & SCREAM AGAIN when I first saw it. It seemed like a cross between THE AVENGERS (the TV show) and INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS but without the class of either although no less a filmmaker than Fritz Lang admired it. The fact that it was co-produced by Max J. Rosenberg & Milton Subotsky (the founders of Amicus Productions) was more disturbing than anything in the film although it does explain the film's lurid drive-in title. I still don't care for it.

The unholy trinity of producer Louis (Deke) M. Heyward, writer Christopher Wicking, and director Gordon Hessler were responsible for a series of British AIP films from 1969-1972.  The first was THE OBLONG BOX. Their period horror films show a complete lack of respect, almost contempt for the genre. SCREAM is considered the best of the 4 films the team made which is not surprising because of its modern day setting where the cynical attitude expressed is appropriate. I concur with that assessment but the wasted potential of the period films sometimes makes it hard for me to sit through them today. Another double bill in the MIDNITE MOVIES series features their other 2 films which are CRY OF THE BANSHEE and MURDERS IN THE RUE MORGUE which I have also reviewed but that was several years ago although I have since updated that review.

1726317,4,B000068TPF,"This double-sided disc contains two films that trumpet Vincent Price as starring in them but they are no more than extended cameos by the esteemed actor.  They are the equivalent of him sporting a smoking jacket and inviting to his study inquiring constables and offering them brandy and cigars before  disappearing for the rest of the movie.  Christopher Lee is also in the credits but he has scant screen time.  Ditto Peter Cushing who is only in ""Scream and Scream Again"" for a short time before his character is killed off.  Price, a noted collector of fine art, thankfully doesn't phone it in and I hope his participation in low budget films like these as well as episodic TV like ""Batman"" and ""The Brady Bunch"" helped finance his hobby.
""The Oblong Box"" is somewhat middling Poe.  It contains some generally scary moments and has a certain Hammeresque look to it.  There are bits of macabre humor but a lot of the performances are strictly hambone.  Three stars.
I have fond memories of ""Scream and Scream Again"" from my ""Creature Double Feature"" days of watching UHF Channel 48 in Philadelphia.  It seemed like it and ""Zontar, Thing From Venus"" were on every other week.  The setting is swinging London circa 1969.  The town is vulnerable to vampire killings, replicants that can lift cars with their brute strength, and healthy persons unsuspectingly being decapitated.  This is all very engaging and you can throw in a malevolent organization that reminds you of KAOS from ""Get Smart"" seemingly orchestrating these events.  For sheer camp value I give this one the pass as well as a car chase that passes the ""Bullit"" smell test.  Four stars.",1377907200,2,1651,4.829181494661921

1726331,4,B000068TPF,"This is an interesting, entertaining and somewhat disappointing double feature from amazing ghoulish Vincent Price (and Christopher Lee).  The former statement might befuddle some readers so please allow me to elaborate on each film.

The first movie is ""The Oblong Box"", based off a story of Edgar Allan Poe.  I am familiar with Poe's work, but not this tale, as strange as that might sound. Nevertheless, Vincent Price plays noble man named Julian who has his brother Edward locked in a room due to some unfortunate event that transpired in Africa. It appears that Edward is under an African voodoo curse and has been left with a disfigured face.

Well to paraphrase, Edward plans an escape which ends up having him being mistaken for dead.  Until he is discovered by Dr. Neuhartt (Christopher Lee) who is in the grave robbing business in order to study human anatomy.  Edward ends up black mailing Dr. Neuhartt and starts a murderous spree that leaves his brother Julian scratching his head. There is a bit more to it, but this is basically it.  The movie is a period piece taking place near the turn of the century. As a matter of fact, it looks a lot like a Hammer Horror movie.

The second movie is ""Scream and Scream Again"".  This movie is a bit more challenging for me to describe. This is due to the fact the multiple storylines never really seem to gel. There is this militant fascist group who is taking various body parts and is creating pseudo people.  Meanwhile there is a vampire like killer running around accosting young women.  The police are investigating these murders, while a young medical doctor aids in the search, Vincent Price also plays another medical doctor who might be linked to both the killings and ""make a person project"".  Christopher Lee plays a business man and Peter Cushing plays a general.

The major problem I have with ""Scream and Scream Again"" is the lack of the marquee stars.  Vincent Price is in the movie maybe fifteen minutes, Christopher Lee present for six minutes and Peter Cushing is in a scene that lasts maybe two and half minutes, isn't that disgusting?  I was also very disappointed with the lack of interaction between the three stars.  Price & Lee share a scene; Cushing is on an island alone.

However once I got pass the lack of the ""big 3"" and confusing story, this was one entertaining movie.  There was plenty of action and the pathos of the 1970s is extremely apparent, right down to the theme song that shares the name of the film.  In other words I never felt like I was bored.  There is one scene where a pseudo man ripped his hand off from a hand cuff, interesting stuff.  I truly wish that ""Scream and Scream Again"" didn't even mention that Peter Cushing was in the movie.  A surprise cameo would have been cooler, if one can't tell I am a Cushing fan.

I personally felt that ""The Oblong Box"" is the stronger movie out of the two.  The performances are better, the mood is more eerie, and the film is leveled yet not schizophrenic. I didn't find the pace of this movie slow or languid, rather it allowed for quite a nice zenith.  Christopher Lee was sporting a gray wig in this movie, great stuff.  It was also cool to see Mr. Lee call his housekeeper a slut, priceless.  It is unfortunate that Lee and Price only share one small scene. However, in this movie Christopher Lee is listed as a ""special guest star"" yet has a much larger role than in ""Scream and Scream Again"".

The DVD is a flipper disc, one movie on each side.  As for special features, the movies have options for subtitles and the original trailer/preview is included. One footnote about the trailer for ""Scream and Scream Again"", when Peter Cushing's name is displayed it is over another actor. Huh? I digress, these movies are presented in letterbox and the picture is very clear.  I would say these movies are a nice way to pass a couple of hours. I much rather watch them then mow the lawn.",1305676800,7,3931,4.574285714285714
1726332,4,B000068TPF,"If one of his films can bring mild discomfort, a Gordon Hessler double bill is enough to drive some people to glue. 'Psychotronic' states, with typical perspicacity, that Hessler has no fans and his movies are worth zip.
Fair enough. I don't agree but have every sympathy. His 'style' divides. He thinks shooting from strange and uncomplimentary angles makes his movies 'edgy' and 'art.' He is probably wrong.
Occasionally, I'm quite fond of his pyrotechnics ~ others are not. Here, his arrangements work quite well on one movie ~ not so well on the other.

1726361,5,B000068TPF,"Scream and Scream Again is a rather astounding assemblage of film and sound clips that are fantastic to the trained eye and a bewildering mess to someone expecting a movie of the horror genre.  As a film, it's much less than the sum of its parts.  I'll avoid addressing the film as the other reviews give it proper treatment and stick to discussing scenes and sound production.

Record collectors and music historians are in for a complete treat.  The soundtrack is done by none other than Shel Talmy and its fantastic!  Everything he learned making the best music ever recorded by The Who, The Kinks, The Creation and a pubescent David Bowie are brought to bear in this production.  Freakbeat fans are in for a real treat with two nightclub numbers by Amen Corner along with dancing crowds dressed in Carnaby Street's finest fashions c. 1968-69.  The music is only occasionally in-sync with the plot line and does little to help the story.

Set designers will drool over the above nightclub scenes and many long-panning sequences of swinging London and the English countryside c. 1969 with racing Jaguars, MG's and Bentleys.  The purple poofy shirt of the nightclub vampire killer is all you need to start your own mod-psych-pop band.  Lee, Cushing and the English cast get to stroll around in fantastic wardrobe.  Lee is surprisingly strong and believable as a government heavy even though he's barely got two pages of dialog in the film.  Surprisingly, nobody on this thread has mentioned the ~30 second uncredited cameo of Boris Karloff as a forensic pathologist for the government trying to dissect the vampire's hand.  A rare easter egg as the role is appropriately played purely for humor.  Many of the other sets are elaborate, shot at strange angles, use funky lighting and provide better things to look at than attempting to follow the weak plot.  It's even stranger that many of the actors provide excellent work for such an atrocious script.  I'll assume most of them read the book beforehand and had definite opinions on how they wanted to play their respective role.  Naturally, the film decides to focus on the least interesting actors in this piece.  It's easy to see how this film was influenced by The Prisoner and in turn influenced Cronenberg in Videodrome.",1296432000,2,2277,4.87012987012987

1726364,3,B000068TPF,"An interesting pairing of two late 1960s Vincent Price epics, one of which is a bit hidebound, while the other is a fascinating enigma.  The hidebound one is ""The Oblong Box,"" ostensibly part of AIP's Edgar Allan Poe series, but having nothing whatsoever to do with Poe.  It is the story of two brothers, one of whom has been cursed and disfigured by a voodoo witch doctor, becoming a sort of mad ""Phantom of the Opera""-like masked figure.  Meanwhile brother Julian (Price) is trying to live a normal life, while keeping his brother locked up in the attic.  He gets out, of course, and wreaks havoc.  Australian character actor Alister Williamson plays the role of the disfigured brother, but not particularly well.  His voice behind the mask is apparently dubbed, and he possesses no particular gift for pantomime.  Christopher Lee, who has a thankless marquee-value-only role as a doctor, would have been wonderful as the brother, given his ability to physicalize his acting, but by 1969 he was too big a star to keep masked throughout (originally, Price was slated to play both roles, which might have worked with a masked double).  ""The Oblong Box"" was supposed to be director Michael Reeves' follow-up to ""Witchfinder General"" (""The Conquerer Worm"" in the US) and features both Hillary Dwyer and Rupert Davies from ""Witchfinder,"" but Reeves died before filming began, and the project was given to Gordon Hessler.  The last-minute-takeover quality of the direction shows.  The biggest problem, perhaps, is that the final revelation of Williamson's disfigured face definitely disappoints, particularly after the build-up it has been given.  Instead of something as shocking as Chaney's Opera Phantom, we are confronted with what looks like a middle-aged man hit in the face with a pie. ""The Oblong Box"" is not without its moments, but it is one of the least of the Poe cycle.

""Scream and Scream Again,"" however, is a must-see for anyone addicted to the cinema of the weird.  The story is so scattershot it is hard to summarize--something about synthetic vampires made by a mad doctor, a foreign goverment planting spies, and a shadowy Whitehall office--but it is undeniably entertaining.  Think of ""The Prisoner"" meeting Jack the Ripper, with a little Dracula thrown in, all set in ""1984"" and you get an idea of the overall effect. Vincent Price is the mad doctor, Christopher Lee the mysterious government official, and Peter Cushing (in a thankless cameo) is the leader of the unnamed foreign power.  There's also a terrific extended chase scene, some really bad disco sequences, vats of acid in country manor houses, and...oh, what's the point of listing it all?  Just sit back, watch, and enjoy the kind of film they just don't make anymore.",1263168000,3,2749,4.995614035087719

1726366,5,B000068TPF,"""The Oblong Box""/""Scream and Scream Again"" is an excellent pair of Vincent Price horror fare from MGM.  Price is in top form and, in both movies, he stars with horror icon, Christopher Lee, who is most notable for his Dracula role in the Hammer productions.  Unfortunately, however, they only share one scene in each film.

  ""The Oblong Box,"" based on an Edgar Allan Poe story, is gothic horror sent in 1865 and is the best of the pair.  This is the tale of the two Markham brothers who own an African plantation.  A native boy is seriously disfigured in a riding accident.  The tribal voodoo witch doctor curses Edgar Markham with a disfiguring illness that drives him insane.  Upon returning to England, Julian (played by Price) keeps his brother Edgar locked in the attic.  Edgar escapes by feigning death and is buried alive.  His co-conspirators betray him and do not dig up his grave.  Meanwhile, Lee is an evil doctor who needs fresh bodies for his experiments.  His ghouls dig up Edgar's grave.  Donning, a red hood, Edgar begins killing those who betrayed him.

  ""The Oblong Box"" is a good slasher film and a good mystery for those who love gothic horror.  The plot is intricate, the acting is good, and the throat slashings are graphic and gory.

  ""Scream and Scream Again"" is another high body count horror film set in the ""groovy"" sixties.  A new political Communist-like party has taken over England; they utilize strong, ruthless mad men who are robots (i.e., composites) to carry out their evil plans.  Price is a government funded scientist who created the composites.  Lee is a politician who wants to cover up Price's projects because one of his earlier experiments has been murdering beautiful young women and draining them of blood like a vampire.

  The plot for ""Scream and Scream Again"" is very complex, almost too complex, and it has too many villains.  There is never a dull moment as the bodies begin piling high.  Three horror icons star in this movie.  One of them, Peter Cushing, has a cameo.  Christopher Lee is underused .  The lead character appears to be the young medical examiner who performs the autopsies on the ""vampire"" victims; he investigates Price.  The ending was a little disappointing, almost contrived as if the writers were struggling about how to wrap it up.

  This movie double feature is a must have for fans of gothic slashers, Vincent Price, and Christopher Lee.  Neither feature has any extras except for the trailers.",1208390400,4,2475,4.807142857142857
1726367,4,B000068TPF,"The Oblong Box is a good movie loosely based on the story of the same name by Edgar Allan Poe.  Honestly, it is probably my least favorite of the Price-Poe movies, but that still means that I enjoy it.  I think that Vincent Price and Christopher Lee are good in their roles, but the movie moves along a little slowly for my taste.  It is an interesting take on the story and real fans of Poe and Price will most likely enjoy it.
I hadn't seen Scream and Scream Again until I purchased this DVD.  I was expecting something along the lines of Dr. Phibes or Theater of Blood.  I was a bit surprised when Price only appeared for a couple of minutes in the first hour, but he returns at the end to tie things together albeit loosely.  It did seems strange that one of the longest sections that didn't jump around between different characters involved a long car chase.  Now, I must admit that it is kind of a fun car chase, but it seemed a little long for this movie.  I really don't understand why the police wouldn't shoot the guy after he had attacked several officers, but that's just me.  It definitely has an interesting twist that I don't want to give away.  If you are watching it for Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee I have to give you a warning.  They are both brilliant in their parts, but their screen time is incredibly short.  I doubt that either movie will really scare you, but the stories are interesting enough that I recommend giving them a chance.  Everyone's tastes in movies change so these movies will appeal greatly to some and completely not interest others.",1189814400,2,1579,4.422145328719723
1726368,4,B000068TPF,"The opening premise of THE OBLONG BOX is almost identical to the Peter Davison DOCTOR WHO story, ""Black Orchid"".  A man returns from Africa, cursed by tribal magic, disfigured & insane, and kept a prisoner in his own home by his family.  But whereas on the WHO story that was the punch line, here's it's just the springboard.  Said victim secretly pays some friends to help him escape his brother-- Vincent Price-- who comes across as much nicer than most of these films, but all the same seems to be hiding something.  Via more witch doctor ""magic"", the man fakes his own death... but then things go astray.  SERIOUSLY astray.  He's buried alive, then his ""body"" is stolen by grave-robbers in the employ of an unscrupulous medical adventurer. (One expects Peter Cushing in such a role, but NO! --it's Christopher Lee!)  WHY his ""friends"" failed to follow-thru on their plan is a complete mystery to me-- I blame an unpolished script.  It would have been a much more entertaining (and sensible) twist if they'd actually TRIED digging him up only to find the grave-robbers got their FIRST...!  But no.  The result:  in addition to wanting to find out WHY he had a jungle curse put on him, Price's brother now wants REVENGE on everyone involved.  Armed with a mask and a VERY sharp knife, his antics in the film's 2nd half make this seem like a Victorian-era installment of the HALLOWEEN series!!!

I understand the late Michael Reeves was scheduled to direct; this may explain why Price, Rupert Davies (DRACULA HAS RISEN FROM THE GRAVE) and Hilary Dwyer (CRY OF THE BANSHEE) are all together again following WITCHFINDER GENERAL-- and why there's so much pointless VIOLENCE in the story.  While that film disturbed me in the EXTREME each time I sat thru it, OBLONG BOX is a LOT more ""fun""-- if you can get past the growing number of bodies, most of which were killed in particularly brutal and senseless fashion.  2 interesting things I noticed about this plot, as it goes on nearly every character seems to be BLACKMAILING somebody (it seems EVERYBODY has some secret they don't want known), and the sympathetic-yet-INSANE victim/SLASHER only seems to kill people who've done wrong.  (The sweet, innocent housekeeper gets terrified and dragged thru the woods, but nothing REALLY happens to her!)

Interesting cameos to watch for:  Colin Jeavons (Inspector Lestrade on the Jeremy Brett HOLMES series) plays a police inspector, as does Ivor Dean (Inspector Teal on the Roger Moore SAINT series!).

With this film, producer Louis M. Heyward & director Gordon Hessler began a string of collaborations, all of which were somewhat iffy.  Like WAR-GODS OF THE DEEP (which Heyward produced) OBLONG BOX feels like the script could have used to fine-tuning.  (WHY did Price do what he did before the picture started?  HOW was it nobody at his brother's viewing realized the body on display was SOMEBODY ELSE?  etc.)  All the same, I find it more watchable than most of these.",1155686400,3,2964,4.8585657370517925
1726369,3,B000068TPF,"It's hard to give an accurate star rating to this dvd considering one film is good and the other is not so good.  I figure three stars will be good enough.  The Oblong Box is a cool little number in the Price tradition.  While Price and his brother are in Africa, a voodoo priest puts the wammy on Price's brother and he ends up disfigured.  Back home, he lives chained up in Price's mansion coz he, like Mrs. Bates, goes a little mad sometimes.  A series of events leaves Price's brother literally buried alive, and when he gets out he's understandably pissed, and he's out for a little payback.  That's the general idea, I spared you the details.  It's a good movie.  Not Price's best by a long shot, but worth the time.

Scream And Scream Again on the other hand isn't so good.  It's got a great idea behind it, but it actually ends up being quite boring, especially in a sequence where police chase a killer. This scene goes on waaaayyyyyyyyy too long.  In this film, we have a creepy organization that plays Frankenstein by trying to create a race of synthetic, perfect human beings.  And the cast is an eye catcher-Price, Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing.  How can you turn that down?  Well, don't expect to see much of either three stars in this film.  Price pops up in two short scenes and in the last 5 minutes or so.  Cushing has only one scene!!!  I wonder why he even agreed to do it at all.  And Lee's in about three short scenes.  Pretty disappointing that these three horror giants would be in such throwaway roles.  It's worth watching to say you've seen it.

Every time he wakes up in his hospital bed, another piece of him is missing! He's a stitch! All in all, this is a great double feature...",1109721600,2,1949,4.8558558558558556

7964605,5,B000068TPF,Scream & Scream Again is wonderfully disturbing & madcap - Vinnie Price at his best. With cameos by wonderful Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee.,1501286400,,144,5.041666666666667
7964606,5,B000068TPF,The two horror films of this double feature sure we're interesting!,1494633600,,67,5.181818181818182
7964607,3,B000068TPF,"Scream and Scream Again is misleading you had Price, Cushing and Lee all in the film but only briefly. Cushing is in it for about the time you sip a cup of coffee. One sip of coffee. Lee has one big scene and Price carries what he is given to a 2 star film. It's not that bad just 3 horror Legends are wasted and not used.

  The Oblong Box was a better film Price and Lee do well. Don't suit up your tuxedo for best horror movie of that year but Lee and Price in a half way decent script will deliver. To me Price shines in this one. I think he had an uncanny ability to make the worst b movies into something memorable. Price and Lee are such great actors you would just about watch them in anything. This is a 4 star film.",1492646400,,725,3.9183673469387754
7964608,2,B000068TPF,"Terrible movie, carelessly made and padded out with an interminable and repetitive chase scene.  Huge waste of talent.  Vincent Price, a quick study with any script, seems always to fumble about for his characterization when Gordon Hessler is at the helm.  The appearances of Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing are blink-and-you'll-miss-it brief, and wasted.",1484006400,,357,5.574074074074074

7964610,3,B000068TPF,"SCREAM AND SCREAM AGAIN is a weird 70's sci-fi thriller film, not an actual Horror film
produced by American int' pictures back in 1970
the whole film is set in modern day U.K. somewhere i think it's London 1970
even thou the plot is fragmented most of the film is based on Vincent price who plays mad doctor
who's clinic specializes in Limb & organ transplantation from mudered London citizens
but the limbs & organs are somehow tranferred into Super human form
Vincent price's character is a super human person with amazing strength
i don't know it's confusing
but some of the scenes from the film have the local police try to capture a serial killer terrorizing London's club scene
this particular serial killer played by british Actor Michael Gothard acts as a super human monster with amazing strength
in one scene he's able to tear his hand off from the hand cuffs that was cuffed to him
and continues to run off the police are confused so the pursuit continues
finally Keith played by Michael Gothard is trapped in falls into an Acid bath
anyway TWILIGHT TIME got the rights to the film from MGM are released it on blu-ray for the first time ever
tragically the HD transfer that TT did for the film is terrible, the transfer is suppose to be 1080p much higher quality than dvd
but instead looks more like dvd transfer to me there's still lots of Grain and Dirt in the picture pretty pathetic effort by TT
the sound quality is no different the sound is Mono sound, hasn't been boosted at all to 2.0 master stereo mix how pathetic
looks like the only effort TT did was give new extras for this blu-ray release
a new retrospective featurette has been added, this 23mins featurette is about Gordon Hessler & AIP
there's new interviews with Film Historians Steve Haberman, Director Jeff burr & other Film Historians
who studied Gordon Hessler's career with AIP, interesting featurette worth watching
there's also a interview with German actress Uta Levka who played Vincent price's assistant nurse in the film
who also had super human strength in the film
the interview is archive interview from 2000 filmed in Germany by German cameraman
even thou Uta speaks excellent English her interview is German with English subtitles
even when she's speaking English there's subtitles anyway
the interview goes for about 8mins which she talks alot about here acting jobs with AIP basically
and one of them was playing the super human nurse in Scream/scream again
she admits she can't remember her role in the film specifically
she's also very unaware/surprised that the film has become a cult film with many fans in the U.K & U.S.
there's also a new commentary track by Film Historians David del valle & Tim sullivan who work for TT
they've given other commentaries for other TT blu-ray reissues aswell
the other one was Count yorga vampire
there's also booklet included aswell
so is this blu-ray reissue worth buying, well for the new extras it's worth buying but the so called new HD transfer is terrible
TT  & screen archives website are still selling it for $30 which i think is ripoff price considering the picture quality is terrible
so it's still available to buy from Twilight time or screen archives website that's for sure
about 2-3stars for this new blu-ray reissue based on new extras but terrible picture & sound quality",1470009600,,3326,4.764298093587522
7964611,5,B000068TPF,"Great Vincent Price movies.  Just beware that Scream & Scream Again really does not have Peter Cushing or Christopher Lee in it all all, maybe 5 minutes.  Both are great B movie horror films that Price shines in.  I really like Vincent Price and these movies are a must for my collection.  Picture and sound quality are good enough for me.",1465689600,,339,4.508196721311475
