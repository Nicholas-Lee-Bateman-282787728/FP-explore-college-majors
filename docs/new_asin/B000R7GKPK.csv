2863662,1,B000R7GKPK,"Had Warner Home Video decided to cap off the entire series with all remaining MGM cartoons this would have gotten 4 or 5 stars. I bought this set today because I am a big fan of Tom & Jerry, but also with the knowledge that I am utimately buying the last of what will become a incomplete set.  Many collectors have long since branded the collection as poison due to the edits made by WB by removing ""racial"" gags and redubbing ""Mammy Two Shoes"" (Tom's owner), or removing her voice altogether. WB tried to appease this be issuing replacement discs with the scenes and audio restored. Another problem relating to the cartoons is that no effort had been made to restore them, unlike the Lonney Tunes and Popeye cartoons, also released by Warner. Some of the cartoons on this set are extremely grainy and some are likely third generation TV prints.

However this is an entirely defferent beast we have here. Here, WB decided to remove two of the cartoons entirely. These cartoons could have easily been edited, since they are both broadcast on television. I'll detail both scenes to show potential buyers what caused WB to pull these two full cartoons.

The one scene in Mouse Cleaning has Tom engulfed in an avalanche of coal (along with mammy) and mistaken (by Mammy) for an black man once his head pops up from the pile of coal.
Manny: ""When I get a hold of that lowdown, no good-for-nothin...""
*Tom emerges from the coal with a kind of blackface look*
Mammy: ""Hey You! Have you seen a no-good cat around here??""
Tom: ""No Ma'am. I an't seen no cat around here""
*Tom emerges from coal, unknowingly revealing his ""disguise""*
Tom: ""Nu-uh. There ain't no cat, no place, no how, no-o-o Ma'am!""
Mammy: ""Thomas! Get back here!""
Mammy then proceeds to throw coal at Tom.

Casanova Cat's one scene has Tom blowing cigar smoke in Jerry's face, giving him the appearance of a vaudeville blackface performer. Tom then places Jerry onto an ashtray, puts a flame under it, and a now hotfooted Jerry (still in blackface) starts to do a vaudeville tapdance for a few seconds before being tossed into a waste bin.

There is edit which crops out the island native behind Jerry in ""His Mouse Friday"", but I doubt many people will care, since we're still getting the full cartoon (sans edit).

Both of these scenes last about ten seconds out of a seven or eight minute cartoon. Sure some of these scenes may offend someone, then again, sure could some of the violence. Other cartoons that WB have licensed, such as Droopy, Popeye, and Looney Tunes are completely uncut while still having scenes similar or ""worse"" than these two scenes. Those sets had disclaimers claiming that ""to not show those scenes would be like predending such prejuduces never existed"". Is Warner Brothers backing out on its own philosophy, or is Tom and Jerry too much of a childern's show compared to the rest of the same era to follow the same rules? Either way, I'm insulted.

The packaging is extremely minimalistic, thinner than the Droopy set. It's about half the size of the other two sets, and looks little different that those thin DVD cases you find at the bargain bin. Disc presentation is ok. Previews on the second disc, fairly basic layout. This is also the only set not to have a single audio commentary.  Extras are definitely nothing to buy this set for.

I really hope T&J's Home Video legacy in the U.S. doesn't end on such a bad note, and that someday fans and collectors would have a set worth paying for without reservations.",1189468800,16,3502,4.6537216828478964
2863663,1,B000R7GKPK,"Here is the statement from Warner Bros as to why the two shorts are not being included on this release:

Two shorts, ""Mouse Cleaning"" and ""Casanova Cat,"" will not be included in the third and final ""Tom and Jerry Spotlight Collection"" of theatrical animated shorts from the Hanna-Barbera era at MGM.  Although this collection is intended for mature audiences and collectors (not for children), Warner Home Video made the decision to omit these two shorts because, regardless of their historical context and artistic value, the offensiveness of certain scenes containing inappropriate racial stereotypes would diminish the enjoyment of the Collection's 35 other classic cartoons for a large segment of the audience.

2863664,1,B000R7GKPK,"So, Warner Brothers Home Video has now decided to become BIG BROTHER!!!???? I know that the words I'm about to type are now considered pass by the new studio owners but here goes. ARTISTIC INTEGRITY. Leave these cartoons alone and allow us to judge them in their Historical Perspective. We are not idiots! We don't even need Leonard Maltin to tell us it's o.k. to view these cartoons un-cut. Was Leonard un-available to tell us it's o.k. to view these as we remember them!!?? How a studio that did so well answering the requests of the fans of the Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies to leave them as they originally were, could so insult those same fans now, is utterly beyond me!

Because we might be offended?  If you're offended by this content...then DON'T BUY IT.  C'mon MGM...Stop spoon feeding us...It is a very sad state of affairs when I have to rely on Lawyers to edit the content that I as an adult see.
By deleting content that was once deemed appropriate and is now deemed scandalous for the sake of political correctness is a complete and utter slap in the face of MGM's consumers.

2863667,1,B000R7GKPK,"If the Tom and Jerry Spotlight Collections were intended especially for kids--like the low-end WHISKERS AWAY, PAWS FOR A HOLIDAY and so on--I could understand leaving cartoons out. The idea there is to present a collection aimed at the same kid audience who enjoy the new Tom and Jerry Tales cartoons on TV.
But the Spotlight Collections are specifically marked with a warning stating that they are for adult collectors. Tasteless violence and stereotyping isn't really my thing, but I nevertheless buy the set because I want to see history ""warts and all.""
One gets the impression that Warner came very close to doing this with the Spotlight Collections, and that this was the original intent. But someone chickened out at the last minute... and adult collectors have to suffer? Way to bite the (consumer) hand that feeds you, WB. When we don't buy it in large numbers, what will you do: claim, falsely, that ""so help us, we tried, but there's just no market for the material""?
Point blank: ""Casanova Cat"" and ""Mouse Cleaning,"" the two cartoons that were LEFT OUT of Spotlight Collection Vol. 3, feature sequences with blackfaced characters speaking in a Southern patois. Crude and insensitive? Yes. Worse than many other cartoons already on the Spotlight sets? No. The whole point of the Spotlight sets, as I understood it, was that they were aimed high so the whole catalog could be represented.
Kids, after all, can watch age-appropriate, censored versions of ""Casanova Cat"" and ""Mouse Cleaning"" on TV, where we older fans don't unreasonably demand that uncut versions be shown. That's what TV is for: all ages. DVD is for US.",1188345600,16,1630,4.930909090909091
2863668,3,B000R7GKPK,"I am so bloody sick of political correctness.  How ironic that this Tom & Jerry set would have a featurette called ""60 Years of Cat and Mouse: The Tale of Tom and Jerry - The History of One of Animation's Greatest Teams, Hanna-Barbera - from Early Days to Censorship Controversies to Award-Winning Glory"" and then omit ""Mouse Cleaning"" and ""Casanova Cat"".  If you find something offensive-don't watch it-but quit depriving others who want to see it.

I read these possible listings from classic cartoon site. Total thirty five classics but missing MOUSE CLEANING, CASANOVA CAT. I don't understand why these two classics are missing. Especially MOUSE CLEANING is one of the best Tom and Jerry's ever. I think MGM cartoons needs real respect. Tom and Jerry certainly deserves compleat box set treatment.

And, how about TEX AVERY box set, Tex Avery is without a doubt one of the greatest cartoon directors of all time. His MGM classics are pure cartoon masterpieces - BAD LUCK BLACKIE, RED HOT RIDING HOOD and so much more - they deserving compleat box set treatment. Next year is Tex Avery's 100th year birth anniversary so it's perfect timing for Avery box set. I believe many classic cartoon fans love Avery's works, Tom and Jerry and MGM cartoon classics. They deserving more respect. Thanks for reading.",1186704000,17,1792,4.64873417721519
2863670,3,B000R7GKPK,"The first two Volumes of Tom and Jerry Spotlight were fantastic -- that is, AFTER Warner sent out the free replacement discs to correct the edited cartoons in the sets that initially hit the shelves.

However, a question looms over this third and final volume of the Hanna and Barbera Tom and Jerry cartoons:  The cover art for the back of the box advertises 35 shorts in this collection -- but there are in fact 37 HB shorts that Warner still hasn't given us after the first two volumes.

Is this just a misprint on the box?  Or are we really being shorted two cartoons?

If so, which two?  Maybe the controversial ""Mouse Cleaning"" and ""His Mouse Friday""?

It's all just speculation until Warner releases further details on the contents of Volume Three.  And until these questions are answered, a provisional 3-star rating for this volume, for now.

It's hard to believe Warner could really allow another screw-up, after mistakes on the first two volumes forced them to give away replacement discs to make things right.  But if they think that the outraged collectors who inundated them with complaints about edited 'toons in the first two volumes are now simply going to shrug at being left two cartoons short in the final volume and then quietly go about their way ... then I guess Warner deserves what they will undoubtedly get.

Let's hope it's just a misprint on the box -- or else, if they really did leave out two cartoons, that they'll think better of it and add them into the set before this volume hits the shelves.

Again, Tom and Jerry Spotlight Volumes One and Two are wonderful, once you've got the replacement discs.  Just don't pooch us on the last volume, Warner.

8/10/07 EDIT:  Specs have now leaked out (thanks to J. Hudak for the update on that!), and, sadly, the news is not good:  Warner has indeed apparently omitted two cartoons, ""Mouse Cleaning"" and ""Casanova Cat.""  So no more stars from me for this release, at least as long as these omissions stand.  Honestly, I now don't know whether I'll purchase this volume or not.

(Sometimes) Compared to their earlier shorts, these are clearer, crispier, and the watercolored backgrounds are much better. The music and sound effects are top notch,  and the trouble they get in is a bit varied. Now for the negatives. It seems like this volume is full of racism, with Native Indians and African Americans being made fun of blatantly. How many times will the head in a teapot be funny???

2863687,5,B000R7GKPK,"Buy this if you love the classic Tom & Jerry.

I've purchased all 3 volumes of the Tom and Jerry Spotlight Collection as well as the Chuck Jones DVD.  That covers all of the episodes other than the Gene Deitch episodes and supposedly 2 or 3 others that are so racially charged that they have been censured from existence.

All are labeled as being for adults because some of the episodes contain smoking, drinking, and racism.  I contend that they were hilarious when I was a kid and still are.  Given that I didn't turn out to be a chain-smoking, alcoholic, member of the KKK, I can only assume that watching these episodes does not have that effect on children.  If you believe otherwise, please stick to the modern broadcasts or look elsewhere for entertainment.

At the time when we got these episodes my daughter was 4 or 5 years old and got very upset when anything bad happened to anyone in a cartoon.  Tom and Jerry was the perfect thing because they continually do mean things to each other and keep coming back for more.  There was no long term impact.  It could just be a funny cartoon.  In short, she quickly grew to love them and we've watched all of the episodes multiple times.  I think it helped me give her a grasp on what was real vs what was pretend and silly.  Your mileage may vary.  ...after all, your child could grow up to be a chain smoking alcoholic member of the KKK if exposed to this filth.",1423267200,2,1419,4.3869731800766285

2863698,4,B000R7GKPK,"This third volume of Tom and Jerry shorts had some very bad press because it had some edited cartoons and omitted two cartoons entirely. MGM has not issued a free replacement for this set and has left a sour taste in many fans mouths. Instead of focusing on the two shorts that aren't here, I am a little baffled as Hanna Barbera produced 114 shorts and if you add up the three volumes of DVD's you come to 113(40 V.1, 38 V.2 and 35 V.35) The two missing shorts are Mouse Cleaning and Casanova Cat. I just don't understand why the numbers don't add up?

Now about the volume 3 set, all 35 cartoons are unedited( not exactly as a fellow reviewer pointed out there is some minor cropping done in one scene to block out a certain character), one decent bonus and a newer T&J short fill out the two disc set The cartoons look very colorful and clear, but there are scratches present, so a full restoration wasn't done. It really doesn't matter all that much as the cartoons look very good! It's just a little disheartening that MGM didn't feel these classic shorts were worth the extra trouble. Although the Cinemascope shorts included on this set look fantastic! I found that the audio was inconsistent from short to short, but none of them sounded muffled, just that some shorts were louder than others.

The Whoopi Goldberg warnings are gone(thank you!), but if the warning would have allowed Warner to include the two missing shorts, I would have rather had the warning included!

The Tom and Jerry cartoons on this set are very good, but I didn't like them as much as on the first or second volume. It is obvious that the animation and music are top notch and I still consider these shorts classic, but I must admit seeing so many cat and mouse cartoons in a short period was a little tough as the theme is almost always the same.

The extras are a little thin on this set and probably used up what material was available on the first two sets. I bought this set new for a little over $8.00 and it is one of the best bargains I've seen in a long time. I'm glad I waited until they corrected the errors and also reduced the price. For what you get here, it is a hard set to beat for fans of the famous duo!

Now release the Gene Deitch series of Tom & Jerry cartoons to complete the series( anyone remember Dickey Moe?). Deitch's take of the two characters was a little trippy to say the least.

They are always at each others throats;I suppose,as a cat and mouse should be. However,one thing that I don't particularly care for in a few of these cartoons,is when some of the characters fall in love with female animals;whether it is the cat,the mouse,or the duck or canary;I just think that this detracts some-what from the overall tone of the show. I don't really think that this sort of thing is very appropriate for this particular type of show,and I personally Don't Like it. One other thing that I kind of don't like is how badly the dogs sometimes beat up Tom.

2863724,4,B000R7GKPK,"This third volume of Tom and Jerry shorts had some very bad press because it had some edited cartoons and omitted two cartoons entirely. MGM  has not issued a free replacement for this set and has left a sour taste in many fans mouths. Instead of focusing on the two shorts that aren't here, I am a little baffled as Hanna Barbera produced 114 shorts and if you add up the three volumes of DVD's you come to 113(40 V.1, 38 V.2 and 35 V.35) The two missing shorts are Mouse Cleaning and Casanova Cat. I just don't understand why the numbers don't add up?

Now about the volume 3 set, all 35 cartoons are unedited, one decent bonus and a newer T&J short  fill out the two disc set The cartoons look very colorful and clear, but there are scratches present, so a full restoration wasn't done. It really doesn't matter all that much as the cartoons look very good! It's just a little disheartening that MGM didn't feel these classic shorts were worth the extra trouble. Although the Cinemascope shorts included on this set look fantastic! I found that the audio was inconsistent from short to short, but none of them sounded muffled, just that some shorts were louder than others.

The Whoopi Goldberg warnings are gone(thank you!), but if the warning would have allowed Warner to include the two missing shorts, I would have rather had the warning included!

The Tom and Jerry cartoons on this set are very good, but I didn't like them as much as on the first  or second volume. It is obvious that the animation and music are top notch and I still consider these shorts classic, but I must admit seeing so many cat and mouse cartoons in a short period was a little tough as the theme is almost always the same.

The extras are a little thin on this set and probably used up what material was available on the first two sets. I bought this set new for a little over $8.00 and it is one of the best bargains I've seen in a long time. I'm glad I waited until they corrected the errors and also reduced the price. For what you get here, it is a hard set to beat for fans of the famous duo!

Now release the Gene Deitch series of Tom & Jerry cartoons to complete the series( anyone remember Dickey Moe?). Deitch's take of the two characters was a little trippy to say the least. While the production values were drastically different in these cheaply made shorts, they are an important part of the evolution of Tom & Jerry.",1304985600,5,2415,4.387024608501118

This is an asinine move on WB's part. Is it me or does WB find some way to screw up every single property they own? If they wanna be all PC and not show certain episodes on TV, then fine. But these collections are for COLLECTORS, and what is a collector? Someone who collects something. Fans of Tom and Jerry want to collect all the episodes, and when Warner Bros. chooses to deny them that right, I don't see how that's fair. When that happens, something that more than likely isn't even offensive is kept from the fans because WB makes that call FOR them. Do we need WB to decide what we should be allowed to see? Guess what WB. Here's what you should do. Put the cartoons out, slap a disclaimer on the set, and be done with it. If someone doesn't like it, they can either NOT watch it, or they can shut up and let the rest of us enjoy watching the cartoons we wanna see. WB should stop treating us like children and grow a pair. These cartoons were meant to make people laugh. Why does WB insist on being so uptight about them and turning them into something much more serious? They took Speedy Gonzales off the air to be more PC, and you know what happened? They received feedback from people that wanted him back on TV. WB: Learn what the fans want instead of being totally inept in everything you do.

From what i have seen most if not all people interested in buying this are adults be it for nostalgic reasons or for their kids. Warner Brothers what do you think you're going to be achieving with censoring these cartoons and from what i hear even getting a celebrity (Whoopie Goldberg) to spout some politically correct bollocks. Political correctness sickens me to the bone,  we all know that it is a *cough* political tool of control (i'm not trying to sound militant there i just feel it's true).

All we want are the original cartoons. So what if people laugh at what might be considered bad-taste by the right wing types. Anyone with more than 6 brain cells knows there's no harm intended and i don't believe there ever was any harm intended in the first place. Stop telling us what to think, we can make out own minds up. And don't give us any of that 'protecting our children' psychobabble all you are doing is covering your own arses because everyone is so paranoid these days.

2863736,2,B000R7GKPK,"In this forum, I gave the first two Tom & Jerry Spotlight Collections five stars each because I was ecstatic to have the classic shorts in a handy form for on-demand viewing. Many reviewers were slamming the occasional minor edits, but I tried to see the forest for the trees. I'm an enthusiastic fan but not really a passionate collector, so I don't get too upset about little edits by the current DVD producers, regardless of the wisdom behind their decisions. But this time I'm siding with the critics because Time Warner has no idea what it's doing. First of all, Spotlight Collection #3 has simpler packaging and fewer bonus features than its predecessors, indicating a lack of consistency and enthusiasm from Time Warner. Most importantly, the two completely deleted episodes are a travesty, because the back of this box says that #3 ""is the final release of the William Hanna and Joseph Barbera Era Theatrical Shorts on DVD."" So Time Warner has decided that we won't get two episodes. Yes, the issue is those crude old racial stereotypes, which I (and everyone else) know are wrong. But Time Warner has handled the issue disastrously.

As a kid in the 1970s I watched the Tom & Jerry classics with my mother and grandmother, who could recall watching the originals back in the 40s and 50s. Very early on they informed me that those nasty racial caricatures were ignorant, and I never gave those stereotypes any consideration while enjoying the artistry and hilarity of the classic cartoons. Therefore it is not necessary for Whoopi Goldberg and Ted Turner to tell me what to think of them three decades later. Anyone stupid enough to convert old stereotypes into modern bigotry is not in the market demographic for these DVDs. Time Warner should know who their customers are - collectors and serious fans who desire historical completeness and who know that the racial caricatures should be disregarded. We do not need Time Warner to tell us what's right or wrong because we already know. This is especially pathetic when compared to the standard sex, violence, and bowdlerization that appear all over Time Warner's modern programming, and that stuff is even being done to people rather than animated animals.

Granted, there are still plenty of classics in this package and fans will love watching them again and again. For that reason Spotlight Collection #3 gets two stars. But Time Warner is guilty of incompetent business practices when it creates a collector-oriented product, but forgets about those enthusiastic customers while trying to appease moralists who wouldn't even think of buying the product in the first place.

It's getting to the point where everything offends someone and if you keep cowtowing to those people, everyone is going to have a problem with something and no one is going to get anything. Last night on the news, I saw one town that was so sick of dog barking, dogs are now banned in the ENTIRE TOWN! Well you know what, I don't like Intellectually Challenged people but if we banned them, Warner Brothers would have no one to employ in their Home Video Department.

There are many offensive things that have happened throughout the course of history. I wish we could erase slavery and war out of existence but I don't see that happening and many of the un-pretty parts of history we are able to see now not as a means of imitation but rather to see how our ever changing society has evolved and grown beyond the ignorance of a bygone era. Understand, not allowing people to view what's offensive does not change history or make it go away.

All it does is give other hyper sensitive people more of a reason to try and control what others should or should not be allowed to see and learn for themselves in a FREE COUNTRY.

So Warner, you can keep the cartoons in the vault all you want. Me? I'll keep my money in my wallet.",1189728000,26,2192,4.3817733990147785
2863755,1,B000R7GKPK,"Hey everyone, I just got home from buying this set, even though I knew about the 2 omitted cartoons beforehand. Disc one was pre-scratched for my enjoyment of course.
  I was shocked to see that they STILL edited 'His Mouse Friday'. The frame has been chopped to omit the big-lipped native prodding Jerry at the end.
 Also, wasn't it 'Royal Cat Nap' that had the scene at the end (admittedly disturbing) where Jerry and Nephew are walking and there is the silhouette of a guillotine in the distance cutting off Tom's head? That scene is not here. Excuse me if it is in another cartoon.
Whatever. I gave up on America years ago - so this doesn't surprise me.
Pathetic.",1189641600,17,667,4.541666666666667

I am 45 years old and I will decide for myself what I watch or don't watch.  I don't need a nanny at Warner Home Video deciding for me.  So, let us put some pressue on WHV and see if we can't keep the sales figures down for this item.",1189555200,18,568,4.044642857142857

""the cartoons you are about to see..."" warning, then there's ANOTHER warning at the beginning of the documentary, and Warners STILL manages to omit 2 cartoons!?!  Even more strange, the featurette includes clips from these 2 omitted cartoons and places them in historical perspective...
And in case you're wondering why the Looney Tunes DVDs get treated better than the MGM cartoons (and why after three volumes of Tom and Jerry they still can't get it right), it's because different divisions inside Warner Bros Home Video handle them.  Maybe they can get it together for Tom and Jerry on Blu-Ray...?  In the meantime, way to go guys!",1189555200,13,720,4.933884297520661
2863758,4,B000R7GKPK,"At first I gave this only a ** review, then I thought about it.  We are all basing our review on the two cartoons not included in this final (?) set, but the set is not called ""The Complete Collection"" it is called ""The Spotlight Collection"".

We should really be reviewing what is included on this set!  While the cartoons are not restored like the Looney Tunes & Popeye Cartoons Warner has put out, these still look good.  And they are a joy to watch.  But I have to take a star away for the one cartoon, HIS MOUSE FRIDAY, that has a shot re-framed to crop off a black faced character.  After having to replace censored discs on the first two sets, Warner still goofs and includes a censored cartoon on this set.

But in all fairness, here is my original review of 9/12/07:

Note:  I am not saying that black stereotypes are acceptable.

Here is the inside information as to why the censoring:
""The Tom & Jerry collections (and all other Warner cartoons - including the Hanna Barbera collections) are supervised by the ""Family Department"".  The POPEYE and LOONEY TUNES dvds are supervised under another department - the classic films department - and they will be uncensored.""  So these are issued by the wrong division of Warner Home Video.

To see what all the censorship was about I pulled out my ""Art Of Tom & Jerry"" Laserdisc that Ted Turner released in the previous century .  It has all of the classic Tom & Jerry Cartoons!

First let me say that both cartoons excluded from this set have Mammy Two Shoes, but then she is included in about half of the other 1940's T&J cartoons on these DVD sets.  So she is not the issue.

The omitted cartoons:

""MOUSE CLEANING"" - First let me say that I had to view the entire cartoon until the end to find any reason Warner could have.  As Mammy-Two-Shoes arrived back home, Jerry turns a coal shoot towards the living room window.  This results in Mammy & Tom being swept out of the house in a coal slide.  A black faced Tom pops up & mammy asks if he had seen Thomas, tom realizes that he is not recognized so he shuffles off like 'Step-N-Fetch-it' declaring that he had not seen Thomas.  Mammy realizes her mistake & the stereotype impression is gone as Tom runs off.

""CASANOVA CAT"" - To impress a female cat, Tom grabs Jerry & blows cigar smoke in his face, giving Jerry a black face.  Tom then puts Jerry on a metal plate and holds a flame under it to heat it up.  Jerry then commences to tap dancing on the plate.  No dialogue, just a dance.  What is wrong with dancing?  Dancing is a talent.

The edited Cartoon:

""HIS MOUSE FRIDAY"" - This cartoon features Jerry the mouse in blackface for most of the cartoon, so any censoring seems ridiculous at this point.  But at the 6:20 mark, the picture is zoomed in to crop off a large-lipped black native who aims a spear at Jerry, all you see is the spear.  But you do hear him say ""Mmmm, babbecued mouse!""  Here is the real strange part: I checked my ""Art Of Tom & Jerry"" Laserdisc that Ted Turner released and while there is no zoom-in and you see the native, his dialog is missing on the Laserdisc!  So in order to see this cartoon truly un-censored, you have to watch the picture of the Laserdisc and listen to the sound of the DVD!  This just shows how screwed up these master elements are on the MGM cartoons.  Either the alterations are not well marked on the master cans, or nobody is paying any attention.

So that is it.  No dice throwing, no watermelon.  Mostly just black faced animals (there are black cats) & some brief dialog.  In the case of Casanova Cat I don't think any kids would even understand the stereotype of a black tap dancer.  Other studios have done worse stereotypes that i can understand excluding.  But these two cartoons seem mild, with the stereotypes just brief side-bars to the main story line.  A disclaimer with separate menu access would have been sufficient.

Remember, the censorship of Tom & Jerry Cartoons did NOT start with Ted Turner!  It started in the 1950's when MGM took out war related jokes for their theatrical re-issues, these were permanent cuts to the negatives.  Then in 1966 MGM had Chuck Jones' Animation Studios remove the black characters from the cartoons so that they could air on the CBS television network.  Fortunately these edits were done using duplicate negatives, some of which got mixed up in the previous DVD releases.  Then Ted Turner's cable networks got involved & did some further trims, but he was the third censor.  We will probably never see the true uncut versions as the wartime jokes were permanently censored from the master negatives in the 1950's.  Some reference prints exist showing the original gags, maybe someday these will be restored and incorporated back into the existing negatives.",1189555200,51,4773,4.53810082063306
2863759,1,B000R7GKPK,"What sorry times we live in. The idea that anyone, especially a mature collector, will take offence at something that was made in a very different culture, 60 years ago, and which was never intended to be malicious in the first place, is offensive - but not as offensive as misrepresenting that culture. We have a lot to learn from the attitudes that were prevalent in those days, not least that we shouldn't be so damned sensitive-! If we have to walk on eggshells all the time, everyone's fun is spoilt. 'Mouse Cleaning' is one of the three or four best Tom and Jerry cartoons, and one of the dozen or so best cartoons ever. Leaving it out of an alleged ""collector's edition"" is farcical. I could be wrong, of course, but I suspect that Warners are perfectly aware of this and what they are really thinking is that opportunists will appear in their droves with lawsuits, claiming that they or their children have been offended or traumatised to the tune of, oh, half million dollars each, thank you very much. It's not just censorship that's the problem here, it's the litigation culture - or the fear of it.",1189468800,25,1110,4.582914572864322
