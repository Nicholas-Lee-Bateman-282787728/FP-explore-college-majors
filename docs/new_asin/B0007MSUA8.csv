8049033,5,B0007MSUA8,"This is one of the best i have seen. Each Volume is worth Buying. I watched it on G4tv, so i have seen the whole series. When i first started watching it i had no idea what it was. but i thought it was pretty good. Then i noticed some characters i had seen somewhere else. So i didn't realize it was Read Or Die until a few episodes into the series. I had seen the OVA on cartoon network and it was great. But (nobody get mad at me) I liked the series better. It has a good storyline, a little complicated but still great. The only problem about this series is the dvd's are expensive. I know almost every anime dvd is $30 but i cant afford that. So i have to buy them one every other month.",1134086400,,691,3.942857142857143
8049034,4,B0007MSUA8,a good wrap up .... i still wanted more. but that is as it should be.,1127174400,,69,3.375
