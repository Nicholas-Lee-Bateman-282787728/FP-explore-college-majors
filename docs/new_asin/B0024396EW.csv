3842988,4,B0024396EW,"I have followed Tom Selleck's career since he appeared on an aftershave commercial on TV many years ago.  The commercial contained a distinctive theme song and, whenever it came on, my son would yell, ""Up against the wall, everyone.  That guy's coming on TV!"" This, as I came trotting into the living room.  In those years, Tom did not have a mustache and he was not nearly as good an actor as he is now but I prophesied really good things for him.  As we aged together, he became better looking (if that was possible) and his acting talents improved commensurately.

Tom appears to be as man who stands firmly by his beliefs and selects the movies he makes accordingly; thus, very carefully.  The Jesse Stone series is a good example of this.  Although Jesse is a flawed man, he does not vary from his beliefs; he is not swayed by threats from the prissy little men on the Town Council and he is growing and developing as we watch.  I must admit that I stood up and applauded during the last movie when he hung up on his ex-wife as soon as she started to snivel about losing her new job.  Hurray for Jesse!

I will buy these movies as long as they are offered, although I do prefer the storylines developed and written by Robert Parker.  But that's just a personal preference.  Also, Molly is a vital part of this series and should never be excluded from the story.  She and Jesse play off each other too well to not have her as a full-fledged member of the cast.",1244160000,21,1464,4.357933579335794
3842989,5,B0024396EW,"My wife and kids look forward to a new installment of ""Jesse Stone"" as much as I do. The production, music, stories, and acting are way above your normal made for TV movie fare. The DVDs have been even better and I don't expect this one to let me down. I would like to see at least one a year, but the folks are right in not making it a weekly series. I'm afraid the quality would suffer....keep going like you are folks.
 Great stuff!",1243814400,7,435,4.117647058823529
3842990,5,B0024396EW,Have seen all the Jesse Stone movies. They are really great. Tom Selleck is good as ever!! Hopefully there will be another one made!!,1243209600,3,133,4.583333333333333

3842992,5,B0024396EW,"All of the JESSE STONE movies are more than worth the price of admission.  Engrossing and penetrating, true to the books that spawned them, Tom Selleck excels in this role.  He is one of the most underrated actors in the US.  Please -- more JESSE STONE movies to follow!",1241568000,22,270,4.469387755102041
3842993,4,B0024396EW,"Mr. Selleck, as usual, turns in a great performance in Thin Ice. I love the Jesse Stone series but thought this one had a little less meat to the story. Not sure what was lacking but I thought the previous episodes were a little better than this one. However, compared to most tv movies/shows, this one was still a class act. Tom Selleck and his castmates are pleasures to watch. I agree with the other reviewer, though, who said he needs to just erase the messages. Seems to me the ex-wife just likes to maintain a bit of control over poor Jesse. She doesn't want him but she doesn't want him to be able to live without her. Can't have it both ways, lady!
Looking forward to being able to buy this dvd to add to our collection of Jesse Stone movies. I hope they go on for a long long time. Oh, and that dog:  what a face!",1237680000,9,822,4.169811320754717
3842994,4,B0024396EW,"I haven't seen the film yet.  And the review that pans it for cliche's ought to hang around a police dept. for a while, there are only a few non-abrasive answers a peace officer can give to adversarial remarks or stupid questions from reporters or gawkers.

Selleck's understated manner is, in my opinion, his interpretation of how an ex-L.A. cop kicked off the force for drinking, and now in his last chance job would play it.  You do your job, don't show favoritism and adopt a manner that small town people will understand.  L.A. Police work is probably a lot different than Paradise Cove police work so insert yourself, as the actor must do into the difference he has to deal with, his problem of drinking and the impermanence of any female relationship beyond that of his symbiotic connection with his ex-wife are problems Selleck has to portray and he does so very well, again with out a lot Pacino histrionics.  My advice, Jesse just hang up the f-ing phone, and erase the messages without repeatedly listening to them.

All this Selleck and his writers and director draw us into.  My vote, do the series as long as Tom Selleck is healthy and able wants to do it, it's great and he's the one that is the heart of it.  His supporting cast couldn't be better, ""Suitcase"" is my favorite.",1237680000,14,1291,4.582608695652174
3842995,2,B0024396EW,"Love the series but this one was a little rote. ""I'm the police chief mostly I give out parking tickets"" Jesse Stone cliches abound - too much so for me. It seems like half the dialog is old rehashed Jesse Stone cliches. Things seemed to move in a choppy sort of way almost like people were just walking through their parts and I didn't feel the fire. His romance was too reminiscent of his one with Abby (Paradise City Attorney - who was murdered) again almost down to the same lines. I hope the sequel has a little more meat to it, this is too good a series to have it die out in a lackluster way. BTW I wish John Beal would release the sound track - the theme is classic.",1237075200,12,674,4.113636363636363
3842996,4,B0024396EW,"Jesse and his State Homicide buddy Healey are shot at in Boston.  Both are injured, Healey seriously.  Jesse comes home to learn his ex-wife is moving in with her boyfriend; his employer, the Paradise Town Council is not pleased with his performance as police chief specifically with his failure to man the speed trap just outside of town, and a woman from New Mexico thinks her long-ago kidnapped son is alive and well in Paradise.  Add an Internal Affairs investigation conducted by an angst-ridden and glamorous officer to the mix (Jesse managed to fire a couple of shots at the gunman) and this is a satisfying addition to the series.

Thin Ice describes more than the story.  This is the first of the Jesse Stone movies not based on a Robert Parker novel, there are differences in characters (I particularly missed Molly) and there's an edgier feel to it.  While there is still the wonderful repartee among the members of Paradise's tiny PD that is so characteristic of these stories, everyone seems uneasy and Jesse seems more self-destructive than in the past. Nevertheless, the intrepid Jesse manages to sidestep Internal Affairs to resolve the shooting, ferrets out the truth about the kidnapping, and as the movie ends, is on his way to Do The Right Thing.  His future in Paradise is in question as well as his personal relationships, and I'm glad I read that there is another episode yet unreleased, so maybe the big issues will be resolved.",1235865600,98,1452,4.807228915662651

3843070,5,B0024396EW,"Five PERPLEXING Stars. ""Thin Ice"" is an award-winning, enjoyable, expansive edition of the TV series about Jesse Stone (Tom Selleck), the beleaguered police chief of Paradise Massachusetts, based on the popular novels by renowned author Robert B. Parker. Best enjoyed as a part of the series where the past of some of the main characters is known to the viewer, this 2009 show can also be enjoyed as a stand-alone story, although chronologically it occurs between the shows ""Sea Change"" and ""No Remorse"".  In this deliberately-paced, well-acted cop drama, the painstaking, less glamorous but interesting side of police work is exposed with many characters skating on 'thin ice' as Chief Stone is involved in a shooting and a disappearance that are separated by years of time. Obviously there is more to follow in the next edition of the series that ends here on a minor, poignant cliff hanger. Co-starring an excellent cast of Kathy Baker, Kohn Studduth, Stephen McHattie, William Sadler, Leslie Hope, Kerri Smith, Fulvio Cecere, Jessica Hecht, Joanna Miles, with Camryn Manheim and William Devane. Directed by Robert Harmon, ""Thin Ice"" is co-written and co-produced by Selleck. Highly Recommended. Five EXPANSIVE Stars. (Sony Pictures Television, Inc. and Brandman Productions, Inc.

3843138,5,B0024396EW,"All the Jesse Stone cop/mystery videos I've watched to date, 6 of them, have been great. I wasn't really a cop/mystery fan, vids or books, until I watched Tom Selleck and William Devane in this collection. I accidentally found them in my local public library and picked one to fill out my allotted four vid check outs and became an instant convert. Selleck is a fine actor, perfect in his deadpan, serious cop business, glib humor, functioning alcoholic role as Jesse Stone. (Jonny Walker Red Label scotch sales must have gone up as a consequence.) Selleck also directs some of the films. William Devane is also great as a former cop, now retired and a psychiatrist trying to quit smoking - all his life, apparently. He is trying, unsuccessfully, to help Jesse cope with his divorce, the death of his girlfriend and dog - ""Why is this so hard?"". I won't forget Reggie and Steve (Joe, the red Airedale) as his conscience. Robert Parker created the character of Stone in a sub-series of his many books, one of which I am now reading. The vids are generally composites of Parker's Stone stories and there is some redundancy in dialog and storyline, but it isn't really annoying or boring, I only regret I discovered Parker six years after his death in 2010.",1464998400,,1254,4.678733031674208

3843168,3,B0024396EW,"Thin Ice is the sixth Jesse Stone mystery I have reviewed on Amazon.  I am now watching them in order and am able to comment on the development of this series and character.

Thin Ice is the weakest film in this series that I have viewed.  We start with a shooting.  Jesse is sitting in a car with Captain Healy his friend in the Boston Police Department.  Its a stakeout, but we don't know exactly why the two men are there and then a villain appears and shoots Captain Healy and Jesse.  Captain Healy is almost killed, but survives.  Jesse has a flesh wound that allows him to be patched up and leave the hospital.  This is the major mystery in the film; who shot Healy and Jesse?  Sadly, unlike all the previous mysteries, Jesse shows little skill in identifying his attacker.

Always there are two mysteries in each program and the second mystery involves a kidnapped baby.  This is a cold case.  The mother of the kidnapped child receives a note telling her that her child is loved and cared for.  The mother appeals to Jesse for help and at first he refuses because so little evidence is available to make it possible for him to find the child.  Instead, he passes the case off to Kathy Baker, Rose Gammon in the films, who is the telephone dispatcher in the small police station.  Rose does a good job following up on the few clues available and finally Jesse decides to help her.

Unlike other films in the series, Thin Ice seems muddled, confused, and moves at a snails pace.  Jesse seems bored with his work.  The one point of interest in the film is his conflict with the select board, who are not happy with the performance of their chief of police.  This will have serious consequences later in the program, as we discover.

Even though Thin Ice is not as fully satisfying as the rest of the series I have seen, I will watch the next installment, No Remorse, and will report later to readers of this review and let them know if this series gets back on track.",1460505600,,1972,4.409972299168975

3843220,3,B0024396EW,"The movie was o.k. I guess. It was boring to me. I fell to sleep during the first 30 minutes of it. Tom Selleck plays a cop.,,,,Who investigates a murder of a little boy. When at first he is stolen. Then he gets drowned on a ice skating ring...While his real Mother still continues to look for him after 7 years...The police finally figures out what happaned...To me it was boring....It took me a long time to get it. I like his westerns a lot better.....",1452643200,,455,4.3023255813953485

3843331,5,B0024396EW,This is movie 5 of the series. I love Jessie Stone played by Tom Selleck. He played a realistic role of a troubled alcoholic trying to keep his job a float while dealing with abandonment issues.  After Stone and Healy are shot in a stakeout Stone is determined to find out why and by whom.  What he discovers is mind certainly worth having them killed over and he must prevent another attempt on their lives.,1413244800,,408,4.426666666666667
3843332,4,B0024396EW,"Thin Ice is the fifth Jesse Stone film, and the first that didn't come directly from one of Robert Parker's novels. Parker didn't write this one, but Thin Ice is still every bit as gripping and mysterious as the other Stone stories. Since becoming the police chief in Paradise, Massachusetts, Stone has injected himself into local business and politics, discovering a lot of corruption, and a connection to organized crime. He's done a tremendous job, but the town council is very upset with him. All these arrests and headlines have put Paradise on the front page, and it has taken it's toll on the towns main source of income, tourism. The town council tells Stone he has to tone it down or risk losing his job. In typical fashion he response by telling them, ""you can fire me, but you can't tell me what to do."" An upset Stone, heads to Boston to have dinner with his friend, the state homicide commander, when a mysterious shooter tries to take them both out. Now Stone is in the middle of another headline grabbing investigation that's become personal. As always Tom Selleck is terrific and pairing him Picket Fences' Kathy Baker has only made the film series that much more enjoyable for me. Every film has two mysteries that feature Stone right in the middle of the action. Thin Ice being written by a different person, shows Stone as edgier and more sarcastic, something that was interesting to see. I've read most of the novels and know the character of Jesse Stone very well, and to see him exhibit different personality traits, in an extreme situation, really was a treat for me. If you're not familiar with Jesse Stone, you should take the time to do so. He is one of the most complex characters I have ever come across and he's played by the absolute perfect choice, Tom Selleck. The man has been playing a cop for nearly 40 years and has learned a thing or two about what it takes to lead audiences through an investigation. Thin Ice was definitely a change in direction, but it works, as even in it's fifth installment, Jesse Stone is still every bit as good as it ever was.",1413158400,,2089,4.573333333333333

3843369,5,B0024396EW,I need to watch movies now and then that just tell a story and let me care about the people in it. This Tom Selleck flick doesn't disappoint but then I am a fan of his. I never saw any of these on tv so it was all new to me. Now that I have time on my hands shows like this suit me fine. Enjoy and watch the rest in the Prime instant videos they are just as good.,1403481600,,363,3.55
3843370,5,B0024396EW,"Recently, in preparing to travel to my home, which is located in a small suburban town in the Bay Area, I was relaxing in the tub and contemplating my trip and its purpose.  When suddenly, I overheard a familiar, soft, and distinct angelic sound.  After I approached my bedroom, I immediately realized the sound was actually the theme music from the movie Thin Ice.  For some reasons, my boyfriend decided to start the noted movie, which respectively features Tom Selleck, Kathy Bates, and Kohl Sudduth.

Conversely, I never really cared for a few of Tom Sellecks previous projects such as Magnum, P.I.  Moreover, while I have admittedly viewed only a few episodes of his T.V Series Blue Bloods., I would not be considered a huge fan.  However, I contend that Selleck discovered the right vehicle when he accepted the role in playing Jesse Stone, Chief of Police, in a small New England town called Paradise.

In Thin Ice, it becomes readily apparent that bedsides battling alcoholism, the acceptance of a failed marriage, as well as maintaining an annoying insecurity (i.e. he religiously corrects everyone if they refer to him as anything but Jesse), Stones law enforcement career is on its last leg.  More importantly, all of Stones eggs are in Paradises basket.  Clearly, he has to make his present situation work.

Besides the main plot and subplot of Thin Ice, the noted movie reminds me of folks who understands the importance of choosing their own lifes pace.  Overall, the conversations are dependably pleasant and besides the City Council maintaining a few of political agendas, folks still recognizes and practices the importance of being thoughtful, considerate and gracious (even when a hideous crime has occurred - a woman decidedly kidnapped an infant).

For wellness sake, it is important to remember that towns like Paradise still exist in this mixed up and confused world, and maybe folks should venture out to seek and experience such a town (once in a while).  Lastly, while the town referred to as Paradise and its citizens are not perfect, the premise and its foundation are true.",1403395200,,2102,4.9714285714285715
3843371,3,B0024396EW,"Entertaining Tom Selleck movie, lots of two fisted action followed by slow boring scenes, Stone is an unbelievable character however.",1403222400,,133,5.7

Tom Selleck plays the part of a small town Maine sheriff just right; he doesn't run around killing people all the time but he does solve crime, especially when it concerns his friends in the Boston Police Department.  He also is exquisitely human, he is in counseling with a psychologist who was previously a cop.  Jesse's wife (you only always hear her, never see her) left him but calls him because she still cares about him.  You assume she left him because of his problems with alcohol and with his previous employment with the Los Angeles Police Department.  Jesse also has a dog -- who plays his part extremely well (his eyes are always making statements) -- and talks to him in the evening when he is alone with his thoughts.  The deputies with whom he works are also excellent actors and really add to the interest of the movie.

3843490,5,B0024396EW,"The film creates a mood that reflects the alternately gray/tortured frame of mind of the main character, beautifully played by Tom Selleck, who also produced. Jeff Beal's musical score is compelling and evocative. (The only flaws are the uninteresting and unneeded subplots involving Stone's relationships with women, most of whom are too young for the main character).

It's not really necessary to watch them in chronological order, but according to WIkipedia, it's:

Stone Cold (February 20, 2005)
Jesse Stone: Night Passage (January 15, 2006) a prequel to Stone Cold

I have read most of Robert Parker's novels and am a big fan of the brooding, honorable, and introspective character he created in Jesse Stone.  Jesse would feel right at home in ""High Noon,"" except that in Paradise, his loyal staff will not forsake him.  The setting and the beautiful, achingly melancholy music are characters in and of themselves (How often do you hear Brahms prescribed as a remedy for loneliness or the haunting theme music created by Jeff Beal?).  However, without Tom Selleck, there would be no center to the film.  Both as actor and executive producer, Mr. Selleck sees the value of Parker's tight dialogue and tongue-in-cheek humor, and has honored the source material not only in form but in spirit.  The story is about character, or lack thereof, and how the human heart can surprise even a seasoned police chief like Jesse.  This is a beautiful, exquisitely crafted series, and Thin Ice, one of the best.  Tom Selleck is at the top of his form and deserves high praise for his work.  He is one of the best actors alive today and brings not only an attractive physical presence, but his gravitas and moral fiber are perfection.

Tom Seleck maintains the same Magnum PI style with Jesse Stone by keeping the good & bad aspects of the characters life true to form.  It uses a multi-layered story line playing out between all his personal, in and out of town dramas. It breaks from the more traditional hero type detective drama's and plays out more true to real life by including the personal story line.  This approach allows viewers to connect and related better with the characters and draws us all into the story deeper.

Magnum PI was when I first saw Tom Selleck. Anyway. He is a brilliant actor. He takes his script very seriously. In Thin Ice he helps out a fellow cop while visiting him in Boston.

3843581,5,B0024396EW,"I was never a fan of Tom Selleck. I thought his character in Magnum P.I. was well done, meaning he was very believable - a natural really in the part. But I just didn't connect with the show very much. Haven't seen one movie since the Magnum series that he may have starred or had a part in, so this Jesse Stone series has been the first thing I've seen since that time. I've watched 4 of the 8 or 9 movies and thought that each one was fantastically done for the following reasons. Once again Selleck draws you in to the character because of his natural poise in character as an experienced and hard-nosed former LA cop. His acting is at the top of the spectrum in these flicks. There isn't a facial expression or line that is superfluous in any of these movies, you know, those lines or comments that you just get the feeling are thrown in there b/c cause the writers had to fill in a gap. The score for the series is hauntingly elegant and creates an ambiance of mystery as well as suspense...reminded me a bit of the score that the BBC producers/musicians came up with for the Dickens Bleak House movies. The supporting actors all do a phenomenal job here and create a great foil for the tough no-nonsense character that is Jesse Stone. If you are looking for bang bang shoot em' up, you'll be disappointed. There are a number of scenes in the movies I've watched where guns are blazing, for sure, but no gratuitous shooting and killing crap here, just where it really counts. All total the 4 Jesse Stone movies were well worth the time to sit and watch. I did get hooked on them and now have to go and buy the whole set to get the remaining 4 or 5 movies I haven't seen.

So much so, in fact, that, while he is younger than the Stone of Parker's books, you could never imagine anyone else being Jesse Stone. The film is a mix of stories, each one moving at it's own pace. This film gives Selleck's co-stars more screen time and more substantial action, but in the end you watch these films for one reason - Selleck is just so darned good as Jesse Stone.

What a great place paradise must be with a police force that doesn't always do the legal thing, but they always to the right thing.  This would actually make a great TV series, but it would take some seriously talented writers!

3843602,5,B0024396EW,The Jesse Stone series is well written and well portrayed. As someone from Massachusetts it is like watching the folks in the town down the road.  Stone is the Police Chief we would all like to have in our town.,1391472000,,211,4.275

At the end of a rocky career, with a small drinking problem, he needs this job as police chief in a small one horse town to work. And he is a good enough cop to know that he has to do what must be done, even if it costs him his job.

These movies are not action packed, and not full of CG explosions. It relies on dialog and character. Some may find it a bit slow, and not having read the books I sense there is a lot that is alluded to not clearly explained in the film adaptation.

He fits it perfectly somehow and I find the pace and details of the stories very interesting in a laid-back, human sort of way. Suspenseful, but not too much so, funny but not just comedic, and somehow very credible, even moving. I was not expecting that of Selleck, who makes these Jesse Stone stories what they are -- for me some of the most enjoyable and rewarding 90 minutes or so in movie mysteries.

Selleck is just an amazing actor in everything he does. I liked him in movies based on Louis L'Amour's books, so I thought I'd give this a try, and wasn't disappointed. It's sad that one jerk on the town's council can mess with a great man, but that's what small towns are. I'll never live in one again, if I can help it. In this film, Selleck's character, a small town police chief, solves two major crimes at the same time, and makes it look as easy as breathing. It has a sad ending, but it's still a great film. I'd like to add this series to my collection.",1384560000,,699,4.147058823529412

3843711,5,B0024396EW,Tom Selleck is totally convincing in his role as Jessie Stone.  He pulls you into his character and makes him come alive.  Jessie is not good at playing politics and has a sense of right and wrong.  He has a good understanding of human nature.,1383696000,,243,4.355555555555555
3843712,5,B0024396EW,I have never seen a bad Jesse Stone movie since the time they began to come out. I hated Tom Selleck's acting in everything he ever did as an actor except this Jesse Stone movies. He makes the show what it is. The movie fits him like a glove and he is great in the show. I am so glad for Tom Selleck in this movie and the story line and action is so real and as if made to order. Also when Tom Selleck has played in movies of Westerns or early days of history other than the modern area we live in his acting has been great. His acting in Westerns and his acting in the Jesse Stone series in my book is better than most the works John Wayne did in John Waynes career or at least right up there with the Duke.,1383350400,,708,3.856164383561644
3843713,5,B0024396EW,this is a bias rating since I really enjoy watching  Tom Selleck projects. He does a great job delivering the story.,1383264000,,116,4.523809523809524

3843715,4,B0024396EW,Another great movie staring Tom Selleck.  Nearly all of his movies are outstanding.  Again the only time I watch movies on Amazon Prime is when Netflix is down.  Lack of subtitles makes Amazon Prime a poor choice.  Go to Netflix every thing has subtitles for someone like me that doesn't hear well.,1382832000,,298,4.673076923076923
3843716,5,B0024396EW,"I really enjoy the Jesse Stone series. The dialogue is clever, the characters engaging, and the story is always intriguing. Tom Selleck is always the stoic, yet thoughtful detective who probably drinks because he feels he has never done enough. It's not enough to solve the crime as he would much rather have prevented it. The city of Paradise is a facade. Its council members prefer to put their heads in the sand and maintain an image of ""paradise"". They seem to regularly thwart the efforts of Jesse.

In this story a woman from Arizona comes to him convinced that her missing son from many years ago is not only alive, but living in Paradise. Jesse refuses to help, but he cannot help but get involved. He does solve the mystery in the end, but it is not as anyone would expect. This is just part of the story, which begins with Jesse being shot while on stakeout with his friend from Boston.

You will love this story and want to see more.",1382054400,,944,4.4508670520231215
3843717,4,B0024396EW,"Each actor did his/her part superbly. The writing was great--representation of a small town America,however dramatized, its people, the typical American humor and gritty zest of words. Unlike conventional Hollywood productions, this movie has a depth that one expects from a Broadway production. In other words, despite dramatization, the movie was not cheesy at all. The actors deserve the full credit, each one of them. The main character Tom S was simply outstanding. I may watch few more of this series. I recommend you watch at least one of these shows. You will like it. They are not so called art films and nothing high-brow about them. But if you enjoy non-pretentious storytelling, you will enjoy it.",1382054400,,709,5.068376068376068

Tom Selleck does a wonderful job as a hard nosed tough as nails police chief in the small town of Paradise, Mass., although the movies are filmed in Halifax, Nova Scotia.  Also, the book calls for Tom Selleck's part as Jesse Stone to be played by a much younger man, but it doesn't matter since Tom does a great job in the role.  I recommend that all of you see the series of 8 movies.  They are great.  I wish that Tom would make more.  He is a true A Lister.",1382054400,,482,4.021052631578947

3843730,5,B0024396EW,"This movie was well written and acted. Selleck is superb in his portrayal of a small town police chief who uses every bit of his skills
as a detective. He is in the twilight of his career, has a life that is in disarray, and is at odds with the local town council. However he lets none of this distract him from bringing his formidable skills to bear on two cases that affect him personally.
This movie harkens back to an earlier time in moviemaking where acting and character development were paramount. Well worth watching.",1381536000,,525,4.536842105263158

The characters are interesting and complex and you get to learn a little more about them with each viewing or by reading the books. The movies are well done and smart and have everything from drama to ""who done it"" to humor. I can think of no one else to play the part of the brooding character, Jesse Stone, other than Tom Selleck. He does it masterfully. Not a huge time investment as far as movies go.

3843735,4,B0024396EW,"I started watching these as a way to alleviate boredom one night on Netflix and while there isn't much flash and flare, in all I found that I truly enjoyed these movies as well as this one in particular.
Jesse Stone is a man of few words but those few tend to be gems. The dialogue, at least in my mind, is priceless and while there are some changes from the book, I suspect that you'll like the film even if you've read the series.
I suspect that if you're looking for your next big vicarious epiphany or the smoldering adrenaline rush that you might get while watching a Micheal Bay film you're going to be sorely disappointed.
If you're looking for a movie with solid acting, clever conversations and a hero to cheer for you'll probably be fairly content with this show. If you haven't yet seen the other films I'd recommend starting with them first, and start at Jesse Stone: Night Passage  rather than Stone Cold.
I suspect if you enjoy shows like, Murder She Wrote, Longmire, or ever wanted to see Sherlock Holmes without all the dialogue.",1381017600,2,1045,4.5

Taken from the books of Robert B Parker, who also wrote the Spenser for Hire books and was lost to his faithful audience recently, Selleck and his company make the characters come alive on the screen.

I do not think I would have liked this series very much at all.  It's very easy to put yourself in this characters shoes.  You feel his pain, you feel his anger, you feel his joys and his sadness.

This time, Stone visits Healy in the city and an assassin pumps bullets in their car. No one knows why. The council wants PD to write more tickets (same old reasons).

 All of the movies in series have a unique mood created by its enduring cast and director, especially actor Selleck, Director Harmon, and exc. producer Michael Brandman.

This 8-movie, 12-hr sequence is:

Night Passage
Stone Cold
Death in Paradise
Sea Change
Thin Ice
No Remorse
Innocents Lost
Benefit of the Doubt

in production Spr 2015: Lost in Paradise w/ Selleck
followed by a 10th Jesse Stonein writing stage
The mood-swings of Parker's Jesse Stone detective novels range from Paradise's idyllic landscape, ambiance of small fishing town villagers interacting in recent summers with  rich Boston tourists, to Stone's shoot-outs with murderers & mob assasins. Selleck's Jesse Stone is a truly heroic character with lots of neuroses and baggage. He's drunk mostly after work but still manages to 'catch' / kill serial killers, mob assasins, etc. In THIN ICE, Stone traps a mob pimp / assassin while other staff investigate a baby-napping.  I would describe the Jesse Stone series' mood  as 'melancholy but inspiring'. Its middle-aged main characters are all 'just coping with life'. As good as made-for-TV gets. For  detective movies, these are more introspective and slower-paced than most but a deeper sense of characters and place is gained.",1370044800,,1341,5.2924528301886795

Much to his suprise he finds himself hired as Police Chief of a small, but corrupt North Eastern town hired by a city council thinking his relationship with Johnny Walker renders him somewhat incompitent. WRONG!
This is an entertaining series, well written in my opinion, not brilliant, but well written with in depth character development. Mr. Selleck is well suited to this role!! A refreshing departure from his youthful role as Magnum PI, this role suits both his maturity as a man and an actor.

He's torn between doing a good job, and his drinking (finally), and sees that it has been a problem.  He realizes that he does indeed love law enforcement, and must reign in his devil may care attitude, and do things by the books at times, even though he may want to take personal vengeance. In the end, he has a heart for both the victim of a crime, as well as the criminal of the same crime.  In other words, he is becoming more human, and less of a hard-drinking, wise-cracking icon of himself.  It is a welcom evolution.",1367539200,,707,4.407692307692308

Tom Selleck does an excellent job of portraying Jesse Stone in a way that perhaps John Wayne or Clint Eastwood might have done it, perhaps.

3844008,5,B0024396EW,"Outstanding film. All the Jesse Stone series are wonderfully done. Selleck is just perfect as Stone. There is no one in Hollywood that I can think of that can do any better. Generally speaking, films that are based in a minor key are often too depressing to desire sequels. However, this film is so well balanced with hopeful outcomes and justice that the viewer just craves more episodes. The character study of Chief Stone (Selleck) is so well done and compelling that the plot does not have to be intricate to be interesting. But the Stone films also tell  decent and believable stories. Selleck mentioned in an interview that his Stone films seem to mostly attract the older set, but I disagree. I think intelligent young people with an appreciation for good acting will also enjoy the films. High action is not always sacred amongst the young; save the speed freaks. I highly recommend  all the films for everyone.",1362182400,,919,4.773584905660377

3844027,5,B0024396EW,"Jesse's job is tenuous at best when he finds himself in the middle of a shoot out with State Homicide Commander Healy.  Healy takes several bullets and Jesse is shot in his upper arm.  Jesse leaves Healy at the hospital and makes an early appointment with his psychiatrist Dr. Dix (William Devane). Dr. Dix recognizes that Jesse is not using a sling for his arm and ultimately is not taking care of himself.  Back to his office he interacts with Deputy Rose Gammon (Kathy Baker) and Suitcase (Kohl Sudduth).  There he is barked at about inconsequential items.  The town council has requested Jesse's immediate appearance.  He is now in trouble because they think he was working a side job in Boston.  Additionally, they do not like Jesse's name along next to Paradise regarding the shoot out.  Councilman Carter Hansen told Jesse, ""We can fire you.""  Jesse's retorted, ""I see it as my job not to look the other way.""  Here we go - - - Jesse is on THIN ICE.  Regardless he intends to find who shot his friend Healy as well as himself.  In the mean time, Elizabeth Blue (Camryn Manheim) from Albuquerque NM ends up in Jesse's office.  She believes her son was stolen from her seven years ago and that he now lives in Paradise based on a letter she received, ""Your Child is Loved.""  Rose takes the case and she researches the evidence.  The story of Healy's attempted murder and Elizabeth Blue's child carries throughout the 90 minute show.  We are thrust into the movie by the many Jesse Stone characters such as Gino Fish (William Sadler), Dr. Perkins (John Beale) and of course Reggie (Joe) Jesse's dog.  Jesse asked for help from the Internal Affairs Officer.  Her response is, ""If you (Jesse) cross the line, I will put your away.""  Ultimately, Jesse does put the bad guy away within the arms of the law.  Rose and Jesse discover the woman who stole Elizabeth Blue's son.  The crimes have been solved but the conclusions are not completely just. Excellent Jesse Stone show !",1357171200,,1976,4.636887608069165

There's two crimes to solve in this episode: a missing child and a shooting.  Jesse uses his usual innovative, and not always regulation approved, techniques which keeps the episode interesting.  While I was wishing for a new love interest for Jesse, as the only annoying thing about this series is his ex-wife phoning and playing him with talk of her love-life, I wasn't sure that Jesse's new love interest is quite right for him.  But then it's easier to exchange her for someone new next episode which keeps the show fresh.

This is vintage Jesse Stone with an intriguing and original plot, sensational scenery, haunting music which may have been written by the pediatrician actor in the show (thought I saw that in the credits) and pitch-perfect acting.

That's how I feel about Jesse Stone, another Californian transplanted to New England. Ted Williams didn't pay much attention to fielding, but what he did pay attention to, he did very well. The ""Jesse Stone"" movies don't do everything well, but when it comes to producing character-driven, moody, exquisitely paced, hard-boiled entertainment, they do very well. The banter between the characters is something that can be savored. For example, Suit tells Jesse he has Paradise Donuts under constant surveillance because donuts certify his ""copliness"". What Jesse says about himself could apply to the dialogue generally, ""It's hard for me not to be cute.""",1327708800,,888,5.13103448275862

Selleck or Jesse as he likes to be known, has come to Paradise, Massachusetts after a tough time in California. He comes to this small town and becomes their sheriff. Paradise, as it turns out, is a place that attracts crime. This time a mother comes looking for her missing son. He was born seven years ago and taken the day of his birth. She is sure he is still alive, and someone sent her a note saying 'your son is loved'. Jesse is not keen on taking up this case but one of his staff, played by Kathy Baker, takes it on, on her own time. The town fathers are not happy with Jesse, not enough speeding tickets, so his job is on the line. He is helping a fellow cop, chief of the state's homicide bureau, when both are shot. This is another mystery to undertake. But, it seems Jesse is up to all challenges, and he meets them head on.

A lot of humor, some implied sex, danger, and the city of Boston is featured.  A good film and now I may be hooked into watching the series.  Gotta know what some of the references in past shows are all about.

They are not the mega million dollar Hollywood productions like most movies that get all the headlines and Buzz but are the favorites of me and many people I know. Tom Seleck is the modern day John Wayne of actors. Subtle yet powerful. His ability to ""Underplay"" a part is amazing. One would tend to think that all this turmoil could never happen in a small town like Paradise yet Seleck makes it believable. And keeps your attention through out the entire series.

The overall cinematography and mood of the movie including sound track makes for very easy if not compulsive viewing. No special affects, just good straight viewing from beginning to end.

As with the others in the series, this one has parallel plots. In this case, one is a mother looking for her stolen son. In the meantime, Jesse is also involved in a case out of his jurisdiction in Boston, all the while fighting the city council who want to fire him.

His take on the washed out, struggling alcoholic cop couldn't have been played better. He even looks it with his half-beard and ragged expressions.

From the angle of the old fashioned mysteries and several different plots going on at the same time, it holds your attention to the very end. I personally fall asleep very easily once I sit down, so something really has to hold my attention, and these do it. It is refreshing to still have something being created that isn't falling prey to the current rage for shallow (let's see how gross or violent we can make it ) minds that don't have attention spans anymore to stay with a plot. I also appreciate the fact that for the most part they aren't filled with language and sex just to sell the movie. They hold their own based on quality.

3844111,4,B0024396EW,"""Thin Ice,"" the most recent DVD in the series of TV movies inspired by Robert B. Parker's Jesse Stone books, offers further proof that Tom Selleck has truly made Stone his own. The film's laconic dialogue, wry humor and thoughtful exploration of this flawed lawman's journey back from the brink of lovelorn alcoholism is real and touching. Kathy Baker's Rose almost lets me forget Viola Davis as the no-longer-mentioned Molly, and Camryn Manheim's few scenes as a distraught mother could wring tears from a slab of rock. The mist-shrouded photography and moody, low-key music add just the right touches. Recommended, especially for those who've seen the first four Jesse Stone movies.",1261180800,,684,5.171171171171171

It's nice to see a ""cop"" movie that doesn't involve destructive, high speed, car/boat chases, blowing up buildings, bridges, or cities, or annihilating entire populations.

3844150,3,B0024396EW,this film differed from the previous Jesse Stone films which were based on Robert B. Parker's novels about this character.  The previous films were based on strong Parker plots that were modified for film.  This particular film was not and has suffered from the much poorer writing and a less coherent plot.

3844152,4,B0024396EW,"The Jesse Stone ""films"", which are really CBS TV two-hour special recurring dramas, have been a big surprise in many ways. The production quality has been very high, the filming locations, in Nova Scotia, standing in for Maine, very scenic and atmospheric, the way in which the pulp genre characters and B-List former stars and character actors have been used has been keenly attuned to the needs of both Robert Parker's style and Tom Selleck's long established screen persona, the scripts have been lean and well crafted, and Tom Selleck has been wonderful, perfect, perhaps, as Jesse Stone. The first two instalments, with Viola Davis, were especially good. The score is wonderful -- is there any way to get that great music on CD?

However, since the exit of actress Viola Davis as Jesse's fellow cop, police station manager and conscience, and the arrival of the very different Kathy Baker, in a similar role, the series has taken a definite turn into late middle aged ""Murder She Wrote"" torpor. The edginess that made it alluring has waned, the supporting actors have become less notable, and the recurring business about Jesse's drinking, his shrink, his dog, his indifference to being fired from his ""last chance"" job as chief of police, and the calls from his ex-wife have all become a little more rote, and lifeless.

That said, there are some wonderful pulp genre elements here, and I guess I will keep watching. But they need to take stock and amp it back up a bit. It may be aimed at an older demographic, and that may even include me. But it's getting just a little too stolid, even for aging boomers with an affection for gruff but sensible Tom Selleck in a great third act role of a lifetime.",1251936000,,1707,4.724832214765101

His method of dealing with the town councilman's son in laws job applicantion is great, pity he can't get rid of the town councillor too. Good supporting cast as usual. Kathy Baker and Kohl Suddolph are great as is Reggie the dog. Why cant Jesse just erase his ex wifes messages or tell her to get a life and get out of his.

The 5 Jesse Stone movies are just great action/cop/murder mystery movies for grownups.

3844210,5,B0024396EW,"Tom Selleck shows the human flaws brilliantly in all the Jesse Stone  films. That is one of the reason it makes a great film. He has a dark side, but he believes in doing the right thing at any cost to himself. The whole cast is great. I am waiting for the next film of this series to come out. It could even be a weekly drama; however there is something to be said for an annual movie on the Robert Parker books.

I highly recommend this film to anyone that likes Selleck and a very good television mystery/drama.",1245888000,4,514,4.181818181818182
3844211,5,B0024396EW,"In this installment of the Jesse Stone series, Tom Selleck reprises his role as the multi-faceted Police Chief of the small town of Paradise, MA. This time around, Stone is visiting his pal, State Homicide Commander Healy [Stephen McHattie] and whilst on a sort of stakeout, both are shot. Stone later investigates whilst Healy recuperates in hospital, and finds that the shooting and the stakeout are not connected. As is typical in the Jesse Stone series, there is more than one story arc. Stone returns to Paradise to find his position as Police Chief threatened by a town councilman.

My favorite in the series is Stone Cold, but the other stories are just as engaging, and what elevates this series from the average made-for-TV movie is the intelligent writing, beautiful cinematography and of course, Tom Selleck's charismatic portrayal of the tormented Police Chief. Recommended to fans of Selleck, mysteries, and police procedurals.",1245628800,,940,5.184210526315789
3844212,3,B0024396EW,"Tom Selleck's fifth installment as Robert Parker's alcoholic Police Chief, in ""Jesse Stone: Thin Ice"", lacks the ironic edginess and humor of the previous films (based, for the first time, on original material, not a Parker novel), and the presence of Viola Davis as the heart of the tiny Paradise Police Department is sorely missed, but Selleck is terrific, and the film will certainly please his fans!

As always, Stone is in hot water with the Paradise City Council; town revenue is down (as he had fired his department's biggest ticket-writer), and he refuses to hire a Council member's son-in-law to fill the vacancy; and while in Boston in a borrowed Paradise police car, Stone and his buddy, Captain Healy (Stephen McHattie), are shot, with Stone under an Internal Affairs investigation for firing back. More is on his plate, as well; a mother (Camryn Manheim) arrives in town, begging for his aid in finding her long-missing child, and his ex-wife informs him she plans to move in with her new boyfriend. Needless to say, Stone is finding solace in the bottle, and verbally sparring with his shrink (William Devane)...but he doggedly searches for answers, despite the threats and suspicion.

The series 'regulars' (Kathy Baker and Kohl Sudduth, as Stone's fellow Paradise cops, and William Sadler, as a Boston mobster) are wonderful, as is Leslie Hope, portraying an IA investigator attracted to him...and Joe the Dog (as his mutt, Reggie), shines, as always (the canine is a hell of an actor!). While the film has shortcomings, the performances are first-rate, and Selleck is so natural as Stone, you may forget he was once Thomas Magnum...while the ending may be the darkest of the series, I'm certainly looking forward to the next Stone movie!",1245369600,52,1754,5.0034246575342465
