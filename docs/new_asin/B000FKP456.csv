8124228,4,B000FKP456,"I enjoyed this movie.  A lot different than Fast and Furious, but that's good. We don't need another of the same anyway.  Yes, there are Fast Tuner cars, pretty girls but in this movie also a lot of violence so watch the kiddies on this one.  Sort of a ""B"" movie, sometimes acting is marginal and the end is somewhat confusing but great entertainment anyway and I recommend it.",1202947200,,377,4.434782608695652
8124229,1,B000FKP456,"that says if the movie in the box doesn't meet the hype on the box, you should be able to return it.  It says on the box it's in the same vein as ""Fast and Furious"".  Don't you believe it!  This movie is poorly acted, poorly filmed, and poorly conceived!  I would give it no stars if that were possible. I plan on putting this one out in the local flea market and see if I can at least get back a buck or two on it.",1156204800,,415,3.735632183908046
