I may have comparable strength to some men, but don't even dream of being as strong as many guys I know.  I'm not going to do lunges with a railroad tie on my shoulders.  I don't have a ton of equipment, nor would I want to invest my time, money and energy into all the things he uses in this DVD.  I also could not get the DVD to fast forward, which would be the first DVD that I have seen not do this.  This guy seems to really want to show off for far too much of the DVD by adding ego boosting clips of breaking things and the such, which does nothing to help me strength train.  Martial arts teaches a lot of technique over strength, which he shows neither in the drawn out vanity clips.",1120694400,3,860,3.9593023255813953
8316963,5,B00006Z58J,"This is one Power-Packed video! I've seen the instructor in this video on ESPN and he really means business. He is very dedicated to strengthening his physique to improve his martial art. If you keep up with this guy and his workout routine, I don't think you will have much trouble doing any other type of workout or straight-out fighting. It's one of the best instructional videos I've ever watched.",1091750400,2,401,4.742857142857143
