994758,5,6305240663,"THE COMPLEXITY AND ODD LOOK OF CAROL KANE MAKE THIS MOVIE WHAT IT IS. NOT ONLY WILL YOU FIND YOURSELF LAUGHING, BUT IT MAY SCARE YOU A LITTLE ALSO.
I AM A FAN OF CAROL KANE, FROM HER ODD CHARACTER OF SIMKA ON THE TELEVISION SERIES TAXI, UP UNTIL TODAY!!!
SHE BRINGS THIS CHARACTER TO LIFE!!!
IF YOU LIKE THRILLERS WITH A HINT OF COMEDY THROWN IN, THEN THIS MOVIE MAY PLEASE YOU!!!
THIS IS CAROL KANE AT HER BEST!!!!!!!",1031961600,4,418,4.2375
994759,3,6305240663,"Dorine is a lonely old woman who works for a modern-age magazine company  that's just brushing up with the changing times in cutting edge technology.  She lives in her childhood home caring for her cripple mother and leads a  pretty unsatisfying life. She gets a shock when company down-sizing forces  her to spend less time in the office and more time at home.
Then one  night, a superior accidently dies fixing electrical wiring. She gets  spooked and instead of calling someone, she decides to: lug his body to her  home, plant him in front of her basement television, and go on a homicial  massacre.
Morbidly sick, dismal, and grotesque slasher has admirable  direction, style and charisma. Kane turns in an EXCELLENT performance  (comparable to Kathleen Turner in SERIAL MOM), the camera angles are  astonishingly crafty, the music is haunting, and the ending is quite  shocking.
There is however one major flaw: the amateur execution of  painfully pitiful dialogue. It's unbearable at times. Also, both Ringwald  and Tripplehorn are completely wasted.",965952000,3,1057,5.141176470588236
994760,4,6305240663,"WHAT THE HELL IS UP WITH ALL THE BAD REVIEWS? THIS MOVIE WAS A HORROR LOVERS DREAM. I JUST FINISHED WATCHING IT AND KNEW THAT I HAD TO VOICE MY OPINION. THIS MOVIE IS GREAT!  SHOCKING AT TIMES, SUSPENSEFUL AND CREEPY. THE ENDING WAS WONDERFUL, EXCEPT FOR THE LAST FEW MINUTES(THE DREAM  SEQUENCE). THAT COULD HAVE BEEN REMOVED AND ADDED WITH ANOTHER SCENE, WHICH  IS WHY THE MOVIE GETS 4 INSTEAD OF 5 STARS. ALSO IT STARTED OFF A BIT SLOW,  BUT BY THE FIRST HALF HOUR U FIND YOURSELF STRANGELY ENGROSSED. I RECOMMEND  THIS MOVIE FOR ANYONE LOOKING FOR CHEAP THRILLS. OR A JUST PLAIN FUN  MOVIE!  TWO THUMBS UP...",945475200,3,612,4.45945945945946
994761,4,6305240663,"I will start out by saying, what a strange ensemble this is!  Carol Kane, Molly Ringwald and Jean Tripplehorn all in the SAME movie?  How utterly random!  Not knowing anything about Cindy Sherwood, who is she?  I rented  this by recommendation from a friend.  Did not expect much, judging by the  title and the stars.  I was in for a pleasant surprise.  I was captivated  by the sheer grittiness and style of this film alone to make it enjoyable.  It uses original angles and lighting in the production aspect of the film,  which is refreshing.
The thing I most enjoyed about this film was Carol  Kane's performance.  She makes Kathy Bates in Misery look like the lady in  Romper Room.  She played the part with such minimalistic ferver it became  frightening to watch.  Ultimately disturbing to see her go completely wacko  as well.  This movie absolutely shocked me, I couldn't believe what I was  seeing at times.  I just didn't expect Doreen to become so evil.  It's  like, why the girl scouts, WHY?
As disturbing as this movie gets, it  still manages to remain comedic, so over the top at times, you chuckle.  But then you ask yourself, why the heck am I chuckling?  (Am I that  sick?).
My hat goes off to Carol Kane in this performance of a lifetime  for her.  If your a fan of hers, you gotta see her in Office Killer,  ""the feel good movie of the year!""  (yeah right!).",944438400,10,1377,4.493877551020408
994762,1,6305240663,"This movie should have never been made.  I mean I sat down and forced myself to finish it because I thought mabye it would have a good ending, but no I was just grossed out and I MEAN I NEARLY THREW UP! This movie is a  waste of time,money,and a good cast.  Please don't see this utter peice of  garbage.",928886400,4,304,4.016666666666667
994763,1,6305240663,"This is a miserably boring film.  As a devotee of the bad scary movie genre, I cannot even recommend this for its humorous or gross content.  It is merely laborious to sit through.  all the reviews you read were correct.  Cindy Sherman's amazing photography has not translated well to the motion  picture screen.  Ringwald and Tripplehorn turns in high school play calibre  performances, and it is painful to watch the great talent of Ms. Kane so  devalued in this piece of schlock.  Rent more fascinating, subtle, scary  and truly hilarious species of this type of film-ones that succeed where  Sherman's attempt fails (e.g. Rod Steiger in ""No Way To Treat A  Lady"" comes to mind-if you are insistent upon slashing in an office  setting, good god even rent ""The Temp""-but don't rent this and  certainly do not buy it).",924566400,2,819,4.798561151079137
7885752,4,6305240663,"Photographer and director Cindy Sherman has been watching too many horror movies. This one is definitely the classic formula First an accident, then maybe another, then the trigger. Freud would be proud of this one.

No matter how fun this movie looks do not try this at home. And no, this is not what is meant by downsizing.

Dorine (Carol Kane) is working for a publisher that is about to downsize the office. The office is sort of dysfunctional anyway. Her character is more in line with Milton Waddams `Office Space' (1999). There may be a sub plot to this. Mean while it seems that everyone involved with making Dorine uncomfortable is invited to stay at her place. FOREVER.

So get out the sticky tape and popcorn to watch this one.",1503964800,3,738,4.6183206106870225
7885753,2,6305240663,"Not THE worst movie you will ever see, but certainly a runner up for worst ever.
A stupid premise, and a stupid direction process.
This was shot by a lousy photographer that has, Somehow,  fallen into ""popularity"" for a short time.
She is one of those ""Photographers"" that think themselves important, because they are a suffering Artiste..... battling the angst of a ""genius"".
Do yourself a favor, do not bother with garbage like this.
Buy a copy of Twelve Angry Men , and watch a real movie.
good luck",1493251200,,502,4.640449438202247

7885757,4,6305240663,"Carol Kane and Molly Ringwald shine in this office horror-comedy. Doreen (Carol Kane) is the office mouse. She is bright, efficient, and a social recluse. Kim (Molly) is outgoing and the polar opposite of Carol.

When a downsizing is announced, Doreen loses her sanity and becomes the most unlikely serial killer. This is a quirky film that doesn't require much thinking.

Parental Guide: F-bombs. No sex or nudity.

Part of a ""Midnight Horror"" DVD 8-pack.",1352419200,2,456,5.053333333333334
7885758,1,6305240663,A sick movie made by sick people for sick people (I guess I am in the category too since I was stupid enough to watch the whole thing. When it ended I felt sickened by it.),1347235200,3,172,3.8055555555555554
7885759,5,6305240663,"I enjoyed this film so much. And the key to enjoying it is to get rid of any preconceived ideas of what a horror film should be like. It keeps a sarcastic tone from beginning to end, and to tell you the truth, I spent a considerable part of the movie laughing when I was supposed to be scared. Carol Kane is fantastic as Dorine, and her performance alone is worth the price of the DVD. The soundtrack is also great and very fitting to the atmosphere. Just watch the opening credits and you'll know what I'm talking about!",1142640000,3,521,4.2727272727272725
7885760,4,6305240663,"THE MAIN REASON to see this off-kilter black comedy is Carol Kane.  Kane, once nominated for an Oscar for her role in HESTER STREET, went on to play the dispatcher on TAXI, but we've never really seen that much of her.  In her role as Dorine Douglas, the titled murderer, she gives a performance that is totally awesome.  Kane uses her put upon persona, her deeply infested hate and hurt to bring Dorine to vicious life.  Her scene when she finds her mother dead is brilliant in its intensity and the way Kane is able to jump back and forth.  It's not easy playing a wacko and getting away with it.  Here, Kane shines in a performance that should not have been overlooked at Oscar time.
Only Molly Ringwald as the bitchy coworker gives more than a passing performance; Jeanne Tripplehorn almost makes it, but the rest of the cast, well...
Anyway, this is NOT a pleasant movie, and along with CHRISTINA'S HOUSE gives further credence to the ban on door to door selling.
Worth a rent just to see Kane's killer performance!",1079049600,6,1020,4.546448087431694
7885761,5,6305240663,"A real gem from Cindy Sherman's creepier side.
Stellar casting! Molly Ringwald is stunning! Carol Kane is classic!
The clear packing tape scene still gives me the willies. PURE GENIUS!!!
