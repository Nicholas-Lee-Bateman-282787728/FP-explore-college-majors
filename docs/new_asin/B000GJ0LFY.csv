2614693,5,B000GJ0LFY,"This is an excellent example of what the History Channel has been offering us for years. Comprehensive, fascinating, educational and thrilling, Barbarians 2 picks up where the first season left off and continues with unabated force.

Beginning with the fall of the Roman Empire, the series moves through each of the remaining barbarian tribes, carefully documenting their progress during the fall of Rome. Each tribe's achievements is featured, in turn complemented by interviews and highly believeble actors recreating the most important moments in barbarian history.

The greatest battles and the most intruiging assassinations are brought to life alongside examples of ""ordinary"" babarian life. The war-cries of the soldiers, the clash of swords, the slash of blades, the carnage and destruction and bloodshed during the stunt-fights all help to bring to life a period in history all too often over-looked.

On top of everything else you've read here and in other reviews, Barbarians 2 has a special feature I wasn't even aware of: An episode of Conquest, featuring Peter Woodward demonstrating the use of Barbarian weapons and an episode of Modern Marvels: Knives, Swords and Axes, which details their importance, creation and use from the Stone and Bronze ages, through to the Twenty-first Century.

I found that such extras greatly enhanced my educational experience and were a delightful surprise. They were a great bonus for no addtional cost. What a bargain! Thank you History Channel!",1214784000,2,1494,5.371794871794871
2614694,5,B000GJ0LFY,"Although I have not viewed these DVD's in their entirety, they are exactly the same as the programs on the History Channel, both of which were fascinating and of great interest.  I have a deep love of history, and so enjoyed the recent programs very much.  Part of my great interest was because there were so many barbarian tribes it is difficult to keep them all straight.  These programs helped with that issue.  They also made it clear that although they were ""barbarians"" who lived by their wits, mostly in a nomadic life style, the barbaric tribes were very far from being dim-witted wild people only intent on raising havoc with those with whom they came in contact.  I was extremely impressed that it was a barbaric people who first made laminated, recurve bows.  Most of us think of this type of bow as something invented in recent years for hunting purposes!  They were and still are one of the most powerful, long reaching bows ever made.  Although they were called ""barbarians"" and were, in truth, overall a cruel people, they were extremely intelligent which helped them 'live by their wits'.  Who is to say the barbarian tribes were any more cruel than the Romans who delighted in throwing people to the lions, calling it entertainment!  These two DVDs are a wonderful addition to the library of anyone who is deeply interested in history.",1208649600,,1352,4.739316239316239
2614695,2,B000GJ0LFY,"It would have been possible to make it in one DVD, instead of two; sometimes it is boring and redundant, and the acting is awful !",1199923200,,130,4.038461538461538
2614696,5,B000GJ0LFY,"Is a good and interesting part of History, mainly because there is not much available on this Time Period, (Dark Ages)",1195776000,,118,4.666666666666667
2614697,4,B000GJ0LFY,"These DVDs are entertaining and informative. The only problem is they don't have subtitles. As a result, there were many times I did not know how to spell the name of a person or a location mentioned by the narrator. I had to search for them on the Internet in history books.

They are still worth watching. I own them.",1195516800,,319,4.316666666666666
2614698,5,B000GJ0LFY,"The 2nd addition is every bit as good as the 1st. These are well made and very entertaining. Much of the footage is dramatization, and they do a surprisingly good job considering that it isn't a multi-million dollar hollywood production. My personal favorite was the one on the Celts, it was extremely intersting. Franks was my 2nd favorite. All 4 were very very good though. If you enjoy medieval history and you enjoy the dramatization style then you will absolutely LOVE this set. Again, very informative and very entertaining.",1188259200,19,530,4.966292134831461
2614699,5,B000GJ0LFY,"This is the second DVD set from the History Channel that focuses on the Barbarian tribes of the Dark Ages. This series includes episodes on the Vandals, Franks, Lombards, and the Saxons. The first Barbarian series was an excellent introduction to a forgotten period in European history and despite some minor flaws, was thoroughly enjoyable. This second set, available currently through the History Channel, continues to bring this period to life as never before.

In the years leading up to and following the collapse of the Roman Empire in the West, hordes of often hungry and warlike barbarians swarmed into Roman lands from the East and North, inundating an already weak Imperial government in Rome. In many cases, these barbarian tribes were hired as mercenaries and served the Empire as hired muscle against other barbarians. This series focuses on some of the most famous of these groups, two of which went on to become extremely important in post- Imperial Europe. The Franks, under the ruthless, but powerful, King Clovis, would found a great kingdom of their own and lay the foundations for the Holy Roman Empire. The Saxons, surging west from Germania, would launch an invasion of Britain, claiming lands vacated by the retreating Romans, and served as the deadly enemies of the Britannic warlord who became the basis for the mythical King Arthur. The Vandals and the Lombards, though less well-known, also left their bloody mark on history as enemies of the Empire. This period of history saw the collapse of civilization in the West and the emergence of a chaotic time known to history as the Dark Ages. At the same time, Christianity spread throughout Europe, largely at the hands of the Barbarians themselves who came to embrace, at least nominally, a belief in Christ.

The History Channel's documentaries aren't always perfect and only so much can be presented in a one-hour episode. That said, I found this series very entertaining and educational. As with so many other such DVDs, this set serves as a introduction to a complex subject, but one worth exploring for those with an interest.",1174348800,65,2107,5.0

8133240,4,B000GJ0LFY,"The second of the Barbarians Series of documentaries, makes a good book end for the Barbarian Saga. Today students and history buffs have a cornucopia of choices,almost every era of history is covered. The availability of so much material at modest prices,insures the subject of history will be studied long in the future. A good value for the money, the Saxon Saga is especially well done. But there are no bad chapters, so enjoy the ride.",1383955200,,440,4.802631578947368
8133241,5,B000GJ0LFY,"I bought this for the section on the Anglo-Saxons, but found the rest of it fascinating too. This dvd is especially good if you are a high school teacher, as it is general enough to not overburden one with too much detail and yet it gies you enough to make it interesting. This is one of History Channel's few triumphs.",1377993600,,319,4.333333333333333
8133242,5,B000GJ0LFY,"excellent documentary for the Barbarian period of Western Europe. Documented each wave of Barbarian invasions instead of just lumping them all together, which would have been inaccurate. The Barbarian invasions happened over more than a 100 year period, not in one event.  And this presentation documents that fact well.",1375920000,,320,5.530612244897959
8133243,3,B000GJ0LFY,Unfortunately has the repeat footage that the folks at History channel are so fond of for burning up time.  I do like the historic significance.,1296691200,,144,4.76
8133244,4,B000GJ0LFY,"I was surprised at how much I liked the re-enactment. The production value is excellent, and even better than the original series.
This would make an excellent compliment to the Germanic Tribes DVD produced by Kultur, since it supplements much of the material therein. I'm not sure I would recommend it as a stand-alone, since some of the information is legendary, this doesn't mean it any less interesting, its just that the narration should be up front about it.",1287705600,2,464,4.886075949367089
8133245,5,B000GJ0LFY,"With documentaries my primary concern is, ""can it hold my attention""?  The story of the barbarian invasions is one that needs to be told graphically, and violently, while noting the elements of political intrigue that cut down the successive rulers of the tribes. The acting in this documentary is excellent, the choreographed battles seem realistic in how they might have actually played out, and you can keep track of which barbarian king is plotting against which other king and against the roman empire. This set definitely held my attention for the full production. I highly recommend it.  The DVD's functioned well, audio and video quality were excellent.

Wish I could say more, but I never actually watched the video; it is a good gift for a history buff, though.  Will probably get him more History Channel series, because he finds them accurate and interesting.",1260144000,,278,4.411764705882353
