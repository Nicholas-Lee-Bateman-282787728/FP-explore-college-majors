5985774,2,B00FERT0PK,"I love this movie! It is one of my best remembered childhood movies. I've owned VHS 3rd generation copies off tv. I also purchased a couple of bootleg copies in my quest for a decent copy. When i saw this was finally released..OFFICIALLY,by Universal,I was ecstatic! Unfortunately when I got a look at my copy,I was(AM!)soooooo disappointed that mere words cannot convey the depression that set in.  First off,it should have been released in 1.85 and not in the 1.33 that they released it in. Also,this is the best video copy that I have but it is far below the standards I've come to expect from a dvd or even the dvrs I've purchased. I would much rather they had waited for a good copy to appear than to release this poor excuse for a video. Especially at this over-inflated price. Veeeeeeery DISSAPOINTING Universal, try harder next time!",1381968000,39,841,4.6824324324324325
5985775,5,B00FERT0PK,"Universal Vault Series THE THING THAT COULDN'T DIE (1958) is finally released on DVD - print quality is the best out there to date (very good to excellent) but it is soft in places and definitely could use an upgrade. No special features, no trailer, but still worth the price. I dig this flawed B movie - lots of creepy moments and a fantastic plot that's fun even if logic is in short supply. The film is loaded with eerie music from Universal's THIS ISLAND EARTH, CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON and THE MONOLITH MONSTERS (some other cuts of music were later re-used in William Castle's 1966 Universal picture LET'S KILL UNCLE). I have an old Detroit newspaper from 1958 and the big horror double bill that summer was HORROR OF DRACULA and co-feature THE THING THAT COULDN'T DIE - I know the film has a lot of unintended laughs but I think the director's heart is in the right place - it's his head I'm worried about. Robin Hughes is excellent as the evil Gideon Drew (reminds me of his HOWLING MAN performance on TWILIGHT ZONE two years later). Andra Martin is sexy scary and William Reynolds makes a solid leading man. By the way the big blockbuster that summer of 1958 was the Rock Hudson film TWILIGHT FOR THE GODS (a now obscure film that has never made it to VHS or DVD) and yet more than fifty years later there is still demand for low budget horror flicks like THE THING THAT COULDN'T DIE.

5985783,3,B00FERT0PK,"Low production values are offset by a strange and interesting story.  This one is different which is why I like it.  The head is someone that Sir Frances Drake executed for witchcraft centuries before.  Now he is looking for his body and using beautiful girls to find it.  I must say, this film does have it's titillating moments.  Also some humor as well even though the filmmaker tried hard to make the head an object of terror.  It's fun but the price should be a bit lower considering the transfer quality.

5985787,4,B00FERT0PK,"I love it for what it is ... it isn't Shakespeare, it's an old B-horror movie!!

OK, I enjoyed it. Quirky, strange, but I like schlock. I am such a sucker for these old movies. It is entertaining but not all that interesting. The movies rarely lived up to the titles, and that's what's going on here, but sitting up late with your friends was part of the fun.  Other than that it's just another b-movie that only some folks enjoy - and that would be me. Quality & sound are great.  Interesting and very fun movie with a hint of humor with the dumb workman. The characters are interesting as two completely change their personalities from the beginning as they have been changed by the head looking at them.

The movie itself is pretty fun nonetheless. With its heavy occult themes this was a big departure from the usual horror films that Universal Studios was putting out during the mid to late 50's. Sure, the script is pretty hokey and the dialog exchanges are painfully bad at times, but it does offer up some pretty creepy moments in spite of itself. And the musical score, surprisingly, is as good as any out there for a movie of its type. Very well done and it adds quite a bit to the overall atmosphere of the movie. If your a fan of 50's horror, this is a low-budget hidden gem that you will most certainly be glad you picked up.

If you enjoy these kinds of movies, I suggest you check out ""Svengooli"" (previously called Son of Svengooli) Svengooli is a hosted horror movie show. The show's title is taken from the name of the character host. The show is a long-running local program in the Chicago area and in recent years expanded nationally, airing Saturday nights on Me-TV. To make it even better: ""Svengooli"" (Rich Koz) is truly a nice & decent person in real life.

SPOILER ALERT
We open with a long shot of the McIntyre Ranch in California. Flavia McIntyre (Peggy Converse), and her ranch hands Boyd (James Anderson) and Mike (Charles Horvath) accompany her niece, Jessica (Carolyn Kearney) as she looks for water. Jessica is a water witch and with her divining stick is searching for a new vein of water for the ranch. Three guests arrive on horseback. Gordon (William Reynolds), Linda (Andra Martin) and Hank (Jeffrey Stone) express disbelief and disapproval at Jessica's superstition and childish behavior. Annoyed, Jessica resumes her search for water and finds something. No sooner have Boyd and Mike begun to dig, Jessica changes her mind and admonishes them not to dig as ""there's something evil down there."" Flavia overrules her niece and orders her ranch hands to continue to dig. Jessica leaves in a huff, but foretells dire consequences. ""I hope a tree falls on you."" No sooner has she made this pronouncement, when a bough of a nearby tree snaps off and almost kills Linda. They take Linda back to the guest cabins to recover. She wasn't seriously hurt, in her words, ""more frightened than hurt."" Jessica expresses remorse, but Linda assures her that it wasn't her fault. Jessica is convinced she caused it. Linda asks her about her gift, and Jessica explains she always had the gift to find things: not just water. Gordon, Hank and Linda continue to disbelieve her, so she directs them to where to find Linda's missing watch. She tells them they will find Linda's watch in a trade rat's nest at the base of the old oak tree near Linda's cabin.

Gordon, Hank and Linda head for the tree and after a brief search find Linda's watch, which is still working, and something else. They find an old charm that had been buried hundreds of years before, as the tree roots grew around it. They now begin to believe in Jessica's gift. That evening Gordon apologizes to Jessica. Jessica tells him that the voices that direct her searches can sometimes be evil and are hard to resist. Gordon presents the cleaned charm they found to Jessica as a peace offering. Gordon explains the significance of the design and places it around her neck.

Gordon goes up to watch Mike and Boyd dig for what they think is a well. They strike something and Mike finds an old chest. He hauls it out of the hole. Flavia is convinced that it contains gold and orders Mike to break it open. Gordon advises against such action. He explains that the chest may be more valuable than the contents, but only if it is not damaged. A preliminary examination shows a date: 1579 and the spelling and lettering is Old English. He can't read much more, and will need to clean it. He tells Flavia that only one Englishman visited that part of California around that date--Sir Francis Drake. Gordon suggests an expert witness be present and tells Flavia he will go over to Berkeley and get the chemicals and Julian Ash, the president of the Historical Society. Flavia is quite perturbed she'll have to wait to see the contents, but agrees. They take the unopened chest back to the main house.

It is clear Boyd is in charge and Mike is a little slow witted. Linda invites Jessica to accompany her and Hank to a dance that evening, but Jessica expresses her reluctance. She is hoping Gordon will ask her. As Mike, Boyd and Aunt Flavia approach the house with the chest, Jessica is overcome with a sense of dread. Gordon informs her that he has to leave shortly, but will be back late. Flavia locks the chest in her sewing room and leaves Mike and Boyd to guard it. Jessica tells Aunt Flavia she doesn't want the chest in the house, and won't stay if it does. Linda invites her to stay in her guest cabin. Flavia retires for the night and Jessica goes over to Linda's cabin. Hank and Linda drive off for the dance. As Jessica is trying on some of Linda's clothes, Boyd does a little peeping.

Boyd begins to get designs on the chest and its contents and steals the key from Flavia's purse. He talks Mike into tearing open the chest, but instead of gold Mike finds a dirty, withered head (Robin Hughes) that whispers to him. Meanwhile Boyd heads back over to stare at Jessica on the porch. When Boyd returns to check on Mike, he discovers the chest open and Mike behaving very strangely. Boyd pulls a knife on Mike, but is quickly disarmed by the stronger man and is killed. Mike returns to the sewing room to confer with the head, which tells him to hide Boyd's body and take the head outside. All the commotion wakes Flavia and she screams for Jessica to help her. Flavia and Jessica discover the sewing room door open and the chest empty. Jessica notices blood on the floor. Jessica tells Aunt Flavia to contact the police. Mike approaches the house and holds the head up to the window. It reacts to Jessica's charm. Jessica expresses the feeling of something trying to overpower her. Gordon walks in through the open door, accompanied by Julian Ash (Forrest Lewis). Gordon and Julian clean the chest. Gordon suggests that Jessica try to find the wounded ranch hand with her divining stick. They don't realize Boyd is dead and Mike is possessed by the spirit of Gideon Drew.

Jessica sets out on her search for the wounded ranch hand. Mike tells Gideon Drew's head about Jessica's gift to find things. Jessica begins to go into a trance and sees the trial of Gideon Drew some 400 years earlier. The judge (Thomas Browne Henry) sentences Drew to death for Satanism. He further decrees that his head and body be buried separately. During the trial the charm or talisman keeps Gideon's power under control. Jessica wakes from her trance and heads back to the house, and finds Boyd's body in the hole dug earlier. The police arrive as Linda and Hank return from the dance. Gordon takes the police to Boyd's body. He suggests that Mike might be the culprit. Gideon's head realizes Mike's usefulness has come to an end and must transfer his influence and control over to Linda. He makes Mike attack the police with Boyd's knife. The police kill Mike. Linda takes the head back to her cabin and places in on a closet shelf. Linda tries to get the charm from Jessica, but is unsuccessful.

Gordon, Julian and Flavia meet the next morning. Gordon tells Flavia that the chest only contained a head, and Julian tells Flavia that he believes the casket with the rest of the body is on the ranch property. He wants to find it and will pay Flavia if they can recover it. Linda joins them and suggests they ask Jessica for help. She knows that for Gideon Drew to return to life he needs his body. Jessica joins them. They ask her help, but she refuses. Julian Ash gets the idea that ""the gift"" is probably inherited and suggests Flavia give it a try. Jessica is angry and goes upstairs to pack. She intends to take the bus to a cousin's house to stay. But before she can leave, Gordon asks her if he can borrow the charm to have a copy made. Gordon removes it, and without her charm Jessica is now vulnerable to Gideon. Linda presents the head in a hat box to Jessica as a going away gift. Jessica is now possessed and her behavior changes radically. Jessica announces she has changed her mind about leaving and will help find the body. Of course, she finds it. They dig up the casket and return it to the house.

Jessica retrieves Gideon's head and joins it to the headless body. Gideon Drew is now whole and can move, breathe, and speak. His first order of business is to sate his thirst for blood. He threatens the assembled cast. Gordon tries shooting him with a gun, but it has no effect. Drew can't decide who to kill first. He settles on Gordon, but Gordon has the talisman and repels him with its power. Gordon tosses the charm into the casket Gideon Drew has fallen back into and they close the lid. The spell is broken, and when they open the casket all they find is a skeleton. Gordon retrieves the charm and places it back around Jessica's neck. We close with a close up of the charm on Jessica's ample chest.",1443225600,,9789,4.539376770538244

5985815,5,B00FERT0PK,"My star rating is for this wonderful, crazy film, which is the essence of low budget 1950s horror at its best - great low key lighting, the fabulous Universal music library, surprisingly good cast in every part, and a story which is both entertaining and insane, about a whispering severed head looking for its body, an anxious young woman who is a neurotic water witch, some strangely suggestive scenes of the two leading ladies in bed together - all of it like a crazy dream you half remembered and which became incoherent but fascinating.  There are many bizarre and memorable images throughout this film.

However, this video transfer is so bad that I was extremely disappointed and actually shocked it was put out by the studio that owns the film!  They have somewhere in their vaults the original negative of this well-photographed film (shot by an ASC director of photography) but they did NOT use that material for the transfer. Instead, they obviously used  a video master that was taken from another video - a copy of a video copy.  In fact, it is so bad it actually looks like a VHS tape home-transferred onto DVDR.  I also have the Sinister Cinema version of this film, and it is better in video quality than this one released by Universal - and Sinister did its own video master from an old 16mm print!

I can't help but say there is a subtle lesbian subtext in this. Well, the two young women characters are shown sleeping together at a couple points in the movie. Yes, I know I am stretching it, but what if two male stars were shown in bed together? And for those who think that in the ""pure"" 1950's there would never be anything like this, then you should look at some of the paperback covers that displayed lesbian relationships.

It also has the great Thomas B. Henry in a quick supporting role. The head is trying to reclaim its body and it takes almost the whole film to do so. But the ending is worth the wait.

The characters are interesting as two completely change their personalities from the beginning as they have been changed by the head looking at them. I would recommend it.,1387152000,4,247,4.880952380952381
5985822,5,B00FERT0PK,"I have been waiting for years to see the release of this film. I have watched it on utube, but that is not same. Now I can watch it on my big screen tv. It has good sound and good picture. I was worth the waite.",1386028800,,211,3.608695652173913
5985823,4,B00FERT0PK,I was surprised to see the best DVD transfer of this old B movie classic to date.  This is the third Vault Series DVD that I have viewed.  All three have been improvements over the poor versions I owned.,1385251200,3,203,4.17948717948718
5985824,4,B00FERT0PK,I am such a sucker for these old movies. It is entertaining but not all that interesting. It's just another b-movie that only some folks enjoy - and that would be me. Quality & sound are great.,1384300800,,193,4.243243243243243
5985825,5,B00FERT0PK,"Don't expect a sudden miracle of a high quality version - the film was in CHEAP CHEAP BW, so there is simply no improving upon the Drive-in fair it was intended to be.  That said, the transfer is perfect (as I said it's not astounding, because the original film quality was B-movie cheapo).  But then, like many old Vincent Price films and other Drive-in fodder, it's a great campy movie.

Sexy William Reynolds (FBI series) is a college lad come home to find local girl-child now all grown up.  He is upset with her dowsing abilities, deems there nothing more than superstitions and fears.  He quickly learns she can dowse, and that superstitions have roots in truths.  Robin Hughes was naughty pirate type named Gideon Drew, who was beheaded by Sir Francis Drake for the crime of practicing devil worship. (Hughes was in The Twilight Zone episode, The Howling Man, playing the devil.)  Not content with just offing poor Gideon, Drake wanted to make sure none of the devil worship magic could bring Drew back, so he had Drew's head buried in one box, his body in another.  Naturally, our waterwitch has found the chest with the head, and the head is very urgently wanting his body back.

So pop the popcorn, turn out the lights, and pretend you at a 1950s Drive-in.  It just doesn't get any better than this.",1383177600,20,1309,4.627705627705628
5985826,4,B00FERT0PK,"Although I cant comment on the quality of the dvd, the movie itself is pretty fun nontheless. With its heavy occult themes this was a big departure from the usual horror films that Universal Studios was putting out during the mid to late 50's. Sure, the script is pretty hokey and the dialog exchanges are painfully bad at times, but it does offer up some pretty creepy moments in spite of itself. And the musical score, surprisingly, is as good as any out there for a movie of its type. Very well done and it adds quite a bit to the overall atmosphere of the movie. If your a fan of 50's horror, this is a low-budget hidden gem that you will most certainly be glad you picked up.",1382400000,2,680,4.27906976744186
8614997,3,B00FERT0PK,"What could have been an excellent cut of one of my favorite horror films was ruined by a lousy print.  It was clear enough, but a cursory examination of the picture revealed a complete lack of concern on Universal's part.  This ""Vault Series"" is not friendly with cheaper televisions, even on lower resolution the picture shows crosshatching and frayed edges in high contrast areas",1523145600,,381,4.9375
8614998,4,B00FERT0PK,This movie scared the crap out of me when I was a kid.  Its a little hokey now but still makes for a great lazy day movie.,1522540800,,122,3.5185185185185186
8614999,4,B00FERT0PK,"The Thing That Couldn't Die is one hour and nine minutes and was released in theaters on June 27, 1958. The story tells of a young woman named Jessica Burns who has psychic powers. She is seen at the opening of the movie looking for water using a witching rod and instead of finding water she find an old buried box believed to be 400 years old. Jessica is freighted of the box and wants nothing to do with it. Her Aunt Flavia has her ranch foremen bring it back to the house and has it kept under lock and key until an archaeologist can be brought back to the ranch to do a better examination of the box. However her greedy foreman wants whatever inside the box himself and convinces the slow-witted handyman to help him break into the box. When the box is open a decapitated head comes to life and takes control of Mike. During the rest of the movie head and body tries unite once again. One footnote about this picture is that whenever the decapitated head is shown, the music from the Creature from the Black Lagoon is heard. This movie was made during the era when Universal gave low budgets to monsters\Sci-Fi horror movies. The Thing That Couldn't Die gets a B.",1520035200,,1168,4.362385321100917

8615002,3,B00FERT0PK,"Fairly creepy entry in the Universal horror genre of the 1950's.  Thought they could have done a little more with it once the ""Thing's"" body and head were re-united, but still okay.",1495238400,,181,4.65625

8615004,1,B00FERT0PK,"I don't have any problem with the film, it's a nifty little low budget movie about an evil severed head up to no good. My problem is with the poor picture quality. Fuzzy, soft transfer, littered with chroma. Another example of a substandard mod dvd, released without no concern that someone is going to sit down & watch it. Looks like it was copied from a copy of an old video master. Absolutely NO detail. Videotape is better than this eyesore. Makes public domain dvds look good.",1482451200,,481,4.540229885057471
8615005,4,B00FERT0PK,"This arrived very quickly despite me opting for the basic delivery and I am really happy with the product.
The quality is what I would expect for a film of this age and far better than I'd hoped for.
This ran perfectly on my standalone DVD player.
My only complaint really is that I couldn't play this on my computer due to the anti-copy protection software on the DVD.
Whilst I empathise with the need for anti-piracy measures suppliers do need to accept that more and more these days users watch their media on a  computer and preventing them from doing so will eventually become a problem.
That said. It is what it is and I am very happy with the product and the service.
Took a star off for the anti-piracy issue stopping me from playing this on my PC.",1475193600,,756,4.361702127659575
