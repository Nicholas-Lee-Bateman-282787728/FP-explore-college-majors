I am in the US and see that this version won't play here which is disappointing but if you're somewhere you can see it I definitely recommend it, I've always wanted to see it again.  It's much better than the black and white movie, closer to the book.",1425081600,,299,4.0508474576271185
7945429,5,B00005MFJV,"A great and detailed version, more faithful to the book than the MGM all-star iconic classic.  I can decode this product for United States viewing, and I have sold similar ones here before under seller name glitteringhill. Anyone interested might check my current listing for ""Never The Twain"" which I offer with decoded version added free, and contact me via that link for similar service on this or any other region 2 disc.",1379894400,3,425,4.821917808219178

7945431,5,B00005MFJV,Please get this item in viewable format in the U.S. or else show me how to adapt my VCR to PAL format.  I bought this from Amazon and was unable to view it!  I can't wait to see it!,1149552000,5,181,3.6153846153846154
