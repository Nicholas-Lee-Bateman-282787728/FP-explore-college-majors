I then proceeded to go to Bestbuy to check out prices on mult region players and low and behold one of the sales guy who work there said they only sold them online however he had a buddy who was able to have it play on his laptop. Went back home and it plays perfectly, just had to change the settings around but its works!. The movie is awesome also.",1389830400,2,482,3.878787878787879
