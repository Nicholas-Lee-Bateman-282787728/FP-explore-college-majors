7843147,5,6303320333,This was a Chrisrmas present for one of my grandsons.  He really liked it.  I will have to get him anothervideo for this Christmas.,1370390400,,131,4.416666666666667
7843148,5,6303320333,My son loves this whole series!  It is so educational and fun at the same time.  HIGHLY recommended!,1240531200,,100,4.5
7843149,5,6303320333,"Oh how can anyone not like Dave and Becky?  Yes, it is cheese-whiz to an aged Camembert, but what kid likes $100 a pound cheese, anyway? The fact we bought it at NASA helped, too. Dave and Becky rock ANY planet, even if their production budget didn't include authentic stranded on the moon footage. ;)

I remembered this movie for my now teen's younger brothers so they could enjoy what he did as a tyke, because we liked how the production led to excitement without compromising character.

It is GOOD, WHOLESOME fun, w/o the in your face dramatics that is too typical of kid's productions nowadays.",1199491200,,600,4.6415094339622645
7843150,5,6303320333,"""Hi Dave and Becky! Can you fly the space shuttle to our house and play?"" That's what I heard my three-year-old saying while he walked around our kitchen with my cell phone to his head.  This video is largely responsible for Christmas 2007's heavy space theme.  Even our 1-year-old is running around the house with random items, like spatulas and dog toys, saying ""space!"" and making space sounds.  Embrace the wonderful horrible and intentional bad acting for the genius it is.  Freeze frame Dave using the toilet on the space shuttle and prepare for lift off.  Good, good stuff.  We also have ""There Goes a Train, ... an Airplane, ... a Helicopter..."" etc.  This one is by far the fave in the house.",1197763200,,701,4.650406504065041
7843151,5,6303320333,"Dave and Becky are back in this movie which takes them to the Kenedy space center among other places. Typical Dave antics abound, but I know my children have learned lots from this and all the ""There goes a...."" movies.",1091404800,,219,4.5
7843152,4,6303320333,"If you are familiar with the There Goes A .... video series, you'll know what to expect here.  Dave and Becky visit rockets, try on space suits and generally bring a bit of the Stooges to NASA as they learn about rockets and astronauts.  Not the best of there many adventures, but of interest to fans of the series or kids who want to know a bit about our space program.",1091232000,3,370,4.197183098591549
7843153,1,6303320333,"Grandma gave us this video and my sons just hated it. There is no coherent organization at all to the footage - the narrators just race frantically around a space museum from a space simulator to a saturn 5 rocket to whatever else is nearby. The museum exibits offer no action of their own, so the narrators had to contrive some. And as for the narrators Dave and Becky... they seem to be in competition as to who can ham it up more on camera, which was enough to drive every adult out of the room. Not educational, not entertaining, but plenty annoying. Save your money.",1026691200,12,571,4.39622641509434
7843154,3,6303320333,"might have been a better title.  We have 2 others in this series, Fire Truck and Bulldozer, and they are worn thin from my kids' constant watching of them.  This one is different, though-- it is mostly about Dave and Becky goofily doing astronaut training stuff, and then dreaming that they are lost on a faraway planet (that looks an awful lot like the California desert) with no way home.  This is interesting to a point, but it's not the same sort of truck-o-licious excitement that makes your toddler jump up and down and scream ""TUCK!!! TUCK!!!"" like they will for the others in this series.  And I could have definitely done without the discussion of how astronauts go to the bathroom in their space suits-- as if little boys need any encouragement to go on a potty talk binge.  I think this video provides an interesting look into how astronauts train, and some info about what it's like to ride in a space shuttle, but there's nothing learned about space itself (which my kids and I were hoping for) and it's not the same sort of gee-whiz experience as the other, more vehicle-filled titles in the series.",1006300800,33,1113,4.601010101010101
