4252422,2,B0042ZH8KE,"We were there during the filming of this movie (which is a typical, cheesy EO production) and wrote and recorded the songs (NOT the terrible background music used in intervals throughout) which Roy sang.  We were very surprised to see this product on Amazon since all the recordings have been tied up by Barbara Orbison for year and never released!  At any rate, the movie was embarrassingly funny to watch and the songs are still great, Roy Orbison vocals.  However, the ADDED DVD of songs is TERRIBLY mastered and nearly unlistenable.  Will be talking to attorneys about the sales of these unreleased songs.",1355875200,8,609,4.883495145631068

8414035,1,B0042ZH8KE,"Pathetic movie.
Starring Elvis Presley's last girlfriend in the most wooden acting performance I've ever had the misfortune to watch.
Waste of film.",1420329600,,148,5.478260869565218
8414036,1,B0042ZH8KE,"There are no words in my lexicon that can do justice to just how bad this movie is. If you get a chance to buy a copy cheaply enough, buy it and, as a tribute to Elvis, BURN IT so that at least another copy is out of circulation!!!",1416700800,2,231,3.7346938775510203
8414037,5,B0042ZH8KE,Very good movie. .alot like the life of elvis Presley. .almost a copy to his life. .but still a good movie. .,1415059200,,109,4.0

8414039,3,B0042ZH8KE,"Being a staunch Elvis fan, I ordered this to see what Ginger could do as an actor.  It was very disappointing and even though they advertise that this story is really fiction, it was clear to see the similarities.  Both Ginger and the actor who played the rock legend were very disappointing.

The seller did an excellent job is packaging safely and having this arrive when expected.",1393200000,2,383,4.686567164179104
8414040,2,B0042ZH8KE,A thinly disguised take on the latter part of the life of Elvis Presley even though there is a disclaimer it is not based on any real person living or dead.  For this film to succeed the main actor has to exude charisma from the start to grab the viewers attention.  Unfortunately the lead who is played by Earl Owensby has all the charisma of a wet mop.  How did he get the role?  He owns the studio that made the film.  Nice work if you can get it.  Another negative is the hack of a director (Worth Keeter) who has a knack for making potentially exciting scenes fall flat.  Owensby's singing voice is dubbed by Roy Orbison who also composed the songs for the film.  I have not been able to find anything online as to whether Orbison saw this movie before he died.  The extra cd is actually a dvd with the songs from the movie repeated in a montage.  It also includes an interview with Owensby who talks about the film and how it lost out on an award to THE ELECTRIC HORSEMAN.,1388620800,5,978,4.209677419354839
8414041,3,B0042ZH8KE,"I got this accidently, but it was an okay movie.  I think it is supposed to be about Elvis, but it is a bit different.  It was good to watch once.",1359331200,2,146,3.6774193548387095
