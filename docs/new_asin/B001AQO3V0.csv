3460158,5,B001AQO3V0,"While I certainly enjoy the show, my larger disappointment is that there are so few shows to a season. To call 12 episodes a seasons worth of entertainment is a travesty. And when you actually run a clock on the 30 minute time slot, when excluding the opening and close credits, there was even an episode that ran a paltry 18 minutes. That's as if they ran out of ideas. However, I'll be waiting for next season's DVD release as HBO has gotten too expensive, too much original programming that sucks, too much ultra lefty Bill Maher who insists on hating and insulting ex-president Bush, and for whatever reason and fascination, too much boxing. After all, watching Maher line up 3 other ultra lefties at a table to take pot shots at an ex-president, who may deserve some criticism, gets pretty old. Once the Sopranos ended, the only good series left are Entourage and Curb Your Enthusiasm. Eventually every series jumps the shark, and I don't expect Entourage to be any different. But this was an entertaining season.",1241654400,9,1018,4.724719101123595
3460159,5,B001AQO3V0,"I am 82 years old and this series has kept me jumping. The first three season were great, but the boys really hit their stride in the fourth season. The humor in this segment with Drama and Turtle is some of the best I have seen. The sub characters which are inserted from time to time are well cast. Dom and Billy come to mind. Outstanding in his ongoing role is Ari's secretary. I like the way in which Doug Ellin keeps two to three stories going within each segment, but ties them all together. The fast pace is a key element in holding your interest. I feel the best defined parts are Ari, Drama, Vince and Turtle. There is something lacking in E. I like him, but he needs to become less boyish. I hope I don't run out of steam before the series ends. How about another 7 or 8 years. If you guys will hang in I 'll certainly try. RD",1232928000,80,836,4.103658536585366
3460160,5,B001AQO3V0,"As a dedicated Entourage fan since season one, I am waiting anxiously for Season five to be released on dvd / blueray.  Doug Ellin has crafted a masterful show, that keeps you coming back for more every week.  My only gripe is that half hour the show runs goes by way too quickly, but is worth every minute.  As always the guest stars were a plenty, from Martin Scorsese to Jamie Lynn Seigler.  I have only high praise for the entire cast, as proven by Jeremy Pivens award winning performaces as best supporting actor in a comedy or drama.

Season six will premier druing the summer of 2009, and it can'tcome too soon.  If you haven't watched Entourage before, buy the Seasons 1-4 box sets, sit back and enjoy.  You'll watch then over and over just to make the time pass quickly until Season six airs.

Join the Entourage and learn to love livin the life.",1231113600,9,855,4.435897435897436
3460161,4,B001AQO3V0,"Entourage has done it again and thoroughly entertained me! I can't wait to see the rest of the season and am sure that I will swell with sadness when it ends (unless I still have my Real Time and Big Love, then all will be OK). I thought all the characters were great and the pacing of the show couldn't be better. I loved how everyone seemed to be right back at it and the fun voyeuristic view of Hollywood is as enjoyable as it has ever been.

That said, what is the problem with the writers and how they deal with women? Are women seriously relegated to be sex objects on a fantasy island or pornography pixels watched instantly in the car (with friends who seem to care little)? As far as I am concerned, this is the aspect of the show that I don't buy. I have two sisters living in Hollywood and they are very strong women. They don't simply giggle and mess around with any movie star related person they run across, I doubt many women actually do.

In addition to the borderline misogyny that takes place on the show, I want to be able to watch it with my wife without being worried about the next possible silicone waif that will suddenly appear topless on top of Vinnie's groin. Call me a puritan if you must, but I think the nudity on HBO has been done in much less ""Showtime-y"" ways in the past (think Sopranos). If this is HBO's way of trying to catch up to the risque material on Showtime, think again, you will always have the upper hand as long as you stick to what you have been doing (Six Feet Under, Deadwood, the list goes on and on and on).",1220832000,9,1559,4.210702341137123

Kevin Dillon and Rex Lee are sometimes over the top, but the best of the show is Jeremy Pevin. I think Entourage began as a show about the main character, Vince Chase (Grenier), and often it still is, but it has become just as much, if not more, about Pevin's character, the agent, Ari Gold, and I think I like the even show more because of that.",1455580800,,445,4.506172839506172

I kept hoping the acting of Vince would get better to fit the roles he's getting but I guess coasting on pretty is universal. Jeremy Pevin is great but he also has the best role. I was irritated by the ""trippers"" episode because it was a complete rip off of story and shots of Oliver Stone's Doors movie. It wasn't the first Doors reference. Vince can have a passing resemblance at times to Jim Morrison and Kevin Dillon was in the Doors movie. Hate the Johnny Drama character, thought he might grow, but that's probably the point.",1452038400,,584,4.518867924528302

3461295,5,B001AQO3V0,One of my favorite shows ever!! No lie,1445644800,,38,3.875
3461326,3,B001AQO3V0,"Had absolutely never heard of this series until it popped up online and I inhaled the 96 episodes in a sort of binge coma. Initially enjoyed watching the team of innocents trying to stay afloat in the vapid material world of movie celebrity. It was a fresh idea with an intriguing flow of stars, cars, and costly crowded party scenes. The characters are strong cartoons. Only Turtle ""evolves,"" sort of, through eight years of dope, sex, swearing, and Ari Gold's perpetually stressed  situations. But the characters become so materialistic and the characters so crude and soulless, the houses so huge, the bikinis, booze, and bongs so ubiquitous, that watching the final seasons was like stuffing in the last bites at a hot dog eating contest. I was pushing through just to get it over with. We never really understand why Vinnie is so attractive or whether he can actually act, since we never see him do so. Drama, who could have been the best character, is so crude, bitter, and misogynistic, that we cease to care if he wins or loses. E;s obsession with what's-her-name is unfathomable. And women are generally treated like s***, unless they scream and yell and curse like ""men."" The final film was almost plotless and seemed like a cluster of 23-minute episodes squashed into a box taped to a Scooby-Doo ending. By the halfway point, the only joy in watching the eight-year series was hitting the X-Ray button to identify the celebrity walk-ons. The most memorable moment was watching Matt Damon, seemingly disgusted with the celebrity falseness and excess, pushing Vince to make a decent contribution to his charitable organization. The actors were no more convincing as childhood buddies, than the Monkeys were convincing as a band. But I did love the Monkeys when I was little and, in fits and starts, cared a little bit for these mildly talented kids.",1445558400,2,1858,4.879746835443038

3461379,3,B001AQO3V0,"Maybe I notice it more since I am binge watching streaming reruns, but when watching the seasons and episodes back to back it seems like there really isn't much new going on.  Vince maybe wants to work.  Vince hooks up with random girls.  Turtle smokes weed and makes crass comments about women.  Drama has some drama and makes crass comments about women.  Ari yells at E.  E yells at Ari.  Then they all hug it out.  Except for Shauna is there any female character who is not just  15 seconds of T&A?  Even Mrs Ari is only good for being the butt of blowjob jokes or as Ari's wet blanket.  The show is a bit like eating the same meal every day: it might still be good but after a while you start wondering if there is some way to change it up.",1444867200,3,744,4.1328671328671325

There is nothing about this show I can talk about to my friends, share on Facebook, maybe Twitter. Talk about gratuitous sex, language, nudity, it just comes from nowhere.

3462468,5,B001AQO3V0,"I never got to see the show when it was airing on HBO, but I have really enjoyed watching the show on DVD. ENTOURAGE: SEASON 4 ended on a big downer as Vinces (Adrian Grenier) dream project that he starred in and co-produced, MEDELLIN, bombed at Cannes. ENTOURAGE: SEASON 5 picks up several months later. Vince has literally been living on a beach in Mexico drowning his failure in alcohol and women. Ari (Jeremy Piven), Eric (Kevin Connolly), and Drama (Kevin Dillon) travel to Vinces hideaway to convince him its time to get back to work. Vince was a man who was at the top of his game before the failure of MEDELLIN, has to scrape and scrap before he can even get back in the game. Prior to the finale of Season 4, ENTOURAGE had always been a show about a highly successful film star that never had anything more than superficial problems. Personally, I found Season 5 to be the most interesting season so far because Vince is no longer the mega-star he once was and theres no guarantee that he will ever get his former glory back.

Season 5 is filled with tons of guest stars, including Frank Darabont and Jason Patric. However, one of the most interesting ones is Jamie Lynn-Sigler (THE SOPRANOS) who ends up dating Turtle. Mark Wahlberg also returns to the series playing himself in a game of golf against his former agent Ari.

The episodes in ENTOURAGE: SEASON 5 are:

1. Fantasy Island  Months after the debacle at Cannes, MEDELLIN is now a straight-to-DVD release. Ari, Eric, and Drama travel to Mexico to convince Vince its time to come back and get back to work. Drama is still in love with Jacqueline, the girl he met at Cannes.

2. Unlike a Virgin  Vince has an encounter with one of his former girlfriends, Justine Chapin (Leighton Meester) that leads to a serious realization by Vince. Eric tries to represent two independent film writers. Dramas relationship with Jacqueline ends badly.

3. The All Out Fall Out  Vince agrees to appear at a sweet sixteen party to avoid bankruptcy. Drama gets drunk.

4. Fire Sale  Ari is interested in the indie script Eric is trying to sell. Drama appears on THE VIEW.

5. Tree Trippers  Vince is offered a part in BENJI for $3 million. Vince, Drama, Turtle, Eric, and Ari head out to Joshua Tree National Park to trip on some mushrooms with Eric Roberts. Lloyd is supposed to watch Aris house while Mrs. Ari and the kids are gone, but ends up throwing a gay party.

6. ReDOMption  Ari plays a game of golf in an attempt to get a role for Vince. Dom finds himself in jail and asks Vince for bail, but only Eric is able to afford it. Turtle agrees to be Dramas personal assistant.

7. Gotta Look Up to Get Down  Vince does a photo shoot for Dolce & Gabbana. Ari attends a funeral and is offered the chance to head the movie studio at Warner Bros.

8. First Class Jerk  Turtle sits next to Jamie-Lynn Sigler aboard on a first class plane trip. Ari tries to get a woman he likes put in charge of Warner Bros. Josh Weinstein gets Vince a meeting with Frank Darabont.

9. Pie  Vince has some of his lines stolen in SMOKEJUMPERS by Jason Patric. Ari has lunch with an old friend, Andrew Klein.

10. Seth Green Day  Erics client Charlie gets his pilot script picked up by the network, but the studio wants to cast Seth Green. The director of SMOKEJUMPERS continues to torture Vince. Ari and Lloyd give Andrew Klein a Hollywood makeover to impress Babs.

11. Playn with Fire  Vince is fired from SMOKEJUMPERS and the studio ends up shutting the movie down. Turtle gets an unexpected call from Jamie-Lynn.

12. Return to Queens Blvd.  with SMOKEJUMPERS cancelled, Vince and the boys return home to Queens. Eric tries to get Gus Van Sant to cast Vince in his next movie, but Van Sant won't even let Vince audition. Eric and Vince get in a fight and Vince fires Eric. Meanwhile, Erics work for Vince didn't go unnoticed as Van Sant comes to like Vinces work and suggests him for a feature role to a friend of his.

ENTOURAGE tends to get better as it progresses and Season 5 picks up some of the steam that was lost during Season 4. Its my second-favorite seasons of the series so far, next to season 2.",1395100800,,4144,4.46879150066401

The cast is amazing.  In fairness, their female characters are strong and powerful, and Ari's gay assistant wields far more power than he might convey, but that doesn't seem to dampen the relentless female and gay verbal bashing.  If you are looking for something light and funny as opposed to all of the intensely serious and depressing series that dominate, and you can roll with the bashing, I say go for this one!  The music is unparalleled and it is the one episode introduction that I actually find enjoyable show after show and not annoying.  Overhead shot of suicide doors ....oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeahhhhhh.

3462516,3,B001AQO3V0,"Whereas last season we had the whole Medellin buildup and fiasco this season really doesn't have the drama (and I'm not talking ""Johnny""). It's kind of an interesting poke at Vince (Adrian Grenier) being criticized for beinga bad actor because, basically, he is in his actual life (let's get real, the guy better save all the money he makes from ""Entourage"" as he's not getting big roles in TV and Movies after this). The whole premise of ""Entourage"" that this guy is a star is laughable. It's the other three guys, especially Johnny Drama and Turtle, that have the funnier and more interesting encounters. Plus I find their roles much more believable than actually believing Vince is a movie star.

Given that the Ari Gold storyline develops way better and that's hopefully the direction of the show when it heads into the 6th season.

The celebrity cameos are pretty lame despite a very sexy Jamie Lynn Sigler and a gratuitous Martin Scorcese. I mean, are we supposed to take seriously that B movie actor Jason Patric (I dare you to find a single person who would specifically go out of the way to see his movies let alone pick him out of a lineup) is supposed to be a great star to rival Vince. Then again maybe ""Entourage"" is a parody with its tongue firmly in cheek.

The extras are lamer than lame this time around. Like all previous season DVDs, you get the season-by-season recaps, commentary tracks and, with this one, they throw in a short section on the celebs they got for season 5. Frankly, who cares at this point?

Why not bag the guys and find a new up-and-coming fake star and his entourage for Ari Gold to take to the top. In fact, I liked the whole Bow Wow (the hip hop ""star"") turn as a comic actor being represented by E. That showed potential as Bow Wow (I'm supposed to take a musical artist seriously when they name themselves after the sound of a dog?) can actually act. I have no idea if he can sing as my musical tastes run more Raveonettes than mainstream hip hop pop.",1311984000,2,1996,4.490358126721763

I enjoyed season five but didn't laugh as much as at seasons two and three. Too much Vince and Eric, and Turtle and Jamie Lynn, who aren't that funny, and not enough Piven for me. But I do like that Dillon was given more of an arc, as I think he is the great underrated key to this show. He cracks me up over and over this season, and it's worth watching it just to enjoy his antics.

Seth Green and that whole story got old fast; this show only really works for me when going for the laughs. The dramatic parts, as well as Vince and Eric in general, do little to get me going. But Dillon and Piven remain very sharp, quick, and hilarious, so once again I'd have to say this is worth watching purely for them.

Dillon deserves more credit than he gets for his work here. He is quietly and without fanfare one of the funniest tv actors I've seen in years. Givce this guy his own show, someone!

And kudos to Ellin, whose writing has remained very good throughout. It's nice to see him stay involved instead of farming it out to other writers while he makes the bucks, and it's proably the reason the show is still watchable, six seasons in.",1262390400,,1150,4.213636363636364

3462612,3,B001AQO3V0,"This season is decent.  I was entertained, but I don't know how good it would be for someone who hasn't seen the rest of the series.  Nothing of serious interest occurs in this season, since none of the characters except Drama have a job.  They kind of bum around the entire time.

You do start to see a different side of Vince in the later episodes when he gets frustrated that he cannot find a good film to work on.  But in general I feel like the characters just kind of ride on what they've already built in past seasons.

Still, it's like Ocean's Eleven.  Not much has to happen, but it's fun just to watch the characters talk to each other.",1258156800,10,646,4.245901639344262
3462613,5,B001AQO3V0,"I really have to wonder how much of this show feeds off the ""reality"" of Hollywood.  Ideas for storylines (I think I overhead a commentary about basing Vincent driving around to see lines for AQUAMAN on Tobey Maguire driving around to see lines for SPIDERMAN), guest appearances lampooning real stars--the fact that Jamie Lynn Singler is actually dating the actor who plays Turtle who's dating Jamie Lynn Singler is perhaps the bizarrest moment in all of this!

You laugh at a scene and wonder: did they base this on someone real?  Who was that difficult German director?  Are all studio heads this vindictive?

I liked this season because Vincent Chase is finally being challenged by the very business that's handed him the world.  It's all been so easy up to now.  Whether making millions of dollars or losing millions of dollars, Vincent has always just shrugged his shoulders, ready to go back to New York City when the party ends.  ENTOURAGE is smart enough to know that was never the real option behind this superstar.  It's good to see some ambition with him.

But the person I really watch this show for is Jeremy Piven's Ari Gold.  He's been my clear favorite for all five seasons.  And for all his obscene bluster and crazy energy...he's really a decent guy.  He looks out for his family, he works hard for his clients.  Even at war, he's difficult to hate when he's not on your side.  As long as they don't soften him too much, I'll always come back to see more of Ari's antics.",1257120000,2,1489,4.608365019011407

3462715,4,B001AQO3V0,"I was really debating on buying this season, as I still hadn't had a chance to view it. Season 4 left me lukewarm. Too much Medellian overkill and some wandering storylines with Drama/Turtle and Eric- Anna Faris etc. I was wondering if the show was winding down to its end.

But with the really great deal on Amazon ($14) for a season, it wasn't too much risk to purchase. My fave season so far was Season 2.

I thought season 5 was a pretty consistent tracking of Vince's grappling with actual career failures. And for us to see Ari's full range of abilities as a really strong agent beyond the aggressive kiss-ass facade he puts foward. He really does fully breathe and live the movie business and does know what real talent and quality is- He is also turned out to be the strongest family man. Unlike most agents in HW, he is really devoted to Vince's success and happiness. Usually mangers are the ones who really fix themselves onto clients and babysit their emotional self-esteem needs. big time agents rarely focus so much time/attention on one client, even superstars.

Seeing Vince battle Jason Patric, and the dictatorial German director, was a really great insight to the on-set struggles actors can endure. Yes they're sometimes paid the big bucks, but it can be grueling, emotionally wrecking work to put up with. I thought the last few episodes disk 3 were really really strong. It was refreshing to hear more honest opinions of Vince's career potential from other directors, agents etc. The finale as mentioned, was way too compressed to have any real emotional impact. Vince quick rise back to his normal star status felt really false way to end the season.

From the general tv bloggers, Season 6 is off to a not great start, feeling a bit too dated. Maybe they can recover or maybe this signals that the end is near for the Entourage gang. And it will have been a great fun ride while it lasted.",1249603200,,1913,4.6342182890855455

And Turtle has at least one remarkable surprise in this season.

Each episode takes a turn here and a turn there, keeping the viewer guessing.  The story writers have put a real edge into this season and the characters are really tuned into their stories within the story.  Ari is stealing every scene as Jeremy Piven is absolutely killing it.  Rex Lee (Lloyd) has continued his strong performances from last season.  Vinnie Chase starts slowly and builds to a crescendo in the last two episodes.  The story takes a daring turn that I did not see coming.

3462750,5,B001AQO3V0,"This has to be one of my favorite shows on tv right now. This season, Vinny is down on his luck and his friends, as well as bro Drama, are there to help. It's pure Hollywood storytelling and the comedy is still there, as well as some extra bits of drama. It's a great season, from start to finish. I also liked&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Entourage-The-Complete-Fourth-Season/dp/B0011UO91E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Entourage - The Complete Fourth Season</a>, as well.",1248307200,,516,6.180555555555555

3462752,5,B001AQO3V0,"If you're a fan of the previous seasons of Entourage then you will be very pleased with this one. Season 5 picks up with Vince hiding out in Mexico with Turtle after the disaster at the Cannes Film Festival (from Season 4) and goes on from there. Ari isn't quite as witty throughout this season, but he is still as enjoyable as ever. There are not quite as many story lines in this season, with Vince trying to make a comeback being the overall theme. There are a few subplots, but they aren't as interesting as seasons in the past. This season isn't the best, but it definitely is better than many other shows on TV these days. The show is a little on the short side (which may be a good thing for some viewers), but it gets you in and out of each episode quickly.",1246579200,,765,4.210884353741497
3462753,4,B001AQO3V0,"The funny thing about HBO series is that they all seem to get incrementally better over time. While I thought the second season of Entourage which focused on a tremendous career setback for Ari Gold was the best, this season was excellent on its own right because it finally starts to show the unraveling and human side of Vincent Chase. Chase has been allowed to remain an aloof enigma for most of the series. It seemed that he didn't care about money, power and any of the other benefits of being a celebrity. He alienated producers, directors, agents and fellow stars on a whim seemingly without there being any negative ramifications to him. In Season 5, the crows have started to circle around Chase and his place amongst the Hollywood up-and-coming stars is questioned. Does Chase have the drive to succeed or was he just a pretty-boy whose had some lucky breaks? Is his presumption that money will continue to flow in as long as he keeps a detached but positive demeanor still valid? What will happen to his relationships with his agent, Ari and publicist, Shauna as his star starts to dim? And most importantly, will the end of the series be Vincent Chase resigned to the same fate as his older brother, Johnny Drama --- an actor who could have been a star but whose idiosyncracies and arrogance derailed him? In essence, I like Season 5 because, as funny and cool as it was, it reminds us subtly that Hollywood is just as much a rat race city as any other place; there's just better scenery.",1246406400,14,1500,4.600746268656716
3462754,4,B001AQO3V0,"Just finished watching last episode of the series and didn't like it too much. It seems a bit forced, as if they tried to wrap up quickly too many loose ends. In addition they tried to shove into one episode enough plot developments to last for several 'normal' episodes, and it's not convincing, specially the big twist at the end which I will not reveal here. Also, I'm sorry to say that Adrian Garnier is not as a great an actor as Vince Chase is supposed to be. As long as all he had to do was to be handsome, smile and be optimistic, everything was OK. But once things get rough and he has to do play a character in real distress, his limitations are showing. Anyway as a loyal fan, I really hope that season 6 will be much better again.",1246233600,6,742,4.195804195804196

that it is still on hbo is more proof that this is the dumbest country on the planet.
with 'sex and the city' and 'entourage', hbo has created two large cow pies that are hurting the environment. oh yeah, i forgot 'john from cincinnati.'that's three cow droppings.",1246233600,6,320,4.836363636363636
3462756,4,B001AQO3V0,"Eventually only five episodes are going to become a ""season"" I cant believe 12 30 min episodes is a season nowadays. I finished the whole disk before breakfast. I love the show, but I just cant seem to get over how long it takes for vince to make a movie per season. He did so much work during the first two seasons but now Vince will be lucky enough just to get a casting or a sitdown before the season ends. I expect the show to jump ship soon because I cant get over that each episode starts with them at a ""party"" some insults a small gig and end of show. Only hardcore fans like myself will stick with the show but I don't know how many others are out there. Drama and Turtle were favorites this season compared to the last. Eric was the one that was poorly written, he comes off as desperate and he is a mediocre manager. Eric will always be second best to Ari.",1246147200,4,867,4.105882352941176
