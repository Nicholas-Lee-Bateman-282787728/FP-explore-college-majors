7398644,1,B014HDTT84,"It's my opinion that Kurt Russell must be desperate for money to have signed on for this completely awful movie.  He's been in so many entertaining movies that he, obviously, can read a script and see if it has a fair chance of justifying the audience's purchase of a ticket or if it's nothing but a rip-off.  He must have known this idiotic sham was going to be nothing but a fraud on those who would pay to watch it.  Kurt, you've put my money in your pocket for the last time.",1445644800,3,479,4.184782608695652
7398645,5,B014HDTT84,"Watch immediately if you're a fan of Kurt Russell or original horror movies. The writer/director does not disappoint in crafting a very original, entertaining Western that approaches a gory conclusion ominously and with very well-crafted dialogue. The acting is mostly very good. Russell, as always, is a badass. Richard Jenkins delivers an outstanding performance and Patrick Wilson shines as well. Prepare yourself for a slow burn that doesn't rely on cheap scares or predictable action sequences.",1445644800,240,499,5.578947368421052

This movie brings that nostalgic feel to a great western along with real dialog and real characters that interact like normal people.

7398654,1,B014HDTT84,"To get this out of the way, I love slow burn westerns (like Unforgiven). I enjoy good horror (both good and so bad it's good). I couldn't stand this movie. The characters are blandly written (a true waste of Kurt Russell) or irritating. The dialogue was mumbled. Too many scenes of telling the audience what's happening instead of showing them (it's almost like film is a visual medium and plot, characters, and mood should be communicated visually). I'm not a particular gore fan, but the gore was super boring and middle of the road. So many instances where the film maker made the lazy decision rather than the smart or interesting decision.",1533772800,,644,4.758928571428571
7398655,1,B014HDTT84,"Truth be told, I would honestly give this maybe 3 stars, but who bothers reading those lukewarm rational opinions? I enjoyed the actors and the situations and even the envelope that was pushed to limits commonly found only in comic books.
For the sake of decency and in an effort to warn parents and honor the Founding Fathers I give one star because it might be read and people will not only say ""Hell to the disgusting no! We don't want our precious little impressionable gifts from heaven, Bobby, Bobbie, and Whatev's, to be sucker-punched by the weird freakshow horror that is Bone Tomahawk."" This is not a family show, unless maybe its that family from The House of a 1000 Corpses. Now that was a fine horror flick.
This adults-only diversion spectacular needs a particular code warning viewers of the few minutes towards the movie's conclusion of a repulsive and potentially traumatic depiction of a person being drawn and quartered and the body parts thrown on the barby to be eaten by the desert cave-dwellers as they stomp about grunting and threatening, remarkably identical to Hillary. It reminds of a Sunday meal at the kids' table with giddy efforts at comedy waving chicken legs in the air and sporting black olives on our finger tips. Yes, we were blessed. However, the scary heathens need two hands to carry around a human leg while chewing on it. At this point in the show, I might have looked like the ultra violent criminal Alex from Clockwork Orange in his close-up during his reprogramming treatment, but that I was doing it because I wanted to and I need to ""see it through"" someday and prove to myself that ""I have what it takes"" in the self-confidence category as an amateur movie critic and foot dragger. Even though the moment of frozen horror was relatively brief, the effect was similar to the one I experienced when I saw Jaws at the afternoon cheap matinee. I went whole hog and purchased a large bucket of popcorn which I put under my seat as the movie was already starting and there's no ""How do you do?"" with Jaws on the big screen. No light comments humorously delivered about something in current events that everybody can relate to so you can laugh at the same thing a hundred unseen strangers are laughing at. Just the air not being inhaled like normal because many are holding their breath, sceaming inside and out, and getting a natural buzz from not breathing. Finally, after the shark exploded and the lights came up, I went ""whoosh"" and kicked my big popcorn with my heel and realized it was a shameful squander I had committed, but the magical power of Jaws had removed me from common humdrum life and I wasn't really at fault. Maybe I should give this Indy show more than one star. Was Jaws so much more righteous than this fine twisted western? Jaws was a great movie.
The truth is that I enjoyed the show, watched it by myself in the air conditioned comfort of my basement theater, and didn't need to worry about the impact that the extreme depictions might have on the impressionable.
I've been around the block and I'm not too afraid of ""the wild side"", and could easily be labelled as ""jaded"" like many others.
Another positive is the absence of the too-common moralizing hidden in the narrative by naive pagan college students trying to teach me what they learned in school, how to ""get along with weird perversions of every kind"" and that ""there is no such thing as weird perversions"" and  the rest of that squirrelly rehashed ""enlightened"" jive talk.
I'll stick with my Romans 1: 16- 32, thank you very much. Good movies are hard to find.

7398658,4,B014HDTT84,"68 years young.
I have always loved good westerns, but there are few recent movies which approach The Searchers, Red River, Liberty Valance, the James Stewart classics, Shane, the Eastwood/Leone collaborations, Once Upon a Time in the West, etc.. Unforgiven is a modern classic, the 1st Lonesome Dove is great, and I enjoyed Open Range and the Kurt Russell version of Tombstone.
Bone Tomahawk has an A-list cast, the requisite weathered authentic look in both town and people, beautiful filming and dramatic lighting, solid writing, humor, intriguing plot.
But late in the goings there is a scene of complete and utterly depraved brutality which, to be honest, I wish I had not seen, and wish that I could ""unsee"". This graphic butchery never would have been shown if this had been filmed in the 50's, 60's, 70's...probably even up to 2000!
Now, practically anything goes. Audiences of today seem unbothered by, and perhaps even relish, seeing this brutality. Certainly one can become inured to it; is it possible to become addicted to it?
Is that progress?",1533340800,2,1057,5.011363636363637
7398659,5,B014HDTT84,"I'm not surprised to see so many 1 star ratings for this film.. classic westerns tend to be a much slower pace than people are used to, and this film honors the genre impeccably. Of course, this also requires great acting, great dialogue, and great story-telling... which Bone Tomahawk has in spades. That being said, classic westerns aren't for everyone.. so if you can allow yourself to be absorbed by the creeping and careful development of this film, the payoff is horror at it's most terrifying.

7398665,5,B014HDTT84,"Someone on Facebook told me about the movie ""Bone Tomahawk"" and referred to it as a horror film.  After looking at the movie poster, I ASSUMED it was just another western but was intrigued by the photo of one of my favorite actors Kurt Russell. IT IS A HORROR FLICK and a damn good one if you want to see a whole new spin on this genre.  We've seen a ton of films with vampires, zombies and creepy crawling outer space creatures, but how many of you have seen films about cannibals?  Yep...cannibals.  This film will make your flesh crawl and it's been a long time since I had to close my eyes or turn my head so I couldn't see the next horrific scene. Russell is terrific along with his supporting cast of Patrick Wilson, Matthew Fox and Richard Jenkins.  The critics said, ""A most violent delight.""  ""...great dialogue, strong characters and imaginative and memorable kills."" Whomever that FB contact was that referred me to this film...THANK YOU...A HUGE THANK YOU.

7398667,5,B014HDTT84,"Very telling that all the one star ratings are accompanied by single syllable words forming a one sentence review.  I've watched this movie several times now, and found it as suspenseful the last time as the first.  It's a great story with great actors, and will ultimately become a cult favorite once the dust settles.  This movie takes a little patience, yes, but it's easy to relate to and care about the characters, and what they're up against is truly frightening every step of the way.  I've also badly broken my tibia/fibula, so I was able to relate well to one of the lead characters and the excruciating pain he had to deal with throughout the trek.  I found myself cringing every step of the way.  The climax is brutal, but believable, and terrifying.  Highly recommend, but the definitely not for everyone.  My wife, for example, would hate it.",1532304000,,855,4.691275167785235
7398668,5,B014HDTT84,"good movie, a bit gory but i personally like gore, the characters weren't very fleshed out but the acting made up for that. If you like this movie you should give ""The ballad of Lefty Brown"" a watch.",1531612800,,199,4.2631578947368425

7398670,5,B014HDTT84,"This movie is not boring, at least not on first watch: its a 'quest' or 'mission' story and actually quite bare-bones.  It is not full of gratuitous music (where the hell do they hide the orchestra in these modern movies??  They just seem so silly . . . Two characters walk into a woods and suddenly there is a huge violin section playing . . . I hate it!) but it does most unusual sound effects  -  and those odd sounds are actually one of the down points: not the weird screeching, that is great!  but the sounds of large people walking on the ground.  Their foley people have made them sound like a large hollow bass drum in some places, perhaps by accident (?).  It should be a dead thump, not a 'hollow' one.  Some of the outdoor dialogue also has a fake bottom.
The sets and make-up and filming are all professional.
It's a good yarn, and shown in a way to hold the viewer's interest - at least for the first watch.  Maybe not too much after that because, as others have noted, the middle part (on the trail) is rather lengthy.  This is not a defect because enough 'weirdness' has  already happened at the start of the film to make the slow tracking of the antagonists not boring but rather suspenseful  -  and also because, in this throw-away culture which has hundreds of films trying to get our attention at any given time, the movie maker can't assume that anyone would watch the film more than once.",1531267200,,1410,4.35632183908046

Its certainly a horror story in and old west setting, not your typical cowboys and Indians which was refreshing. Some scenes are truly horrifying and will retch your gut, however the character and dialogue is excellent.

Very unexpected, to the point I almost regret watching it home alone!  A long time Kurt Russell fan, he didn't fail to disappoint.

7398676,5,B014HDTT84,"Wow what a movie! It was excellent but it had it's moments that made you cringe and I felt a combination of Horror & Sadness from the gruesome killings that basically came as real as it gets. I would not wish this to happen to my worst enemy & I'm sure no one would with the basic human compassion and respect for life. It felt like what I was watching was really happening that's how real this film got and it was shocking and hard to watch at times. But I recommend this movie because I felt like this is something that could of very of happened back in the day or maybe even today in some parts of the world today, it really makes you wonder about the craziness that happens in the world.",1530489600,,691,4.125925925925926
7398677,5,B014HDTT84,"Ive watched Bone Tomahawk 5-6 times and I continue to be amazed at how exhilarated each viewing leaves me. Though the national critics praised the film across the board, I've read my share of public opinions (including ones on Amazon) declaring how ""appalling"" and ""unnecessary"" the gruesome horror elements are to the story, as well as a few ignorant comments about slow pacing. Well, as a member of the viewing public, I just want to share my opinion on how terrific ALL elements of this film truly are.

Starting with the screenplay, the banter between the four main characters is some of the finest in Western cinematic history. One particular exchange between Sheriff Hunt (Kurt Russell) and Chicory (Richard Jenkins) actually causes me to tear up EVERY time I see it... a pretty good testimony as to just how well a film can make one ""feel"" towards its characters amidst serving up some of the most terrifyingly shocking events a Western mash-up has to offer. The gruesome elements do not detract from the story one bit, but actually serve to heighten the sense of dread and despair surrounding these characters. And, it makes you feel for them.

The sparsely used score also hits just the right notes at just the right times to convey the notion that these men are riding into a potential suicide mission. In my repeat viewings, I always find myself thinking, ""these poor, poor men ... they have no idea what awaits them,"" and I experience the impending dread all over again as the horror unfolds. Absolute kudos to S. Craig Zahler for writing/directing something so unique that this powerful of a response could take place in repeated viewings... another testimony of how stellar storytelling and perfect tone can combine with truly horrifying circumstances to create the perfect visceral experience.

Lastly, I absolutely loved all four main actors... Russell, Jenkins, Patrick Wilson, and especially Matthew Fox in his role! Foxs character unexpectedly saddened me for reasons I cant really list without giving away too many plot points. Ill just say I was most interested in seeing how his spoken bravado and cock-sure aura would play out in the end.

In conclusion, Bone Tomahawk is a truly great film for the ages. Its not for everyone, especially the squeamish. But if you want to experience an uncompromising look at the Old West and what happens when (what we think to be) a typical Cowboys and Indians story turns into an absolute hellish nightmare, this might just be right up your alley. Its Russells best film in years and puts the other western he did in the same year to shame!",1530489600,,2599,4.860045146726862
7398678,3,B014HDTT84,"Westerns aren't really my thing but I watched this because it kept showing up as 'horror' and I like a good, scary movie. Sadly, this tips the scales as slasher and torture porn more than psychological horror and I'm not into gore.  I'm not squeamish but I don't really find it scary or interesting.

SPOILERS AHEAD:

Interesting modern exploitation hybrid of Western, Horror, and Revenge genres.

Pokes around at lots of politically-incorrect topics in a self-aware way (while carefully balancing so as not to go over the acceptable edge).

Kurt Russell and Richard Jenkins are wonderful in this; they're the glue that holds it all together. Fans of The Thing (1982) will most likely love this movie.

Things that bugged me:

How did Patrick Wilson's character climb up the cliff and into the cave at the end? Or was there another entrance (as Kurt Russell conveniently hints at). The movie has lots of filler and moves at a very slow pace - much of it could've been trimmed to allow for a visual explanation of how he got inside the cave (and out for that matter).

Why the overly complicated (and silly) anatomy of the Troglodytes (cave dwellers) to explain their vocalizations? It would've been cheaper and more logical to show them using some type of human or animal bone instrument to make their vocal calls. This is part of the aforementioned ""careful balancing"" regarding politically-incorrect topics. The director went to great lengths to prove the Troglodytes weren't simply humans. They're literally Orc like monsters with ridiculous anatomical features; this lessened the impact of the film.

Lili Simmons's character is a bit of an annoying Mary Sue. After being imprisoned by the Troglodytes and witnessing their depraved acts, she is mentally and physically untarnished except for a bit of grime on her dress. Her self-righteous snark goes into over-drive as she berates her rescuers with a ridiculous rant (more careful balancing). She even refuses to kiss her heroic husband at the end because there is ""something gross on his mouth""  *eye roll*

How it should have ended:

Arthur O'Dwyer dies after the horses are stolen.

While burying Mr. O'Dwyer, Brooder finds the love letter Mr. O'Dwyer wrote to Mrs. O'Dwyer and takes it with him.

Chicory dies heroically after they encounter some Trogs.

Brooder is captured and Sheriff Hunt escapes.

Trogs find the bottle of opium on Chicory's body and drink it.

Sheriff Hunt takes out the sleeping Trogs who drank the opium and discovers the device they use to make calls.

Brooder reads Mr. O'Dwyer's love letter to Mrs. O'Dwyer inside the cave and informs her of her husband's passing.

Sheriff Hunt lures a group of Trogs out of the cave with the Trog whistle and blasts them with dynamite.

Sheriff Hunt enters the cave and frees Brooder and Mrs. O'Dwyer.

They begin to descend the rope from the cave to the ground (Brooder and Mrs. O'Dwyer first).

Trog calls are heard during the descent - they grow louder heightening the tension.

While beginning his descent, Sheriff Hunt is pulled back into the cave by two Trogs.

In a heroic act  of self-sacrifice, Sheriff Hunt uses dynamite to blow himself up with the Trogs inside the cave.

The explosion seals the cave entrance.

Brooder and Mrs. O'Dwyer are bathed in the light of a glorious sunrise as they begin their journey home.",1527811200,3,3142,4.959847036328872

7398709,4,B014HDTT84,"The risk for Bone Tomahawk was becoming too dark, too violent, too light, too vapid, and generally too pulpy. Instead it is a perfectly balanced stew of savage menace, sharp dialogue, solid acting by well-cast players, canny cinematography, and well-developed characters roasting over the open campfire of Southern California's desert. The tight focus on just four characters is played out against the wide vistas of the West.

If you are expecting Gunsmoke, Unforgiven, or True Grit, this is not your film (althought the dialogue does call to mind the wry wit of the Coen Brothers). Bone Tomahawk takes its time to get where it is going, so that when it gets there you know the characters intimately. Make no mistake:  this is a character-driven film. There are no gunfights. When a character draws a firearm it is a spastic and lethal affair. The weapons have a weight to them that action movies eschew because it cuts shootouts short. Here, whe someone draws a gun, it is life or death in 5 seconds or less.

The plot is not terribly inventive, nor does it need to be. While that may be a fault to some I think it serves well here. There are no loose ends or convoluted work-arounds to make a character's appearance logical. It is a no-nonsense and straightforward narrative that feels refreshing in a cinemascape choked with plot twists and contrivances that make following the action a chore. Here, the stakes are set, and the players are off, and victory & failure are clearly defined.

Bone Tomahawk was made with $1.8 million and puts movies 150 times larger to shame. This is what tight writing an well-executed cinema looks like.",1526083200,,1639,4.801418439716312

********SPOILER ALERT********

********SPOILER ALERT********

At one point, two bad men strip a third man, our victim, naked and support him by his feet, legs held high, while his head and shoulders remain aground. Thanking heaven for small favors, this is all seen from the rear. Okay. Here's where it goes beyond anything I've ever seen on any screen large or small and I am not squeamish by any stretch of the imagination. It brought me bolt upright quite literally on the edge of my seat while softly and slowly exclaiming oh my God over and over as it transpired. A third bad man hacks down at the victim's exposed crotch area, repeatedly raising up high overhead and then swinging down hard a crude axe-like cutting device. (the aforementioned, primitive and vicious bone tomahawk, I believe, but I haven't yet brought myself to watch the scene again for clarity) As the cutting tool repeatedly hammers into, and eventually through, the poor guy's nether region, the two leg-holding bad men continue to spread the victim's legs further and further apart to the accompanying and disturbing sounds of crunching hip bones and tearing viscera. After a few too many wince-inducing strikes, the poor victim splits wide open and his entrails and guts exit in a splashing cascade; a hot, bloody-wet mess from the now clearly exposed abdominal cavity. OH - EM - EFFING - G! Ive never seen anything like it before and I may not want to see it again. (although I probably will watch at least once more as, um, research. Yeah, thats it, simply as research!) Normally I would never reveal details of a scene from a movie such as this in a review but believe you me, there has never before BEEN a scene in a movie such as this. On that you have my word.

But Kurt Russell performs well in this role as avenging sheriff..

One character who intrigued me was ""The Professor"" - a minor role whose screen time lasts for a single scene. But his character provides an ironic framework within which the story develops. In the midst of the horrors visited by  Native and European populations upon each other, there lurks something far more horrific. The Professor sees it as an almost transcendent evil.

Even though this film was considered horror, I never thought they would take it as far as they did.  The dialogue was great all the way through but the last section of the movie when they encounter the opposition was just too much. Hands down, I saw the most disturbing thing I have ever seen on film at the end of this movie. It literally made me sick. It takes a sick individual to enjoy that and walk away raving over this film.

Initially, I was put off by how long it is.  It's very good.  The plot is simple and predictably western in some ways, but with variations.  The woman who is kidnapped is smart and hardly helpless, though clearly overcome as anyone would be by the vicious attackers.  The dialogue is spare and rich; the action is surprisingly graphic but necessary to drive the menacing ""reality"" of the situation.  It's a parable, and if you see it that way, it's a pleasure to watch.  Jenkins said he chose the film because of the writing, which is an excellent reason to watch it.",1519344000,,739,4.462686567164179

Add to that a splash of comedy (albeit dry) and a few surprisingly gruesome scenes and you have a heck of a ride.

7398789,4,B014HDTT84,"Richard Jenkins was a guest on Fresh Air, and this film, Bone Tomahawk was discussed. Jenkins discussed how much he loved making this film. The cast was excellent, the storyline a little bizarre, but what fun they had making it.

Kurt Russell plays the Sherriff Of a small western town, Richard Jenkins his deputy assistant.  One night a stranger comes to town suspicious looking and acting according to the deputy. Sheriff goes to the local bar to have a gander and has to shoot him.  Lili Simmons plays Samantha, the intelligent medical person in the community who comes to care for the injured man. in the morning Samanthas husband played by Patrick Wilson, sees she is missing. He has hurt his leg and is recovering. In. The meant8me Sheriff is notified an assistant in the bar has been murdered. Horses are missing, and Samantha has been abducted. Off go the Sheriff, the deputy, an Indian crazed crack shooter, and thebhusband all go to search for Samantha.

It seems a weird zombie like Indian group is to blame for the abduction, and we enter the eerie zone. Come aboard for the outstanding actors, storyline and excellent written material. Not a fun time, but into the realm of the unexpected. An old time western gone astray, but you won't be disappointed.

the acting was terrific and kurt russell was exceptionally good, but in the end, for me, the depiction of the savages and their wails brought me out of the movie and it became rather hideous and ridiculous.  which is too bad.  obviously the writer/director is a super talented guy, but he just went to far here.",1519084800,,665,4.584745762711864

7398826,4,B014HDTT84,"Just when you might have thought the Western genre had been pretty thoroughly worked over, along comes ""Bone Tomahawk"".  The little town of Bright Hope is a peaceful enough cow town, until a thief wanders in, on the run from something bad.  That something bad follows him into Bright Hope, and comes away with the thief, a deputy, and a local medical person, who happens to be a woman.  The local sheriff will mount a rescue mission, one that takes the posse into darkness...

Kurt Russell leads a loaded coast as the sheriff of Bright Hope, duty-bound to track down the kidnappers.  The posse will include the sheriff's aging deputy (Richard Jenkins), a cowboy with a broken leg (Patrick Wilson), and an Indian fighter with much blood on his hands (Matthew Fox).  Together, they will track the kidnappers to a remote valley, avoided even by the local Indians.

7398840,4,B014HDTT84,"Bone Tomahawk manages to skirt it's genre schizophrenia by employing the best of every aesthetic.  S. Craig Zahler's warped vision of The Searchers that meets The Road has a self-awareness about it that reveals a sense of pride in not knowing what kind of movie it wants to be. Bone Tomahawk is a rather simple rescue adventure tale that that stays fresh by avoiding the usual bullet-stopped-by-badge clich&eacute;s and going with nuanced character studies, subtle humor and deft banter. Grizzled sheriff (played by Kurt Russell) recruits a disparate group of men bound by the objective of rescuing a group of villagers abducted by vicious troglodytes. The fact that these savage beings terrorize the town give the film an apocAlyptic tone. As if there is nothing civilized beyond the remote village the characters reside in. Once the four men venture out into the wasteland, a horrific sojourn ensues that gives Deliverance a run for its money.

  Most of the attention given to this movie is over the intense balance of horror and Western, yet the dramatic interaction between the characters is what make it unique. What is so refreshing and lovable about this film is how four men with clashing personalities can come together with such a realistic chemistry.  Every performance in this film is worthy of praise. Russell is his usual one-liner spitting bad ass self ( ""I'll slap you til you turn red"") while his aging sycophantic deputy (brilliantly portrayed by Richard Jenkins) offers rambling diatribes to ease tensions. Alongside them is the sociopathic, trigger happy alpha male John Brooder (Matthew Fox), who kills without remorse or reflection. His presence is offset by the good boy Christian cowboy Arthur, whose wife is among the kidnapped, played by Patrick Wilson. Arthur tries to recalibrate the moral compass after every perilous situation. What makes Wilson's performance especially good is how physically demanding the role is. He spends the entire film disabled and in excruciating pain.

All in all, Bone Tomahawk is a peculiar film that delivers something for everyone. Taut drama, brutally fun horror and tongue in cheek comedy. Recommended big time!",1515715200,3,2174,5.17948717948718

It has many of the elements of a typical western with the somewhat more recently added moral quandaries  (essentially survival vs. good manners and being a nice guy generally isn't the way to survive the frontier).  The antagonists in this action/horror/thriller are an interesting twist (not even the Native Americans like them so it's okay to fight them without triggering a ton of complaints and griping).  It gets gory (definitely mature content) which will no doubt turn off some, but I don't think they could tell the same story to as good an effect without it.  The gore has purpose and is not, strictly speaking, gratuitous.  Even with the moral quandaries, the new ""bad guys"", and all, it is, at heart, a gritty western and I found it rather enjoyable.",1514246400,,791,4.822222222222222

7398892,4,B014HDTT84,"I watched this on Amazon Prime last night and was surprised at the level horrific violence. The acting was terrific, with Kurt Russell and Richard Jenkins stealing the show. Now for a spoiler alert and a critique of some of the elements:
Patrick Wilson's character has a broken tibia (the larger bone of the lower leg.) Apparently, it was a compound fracture, and his wife--an experienced assistant to the town doctor who is never seen since he is also a drunk and indisposed through the events of the film--has been changing his dressing and caring for him back to health while employing a splint that might suffice for transporting a fracture patient a short distance, but certainly not for walking or riding horseback for miles. Anybody with the smallest knowledge of orthopedics would need to suspend disbelief as the film progresses. On the trail to rescue the captives, he suffers a displacement of his fracture, and it is decided by the assistant deputy--played by Richard Jenkins, who served as an Army Medic apparently--to reset this fracture and leave the man to live or die. Gangrene of the open wound fracture site was at one point considered by the medic, but a reset and re-splinting appears to allow the man to walk over rough territory with a crutch for miles, climb into an enemy stronghold and prevail.
The so-called Troglodytes appear to be a band of self-mutilating throwbacks who the local Indian population regard with fear and
loathing. These mud covered warriors carve holes in their cheeks where bore tusks protrude, and have engineered tracheotomies in which they insert animal bones to allow them to produce fearsome calls to one another, and of course, to frighten their enemies. Once again, in a pre-antibiotic world, this would have certainly been a selection process for the strongest immune system.
There is very little evidence that North American Indians, even the poorest of the Great Basin peoples, practiced cannibalism.",1511568000,,1957,5.024615384615385

For me, the turning point happened when the setting changed in the third Act, and isolated cave-dwellers were shown using jail cells to hold their prisoners, whom they had kidnapped from a jail cell. It lost all meaning when the Sheriff coaxed the cave-dwellers to take his opium, and they all take turns drinking from his flask, leading to a rescue attempt - making me feel like I had wasted my time watching the movie up to that point.

Things happened, and then the movie was over.  That's it.  I will forget the majority of this movie, but I'll remember I've seen it and never feel inclined to watch it again because there was no real depth to it.  There was struggle, and a good enemy to fight. The odds favored the enemy, and there was personal struggle.  Great.  But there's a depth to the old movies that isn't seen anymore, and that's why this movie will be forgotten soon after you watch it.  The acting was good, the story was decent, the struggles seemed real, and the gnarly parts were believable.  BUT, it didn't draw anything out of you like a well written movie does.  I didn't want to see the indians die.  I didn't WANT them to be punished for what they did.  I didn't fear for the ones who were abducted.  I just sat, mostly bored, and saw things happen.

A small town encounters a rogue Indian tribe that engages is cannibalism and makes eerie growling noises. Sounds weird, right? It could be a totally cheesy, tropey movie. But instead there is gradual character development, suspense, desperation, unexpected gore, and an ending that leaves questions unanswered. Definitely leaves room for a sequel wide open. I liked Matthew Fox as the gunslinger (thought Timothy Oliphant, their first choice, would've worked better in that part). I thought Zahn McClarnon (Talltrees the Indian) could've played a bigger role and added a dimension to the plot. For example, what if the cannibal tribe chief was his cursed brother, exiled from the tribe and forced to live with his family and friends for engaging in cannibalism? Instead of men distanced from their own humanity (as a cannibal). the tribe is made into something akin to horror movie monsters, complete with growls, covered faces, and no discernable speech.

7398915,5,B014HDTT84,"There's a lot of surprise to be had with this film, found in the interesting genre blend and the surprising amount of character depth.

With the blood and gore advertised as being over-the-top (it is actually tolerable until one, horrifying moment), I did not expect the pace to be what it was. The scenes dawdle, the conversations last longer than the shootouts, and the dialogue felt period appropriate and exceptionally well written. A 'slow' movie can be a bad one if not done properly, and Bone Tomahawk is a prime example of a film that makes each scene feel necessary and, more importantly, interesting to watch.

The characters and the performances make it so. While their titles are expected given the genre (sheriff, deputy, gentleman, town doctor, etc.), each one is fill out well by the writing and the actors portraying them. Kurt Russell is great, but every actor is worth noting in terms of the quality of their performance.

The first scene sets the stage, but it wasn't exactly the greatest first impression. The gore and horror, while not nearly as much as I expected, was effective and nauseating when certain scenes transpire.

The cast was great. I very much enjoyed the four main characters interacting with each other, especially the backup deputy. I thought the movie was appropriately paced for the story it told. I've seen some complaints about it being slow in parts. In my opinion the ""slow"" parts do a great job of developing the characters as individuals and as a party.

Kurt Russell, Patrick Wilson and Matthew Fox give great performances but oddly the real standout is Richard Jenkins who plays a crotchety old deputy named Chickory. He brings a great deal of humor throughout the movie and lightens what would normally be a somber scene. I really liked this film and if you are looking for something completely different in a western (think Ravenous), then you will enjoy this as well. Be warned however that there are a couple of extremely violent and gory scenes that might make some very uncomfortable. I rated it 5 stars.",1503446400,,734,4.6976744186046515

I have to say this really was a movie which told a story (shocking in this day of age) as opposed to most modern movies that use the format to simply dangle sex, explosions and cheap thrills in front of a slack jawed audience. I don't understand why so many people consider this movie to be slow-paced, as the entire time I was enthralled by the characters' emotions, interactions, and what was an obvious well developed lead up to a shocking and horrible climax. This movie took the time to actually develop the characters. Four men go on a long and dangerous journey to rescue a woman and deputy from a clan of cave dwelling natives, knowing that they have little chance to succeed. On the way they battle the elements in an uncharted and unmapped western frontier, are attacked by bandits only to lose their horses and supplies, and yet bravely continue on foot through the unforgiving landscape. Meanwhile, one of the men (the young woman's husband) is fighting a dangerous infection from a previous injury. The movie contains humor, adventure, drama, romance, and yes, horrific violence for those who are squeamish. In fact, the scene most reviewers are talking about is pretty difficult to watch and for those of you that have a hard time with that kind of thing should definitely avoid this movie, as it is shocking and graphic. But it is certainly horrifying and spine tingling, which is apparently what the director was going for. I watch a lot of foreign and independent films which carry no real ratings, at least, not the kind we have in the United States, and many times I see shocking things, but this still bothered me.

When the cannibals split the deputy, I just had to look away. But all-in-all, the film is just awful. How did they get these well-regarded...some iconic even...actors to do this one? The thing also feels edited to a conclusion that was the best the editors could do..as if a bunch of the story wasn't filmed. And this is 1891. There was no frontier, anymore.

The one I read did actually mentioned something about ""savage cannibalism"".  Should the director always leave the gruesome stuff to your imagination.  My God, don't even begin to think of how that meat ended up on your plate; now that's gruesome!",1496880000,2,403,4.714285714285714
7399015,5,B014HDTT84,"Excellent combination of the western genre and horror similar to the Hills Have Eyes. It is a very contained story and short, but the characters are very well played and grounded. The initial build-up is powerful, generating much suspense over what the true horrific nature of the savages they face. It culminates with shocking, brutal violence that isn't a gorefest, but manages to drive home the disgusting reality of the situation. Perhaps this is why it works so well for me. Over the top gore is not scary, it's comical. But here it's realistic, the sound design carries it even if you only get a shadowy glimpse of the actual acts carried out. Very impressive work that makes me surprised seeing the ratings on Amazon are relatively low. Upon reading them it appears to be mainly from squeamish folks that expected a typical western shoot em up or dreary cowboy drama. Not a lot of decent low reviews that give more than a single sentence for their reasoning. It's too bad those fools can't appreciate this movie for how good it is. Slow and tense is how horror should be, and subverting expectations from a fast paced cowboy action movie is why is works so well.",1496793600,5,1169,4.679611650485437
7399016,5,B014HDTT84,"I think some were overly critical for the violence.  The violence was very realistic.  I won't say much about the plot except the characters are some small town settlers in the mid 19th century who have contact with some ""savage"" Indians.  Kurt Russell is always a welcome addition as is Patrick Wilson.  The woman I though was Julia Styles is actually someone else.

It's not a perfect movie, but with only 5 stars you have to round.  I give it an 8.5 or so and rounded up cuz I liked it so much.",1496707200,2,497,4.290322580645161

Seems like Amazon gave the director TOTAL FREEDOM and that is a good thing.  Hollywood always seems to pull back and that never makes for a great film - too scared or worried about $$$ to actually go for it.

7399041,4,B014HDTT84,"An entertaining blend of western and horror, with probably about 80% of the screentime being western, and 20% being horror.  Much of the film feels like a traditional man-on-a-mission western, but the horror scenes, while limited, are quite intense and gory.  The plot is a solid B-movie tale, where an inbred clan of cannibal Indians, feared by the local tribes for centuries, attacks a village and kidnaps a man's wife.  The husband (Wilson), the sheriff (Russell), and old Indian fighter with an axe to grind (Fox), and an elderly deputy (Jenkins) go in pursuit and things get intense.  If you appreciate well-done pulp tales or B-movies, you'll probably like this.  Russell owns the screen as a middle-aged sheriff, the man can act.  Richard Jenkins also does a great job portraying a tired, grieving deputy who only has his job because he's friends with the sheriff, but is willing to do his best at it all-the-same.  The interplay between Jenkins and Russell gives depth to their characters you don't expect in this type of movie.  Wilson did well as a determined husband, though his character was a little one-note.  Fox's character is meant to be somewhat unlikeable, but still has some depth and even a spark of decency to him in the end.  Not a film for the squeamish, but still an entertaining blend of horror and western.",1494979200,11,1333,4.832599118942731

Every actor in this movie and every director responsible for it should be proud.  An absolute masterpiece.

The movie is savage.  I read one review that gave it a low rating.  The person claimed he/she loves westerns, but thought this movie was too savage.  Grow up, I say!  So, in other words he/she likes it when people get shot, but there's not blood, and they just conveniently fall to the ground peacefully dead.  Well, real killing isn't like that, and this film captures the true gore involved such affairs.

Basically, this movie does for westerns, what Saving Private Ryan did for war movies.  Saying you like westerns, but don't like this movie - because it's too gorey, is like saying you like war movies, but don't like ""Saving Private Ryan"" because the Omaha Beach scene is just too bloody!

Now, having said that ... this movie will stick with you.  Don't let your kids watch it.  There are scenes in this movie you will never forget, so if you can't stomach that level of gore, then - fine - don't watch it, but I think you should anyhow.  I think everyone should force themselves to watch it.  It reminds what you what it means to be human.  I'll let you ponder that thought.  ;)",1493769600,,1371,4.549180327868853

The acting way ok, but nothing that will stand out and last in ones mind like that of a ""Lonesome Dove"", or a ""Shane"". The emotional side of the characters in this film was only (narrowly developed). Hint: beyond the six-shooters, the emotional side and bonds of the characters is what makes a great western. And why Shane and Lonesome Dove are 2 of the best...This movie really dragged on in places and the list of ""stupidity"" the characters exhibited was startling. Who wrote this script? Four seasoned cowboys yet they make several obviously avoidable mistakes - the life and death kind. Not very realistic. The gore at the end was the most memorable moment. Not something which is really worth watching. There was some suspense at times, and maybe the dedication of the  husband was the only redeeming element of this film.

The abrupt ending makes you realize the film was never trying to tell a story or tie up any loose ends. The gore is purposeful and appropriate for the subject matter.  If you are going to use a weapon in a movie, have the integrity to show exactly what kind of damage it can do to a real person.

7399094,1,B014HDTT84,"Once upon a time, horror movies were supposed to be merely bone-chillingly frightening. But The Master changed that with ""Psycho"". (He got away with it because the Shower Scene is a work of genius (two geniuses, actually).) Nowadays, if a horror film doesn't induce vomiting, it's no good.

Craig Zahler apparently decided that a horror Western was just what the world needed (""Ravenous"" is the only other example I can think of), * and came up with ""Bone Tomahawk"". Besides having no discernible historical or mythological point, it suffers from two major problems. One is the perennially drab Kurt Russell. The other is Zahler's failure to understand pacing. The entire film is deliberate (and arguably mannered), to no point. Too many scenes run on too long (Zahler is in love with his admittedly smart dialog), and the ""chase"" sequence -- running nearly an hour -- is so devoid of tension or urgency, it's no surprise some viewers (myself included) nearly fall asleep.

Mr Zahler should study the first act of ""Die Walkure"", He'll learn a lot about directing.

You are warned. The horror scenes are indeed horrifying. The worst of these is ridiculously unbelievable, but not in a comic or cathartic way. Had I sat on the ratings board, I would likely have pressed for NC-17.

* Some of John Meston's ""Gunsmoke"" scripts are arguably horror stories, especially ""No Hands"".",1487635200,,1374,4.960869565217391

7399132,5,B014HDTT84,"This film is excellent for anyone who grew up with Westerns, but enjoys modern film elements. The majority of the film follows amazing western tropes like a ragtag group of men from different walks of life adventuring together towards a common goal. The dry humor of Westerns is definitely present throughout the entirety of the film with great lines like, ""I am far too vain to ever live as a cripple.""

The other part of the film has an uneasy horror feel that becomes cringeworthy at times. All in all, the film hits all the right notes to be a great western and a great horror film. If one starts this film with the feeling that they are watching a spaghetti western, they will likely not enjoy this film. It does deal with the true terrors of life out in the old west. Fear being a major hurdle for many. As a character says, stupidity of some being the hardest part of living out west.

Unrealistic for a man, with a leg mangeled as badly as his, to make a long journey like that over such tough terrain.  Not for the faint of heart.

7399332,3,B014HDTT84,"This movie is a strange one.  When it first starts out it is unique in its old western qualities, all of which have great detail and authenticity.  This includes the actors and their dialogue, set, buildings, location.  Next are the characters.  They are well done and interesting.  Strange, but interesting, almost endearing.  The story didn't seem to fit exactly but no harm, lets go along with it as I like the old west and these characters.  The story then unfolds and we have moral issues, leadership dynamics, struggle, pain, perseverance, etc.  Story continues good albeit slow but with purpose. I want to know what is going to happen and curious how they will succeed.  Then we get to the meat of the conflict, pun intended.  This is where things got very gory, violent and out of place.  The story was a let down at this point.  Unrealistic.  It pulled me out of what was good about this movie and into a grade B horror flick.  I finished regardless but was essentially disappointed.",1485388800,,992,4.691860465116279

7399352,2,B014HDTT84,"I'm not going to go into a lot of detail because there isn't a lot to talk about.  There wasn't much of a story, nor was it unpredictable.  The 'good'?  The cast.  For what appeared to be a fairly low-budget production (...not implying that is a negative), this must be where they spent their money.  The main cast was more than competent.  Kurt is always a solid performer and never disappoints (...not unlike Jeff Bridges!).  That is probably the only reason I gave it a watch....plus it has a decent title (which is very important, imo).

The 'bad':  There's two things in particular, I found distracting or downright annoying.  First, there's no music in the move...none whatsoever...as in no musical score.  While this isn't automatically a bad thing, I found it distracting because it is so uncommon in cinema, that I noticed it right away.  It could have been a stylistic choice (which I applaud if it somehow edifies the proceedings) or it could have been because the filmmakers couldn't afford it (haha).  Who knows!?  The other thing....the thing that just didn't make good sense, yet, seemed to be the centerpiece of the entire film....was the lame husband (yes, literally lame) who's wife is kidnapped by ""troglodytes"" and must be rescued - which is also the entire plot of the movie.

So, this guy, apparently has a broken leg - which is barely explained - and we (the viewers) have to watch this poor bastard hobbling around with ONE crutch, on a 5-day journey, pursuing his wife's kidnappers (the cavemen).  This is portrayed in excruciating detail - particularly after the posse's horses are stolen halfway through their journey and they have to walk the remaining miles.  Of course this was only minutes of the movie but I swear to the gods, it felt like I was watching this guy (and he was alone for much of it, so all attention was on him) crossing a desert in REAL TIME.  Yes, it was that painfully dull.

What was the significance of this?  Why did this character HAVE to have a broken leg?  I don't know!  I failed to see how the story was either changed or enhanced, as a result.  At any rate, I found it pointless and annoying.  They could have had the character doing more interesting activities, instead of scene after scene of him struggling and grimacing and falling down and crawling and on and on.  gd.

If you are a tremendous fan of Kurt Russell, you probably won't be disappointed.  However, I recommend ""Hateful Eight"" over this title - both of which came out around the same time.  The two characters and subsequent fates are eerily similar.  And I almost forgot to mention, the goofy song that you hear during the credits 'crawl' is probably the best thing about the movie.  The lyrics and the vocals are indeed unexpectedly humorous.",1485216000,2,2770,4.686721991701245

I think some of the negative ratings for this movie are because people failed to read that it is not a true western movie, it is a thriller/horror set in the time of a classic western. The film keeps you on edge and in suspense even during scenes shot in daylight. Though I enjoyed the movie and would recommend it to others who are interested in the thriller/horror genre, the ending felt quite rushed. There was significant and enjoyable buildup but it seemed to be wrapped up in 5 minutes which was quite disappointing.",1485129600,,657,4.6239316239316235

I will avoid any spoilers, but this is a must see. Even if you aren't interested in westerns this is still a must see. The story was great and it wasn't cheesy. Kurt Russell as a Sherriff was very fitting and the whole cast was amazing. Patrick Wilson was great as the husband who will go through hell and back to rescue his wife. Matthew Fox was great and had his moments where you couldn't tell whether he was a good guy but he has a defining moment. The Backup Deputy was a great character.

1. This might be one of those movies that is so bad, it's good, right? False. While I can appreciate the so bad it's good type of movie, this just left me sad.

2. Kurt Russell is in this, so it HAS to be good, right? I mean he was in Big Trouble in Little China after all...  False. Even the great Kurt Russell could not save this film.

3. At least I'll find out what the heck a 'Bone Tomahawk' is, right? False. That's what I thought too, but I'm still vague on the topic.

4. I'm in the mood for a Western.  False - You are thinking, how can I say false to an emphatic statement? Trust me. False.

5. At least we'll get to hear some great slasher / horror film music and composition, right? False. This is a strange one, as that would be the low hanging fruit of the genre, but this music is almost completely devoid of ambient sounds or a soundtrack.

The believe that a christian (deliberately misspelled to prevent capitalization of the word) god always delivers followers from harm is in every story ever told. In real life this is rarely true. This is why people creatively justify tragedy and death. The U.S. government slaughtered innocent women and children in their christian god's name and it said, spoken through the corrupt humans running it, that it was justified.",1484006400,,561,5.2444444444444445

Bad acting, dialogue, script, pace, length, premise. The supporting actors are forgettable. Spoiler alert: The last minute is preposterous. After being rescued, the damsel requests a kiss from her hero while still running away through the wilderness. Instead of a more realistic reaction of horror referencing decades of psychotherapy to follow. Finally, if cannibals ever lock me in a cage to eat me later, I will immediately kill myself, not wait to be rescued. Zero stars.",1484006400,,610,5.11

It seems as if they (the production/directing crew) started with the end as the idea and built it out to the beginning from there. The characters were bland and unimpressive and even with all of the dialogue, we never had a chance to understand or feel for them. We are avid western genre lovers here. We feel like we need our 2 hours and 12 minutes back after watching this.",1484006400,,479,4.393258426966292

Other observations: Patrick Wilson acting either petulant, pious, or physically pained was boring, a below average performance, and Matthew Fox's character was odd.  Most strange was the levity among the group of ""buddies"" as they make their trek.  They should've been more scared because that is some freaky stuff at the end.",1483401600,,531,4.866666666666666

The story has a crew of ""western"" town folk retaliating against a perceived enemy that is unknown, even by the token town Native American, and must be brought to justice and eliminated. This is a movie that treats the ""other"" as an assumed threat without regard for the difference expressed throughout all cultures of humanity. Gratuitous acts of violence do not convince a public of moral outcomes, but rather exhibit a lack of respect and understanding of difference that exist throughout a world of cultures and practices that are not based in Christianity.  This is a plot with a shallow story line that presents an enemy as an alien who is not of the earth, without regard for humanity, and who is completely foreign as a biological being (not unlike a harmful bacterium or virus).

It wasn't how hard indians drove a tomahawk into flesh.  It was actually never mentioned in the entire movie. The only hint was watching other characters using a tomahawk made of bone late in the story.  That's all I'll say except that I thought this movie was really good. Unusual. The story was great. The acting was too.  And the filming was super.  So, if you want a good and intense movie to watch, ignore any bone - headed bad ratings. I have no idea what those ratings are about.  This one was good. It had elements that reminded me a little of The Descent.  Some real horror. Yet a real western too.  I had fun watching this movie.  And I'm glad I own it on blu ray.

I'm sorry, but just for one example, if a person has been kidnapped and held in a cave for several days by bizarre inhuman cannibalistic savages who don't even have a language but instead perform some sort of bizarre surgery on their vocal cords in order to make horrific sounds (the overt PC move to make us root for the white guys and not feel bad about them slaughtering indians btw), and, rather than being severely traumatized by an experience beyond most people's worst nightmares, she is almost casually conversant enough when her would-be rescuers arrive to insult them for being stupid in their tactics, well, I'm out at that point. I really tried. I hung in there for a while.  But this movie went full on stupid at that point and had nothing really to redeem it in terms of earlier character development, cinematography, acting, scriptwriting...nope.  Two stars are for being a western and I want hollywood types to keep trying as I love westerns when they're good; otherwise, it would have been one star.

Richard Jenkins is always very good, Patrick Wilson is always very good. I am not as familiar with Matthew Fox, but he was very effective, as well. Zahn McLarnon was terribly underused, though, and he was not a main character in the story anyway. I just like him. He is superb in Longmire and Fargo. A horror influenced Western that never quite got over the improbability of its antagonists. Be that as it may, the acting was spot on, the mood was really ominous and I was caught up in the climactic scenes. Though the denouement felt a tad empty because I began to wonder about plausibility of the situation itself. If I tell too much about the antagonists, it may spoil the story. Their mysterious nature is both a plus in the film as well as a drawback.  These bad guys are definitely creepy and interesting. A really were a scary bunch. There was very little information about them outside of the fact that they were not civilized, or moral. Where they came from and what might influence them was never articulated, which made them seem implausible to me. I am nitpicking a touch, but the lack of detail about the antagonists, while supporting the horror aspects (what are they, how far will they go, will they be defeated!!??) it kept me a little outside of  the action. However, the Western setting, the genre crossover, and the acting were well put together, very well done.  All in all, a good movie.",1482710400,,1515,4.538461538461538

7400177,5,B014HDTT84,"From the beginning you know real bad things are going to happen.  Stumbling into an Indian graveyard results in bad things.  We've all seen it in western movies.  Stumble into an Indian troglodyte graveyard, see your buddy get slaughtered, travel on foot for a week, get shot by the sheriff in a small frontier town and get thrown in jail is nothing compared to getting eaten by Indian troglodytes who followed and kidnapped him, as well as taking the local female doctor who was tending to his wounds, and the deputy.  The doctor's husband with a broken leg, the sheriff, his over the hill deputy, and a self professed Indian killer were the posse that went to save the doctor and deputy.  Half of the movie was their multi-day trek to rescue these people with the kind of talk you might expect from a frontier cowboy, a gunslinger, and sheriff and his aging deputy on a camping trip with a mission such as this.  One such conversation was when they were bedding down for the night and the deputy asked the sheriff if he ever reads while taking a bath.  The sheriff takes his time to formulate and answer and says he doesn't read in the bathtub.  The deputy says he tried it a few times but the book gets wet from his fingers turning the pages and sometimes he drops it in the water and ruins the book.  After a rather lengthy pause, the sheriff suggests he get a music stand to put the book on, close to the tub.  You can order one from the local store if they don't have one.  You should have a towel on the side of the tub to dry your fingers to turn the pages.  This was a satisfactory solution for the deputy and they went to sleep.  That whole camping trip was filled with little quips like that mixed with the kind of conversation you might expect from a mix of people like that.  It was slow paced for a number of reasons.  For one, it turned out to be an interesting character study, a genre seldom used in modern movies because of the time it takes for proper character development.  Two, it gave a sense of authenticity.  These are small town frontier folks who never experience anything more raucous than rowdy cowboys or the occasional drifter, who the sheriff shoots in the leg if they try to get away, which seems to be what the lady doctor fixes most.  Three, this slow pace sets you up for the extreme horror these guys get to experience that they are totally unprepared for.  It lulls you into a sense that these guys might actually have a chance to kills some Indians and save the girl.  You, as the audience, know better because you saw lots of horror movies and you know what Jason or Leatherface can do.  Let me tell ya, Jason is a punk compared to these Indian troglodytes and they'd have Leatherface for dinner, literally.  I mean, these guys walk into a real horror show they never expected.  The execution scene is particularly cringe-worthy and forced me to reevaluate my least favorite way to die.  I gave it five stars because it felt like Zane Grey on some really bad acid.",1482192000,2,3004,4.41016333938294
7400178,5,B014HDTT84,Excellent haunting horror western movie.  It will keep you interested until the very end.  Kurt Russell is as great as always.

Only thing I didn't like was the cannibal indians which sort of put a sci-fi spin on this movie for me. Still, it gave them a mission and the outcome really surprised me. Good movie overall.

7400264,1,B014HDTT84,"Horrible movie & not just the near ending killed it, pardon the pun, but there was no need to be so descriptive on that cave activity from the Ghouls, without giving too much away.  And after the deed was done, the others went about talking about the weather as if not even disturbed by it (but of course, cause it is just a movie....lol).  Anyway, many parts were so boring and slow - how much time do you have to show someone walking across the desert terrain?  And, Ms. Simmons? (from Banshee), come on, give that top actress some parts where she does not have to get naked or fondled, huh?

7400309,5,B014HDTT84,"I thoroughly enjoyed it!  I hold a BS in Physical Anthropology, which may explain why I really like movies that explore the idea of what happens when you have an isolated human population that heads off on a different evolutionary trajectory.  Other movies that looked at this were The Descent and Pandorum.  It does require some suspension of disbelief as the time scale for evolutionary change is really much longer than would have to be the case in this movie or The Descent (understanding the migration patterns into the new world occured only around 15,000 years ago).  Pandorum does cleverly account for rapid evolution and for that it is definitely my favorite (I won't spoil it for you).  Nevertheless, this is a very respectable addition to this sub-genre and worth a watch if you aren't opposed to a small amount of pretty explicit gore.
NB - Kurt Russell was great.  I suspect after The Hateful Eight and now this he will be a fixture in modern westerns for years to come.",1481587200,,983,4.719298245614035

After the opening of the movie, which by the way is the best five minutes of the film, the pace is excruciatingly slow. This film would have made  a bad 30 minute TV series episode, but because the public and the critics must love to have plenty of garbage hurled at their eyeballs simply because "" we like Kurt Russell"" this sad tale went on and on. Lili Simmons performance was dreadful, but to be fair she and her fellow actors had to regurgitate the dialog written by S. Craig Zahler who also directed this film. To drag this film into a toilet a big as the wild west itself  we get to meet the ""troglodytes"" who are the villains in this train wreck. So Sci-fi meets western?...try again.

I have to say, however, that I feel like an actor of Kurt Russell's talent is wasted on this film. Without giving away too much of the plot, there are too many wildly unrealistic events, unexplained details, and minor plot lines going absolutely nowhere. Most characters are profoundly one-dimensional and development is weak at best. If all you're looking for is a few cheap thrills and some gratuitous violence/gore, Bone Tomahawk should get the job done.

7400526,3,B014HDTT84,Should appeal to Tarantino fans. The dialogue is quirky and memorable with the always reliable Kurt Russell as sheriff of a western outpost.

The main cast (Kurt Russell, Richard Jenkins, Matthew Fox, Patrick Wilson) was very good and even though the storyline was a little predictable, there was enough dialogue and action to keep the story moving along. The relationship between the sheriff Franklin Hunt (Russell) and his 2nd part-time deputy Chicory (Richard Jenkins), a widower, provided some levity. Warning there is graphic violence in the movie, so not one for the kiddos.",1479168000,,551,4.75

7400578,4,B014HDTT84,"No time for a lengthy review now, but  I found this movie to be an interesting commentary about  life (and death) in the history of the American west.  Much of the script and talented acting was devoted to the enchanting dialogue between people at different levels of the hierarchy of a small town in the old west, and, particularly, the struggles of a small party of four men who form a rescue party for victims of an Indian raid and kidnapping.  BUT, make no mistake, if a potential viewer is at all sensitive about seeing human brutality and body mutilation, DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE.  This is not a western filmed in the tradition of a classic John Wayne or similar family movie.  The journey taken by the four heroes who strive to rescue the helpless victims leads them to a prehistoric savage commune where animal-like humans intimidate, torture and consume their prisoners; and the film depicts much of these activities in gruesome detail.  The story is actually believable, but shows a side of man's transition from wild beasts to civilized souls that most
people today would not care to think about.",1478908800,,1107,4.734375

The premise of cannibal native tribes that kidnap people in the night from towns is just weird.

That turns a lot of people off, but I find it refreshing in the context of movies like Dances With Wolves. Indians weren't all the same.

7400617,5,B014HDTT84,"Hollywood regurgitates the same tropes year after year with dazzling special effects, car chases, and explosions. There are many Indie films which promise much, but are not big screen fare and often disappointing. Most movies I have seen over the years are easily forgettable. Perhaps it is true that Hollywood is more concerned with churning out product for the lucrative international market.
On rare occasion there is a project shot outside the ""system"" on a shoestring budget that TRULY DELIVERS. Because Kurt Russell believed in the director, he was able to deliver a stellar performance in a really good albeit haunting movie. Bone Tomahawk has exceptional production value. The dialogue fits the characters and the period. This movie is proof positive that it doesn't take a gazillion dollars to make an entertaining and provocative film. It may disturb some viewers as there is a horror element, but not in the Freddy Kruger or Jason vein that launched so many weak franchises.
I am trying to wrap my head around the negative reviews for Bone Tomahawk and came up with a list of objections,
1) perhaps westerns are not for everybody
2) maybe an intriguing plot and period accurate characterization are not to some people's liking
3) realism and violence are not everyone's cup of tea
4) the viewing public is jaded by the Marvel Universe
5) America is becoming a nation of juvenile sheep unable to accept originality
Whatever a person's reservation, Bone Tomahawk is a cut above normal Hollywood fare. Thank you Amazon for making this a Prime offering. I just hope Zahler gets to make another movie, I would go see it in a heartbeat.
A word of caution:
My older brother let me tag along to the drive-in to see the b&w version of Night of the Living Dead, which gave me nightmares for the next decade. S. Craig Zahler could leave a similar indelible impression as George Romero, so I would caution against consumption by younger viewers.",1478563200,,1944,4.876132930513595

7400743,4,B014HDTT84,I don't watch a lot of movies but my wife and I sat down to watch this one the other night. I picked it for being a western and having Kurt Russell in it. It had a lot of hand held camera work that makes you seem like you are there. A little different to me. I thought they exaggerated some of the sounds such as horses galloping. It made me want to duck for cover. Turned out to be a different kind of western I wasn't expecting. Actually a pleasant surprise.,1477267200,,460,4.010869565217392
7400744,4,B014HDTT84,"While I tend to hate gore -- this movie truly kept me captivated because of the real-life-like dialogs between each characters -- I almost felt like I was eavesdropping a ""real situation"" - loved their colorful language ""I'll slap you red!"" quoted from the sheriff (Kurt Russell) who did real well considering that he wasn't too set in his typical 80's movies he made. I couldn't trace any hints of Kurt Russell - I really saw just the ""sheriff"".  I thought the ending would be tragic but (spoiler alert) it was a relief that it actually had a good ending but I wished it lasted a little longer.  There were few surprises as I'm usually really good at predicting what happens to each characters but I was thrown off a few time which is refreshing. So well done to the director/writer.",1477267200,,784,4.553191489361702

7400750,1,B014HDTT84,"This movie sounded like something I would absolutely love. I love westerns, and you can't go wrong with Kurt Russell. However, this was a tough one to enjoy. It's 2 hours and 12 minutes long, and the build up to the final scene is sooooo slow. When they finally get to the final showdown, it's not very climactic, and it all just kinda ends. It felt like a 2 hour build for 12 minutes. Some people like this because it's different and some enjoy the slow build. I'm more of a Tombstone man. I like my westerns full of action and just enough suspense to take it home.",1477267200,,566,4.25

I found it refreshing next to the now common high-octain-ADHD-edited shallow format of most movies in this genre today. I was surprised by the the impact of this story and still remain haunted. I agree it is not for the faint of heart. The gruesome nature of one scene made ""The Walking Dead"" look tame. I have been a fan of horror since the early 1970s and this was the first time I actually gagged. I don't, however, consider this violence gratuitous much in the same way with the Walking Dead. It succeeds in grabbing your empathy by the throat and reminding you how extremely outraged to feel the next time you hear of a beheading in the news.

7400928,3,B014HDTT84,"I'm trying to avoid spoilers here so I'll sum it up by saying Bone Tomahawk does start with quite a bit of early intrigue which pulls you in for the first quarter of the movie. The middle half of the movie, however, is painfully dragged out.  The early intrigue is completely spent as the heroes travel a dull and predictable journey to their final conflict. Any suspense during their travels seems forced and unconvincing.  It left my wife and I, die hard fans of the Western genre, checking the clock wondering when they were going to wrap things up.  The movie ends with a fairly brutal and disgusting climax for our protagonists. We found ourselves wanting to care for the survivors, but those that did were some of the least inspiring characters throughout the movie.  Would not watch it again, and we rewatch many Westerns.  If you are into the genre, it may be worth giving it a try.  Otherwise, I think you may be disappointed.",1475971200,2,935,4.602409638554217

7401026,4,B014HDTT84,"This is a unique film that kept me drawn in the whole way through.  My wife agreed that it was slow, but it was compelling nonetheless.  It's kind of a western, kind of a horror film, kind of a journey film--not exactly any of these but with elements of all of them that when put together almost is like a stage play.  Yes, there is a lot of dialogue--often very simple day to day talk--but that was something I liked.  The dialogue is often smart, witty, and something that made me think.  The actors deliver well on all accounts.

If you're looking for action or gore, you'll get small doses but probably not enough to satisfy the hard core fans of those genres.  This is a more cerebral film that provides insight into the characters and the nature of the pioneer stock that forged the United States of America.  What we get is just basically regular folk in a harsh land where often not much of note happens, but when bad things come upon them they just had to deal with things the best they can.

This is a great commentary on the spirit of the American West with a talk softly and carry a stick--a big one if you have it--but anything you got will do.  Patient western fans should find this film at least moderately enjoyable.  This is a film that will stick with me for a while.",1475280000,,1285,4.3125

I found ""Bone Tomahawk"" riveting and thoroughly entertaining despite the cannibal savages element that is sometimes hard to watch.  I'm so glad this movie was even made, and the fact that it is so well put together is a nice bonus.  I watched it two nights in a row (something I rarely do), and it is not Kurt Russell's worst movie (not by a long shot!)

I love westerns and horror films.  Writer-director S. Craig Zahler did a marvelous job of fusing the two genres into one strapping and gripping film filled with memorable characters, noteworthy performances, and a story that I won't soon forget.",1474761600,,689,4.708333333333333

The humor in this film is priceless and the acting is great. It was nothing that I was expecting and I couldn't have loved it more. There isn't much violence in the movie, but when it happens it is BRUTAL! I'm serious, if you are at all disturbed by violence then beware. The violence is hardcore and the cannibals are scary! This movie has everything as far as I'm concerned. Great writing, great actors, great character development, great story, and great horror elements. I will be watching this movie over and over again for sure. Maybe my sense of humor is twisted, but I love, love, loved it. To get a sense of what you're in for, there is a scene near the end where a few of the characters have been taken captive by the cannibal tribe, and one of them starts talking about a flea circus that came through town and whether or not it was real or a scam.

I guess I wonder how people fail to recognize great acting, authentic sets and costumes, terrific musical scores and an original story-line, all of which Bone Tomahawk has in spades. Maybe others aren't as critical as I am, especially when it comes to Westerns set in the 1800s. Maybe others don't appreciate how rare it is for a director and producers to pay attention to so many fine details...and get them right.
As good as I think Bone Tomahawk comes off, it does come with a distinct gore-warning in one scene. You may have to look away. One of the characters is split in two pieces by cannibles while he is still alive. I'm pretty hardened off to gore but had to squeeze my eyes shut during that sequence and wish it had been left on the cutting room floor during editing.

Was that supposed to be an allegory for women? Was the cannibalism suppose to be an allegory for veganism? So many questions left unanswered.

IGN says this film has ""great dialogue, strong characters, and imaginative and memorable kills."" Cannibals kidnap some homesteaders and the local sheriff does not like that at all! You guessed it! It turns into a very violent feud that will please the inner animal in all of us. Stars from Tombstone, Lost, Hateful Eight, Insidious, and Cabin in the Woods are all featured in this star-studded brutality fest! This movie is rated 13+ for violence, meaning about PG-13 to R.

There are a few shock factors for those looking for that sort of thing, but that is about all that will get your attention in this film.  Kurt's experience as an actor makes this film feel like it could have been good but its not that great when you look at the supporting cast.  Overall I give it 2 stars only b/c it checks two boxes for me- ""Western"" and ""Kurt Russell"".  That is is!  I only recommend if you have nothing else to watch.",1472947200,,705,4.17037037037037

It was a very well written, directed and the actors were spot on. I agree with previous reviews that the middle 1/3 was a little slow but it was to take time to develop the characters. You get back story that allows you to warm up to those who weren't the most likable or at least understand why they are like the are.

7401596,5,B014HDTT84,"If I had to use one word to describe the film, Bone Tomahawk, it would be rare. Few films have the ability to make you think about them days after viewing. Even fewer have the ability to successful blend genres in the way this one did. The more I thought about it later, the more I appreciated what the filmmakers were attempting to accomplish. The number one criticism many people have today of Hollywood is a lack of originality and fresh ideas. This film appears to start out as a typical Western, but changes into something else. Many reviewers have called it a Western/Horror, yet I don't believe the intention was to simply shock or terrify viewers in a gratuitous way. This film took several familiar forms to structure itself, yet ended up creating something entirely unique. I loved that about it.
This film also made me go back and analyze the details in it. The dialogue should be textbook for anyone who wants to understand how to best use it. There are very few wasted lines, and the cast could not have been better. Kurt Russell is great in almost everything, and this is no exception. The cast is portrayed in a way that perfectly balances the group and adds a sense of realism to what you're watching. The emotional connections are spot on. The rancher's blind determination to seek out his wife, who represents his entire world. The small town sheriff who approaches his tasks with equal measure of pragmatism and grit. The simple minded back-up deputy who blissfully finds purpose in his duty and everyday insights. The bachelor gunslinger who is devoid of emotional bonds due to a lifetime of empty vengeance. When the actions and dialogue of the characters remains as true as in this film, it makes for seamless storytelling.
I would be remiss if I did not mention the violence in the film. It certainly sets it apart from both Westerns and Horror movies. Westerns are never this honest with violence and horror movies are never so precise. I found this combination to be hugely effective. We are set up for a Western movie and would never expect the level of violence which occurs in the final third of the film. The characters in the story who lived their lives in the peaceful town of 'Bright Hope' would never expect to have to endure what they end up witnessing. This is why it was so much more effective to me. The western frontier was not some idyllic, picturesque wilderness speckled with quaint wooden towns. Most people died in the spaces between those towns attempting to cross a dangerous, unpredictable, and unforgiving landscape. The Troglobytes were a personification of this realistic savagery, which made them all the more horrific and impactful.
If you enjoy realistic movies which live a bit outside the box, Bone Tomahawk is worth the watch.",1471478400,2,2781,4.74793388429752

That definitely got my attention (I remarked to myself, ""Geezus"" at one scene) even though the violence typical in movies these days do not bother me too much.

The actors were good and that's what drew me in. Kurt Russell in a western type movie.

7401677,3,B014HDTT84,Started off as an interesting western but ended the last thirty minutes with some mind numbing graphic violence that is hard to remove from my memory. My own fault- it was listed as a western/horror/cannibal movie but Kurt Russel's other ventures into westerns have been so good I gave it a shot and while he played his part well I would have passed on the movie if I really understood how graphic the cannibalistic scenes were going to be.,1470873600,,440,4.582278481012659

Unfortunately, despite a bit of a departure from the normal Western tropes, the story is still pretty predictable.

If you don't like movies that deliberately take viewers into deep water, challenging them with a Neo-Western-Horror that tosses no lines or floatation devices, forcing them to swim... don't watch it. If you didn't like it, fine. But these barely literate 'reviews' with less than 50 words don't help anyone. If you can't throw together a couple paragraphs to explain your rating, what you liked or disliked -- don't bother posting at all. Ignore that 3.2 out of 5.0 Star rating. The problem with customer rating systems like this is that any dolt can chime in with a 1-star review after the first 15-minutes.*(See Footnotes)]

Those poor, unfairly maligned troglodytes. Think of all the famous and influential Troglodytes that have shaped our world. Hmmm. I guess Bin Laden counts... and Saddam Hussein spent some productive months in a 'spider hole', which is a respectably troglodytic abode. Good enough; I guess my point is made. But even if this film is clearly troglophobic, it's too awesome to boycott... or even dock it a star. I love dark, twisted Westerns with profoundly existential moments. 'Blood Meridian' is my favorite novel; 'Unforgiven' and 'True Grit' and 'No Country For Old Men' are the films I'll list if you ask for my top 3. That doesn't happen often enough though, so I come to Amazon and write reviews. It's sad, no? No? Not really, no. 'Bone Tomahawk' is the directorial debut of novelist, screenwriter and musician S. Craig Zahler, but I knew he had a proclivity for telling very grim 'n' grisly stories from unusual perspectives, some of them set in the American West of the 19th century. So I knew this would be my kind of film, and fairly sure he'd pull it off, based on the strength of 'Asylum Blackout' a criminally over-looked film, and the first of Zahler's many optioned screenplays to make it to the big screen. Not many people watched 'AB', and almost no one gave it the credit it deserved.

The slow-burning tension and sense of foreboding that builds throughout the first two acts had my guts starting to knot up with legitimate anxiety. It's a sign of the writer-director's skill and confidence that he chose to discard the Western and Horror clichs that make audiences comfortable; he tossed out the 'ready-to-pour' character molds, and ignored the boring three-act formulas that are encouraged in film-school, the cinematic equivalent of comfort food... or a full-frontal lobotomy. The writing is deep and subtle, with smart, realistic dialogue, and the cinematography captures the stark, somber grandeur of the landscape; it's a place of empty beauty, where atrocities happen in the light of day. and dry riverbeds become streams of blood.

Then there's the soundtrack: absolutely perfect, weighed down with an ominous tension that builds gradually to an intense crescendo. The pieces lock together, and the seams disappear, combining to make an artistic vision in the same class as Nicolas Winding Rifn's 'Valhalla Rising' or Gaspar Noe's 'Irreversible'. The classic Western clichs start unravelling immediately, leaving viewers in Terra Incognita.
The film announces its dark intentions in the opening scene, with two murderous thieves finishing off their prey. They get distracted by an unsettling noise, an eerie mix of scream and whistle that they try to follow, stumbling into a tribal gravesite unlike any Native American rituals the surprisingly knowledgeable elder man has seen. It's closer to Paleolithic, a cultural anomaly**(See Footnotes). After the elder thief is killed, the younger man, played by David Arquette, flees for the closest town. Having poisoned sacred ground with his presence, he brings a special kind of hell to this little town with him.

Sheriff Franklin Hunt -- a flawless performance by Kurt Russell -- knows there's something wrong and sick about the thief as soon as he lays eyes on him. After a couple friendly questions, the interrogation becomes a shooting, and they uncover the stolen property he was seen trying to hide, in a hasty burial just outside the town limits. That night, while the Sheriff is home, something about the thief's arrival nagging at him, the Paleolithic nightmares who followed the interloper into town brazenly and silently strike. They butcher a stable-boy, and take Purvis the desecrator-thief, Deputy Nick, and Samantha O'Dwyer as captives... and livestock.

When Sherriff Hunt sets out to recover the taken captives, he is joined by his likable, dependable, but somewhat addle-brained Deputy, Chickory; Richard Jenkins invests the character with a comic charm that helps offset some of the relentlessly grim atmosphere. The missing woman's husband, Arthur O'Dwyer (played by the very busy Patrick Wilson, who is excellent), is determined to join the search party as well, despite a broken leg. Matthew Fox is excellent as John Brooder, an enigmatic combination of surface confidence and impressive shooting abilities, but who hides inner doubts and uncertainties that the actor conveys with the slightest of gestures and tones. His motivations are a mystery to characters and audience alike, but he seems to be compelled to prove himself. The well-mannered but arrogant gunslinger joins the under-manned posse, even when the Sheriff's Native American scout refuses to do anything beyond point out their destination on a map... and warn them they'll never return. They aren't Indians. They're an evolutionary offshoot of humanity, cave-dwelling Troglodytes with weapons of stone and bone, who butcher their human cousins like livestock. But macho pride being what it is and was, they're not about to be deterred by savages with rocks. Things start going wrong early on, with bandits, internal conflict, and the frantic husband's leg getting worse every second he's on the saddle. The subtle details and realistic dialogue, combined with the restrained foreboding of the soundtrack, all suggest that things will not go well. There will be no miracles, no lucky breaks to count on for salvation.

Just how bad it gets when they reach the land of the troglodytes, however, was impossible to imagine, though the title kept repeating itself in my head. That titular bone tomahawk does get to play its gory part, in one of the most authentically horrifying and intense third acts in recent memory. I love the clichd Westerns of old, and the dark revisionist Western films of the Coen Brothers, and Quentin Tarantino. But I consider 'Bone Tomahawk' to be one of the best films of the last decade, a thoroughly brilliant debut from an important new talent. Zahler has created a profoundly disturbing masterpiece that fuses Western and Horror genres without succumbing to the clichd tropes of either. But it's not for everyone, and if cinematic violence bothers you, stay far away. I loved the 'Hateful Eight', so I won't bother saying that 'Bone Tomahawk' is superior; both movies had me dwelling on them for days. It is superior to 'The Burrowers', however, another Western-Horror fusion with a plot virtually identical to 'Bone Tomahawk'... Hollywood's full of copycats, and I think Zahler's script ended up in the hands of the writer-director of 'The Burrowers' at some point, since it was written several years ago. Or maybe not. It's actually quite different in a lot of ways, and I loved it. It's just not the same species of awesome that 'Bone Tomahawk' belongs to.

FOOTNOTES:
*(From Wikipedia: 'Bone Tomahawk received critical acclaim by critics and at festivals for its acting (particularly for Kurt Russell, Richard Jenkins and Matthew Fox), realism, Zahler's direction, and the dialogue of his screenplay. Film review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 89% of critics gave the film a ""Certified Fresh"" rating, based on 71 reviews with an average score of 7.1/10, with the site's consensus stating, ""Bone Tomahawk's peculiar genre blend won't be for everyone, but its gripping performances and a slow-burning story should satisfy those in search of something different."" [15] Metacritic, another review aggregator, assigned the film a weighted average score of 72 (out of 100) based on 17 reviews from mainstream critics, considered to be ""generally favorable"".'
ALSO: Bone Tomahawk was a festival and Award show hit: it was nominated for 2 'Independent Spirit Awards', one for Zahler and Best Screenplay, one for Richard Jenkins for Best Supporting Actor; Kurt Russell won the 'Fangoria Award' for Best Actor, Jenkins was nominated again in the same category, and Hugo Villasenor was nominated for Best Makeup/FX.
Most impressive, perhaps: at the Sitges Awards (From Wikipedia: 'The Sitges Film Festival (Catalan: Festival Internacional de Cinema Fantstic de Catalunya) is a Spanish film festival and is one of the most recognizable film festivals held in Europe. It is considered the world's foremost international festival specializing in fantasy and horror films.'), Zahler won for 'Best Director', and the film itself won the prestigious 'Jos Luis Guarner' Prize for Best Picture, chosen by the Catalan Association of Film Critics and Writers.)

Everything else about this film is superb. A western that amazingly contains many contradictions: a throwback to cliche (and offensive to some) to cowboys vs indians, but also highly original, terribly brutal, but also surprisingly sensitive, an adventure story, a buddy picture, a horror film, character-driven, plot-driven, loudly sadistic, but insidiously subtle. It's all of these things. I was beyond pleasantly surprised. This is not only one of the best westerns I've ever seen, but one of the best films.

Knowing that he would be in THE HATEFUL EIGHT I realized that it would be a violent, blood soaked western and wasn't surprised with the final result.

BONE TOMAHAWK takes a cliche premise and takes it to implausible levels of violence.  It was almost like watching a slasher flick.

At least with the Tarantino film you knew there would be the same elements as  in all his cinematic efforts.  The violence is almost cartoonish.

BONE is a waste of good talent(Kurt) and time(mine).

7402315,4,B014HDTT84,"Fans of ""spaghetti westerns"" and Italian cannibal films a la Rugerro Deodato (remember 1980's ""Cannibal Holocaust,"" the self-proclaimed most controversial film ever?) will be intrigued by this mash-up of two seemingly disparate genres. Clearly influenced by John Ford's classic 1954 western ""The Searchers,"" Kurt Russell's crusty yet polite character, Sheriff Hunt, leads an ad hoc posse of western-film stereotypes including an old duffer deputy, Chickory (Richard Jenkins), a dandy gunslinger (Matthew Fox) and a hapless cowboy foreman with a broken leg, Arthur (Patrick Wilson) whose wife, a young doctor names Samantha (Lili Simmons) has been kidnapped by a band  of ""troglodytes"" along with Deputy Nick (Evan Jonigkeit) and a wounded, suspicious drifter named Purvis (David Arquette).  Much of the film is dedicated to the arduous journey west these four men must take to find the missing trio, an aspect of the film that many viewers elsewhere have complained vociferously about, but in fact, it is this part of the film is probably the most important, providing the insights into the characters of each individual (yes, actual character development).  Once the lair of the mysterious cave dwellers is found, the film morphs into a gruesome cannibal drama strongly reminiscent of the above referenced Deodato gory schlock-fest, only here it is mud-slathered mutated giants with bone inserts in their vocal chords to allow them to produce a bone-chilling, bestial roar that eat people instead of mud-slathered Amazonian Indians without bone inserts who eat people.  The transition is sudden and shocking, particularly the over-the-top fate of poor Deputy Nick in his preparation for dinner (with him as the main course).  Again, like Deodato, no graphic detail of the torture, scalping, or human bisection is spared, but in spite of the horror, it seems less gratuitous, almost being done with a wink and a nod to a genre of Italian cinema in the early 1980s that most typical viewers of Westerns might be completely unaware of, which I believe is the whole point.

It is clear that the budget for this film was virtually non-existent (one source quoted under $2 million), and must have been a labor of love for actors of Russell's and Jenkin's caliber.  In fact, it is these two actors' skill at their craft that holds the film together.  Russell returns to a type of role he has not tasted since ""Tombstone"" and it is prescient of that of the bounty hunter he plays in Quentin Tarantino's ""The Hateful Eight"" which was released not long after ""Bone Tomahawk.""  David Arquette is appropriately slimy as Purvis, as is Sid Haig as ""Buddy"",  the latter being the first to taste the wrath of the ""troglodytes"" at the film's beginning.

One interesting aspect of this film is its political correctness regarding the subject of the ""savages"" portrayed in this film that in earlier, less culturally conscious times would have been relegated to a particularly naughty group of Indians. However, we are told with great authority that the cannibals are not Native Americans by the only educated man in the small Texas town of Bright Hope (the small town where this saga unfolds), a man who is referred to as ""the Professor,"" clearly a Native American himself who, after studying an arrow recovered from a stash of items hidden by Purvis, claims that the kidnappers are actually ""troglodytes"" (a term for cave dwellers derived from the Greek word for ""hole""), non-Indian mutants who have been eschewed by his people for millennia.  Bright Hope was clearly one of the most progressive social communities in the Wild West!

""Bone Tomahawk"" is one of those films people will either love for its quirky, dark-humored mash-up of low-budget Italian pulp Westerns (with a touch of John Ford)-meets-late 1980's-cannibal films, or hate it for its somewhat plodding pace and horrific ending with one particularly unsettling death scene (not for young children, please).  I liked this odd first-time writer/director S. Craig Zahler's twisted homage to two film genres that we would never expect to see intersect with one another.  One thing I would change about the film would be its locations ( it was clearly shot in the foothills north of Los Angeles where it would be cheapest), where ground supposedly unexplored has obviously been recently plowed and graded by heavy equipment (complete with spoil pile mounds evident).  A more appropriate and visually pleasing filming locale would have been in and around Red Rock Canyon State Park, only two hours north of Los Angeles; maybe it would not have been Monument Valley, but it would have provided a more convincing landscape.",1468540800,2,4663,5.11578947368421

Hilarity ensues as dice check rolls result in a critical failure over and over and over! The over the top gore and seriousness in which the characters portray themselves in this out of the ordinary fantasy western make this film fairly bizarre. I really wanted to like it, as I am quite a fan of Kurt Russell. However, the movie lacks a genuine plot and the characters are fairly static. The outrageous amount of gore is distracting and unbelievable. The actors gave it their best and delivered a good performance, but the bottom line is that the plot was predictable. Less of a ""Western,"" Leaning more towards the ""Horror"" genre. Watch it if you're bored, but don't expect much. Probably, not worth the time invested.",1468454400,,923,4.80503144654088

While this definitely was not your typical 'Western'...it was a largely entertaining feat.  With Kurt Russell, Jenkins, Wilson, and Fox...it's hard not to have a good movie.  The dialogue and script were great and made such by the actors.  I will say, having grown up in the days of classic horror movies like Friday the 13th, Halloween, Night of the Living Dead, Hellraiser, etc...the cannibalism cave scene left a mark like no other.  Someone commented that the gory scene didn't bring anything to the film...BS!  That scene alone capitalized the gravity of the situation they were all in and ensured the audience understood it as well.

I'm not really much into westerns, as I think they are often just the same old schtick, but this was a cool slow burn of a movie.",1467417600,,251,4.229166666666667
7402517,4,B014HDTT84,"Possible spoilers. I seemed to recall that when this movie first came out, there was an emphasis on cannibalism in the press. Well, there is but you can put away the emphasis. First time director, S. Craig Zahler, best known forwell nothing, has assembled a terrific cast, and in a period of 3 weeks created what feels like an authentic western set in the dusty Western United States (shot in California) at the turn of the 20th century.

Kurt Russell plays Sheriff Hunt, a man who has experienced a lot and has little regard for anyone who questions his authority. When he questions why a drifter (David Arquette) is in town, a disrespectful answer results in a bullet to the leg. You get the feeling he has found this effective in the past. Hunt asks for the services of Samantha (Lili Simmons) who appears to be the town nurse. Shes been busy tending to her husband, Arthur (Patrick Wilson), a cowboy who is on the mend from a broken leg.

The next morning the sheriff discovers that Samantha, the drifter and Deputy Nick (Evan Jonigkeit) are all missing. Based on some evidence left behind, it is determined by The Professor, the resident Native American (Zahn McClarnon, you might remember from TVs Fargo), that it is the work of a small, cannibalistic tribe of cave dwellers known as Troglodytes. The sheriff, with certainly a sense of guilt combined with job responsibility, is determined to rescue the kidnapped residents. Against his better judgement, Hunt allows Arthur to come along, bad leg and all. He is also accompanied by a former military officer and noted ""Killer named Brooder (Matthew Fox) and his back-up deputy, Chicory (Richard Jenkins).

Zahler, who also penned the script, fleshes out all of the characters, even some minor ones. Jenkins, in particular is at the top of his game. We especially get to known the quartet on the rescue mission. I couldn't help think that this life of constant hardship shaped the characters in the story. In fact, none would seem to be bad or evil. Even the racist, Brooder has his reasons which come out late in the film. The Troglodytes, with various bones protruding from their body and covered in a white mud are extremely fearsome and repellent. Yes, it seems that humans are high on their preferred dinner shopping list. But aside from some gory violence commonly seen on TV, there is only one scene that would qualify as a stomach turner.

I will also mention a couple of other unrecognizable cameos I missed until seeing the credits. Sean Young (Blade Runner) plays the domineering wife of the towns mayor. Michael Pare (Eddie and the Cruisers) plays a stable owner and businessman. Filmed on a budget of less than $2 million, the film has a place on a list of cult classics at the very least. An odd, violent and satisfying western. Highly recommended, but not for everyone.",1467331200,,2839,4.764227642276423

At any rate, Kurt Russell plays the law-man in the film, Sheriff Franklin of the quaint town on Bright Hope   where your moral and ""civilized"" people live. Things get going at a brisk pace when we have a band of cannibalistic savages enter the town at night and kidnap a prisoner, the deputy and theg wife of a gritty but injured townsman played by Patrick Wilson. The men form a search party to rescue the kidnapped victims and are on their way to rescue them.

A slow burn buildup is what makes the movie so effective and if you pay attention, there are significant clues along the way, in those ""boring"" parts, that deepen the pleasure of the experience. If you can't immediately recognize a great cult movie after having watched it with both eyes and a supposed brain, then you are cinematically hopeless. The acting is accomplished (and some of it is even great), the horror is nightmarish, the comedy is clever and the script is tight and well written and best of all, it's a surprise.

About 2 grisly scenes and not for the squeamish.  The making of helped me to deal with the director's vision.  This is not a feel good movie.  I urge ppl to think about it before viewing-you have been warned.  This was difficult even for me to watch.  Will I watch it again?....not for a long time.

The filmmakers were too concerned with breaking barriers in story telling that they forgot the most important rule-have a good story to tell. The plot line of innocents being taken away by savage/menacing types while an unlikely cast of characters chase after them has been done for generations.  George Miller thrived doing this in MAD MAX: FURY ROAD giving a genre busting film along with ""slow burns"" and highly empathetic characters. This film did not, but kudos to Kurt Russell, Richard Jenkins,  and Patrick Wilson for trying.",1465603200,,654,4.882882882882883

Kurt Russell is the perfect niche actor to play the part of the tough as nails town sheriff who is adamant on derailing from his word and lawful duties. He is paired up with Patrick Wilson, Richard Jenner and Matthew Fox on a suicide mission to rescue Wilson's wife in the barren hills of the west, who was earlier usurped along with the sheriffs deputy. Who would commit this unexpecting crime, you ask? Mountain cannibals!! Yes, this movie is an overly abundant mesh of the spaghetti western and horror genres with some great performances, time accurate dialogue and perfect intro to ending climatic build.. seeing Sid Haig and David Arquette in the opening scene indicated something good was stirring up and the camera definitely delivered an ominous cloud of suspense midway through the film",1465603200,3,836,4.853146853146853

7402951,3,B014HDTT84,"Bone Tomahawk is an okay mixture of old-west shoot-'em-up and creepy horror that almost but doesn't quite succeed in its ambitious genre bending effort.
A prologue introduces a pair of murderous highwaymen (David Arquette, Sid Haig) who are confronted with an eerie, unseen threat after slaughtering and robbing a party of travelers. Cut to the sleepy frontier town of Bright Hope later that evening, where law and order is enforced by no-nonsense sheriff Kurt Russell and deputy/sidekicks Richard Jenkins and Evan Jonigkeit.
A report of a suspicious stranger in town (Arquette) seen burying something in the dark brings Russell and Jenkins to where the stranger was last seen, the local saloon, The Learned Goat. Still there, the stranger only gets dodgier under questioning by Russell and attempts to flee after it's revealed that he was burying stolen loot, causing Russell to shoot him in the leg. That brings out Lili Simmons, as a nurse and wife of local rancher Patrick Wilson. She is brought to the jail to repair Arquette while being guarded by Jonigkeit. Unfortunately, the same baddies Arquette encountered earlier have followed him to Bright Hope, where, overnight, they horribly murder a stable hand, steal some prized horses and carry off Jonigkeit, Arquette and Simmons for purposes that you don't even want to think about. In the morning Russell assembles an intrepid posse to bring them back consisting of Jenkins, Wilson, hobbled by a broken leg, and a dapper Indian fighter and gunslinger (Matthew Fox) who feels responsible for having brought out Simmons instead going to the trouble of rousing the drunk town doctor to attend to Arquette.
Suffice to say that they get much more than they bargained for once they catch up with their quarry.
The entertaining cast of veterans and newcomers is the main reason to see Bone Tomahawk. (Stay alert and you'll also spot Fred Melamed, Kathryn Morris, James Tolkan and Sean Young in brief cameo roles.) Debuting writer/director S. Craig Zahler has cooked up interesting characters for them to play and supplied them with tasty, authentic-sounding dialog to wrap their talents around. It would be enough to make you overlook the somewhat derivative plot--a sort of crossbreeding of The Searchers with The 13th Warrior--if Tomahawk didn't take over two hours to get to its tense and grisly climax. Instead, it tends to wander when it should barrel ahead while unfolding the kind of offbeat frontier yarn a Budd Boetticher or an Anthony Mann might have torn off in a brisk 85 minutes in their heyday.
Still, along with sounding great  (Stick around during the end credits for the creepy exit song co-written by Zahler and Jeff Herriott, who also performed it.), Tomahawk also looks great befitting Zahler's movie background as a cinematographer. As a result, Tomahawk may not be a great movie, but it's still pretty good, if definitely not for the squeamish.",1465084800,,2916,5.075

However, it is still a really good movie with the grit and feel of a western. Kurt Russell gives another great performance as a sheriff of a small town. It is rated R for the blood and death scenes for good reason. I highly recommend this movie for anyone that is a fan of westerns and a little bit of horror. It may seem as if it is moving slowly during the middle of the movie but please understand that this is the necessary build up for the climax of the movie.",1464652800,,609,3.959349593495935

7403229,4,B014HDTT84,"For being filmed in only 21 days, this was a fairly good movie. I really liked the backup deputy Chicory (Richard Jenkins) making his editorial comments and joking gestures. A long time Kurt Russel fan (he plays Sheriff Franklin Hunt) the movie flowed well and was eerie in parts, which kept my interest. I could've done without the sex scene between Arthur O'Dwyer (Patrick Wilson) and his wife/doctor's assistant, Samantha (Lili Simmons). Without giving anything away, something else you may want to be prepared for is a fairly grisly and graphic scene of Deputy Nick (Evan Jonigkeit) being slaughtered by the cannibals....very gruesome.
The one thing I found that detracted from the 'rescue' scene was how the lame Patrick Wilson reached the cave....I mean, the man could barely walk, he has a broken leg! Other than that, the characters were good and the plot was good. This movie was better than many 2+ hour movies I've seen, on a huge budget that took a year to film.....",1463961600,,978,4.862275449101796

This is the description given by the Amazon box. Now for mine....WOW! what a terrific combination of horror and suspense and a Western. I even have to say that even though I am not a fan of Patrick Wilson (personal reason) he did a great job as did Matthew Fox and Kurt Russell and Richard Jenkins.

So slow and such horrid cannibalistic mutilation / torture scenes.

7403471,2,B014HDTT84,"A forgettable gory Western, Bone Tomahawk, was guilty of some of the major horror tropes regarding race. First, the young, black stablehand is cannon fodder, whose death means nothing but the movement of plot. This is the only African-American in the film, that I could tell. Second, the Native Americans are so alien and unknowable as to be literally monsters. The main characters openly discuss the number of Indians theyve killed. While on their journey across a standard Western landscape, two Mexicans approach the camp in the night and are summarily executed. There is a religious subtext, as well, wherein the character that survives the whole affair is constantly praying. The monstrous troglodytes emerge from the valley of starving men because some murderous bandits kicked over rocks at a site sacred to the monsters.

Lets set aside the horror tropes and talk about cannibalism. It happened. It was part of the cultures of North America. It still happens in parts of the world remote from modern theories of germs and disease. Let us first begin by letting that concept go. The divide between what is food and what is disgusting is inextricably linked to the identification of groups and cultures. Let us begin by placing that concept aside. The actions of the tribe appear monstrous, just as Grendel appears monstrous, just as fire ants appear monstrous. But, white men came to the country and decimated native populations. Should they not fight back? Should they not defend their sacred places? Much of the drama of the film revolves around the good people caught in the crossfire of the vengeance of the sacred. The unwitting good people caught up in the fight are going to die.

This is the race war, idea, though. This is the manifest destiny at the heart of the genre of the western. The unknowable place full of savagery and terror is laid down by the gun of the good, white man. The town is protected against the wild. The railroad runs through, and will always come through whether by force of might and banditry, or by love and desire. And, in every Western Ive seen, the different races are kept apart from each other, pushed against each other, played off as representatives of the idea of their own cultures and ways of life. Even among the best-intentioned Westerns, its hard to escape the specter of the larger world in the time. The white man was coming. The black man was under his heel. The Hispanic man was a foreign world, an Other, that was to be pushed away from decent Americans, or a race of ignorant children to be protected by decent Americans. The red man was a monster and was to be feared and fought and never trusted. The best of the savages could, perhaps, integrate into the town, but never keep their own way of life. The idea of the west is, at heart, a race war where a whole continent was placed under the heel of the white American, and all other cultures and ways of life are pushed down and away.

Even the best Westerns, the smartest and bravest and most interesting, walk across this face of history. The town is the place of order and civilization, and it is a place of Whiteness. The wilderness is the place of danger and the unknown. It is the place of the native Americans, who were, actually, as civilized in their way as any European-style township. The heart of the genre carries a race war. What do we do about it? What do we write about it? What do we make movies about it?

This one was not very good, and did not earn the gory violence that is contained herein. It just seemed to stand up and shout about the many problems inherent in the genre, that, at its best, at least attempts to address those issues.",1463270400,,3671,4.617151607963247

The quality of the video was excellent  and without any technical difficulties.  I would give this aspect of the feature 5 stars.  However, the movie itself was B-movie quality.  Kurt Russell's performance was pretty good especially given the lack luster script.  The actress from the series ""Banshee"" didn't show anymore acting ability here than she did in the Cine Max Series.  The plot was mediocre and contained several plot holes.  Matthew Fox also co-stared and did a pretty good job despite his character being pitifully one dimensional.  The storyline actually had the potential to have been much better but it seemed the writer was in too much of a hurry to simply get a script done so that a movie could be made.  However, there was quite a bit of action and some pretty spin tingling gory and gruesome scenes that I rater enjoyed.  The latter makes the movie inappropriate for children.  I really wished that the screenplay had contained more depth and avoided the scenes and moments that defied even my ability to suspend disbelief.

One of  Kurt Russell's best performances in years as the calm, dedicated, sensible sheriff who summoned the courage to undertake the rescue of a woman in an absolutely horrifying journey  to his fate.  You could feel the excruciating pain of the woman's husband as he soldiered on to rescue his wife.  A great cast of characters.

A hero on a journey to rescue his damsel in distress.  An ornery old coot who steels the show.  Oh and bad, bad savages.  Despite being a true Western fans of John Wayne will love, Bone Tomahawk will not disappoint modern audiences.  There is darkness here Cormac McCarthy would appreciate.  The dialogue is worthy of the Cohen brothers, and at times, even rings of Sorkin.  This movie is both brutal and fantastic without departing too much from reality.

7404097,2,B014HDTT84,"I love Kurt Russell and Westerns (remember how great he was in Tombstone?) and I 'get' the attempt to blend a Western & a horror film in one from a modern film makers POV. But the VIOLENCE IN THIS FILM IS SO GRAPHIC, it could/should have gotten an NC-17 rating in my view. And I share this warning to anyone who plans to watch it, not as a spoiler, but as a direction, do not let your kids watch this film.
It starts off as another 'weird Western', (like the other new film ""Slow West""; can't anybody make a 'normal', interesting, satisfying Western alla Unforgiven these days?). The opening scene is VERY GRAPHIC with 2 cowboys killing folks and fleeing into the hills with their loot. The film then shifts to the Town where Kurt Russell is Sheriff and becomes a kidnap/chase film which I actually thought was 'ok'. Matthew Fox is interesting as a 'gunslinger' who likes to kill Indians & goes along for the quest to find Patrick Wilson's Wife taken by Indians unlike any you've seen in a Western before. The film moves very slow, has way too much dialogue for a Western. Those issues could be 'overlooked' but the ""in your face violence"" ruined the film for me.",1461542400,,1163,4.490566037735849

It is difficult to swallow that the hero of the story is able to walk miles through a desert on a broken and severely infected leg and then kill 4 or 5 cannibalistic savages. At times the movie is too slow for its own good but it does compensate with some good dialogue, most of it coming from the elderly deputy. The unique twist is that this elderly deputy, who seems to be the most expendable, survives. I would recommend this movie, especially taking into account the mostly pathetic films we have to choose from, but don not expect a great film; instead be ready for a decent, at times entertaining film with overall good acting.",1461456000,,699,4.511811023622047

7404150,4,B014HDTT84,"BONE TOMAHAWKS is a great western/horror film... I think it may have invented genre as it the first film I have seen that has combined the two. The acting is super... Kurt Russell always delivers. When he grows a mustache for a film you KNOW you are in for a treat.

There is one scene in the film that is not for the faint of heart, and is in fact one of the more gruesome things I have ever seen filmed. It is used effectively to show the brutality of the antagonist. But please don't judge the entire film by the one scene, as the movie is superbly acted, well directed and has great dialogue!",1461283200,,596,4.182608695652174

7404173,1,B014HDTT84,"There's kool-aid being passed around. This is a B-movie. The dialogue is TERRIBLE, and whomever's handling the camera needs to go back to film school. Long takes that don't make sense, plot holes, etc. Have they heard of a close-up? The actors are present, but nothing stands out. Matthew Fox is excruciatingly dull. I can't get back the 2hrs I wasted.

The story is so far fetched that it is totally unrealistic, totally unbelievable that anything like this could have ever happened in the American West!

It is dark and the future is bleak as you slog your way through a very depressing story. It's worth watching because the acting is good and the drama high but only for brave folks who can handle graphic violence (atrocities that are beyond description), and can sit through 2 hours of one of the most emotionally draining dramas I've seen in a while.",1461110400,,598,4.546296296296297

7404271,4,B014HDTT84,"Gruesome, but engaging.  Russell plays the honorable and dedicated Sheriff well, and the supporting cast is likeable.  You are left at the end wishing for a few more minutes  - but don't want to spoil it.  Not for the faint of heart, as the cannibalistic acts of the antagonists and the self-preservation acts of the protagonists are equally violent - but that is what makes the scenes so compelling.

7404277,5,B014HDTT84,"Quirky in some ways, but tense throughout.  The bad guys are not zombies, just some way-out-there branch of the family with some deadly habits, and dangerous to boot.

7404297,2,B014HDTT84,"I was quite excited to see a new western, and with Kurt Russell.  He is a great actor and I always enjoy his work.  However Bone Tomahawk was a bit disappointing. I don't think the actors were the problem, but the whole movie seemed to be sluggish in its timing.  I think it may have been poorly directed.  The dialogue didn't seem natural, though I appreciated the lack of exaggerated accents and colloquialisms, as well as other stereotypical language peculiarities that plaque some westerns.  Through much of the first half of the movie I thought I was watching a drama or horror film.  By the time the ""Troglodytes"" and the cowboys started interacting in the wilderness, the action seemed to morph into dramatic comedy.  The ""Troglodytes"" were not horrific in the way they were portrayed.  Their screams were unnaturally loud and resonant.  The cage bars they constructed to hold the captives had no way of being secured to the rock walls, and their behaviors were cartoonish.  While I can appreciate a movie that is quirky and comedic intentionally, this one just didn't come off as that until midway through it.  Bone Tomahawk had great potential but lost its focus, and lacked for good dialogue and direction.  Wish Kurt had not don this film.;",1461024000,,1251,4.821596244131455

The scene where the cannibals bared the deputy, gutted him and then split him was a little gory. We thought the backup deputy added a lot to the movie and it was a bit slow at times.

7404408,3,B014HDTT84,"This ambitiously scripted western/horror amalgamation has much to recommend it.  It also suffers from serious flaws which prevent a higher rating from me.  Or the public.  This one brought in less than $2,000,000 in limited release before being sent to DVD purgatory.  Critics however liked it a lot.  Kurt Russell is great by the way.
  Russell, a local sheriff, takes three other men with him to rescue some towns folk who have been kidnapped by Indians.  Before they leave, a local Indian lets them know that they will be confronting not local tribesmen gone on the warpath, but rather a clan of outcast, in bred, cave dwelling cannibals.  They head out any how to do or die in the finest Western tradition.  And boy do they get a work out.  There is blood and gore galore.  The script has the characters speaking as the people of the time would likely speak.  They look, act and seem like people of the old west and not just some actors dressed up.  I did like that a lot.
  The film has picked up a total of five awards here and there, including two from the Catalonian International Film Festival.  The awards range from best make up to best director.
  The film was made in three weeks from a script by first time director S. Craig Zahler.  I have two serious quibbles with the film.  First, the sound is un-even, something we do not ever get in successful films.  And at two hours and 13 minutes, it is too long.  Not too long to tell the impressive and bloody story, too long to maintain the interest of the watcher.  It seems more artistic than thriller like.  The film takes a good long while to get cranked up.  While this allows us to get to know the characters, it is just toooooo slow.  A good trip to the cutting room would have helped a lot.",1460851200,,1758,4.4125

It's very slow the first half, this portion of the film mainly consists of the viewer getting to know the characters, the type of people that they are, and the journey they must go on. The second half of this movie provides some well deserved that action and suspense to those who stayed with the film.

I have to say this really was a movie which told a story (shocking in this day an age) as opposed to most modern movies that use the format to simply dangle sex, explosions and cheap thrills in front of a slack jawed audience.  I don't understand why so many people consider this movie to be slow-paced, as the entire time I was enthralled by the characters' emotions, interactions, and what was an obvious well developed lead up to a shocking and horrible climax.  This movie took the time to actually develop the characters.  Four men go on a long and dangerous journey to rescue a woman and deputy from a clan of cave dwelling natives, knowing that they have little chance to succeed.  On the way they battle the elements in an uncharted and unmapped western frontier and bravely continue through the unforgiving landscape.  The movie contains humor, adventure, drama, romance, and yes, horrific violence for those who are squeamish.  In fact, the scene most reviewers are talking about is pretty difficult to watch and for those of you that have a hard time with that kind of thing should definitely avoid this movie.

7404443,5,B014HDTT84,"I watched this at the suggestion of a friend, and I loved it. I don't know why this film didn't have a broader release, and I don't know why it only has 3.2 stars (at the time this review was written). The basic premise: a pair of criminals stumble into savage (not Indian) territory, and one escapes but leads the savages to a nearby town; after some townspeople are abducted, the small town assembles a makeshift posse from the few men available. A few bullet points:
-It has a SUPERB cast of actors led by Kurt Russell, but including Patrick Wilson, Matthew Fox, Richard Jenkins, and David Arquette.
-There is great character development, particularly amongst the posse as they travel. Kurt Russell plays a tough sherriff. Patrick Wilson plays a God-fearing, but injured cowboy. Matthew Fox is a playboy gunslinger, who's a little out-of-place in the small town of Brideshead. Richard Jenkins steals the show as a senior citizen & widower who is enlisted to be a ""backup sherriff's deputy"" more as a means of the sherriff looking after the man. He winds up being surprisingly capable, and endears himself to the audience throughout the film.
-From the first second, it shows you how brutal the Old West could be. While other films romanticize the notion of sleeping out on the prairie next to your trusty horse, this film shows you how dangerous it really was. A pistol and long gun were not optional, they were essential.
-This is NOT a movie for children, or the faint of heart. There is an element of gore and horror that will disturb some viewers. I personally felt it further reinforced the awful brutality people faced in the frontier, and the sort of violence they routinely encountered.

Once again, I'm astonished that this wasn't released more widely. It has a stellar cast, and I recognized virtually every actor with a speaking part in this film (straight down to the piano player who you might recognize as the principal in Back to the Future). If you can stomach some of the gore, and if you like Westerns you owe it to yourself to watch this film.",1459987200,3,2065,4.704419889502763

There are some truly horrific parts. It's so disturbing, yet so interesting that you can't look away. Like a bad car wreck, but a million times crazier!
The beginning starts off with a bang! The middle is a bit more slow, but like I mentioned; it's not boring on account of the amazing script and actors portraying these unique characters! Go Mathew Fox! I love his character and I love seeing him acting on the big screen! (Everybody else, EVERYBODY! Is fantastic!)

I watched alone over 2 days, and that in-between time, I couldn't stop thinking of the characters and the story. Unfortunately one scene is too gruesome to ever be able to call this film  a classic. It's too bad because the acting is top-notch, believable dialogue, good costuming, and a story that catches one's interest. This is not a Western for kids to watch and the faint-of-heart. However, it is not farfetched to believe these types of humans could have still been alive in the isolated west during this time period. The pace is slow, but adds to building toward the climatic parts. I was not disappointed at the end; it seemed believable, as if real people were trying to stay alive.

Be sure you can fast forward through parts that are disturbing if that is an issue for you. There is a handful of pretty graphic Tarentino-esque moments in there, but it is a good story line that moves at a good slow pace. Dialogue is as old as the setting and slow paced as it would have been for this time frame.  Loved that.  Not something you can sit on your cell phone or not pay attention to or you will miss out on many funny things said between the men in this. The entire movie had a surprise twist and the ending was also a surprise but a good one. I am a huge Kurt Russell fan so this movie took me aback with the gore in it, as he isn't usually in that type of movie, but all in all, I would recommend it.  I watched it alone late one night, told the family about it and we all watched it (grown children and spouse) later.

I also like that the movie takes it's time to get to the action. The story lets the viewer get to know the characters on their journey to retrieve the victim of a kidnapping from some very, very hostile savages. Russell and co. shine.

The acting, filming, pacing and storyline are just right. Even the sound is good and the song at the end, ""Four Doomed Men Ride Out"" has a classic western theme. There's just enough comic relief in the story to tone down the tension.

This is a classic Horror/Western in the same vein as FRANKENSTEIN,... JAWS,.. THE THING and other films and stories that deal with man's horror of the unknown and overwhelming fear of death and final destruction. How does a person face death when it comes in the presence of brute violence, that's what this is about. And it is done well...It reminds me of a ""tall tale"" like those of the great pulp fiction writer, ROBERT E. HOWARD.

The character development and dialogue is very good and makes the whole project believable on an uncanny level. Some people have complained about the gore...forget it. One visit to the slaughterhouse will cure of you that complaint. Great movie!",1459296000,,1064,4.745945945945946

The movie cruises at 15mph for the first half then throws it in 6th gear and kinda blows you away I liked the story and yes it has one, I don't see why many disparage it. Frankly I found it to be a more interesting story than plenty of other westerns I have seen where its just a good guys vs bad guys thing. Its a more original take.

If you view IMDBs rating guide it explicitly has a violence and gore section for this movie. The film is not rated so its on the viewer to either research it or not to complain when it has NC-17 like violence. I feel its not really a fair shake to rate the film low for gore as it is stated if given any research. Its like rating a car poorly for having low power when its clearly shown as 150hp.

I thought a number of plot elements were unpredictable and there is some racism but the main antagonists are not part of any sort of real Indian tribe. I would say the racism in this film is 100x less than something like django or period westerns that depict real Indian tribes as savages.

I deducted a star because of some of the monotony and not the best of acting.",1459209600,,1153,4.048245614035087

It was if someone had a budget of $50K and rented a western town and a cast of about a dozen and intended to bury this mess along with the Trog Indians concept.  The script was moronic where people in the jail get kidnapped by these mysterious Indians and the Posse formed consisted of 3 senior citizens and a cripple, perhaps they had a grant from AARP.  Honestly, the story-line got so ridiculous and BORING I turned the movie OFF after 45 torturous minutes.

7404688,4,B014HDTT84,"If you liked Kurt Russell in the epic Western, Tombstone, and you enjoy Thrillers, then you will like this movie. Kurt Russell's character is similar to an old Wyatt Earp.  He plays an aging sheriff of the peaceful town of Bright Hope who is obligated to track down a scary bunch of cannibals who have kidnapped a young wife and nurse, and his young deputy. Russell plays the role of the tired but dutiful sheriff well. The movie does spend considerable time developing the main characters, which might aggravate some impatient viewers, but one begins to care about the characters when they are imperiled.  The movie's title probably attracts the wrong viewers since it implies some 'mysticism' or the 'supernatural.' This is a good vanilla Western albeit with a different spin...a brave sheriff and a rag tag bunch of would-be heroes versus a group of ruthless killers and insurmountable odds.",1459209600,,894,4.953333333333333

It was a western, so some of it seemed predictable. A western is a western, right? I enjoyed the characters in this movie. Must say, Kurt Russell was a draw; I like his movies. The mix of personalities added to the intrigue. And I must say, I was very curious about this mystery tribe they alluded to. I was not, however, prepared for the savagery toward the end. I won't spoil it, but the scene in the cave with the one guy while the other captives watched was for me the most heinous scene ever. Frankly, it disturbed me greatly and I wished I could un-watch that part. Truly it almost ruined the whole movie for me. That was just too much. Everything after that was pointless, because I was repulsed to the Nth degree. OMG. Did still watch till the end and glad to see how it ended, but would never, ever, ever watch it again. For heaven's sake, do NOT allow anyone under 17 to watch it! This is a tough one to recommend. Viewer beware.",1459209600,3,1098,4.334951456310679

This movie was so horrible, it took everything I had to keep watching it.  I guess I stuck it out thinking there would be a redeeming storyline just around the next corner, but it never got any better.  Cheesy acting, cheesy make up and even cheesier troglodytes, coupled with a plodding, idiotic storyline, made this thing nearly unwatchable.  I'd give it ""No Stars"" if that were an option, but since it isn't, I give it a begrudging, single star.

7404980,2,B014HDTT84,"In all fairness, I wasn't sure what I was getting myself into when I started watching this movie. My mind was in the mood for western, which I sort of got. The problem is that is is a horror-western. Now when I say ""horror"" let me say also that in years gone by I was a horror movie aficionado and as of late I simply have lost the taste for horror at all. There are lots of reasons why, but mostly because I feel there is enough evil in the world and I don't really want to entertain my brain with it. Morals aside, the entertainment value of this movie is ok. Kurt Russell is my favorite actor and his performance was nothing less than spectacular as always. The story was sort of a spin on a classic western tale and I enjoyed it until about halfway through the movie. At that point I witnessed one of the most brutal death scenes I have seen in a long time and maybe ever. Now, as I said, I used to be a horror movie buff; death scenes were just part of the norm in those movies. Something about this one really bothered me on a deep level. I won't spoil it in case you decide to watch, and honestly anything past that scene is a mystery because I turned the movie off during the scene. I was physically nauseated for about 15 minutes or so after I watched it. From what I saw, the level of gore just wasn't needed. However, the writers obviously disagreed and that leads me to another point: somebody's mind has to be sick enough to come up with this. I think that's probably the most disturbing thing.

In any case this movie just wasn't for me simply because I object to the level of gore used in the movie. Would have rather watched something inspiring instead of something so bleak. Again, it's on me for not really researching what I was watching. If you're going to watch this just know what you're getting into.",1459036800,19,1823,4.238505747126437

7404983,3,B014HDTT84,"I quite enjoyed Bone Tomahawk. It begins as a quaint western. The dialog, at times, seems stilted and not at all what one would expect from a western. The characters seem altogether too polite and refined in their speech and mannerisms.

The posse going after the kidnapped townspeople take their sweet time. There is little sense of urgency in their pursuit of the 'Troglodytes'. The title comes from the use of horse jawbones as tomahawks; an almost biblical weapon.

The big flaw that I noticed is when the remaining posse is imprisoned within the cave 'cells', the wooden bars are set shallowly into the ground and pegged at the top by some kind of spike. They appear very flimsy and the bars could easily be removed and used as weapons while an escape could be made. There was no attepmt made to make these bars look like they were 'escape proof'.

The scene of butchery in the cave isn't as gory as other reviews make it out to be... it's simply unexpected and somewhat shocking.",1458950400,,985,4.617142857142857
7404984,1,B014HDTT84,"Slow-paced and racially-offensive. The ""Troglodytes"" are supposedly a sub-species of the indigenous native Americans? Even more ""savage"" than the ""savages""? This film would have been welcomed by the same people who tried so hard to de-humanize the American indigenous people at the time of the Trail of Tears and even later at the turn of the 19th century when industrialists used propaganda to convince US citizens that the Indians were ""Godless"" in order to make way for the railroads and expansion into the west. Russell and Jenkins should be ashamed and embarrassed for being part of this horrible portrayal of the American west. Sure, some will say it's no different than ""Abe Lincoln, Vampire Hunter"" or ""Inglourious Basterds"" as alternate history or fantasy, but I choose to see it as yet another attempt to dehumanize the people that were here a millennia before white Europeans.",1458864000,2,887,5.124137931034483

I agree with a previous reviewer who mentioned the middle third of the movie dragged a bit, but maybe that was necessary to build the suspense; as they get farther and farther from home, they have less and less control and bad things tend to happen more often. By the time they arrive at the caves, they are pretty wasted and unprepared for the hell about to break loose. Personally, I think Fox gave the best performance - quite a change from Jack Shepherd!

7405012,5,B014HDTT84,"This is not for everyone, but I personally think it was tremendous. It's a western, a comedy, and a monster movie rolled into one. The acting is mostly great, especially Richard Jenkins.  The humor and dialogue are unique and interesting. To enjoy this movie, you need to be mentally prepared for a massive shift in tone at the end. Structurally it reminds me of Dusk til Dawn that way. This seems like a well done western all the way UNTIL... things go horribly wrong. The massive shift from western to... well, horror I guess, really generates a deep sense of how quickly things can go from normal to absolutely horrific. There is no warning or build up, just like real life can be. So much so, you start to wonder ""is this really happening?"" I'm sure this will turn some viewers off, especially if they were enjoying the regular old posse round-em up story. But I think the juxtaposition only drives home how awesome the movie really is. It's a wonderful risk taken by the film makers, turning this movie into anything but the normal Hollywood movie. The first 66% of the movie is necessary though, to connect us to the characters in such a way that we are right there with them at the end. One word of warning: there is one absolutely gruesome and graphic murder later in the film, like nothing I've ever seen. Again, necessary to drive home how real things have suddenly gotten for our heroes.

7405015,3,B014HDTT84,"I have a pretty extensive knowledge and experience with both the Western and Horror genres. There are certain staples in each that constitute what makes a good film in their respective categories. When I first heard about Bone Tomahawk I honestly thought ""how could this be bad?"". The answer seems to be pretty simple, the director (and writer) had a good idea but did not really know how to make it happen the right way.

Let's start from the Western aspect. What are the staples in Westerns? Things that make the great ones stand out. First and foremost the cinematography is right at the top of the list. In the first 5 minutes you can see this as a failure in that area. The OVER use of steadicam throughout the film was a huge mistake, there were very few ""long shots"" of the landscape in this movie which is an absolute MUST. It seems the Director of Photography didn't care too much, or do his homework about how a Western should look and feel.

Next would be the score... or the lack thereof. This could fall into the category of either genre. Plain and simple, through an hour and a half any music whatsoever was used only ONCE, and when music was used it seemed purely incidental. Keeping music out of a movie like this kept it from being suspenseful or interesting.

Too much dead space. Too many long dull moments in the movie with nothing interesting happening, or where too much time was wasted on something insignificant in the movie. This kind of thing IS normal in the Western genre but there is a particular grace about it when done properly. Some very odd and bewildering (at least to me) comedy. This did NOT seem like a movie that was built for comic relief but Richard Jenkins character seemed to be exactly that.

As many others have said on here, Kurt Russell was great (although not specifically so), I'm a huge fan of him but he just couldn't carry this one all by himself. If the film was re-shot, properly scored (a Jonny Greenwood style ala There Will Be Blood score would have perfect) and cut down to maybe an hour and 45 minutes with a better ending, it probably could have been great.",1458432000,4,2117,4.490909090909091

Good character writing - each character had their own distinct personality, which I apprecaited. The dialogue is terse, but still felt natural to me - when people work together that don't know each other well, that's how it goes. There are a couple of scenes in this that go against the internal logic of the film, which bothers me (pulls me out of the story) - one is a scene of convenience (there's no underling logic for why the characters show up except to fulfill a plot requirement) and they other is a logic you don't really think about until the film is over, but it's still quite compelling and had me engrossed to the end. It's quite graphic, particulary in one scene - we're talkng horror film graphic, so it's best to be prepared going in. So not perfect, but I always enjoy a decent western, especially ones that rely less on drama, character & plot instead of mindless action scenes.",1458259200,,982,4.649425287356322

7405114,2,B014HDTT84,"2 1/2 stars...maybe. This film was not quite what I was hoping for.
At just about 2 hrs 10 mins it could have easily been edited down to 90 minutes. Set in the Old West, the story revolves around 4 men searching for the wife of one of the 4 that was taken by some sort of native American/cannibal tribe. We spend a nauseating amount of time watching these four ride and, and ultimately, walk across baron landscape and desert.
At several points into their journey they have quite a few over-dramatic, childish arguments - each of them always trying to have the last word.
It's really amateurish - even for Kurt Russell. And I enjoy Kurt Russell movies.
The last 20 or so mins are where it comes together and we get to see a couple of gory, graphic cannibalistic rituals and carnage.
This doesn't bother me as much as it seems to bother way too may others. I've seen much worse in film.
The good guys win in the end but at a heavy cost. This is a love it/hate it film... I was on the fence at the end...if it were edited a little better and had a bit more action I would go 3 full stars but this was way too drawn out for the first hour. No - it's not ""gritty"", no, it's NOT the greatest western ever put to film (whoever thinks that needs to get out more).

7405122,4,B014HDTT84,"Fair warning - this is a very violent and gory movie at the end. But it is a well done film with top-drawer acting from Kurt Russell, Richard Jenkins, Patrick Wilson and Lili Simmons. This movie fits its title - crude and violent like a bone tomahawk - a bare-bone movie. It is a stripped-down Western with very little sweeping and grand action but more than a few powerful scenes. Not a movie for a date - unless you and your date do not mind evisceration and decapitation along with the popcorn. Some reviewers complain of slow develolpment and boring pace. I did not detect anything other than refusal by director S. Craig Zahler to decorate the film with easy and pretty standard Cowboy and Indian fare.

There was little growth in the characters or emotional depth either.  Although Kurt Russell is an excellent actor and did his best with the poor dialog he was given he couldn't save this film.

It reminded me of ""Cowboys versus Aliens"", but more in an independent film style and storyline instead of a big studio production blockbuster.  The acting is good, Kurt Russell and Patrick Wilson are the headliners, and they play unique characters and are pretty credible in their roles.  It didn't qualify for more stars, even though it kept me entertained; because there is a long, long, section of the film devoted to Wilson's injured character suffering on a quest to catch some Indian kidnappers.  And there is one very unnecessary graphic scene of torture and cannibalism. I had to cover my eyes on this, and no movie for whatever artistic license should ever have an unwatchable scene!

The cinematography and production values are worthy of more stars. And if you are a fan of westerns with a revenge theme It's worth seeing ,but the bad guys are pretty disturbing.",1458000000,4,907,4.863636363636363

7405406,5,B014HDTT84,"It seems that ""Bone Tomahawk"" is a movie that will really divide viewers. People will either love it or hate it, with no one in the middle ground. Personally, I really enjoyed it. That is not to say that the movie is without flaws. The low budget of the enterprise (less than $2 million) is evident at times though I credit writer/director S. Craig Zahler for working hard so the movie never looks extremely cheap.

And yes, the movie is both long (over two hours in length) and for the most part, slow moving; the movie would almost certainly have been better had the pacing been somewhat quicker. Despite these flaws, the movie does have a lot of power. The dialogue is pretty good, being colorful but not too much; you can believe these characters would say what they say.

The acting is also professional; the cast manages to sell their characters. When it comes to action and violence, you do have to wait a long time for the serious stuff to come, but it's worth the wait, being very hard hitting and seriously bloody. And while the movie is overlong and slow, I personally wasn't bored at any moment; there is always something of interest going on. But despite my enjoyment of the movie, as I said, it's not for everyone. But if you like westerns and possess a good amount of patience, you'll probably enjoy this movie.

7405430,5,B014HDTT84,"First off, Kurt Russell was born to play in westerns.
Matthew Fox (although a man of few words) plays his part perfect.

I refuse to tell you about the movie (that's what movie trailers are for) but I can tell you that the dialog is exceptional, the casting was perfect, the interaction between characters was well written, the acting was great, and the ending.......well, I can't tell you everything but it was awesome!

I have owned this movie for just over two months and have already watched it 5 times.

Twists and turns keep you guessing in this movie all the way to the end.

I love watching westerns with my son because (usually) the good guys are good and the bad guys are bad.  Simple concept that Hollywood seems to have forgotten (but that's another story).  I refuse to allow my 12 year old son to see this movie due to the extreme graphic violence.

I am not knocking the movie for that, it is just part of the experience but please be aware that this ain't Tombstone and there is some bloody, gory scenes in this movie that you can't ""un-see"" so remember this when choosing to watch this with younger, more impressionable viewers.

I don't understand all the negative reviews other than I guess people were possibly expecting Wyatt & Doc again but this is a different movie and that would be an unfair comparison.  Tombstone deserved 6 out of 5 stars but this one deserves 5.",1457740800,,1390,4.528

7405590,1,B014HDTT84,"A b-grade flick at best with one name actor, Kurt Russell playing sheriff, trying to lift the load. Acting was at best mediocre ... but worse plot holes galore fill this film.

The film starts with two characters (one played by David Arquette) bushwhacking people on the trail and then being set upon themselves by some nasty aboriginal indians who didn't like them trespassing on their burial grounds. Ok, one of the dudes gets killed by an arrow, but the other one (Arquette's character) somehow manages to escape? Really. Not only that but he escapes on foot to some no name town a few days walk away, where the gets shot in the leg and put in a jail cell just for looking suspicious. Surprise, surprise the indians have manage to follow him. Huh, they follow him for a couple days but don't attack him? No... but the indians do manage to murder a stable boy, kidnap the jailor, the Arquette character and the wife of a local rancher who is treating his wound. All this without any shots fired or alarms raised in the process. Then they drag their captives on foot (no suggestion they had horses) back to some cave in the foot hills. The town finds out that their fellow citizens got taken and the sheriff assembles a rescue party made up of himself, his over the hill deputy, a professional indian fighter, and the husband of the captured female, who just happens to have been laid up with a broken leg awaiting a doctor to come to town to set it. Ok.. Ok...so the rescue team sets out on horseback the day following the kidnapping, but somehow can't seem to catch up the to marauding indians who are dragging their captives on foot? Really? Really? Plus how is it the sheriff is so dumb as to not send a request before taking off after the kidnappers asking the local cavalry to back up his rescue party? Not smart as subsequent events would prove.  Along the way the rancher with the broken leg takes a turn for the worse with what appears to be gangrene after hobbling around for a couple of days on a crutch - which necessitates the deputy being called into action to set the leg. Huh? First, setting a broken leg after gangrene sets in doesn't stop the gangrene. But apparently in this case it miraculously improves his condition so much that he can hobble even better and faster to catch up to his fellow rescuers, who have themselves now been captured by the indians. Second, how is it the deputy couldn't have set the guy's leg when he first broke it back in town before this whole absurd chase began?

In the final analysis this is really a pretty lame film, with one very unnecessary, disturbing, ultra violent scene near the end depicting the murder and cannibalization of the jailer character.

7405641,3,B014HDTT84,"The best short review of Bone Tomahawk might be: You will see things you can't unsee.

The premise is great -- average western settler/cowboy types trying to recover a woman captured by Indians (sound familiar?) -- but Indians like none ever seen in a western before. The cast is outstanding -- Kurt Russell, an almost unrecognizable Richard Jenkins, Patrick Wilson, and Lili Simmons. All great.

Cinematography is mediocre. When you consider the astounding work done by John Ford or Clint Eastwood (among others), this film really fails to take advantage of landscape or light.

But the big problem is the horror angle. The worst of the gore is stomache churning. You may love it. But it may make the film unwatchable. In my opinion, just a bit of a reduction in the violence would have left the film more watchable, and perhaps even more scary.",1457395200,,846,4.820689655172414

7405792,2,B014HDTT84,"Bone Tomahawk actually started out promising. The story was simple, as a western should be. But it jumped the shark about 2/3 of the way through the movie. The tribe of cannibals was so over the top, the violence so gory, that the entire thing became a shallow, repulsive mess. I find no fault with the performances; Kurt Russell was dependably gruff and stern as the sheriff,  and Patrick Wilson did a fine job as the aggrieved husband. Matthew Fox's character Brooder was probably the most interesting; he had a very strong sense of duty and justice, but at the same time was filled with a great deal of anger. Ultimately, the premise of the film doomed it, despite the best efforts of the actors. If you want to see a well-made western, I would recommend Unforgiven, Open Range, or 3:10 to Yuma, and skip this one.",1457222400,3,817,4.557823129251701

Netflix is so yesterday right? ;-)
We stumbled across this little gem and man oh man are we glad we did. This movie is not as family friendly as some might assume, and it has some pretty basic opera in the end of very repetitive lyrics but if you're into that sort of thing then go for it. As far as the movie is concerned though, you will be. Period. Entertained to say the least. The end.

I felt that it was unnecessary to show a random and extremely graphic scene of some of the most gruesome violence. That and the sex scene made no contribution to the story. Tombstone was great because its soundtrack was spot on and carried and or was carried by the acting itself. Also wish they used a better camera or camera angles and processions, because it just made this movie a border line indy film. I was entertained and the plot is really creepy especially the villains. this was a nightmare to watch, acting was great and delivered a truly frightening story.

7406113,1,B014HDTT84,"Bone Tomahawk suffers from the same problems of representation that many of its early- and mid-20th century counterparts did: barbaric portrayals of Native Americans under the guise of ""godless savages"" that need to be killed by civilized white cowboys. Unfortunately, most of the stereotypical cowboy-and-indian movies got made decades ago, and years of social progress and critical interrogation of acceptable stereotypes have prevented many of these kinds of projects from being launched in the 21st century. Unfortunately, Bone Tomahawk somehow got past the not-so-rigorous ""Should we... uh... make this kind of film?"" test that many scripts now fail. It's clear now why this film had to be independently financed: many studios were certainly reticent to attach their names (or money) to such an offensive and out-of-date premise.

The action sequences are fun, the gore almost plot-appropriate, and the acting is acceptable. But the movie suffers from a lack of plot, sloppy editing, a sophomoric directorial debut, and the shroud of racism that prevents the film's antagonists from being anything other than one-dimensional movie monsters. There is no intrigue, the central conflict is entirely predictable, and the film's outcome was obvious 20 minutes into the movie.

I don't usually get nightmares from movies because I know it's not real, but this one DID give me a nightmare due to the realism of the special effects.

I'm a Walking Dead fan, so I'm not opposed to blood and gore but this was pretty out there and came unexpectedly, as up until that point things had been just the opposite.

The movie tried to build the husband and wife characters but it was laughable. Especially when he reads the poem out loud.

There is no information about the tribe of Indians at all. Would have been so much better if there was some history behind them.

The rescue plan is laughable. They just walk in and get caught. Then you have a very crippled member that somehow saves the day. And then the movie just ends.

7406241,4,B014HDTT84,"I was tempted to say this is the first cannibal western but I think Trey Parker planted that flag a while back.

Given the generally favorable reviews for Bone Tomahawk, I was really looking forward to seeing it. Ultimately, the movie is done in by its length and a pacing that would be generously referred to as languid (probably accounting for its lack of a theatrical release).  Imagine some lame guy (literally not figuratively) limping across seemingly endless desert (which is exactly what happens for a good chunk of the run time) and you pretty much have how this one unspools.

Bone Tomahawk establishes its B movie credentials up front with none other than Sid Haig as a vile bushwhacker preying on sleeping travelers. Sid collects his check early, but accomplice David Arquette manages to survive their initial encounter with troglodyte savages. These primitives are of the ashy, dust-covered variety and look like they wandered over from Col. Kurtzs jungle hideaway. Arquette manages to get himself to the quiet little town of Bright Hope. For reasons disclosed later, the cannibal tribe pursues him there, does a little murder, steals horses and abducts the towns deputy and nurse for good measure (actually, for good eatin and good breedin, respectively). Its up to whiskered Kurt Russell in full Wyatt Earp / John Ruth mode to mount a search party and bring em back. Along for the ride are Matthew Fox as a soldier turned town dandy and the omnipresent Richard Jenkins as an elderly chatterbox. Also in tow is cowboy (and husband of the abducted nurse) Patrick Wilson whose character recently suffered a severe leg injury that threatens to go gangrene at any moment. After some bad breaks en route, the posse eventually shows up for their confrontation with those cave dwellers at a considerable disadvantage.

The acting and cast are truly first rate as is the script, which has period-appropriate dialogue and just enough humor to soften the super-grisly goings-on of the last act. No regrets about renting the DVD, just wish itd been about 40 min shorter. Oh yeah, and the butchering scene is a doozy. Three and a half stars from me.",1456704000,2,2151,4.917355371900826

7406372,4,B014HDTT84,"This is one of those movies that you either like it or you totally detest it.  From my rating you can guess that I enjoyed it , and the main reason was I loved Kurt Russell and the crusty old character he played.. and  I love movies where there was just no way I can predict what is going to happen next and this movie fits the bill..

This is a heavy duty, dusty dirty, gritty  sometimes violent western with a  interesting twist and  with many surprises and shockers in it.. again I say.. NOT for everyone.. but yet, I enjoyed it and stayed with it till the end.

It is NOT for a person that is squeamish for there are some scenes that made me jump and turn away from.. one scene in particular I had to close my eyes thru it.....so definitely not for a family movie and not for sensitive people that do not like to see violence in a movie.",1456617600,,841,4.091463414634147

The director is to be congratulated for keeping Mr. Russell's role as understated as it is and intelligent. This film reminded me of  the John Ford film ""The Searchers"" with John Wayne. That film was actually better than the short novel upon which the film was based. In the film with Mr. Russell are two outstanding supporting roles and are a pleasure to watch. As noted in other reviews there are some scenes in the last 20 or so minutes that are indeed gruesome. And there are a few nits to pick in the story line - but I did watch this fairly long film to the end w/o too much wincing.",1456617600,,678,4.2153846153846155

However, it was a horror movie, which I do not care for.  There were some very gruesome scenes, one in particular, that left me feeling very disturbed.  I really wish I hadn't  watched the movie.  If you ARE a fan of the horror genre, you'll probably love this movie.",1456617600,,416,4.337662337662338
7406470,4,B014HDTT84,"I wasn't really aware of this movie until after it had made its theatrical run, and I watched it streaming at home. Its definitely a genre bender, and all three of those genres are polarizing for mass audiences: western, black comedy, and horror. Throughout the majority of the film, it straddles western and deadpan comedy, then through the last 50 minutes or so, horror is the focus. To say that the former section was enjoyable to me is accurate: Im a fan of good dialog (I think its reasonable to say that if you like Tarantino-style dialog, youll enjoy this), and the characters are actually pretty well developed. This is to say that the focus is on the personalities of each character and how the characters react to each other and situations, not backstory (though there is some). I found the characters a mix of intelligent and endearing, despite some of their obvious flaws; all of them are well acted. The horror is actually very well done; there is a genuine sense of terror and dread for a long period of time, and its very obvious when this change occurs.

The plot is fairly straightforward: it follows a small group of frontiersmen attempting to rescue captured townspeople from a tribe of native Americans (the movie refers to them as Indians, but I wanted to be more specific). Id like to address some of the polarizing elements of this film. First, it takes a lot of cues from Western style cinema: this translates into a fairly slow pace for a large chunk of the movie. There are several scenes that are shot fairly long, so the acting is showcased. Second, the dialog is witty but its delivery is mostly deadpan, and theres a lot of nuance to some of it. Lastly, and Id argue the most controversial aspect of all, is its gore. The horror aspect is effective, but a lot of films don't depict violent acts on camera  this one does. There is one particular scene late in the movie that is likely to be stomach churning to most viewers, and while I consider myself to be pretty jaded when it comes to movie violence, I actually found my jaw hanging open in disbelief at what I saw on screen. If any of these aspects are likely to bother you, I wouldnt recommend it.

I thoroughly enjoyed Bone Tomahawk. While its fairly long (2:12), I never felt it dragged, and is consistently interesting. Those who want to try something different should absolutely check it out, though I could never give this a broad spectrum recommendation due to the aforementioned elements. This movie isn't for everyone, but its not made to be. For those that are up for something new and different, its well worth the watch.",1456617600,9,2616,4.609442060085837

Ok, shocker, everyone...spoiler alert even to some. Or at least those who are still in denial. The Star Wars reboot of episode IV, oh, thats right its called THE FORCE AWAKENS, obviously some intern at disney with a love for bad horror film titles named this one. We'll leave their name out of it to protect those innocent that were affected by the making of that film. We are almost done here. ....Again another movie from 2015, in which I just saw, was Jurassic World. can we just agree to agree, and move on. thank you.

The fact that someone had to  imagine the scenes in this film, and then, to further put them to visual possibility through screen trickery and theatrics is merely a testament of the of how far the human mind has come to disgrace its self through the playing out of its wildest and most horrific supposition of pure evil. Completely unnecessary in an age that has so much access to history and the knowledge of the violence that has already occurred in its making. Are we merely a present day crowd in a gladiators arena, waiting for the horrific death of those of whom we are seeking entertainment from??? Good acting/actors, filmography or cinematography  will not and should not anesthetize us to the trauma that ensues in ones mind after seeing such terribly troubling and ultra realistic events. The world has enough of its own violence, that we should create a medium through which to view more for no sake whatsoever other than our own entertainment.

7406516,5,B014HDTT84,"This isn't really a horror movie, it's a Western in the old style that isn't really made anymore, with gruesome scenes that films back then didn't have.  Granted The Walking Dead, Hills Have Eyes and films/TV shows that fall under the horror genre have this sort of violent action but just because something is gory doesn't make it a horror film. This is your old townsfolk vs Indians storyline that stopped being made as it is well lets face it a little one sided historically recounting history speaking, and movies killing off native people isn't exactly that politically correct these days.  So the writers have sort of tweaked that old norm with this one, being the bad guys are obviously people who have lived where they do for a long time, long before the white settlers came there, but these aren't Indians, they are in fact feared by Indians who give the area they inhabit a wide birth.  They are Troglodytes or some similar name, if you've come across them, you probably never made it to another town to tell anyone, instead you probably ended up in their stomachs.

Being your typical posse chasing bad guys/rescuing those they've kidnapped type of Western, a lot of the film is on horseback, walking or sitting around a fire so there's not much action between the beginning and end.  Bone Tomahawk as well as being a gruesome film is sort of mildly also making fun of the Western genre in the same but not as strong and obvious way Scream did for slasher horror flicks. With scenes such as Patrick Wilson with a bad leg making love to his wife with her on top for his comfort but getting too embarrassed and wanting to do it the normal way. Or the sheriff asking some other guy to stay with the doctor so he can go home while she operates on the guy he shot, and he rebuts with something like, isn't that the deputy's job, isn't that the the whole point of having a deputy.

If you're squeamish Bone Tomahawk probably isn't the movie for you, if you don't like slow movies, then perhaps you'll want to fast forward the middle.  If you can't watch a movie that is a little bit unrealistic and far fetched in telling the story you might also want to give this is a miss. But if you want a good Western that isn't afraid to make fun of the genre from time to time, and be a little cheesy at others, you won't go wrong with this one.",1456531200,,2341,4.417633410672853

7406603,5,B014HDTT84,"The western is a genre that has had it's ups and downs over the past few decades, after being the mainstay of US cinema for almost half a century. This is a exquisitely detailed, character-rich western that, for about 75% of it's running time, could have been written in the 1950's. The last act of the film, however, takes a full 90 degree turn into the most intense horror experience in recent memory. Be warned, it is NOT for the faint of heart.

That said, this is a masterfully crafted, richly rewarding film experience that is destined to become a classic in the years to come. Russell is in his finest form as Sheriff Franklin Hunt; an honest, straight-shooting lawman with integrity, grit, and loyalty as his defining traits. He also selflessly gives the movie (and all the best lines) over to his deputy Chickory, played by the wonderful Richard Jenkins in one of the finest character turns in recent memory.

I won't go into a lot of plot details, as this is a film that you should really watch cold, with as little information as possible going in to it. Suffice it to say that the story is a cross between John Ford's THE SEARCHERS and Craven's THE HILLS HAVE EYES, and if that description alone doesn't make you want to rush out to see it, then I don't know what will.

First-time director S. Craig Zahler has made one of the most impressive debuts of the new millennium with this superb film. Do yourself a favor, and don't miss it.",1456531200,,1446,4.511450381679389

I love this movie and it's slow burn of tension. It starts like a normal ""hyper realistic western"" (whatever that means) that we are used to, and goes beyond that. Jenkins should, but won't, get a nod at the Oscars for this. His performance of an aging cowboy trying to stay in his prime is so fun to watch. Seriously, the side dialogue that builds the characters is a combo of Clerks meets Reservoir Dogs in the best way possible.

Kurt Russell played one of the best Wyatt Earps in the movie Tombstone. The show started out quite intriguing but began to trip over itself with cheesy cliche dialogue and pigeon holed characters. The holes in the plot were so vast with little explanation of the ridiculous protagonist.  They then tried to patch up the flaws with over the top turn away gore and lines that were supposed to be heartfelt but came out as flat and uninspiring. I so wanted to like this show but as the movie continued it became more apparent that I should have not even started it.

Yes, the movie does slow down a little in the middle of the film. However, the slowed pace is made up for in the character development. The acting isn't amazing, but it is good. The characters are dynamic enough to allow for some comic relief in the middle of a dark film, and they do develop nicely to contrast one another. All of the complaints about gore? Yes. It does lead to some gore, but they're hunting down savages and this is made very clear from the beginning of the movie. Additionally, this is hardly the worst gore in the movie industry. I am unsure if the one and two star reviews are by consenting adults who willfully watched an adult rated film, or by elderly citizens who accidentally thought this was an old western starring Chuck Norris.",1456185600,2,806,4.409395973154362

7406756,1,B014HDTT84,"Bone Tomahawk has to be one of the most, if not THE most infuriating films I have encountered (as a film historian and film maker myself, I have experienced plenty).  Rather than a tediously drawn-out review here, I will be succinct to spare you all.

First, I was lured in, or duped really, into watching Bone Tomahawk by a decent-looking trailer. A new, fresh take on a Western. Check. A grizzled, understated (non-Carpenter directed) Kurt Russell. Check. Then to make sure I was not deluding myself, I read a plethora of reviews. While there were a few that admonished to stay away, there were enough solid reviews to take the chance. Check.

The trailer does not at all depict just how dreadful the pacing is. Yack and bicker some, ride slowly, camp at night. Yack and bicker some, ride slowly for what seems to be days, camp at night. Repeat and rinse until you nearly (& desperately) turn the clunker off. Also excruciating, is one of the lead characters. He whines and whines and whines. I wanted to free spar with this bitchy worm more than punish my eyes, ears and movie soul. My two movie guests would stop me as I motioned to shut it down. Why so? ""Yes, this is terrible, but we have already invested.... you know the rest of this classic maneuver for funky films. I concurred, yet grumbled demands that, ""This had BETTER get better, or...""  Well, the whiney, pathetic character never may have maintained his King-of-S***e status throughout, but the film DID need to be completed--just to say that I made it and for the last act.

Now, I am not at all contending that the movie was salvaged by the final act, but I do feel that, as painful and disgusting as it was to behold, everyone up for a ""B (or C in this case) movie night should try and make it to the end of Bone Tomahawk. Why? Well, you know how everrrry once in a while most of us grow tired of searching for the next great, classic film, and say, ""Let's make popcorn and watch bad B-films tonight!"" THIS is one of those films. Sure the cinematography is s***e (forget the cool grainy vibe of film here--more akin to a bad tv/soap opera look). Sure, you will want to kill one of the lead actors or at least hope for his demise during their bicker-ride-camp extravaganza. Yes, you may even question your sanity for having completed this mondo-bizarro stinker. Yes, you would rather pierce your butt cheeks than sit through the final cave scenes. Still, you will be able to tell your children that you survived Bone Tomahawk!",1456099200,,2494,4.5456570155902005

7406760,4,B014HDTT84,"Bone Tomahawk is a film fusion of the Western and Horror genres. The understated script and plot manage to give you the proverbial kick to the head.

You have the classic Western elements: The stoic sheriff, the loyal deputy, the determined cowboy and the loner gunslinger that team up against the outside threat.

Then, Bone Tomahawk veers away from the classic plot line and the threat isn't the usual the cowboys from the trail who descend on the town or the rich local rancher who is taking over the water rights.  You have the classic Horror elements: The night time raid, the crazy killers. Then as with the Western elements, the Horror takes a sharp right turn into unusual territory. These antagonists aredifferent, even by the usual Horror standards.

For most of the film you have the usual out on the trail, banter among the posse and the scenery. And then about ten percent of what the heck just happened there?!. The film has an R-rating for a reason; with that said, your senses aren't overloaded with graphic violence.

I cant really recommend this to Western fans even though it does have all the usual staples of the Western film; theres a shock factor here so keep that in mind I also cant recommend this to Horror fans because there isn't enough of the slash and blood factor if thats your usual thing.

I *will* recommend this film to the enthusiast (either Western or Horror) who wants something different. And yes, this film is different. The cast pulls it off excellently. Bone Tomahawk is that rare film which combines genres and pulls it off. If you want an entertaining and disturbing film that showcases both the indomitable spirit and brutality of men during the frontier era (with some possible historical mythology thrown in?), then check out this film.",1456099200,6,1783,4.7727272727272725

7406785,4,B014HDTT84,"This is a great little film, and I rated it 4 stars because of the actors I like in it, and because of just the quick brutal scenes that feel real and unforgiving. Lot of the action is quick and to the point, and it makes you believe all hope is lost and anything can end in a blink of an eye. However, probably 70% of the movie is of them traveling. Most of the content happens in the beginning and in the last 25-30 mins. Rest of it is just walking, just trying to get there alive. Because of this the movie can seem pretty slow paced.

7406856,5,B014HDTT84,"As a historical horror fiction (?), this movie is a bit slow on capturing interest.  However, as a behavior study of a manly-man (Kurt Russell, the Sheriff) adeptly massaging decision pathways into consistently altruistic, intuitive, morally-correct decisions (within the context of his small, well-controlled frontier town) without weakening, is truly inspiring.  The movie's best feature is the verbal interplay between Kurt & his less than perfect, 3-person posse: an old deputy with dementia that is seemingly kept on the payroll for easy, routine, 'go-fer' jobs; a wealthy dapper young man, in dapper clothes, riding a dapper horse confides that he is an expert Indian-killer; and, a young cattle drover who is disabled from a broken leg.  It's his young wife who is kidnapped by a previously unknown, self-isolating, cave-dwelling, cannabalistic tribe...  Loved the script, but the cannibal scene will haunt me like the old 'Wagon Train' episode involving saber tooth tigers!",1455926400,3,981,5.47682119205298

Each character of the party has their own reason for going on the rescue mission.

I wish I didn't have to rate it. One star; five stars. Doesn't matter. Only negative stars would suffice. Please just ignore the rating. It is irrelevant.

Kurt Russell, of course, is a great actor and portrays a soul who is incredibly noble and praiseworthy. I have only praise for his acting and role.

But whoever produced this film--surely you could have portrayed his amazing character in a better light. Seriously, do you really think all of that gore and vileness was necessary? Why do you think we would want want to see something this horrendous? Do you really think we would want to pay good money to see actors cut off a man's scalp and force-feed it to him; then, cut him in half AT HIS LOINS, dump his guts onto the ground with a loud thud and eat him with no regard whatsoever for his humanity? What kind of people do you think we are?!!!!! Such depravity!

7406920,1,B014HDTT84,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

Bone Tomahawk is the creation of one S. Craig Zahler who is listed in Wikipedia as a jack of all trades: ""author, screenwriter, songwriter, musician, director and cinematographer."" Zahler's concoction fits into a literary sub-genre known as ""weird west""again thanks to Wikipedia we learn that this sub-genre ""combines elements of the Western with another literary genre, usually horror, occult, or fantasy.""

Zahler is content to promulgate the myth of a violent, wild west, replete with cowboys armed with six-shooters and rapacious Indians bent on scalping the first settler they see. Unfortunately, the reality is that the so-called wild west was far less violent than what we see today regarding criminal activity. You can find late 19th century photos on the internet from places like Dodge City, sporting billboards that read ""the carrying of firearms is strictly forbidden.""

Zahler's chief desire appears to be out-dueling Tarantino for the coveted most in love with violence writer/director award in American cinema today. Indeed, he begins his magnum opus with Tweedledum and Tweedledee killers, Purvis and Buddy, who murder innocent travelers off the beaten path. Buddy, as you may already know, falls victim to a bunch of Indians who I guarantee did not exist in the 1890s when the film takes place (nor ever existed), and Purvis then makes his way to the town of Bright Hope, which was filmed at the Paramount Ranch.

This location has been used for years as a stand-in for a small, wild western town. Unfortunately, Zahler's low budget prevented his crew from making enough alterations so that the town appears lived in. Zahler trots out a few stock characters including the sheriff Franklin Hunt (decently played by Kurt Russell), his old codger backup deputy, Chicory, and John Brooder, a more intellectual ""ladies man,"" who attempts to summon the town doctor after Hunt shoots bad guy Purvis who can't keep himself from acting up at the local saloon. With the doctor drunk, Brooder finds the doctor's assistant, Samantha, who has just finished a steady bout of lovemaking with her husband Arthur O'Dwyer, a foreman who's laid up in bed with a nasty leg injury.

While Hunt, Chicory and Brooder investigate the murder of a stable hand (the usual ""dispensable"" black guy), Samantha, Hunt's regular deputy Nick and Purvis are found to be missing back at the jail. Instead of summoning help (perhaps in the form of military personnel), Hunt forms an unlikely posse including Chicory and Brooder and is talked into allowing O'Dwyer (who can barely walk with his injured leg) to trek through the wilderness, hoping to locate their missing compatriots. O'Dwyer's love (or should I say lust?) is so great that he's willing to crawl through the desert to find his lost Samantha.

Before they depart, an arrow found at the jail is examined by a local Native American wise man who links it to a place called ""Valley of the Starving Men,"" where a group of troglodytes (cave-dwellers) is probably to blame for the kidnapping of Samantha and the deputy. The wise man (who sounds more like a professor at a local college), advises that the troglodytes are shunned by normal Native Americans and in fact are cannibalistic savages.

The next sequence (which is quite long) involves the posse heading for hostile territory. Along the way, Brooder kills two Mexican scouts and later the group's horses are stolen by rustlers. O'Dwyer re-injures his leg after fighting with Brooder and is left by the rest of the group to recuperate (before insanely trying to rejoin them, again basically crawling through the desert).

I will not detail how exactly the posse ends up imprisoned in the troglodytes' cave but suffice it to say Brooder is the first casualty. While Zahler perhaps technically cannot be accused of racism because he makes it clear that his troglodytes are an ostracized group of Native Americans, the introduction of these characters into the narrative, leaves a bad taste in one's mouth. First of all, these type of ""savages"" were never known to exist in the ""wild west,"" but are still associated here with Native American culture. All disclaimers aside, the mere image of Native Americans perpetrating ghastly acts of savagery on ""white people"" should be enough to upset any Native American when he ponders such ""untruths"" in a darkened movie theater. Of course the reality is that acts of savagery occurred the other way aroundit was the US military of course which was responsible for the great numbers of heinous crimes against the Native American population during the 19th century.

The pointlessness of Zahler's tale reaches its apotheosis when the audience is forced to witness the scalping of Nick the deputy and his dismemberment at the hands of the zombie-like troglodytes. If we must witness such cheap thrills, why doesn't Zahler turn his zombies into a bunch of aliens so that the perpetuation of the myth of the savage ""Indian,"" is repudiated?

Perhaps with the dismemberment scene Zahler has gone toe to toe with Tarantino, and won. In addition to Zahler's apparent victory over the master of gore himself, I am also forced to conclude that Bone Tomahawk defies its internal logic (how does O'Dwyer manage to get himself up into the cave with his injured leg? And why does Samantha remain apparently untouched by the savage troglodytes?)

Is there a more pointless film than Bone Tomahawk among the selection of Spirit Award hopefuls? I don't think so. Not only is it pointless but offensive to boot. See it at your peril!",1455753600,3,5591,5.02049622437972

I say ""at least one"" because I turned it off.

I think what the producers were mainly going for was the shock value as there are some very graphic scenes.

The antagonists were very intimidating.  A word of warning: about an hour and a half into the movie, there is a brutal death scene that is a bit hard to watch.  Not for the squeamish.

Trust me when I say you will not be disappointed.  Kurt Russell is amazing but the standout performance is Richard Jenkins!!  He delivers such a powerful performance which is deceptively downplayed that it isn't until later that you realize he was the glue that helped his group survive (well some of them anyway).  The movie builds slowly giving you time to get to know the characters and it also builds the horror factor because you don't know where it will come from.  As the movie progresses you see that the men are more brave than you can possibly imagine as they race to face an enemy they never imagined in their wildest dreams.  Early on you get a glimpse of what is waiting for them, and so do they, and yet they still go out in an attempt to save two of their own.

Well it is about a short period of time where the good guys find the disappearance of the deputy and good guys wife mysterious and go on a man hunt to find the tribe that was behind it all.  That's it.  They go through some grueling setbacks and the good guys injury actually puts you in pain not to mention how awful it makes the whole story but again you can't stop watching it because you have to find out how this all ends.  I think this would have been better as a 1 hour movie on tv.  And it's not for lack of good acting by Kurt and company.  They did a great job with the little bit they had to work with.  It was the story line and the plot and the long drawn out way they told the story.  If you are bored and have nothing else to watch, you may enjoy this but if you are looking for a great Kurt Russell movie move on to one of his much better films.",1455667200,,1475,3.857142857142857

It had very violent sequences that could easily fall into the horror genre. When I say horror, I mean that moments were intense, the gore was extreme at times, and adversaries were monstrous (behaviorally and somewhat physically). The acting was superb, and the situations were believable and realistic--no superheroes in this one; the characters are vulnerable leaving the viewer wondering who will survive the dilemma. The movie was a little long but only felt slow early. Once the movie got going I never had that feeling again.

The plot concerns the kidnapping of the sheriff's deputy  and a married woman whose husband has a leg injury and is bedridden. It is known that Indians were behind the raid and are identified by an arrow used in the killings of town folk to be a peculiar tribe. A posse is formed, the husband demands to go along to rescue his wife with the sheriff, his older deputy and a dandy who hates Indians and asked how many he had killed and was told not enough. For the next hour or so, the the movie starts to drag, The posse runs into trouble in the night when there horses are stolen and they have to continue on foot. The crippled still continues on with them. They finally reach where the tribe is camped in a cave on a high cliff. They are attacked, captured and the dandy is killed. The sheriff and his deputy are brought into the cave and  caged. Across from them is the woman who is still alive. The next scene is gruesome, they find out this tribe consists of cannibals in a horrifying way of preparing their victims to be cooked and eaten. Needless to say, the ending is not completely done with all being killed, and the woman is rescued and the survivors retunn to their town",1455580800,,1280,4.285123966942149

7407372,1,B014HDTT84,"Lets be real......because this movie sure isn't.  I decided to watch it because I love westerns and Kurt Russell is a draw, especially after his excellent portrayal as Wyatt Earp in Tombstone, and I wasn't disappointed in his acting as a sheriff in this movie....but the story and the plot, egad, the writer must have gotten his idea from a double dose of LSD, or at least while eating several bushels of Denver cookies!!  I mean, Yuck!!  His aborigine people eaters who delight in taking a good scalp before dinner, look and sound like ""The Predator.""  How original is that!!!  In one scene where seconds before the sherif's deputy is being stripped, scalped, held upside down, and halved, the sherif (Kurt Russell) watching with horror from his cave cell behind primitive bars, true to the script shouts,  not to worry, ""the calvary's coming,"" just before the axe falls cutting the deputy completely in half.  You've heard of ""half a beef""? well......., now imagine this, you're high up in a cave in the middle of nowhere, held upside down by a couple of cannibals, naked, scalped, about to be cut in half, and your friend shouts not to worry, the calvary's coming!!  I mean, you gotta feel guilty knowing it's a downright shame to laugh watching a scene like that!!  And why does everybody have a dull knife?  Every time someone is cutting out a larynx, or just plain slitting, it takes forever for the knife to do its job....Good for letting us see a bunch of blood and gore and to imagine the pain, but didn't they believe in sharpening stuff back then?  The script writer does show that he is knowledgeable however, and a man of facts, when after a bad guy slits a throat he asks, ""How come they always wet themselves?""  See, most people don't even know that, but by golly the writer wants us all to know that he does and is not some ignorant person!!  Like a good country song that just has to have women, whiskey and trains in it, this movie has a little something for everyone, a little sex, a pinch of  humour, a touch of drama, lots of bloody gore, and absolutely no reality.  But not wanting to appear unjust or closed minded, I have given it a gold star.  :)",1455580800,,2171,4.528205128205128

I'm a big fan of the horror genre, so I was interested to see Bone Tomahawk when it turned up on Amazon Video.

I can't put my finger on exactly why I was disappointed. The movie just didn't seem to develop compulsive momentum -- it just ""mosey-ed"" along to it's dramatic conclusion, and then was over. The characters were, by and large, well-cast, but seemed to grow hum-drum during the long, long center portion of the movie (the horse ride of the posse). Then, suddenly, the action peaked and it was over.

Seems like the writers could have told the story better; built the suspense more steadily; and built to the finale more methodically.

Didn't make my top 20 by any measure.",1455580800,,730,4.549618320610687

Kurt Russell as a Western Sheriff?  Where do I sign up?
This film is rather unique where it lets the story kind of play out and let the actors do their jobs.  The script is spoken in eloquent 19th century prose.and the sets and locations are the tried and true Paramount ranch sets.  So this film accomplishes so much on a low budget.  It is a ""posse"" quest film but takes some twists and turns.  I almost gave it 4 stars due to some gruesome violence in the final act that would rival a Saw film.  But I changed my mind because there was a serious effort to make this movie the old fashioned way so they earned 5 stars.

The production had a little feel of a ""Breaking Bad"" episode (eg, the capture of Russell and his assistant deputy at the opening of the ""troglodytes' "" entrance) with a little Q. Tarantino mixed in--like , how miraculous was that leg recovery of Mr. O'Dowd's?

Maybe an old western version of Escape from NY,  I had no idea about the movie's story line--I just saw Kurt on the box cover and played it via Amazon Prime.  Don't let your kids see this one before you do.  Fortunately, my kids are in their 30's.

The cave scenes were, purposefully, over the top; while some of it worked, the butchery--literally--of the younger deputy was too --what???  The gang members were also clearly Gentile.

Brilliant? No.  Hilarious in places? Yes.  I'd love to know if the gang of deviant Indians was a pure contrivance or if they actually had a historical link somewhere.",1455580800,,1016,4.583333333333333

7407807,4,B014HDTT84,This is a good western between the Western world and Indian nations with a different twist to the typical western stories.  Not the best acting in the world and the story feels a little rushed with no real character development on the indians and western folks.

As I'd hoped, the dialog sounds authentically archaic and manages to be witty and believable but as the film moves into some genuinely chilling sequences, the graphic violence just became too extreme for me.

7407910,5,B014HDTT84,"I loved this movie and it was nothing like I thought it was going to be. There are some slow and deliberate parts in this movie. Is it dull? No way. Even in the quieter moments when the men are just walking along or sitting by the campfire, the dialogue takes over. A little wit, a little humor, some serious business and a little violence from time to time. Richard Jenkins plays the backup Deputy, Chicory, to Kurt Russell's Sherriff, Hunt. Chicory is an old timer who has a story for everything and continues to talk, ask questions or offers his opinions throughout the movie. Much to the chagrin of some of the other party members. Kurt Russell is on his game here and Jenkins steals his thunder. But don't underestimate the performances of Patrick Wilson (Arthur O'Dwyer) and Matthew Fox as Brooder. The movie starts out violent. Sid Haig and David Arquette open things up at a camp sight with Arquette using his knife to cut open a campers neck. The crunching sound of his knife through flesh is the first thing you hear. From there they stumble upon a burial site. Most likely Indian. They are on the run after killing the campers so they end up in a bad place. After one is killed violently, the other ends up in the Sherriff's jail cell. Patrick Wilsons wife attends to a bullet in the prisoners leg while being watched by the true Deputy, Nick, played by Evan Jonigkeit. When morning rolls around Wilson, who has a broken leg, it is important, notices his wife isn't home. Then a stable boy shows up dead. The prisoner, Deputy Nick and O'Dwyer's wife are all missing. Abducted. O'Dwyer, Sherriff Hunt, Brooder and the vocal Backup Deputy, Chicory head out on a trip to find the missing. After showing an arrow to a local expert on Indians, they have a position to look for the missing. Things are not what they seem, trust me. What they end up seeing and experiencing once there, is completely beyond what you would will be expecting. It is violent, extremely violent and bloody. There are some extremely disturbing images once they show what happens inside the kidnappers cave. One characters ending is just repulsive. And another's is not as bad but disgusting for sure. If you like westerns but not horror, then don't watch. If you can deal with whatever a movie can show you, then this is it. I loved this movie. Give it a chance as long as you know what to expect as far as violence and blood is concerned.",1455494400,,2421,4.5423340961098395

Let me preface this by saying that I clicked on this film by accident.  I meant to hit ""Inside Man"" but this cued up instead so I thought I'd give it it's day in court.  WooHoo! So glad I did!

It looked like a western, sounded like a western, but delivered like a Cormac McCarthy novel.  Craig Zahler is a genius (and a freak in a really good way).  He wrote this, directed this, and made me a FAN!

Bone Tomahawk moves like a cat from beginning to end.  I had some idea where it was going but wasn't expecting to be entertained to such a high level and I never expected such glorious gore delivery.

I could kiss whomever is responsible for this  dialogue.  Richard Jenkins nails it every time he opens his mouth.  Kurt Russell's dead-pan delivery made me feel a tad wicked for giggling through some of the nastier stuff but every word was a pleasure.

So sad that ""Saucy"" was collateral damage ( she was a nice looking mare) but the rest of the blood-n-gore was terrific!  The kill scenes alone  were worth the price of admission and the maiming stuff was off the hook.

7407964,4,B014HDTT84,"Remember when intelligent screenplays were the basis for films? Bone Tomahawk is a pleasant throwback to those mostly-bygone days. Kurt Russell leads an outstanding ensemble cast in this modestly-budgeted, script-driven tale of heroism and loss in the Old West. Russell seems born to play Sheriff Hunt, the no-nonsense but all-too human lawman who is charged with assembling a posse to rescue kidnapped townspeople from a nearly extinct tribe of cannibalistic Native Americans. Russell conveys the pathos of leading a seemingly-doomed mission in true old-school fashion, with few words and a heavy gun hand. The supporting cast is nothing less than outstanding with veteran actor Richard Jenkins the standout as the verbose and largely ineffectual ""back-up deputy"" Chicory. The limits of our heroes' endurance, morality and cunning are tested on their journey and the plot spirals into a shockingly violent and gory conclusion. The presence of A-level talent like Russell and Patrick Wilson is a testament to the quality of this production, and I only hesitate to award this film five stars because the limited budget seems to hold it back from becoming the sprawling, Dances With Wolves-style epic that it so narrowly misses being. Support this film and send Hollywood a message: give us smart movies again, we deserve it after putting up with the last three decades of your over-budgeted, under-scripted garbage.",1455235200,4,1414,5.345291479820628

I have seen all kinds of westerns, my dad is an aficionado of them. I have seen really good and really bad. This one rates on the good side. Kurt Russell is great as the Sheriff, his deputy tho takes the cake, awesome character and he is played well.
The whole plot and premise of the story intrigued me and I don't want to give anything away. If you are a fan of western & horror, or suspense, I think you will enjoy this movie. Set in the western town of Bright Hope, a little town where the people have big dreams.
You will find a lot of violence, it is a western set in the old west after all. The people who rated this low because of violence, have no common sense. A title like ""Bone Tomahawk"", should imply that there will be violence. Besides the setting calls for it, and tho it is more graphic than other westerns, it fits the bill of what is going on.

Kurt Russell's great, and the relationship between Patrick Wilson and Lili Simmons is cool.

It feels low budget at times, mostly because of the small cast and small sets, and in the end when you finally meet the horrible villains starts to feel a little monster-of-the week.

7408008,4,B014HDTT84,"I have watched a lot of movies over the years, as I assume you all have as well... This was somewhat of a nice reminder how with correct dialog and camera angles a director can create suspense and intrigue even when it is just a simple scene. It was somewhat gruesome, but that helped with the reality of those times (not that this was ever a possible story, but in the fact that life was pretty fragile in those times.)  There are some cheesy parts, but overall a very well made movie especially since lately i have not been very impressed with the movie making industry.

7408017,5,B014HDTT84,""" Wow "" , I do not understand criticisms of this movie. The negative one's I should clarify. Excellent characters, great performances and gritty realism make this a classic for me. The odds were against them from the outset and this did not deter them from their mission. It has a level of character study that in places reminds me of the vibe of Eastwoods  Unforgiven. Although less space between pivotal moments. This is no dig because Unforgiven was the movie that separated my initial love of all things Western to my actual involvement with the whole of the experiences'. Meaning for me it did not have to be lead flying all movie long any more. Bone Tomahawk offers more overall action than Unforgiven yet is tempered by really telling the whole story. Great film, at least watch it once and decide for yourself. I purchased it and can not wait to see it again.  Nice ending as well because you really are not sure what will transpire .

7408040,4,B014HDTT84,"Watched a weird movie on Amazon last night.  It was called Bone Tomahawk.  Check out the preview sometime.  I had never heard of it but it stared Kurt Russel and had Matthew Fox and David Arquette and Patrick Wilson.  I don't know the actors in the movie by name except for Kurt and David but I could recognize them as I have seen them before in many movies.  It also had a pretty lady in it, her name was Lili SImmons, I think.  It sort of reminded me of Cowboys and Aliens, But only a very teeny tiny bit, very teeny tiny bit.  I can't say it was a bad movie, just, an odd, weird, gross and somewhat graphic movie.  I really think they didn't need to be so graphic and gross and show all of what they showed but it does have a story to tell.  A made up gross story.  Spoiler ALERT!  ""think Cannibals""
  SO I'm not really sure if I liked it or not.  I think for the most part I did like it.
  I takes place in the wild-west during the cowboy days, and these bad murderous thieves get the attention of some cannibalistic animal people.  ..not good.  So the law, Sheriff Kurt and his posse, go out in pursuit of. well, I'm getting ahead of myself.  They do go out and have to pursue one bad guy and some other along with the damsel, hot looking doctor woman, and bring them back.

  like I said, I don't know yet if I liked it because of all the graphic, sick stuff they showed that wasn't needed (in my opinion) but it was something I watched.  Fairly good story and good acting I think and even had nice scenes as in filming locations and making it look like the wild  type of west.

  Can't  give it a thumbs up or down right now, and don't know if it's rate-able but it is something. Without the sick gross stuff, it's good I think. It is a little slow compared to today's action movies but it is a western sort of moive.

The attention to detail, not just costume design but set design that included the things that you would have found but overlooked in most movies like the fitting doors and floor boards that don't actually close anything out, was fantastic. The cinematography, particularly shots where travel on horseback was involved, was amazing  but with backdrops like that there was a lot to work with. Still, that the effort was put into the production aspect of the film is rewarding for the viewer when you get to watch this movie in high definition.

The directing was excellent. The movie started slow but I felt that set the mood well. This is not your average western which becomes apparent soon enough and the excitement and tension increase from there. Unpredictable also and novel. The STORY was compelling. The major problem I have with this movie came near the end. I do not understand what all the hullabaloo about guns was regarding this movie because it's a western for pete's sake so expect shooting and dying. I don't even have a problem with the story premise. My problem with this movie was how graphically the premise was illustrated which I felt was way over the top and disgusting. Be careful what you let into your head because once it's in there, you will never get it out. Now I'll have those images and  sounds in my head forever. I had to close my eyes for a while. I considered turning it off at that point but it was so near the end that I felt the director probably already made his point and wouldn't harry it to death and I wanted to see how the characters ended up. If you are sensitive at all to disgusting gore, without giving away the premise, you may want to reconsider or ask somebody else who watched it and who knows you to advise whether you should watch it. I'm a little angry that such a wonderful movie contained such disgustingly graphic imagery. Too bad because that spoiled it for me. I hope Kurt Russel plays in another movie soon.

Kurt Russell is a great actor, but this is a total POS. Do not buy it. Horrid script, writing, story. I mean they didn't even capitalize on the ridiculous central theme.

When I read a review that said this movie is a The Searchers-meets-Texas Chain Saw mash up my husband said Oh we gotta watch it!

I only agreed because it has Kurt in it.

Id say it is more The Searchers -meets- ALL of Clint Eastwoods spaghetti westerns- meets- Texas Chain Saw-meets- The Walking Dead and I regretted watching it. I haven't had nightmares like I did last night since I was in my teens and watching the slasher flix at the drive-in. Theres one scene that is going to stay with me for a l*o*n*g time.

Watch this ONLY IF you are into gory horror and can walk away from it after you turn it off.

7408357,2,B014HDTT84,"Think The Hills Have Eyes meets a 90's style western. Lots of violence and gore. Decent performances from the Kurt Russel and Matthew Fox. The plot was mostly lacking - monstrous cannibals who live in a hill which is apparently close enough to a civilized town for them to raid the city, yet somehow this has never happened prior to the events of this movie. They come to take a drifter, who escaped them previous, who was in custody, as well as a deputy and the town doctor, a woman (a bit out of place for the time period). The cannibals are supposed to be natives to the Americas, but they look like fat, pasty, white dudes with some bad makeup on them. Despite three members of the city having been attacked by a settlement of cannibals, only  4 men, one of whom is seriously injured, set out to attempt to retrieve the 3 people taken hostage.

The language I suppose is appropriate to the time period and adds to the flavor; there is little to dislike here. I don't know how realistic it would be to find ""cave dwellers"" living a stone-age lifestyle in the time period depicted in the movie, but it sure makes for a very interesting and different ""cowboy and Indians"" movie!

7408469,3,B014HDTT84,For the actors in this movie I was expecting much better. Its not a bad movie but there is a very long section of the 4 guys heading out on the rescue mission and all the action is crammed in the last 15 minutes. Also a little unrealistic on how a guy with a compound fractured leg manages to make that long journey let alone become the one who miraculously wipes out many of the Indians singlehandedly.,1454630400,,403,4.246753246753247

Basic plot...some townspeople get kidnapped by natives who live a five days journey away. A posse goes out to rescue them. The natives happen to be extremely violent, demonic seeming, inhuman, and they eat people. Up close an personal of them scalping a man and stuffing it in his mouth, flipping him upside down, and cutting him from groin to neckline as he defecates all over himself.

I will say the violence is not for the faint of heart (which may include me). Seriously, this film has some of the scariest horror ""monsters"" in cinema history.

Obviously the night scenes need to be dark, but even the daytime scenes were difficult to watch and lacking in contrast.

Also, some might interpret the film as being anti-American Indian in a grotesque portrayal. I can understand that, but beyond that - I think it plays along a couple more interesting levels. Firstly, again, it's partly a horror story - and in a horror story, you never know that much about the monster. That's why it's scary. Secondly, I think it might be a good insight as to what white people feared most about the native peoples - and in the white persons retelling of experiences with the native Americans, those who listen could and would imagine the most horrifying of pictures in their heads. It's a pretty good movie, if you can look at it on those interpretive lines. And of course, as always, Kurt Russel is his awesome self.",1454544000,,955,4.690476190476191

The only thing they could do for hom was to tie two brances to his leg and give him another tree limb to use as a crutch.  He continues to accompany the possy, but falls behind.  The sheriff and the others track the savages to their lair, where they find some primieval like beings with strange apparatuses inserted into their larynx' that enables them to make some very odd screeching noises.  Oh, and these savages are cannibals.  And did I mention that this is a Western?  There is more weirdness, but I don't want to spoil it for you.

I think that if he were to break away from that stereotype, he will be much more believable.  The supporting cast needed more depth.  Matthew Fox was hard to watch in this movie.

There are scenes that are  uncomfortably violent and the camera captures them with an unflinching clinical gaze reminiscent of films such as men behind the sun.

The filmmakers achieved a good lived-in feel to the story, with lives and relationships in progress. The lead actors all do a solid job, even if there are hints os stereotypes around them. I think Chicory is a fantastic character with more depth than any of the others. But the foes all being Indian (even if an aberration), Mexican, and hardscrabble Euro-Americans was annoying, even though they tried to insert some dialogue to ameliorate it. This contributed to the plot feeling tiresome and predictable. The music was terrific, understated but resonant with the visuals. But there are no surprises as the movie converges on its endpoint.

It gets mighty dark at the end, but the build up is a slow and meaningful burn between four travelers on the hunt for some pretty tribal and quite disturbing natives. This isn't your fathers western.

I might have given this two stars, but I am awarding one for originality and effort...and the chance to see Kurt Russell in a Western again.  In my opinion,  a similar and much better take on the ""low budget, high-concept Horror Western"" is the film, ""The Burrowers"" featuring a strong cast of character actors - Clancy Brown, David Busse, Doug Hutchison (everyone's favorite A-hole from ""The Green Mile"") and Tom Cruise's cousin William Mapother.

Please ""NO CHILDREN"" should ever see that scene...the violence is EXTREME and far too GRAPHIC! ......NOT A FAMILY MOVIE!
I love Kurt Russel films but I have to say this is a real stinker of a movie which is actually slow paced, boring, confusing at times and should be avoided.
 Rent Used Cars or The Thing instead (not for children) these movies are great but also for mature audiences. Used Cars is a comedy...

7409000,1,B014HDTT84,"The deserts of the American Southwest were, and still are, very scary and dangerous places, even more so when two bumbling idiots named Purvis (David Arquette) and Buddy (Sid Haig) stumble their way upon the hunting grounds and the sacred stone circle of something not quite human living out there. Eleven days later, Purvis arrives in the small town of Bright Hope and is confronted by Sheriff Hunt (Kurt Russell) after Purvis is seen burying luggage out in the desert by Assistant Deputy Chicory (Richard Jenkins). Purvis is shot trying to escape. While he is being treated for the wound late that night in the jail cell by Samantha ODwyer (Lili Simmons), whatever attacked him and Buddy kidnaps Samantha, Purvis and, Deputy Nick (Evan Jonigkeit) as well as stealing six horses from a nearby stable and killing and gutting the stable boy.

Samanthas husband, Arthur (Patrick Wilson), is suffering from a broken leg but insists on joining the search and rescue for his wife. Sheriff Hunt, Chicory, Gentleman John Broody (Matthew Fox), and Arthur ODwyer head out. The remainder of the film is devoted to tracking down the beings which we are told are a tribe of troglodytes by a local Native man. Hes willing to show them on a map where they can find the cave of these creatures, but hes unwilling to go with the posse to rescue anyone.

Oh, the potential! I really enjoy a good western and its no secret Im a huge fan of the horror genre, but this. Ugh. This was not a good western nor was its potential to be an amazing horror film at all met. The scene with the Mayor and his wife was farcical and irrelevant. Way too much time was spent dwelling on the very, very dull trek to the cave itself. Zahn McClarnons role as Native known as The Professor could have been so much more interesting, instead it was brief and brushed aside, used as a mere information dump instead of actually having any depth and meaning to it. It could have been used to heighten the suspense, to give us an idea what sort of evil madness our intrepid team was walking into. Instead, no, were merely told they will be facing dangerous, inbred cave dwellers.

When we finally get to meet our gruesome enemy, they just wander about their caves, call to each other in what appears to be some sort of paranormal howling-scream, go out and kill or capture for their own heinous reasons whoever happens to come along, and to steal horses. We never do find out what happens to all the horses they are taking. There is one particularly nasty scene in the cave in which Deputy Nick meets his demise which is not for the squeamish.

Even with its simplistic plot, this film could have been done better, A LOT better. It wasn't dark enough (in a psychological way), it dragged on needlessly, too many questions were left unanswered, and the character roles were shallow and uninteresting.

1 out of 5 stars for Deputy Nicks shocking death scene!",1454544000,,2912,4.624758220502901

The Cast must of worked for Union Scale , because most of the extras are used in a couple of scenes an then disappear . Also the dialogue too seem made up as it went along mainly by Jenkins who steals the film as the Deputy and  Kurt Russell plays the Sherriff  . This film could had been edited  down some but still keeps you watching . As they get closer to this cannibal tribe , they run into a few skirmishes  with Thieves . This isn't a bad Western  but it does get a bit gory . If anyone out there ever ate steamed crabs and opened one , then the sound when you open a shell is a sound you hear in that cave when a other Deputy meets his end . This film also stars Matthew Fox from Lost as a Indian Killer. If your a fan of Westerns from the 50's , You won't like it but if you can handle some gore and violence you will like it .This is a low budget sleeper.

7409252,2,B014HDTT84,"Reminded me of Michael Crichton's Eaters of the Dead (The 13th Warrior) with a Western twist & horrific gore. Kurt Russell is a small town sheriff who, together with Patrick Wilson, Matthew Fox & Richard Jenkins, sets out to rescue two town residents who have been kidnapped. Unfortunately, Native Americans are depicted as a cult of bizarre cannibals who have mutilated their bodies and who go so far as to blind and amputate all limbs from females who are pregnant. This combined with the unspeakable acts perpetrated upon their human prey while still alive makes for an extremely disturbing & graphic movie. I've watched the Saw series and The Ring but this movie is worse, so be prepared.

On a lighter note, the movie has an atmosphere of semi-Monty Pythonishness where politeness & social niceties are maintained regardless of circumstance, so the odd bits of levity add a quirky nuance. Stellar performances by the movie's great cast, particularly Matthew Fox, adds to the temptation to continue watching it despite its grim and nauseating scenes. I cannot imagine how the producers were able to lure the cast to make this movie except perhaps if they left out that horrific slaughtering scene so the actors were unaware just how repulsive the movie would actually turn out.",1454371200,2,1281,4.985981308411215

7409272,5,B014HDTT84,"This will be a cult film, no question about it.  Beautifully non-Hollywood, it's a film which took me by complete surprise.  Wonderfully written with some of the most fantastic dialogue I've seen in a film in decades (owing in no small part I'd imagine to the director being the author).  An Old West yarn turned thriller/horror with a small bit of black humor.  Refreshingly absent of the cliche film techniques and methods, it's a wonderful breath of fresh air.  Slightly absurdist but easily enjoyable.  If you're looking for an action-junkie modern film, this may not be the one for you.

Special note: Richard Jenkins puts on an absolute clinic with his portrayal of Chicory, the lovingly obtuse aging ""back up Deputy"".  This is a film which makes no concessions to standard film methods/pacing and does not modernize its language or characters to suit modern audiences.  This is its strength.

Story is an interesting twist on classic Cowboys and Indians tale. Think 'The 13th Warrior' meets the old West.  A bit long on the 'arduous journey' phase (we get it, traveling on foot thru the Southwestern desert  while injured is hard), and the characters are textbook although well played. Comedic lines delivered by the ""Assistand Deputy Sheriff"" help break the monotony and somber mood, but are subtle and feel authenic. The gruesome scene towards the end is enough shock value to make the movie memorable.

7409357,4,B014HDTT84,"No two ways about it -- this is a western/horror hybrid, and it's disingenuous of Amazon not to give it the Horror tag. If you LIKE the idea of an unflinching western/horror hybrid, read no further and dive right in. Seriously, go enjoy what's about to unfold and don't let the following spoil anything for you.

If you're unsure, know this: you need to enjoy both genres or you're going to be uncomfortable. It's not ""western with a dose of human flesh nibbling for gritty realism,"" or ""jumpscare-n-redsyrup horror in period costume.""

The first half is all modern Real West western -- leisurely unfolding of routine events, each character with a different kind of hat as the first signal that they're all interesting characters, time on the trail to create friction, challenges to create bonds, and a deep cast of professionals making the pace worthwhile. The second half is unflinching torture/body horror. Chekov's Gun is right there in the title.

7409439,5,B014HDTT84,"This is a superb movie in that it shows how ridiculous the falsely held notion that the white people were the plundering, pillaging murderers that killed off so many ""peaceful"" Indian Tribes. I am 1/4 Cheokee and have always found that a  one sided view. The Cherokees got along with most of the new people to the Americas and their bloodline is the largest running through the veins of present day Americans out of the five tribe nation. Many tribes were extremely savage, and indeed would torture, kill and sometimes eat other tribes. When people headed West which was more so after The Civil War , they were looking to avoid Indians , as much as possible. America had already been a country for nearly 100 years. Okay, long story short, some of The tribes were insanely brutal and would kill as many settlers as possible. This movie brings this long arduous journey to save the captives , to our viewpoint where we could feel like we were along for the journey. A very scary journey when they finally meet these human creatures! I saw an interview a few weeks ago with a Leftist television station where the commentator was visibly upset about the violence in the film . Kurt Rusell said that the movie depicted a reality and that is one job and beauty of the world of cinema. The commentator also mentioned that there was some controversy surrounding the film. After viewing this today,  I see what The Liberals were spinning their heads around over in the depiction of the natives in this film. Oh my!!! So, not all of the Indigenous people were not all sitting around in a circle smoking peace pipes, having rain dances, hunting , gathering and minding their own business, as The Liberals desperately want to have us believe. The two pregnant women lying down blinded with huge stones in their eyes told the story of how these people felt about the women. The women were merely breeding machines, most likely to be roasted over the flames themselves after menopause. In 2016 , we need to see all the sides to a story more than ever when people of Caucasian backgrounds are constantly being portrayed in Universities and The Media as the evildoers!",1454198400,,2153,4.663157894736842

Kurt Russell as always gives us the veteran performance we would expect, however the writing wasn't worthy of it.  There is no reason for being in this moment other than you are just abandoned in this place and time wondering your own history.  A brief description of the why and the where is given by an American Indian who appears momentarily and after he sets an extremely vague narrative and the word ""Troglodyte"" then you are back in mist.

Make no mistake about it, this is a horror film and if that is not your genre then you will not be happy with this film.  I will say it is a horror film in the since that there were a couple of scenes that were very over the top and gut wrenching (not for the meek), but thats how horror films go these day.  The suspense was OK but definitely not a suspense driven film but enough to hold your attention.  The film is several steps above your typical slasher film containing more film value than just scene followed by scene of more and more horrible events.  There is a decent story going on which elevates it above the average slasher film.  Some other reviews seemed to attack the films believability, but I don't think you should be looking for a believable story line in a horror movie.

7409801,5,B014HDTT84,"Great old western vibe with perfect horror mixing in.  If you like Kurt Russell, westerns, tension, genre mashups, and great dialogue - this is for you.  However, if you are squeamish (there are only 2 scenes at the end totaling about 1 minute) be warned - when you think something horrible is about to happen IT IS.  Close your eyes.  These two tiny scenes were extremely realistic and disturbing.",1454025600,,398,4.72463768115942
7409802,5,B014HDTT84,"This is the best horror-western I've seen since Deadbirds. It's a well-written, finely-acted slow burn story with witty dialogue, great characters, and a third act attack full of gruesome gore, genuinely frightening moments, and glorious fight scenes. Film critic Scott Weinberg's assessment that it's ""The Searchers meets the Hills Have Eyes"" is pretty dead on. There's just enough originality in the writing department to make this beast it's own brand. S. Craig Zahler is immensely talented and I can't wait to see what he cooks up next. I won't give anything away here, but the bad guys are seriously terrifying. The dusty mountain scape scenery is beautifully evocative of every good western you've seen. Kurt Russell is a laid back badass. Patrick Wilson brings so much life to his stubborn, hopelessly devoted husband on a mission - he's hobblin' and limpin' around most of the movie but it's great. Last but not least, Richard Jenkins is a total riot as our senior citizen assistant deputy ""Chicory"". He's got some of the flick's funniest lines, and his performance is, at times, comic gold. Anyone who'd just write off Bone Tomahawk as ""dull"" or ""slow"" or ""tedious"" must have had some crazy expectations of what the film should deliver. Go into it expecting a well-told Western slow burn with one helluva mean third act, held together by some great cast and great gore and you'll be entertained. I'm going to add this to my collection ASAP - it's definitely a repeater. Oh, and as with most slow burn horror, watch this alone. In the dark. And late at night for maximum fear effect.",1454025600,,1591,4.874538745387454
7409803,2,B014HDTT84,I love Kurt Russel as an actor. This is why I picked this movie. The movie it self is slow moving in plot. It was hard to follow in some scenes.

At first I thought it would be another ""Indians steal the girl, and fearless lawman and his posse retrieves the girl and saves the day"" kind of movie. Believe me, it wasn't that at all. These Indians were something straight from hell, and you have never seen anything like these guys before.

The characters are very well defined, the movie is slow but not slow, meaning not a lot of action until the end but I never was bored. This isn't a normal movie, the interaction between the characters and the way it is directed is different, but I like it a lot. Kurt Russell is one of my favorite actors.

This is one of the most brutal movies I've ever seen. It comes across as a Western, but I would classify it as a ""Horror Western."" There are several scenes that have stayed with me for days and one in particular that I may never be able to completely forget. As they say, once you have seen something, you can never really un-see it.

The dialogue is stilted to modern ears, but well represents 19th century verbal cadences.  The savages are savage indeed, and one scene was very difficult to watch.  I don't know enough about the frontier to know if any groups like this actually existed in America, and something in me is uncomfortable with the portrayal of any indigenous people groups as so sub-human.

This movie is somewhat bizarre, but that's kind of the norm in movies these days.
I'm a sucker for westerns with American Indian influences, and even though the Indians depicted here were not your run of the mill, the plot was suspenseful, the acting was creditable and the movie was entertaining for me.
Maybe because it turned out not to be what I suspected. Without giving away too much, there were elements of a horror- which is not usually my first choice. It was balanced with what seemed like realistic behavior by the characters, true to the period and environment.

It has the most absurd plot, the most insipid dialogue, the most implausible portrayal of the times. It could only appeal to those who like gratuitous sex scenes coupled with violence and gore for the sake of violence and gore. I feel sorry for Mr. Russell who must be lacking in offerings to not only  have read the script , but to actually take the role. The directing is done by a wanna-be Quentin Tarantino who does a dreadful imitation of his genre. The most unbelievable aspect of this ""film"" outside of the tribe of cave dwellers who are listed as cannibals/Indians who no one seems to know their location or much about them, and are found to be accessible by a long lowered rope is that one character has a broken ankle at the start of the movie, proceeds with the posse to save his kidnapped wife from the aforementioned savages; has his horse stolen, and then proceeds to walk all the distance over rugged territory and somewhat keeps up with the rest of the posse with this broken ankle. One scene shows the other posse members resetting the bone after he fell, much to the man's agony, yet he carries on to eventually rescue the survivors. How he managed to do all this defies any plausibility that I can conceive. If they showed  this ""film"" at Guantanamo Bay to the prisoners, the Red Cross would have us up for cruel and inhuman treatment.

7410339,3,B014HDTT84,"Dont quite have the energy for a lengthy review at this point, but ill try to give the cliff-notes version:

1. While Kurt Russel and the older guy helped give the movie a 'western"" feel, others- like the guy from lost and the crippled husband- were really too well-known to be able to take seriously in the roles. Theyd have been better off casting some talented no-name actors if they wanted it to be a more impactful performance. The entire movie I just kept thinking ""Yup....thats Matthew Fox in a moustache. Sure is. Is that David Arquette with blackened teeth? Yes...that is indeed David Arquette with blackened teeth.""

2. The pacing is kind of weird. Especially towards the end and the last scene. When the screen went black, I actually said ""Theres no way thats the end..."". A scene of a rock in mud? I don't expect to see the happy couple back at home and everything tied neatly in a bow, but something more substantial than a rock in mud wouldve seemed like a given to me if I were in charge of this film.

3. While some of the effects were especially good (like the....*ahem*....""barbecue"" scene in the last 1/4 of the movie- some of the other effects were just laughably bad. Im not sure if that was by design- to pay homage to the campy B-movies of yesteryear. It just seemed super out of place and rather jarring when some of the practical effects were so solid, and the others were so obviously poorly done.

One of the reviewers mentioned it having sort of a ""The Hills Have Eyes"" horr type vibe. I could sort of agree with that. But The Hills Have Eyes had kind of a consistent tone all the way through. This movie seemed stuck between wanting to be a gritty, authentic-type westen (like my beloved Lonesome Dove), and a horror flick- doing neither particularly well. Now Im not a snooty film critic by any means, but I still got the distinct feeling that this movie missed the mark in many ways. I don't know where all those 5-star ratings are coming from. Even 4 is probably generous. 3.5 is more like it.

So- its certainly worth watching if youve got a couple of hours to kill. But having just finished the movie, I find myself wishing id have chanced upon ANYTHING more gratifying than the 2 hours I just sat through.",1453680000,,2240,4.480392156862745

A lot of people, apparently, have stated how ""gross"" or ""put-off"" they were by a few scenes, which, I fully admit, were pretty graphic. However, in my opinion, these scenes added to the brutality of the unforeseen situation in which the main characters (as well as the audience) found themselves. After all, we're dealing with savage cannibals here; there are no napkins, cups of tea, or any kind of table manners involved. In other words, the savagery was expected.
I thought the story was a little different and original. It isn't every day (or year) you come across what appears to be a traditional western and end up with creepy cannibals in a cave.
Highly recommended for people who like something different and don't mind a couple of graphic scenes. Also highly recommended for anyone who is a Kurt Russell fan.",1453680000,,1046,4.569148936170213

7410354,5,B014HDTT84,Good period dialogue and solid acting in this old West revision of the Sawney Beane story. Action is measured as are the jump scares. Kurt Russell brings a level of clipped professionalism to not only his role but the entire production and every supporting actor is commendable.,1453680000,,278,4.9361702127659575

I will watch it again to see if I missed anything of importance but I doubt it.  You'd think there would be much more prevalence of the ""bone tomahawk"" than there was.

7410359,4,B014HDTT84,"Although the plot of this movie is certainly not very original (basic kidnap and rescue, with some creepy adders and significantly more blood and gore), the acting is excellent by the entire cast, particularly by Kurt Russell. A lot of his roles in his younger days were types (see Escape from New York (ca. 1980)  (""Snake Plissken!! I thought you were dead!"")). Now, he has settled into a more mature and thoughtful mode of acting, which adds a lot more depth to his characterizations. In other words, you can more readily identify with, sympathize with, and even like his character. Maybe Snake Plissken is really dead after all, which would be good news for Kurt Russell.

But while the plot is not new, this and other modern westerns have abandoned the stock good guy/bad guy dichotomy that was central to the genre from the 1950s onward. The old westerns portrayed a ""West"" that was essentially a kind of post-war suburbia set back in time by 80 or so years and without all the new kitchen appliances. Bone Tomahawk is very much in the current western genre, one that depicts the Wild West in a way that is much more gritty and realistic.

This film would really stand out if the plot had some unexpected twists and turns, but it doesn't include those. Still, the acting makes it much more than the ordinary run of the mill western. All in all, an enjoyable, if somewhat gory, western.",1453680000,,1390,4.642276422764228

Scalping the man, then pounding a stick into his mouth, then completely mangling the man's genitals, poop running down his crack, all to split the man in half like an animal was absolutely disgusting and the last straw in making the movie absolutely horrid!

For an example of cheap-o low-value production values:  Kurt Russell's character is seen in his house interacting with his wife.  Clearly visible in every shot of this home is a wood-burning cook stove.  Sitting atop this stove is a CHAMBER POT!!!  That's right!  In ever shot of Russell's character's house, we get to ponder over why this couple keep their urinal on top of their stove.

But this, this is something else.
No spoilers here, I promise, but at the 3/4's point in the film the ""horror"" kicks in and there is a scene of torture, mutilation and murder (of an innocent) that will likely never leave my mind. It is so believably filmed with special effects and a stunning performance by the young actor, that it became traumatic and unforgettable... but in a way that I truly wish I could forget.

7410560,3,B014HDTT84,"Having read no reviews I watched this as I am a fan of Western movies and I like Kurt Russell. I had no idea what to expect. It wasn't a great Western movie, but it was a decent horror movie in an era of really terrible horror movies. The grittiness of the characters was difficult to believe, not because people who lived in the old west weren't tough, but because people outside of special forces aren't generally tough enough to persevere when the odds are increasingly stacked against them.

SPOILER_ Stop Reading here if you haven't watched it.

I find the hardest part to believe is the fact that a beautiful woman was abducted by savages for several days and was unscathed at the end. They were savage enough to maim their breeders (which by the way the main characters left to die slowly by starvation, who's the savage now?), but left this captive woman intact and untouched? It would have been more believable if she hadn't survived or had been at least severely injured, leaving the husband in a rage to finish off the clan. Another note, 3 healthy men couldn't make it to the cave without being killed or injured, yet a crippled man could, even though one savage had him 'dead to rights' while he was sleeping and missed him with an arrow from 10 ft. away. That had to be the worst action sequence scene of the entire movie. At least wing him to make it more believable.

7410578,4,B014HDTT84,"I really liked this film, but it's not for everyone.  The plot is pretty similar to the John Ford classic ""The Searchers"": basically the town sheriff and his deputy set off to rescue an abducted woman from a savage band of native-American ""troglodyte"" cannibals.  Her wounded husband and the town douchebag insist on coming along and together they ride into the harsh desert on their mission.

This is more of a dialogue-driven slow burn western rather than an action-adventure film and it gets off to a somewhat slow start, before getting to its dark and very gory conclusion.  It is not for everyone.  Be warned that there is a scene about 3/4s of the way through that is one of the most savagely violent and hard to watch scenes put on film in the last year or so (I will only say that the weapon in the title does come in to play and that those natives are not vegetarians.)  That part is impossible to unwatch once you've seen it, but fortunately, I have the stomach for that sort of thing and feel like it was well-executed and not simply gratuitous like an Eli Roth or Tarantino film.

The strength of the film comes from the well-written dialogue and some performances from Kurt Russell, Richard Jenkins and Patrick Wilson.  When  the violence comes in the movie, as in life, it is swift and brutal and it felt like a pretty authentic portrayal of a very savage time and place.

Probably (no, definitely) not the best choice for a date night movie, but a great choice for a guys' night for fans of old-school westerns and horror.",1453593600,14,1537,4.536231884057971

7410591,4,B014HDTT84,"If you ever wondered what a movie collaboration between Quentin Tarantino and Eli Roth would look like, you now have the answer. Novelist turned writer/director S. Craig Zahler pays homage to both Tarantino and Roth with his horror Western ""Bone Tomahawk,"" a movie that mixes Tarantino-esque dialogue (much of it uttered by one of Tarantino's favorite actors, Kurt Russell) and Rothian forays into cannibalism.

The plot has elements of John Ford's ""The Searchers"" and a little-known Gregory Peck Western, ""The Stalking Moon."" A couple of small time outlaws disturb a Native American burial ground. and the natives take exception, eventually pursuing the survivor to a small town where he gets medical attention from the town's female doctor (Lili Simmons). During the night, she and a couple of other townspeople are kidnapped by the natives and taken back to their lair. The town sheriff (Russell) puts together a small rescue posse consisting of the doctor's husband (Patrick Wilson), who is recovering from a broken leg, a dandy (Matthew Fox) whose marksmanship skills and combat savvy are exceeded only by his dislike of non-whites, and Russell's geezer deputy (Richard Jenkins).  The posse has been warned by a local expert that their quarry are a group of flesh eating, cave dwelling, inbred freaks warmly referred to as Troglodytes, so the posse members already have a good idea what to expect.

""Bone Tomahawk,"" like Tarantino movies, is deliberately paced and spends a bit too much time before the action really starts. But Zalher has a way with dialogue and takes his time sketching in the four main characters, who are often going after each other based on their differing ideas about morals and tactics. It becomes obvious fairly early in the movie that the ""code of the West"" doesn't apply here; the characters make cold, hard, practical and sometimes cruel decisions. These hardnosed decisions and actions come across in stark contrast to the often languidly paced, entertaining dialogue of ""Bone Tomahawk,"" but that dialogue is so well done that Zahler draws the audience in listening to Russell (who's a natural at this) and Fox (who's surprisingly good as well).

Eventually, the posse does run across their quarry, and the Troglodytes will not disappoint horror audiences. They are quite tall and cover themselves in white paint so that they blend in with the sand of the desert, allowing them to sneak up on their targets. Unlike some authors turned directors, Zahler proves himself rather adept at directing action scenes. The fights and shootouts are well staged and fairly exciting. But my use of the word ""freaks"" to describe the Troglodytes wasn't hyperbole. When Zahlers finally shows them and their prisoners, he doesn't hold back. The last half hour of ""Bone Tomahawk"" contains some extremely grisly and gory footage (the movie is unrated for good reason). When I saw it, my reaction was incredulity... that Zahlers couldn't possibly be going to show what was going to happen next, but he did, and it was even more graphic than I thought it would be.

Obviously, ""Bone Tomahawk"" is not a movie for general audiences (it got an extremely minimal theatrical release before going to VOD). But it's a quality production with a good script and an excellent cast of character actors (you won't see a cast like this in an Eli Roth film). Ironically, the very subject matter and style that made ""Bone Tomahawk"" box office poison ensures its long-term cult status. For those who aren't appalled by the subject matter, it's a Western worth watching.",1453593600,10,3567,5.049235993208828
7410592,4,B014HDTT84,Outstanding Western!  Good acting and loved the cannibal Indians.  The strongest and best don't always survive in this movie.  Enough action to keep it moving.  The Indians were downright scary with the bone bit impaled in their throats to call out to each other like wild animals.  Sid Haig had a bit part and I enjoyed his brief role.

Bone Tomahawk is a dark slow-building movie until the last half hour, then it quickens its pace a bit and becomes quite gory.  I had to peek through my fingers at a couple of the more...hmm...graphic places.  It's not a movie you can do something else and just listen to, the actors are all superb and much of the story is told with body language and facial expression, and you don't want to miss the grisly scenes at the end, even if you have to peek your way through them. It is tense all the way through and ends on one of those quixotic notes that short stories turned movie loves to end on.
I enjoyed the dialogue that was formal and witty.  The acting is superb, everyone showed up and played their parts well.  But most of all I enjoyed the exploration of sub-themes, blatant racism, the harshness of wild west life, the earnestness of being true to self. and the isolation of subcultures within geographical isolation.

The rest of the cast was very good as well. I think what I liked the most was the dialogue between the characters. Kurt Russell had some great lines.

You should also be able to appreciate character development because most of the movie is about the characters. Kurt Russell was obviously the biggest name here but I wouldn't say he was the main character. All the actors felt like main characters and I left feeling like I knew each one of them really well. Most movies have one or two characters that you get to know and the rest are simply there to let the main ones shine. This is not the case here. Excellent performances all around and I think everyone involved should feel proud of what they accomplished.

My wife and I have been talking about this movie all day now and we rarely do that. So impressed! If you see it I think you will be as well.",1453507200,,933,4.235955056179775

7410760,4,B014HDTT84,"Liked it.  Russell is a fave.  Good cast all around.  The 1800s stylized dialog came across as entertaining and realistic.  If you like well crafted banter, you'll enjoy it.  In terms of the bad guys, it's pure fiction.  Come on -cannibals in the Territories?  There were a lot of technical goofs but I enjoyed the ride.

This would have easily been a five star for me, but I did find quite a few scenes lingering too long on a plot that was never really the focal point of the film. Otherwise, there is a great dark western feel to the film with a nice dose of horror mixed into the last third. There are better films with more action, better effects, and less cliche characters, but I've seen many, many worse films with far larger budgets and promotions.

(The entire cast delivers, but extra praise must be directed at Richard Jenkins in particular, who shines in what may well be the greatest role of his career.) Strangely enough, the film also has a superb sense of humor and a genuine warmth about it: Even in its darkest moments, when the characters are at odds with their world and with each other, you can sense them reaching for understanding of one another. There's respect amid the conflict, which serves to brilliant separate our heroes from the seemingly unfeeling, barely-human monsters they face.

BONE TOMAHAWK is not for everyone. The squeamish had best steer clear. However, it is an entertaining and unusually thoughtful film, and those with the stomach for its lows will be delighted by its highs.",1453507200,,907,5.087248322147651

There is really only one gruesome scene and it is nothing I would compare to slasher films. It is a Western and it does have Indians and ""Cowboys"". There are only a handful of star actors but they each shined! This is not your average Western and the language is much cleaner than most films these days.

7411231,4,B014HDTT84,"For a full description of the plot, etc., read other reviews.  Just some quick thoughts on this movie...

Bone Tomahawk (2015) is a rather weird movie in that it combines two genres - the western genre and the horror genre.  The main thing, though, is that's it's an original movie and not a remake of some movie.  Kurt Russell gives a good performance as the sheriff.  This movie slows down a bit in the middle, but it never gets boring and it holds my attention.  The acting throughout is good by all involved and the musical score does the job well.

If you like westerns and don't mind some gore and the overall horror element, then see this movie.  Recommended.",1453420800,,666,4.491666666666666
7411232,5,B014HDTT84,"If you were attracted enough by the offbeat premise to start watching this film, knowing not to expect a standard Western and willing to accept its unconventional theme going in, I don't see how anyone could not admire this film as it played fair throughout on that basis, and delivered as a fully engrossing well crafted story that sucked you into its world as inexorably as a super gravitational cosmic vortex.

Consider as a comparison the far more highly contrived truly mixed genre ""Cowboys and Aliens"" and compare it to this considerably more successful effort only mildly in that vein, that really doesn't mix genres at all actually, nor certainly to such an implausible extent as to be almost laughably impossible to produce the required suspension of our disbelief required to take it seriously as that film was.  There are no inter galactic space creatures here, no supernatural beings, no spawned by H-bomb radiation produced mutant monsters or slack jawed shambling zombies here, but perfectly believable savage adversaries in a tribe of backward cannibalistic inbred brutish primitives whose existence and horrific behavior is not only believable in a real world, but has well documented non fiction precedent.  Kurt Russell is at his stalwart heroic best here, and the supporting cast is nothing less than superb.  My only criticism here is perhaps the dumb song played over the closing credits, which I only mention for want of any other flaw to pick on, which of course was no big deal anyway and only mildly irritating given the exceptional quality of the whole.",1453420800,,1579,5.038314176245211

This movie kept me entertained with it's intriguing variety of characters, non-cookie cutter dialogue, and some seriously intense action scenes. I wouldn't consider this an action movie though...but it does help inject some adrenaline when needed. The movie is by no means perfect, but it's way different than any other western I've seen. It dips into the horror/fantasy realm a bit, it certainly doesn't borrow from traditional native american folklore.

There is no doubt that there is some gory scenes, but the mere fact that it opens with two westerners calling natives ""savages"" after cutting the throats of sleeping travelers and stealing their belongings, says exactly what this film is getting at -- the savagery that human animals can possess. Who is the savage in this story? Who deserves to live and tell the tale? Is there redemption?

7411326,3,B014HDTT84,"I'm not a fan of horror movies, generally, but this didn't feel like a stereotypical horror movie. The quaint, interesting dialogue gave the story a feeling of authenticity, and it helped build more or less three-dimensional characters. Events near the beginning of the story set the stage for a dreadful, disturbing final act, where the real horror was on display. For my taste, the ""road-trip"" (middle) part of story dragged on a bit too much; otherwise I would have rated the movie 3.5 stars. There came a point during the second act where I was thinking, okay, when are we going to get to the climax. I'll probably never watch it again, but I don't regret watching it. Oh yeah, right now I can't think of a good alternate title, but to me, ""Bone Tomahawk"" is a stupid title.",1453334400,,778,4.60431654676259

7411340,4,B014HDTT84,"This is the strangest western I've seen, a sort of horror movie version of THE SEARCHERS with a much shorter but very intense search.  Good action when there is action,  good plot when there is plot, but it also contains long, drawn-out sequences of O'Dwyer and wife at home, of O'Dwyer's leg injury, of O'Dwyer gamely carrying on despite his injury, etc.  I estimate that at least 15 minutes of the 2 hour, 12 minute movie is just wasted film.  The dialog is interesting, particularly the odd statements and observations by my favorite character, Chicory, the old, official reserve deputy.  Thinking of Chicory, I am increasing my review from 3 stars to 4 just for Richard Jenkins' performance as Chicory, an elderly, slightly befuddled but brave and effective man.

The movie is also interesting in that everyone is not carrying the Colt Peacemaker which is standard in most westerns.  I identified the sheriff's revolver as a Smith & Wesson top-break, probably a .44-40 or .44 Russian rather than a .45 Schofield.  Even more unusual and rare is O'Dwyer's Merwin Hulbert.  I have been unable to positively identify the revolver with the lanyard ring used by the outlaw Buddy at the beginning of the movie.

Yes, there were cannibals in the American Southwest.  Probably not as late in the 19th century as depicted in this movie, but the movie has a sort of lost world, lost tribe aspect to it which explains that.  For those who have, in their reviews, expressed shock and outrage that this is a horror movie, I will just point out that the description on Amazon begins, ""When a group of cannibal savages....""

So the mystical Indians seek out  the survivor hiding in a small peaceful town, and for some reason take a lady Doctor, the thief, and the deputy back to the caves for future dinners.  But, not before killing the black stable boy as apparently these pale white Indians don't like eating black people.  So Kurt Russle forms a posse to save the captives from being thanksgiving dinner. The supporting cast was under budget and did not depict what I would expect to see within an old west posse:  the doctors husband with a broken leg, a more mature man dumb as a box of rocks, and a playboy quick trigger with a thing for killing Indians.  Too many long and drawn out scenes, filled with silly and senseless dialog, attempting to give these yahoos a sense of purpose and character.  Like a good country song, the wife is gone, a dog is shot, their horses are stolen, and the husband with a broken leg entertains us with what felt like 30 minutes of his agonizing hobble through the plains / desert on a crutch.  If you can fast forward to the last half hour, you have a low budget action film that falls short on action.  At least you get to see one of these savages split one of the prisoners in half, it's guts fall out, in preparation for a meal.

The pace is perfect. You are relaxed, and the tension builds and just sticks with you. I am still thinking about this movie, and I saw it two days ago.
If you are a person that reads, you understand investment.
The gore everyone is talking about is well done. It's not Rob Zombie ridiculous. This is just tough as hell to comprehend, but, you weren't there during the Western Expansion, and you live in a charmin world, so, use your imagination and get over it.
Riding horses is always made so damn pretty and glamorous, but, in this movie, you get  a sense that they were not pretty animals when they were workers for the working man. You loved it, but, family comes first, so there is a ""minivan horse"" in here. I loved that!
And, while the cinematography is splendid, it's not there to make you feel like you're in a NatGeo episode. It's there so you get to add even more tension, because there is no way you could tell where you're going there. It's all open. It's so defenseless.

If you want to watch a WONDERFUL absolutely hilarious KURT RUSSELL movie, try USED CARS. My friends and I wish he would make a sequel to that, even after all these years, but maybe the price would be ""too f----n high"".

I love Westerns for the cowboy atmosphere, historical depiction, the scenery, horses, etc. This one has that, but the horror and brutality is beyond comprehension. The savages torture and kill one of the cowboys in an unspeakable manner (I can't even say it) in front of the others, inferring that they are next. They keep their women in line by amputating their limbs and driving pegs through their eyes (and leaving them there). At one point the imprisoned woman doctor's husband kills one of the troglodytes and, in order to trick the others into coming to him so he can shoot them, he removes the throat whistle or whatever the hell it is from the dead guy's throat (by hand). This seemingly goes on forever with lots of effort and gristle-crunching sounds. Then he puts it in his mouth (blood and all) and blows a shrill, cheesy sound that reminds me of a crackerjack whistle, which, of course, draws the other 2 troglodytes to him as planned. A few minutes later (the end of the film), he goes to kiss his wife, realizes the guy's blood is still all over his mouth, wipes it with his sleeve and kisses her - a happy ending!",1453248000,,1204,4.502283105022831

7411451,1,B014HDTT84,"Prime instant video rating showed a five star and Rotten Tomatoes had an 88% rating so my expectations were probably set way too high. This is a terrible story but I'll get to that. There is a lot of praise for some aspects of the movie. Casting was great; the acting was very good and I was particularly happy to see Kurt Russell play a Wyatt Earp type character again; costumes were good; and most of the cinematography was good. But all of that goodness can't cover up the smell of bull droppings that is the script. This movie isn't for kids due to graphic violence, torture, murder, and cannibalism. I wish I hadn't seen it either.

SPOILER ALERT
The starting premise of the movie is that an bumbling, illiterate outlaw with an apparent IQ of 60 desecrates a tribal burial ground and somehow manages in broad daylight, and on foot, to elude members of a small Native American tribe so terrifying that other more mainstream tribes won't go near them. The outlaw manages to make it to a town, still in reasonably good condition, despite having travelled more than five days on foot through the desert by himself with the Indians in hot pursuit. The outlaw gets shot by the local sheriff (Russell) and taken to jail. In the night the Indians attack silently, swiftly and brutally, killing the local stable hand and captures a deputy, a female doctor and the outlaw. A posse of four men is formed, the sheriff, a vengeful Indian killer, a half-witted deputy, and the doctor's husband (who has a broken leg).

I call the deputy on the posse half-witted because there is a scene where he asks the sheriff for advice because he couldn't figure out how to keep the pages of a book dry while taking a bath and another where he is delighted by the thought that a flee circus was real instead of dead flees glued to mechanical device. He is repeatedly shown as slow, inept and has to be reminded to eat but somehow we are supposed to believe he was once a military field surgeon and still capable of diagnosing complex infections and break and reset the leg bone of another posse member in the field.

Soon into their travels the four loose their horses but continue on foot. Not surprisingly the four become three when the doctor's husband can't keep up with a broken leg and he is left alone in the desert in an opium fuelled slumber for at least 12 hours and somehow nothing eats or kills him. The three then become two when one is killed and the others taken prisoner. At this point something seems to have gone wrong with the movie production quality and it seemed to me they were running out of money for sets and filming. From here on the Indians, depicted earlier as terrifyingly swift, silent and deadly, become clumsy and stupid cave dwellers who can't even fight off a noisy crippled man on a crutch (the husband). Of course he saves the day and at least three people make it out alive, the doctor, the half-wit and a man on a crutch.

There are also several scenes towards the end that are disturbing (blind pregnant Indian women with arms and legs amputated by their own tribe) and gruesome (torture, killing and cannibalism). These seem added for shock value more than any coherent thought. How for example are we to believe that a primitive tribe of cave dwellers could successfully amputate their womens arms and legs, blind them, care for them throughout their natural lives and take care of the children? None of the tribe actually speak because they have had a complex whistle surgically implanted in their windpipes, how exactly did they manage that? How exactly did this tribe survive against all the other Indian tribes if they could be defeated by a pitiful posse of four white men walking through the desert? These questions and many more will confuse you if you watch this movie.",1453161600,3,3798,4.597345132743363

Once you get through the slow beginning - and watch it twice - you will find that the beginning isn't really that slow. The script is very well written and the sweeping cinematography is exceptional (I think I will research a bit to learn where this movie was filmed. It reminds me of the Butte Creek Canyon area near my home in Chico, CA  but it's more likely to be somewhere down south (southern California).  Love the wide-lens shots the most.

7411567,2,B014HDTT84,"Reading some of these reviews is like The Emperor's New Clothes. If this is an inside joke, please let us in on it.

Good acting by most of the major leads, if only the movie held up to Russell & Wilson's performances. Left to assume too much $$ was spent on putting together a nearly all star cast (did they need Sean Young?) & either corner cutting, inexperience, or both lead to the cheap sets, mediocre cinematography,  continuity errors,  & occasional sci-fi channel effects that dumb it down.

Music sets the mood, and this movie has none (save for the magnum opus @ the end credits composed & performed by the writer / director- not joking). A good soundtrack goes a long way and there were so many moments that cried out for something, anything, to build on the emotion being laid out by the cast. True, No Country for Old Men had no soundtrack, but did Zahler really think he could pull that off out of the gate?

I was really looking forward to something original & was really let down with this redux of the Burrowers. Not the worst movie I've ever seen, but the hype killed it for us. If the picture would have reveled in what it was (a b-movie) and had a little fun @ its own expense it would be alot more enjoyable. It should have taken a page from Rob Zombie, Robert Rodriguez & Quentin Tarantino instead of the Cohen Brothers or Sam Pecinpah.

I'd be really interested to hear the backstory on the making of this movie someday. Its not anywhere near as bad as The Room, but st times it has that strange vanity / pet project feel. I'm dying to know, ""What were they thinking!?""",1453075200,,1592,4.379661016949153

I had to watch an entire rom com after this movie so I could feel clean again.  The only reason I watched it in the 1st place was I love Kurt Russell.  That and after having seen too much of it I couldn't leave without closure, I had to take a chance and see how it came out.

I only agreed to this as our Friday night movie because Kurt Russell is in it. We watched it a couple of weeks ago and I still bring it up to my husband like, ""What the eff did we watch?"" As another reviewer has already said, it starts off like a typical western. The search party's journey might be considered slow by some viewers because there isn't a lot of action but the dialogue between the characters keeps you invested. During the climax, I was gripping the couch and my toes were curled  because I was scared, horrified, and anxious to see how the film would be resolved. This movie was surprisingly grotesque for a few minutes so don't try to watch this with your kids. I would also not recommend walking away or playing on your cell phone because you might miss the very brief explanations given for the Indians and why they've kidnapped some of the townspeople. I think the brief explanations really lends a hand to the tension in the movie.",1453075200,,1055,4.410256410256411

You do not have to endure CGI and this film shows how much can be done without it. The gore effects are very well done and convincing. I would actually warn viewers that there are some VERY violent and cringe inducing scenes, esp. with the cannibal indian/trodlodytes. A great film that will probably be overlooked by allot of people.

If you are expecting this movie to be like Tombstone or Open Range, it is not. There is one gratuitous sex scene that added nothing to the movie.  Richard Jenkins stole the show.  Kurt Russel did his best but he can only do so much with so little to work with. For me, the troglodytes were unrealistic and hard to grasp as even existing in the 1900s. The movie is OK, especially if you like movies with a lot of riding and walking.

7411999,4,B014HDTT84,"Bone Tomahawk is not your typical western movie, however it feels more realistic in tone, pacing and dialogue than most other western movies out there.  Bone Tomahawk felt like a genuine slice of the old west in the late 19th century, and I really enjoyed this movie because of it's realistic presentation.

Some reviewers fault this movie for it's slow pace, and not having enough of a story.  Bone Tomahawk has it's own pace, more akin to the times when telegraph was the fastest form of communication a horse was still a mainstay of travel.

When the story hits it's stride, there is an urgency in the narrative but that urgency exists in the slower pace of the old west.

Also, some reviewers were taken back by some of the violence and gore in Bone Tomahawk, which it does have, but in my opinion the violence and gore is not exploitative, and that it both fits into the narrative and is quite realistic for that period in time.

The story is simple, but compelling.  Acting is solid, but it's Kurt Russel who shines here...just low key brilliant.

Bone Tomahawk does not cater to the typical viewer; who is most likely entertained by fast and loud action edited with a.d.d. in mind.  Cool people doing cool things, and saying even cooler things.

The viewer must cater to Bone Tomahawk, to slow down a little and become immersed in it's narrative...and that is exactly how I like my viewing experience.

If you enjoy American western films, Bone Tomahawk is a must see.",1452902400,9,1475,4.634615384615385

But this out-gored and out-grossed anything I've seen and you will NOT be able to forget it.

Not only am I a huge fan of westerns but I also love everyone that was in this movie so I knew this was going to be a winner. I was surprised  though by how much I really did enjoy this film from writer/director S. Craig Zahler. I cant wait to see what he does next as this was a superbly written and directed film. A western with some horror elements thrown in even though it never feels out of place.

The story follows a sheriff who gets a little posse together after a deputy, fugitive and a doctors assistant are kidnapped by a tribe so brutal even the other Natives are scared of them. These four men including the Doctors assistants injured husband set out on a long journey that is just as dangerous as the destination. The trip will test not only the mens physical well being but their loyalty to one another as well. This of course is all leading to a showdown with the kidnappers who are way more dangerous than anyone had imagined.

This was such a good film, Zahler did an excellent job with this movie giving it time to develop the characters and story over a slower but never boring pace. The characters are super interesting and the actors portraying them all do an excellent job as well. Star and sheriff in the story Kurt Russell gives an A level performance as usual but the supporting actors are just as great including scene stealers like Richard Jenkins, Matthew Fox, and Patrick Wilson as his posse members. Plus we get appearances from people like Sid Haig and David Arquette as well as  a great performance from Lili Simmons.

The story is a very intriguing one and the characters make it one that you actually care about. It is also realistic and when things happen, they happen. This was a wonderful film and the DVD came with a great behind the scenes making of, I just wish we would have had a commentary to go along with it. This film is highly recommended.",1452902400,,1902,4.42

7412061,4,B014HDTT84,"It's all about the simple stark details in this one. The journey is more than half the battle here as we spend a large portion of the film following a rescue squad of four men, two up in years law men, an able bodied man experienced in slaying natives, and a crippled man with a broken leg. Much time is spent on the difficulty of the crippled man, who's wife is the one held captive by vaguely super natural indians. By much time I mean, wincing through every agonizing step. Hobbling with a crudely made splint and a stick for a crutch most of the way. There are cringe moments throughout this film, the pain and injuries sustained are palpable. Woven together with an old western style story and understated, simple, yet highly effective dialogue, acting, directing and production. The realism of the violence effects is quite visceral and unflinching. Can't recall anything quite like this film, it's strong across the boards spanning horror and western. If you are a fan of both, you can't really go wrong here, just be prepared to settle in for the long haul...it feels like one with each painful step forward..",1452902400,,1117,4.675126903553299

This movie was terrible.  It held my interest until, virtually out of nowhere, it became a slasher movie and the story absolutely fell apart.  Gratuitous, senseless, meaningless violence.

7412070,4,B014HDTT84,"Bone Tomahawk is two separate movies, one great, and the other merely okay.  With a script full of witty, engaging dialogue by S. Craig Zahler (who also makes his directorial debut) and outstanding performances all-around, the western portion of Bone Tomahawk is sure to satisfy fans of the genre, but the horror climax is bound to leave western fans unsatisfied (and more than likely nauseous).

The film centers on the community of Bright Hope, under the stern, watchful eyes of Sheriff Franklin Hunt (Kurt Russel), whose lives are thrown in disarray when their acting town interim-doctor (Lili Simmons), is kidnapped in the dead of the night by an unknown group of natives.  Her husband, Arthur (Patrick Wilson), despite nursing a broken leg, is determined to ride out into hostile territory and retrieve her.  The kidnappers, the towns local Indian informs them, are a members of the troglodytes, a clan of cannibals who dwell in a cave five days ride from Bright Hope.  Despite the mans warning, Arthur isn't dissuaded by the warning, or his broken leg, and, along with Sherriff Hunt, back-up deputy Chicory (Richard Jenkins), and dapper Indian killer John Brooder (Matthew Fox) set out to rescue the captive Samantha before its too late.  When they finally reach the troglodytes cave all hell breaks loose as the posse finds themselves outnumbered and thrust into a harrowing fight for survival against an enemy that can only be described as evil incarnate.

For many viewers, the final act of the film  when it shifts from The Searchers to The Hills Have Eyes  is where Bone Tomahawk stumbles.  I find myself agreeing with that sentiment.  Ive often heard that writers need to know when to let a story grow, even if it means abandoning the original concept that inspired it.  It is my belief that Bone Tomahawks inception came with the idea of being a horror film set in the old west, but, as it was written, evolved into a stellar western that was dragged down by its horror climax.

Where the Bone Tomahawk is at its strongest are the classic Western elements.  While the story about a posse setting posse setting out to rescue a stolen woman is as generic a western plot as you could come by (most famously used in John Fords The Searchers), S. Craig Zahlers script and direction successfully updates the formula for modern viewing audiences, and provides four distinct, memorable interpretations of established Western archetypes. The chemistry between the films four male leads is nothing short of electric.  I genuinely liked these characters, and found myself forgetting they were actorsthe direction, script, and performances were just that good.

The final act flounders not because its bad horror (its plenty shocking, and knows where to subvert horror clichs), but because the Western portion was so good, the horror finale seems merely serviceable.  S. Craig Zahler proves hes a force to be reckoned with in the western genre going forward, but is merely a serviceable as horror writer/director.  Any number of horror filmmakers could have produced this films climax, but only a select few could have written and directed the western portions with the Zahlers strength.

Despite the messy tonal shift in the final act, the good of Bone Tomahawk far outweighs the bad.  When its at its best, Bone Tomahawk is another solid entry in the western genres resurgence in recent years through independent film.  S. Craig Zahler shows great promise as a writer/director, and is someone to keep an eye on.  If you can stomach the finale, Bone Tomahawk is well-worth your time.",1452816000,,3585,4.969849246231155

The movie wasn't a nonstop action thrillride, but it certainly held my interest. I enjoyed it, but the song during the final credits was hard to stomach and a score during the rest of the movie (if there was one) wasn't memorable at all. This wasn't packed with brutality and gore either, but when it did happen there were NO punches pulled and it was hard or even impossible to watch. I have seen some pretty gruesome movies in my day, being a horror fanatic, but even I flinched and looked away. If you watch the movie you will know exactly what scene I am talking about. If you haven't seen the movie, well...they are cannibals. Over all I enjoyed the movie and think it certainly earned every one of those 4 stars. I would have given it a 5 if the ending had been slightly different (maybe let us know if all the cannibals were dead, if the town was safe, if they even made it back to town) and if there had been a better score to the movie.",1452816000,,1139,4.205479452054795

It was a different type of western that I'd never seen before. It's a shame that few survived since the remaining characters/actors were quite interesting especially the one who'd taken out so many Indians in his day for personal revenge of family massacre. I'd like to have seen him confront the majority and go out in a blaze of glory. I liked this character. TNT was mentioned, yet I never saw it used unless I missed it. That might have helped, like why have it unless you're going to use it? I noticed the settlers seemed to be equipped with plenty of opium.

A western that is also a horror film, yet believable. The violence is some of the most extreme that I've seen, but was integral to the plot. It sets up the overwhelming fear and apprehension that the viewer feels while watching.
What is this that they are dealing with? Are they human? Obviously they are pure evil, but as horrible as they are, they actually are not any more evil than the extremist jihadists we deal with in this day and time. So then this level of evil can be believable, since we see similar atrocities facing us in the news every day by similar blood thirsty savages such as Isis.
Much of the acting, especially that of Kurt Russell's is extremely good.
The movie is gripping, shocking, yet believable, but if you have a problem with the violence, which is very well staged, you may want to pass by this one.",1452729600,,884,4.462962962962963

So much promise and mystery giving the first two acts just to be thoroughly disappointed and baffled by horrific Gore the third act. Amazing how just a few scenes can ruin an entire movie.

7412085,5,B014HDTT84,"I would probably give it 4.5 but you can't choose a half star.
Anyway, it surprised me how much I was pulled into the story. I didn't really read or watch anything on this movie, so I only watched it because I saw it while browsing for a movie. So I started it with the intent to stop it if I found it to be boring, over the top, etc... but that never happened. I was into it immediately. I thought all the acting was pretty good (esp. Kurt Russell) as well.
But, above all else, I have to give it a great rating simply because it is such a unique movie... I now view it as a western/thriller/borderline horror movie. And really, the horror part only comes from scenes where you will probably grimace and start to look away... so yes, a little graphic in some areas but that doesn't diminish the movie in any way unless you just can't handle that kind of thing. I am not a horror movie fan so don't let that deter you.

Summation: If you like westerns OR if you like thrillers and you don't mind a mix of the two, then you will really enjoy.

Every actor in the film does a fantastic job of portraying a realistic and believable character, with Richard Jenkins as Chicory standing out exceptionally in my opinion.
I have to laugh at these 1 star reviews who somehow seem shocked by the violence in the movie when it's apparent from the description and trailer that it is exactly what you should be in store for, they are going after cave dwelling cannibals after all. That being said, one scene in particular is rather gruesome. As someone who has grown up on gore and horror movies all my life even I was a little surprised with how far it goes, but it only serves to build up how menacing the tribe is and how helpless the protagonists are in that particular scene.
Overall, it's a completely original idea which is exceedingly rare in today's Hollywood and the character writing (especially in the 2nd act) and suspense are pulled off flawlessly. I cannot recommend this enough, especially since it is free with Prime.",1452729600,,1107,4.801047120418848

Subtract some of his slow soliloquies and responses and the movie would be right at the sub 2-hr. point which is perfect for most audiences' attention spans.

In addition, the violence perpetrated upon the ""second-assistant Deputy"" in the cave by the Troglodytes was gratuitous and unnecessary. It was a bit too much and begins to look like a ""Saw"" movie or ""Hostel-type"" scenario. If you are a fan of horror you will understand these references as over-the- top scenes exploitative of human suffering.

7412129,4,B014HDTT84,"No not a traditional classic style western we're used to seeing. Many of us remember and loved Kurt Russell in Tombstone. Well his performance is just as great in this movie but, this is NOT a western in the traditional style that tombstone was and many other westerns of the 80's or 90s. This western has grit. It's straight forward style, in your face dialogue and action. Some have called it ""SHOCK"" tactics, but I don't think so.
***This movie is NOT for the weak stomachs*** When I say this is not a traditional style western, I mean this is shot in a manner that you could be fly on the wall observing. There are no Cliched quotes, there is no over the top dramatic musical score when some dramatic is said or done. That being said, you don need one. When something profound is said or done, you do feel it.
All actors are at they're best. You might ask, how can a western not be for the people with weak stomachs. Well as I said this film has GRIT. Grit when said, in my mind is a life like representation of the scene or situation. Basically I mean many movies will dress up a scene nice and pretty how Hollywood wants you to see it. This movie does not, An example here ***SPOILER ALERT HERE*****. For example; when an Indian would scalp someone in a traditional western, it not likely you will see the actual act. In this movie you will see a scalping and by golly it looks real....well to those of us that have never seen a scalping, you see the entire scene although it lasts all of about 45 seconds.
SPOILER OVER*** Some people are saying the movie carry's blood and gore tactics to get your attention. I don't agree, I see it as realistic entertainment, they are pulling you in the moment.
This movie is clearly not for everyone and that's ok, some here have judged Kurt Russel & Mathew Fox for making such a movie, there is and audience for these type westerns, and I for one enjoyed it.
On a last note, the did have again, straight forward dialogue, nothing profound, but realistic to what conversations might have been like 100 years ago in the west since most people barely had a grammar school education. The movie is 2 hours and 40 minutes long. The first hour you will start wondering if the movie is going anywhere, it is a bit of druggery.... but sit tight, it will take off, and it will hit you hard.

WRONG!!!
The rating was/in NR for what reason I have NO idea! They're was brief nude scenes, various language, but first & foremost the most DISTURBING scenes of blood & gore!
Stripping a man down naked, scalping him (screaming), then shoving his scalp into his mouth, (more screaming) pounding into his throat with an instrument of some sort. THEN hanging him upside down and pounding tools in his genitals (more screaming), kept going with that until he split in half & the men tore him in half, before eating him.
EXTREMELY DISTURBING. These men were cannibals, and had two women for impregnating purposes only. These women had eyes gouged out with sticks of some sort and limbs had been severed.
Kurt Russell himself (character) was taken and stretched out, cut with a bone hatchet from the navel to the liver & a hot flask shoved in the area.
One, if not the Worst, Most Disturbing movies I have seen.
It sticks with you for a few days after seeing it. (ONE of THOSE).
I made sure to see the writers name & will never watch another movie by him again.
The story line was slow, and it has a western theme, I kept thinking it will pick up. You are three-quarters through the movie before all of the above mentioned, takes place.
Shame on you Kurt Russell, Matthew Fox, Patrick Wilson and Richard Jenkins for lowering yourselves to not even a ""B"" movie!!!!",1452384000,2,1576,4.604982206405694

7412142,5,B014HDTT84,"I'm very surprised at the number of negative reviews on this film. Most are upset about one of the gory scenes in particular. One guy complained that his young daughter was disturbed by it. It's an R-rated movie folks - not for kids. But if you are effeminate, squeamish, prudish, or just have a low tolerance for gore then you should probably move along to the Disney section because this film is not for you.

I thought this was an authentic western. But is certainly has a twist. From start to finish the cast keeps you engaged and wondering what could come next. What eventually comes next is cannibals. If cannibals doesn't clue you in to what is coming then you are slow on the uptake. Kurt Russel plays the tough sheriff as well as you would expect. But the ""backup deputy"" steals the show. I thought the dialog was wonderful funny and exactly as you'd expect from the period.

All in all, an enjoyable flick. I think what disturbs people is that they don't expect this kind of gore in a Kurt Russel film. Get over it. It is a good story and well acted. I recommend it - but not while the kids are up.",1452384000,,1108,4.3478260869565215

Great dialog and interesting characters keep you engaged in a gradual build up to climax. This film is daring in a way that it mixes western theme with horror, but executes it well with originality. The cannibals portrayed in this movie are truly terrifying and there is this one scene that brought chills in my spine.

""Bone Tomahawk"" was most definitely a pleasant surprise!",1452211200,,446,4.705128205128205

This is not a movie for your weekend night. It's dark. It's violent. It's viciously bloody, full of gore and carnage scenes of unimaginable human suffering are yet another example that Hollywood no longer has an intelligently controlled ""edit"" function.

2 stars only because of Curt. If it weren't for his caliber here, I'd probably wouldn't even bother writing this review.

7412190,1,B014HDTT84,"This is one of the MOST DISTURBING movies I've ever seen, and as an avid movie buff @ 51 yrs old, I've seen more than my share of movies.  The torture scene toward the end, is one of those RARE scenes in a very rare film, WHERE YOU WISH YOU COULD UN-SEE IT!!!  The brutality and depravity of it is off the charts, and the camera doesn't flinch or blink, so almost before you can avert your eyes, the horror is already through your eyeballs and in your brain.  It is the kind of scene that probably inspires sick and mentally unstable people to copy.

As for the movie, itself, it is  V-E-R-Y  S-L-O-W.  The budget must have been very low, as it has VERY FEW ""extras"" in the town, to make it even look like a real town.  The dialogue is awful and much of it has absolutely no purpose for being in the movie, and the enunciation of their lines is so ""proper"" that you know it would NEVER be spoken in these situations.  Spoiler alert------I mean, the movie is a Western, set in the 1800's, yet some of the language used by the characters are so ""advanced education level"" that you know they would NEVER have been spoken by those characters and in that setting.  And how is it even plausible to think that after the characters have WALKED for miles and miles through the hot, barren land, and finally made camp---but can only sleep for 4 hours---that their clothes are not very dirty, and NOBODY is stiff, grunting, complaining, or even looking tired.  Then 2 men lie down to sleep and end up talking about how to READ A BOOK IN THE BATHTUB, without getting it wet???  To add to the lack of reality, no such tribe of people ever existed in the US.  And after the torture scene, the female character--looking totally non-plussed--goes into a ""political-type"" diatribe, implying that it is NOT this tribe's fault for the way they are victimizing people, but is the fault of the victims, who are just stupid idiots, who don't understand that they shouldn't BOTHER these people, or some such non-sense.

Sorry, but I turned the thing off, after that, so I can't say how it ended, or whether the ending made any of it seem more plausible.  So, I will just end by saying, it was over an hour of my time, that I will NEVER get back, and placed an awful visual image and mental disturbance in my brain, that i can never UN-SEE.  Sorry, Kurt Russell, but I really am shocked, that an actor of his caliber would stoop to this low-level movie.",1452211200,3,2429,4.400447427293065

7412205,4,B014HDTT84,"A very different and somewhat fanciful Western perhaps.........
When two citizens and a prisoner go missing in the small town of Bright Hope 'Sheriff Franklin Hunt' (Kurt Russell) immediately suspects
them to have been taken by Indians.........however as a Indian who resides in the town tells him those responsible for the abduction are
unlike any native he'd ever encountered before it's a group known as The Troglodyte's' who are cannibalistic cave dwellers.
Well. the Sheriff rounds up a small posse to rescue those taken including 'Arthur' (Patrick Wilson) who's wife 'Samantha' (Lilli Simmons)
is among those taken...he despite being crippled by a leg injury is determined to at least try to get his wife back....gunfighter 'Brooder'
(Mathew Fox) and elderly deputy Sheriff 'Chicory' (Richard Jenkins)
A few nights into the journey the horses are taken while they slept they will now have to continue on foot which for partially crippled 'Arthur'
will be an additional ordeal.
The task now ten times more difficult the quest continues however when they do come face to face with the abductors they will find them to
be a fearless and formidable opponent.
Can the posse overcome the odds and save those that have been taken or is it quite simply too late ??
The film can feel a little slow-moving at times however there is a certain amount of tension along the way coupled with some action sequences
and scenes of visually brutal and graphic moments.
There are also a couple of sequences of an adult nature and nudity.

I love Kurt Russell, but the plot was dragging in certain parts. And, I agree with other reviewers-- I hate when the plausibility is removed. Like it took them forever to get to where the cannibals were-- but then they just start walking home at the end? The woman and her fellow prisoners aren't screaming their heads off in sheer horror as their friend is being horrifically cut open and split? The 2 pregnant blind cannibal chicks are just left and not shot? As they went on the journey to get back the kidnapped characters the plot got more exciting....it was pretty good until the splitting scene-- then you just feel a hot wave of disgust wash over you as you wonder why things like that are permitted in films. I agree with another reviewer who said it's funny when people rate this a 5 star movie because 5 star movies you would want to watch over and over again.

The other issues many people had was the slow burn, but I felt that it made the journey feel more realistic even if it padded the film a bit. When the action picks up, it is pretty incredible and non-conventional. I was genuinely terrified for the main roster of characters. Great performances from entire cast.

7412255,5,B014HDTT84,"Two killers wander into a burial ground, disturbing the remains. This sets off a chain of events that leads to a rescue mission across the abandoned desert: a sheriff, his aging deputy, an Indian killer, and a bereaved and crippled husband fighting bandits, the terrain, and each other. But what is waiting for them at the end of their journey is a kind of primal horror they have never before witnessed.

Sometimes, a movie is more than just a movie; sometimes, it's an experience. BONE TOMAHAWK is such a film. It's unflinching; that's the best word for it. Yes, that means there is graphic violence; but more to the point, the violence is presented honestly and clearly, with no stylization and little grandiose music. It is what it is. And, guess what: violence ain't pretty.

The film is more than a violent head-trip, though. It's anchored by a solid script, cinematography, and direction. And perhaps best of all, the acting is on-point. The three leads, if you will--Kurt Russell, Richard Jenkins, and Matthew Fox--are absolutely stellar. The supporting cast--roles of varying sizes from Patrick Wilson, Sid Haig, Lili Simons, and David Arquette--help round things out. The realistic performances make the movie even harder to watch at times. And yes, it is hard to watch. In the good way; it's an uncomfortable film, but a very good one. Maybe not a classic, per say, but perhaps bound to be a cult classic before all is said and done.",1451865600,,1444,4.842105263157895

However, when gore is transformed into sadism as a substitute for deficiencies in scripting and direction then all you really  have left is the bloody distraction of a film cheapened by grotesque voyeurism - Bone Tomahawk is such a film and one that richly deserves its direct-to-video pedigree.

While some reviewers seem enamored by the sparse dialogue and the sometimes interesting first-person character sketches in this late period Western drama, the narrative is overwhelmed by scenes that are so graphic and disturbing that dynamic storytelling is clearly beside the point.

Who wants to see a naked man hanging upside down, then watch him being sliced down the middle with his guts falling out and then being eaten like he was a deer or elk in the wild?  Thats about as grouse as you can get.  The writers, directors, producers and everyone involved in the making of this movie, including the Star Kurt Russell, who by the way dies in the end, have zero skills for making it interesting.  The only reasons for the making this film was to see how grouse you can make it.  This is the last Kurt Russell movie I will watch.

7412280,5,B014HDTT84,"Just finished watching this and all I can say is...wow!  What a great western/horror film.  I had never heard of it before and it was recommended by a friend of mine.  Kurt Russell and the rest of the cast were just great in this film.  It's pretty intense and it slowly builds to a crazy climax that just has you on the edge of your seat.  There were several scenes that are just shocking and you can hardly stand to watch it but you'll find yourself glued to the screen and you can't turn away.  Without giving away any spoilers, I'll just say that the story revolves around a search and rescue mission with Russell, who plays the sheriff, leading an unlikely team to get the job done.  What they encounter is both mysterious and shocking.

The film runs about 2 hours and 12 minutes and I enjoyed it immensely.  Well written, great cast, and plenty of nail bitting moments throughout.  I love that they combined two of my favorite genres (westerns and horror) into a very entertaining story.  Richard Jenkins, who plays the part of the deputy named Chicory, did an amazing job with his performance.  His character's ramblings and strange conversations really helped to break up the tension of the story and added a great dynamic to the cast of characters.  I really enjoyed Matthew Fox's performance as well and Kurt Russell is just awesome in this film.  You definitely have to check this out!",1451779200,3,1397,4.603238866396761

I could have done without the gratuitous information at the last 5 minutes regarding the basics of women in a patriarchy, even the ""civilized"" characters lacked compassion for them & left them to their fate. Nothing changes. But I guess they weren't happy with the basics of cannibalism. Definitely not for kids... not sure it was ok for adults.... My rating might be tainted by the natural ""distaste"" for the subject matter and the things I really didn't need to see to understand they were cannibals.

It looked like something Russell did because he still had Western style mutton-chops after Hateful 8 and wanted to get as much mileage out of them as possible. But it was fairly well acted, decently written, and had a number of interesting and sympathetic characters. It actually would have still worked quite well without the fantastical elements, which, I think, did not really add or detract that much from the movie.

I felt like I needed to take a bath or go to confession after watching this.  Some reviewers have compared this film to one of the best ""westerns"" they have seen in a while.

On the plus side, the acting was really good, after you get into the show and realize the Director is purposely making this a bit of a melodrama and encouraging overacting.  At first, it felt like a B movie.  I think those who like gratuitous violence and click on the 'horror' button often will really love this. On the minus side, if you prefer a good story, but like to feel good when it is over, avoid this one.  Nothing feel good about it.  I have to be a little amused by people who give it 5 stars, because in my book a 5 star movie can be watched over and over and over again.

Much of that could be that my expectations hadn't been unduly raised to start with and my appreciation for the acting and structure of this movie grew as I watched and didn't disappoint at the end.

Be prepared to watch what seems like hours of these fellows hobbling along endlessly through desert, with no dialog at all. The ending is completely gratuitous and disappointing. Not the quality of film one would expect from these actors. We watch Westerns more than any other genre.

Set in a nondescript Western town, the story arc follows the emergence of a savage, and very primitive tribe that is responsible for the disappearance of several locals. You do not get a sense until well into the movie as to why these people are taken. In always singular form, Kurt Russel forms the backbone of this story with his largely leading role, although there are fine performances from most of the cast -- the deputy Sheriff really grows on you thru out the movie, as does [to some degree] the preening local ""Indian killer"". The pacing and general story-form reminds me of Depp's ""Dead Man"". Certainly an unusual and original one, if you are tired of the typical gunslinger reels, revenge movies, or ""authentic to the point of paint drying watch-a-bility"", give this one a go with your favorite XXXtra butter popcorn, and you may find that 3.5 stars just doesn't quite sit right with you in the current ratings.",1451692800,3,1090,4.797872340425532

7412320,1,B014HDTT84,"I have no idea how this movie is rated so high (on Amazon or Rotten Tomatoes). Positive reviews cite the unique blend of western and horror. It certainly had potential, but it ultimately fell flat. This movie was uninspired, slow, boring and overall very poor execution. The acting was terrible. There was little atmosphere to it at all and pretty much no musical score to support it.

On the other hand, I can't help but laugh at the negative reviews complaining about the gore or ""twisted"" and ""sadistic"" story. Did you read the description of the movie or watch the trailer? Cannibal savages doesn't give you any indication? If you did read the description and were still offended or expected a classic western, you either don't really watch horror films or you have poor reading comprehension skills or both.

As an avid horror movie fan, I've seen FAR worse in terms of gore. And by the way, gore is not essential to a good horror film. Some of my favorite (and most terrifying) are actually not gory at all and some of the goriest are tongue-in-cheek campy to the point of actually being funny. But I'm not giving Bone Tomahawk 1 star for the gore or being over-the-top in any way; it's anything but.

7412322,5,B014HDTT84,"A really singular Western/Horror slow-burning movie, that has also something of drama and more than a touch of comedy. A re-imagination of the Western that is, at the same time, true to the origins of the genre (that is, life at the border of ""civilization""). However, in this contemporary Western the ""villains"" are not Native people, but something else linked to the remotest past of the specie, almost pre-human. In this sense, it has several points in common with movies like ""The 13th Warrior"" or ""The Descent"". And since the barbaric primitives are enemies of all humans, regardless of race, I believe the creation of those imaginary adversaries is a clever way to avoid the racism behind so many Western movies. It serves more like a metaphor of how primitive appetites that lurk in the shadows of our specie can menace the ""bright hope"" of civilization, no matter the ethnic origin of its inhabitants. Not in vain, we meet two white criminals at the opening of the movie that are not better (or less barbaric) than the cave-dweller enemies.
A warning: there is a particularly gory torture scene toward the middle of the movie that can be too graphic for many viewers (""The Hills Have Eyes"" or ""Hostel"" kind of violence). This is most probably not a movie that you want to watch with your children.",1451692800,3,1305,4.778761061946903

7412327,5,B014HDTT84,"Bone Tomahawk, directed by S. Craig Zahler, is what I consider to be a slow burn to a very dramatic ending with intense violence and bloodshed.  In some ways this reminded me of Clint Eastwoods The Unforgiven, though with a different story line, a different cast, a first-time director, and a really small budget.  If this film had had a larger budget and Clint's name as the Director, I can almost guarantee that it would be up for all kinds of awards, including an Oscar.

Some viewers, because of the films slow beginning, aren't going to like the movie.  Thats okay with me.  I loved it, and how the film took the time to introduce the main characters with their strengths and weaknesses.  It also helped that the posse was led by Kurt Russell (aka Wyatt Earp).  He somehow managed to keep the film in balance between over-acting and the comedy elements interjected at different points in the film.  Richard Jenkins (Deputy Chicory) brings in the humor with his wit and comedic tales.  In fact, Jenkins nearly steals the movie right out from under everybody else.

This is the story of a few citizens of Bright Hope being kidnapped by cannibalistic savages that dwell in the mountainous caves about five days from the small town.  One of the people kidnapped is the beautiful Dr. ODwyer (Lili Simmons).  Her husband is determined to get her back alive with or without the help of the town.  Kurt Russell plays Sheriff Franklin Hunt, who gathers four men (not nearly enough for a posse) to go after the Indians and their captives on a rescue mission.  Joining the posse are Deputy Chicory (Richard Jenkins), Arthur ODwyer (Patrick Wilson), and gunslinger and Indian killer, John Brooder (Edward Fox).  I really liked the character of John Brooder.  He was a no-nonsense kind of man who would just as soon shoot you as argue.

As the posse goes after the Indians, you begin to learn about the crippled Arthur ODwyer and his determination to save his wife.  Though you hate the character of John Brooder at first, you come to appreciate his knowledge of killers and the West, and to understand what happened in his past to make him the way he is.  Deputy Chicory, who had to fight to get the Sheriff to let him come along, offers the comedic relief for the movies intense moments, giving the audience his insights into whats happening with his funny one-liners and also the tale of the flea circus that he once saw.

Now the Indians, or Troglodytes, are fearful savages out of your worst nightmare.  Theyre huge and tall, and eagerly fight to the death.  You don't want to be one of their prisoners because these Indians are cannibals and have unique, but violent ways of killing their captives and later eating them.

When the posse finally confronts the Troglodytes, the battle that ensues is not what you expect; nor, is the ending.  This is an in-your-face kill or be killed fight with no holds barred.  What happens will literally take your breath away in horrific shock and maybe even give you a nightmare or two.

Bone Tomahawk never showed in the theater I frequent.  So, I had to wait for the DVD to come out in order to see the movie.  There are certainly things that viewers and critics might not like about the film.  Theres very little music in the background, which I believe is due to the low budget.  The movie is a long one with most of the action at the end.  The ending is definitely not what a viewer would expect.  And, the cutting and editing of the film is clearly by a first-time director, though the actual editor helped the director to put together the best movie possible;.

Now, given all of that, I still loved the film.  This was a movie that was made from the passion of its director and cast and crew.  Nobody made any money off of this.  Still, this is type of film that will eventually become a cult classic in a big way.  I certainly enjoyed the actors in each role and thought they did a magnificent job in bringing their characters to life.  All of them played a vital part in the movie.  Though Kurt Russell is the star and does a tremendous job of playing the low keyed, man-of-few-words hero, all of the other actors certainly brought their A-List performances to the making of this film.  The director clearly did an excellent job when you consider the fact that there wasn't much of a budget for him to work with, or to pay the cast and crew.

This was definitely a Western film in the biggest sense of the term.  Word of mouth will soon spread about this excellent, low budget movie, and people will be buying the DVD or seeing it on Netflix.  Keep in mind that some will not like it, but those that do will rave about it to others.  Bone Tomahawk is going to be one of those films that develop a life of its own on DVD much like Ed Harris Appaloosa has and John Carpenters The Thing.  This movie is not for the squeamish.  Make no mistake about that.  The ending will stay with you long after the film is over.

Oh, and the DVD has nearly an hour of Behind-the-Scenes information on the making of the movie, along with questions and answers from the cast and crew.

For me, this is the best type of picture to seeone that makes you ponder and think and question.

7412332,5,B014HDTT84,"Western-horror mashups are a genre I need more of in my life, and Bone Tomahawk delivers on its premise of cowboys versus cannibals in spades.

As Sheriff Hunt, Kurt Russel leads a four-man squad into the hills to rescue the abducted wife of cowboy Arthur O'Dwyer (Patrick Wilson). Joined by O'Dwyer, his Back Up Deputy, and sharpshooter John Brooder (Matthew Fox), the group is beset by O'Dwyer's broken leg and a group of Mexican bandits who make off with their horses.

The violence comes in quick, rapid-fire bursts and provides enough shock to keep this viewer glued to the screen. In between are quiet interludes, oftentimes filled with witty banter that really help to personalize each of these characters. Russel, as expected, continues to be at the top of his game, but it was Matthew Fox that most surprised me here. Brooder is an interesting sort, his keen intellect setting him apart from, and in his own mind oftentimes above, the others. He's smarter than everyone else and damn well knows it, and he's quick with a rifle. When we first meet him he convinces the sheriff his place on the group on account of the high number of Indians he has killed. When chided for boasting about such a thing, he deflects - it wasn't a boast, merely a fact. He's coldly analytical and consistently interesting when on screen.

The cannibal savages provide bookends to the narrative, but their presence in the finale catapults this western into the truly savage, reminding viewers that this is a horror story cast in a Wild West mold. There's gore aplenty, and the violent climax provides several scenes that are brutally wince-inducing.

Bone Tomahawk works as both a terrific western and as a haunting horror flick, with a top-notch cast that brings screenwriter and director S. Craig Zahler's vision to life perfectly.",1451692800,,1819,4.877022653721683

The  debate certainly caught my interest. The warnings have to do with the whole end climax of the movie. I watched the film twice over the weekend, I AM A WESTERN movie fan, I am NOT a horror movie fan. I am a huge Kurt Russell fan (he being one of the geek-gods, Snake Plisskan and Jake Burton, Elvis etc.) and it was great to see him in fine form as the hero, after skipping many of recent Tarintino films that he has been in. All the 4 main actors are absolutely terrific in the movie, Matthew Fox, Rickard Jenkins and Patrick Wilson- all wonderful. The writing is also a highlight as it somewhat like a weird John Ford film in that characters from this film remind me of some of eccentric characters from ""The Searchers"" Richard Jenkin's ""Chickory"" is in that mold. As to the shocking visuals in the climax, and yes it is, I felt this was where Mr. Zahler somewhat got his story confused and thus his audience. If you have read only a little about the founding of our West, you know atrocities were committed by all sides in the battle for the old West. I remember seeing a photo in an old Time/Life collection on the Frontier of a settler whose body was brutally abused by Indians. So is it a Western or a horror movie? its a very good WESTERN. The horror is that Mr. Zahler chose to depict at the end a very gruesome (but probably a true depiction or variation) of what might have happened in savage lands of the Old West. And yes its a little spooky, which is fun, but if you're a Western fan give it a look. No children and keep the remote ready to pause THOSE scenes at the end. It sure was good to see Mr. Russell as Sheriff Hunt back in the type of movie he moves to a higher level with his participation.

7412344,3,B014HDTT84,"It's difficult to rate this movie, which has a ridiculous plot, and yet has very good settings, costumes, characters, acting, etc.

Without lacing this little review with spoilers, suffice to say that in the Old West of approximately 1900, it would be next to impossible for these ""forces"" to remain at play.  ""Bad guys"" such as these would have been exterminated by the native Indians long before White Europeans ever arrived here.

But, perhaps borrowing something from the deliciously slow-paced ""atmosphere"" and visually stunning settings of other Westerns that have emerged in American cinema for the past 20 years, the director has crafted a very believable background and ""milieu"" for what is, unfortunately, a very unbelievable plot line.

And that's the enigma I face in reviewing this movie... because ALL the actors are very, very good, and to add to my dilemma, the directing is also top-drawer.  I should have probably given the movie a higher rating, because, after all, it's supposed to be entertainment -- not a ""docu-drama"".  Still, if the story is just not based in any kind of reality germane to the place or time it's supposed to occur in, then the whole thing is built on a flawed foundation.

Suggestion: if you like the ""atmosphere"" created in this Western movie, you may enjoy movies like ""Appaloosa"", or ""The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada"" more.",1451692800,,1376,5.008771929824562

It does contain one or two of the goriest movie scenes I've ever seen, but it really helped to amp up the tension at the end. When they do this in SAW or Hostel it's pointless, but in a movie like this with well acted characters it serves a greater purpose. It's always hit or miss when a movie uses long tedious travel scenes across barren landscapes to convey just how long and tiresome a journey is. I can understand those that found the use of such scenes in the movie a tad boring, but I love Westerns and so I can't really get enough of the scenery. Add in actors and characters that I really like and the mystery of what they're heading toward and I thing they did it very well this time.

The bad guys of the film were pretty damn scary. The brute force and speed of them, the way they'd make their footsteps thud, and especially their horns. I know we've seen all this before, but by keeping them off the screen most of the movie (especially when they were kidnapping people from the town at the beginning and then later all the way up until the end instead of jumping back and forth from them to the protagonists) they made them much more terrifying.

I am absolutely shocked at the lack of reaction in the reviews I read to the scenes of physical mutilation in this film.  Obviously that's what the writer/director was after:  something that would make his mark--no matter if it entered the grisly territory of Tarantino Grind-House flicks.  Here's what I'm talking about:  a guy is graphically scalped alive, has his scalp stuffed down his throat, driven in with a spike, and then is held by both legs, splayed upside down, and cleaved in two starting at his genitals.  I don't think Tarantino has managed that trick yet.  Obviously there is a whole clan of people who dig this puke, judging by the reviews.  Some of these people even weigh in on the dialogue, pronouncing it really good.  The dialogue is alternately meandering, pointless, facile and just plain crappy (I'm a screenwriter).  There are all sorts of technical things wrong with this film that brand it an average film-school project.  And let me say one thing about Richard Jenkins, who I don't dislike.  His character is about the most irritating since Jar-Jar Binks--and that's saying something (I was hoping like hell he would get whacked).

There is some tension as we get closer to finding out who the grisly, mute, mystery men are, but its soon lost in really stupid things our protagonists do (like walking down a really narrow passageway right into the hands of the mutes).  The heroine in the film even blames them to their faces: ""that's the problem in the West, stupid men like you!""--and she's on their side.

I wish I would have read a review that came down on this film before I gave in to the free movie deal from Prime--I never would have watched it.  There are certain lines that films can cross which make them unviewable for a variety of reasons:  boring, amateurish, not believable, outrageous to one's sensibilities.

Horror fans may be a bit put off by the meticulously slow build-up, but true fans of westerns will most likely enjoy this 1880's 'road-trip,' where the bulk of the film follows an unlikely posse as they set out to rescue kidnapped members of their town. The last 30 minutes of this production definitely produce enough bite for your buck as to be worth the slow-burn wait. This film is not a stellar classic, but it's definitely worth seeing.

WHAT stands out  is the self sacrifice and quiet heroics displayed by the entire possee.  These are the role models for american heroes.

This movie requires suspension of belief.  But, it aint much of a stretch to imagine a stone age tribe has an evolutionary adaptive communication mechanism.  Charles Darwin  would get a kick out of this flick.

Best flick i have seen lately.  GORE SPOILER ALERT & HU :  Peeps squeamish about vivisection best avoid.

POST POST SCRIPT:  HU sociological issues with "" TROGOLODYTE BREEDERS ""  : a doctoral thesis  could be written on  this subject.  the horror, grotesqueness, originality gives this cinema  great depth.  No shlock here. This is scripted cinema with real crews and A-LIST ACTORS.  SCI-FI WESTERN HORROR ANTHROPOLOGY ...gotta love it.

P.P.P.S. fans of the LAW-OF THE SEA-CUSTOM OF THE SEA-CANNIBALS OF BORNEO-DONNER PARTY

this flick explores CANNIBALISM WITHIN  HOMEO SAPIENS

FINAL THOUGHTS...in a word..
lastly,  these pre-hisotic stone age cave dwelling troglodytes look like ALPHA  FOOD CHAIN PREDATORS...they are large,jacked,fierce and frightening.  Their make-up camo could be real.  Their butchering of human  live captives  is so real it is nauseating, frightening and grotesquely  true to life.  You have to see it.  Not for the squeamish.",1451520000,,1660,5.35546875

7412403,5,B014HDTT84,"Reviews for the most part depend on the time the movie is seen and in this case what I saw before this movie. I saw The Hateful 8 the day before I saw this one. 8 was a brutal and violent movie, or so I thought until I saw this one. Bone Tomahawk is a sneaky film. It starts out slowly introducing characters who aren't that interesting to begin with. Next it has a woman kidnapped and a pose goes to get her back. There are two clues that are given in the first part of movie to peak the viewer's interest. For the first time in Western history the word[please excuse my spelling]Troggaladyke is used. What a prehistoric creature in a Western?  The movie then takes its time with the pose going after the woman, so much so, it begins to drag. However when the pose meets the Troggs things go bloody and violent quickly. While 8 was gun shot violent, the violence here goes into the  horror stomach churning variety.  So much so that you find yourself averting your eyes, or in my 25 year old son's case rewinding to see if he saw what he thought he saw. The word rough doesn't even come close to describing the ending violence. It is fair to say  strange or bizarre  are words that come to mind while watching this movie. However the question is; ""Is movie worth the time it takes to watch it?""
Well that is a hard one. It boils down to a matter of taste. While Hateful 8 messes with the Western genre,  Bone Tomahawk takes Westerns to very dark and bloody area that it has never been.",1451520000,,1486,4.25177304964539

My family watched this film thinking it was a Kurt Russell western (My husband is an Oklahoma cowboy who grew up in the western culture) even though it started pretty slow with boring dialog and superfluous scenes we were enduring it.  Then it became so grotesque and perverted that my daughter screamed and left the room.  Now she is haunted with nightmares.

They were odd with weird idiosyncrasies which would be what people were really like out in wilderness towns. The cannibal barbarians were a particularly brutal and amoral bunch.  They were sneaky and quiet and suddenly blood and extremities flew.  The end was horrid, which i believe was created to make one imagine the unspeakable cultural devices and brutality in barbarian societies that had once roamed the earth.  SPOILER:  One of the barbarians had an unnatural scream which seemed silly, but then we discover he had sliced his neck to place a sort of instrument and let the flesh grow back over it to make it a permanent part of his body.  Then the monstrous scream made sense.  SPOILER CONTINUED:  The tribe had two females which were baby makers.

I think writer-director Zahler was going for a clever, grotesquely satirical horror-Western like ""Ravenous."" But I don't think he got all the way. It's not quite clever or satirical enough, and when it starts to get really grotesque about two-thirds of the way in -- after a rather slow and tedious sag in the middle --  it felt gratuitous and a little desperate to me. It looks great, and you can't fault the actors, who play it all very straight and convincingly. Richard Jenkins is especially fine in a different kind of role for him. I just think the material let them down a bit. It's good, and worth seeing if you're into cult horror and can stomach some gross doings and some ridiculous ones, but it's not as good as I was led to believe",1450915200,,852,4.3924050632911396

Aside from that, I felt it was ok and these were top actors in their day, but it seemed like they did it for some extra retirement coin and the story was too predictable and the ending was a little vague, not to mention you the Native American Professor who could have possibly got help from local tribes, as he did not seem to be a gentleman for tracking, etc. I do recall another strapping young man that was concerned only for his horses, his butt should have gone along too!! Too many flaws in the film, too much graphic gore and blood, pushing the shock value instead of better storyline.  I'm not a director, nor should I be, as only I would like my films!!  I think this had great potential to be a very good film, but fell short somewhere in between the beginning and the end. oh, and the dynamite, what about the dynamite? why did they leave that out?

Nothing too over the top too often, but not much in terms of building characters that I care too much about. the only guy with any general sense of interest was Brooder. He spoke as flat as paper but was the only guy who really had any sense for the mission they had to embark on. Kurt Russell's character just made a lot of bad decisions for a sheriff, and the old man was too caught in tradition for right and wrong.

*POTENTIAL SPOILERS*

They just made too many little mistakes, no alternating shifts when sleeping, no one is ever watching their surroundings during exchanges, and the one thing they do take from their enemy was somehow taken before deciding to take their weapon? It just didn't sit well with me.

I suppose the natives were still being learned about so they tried too much to match western culture politics with native guerrilla savagery and it just really didn't work out too well.

It's beautifully shot. That guy deserves an award. The snappy dialogue and comraderie here with this killer ensemble cast is where it shines.

Now folks say here it's a ""horror"" movie. I disagree. Think ""dark thriller"". It's violent the way war is violent, but I think in the context of the story it's more of an accent piece.

This is one of the better westerns in a long time, and it does have some little horror aspects thrown in to spice it up. The movie is really just another hunt and chase film but it had something extra that made it seem exciting and kept me watching all the way to the end wanting to see what happens next.

It was pretty long considering there wasn't a whole lot of action, but that being said, I was never bored. It seemed to all build up toward the end which made it good for watching once, but probably not a second time after you know where it is all going. For me, there wasn't enough action to sustain watching the 2+ hours again. The end of the movie really turned my stomach. There were a couple scenes when they finally get to the ""bad guys"" that just didn't fit the style of a western, though maybe that isn't what they were going for. They introduce some scenes more suited for a horror movie which really turned me off. As much as I sound like I hated it, I didn't.

7412564,5,B014HDTT84,"One of the more intense movies I've seen this year, Bone Tomahawk delivers in storytelling, acting, cinematography and gore. I've always been a fan of stories pitting main characters in thrilling situations, especially when the characters are ones I care for. In this film, I quickly became attached to our four main heroes. The actors portrayed them very well. While all four performances standout, I have to give credit to Matthew Fox.

His character is probably the most mysterious of the four, and receives the least amount of screen time, but Fox delivered one helluva performance.

All in all, Bone Tomahawk was a thrilling ride, and probably delivers one of the more gruesome death scenes I've ever seen.",1449014400,,711,5.016949152542373

The acting of the leading men is fantastic, especially Matthew Fox. I didn't even realize that was him until near the end. Although it's a bit slow in places, it more than makes up for it once the action comes. I'm on board to see any Western with Kurt Russell (and his mustache) in it and he didn't disappoint in this. If you're into Westerns I think you'll enjoy it. Just be warned it is graphically violent and not a typical Western. I'd say it is more realistic than anything, which for the time meant brutality.

It's also now my second favorite Kurt Russel movie (John Carpenter's The Thing being first). Bone Tomahawk is a revenge tale about four guys going out after Patrick Wilson's character's wife who has been kidnapped by a cannibalistic tribe of indians. The acting is superb across the board, with Richard Jenkins standing out as a doctor missing a few bolts. He's great comic relief. This movie is equal parts western and horror with enough humor to make it campy. It has some sparse but extremely gruesome violence to please horror fans and stays true enough to the time period in which it takes place to please western fans as well. It is a slow burn but watching all four main actors perform so admirably makes the wait for the bloodletting worth every second. I loved it.",1448841600,,922,4.526946107784431

Acting; 5 stars
Cinematography; 5 stars
Writing/dialogue; 5 stars
Realism; 5 stars until....
Story; wow, fell short, 2 stars.
Direction; 5 stars
Everything was great until the characters started making truly unbelievable decisions that was beneath their characters.
As in, hey, lets all go into the ""hideout"" all in a group, always.
Let's not think.
Now I understand the references of other reviews saying it's a Western/HORROR.
Because in horror movies you have stupid people doing stupid things.
This was done from the 45 minute mark.
Unusually grotesque? ---->no.
I've seen more crap on TV more violent/gory.
Believable cannibalism; Yes
I really wanted to like it, really.
But I have a brain.  And I use it.
If I was in the same situation I would aim for the balls, as the ""tusk guy"" did with Kurt with the gun.
Is it really to hard to think you would fight to stay alive?
Apparently the writer felt he had to make the, whatever his name was, the hero by saving the day.
I disagree with people saying it lagged; it DID NOT.
It built and built until the disappointing end due to the story fizzling out.
Really good acting, except what's his face.(second lead)
And the sex scene was the only thing gratuitous.
We get it, you're married.
But banging your wife with a totally hairless chest in 1891?
More like cheap porn.
I think the ""cave dwellers"" did well also.
Looked like and acted like Indian cannibals.
I did think it was creepy, as intended.

The story is about a Sheriff, his ""second"" deputy, a doctor, and a gentleman/Indian killer who track down the doctor's wife, a deputy, and a jailed murderer - who were kidnapped by cannibals who live in a remote part of the west. The story is interesting but very slow moving at parts. There is a lot of gruesome violence so this movie is not for the faint of heart. This movie does make you think. The cannibal tribe is extremely odd, but certainly possible given the diversity of human behavior. The acting is terrific and in my opinion the ""second deputy"" steals the show, but Kurt Russell and all the other actors deliver solid performances.

This film should never have been released with this NR rating it is worse than any X rating they ever gave out. Director S. Craig Zahler should never be given the reigns again.

I have never been a huge fan of the western genre. I liked Tombstone, Young Guns and that's pretty much it, but this movie was great! The actors dialogue was fun and clever. The middle meat of this film did a fantastic job developing the characters and making the audience root for them. If you have a queasy stomach or are easily put off by graphic violence, then this film is not for you. The gore was done in a way that truly complimented the story and made a horror nut love this film!

The entire affair is always marching towards the big finish with skillfully built tension and mystery. Impatient viewers of modern films  especially those expecting a wild action-horror film  will be sorely disappointed with this film. But fans of traditional westerns who can appreciate a slow-burning build will definitely enjoy. Every actor in this film is often underrated and underappreciated elsewhere, but they all turn in sterling performances here.

The action is expertly framed with a clear sense of space and direction. The arrows can always be clearly seen as they are fired all the way to where they land, a very simple but novel trick compared to modern FX-heavy films. The violence and gore are very limited, but its explosive bursts are all very well done. There is one gruesome sequence that is arguably one of the most extreme acts ever recorded on film, yet it is still handled with class and services the overall plot.

But if a viewer can settle in for the ride, enjoys their time with the colorful heroes, they will take a hard and strange journey to a fun and frightening conclusion.",1448582400,9,1285,4.935185185185185

It's a slow movie, but the characters develop well as the movies evolves.  The movie was not what I expected and for that, I tip my hat to it.

As others have said, this falls in the genre of western horror and has an ""Aliens/Predator"" movie feel to it and when it comes to the horror part, it is very well executed.  The best part about it is that, unlike Predator with it's giant man hunting cockroach from outer space, this movie is much more believable and the slow pace of the movie not only makes it that much more believable, but it had the guard down effect on the viewer.  All together, it makes for a well done spooky movie with an original story line.

Could it have been better...sure, but to be honesty with you at the end I wanted more.  I hope a couple of those bad guys managed to stay alive to make a sequel or two :-)",1448496000,2,985,4.1798941798941796

Bone Tomahawk is an adult, spooky, violent western type horror movie that really takes me back to when movies were enjoyable.  It has a simple set up: lady gets abducted - posse sets out to find her, but what makes this movie so great is the small things.  Richard Jenkins is absolutely outstanding (seriously...academy), Russell is always great, and Patrick Wilson and Matthew Fox deliver fantastic supporting roles.  The screenwriting is witty and true and you never feel like you are left outside of the loop.  In a world where superhero movies seem to kill all the enjoyment out of film this movie will take you back.  It's constantly violent, original, and vivid in its storytelling.  Nothing suits this movie more than a bucket of popcorn and your couch.  Whatever Amazon is charging to rent this film you should happily pay the price and enjoy a night in...a...story instead of CGI wonderment-battle-earth-is-going-to-die-again crap that seems to just take over the film industry these days.  If you want a great story, great acting, great writing, and great cinematography go ahead and look to the top right of the page and click the link that allows you to purchase/rent this wonderful film.  This movie will be on my dvd shelf right next to Tombstone, Unforgiving, and Open Range.  If you love westerns, for whatever reason, this is going to be at the top of a very short list.

The unlikely 2015 western/horror film ""Bone Tomahawk"" has a similar expedition, as a quartet of mismatched men reluctantly travel into mysterious worlds to rescue family and friends. But where these men travel is far more nightmarish than anything imagined in the beloved John Wayne epic.

For me, ""Bone Tomahawk"" is a demented, brilliant film with ""Cult"" written all over it. If John Carpenter ever made that western he had talked about for so many years, I would like to think it would have been something like this. Critics have made comparisons to John Ford's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Searchers-Blu-ray/dp/B000JLSM00/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Searchers [Blu-ray</a>].

Richard Jenkins is a wonder as usual in the Walter Brennan-like role of Chicory. Kurt Russell, as Sheriff Franklin Hunt, is of course the sturdy Wayne. Patrick Wilson is perhaps the handicapped, love-struck characters played by Dean Martin or Robert Mitchum? And Matthew Fox gives the best performance of his career as the well-groomed gunfighter.

Surprisingly, this is a character-driven story with the dialogue poetic and the pace gentle. I loved camping with these men, and I would not cut a single minute from this two-plus hour journey so reliant on mood. I'm convinced we should not take ""Bone Tomahawk"" at face value. As we see from a glimpse of a tombstone, it takes place in 1891, and for anyone who knows their history such Native American threats as displayed in this film had long ago come to an end.

""Bone Tomahawk"" has a quirky, supernatural aura as these men travel into unknown worlds with an uncomfortable sense of doom. I wasn't sure what the ending would be as they stumbled towards this Valley of Death. These four men are riding to the rescue of souls kidnapped from their small town by an unknown tribe of demonic, cannibalistic, cave-dwelling Indians. There's a nasty scene, more violent than anything in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Walking-Dead-Season-1/dp/B0049P1VHS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Walking Dead: Season 1</a>, that almost capsizes the work. But I think it added to the surprise of the conclusion.

""Bone Tomahawk,"" is the debut of writer/director S. Craig Zahler, an author (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wraiths-of-the-Broken-Land/dp/1935738364/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wraiths of the Broken Land</a>) and musician with a mesmerizing ability with dialogue. There are lines so fiercely original as to be euphoric. Zahler has given us an inspired combination of western/horror, and what a joy to discover such a creative work.

7412617,5,B014HDTT84,Awesome film!! Kurt Russell is a western badass!!,1448409600,,49,5.25
7412618,3,B014HDTT84,"The Western is arguably the most American of all genres. It's where we get our definition of a ""tough guy hero"" from one; we imagine John Wayne's swagger and quick hand on the trigger. While the genre has gone through some lean periods, the last couple of years have seen a revival of sorts. In 2015 alone there have been multiple films taking audiences to the dangerous, dusty Old West. Later this year Quentin Tarantino will follow up his Django Unchained with another Western, The Hateful Eight, but his star Kurt Russell has saddled up for the equally violent and awesomely-titled Bone Tomahawk, which is also worth checking out despite a few pacing issues.

Directed by author S. Craig Zahler, Bone Tomhawk isn't your typical Western, although it sticks to the straight-line structure most of those films have. As the name suggests it's very much a horror, too, and one that goes for maximum gore factor rather than scares. Russell stars as small-town Sheriff Franklin Hunt who gathers up a posse to locate missing doctor Samantha O'Dwyer (Lili Simmons) and a petty outlaw (David Arquette) after they've been kidnapped by cannibalistic ""troglodytes"". Along for the journey is a motley crew that includes Samantha's injured husband Arthur (Patrick Wilson), old deputy Chicory (Richard Jenkins, a scene-stealer), and brash gunslinger John Brooker (Matthew Fox).

So there's quite the tremendous cast here, and Zahler gets the best from them all, giving them space to acclimate to the gradual rhythms of the genre.  There isn't a ton of violence but when it happens it's brutal, stomach-churning stuff involving arrows and hatchets and things that tear people limb from limb. One especially nasty mutilation later may be the grossest kill anyone will see on screen this year. To describe it would be to spoil it, and audiences deserve to discover that queasy moment for themselves. What's most interesting is how easily the film explores male identity and masculinity, trademark themes of the Old West, while successfully embracing horror elements. Zahler mixes in a good deal of dark gallows humor, usually told by the great Richard Jenkins, and the dialogue has a surprisingly theatrical, Shakespearean flair that is always engaging.

The deliberate pacing becomes an issue with the 2-hour plus runtime, and the drab, dust-covered locale doesn't help. There's also the sense that more could have been done with Russell's character, who is basically a one-note rawhide cowboy with little else to offer. Other than Jenkins it's Wilson who fares the best, once again playing the guy who is masculine in appearance but lacking in intestinal fortitude. It's what he does and he's good at it. Bone Tomahawk may be too much of a slow burn, overall, but there's a very specific audience out there who are going to love the way it combines Westerns and horror while respecting them both.",1448323200,22,2882,5.0610526315789475

7412655,3,B014HDTT84,"""Bone Tomahawk"" director/writer S. Craig Zahler takes a no nonsense approach to his western horror story. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. The writing is taunt with solid dialog while the direction is languid allowing the tension to arise, not out of rapid editing, but the characters and their mission which they know will likely end one way.

The major issues with the film has to do with pacing and the low budget of the film. While he's pulled together a stellar cast, the town is woefully under populated for a film set in the old west. There's a lot of good here including terrific performances which elevates the film even through some poorly staging by first time (well he did direct a short before but this is S. Craig Zahler's first major motion picture).

I can see why the script circulated and was considered one of the best unproduced screenplays but the film could use stronger direction. Those looking for a wham bam horror flick will be disappointed. Those looking for a strong traditional western will also be disappointed.

SPOILERS:

After robbers stumble on the hidden and sacred burial ground of a tribe of Indians, they are followed back to a small town fierce cannibal Indians--a lost tribe--and they kidnap the locals. The town sheriff (Kurt Russell) takes a posse including his deputy (Richard Jenkins) the doctor's husband ( Patrick Wilson) and athe town dandy (Matthew Fox), who is much more than he appears to be, to retrieve kidnapped locals including the town doctor (Lilli Simmons) before they are eaten.

END OF SPOILERS

One of the most successful aspects of the film is the brilliant casting. Everyone works well in their roles bringing an authentic feel to their characters. Keep in mind this is a movie that build slowly but when it does reach its explosive conclusion it is an effective payoff. Genre blending has become a common way to revive genres exhausted by over exploitation. ""B"" movies have been given ""A"" budgets and become blockbusters. I'm not against that mind you as long as they are creative, interesting and there's still room for smaller dramas. ""Now Tomahawk"" does all three surprising well. The smaller dramatic moments happens as our rescue party tracks the cannibal Indians but don't expect an action packed big budget horror movie. ""Bone"" works best in its quieter and intense moments. This westhorror (yep I made up a silly word for this genre mishmash) has a sense of dread as an undercurrent feeling throughout the film but doesn't always work due to some slack direction and uncertain pacing from a first time director.

The Blu-ray looks quite nice with a solid transfer. Detail is extremely good here. Audio is also quite strong with a nice 5.1 mix that adds atmosphere to the film.

The special features are skimpy at best. I was hoping and expecting a commentary from the director and the cast. We don't get it. We do get a Q&A session with the director and cast from Fantastic Fest where the film was presented to strong praise. We also get a single deleted scenescene, a making of featurette and image gallery. It's very disappointing considering WHAT could have been done here. It would have been nice to also see a featurette focusing on how the film got bounced with high praise from script readers and studios but production stalling.

Is ""Bone Tomahawk"" a great movie? Nope. It is, however, a good hybrid feature film with terrific casting, strong writing but the film could have used a stronger editor and director.",1448236800,,3502,4.842809364548495

I only saw the trailer and the movie poster which reminded me of Tombstone, a must watch I thought. Well this movie did not disappoint, unlike that embarrassing piece with Harrison Ford and Craig James this movie did a great job combining different genres together. Like others in their reviews I warn that the third act in the film is not for the faint of heart. It caught my wife and myself by surprise. That scene is by far the most shocking gore I have seen (on film) and I have done combat tours.

This is a fantastic film. To me, Kurt Russell has never felt so real on screen. We take him for granted, but Richard Jenkins nails yet another role. The entire cast gives surprisingly rich performances and the writing feels more authentic than most 20th Century Westerns. The cinematography is decent and the direction never gets in the way.

The gory parts are very disturbing and graphic, but probably some of the best I've seen, because it did make me feel sick to watch. I'm not a huge fan of gory horror films, so I probably should've looked into it a little more beforehand, so that's my own fault. Kurt Russell still looks amazing, and did not disappoint.

Couldn't they have used a more period specific word -- anything but Troglodyte.  Warning, VERY DISTURBING violent scenes. They are images that once seen cannot be unseen so enter with caution!

I really enjoyed the performances as much as the story.  And the filming captures beautiful vistas, a realistic Western town, 1800's homes, and a few claustrophobic sets really well.

Much did not make sense.  If there is going to be an R rating make it an R movie.  A few scenes of gore and the briefest of brief nudity was not worth the R rating.

7412779,2,B014HDTT84,"This movie is sometimes hilariously bad. It is too bad because the trailer and premise looked like it could have been really good. It looked like it could have been a gritty, realistic, yet poetic movie about the Old West. I was hoping that it would update and innovate the Western the way that ""Unforgiven"" did in the early '90s. However, what is left out of the trailer is the fact that this is a sometimes absurd horror movie infused with a Western. It also took that surreal twist of being a slasher flick/comedy. I've never really understood why, but many horror films punctuate their slasher gore-fest with weird and surprising moments of comedy. I've never really gotten that, as the two emotions don't really seem to mix. Like we're laughing along, and all of a sudden someone gets their leg chopped off. It's like ""Uh......ok."" I never understood the tone shift, and can't understand how anyone else would either.

I'm not sure this movie is worth the ink, but for what it's worth, I'll explain it: A mysterious tribe of pre-Native American people live in the wilderness beyond the edge of civilization in the wild west. A couple of vagabond bandits wander into their territory, disrespecting their burial grounds. One is killed. The other survives, and treks back to a small, unsuspecting Western town. Living a life of robbing people and moving on, he is found out by the sheriff. He tries to escape, but is shot. A female doctor attends to his wounded leg, but in the night, she, the bandit, and a deputy are tracked by the hostile tribe, abducted, and brought back to their primitive village. The sheriff, his assistant, the doctor's husband, and a local townsman who is assisting them take off into the desert to try to track and find the natives and their victims.

The bottom line is this: if millions of dollars are being thrown around, and people are taking movies so seriously, they need to be way better than this. I get the strong feeling that the writer/director Crag Zahler was really just having fun, but at the end of the day, this movie feels like a friend just pulling a stupid prank on you. He's the only one laughing at the end of the day. The audience is not. That is just to explain the tone shifts, the gore, and overall premise. To be honest, there were actually a few scenes in there that got me laughing. The piece de resistance had to be the old man's soliloquy at the end about the flea circus. What is really odd is that writer-director Craig Zahler really seems like an intelligent guy who really researched the 1800s and its dialogue thoroughly, and got the historical aspects just right. All to throw it away on a zany slasher flick. The cast was also reasonably talented: Patrick Wilson can be awesome, as he was in ""The A-Team,"" and Matthew Fox was surprisingly good as a somber cowboy. There are also a sprinkling of good acting jobs throughout, but it was all crumpled up and thrown away on a ridiculously stupid plot.

At the end of the day, I'm not really mad at this movie, I see that writer-director Craig Zahler was just having fun. It's just that the movie is mostly four guys trudging through the desert for way too long, punctuated by moments of brainless gore and the occasional ""pretty funny"" joke. The funny jokes take up about 20% of this movie, though, and the rest is a throwaway. Like I said, it's like a friend pulling a stupid stunt on you, and you're standing there smiling because he's laughing, but you're not laughing yourself. Overall, I sort of smile at this movie because I see the author's intent, but I really kind of wish I had my money and my two hours back.",1447372800,,3631,4.574500768049155
7412780,3,B014HDTT84,"Ambitious but only halfway successful western about a posse that is formed to try and save a several people who were abducted from town by a cannibalistic tribe of cave dwellers referred to as ""troglodytes"" by the town's lone Indian who insists who insists the perpetrators aren't Indians at all (they have no name or language) and that the white men wouldn't be able to distinguish them from Indians (he's wrong there--they look more like the tribe from Cannibal Holocaust than anything you would normally see in a western).

This starts off promisingly with a creepy opening scene featuring Sid Haig and David Arquette as violent bushwhackers who cut men's throats while they sleep and steal anything of value.  Unfortunately for them while running from the sounds of what might be a pursuing posse they wander into something a whole lot worse.

Early on the intelligent dialogue and smart characters make Bone Tomahawk unusually pleasing but writer/director S Craig Zahler has no idea how to generate any tension in the middle section of the film as his (mostly) doomed possess travel closer and closer to their ultimate destination.  Bone Tomahawk ultimately becomes a bit of a drag until the cowboys finally meet up with the cannibalistic tribe, with reasonably unpredictable but predictably violent results.

While the last section of the film is no Cannibal Holocaust in terms of graphic violence it still might be a bit much for some viewers more accustomed to what you might see in old-fashioned westerns, so consider yourself warned.

The cast is very good.  Kurt Russell is already a veteran of the genre so it's not exactly a surprise that he fits in so well, but Patrick Wilson, Richard Jenkins, Matthew Fox and David Arquette all provide memorable turns.  Bone Tomahawk is also unusually handsome for a non-theatrical release western.  While low budget westerns were a staple of old Hollywood right up until the peak of the spaghetti western the latest crop of straight-to-video westerns simply don't look right since they are clearly shot on digital video, giving them an overly crisp ""modern"" look that feels completely wrong for the genre.  Bone Tomahawk looks like a real western and even features the kind of song over the end credits that would have played at the beginning in an earlier era when the western was king.

But Bone Tomahawk is ultimately more of a nice try than an actual success, attempting to mix some smart Deadwood style banter and a dollop of modern violence into what frequently feels like an homage to classic westerns from the 1950's, with Kurt Russell in the John Wayne role and Patrick Wilson in the Jimmy Stewart part.  It should please fans of the genre who don't mind a little violence but isn't likely to make people who don't like westerns much change their minds.  It also doesn't transcend the genre like Wesley Snipe's underrated Gallowwalkers (2012), which more effectively blended horror and western into something different.  Bone Tomahawk never quite seems willing to push its horror elements far enough to make much of an impression, which is too bad because a creepier Bone Tomahawk likely would have been a lot more interesting.",1447372800,5,3187,4.966165413533835

The second act contains mostly the journey of the four protagonists full of dialogue and dynamic sound. I found most of the suspense to come from anticipation of encountering the ""monsters.""

This is one of the worst western movies Ive ever seen because of the following reasons:

Many scenes look like they are not connected with each other.  For example, during the first five minutes, something deadly happens to one of the two robbers. The next 40 minutes show 2 scenes. One is a man with a broken leg and his wife in his home. The other is the sheriff talking to a man in his office and then to people in a bar. I see no connection between these scenes for approximately 45 minutes!

The film is 2 hours and 12 minutes long (imdb.com). No wonder its dragging and dragging. For instance, from my comment above, from the 6th minute to the 45th minute, the characters just talk and talk. There is no suspense or action during this time. According to imdb dot com, its estimated budget is 1.8 million dollars and it shows.

If anything, I actually would have enjoyed a bit more character building along the characters' journey to  their foreboding destination.

What a dichotomy of talent and artfulness... first of all, the set design, costuming, dialogue and delivery of same, along with the characters' interactions were all top-notch. So, why only two stars? The troglodytes!!! They are describes by the native American who knows the word troglodytes but claims they are just inbred cannibals who rape and butcher and eat their mothers and live in a remote cave that, as we find out, is so far off the beaten path that heretofore, no one has known of their existence and, yet, they have plenty of unwilling victims to fall prey to their cannibalistic ways.

As to the representation of the trogs themselves... they are very healthy in appearance having an abundance of body fat, not obese but well-rounded. Ever see a human that has lived primarily if not solely on meat? They ain't fat! (Ain't used for emphasis) and, as to being inbred that's a bit hard to do when you eat your own mothers! Obviously the pregnant women we see are young, well-nourished, and, if they are ""sisters"" then we are at the end of the trail for this little clan of cannibalistic misfits.

Second of all, the rescuers rely on a string with tin cans to ""guard their camp"" and then ALL of them trundle off to beddie-bye? What a load of crap! I have horse packed in the Wyoming mountains for thirty years and, if in grizzly country, I damn sure make certain that one of us two-legged critters is awake at all times. So much for the ""raid""!

I was shocked that Kurt Russell was even in such a horrible movie.

SPOILER ALERTS

reading a horrible letter in bed was stupid and unnecessary
Walking through the desert in what was supposed to be a 5 day ride by horse and they make it on foot in 2 nights.
This entire movie doesn't add up

The so called Indians had to be people taken right off the streets.
When the so called indians butchered the deputy it was laughable.
Terrible acting, bad timing in fights and while in the caves, even the caves looked cheap and like a high school play.

That will be the big take-away from the movie. Please don't have any children around when you watch it and I would not suggest eating lasagna toward the end of the movie.

The premise of cannibalistic Indians caused a chill up my spine but I thought the plot of a wife being kidnapped and a four man posse pursuing the bad guys might be a bit idealistic. Why not a bigger posse I kept saying to myself! But it worked fine and there was a touch of dry humor thrown in. Some might think it was a bit long but for me it really built suspense in wondering what was at the end of the journey! All in all a very good flick!,1446595200,,565,3.9649122807017543

The violence is realistic...in that wounds are inflicted at close range. No unrealistic sharp shooting or knife throwing. And that is what makes it a bit unbearable when the level of violence ratchets up to gory heights. The brutality I suppose, is what heightens the fear and tension as to the enemy the group faces. But be forewarned, it is incredibly graphic. A one shot watch for me. A good movie as far as the dialog and acting by an impressive cast. No frills. Just a bare bones encounter with a malevolent force whose imagination is limited to how many ways they can torture and dismember. Not for everyone.",1446595200,,755,4.5588235294117645

I was surprised how much I enjoyed Matthew Fox's performance, but Richard Jenkins stole the show - his small character was very well written and performed. The plot was very straightforward and moved a wee bit slow. The brutality of the native people was pretty over the top. Bone Tomahawk movie reminded me quite a bit of Ravenous, a 1999 Guy Pierce movie about cannibal frontiersman. It's well-acted and super-grisly, but the plot moves at a much crisper pace.

7412989,5,B014HDTT84,"Absolutely loved this movie!  Loved it so much that I purchased it right after renting it.

I'm a horror fan and a western fan, so when I heard this western/horror hybrid movie was coming out, I was beyond excited.  I had high hopes and 99% of the time when I go into a movie with high hopes, it doesn't live up to my expectations.  This one totally did!  It is everything I hoped it to be and more.

The movie begins with a bang and let's you in on what's in store.  The bulk of the movie is a slow delicious burn.  Amazing tension.  Since I watch a lot of horror movies, it's become harder and harder for me to feel scared or tense during a movie.  This movie left me with a tight feeling in my stomach throughout  because I cared for the characters and you just know things aren't going to go well for them.  The dialogue was funny at times, thoughtful and very human.

I'm scratching my head at the one-star reviews that this movie is ""boring"" or that you should skip straight to the end.  If you need non-stop action (or a very short attention span), then yeah, this isn't the movie for you.  If you care for quality filmmaking, good storytelling, and three-dimensional characters - where the journey is just as important as the destination - then this is the movie for you.

I should add that there is a very violent scene near the end that may be unsettling for some viewers.  I don't think that's a spoiler since the whole movie is building up to it.  The scene is not what you normally see in mainstream movies, and it even took me - a rabid horror fan - by surprise.  But I hope the violence doesn't keep you away from enjoying this well-done movie - may I suggest covering your eyes?  You kinda can guess when the ""event"" is about to happen anyway.

This brings trouble to the town of Bight Hope which results in a rescue party attempt into the home of the ""Troglodyte"" cave dwellers who would ""rape and eat their own mothers.""

This is a slightly different plot for a western, however it is just a different setting for a horror/slasher film without much horror. The film starts off by capturing your interest. It builds character, then slows, then hits you again. Then if drags (literally as one guy has a broken leg) as we spend too much time of our rescue group going after the cannibals.

7413022,5,B014HDTT84,"This film tells a brilliant story about the old West. It may very well owe some of its techniques to the Coen brothers, who always make seemingly banal dialogue fascinating and full of meaning. But whether or not the writer/director Zahler learned his techniques from the Coen brothers, this is a wonderfully original film. The character development is flawless, the dialogue is wonderfully realistic and often humorous in its authenticity, the horror is brief and quite frightening. I would just say to the folks who were grossed out by the violence and rated the film negatively: IT'S JUST A MOVIE!!! Don't forget that. If the violence upsets you that much, then something other than the movie itself is bothering you.

Some reviewers complain about the middle third dragging, but I didn't find this movie boring at any point. All of the characters were very interesting and I don't think there was any padding. It's all about character development and plot complications.

Kurt Russell is at the top of his game and it is a perfect ensemble cast accompanying him. I watched it twice, and all I can say is: excellent film-making.",1446336000,,1131,4.9162303664921465

7413090,1,B014HDTT84,"This is undoubtedly one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time.  I watched this movie at my sister's house through Amazon Streaming Video, and she is also in agreement with my assessment. I have read other reviews and I can't believe this movie received a 88 % rating on Rotten Tomatoes. The plot is easy to follow -  people being abducted by a band of cave dwelling ancient Indians called Troglodytes in a western setting. A small band of misfits, a poor excuse for a posse, trails them to return their abductees, and leash Hades on the cave dwellers. What struck as the most destructive element of this movie was the poor use of the camera. It reminded me of the movie, Cloverfield, when people actually got sick (motion sickness) from the jerky motion of the camera. The director's inexperience clearly came through on these amateurish scenes.  The dialogue was choppy and hard to follow, and the transitions between scenes was also choppy and completely annoying and hard to follow. There was also no outstanding character, outside of Kurt Russell, the reluctant leader, who does not have a presence like John Wayne in a classic John Ford western. The tone of the movie is a jumbled collection of personal emotions that mix like water and oil, from the awkward love scene, to the violent death of the captives by the weird Indians.  And I get the fact that the posse consists of older men, and a wounded man with a bad leg, misfits to say the least, on a mission to save the world, only to get captured, and then saved by the wounded man.  A classic case of the underdog overcoming all obstacles to win the day.  My overall assessment is for people in the movie industry to stop taking drugs and trying to make movies. This movie is the end result of a generation of social media, underachievers with no advanced life skills and a poor work ethic, with emotional problems, thinking they can rely on said media, to propel this movies into a position it can never attain in the rating world, no matter how many times your friends post how good the movie is on social media.  Kurt Russell could not save this movie, and I think he realizes he made a mistake starring in the movie. Overall, the imagery was poor, the music was poor, and I get it that the Indians had some form of tracheotomy to make weird sounds, but it did come off to save the movie. My advice to people, save your money and watch a classic move like, Invasion of the The Body Snatchers, with Kevin McCarthy, and then watch one of the best westerns ever made, The Searchers, with John Wayne. Then you'll get your fix of horror with a western, with a perfect mix of genres.",1446249600,,2649,4.483402489626556

Worst dialogue ive ever heard in a modern western, no economy and often painful to listen too.  There's no crowds no life in the town, almost all shots are narrow sets, and obvious ones at that.  The outside scenes could have all been filmed on the same twenty acres.  The individual characters storylines were thin, the initial cave scene were the rope thrown out and then purportedly landed was so incongruous as to be insulting.  The cave set was again just an artless set with no attempt to breathe life into it.  Act 3, although brutal, held few surprises nor did the ending.  Oh. I guess its over.  This film might deserve some credit for being the first crossover in terms of blending western with a horror genre, but if so they had an artistic obligation to make it a goody.

The final act of this film is a little bit of a mess, with graphic violence taking the place of slow horror. One scene in particular is a rough watch, and seems a little out place in the film.

It essentially takes a standard Western trope - kidnapped by Indians - and tweaks it into something fresh and compelling. Infusing a Western with horror elements is not as novel as it might seem, but it works well. The last 30-40 minutes of the film are brutally grim, filled with stretches of well-crafted tension.

That said, the pace of the film is very deliberate. I thought there was plenty going on throughout the whole thing to keep things interesting, but I'm sure some people would disagree. Those looking for a film packed with action and classic Western shootouts should look elsewhere.

The savages could not have been more savage, but their actions were on par with their intellect and ritualistic behavior.

I had wondered what had happened to Kurt Russell as of late, and here he puts in a very good job of portraying the honorable sheriff. Another thing to consider with this is it develops its characters very well, to where all of them make you care about what happens to them.

It's quirky and violent and talky but I found the long journey the posse had to take, and the bonding they went through on it, to be enjoyable. All of the acting was good. Even David Arquette in basically a cameo was good. I feel that if you know that the word cannibal is attached to anything that you can expect some pretty gnarly material and BT definitely has it. It's a slow build up to something terrible but you can sense it coming from the journey if you're paying attention.

It starts out like a traditional Western: some townsfolk are kidnapped by a mysterious band of renegades, and a posse made up of the sheriff, his old deputy, an arrogant, indian-hating aristocratic gunslinger and the husband of the kidnapped woman set out on a rescue mission. Admittedly, the middle 1/3 was a bit slow, but never dragged, using the time to really develop the characters. The dialog was interesting, original and had a rhythm all its own. The 4 main actors were awesome, but Richard Jenkins as the ""back-up"" deputy steals the show, not an easy feat with Kurt Russell at the top of his acting game.

It took a bit of a dive when the uber violence commenced in the last 1/4 or so.  Implausible natives at best, especially the women.  Still, worth a watch.",1445731200,,254,4.704545454545454

7413185,3,B014HDTT84,"I don't quite know how to rate this film but I feel it deserves comment.  Up until a certain scene toward the end, I would've given it 5 stars.  Make that 4 since I feel it's in desperate need of a good musical score.  The story, the characters, the dialogue, the casting, the acting, all excellent in my opinion, outstanding in places.  I felt there was a lot of potential for a great film.

But then... that awful scene.  I'm not particularly squeamish and I knew what the story was about.  But this was too over-the-top even for this story, bizarrely intrusive like it didn't fit the tone of the rest of the film.  The ickiness took me out of the story and there was no going back.",1445731200,2,684,4.2890625

7413188,5,B014HDTT84,"A Western with a horrific take. The cast and writing was outstanding and made for a genuine western period piece. I felt the direction for first timer S. Craig Zahler was pretty descent. The movie definitely had no budget, but made up for it in the Acting and dialogue between characters. As far as the Horror aspect of the movie, it was a little bit of a slow burn, which I don't have a problem with especially when it pays off, which it did. Some of the scenes were cringe worthy and gruesome. I love westerns and I love horror movies. I would recommend this if your a fan of genre.",1445731200,,584,4.27027027027027
7413189,2,B014HDTT84,Should have waited for this movie to be free on Prime. I'm a boomer wanting to see western's the way they used to be.

7413199,4,B014HDTT84,"Very cool idea to mix terrifying horror with a western.  Some town folk get kidnapped by some cannibal cave dwellers.  Kurt and his gang of four go and try to rescue them.  The movie starts up with a taste of action and violence but then goes for a long time with lots of talk to set up character and plot.  Then the climax happens and it is brutal to watch.  For the sensitive crowds...Be Warned!!!!  If you can't handle The Walking Dead type of gore, this movie is not for you!!!  Excellent acting and suspense make this movie worth a watch for us gore hounds.  I still think they could've cut 20 minutes out of it to move it a tad bit faster, but this is an Indy film.",1445731200,,671,4.147286821705427

After a second viewing I now see the directors genius. Every scene, every cut, every word was well crafted and percise. I believe I was manipulated to feel what the director wanted me to feel: what the characters felt.
What's negative about this film? It is not for everyone.",1445731200,3,469,4.529411764705882
7413201,1,B014HDTT84,"Just awful. I expected much more from this cast but this is a poor excuse for a movie. Bad plot, bad acting, very repetitive action, and one amazingly over the top gratuitous violent scene. Really one of the worst movies I've seen in years.",1445644800,5,240,4.4772727272727275

At two hours and 10 minutes, it is far too long.  The first half is downright cumbersome.  Scenes overstay their welcome, often because the script is enamored to a fault with its own ""adorable,"" self-aware, Tarantino-lite dialogue.  The artificiality of the cyclical, verbose yes-sir-no-ma'am-yield-yer-repeater-and-rest-yer-hide banter slides the film toward camp, though a fine cast (Matthew Fox stands out as a dandy with a violent, Indian-hunting past) and a handsome aesthetic push in another, saltier, more grounded direction.  The film becomes considerably more involving and satisfying in the second half as the characters focus and draw closer to a direct confrontation with the antagonists, who are truly menacing and mysterious.",1445644800,5,973,5.636986301369863
7413203,4,B014HDTT84,People who say Kurt must be desperate are retarded.  This is easily the best movie he has been in as one of the lead roles since Breakdown in 1997.  He has been in a long list of stinkers since then aside from small supporting roles.,1445644800,,233,4.155555555555556

Thought provoking - i spent an hour or so afterwards researching elements of the script for veracity ... in particular the pueblo cultures of america, early and 17 and 18 century.  Long movie but i never fast forwarded as i am won't to do.  Great acting.  Long movie. Not a horror movie but is very vivid. Scary only in the sense of verisimilitude!

8730741,5,B014HDTT84,"So many of the reviews on here seemed to be fixated on the notorious ""scene in the cave."" Either you loved it or loathed it -- there is definitely no in-between feeling regarding it. I happened to not only love it but as several reviewers have previously stated, thought it was necessary to show/see it. Just as the middle third of the film feels rather slow and a bit tedious, it is meant to put us, the viewer, in the proverbial shoes of the characters we are watching. The filmmakers want us to feel what Sheriff Franklin Hunt and the others are feeling. And boy, do we ever!",1535500800,,578,4.361111111111111
8730742,3,B014HDTT84,"Kurt Russel was excellent. Richard Jenkins was charming.  The plot is basically ""hillbilly cannibal family"" with a Western genre twist...but not much of one. Standard redneck horror fare, nothing remarkable, not terrible, not great.",1535414400,,232,5.823529411764706
8730743,5,B014HDTT84,"This film is absolutely fantastic. The four primary characters are somewhat trope' on the surface. That being said, the script and pacing allows these characters to fully flesh themselves out and the range of their humanity, personality type, etc. runs across the societal spectrum. All of these men have their strengths and faults, like the rest of us, and their decisions and actions along the way are believable and justifiable - even when they appear to be brutal. It's rare that films, especially in this day & age, avoid the trap of having binary-stereotypical characters, but Bone Tomahawk avoids that common pratfall. This movie is intelligent and contains important undertones regarding morality & tribalism throughout. I should also mention that the questions of 'morality' are not done in the typically heavy handed or politically ponderous manner. So refreshing.

This film is as much a character study as it is 'horror' and it's all done under the unrelenting back drop of an excellent 'Western' classic. The story arc for each character is compelling and at times heartbreaking and as others have mentioned,whilst the gore is most certainly horrific and visceral, it does NOT seem gratuitous as it's all presented in a very matter of fact, though completely chilling manner.

This is a ""MUST SEE"" for any fan of westerns, layered character studies, new takes on old genre's or simply want to watch an unforgettable film.  5 STARS.",1534982400,,1444,5.110169491525424

8730745,5,B014HDTT84,"I'm really glad I saw this mentioned on YouTube and had to take a look when I saw Kurt Russell's name in the credits on IMDb. Very fortunate that it's on Prime. Russell has a certain swagger about him that suits the western genre to a T. He owns every scene he is ever in much like McCready in The Thing. It has a very basic and well-trodden plot of breaking taboos, being punished for the intrusion, and the chase for revenge, which is a fine plot for any western, particularly with spooky overtones. The heroes form quite a cabal of misfit anti-heroes and paladins, just like any tabletop roleplaying game. If you get a chance and have a few hours to spare, most definitely check out this diamond in the rough.",1534550400,,712,4.401515151515151

8730747,1,B014HDTT84,"I used to enjoy films like this but as I  grow older I see that our society is deliberately being desensitized to insane, violent crap. Each generation now becomes less and less human and humane and more and more nonchalant about depravity, murder and death. That being said, this film was less about human survival and nobility and more about how much more depraved  can we make hollywood garbage? There is a tribe running the world and it isn't made up of the ""indians"" in this film. They are nonetheless just as much a bunch of sick, twisted, parasitic, cannibalistic monsters. We dare not name them for fear of being censored. Just look to the banks, the fascist state and hollywood for them. They made this piece of dung.",1534377600,,726,4.62015503875969
