2876889,2,B000RZGHR8,"I was not expecting much when I sat down to watch this movie, and that is exactly what I got...not much. I do not want to say anything to spoil the movie in case you have not watched it yet. I will say that it was hard to follow until the end when it all comes together. Unfortunately, by that time, it was too late. The whole time you are watching this movie, you are scratching your head just trying to figure it out and when you do figure it out, it just leaves you with an unsatisfied feeling. Who knows, you might enjoy it. As for me, it just didn't cut it.",1192233600,2,562,3.982300884955752
8203220,1,B000RZGHR8,This was horrible.  I placed an order for the movie After produced by Ryan Smith and got this. We watched it and even mynhusband who likes science fiction couldn't get a grip on this one.,1390608000,,187,4.3428571428571425
8203221,1,B000RZGHR8,"There hasn't been a review on this movie in almost a year.  Again, don't buy it!  It is nauseating, confusing, and just a plain boring movie.  What woman would go jumping off a building pregnant?  Who wrote this scene in the movie, a sadistic nut.  I am not going to rewrite what other viewers have stated before.

Two words to sum it all up, BURN IT and scatter the ashes.",1364256000,,373,4.257142857142857
8203222,1,B000RZGHR8,"After stinks.  It tries *so* hard to win over viewers by simply focusing on fast-paced... events, and upbeat techno music to make it *seem* more exciting.  It's rare when this happens, but I was SO confused with the storyline that I'm convinced there weren't even any writers involved in the making of this movie.  You see it's about a few young people that seek thrilling situations in subway stations and on rooftops, but what do they actually *do*?  Nothing at all but run and jump around avoiding supposed danger!  Eventually it gets REALLY strange when these young people start disappearing before our very eyes.  That's right- one moment they're there, the next you see them flashing, and then they disappear.  WHAT THE HECK!?!?!?!  In one scene a man gets shot and then vanishes.

That's all there is to this movie.  Running around, fast-paced techno songs to make the events seem important and interesting, the occasional running away from the ""bad guys"" (whoever they were- they looked like security guards) and that's it.  What IS this movie?",1333238400,,1052,4.920454545454546
8203223,1,B000RZGHR8,"My mom is visiting and I thought I was being nice and gave her the remote. She likes quirky movies and kept waiting for this movie to make sense. At a certain point I could tell that it never would. She became stubborn and watched it until the end.

The crap camera work and all the green lighting came me a headache. At least my mom handed me back the remote...",1322438400,,362,4.098591549295775
8203224,2,B000RZGHR8,"For the individual who has exhausted their selection of sci-fi from their in-home resources, but who still needs a sci-fi fix, this title does a serviceable job of exploring a well-trod trope. While watching it I assessed it as 'Jacob's Ladder in Moscow'. Not quite Jacob's Ladder, of course. But watch it to compare with other hereafter texts. (Check out Jim Henson's short film ""The Cube""; also read William Golding's ""Pincher Martin"".) Visually annoying documentary camerawork, tropish horror camerawork, a few over-saturated 'hazy recollection' scenes. One or two decent chills. The somewhat questionable choice of rupture in the de-rezzing effect of bodies is  thematically in keeping with the main character's inability to live without a video camera in hand. His friends literally die into interlaced lines of video (echoes of TRON, possibly). (While I'm at it, Videodrome and Brain Scan work on the trope of life imitating digital art / motion picture.) There are far more stultifyingly insulting movies out there.",1256515200,3,1022,5.3478260869565215
8203225,2,B000RZGHR8,"I wanted to see this movie because the subject of urban exploration fascinates me. I didn't read the reviews. BAD mistake. This movie has two major flaws. One, the godawful camera work, and two, its predictability. I realized what was going on 30 minutes into it. I believe I speak for the majority when I say the shaky handheld camera ""effect"" has been played to death. It's no longer original or effective. It's annoying and nauseating and belongs only in death metal music videos. Apart from that, there are some major continuity issues and total lack of coherence that will drive you up the wall if you dare seriously think about it. All in all, this movie seemed like a desperate attempt to somehow fill 90 minutes of screen time. Don't repeat my mistake, save yourself some time and money and skip this one.",1220832000,5,813,4.652777777777778
8203226,1,B000RZGHR8,"As someone else wrote the Blair witch camera work is very annoying. Even worse, when the camera is not shaky and trailing they use another gimic and the shots are over solarised and washed out to the point of invisible.

Plot and premise were interesting enough. Location innovative. No matter these virtues were completely overridden by the stupid production gimicks.

I found it practically unwatchable. I can't remember when a movie last annoyed me quite this much.

If I could bother to remember the director and cameraman's names I would be sure to boycott them forever going forward.

Flora Montgomery should shoot her agent. How does she wind up in these roles. Furthermore if you're a fan of hers. She has little more than a bit part and then she is rendered almost invisible.",1208390400,3,784,4.8283582089552235
8203227,4,B000RZGHR8,"After seeing what the hollywood treatment did for hacker culture, I reluctantly gave this film a shot. One word, INTENSE. This movie delivers some outstanding glimpses of what urban exploration is all about without over-glamorizing it. I had no real expectations and that said, this film took me places, many of them far darker than lost catacombs and crawspaces. Urban exploration provided the ideal backdrop for a psychological thriller. If you are expecting a dumbed-down gollywood version of this ""underground"" subculture, you will be detoured to innnerspace. This is not a cineplex popcorn movie, this is what independent films are all about. The POV of this film is an experimental form of non-linear storytelling where your own interpretations augment the experience. I like a film that takes these risks. At the very minimum this film takes you places that you might never want to go while looking for something else. I think the previous reviewer might have been looking for a T&A snipehunt (we have enough of those!) but if you want escapism that does not insult your intelligence then I would highly recommend this.",1199491200,6,1126,5.091891891891892
