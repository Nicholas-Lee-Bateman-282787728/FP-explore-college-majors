2060403,5,B00023P4JM,"This DVD is a true bargain compiling 4 of Don Knotts' most popular films onto one nicely priced disc!  This DVD collects 4 of the 5 films that Knotts made in the 60s where he had the lead role (the exception being 1964's ""The Incredible Mr. Limpet"").  The DVD is a flip disc with two films on each side.  Side A has ""The Ghost & Mr. Chicken"" and ""The Reluctant Astronaut"", while side B has ""The Shakiest Gun in the West"" and ""The Love God?"".  Another great aspect is that these films are in chronological order of original release from 1966-1969.  In other words, these 4 films were released back to back.  For those that are fans of Knotts' films or the live action Disney films of the 60s & 70s, these will be a rare treat to own.  Great fun, exceptable for the entire family (with the possible exception of ""The Love God?"" which contains some mild adult humor, obviously tame by today's standard, but still maybe inappropriate for some ages).  Knotts plays almost the same character in every film and just as the title of the set implies, he is at first reluctant, then the hero.  For those unfamiliar with the films, here are some very brief plots:

Side A

The Ghost & Mr. Chicken (1966) - Knotts is Luther Heggs, a local wanna be reporter who stays a night in the local haunted house on a dare.  After Arthur witnesses some spooky happenings, no one believes him, including his boss George Beckett (Dick Sargent).  It's up to Arthur to prove to the town that the old house has a ghost.  Considered to be one of Knott's most successful films.

The Reluctant Astronaut (1967) - Knotts stars as Roy Fleming, employee at the local carnival where he dresses up as an astronaut.  After his Dad sends his application to NASA, Roy is actually contacted, but to be a janitor!  Luckily Major Fred Gifford (Leslie Nielsen with dark hair!) gives him a big chance to take a test flight into space.  Classic stuff.

Side B

The Shakiest Gun in the West (1968) - from the same director as Mr. Chicken, Knotts plays Dr. Jesse W. Heywood, a nervous dentist who you'd think would be the last guy to get involved with gun selling bad guys. Along the way he meets a beautiful sharpshooting outlaw, Penelope 'Bad Penny' Cushings (Barbara Rhodes).  You might call this film a precursor to the Apple Dumpling Gang films where Knotts starred alongside Tim Conway.

The Love God? (1969) - definitely the most unique in the bunch because of it's subject matter.  Knotts plays Abner Audubon Peacock, owner of Peacock Magazine for bird watchers.  Abner himself is a bird watcher and is on the verge of losing his magazine when a second party offers to help him keep publishing it.  While Abner is away collecting photos for his return issue, he arrives home to find his magazine is being used to publish pornography!  For me this was the most enjoyable only because I had never seen it and watching Knotts within the context of the subject was hilarious.  Again the humor is mostly for young adults and older here, the film was actually rerated PG-13 while all three other films are NR or G ratings.

I highly recommend the set to fans of the genre or style.  For Don Knotts fans it's a no brainer.  4 great films on one low priced DVD.  I can tell you all four films look and sound great.  Also recommended with Don Knotts:

The Incredible Mr. Limpet (1964)

The Apple Dumpling Gang (1975)

Gus (1976)

The Apple Dumpling Gang Rides Again (1979)

Private Eyes (1981) - My personal favorite!",1098316800,103,3469,4.537096774193548
2060404,5,B00023P4JM,"In my opinion Don Knotts is a comedy legend and his brand of hilarity has always been highly underrated. The reluctant hero pack is a steal at Amazon's price and any fan would be happy to own this incredible set. Personally I wouldn't have included ""The Love God"" in the mix. ""How to Frame a Figg"" or ""The Incredible Mr. Limpet"" would have been better suited for this release. As for the movies themselves, the picture is clear and the sound is crisp. I don't care for the packaging and prefer a single movie per disc for better compression. You can buy the reluctant hero pack at a fraction of what you would spend for the individual movies and for some fans on a budget this is the way to go. Everybody's taste is different when it comes to movie buying. I have some of the same titles on single discs and there is a noticeable difference in compression and quality. I am really disappointed that Universal has re-released these movies again and not bothered to include any commentary or interviews with Don Knotts while he is still living. A few words from this comic legend would have been a nice touch from the studio. Overall these four movies are pure fun for the whole family and hopefully they will inspire a new legion of Don knotts fans.

2060405,5,B00023P4JM,"We have all enjoyed Don Knotts and his comedy over the years, whether it be as Barney Fife on The Andy Griffith Show, or his feature films.  Universal provides a wonderful way to get most of his movies he made for Universal at a great price, The Reluctant Hero Pack.
Four movies are included in this set.  The first is The Ghost and Mr. Chicken, where Knotts plays a bumbly typesetter who takes on a bet to spend the night in the town haunted house. Second is The Reluctant Astronaut where he plays a thirty-something man who still lives at home with his father who has great hopes for him as an astronaut.  Knotts gets hired with NASA, but not as an astronaut! Third is The Shakiest Gun in the West where Knotts plays a dentist who wants to take his modern dentistry practice from the East to the West.  When he arrives in the West, he meets a beautiful woman who dupes him into marrying her. Finally there is The Love God where Knotts plays a magazine owner of a bird-watch magazine who hires partners to save it financially but secretly want to turn it into a ""gentlemen's"" magazine. All of Knott's films are hilarious and worth owning for that moment when you want to have a good laugh.  Especially since you never see any of these films on tv!
All four movies are in anamorphic widescreen and presented in outstanding color, however there are no extras other than the trailers.  When I purchased this set, I expected to have four dvd's in their own keep cases, but that is not how this is set up.  This set is one box that slides into another cardboard case.  There is only one disc with two movies on one side and two movies on the other, which accounts for much of the discount.  The bad thing about double-sided discs are that you are constantly making sure no dust or prints appear on the side that is exposed (side-up) in the case when the disc is handled.  The good thing about double-sided discs in this case, is that it takes up less room on your shelf and saves you time of changing discs one at a time. I should also mention that Knotts made a fifth and final film for Universal, entitled How to Frame a Figg.  It is available for purchase on dvd, but is not included in this set.
With all of this considered, I am pleased to have all four movies in widescreen and dvd crystal clear at a great price, and I think you will be too. Now we can put our vhs copies away and enjoy 21st Century technology!",1089072000,3,2414,4.31858407079646
2060406,5,B00023P4JM,"If you're willing to give up nicer packaging and picture discs on these four titles this ""Franchise Collection"" is an excellent choice. Two discs contain the four Don Knotts movies listed above on ""flipper"" style discs.
Note though that although owned by Universal like the films in this collection it does not include the excellent ""How To Frame a Figg"" which will have to be purchused seperate in order to complete your Universal Don Knotts Collection as well as Warner Brothers excellent ""The Incredible Mr. Limpet"" release which is packed with some of the best and most kitschy special features I've ever seen on a disc.",1089072000,3,624,4.89622641509434

2060418,5,B00023P4JM,"Four great films from the greatest neurotic milquetoast ever, Mr. Don Knotts (1924-2006)!
This is a two disc single side set, two features per disc in a standard size case.
Video and audio quality are excellent for DVD standards.

These films are presented in chronological order-

The Ghost And Mr. Chicken  1966

The Reluctant Astronaut  1967

The Shakiest Gun In The West  1967

The Love God?  1970

Each film is progressively more mature and sophisticated.
The first three are basically silly but Knotts' apt characterizations have sincere moments.
The final film in this collection, The Love God? is an excellent vehicle for Don and may be his finest cinematic effort.
Very sophisticated and well written, an absolute comedy masterpiece! Multi level functionality and a PG-13 rating!
Every element of this film is well done, direction, casting, acting, design...excellent production overall.
The Love God? reminds me of Don Knotts' work as Barney Fife for The Andy Griffith Show, what I consider to be the moral compass of America, and Mr. Knotts of course lives up to that here in all these sweet films.
His work reminds me we all have an inherent moral responsibility to conduct ourselves in a civilized manner and in all things be honest and truthful.

I miss Don, I miss these values.

I also admire Mr. Knotts very much for surviving a traumatic childhood and his distinguished military service, he is a Role Model and a great American.

I had never seen The Love God before and I was suprised how good it is, especially the cortroom speech by the attorney general (""The marquis de sade would have regarded abner peacock as a peer in his search for leechery."") I have watched The Love God several times since purchasing this collection and despite it's shortcomings, you still have to laugh at Summer in the Meadow by Eloise Dudley Fetlock or J. Charles Twilight and Mrs. Love.
The Shakiest Gun in the West is the weakest of the four movies, but still it's enjoyable to watch. This collection is a great bargain: four great comedies for under $10. Only one of the films is probably not suitable for kids (The Love God).",1477180800,,810,4.472972972972973

My two favorite movies are The Ghost and Mr. Chicken & The Shakiest Gun in the West. I laughed so hard at these movies.

The Ghost one reminds me of the episode in Andy Griffith where they go into the haunted house too. I loved the set up of the ghost house and Don makes the best scary/funny scenes ever :-)

In The Shakiest Gun he's a dentist, a gunslinger and a Native American woman. You just have to watch because it's so good.

The Reluctant Astronaunt is funny too. Don is a janitor but his family and hometown thinks he's an astronaut and this leads to all kinds of trouble!

The Love God is sort of weird because Don is set up to be some Hugh Heffner type guy. He just wants to write for his bird magazine but these people want him as a star for a dirty magazine. They don't show any bad things but there are a lot of innuendoes.

The first disc has The Ghost and Mr. Chicken and The Reluctant Astronaut on it and you just pick which one to watch from the main menu. Both movies are on one side. The other two movies are on the other disc.

I recommend to anyone that loves comedy and Don Knott's. Oh and we also get to see several people from The Andy Griffith Show in the movies which was awesome.",1463011200,13,1303,4.06640625

2060561,3,B00023P4JM,This packet is a great collection of the one in a million comedic acting genius of the one and only Don Knotts. The Ghost and Mr. Chicken is by far the BEST of his films. The Shakiest Gun in the West being a close second. The Reluctant Astronaut has some comedic genius as well and they could have completed this pack with How to Frame a Figg instead of The Love God. The Love God was poorly written and was the achilles heel for Don's venture into making films.,1378944000,3,462,4.202247191011236

2060572,4,B00023P4JM,"I absolutely love The Andy Griffith Show (only the seasons with Don Knotts).  If you are expecting that type of humor, you will be a little disappointed, at least I was.  Having said that, all the movies are fun to watch and good for a few laughs.  The one I enjoyed the least was The Love God?  I could not watch it with my 7 year old daughter, although it's pretty tame compared to what you can watch on daytime tv these days.  If you are a Don Knotts fan you will definitely enjoy this 4 pack.  He is better in the Apple Dumpling Gang without a doubt.  I enjoyed the other 3 movies about the same.  Probably have to pick The reluctant Astronaut just slighty over The Ghost and Mr. Chicken.  Well worth the Money I paid!!!!",1368835200,,725,4.195652173913044

2060576,4,B00023P4JM,"Don Knotts provided the best of the humor on the Andy Griffith show as Barney Fife . In these movies you get a taste of that same quirky humor and I for one enjoy it.
4 fun movies featuring Don Knotts. The writing is clever and performances deliver a classic fun ride with the loveable characters Don Knotts creates with his persona.
Others can detail the specifics on these movies. But I am just going to say Don Knotts is a BIG thumbs up .I watched them all and enjoyed them all.",1363478400,2,481,4.239130434782608

I bought them for my 11 year old son for Christmas and everyone in the family has watched them at one time or another along with most of his friends. It is fun to turn the kids on to good entertainment that doesn't include a bunch of swearing, killing, drug dealing, child molesting, women beating and general poor behavior by adults. They love the silliness of the films and the story lines. The best thing was....somehow I thought I was getting three movies when it turns out that there are actually four.
Hours of fun and entertainment. Now my 17 year old stepdaughter wants to take them to one of the girls houses for movie night.

2060585,5,B00023P4JM,"Great family movies by a comedic genius. The only one parents might have to watch before the kids do is ""The Love God"". It is mild by todays standards but a bit more adult.

My favorite is ""The Ghost and Mr. Chicken"". I hope to make watching it a Halloween family tradition.

Great transfers, the colors pop off the screen.

This is a must for Don Knotts fans, and the price is more than reasonable for 4 films.",1354492800,,411,4.243589743589744

The ground was wet and soft and the mudd (Or Don Knotts) grabbed hold of my shoe and tried to bring me to ""the other side"".  After that experience, Don Knotts frightens me.  However, I have watched 3 of these movies with my kids and they are great, just what I expected from Don Knotts films.  I didn't watch ""The Love God"" yet because other reviewers said it is not approprate for kids. I gave it 4 of 5 because I agree ""The Love God"" shouldn't be included in this set.

2060598,5,B00023P4JM,"""The Andy Griffith Show"" seemed to be a great springboard for Don Knotts. After becoming famous as TV's self-important but bungling Deputy Barney Fife for five seasons, Knotts was ready to move on. His picture deal with Universal paved the way for five great comedies, the first four being showcased in this collection.
I watched ""The Ghost and Mr. Chicken"" many times as a kid & loved it. A scare comedy seemed to be a no-brainer to showcase Knotts' sharp comic timing, physical comedy & nervous twitters. Setting the mold for small town life, Knotts is Luther Heggs, an underdog typesetter at the town newspaper who aspires to be a big-shot reporter. When the 20th Anniversary of an infamous murder at the local haunted mansion arises, Knotts is chosen to spend the night alone in the creepy Simmons house as a publicity stunt. Naturally, supernatural occurances all conspire to scare the wits out of poor Luther, and he's made a local hero. But when he tries to prove the spooky goings-on, no one believes him. By today's horror standards, TGAMC is pretty harmless stuff (although that organ music still gives me the creeps). Aside from some obvious stunt work (particularly in the coal-chute scene), Knotts is in top form here, and it's so much fun to watch him jump bug-eyed at every little thing.
Many fans love ""The Reluctant Astronaut"", and it's easy to see why. It's an extremely pleasant & amusing Knotts vehicle, once again playing a character with heroic aspirations but has to prove himself. Knotts is Roy Fleming, a kiddie amusement park ""astronaut"" who's summoned to the real thing after his father submits an application. Of course, it all falls flat after Roy discovers he's only part of sanitation. What follows is Roy ""living a lie"" to impress family & townfolk. That is, until he befriends another astronaut (Leslie Nielsen, before ""Airplane"" turned him into a comic actor forever after) & gets a real shot at a test flight.
The appropriately-titled ""The Shakiest Gun in the West"" is really a remake of a Bob Hope comedy (""The Paleface"")about the ""tenderfoot"" dentist travelling out West, getting conned, getting a ""quickie marriage"" (to Barbara Rhodes, an outlaw complying with the Government to investigate arms dealing with Indians in exchange for a full pardon), becoming a gun-slinging hero, and so on. There's some great comic moments here, particularly with Knotts fighting to get a stubborn patient's mouth open for an exam, him hamming it up as a gunslinger, and disguising himself as an Indian maiden.
""The Love God?"" is the most curious one of the bunch, a real departure from Knotts' usual family-friendly fare. He seemed to want to try something more ""adult"" in humor; even a post-PG-13 rating has been assigned, although there's not one obscene word uttered, just some racy images & provocative dialogue. Timing might have been another reason for Knotts, since it was the late 60's, a sexual revolution was on the rise & pornography was beginning to flood movie theatres. Knotts again plays the little guy, Abner Peacock, an innocent bird magazine photographer whose life gets turned upside down when he's manipulated by gangsters, crooked cons & aggressive editors (in this case, a stunning Anne Francis) and becomes a Hugh Hefner-like publishing symbol overnight. The birdsong tribute is a hoot, especially the second time around as a fear-petrified Knotts can do nothing but a hoarse raspberry!
All four movies are digitally remastered with care, looking as crisp & colorful as when they were first released. The packaging is also wonderful to look at, a true homage to Knotts. But of course, it's the movies themselves that are the real pleasure, and each & every one shows Knotts at his peak!",1283731200,,3731,4.9712

2060605,5,B00023P4JM,"For a low price, you get four classic Don Knotts films on one double sided DVD.  This compilation was issued shortly after his death, and it is an excellent introduction to his feature film work.  Included are The Ghost and Mr. Chicken, The Reluctant Astronaut, The Shakiest Gun In The West and The Love God, in chronological order the four films that followed The Incredible Mr. Limpet.  Composer Vic Mizzy provided wonderfully appropriate music for many of Knott's films, including the four in this collection.

Knotts became a fixture in many homes while playing Deputy Barney Fife on the Andy Griffith Show.  According to Griffith, he had told Knotts that his TV program would only run for five years, so Knotts made plans to launch a film career after completing year five on Griffith.  While many may have wished that he continued being Barney Fife forever, it was on the big screen that Knotts was able to showcase his creative comic genius to the fullest extent.  In these films, Knotts does pretty well fit the `reluctant hero' characterization.

The Ghost and Mr. Chicken is an all time classic Knotts' film.  Knotts is Luther Heggs, a newspaper typesetter who dreams of being a reporter.  Spending the night in a haunted mansion where a murder occurred years before, Luther bumbles, babbles, and stutters along, uncovering the solution to a long hidden murder mystery.  A hilarious romp with a slew of memorable lines, such as `Atta boy Luther', `Let me clarify that', and `It played'.  Joan Staley is sweet and engaging, as Knott's love interest in this true comedy gem.

Back in the 60's, the space race with the Soviet Union was raging hot and heavy.  In The Reluctant Astronaut, Knotts is Roy Fleming, the operator of an amusement park space ride, who despite an aversion to flying, still dreams of being an astronaut.  When he receives a letter from NASA, everyone believes that Roy has been accepted into the astronaut training program.  NASA makes him a janitor, but somehow Roy still manages to get into space.  Leslie Nielsen plays the classic straight man, as an astronaut in training who befriends Roy.  Very dated special effects and a little too goofy at times, but still a very warm and enjoyable outing.

In The Shakiest Gun in the West, Knotts is a Jesse Heywood, a Philadelphia dentist on his way out West.  `Bad Penny' Cushings (Barbara Rhodes), is an outlaw who agrees to help the US Government track down arms shipments to the Indians, in return for a pardon.  Cushings marries Heywood just so she can join a westward bound wagon train.  With Penny's gun doing the actual damage, Heywood emerges as a gun slinging hero after an encounter with the Indians.  The writing could be better, and a spark seems to be lacking between Knotts and Rhodes, a tall athletic redhead.  Matters probably cross the line of today's political correctness, which may bother some.

Don Knotts boldly takes on the sex comedy in The Love God?  Abner Peacock (Knotts) is the publisher of magazine devoted to bird watching, that unfortunately is about to go belly up.  Osborn Tremain (Edmund O'Brien) an unscrupulous publisher of porn, takes over `The Peacock' magazine and converts it to a radically different kind of `bird watching'.  Soon Abner is swept up in legal proceedings, and drawn into the intoxicating world of smut, becoming the new symbol for the American playboy, working along side beautiful publisher Lisa LaMonica (Anne Francis).

Don Knotts was a unique comic genius, whose talent truly bloomed in feature films.  There's not much need to `clarify' that.  This is a great collection, a great value, and a great way to become acquainted with his quirky style.",1244332800,,3683,4.882447665056361

The picture and sound quality are absolutely superb so you won't miss out on a second of every nervous, twitchy and downright funny move and expression. Don pulls out all the stops in every movie and in every scene.

One of the funniest scenes is in the Reluctant Astronaut when his charaacter gets drunk in the bar and is hitting on a lady of rather questionable morals. I about fell off the couch ;-)

As a kid we all laughed until our sides hurt watching all of these movies. Now I still do, but I also catch a lot of things that were over our heads as youngsters... yet there is still nothing to offend even grandma in any of these four delightful films.

Get out the popcorn and put up your feet for several nights of wholesome, enjoyable and truly funny entertainment....and you can't beat the price.",1229126400,,1048,4.588235294117647

Though there are common elements in all four movies, they each have a good deal of clean humor and lots of Don Knotts silliness.

I did and I'm glad to report that after watching one movie on each side, there was absolute sharpness and top quality of sound and video on this DVD. The packaging was better than any DVD I've ever owned. It's very creative and would take to long to describe. I was really taken aback with the use of old school actors that I hadn't noticed when it first aired. Otis, the drunk, plays a drunk in the Ghost and Mr. Chicken, along with the grouchy grocery store owner from Mayberry and some of the smaller characters from the same. Dick Sargent from Bewitched played with the noisey neighbor Mrs. Cravetts in this film. Shakiest Gun in the West had several old actors. One in particular was Cookie from Wagon Train. Keep looking at these bit actors and you'll see a gamit of actors from many T.V. series. To me it showed the amount of respect these actors had towards Don Knotts. This is a real treasure and an unequaled value. A MUST for any movie, TV trivia buff. Freeze frame and try to figure out which actors played in what previously. Buy this DVD and turn your family on to some good non-stressful, non too violent entertainment.",1147478400,4,1231,4.5

I found this rather frustrating, as the movies themselves were quite enjoyable otherwise.

I must say though, that The Ghost and Mr. Chicken is one of my all time favorite movies.  Don is hysterical as the bumbling reporter wanna-be Luther who tries to get his big break by spending the night in a local haunted house.

While I loved these movies as a kids, I was afraid they wouldn't keep the attention of my children today, who have the ""luxury"" of video games, cable TV, and the Internet.  However, my 12 and 10 year old both enjoyed the movies. In fact, after ""Mr. Chicken"" they requested to watch ""The Reluctant Astronaut.""  Sure, the movies are a little slower than they are these days, but only because these movies actually take time to develop the plot and characters.

Apparently, someone has been listening to those who have complained about the poor quality because the quality of the DVD I received is perfect!  I was very pleasantly surprised.

If you're considering purchasing this set, do so. It's a nice way to spend an evening with your family (although I haven't watched ""The Love God"" yet and don't recall seeing it as a kid).

Enjoy",1142726400,,1098,4.566326530612245

2060690,1,B00023P4JM,"This review only pertains to the DVD itself, and not the titles on it (which are great.)  My DVD was plagued with freeze ups, skips, and sound problems.  From what I have seen in reviews of other Universal DVDs, this is a common problem for Universal DVDs.  The titles on this box set are great, I only wish Universal was not so cheap, and put out a 4-DVD set instead of trying to compress all 4 movies on one DVD.  If so much had not been crammed onto one disk, then perhaps these glitches would not exsist.",1137715200,28,508,4.206185567010309

2060694,4,B00023P4JM,"I had forgotten just how good these old Don Knotts movies are.  When I was young, they would air these type of movies on Sunday afternoons instead of all of the sports we have nowadays.  These movies are right in line with the Ma & Pa Kettle films as far as good, old fashioned, humorous family movies.

I purchased this 4-pack specifically to see The Reluctant Astronaut, after visiting the Johnson Space Center.  The movie shows the JSC when it was very new, as you can tell by the small, newly planted trees which now are very large oaks.

Although Knotts isn't his famous 'Barney' character in these movies, he never strays far from it with his familiar expressions and mannerisms.  These movies have several of the other character actors from the Andy Griffith Show, Mayberry and Gomer Pyle.

It takes me back to my childhood in the late 60's/early 70's to see these movies and their rather simple production methods.  It makes for good family time too.

You can't go wrong, purchasing this for yourself or as a gift.",1125878400,6,1022,4.633333333333334
2060695,3,B00023P4JM,"First off I am a life time Don Knotts fan. But I believe they should have nipped this collection in the bud before they released it. That's right, (Do your best Barney voice) NIPPED IT IN THE BUD! I saw the Ghost and Mr. Chicken when I was 5 years old at the summer movies and I still love it to this day. I still hear a ""Atta Boy Luther!"" at speeches once in a while and it still makes me laugh. This one is a true classic and one of my all time favorites. The Reluctant Astronaut and The Shakiest Gun in the West are great movies as well but the Love God is where you lose me here. There weren't any of those classic moments that you see in the other movies and in a couple places women get hit and it kind of made me cringe. I'm glad they made it PG-13. I'm in no way a prude and the plot of the movie is cute but INMO it's just not a very good movie. Even if you're C of C, I don't think you will want your kids to see this one. I'm glad I didn't let my 10 year old daughter see this one. She loves Don and I would hate to see that change. Buy these movies separately. They will be better quality and you won't be stuck with the Love God.",1124755200,12,1142,3.802521008403361
2060696,5,B00023P4JM,"Don Knotts is a national treasure, one of the most naturally gifted comic actors the world has ever seen.  As big a Don Knotts fan as I have always been, and as many times as I have seen all of the old episodes of The Andy Griffith Show, I had actually never seen any of Knotts' classic comedies from the late 1960s.  This Reluctant Hero Pack has helped alleviate this problem.  Sure, I could have spent four times as much money and acquired each of these four films on individual DVDs, but frugality is one of the many small-town American virtues Don Knotts' characters usually embodied.  These films have been compressed so that they will all fit on one double-sided DVD, but there is nothing wrong with the picture quality of this disk whatsoever.  It's not like you're missing out on any special features on the individual offerings, either; unfortunately, there are also next to no special features on this Reluctant Hero pack - all you get are three of the four films' trailers.  Still, what matters are the films themselves, and you're guaranteed to have over six and a half hours of unadulterated laughter with these four Don Knotts classics.

The four films included here are not necessarily Don Knotts' best four movies, but each of them is hilarious.  The Ghost and Mr. Chicken puts Don Knotts inside a haunted house overnight.  Remember how funny that haunted house episode of The Andy Griffith Show was?  Well, this film is even funnier.  It also features the lovely Joan Staley as the object of affection of Knotts' character.  His character, by the way, is a truly reluctant hero, one whose heroics and honesty are put to an extreme test.  Then you have The Reluctant Astronaut, which I consider to be the funniest of the four films included here.  Knotts plays a grown man who goes off - very reluctantly - to become an astronaut - despite the fact that he is terrified of heights.  Once he gets to Houston, he finds out his job is actually that of a janitor rather than a spaceman, and he is forced to live a lie because he is afraid to admit the truth to his proud father.  Just when everything falls apart for him, though, he gets the chance to put everything right - if he can muster up the courage to answer the heroic call.

The Shakiest Gun in the West pits Knotts in the role of a newly graduated dentist who goes West to spread oral hygiene along the frontier.  Along the way, he finds himself suddenly married to a mysterious redhead with all sorts of secrets.  Despite his obvious weaknesses in the gun-fighting department (they call this film The Shakiest Gun in the West for a reason), he finds himself celebrated as a fierce Indian-killer and hero of the West.  At the time, he doesn't realize how undeserving he is of the respect he garners, but he does get the chance to prove himself a true hero in the end.

The last of the four films included here, The Love God, is unlike any other Don Knotts film.  This was a film way ahead of its time, as it addresses issues of sexual behavior and censorship head-on in an hysterically satirical manner.  Knotts plays a timid publisher of a bird magazine who somehow ends up becoming famous as the country's premier playboy and smut peddler, the very standard bearer of the forces of the sexual revolution.  This film has garnered a retroactive PG-13 rating, so it is not quite the true family film that the three other movies are, but there is nothing here that the most sheltered five-year-old hasn't already seen and heard in this day and age.

Why am I even trying to give a quick description of these films?  This is, after all, Don Knotts we're talking about, so you know good and well these movies are basically guaranteed to be hilarious.  Don't deny yourself - especially at this price - of the enjoyment of four classic films from one of America's funniest and most beloved comic actors.",1102032000,215,3870,4.571014492753624
