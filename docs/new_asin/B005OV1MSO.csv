8482063,5,B005OV1MSO,"Whereas the Threepenny Opera is set in an imaginary London without landmarks, Mahagonny is set in an imaginary town on the US east coast. Both reflect events in Germany at the time they were written. Mahagonny has a wonderfully melodic score that shows the influence of many popular genres of the period such as jazz and cabaret music, yet it is a very bleak complex, very dramatic work, at times intensely moving. Brecht's text is heavily ideological and full of unrelenting sardonic humour. There is so much to it that any fairly good production will have a considerable amount of interest to it. Whereas the LA production conducted by James Conlon treats the work as if it were an American musical, successfully, this production treats the work as grand opera, also successfully. The large Salzburg stage allows for wide screen treatment. The large cast make imaginative use of it but sometimes the sheer size of the stage is problematic. The singing is excellent. Gwynneth Jones sings like the fine opera singer she is. Jerry Hadley is very good. The best production by far that I have watched in English is the one from the Met conducted by James Levine at B0064SHXE8. It is really worth finding. The best production in German is likely to be as fine as that by the Komische Oper, Berlin of 1977, conducted by Robert Hannell with Maria Zahlten-Hall as Widow Bedbick, Elliott Palay as Jimmy (Paul Ackermann) and Tamara Lund as Jenny Hill. But this Salzberg has much to offer.",1430092800,4,1479,4.803921568627451
