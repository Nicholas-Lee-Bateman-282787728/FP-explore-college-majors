For those who only prefer NOT to watch such movies, this may change you mind.

Yes, sub-titles do detract from the enjoyment of watching, but this is one that is very much worth watching. Or you could just learn German(Polish?).

Review

The plot is simple; An officially, and self, declared idiot (medical terminology of the times) gets caught up in the events of the start of WW 1. The movie is a comedy about  the adventures of Schweik and not the war. The acting is great, the characters likeable, and the humor is.... Well. Different.

As you watch this movie you'll find yourself wondering; IS Schweik really a simpleton? Of course he is! He must be! But then, how come he has more ""smarts"" that those around him?

Kinda makes you think of Forrest Gump. But of the 2 I'll take Schweik every time.

The best way to decide if you'll like it is to watch it (in many short episodes) on YouTube. You might even be able to watch the entire movie there. But if you do, you'll end up wanting the DVD anyway.

Be aware that the quality of the film is not the greatest. I paid full price ($33) for it and have no complaints.",1352332800,2,1259,4.346153846153846

I have only seen the Czech film, which has the DVD cover shown here. It is not well transferred to DVD, and needs color correction. If you want to see Schweik headed for the front, you need the second film, ""Beg to Report, Sir."" This film offers some chuckles and nice views of Prague, where it all takes place, but the original novel remains a better way to experience Schweik.",1296086400,,462,4.447058823529412
8044591,4,B00074CC14,"""The Good Soldier Schweik"" 1956 (color) film is based on the legendary novel by Czech writer Jaroslav Hasek. The book itself, illustrated by Josefa Lady is a one of a kind treasure, and Schweik has achieved a folk hero status. The film is a comedy-satire about the trials and tribulations of a simple, officially declared to be ""dim-witted"" soldier Schweik during the First World War. Schweik's business as a civilian is selling dogs, some many times over. That part is not fully covered in the film. In the book his business methods makes you roll with laughter.
Schweik's political views and actions are not exactly anti-establishment, although the establishment does not believe him.
After the assassination of Ferdinand in Sarajevo, Schweik openly predicts the declaration of war, for which he is arrested. Subsequently, even though he supports The War, he is placed in a mental institution for people with ailments trying to avoid being sent to the front. There, the treatment for all ailments is daily pumping of the stomach and enemas, until the patient gets cured by volunteering for the front.
At a sermon for the prisoners by a drunk Chaplain, Schweik begins to sob. After the sermon the Chaplain asks him why he was sobbing, to which Schweik replies that he wanted to show to all that the Chaplain had succeeded in reforning a sinner. That changes Schweik's luck and he becomes the Chaplain's orderly. Later the Chaplain loses him in a card game and Schweik becomes the orderly of another officer. As an orderly Schweik always manages to satisfy the wishes of his bosses, many times by hilarious means and with unintended consequences.
The casting and the performances are very good. As a bonus, the action takes place in Prague and the viewer get a mini tour of one of the World's most beautiful, ancient cities.
There are two reasons why I did not give the film 5 stars. The first is that unless you know the Czech language, you will be reading the sub-titles and you will be missing some of the richness and humor of the film. Further, the sub-titles stay on the screen a short time. You have to be a fast reader to read them all without pausing. The second is that the film ends when Schweik is sent to the front. You have to get Schweik 2 DVD to get the full story.",1247011200,7,2281,4.690773067331671
