After renting this first from my local video store, I decided my kids enjoyed it so much that I told him I purchased this on Amazon and he could hardly wait.  Not a day went by that he didn't ask if the mail came yet.  When the DVD arrived all he wanted to do was watch it.

These cartoons are colorful and fun though somewhat corny.  But after watching a few episodes I believe it was the writers intention to be so.  They make fun of their own creations through the dialogue of the main dinosaurs heroes. ""Who writes this stuff?"" Asks one of the dinos when a really silly, ridiculous monster is revealed.

Though very similar to TMNT, the silliness of the situations and dialogue bring the age limit down where I thought it would be OK for my 3 year old son to watch it.

Seeing how excited my son is about it, made me want to be excited for him. Can't wait to watch it again with him.",1332288000,3,947,4.164835164835165

8480980,3,B005OA4Y94,"It's one cringy show with bad animation, story and voice acting. But it's a guilty pleasure for me. Hope to see all 40 episodes this bad show released to enjoy.",1491523200,,160,4.366666666666666
8480981,4,B005OA4Y94,needs more episodes but beyond that it's great.,1449878400,,47,5.0

8480984,5,B005OA4Y94,"My daughter 6 and son 3, love these shows. Fun cartoon entertainment and what kid doesn't like dinosaurs????  Xoxo bye",1388793600,,118,4.9
8480985,5,B005OA4Y94,The only thing that would make this better would of been if it was a series box set rather than just a handful of episodes. Dino Posse tried to ride on the shell trail of the Ninja Turtles but didn't seem to get the fan base of our boys in green. This DVD tells how the Posse got their start filled with funny running gags and Jurassic humor.,1386547200,,342,4.044117647058823
8480986,5,B005OA4Y94,"This used to be on Netflix for streaming free but was removed. My kids LOVE it (don't ask me why) and for such a low price I couldn't pass it up. I bought it with out hesitation so I would stop hearing ""Mom has Netflix got Kung Fu Dino Posse back yet?"".",1365465600,,253,3.8846153846153846
8480987,5,B005OA4Y94,"This is super fun little video. Of course it's more for younger viewers, but I had a lot of fun with it too. These dinos (and the writers) were having some tongue-n-cheek fun and it's really playfully produced. I like the graphic style of the characters and setting as well. Good stuff all around.

Actually there are more episodes than just this...but no others seem to be  available on DVD, which is a real shame because I'd like to check out more of the Posse and those weird, evil (and mostly silly) creatures that they battle. More Posse I say! :)",1356998400,,552,4.455445544554456
8480988,5,B005OA4Y94,"Our son loves this DVD! It has 4 episodes on it: Meet the Posse, Best Dino Friends Forever, Dinos in Space, and Dino Cruise. The running time is about 90 minutes. The characters are fun and silly and he gets a big ""kick"" out of them! (Sorry, I just had to say it!) This is a great DVD!",1345680000,,285,3.9310344827586206
