6564881,5,B00M8JS224,"I heard about the movie from a friend who really loved it so I ordered it for myself.  My boys are big Yankee fans so I had a feeling it would be a hit with them.  To say I was deeply moved would be an understatement.  The movie brought the viewer on a journey back thru time with many of the past and current Yankee greats with the main character who is stricken with cancer.  It was thoroughly enjoyable watching this movie and my kids watched it over and over again. I would highly recommend this movie, you won't be disappointed.",1414454400,,533,4.247524752475248
6564882,5,B00M8JS224,"Henry & Me is a great way to motivate students in Social Studies & ELA skills. As a teacher, I can see how using this movie can be used for introductions in bio-sketches, time-lines and comparing/contrasting reality & fantasy. The storyline is engaging and will capture a wide age-range of kids.  This movie is destined to be a classic.",1413676800,,336,4.694915254237288
6564883,5,B00M8JS224,This is an amazing story about overcoming hard times and picking yourself back up and staying positive! It's a great example of always believing that you can do anything you put your mind to! Cyndi Lauper also stars in this movie as a nurse and she does a beautiful rendition of Time After Time that will bring you to tears. 5 STARS!!! Watch it!!!,1412899200,3,347,4.4375

6564888,5,B00M8JS224,"Not only is the message of hope a much needed sentiment these days, but the film was beautiful to watch. Amazing animation! Great for both kids & adults. I'm buying a few for my nieces & nephews...big Yankee fans. That being said, you don't have to be a sports fan to fall in love with this movie. We all could use a little positive reinforcement in our lives. The fact that a portion of the proceeds go to charity makes it even more important to buy this magical film. I highly recommend it!",1412035200,,492,4.301075268817204

6564894,5,B00M8JS224,What a great family movie!  My son is an avid baseball fan so this was the perfect gift for him.  We all watched it for family movie night and to our surprise even his two older sisters loved it also.  The storyline is very touching and suitable for all ages.  The cast is full of NY Yankee greats and there are a few really funny parts.  We must have replayed the Lefty Gomez scene 8 times that night laughing hysterically each time!  The length is perfect and the overall message inspirational.,1417305600,,496,4.395604395604396

6564896,5,B00M8JS224,"Henry & Me is an outstanding animated film for adults and kids alike. Children will love the story of a sick kid named Jack who goes on a journey with a man named ""Henry"" that ends up with him learning how to throw the curveball in baseball's most iconic stadium--Yankee Stadium. And adults who are fans of America's pass time will appreciate the baseball history when they see the likes of players from Babe Ruth, Mickey Mantle and Lefty Gomez to current players like CC Sabathia and Nick Swisher. And then there is Henry--who turns out to be the Iron Horse himself--Henry Louis Gehrig. The animation is bright and crisp to watch and the characters themselves are beautifully drawn. My personal favorites were Mickey Mantle and Thurman Munson. The great Mickey's son David did a great job on the voice and if you closed your eyes and listened to Paul Simon as Munson, you would swear you were listening to the great catcher himself. Nick Swisher did a great cameo with his delightful voice that just radiates happiness. Add to that Richard Gere as Henry, Chazz Palmintieri as The Babe and the voices of the likes of Danny Aiello, Luis Guzman and members of the current NY Yankees and it was just a delight to watch. Listen for Cyndi Lauper's beautiful rendition of Take Me Out to the Ballgame. She hits a home run as Jack's nurse. This is a movie to watch again and again with your children. The message is one of hope and perseverance. And being the New York Yankees, you know that it is done with class and style. Somewhere in Baseball Heaven, The Boss George Steinbrenner is looking down and smiling. Great for Christmas. You will love it!",1416614400,2,1643,4.610921501706485

8670769,5,B00M8JS224,"If you have been touched directly or indirectly by cancer, this movie is for you.  As an Amazon Prime member, a friend recommended I check it out as it is currently streaming for Amazon Prime subscribers.  First off, where has this movie been and why I am I only hearing about it now?  This should have been front and center at Yankee Stadium (although you don't have to be a Yankees fan to enjoy this film - of course, if you are, you will love it).  I've been to Yankee Stadium a number of times and have never seen any promotion for it.  Very strange.  Check it out.  You will not be disappointed.",1511654400,,600,4.256637168141593
