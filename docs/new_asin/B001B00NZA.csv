8326274,5,B001B00NZA,"If you're new to natural health, then this is a great choice for you to explore what's out there and get comfortable with new approaches to healing. This movie is packed full of great info! It is long and thorough, so break it up or just look at the modalities you are interested in. The natural health experts throughout the movie have great tips too, so take your time.... there is a lot of info here. Looking back, I think I would have split this movie up into mini-movies with follow up interviews... and I still might. But for now, the Future of Medicine is a great step into the world of natural health so you get a feel for what it's actually like in a session and are at ease with a new way to support your body to heal. You also get to hear from over 30 experts, and that's a lot of wisdom! If you want to change the way you think about your health and your life, and you are a newbie to natural health... then start here! Watch a few sections every night, take notes, and make changes slowly. Discover what modalities and/or heatlh tips your are drawn to. Great health is possible. What's a good fit for you may be different than what works for someone else, so I recommend taking notes and then trying out the modalities or tips that resinate with you. Be curious and find out for yourself what your body needs and how to best support your body's ability to heal itself. This is your journey to optimal health... become empowered with what is out there and make your own decisions on what's best for you! May you find the health you are looking for... you deserve it!
Lots of Light to you,
