1917027,5,B0000CABHV,"All I can say is, that this film is one of the best indie films I've seen so far.  Who would have thought that a love story between a couple of kids could be so romantic and heartwarming?  I think that anyone who experienced a first love at such a young age, will find some way to relate.",1186531200,,288,3.9482758620689653
1917028,5,B0000CABHV,"With echoes of BADLANDS and BONNIE AND CLYDE, this film is so immediate that its plotting is a challenge.  The commentary and other extra material help immensely.

The onscreen presence of Brian Vaughan (IV) is astonishing--reminiscent of James Dean and the earliest films of Warren Beatty.

But seven years have passed since FLT was made!  Where is Brian Vaughan's dazzling film career!??!",1179360000,,390,5.241935483870968
1917029,5,B0000CABHV,"I really liked this film. The way ""Boyd"" looked at ""Katie"" was amazing. When she wasn't looking at him, he was looking at her with this look that just made it seem like he was thinking ""Wow she is so beautiful."" Vaughan and Wilson put on great performances. The story was sad but touching. I liked it so much that I want to go out and buy it on DVD!",1080864000,,349,4.0
1917030,5,B0000CABHV,This movie caught me by surprise as one of the best movies i've seen in a long time. I am obsessed. I keep telling everyone i know that they must watch it. The best thing about it is that it seems real. Not like a lot of movies where the dialog just seems too fake.,1073001600,,265,3.8363636363636364
1917031,5,B0000CABHV,"if you were there you already know ... give this flick your undivided attention to detail and background. A may ZING ... like WOW, anyway, you get it or you don't!! I DO.",1072742400,,170,4.181818181818182
1917032,5,B0000CABHV,This film has fine acting and is well crafted.  It captures a wonderful immediacy of the characters and has a compelling visual style.  A director worth watching in the future.,1072310400,,176,4.833333333333333
1917033,5,B0000CABHV,"This is the best film in years about how it is when an everyday girl falls in love with a guy who happens to be adorable and also a delinquent on his way to jail.  It's not about what happens, it's about living their lives, no phoney stuff, just the way it was.  The performances are ... performances?  When you're into it, it's happening.  Most movies, you know it's a movie and after the bling bling, who cares?  This one, you care.
I love this film.",1071014400,2,452,4.209302325581396
1917034,5,B0000CABHV,"It is rare that a movie like ""Falling Like This"" is made as it is a realistic story about teenage romance and its affect on the whole family.  Based on a true story, Katie falls in love with Boyd, a habitual offender who is also so cute and appealing that we all forget what a trouble-maker he is.  As Katie is drawn further into Boyd's life, she skips school and fights with her parents and finally goes on an escapade stealing purses.  It is a bittersweet time as Katie finally realizes that she has to save herself and move on with her own life.
Filmmaker Dani Minnick has assembled a great cast, including Patricia Clarkson, Elizabeth Ruscio and John Diehl as the parents and each of the actors embody people we cannot forget.  Alessandro Zezza's cinematography is artful and the editing slips us in and out of scenes in a mesmerizing way.  Not to be missed!",1070928000,4,862,4.5
1917035,5,B0000CABHV,"Falling Like This showcases compelling performances by two young actors, Brian Vaughan and Megan Wilson, and well as a typically polished turn by the luminous Patricia Clarkson.  Writer/Director Dani Minnick has crafted a compassionate examination of the ragged edge of suburban life as characterized by Boyd, a charming, vulnerable and inveterate juvenile delinquent whose love nearly derails the life of a free-spirited, middle-class teenage girl.  The underlying themes of adolescent rebellion, adult responsibility and the seductive power of love are woven elegantly in this dream-like film.",1070928000,,595,5.906976744186046
1917036,3,B0000CABHV,"The lead actor is the spitting image of a young Brad Pitt, he's also a talented actor with much potential. The female lead is a bit boring and is overshadowed by Boyd. I won't tell the story as you can get the gist of that from other reviews. This is not a movie too watch if you want too lift up your spirits. I think it does firmly explain why some girls like bad boys.) This initially turns into something exciting but the movie wanes as the antics just don't stop. You realize that no matter what some people do they will always be habitual offenders. Boyd is easy too like because he can be extremely charming and seems to have a good heart. The movie is about 20 minutes too long as it get's exhausting after a while. You also realize how a person's surroundings, and their parents greatly affect their children's actions. It was an interesting watch but has it's weaknesses as the movie tends to drag on and on. So if you're interested in human behavior/psychology and why certain people don't change or can't this is right up your alley. Anyone else I would let this one slide, it's just ok.",1382659200,,1099,4.392156862745098
1917037,3,B0000CABHV,I think this is a fairly good depiction of the life of a juvenile delinquent living in a family with little to no parental discipline.,1381449600,,134,4.4
1917038,1,B0000CABHV,There was zero audio and the video wasn't clear - I eneded up getting my money back so I can't honestly rate the movie.,1379030400,,119,4.0
1917039,3,B0000CABHV,The movie was alright.  Not the best movie I've seen.  The movie was not what I thought it would be about.,1374019200,,106,4.0
1917040,2,B0000CABHV,"Movie rather slow, acting was okay but not the best.  Story could have been better, too many gaps.  Fast forwarded to end.",1367366400,,122,4.5
1917041,5,B0000CABHV,"No, this isn't your usual teen romance. It's gritty and realistic--it feels, in fact, like cinema verite, shot as if the director simply turned on a camera and watched the train wreck happen.

The director chose perfect, very natural actors--in fact, I have a feeling they weren't really actors, just two ""real"" kids chosen because they were so right for the roles. And the roles are almost archetypal. Compulsive criminal Boyd is every parent's nightmare: a very bad boy with James Dean appeal. And Katie's an impressionable little moth drawn to his flame, and yet somehow able to avoid being consumed no matter how close she gets. Watching Boyd spin more and more out of control while Katie hangs on out of a yearning for adventure that she's too young to understand or control is both heart breaking and familiar.

I know these kids. I knew kids just like them when I was young, too. I both envied and feared their seemingly fatal attraction. This movie reminded me why I felt that way. And made me feel that dread tinged with a big dose of curiosity yet again.

It's definitely not ""Pretty in Pink."" But if you're ready for a true-to-life thrill ride, Boyd and Katie will take you where you want to go.",1364083200,,1206,4.626168224299065

1917043,1,B0000CABHV,"I was expecting something in the vein of ""Summer of 42"" because of the description, but this movie doesn't even come close.  It's so flat that you don't even care about the characters after the first 20 minutes or so.  The acting is atrocious.  The story is so uneven that it doesn't even feel like a story.",1353283200,,307,4.350877192982456
1917044,5,B0000CABHV,This was an amazing movie with some extremly talented actors! This movie makes me think back to all the troubled relationships I had in high school. I wish I could find more movie with Brian Vaughan in them because he was awesome in this movie!!!,1259539200,,246,4.488888888888889
1917045,5,B0000CABHV,"This movie reminds me of my teenage years almost exactly,it is one of the best films. It is a film you will want to buy and keep. I saw Brian Vaughn on the film Almost Famous for a split second,he was driving a VW van. He has not done much since but all his fans await. He doesn't even have a fan website or a MySpace account,I think he needs a new agent or something.
 So whats next for this next young talent we will have to wait and see!",1243123200,,440,3.888888888888889
7998440,3,B0000CABHV,"If this movie wasn't actually about my brother, Lloyd, I probably wouldn't have liked it much. But I did find it very interesting because I know the story first hand. I attended the opening in Hollywood & met the actors & was extremely impressed with Brian Vaughn as he did an excellent portrayal of his character! Unfortunately, the movie is pretty accurate, accept in the move ""Boyd"" has no sisters & Mom is not a beer drinkin country singer! Lol. Other than that, everything else is pretty much right on.",1432166400,,507,4.644444444444445

7998443,1,B0000CABHV,"Tuned off at the first bathroom scene, which seems to be an obligatory obsession with some directors these days.  Wouldn't recommend to anyone. When you think you've seen it all...you haven't.",1398556800,,192,5.193548387096774
7998444,5,B0000CABHV,"Set to the music of Ani di Franco, in what appears to be the late 70's, this story of a young romance- semi good girl / bad boy will grab you with its emotion, realism and simplicity. A very sad depiction of a young man who can't or won't abandon his no future life of crime, not for his baby daughter and not for the love of his life, Katy. Brian Vaughan and Megan Wilson are excellent as are all.",1392940800,,398,3.9875
7998445,5,B0000CABHV,"The film was well made the characters all played their parts well . The movie was real, it portrays the ups and downs of young love . I would recommend the movie to any teen .",1389484800,,175,3.888888888888889

7998447,4,B0000CABHV,"This film could serve as somewhat of a prequel to Sons of Anarchy. So far, that's what I enjoy about it",1388188800,,103,3.9523809523809526
7998448,4,B0000CABHV,"I enjoyed the movie - it was a realistic depiction of a girl getting involved with a delinquent.  The story shows the immaturity of teenagers, and a girls, inability to make choices that are in her best interest.  Throughout the movie she follows him around and participates in what he does.  He looks like a young Brad Pitt.  The acting was good - all cast members.",1385769600,,366,4.5
7998449,4,B0000CABHV,"very interesting movie. Tells about a summer romance of Brain Vaughn who plays Boyd a quiet and strange kid. The story and acting of this young man I my special 5- performance since this is his first acting job as a young 17 year old.  He is a tremendously good looking boy match with a comparable good looking young lady. A innocent attraction that goes wrong very fast.
This is a movie you like to take a date too. and  get into the richer screen\ play and can't wait to see what will happen next.
Be ready for this great coming of age movie.
Highly recomend this movie. I would have for me made it  5 star but there were a few things
I did not like about it  very dark in places and very noroctic depiction.of paranoia",1383091200,,721,4.202898550724638
