3951785,5,B002M3ZLXY,fun and hilarious gift for the holiday season.  provides great atmosphere...especially with an HD TV....you can almost feel the warmth of the fire from the tv.,1326844800,4,159,5.115384615384615
3951786,3,B002M3ZLXY,"I wish the fireplace scene would change a bit.  The log never burns down, nor is another log added. A little more action would be good.",1323648000,3,135,4.1923076923076925
3951787,5,B002M3ZLXY,"Love this video.  You have a choice of fire sounds or Christmas music.
I haven't done the music yet, but the fire feels so real I swear it makes
you warmer.",1295481600,6,156,4.032258064516129
3951788,5,B002M3ZLXY,"We bought this for our son in-law as a joke, and even though we had a good laugh it turned out to be a nice decorative addition to the Christmas holiday.  The music is also good.",1263081600,4,178,3.9444444444444446

3951810,5,B002M3ZLXY,"LOVE THIS during the holiday season! Beautiful family Christmas music for all ages! Great festive background music with a beautiful, warm, calming fireplace. Great for decorating the Christmas tree with the fam or have it on during meals, or even small holiday parties to add a more warm and peaceful feeling to the room over conversation with friends. I'd give it 4.5 stars for a few of the corny songs, but our kids love it so I love it too!",1472947200,,443,4.55
3951811,1,B002M3ZLXY,Horrible.  Poor quality.  Songs are not original,1454544000,,48,5.714285714285714
3951812,4,B002M3ZLXY,Nice Christmas music to relax by at night. Invokes memories of Christmas past as a child growing up in the midwest.,1453593600,,115,4.523809523809524
3951813,3,B002M3ZLXY,"nice  calming retro xmas music, but would have preferred to have episode with ""happy cat and dog"".",1453593600,,98,4.764705882352941
3951814,3,B002M3ZLXY,"Would have been very enjoyable but the music ruined it for us (yes I know you can turn it off, but we like music). They tried to be 'all things to all people,' so the music constantly changes style. Unless you like every style of music, you're going to hear something you wish will go away. Way too much jazz for us. Beautiful children's choir; a nice soloist who was way loud cf the rest ... you get the idea.",1450483200,,410,4.1375
3951815,1,B002M3ZLXY,Not my cup of tea too jazzy,1449273600,,27,3.0

3951829,1,B002M3ZLXY,I wish the music was simply fire crackling.. not a fan of the music.,1448755200,,68,3.9285714285714284
3951830,5,B002M3ZLXY,Very relaxing!!,1448064000,,15,7.0
3951831,5,B002M3ZLXY,Perfect for those without a fireplace,1447891200,,37,5.333333333333333
3951832,5,B002M3ZLXY,"A great addition to the DVD collection with the upcoming winter holidays! It's the perfect scene setter for my living room, and projects a realistic image. This is perfect for opening presents Christmas morning or as the background for a holiday get together!",1445990400,,259,5.046511627906977

3951838,3,B002M3ZLXY,"This isn't exactly what I was looking for but it's the best I could find on short notice, for free, so I'm giving it an average review.

The image quality is not very clear and it's not the best picture of a fire.  I thought it looked like a fire that had been neglected and was ready for a couple more logs...

The fact that it only plays for an hour is a drawback, too.  It worked in a pinch but next year I'll try to remember to find something that's a little higher quality with a little longer run time.",1419811200,,508,4.0
3951849,2,B002M3ZLXY,The quality of the picture is not very good. Turned on the PBS one instead.,1419811200,,75,4.066666666666666
3951850,5,B002M3ZLXY,Nice musical and visual background for a holiday party.,1419811200,,55,5.222222222222222

3951855,4,B002M3ZLXY,We liked it,1419638400,,11,3.0
3951856,5,B002M3ZLXY,"Great for the Christmas season---beautiful fire and wonderful Christmas music. Remember, the rental is for five days so schedule accordingly.",1419638400,,141,6.1
3951857,5,B002M3ZLXY,I had this on my Promethean board the last week of school before break and the kids loved it.  It kept them calm and focused.  I loved it too!,1419638400,,142,3.8620689655172415
3951858,1,B002M3ZLXY,I never could get it to intall.,1419552000,,31,3.5714285714285716
3951869,5,B002M3ZLXY,had a party it was a big hit on my tv screen,1419379200,,44,2.75
3951870,4,B002M3ZLXY,"Sure it's corny - but fun - and if nothing else, or really, all it is, are some Christmas classic songs - and instead of your TV screen being blank, there's an animated yule log burning.  What's not to like.",1419292800,,207,4.175
3951871,3,B002M3ZLXY,Picture was good and the sound was good.  There are discontinuities during play.  It is kind of like a break in a film and the two pieces are spliced together.  A neighbor has a Christmas log video and it recycles automatically.  This one is only an hour long and I can only recycle it manually.,1419033600,,295,4.3090909090909095
3951872,3,B002M3ZLXY,"Woo, big deal",1419033600,,13,3.6666666666666665
3951873,4,B002M3ZLXY,Best yule I've seen. Great fireplace and andirons.,1418688000,,50,5.375
3951874,3,B002M3ZLXY,"As long as you understand this show consists completely of video and crackling sounds of a fireplace along with Christmas music playing as the soundtrack, you will find this useful as background music for any celebration in your home during the holiday season. I had this on during a December birthday party and my guests found this suitable and interesting as background entertainment.",1418688000,,386,5.142857142857143
3951875,5,B002M3ZLXY,Best soundtrack for a movie ever made!  Fun and entertaining movie for the whole family!  Definitely a great addition to the movie library.,1418428800,,139,5.0
3951876,5,B002M3ZLXY,Love!,1418083200,,5,5.0
3951877,2,B002M3ZLXY,"Very nice tunes, sort of soft-jazzy, mellow instrumentals with a few nicely done vocal tracks.  Excellent choice if you're sick of the standard Bing Crosby/ Grandma-Reindeer tunes.  However, the video is a loop tape of only a few minutes of the same firelogs, over and over, copied from a poor-quality videotape, very grainy and unrealistic.  For a good fireplace video, try ""Fireplace for your Home presents Crackling Fireplace"", an hour-long video that shows pine logs actually burning down, complete with pops and sparks.  Combine with your favorite Christmas tunes, and you're good to go.",1417910400,,592,5.26595744680851
3951878,5,B002M3ZLXY,We had this playing in the background multiple times last Christmas and we will definitely use it again this year. You can hear the crackle of the fire and the music is subtle and pretty.,1417392000,,187,4.371428571428571
3951879,5,B002M3ZLXY,Super relaxing and great.  I pretty watch this all year round.,1415318400,,62,4.636363636363637

3951886,5,B002M3ZLXY,It's a beaut Clark ! Wish it was longer as I like to play it for parties and I had to restart it a few times.,1389139200,,109,3.230769230769231
3951887,5,B002M3ZLXY,This is Just like having a real fire with noise and all. Only thing missing is the warmth and smell.,1389052800,,100,4.05
3951888,3,B002M3ZLXY,"It was a little vintage looking, but I kind of enjoyed that as we were opening presents on Christmas morning.",1388966400,,109,4.5
3951889,5,B002M3ZLXY,"If you don't have a fireplace & miss the crackling & firelight, this is for you. It also has very nice music to go along. A very nice addition for Christmas.",1388880000,,157,4.096774193548387
3951890,5,B002M3ZLXY,It created a nice anbiance when sitting around opening presents on Christmas morning.  The music playing helped with the atmosphere also.,1388793600,,137,5.523809523809524
3951891,3,B002M3ZLXY,I wish they had a better selection of songs. Maybe they can do a remix for next Holiday Season. But this version did not impress me very much.,1388620800,,142,4.107142857142857
3951892,5,B002M3ZLXY,Great video. Love sound of the crackling fire in the background of the traditional Christmas music. I kept it on as brackground in the evenings as I read.,1388534400,,154,4.535714285714286
3951893,5,B002M3ZLXY,Gave a warm feeling to the room!  Was very nice and would use it throughout the year.  Enjoyed it lots.,1388188800,,103,4.1
3951894,5,B002M3ZLXY,I had it going for hours and I loved it. Its as close as it gets to the real deal.,1388102400,,82,3.15
3951895,4,B002M3ZLXY,It worked and was a nice background effect.  Wish there was a way to loop it so it played for longer than an hour.,1387929600,,114,3.75
3951896,4,B002M3ZLXY,Works for the TV...all the guests liked it and it brought up the holiday spirit. Will try again another year.,1387843200,,109,4.5
3951897,5,B002M3ZLXY,"Nice. Exactly as I expected. I put this on my computer at work while we wrapped presents, I mean worked. LOL",1387756800,,108,4.190476190476191
3951898,3,B002M3ZLXY,Video quality is fair com paired to one the runs on local cable provider.  Prime is only reason I viewed.,1387756800,,105,4.25
3951899,5,B002M3ZLXY,Was very realistic and look great on our big screen.  What a nice thing to  see here at Christmas time.,1387584000,,103,4.1
3951900,3,B002M3ZLXY,Very realistic site and sound but would like it on a loop or a longer video.  But its free at least.,1387324800,,100,3.761904761904762
3951901,4,B002M3ZLXY,"I love having this option while I'm perhaps reading or snuggling with my dog.  However, I think Prime members should have the continuous streaming option free and not have to pay anything for it.",1386892800,,195,4.735294117647059
3951902,1,B002M3ZLXY,Sound would fade in and out !!!  Why must I write more words then I need to ???? This is why I do not rate very often !!!,1386374400,,121,3.3214285714285716
3951903,5,B002M3ZLXY,A video to enjoy if you don't want to watch the lousy TV programs that are on and want to get away and enjoy the holiday.,1383868800,,121,3.6923076923076925
3951904,5,B002M3ZLXY,This is the one to get if you don't have a real fireplace great music and fun to listen too when are watching this,1368144000,,114,3.7916666666666665
3951905,2,B002M3ZLXY,"Netflix has a couple of these that I liked and couldn't find, so I tried this one.  The music is not traditional holiday arrangements, it's jazzed up or something, and didn't create that holiday feel.  There are better ones out there.",1362960000,3,234,4.682926829268292
3951906,5,B002M3ZLXY,"I didn't know Amazon had the streaming Christmas videos, free for Prime members. It is wonderful, clear and HD and better music than the Yulelog on Time Warner Cable. Thank you Amazon for this Christmas present.",1355875200,2,211,4.888888888888889
3951907,4,B002M3ZLXY,"This is the one for which you seek. It is a real fire, not looping, zoomed in to show just the interior of the fireplace, but not so zoomed in that the flames are cut off at the top of the screen. You can choose to play it with just with the sound of the crackling fire, or with holiday music playing in the background. The music isn't that bad...a decent mix of instrumental and vocal Christmas pieces by no one you've ever heard of before. I personally prefer to have just the fire crackling and supplement with my own music on the stereo, but to each their own. Now, if you're just streaming it via the website, you're not going to have a choice...they only stream it with the background music, so if you don't like the music, you'll just have to turn the volume all the way down. Of course, this means no crackling sound, so if you're dying for that more realistic ""my TV is on fire, put that out before you burn the house down"" experience, then for heaven's sake, just shell out the cash and get the cheap DVD. It'll be worth it as it keeps you and your loved ones warm for years to come.",1354233600,4,1093,4.184834123222749
3951908,4,B002M3ZLXY,"There were no reviews when I saw this so I figured I'd help everyone out and write one. This is exactly what you think it is, about an hour and a half of logs burning in a fireplace and horrible music to accompany it. I truly mean it... this is some god awful music which takes away from the wondrous beauty that is a burning hunk of wood in a fireplace. Now you may be wondering: why on earth would anyone watch this? That is a great question that I have been wondering myself as it is late August and insanely hot outside... yet I clicked on this anyway. I would imagine that if you live in a country where you can freeze to death just by walking outside or it's winter time and you don't have a source of heat it would be nice to sit around the computer screen and pretend to be warm. Or if you just need something to put on tv when you have relatives over during the holidays that would work really well too I guess. Now you may be wondering why I only gave it a 4 star rating and I have to say it's absolutely perfect other then the music. The music itself is a crime against humanity, I don't think you guys can understand how much I hate this music. Now you make like it, who am I to judge, but I would suggest muting while watching and playing something else in the background. Other then that it's perfect!",1346025600,13,1315,4.10077519379845
