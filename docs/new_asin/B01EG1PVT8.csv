7734662,3,B01EG1PVT8,I enjoyed this though it isn't great but it is entertaining and kept my interest for the most part.  The best part was Vernon Wells (Commando) and Richard Hatch (Battlestar Gallactica the original).  There was even a reference to Richard Hatch's character Apollo which I got and found amusing.  Aliens weren't great but could have been worse.,1485820800,,342,4.964912280701754
7734663,4,B01EG1PVT8,Enjoyed watching with my family.  There was nothing but action happening.,1485388800,,73,5.636363636363637
7734664,4,B01EG1PVT8,It had a good story & writing but it's a good thing that the aliens were not in a hurry because the law officer and ranger were pretty pokey but I did enjoy it though. Had some pretty good effects also.,1485388800,2,202,3.951219512195122
7734665,1,B01EG1PVT8,"Lions and tiger and bears, oh my; no not leopards; they're not indigenous to California.

hillbilly fest, ""I ain't stoopid""; well, that's a matter of opinion.

bikers, proof that even the even the morbidly obese have a future in hollywood; or just attach strings and you have an instant Thanksgiving Day parade float. helium not required.
How about a hillbilly Mr. Stay Puff, now there's a thought for the next Ghost Busters sequel.

""everybody knows you prefer hotels to camping"" says she derisively. uh, is there something wrong with modern conveniences and room service?",1485388800,2,573,5.074468085106383
7734666,1,B01EG1PVT8,Just plain stupid. I made it thru the first 25 mins.  I value my time too much to throw it away.,1485388800,,96,3.5714285714285716

7734668,5,B01EG1PVT8,This movie is quite funny. Great score!,1484784000,,39,4.714285714285714
7734669,3,B01EG1PVT8,i laughed the whole way through this....,1484352000,3,40,4.857142857142857
8758469,3,B01EG1PVT8,"Actually, not too bad. Pretty good for what it is. Probably on par with what you see on SyFy network.",1527984000,,101,4.1
8758470,5,B01EG1PVT8,"5 stars, great movie with lots of action, scifi alien,slasher, and comedy.  Lots of real car crash action, the crashes remind me of the CHIPs TV show car crashes.  Stuntmen instead of CGI, there is very little CGI which I love most movies are so full of it that it is overdone.
Plus it has Richard Hatch (Apollo of Battlestar Galactia Original series and Tom Zarek of the new Battlestar Galactia) There is even an inside joke where he refers to Captain Apollo",1513900800,,459,4.518072289156627
8758471,3,B01EG1PVT8,"I enjoyed this movie, it was better than I thought it would be.  A good alien/monster movie with lots of exciting, suspenseful and frightening moments. One thing I don't understand, though, is what is up with the credits for the actors in this movie's description? This movie stars Richard Hatch and Vernon Wells, I don't know who the heck ""Krystal Banks"" nor any of the other names listed in the description are, but they're not in this movie.",1508371200,,444,4.6923076923076925
8758472,2,B01EG1PVT8,"Pretty goofy. I found it amusing that the aliens arrived and came out of their ship dressed in pants and jackets along with hiking boots. They did have cool rubber masks, though. That, and scary Halloween gloves. I actually made it a third of the way through.",1503446400,,259,4.531914893617022
8758473,3,B01EG1PVT8,3.5 stars.  A decent movie that's one step above the usual SyFy stuff.  This must have been one of Hatch's last flicks.  The bloopers at the end indicate the cast must had a ball during the filming.,1501977600,,198,4.297297297297297
8758474,5,B01EG1PVT8,Awsome,1496620800,,6,6.0

8758476,3,B01EG1PVT8,Was ok..,1488240000,,8,3.5
8758477,2,B01EG1PVT8,"How lame can a movie get?  There are certainly worse than this.  The laugh, and it's not meant to be, is the speed at which the director decided the aliens needed to move.

Would I watch this again? Nope.",1487548800,,204,4.17948717948718
8758478,4,B01EG1PVT8,"This B movie delivers the goods. If I can actually watch it and get somewhat sucked in, it's a great B movie. Don't expect award-winning writing, acting, and effects, but do expect cheap entertainment. Good mindless time waster.",1486944000,,228,5.026315789473684
