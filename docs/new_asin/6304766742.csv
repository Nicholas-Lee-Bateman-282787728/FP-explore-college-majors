923196,5,6304766742,"I started watching this DVD what at the Red Cross giving platelets, but didn't get to finish it.  I was so into the story that I had to buy the DVD just to see the last 30 minutes of it.  It's a simple romantic comedy, but the Irish characters make it great.",1500595200,,258,3.9423076923076925
923197,5,6304766742,One of my favorite movies about an old curmudgeon finding love. Great cast. Still one of my favorite rom-coms to this day.,1499904000,,122,4.590909090909091
923198,5,6304766742,I happened upon this movie in the $1 bargain rental section.  I have no idea how it ended up there because after I watched it I knew I needed a copy.  This movie is a silly campy smooshie love story. The music fits well. I love this movie and have watched it so many times. When I tell people about it they are clueless.  Don't miss this one if you are a romantic.,1490832000,,364,3.958904109589041

923283,4,6304766742,Saw movie before. Just wanted to own it as it was a sweet movie and the scenery of Ireland was beautiful. The premise of a matchmaking event in Ireland was interesting and is based on a real event that happens yearly there. Not much for romantic comedies but this was certainly a pleasant and surprising exception.,1486684800,,314,4.625

923285,3,6304766742,"I really enjoyed this movie but i thought that we were done with non-anamorphic DVDs. If you select widescreen then the viewer has black bars on 4 sides of a awfully pixelated image. The 4:3 pan and scan image is equally objectionable. Don't buy this.

The movie gets 4 stars but the DVD gets 0 , 3 in the aggregate is being kind. Amazon should label DVDs as anamorphic or pan and scan.",1480636800,4,386,4.287671232876712

923560,1,6304766742,"One of the worst ""date movies"" I've ever seen.  I won't go into the plot line because plenty has been written before on that.  The very beginning of a good movie is the writing. This movie fails miserably on that point.  There is very little character development in the movie.  You don't feel anything for what the 2 major characters are going through.  When the script throws the 2 together you're left wondering ""why are they together?""  You don't sense any romance at that point.  Marcy (the lead character), in one minute of screen time, goes from thinking that Sean's singing to her off key to get a kiss is sweet to her jumping his bones.  The rest of movie shows her having feelings for the guy but you have no idea whatsoever how it started.  There are other problems with the script that are too numerous to mention.  Let's just say this is dysfunctional script writing at its finest.",1438560000,,894,4.53125
923561,5,6304766742,"This is a movie I like abought a girl that goes on a business trip to Ireland to find herself smack dab in the middle of a Matchmaker festival.

923566,4,6304766742,"This movie is a guilty pleasure for me; I really love it, and watch it every St. Patrick's Day, which seems the perfect time to ""visit"" Ireland via a movie. Janeane Garafaolo is adorable and smart and funny; there's a handsome Irishman, a pub, lots of countryside, and an adorable old matchmaker, with a conniving dishonest politician (a little over the top there by Denis Leary) and lots of green hills and Irish village scenery. This is one of my favorite cheer-myself-up movies.",1431907200,5,481,4.807228915662651
923567,4,6304766742,"While I enjoyed the movie and will watch it again (for academic study purposes), I found that the dvd copy I bought had sound aberrations.  In order to properly listen to the dialog, I had to up the volume but then was blasted by any music that followed.  In addition, a post production problem was some obviously choppy cuts.  Another reviewer mentioned lip sync miscues.  Finally, when I looked again at the disc I received I wondered if it is a ""copied"" one, or what!  I hope I am wrong.

The rating I have given reflects my take on the story, which I enjoyed.",1430352000,3,563,4.365384615384615

923622,5,6304766742,"Oh yes, this is probably one of the best movies I have ever seen. I think I'm just going to watch it and rewatch it over and over again to see what happens.  Over and over again with a gangsta movie like Goodfellas every now and then, and American Gangsta, Godfather all that stuff, then keep watching Matchmaker over and over again, at least 100 times a month.  Then intermediately read a passage from the Satanic Bible.  Then go out into the woods and smear blood on three trees like a triangle and carve something in another language, make one up.  Then stand in the middle, take a deep breath, and possess myself with Janeane Garofalo, then I wouldn't have to watch anymore of her movies cause I'll already know everything.  Then study at UTSA something cool or go to a basketball game.  Yes, this is actually Janane Garofalo.",1428451200,,830,4.5369127516778525

923690,1,6304766742,"I'm not sure that the viewers who gave this movie 5 stars watched the same film I did. This movie misses the mark in every area, which is regrettable because the main actors have been very good in other films. Yes, the scenery is beautiful - it's Ireland, for goodness sake, so the setting has to be a positive. That's the only one, though. The story line is disjointed, the dialogue is weak, and the characters are undeveloped. The main character, Marcy, is dropped from Boston into Ireland before the viewer has a chance to care where she is - there's no connection with her or really with any of the characters. And ""hilarious"" it was not. Leap Year, a film similar in location (Ireland) & genre (comedy), is a much better movie if you like to have a decent plot, good acting, snappy dialogue, & actual humor in your comedies. In addition, the beauty of the Irish setting was somewhat tarnished by the countless times the actors dropped the ""F"" bomb - too many to count & totally, ridiculously unnecessary - evidently, that's what the writers resorted to when they couldn't think of any actual lines. I gave this movie one star only because no stars is not an option.",1426032000,4,1170,4.549763033175355

Janine Garofalo plays a senator's aide from Boston whose boss, the senator, wants her to travel to Ireland .  He wants her to find any family of his that might be left there from 3 generations back that have immigrated to Boston.  She goes to a tiny little town in Ireland, not knowing that there's a matchmaking festival going on.  Early on she meets an Irish journalist at the hotel she's staying at.  A matchmaker attempts to set them up, as he has made several successful marriages.  As the story unfolds, with a few little twists and turns, she finds love, only to have it taken away.

Being that it's mostly based in Ireland you get a lot of quircky Irish character ators and a story spread kinda thin...i.e...too much happening for a 90 minute film.

Watching this you'll see why this film wasn't a big success but just shake it off and watch The Truth about Cats and Dogs to see what Janeane Garofalo can really do.

Now for the film transfer to dvd. This is this disc's Achilles heal. This was an extremely poor dvd transfer. You get a flipper disc....widescreen or formatted TV resolution. Choosing the widescreen and watching it on a 32"" Vizio LCD is not very good. My guess is that they only had access to a pretty bad film print from somewhere cause when you watch it...it shows.

It's a charming small town with locals that are full of piss and wind - as are most Irish towns.  If you ever have the chance to visit Roundstone, I highly recommend it (I spent my 30th birthday there just because of this movie!).  Anyway, the chemistry between Marcy & Sean is tremendous!

I really don't know why, but that one failing cannot even begin to touch the beauty of the land and the people of Ireland. As for those who thought it was using every cheap stereotype of Ireland and the Irish people, it just shows how ignorant Americans can be--they can't laugh at themselves, so why should another culture be able to create humour out of the very stereotypes Americans have created. Let's get back to the positive! The music was beautifully scored, and anyone who has actually made the effort to go to the stones of Dn Aengus on Inis Mr could not possibly think that this movie cheapens any part of the Irish Spirit. I am only saddened to see people post such insular American remarks about a movie that is full of joy--not foul language and ignorant use of stereotypes.

I wound up sitting uncomfortably through the entire movie.  From a distance...Ireland seems beautiful (I have never been there).  However, up close, the people were endowed with mean-spirited caricatures, with every negative Irish stereotype gathered in one village.  Two adult(?) brothers constantly physically fighting with each other, too much drinking, bad driving, or just plain loud and silly -no one that I would care to know.  It took all the romance out of romantic and funny out of comedy.

I'm thinking of a much better movie set in Ireland (sorry, can't think of the name) about a girl who gets pregnant by her father's friend.  While the film was funny, it had a real sense of the people, the attitudes, and the community.  Again, I'm sorry I can't remember the name of this movie, which I would recommend.

Janeane Garofalo ad David O'Hara are ideal actors for characters that are smart and funny with just the right amount of cynicism and vulnerability under the surface to make them seem real, relatable. They reminded me of people I actually know. Very refreshing.

And what I found REALLY refreshing was to see the male lead actively and very directly chase the girl (like a man is supposed to, lol) and the female lead while not initially receptive, was also not a bitter, angry shrew. There's conflict of course, or we wouldn't be interested in watching, but again, because the characters are well written and well cast, there's no need for an over the top situation to keep the couple apart and somehow, lo and behold, the audience still roots for them to get together! Finally, a modern romantic comedy that doesn't rely on the lead characters having to fight and bicker for 45 minutes to an hour before hooking up.

It doesn't hurt that there's a talented supporting cast that includes Denis Leary and that the film was shot on location in Ireland so the scenery is beautiful. The music is great too.

924175,5,6304766742,"Romance in the Shamrock Lane on a big green bus!!!!!

  We are talking comedy and charm in big doses! This is a well written, fast paced, script about romance.... with some blue language hovering in the air from time to time.
  In Ireland they'd say ""soft weather,"" regarding the rain....Here it might be said ""blue weather ahead,"" not appropriate for young children.

  Nevertheless, this sweet little romance, is worth it's price, because you will want to re watch it, from time to time, say...on a rainy night... with a cup of tea, when you have a cold, and enjoy some good craic (that's Irish for fun, but you already knew that didn't you?

  And this tiny film will also manage to amuse the gents; it's not a typical chick flick! This film was a, ""two thumbs up,"" from Siskal & Ebert: High praise indeed!

  The main characters interact well and of course; while we all know it's not real life, we want to believe that this could happen to us! Some of us would hope.... ""For a second time around....""

  It does feature a terrific cast and the wonderful scenery of County Clare in Western Ireland. The secondary characters remind us that this movie is  truly about the spirit, cleverness, and determination of the Irish people; even against the insanity of the American political machine: politicians, political campaigns, and everyone involved.

  We want to buy into the myth that true love awaits each of us, away from home, or, in this case, over the big blue pond, no matter how spotty our complexions, how homely, how plump; how unsuitable, or ill matched. Our next true love will see beyond the outer surface into our hearts of gold, and they are waiting.... to be found at an Irish matchmaking festival.

  It does shortchange Irish women- being mostly about the Americans coming over to capture the hearts of the Irish menfolk...until one cunning Irish lass manages to snatch the Senators heart. One of the minor characters is Marcy's friend; a young woman with a strong heart who runs the hotel and manages the menfolk, no small feat.

  Janeane Garafalo is brilliant as the young but jaded campaign aid/advisor; David O'Hara is a surprise; he sets out to win her heart, and wins ours, in the process. O'Shay is a rascal, that we love from the first moment we set eyes upon him. Denis Leary steals the show as the evil Campaign manager who will use and abuse anyone to suit his own needs.

  While the scenery also plays a starring role....an Irish friend of mine recently was heard to grumble, ""It's not all Guinness running from the taps, and butter and eggs hanging from the trees, in Ireland.""

  The scenes on Innishear Island are lovely and the scene at Shannon Airport is haunting when Marcey gazes upon the mural of President John Kennedy. She manages to mispronounce names that most tourists know well; and most campaign aids would have researched with Mapquest and Google, in this day, and age.

  Still, it's a ""perfek"" little international romance (in the words of Pop Larkin, in The Darling Buds Of May!)

  Enjoy........

  If you enjoy this movie I also recommend: Waking Ned Devine, Widows Peak, and The Darling Buds of May, where a very young Catherine Zeta Jones made her screen debut.

924220,3,6304766742,I was a disappointed with The Matchmaker.  Too many Irish stereotypes are in the film.  The film definitely views Irish people through uneducated American eyes.  Not authentic.  This is my first review on anything purchased on [...].,1211414400,,233,5.216216216216216
924221,5,6304766742,"Marcy Tizard (Garafalo) spends 98% of her time working on US Senator John McGlory's (Sanders) re-election campaign. The rest--she sleeps.

Unfortunately, the campaign is not doing well and the Boston-based Senator is going to need some serious support to pull the election off.  Who's he going to call?  The ancestors!

It's a brilliant plan:  go to the ancestral village in Ireland, dig up some family, record a photo op and some sound bytes, and McGlory's a shoo-in for the Boston Irish vote.

When Marcy gets to Ireland, she has two problems.  One, no one's ever heard of the McGlory's and two, there's a matchmaking festival going on.

Yes, a matchmaking festival.  Women from all over come to this particular spot in Ireland to find a husband.  And Dermot O'Brien is the best of the matchmakers--or so he claims.

""The Matchmaker"" only got funnier the second time we saw it.  My husband and I were laughing so hard in places, we had to pause the DVD so we didn't miss anything.
If you enjoy Irish music and biting humor--this is definitely a film for you.  If you enjoy a little romance--you're going to like it, too.

We rented this film, but at this price, I am going to add it to our collection.  It's well worth another watch every four years or so.",1199664000,7,1258,4.603603603603603

Marcie is a young, single, political consultant sent to Ireland to research the ancestry of her candidate who is slipping in the polls. In order to secure the Boston Irish vote, she is sent to Ireland and finds herself in the middle of a Matchmaking Festival. The cynical nature of her character and the blind pursuit of her assignment is disturbed by meeting Sean-a local bartender/writer. The other characters conspire to bring them together.

Along the way you see real Irish landscape as the movie is shot in Ireland. Irish locals are used as extras. The combination of these two factors gives the viewer an authenic feel of Ireland. (I have been there myself, so I know.)

Janeane Garafalo is hillarious and believable as are the rest of the actors. There are many memorable lines in the movie. My favorite is uttered when marcie realizes that she has to board a very small plane to reach her destination. While standing anxiously on the tarmac she says; ""It's a little baby planelette.""

Amongst the obstacles in Marcy's way are a matchmaker festival, eccentric characters, a wily matchmaker and a cynical journalist who might just be her match.  Janeane Garofalo has never been better at playing a character that is both tough and vulnerable.  Milo O'Shea is wonderful and David O'Hara is terrific as the romantic foil.

924227,4,6304766742,"The plot of ""The Matchmaker"" has been told in depth by many reviewers as well as the talent shown by all the actors. I would like to add a little comment on the characteristics that I liked most and that will make me remember this work.
There are many reasons to see this movie, even now that it is ten years old.
The first is that it stands the test of time: it is still as fresh and entertaining as when it came out and it deals with timeless problems that have somehow become cliches: raskally political men, the importance the Americans give to finding their roots, overwork, the difficulty of a womans role, loneliness and love.
The second is that all the actors are well casted, very good and true to life, they don't seem to come out of a refinished, glossy out of the world reality.
The third is that its humoristic with fine ironic dialogue that makes a laugh or two.
But the fourth reason is the most important of all and it is the lively, precise and poetic description of the beauty and tradition of Ireland's West Coast from Connemara to Aran Island to Lisdoonvarna's long standing matchmaking tradition.
If at this point the reader is not bored I would like to make the point on how a good script makes a good movie.
Lisdoonvarna's Matchmaking Festival held every year in September-October dates back to the 18th Century, when after the summer harvesting rich Irish countrymen went to Lisdoonvarna for the famous spa with warm waters. Here they arranged marriages for their sons and daughters with the help of the traditional figure of the Matchmaker (man or woman) of which I believe a few still survive today. Lisdoonvarna is in County Clare to the south of the West Irish Coast, while the movie was shot in the more picturesque Roundstone Connemara north of Galway and on Aran Island, but the atmosphere of this beautiful corner of the world is all there.
Ireland also has a tradition of singing contests that is well depicted in the movie. The soundtrack is really important in defining the atmospheres and all the songs are chosen with real feeling as can be seen by all the reviews that ask for the soundtrack.
It is incredible and a little pedantic to say but from this movie we not only get entertainment but also a little bit of culture.",1183852800,2,2260,4.568965517241379
924228,4,6304766742,"I've always liked this movie, and I think the 2 leads (Janeane Garofalo and the ""yummy"" David O'Hara) are charming and very funny (and dare I say realistic and believable?).  The supporting characters -- the shady American politicians (Jay O'Sanders and Denis Leary) as well as all the quirky locals in the little Irish coastal town -- are also hilarious.  The plot is a bit madcap in places, but good clean fun.",1183766400,,412,4.708333333333333
924229,4,6304766742,"Janeane Garofalo is an underused talent but she did have the opportunity to shine a few times on the big screen. This is one of those examples which, proves that good acting and a great screen presence is not reserved for stars with huge names and multi-million dollar signing contracts (though, it's a shame that Ms. Garofalo isn't pulling down super-star paychecks). This story is set in an Ireland that may be quaint but also shows it's cracks; they just aren't afraid of them. Instead it's the rough and tumble flaws of this country's people and locales that makes it so endearing as the primary setting. Janeane is a misplaced campaign employee trying to track down the roots of her boss, the candidate, who believes he has roots in a particular town on the coast of Ireland. To make matters worse than her difficulty getting to this place she lands in the midst of a matchmaker's festival. She has no interest in getting hooked up and only wants to get her job done so she can return to civilization. What she finds are scammers, overbooked hotels and a matchmaker desperate to hook her up with a rough-around-the-edges local son recently returned home. Dennis Leary plays a conniving campaign manager who is more focused on victory than on relative facts and also treats folks like Janeane's character like an under-achieving serf. Without giving too much away Janeane is a delight and a genuine talent. I doubt that this film did very well and that's a shame. It has some predictable romantic chops but it also has some wonderful dialogue and biting wit as well as observations on the shamelessness of politics.

The characters are well enough developed that you can identify with them and come to like, love (or, in some cases, hate)the characters as the movie progresses. The dialogue is snappy and smart and assumes a basic level of intelligence. Jeanene Garofalo is such a terrific comic actress because she manages to portray an intelligent woman who has the same hang ups as the rest of the world. David O'Hara is a desperately underused actor in American movies (he was the crazy Irishman in Braveheart). Their relationship seems pretty real, since she loves him and yet still wants to kick him from time to time.

I felt real affection for most of the characters in this movie and I thought it made some good, if gentle, observations about American politics and how our priorities get a bit mixed up.

She has a disdain throughout the film, like she doesn't really believe in the material.  She's far too smart and cynical to really pull this kind of fluff off, even though, if they cast another actress, it would still be a middling film.  The film is not horrible.  It has its moments of charm and sweetness, and a few funny scenes.  The biggest asset it has is that it's filmed in Ireland.  The locations are magnificent, and the filmmakers should be commended for shooting there.  The film would be absolutely abysmal if it was shot somewhere else.

924287,5,6304766742,"Hi,

I found ""The Matchmaker"" to be an amusing, delightful and humorous film. The story begins with a Senator's aide, played by Janeane Garofalo, whose senator is seeking re-election, in order, to stir up votes, he decides that he wants his aide to go on a small business trip to a small fishing village in Ireland.

The reason for the senator wanting his aide to travel to Ireland is because he sees himself as a J.F.K. clone, in that, like J.F.K.'s real roots being Irish, so this senator is lead to believe by his father that their family is of Irish descent, too, whose surname is McGlory; hence, his reasons for having his aide travel across the Atlantic over to Ireland to discover his Irish roots, in order, to muster up the Irish vote in Boston, where the senator's home is. Figuring that like J.F.K. had Irish roots, then he views himself as someday being president, this is implied; although, as fas as I can remember, never actually stated, but the innuendo is prominent.

Once, the senator aide reaches Ireland at the beginning of the film she runs into all kinds of problems from almost missing her flight, to flying on a small cramped plane, to almost missing her bus and landing in the water, the movie is chock full of hilarious moments, but you'll have to rent or buy the VHS or DVD version, in order, to discover other silly adventures, which befall the main character, the senator's aide played by Janeane Garofalo.

I give this five stars for it's humor and one poignant scene.

Rent it, or buy it, you'll be glad you did!

924288,4,6304766742,"""The Matchmaker"" is a charming comedy set in rural Ireland and starring an unlikely heroine: Janeane Garofalo, better known as a stand-up comedienne who's worked with Ben Stiller, SNL, and Romy and Michelle's High School Reunion. Janeane stars as Marcy Tizard, harried assistant to Senator John McGlory in the middle of his reelection campaign. The campaign isn't going well, and McGlory and his chauvinistic, power-hungry handler Nick (Denis Leary) send Marcy to Ballinagra, Ireland to look up the senator's Irish roots in a bid to connect with Irish-American voters.

Marcy arrives in the middle of the town's matchmaking festival, where every male wants nothing more than to propose, from the dashingly handsome to the decrepit. Getting information from the locals is more of a challenge than she'd realized. The small village is full of colourful characters, and Marcy becomes attached to Sean (David O'Hara), a former journalist who's dead-ended himself as bartender. The charming Milo O'Shea as the town's matchmaker brought to mind David Kelly in ""Waking Ned Devine.""

The scenery of the rugged Irish coast (Cliffs of Moher) and Aran Isles (one of the last bastions of Irish Gaelic, as evidenced by Irish-language signs and greetings) and the rollicking Irish score, with contributions by Van Morrison, the Chieftains, Waterboys, and more, will appeal to lovers of Celtic lore, unusual romances, and low-key comedies.

The fictional village of Bali Na Gragh (sp?) is overcast yet welcoming, and the people all look real (not like extras on a Hollywood set).  It is refreshing to find a romantic comedy that does not take place in an urban landscape.  You won't find any Mystic Tanned lads or lasses here!  Janeane Garafolo is gorgeously pale, and looks like a real woman.  Her acting here is first rate, as usual.  After watching the movie 8 times, it is hard to imagine anyone else playing the role of Marcy.  Her ""match"", Sean, played by David O'Hara is one of my favorite male movie characters ever.  He is a charming, intelligent cad with a heart of gold.  O'Hara is definately not a Brad Pitt or Ben Affleck (thank God!), but man is he sexy!  It's about time a romantic comedy has a male lead that isn't prettier than his female costar.  The matchmaker, played by Milo O'Shea is the glue that holds this terrific story together.  O'Shea's narration throughout the film is hilarious.  All the supporting cast is excellent, although I don't understand why Denis Leary gets top billing in this film (after Garafolo).  His part was very small, only somewhat pivotal, and could have been played by anyone.  The movie follows Marcy to Ireland as she searches for Senator John McGlory's Irish roots.  She happens to arrive during the matchmaking festival and meets Sean, who thoroughly irritates her.  You can guess what happens next.  I usually hate romantic comedies.  Any Meg Ryan/Tom Hanks combo makes me run for the hills!  If you are like me, watch The Matchmaker.  If the quirky, realistic story doesn't endear you, the soundtrack will!  In fact, my ONLY complaint about The Matchmaker is that the soundtrack is not available.  Do not miss this movie!

Jeanne Garofarlo plays the cynical, sarcastic Marcy. An aide to a Boston senator McGlory. McGlory sends Marcy to a remote village of Ballinagra to dig up some McGlory relatives to help in his campaign. Along her way she meets some interesting locals. There she catches the eye of matchmaker Dermot played by Milo O'Shea. Dermot senses the chemistry between Marcy and the equally cynical Sean played by David O'Hara. A former journalist who has just returned to his local village to write a book.

The best parts are the meeting of the two wayward singles. Marcy bumps into Sean in her bathroom at this hotel she didn't actually plan on. She got caught in a jam of finding proper room & board during the Matchmaking Fest. Now, isn't that fate or what? The scenes with his dog are so funny. As are the scenes in the pub. The singing contest. The hiliarious scene with the folk they scourged up to be the misfit McGlory clan. It was a riot! And the always growing relationship between the two lonely singles, Marcy and Sean.

When all good things come to a close with the death of Dermot the Matchmaker. Marcy must return with her boss back to Boston. Marcy's last visit to Dermot's cottage to find a package waiting for her. She leaves what really mattered in her life behind her.  It ends in a very sweet reunion of the two lovers. It's just a really darlin' sweet film. It tells one that you can find love where you least expect it. It's a feel good film, when you're feeling down. It has some of the most beautiful cinematography of breath-taking Ireland. And the music is really great. Traditional and very Irish! Like you're really there having a good time in the local pub. Now those Irish know how to have a good time! I think I'd add this to my VHS collection of Irish films.",1013472000,,1934,4.473087818696884
924377,5,6304766742,"OK, I love this movie not only because it's partially based in my hometown (Boston!), but because it's a fantastic romantic comedy that can appeal to both women and men.  Janeane Garofalo's character Marcie is a senator's aide who gets sent to Ireland to trace the senator's ""destiny"" (i.e. his ancestors and any living relatives).  Instead, she arrives during a matchmaking festival and finds love with a rather flirtatious bartender/former journalist named Sean (David O'Hara).  Stand-out scenes include the senator's reunion with his ""relatives"" (Ya brazen hussy!) and the final twist at the end (a confession from the senator's father).  It's a must-see comedy.",1013385600,,665,5.365384615384615
924378,4,6304766742,"The Matchmaker is a romantic comedy with a twist - it has an orginal premise, funny characters, truly comic moments,  and the leads look like real people, which only adds to their appeal.
Janeane Garaofalo, as the U.S. Senator's aide visiting a coastal Irish village during their annual matchmaking fair, is funny and caustic.  David O'Hara, as the seemingly n'er do well bartender who turns out to have a bit more going for him, is sexy as all get out, without looking anything like a Hollywood pretty boy.
The two stars have great chemistry and timing with each other, and the supporting cast is excellent. The only false notes are sounded by Dennis Leary, who overacts a bit as the obnoxious Senator's aide, and the character of the Senator himself, who is too much of a caricature.  Milo O'Shea brings a poignancy to the key Matchmaker role that could have easily sunk into a stereotype.
This film has some very funny moments, with one of the best being a desperate car ride by O'Hara and his brother, both sporting full leg casts and trying in vain to pilot a stick shift.
All in all, you could do worse than to spend a couple of hours with ""The Matchmaker"".  It left me smiling, as well as wanting to see more of O'Hara in future lead roles.",1010793600,15,1247,4.528888888888889

The scene with her riding in the bus and entering the town for the first time is a riot.  Watch for Dennis Leary's reaction when he hears that the Senator is going to marry a ""Kennedy"". This is a great little film.  But I'm a sucker for small Irish films.  Try ""Hear My Song"" and of course ""Waking Ned Devine"".",997747200,2,442,4.2023809523809526

There is actually a town with a festival similar to the movie's Tullymore-- Lisdoonvarna, on the West coast of the Island is know for its hot springs and annual matchmaking festival.  This movie just does a wonderful job!  The feuding pub-owning brothers, the fight for the raven-haired Janeane by the horny locals, the American politician looking into his non-existent Irish roots, the never-in-a-rush Irish lifestyle, and, of course, the absolutely gogeous Ms. Janeane Garafolo!

I think this may be one of the best romantic comedies ever; the interplay between Janeane and David O'Hara is priceless, the setting is simply stunning, and the supporting cast (particularly Miles O'Shea as the titular character) are all excellent.  Good writing, good direction, well acted, great movie.  My only question to the studio (to echo a common lament): why no soundtrack?",982368000,2,595,4.94

The fresh (for American movies, at least) setting in rural Ireland was good, and Ms. Garofalo made the movie work with her smarts and pluck.  The plot is formulaic and nothing special, but the stereotypes of the crusty old Irish people were fun to watch, and the up-and-down romance between the leads was enough to pull the movie forward.  I can't in good conscience give this modest feel-good flick more than three stars, but the movie did give me the warm fuzzies at times.

She arrived at the village at the perfect time for The  Matchmaking Festival. Marcy met a local man, Sean, played by David O Hara  and sparks were coming between them.
I enjoy the whole movie. It was  funny from the start. Try to imagine two guys, both were suffering a broken  leg which made both of their left legs on cast, trying to work together to  drive a car on an empty Ireland road. Hilarious!

I recommend this to anyone who loves romantic comedies and is sick of Meg  Ryan. I only give one warning: the ""f"" word is used, and used  often (because that's the way people speak--HELLO!), but it may offend some  folks (it did my former inlaws), so we're probably pointing at late baby-boomers  and early Generation X'rs for this one.

If you are not a romantic or a comedy kind of person you sould get it for  just the location.  It was actullaly filmed in Ireland. A place I now  believe to be the most beautiful places.  And if all this don't make you  won't to buy this the music is also excellent. I just wish they had made a  soundtrack.

The only role that stands out in my mind is her breakout performance in Reality Bites.  In Matchmaker,  she seems like a square peg trying to fit into a round hole.  The look on  her face in most of the scenes is like ""What the hell am I doing in  Ireland?"".  This is not a hip, cutting edge movie which janine belongs  in.  She needs to appeal to her fan base and do something more avante-garde  and ""important""!  The Matchmaker is a ""feel good  movie"".  Janine?!?  Throw us a bone here!

7877133,2,6304766742,"An inept script relying on overly broad jokes wastes the cast of this rom-com set in the west of Ireland. I expected better, but within 15 minutes I knew this movie was going to be a colossal let-down.  Rarely does a movie draw attention to its EDITING, of all things, yet the edits in this are so mistimed and awkward they were crying to be noticed and condemned.  The director shares the blame, he approves the final cut (typically).  Quite a lot of production people failed to deliver, in fact. The intrusive (and bad)  music score is mixed so LOUD you can't hear the dialogue or anything else when it's on, which is way too often.  The wardrobe dept. dressed Garafalo is some of the worst and dowdiest outfits I've ever seen a leading lady imprisoned in -- for most of the movie, she wears the same outfit that looks three sizes too big and shrinks her to the size of a ... dare I say... leprechaun.

Garafalo is a funny gal (check her out in the criminally underrated ""Mystery Men"") but her lines give her nothing interesting to say amid a plot that is thin and tenuous at best, even for a painfully  forumulaic fish-out-of-water rom-com like this one.  She spends a lot of time just acting aggravated.  Most of the Irish leads are tiresome in their overblown heartiness or abrasiveness (I should hope most  Irish people are not this ugly, rude,  or thick-headed) apart from journey(wo)man Maria Doyle Kennedy and old vet Milo O'Shea, who are only lumbered with stock Irish stereotype roles and not outright offensive ones.  There is a phenomenal amount of swears in the film as well, something that surprised me, since the level of casual hostility and cussing from Americans and Irish, men and women alike  really dampens or undercuts any light-hearted atmosphere or sweet talk.  I felt I was back in high school among the louts and rif-raff.  Ochone, ochone!  Did all the nice Irish get sent to Australia?",1512259200,,1913,4.648809523809524
