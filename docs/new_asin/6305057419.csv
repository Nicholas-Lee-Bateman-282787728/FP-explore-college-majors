8324572,4,6305057419,If your a Tomiki Aikidoka then this video is a good reference.  The video demonstrates a variety of the koryu techniques and then comments on the subtleties of the techniques.,1004400000,,175,4.833333333333333
8324573,1,6305057419,"It was the worst instructional video I have ever seen.  The camera used was of the poorest sort, probably a personal handycam.  The entire video mostly showed the head Sensei going through forms in rapid succession, that is it!  No insight into proper form, no helpful hints, nothing about how to properly hold the attackers hand when doing certain moves.  All in all about the same as watching an Aikido demonstration from a distance. Save your money",985737600,9,451,4.818181818181818
8324574,5,6305057419,"This video is a great source for all Tomiki Aikido students wishing to learn the Koryu no Kata.  This video covers Koryu Katas 1,2,4,5 all of which are shown full speed, and slow motion with complete naration by Loi  Sensei.  I feel that this video would be a great asset for any aikidoka as  this video shows the similarities between Tomiki aikido and traditional  aikido.",951955200,16,373,4.676923076923077
