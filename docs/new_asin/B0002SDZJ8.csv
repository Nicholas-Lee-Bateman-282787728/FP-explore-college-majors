8457108,1,B0002SDZJ8,"We've used a dozen instructional videos as we've been learning ballrom dancing, and this one is by far the worst.  It is low budget with very little detail and lots of confusion.  The Nancy Hays dance videos are still the best.",1135641600,14,227,4.512195121951219
8457109,1,B0002SDZJ8,"My fiance and I are taking dance lessons to prepare for our wedding and borrowed this DVD from our public library to supplement our practices.  I am so glad we didn't buy it!  I wholeheartedly agree with the other review--the instruction is confusing at best and the segments of each dance are very short.  If you try it, you need to have your own music to practice with, as there isn't much on the DVD.

Overall, we are disappointed and will be returning the DVD as soon as we can get back to the library!",1121990400,16,506,4.294736842105263
8457110,1,B0002SDZJ8,"I am just beginning to learn ballroom, and have had a few lessons and watched another one of the DVD's available (which was much better than this one). This DVD holds out the promise of teaching a person the basics of several ballroom dances. What it delivers is a sequence of home-quality videos of confusingly conducted dancing class sessions.  There are two instructors(a man and a woman) and several student couples.  The two instructors do attempt to explain the very basic foot moves for Cha Cha, Samba, Fox Trot, Waltz, and Quick Step, but in a most confusing fashion.  They talk over and interrrupt each other, so that their verbal instructions are almost impossible to follow, and the demonstrations are very brief.  The students in the class do not seem to be getting it very well either.  The segments are amateurishly produced, but are connected by very brief clips of some apparently professional dancers, with no relationship to the instruction being presented.  It is hard to believe that a person could learn much about ballroom dancing by watching this DVD.",1117065600,25,1074,4.938888888888889
