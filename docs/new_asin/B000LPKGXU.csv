did not even try to return it. I had been looking for this particular vacation
bible school material for  a long time. So, sorry, I don't think it is
particularly the vendor's fault as my own videocassettes just go south
also.",1314230400,,302,4.592592592592593
8163144,4,B000LPKGXU,"This is part of Gospel Publishing's SonCountry Farm VBS program which taught about the Fruits of the Spirit.  Our church did this program the first year it was available (in the 1990's).  Since then, we have repeated it once or twice plus two of the children who had participated in the class way back when, took it to Uganda on a Mission trip this year. Great Fun.  I hear the publisher is repackaging it and reintroducing the whole thing again for 2008.",1200355200,,455,4.524390243902439
