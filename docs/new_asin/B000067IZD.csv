7963300,1,B000067IZD,"I consider myself somewhat of a connoisseur of bad movies.  I've seen a million of them, lots that I thought were great (in a bad way) and other people hated.  Con Games is one of those movies that is so bad, it's horrible.  It is not a good bad movie.  It is just bad.  It's not even worth watching (despite the 5 star review from the actress/executive producer below that states differently).

My 1 star is for Eric Roberts, who is really the only star in the movie, yet he is not the star.  I seem to remember a couple other familiar faces, but they were barely even in the movie.  The actual star is Tommy Lee Thomas.  A guy who's been framed by a senator and sent to prison (I think that was the plot???).  Tommy Lee Thomas seems to be a guy who got some money/backers together in order to make his crappy movie.  He can not act, and I almost think this movie may have been some kind of money laundering scheme.  However, even with how bad Tommy Lee Thomas was, that could not begin to prepare me for the guy who played the senator.  Holy-freaking-hell!!!  No actor (actor?) has ever made me so furious from his acting as this guy.  I seriously came THIS close to going up and punching him right in the face, through my TV.  I seriously thought about hiring a hit-man (possibly Eric Roberts) to take that guy out, but then I would probably end up in prison most likely, and my cell mate would probably be Tommy Lee Thomas, and then I would have to hang myself due to life's trickery and general boredom.

I warn you, if you happen to watch this movie, do yourself a favor and forward through every scene that Eric Roberts is not a part of.  Even if you happen to see a face you recognize, do not stop until you see Eric Roberts!",1319241600,,1733,4.2317073170731705
7963301,1,B000067IZD,I will admit I purchased this DVD because I was in a hurry and thought it said Tommy Lee Jones.  My mistake but I watched it anyway.  There is NOTHING good about this movie.  The acting is terrible.  Local theater groups would have better actors than these folks.  The guns sounded like pop guns and the lead character was just not believable.  Since the star also produced it and wrote it...no wonder he had the lead.  I'll bet the other guys were all relatives.  Can't imagine finding that many bad actors for one movie.,1219968000,2,522,4.4787234042553195
7963302,2,B000067IZD,"This straight-to-video's modest budget is attested to by the fact that while most of the action is supposed to take place at a large state prison, this prison only seems to house about 12 inmates. The plot is that old but reliable one about a man posing as a prisoner so he can go ""undercover"" and solve a crime. The crime in this case is not especially interesting and it's resolved in much too pat a fashion. However, leading man Tommy Lee Thomas looks good with his shirt off, (though he seems too small to be throwing his weight around), and there's a torture scene, (modeled on the one in ""Lethal Weapon""), in which he's hanged by his wrists and zapped with electric shocks. Mr. Thomas' performance may not be of Oscar caliber but he does know how to yell.",1129248000,4,761,4.442857142857143
7963303,1,B000067IZD,"This movie could've been something, had they gotten some real actors, a script and a director. Well, they didn't, and this movie is an embarassment to mankind.",1097020800,,159,4.925925925925926
7963304,5,B000067IZD,"This is a really great prison film that truly shows what really goes on inside those dark prison walls across the US. The casting and storyline made the film. We were lucky to recruit incredible Eric Roberts,Martin Cove,Matthew Ansara and introducing our Producer, Tommy Lee Thomas who stars and of course, moi as ""Jeanette"" co-starring with Eric Roberts who plays Officer Hopkins. Definitely rent, buy and let it sweep you off into the world of action and intrigue............",1028764800,2,477,5.128205128205129
