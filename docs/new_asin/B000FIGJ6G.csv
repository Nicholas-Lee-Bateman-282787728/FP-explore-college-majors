8122886,5,B000FIGJ6G,The master class is on line and worth looking for into so all these books by David Barrett are worth having and working with!,1416960000,,125,4.25
8122887,5,B000FIGJ6G,"I am currently learning to play the harmonica. David Barrett sometimes repeats himself in different books, but if you follow and repeat what he is repeating teaching, in other words, do it again and again, you WILL become better at playing the harp. I've bought several instructional books on the harmonica, and David Barrett's stuff is very good, I use it. This DVD is also very good, I watch it at least once every week or two, in between the learning-material I get from his books, which I practice daily. The DVD explains well, you know it reinforces what he teaches in his books, and makes it clearer and easier, it brings it all together.",1392508800,2,644,4.608695652173913
