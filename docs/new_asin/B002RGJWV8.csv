8378715,3,B002RGJWV8,"Bought this DVD promarily of the IT coverage.  The quality of the picutures was, in parts, lacking.  My main complaint is, while the photographer was taking his pictures, the cars moved between himself and the sun so the images go black in several places because you're looking at the cars from the shadow side.  Sadly, poor technique results in poor pictures and these can never be recaptured, so we're left with what we have.

Don't know that I'll keep this one around after viewing it a couple times.  It will be heading back to Amazon for resale soon.",1403654400,,555,4.622448979591836
