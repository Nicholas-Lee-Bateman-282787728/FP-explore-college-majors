1888115,5,B00009Q4VT,The team of Mary Tyler Moore and Dick Van Dyke are one that will always provide the best no matter what genre they are performing. A touching story which brings the pain of growing older to view. Strong performances by both!,1268092800,,224,4.487804878048781
1888116,3,B00009Q4VT,"I'm old myself and should have been able to relate to this film.
BUT, dull and uninteresting.  Didn't finish viewing.",1223164800,,117,4.85
1888117,3,B00009Q4VT,"For those of us who find the use of the ""F"" word absolutely hysterical in this award winning play, the actors do a nice job. The ulitmate version of this great play is of course the Jessica Tandy and Hume Cronyn version, which left to the decisions of twenty-something executives will never be released and lost to history. What a shame. If someone can find the old VHS and pirate it, there would be a fortune to be made. Put me down as first in line to buy a copy.",1142640000,13,465,4.177777777777778
1888118,1,B00009Q4VT,"I started out liking this movie.  But I found it to be pointless and offensive.  The language got worse as the show progressed.  Call me a prude if you like, but I don't like dirt messing up a lovely outfit any more than I like dirt that is offensive to my ears.

This movie had no rating as it was made for TV, but the rating would have been R if they had rated it.  The ""F"" word was used more than once and the Lord's name was taken in vain over and over again.

I would have been able to deal with the language if the movie had a point, but I felt it ended with nothing being resolved and no one being changed (even a little).

If you feel comfortable with this type of humor, I would say listen to the other reviews and try it out.  But, if you are like me and don't find foul language to be funny, I would skip this movie.",1116460800,6,827,3.880952380952381
1888119,3,B00009Q4VT,"DVD and MTM do a passable job in the production of The Gin Game, but what was their greatest asset in the old Dick Van Dyke series becomes their Achilles heel here, namely their strong chemistry as a team. I just couldn't get past the feeling that these people had known each other for decades, and knew each other's every quirk. In this show, that gets in the way of the story line that revolves around two elderly strangers getting to know and dislike one another and go through the process of accepting each other (and themselves) for who they are. It's too bad that they picked this particular project for their long-awaited reunion.

I was privileged to see the incomperable Jessica Tandy and Hume Cronyn in the original stage production of this play. Strangely enough, although they also were a team of VERY long standing, they were able to overcome this issue. I understand that a VHS version of that performance is floating around. I strongly recommend seeing that, if you can.",1095984000,17,985,4.69364161849711
1888120,5,B00009Q4VT,"Dick Van Dyke and Mary Tyler Moore team up again in 2003's ""The Gin Game"", a PBS-TV production which had me smiling and laughing out loud for much of its 87-minute running time. But, in addition to some side-splitting dialogue, there are some serious and touching moments as well.
Dick and Mary are a joy to watch together again in this simple story of two elderly residents of an old-folks home, who fill their days and nights by playing Gin Rummy and discussing their lives with each other.
If you're expecting nice, clean, sugar-coated dialogue from these two former television icons, think again.  The script bristles with just about every four-letter word you can imagine.  So you probably won't want to let young children view this movie.
I was quite surprised at the amount of salty language contained here...but pleasantly surprised.  Dick Van Dyke's dialogue seems very ""real"" indeed.  He talks just like you'd expect a crusty old geezer who's been put in a retirement home to talk -- complete with an assortment of expletives that many times had me howling with bursts of laughter.  Dick is hysterical in this film.  But he's also got some good serious moments in the movie as well.
Mary, as always, is also outstanding here too.  And she gets off a few spicy zingers of her own (though not nearly as many as Mr. Van Dyke does).
I was a bit disappointed in the ending.  I would have preferred an additional scene tacked on to the last reel, altering the rather downbeat ending that we get here.  But, even without a ""smiley face"" ending, I still enjoyed this motion picture very much.
It's a tribute to the great acting talents of both of these dynamic performers, especially considering the fact that this entire movie is a ""word play"" between just two individuals, with all the ""action"" being simply the words spoken by these two actors.  Keeping a viewing audience interested in watching two people play cards and talk for nearly an hour-and-a-half is probably no easy task for a playwright or a screenwriter (and accompanying director of such material).  But that's exactly what happens in ""The Gin Game"".  I *was* entirely interested in seeing these two people talk and play cards for nearly ninety minutes.  In fact, as I said earlier, I wish the film had been even longer.  The chemistry that Mr. Van Dyke and Mary Tyler Moore had during their ultra-successful and always-entertaining 1960's TV series, ""The Dick Van Dyke Show"" (when they made us laugh regularly as Rob and Laura Petrie), is still very much in evidence in this movie, close to 40 years after Rob and Laura left the air.
The DVD presentation of ""The Gin Game"" looks very good.  We get a nice, sharp anamorphic widescreen picture (in a 1.78:1 ratio), and a quite-ample Dolby Digital 2.0 Stereo soundtrack.  Dick's plentiful expletives come across loud and clear here. (I found myself, in fact, using the reverse scan button on a few occasions in order to replay some of his rather raunchy utterances.)  It's just so funny, in my opinion, hearing the person who played Robert Simpson Petrie cursing like a sailor.  The most profane thing that the TV network censors would ever allow to pass the lips of Mr. Petrie in the 1960s, I think, was ""dog-gone-it"".  LOL!  :)
Play ""The Gin Game"" (using your DVD Player).  It's a game I'll be playing many times I'm sure.",1075680000,14,3341,4.7456747404844295
1888131,5,B00009Q4VT,"I love this story. I have read it twice and own the video (Also purchased from Amazon)  I am planning to go to the BarterTheatre, in Abbingdon Va this summer to see the live play. It helps your enjoyment level if you have actually played ""The Gin Game""!",1365465600,,253,4.270833333333333
1888132,5,B00009Q4VT,Two great actors in a movie. This movie caught me off guard in the end. Dick Van Dyke really played a new role which he did well. Mary Tyler Moore also did a great job. I am glad Amazon had this in stock. I wouldn't have found this in the stores.,1364860800,,246,3.843137254901961
1888133,4,B00009Q4VT,"Ordered the dvd because of great admiration of Van Dyke and Moore; thinking any movie starring those two had to be worth watching.  It was entertaining in a depressing way; I guess mainly due to the setting and realizing that it was too close to  reality for many seniors.  And, yes, the language was a little harsh but that seems to be close to norm nowadays.",1362787200,,360,4.424242424242424
1888134,4,B00009Q4VT,"I enjoyed the story of these 2 people getting to know each other and having to deal with old age, assisted living and losing your mind - slightly... Not the ending I had hoped for but interesting enough as it is the famous actors DVD and MTM.",1361836800,,242,4.170212765957447
1888135,5,B00009Q4VT,Never saw this one - originally saw Jessica Tandy and Hume Cronin do it.  This version is wonderful and so great to see Dick VanDyke and Mary Tyler Moore show what a wonderful pair they are in a serious role.  Sad ending but a great story of seniors who have been put away by their families.,1361750400,,291,4.178571428571429
1888136,5,B00009Q4VT,Very nice item. Would recommend this to others.  Pleased and can not wait to start watching it and sharing it with others.,1361232000,,122,4.545454545454546
1888137,3,B00009Q4VT,I love Dick Van Dyke but this is NOT his best movie. It is boring actually and all he does is curse though out the whole movie--which really didn't add to the movie at all.  The ending was a disappointment also. It will go in with the collection of other movies by him but I won't watch it again.,1354147200,,296,4.016949152542373
1888138,3,B00009Q4VT,"Saw on Broadway with Hume Cronyn and Jessica Tandy.  Not since.  This did not seem like the same, but then it's been a long time.  This was ok but more surly and antagonistic than I remembered.  Lots of swearing and posturing by Van Dyke.  Not the comedy I remembered.",1350345600,,268,4.387755102040816
1888139,3,B00009Q4VT,"This was a very good play with Dick Van Dyke & Mary Tyler Moore, but I really wish you could find a DVD of the play with Hume & Jessica as the players. They were the best!!! It was on Video Tape but someone should come out with a DVD!!!!",1342828800,2,237,3.76
1888140,5,B00009Q4VT,I originally saw most of this play on screen a few years ago on PBS. I was delighted to find that it was released on DVD. Dick Van Dyke and Mary Tyler Moore are superb in this intimate drama of two elderly people in a nursing home who become acquainted with one another through playing gin together. It was originally a play and it is a play on film. I highly recommend this DVD for anyone who enjoys a good play on film.,1337299200,,421,4.0843373493975905
7992461,3,B00009Q4VT,"Great acting, was what was the point of this play?  It just goes downhill.  I kept hoping they'd both see the humour in how silly they were being, but they just got sucked into the downward spiral 'cause they let it happen to themselves.",1498003200,,237,4.363636363636363
7992462,2,B00009Q4VT,"I WAS A GIFT FROM A FAMILY MEMBER WHO HAD HEARD ME TALKING ABOUT HOW WELL IT WAS PERFORMED. HOWEVER, THE PRODUCTION I WATCHED WAS HUME CROWNON AND JESSICA TANDY AND IT WAS BEAUTIFULLY DONE. THIS VERSION IS NOT NEARLY AS ENGAGING.",1494374400,,229,4.476190476190476
7992463,3,B00009Q4VT,"D.L. Coburn's 1976 play suffers here from it's own apparent weaknesses.  Starting out strong, you'll likely be impressed and enjoy the two star's interaction.  The story really goes downhill in the last third, leaving us with a pointless non-ending.  Moore and Van Dyke were more than game, but couldn't sell the downhill ending.  Again, I think the fault lies with the play itself.

I'd like to see the earlier Cronyn & Tandy version.",1464566400,,435,4.904109589041096
7992464,5,B00009Q4VT,Great acting but a sad story.,1434240000,,29,4.0
7992465,5,B00009Q4VT,since I could not afford to pay nearly $500 for the original Gin Game with Jessica Tandy I decided to try the remake and was delighted that the script stayed the same. I watched it years ago and thought it was the most powerful two person play ever written. So I am very pleased with the new remake .,1431907200,,300,4.101694915254237
7992466,4,B00009Q4VT,"Really more a filmed theatrical staging for television, than a true film per se, this two-hander is solidly acted by Dick Van Dyke and Mary Tyler Moore.

They play two very different - if equally lonely - types in an old age home: the extroverted, gregarious, but also somewhat volatile and misanthropic Weller and the introverted, prim Fonisa. They form a friendship over games of gin, which she has an uncanny knack for winning, even though she is a complete novice to the game, which pushes Weller's buttons since he likes to fancy himself an expert.

In this production at least, the play feels sweet, funny, well written and occasionally touching, but also a bit familiar. And the characters' secrets aren't very surprising given the build up to their inevitable reveals.

But, that said, it can often invoke a smile, and the ending was surprisingly touching without resorting to the obvious or unsubtle.

While I didn't see the original production starring Hume Cronyn and Jessica Tandy, and directed by Mike Nichols, certainly the reviews I could find make it sound like that represented a somewhat darker, more complex approach to the play and the characters, which I could imagine giving the whole thing more heft and power. And it's interesting to see how many who saw both productions found Van Dyke and Moore a bit too 'nice'.  While this version never quite turned 'cute' it threatened to at moments.

But in the end, it was still fun to see these two excellent old pros go at it, and I was never bored or less than interested.",1430265600,,1540,4.7706766917293235
7992467,3,B00009Q4VT,"After seeing The Gin Game with Hume Chrome and Jessica Tandy, this is a disappointment.  They were a hard act to follow.",1428624000,,120,4.454545454545454
7992468,5,B00009Q4VT,Humor and reality mix.,1426464000,,22,4.75
7992469,3,B00009Q4VT,OK - but not near as good as the original cast of Hume Cronin and Jessica Tandy.  Dick Van Dyke was a little too nice for my taste.,1419292800,,131,3.6785714285714284
7992470,5,B00009Q4VT,"Dick Vandyke and Mary Tyler Moore are a terrific pair to do the remake of the Fabulous Gin Game.
Our family thoroughly enjoy this tremendous Play.",1375401600,,146,4.653846153846154
