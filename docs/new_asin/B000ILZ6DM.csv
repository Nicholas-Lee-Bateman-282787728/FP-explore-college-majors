2659086,4,B000ILZ6DM,I have just started bowling with a fingertip ball and wanted some instruction on how to release the ball.  This did not cover that but it was a help on approach and picking up spares.,1217203200,2,183,4.228571428571429
2659087,5,B000ILZ6DM,"This DVD is extremely well-done, with detailed discussions of equipment, physical/mental preparation, ball delivery, reading & adjusting to lanes, and making spares.  Parker Bohn's presentation style is also excellent -- very clear, relaxed, and engaging.

Equipment discussions have useful information for everyone from beginner to expert, and cover everything from proper fit for a ball (whether conventional grip, semi-fingertip, or full fingertip), shoes, peripheral/extra equipment (e.g., finger inserts, wrist supports, tape, rosin bags, etc.).

The spare-making section was especially well-done, and includes very detailed diagrams, discussions, and demonstrations for all the common leaves.  Importantly, this is shown for both left-handers (by Parker Bohn III) and for right-handers (by Brad Angelo).

Also valuable were the ""fireside chats"" between Angelo and Bohn, during which they discussed many things they have learned over the years that have made the biggest difference to them.

I absolutely recommend this DVD to bowlers of all skill levels, whether you're just starting out, or have been carrying a 200 average for years - there's something in here for everyone.",1203292800,22,1182,5.843023255813954

8146210,1,B000ILZ6DM,"This video is very poor.  Parker and Brad say a lot of words, but really do not convey much information.  In most respects, the only way you would understand what they are talking about is if you already knew the information.

This is not beyond bowling basics.  It is all about bowling basics.  The title is all wrong.  What makes it worse is that they do a poor job of explaining what they are talking about.  Hence what I meant by a lot of talking  but no information.  They tell you what you need to do, but not how to do it!

I am very sorry that I spent the money and time on this video.  Save your money and pass this one by.

8146211,3,B000ILZ6DM,"You know this was rather disappointing for me.  I have Parker's great book, Bowling.  What I was looking for from this tape was actual bowling techniques, like the bowling release and the reaction it would give you as a left hander. As everyone know, all the tapes are for right handers that the lefty has to visualize.  I thought their were too much, ""sit down"" talking.  The only real ""bowling"" lesson was making spares. Which actually, is covered well in his Bowling book.  So all in all if you need help in others areas, as a lefty, this is not a good or excellent book.  If you really need help in spare shooting I can get that on YouTube.",1418774400,,644,4.369747899159663

8146213,3,B000ILZ6DM,"The book was okay for beginners,but I expected it to be for more advance bowlers because the title insinuates it is beyond basics.",1363046400,,130,4.695652173913044
8146214,5,B000ILZ6DM,I purchased this book b/c I am a left handed bowler like parker bohn the 3rd. it taught me alot i would recommend this book to all left handed bowlers.,1353715200,,151,4.066666666666666
8146215,5,B000ILZ6DM,"It gives you the confidence to work with the drills they give you, sparing has always been where the scores are made, and Parker shows how spares are made. Excellent  DVD a must for any bowler at any level.",1350604800,,206,4.282051282051282
8146216,4,B000ILZ6DM,"Back to bowling after a long time. Needed to learn it all over again. This DVD was a great starting point. Now I'm taking a few private lessons,but I still refer to the DVD. Worth the money.",1343347200,,190,4.162162162162162
8146217,2,B000ILZ6DM,"This DVD was well done, but mistitled. It starts with the three types of grips, and that if you are a serious bowler, you may want to get your own shoes. It doesn't get any more basic than that. There was NO discussion of throwing a strike ball, Lane reading or lane breakdown. No mention of adjustments, ball selection, or proper angle to the pocket. I would only recommend this DVD to very young or new bowlers that have no clue about the game.",1232582400,12,446,4.321428571428571
