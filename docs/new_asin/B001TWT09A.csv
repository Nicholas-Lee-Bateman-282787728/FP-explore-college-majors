With all the inappropriate stuff out there targeted at kids, it's nice to have shows such as this one we can feel comfortable allowing our children to watch (and even enjoy ourselves!).",1315180800,,314,5.0576923076923075
3794313,5,B001TWT09A,"This is mostly inoffensive, yet very humorous, entertainment. The series isn't just about the antics of the twins, though. Playing an almost as large role in the series is the interaction of the adults, Ray and Lisa, who live under the same roof, but don't like each other. Both aspects of the series can be equally entertaining, even in the same episode.",1297555200,,355,4.741935483870968
3794314,5,B001TWT09A,"I love tv shows i mean i buy them all but why everytime i buy a black series the dvds get the cut up treatment and by that i mean why does sister sister have to have the shows on the dvd not be the entire episode with everything it is ridiculuos and makes no since. the only black series i have that has been superb is the whole collection to the cosby show and that is wonderful but yet sad. Why if a person spend good money to have a show they love with all their heart and want to keep it why does the dvd companies or whoever in charge cheats us and i know they are not the full shows because i recorded every eposides of sister sister from abc to the wb so i know its not the whole show and really all i really wish is that they would stop cheating people cause its not right and i hope family matters step by step and hanging with mr. cooper are released soon on dvd and get the same treatment that the cosby show got. shows on dvd are the best by the way anyone young like me in their 20's should check out the old great series peyton place parts 1 and 2 they are great and i hope the rest of the series is released fast i will go broke for a great show, drama, comedy, anything that is good i love tv, and no you guys that think i only watch tv all day i don't i watch dvd's from 8-10 mon- fri and my weekends are mines but instead of watching tv i watch dvd's that way you can watch a series or drama straight through in two weeks instead of watching all season and year long like i cant wait for the new season of desperatehousewives to come out and brothers and sisters or ugly betty and medium and the new 90210 oh my god that show looks so good and can you believe that the new melrose place is comming to. tv on dvd will be great 2010 and 2011 i can't wait well i hope this is helpful to whoever reads it love ya and take care and remember tv on dvd is in your control i love it bye and god bless never stress",1251676800,,1923,3.8585858585858586
3794315,4,B001TWT09A,"I love Sister, Sister and I love Lisa she is so funny. The thing that brothers me the most is that they cut some stuff from some of the episodes. Like in Operation Deja Vu they cut off at least a minutes worth. I can tell because I had it on tape. Without that stuff it really does not make sense. Everything else is great. I just hope season 3 comes out before 2010.

Oh by the way I can not believe that I have been writing reviews for a whole year. I hope to last longer.",1247616000,2,474,3.88659793814433

The only problem is that they have not released the rest of the seasons, which is very dissapointing. The show got even better as the girls got older and went to college. I would really like to know why they have not released the rest of the seasons yet.",1387497600,,384,4.133333333333334

3794324,5,B001TWT09A,I love this series so much..I would really like to know why the remaining seasons have not been released. I've been waiting about 2 years for the rest to come out and they haven't :( It's an awesome show and there is no point releasing the first two seasons without the rest. Other shows that are not even half as good have been released on DVD. If anyone has any news on if these are going to be released please let me know!!!,1347321600,7,427,4.156626506024097
3794325,5,B001TWT09A,"I used to watch Sister Sister all the time in high school, and it often made my day.  It went off the air the same year I went off to college, so this is the first time I've seen it in nearly a decade.  Season 2 is one of my favorite seasons from the series.  The show got off to a great start in its 12 Season 1 episodes (also available on DVD), and then started rocking and rolling from that point on.

Despite the obscure premise--of Tia and Tamera (playing themselves) acting as twins separated at birth, adopted, and reunited 14 years later in a department store--Sister Sister does an outstanding job of portraying life through the eyes of an adolescent girl with utmost depth, sincerity, warmth, humor, wit, honesty, and sensitivity--free of drama and sex.  Tia and Tamera play their parts to perfection, and do a pretty good job of narrating the episodes while developing a relationship with their audience.  Their adoptive parents (Tim Reid as Tamera's father, Ray Campbell; Jackee Harry as Tia's mother, Lisa Landry) add the perfect touch as two polar opposite role models (both with good intentions and values) who are forced to live together more-or-less against their own will for the sake of their daughters' sisterhood.  And Roger Evans (played by Marques Houston) will simply do anything to get his hands on the love(s) of his life--failing every time!

Highlights from Season 2 include: It's A Party Thang (when the twins throw a party in an effort to gain peer popularity--with unanticipated results); Put To The Test (Tia and Tamera take their SATs, and Roger stands up to two bullies--both with unanticipated results); Get A Job (the girls juggle two jobs--working for Ray's limo service, and the local fast food joint, Rocket Burger, before ultimately choosing the latter); Joey's Choice (a boy customer at Rocket Burger inadvertently asks both girls out simultaneously, erstwhile Lisa develops a crush on-, and starts a season-long relationship with-, their local grocery store [Food Boy] Manager, Terrence Winningham); Playing Hooky (Lisa and the girls play hooky to relieve themselves of test pressure, before being caught).

All in all, a definite TV treasure for the entire family.  Highly recommended for adults and kids alike!",1339027200,2,2254,4.986666666666666
3794326,3,B001TWT09A,I would like to know if anyone else who owns this DVD has experienced the same problem I have.  2 or 3 of the episodes that I have viewed so far are not sharp for DVDs.  I'm not sure how to describe it exactly.  There is a shadow like image on one side of the characters and objects in the picture.  It's really annoying because it's on my favorite episode with Merlin Santana.  I would give this a better rating if it weren't for that.  I want to know if my DVD is defective and I need to return it or if they are all like that.,1331337600,,529,3.897196261682243
3794327,4,B001TWT09A,"This item was shiped in a timely manner, however it was shipped via USPS, and they wouldn't leave it at my door, for some unknown reason, so I had to pick it up at the post office.

The problem is that I don't own a car, making it difficult to get to the post office. I wish a different service had been used, because it was almost a week after it was delivered that I was able to arrange for a ride to take me to pick it up. I order things online because I don't have the means to get to places that might carry the product.

When I finally got the item, I watched it almost immediately. There are a few plastic clips inside of the DVD box which hold the slabs that the DVD's are places onto. One of those clips was broken and was scraping against the DVD backs, and one of the disks had come undone, so an episode on disk two has a number of jump cuts because of the scratches, and I had the skip the episode entirely.

Thankfully, my love of this show saved the two problems with delivery.",1327622400,,992,4.025380710659898
