8701131,5,B00TAEF32M,"I bought this DVD from another site so I won't show as a verified purchaser. I buy all of Amy Hesketh's films and enjoy all of them so I'm biased. The vampire theme is interesting but, as in most of the other Amy Hesketh and Jac Avila collaborations, the plot is just a vehicle to get Amy out of her clothes and then do a variety of nasty things to her. Torture type things, not sexual things. There is a rape scene but it appears as if Jac forgot to take his pill. Nevertheless Amy gets tied naked to the four corners of the bed and there's some whipping. Light by Amy's standards anyway but she nevertheless rises to the occasion. She's not particularly pretty and a bit out of shape now that's she's pushing thirty but she can still perform in this genre like a poor man's Meryl Streep. The final execution scene is the kind of tour de force fans of Amy and Jac are accustomed to. Pitch fork and torch bearing locals capture Amy, find it necessary to strip her, and after a long and convincingly acted scene she perishes. Looking forward to her next film.",1436572800,7,1058,4.321608040201005

8701133,5,B00TAEF32M,"Olalla is a young woman who wants to be more than she is. Her family wants her to conform to their traditions. She is a Vampire. So is her entire family. She wants to live the life of a normal person. But she cannot overcome her need to drink blood. Her family has learned to hide what they are in order to survive, but Olalla is a non-conformist whose differences threaten to expose them all. The film is based on a story by the author of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, Robert Louis Stevenson. Amy Hesketh wrote the screenplay, directed the film, and stars as Olalla. I enjoyed this film and recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good Vampire film.",1424390400,4,641,4.305785123966942
