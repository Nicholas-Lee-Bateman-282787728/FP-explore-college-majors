8325481,5,B000NNGGH0,"My husband grew up with Spurge Golden and Fritz Burkhart as his mentors in the logging industry in SE Alaska in the 1960's and 1970's at Ketchikan Pulp Co. logging camp in Thorne Bay AK (biggest logging camp in the world at that time)
The documentary brought back wonderful memories of the industry and shows how they logged before my husbands time in logging.
Excellent documentary.",1414281600,,383,4.818181818181818
