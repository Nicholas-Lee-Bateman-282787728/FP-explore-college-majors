8705284,5,B00UBZLJ40,"I bought these to teach my children about God and important Bible stories. I wanted to use them to show my children the stories we are reading, and have them come to life.  The videos are high quality and perfect for my 5, 4 and 2 year old. These videos are perfect for parents wanting something other than Veggie Tales Bible stories. We love Veggie Tales, but needed another perspective to watch. My 5 and 4 year old sons keep asking to watch David and Goliath and Noah again and again. I'm very happy I purchased these videos. It gives me a chance to share these beloved stories with my children that I learned about as a child.",1437004800,,630,4.338983050847458
