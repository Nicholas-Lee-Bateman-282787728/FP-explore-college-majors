8163925,5,B000LSA8EE,"I have purchased many karate videos in the past. You often get an unimpressive demonstration of a kata, or if the demonstration is good, the bunkai is lacking.  The demonstration of Arakai Seisan in Patrick McCarthy's video is clear and easy to follow.  However, you get a lot more than that. No defense from a step in lunge punch or front kick in this video.  The applications are brutally effective and cover self defense situations one might actually encounter.  I also like that the knowledge can be transferred to a number of other kata that I know.  Mr. McCarthy also covers some ground technique as well.  Although most people don't want to wind up on the ground, that is precisely where a great many fights do go.  I think it is a good idea to know a little about ground work and this video offers some information that most karate videos simply do not cover.

Besides the technical knowledge, there is some historical material presented that rounds out the presentation. I actually wish there was more historical information. I want to see more videos like this on the market.",1304985600,,1085,4.703703703703703
8163926,5,B000LSA8EE,"I was very pleased with Sensei McCarthy's DVD presentation. In fact, I have gone on to purchase them all, I thought that much of them.

In addition to the kata itself being presented in a clear and concise manner, I also appreciated the extra effort that went into the historical overview and especially the old and rare photos. McCarthy's one expert who's been everywhere.

The kata application practices are nothing short of extremely functional and nothing at all like what has been presented elsewhere. Having been to many of his seminars I can personally say that Sensei McCarthy is well known for his kata application practices and two-man drills. There's nothing rule-bound about them, nor is there any fanciful pressure point KO theories as exampled elsewhere. He explores both impact-related and grappling possibilities as functional alternatives in Aragaki's Seisan.

Personally, I believe this man is the leader in this field and highly recommend any and all of his products and publications [especially the Bubishi]. You'll be happy you did.",1186531200,3,1053,5.218934911242603
8163927,2,B000LSA8EE,"I thought I was buying a dvd on Aragaki Seisan and its applications.
What I bought was about 2/3rds of a dvd on this topic - the other ~1/3 is taken up with filler of one kind or another.

As for the parts that did pertain to the Seisan kata, the initial sequences of each application are good - I had no idea Aragaki Seisan borrowed so many applications from Taiji - most interesting.

However,  McCarthy should have kept each sequence shorter and simpler, quickly dispatching the attacker. Instead, the applications are extended several steps frequently leading to some kind of groundwork.  I believe strongly that this is a very unwise approach. The last thing I want to do in a real fight is to be on the ground using my body as a rope to tie up a bad person while their friends come up and kick my head in.

If I wanted a dvd on martial arts history or pictures of McCarthy mugging with his instructors, I would have bought one that advertised being such.  This is NOT what I wanted nor is it what I was expecting - but that's what a significant part of this disc is.  I don't know if McCarthy's other discs have the same faults or not, but based on this one I probably won't bother to find out.",1183680000,3,1200,4.283185840707965
