1885218,1,B00009MEJS,"My toddler likes it. Her older brother hated it when he was of the appropriate age. But this adult finds it deadly dull to the point of painful. It's the only video of Thomas tank we ever bought, and it will be the last.

The DVD user interface is inexcusable. You have to sit through a LONG introduction before it lets you make a selection. The first time might be cute, the 50th time is enough to put a harried parent over the edge. If you pick the music, you don't get music, you get another menu screen requiring another button to  be pressed. When the DVD is done, it defaults to some meaningless screen, not the menu page.  To me, the lack of user-friendly interface is a deal breaker.",1173571200,4,691,4.3
1885219,5,B00009MEJS,"James And The Red Balloon has to be the best Thomas video I've seen in a long time. All the stories were great and they mostly taught the lesson of, Don't Judge A Book By It's Cover. The stories are very entertaining and funny too. Here they are:

James And The Red Balloon 5/5:
Thomas takes a hot air balloon and is very excited to see it take off into the sky. But James arrives and is afraid that the balloon will take away all there passengers. Now Thomas is not so excited anymore after what James had said, is James right? Find out in this story.

Twin Trouble 4.5/5:
Donald & Douglas do pretty much everything together. But when they both get in an accident, Donald blames Douglas and says that he pushed him into the hay wagon. So the twins refuse to talk to each other and Donald goes to work somewhere else. But the twins soon start to miss each other.

Edward The Really Useful Engine 4.5/5:
All the big engines say that Edward is too old and needs to be retired. The news soon spreads to Sir Topham Hatt who immediately sends Edward away to help Stepney. But when Gordon stops on his hill, who should come and help him?

The World's Strongest Engine 6/5:
Henry gets sent to the repairs after an accident with some freight cars and the only engine available to fill in Henry's spot is Diesel. Diesel is up to his no good tricks again, this time he wants to prove that he is the world's strongest engine
by pulling all the freight cars at once. But his trick backfires on him and he ends up in a sticky situation, where the true world's strongest must pull away all the cars.

Rusty Saves The Day 4/5:
Sir Topham Hatt closes down Skarloey and Rheneas' line due to the bad condition of it. Then Sir Topham Hatt closes the Quarry for 2 weeks because they are blasting there. Rusty uses this time to repair Skarloey and Rheneas' railway, but the engines find out that it will take longer than expected. Can they fix it in time?

Dunkin' Duncan 5/5:
Duncan gets to careless at the inclined railway and ends up in a embarressing situation where he'll have Sir Topham Hatt to deal with.

""Down By The Docks""(Music Video)5/5:
A very catchy song about the docks, gateway to the sea.

Again, great Thomas video, I guarantee that you will like it too. I hope my review has been helpful. :)",1095552000,11,2289,4.356807511737089

1885221,5,B00009MEJS,"This is my eighth or ninth Thomas review on Amazon and most of those times I crizied the new tapes. This tape however was a very nice and a good addition to our collection. My little sister loves Diesel and there aren't many tapes starring him however. This tape I feel confident saying i'm glad we bought this. Anyway in James and the Red Balloon Thomas brings a hot air balloon that takes villagers around the island. James however thinks the balloon is going to take their passengers away. I won't reveal anymore this was a good one. In Twin Trouble Donald and Douglas are fighting and it causes confusion and delay. In Edward the Really Useful Engine Gordon says that Edward is useless and he should be retired so Sir Topam Hatt tells Edward to help Stepney but he has to be a back engine for two trains. In the World's Strongest Engine Henry has an accident and Diesel has to help them but he can't help boasting.
In Rusty Saves the Day Rheneas and Skarloey's line is closed because it is too hard to clean up and Rusty tries to help them fix it. In Dunkin Duncan Rusty Rheneas and Skarloey help Duncan at the inclined railway but he is rude, careless, and bossy. This tape is a must buy on video or Dvd",1066608000,8,1208,4.349557522123894
