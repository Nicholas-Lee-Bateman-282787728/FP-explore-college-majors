1062391,5,6305729212,"In the opening of her film, Daughters of the Dust, Julie Dash alerts the viewer that this is no ordinary African American story.  Conversely, this is an American history lesson with African origins. A small informative note at the start of the film puts the entire movie in context.  Without this explanatory foreword, many viewers would probably find the film hard to understand.  Though the movie tells the story of the Peazant family's migration from the sea islands of the South, the story also gives a panoramic view of the Gullah culture at-large.  Because the islands are isolated from the mainland states, the Gullah retain a distinct African ethnicity and culture.  Ironically, the Peazants want to rid themselves of the old ways and heritage, thus beginning an exodus from the islands to the mainland.  Taking place in 1902, just fifty years after the end of slavery, Daughter of the Dust explores the Peazant's struggle for survival and escape from poverty.  The movie opens on the eve of the family's great migration to the mainland.  A family celebration and farewell-of-sorts take place on the beach.  The Peazants even hire a photographer to document this momentous occasion.  As the movie progresses, the complexity of the family's departure from the island emerges.  Difference and changing values mire the pending migration with conflict and strife.  As the family prepares to leave, in search of a new life and better future, the film reveals the richness of the Gullah heritage.  Narrations of ""the unborn child"" of Eli and Eula Peazant offer glimpses into problems the family has faced since their existence on the island.  As explained by matriarch Nana Peazant, the Gullah are  like ""two people in one body.""  Though most Peazants were born in the Americas,  their African heritage is forever evident. The internal conflicts of this duality haunt the family as they become ensnarled in battle, only to war against themselves.  Through old African customs and rituals, such as glass bottle trees, salt water baths, and herb potions, Nana wants to ensure that the family stays together.  Moreover, Nana, ""the last of the old,""  has chosen to stay on the island.  She celebrates everything that makes her who she is: the ugly and the good.  She  knows slavery and she knows freedom.  Her  life revolves around the continuation and strengthening of the Peazant family.  Her rituals are often unappreciated and looked upon with scorn by other family members.  Some family members are unwilling to grasp Nana's teachings and wisdom.  They want to escape the island, to run away from the Gullah way of life.  However, they cannot run from themselves.  Just as Nana proclaims, they will always live a double life, no matter where they go.  The trip to the mainland certainly cannot rid their indigo stained hands of its blue-blackish tint.  Nor can the northern journey erase the memories of whom or what they are leaving.  Unbeknownst to the younger Peazants, the duality, the recollections and remembrances,  and the old way and traditions are gifts from their ancestors.  Sadly, few are able to accept these gifts or comprehend their importance.  Through authentic Gullah dialect, vivid imagery and colorful characters,  Dash reveals the uniqueness of the Gullah people.  A cousin, Yellow Mary, returns from Cuba to the island, facing the scorn of her people because she is a  ""ruint `oman.""  Haggar, a bitter woman who wants nothing to do with the old Gullah ways, does  not realize that she cannot rid herself of whom she is.  For example, she despises the ""old Africans,"" yet retains their ways in her speech and use of African colloquialisms.  Another cousin,  Viola is full of Christian religious fervor and against the heathen practices and nature-worshiping traditions of her people.  Eula, who gives a heart- wrenching soliloquy at the end of the movie,  bears the burden of pregnancy and rape by a white man.  Eli, Eula's husband, represents the strength and future of the Peazant clan.  Besides being adept at character development,  Julie Dash effectively  educates the viewer about African-American history.  Tales of flying Africans, water-walking Ibo, Islamic religion, and slave trading are skillfully woven in small snatches throughout the film.  We also see connections between African-Americans and  Native Americans. The lessons learned from this film are too numerous.  One must see the film more than once to appreciate all the information presented.  Daughters of the Dust awakens all the senses.  The beautiful cinematography transports viewers to a surreal place and time, creating a visual paradise.  Each scene makes its introduction with mesmerizing African  music, which aptly fits each setting.  As the Gullah women prepare food for the feast, one cannot help but imagine the taste and smell of gumbo, shrimp, and crab.  This movie also arouses the heart. One can easily identify and empathize with the characters'  passion and sincerity. Often, the characters relay sentiments and convictions so convincingly, that it is hard to believe that the players were acting.  Understanding complete passages is often difficult because of  the beautiful and authentic tonality of the language.  Nonetheless, the use of standard English could not have conveyed Dash's message as successfully.  We should appreciate this film for its originality and courage.  Stories such as these are hardly ever told.  Most films  neglect the eclectic nature of the African American community, usually focusing on only aspects that are familiar to the masses. Here, Julie Dash reaches beyond  the  boundaries that are set for African-American films.  Equally as important is her ability and willingness to validate the African-American experience.  She eloquently and subtly deals with difficult subjects such as slavery, self-hatred, feminism, color prejudices, and rape.  Dash does not throw one viewpoint in your face.  Conversely, Dash gives the viewer a front row seat into the lives of a remarkable people.  We are then left to draw conclusions for ourselves.  One feels liberated, proud, and honored to be allowed a window into their lives.  The movie is a celebration of the African-American  diaspora. The images, language, and music of Daughters of the Dustwill linger in the minds of its fortunate viewers forever.",985564800,125,6348,5.196640316205533

1062556,5,6305729212,"Kudos to Richard Brody of The New Yorker for bringing this lovely, brilliant gem to my attention.  I can't surpass the perceptiveness and eloquence of his reviews (four separate articles!), but could not keep my opinion to myself.  This is a surpassingly beautiful movie - as lovely, atmospheric, dreamy, and textured as any Terrence Malick film, and told as much in terms of *setting* as any of them; with the difference that the characters here are not socially or spiritually adrift.  While they have mixed feelings about the changes they've made and the changes to come -- especially contending matriarchs with abrasive (and generational) differences of religion -- they are a solid and venerable community, blessed rather than cursed by their relative isolation.

As Brody writes, writer-director-producer Julie Dash ""turns one familys experience of the Great Migration into a vast mythopoetic adventure,"" which at this level deserves comparison with The Fast Runner.  This is a feast for the senses -- the wind and surf that sound throughout the film, except when overtaken by a gorgeous music score; the almost continuous placement of action outdoors on this Southern island, amid sand, palms, exuberant foliage and flowers; the perfect eye for casting, with many different faces, skin colors, variations in accent, dress; if I add prosperity, personality and character, it would seem the faux pas of taking human beings for exotics -- but I would refer to their appeal to our sense of the breadth of this little, and little-known, society; its resonance with all the world's more ancient and grandiose tales of self-conscious communities, with their tensions between a tumultuous, war-begotten past that gives them much of their self-understanding, and a seemingly necessary future change not clearly revealed in the light of it -- and I would refer to how the work and dance and play and confrontations and ceremonies of the generations here are brought to life -- ecstatic, wistful, painful and anguished -- by a dynamic, superbly-chosen cast.

The other and more obvious difference with Terrence Malick is that Julie Dash's mastery went unrecognized and unrewarded for twenty-five years.  Please treat yourself to something VERY special: an old tale told in such unfamiliar terms that it feels completely new; and add your contribution to reversing Ms. Dash's cinematic fortunes.  May her name go down in history after a renewed and brilliant career.",1494547200,4,2461,5.244274809160306

1062558,2,6305729212,I really wanted to like this film but I simply couldn't follow the story. The closed captioning was not timed correctly so it was difficult to understand the dialog.

1062560,4,6305729212,"Daughters of the Dust,"" set in 1902, focuses on the members of the multi-generational Peazant family of the Gullah community in the Sea Islands off the coast of South Carolina  former West African slaves who adopted many of their ancestors Yoruba traditions as they struggle to maintain their cultural heritage and folklore while planning to migrate to the mainland. On the eve of their departure, an extended family picnic and ritual farewell is arranged, even as a clan elder works to keep the family together and pass on the knowledge of their ancestors as they move ever further from their roots.

Because of their isolated location, the Sea Islands kept alive much more of African mores and folkways far longer than anyplace else in the American South. On the islands, descendants of slaves evolved not only a unique patois but also Africa-derived myths, herbal potions, burial customs, and games. By the beginning of the 20th century, however, this close-knit society, represented in the movie by matriarch Nana Peasant (Cora Lee Day) and her clan, was showing signs of breaking up.

The film is interesting sociologically as a look into a fast-disappearing world. Director Julie Dash depicts the clash of past and present with scenes of daily life  unremarkable in their own right, but significant portrayals of a way of life that will soon be gone.

Bonus features on the unrated Blu-ray release include an interview with director Julie Dash, Q & A with Dash and actress Cheryl Bruce at the Chicago International Film Festival, interview with cinematographer Arthur Jafa, audio commentary with director Dash, and a re-release trailer.",1491868800,,1642,5.111940298507463

1062562,5,6305729212,"I saw this enthralling film when it came out years ago, and it was magical for me. A lovely costume drama set in the isolated sea island off America's southern coast in 1902, where change is coming, even here, and the inhabitants traditional way of life is being challenged, as some of the characters prepare to join the Great Migration and go north, sending ripples throughout their community. It is slow-moving but quietly suspenseful, on an emotional level. No car chases or rat a tat tat. You watch characters process their emotions as they mourn the restless desire to move on. And lusciously beautiful cinemogrpahy of a timeless landscape. I waited for the next film by this brilliant director, but it never came. Please sign her up to direct Zora Neale Hurston's biopic, or another costume drama, this time set in 1917 Ireland, anything, because this director has an enthralling cinematic language and you're wasting her. This film is suitable for children, and would expose them to a fascinating piece of American heritage, and  promote interesting discussion.",1479600000,,1068,5.033898305084746

1062625,5,6305729212,"This it is nothing less than an extraordinary film. This has been my favorite film since it was released in the theaters in 1992. I purchased the screenplay (not the novel!), which helped me understand the particular African signs and symbols Julie Dash uses throughout the film. It is a remarkable piece of writing, as well as an exceptional piece of cinematography (the film was made using only available light, hence the colors are warm and rich). This film must be part of everyone's cinematic repertoire. I have studied this film for years, have taught this film to many classes, and have watch the film over 20 times  and yet I find each time I watch this film I see more and more layers of meaning and emotion. If you were looking for a film as dumb and linear as a Hollywood ""classic,"" do not bother with this movie. If you are looking for a film with visual scenes and dialogue that will remain with you and be a part of your dreams, this film is a must.

It is an exploration of the inner and outer turmoil a deeply spiritual family goes through across generations post enslavement.  The characters seem to interact with one another in a surreal and mystical way providing opportunities for reflection and deeper analysis. As you watch the relationships play out, its easy to imagine the ""untold"" stories before and after. Each character weaves in and out like pieces of a never fully finished tapestry or quilt. Each uniquely providing a part of a whole. Yet the movie will create a void which may have you feel feel the wonder of what was and is being lost and will never again be regained in full.  Each generation can only hope to maintain a link and to continue sewing together the missing pieces as circumstances and the winds of change continue to pull them apart.

I am not really sure why,There is a random American Indian guy involved. There is a ""yellow"" girl (They call her yellow) who wears her hat like it's constantly falling off her head, and she never has a moment of dialogue.

My parents left their homeland in the mid-1920's for a ""better life"" and returned to their island home in 1962.  They took their mores with them and raised my 7 siblings and me in New York City, incorporating the values of the mainland US with their West Indian culture.  I later moved to the island of my parents and raised my daughter there. I feel blessed to have both the values of the US mainland and the culture of my West Indian heritage  to share with my daughter, son-in-law and grandchildren.  Daughters of the Dust gives me insight as to how the Peazant family dealt with their desire to move on or to stay in their Sea Island homeland and how my parents and their peers dealt with the same cultural issues.

Although I couldn't understand everything that was said due to the dialect, what stood out to me was the story of Ibo's landing and everyone kissing the Bible and talisman as Nana Peazant held it in her hands.  The young girls in their white flowing dresses, playing on the beach, also stands out as a beautiful scene.

The pride in their African heritage and the hope of a better life in the American mainland permeates the movie.  And what I love most of all is that although it touches on racism (rape, slavery, anti-lynching), it focuses totally on African Americans and a unique culture which developed and was nurtured among the Gullah people. Nana Peazant's warning to her departing family left me in tears.  It's a reminder to all of us that we are to remember our ancestors and their sacrifices and not be ashamed of who we are.

1063090,2,6305729212,"Ah, Daughters of the Dust, the movie we all hate, but pretend, amid of our culturally enlightened friends, to love. Though pretentious, poorly-plotted, ostensibly written in haste, incomprehensible, impossible to follow, and ultimately dull as hell, I always find it amazing how some still claim to love this beautiful-looking but profoundly flawed and empty indie classic. Perhaps because the director is black and female; because us black art-house film lovers were ever eager for a classic to call our own; perhaps because the film has good intentions, or because of the historic importance of the message it tries -- and desperately fails -- to share. I don't know. However, I do know that on more than one occasion when this film has emerged in intelligent conversation amongst so-called cultured/educated/broadened folk, unanimously, everyone will initially claim to love it and praise it highly. And then, as the conversation warms, hands-down, everyone confesses to not even understanding the damn thing, let alone enjoying it. Funny, huh? (Try Sugar Cane Alley instead; it's the real McCoy.) Though Daughters of the Dust will forever be regarded royally by many, few will be honest and brave enough to admit that this emperor of a film has arrived unclad -- completely naked. (Oh, and for the record: I believe the story of the Gullah people is fascinating and indeed worthy of being told, but told well. I proudly support films that promote the positives of feminism -- this one, however, in its myriad other failings, mitigates such a message. And also for the record: I am not some Tyler Perry film fan!) One extra ratings star for effort.",1301184000,7,1651,5.073529411764706

The movie tackles many themes including loss of identity, marital discord and reconciliation, and relocation. All of this is told through the eyes of the Peazant family as part of the family prepares to move ""up north"" and part of the family stays behind. I found the device of having a photographer document the departure very effective. There is nearly an all black cast and the performances are excellent. Because so few films talk about the subject of what happened to black families after Reconstruction, from the family perspective, this film has to be seen. It has tension and drama, but the pace of the film is relaxed. It does this so that you have time to take in the richness of setting. In more ways than one this is an oral narrative that has been put to film.

That being said i think daughters of the dust is a good film, worth watching for, if nothing else, its originality. it shows the life of a family living on the Gullah islands, days before they plan on moving to mainland America.

The film is quite simple with most of the time spent showing the character's relationships and interactions with each other. The actors in the film do a great job at playing there characters honestly and realistically. Daughters of the Dust intentionally doesn't follow a strong linear plot. Julie dash wanted to create a new kind of film and she seems to have succeeded. The power of this movie is in its images, music and relationships of its character.",1226188800,,822,4.829787234042553

1063148,3,6305729212,"When asked what your knowledge of the history of the South encompassed what would you say?  For me, it would be a brief overview of the Civil War, the Migration North for African Americans seeking a new life in the boroughs of New York and Chicago (among other places) and the Civil Rights Movement (with an emphasis on the life's work of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., of course).  There is so much more to this history that we don't commonly hear about in textbooks though.  Specifically, the subject I am referring to is that of the Gullah, a group of African Americans who made their  home in the Low Country of South Carolina and Georgia.  They are also known as Geechee.  They spoke  their own distinctive dialect, prepared Gullah rice dishes (like red rice and okra soup), and herbal medicines based on traditional African practices.

In DAUGHTERS OF THE DUST, a 1991 release directed by Julie Dash, we get a glimpse into the culture of the Gullah.  I am not certain, but, I believe this may be the first and only film of its kind released in theaters to really explore them. The cinematography is beautiful and really is the highlight of this story.  The colors are hypnotic and visual imagery rich. The subjects appear illuminated and have an ethereal glow.

Unfortunately, the emphasis on aesthetic beauty, here, does not carry into other aspects of the film.  Scenes of the Gullah clan fighting, working, praying, performing ritual, falling in love, and reflecting on the deep wounds of ancestral pain are not presented in a linear or comprehensible way.  I realize that in order to really comprehend what is going on, on a deeper level, it helps to have more of a background in the cultural practices of the Gullah.  How many people truly have a grasp on this significance, though?  It truly would have been wonderful if the director, Julie Dash, had been more inclusive of her audience.  I almost sense that this film is a valentine to the past. We watch scenes of beautiful women walking along the shore, preaching gospel to young children, experiencing visitations from the spirit world and men struggling to make peace with themselves and their culture, in preparation to journey north, uprooting themselves from what they know.  It's just a shame that the effect of the film comes across as being more of an indirect ode to a group of people more viewers ought to know about, as opposed to an insightful and enlightening work of historical fiction brought to the screen.",1207267200,16,2484,4.752913752913753

1063150,5,6305729212,"We get what we bring. This principle is brilliantly illustrated in the responses here to ""Daughters of Dust,"" Julie Dash's brilliant and ground-breaking independent film. To dismiss the film is easy, because it uses non-traditional story-telling techniques rather than the ones we are used to in mainstream cinema and popularly received independent films. To receive this film fully takes some time, willingness, effort, and suspension of our usual perception. But, if the viewer can do all that, what a gift Julia Dash and her tribute cast and crew has given us to unwrap.

I lived and worked in Africa for five years and for me, the film so well conveys the African spirit, basic cultural beliefs, sense of wonder (magic), and time that was then transported to the New World. I learned so many things by being with this film and watching the richly detailed accompanying documenting on its making.

Is this easy, pre-digested material? No. Can we afford to dismiss our passionate geniuses in any art form? No. Come to ""Daughters of Dust"" with a full heart, open mind, and a willingness to digest your own food--so lovingly cooked here.

As they embark on their departure, the narrator (an unborn child) traces the families story from slavery until the day. Truly an inspirational piece of work, used in many college film classes.

Despite the fact that I'm interested in Gullah culture and African-American history in general, this film managed to put me to sleep after the first 15 minutes.  No character development, no plot, no coherence (being a Jim Jarmusch fan, I can't even believe I'm writing this). I couldn't figure out the relation of half the characters to each other, or in some cases, even their names, because the dialect is almost unintelligible and there are no subtitles. It's as if you're dropped off in the middle of a strange family on an island, and during the time you stay there, they reveal nothing about themselves. Most student filmmakers could do better.  I agree with the other review writer who stated this was one of the worst films they'd ever seen. Rent a Spike Lee film instead, or a PBS show about Gullahs.",1151884800,10,955,4.740963855421687
1063153,3,6305729212,"This would be the second non-abstract movie I've seen without a plot.  The other one was Morvern Callar, and I must say this one beats that one out by a long shot because this one actually had symbolism and intended meaning.  The loose plot-like structure is about a bunch of African-Americans in 1902 who had lived in isolation on an island for years and were getting ready to go back to Africa, only now they had to deal with issues of the African diaspora and displacement and what it means to their identity.

Very rich visuals are about one of the only things that can really keep your attention going in this film, but if you sit down and force yourself to pay attention you can get a lot out of the dialog as well.  It just requires an extra amount of effort to pay off, but once you expend that effort you might just get something out of it.

A little more difficult is the fact that at least four different distinct languages are spoken in this film, with only one moment done with subtitles.  The languages I caught besides English were German, French, and Arabic (?) but there may very well have been much more (I think there was a little Spanish and some Latin as well).

I can't really speak much about the technical qualities of the film other than the fact that the symbolism and imagery are amazing and the script is tedious.  It's really hard to focus on more than that, unfortunately.

1063154,5,6305729212,"I saw this film no less than four times in the theater, dragged all my friends to see it, and could not wait until it was available for home viewing.  This film's stories, while part and parcel of a painful episode in African-American history, are above all, HUMAN stories that should touch the heart of ALL humanity, regardless of one's ethnic origin.

I loved each and every character, and wanted to know more about them.  With every viewing, I pick up on details I've not noticed before -- the mark of well-crafted storytelling and multi-dimensional, well-developed characters.

The cinematography is breath-taking, the gorgeous music is perfectly married to the images, the overall ambience always beckons me back, and the plot unfolds delicately like petals of a flower.  I cannot praise this movie enough.

My two disappointments have nothing to do with the actual movie, but with the fact that subtitles were not included on the DVD release (some of the Gullah language is a barrier for some viewers, although I found the language pertinent and necessary to the production's authenticity; plus, I hate for hearing-impaired folks to miss out on a great movie).  However, a book of the script and interviews with film maker Julie Dash is available for those who are curious.  Secondly, to my knowledge no music soundtrack was ever made available on CD.  Thankfully, the DVD has the option of playing the isolated music track, although some sound effects were not separated from the music, and there are often long silences from one music cue to the next.  Hopefully in some future edition, these issues will be addressed.

In closing, I have to say that this is an important movie, a beautiful movie, a resoundingly truthful movie that touched me on so many levels - especially as it addresses the gulf of yearning that exists between so many people and their families, or between human beings in general as we move through personal changes and differences.

My paternal great-grandfather was Gullah and in viewing this film over and over, I have come to terms about why I've never quite ""fit"" with the movement to move away and forget about where my ancestors came from.

1063207,5,6305729212,"Julie Dash's film ""Daughters of the Dust"" is a movie of such enchanting beauty as to leave you spellbound.  It's the story of a Gullah family in the Sea Islands of Georgia, preparing to relocate to the mainland in 1902.  The Sea Islands, as Julie Dash tells us in the companion volume written for the film, were the Ellis Islands of the transatlantic slave trade, the dropping off point and processing center for the forced immigration of untold millions of Africans.  Because of this, African cultural influences are more strongly rooted here than anywhere else in the United States.

At the head of the family is Nana Peazant, a matriarch whose quiet strength has seen her through slavery to the hard days of Reconstruction and beyond.  Her children and their husbands and wives have decided to seek a future in the more modern environment of the mainland.  They've grown tired of the backwardness of the island and want to spread their wings.  But as Nana, who resolutely determines to stay put, has foreseen, they can remove themselves from the island, but they can't remove the island from within themselves, any more than they can remove the indigo dye of the island from their hands; they are marked forever by a part of their culture that will never go away.

Along with Nana, we meet Yellow Mary, a cousin who has returned from Cuba as a fallen woman, unconsciously clinging to her roots as hard as she tries to pull away from them; Haggar, a bitter, possessive woman who attempts to hold onto her two young daughters, MyOwn and Iona (""I Own Her""), even as they attempt to break away and make their own destiny; Viola, using her hidebound Christianity as a shield to hide from her African heritage, and Eula and Eli, coping with the devastation of Eula's rape and impregnation by a white man, whose Unborn Child is the narrator of this film.  There is heartbreak for Nana, watching her family depart from the home that has been theirs for generations, and for Haggar, whose daughter Iona decided to make her own destiny by eloping with her Native American lover.

Julie Dash has managed to create film so real and so evocative that it transports us right into the action; we are there on the beach, feeling the heat, smelling the gumbo cooking, and listening to the exquisite tonalities of the Gullah dialect.  The acting by all the characters is excellent throughout, with special mention for standout performances by Cora Lee Day as Nana Peazant, Alva Rogers as Eula Peazant, and Barbara O. Jones as Yellow Mary; but the real star in this film is the exquisite cinematography which is unlike anything I have ever seen in any film.  The movie is so visually gorgeous that one just sits and watches awestruck.  An equally strong script, well acted by the cast, gives the movie a depth and meaning that makes the film worth watching over and over.

""Daughters of the Dust"" is much more than a movie; it's an emotionally charged history lesson of a little known place and a little known culture.  It remains inside you, a part of you, long after the final credits have ended.

Thank you Ms. Dash for a very necessary tool inwhich I will use to educate my children on our history.  And if you never do anything else, rest assured with this one you've done enough.  Like Toni Morrison's ""Beloved"" your ""Daughters of the Dust"" is so very necessary.",1046563200,7,435,4.154761904761905
1063209,2,6305729212,"I recently watched Julie Dash's daughter of the dust for a class I am currently enrolled in. While the cinematography is absolutely beautiful, I found little else in the film that would justify more than a single viewing. The narrative itself is confusing and very hard to follow.  The plot of the film is quite simple: a large family of Ibo Landing residents decide to move from the island they currently inhabit to the mainland US against the wishes of the family matriarch. However, the way in which the narrative is presented could have been handled in a more straight-forward way. Because the film does express some important political opinions concerning feminism and explores an aspect of US history and black culture that might otherwise go overlooked, it is worth watching, but once was enough for me. I'm giving the film two stars for the cinematography. If you are in the mood for a challenge you may enjoy this film, but if you want an interesting or entertaining film, try again!",1020816000,5,992,4.8011695906432745
1063210,5,6305729212,"I don't profess to be adept at critiquing film, or capable of being intellectual about it, as many other here seem to be. But one shouldn't dismiss my review because of that fact either. While some have talked about this film being about ""feminism"", etc., that was not my take on it at all, be my perspective right or wrong. Quite simply, I loved the cinematography, the score, the beautiful characters, the language, and the story of this film. Ms. Dash is clearly an ""artiste"". Some of the scenes in this film were so beautiful that they brought tears to my eyes. To me this film was a very spiritual film... about the connection of people past and present... about our connection to the earth... I also got the sense that this film was conveying the belief that more ""simple"" spirituality is truer than manufactured spirituality, a la formalized religion.",1014595200,13,858,4.726666666666667
1063211,4,6305729212,"The story takes place around the turn of the century, and is about a gathering of the black Pesant family of the Sea Islands off the Carolinas as they prepare to migrate north, out of the world of former slaves in a rural society and into the modern era in the city. I found this film to be visually beautiful and deeply human. The Sea Island English dialect of the characters took a little getting used to, but was well worth the effort of understanding. The clan is large and multi generational, and they take time to honor their oldest member, great grandmother Nana Pesant. Her statement,  ""The ancestor and the womb is one and the same. Respect your ancestors, call on them for strength."" is the underling theme of the film. All of this action is clothed in profound visual beauty, and magical events and memory weave through the fabric of the film.  Believe me, you don't have to be black to enjoy this film. I loved it, and feel that it is on a par with the best of Fellini.",1013558400,15,981,4.384615384615385

1063213,4,6305729212,"I had  to watch this film several times. It  was haunting. What  was it I was missing? There  was something here but  I could put my  hand on  it. It was not my  hand that  was needed it was my  heart.
The film opened my male heart to an idea I had not considered. The mystical powers of  matriachy. It made me reconsider those core expperiences and histories of women in my own family  and how these  experiences, these srcaps of memory affect  me, mold me.  Cinema  is an experience.  it is not about where a film is or  what it  is about sometimes...but where a  film takes you.  The experience of cinema can  still be sublime. Now that  is a  comfort to me  as a cinema lover.  Daughters is  a sublime experience that  I will  always cherish.
I bought  the DVD to  learn more about the making of the  film. It  seems a miracle  a film like this could even be made in America. The extra  material on the DV  really  gives insigfht  into the complex emotional and  cultural history of African America.",1006560000,14,1003,4.244565217391305
