7436026,5,B015GSX7CS,"I rented this movie to watch, And after watching it I will buy it on DVD or Blu-ray. Why ? because it can be watched once in a while to remind me how the reality of homelessness is . And that it can happen to anyone , that is what this movie shows the reality of how it looks and feels to be homeless and poor. The story is basic and nothing really special , Richard Gere a older man with no hope and problems including a poor relationship  with his daughter, lives in New York homeless trying to survive day by day and this film portrays that very well. And that is the best thing about the movie the depressing reality of being homeless and poor.",1450742400,3,648,4.102362204724409
7436027,5,B015GSX7CS,"Probably the best performance of Richard Gere's career, it's a shame this film didn't get a wider release. It received many very positive reviews on the festival circuit, but is very special, very delicate, requiring a viewers total commitment. On the surface it's a road movie (The streets of Manhattan, being ""the road."") about a fairly recently homeless man, with mental and alcohol problems tying to obtain the necessary papers to get into the shelter system. Actually, it's really about losing one's way, a seminal catastrophic event which sends one on a downward spiral. Besides Richard, Ben Vareen gives an Oscar worthy performance and (surprise of surprises) the usually you can always catch her acting Kyra Sedgewick is sensational as a street/bottle lady.",1450483200,3,765,5.227642276422764

7436029,3,B015GSX7CS,"I watched this movie because I like Richard Gere, but other than a stellar performance by him, I thought this movie dragged out far too long and honestly, to me, got a bit boring. I know Homelessness is a huge issue, but it seems that ever since SHELTER with Jennifer Connelly and Anthony Mackie came out to such good reviews, now lots of people are ""jumping on the bandwagon"", so to speak to bring out several movies on homelessness.
I also didn't think there was a very good use of the rest of the talented actors in this film.",1450310400,,529,4.353535353535354
7436030,3,B015GSX7CS,"Im a huge fan of Richard Gere and his dramatic acting and I heard about this film earlier in the year where there were articles that he trained to play a homeless man on the streets of New York City by staying in shelters and hanging in parks to see if anyone recognized him. Yes, homelessness is an important issue and needs to be discussed. But after spending over two hours with this film, I felt there was a better way to tell the story.

There is very little dialogue as we watch Geres character move between shelters, sell off his clothes  layer by layer  to buy cans of beer, and meet some characters like Ben Vereens brief tern as a former jazz musician. The director uses the unconventional approach of having conversations by others on the street or in the background of a scene, having conversations.

The film produced and funded by the Independent Film Channel and is far from anything Gere has done before.

There are two bonuses on the Bluray besides the trailer. One is a featurette about the production, that last barely 2  minutes. The other is a PSA (Public Service Announcement) that Gere made on homelessness (and a plug for the film). This lasts just 30 seconds. Im honestly not sure that adding 120  minutes to this to make the film, added that much to the important message.

If you are interested in unique filmmaking and minimal dialogue and want to see what a homeless shelter looks like, youll probably enjoy this more than I did.

The credits end with what must be 200 people that the film is dedicated to. I can only guess that this is a list of the real homeless people in NYC that Gere encountered in making this film.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

7436031,3,B015GSX7CS,"Im homeless. Im nobody. I don't exist. George (Gere) is a homeless man struggling to survive in New York. Spending his days begging for food and money he is at the end of his rope. When he meets another man in the same position he finds a friend and someone that he can lean on for help. When he tries to reconnect with his daughter Maggie (Malone) everyone involved has to look at themselves and their past. This is a difficult movie to review. The movie itself is OK, very depressing but it keeps you watching even though nothing really happens. On the other hand I have never thought Richard Gere was that great of an actor, until this movie. This is a great character study of the real struggles a homeless person goes through. This is a very good movie, but not really one to watch for entertainment purposes. Overall, a very good, but very heavy and emotional movie that will affect you. I give this a B.",1450051200,6,910,4.390532544378698
7436032,5,B015GSX7CS,"Directed by Oren Moverman (who made a dynamic and topical directorial debut with The Messenger, but lost his way with the convoluted and overwrought Rampart), Time Out of Mind is a fascinating and hypnotic aural and visual experiment, emphasizing observation over dramatic omniscience.  It is also a poignant drama with a social conscience and a vital subject:  the homeless experience in a contemporary American city.  Richard Gere portrays George, an itinerant and marginalized man whose daily routine pivots on finding a bite to eat, a corner on which to beg, and, at last, a place to rest his head, perhaps in a men's shelter or just on a public bench.  He has no form of identification, and straight-faced bureaucrats often inform him a form of I.D. (a birth certificate, proof of residency) is required to receive another form of I.D., such as a new Social Security card.  This cycle alone imprisons him in a labyrinthine system as time bends, elongates, and becomes a nearly arbitrary measure of existence.

The character so deeply inhabits the city as to be almost invisible:  a figure half glimpsed through a window, another body crowding the street or subway.  The elegant and rigidly composed photography emphasizes his there-and-not-there relation to spaces, often positioning him in the corner of the frame and obscuring him with an ambivalent pedestrian or a reflection of light in a dirty pane of glass.  And the evocative image is always complemented by the complex sound design:  George's hazily scarce words slip in and out of a maelstrom of car horns, church bells, idle chat, and other urban-noise pollutants.  Such bold aesthetic choices will, of course, prove limiting on a financial level (this is a traditional ""art-house"" release), but they are courageous and worthwhile:  no other film I have watched has depicted the plight of the homeless in such an immediate, sensory way, and it is always heartening to see a star-driven independent production madly pursue its muse without a hint of vanity or audience hand-holding.  Everyone involved with Time Out of Mind is clearly serious, sympathetic, and well-researched, and the result is an uncompromising cinematic experience.

George's exact history (a presumed blend of alcohol dependence, mental illness, and self-absorption) is left ambiguous, but we learn he has an estranged daughter, played by Jena Malone, and we read on his face how his fractured mind functions:  absent gazes give way to stabs of grief or rage before the fog returns.  The cumulative impact of Gere's harshly non-glamorous and dialed-down performance is staggering:  every muted gesture rings true, and every cough and groan hurts.  Both he and the film in general also wisely resist the temptation to sentimentalize via a singular, soothing epiphany or moment of transcendence.  Colorful aid is lent by Ben Vereen as the loquacious, madcap Dixon, a shelter veteran and self-proclaimed great pianist who briefly positions himself as George's ""friend"" through sheer force of will and perhaps does slightly connect with him insofar as anyone can.",1442620800,30,3094,5.201612903225806

7436034,4,B015GSX7CS,"This film pulses and beats with the rhythm of New York City. No soundtrack, no cheap sentimentality or artifice- just a composite of stolen moments displacing a traditional narrative line. More experience oriented than a conventional movie, Time Out of Mind journals the plight of George, played by Richard Gere, as he solicits food, shelter and compassion in a bustling urban landscape that renders him invisible. The camera keeps action at a distance, observing, surviving. Homelessness not as a public service announcement but rather as a vibrant, living, breathing life event. It's not for everyone but it was made for all of us.",1488412800,,633,5.155339805825243

7436039,5,B015GSX7CS,"Time out of mind is a wonderfully great film, so well shot, all the reflections of NYC street scenes in store windows, and the cell-phone conversations constantly in the background, and the music, the great acting characterizing homeless people with emotional problems! Really thought provoking, and a different look at our society, which has plenty of money to invade other countries illegally, but hardly any money for health, education and welfare.

An important well made film, exactly, as others have said, and a good movie about a subject most of us choose to ignore, I'm glad I found this. I used to work in a homeless shelter when I was younger, but I wasn't able to sympathize or understand the traumas of others at that time, nor did I, as several commentators have observed realize how close we all can be to this state of hitting the bottom. All the Syrian, Iraqi, Palestinian, Libyan, Afghani, Honduran, and African immigrants are in just this state, having had lives that were largely screwed up for them by forces beyond their control, and once they lose their apartments, .......................Time out of mind

Similar in many ways to the film ""Precious,"" and also to that 1980's documentary about homeless street kids in Seattle, also ""The Soloist,"" and even the Linklater classic ""Slackers,"" only this film is about what happens when the slackers who have a lot of soul and theories about life can't find any more sustenance or shelter.

This film treats subjects few people consider the realm of motion pictures, because we see film as entertainment, while this movie is more like a well-paced, very troubling sonata.  it is hopeful to know that someone, like the people who made this expensive well produced arty film, actually think about the human condition and care deeply.",1472256000,,1798,4.9634551495016614

It should have been more like a short story. If this was condensed more to keep the tedium out of being down and out, the power of his inner strength at just carrying on could have spoken louder (unless I missed the point of the movie).  Richard Geer's acting was very good, and convincing. You could feel his pain and ambivalence at times, and but he almost made me think he was mentally handicapped at other times.

7436045,5,B015GSX7CS,"A rather haunting look into what it is really like to be homeless.  As great as this movie about living on the streets was it does not come close to the real life hell of being homeless. While not perfect Time Out of Mind gets so many things right. Time Out of Mind is a movie that occurs mostly in the edges of your awareness. You seldom see the main homeless charcter in an traditional close up or other intimate shot. The homeless guy is always somewhere in the margins of the reality the film presents.  Generally most of the people this homeless guy encounters are nice. There are a few scenes where the homeless guy gets roughed up but nothing too bad.

In real life being homeless is an ugly mean struggle and people who are housed are no where near as nice as the majority of those the homeless guy in the film encounters. Yet again there are so many demoralizing and demeaning things the homeless guy suffers. So many Catch 22 Situations the rules and laws force him into. The mission scenes seem to come right out of a Nazi concentration camp it is heart breaking to see some of what the homeless guy suffers.

This film brings to light how bad the systems in place now are at serving the true needs of the homeless. The film did not bring into focus the thousands of indignities homeless people suffer in a day everyday on the streets. The film focused on presenting the homeless as being fixtures of urban life so commonplace that it neither shocks or offends us as individuals or as a nation. The real power behind Time Out of Mind is that it always shows the homeless guy in the margins of the visual narrative.  So many of us me included have atught ourselves to see ""The Homeless"" in our travels but never quite as people but more like part of the urban landscape.

The homeless are always seen in a very detached third \ fourth person sort of way and this film brings that to the fore. Time Out of Mind shows how our perspective of looking past the homeless is part of our urban survival strategy. The homeless guy is always seen in this film in the context with another thing, object or place.  The homeless guy is always appears like a side order or an afterthought in the film and this was done purposely in hopes it makes the viewer think.  People think death is the greatest horror one can experience and yeah DEATH is a big deal.

This movie shows what any chronically homeless man, woman or child can tell you. Being invisible within hustle and bustle of the urban landscape is a darn sight more horrorific than being dead. The dead are noticed at least for the time it takes to cart them away. The homeless are the dead who walk among us suffering a life that has had most of its dignity removed, To need money for a cup of coffee and immediately be feared as a freak, dope addict or ex con. I was told by a homeless friend that thing he hated most about being homeless is the lengths some people will go through to avoid making I contact with him. I wish Time Out of Mind had shown how some people fight to avoid all eye contact.

I was walking downtown one day and a little girl with her mom walked past a dude sitting on a curb dirty, smelly and homeless. The little girl wanted to give the man the five dollars from her little purse.  I remember seeing her mom get very upset smacking the child telling her, ""What did I tell you about looking at those people!"" And you want to know why homeless people are invisible its because; we teach other children not to see the homeless from a very early age. This film shows the result of being taught to look past the homeless. Oh we see the homeless as potential threats to be managed as we move through out day in the city. Walk on the other side of the street, avoid talking, avoid eye contact, put a blank or scowling expression on your face. Be deliberate in your walking, ignore pleas for help. Assume everyone who is homeless is a dope addict, ex convict or moral reprobate.

I wish this movie had shown the real ways people respond to a homeless man who was not a convict, not an alcoholic, not a dope addict just a man who lost his home.  The saddest thing is we most of us including me always assume if a man is homeless he had to do something wrong to get thrown out onto the streets. He must be a doper, an alcoholic, a criminal or a person of low moral character.  Sometimes you end up on the streets just because; your life falls apart. Heck it can be simple as the only job you were good at no longer exists so you have no income soon you have no house and you are homeless. The movie suggests this guy just lost everything but, I wish the link were made stronger. I loved this movie for all it got right I just wish it had done a tad more!",1465689600,,4726,4.260044642857143

7436050,4,B015GSX7CS,"'George' (Richard Gere) has over the past 10 years lost his way in life, he's lost his self respect, his identity and all
connection to his past and who he once was.
He wanders the streets of New York daily, begging for hand-outs to fund his need for alcohol....having again lost a place
to sleep, he now has to seek out another place of refuge, in the meantime with temperatures dropping sleeping on park
-benches or in shop-porches, repeatedly having been turned away from public institutions.
He does find refuge eventually at Bellevue Hospital an intake centre for homeless men in Manhattan, where he is befriended
by 'Dixon' (Ben Vereen) a fellow client of the centre who encourages 'George' to make an attempt to build bridges with his
estranged daughter 'Maggie' (Jena Malone)
However, a father down on his luck, a vagrant, will be a hard pill for 'Maggie' to swallow, will she reject or accept the father
she barely knows ?
This is a dower story of desperation and indeed self abandonment of a man who muddles through each day with little or no
hope or intent of it ever changing.
It's a very slow moving film with a hint of sadness along the way, not for everyone.....but worth a watch.
Recently i saw 'Richard Gere' interviewed about the film, he said that there was a concern that he would be repeatedly
recognised during filming by the public on the streets of New York....he wasn't (which says it all really, vagrants are indeed
invisible to most)",1461542400,,1460,4.684824902723736

7436093,5,B015GSX7CS,"Films about homeless people are inherently compelling  it could happen to any one of us. What would it be like, to live off the cold, uninviting streets, to be both free of societal norms and a slave to deprivation? What does home mean, when you don't have one? How would it feel, to be unnoticed, to know, with certainty, that nobody cares whether you live or die?

Classics, such as Terry Gilliams mythical The Fisher King and Satoshi Kons animated masterpiece Tokyo Godfathers, touched upon those subjects in ways that were both insightful and artistic. Oren Movermans deliberately paced Time Out of Mind comes closest so far to depicting that state of constant perplexity, brought on by desolation and a steady disassembling of ones humanity, from its opening shot of a crummy apartment, to the extraordinarily sublime conclusion.

At its center is a career-defining performance from Richard Gere, an actor whos displayed quite the range throughout his impressive filmography, but here reveals a side previously unseen in the notorious charmer. The stalwarts long overdue for an Academy Award nomination, and he surely deserves one for Time Out of Mind  hes absolutely mesmerizing.

The film begins in the aforementioned rundown New York apartment. The building manager (Steve Buscemi) discovers George (Richard Gere) in the bathtub. George mumbles about someone named Sheila coming back (Shes not gonna lie to me, Im here with her, this is my home!), but is assured that no one is coming back, and hurriedly ushered out, with nothing but a trash bag and a feeble suitcase to carry his few belongings. He later attempts to return to the building, with the same result  an action one could define as a symptom of insanity.

More traces and shades of Georges condition become apparent, as we follow him through the rainy, late-winter streets of the Big Apple. He has a large scar on the side of his head. He sleeps on benches. He sells his clothes off for booze. He swigs vodka out of the bottle and rests on cold asphalt. He watches a young barmaid from a distance (Jena Malone).

He sleeps in the waiting room of an unusually (for New York) empty ER, where a friendly nurse recommends a shelter for him. Sheila is going to be worried sick, I better get back home, he says absent-mindedly. The nurses kindness turns into discomfort the more they talk, and then another gentleman  not-so-politely  asks him to leave. He has to go through a bunch of bureaucratic paperwork to get a bed at a shelter. He strains the entire time, struggling to piece his life together, and the paperwork is just too much for him.

Everywhere George goes is alienating, numbingly inhumane  until, that is, an older homeless man, Dixon (Ben Vereen), brings a little substance and meaning to his life. Dixon claims to be a jazz musician, but cant play (and by cant, he means that he doesnt allow himself to touch upon a remnant of a life he once led, a life that has since shattered into fragments he cannot reassemble). Dixon follows George around, both angry at the world and a kindred spirit.

One day George seems to recognize Sheila, who turns out to be another homeless woman, Karen, (Kyra Sedgwick). Karen has adapted to the streets, her strategy involving a copious amount of collected soda and beer cans. They make love. George ends up literally stripped  of his clothes, and down to mans basic desires: warmth, shelter, food, watercontact.

Time Out of Mind is a portrayal of a man whos hit rock bottomand keeps falling. Im really no good right now, he declares grievously at one point. He is torn, impatient, emotionally imbalanced (who wouldnt be?), lost, regretful. A faint glimmer of damp hope propels him through his delusions, and a stubborn denial, a refusal to admit he needs medical help and that he is, in fact, homeless (Its temporary, George resolutely states), out of pride and sophistication he must have once possessed.

It must be reiterated how magnificent Gere is. Appearing in pretty much every shot, he channels his established charisma into a delicate, devastatingly real performance. If the film has one flaw, its the choice not to reveal a little more backstory, which renders it a bit distant  but Geres warmth thaws the frigid portrayal of the city and brings much depth to the impenetrability of his character. Ben Veeren provides outstanding support (best line: Okay, Im a cartoon, at least Im animated!), turning a potentially cliched character into a tragic and complex figure.

Bobby Bukowski, Movermans cinematographer on both The Messenger and Rampart, supplements every shot with gloom and urban beauty, such as one of George standing by a shop-window, with a blurry-but-vivid yellow haze obscuring the right side of the screen, in stark contrast to the wet, monochrome despair of the left side. The duos decision to shoot mostly from inside or outside buildings, at a distance from George, pays off, directly isolating the viewer with shields of raindrop-covered glass, making the basic comforts of life seem that much more unattainable.

A lot of the dialogue is barely-audible, in resistance to most films crisp-clear soundtrack. This is real city noise, where distant murmurs intertwine with random ramblings and discussions. The technique further adds to New York being urgently, realistically represented.

If the film sounds like a total downerwell, it is. But one cant expect all art to be optimistic and, you know, happily-ever-after, Gere and Moverman infuse the film with so much nuance, its more of a beautiful, existential painting  but also a meditation on the roots of homelessness, loneliness, friendship, forgiveness, and the humanity in us. It never for a moment resorts to sermonizing. Time Out of Mind is a poetic call to action, an ode to a city and its inhabitants, and a stellar showcase for the protagonist. Next time you look at a homeless person, you may just stop and wonder",1453334400,8,5923,4.944612286002014

7436100,5,B015GSX7CS,"SUPERB, moving performance by Richard Gere. This is actually the only movie of his I ever loved. The pace of this movie is a little slow and anti-climactic but is so raw and full of truth. The truth is..........many of us in America find ourselves in a similar situation of homelessness. Many more in the near future will find options that have run out, doors closed in our faces and the uncomfortable realization that our society has failed thousands of the mentally ill and outcast. The truth is hard to watch as Richard Gere portrays a man lost........lost in a sea of humanity that looks the other way as he struggles to find some semblance of his former self while maintaining a modicum of dignity as a man. The truth is the all the homeless are our brothers, fathers, sisters, mothers, sons and daughters that are lost somehow. This movie made me feel sad how the days of close-knit families is gone so far away in this country that allows homelessness as a secret we just don't talk about.

7436102,5,B015GSX7CS,"Richard Gere leads us through the gray, lonely, hopeless, confusing world of homelessness with an amazingly quiet and tender performance. Truly a profound movie that provides a glimpse into the life so many people lead -- and a life which is just a few paychecks away for many others. I was surprised that the language in the film was palatable save the first three or four lines of script. I am sure the streets are grittier, dirtier, and replete with profanities. I'm glad the movie held those elements at bay. Perhaps it was intentional -- showing that the ""civilized"" and employed people were far less cultured than many of those who dwell amid the ranks of the homeless. The characters played by Ben Vereen and Kyra Sedgwick were well portrayed. I didn't even know it was Kyra until the credits ran. A movie most people should see as, honestly, life can throw curves, and we could all end up on the desperate side of the fence. It's not that far away.",1451952000,6,956,4.5964912280701755

7436106,4,B015GSX7CS,"Richard Gere can do no wrong as far as I have seen all these years. Starting with American Gigolo until Time Out of Mind, he really convinces me that he is the character he plays.  I've liked him best in films like this one: for example, Intersection with Sharon Stone, or Mr. Jones with Lena Olin; films in which he is in serious distress or conflict from within or without.  He is soulful and this film, which I believe took a very long time to make, is the prime example of his soulfulness. The older he gets the better he gets. I only felt like crying when he finally played the piano, he is a very good musician.
I thought Ben Vereen was good too. I wondered if he was part of Gere's character or on his own. There is a dream quality( or maybe nightmare is a better word ) to this film.  It is not easy to watch but it is important. To get a peek into a world inhabited by the homeless is frightening and so very sad. Necessary too. I'm glad I watched it.

7436107,3,B015GSX7CS,"Pros:  Richard Gere did a fabulous job of being a homeless man, maybe too good.  Ben Vereen was also very good as his talkative friend at the Shelter.  Cons:  Absolutely NO HOPE in this movie.  I kept watching it waiting for something redeeming to happen.  It was clear that Richard Gere was an alcoholic.  Everytime he would get any money, either from his daughter, who was extremely hostile to him, or by panhandling, he would go to the bar or liquor store and buy alcohol.  You find out as the story goes on, that his wife had breast cancer and died -- they lost their insurance, and then their house in the course of her illness.  The wife's mother ended up raising the estranged daughter, since Richard Gere's character had started drinking and had ""gone down the rabbit hole.""  There is so much the writer/producer/director could have done with this movie.  First and foremost, the guy was grieving - and had self-medicated with alcohol, but not once in the movie did anyone make mention of attending an Alcoholics Anonymous Meeting.  He lived in New York City and there has to be hundreds of AA meetings there.  This could have had a redeeming ending, but instead it just left you feeling ... well ... very depressed.  I don't recommend it, even though Richard Gere is a great actor.  If you want to get really depressed and feel hopeless ... this movie is for you.",1451260800,2,1372,4.588477366255144
