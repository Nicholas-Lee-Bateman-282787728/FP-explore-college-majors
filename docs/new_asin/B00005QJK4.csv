7950647,1,B00005QJK4,"The DVD's cover art shows actress Jenny Neumann in scuba gear, holding a machine gun. A real kick-ass, Amazonian, Angelina Jolie/Lara Croft type supergal (before Angelina Jolie).

This cover art is a lie. In the film, Neumann never wears scuba gear, never even holds a gun, much less shoots it. She plays an environmental scientist who spends much of the film cowering in a cave, occasionally crying.

Neumann's part of a group of environmentally aware seismologists who set up some buoys on an island, unaware that they're part of a secret U.S. Navy Intelligence project seeking Soviet subs.

Her group sets up the buoys -- for about 45 minutes! -- during which nothing much happens.

Then -- finally! -- they are attacked by Soviet scuba divers from some secret underwater base. TWO of them! TWO Soviets! That's all we ever see.

I guess they're scuba divers, because after over a day on the island, they still wear their scuba gear. They just skulk about the island, in their scuba gear, carrying guns, trying to kill Neumann's group.

These are no special forces frogmen either. One of them is a real porker, looking like a middle-aged guy with his belly and thighs bursting against the scuba outfit.

They kill Neumann's boss.

Then there's this annoying, elderly Greek guy in Neumann's group, always dancing Greek dances and talking about Greek gods. I think he was supposed to be endearing. He knocked out a scuba man, than danced his Greek dance, like a jerk. He was then shot by the scuba man's partner.

I was so happy to see this Greek guy get shot. I'd been about to fall asleep, the film had gotten so slow again, but seeing the jerk get shot made me laugh.

Jenny Neumann does little except cower in a cave, and run and hide. Oh, once she almost leaves her cave to ""talk sense"" to the scuba men, because she thinks they're Chilean marines, but a guy in her group ""talks sense"" to her, so she doesn't.

In the end, she gets rescued by one of the guys. This guy has beautifully puffed and blow-dried hair throughout the film, no matter how arduous his ordeal.

This film is so low-budget. Five seismologists and two scuba men on an island, playing hide and seek. And a handful of people back in the States, looking grimly at the data from the buoys. That's about it.

No adventure here.",1222214400,4,2298,4.602941176470588
