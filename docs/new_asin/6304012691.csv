7858960,4,6304012691,"I realized this was a low no budget picture and I was amazed it was shot on Hi 8 video even back in 1993.  The quality stood up and the action was fast paced and exciting.  There were a lot of good actors in this film which shows me the director picked the best out of the talent that doesn't work much in Hollywood.
The Venice scene was fun
I recommend it as viewing fun and also to anyone wanting to make movies.",975542400,2,414,3.9759036144578315
