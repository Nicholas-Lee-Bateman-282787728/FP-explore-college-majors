2692165,3,B000KJTFES,"I mainly only do real dance workouts or yoga, but on reading this on collagevideo com saying it had dance moves, I rented it online.
I only got a few minutes into it before realized there was very little dance & has some floor work & though Lena Pereira & everyone seem fun & upbeat, I still didn't get into it. It felt a little unfocused.
The DVD choices are only play & the chapters which are: belly, butt & thigh.

2692166,5,B000KJTFES,"This video is fun! The music is great for the style of the exercises. It has really unusual exercises that are more like dancing, and they hit muscles that a lot of work out routines don't reach. It really made me work hard, it especially made my abs work hard. And it really works out your thighs. The instructor is very good and doesn't annoy me. She shows you the moves and then brings them up to tempo so it is easier to follow, and the moves build up into little routines that are fun and sexy. It not only helps your get into shape to look good in your bikini, it makes you feel sexier so you feel comfortable when your in your bikini. This is a pretty advanced workout that I will want to do again and again. I love the crunch series.",1194307200,4,741,4.117241379310345
2692167,4,B000KJTFES,"This is a fun workout that doesn't take much time.  It is a good addition to the Crunch series, which I like a lot. The instructor is upbeat and perky which I liked for this particular DVD, but am not always a fan of. The DVD is broken into three parts and each one lasts 10 minutes. Each section works on a specific area of the body to get you in bikini shape. I like the ab section a lot b/c it has a standing ab section as well as a normal mat workout for the abs.",1189555200,3,467,3.814432989690722
2692168,3,B000KJTFES,I've seen several of the movements on other crunch dvds I have or at least similar movements.  It's really hard to find different movements.  It seems everyone's taking the same movements and just modiifying them slightly and giving the movement a different name.  It's an easy workout and the only good thing is that you can do it in parts but wasn't worth the bother for me.,1186617600,2,376,4.582089552238806
2692169,4,B000KJTFES,This was also my first Crunch video as well. I purchases this item due to the reviews that I read and also I was looking for a good lower body workout. My legs were killing me after I was done with the thighs section and not to mention a few days later as well. The butt section I thought at first really didn't do too much for that section of my body...I really only felt it in my legs as well. BUT a few hours later I started to feel sore and I was really excited because I find it really hard to find a work out that really works in that area. The moves were fun too...at first I was a little surprised because I thought I was dancing more than working out but I got over that a few minutes later because I was sweating like crazy! I recommend this video for anyone that is looking for a fun lower body workout that you can squeeze in a busy day!,1180742400,2,849,3.941860465116279
2692170,5,B000KJTFES,"I love the Crunch videos and have several. I came on here a few days ago and found that they had just released this one, so I had to get it. I have been feeling a little bored with exercising lately and this totally changed that for me. Its so much fun to do. Lena, the instructor was really cute and motivating. The video is only 30 minutes, so you can fit it in just about any time. This really got my heart rate up. The butt section of this was the best. Its a little difficult to keep up with because its pretty high energy, but im sure that doing this several times will have me able to keep up no problem. I would definitely recommend this DVD to anyone.",1175299200,5,660,4.0458015267175576
2692171,4,B000KJTFES,"I am a fan of the Crunch videos so when I saw this one, I had to try it. I'm very glad that I did. First off, I like how the DVD is split into mini 10 minute work outs so that if you are short on time, you can pick one or two and feel as though you've accomplished something.

The instructor is ok. At first when I heard her say ""Right Ladieeeesss?"" I was like, ""OH NO! A blonde with a high voice!"" But I was surprised that she is pretty likable and motivating.

The abs section is not too great. It doesn't really involve anything stellar or new and I can't feel it the next day.

The thighs and butt sections are really good. Be advised there is a lot of hopping and lunging in the butt section so if you have bad knees or know you can't perform these moves correctly, skip it, you could really hurt yourself. I really enjoyed the booty and thighs workout, Lena uses traditional toning exercises with little twists mixed in with cute, stripper-like dance moves that actually work your muscles--this is what Carmen Electra's DVDs should have been like. I actually see results from this! My butt seems a little smaller and tighter and I do feel my thighs burning the next day.

This is a great workout that gets you up and moving. The time flies by, I usually do all 3 segments at once and the half-hour just flies by.",1175126400,22,1318,4.218253968253968
2692172,4,B000KJTFES,"This was the first Crunch video I have ever owned.  I have been a long time Firm user and loved it but I was looking for a shorter, less strength training intensive workout.  This is a good choice especially if you are trying to tone your lower body.  I have only done this a few times and I am already seeing results.  Other people are starting to notice as well.

There is very little instruction so you may have to watch it one or two times before actually doing it so that you can become familiar with the sequence.  The lead instructor, Lena, is like a cartoon character with her high voice but I find her likable.

Over all, the work out is pretty good. It gets my heart rate up and really works the muscle groups it's intending to target, especially the thighs (My thighs start burning even before I get to the section of the video specifically designed for thighs and I was sore the next day).  The entire work out is short and effective.  If you are short on time or want to supplement another workout with exercises for a specific target area you can skip sections and do what you think is important.

As far as my 4 star review I am rating it solely on what this DVD has to offer.  Because I am looking for total body slimming and toning, this video will be one of many in my rotation.

Note that this is an intermediate workout.  People who have not worked out in a while will probably find this hard to get through.  If you have bad knees this workout is probably not for you.",1173744000,22,1489,4.23404255319149
2692173,3,B000KJTFES,"On the contrary to the previous video...the instructor isn't quite as annoying as Denise Austin, but she is real close...You can tell she's from Miami because she says it about three time throughout the video. You can also tell that she must have been some type of stripper because some of her swaying moves and seductive arms make me want to break out my stilletos! She doesn't give many instructions because she assumes you already know all of the moves.

This video is the type where if you don't really feel like working out, you can pop in this dvd and you will feel a bit better that you actually got up from the couch. It doesn't make you sweat like other videos but it's a good workout for one of your off days and when you are short on time.

Also, the workouts went by fast and I was never bored so that was a plus. I like alot of the CRUNCH videos and most of them are well made, but this seems like the producers woke up one day and said ""Hey, let's have a abs video led by a Miami blonde haired girl and her friends?"" And in 5 minutes it was created...

If you want a great abs workout, my advice to you would be to try Turbo Jam! You'll get defined abs in no time!",1173312000,8,1178,4.113043478260869
2692194,5,B000KJTFES,"In my opinion, this was the best workout in the Crunch Series. I bought 5 different videos and loved this one the most. There are 3 targeted body areas. All the workouts feel like legitimate workouts. The host smiles a ton and is super fun to follow along. Definitely a great workout video for the bottom or ""booteh"" as the host says. Enjoy!",1358380800,,341,4.428571428571429
2692195,5,B000KJTFES,"I'm surprised at what some of the other reviews have said! While I don't work out consistently, I try to work out about 3 times a week when possible, and I find this workout challenging!

This video is a great combination of dance, traditional isolation moves, and cardio. I was surprised at how much my heart rate increased throughout the video, and the dance-like moves of the cardio parts of each section were a nice bonus for someone who enjoys dancing for exercise. You can really feel the isolation moves the next day.

I do agree that this is a better lower body workout - your legs and butt will be sore the next day with all those jumping lunges - but the ab workout is still good. You won't feel your abs the next day, but they will burn while you do the workout.

The instructor at first appears to be someone who will quickly become annoying, but is actually quite likeable with plenty of pep but not too much.

Overall, this is one of my favorite new workouts. It gives me everything I want from a workout, and I highly recommend it.",1329004800,,1046,4.376288659793815
2692196,3,B000KJTFES,"I really wanted to like this workout and tried it a couple times.  There are alot of lunges in this workout, which is fine - the problem is that she moves through it so quick and proper form can get compromised. I do like the idea of incorporating workout moves (squats, lunges) with dance moves into one workout but it could have been done a little better, so I don't feel like I'm going to injure myself.  I may try this workout one more time though.",1303171200,,452,4.244186046511628
2692197,5,B000KJTFES,"When I was really heavy, My mom had this dvd sitting in her closet collecting dust. I was curious about it so I popped it in the DVD player and bam! It changed my life. I lost 15 1bs in a month and a half ( sorry had a a few setbacks) but it was fun, time conscious, and my favorite move was the Beyonce :)",1290988800,,306,3.6515151515151514
2692198,3,B000KJTFES,"Well I purchased thinking it would really focus on the butt and thigh. It does but minimal, I feel no workout from it, besides getting my heart beat racing. When I first worked out to it, I thought what a waste of money, but after a few times using it I work out to it because I only have 2 workout videos that focus on those areas. I do not recommend it for a great workout, but yet a cardio and dance routine. The abs workout isn't even worth it. A little disappointed.",1234828800,2,471,4.075268817204301
2692199,1,B000KJTFES,"It is a shame that this is in the workout section.  If you are used to doing anything remotely active you will not consider this a real or even fake workout.  While you may think it is fun, so it playing catch with your dog and you will get the same result.  Don't waste your money if you are in any way physically active and looking for a quick sweat.",1213833600,8,352,4.0
2692200,3,B000KJTFES,This is a fun workout and really like the instructor's personality -- but this isn't much of a workout after you do it a few times -- you quickly plateau and doesn't become very challenging anymore. Maybe more suited to beginners than intermediate and advanced exercisers. Great for people who enjoy dance though as the routines are dance inspired.,1213228800,3,348,4.915254237288136
2692201,5,B000KJTFES,"I am a former ballet/jazz dancer and absolutely LOVE this workout.  To be honest if you do not have good coordination this is not the workout for you. I also have the Crunch Belly, Butt, and Thighs workout with Teri Ann.  I recommend Bikini Body for the more coordinated, high energy work out and Belly, Butt, and Thighs for the less coordinated.  Both work the same muscle groups.",1210032000,6,381,4.573529411764706
2692202,5,B000KJTFES,So much fun..... you forget your working out! Shes very bubbly keeps you motivated. Dance & hip hop moves get you going. Overall awesome.. I do this workout everday!,1208908800,3,165,4.724137931034483
2692203,5,B000KJTFES,I love the belly and thighs segments the best! Lena incoporates dance moves into the workout so it makes it alot of fun! I can't go one day without doing this workout!,1202860800,5,167,4.25
8157437,5,B000KJTFES,"I love all the Crunch workouts, Bikini Bod is no exception. Very fun workout.",1493769600,,77,4.571428571428571
8157438,5,B000KJTFES,"I love Bikini Body!! I have actually bought it 3 times because I keep losing it. Lena walks you through 3 15-minute workouts to work your belly, butt, and thighs. I love how encouraging she is the whole time! You can choose to do all 3 workouts, which I usually do, or just focus on one area. She modifies some of the exercises to make them easier, if you are just starting out. This video isn't as intense as Insanity or P90X, but you can hold weights while you do it if you need something more challenging. I love Lena! I seriously wish she would come be my personal trainer.",1448323200,,577,4.254545454545455
8157439,5,B000KJTFES,"Great exercise video. Only 30 minutes but really works out the three areas!!! Butt, Belly and Thighs",1428537600,,100,4.9411764705882355
8157440,5,B000KJTFES,as described,1424217600,,12,5.5
8157441,5,B000KJTFES,My favorite new workout! I hesitated for years on buying this & I 'm so glad I finally got it! I can't dance to save my life but the cueing is great & easy to follow. The ab section is effective (probably not for an advanced exerciser) but a perfect for me. I needed a 30 minute workout to do before work and before my toddlers wake up to start my day and I actually like doing this & I break a good sweat. I would feel silly doing this in front of anyone but it makes me feel kind of sexy. A keeper for me :),1401926400,,509,3.7663551401869158
8157442,2,B000KJTFES,I did not like this workout. Workout itself is ok. Did not care for the instructor and didn't think it was that easy to follow.,1400976000,,127,4.12
8157443,3,B000KJTFES,"The moves were awkward and hard to follow. The instructor jumps right in and doesn't give you much time to figure out what she's doing. Maybe after trying this workout several times I could figure it out and do everything correctly, but on my first viewer I was constantly lost.",1391558400,,278,4.58
8157444,5,B000KJTFES,"I love this DVD!  I'm a big fan of the Crunch videos, but this is one of my favorites.  You can easily personalize your work depending on how much time you have available and what areas you want to focus one.  Lena is energetic without being too peppy, and moves quick enough that you don't get brunt put on a move before you're on to the next step.  It's well worth trying out - you won't regret it.",1383177600,,400,4.089743589743589
8157445,5,B000KJTFES,This workout is fun and very enjoyable.  Great for anyone who likes to have fun while they get fit.  Definitely a keeper.,1373068800,,121,4.454545454545454
8157446,2,B000KJTFES,"I was very excited when I ordered this DVD, thinking I would finally have the motivation I needed to get in shape for Summer. However, to my disappointment, I found this particular DVD to be at a somewhat ""advanced level. I was hoping for something a beginner like myself could keep up with. Unfortunately, the steps were too quick and never properly broken down so that I could learn them at a slower pace. It would be a fine exercise tool for someone used to dance aerobics, but for me the moves felt odd. I would've loved to be able to pop this DVD in every morning and exercise along with it, but it's just out of my reach- as I do not want to have to watch it 30 times just to figure out the steps, then put them into action. I do however consider myself a fast learner, but ultimately it just wasn't what I was looking for.",1370131200,2,829,4.1875
