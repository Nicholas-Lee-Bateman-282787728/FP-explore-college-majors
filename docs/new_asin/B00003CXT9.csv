1287008,5,B00003CXT9,"just saw this movie...and i was pretty impressed with it i loved the previous mummy film and i think the special effects in this one(as in the original)are outstanding,no matter what some reviewers might say.
i also think that brendan fraser is going to be the new action film star and i've always thought he should take over the role of indiana jones(harrison ford is getting a little old for it).
in closing,go see the mummy returns...and when it comes out on dvd,buy it...i know i will!",989020800,,489,4.632183908045977
1287009,4,B00003CXT9,"If you like non-stop action and great special effects then 'The Mummy Returns' is worth watching. Wrestling fans will be pleased to see 'The Rock' cast as the Scorpion King. Female fans of Oded Fehr, the Israeli actor, will be delighted to see him cast again as the dashing Egyptian horseman and fighter Ardeth Bay.
Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser) and Evie (Rachel Weisz) are married in this sequel and have a young son who does a good job of keeping the villains on their toes. Evie is supposed to be a reincarnation of Nefertiti, the Pharaoh's daughter. Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo), the Pharaoh's high priest, and Anck-Su-Namun (Patricia Velazquez), the priest's paramour, are brought back to life to fight the Scorpion King and take control of the army of Anoubis, the dark god of the underworld.
Some movie buffs have expressed reservations about the historical inaccuracies in both 'The Mummy' and 'The Mummy Returns'. However, these inaccuracies are not offensive to Egyptian Culture. This movie is merely a work of fiction. Some scenes and dialogs may seem to be cliched. Several scenes are a rehash of 'The Mummy'. The characters in the movie jokingly admit to the 'same old end of the world' plot.
Even with all its cliches, this movie is worth watching.",989020800,22,1259,4.915492957746479
1287010,4,B00003CXT9,"This was a truly entertaining movie, and that's what Summer flicks are all about.  I'll start off by saying this, if your a fan of The Rock, and not a fan of the first Mummy, don't waste your time and money.  He's in it for an estimated seven minutes altogether, and the ending is a CGI created Scorpion King.  Your best bet is to just wait for ""The Scorpion King"" to come out next summer.
The plot lacked in certain places, and seemed to have many subplots for a while there.  But I didn't hold any grudges considering the first one didn't exaclty have an Oscar-caliber screenplay.  This time around, there are a few editions to the initial cast, mainly Rick's(Brendan Fraser) and Evie's(Rachel Weisz) little boy, Alex, and Meela/Anck-Su-Namun.  Of course there's others but those are the two main additions other than The Scorpion King.  The funniest new ""bit"" addition is Izzy.  I don't want to spoil it all for you, so I'll try not to give too much away.  The trailor itself does a pretty good job of explaining the principle plot.  Returning are Imhotep(the evil Mummy, played by Arnold Vosloo), Jonathon, who always makes me laugh, Ardeth Bay(Oded Fehr), the Medjai priest, probably my favorite character, and of course Rick and Evie.  The character's are very interesting, and although there's not a great deal of devolopment, they keep you intrigued and entertained the whole time.
If your wondering, is The Mummy Returns better than The Mummy, I can't answer that for you.  Lately, I've watched The Mummy so many times to get ready for The Mummy Returns, it's lost a lot of meaning to me.  But the action scenes in the sequel were much cooler.  My favorites are the sword fights between Ardeth Bay and the Big Black Man(I wish I could remember a name), and the sai fights between Evie/Neferitirri and Meela/Anck-Su-Namun.  The Rock even has a pretty cool battle scene at the very begining.  Even though the Special F/X are damn cool to watch, the battle scenes between the real people are cooler to watch because of the understanding of what all the actors had to endure.  I'm not knocking the special F/X because there's an awesome battle scene between the Medjai and The Army of Annubis.
All in all, The Mummy Returns is an awesome action flick with a few humorous anecdotes.  The only thing that really didn't please me was the ending because seeing a battle scene between Imhotep, O'Connel, and The King would have been amazing.  If you liked The Mummy at all, you must check this out because it's a fun and entertaining movie just like the first one was.  If you want my personal oppinion, you should check it out because it's the epitome of a Summer movie.",989020800,6,2671,4.666666666666667
1287011,4,B00003CXT9,"With the tremendous financial success of Stephen Sommers' film ""The Mummy,"" a sequel was inevitable. And here it is: ""The Mummy Returns."" Writer/director Sommers also returns, together with most of the cast from the first romp: Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, etc. The film has its strengths and weaknesses, but succeeds as flashy, escapist entertainment.
The film takes place about 9 years after the first one; the hero and heroine are now married, with a resourceful young son (well-played by Freddie Boath). The villains of this story plan to resurrect Imhotep--the mummy of the title--hoping that he can defeat an equally fearsome character known as the Scorpion King. Fraser and friends get caught in the middle of this clash of the undead.
Pro wrestler Dwayne Johnson, better known by his stage name ""The Rock,"" plays the Scorpion King. I liked his performance in the role, although his screen time is quite limited. Considering the hype over this character before the film's release, the Scorpion King could be seen as the Darth Maul of the summer 2001 movie season. In my opinion, the best performance in the film is given by Oded Fehr, who reprises his original ""Mummy"" role as a dashing Arab warrior-priest. The charismatic Fehr brings a subtle passion to his character. And the best relationship in the film is between Fehr's character and his messenger hawk.
I didn't buy the subplot involving reincarnation, past-life memories, and a tattoo. And some of the action scenes seemed to be ripped off from other films (be particularly alert for a ""Jurassic Park II"" rip-off scene). But overall, I found ""The Mummy Returns"" to be an entertaining popcorn flick: a good mix of action, humor, special effects, and mythic flourishes.",989020800,7,1734,5.045296167247387
1287012,5,B00003CXT9,This movie fulfills the most basic goal of a film. It entertains. It is a true horror film in the Universal sense that  it doesn't take itself that seriously. Neither should the viewer. There are no messages or high lofty goals at work here. It takes all of the story of the first mummy and moves on with itself and doesn't look back too much. You are going to want to check you reality at the door with your coat and just sit back and enjoy the show.,988934400,,451,4.125
1287013,4,B00003CXT9,"Scropion King was one of the greatest warrior around 3300 B.C., after his army was defeated at Thebes, he made a deal with Anubis, he gave up his sould for the command of Anubis' army to destroy his enemies.  The legend states that whoever bring the Scorpion King back and kills him, that person will be able to take control of that army or send it back to the underworld.  Imhotep has been resurrected once again and is after that power, it's up to the O'Connells once more to foil his plan and to save the world from destruction!
Ok, I admit the plot isn't new or original, but director Stephen Sommers was able to make the experience a fun and enjoyable one, with bigger action and lots of special effects eye candies, this is certainly a promising start to the 2001 summer blockbuster.  Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser) and Evelyn Carnahan (Rachel Weisz) are married now, living in London with their first born son Alex (Freddie Boath.)  This time the love between Rick and Evie is much more believable, Rachel's portrayl of Evie is as lovely as ever, and with a tad more dangerous aspects to her personality, the writer decided to give her character a twist in the development, and an interesting one to say the least.  Brendan retained the Rick's charm from the first movie, still adventurous and dashing as ever.  Freddie did a great job for his age, he was able to demonstrate the subtle strength within Alex, his character combined the calm and smarts of Evie with the curious and quick thinking of Rick.
John Hannah reprised his role as Jonathan Carnahan, a coward who squandered away his money trying to impress women, he wanted to become much more than the greedy side that's shows up more often than not, but Johnathan wanted to be strong when needed to be and he'll get the opportunities to demonstrate that courage.  Rounding out the supporting cast are Ardeth Bay (Oded Fehr), Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo) and Ancksunamun (Patricia Velazquez.)
Even though The Mummy Returns is often predictable and at times unbelievable, the audiences are reminded again and again that this is a fun movie, don't take it too seriously and you'll definitely enjoy it much more.  Seems to me that the summer is off to a good start, and I'll see you when the Shrek opens in two weeks.",988934400,7,2275,4.67
1287014,5,B00003CXT9,"If you have a chance to see this movie and you liked the first one, I would highly recommend seeing it. It is 10 times better than the first one. The inter mixing of parts from the first move, into this one is great, you will have a full understanding of both movies.
It is a must see. I thought that the Special effects where great and the story line (which one) is fantastic..

1287016,4,B00003CXT9,"Again, like the first film this is mostly a fun-ride popcorn movie.  If you want to see an arthouse peice, please go elsewhere and given your knowledge of the previous film, please don't act surprised when you go see this film and learn that it is just a fun, action filled follow up to the fun action filled original Mummy.  A few things are different:  Evie is more mature, which is an interesting change. She has a kid, who is not as obnoxious as Anakin Sywalker was in Star Wars, thank goodness.  O'Connel, Jonathan and Imoteph are basically the same.  Again, these aren't character driven artsy-fartsy films, so go to see lots of cool, CGI enhanced battles with stange looking creatures and fun things like that.  If that makes you happy, you'll be satisfied.",988934400,,764,4.664179104477612
1287017,1,B00003CXT9,"I detested the first Mummy, with it's slapstick comedy, almost non-existent story, and really bad CGI effects. However, I decided to keep an open mind about The Mummy Returns, after all I liked Deep Rising by Stephen Sommers, so maybe he could make a good movie about mummies. Alas I was wrong. The Mummy Returns is boring, tedious, and lacks any of the wit the origional had. The fight scenes are slow and don't generate any real thrills. The CGI effects are cartoonish and hokey. And most of all the movie lacks a really good story. It was mearly a sequence of fight scenes linked with monotonous one liners. Instead of a story with some meat on it, we are given, in true Hollywood form, bigger and better special effects, lots of fightin' with guns 'n knives, and an annoying wise cracking child (Frasier and Weisz's son). Frasier and Weisz don't even seem like parents in the movie, as no real emotion is generated betweeen them and their son, quite frankly no real emotion is generated at all in this film.  This movie is in the same vein as the Indiana Jones trilogy, and the Jurrasic Park movies,as they had action and suspense, with some scares scattered about. Yet the Mummy Returns fails in every attempt to recreate the thrills those movies produced. The fx in those movies were there to further the story, here they are used to fill in the thin plot. The Mummy builds it's story around what can be made in a computer. The fx don't help the story along at all, what they really do is come of as forced, and overpower the character development, and storytelling. If the story wasn't so weak this would not have been a problem, in my opinion the fx really hinder this film. Unfortunatly this movie will make tons of cash, so Hollywood will keep churning out this stuff, and America will eat it up, as they do every summer. This film wastes the talent of the cast, crew, and director, which is too bad.",988848000,7,1910,4.520231213872832

1287532,5,B00003CXT9,"The Mummy returns, and so do Rick O'Connell, Evy and the gang from the first film. ""The Mummy Returns"" is essentially the first film, but more involved and bigger. Better monsters, crazier action, bigger setpieces, bigger soundtrack. And it's worth it. The cast is really fantastic, as in the first, and that totally helps. The basic idea is that the Scorpion King of Khemet (ancient Egypt) has awakened after a few thousand years and is back to conquer the world and look great shirtless. Rick and Evy are now legitimate archaeologists at this point, Imhotep is back for some reason, and the Scorpion King is looking for a way to open a gate to... no one cares, actually. There's a sweet car chase, mummified mini cannibals and jackal soldiers, a beat-up blimp that's actually a super-cool way to travel, and a lot of other great stuff. The film sweeps grandly from one gorgeous action sequence on a huge set to the next, and Alan Silvestri, the composer who's known for Marvel movies, sweeps the audience up and along for the ride with a rich orchestral score of rumbling drums and warmly humming strings. ""The Mummy Returns"" has the propensity to be a dumb-fun B-movie but the care and talent that went into it elevates it above that. It's the second part of the trilogy that really helps introduce the viewer to the definitive over-the-top awesomeness of the third, a film that failed with reviewers mainly because some involved failed to pull their weight despite the blood, sweat, and tears put into it by the rest, but that's in my review for the film itself.

1287673,2,B00003CXT9,"I recently traipsed down memory lane and rewatched the first Mummy which was thoroughly enjoyable so I figured I'd rewatch the second one. I immediately regretted my decision. The movie may have been fun when I was a kid, but it's pretty awful now. Any of the great advancements cgi made in the first movie was reused here but to a less masterful degree. Some of the mummy's movements are clunky. And the reusing of all the last film's fun only lessens the potential of this film. Fraser's near Indy of the last film is less rugged and more worn this time around that you can actually see the ""acting"" taking place in him as well as everyone around him who are all tryin to take it seriously but can't seem to stop rolling their eyes between each take. So save yourself from this and just rewatch the first one again.",1457913600,,817,4.417218543046357

1288125,5,B00003CXT9,"I will keep this short, as this is the blu-ray release of a movie released in 2000.  If you loved the first one, you're going to love this one.  Brendan Frasier and Rachel Weisz reprise their roles as Rick and Evelyn.  This movie takes place 10 years after the first Mummy, and there is a lot of familiar in the early-going, but after the half hour mark, everything is new and fresh and a lot of fun.  The action set pieces are perfect, there is just the right blend of tension, comedy, and action.  I love the pacing for this movie, and it's a great Saturday Afternoon flick.  The Blu-Ray copy transitioned over nicely.  The Oasis looks magnificent and all the colors pop as you would expect them to.

My only problem with the movie is how horridly dated the CG is.  For me personally, it adds to the charm of the movie, I simply love it that much.  If you're new to the series, and appreciate good CG in movies, some of the effects may be more distracting than beneficial to the movie.  That said, I think the Majority of the effects have aged decently.  If you love movies with an Indiana Jones feel, but with a slightly faster pace, Mummy Returns is a great film to enjoy!",1423872000,11,1176,4.319634703196347

1288404,5,B00003CXT9,"In the first movie, if you never liked mummy's before, your gonna love them now...honestly ""The Mummy"" movies in this series were the best, I can not think of any other type of good movie that included mummy's or one I even wanted to watch for that matter....
I saw the first one when I was a kid and it was awesome and being a HUGE wrestling fan also as a kid when The Mummy Returns came out and has The Rock as the Scorpion King I had to see it in theatre's asap...now years later, I founf the VHS I had laying around and watch it and it is still as good as watching for the first time..
...
I don't know what it is about these movies but they are so awesome I could just keep watching them over and over, this movie is special because it was actually ""The Rock"" (Dwayne Johnson) first movie, and now we all know him as a huge big time movie star, so big that in GIjoe2 they killed the main character Duke in the beginning so The Rock's character could star and be the main character (Made me hate the movie by the way and proly won't ever see another gijoe movie now)..
Not just special for the Rock but for his character mostly, The Scorpion King, here is where you see an awesome origin story of the Scorpion King and his army, how he made a deal to live longer then the god of onibus takes him as a servant and wants to take over the world or whatever...ect..ect...
Emotion was great, the end which wife will save the husband was just classic..
And even when they made the movie The Scorpion King after this, that was awesome to see Scorpion King becoming King, when he was a good guy before making the deal with onibus.. then they screwed it up with scorpion king 2 and 3 which were horrible, didn't have the rock in them, looked like totally different people wrote, directed and produced...then the next mummy movie came out with jet lee in it which wasn't really as good as the first one's, I hated that they replaced the actress that was oconar's wife int he third one, there was still something there but bot nearly as good as the first 2 movie's were.",1402617600,,2063,4.212121212121212

1288472,4,B00003CXT9,Everytime the movie is on TV I have to watch.  It is one of my favorites.  Definitely worth the rental.,1398556800,,103,4.1
1288473,4,B00003CXT9,"This is the follow up to the 1999 movie.  In a rare feat (one that would not be repeated in the last movie of the trilogy) the entire cast and crew from the first movie returned for this one.  This helped the movie retain some continuity from the first film, even though it really expanded on the story.  While there were some elements from the first movie tied into this one, it was not just a carbon copy of the first one.

The movie is set 10 years after the first movie.  The Mummy is resurrected in order to kill the Scorpion King (played by The Rock in his first movie role) and of course the events pull the now married Rick and Evie O'Connell along with their son, and her brother Jonathan.  Oded Fehr and Patricia Velasquez also return and are given much more to do and are involved much more in the overall plot in this movie. Rachel Weisz was given more action scenes, including a sai fight in a barely there outfit against Patricia Velasquez about halfway into the movie, and another one at the end.  She was much more of an action heroine in this movie than she was in the first.  Which ultimately is good, although the plot twist through which that happened was kind of silly.

Like was the case with the first movie this one is very special effects laden as well.  There are new creatures from the first one and the effects, while not as good as they would be today, are slightly improved from the first film.  Although the CGI characters still look quite cartoonish in this movie  If you are one of those who only want to see it because The Rock is in it (which was probably more of an issue when it was released in theaters and he was at the height of his WWF/WWE fame) he is really only in the move a total of about 15 min.  5 at the beginning in the flesh, and about 10 at the end as a dumb CGI creature.  I think it would have been much better to have him resurrected and essentially have a three way battle between the main characters at the end.

As far as extras go, there is a commentary track for the movie.  A 20 min making of feature.  A three min interview with The Rock which was actually done for the spin off Scorpion King movie, and a short feature on the visual effects along with a few other things. Ultimately whether you like this or not depend on your feelings about the first movie.  If you hated the first one, then you will likely hate this one too.  If you liked or loved the first one, you will at least like this.as well.",1395446400,,2464,4.2042553191489365

1288929,2,B00003CXT9,"Now, I hear everybody bashing the third installment of ""The Mummy"" trilogy, but I'll have to say that I think the third one: ""The Mummy: The Tomb of the Dragon Emperor"" is actually more enjoyable and more action worthy than this second installment.

I had defended the third movie a few years ago because everyone was complaining about it. Mainly, because Rachel Weisz was replaced by Maria Bello, but it still had a more refreshing story than this second installment.

In fact, I don't think I'd shed a tear if I were to just give this movie away, and maybe the third one too, and just keep the first one. Some trilogies just don't make the grade. Now, when I look at ""The Scorpion King"" Trilogy, I find that I like the second movie ""Rise of a Warrior"", better than the first and the third film in that trilogy. I think because actress Karen David brought alot of appeal to the film.

Anyway, I just finished watching this Blu-ray of ""The Mummy Returns"" today.  I believe I started it over and over again over the past few days because it seemed to bore me to tears, and then, made me fall asleep and continue to miss things. I'm actually graciously disgruntled enough about this movie ""The Mummy Returns"" to where I doubt I'd ever pop it in my Blu-Ray player again.

1289076,3,B00003CXT9,"This movie is inferior to the first entry in the series. I know it's not like that was a really serious film that should have had a complicated story continuation, but it didn't deserve to be retreaded and contradicted. It's like the filmmakers sort of went ""If people liked that, we'll just do more of the same thing,"" and didn't bother to remember what elements stuck out as good in The Mummy.

On the plus side, the visual effects in this movie are even better. While there are some too-silly moments and unnecessary comic relief characters (annoying little kid and the balloon pilot), there are also really kickass action highs and development of the stars from the first movie. If you liked The Mummy at all then you should see this at least once, but unlike that movie I wouldn't call it a must-own for the action-adventure fan.",1346198400,,834,4.635135135135135

1289078,4,B00003CXT9,We watched this as a family and felt it was better and more family oriented than the first movie that was darker and grosser in its mummy character.  The character of the son makes this more of a family pick.  He was cast well and was a good mini hero.  We loved seeing the famous Egyptian sites and will use this as a good excuse to look them up to learn more.  It was a little long for our Saturday evening movie but it was good enough that we didn't mind relaxing the bedtimes.  We didn't particularly like that there was so much skin showing but I guess this makes the movie appealing to wider audiences.  We plan to watch the Scorpion King movie soon.,1341273600,,656,4.208
1289079,3,B00003CXT9,"This movie, wow. I really wanted to, and still do want to try to like this movie. There were three major stories going on this movie, as well as the little side plot with the o'conells son wearing the bracelet of anubis. Now one question, If Evey is Nefertiti reincarnated. Why wasn't that even mentioned slightly in the first movie, I did like the involvement of the Scorpion king. And actually wished he had been the main bad guy of this movie, instead we get imhotep again. Now Arnold Vosloo did an incredible job as Imhotep in the first one, but you stripped him of his powers and shoved him the ""pool"" and buried him beneath humanaptra. Basically killing him off, but nooooooooooooo, lets bring back his reincarnated girlfriend. She digs him up, but wait, evey's been having strange dreams. Oh I forgot the 4th major story, Rick is a Madji. That's right, he's a warrior for God, as said by Ardeth Bay. Yep, we get a fight at the end between the scorpion king Imhotep, and Rick. Wait... evey's been killed but Her son brings her back to life, with the help of Johnathan, in a replica scene of the ending to the first movie. Well never fear, Rick does kill the scorpion king. Sending him to hell along with Anubis's army, Oh. Halfway through the movie, Ardeth Bay tells rick. That he is a madji, and to prove it, Tells Evey that she's Nefertiti reincarnated, and that Rick is a Reincarnated protector of sorts. Yeeeeeeeeeah, they should've just stuck with the Scorpion King. They still could have had the Mummy pygmies which are hilarious, and Rick could've battled the Scorpion King and won. Too much going on, with villains that should have been left dead. A decent movie, yes I own it, but only for the collections sake. Could've been better.",1327708800,,1748,4.587859424920127
1289080,5,B00003CXT9,"Loved this movie.  Usually sequels are not as good as the first show, but this is an exception.  I enjoyed it as much, if not more than The Mummy.  You learn more about the characters' history in this show and their characters are fleshed out.  The story itself is as good as the first, with new evils and characters to keep you on the edge of your seat at times, and the mix of suspense and humor is there.

At the end, when Dwayne Johnson's character appears, there is a bit of a problem since CG human faces are still rather hard today, but definitely imperfect back in 2001, but on the whole, the special effects don't distract and do their job quite well. The characters are charming enough and the action fun and frenetic enough that you can forgive a little slip-up in the special effects from time to time.
A good watch and a fun movie.
[slight spoiler]
I do find it a little forced that they decided to make Evy the reincarnation of an ancient Egyptian princess. Largely I think they were trying to find a way to give her character more importance in the story. I don't have a problem with wanting to do that, but this reincarnation thing just felt a little kludged. Not so much, however, to make the movie unenjoyable.",1296864000,,1008,4.5136612021857925

Again, we have people (though this time intentionally though, besides to raise the Army of Anubis, why they really want him to kill the Scorpion King, except for the reincarnated Anck-su-namun, is never explained). And again, he must suck the life out the people who opened his chest, though again intentionally compared to the first film and it isn't as long and drawn out. Though I must say, in the end, I feel a little sympathy for Imhotep as his love, the only reason for him to live, abandons him. Kudos to Arnold Vosloo for that little moment. Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz are back again as well and still have an amazing chemistry (which you can tell when Evelyn dies and Rick is heartbroken over it). This time, they're married and have a son named Alex, whose not as annoying as some of the other kids in movies I've reviewed. Must be something about the new millenium that all of a sudden, kids can act. John Hannah is also back and is still the comedic relief but the character comes into his own I think when he fights Anck-su-namun for his sister and recreates the scene from the first film while Alex reads from the Book of the Dead. Oded Fehr and Patricia Velsquez also return from the first film though I find Velsquez' character a little annoying at times though she is a legitimate threat towards her enemies and then loving towards Imhotep (until the end), so the actress really knows how to switch emotions when called for (unlike some actresses I could name). The action sequences are executed really well. The double-decker chase/fight, the pygmies (a scary yet funny scene at the same time) and the fight with Anubis' army being my favorite sequences as you can hardly tell that CGI is going on.

1289271,1,B00003CXT9,"The Mummy Returns is pretty much a disaster on every front.

Unlike the first picture, which made generous but sensible use of computer-generated animations, this one seems dominated and finally over-powered by its effects. As a result, while the first movie was always anchored in the real world, this one feels strangely adrift.

It also has too many expendable characters--none of them with the goofy appeal of cowardly bad guy Benny from the first movie--and, critically, it lacks any clear exposition to explain the whys and wherefores. I often had trouble keeping track of who was doing what and why. We have no sense of why the O'Connells are exploring the ruins at the outset. (They should have started the story at home with one of the wife's dreams). The movie backs into its story.

The principals have acquired a roughly 10-year-old son, but O'Connell looks exactly as he did in the first movie and Evie actually looks more movie-star-ish and glamorous. There's also NO sense of attachment to the little boy, except when the script forces it down our throats. I never got the sense that they were part of the same family.

And, very often, there is no sense of moment in this movie. As often happens in movies these days, the fillmmakers seem to know what they want to do in individual scenes but not how to fit it all together. For instance, Evie has a huge past-life fight in her head while aboard the balloon in the movie's later stages, and then matter of factly lets the rest of the party in on it. Their blithe acceptance works to negate the entire prior scene. The Mummy's lover's spirit enters its reincarnated body--an otherwordly scene in the first movie--and the Mummy here reacts as though she'd just turned up late for a date.",1249862400,3,1751,4.712418300653595

This is more slash and burn style archeology without the gore of an Indiana Jones film.  Some of the effects in this show were a little too much--in particular, the pygmy mummies were a real stretch of suspension of disbelief.

1289662,5,B00003CXT9,"Sequels are tough to do because you know what to expect so filmmaker's often have to give you that plus something unexpected. Bigger and better may not always translate to better but it often translates to a sequel that is the equal of the film that spawned it. I'm going to assume that you've seen it (if not there's a critical bit at the end of this along with a plot synposis that is as sketchy as possible so as not to spoil the experience of the film) and focus on why you should buy the upgraded Blu-ray. As good as ""The Mummy Returns"" looks on DVD, the Blu-ray is even better looking. Colors are bolder and there's signficantly more detail but, more important, the dark scenes look much better here. The lossless audio sounds terrific as well and will put you right in the middle of the action.

You should be aware however that Edge Enhancement is more noticeable in the BR than it was in the HD-DVD disc or the DVD and there is a fair amount of digital noise reduction applied to reduce grain in certain scenes. What does that mean? It means that we do lose some detail.

Be aware, however, that the extras are in 480p and NOT in HD. Universal does port over U-Control (which was developed for HD-DVD) where you can customize special features on the BD disc. We get all the extras from the original single disc set plus the new extras from the 2 disc DVD ported over to the BD. ""The Mummy Returns"" is nicely packaged in a colorful slipcase (although I think they could have done without this). At Best Buy and Circuit City (as well as select other retailers there is also movie cash included. You have to go online and register so you can print out your movie ticket (which is good only through 8/24/08 and the site which was up earlier for access to print your ticket now requires you to wait until 8/1/08. I guess some people used their tickets early for other movies or Universal is doing this as a precautionary move).

""The Mummy Returns"" is less of a scary horror flick than its predecessor and even more like a ""Raiders"" type of flick. A perfect popcorn movie, Stephen Sommers takes the same ingredients (evil mummy resurrected, adventurers seeking artifacts and fortunes, supernatural powers)and creates a film that is every bit as fun as the first film was. Like ""Aliens"" relationship with ""Alien"", ""The Mummy Returns"" focuses on taking characters we knew from the first film and putting them in a slightly different context this time around.

SOME SPOILERS:

Rick (Brendan Fraiser)and Evie (Rachel Weisz)now have a 9 year old son Alex(Freddie Boath)and are still digging in dusty old tombs in Egypt. The year of the Scorpion has arrived which means that if Baltus (Alun Armstrong) and the reincarnation of Im-Ho-Tep's (Arnold Vosloo)love Meela-Nais (Patricia Velasquez returning from the first film in a much larger role) can raise Im-Ho-Tep he can take on the Scorpion King (The Rock) Im-Ho-Tep can use the armies of the underworld to rule the world.

But there is some true humor here listening to the director commentary and how clueless he is to just how horid this film is.

This new Deluxe Edition of The Mummy Returns includes most of the special features from the 2001 Collector's Edition, plus some new features.  It will only be available in widescreen format.

The Mummy left most professional reviewers cool to lukewarm at best, and this, the first sequel, left them cold.  But audiences still enjoyed it.

For some reason I thought the special effects were....worse in this movie. Not sure if the same studio created the effects for both films, but this one looked worse (to me).  The Scorpion King (with the Rock's face) looks completely unbelievable.

Also, the relationship the two ""parents"" had with the son was laughable (not in a good way).  They didn't even act like they loved him, and he was pretty much in danger the whole last half of the movie.  Just shoddy acting.

They've even brought their eight year old son Alex (Freddie Boath) along for the ride.  They're hear because of a bunch of strange dreams Evy has been having.  Exploring the tomb, they find the bracelet of the Scorpion King (The Rock).

Unfortunately, they aren't the only people looking for it.  A group of diggers has found the mummy of Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo).  They intend to revive him and allow him to kill the Scorpion King, thereby allowing him to control the Scorpion King's army and rule the Earth.  But, in order to do all that, they need the bracelet.

Which is why the O'Connells are attacked when they return home to London.  And since Alex has just put the bracelet on, he becomes a target.  Joining forces with Evy's brother Jonathan (John Hannah) and Magi Ardeth Bay (Oded Fehr), they set out to save the world again.  But in this race again time, will they win?

Having been a surprised fan of the first, I was looking forward to the second.  I was disappointed the first time around, but a second viewing made me see it with new eyes.  The plot, while a little complicated, is actually more original then I gave it credit for being.  It definitely starts faster then the original did.  The story actually holds together well and the acting is fine.  Once again, this really isn't a horror movie but an action flick with super natural elements.

Having said that, I do have definite problems with this movie.  The introduction of the reincarnation back story still makes me roll my eyes.  It might help explain why everyone from the first film is back, but it slows the movie down at times, too.  The computer effects aren't up to par either.  There were so many of them it grew quite distracting.  Finally, I loved the jokes and wise cracks of the first, but this one doesn't have the same comedic flare.

I'm surprising myself by saying this sequel isn't bad.  But it isn't great either.  If you haven't seen it, you aren't missing much, but if you liked the first you'll be glad you gave this one a try.",1201478400,4,2182,4.528205128205128

1289816,3,B00003CXT9,"""The Mummy Returns"" is the bigger and flashier sequel to 1999's ""The Mummy"", itself a very nicely updated homage to the Boris Karloff classic horror movie.  The good news is that the excellent cast of ""The Mummy"" has returned for the sequel.  Unfortunately, bigger and flashier special effects do not quite make up for a lack of originality; ""The Mummy Returns"" is entertaining but ultimately disappointing.

The movie begins with the retelling of the legend of the Scorpion King, played by the Rock, who vanished in ancient times but can be revived by the right magic.  Flash forward to the present of 1933, where Rick (Brendan Fraser) and Evie (Rachel Weisz) have married, raised eight year old son Alex, and found some key Scorpion King relicts.  Evie's never-do-well brother Jonathan (John Hannah) attracts the attention of a mysterious group that wants to resurrect the Scorpion King using a special bracelet.  In a chaotic attack on the O'Connell home, son Alex, wearing the bracelet, is kidnapped.  The remainder of the movie is a series of set-piece action sequences as Rick, Evie, and their allies race the bad guys back to the City of the Dead to prevent the resurrection.

The special effects are spectacular, and there is plenty of excitement as our heroes dodge death and disaster at every step.  Unfortunately, there really isn't much plot here, and the finale looks a lot like an expensive remake of the finale of the first movie.

This movie is recommended to those who didn't see the first movie and won't mind the redo.",1194393600,,1537,4.876923076923077
1289817,2,B00003CXT9,"I've learned that the sequel to a blockbuster hit is always risky business - especially if that film was a well-crafted film to begin with. Many such attempts have failed miserably, while rare cases have been worthy follow-ups. The much-anticipated sequel to Stephen Sommers' ""The Mummy"" lies somewhere in-between those two categories. ""The Mummy Returns"" is indeed an entertaining film that'll have you laughing hard and keeping you on the edge of your seat. But as a film of intelligence and integrity, it falls short in almost every way.

In the featurette found under the Special Features of this set, Stephen Sommers confesses that he is a great fan of everything Egypt. However, I find this statement highly ironic considering the fact that the underlying plot of ""The Mummy Returns"" degrades the very heritage of Egyptian mythology. Long ago, a defeated desert warrior, the Scorpion King, made a pact with the dark god Anubis. Together, the two defeated the Scorpion King's enemies, but Anubis subsequently made the Scorpion King his slave and his army fell dormant. If you'll look into Egyptian mythology, Anubis is the god of the dead, who prepares the dead for the afterlife and takes them to the Hall of Judgement; he was never an evil god. To see him presented in such a mutated form as he appears in this film is nothing short of sacrilege to me. Perhaps Sommers was thinking of the god Set (who wasn't even always evil in the Egyptians' book). Either way, I set into this movie with a feeling of anger, not anticipation.

The rest of the movie proves to be as short on plot as the opening scene, mostly serving to keep the action going and to perhaps induce a few laughs rather than maintain the movie's believability. Our heroes from the first film, Rick and Evelyn, are now happily married as the O'Connells, and have travelled to an unknown temple with their son Alex to unravel the mystery of a dream Evelyn had. While that mystery has the edge on the film's plot development, the rest can hardly be described as such. Alex unwittingly slips on a cursed bracelet, and meanwhile Imhotep is being revived by a secret faction, whose goal is to defeat the Scorpion King and take control of Anubis' army - and by so doing rule the world. Thus a haphazard chain of reactions is set in motion including dirigibles, pygmy mummies, full-on battles between Medjai and (sigh) Anubis' warriors, and even a double-decker bus! When you've got all that together in a film, it somehow loses its integrity.

The most serious problem is that the plot hardly makes any sense, and contradicts the first film numerous times, e.g. in bringing people back to life being strangely easier than in the first film, and the timeline being off, meaning that Alex should have been born before the first film took place! Oddly, NewLine Cinema decided to mitigate the latter with subsequent DVD releases of the original rather than the sequel, staging it a few years earlier!

The only thing I find worth watching about ""The Mummy Returns"", apart from the mystery of Evelyn's dream and the excellently-crafted Anubis and army (courtesy of IL&M), are the interactions between the spotlight characters. Rick and Evy are endlessly entertaining as a couple (Rachel Weisz having matured a lot in her role since the first film), though not as much as John Hannah as the trouble-inducing Jonathan, almost solely responsible for the film's considerable comic level (apart from Izzy, the entertaining sky pirate). So an action adventure film this is, with all the comedy present just like in the first film. And yet the plot is so nonsensical and its development so haphazard that the film miserably fails at its attempt at being a solid piece of filmmaking - if indeed it was intended as such.

Overall, ""The Mummy Returns"" feels more like an endless explosion of special-effects than much else, once again showcasing the brilliance and professionalism of Industrial Light & Magic (IL&M). Especially (groan) Anubis and his warriors are very aesthetic and well-done. But the haphazard, no-sense majority of this movie is not the deserving place for such talent and creation.",1192924800,2,4151,4.890625
1289818,3,B00003CXT9,"Going in to see this movie, i was not concerned with historical accuracy.  It's a movie about a freaking resurrected mummy, for crying out loud, i think that should be anyone's first hint that viewers are in for a nice little detour from reality, and all tghe better for it.  Picking up several years after the adventures of the first film, we rejoin what is now the O'Connell family as they cross paths with Imhotep once again, this time in an effort to stop him from raising a supernatural army that would allow him to conquer the world.  The Mummy Returns is the sort of movie that makes a fun distraction on a lazy Saturday afternoon, not unlike the hokey, cheesy (but nonetheless entertaining) monster movies i grew up with.  If you can put down your pretensions that every movie should be or should even strive to be the highest form of art, make yourself some popcorn, sit back, put a few parts of your brain in neutral and just enjoy the ride.

Although they can't recreate the magic of the first they give it a really good try.

It was trying to be epic, after more than an hour of silliness (including jet-engined hot air balloons and pigmy living dead).
Still if you can get past all that it does have some of the charm of the first movie and you do find yourself rooting for the heroes to win, and laughing a little along the way (mostly at things that were supposed to be funny).

The corpse of Imhotep is resurrected in the British Museum, and Imhotep returns to the world again determined to gain immortality.

When these two forces clash, the fate of the world will hang in the balance, sending the O'Connells on a desperate race to save the world from an unspeakable evil, and rescue their son before it is too late.  Overall, I thought that the first movie was better how ever the plot was developed nicely in the second and the continuation of the characters is always a good thing.",1177632000,2,935,4.648484848484848
1289892,3,B00003CXT9,"Director Stephen Sommers is responsible for some of the more questionable box-office films I've ever seen. Unlike Uwe Boll who has the box office match his talent (read: none), Sommers' films have actually been successful for the most part but right afterwards, people say how awful they were which is kind of funny. Among them is the sequel to the blockbuster hit the Mummy which had good effects but a super bad story but of course the latter is irrevelant if the film made money, hence we have the Mummy Returns where the keyword is ""more"": more effects, setpieces, characters, and all-around dumbness.

Set 9 years after the last film, Rick and Evelyn have gotten married and have a child named Alex. They get caught up in a rescue mission when Alex is kidnapped since he wears the Bracelet of Anubis, which ties into the Scorpion King, an ancient powerful warrior who's about to be resurrected. Killer of the Scorpion King can command a massive army so people decide to resurrect Ihmotep, our mummy from the first film. And once again, Rick and Evelyn along with Ardeth Bay and Evelyn's brother Jonathan have to once again avert disaster.

It's surprising to see that despite the special effects advancements over the years, the Mummy films have always had way too obvious CG. It has nothing to do with compositing and placing them in the scene that makes them look natural and not just pasted on but there's something off about the effects, like they're too texture-y and light. Nowhere is this more apparent than the Scorpion King himself and I won't spoil it but basically, I've seen Diablo II have better looking characters. However, one advancement that should've got more recognition is the big battle scenes involving thousands of armies. While it's old-hat now thanks to films like Kingdom of Heaven, Troy, Alexander and the Lord of the Rings films, this just looks better to me. The set pieces also don't have the grandiose nature from the first film. A massive tidal wave didn't have the impact of seeing a sandstorm from the last one and it makes this film obviously inferior to the first one.

A film like this doesn't need an in-depth story. It's a summer blockbuster and knows it; you come for the thrills and visuals, not to be riveted by dialogue exchanges and character development. But still, this is kind of a stupid story. A bracelet of something will reveal the location of someone allowing a something to defeat that someone and able to command something is basically the plot and we jump from location to location and have little mini-adventures along the way. There's a sequence involving tiny pygmy mummies (but I call them monkeys) that is not only unintentionally funny but it completely apes off a similar scene in the Lost World: Jurassic Park. Or maybe I'm just complaining too much.

There's not really a lot to recommend here. Most movies have at least something to recommend, whether it's the visuals, the acting, or just the plain strangeness of enjoying something so dumb. I don't completely hate it and why that is is kinda baffling.",1176595200,,3074,4.79433962264151

1290050,5,B00003CXT9,"This movie is a perfect example of how a sequel ought to be done.  We pick up with the same characters--no changes, no retconning, and no disappointing surprises.  Sequels like Men in Black II, Ghostbusters II, or Back to the Future II let us down because the sequels do not follow logically from the first movie.  With MIB II, we expected to see Agents Jay and Elle paired up, with Agent Kay living happily ever after--no such luck.  Then the cameo of Michael Jackson was pure flatulence.  And that is just the casting, not the script.

The Mummy Returns avoids all of this.  In fact, I was impressed to see Patricia Velasquez reprising her short role of Anck Su Namun. Yes!  Same character with the same actress!  This show the care and forethought that went into this film.  And thought Ben Kingsly was a likeable character and a stellar actor, he was not brought back to life just for ratings.  Yum!

I ma impressed how the scriptwriter and the director are able to manage the smaller characters.  We instantly connect with young Alex O'Connell or pirate-pilot Izzy Buttons, who replaces the equally charming Captain Havlock from Mummy I.  BEST SCENE: the two gremlins fighting over the dynamite stick.

I am also impressed how they kept the ""vibe"" of the first film.  There was no attempt to make the film funny, or more serious, or more horrific.  We just see an extrapolation and a continuation of the fun we saw in the first film.

The only flaw is one of the financing.  As with most heavy-CGI films, the closer to the end of the move, the worse the special effects get, because the money runs out. I wished that  had pulled a George Lucas and redone the effects for DVD release.  Since the movie was a hit, the would have recouped their money on the DVD release, TV runs, 10th, 25th, 50th and 75th anniversary re-releases of the movie.

1290051,2,B00003CXT9,"I'm a fan of the 1999 ""The Mummy"" and was understandably looking forward to this sequel. In the summer of 2001 I went to catch it at the theater with two friends and after about ten minutes we were all bored senseless by the incredible bombardment of action and F/X. We just layed back in our seats for the next two hours in utter tedium.

It's a curious thing that too much action (and F/X) in a film can be boring. It may not seem logical but it's true, and ""The Mummy Returns"" is Exibit A. I recently considered the possibility that my first impression may have been in error so I decided to re-watch it after over five years. Yet, after a mere 10-15 minutes I was again completely detached from the picture, even though there were all kinds of exciting things going on, or, at least, things that SHOULD HAVE been exciting.

""The Mummy Returns"" has a lot going for it: A great cast, locations, costumes, cinematography, F/X, etc. In addition it has a great Indiana Jones appeal. Unfortunately it all adds up to a cinematic piece of excrement. What went wrong? Simply put, no substance. ""The Mummy Returns"" abandons the characters, and the plot is utilized simply as a flimsy clothesline for action and F/X sequences.

FINAL ANALYSIS: ""The Mummy Returns"" has so many ingredients right, but it somehow utterly fails. It's unadulterated cinematic JUNK. It should be utilized in filmmaking classes as the quintessential example of style over substance -- having all the right elements, including budget, and stupefyingly fumbling the ball.

Needless to say this could have been a great film franchise, but it was not to be. ""Returns"" put an end to that.",1160784000,,1652,4.705882352941177
1290052,2,B00003CXT9,"The 1999 film ""The Mummy"" (TM) was one of my favorite action adventure movies in recent years.  The characters were interesting, the cast was awesome, and the story was fun.  It turned out to be somewhat of a surprise hit so a sequel was inevitable.

Unfortunately the sequel, ""The Mummy Returns"" (TMR) has almost none of the magic the first film posessed.  In fact it feels like the film makers just exploited the fans of the first by cranking out a sequel before they had a decent script.  There is a fair amount of action and more than enough CGI, but the plot and the script are just not as good as the original. The movie takes several silly flights of fanatasy that include a flying ship and some undead pygmies that live in a forest in the middle of the desert.  TMR takes so many liberties that it actually rewrites some of the storyline from the original.  Without giving any spoilers we now have a unexplainable backstory that links Evie, Rick and the Mummy.  There is also a inexplicably resurrected Anck Su Namun whose existance conflicts with the very premise of the first movie.  The biggest let down to me was the change in Evie's character.  In the first she was a bookish nerd who when asked who she was while drunk, proudly proclaimed ""I, am a Librarian!""  Gone was the feisty little nerd that used her brains not her braun.  Instead she is a female version of her now husband Rick and that completely changes their chemestry.  In the first they rely on each other's strengths, her the brains, him the cunning.  In TMR though they are both the prototypical Indiana Jones characters with no chemestry what so ever.

There are a few bright spots.  John Hannah is back as Evie's bumbling brother Jonathan, although he is a bit underused.  Also back is great Oded Fehr as the mysterious Magi warrior Ardeth Bay.  The opennig sequence with the Rock is interesting but he is barely in the movie.  In my opinion the best scene in the movie had to be the duel between Particia Velasquez and Rachel Weisz.

In the end there are not enough bright spots for me to recommend ""The Mummy Returns.""  If you were a fan of the original you may want to give this a look, but this fan was disappointed.",1158019200,3,2201,4.493702770780857
1290053,4,B00003CXT9,"With the gigantic success of ""The Mummy"", Universal Studios and director Stephen Sommers believed that they had a budding franchise on their hands.  With both the movie studio and the director wishing to see this possible franchise come to fruition, little time was wasted in getting Stephen Sommers busy at work on crafting the sequel.  With a bigger budget, an already established backstory for most of the characters, and the entire cast returning, things were definitely looking good for an even bigger box office return for this sequel.

Set in 1933, ""The Mummy Returns"" takes place approximately 10 years after the events of ""The Mummy"".  Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser) and Evie (Rachel Weisz) are now married and have a young son named Alex.  After a devasting chain of events leads to the resurrection of Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo) in London, before they realize what's going on Rick and Evie find themselves in a fight against an army of mummies, and their son ends up getting kidnapped by Imhotep.  Now that Imhotep once again walks the Earth, determined to fulfill his quest for immortality, another force has been loosed upon the world... one born of the darkest rituals of ancient Egyptian mysticism, and even more powerful than Imhotep.  With the fate of the world in the balance, Rick and Evie must race against time to save not only the world but also rescue their son from Imhotep before it's too late.

As I stated earlier, this film received an even bigger budget, and had the fortune of getting the entire cast back together, ""The Mummy Returns"" succeeds in being even bigger, more extravagant, and better than the original film.  With the backstory for the majority of the characters out of the way in ""The Mummy"", director/writer Stephen Sommers was allowed more freedom in exploring more of the world of this franchise without having to get bogged down on origins.  An interesting segment in the movie happens at the beginning of the film when WWE's Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson makes an appearance as 'The Scorpion King' (the public liked the character so much that Universal spawned him off into his own feature film) in an epic battle that is awesome to watch.  The special effects provided by ILM are once again top-notch, all except for the final sequence with a digital hybrid of 'The Rock' and a CGI scorpion, this scene looked a bit weak on screen.  However, it's forgiveable since this would be an extremely difficult sequence to create, and with that ILM still manages to make the scene appear decent.  The only other complaint I have regarding this movie would have to be that the movie seemed to focus a little too much on the 8-year old son Alex, his character is way too annoying and he's always present since he is partly responsible for the events in this movie.  Aside from those complaints the rest of the movie is really enjoyable, and a very strong sequel to ""The Mummy"".

I strongly recommend seeing this movie, but to fully enjoy the movie make sure you have seen the original film first.

The DVD is definitely your best choice for this flick; the VHS and DVD contain the same movie but the DVD has much better quality visuals and a hell of a lot more special material.

I would NOT say that character developement lacked. On top of the first movie, this film had just what it needed. What would films be like without characters like these?

1290148,3,B00003CXT9,"Brendan Fraser on 'Live With Regis and Kelly': We brought back everyone who survived the first one...

What he failed to tell us that anyone who was killed in the first film, is replaced with exactly the same character and eventually dispatched in exactly the same way.

In the ten years that have passed since their first adventure, Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser) and Evie Carnahan (Rachel Weisz) have married and have a small son, Alex (Freddie Boath). Marriage hasn't stopped their adventures in archaeology. Evie has been having strange dreams, which lead them in search of The Scorpion King's tomb. They uncover the Scorpion King's bracelet and travel back to London. The evil curator of the British Museum (we know he is evil because his name is Lock Nah), finds the mummified remains of Im-Ho-Tep (Arnold Vosloo) and brings them back to London. He resurrects his master and plans to help him defeat the Scorpion King, and rule all of the forces of darkness. One problem. They need that bracelet.

Writer and director Stephen Sommers falls into the same tempting trap that most filmmakers succumb to when creating a sequel to a highly successful film. They are like little kids in a candy shop. The studio has thrown open the flood gates. The director gets to tinker with all sorts of special effects. The director gets to tinker with the special effects he used in the first film, but he gets to use them more often. The studio thinks we want more. The filmmaker thinks we want more. The director gives the audience more. Really, what we want is a little more, but more different.

""The Mummy Returns"" is a loud, bloated mess with some good action scenes. Unfortunately, 'some good action scenes' isn't good enough when the film runs 2 hours and 5 minutes long.

From the very beginning, action happens at a frantic pace. Two archaeological digs are happening near each other, from there, we zoom to London. In London, a huge battle, a mummy is resurrected, an abduction, back to Cairo. The pace is fast, but I still found myself a little bored at times. Why? Because the characters are secondary in this film. Only two characters are allowed to develop. The first is the O'Connel's little boy, Alex, and that seems to be more because he is simply the new character. The second is Anck-Su-Namun (Patricia Velazquez), the reincarnated love of Im-Ho-Tep. Everyone else is so busy screaming for help, yelling at each other over the din of destruction, or running away from collapsing architecture that we never get a chance to know them very well. Rick and Evie are in love? We know that from the first film. Jonathan (John Hannah) is a petty thief? We know that from the first film.

In the first 'Mummy', some great special effects were used which added immeasurably to the story. The plague of beetles was neat, scary and horrifying. In 'Returns', the beetles reappear twice for longer periods of time. Sommers also adds a batch of scorpions. In the first film, a great sand storm threatens O'Connell and his fellow adventurers. The sand storm takes the face of Im-Ho-Tep, the creature who created it. In 'Returns', Im-Ho-Tep creates a giant wave of water with his face in it. Yawn.

Sommers seems to have received a free pass to the candy store for this sequel. In addition to the overuse of special effects, he also uses CGI to recreate huge cities. Unfortunately, many of them have the unmistakable look of computer generation. They look like cartoons. Further complicating this is that one of these city scapes is overrun by a large army of darkness. All of these creatures are computer generated. Basically, everything in this shot is the product of CGI, giving us nothing real to look at. When this happens, we look for the unnatural and the screen is just filled with it.

Publicity for 'Returns' features a lot of pictures of The Rock. The Rock was recruited to play The Scorpion King and Universal Pictures apparently thought this was suck a great idea that next summer we will see ""The Scorpion King"", a prequel, at a multiplex in our neighborhood. Apart from a few minutes at the very beginning of the film, the Rock is not in the film. The big climax featuring the Scorpion King is obviously computer generated, so, in all, The Rock actually appears on screen for about five minutes.

Some of the action scenes are actually fun. My favorite is the fight in the O'Connell's mansion. Each of the O'Connell's is very adept at fighting, but doesn't realize that their loved one is in danger. Many bad guys appear, threatening each of them. Somehow, they make it out of the house. Soon, the chase continues on a double decker bus, also fun.

In no way am I comparing 'The Mummy"" to ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", but ""The Mummy Returns"" is very similar to ""Indiana Jones and The Temple of Doom"". Both filmmakers created a very likable film, that was hugely successful. The result? The sequel features a lot more of the same, little of the charm of the original, and much more action. Thankfully, Spielberg was able to achieve the right balance for ""Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade"". Hopefully, Sommers will spend a little more time on the characters for ""The Mummy Returns Yet Again"".",1113350400,,5198,4.733701657458564

The movie starts with a big ""beng"" and just keeps going in the fun world of the mummy. This one is just as fun as the first mummy movie, and in some aspects even more fun!

The second plus is the action, which is brought to an higher level than the first mummy movie. Very enjoyable to watch!

1290414,4,B00003CXT9,"Mummy Returns takes the characters and story from the first film and develops on them in a big, big way. The situations and set-pieces are wilder, the odds even bigger and character arcs more complex.

Set 10 years after the first movie Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz have made a rich living out of plundering tombs and pyramids. Who could have predicted that their old nemesis Im-Ho-Tep would return faster and stronger than before.

But I'm still having trouble seeing Im-Ho-Tep as a villain. Surely it's the scheming, lying, conspiring supplicants that are the real villains. The look in his eyes at the end, when his lover betrays him, is heartbreaking. I can't root for him as a bad guy when he never really does anything bad. Sure he wants to rule the world and all but who doesn't?

The effects are not the best (Star Wars Episode 2 used up all the space at ILM at the time) but there are loads of them and they're all lavish and imaginative. I HATE movies that are carried by SFX but Mummy Returns incorporates them into the story in a seamless way. How cool is the big balloon? Or the approach of Anubis' army?

Most directors screw-up big budget, big scale movies (AVP, King Arthur, Sky Captain, Exorcist Prequel, Catwoman) but Stephen Sommers knows where the heart of this kind of movie is and delivers, once again, a cheeky adventure with loads and loads of action and enough story and character to back it up.

1290415,4,B00003CXT9,"As the finale of this movie shows. Evie rescues Rick, but Patricia Velasquez's resurrection of Anck Su Namun runs away from her 'true love', Imhotep.

Brendan Fraser & Rachel Weiz are back once more, with their characters bratty little son, Alex (Freddie Boath). Arnold Vosloo is also brought back, with a much bigger role this time, and for the guys, Patricia Velasquez is back as Meela Nais, the reincarnation of Anck Su Namun. The designs on Anuk Su Namun's sleeves on her dress look exactly like her body paint in her previous life. John Hannah & Oded Fehr return as Jonathan & Ardeth Bey respectively.

Who are the cast joined by this time? The one, the only, Dwayne Johnson, otherwise known as The Rock, for all you wrestling fans. He shone so much in the TWO scenes, Stephen Sommers promptly gave him his own movie.

There's a lot of similarities between the first movie and this movie. When Alex is reading from the Book of the Dead, he has trouble translating a hieroglyph of a stork. His Uncle Jonathan  reminds Alex what the symbol means. In the original, Jonathan needed help from Evie translating the same symbol. The dialogue is almost exactly the same as the first film, and in both movies, the person helping the translator with the last word, is fighting with Anck-su-namun while they speak (Evie in the first film, and Jonathan in the second). Also, the title does not appear at the beginning of this film. The title finally is given at the end of the picture, after the headlining credits but before main credits roll. (That's why I love this film: I can't stand fast-forwarding through loads of credits to start watching the movie) Alex knocks over the columns in the same way his mother knocked over the bookcases in the original.

In this, Evie realises she's been reincarnated, and she was around at the same time as Imhotep - what a coincidence! And she & Anck Su Namun also knew each other. Another coincidence. It's actually very good how they managed to work this out, despite my sarcasm. For the guys, you also get to see both girls fighting - woooo. Evie was called Nerfertiri but originally was supposed to be called Nefertiti but the producers felt that people would make (...) jokes about the name so it was changed to that of another Egyptian queen.

There seemed to be a lot of pain in this movie: Brendan gets very much beaten up throughout - he tore a spinal disk, cracked a rib, and injured his knees during production. Dwayne Johnson suffered from food poisoning and sunstroke. (Ha!)

This is a great movie, a fantastic sequel. There are rumours going about there's going to be a Mummy 3, without Imhotep and Anck Su Namun. It could happen, although it could be a little boring to reincarnate Imhotep 3 times, and Anck Su Namun twice. Imhotep could come back to life as king of hell as he fell down to the gate of hell. And Anck Su Namun could come back as Scropion Queen, as she was bitten alive by insects. If you liked both these films, you'll probably enjoy Scorpion King, although it seems pointless to give a guy who was in TWO scenes (hey, and he was CGI in the second scene!) his own movie.",1095811200,3,3136,4.569395017793594

Rachel listens, her eyes fixed on her handsome hubby, she touches his arm and tells him that doesn't matter, she and her son love him.  Then Rachel stands up, goes to the balcony, wine in her hand, and tells Brendan all about her staid upbringing in a stuffy old manor, with her father who was determined that his daughter follow in his historically based footsteps.  Then Brendan gets up and joins Rachel as they look at the simmering sunset.  Then little Alex comes out and tells his parents about his day at school.

Archaeologists Rick (Brendan Fraser) and Evie (Rachel Weisz) have tied the knot since the original movie and have an eight year old son, Alex, adorably played by Freddie Boath. While on an archaeological dig in Egypt, they recover a special, golden bracelet which conveys special powers to the person who wears it. Alex, not knowing this, puts on the bracelet which had, at one time, belonged to the Scorpio King, played by wrestler, The Rock.

Evie's brother (John Hannah deliciously reprises his original role) is mistaken for Rick, as mysterious emissaries try to kill him in an attempt to recover the bracelet on behalf of the evil Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo reprising his original role). As Evie and Rick continue to do battle against these evil, murderous emissaries, the mysterious and devastatingly attractive, Medjai warrior, Ardeth Bay (Oded Fehr also reprising his original role), joins them in their battle against evil.

In this sequel, past and present collide, and reincarnation adds its own interesting, little twist to the plot. For my money, Oded Fehr walks away with the movie, as Ardeth Bay is such a compelling character: sexy, swashbuckling, and mystical, all rolled into one. He is definitely my favorite character. I hope that we will see even more of him in the next sequel. (Who are we kidding? Of course, there will be another sequel!)

The only negative thing that I have to say about the movie has to do with the animation of the Scorpion King at the end. It is too cartoonish. I found it jarring and distracting, as it did not seem to fit with the other graphics used throughout the movie which were great. It made me give the movie four stars, rather than the five I would probably have given, had this concept not been so annoying. It was unnecessary to have this cheesy looking animation, as it detracted from the movie and downgraded its overall quality.

Still, see this movie. It is escapism at its best, as well as pure entertainment.",1092441600,18,2259,4.857142857142857
1290419,3,B00003CXT9,"""The Mummy Returns"" has a lot of things in common with the first one: fast pace, a lot of incredible special effects, beautiful women, humor, a hero that is a combination of Indiana Jones and George of the Jungle, lots of sand, and that results in another amusing movie.

""The Mummy Returns"" presents some new tricks: for example, Stephen Sommers the director / screenwriter of the movie expanded the roles of Meela (Patricia Velazquez) and Evelyn (Rachel Weisz), they added a new character, Alex who is the son of the heroes of ""The Mummy Returns"". By the way, usually a child actor is annoying and his acting skills are poor at best, but Freddie Both (Alex) does a good job in ""The Mummy Returns"".

But I got to say it, I hate that Scorpion King character, not only The Rock has the same acting level of a real rock, but his CGI alter ego is one of the worst CGI special effects in recent years, I hate when a movie turns into a videogame clip, and the Scorpion King ""creature"" has the same texture of a videogame character, I mean they should give a control pad with this DVD to control the Scorpion King.

Now, that's the only detail that I didn't like in ""The Mummy Returns"", because it's a worthy sequel, it has good special effects (with the exception of you-know-who), it has beautiful gals, the hero is charismatic, the pace is fast, the movie has humor, and it's more creative than most of the summer season sequels. So if you liked ""The Mummy"", ""The Mummy Returns"" is a good choice.",1092009600,,1493,4.481617647058823
1290420,1,B00003CXT9,"Writer-director Stephen Sommers succeeds in creating a sequel that is even worse than its predecessor. Another example of how outdated Hollywood cliches such as mummy stories should be left in their tomb undisturbed. With even less character development and plot than the original, this movie puts all its stakes on the dazzling special effects that are too absurd if not comically bizarre to be credible.

 The story now focuses on the Scorpion King (The Rock) who, after being dead for 5,000 years, comes to life again in the '30s to defend his newly discovered oasis from evildoers. Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz are back but married with a young son named Alex (Freddie Boath) to find the oasis before the antagonists.

 Bad acting and shallow characters are as numerous as grains of sand in a desert storm; suffocating the audience with forced expressions and contrived dialogue. The Rock seems more interested in embellishing himself in his first feeble attempts at acting outside of a WWF match than actually playing the role of his character. The movie reaches the absurd in how the characters go off on their ""epic"" adventure. A flying carpet discovered in a tomb or souk by accident would have been more credible than the ridiculous flying contraption used by the characters to reach their destination.

 If you want to laugh at how bad a movie can be, by all means, rent this movie. Again, a perfect demonstration on how long-dead story concepts should be kept in their Hollywood sarcophagi never to rise again. To bring them back to life and torment an audience ad nauseam is a curse indeed.",1091404800,2,1605,4.882352941176471
1290421,3,B00003CXT9,"...this could have been much better. Three years after the fact, I know many of us are in agreement that this sequel did not live up to the original, so instead of just bashing it, I thought I'd do a take on what NOT to do with a sequel:

1.) Do not sacrifice plot for action. After so many sequels that bombed because of this, the producers still fell for it anyway. Do you know what made ""The Mummy"" so awesome? The lure of all the ancient Egyptian lore and myth, which, when interspersed with action, brought the entire movie alive. We don't need more brawls and swordfights and self-consuming cities--we need more of the MAGIC.

2.) Don't reference the original more than twice. It's not as if we don't remember the books and the plagues and the happy romance. If anything, constant reflections insult us as an audience. It's another bad trap that sequel-makers fall into, and again, it happened here too.

3.) Don't wreck the memory of a beloved setting. Hamunaptra was chock-full of all that we as Americans want from ancient Egypt: vast treasures, sarcophogi, curses, booby traps, juicy mummies. And what did we see of it in the second film? Sand, teeming with people who couldn't even find it eight years before. Huge electric lights illuminating what once could only be seen by torchlight. Trucks, instead of camels! And some really strangely reincarnated Anck-su-namun. The moviemakers effectively ruined the magic of Hamunaptra, and they didn't have to. Shame!

4.) Never, ever, ever pull a stunt like a CGI Rock again. Could they not afford to pay him for the final scenes? Just imagine the heroic fight between Rick, Imhotep, and the Scorpion King--only all three are in the flesh! People would have been cheering in the theatre watching the Rock fight with Brendan Fraser and Arnold Vosloo. But noooo...let's pull CGI out of our butts for the eighty millionth time. Shame shame!

5.) Don't ruin the best moments of the film by shortening them. Were we too busy playing around with CGI Rock to choreograph a great fight scene between Anck and Evie? I think we might have been. I understand that having Anck shy away from fighting helped set up her not being brave enough in the end for other things, but even just extending the fight a little longer would have helped. Anck could have given her best in an extended fight but still lost, and then we could have watched her bravado melt away and become her undoing.

All that being said, there are some bright spots. The mummy himself, for one. And the character of Jonathan was as lively and funny as ever, thank goodness; Ardeth Bay (Oded Fehr) was even more campily serious and apocolyptic, and that was fun, too. Enough can't be said for Brendan Frasier, who IS the action hero of the the new millenium--handsome, funny, totally self-aware, and he puts his heart into everything completely.

I hope they make a third ""Mummy."" There's a lot left of ancient Egypt to explore, especially since in the time period of the movies not everything had been discovered yet. I think all the main characters would have to return, and that the plot with the most potential still remains that between Imhotep and Anck-su-namun. With all the money they have in Hollywood, the producers should be able to hire a team talented enough to write a movie as magical as the first.",1085356800,,3323,4.709122203098107

Well, it turns out that this movie is AWFUL. The special effects are plentiful but aren't cool. I constantly felt as if I was watching an animated film (cartoon). The ambitions of creating big action sequences are met with neither precise (and sensible) direction nor special effects that are sophisticated enough. What's the point of trying to create the big scenes then? If the results are not real enough, please just try something simpler.
It has all the features of a made-for-TV movie: Weak plot, cliched dialogues, under-developed characters and unconvincing special effects (and lots of them). If measuring against the benchmark for made-for-TV movies, I would have given it 4 stars. But it's definitely not worth the hype and big budget.",1082160000,,910,4.802547770700637

Rick and Evie have married and have somehow become nauseating.  I found myself actually cheering for the bad guys when they were trying to kill Evie.  The shy librarian yearning for adventure was completely gone--perhaps he actually married her twin sister.
The plot had numerous flaws, which only a serious action-flick lover could overlook.  First, if the mummy was defeated in the first movie by being made into a mortal, how was he able to be brought back as the same creature?  How was Rick raised in an orphanage in Egypt but is an American complete with accent?  If Evie was the reincarnation of an Egyptian princess, why didn't she have the same visions in the first movie?
If you can suspend belief & watch for special effects, you will probably enjoy this movie.  If you are like me and cannot overlook plot gaps & impossibilities, you will probably be disappointed.",1077062400,3,1121,4.654822335025381

1290540,3,B00003CXT9,"The Amazon.com Editorial is correct.  The special effects and grandeur of the film leave little time for character development.  While the film is visually amazing to watch, I felt betrayed that the beloved characters of the first film where given so little time to show us even more about them and their personalities.  Its fast-paced, but when you think it should slow down and show us a little more about the characters and their interactions, we are off again to the next segment.
The fight scene between Nefertieri and Anuck-su-namem as seen in a flashback by their modern day selves is awesome.  That whole scene helps bring the plot line together, but it comes too late and is too short.  We are still left with questions.
All in all, the performances are fair when compared to the previous film.  Rachel Weisz is amazing, but doesnt deliver the same energetic performance as in the original, save for a few scenes.  Brendan Fraser is also toned down a bit too much in this follow up.  Maybe it was on purpose to show the passage of time and age, but I think the spark of the original dimmed a bit.",1076284800,,1105,4.573604060913706
1290541,3,B00003CXT9,"I took my wifey to see THE MUMMY RETURNS when it premiered in theaters (at her request), and the movie was actually better than I expected.  Don't get me wrong -- it's eye candy, and there's really nothing there for the folks in the audience other than to be dazzled by the wall-to-wall special effects.  The movie charges along at a nonstop pace from the first second to the last, with barely a breather throughout the entire show. And the plot?  Well, it's more of a coherent plot (to comic book and pulp fans like us) than most other movies of this ilk, fortunately, and there's nothing that makes us wince and say to ourselves, ""Oh, COME ON!  Gimme a frackin' break!""  Hell, this is the story of a 4,000 year old sorceror resurrected from the dead (for the SECOND time, no less) to do battle with a 4,000 year old army general who sold his soul for power, and who leads an army of 500,000 anthropomorphic dog creatures, *and* fight the good guys at the same time.  (Yes, I know those beasties are supposed to be images of Anubis.)  We're not talking SCHINDLER'S LIST or even LAWRENCE OF ARABIA here.  We're just watching this movie for the special effects and cliffhangers, and while the cliffhangers are predictable, the special effects are good.
Sometimes I wonder about how people today are so accustomed to eye-popping special effects that we've become blase to them.  The effects in THE MUMMY RETURNS are remarkable, yet there's nothing we haven't seen before.  (The movie even uses the bit about a ""wall of energy and death rushing towards you with an image of a howling face in it"" twice!)  And yet, back in the heyday of the cheap 1950s and 1960s sci-fi movies, directors and producers would have sold their souls to Anubis many times over for ""everyday"" multi-million dollar special effects of this sort!  Lots of people are blase to special effects extravaganzas like this, so that even folks our age can just shrug and go ""Eh, special effects are so-so.""  But there are kids who are raised on this stuff, who are so used to stunningly lifelike special effects that they sneer at the great classics of old like THE WAR OF THE WORLDS or THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL or even the original MUMMY starring Boris Karloff.  Sigh...
(And by the way, the original MUMMY is good, but it suffers from the same problem of many Hollywood movies of the early 1930s -- it can get stiff and wooden (like Imhotep himself) because Hollywood was still learning the tricks of filming with sound in those days.)",1061596800,2,2505,4.6

1290543,5,B00003CXT9,"Where ""The Mummy"" was impressive ""The Mummy Returns"" is a highly impressive movie that is stunning and extraordinarily breathtaking in its non stop action, superb plot and innate comedy!  When director Stephen Sommers put ""The Mummy"" on the silver screen he set a very high standard for himself and those involved.  In ""The Mummy Returns,"" he not only exceeds that standard, he raised the bar to an entirely new level that a third film will have a hard time measuring up to.  Given how magnificent the first two films are though, I'm sure that all involved will certainly raise the standards even higher should they decide to make a third movie.
Where ""The Mummy"" had ""some"" amazing CGI provided by ILM, ""The Mummy Returns"" is stuffed to the gills with their fine work!  To say that the CGI in this film was amazing is simply an understatement.  Adding to the allure of this movie is the fact that all of the actors from the first movie returned to reprise their respective rolls.  The ever beautiful Rachel Weisz and the adventurer Brendan Fraser are nothing less than spectacular in their roles.  Oded Fehr, having had a much smaller part in the first movie, easily steps up to the much larger role in this movie.
Of the many movies over the years that have attempted to portray ancient Egypt, this and the first movie are tops as far as their realism and overall feel of the movie, bringing the viewer ""into"" ancient Egypt through such highly detailed realism.
The premise:
We flashback five thousand years and see ""The Rock"" as The Scorpion King leading his armies across Egypt only to run into resounding defeat and the humiliation of being sent into the sacred desert of Ahm Shere to die along with what was left of his Army.  Seeking revenge upon those who defeated him, The Scorpion King offers Anubis, God of the underworld, his soul.  Anubis accepted the offer and gave The Scorpion King his Army...
It is now nine years after the events depicted in ""The Mummy"" and the Mummy, played perfectly by Arnold Vosloo is about to be resurrected by none other than a woman who appears to be Anck Su Namun, but without her spirit resurrected from the dead.  She plans to resurrect Imhotep and then he can bring back Anck Su Namun's spirit into her vassal.  They then plan to find The Scorpion King's resting place, defeat him and take control of the Army of Anubis and take over the world!  This is all a great plan of course, except for one small problem; the Bracelet of Anubis, which can lead them to The Scorpion King, has recently come into the possession of the O'Connell's.
What follows is as stated above, one of the best films to come out this millennium that combines intriguing Egyptology, non stop action, superb humor and a well matched cast to make it one of the most enjoyable and fun movies to watch.
I highly recommend this film and its predecessor as they're both extremely entertaining!  {ssintrepid}

1290720,4,B00003CXT9,"The original ""The Mummy"" had scary moments, a great story line, enough humor to keep the tension level manageable, and plenty of action.  All combined to make ""The Mummy"" thoroughly enjoyable.  Of course, one incredibly successful movie begets a sequel; thus we have ""The Mummy Returns"".
This time we figure out how to tie together Evelyn Carnahan O'Connell (Rachel Weisz) and Anck Su Namun (Patricia Velazquez).  They knew each other!  Of course!  How could we have not known?  This relationship is used to tie together the parts of the story to the end, though it felt a touch contrived in places.
The beginning of the movie starts off with some of the best action in the movie, as the Scorpion King's amulet is found, Imhotep is brought back to life and there is a goodly amount of chasing around and fighting as various characters are introduced.  However, from this point forward the movie seems to lose its way.  While the general concept of needing to be at the Scorpion King's oasis to gain his power is pretty straight forward, some of the journey to get there is a bit of a stretch, falling almost into comedy rather than a serious movie.  The best example is the balloon used to travel to Africa.  I admit I liked the balloon.  However, this balloon just didn't seem to fit with the tenor and quality of the original, and I was a bit disappointed.
There were other places where I was a bit disappointed with the movie as well, but my biggest disappointment was that there was so much potential from the original that was left unexploited, and the ultimate effect was that the movie seemed more of way to make some quick money versus trying to create a worthy successor to ""The Mummy"".
Though I felt the movie could have been better, there were parts that shine through as successes.  The train was excellent.  I am a fan of trains, and the train used in this movie was perfect, with superior detail.  The Scorpion King digital effects were very good.  Most of the portion of the movie inside the pyramid at the end was well done.  There are other places that were also well done mixed in with an occasionally slow story that doesn't hold a candle to the original.
Had this movie not had such a good predecessor, I suspect that I would have enjoyed it more.  However, the comparison is automatic.  In spite of my complaints and the down sides of this movie, it's still a decent movie.  Not great, but okay.  While I may be in danger of wearing out ""The Mummy"" DVD, it's unlikely that ""The Mummy Returns"" will get much more than an occasional playing.  This could have been a 5 star movie, but the occasionally cheesy story and the lack of a serious scare factor for most of the movie pushes this movie back into the realm of a very low 4 stars.",1044489600,3,2754,4.512096774193548

Then when he threatens Imhotep to 'get lost' on his way back to the desert oasis. Imhotep's response made me quiver! What made it more scary was that he got down at eye level with Alex and kept his voice even when he spoke.

Evy's visions were a great tie-in overlapping the first and this movie. At first, I thought these were a little long, but as the move progressed, they got more detailed, which helped me understand Evy's connection to her fascination with 'all things Egyptian'. In the first movie, she does say that her mother was Egyptian. I do like when she tells the person who is about to spear her brother to pick on someone their own size.  I love the cat fight between Evy and Anuck-Su-Na-Mun. The new move she used was a classic!  And it certainly was a surprise.

The special effects made some of the scenes at the oasis work. The pygmy scene in the jungle had me laughing so hard I hurt. The water scene was over the top. As for the two guards, well, they deserved Imhotep's wrath!  Incidentily Imhotep was no fool, except when it came to underestimating Alex's intelligence.  He knew what he was doing when he got to the temple.

Anuck-Su-Na-Mun knew what she was doing too.  What she did actually hurt Imhotep. I mean, you can see the pain in his face when she says no and turns away from him.

  Brendan Fraser gives a rock-solid performance and Freddie Boath does a fine job as a child actor.
  The action is more intense than the first with mummies crawling up the sides of buildings and legions of jackel-headed men charging into battle. One of the best scenes has little pygmy men slowly killing people off one-by-one in a jungle. The humor remains funny throughout the movie. I laughed plenty of times.

The Mummy Returns gets credit for having some fantastic special effects, and lots of action.  However, the storyline was rather simple.  It went from one action scene right to another.  There were still some attempts at comedy and romance, but it just wasn't pulled off as well as it was in the original.  One great thing about this movie, was that it had pretty much all the same actors from part 1.  That is something that is rare in sequels, so it was nice to see that happen.

1290818,3,B00003CXT9,"When making a sequel, one should concentrate on new plot twists, yet stay true to the original story. This movie, though not bad, is a little too repetitive and lacks a real interesting plot. Brendan Fraser, as usual, has an overall decent performance, but his character, like before, is a little too heroic and it is too hard to enjoy his performance in this type of role. The introduction of the Scorpion King is almost a complete waste of film. His debut is not much of anything. He plays a total of about 5 collective live action minutes, proving that this movie is too concerned with impressing its viewers with computer graphics and not with acting.
Overall this is a good movie. It is action packed and full of eye popping special effects. It really doesn't touch on the original movie's ideas, but tries to add something new. Its direction is kind of confusing, and the viewer will notice many likenesses to other movie ideas. The DVD has a few special features that, like all movies with animation, are filled with the how-they-done-its of computer animation.
If you already own ""The Mummy,"" this movie is a nice addition, but it is not really worth owning by itself. Hopefully the creators know when to quit and will not ""curse"" us with another Mummy film after this.

Don't get me wrong - I loved The Mummy.  It's one of my favorites, and that is simply why I rented The Mummy Returns.  The first movie was somewhat believable, as it contained history, humor, and realism.  The sequel was so far-fetched, I was tempted to shut it off halfway through.  Evie's character was demolished in the sequel - in the Mummy, she is a somewhat clumsy, bright, pleasant person.  She would rather find ways around fighting than fight.  In the sequel, they have changed her into some kind of wannabe black belt that no more needs her handsome husband to protect her.  The explanation of Rick's mysterious tattoo is meaningless, and I was especially bored with the whole Evie-is-actually-the-pharoah's-daughter-in-another-life thing.
In a brief summary, the movie is far-fetched, and you wouldn't know it was on a  big budget as every special effect appears to be so fake.",1024790400,2,1062,4.791208791208791

As the Scorpion King, The Rock is a leader of the people turned bad. Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser) and his wife (Rachel Weisz) are back for a new adventure along with their nine-year-old son Alex (an annoying little rascal). Why spend your money to watch them though? It's all about the WWE star. The plot is thin reviving Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo), the mummy from the first film, to capture the Scorpion King's bracelet which will control mysterious Egyptian soldiers who merely look like dogs with staffs and hoods. Oh yes, if it wasn't for The Rock, none of this would have ever happened. The Rock's face is funny and he yells in a strange language. It was far out! Talk about the birth of a new genius. He was the lone survivor after a huge battle (characteristic of a genius) and he destroyed many people. It was an honor to watch ""The People's Champion"" kick some bootay outside of the ring. Please! Hollywood Hulk Hogan and Triple H are nothing compared to The Rock. The ""People's Eyebrow"" was missing in action, but thank you to the wizards who made ""The Scorpion King"". The three minutes of The Rock is the whole movie and he made it worthwhile. Oh yes. Good job Stephen Sommers and cast, but I praise The Rock for being a new deity.",1024185600,,1355,4.512195121951219
1290933,3,B00003CXT9,"There are a few cases in film history where a sequel is actually better than the original. ""The Mummy Returns"" is not one of those cases. But it's not completely bad either. Its basic problem is a question of balance. The original was famous because of its clever mix of action and comedy. In this case, whether you believe it or not, there's just too much action and too much comedy. As for the plot, with its tale of ancient reincarnations, duels of fate, supernatural armies, lost cities and even more magical artifacts than the first movie, it's just too ambitious to be taken seriously. The biggest flaw of the movie is, therefore, its excess.
But in spite of this problem, some characters take an interesting twist. The leader of the Magi (Odeh Fer) turns out to be an even more amazing hero than he was in the first movie, and the character of Evi (Rachel Weisz) is no longer the naive, bookish girl that she was before. Now she evens wields swords, daggers and guns just like his husband Rick. Some new characters, like Ank-Suna-Mun (Patricia Velsquez) and the Scorpion King (The Rock) are also welcomed. This time, however, Imhotep is not as cool as he was before. You can even say he's kind of weak. I think that losing your immortality forces you to play it safe for a while.
The producers also put a lot of special features on this edition, even more than they did in the first movie, but even they get old, because the first movie already covered the special effects aspect too well. In conclusion, you should watch it if you liked the first one, but you should know that, this time, they just pushed things to far.",1023926400,3,1628,4.522033898305085

And the whole promotion of the Rock as the Scorpion King was another waste of time. His part lasts a whole 2 minutes. But thats good because he can't act .... at all. The only reason the Scorpion King was even made into a movie was because Vince McMahon headed up the project.

And in many ways it is not, the quiet character development that so was so charming in the first one is rather pushed aside in this head long rush into a pace that never stops for breath.  You are nearly exhausted by the end!!
However, after the initial grump about it not being as good, I have since viewed it several times.  And the more I view it the more I like it.  The humour is there, brilliantly delivered by Brandon Fraser, like after rescuing his wife from being killed by the resurrected mummy, they are escaping and she pauses to pull a bench to block a door, and he gently said in his typically comic Brandon voice, ""Honey, what are you doing? Those guys don't use doors.""  The kid is precious without being TOO CUTE.  Especially fun is his interplay with his kidnappers - ala Ransom of Red Chief, bugging them with ""are we there yet?"" so typically bored kid!!  Also, with the female captor when she tells him to behave and he replies, ""I don't behave for my parents, so what make you think I will for you?""
You get eye candy in the female fight scenes, wonderfully staged. A whole returning crew, the the minor leads in the first one playing much more prominent roles, and with reason!!

1291037,5,B00003CXT9,"I absolutely loved the first movie ""The Mummy"". The storyline was different than the old black and white film adaptation. I thought the writing was a lot better than the original black and white movie. Anyways, after loving the first movie, I knew I had to see the sequal ""The Mummy Returns"". I loved the sequal even moreso and had to own a copy of the movie on tape. Most movies, the sequals [stinks] unless it is Star Wars or Jaws. I must say that I found myself enjoying ""The Mummy Returns"" even more. Arnold Vosloo as Imhotep was made for that role. I was extremely excited to see Oded Fehr return for the sequel as the dashingly handsome warrior Ardeth Bay. Oded and Arnold are two of the handsomest acts I have ever laid eyes upon. There is an unspoken intensity in their abilities that made their characters more believable. Although his role was relatively short in the film, I thought The Rock did a believable job as The Scorpion King which laid the foundation for the prequel ""The Scorpion King"" out now in theatres. The computer graphics of The Scorpion King was cheesy as velveeta but I can't really complain. I absolutely loved Patricia Velaquez as Imhotep's love interest the deliciously wicked Anck Su Namuth. I think my favorite scene with Patricia and Arnold was when Imhotep was bringing his long lost love's soul. Without giving too much information away, it broke my heart to see Anck's true colors revealed, that she was more concerned about herself than Imhotep himself. Frankly I thought Rick's and Evie's song Alex was a bit on the annoying side as was Evie's brother. I also thought it was very corny tto see that Evie was the reincarnated soul of Anck Su Namuth's stepdaughter Nefertitti. Cheesy but it was entertaining to watch Evie's visions of her as Nefertitti. Purely fictional, I thought both ""The Mummy"" and ""The Mummy Returns"" did a superb job at not patronizing or disrespecting Egyptian culture with stupid stereotypes which often happens in a lot of movies. Yeah there were a lot of velveeta moments in ""The Mummy Returns"" but overall I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It is a good popcorn movie. Pure bliss in terms of escapism and fantasy. Excellent special effects and graphics and of course the presence of Arnold Vosloo, Patricia Velasquez, and Oded Fehr really made this movie for me.",1020902400,,2327,4.7481481481481485

1291041,4,B00003CXT9,"""The Mummy Returns"" (2001)
Lets get one thing straight, I did not like the original Mummy film that much. I thought it lacked plot and was kind of boring. I didn't hate it, but I did expect more. I was not really looking forward to The Mummy Returns because I didn't like the original enough to take the second one seriously, but surprises come along occasionally. Im very happy to say The Mummy Returns is definitely a good sequel that impressed me much more than the original film.
The story, amazingly, was one of the strong points of this movie. There is a whole bunch of plots going on, while include the kidnapping, the parents going cross-country, the resurrecting of that darned mummy, the deal with the ancient warrior, The Scorpion King, and heck, the parents even get enough time to discover about their past lives! Excellent!
Most of the original cast returns to play their characters. Freddie Boath and Patricia Velasquez are new instalments, Boath playing the never-annoying and potentially hilarious child of Rick and Evelyn (Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz from the first movie), and Velasquez playing Imhoteps (Arnold Vosloo) lover before he died. Fraser and Weisz head the screen again, and return with their excellent chemistry and acting skills. Unfortunately Fraser isn't given quite enough witty lines and funny scenes as in the first movie, but Weiszs character has a big improvement. Shes no longer a geeky bookworm, but a make-up wearing, [guy]. Weisz looks beautiful and is clearly enjoying herself. John Hannah also returns, but unfortunately he just annoyed me in this movie. Arnold Vosloo is very good in this movie, he barely has any lines, but he connects with the audience excellently with his awesome facial expressions. Oded Fehr is back again to talk about destinies and fate, and kick some booty. He does exactly what the director instructs him and comes off as a fun actor but unfortunately he didn't have a very believable character.
The length and pace of the film was nice and I liked the way it started because it really got you into the mood for the Indiana-Jones way of things. The movie rolls along nicely and is able to fit many funny one-liners, neat and clever story twists and awesome fight sequences. I particularly enjoyed seeing the range of new beasts and sets in the movie. Its good to see the mummy is out of Egypt and the atmospheric but boring temples and hes come to London. Some very cool set pieces and chases revolve around the setting of the movie, which I really enjoyed.
Unfortunately the movie is weighted down a little by a couple of flaws. The special effects at the end are absolutely terrible! Things were going well until we saw The Rocks version of a beastly Scorpion King! The Scorpion King at the end looks like hes crawled out of an unpopular, unwanted video game and inhabited himself somewhere through this movie. The Mummy Returns also doesnt have as much charm about it as The Mummy did.
Overall, I did enjoy this movie. It was an incredibly entertaining feast of fun, a really neatly made and intriguing popcorn sequel that mixes itself into every genre and does it well. Plus, theres Rachel Weisz and Patricia Velasquez sword-fighting in only bikinis and gold body spray. Now, how can you possibly refuse?

1291043,1,B00003CXT9,"This movie bothered me. And the fact that it bothered me bothers me even more! I absolutely LOVED the first one...I mean, I saw ""The Mummy"" in theaters more times than any other movie, and I watch it often still on DVD. It had such a good combination of characters, story-line, special effects, and so on.
So, naturally, I believed the second one would be good. I was wrong!! Oh Lord, was I wrong...I almost cried, watching it, for what was done to the movie.
Here are only a few things wrong with it:
1) Evey: All right, in the first movie, this character was great.  She was a ditzy, naive librarian with just enough charm to stop her from being irritating. But in the sequel...well, first off, unless I'm mistaken, the time-setting was 1933. Women did not wear those form-fitting bodysuit things in 1933. At least in the first movie, she wore correct clothing for the time. And also, she became this weird, ""wannabe-superwoman"" type of character that was simply ANNOYING. I could go on...but I believe you get the idea
2) Rick: What happened to Rick? Where's the brave, adventurous, wise-cracking hero we all know and love? In this movie...God, I don't even know how to describe him other than ""whipped"". He's almost regulated to the background except when he suddenly developes a tattoo (that he lacked in the first movie!) and Ardeth is telling him ""you're the one."" The one what? Poor Rick...I miss him :(
3) The Kid: kids are always bad. The kid who played Anakin Skywalker in SW-Ep1 totally ruined THAT movie. This kid ruins this movie. And he's 8...ok, I don't care HOW smart you are, no 8-year-old is going to act as cool and collected as that kid did. And he was simply ANNOYING...just irritating as all heck
4)Jonathan: ACK!! I almost cried when I saw the representation of my favorite character in this debacle. In the first movie, Jonathan was such a great character...funny, brave, a bit of a ne'er-do-well, but loveable. And he was smart...he was a developed character. But in this movie, he's almost a sidekick to the kid! He has no originality, none of the charisma that made him an endearing personality in the first movie
and...
5)THE PLOT!!! Oh...wait, nevermind, there was none!! There were too many subplots, and the subplots themselves were simply stupid. Though I could bring up many strange innaccuracies...wouldn't Imhotep have noticed that Evey was the reincarnation of Nefertiti in the first movie? Wouldn't he have done something then? The first movie was almost intelligent in its scope, in its subtle parody, in its attempt...this movie is anything but subtle and intelligent. It is a waste of time, and a shame to the first movie, which was so wonderful.
In conclusion...pass this one up, just watch the firsy (and best!) Mummy!",1018828800,11,2761,4.7761506276150625
1291044,3,B00003CXT9,"After The Mummy's huge commercial success, a sequel was inevitable, and this is one of the better sequels of late, yet still succumbs to the old ""bigger is better"" rule, and hey, in the original we had an all-powerful villain, let's have two!
The main star of part 2 is not Arnold Vosloo, as he was in the first instalment, but Dwayne John-oh sorry, ""The Rock"" as the scorpion king, a mighty warrior who turns up in the film as a shoddy CGI creation that smacks of ""could've been better"".
But Arnold Vosloo, with more story to chew on this time around is great. Oded Fehr as Ardith Bay and Brendan Fraser manage not to get lost amidst the barrage of CGI and Rachel Weiz provides the eye candy but this time gets to kick some serious butt.
The visuals and action (very loud) make up for the limp dialogue and overly complicated plot. The ending threatens to sink the whole film, with so much CGI it's easy to see it's fake, and the story starts to get very predictable and hokey. Regardless, it's good fun in a non-challenging way.",1018656000,,1030,4.426315789473684
1291045,4,B00003CXT9,"I have to wonder what was going through Stephen Sommers' mind when he started writing this movie.  Certainly it must have been something perverse, because Sommers pulled an amazing fast one; he got Universal to lay out a fortune to make a spoof of big-budget, effects-laden action flicks.
Of course, Sommers does deliver the thrills.  If you want to see this as a straight action movie, go right ahead, it's certainly quite enjoyable that way.  One of the things I like about Sommers' satire is that you can take it or leave it, a very generous thing for a director to do.  But the cinemaphile in me gets a charge over the fact that Sommers is mocking every convention in the blockbuster with this flick.
It's pretty hard to miss.  Sommers visually refers to just about every major epic/blockbuster, especially if they had to do with deserts.  There's the obvious ""Indiana Jones"" jokes, but there's also ""Lawrence of Arabia"", ""Star Wars"", ""Titanic"", ""E.T."", ""The Seven Samurai"", and a whole bunch more.  About the only one he missed was ""Cleopatra"" and I suspect I'll catch that one when I see it again.  He also drops in other pop culture touchstones; that blimp looks suspiciously like a certain dirigible from MAD Magazine, for example.
Then there's Sommers' take on the formula.  He blows absolutely everything up to ridiculous size.  I don't want to blow any plot points, so I won't offer any examples, but one viewing should make it obvious.
And then there's that wonderfully godawful big special effect at the end.  I imagine the only reason Sommers didn't take out every third frame to make the motion jerky was because he didn't have the time; otherwise, it's a hilarious nod to Ray Harryhausen (only, of course, not as realistic.)

1291127,4,B00003CXT9,"THE MUMMY RETURNS is a sequel to 1999's THE MUMMY. It is an Indiana Jones wannabe crossed with a classic horror flick and flavored with a dash of cutting edge special effects. The combination works brilliantly, bringing forth a modern action-adventure franchise full of Abbot and Costello self-parody.
THE MUMMY RETURNS takes place 8 years after THE MUMMY ended. Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraiser) has married Evelyn (Rachel Weisz) and they have produced an extremely resourceful and witty son named Alex (Freddie Boath). Most of THE MUMMY's original cast is back including my favorite character, Evelyn's hokey brother Jonathan (John Hannah). Anyway, in this movie some really evil guys have dug up and resurrected mighty mummy Imhotep (Arnold Voslor). The whole world is in danger because not only can Imhotep spew plagues from his mouth but if he gets his hands on a pretty bracelet he can control the dog-headed demon army of his former arch nemesis, The Scorpion King (The Rock). Then he will be invincible and can conquer the world. Since O'Connell has defeated Imhotep before he's the only one who can stop him this time around.
This is a mind candy movie equivalant to a week-long sugar high. Therefore, most of the acting is cheesy. However, Fraiser pulls off a remarkable performance considering he's second billing to the real star of the movie. That star belongs to the special effects. There is something to amaze you every five minutes: from mummies to flesh-eating pygmies to dog-headed demons to a giant flood.

The much awaited sequel-some of the fan sites were abuzz from the moment the decision to make it was even rumored-attempted to cater to the interests of almost everyone, dissolving into a bland tale whose only claim on the viewer's attention was its complexity.  The film was overly serious and melodramatic.  The theme of reincarnation seemed to have been introduced to salvage an otherwise rather banal plot.  It also allowed for the introduction of some wonderful period scenes with colorful costumes and the only interesting  martial arts activity in the film (though not necessarily good-those in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon are infinitely better).  The film relies heavily on CGI, but other than the splendid recreations of Ancient Egypt most of the computer work is trite, consisting of little toothy monsters and the return of the skeleton army.
Again the history is atrocious.  Seti I was not stabbed to death.  The Egyptian museum possesses his mummy among the collection of its royal mummies, so that's definite.  Nefertiri was the  first and favorite of his Queens (her tomb is among the most beautiful and elaborate in the Valley of the Queens near Luxor) and not his daughter.  Imhotep is an Old Kingdom architect, and the Scorpion King is an early pre-dynastic king.  Ahkhsunamon was the heiress to the Thutmosid dynasty (the XVIIIth not the XIXth) one of the six daughters of Akhenaton and Nefertiti, and the wife of Tutankhamon (remember him?).  Etc, etc, etc.  It's unfortunate, since the errors in the first film could have provided the plot to the second; all Summers had to do was figure out plausible explanations for some of them-the movement of the pyramids from Cairo to Luxor being one of the few that would be difficult to explain away short of extraterrestrials.  I did it in my spare moments at work-few enough in ICU-and came up with a wonderful,  historic, internally consistent plot.  Certainly Summers has more imagination than I do!
Although most of the central characters reappeared and were played by the same actors, they had been transmogrified to such an extent that only their names and faces remained the same!  With the single exception of Oded Fehr as Ardeth Bay, most of the characters did more morphing than the mummy himself.  O'Connell, for instance, has become a mere shadow of himself.  Marriage seems to have robbed him of the last shreds of his sense of the absurd, and even when he is at his best, when dealing with his erstwhile buddy Izzy Buttons (Shaun Parkes), the latter steals every scene they're in together.  Rick's almost frenetic activity in the first film and his sharp as tacks wit are missing and missed in the second.  Maybe it's an advertisement against the unhealthiness of matrimony for males!
The individuals who were most disappointingly out of character were the two central women, Evie and Ankhsunamun.  The former has lost the ditzy, accident prone intellectual aura that lent her such charm in the first movie.  The Evie of the first film was a woman one might well see someone like O'Connell taking risks to rescue, a bright person whose brash naivete might both exasperate and attract.  The Evie of the Mummy Returns has an edge.  She's sexual rather than sexy, and she's definitely not funny.  Where is the wonderful woman who proudly, if drunkenly, states ""I am a librarian!"" and passes out mid-kiss, collapsing face first into the sand.
Of all the characters, Ankhsunamon's change is the most disappointing.  Here is a woman who sacrifices her very life for her lover in the first film, certain that his own love and devotion will do whatever it takes to resurrect her if he can.  In the first movie he nearly succeeds.  In the second, she has somehow managed to be reincarnated and attempts to bring him back from the dead for little other reason than to achieve power.  She is no longer the almost feline creature who exudes strong sexual allure that she was in the first film.  Instead of a seductress, she's now a, harsh looking Vogue model type, like a harden femme fatal out of a Dashiell Hammett murder mystery.  Her motives seem less certain, her devotion to her lover less apparent, and her courage more in doubt.  Her recoil in the face of danger seems merely a literary  contrivance, a foil to Evie's unfailing allegiance to Rick.
Subverting his part as title character in order to bring in fans of the professional wrestling stars, Imhotep goes from a man with a mission to a man with feet of clay by the end of the story.  He becomes a foil for the new focus of the film, The Rock.  This is a great disappointment, since his character's problems are central to the movement of the whole story, even the whole series.  When both Rick and Imhotep were confronted with the evil of the Scorpion King, one almost expected them to work together to defeat him, perhaps deferring their own conflict to a latter episode.  Instead Summers merely chooses to make the issue a contrast between a couple devoted to one another by virtue of love and one devoted to power alone.
Oded Fehr, whose character Ardeth Bay delighted the audience of the first movie, embellishes the film more often, but his appearances seem more ornamental than purposeful, a sop to the millions of fans who enjoyed him in the first film.  Surely more could have been done with his character.
Probably the most delightful pair of characters were Rick and Evie's son, Alex, and his arch enemy the towering black henchman assigned as his jailer.  The two were perfect foils for one another, and by the end one almost hoped that the latter would change teams, for whatever self-seeking purposes, and save the boy.",1016150400,,5836,4.836858006042296

1291134,1,B00003CXT9,"I was really suprised at the sheer entertainment value of the first Mummy to the extent that I bought the DVD. When the sequel arrived I went to see it too - but I was to be dissapointed.
Brendan Fraser is not known for his elegant roles, and the first Mummy was probably the only decent role he has ever played. In The Mummy Returns he is back in familiar territory (George of the Jungle type junk). I suppose you can't blame the actors for chasing a paycheck but this movie does little to endear them to one. John Hanna is pure slapstick, and the introduction of the kid completes the nauseating circus. All thats missing is the cliched dog! You don't expect too much historically correct information in a movie like this but that said it is a good opportunity to familiarize people with ancient Egypt - instead all the gods and places are mixed up - pronounced incorrectly  and adapted to suit the moment. Basically, as with most sequels,  this movie should never have been made - and it seems that it was done 'on the fly'. There is no real story and therefore no real ending.

1291266,4,B00003CXT9,"I greatly enjoyed  ""The Mummy"" when it was resurrected several few years ago.  I can recall many late hours spent watching Zacherlee and Shock Theater, entranced by the antics of a whole slew of monsters, with The Mummy being one of the most memorable.  In those days movies still had to have plots and spooky atmospherics to do what we do with special effects and a truckload of gore today.
What made the new ""Mummy"" fun was not just the updated effects.  It also had just the right tongue-in-cheek attitude.  Let's face it, mummy movies are high camp.  Abbott and Costello figured it out first, but it took decades before Universal Pictures discovered the same secret.  Now, as in the original film series, we are offered a sequel, once again called ""The Mummy Returns.""
Set 10 years later than the time of the first movie, Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser) and Evelyn Carnahan (Rachel Weisz) have married and have an 8-year-old son, Alex (Freddy Boath).  They have returned to Egypt seeking the Bracelet of Anubis, an ancient artifact associated with the legendary Scorpion King of Egypt's fabled past.  In doing so they trigger an adventure that will have them chasing all over the Egyptian map.  For, not far from the O'Connell dig, a group of nefarious cultists are once again resurrecting the mummy of the evil Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo), the real star of the first movie.
Imhotep's has plans for the Scorpion King (The Rock) and his minions which require the bracelet.  He would also like to even the score with the O'Connells, who foiled his first return.  When Alex inadvertently puts on the Bracelet of Anubis, and is kidnapped, he triggers a chase scene that stretches from England to Abyssinia.  Imhotep and his beloved Ankh-so-namun (Patricia Velasquez) use every dirty trick in the book in their plan to conquer the world.  Before Alex (and life as we know it) is rescued, our doughty heroes will be treated to every kind of adventure and mishap, including  reincarnation, dirigible rides, pigmy zombies, and the Scorpion King himself.
The actors are perfectly in character, capturing the thrill and fun without any sense of overacting.  The effects are gorgeous.  The DVD does a wonderful job of capturing the film, modifying it to fit the television screen without excess or glaring distortion.  As on would expect, there is a host of bonus features, including interviews, outtakes and countless explanations of the effects.

They should stick to what they're good at and avoid hitting the movies.""(~I feel the same way about these pop singers) I also thought that the guy who replaced Benny (I forget his name) wasn't nearly as good.

One more thing, in the first movie I admired the historical accuracy but the second definetly seemed to lose it.

These movies are nothing but prime examples of directors poking fun at the entire action movie industry.  From the moment Brendan Fraser's character's family returns home to England, it is immediately evident that the writers were cracking up as they cooked up more and more cliched and contrived scenes.  The best example of this is (spoiler ahead), when Fraser and the Rock are locked in combat, the action freezes the Amenhotep, the Mummy, rushes onto the screen to strike a dramatic pose and scream ""NOOOO!""

1291360,4,B00003CXT9,"Now THIS is a great popcorn film!! After seeing the trailer on the Ultimate Edition of the original 'Mummy' DVD, I knew this was one summer movie I couldn't pass up. And you know what? I was right. Even detractors of 'The Mummy Returns' will agree: This film packs in more than your money's worth of action, adventure, and special effects. In fact, the film feels very similiar in pacing to 'Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom'. In my opinion, these two rank among the best rollercoaster movies of all time.
It's unfair to say that 'The Mummy Returns' has no plot, when really, it has a very interesting, even epic plot. The beginning of the film details the fall of a great warrior called The Scorpion King, and how his resting grounds could unlock an ancient evil that could end the world. Whether or not the mythology is accurate is irrelevant; it's close enough to our romantic images of ancient Egypt, so it'll suffice. Unfortunately, Sommers did very little to explain this complex plot. While the action scenes in the movie are fantastic (I'll praise them later), they force the exposition to be hastily crammed, and mostly given as dialogue by Ardeth Bey. Hey there's so much action that the movie even forgets to show us its title (which we obviously know, but it's a formality that I like). Also, the return of The Mummy and his mistress were unnecessary. While I like Arnold Vosloo and Patricia Velasquez, the story could have been fine without them. Their inclusion adds in another bit of continuity, but with two major villains, both get short-changed on character development.
But of course the real meat of the movie is action and special effects, which are here in spades. The movie starts out in a booby-trapped temple, where the O'Connells find a rare artifact. The villains then strike at Connell Manor, where a big fight scene insues. Evie is kidnapped, so the heros storm a local museum to save her, then escape via a double-decker bus while being chased by mummies. And this is only the first hour of the movie!! The sequences are fast, energetic, and backed by an Indidana Jones-worthy score. The huge amounts of CGI work is also worth mentioning. It's not as realistic as ILM's past projects, but I think they weren't trying to go for realism. Plus, George Lucas soaked up the best talent for his Star Wars movies. The only truly bad CGI sequences are the wall of water and the Scorpion King at the end. Everything else looks great.
Special mention must be made of Rachel Weisz. If nothing else, buy this film to see her in action!! While she was already a talented actress in the original 'Mummy', nothing in the world prepared me for just how stunningly gorgeous she looks in this one. Her fight scenes are amazingly done, and she'll keep your eyes glued to the screen when the action and effects don't.
Universal has done a great job with presenting the movie. The picture quality looks great, and the audio track makes full use of surrounds. Unfortunately the extras are a disappointment. There are a few gems - the commentary track is great, as it re-teams Sommers and Duscay, and their witty, informative, banter. There is a fluffy making of documentary and some good outtakes presented like a music video. There is a section that shows how various CG sequences were created, but they require too much clicking (a common trait of Universal DVD's). All of the rest are advertisments, including tons of preview footage of the new Scorpion King movie, and a worthless tour inside the new Mummy attraction at Universal theme parks (hope they won't really have actors running around inside like they have here)
This is a great movie. It has it's flaws, but the action and adventure more than make up for it. And if those don't get you interested, then Rache Weisz's beauty and strong performance are worth the admission price alone. Check this film out!",1011312000,,3880,4.715758468335788

The skeletons chasing the double-decker bus were excellent, as were the dog-warriors, and although I thought they were quite silly as a plot device, the pygmies were nicely done. My gripes: the storyline was weak (I'm still trying to remember the point, but this gripe is well covered in other reviews), the kid was a typical precocious movie brat, the entire air balloon segment was wholly unnecessary, and the Scorpion King effect at the end was just awful (what, did they run out of special effects money by the time they got to the end?). I did like the past-life-visiting-the-present-life aspect of the story, though, as well as the perfectly nasty villainess.

If, by now, those people don't understand a fun 'popcorn' movie like this, they never will. However, I'm not praising The Mummy Returns. Not by a long shot. First of all, let's get into the story. Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz are now husband and wife with an 8 year old son. They are sort of a Mommy-Daddy Indiana Jones like adventurers. They find a magical bracelet once owned by The Scorpion King(played by The Rock, who shows the most charisma in a very brief role). He died 5,000 years ago, and is waiting to be brought back. The mummy Imhotep(Arnold Vosloo)is resurrected again(yes! again!), and kidnaps our heroes son who put the bracelet on. The bracelet shows where to go to find The Scorpion King, and then it goes into the usual mumbo jumbo about the end of the world!. Bet you didn't expect that. Okay, so maybe you did. There's so much going on in this film that the plot doesn't really matter. The action scenes are, of course, a lot of fun. The effects are good as always and, in some cases, better than in the original. Brendan Fraser is actually believeable in his role. Watch him in anything else and you would think differently. Rachel Weisz is a gorgeous beauty. I hope to see her and her loveliness in far better material in the future. John Hannah is also back as her annoying brother. This is pure cotton candy folks, and it isn't meant to be taken any other way. It's Indiana Jones light. These movies are pretty fun and harmless. There's nothing wrong with that.

The ""plot"" is so bizarre it would be laughed at in a comic book. Scorpian King? Give it up. The original Mummy will always be a 5 star genre bender that is rewarding to view over and over again. Why? Because of wonderful characters in a breath taking plot. But this version? I had to watch it 3 times just to figure out what it was about. Still not sure if I really like it.

1291450,2,B00003CXT9,"this is not a very good movie. The action is just boring, and the plot....well, i just couldn't care less about it.
The characters are pretty damn poor, apart from that guy who wears black and has a bird. but his name is so obscure that i couldn't for the life of me tell you what it was.
The thing about the first one was taht it had a nice bit of history mixed in with it. It made the film a lot more interesting. This one, however, lacks any real historical element at all. It is just action, and it's pretty poor action at that.
The fights are just absurd, and what on earth was the thing with those awful little pygmie things about?????? This was just in the realms of fantasy, and completely ignored the fact that this is a film set in egypt, and with it's grounds in Egyptian myth and legend. But they seemed to just  forget that, and throw in any old evil monsters. In the first film, because they stuck plainly to the impossible, yet somehow strangely realistic, it worked, but in this one it just seems to make a mockery of it.
The entire Scorpion King thing just seemed to be thrown in to get another good fight out, and it was just so badly done i couldn't care less. He was so obviously put together by computer. they could at least have made some token effort.
The introduction of Fraser and Weisz's child was a bad move. I just couldn't care about him at all. When he was taken, i couldn't give a damn about whether they rescued him or not. He just kept getting on my nerves.
Possibly the only redeeming festures of this film are Imhotep (who does make the film shimmer with menace, although not so much as in the first) and John Hannah.
He was simply wonderful, and really made the film. his acting was great. Admittedly, it was quite obvious and rather idiotic, but he made me laugh out loud several times.
If they had kept every other character out, and just Hannah in, this film would have been greatly improved.
But, in this instance, they chose to stray from the winning formula they found with the first, and have managed to create an abismal and disappointing film.",1010016000,,2088,4.340153452685422

1291566,3,B00003CXT9,"Clearly a film like this is not going to be an experience which improves ones mind and starts the nation thinking. However within its constraints it is an enjoyable fast moving film of the special effects genre.
I saw the fist film and liked it moderately. It clearly was not a remake of the Boris Karloff film of the same name but got certain plot ideas, which it expanded, into a comedy setting. Its strengths were the principle characters specifically Brendon Fraser and whoever plays the villain.
The sequel has the same cast as the original movie. It rather artificially reincarnates the villain from the first movie and we are of again. Some of the film makes absolutely no logical sense. The main characters fight to gain control of an army of mechanical warriors who fight with battle axes. With the invention of modern weapons the only use of this phantom army would be to run a protection racket in a backward town in the Sudan. One can understand that the villain of the film might see this army as impressive he is a reincarnated Egyptian after all. He has not had much time to adopt to the modern world and to see that the battle axe is a bit passe.
Never the less the film is reasonably well scripted, the actors look good and perform well and the film is fast passed.
The extra bits in the DVD are basically promotional material and explanations about the special effects. One of the weird things about the extra bits is that it shows the actors as actors and one can see how human they are. The character who plays the mummy for instance appears to be rather pudgy and his skin tone is dreadful. The transition to the screen makes a big difference.",1009584000,,1664,4.513245033112582

Boy was I wrong.
The Mummy Returns is one of the most dissapointing, most horribly corny films I've ever had the mis-fortune of seeing.  First of all, there's way to much cheesy CGI and almost no plot or character development at all.  The dog-men warriors were luaghable.  In the last battle, I nearly fell out of my chair.  The puny little men on their horses cut down the dog-warriors three at a time at moments, this being very strange looking at the fact that the dog warriors were nearly three times their size.  Also, at the end, the effects used on the Scorpion King looked like something that belonged in a Saturday Morning Cartoon.  On the subject of the Scorpion King....
STICK TO WRESTLING ROCK!  That guy cannot act his was out of a cloud.  The Rock goes on to grunt, huff, puff, and blow all the little warriors down like a miniature Godzilla.  It's really hilarious to see a man with the brain capacity of a guinea pig trying to act like some lethal warlord.
Also, adding a kid was a very bad idea.  This was the first ingrediant into reducing The Mummy Returns into a action driven piece of garbage that will only appeal to little eleven year old boys and, sadly, cheerleaders.  Don't touch this movie with a ten foot pole.",1009497600,,1468,4.494339622641509

1291571,3,B00003CXT9,"The Mummy has returned, but it never made such an impact on me as it did in the first movie. I wished I could have given the movie, ""The Mummy Returns"", more than 3 stars but to do that it would have to have been a better movie.
Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz are back as the two adventurers/archaeologists Rick and Evie O'Connell, now married. Now with their son, Alex (Freddie Boath), they discover the bracelet of the 'The Scorpion King' (Dwayne Johsnon, 'the Rock'). But someone else is looking for the bracelet, Baltus Hafez the British Museum Curator (Alun Armstrong) who has awakened again the mummy of Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo). The reason, to take possession of the Scorpion King's vast army given to him by the god Anubis. And so when Alex puts the bracelet on himself, he is kidnapped to be made to lead Imhotep to the lair of the Scorpion King. It's up to the O'Connells, along with Evie's brother Jonathan (John Hannah) and Ardeth Bay (Oded Fehr), to stop Imhotep before he can use Anubis' army for his own.
Ok, let's start with the bad points of the movie when comparing the two Mummy movies. 1) While ""The Mummy"" WAS corny, it was not as corny as this movie. And for those who though that ""The Mummy"" was pretty stupid and the plot thin, don't watch this movie. 2) The F/X were pretty good in the first movie, all the action and special effects flowed smoothly. And this movie had plenty of fight scenes which could have been GREAT, but they looked pretty choppy and you could tell that they were making the action look faster than the actual speed. 3) And finally, ""The Mummy Returns"" just didn't have the suspense or excitement it had it the movie before.
And if you're not comparing this movie to the first movie, here are the few reasons which were a bit disappointing. 1) While ""The Mummy"" was definitely not a children's movie, they tried to make it like it was for kids in ""The Return"" by putting in the annoying Alex. And some parts he was funny and I admit I was laughing at the part in the train where he argues with Lock-Nah (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje). But what was disappointing was that there were a few bad words in the movie and most ALL of them came out of the mouth of Alex! I didn't think that was a good idea. So a warning here, parents should watch this movie before younger kids watch this movie. 2) In the movie, Evie and Meela Nais (Patricia Velzquez) fight together with the fork like weapons (I forgot its name). Well, those weapons aren't Egyptian, they're Chinese weapons!!
All right, enough about the bad parts, now for the good points. I thought it was just funny!! There were a few moments where you could actually laugh and think it very witty. The acting was so-so but not that disappointing. Probably my most favorite character would have to be Ardeth Bay (Oded Fehr). The action scenes were choppy but entertaining.
And that's what the whole movie of ""The Mummy Returns"" was, entertainment. So if you would like to try the movie out, do watch it once. But still in my opinion, I think I like ""The Mummy"" more, for the suspense and the thrills. And if they do make a Mummy III, they'd better make it more like the first movie.",1009324800,,3173,4.481865284974093
1291572,1,B00003CXT9,"The Mummy Returns is about 40 times worse than The 1999 film, The Mummy, which was also horrible. Why movies like this make so much money I don't think I will ever understand. Not only is it bad but it looks like they didn't even try to make it good, the specisl effects are worse than that of Air Force One or The Langoliers.

There was no plot, no good acting skills (with the exception of Jonathan's being very very upset when he thought Evie would die), and no good effects. The animated scorpion king at the end would have been animated better in the 80's then it was in the film, it was very fake looking. The movie twists and turns and makes no sense and leaves you with a bunch of over done and crazy, superfluous, non-sensical effects. I guess they figure, hey the movie has NOTHING going for it, why not just fill it with a huge stunt every other minute so that no one will notice what the film is lacking.

So, the cast, this is Brendan Fraser at his best, funny, not dumb like in the bomb George of the Jungle, plus a good action hero, he kind of reminds me of Harrison Ford in Indiana Jones sometimes, as the whole movie does. Rachel Weisz is both beautiful and a great actress, plus a very enjoyable character, an in this Mummy she had her kicks, plus looked more beautiful. Arnold Vooslo is a great bad guy, because he is a bad guy in love, a thing that had not been done for a long time. John Hannah is very funny, although he is a very stereotypic character, he is still fun to watch, is not his fault that the character has been played so many times, he tries to keep it fresh. Oded Fehr is good, not a sidekick, another important character played nicely. Freddie Boath was a surprise, at the beginning he gives the impression of a truly lame character and performance, but the movie continues and he evolves into a very funny and not lame and corky like most child characters are always, here is something George Lucas should learn when putting a kid in his movies, specially if that kid will be Darth Vader, Freddie would have done a much better job in playing Anakin. Patricia Velasquez is not as great as the other, but still, she is a newcomer and she is going on the right track. And the Rock, well, he looks like he is the master of the ring, but not the master in front of the camera, thank God he has a very, very, very short part, he only appears in the beginning, at the end his face appears, but as an animatronic, not his real face. Let's hope he took acting lessons before doing The Scorpion King, the upcoming prequel to The Mummy, which trailer is included in the DVD, which is very good, the menu has a very smart animation, plus the special features are nice as well, with good sound and picture, The Mummy Returns DVD is a very complete edition, and is not even a special edition, here is for Paramount to learn how to make a DVD, kudos Universal for bringing out a good edition for this movie, although, I did not like that you have to watch both the trailer for The Scorpion King and the Universal movies in DVD trailer when you want to se the movie, same thing for The Mummy Ultimate Edition, they should make in the future a trailer for the special features and leave the movie alone. But still, that is not a huge problem, the movie is very good, very fun to watch, not a movie for people who like to think too much, no, a movie for normal people who sometimes just want a good old adventure film like Indiana Jones, Stephen Sommers is a good director, because although this might not be the smartest movie, it sore was something connecting the two Mummies like he did in this one.

My only problem with the film was it kind of ripped off other films. The pygmie scene was a direct rip of ""Jurassic Park"" minus the Velociraptors.

It wasn't very intellectual or original, but it was pretty funny, pretty good in different ways. It had good Indiana Jones-like action. But second part was really bad.
I have to say, that during first, somethin' about, 30 minutes I even liked it in some way. Visual effects were so extremely great! But then... It's too hard to count all bad sides of this film. Some of them are: bad performances by main actors, dull and boring screenplay, unfunny jokes, a lot of actual mistakes, for example we don't know phonetics of the Ancient Egyptian's language, we can read their books, but we can't pronounce their words etc. etc. etc.

Alex for some reason decides to put on a bracelet that is essential to finding this lost city, and thus find himself abducted by cultists. Our heroes along with Weisz brother(John Hannah) follow the cultists in close pursuit, but it is all very confused. At one time they also encounter mummy-pygmies...I will let that speak for itself.
The Return of the Mummy try to outdo the original in regard to special effects, but they seem very uneven, and not always very impressive, but they do take your concentration of the (nonexistant) plot.

1291745,5,B00003CXT9,"(...) In one sentence - ""The Mummy Returns"" is even better than the 1999 version of ""The Mummy"" - MUCH better.

In my opinion, in the first film of the series Sommers (the writer/director) was still exploring his subject.  The result was good, but sometimes it seemed a little unsure of whether it was set in the 1930s or the 1990s (in 1930s clothes).

The new film has no such ambiguities.  It's as true to its period as any of the Indiana Jones films, for example.  Also the brief flashbacks to ancient Egypt are kept short, simple and believable.

One of the main reasons why the film works so well is the quality of the acting.  By this I mean that the director and cast have avoided all temptation to play the story with tongue in cheek, and thereby help to make what are, objectively speaking, a totally OTT set of events, seem entirely credible.

Having said that, the plot itself is well-developed and cracks on at a rate of knots.  As to being ""too"" fast or ""too"" action packed, what on earth was the reviewer expecting to see?  ""Driving with Miss Daisy""?

Of course it was fast and furious, but I found that it was ALWAYS coherent and rational within its own little fantasy world.
And ""too many"" special effects?  I can only say that it occurred to me, at the time, that the special effects, though they are a major feature of the film, had been used with great restraint.
But then, I grew with films like ""The Ten Commandments"", ""Spartacus"", etc. so a screen-full of extras pretending to beat seven bells out of each other seems perfectly reasonable to me, even when 90 per cent or more of those extras are computer generated.

If there were any shortcomings in this department, I guess we might wish for a more convincing ""creature"" in the battle inside the pyramid, which I personally found was too obviously virtual reality.
But that's a minor consideration.

So, if you really can't handle anything more exciting than watching paint dry, then by all means avoid this film.
If, on the other hand, you enjoy a bit of well-crafted escapism, all-round good acting and a story line that is thrilling, sensational and gripping then get out and buy this video.  You won't regret it!",1007337600,2,2190,4.579487179487179
1291746,1,B00003CXT9,"The Mummy Returns--your classic sequel.  Put everything, and I mean everything, that worked in the first movie into the second.  But, to make it interesting, you need to add lots and lots of special effects.
*YAWN*.  If I hadn't known any better, I would have thought I was watching the first movie.  The Mummy Returns was plain and simply a bomb.  It shouldn't even be associated with the original, because at least the original came up with it's own ideas and had some character development.  In The Mummy Returns, it was all special effects.  Nothing more than that.  Sure, they were great, but it got real old halfway through this stale and utterly disappointing film.
It seemed Stephen Sommers only focus was on the special effects and nothing else.
The Mummy Returns was a pitiful attempt at a sequel, and hopefully, but not likely, this will be the last movie in this series.  2 Stars",1007251200,4,891,4.696774193548387

He and his his wife pull off a wonderful marital combo. Can't wait to see next flick in series. The young son was interesting. Yet, if there is a third, I hope the movie writers age his son to sixteen or send him off to boarding school. Good movie, great sci-fi effects, true

Some say that these are great special effects. What are great special effects? Star Wars Episode 1 had great special effects where a lot of time was obviously invested in the little details of the CG characters and the action scenes. This movie looks like a video game and there was hardly a moment where I could accept what I was seeing. A problem with this, and also with the first, was that the filmmaker seems to think that if he moves the camera fast while showing a lot of explosions and a large monster chasing down the heros that we're just gonna be on the edge of our seat even though what we are seeing is so unbelievable and so poorly done that it goes beyond being laughable to the point where you are just disgusted with it. I can't say much about the characters accept that...well, i can't say anything.  They speak strongly for themselves.  THey are just really goofy.  The filmmaker seems to lack confidence in being able to entertain the audience by taking the film seriously so what we have is a very uneven movie because he's constantly bombarding us with flashy images to keep our interest.

1291849,3,B00003CXT9,"The Mummy Returns had both its ups and downs.  Unlike many horror sequels that break their own rules, (no the scream 3 commercial is not right).  Imhotep returns from the grave a rotted carcass and has to absorb the organs from a bunch of riffraff thieves.  The CG effects were pretty good, even through the CGI depiction of the Rock (his real name is Dwayne) looked pretty plastic and pitiful as the Scorpion King.  There's plenty of action and the ending of Imhotep and Anuk-su-Namun is bittersweet irony.  (The tears welling up in Imhotep's eyes were a pretty nice touch)
When I said the movie didn't break its own rules, I lied.
Apparently, somewhere between getting stabbed in the belly by Rick and being squashed flat by the entirety of the Hamunaptra complex, Imhotep magically acquires telekinetic abilities.  Instead of adding new powers to his already bloated repertoire of skills, the writers should have stuck to the original 10 plagues.  And when did Rick get this magical new tattoo?  In the first mummy movie there was no talk whatsoever of some mystical &#8220;warrior of light&#8221; fighting a half-man, half-scorpion freak, nor was there any mention of Rick's tattoo.  Instead of creating this artificial background for a character, A new character (possibly Rick and Evelyn's son, whose name I can't think of right now) should have been introduced as the mighty slayer of the Scorpion King.  Yet another problem was the &#8220;matrixization&#8221; of the entire movie.  You know what I'm talking about!  All the fight scenes were in slow motion with lots of debris flying around, and while there was no dodging of bullets, the fight between Rick and Imhotep prior to the grand arrival of The Almighty Stone-Soup Cooking, Scorpion Eating, Eyebrow Cocking, Plastic Looking Scarred-Up Mess We All Know And Love As The scorpion king a.k.a. the rock was just kinda not normal.
It would also help if we were given a little backstory about the weirdo cult in the red robes who are convinced that Imhotep is their savior, and about the relationship between Ardeth Bay and the black guy with the really cool sword.  I mean, the only thing that you see between them is the exchange of a few words that show them to be ancient mortal enemies, but nothing more is said. (...)
All in all, the movie was jammed full of actions and special effects, which kinda compensated for all its plot holes.

1291850,4,B00003CXT9,"If were to write a dictionary, I would have written the following on ""film sequel"": ""Poor attempt of copying a movie that scored high on box-offices."" Sequels are for the most part bound to stink, but it doesn't always have to be like that!
Stephen Summers wrote the script for The Mummy Returns not long after the release of the first mummy movie, The Mummy. He got all of his original crew and cast back, including a few new ones. They all make wonderful performances in this film! The acting is top notch! However, when it comes to the story, there's a few holes. The story isn't nearly as good as the first mummy movie, which was a huge hit at the box-office. But come on! Who can blame Summers? Writing sequels is not easy. You put your soul, heart and all your ideas into the first one, and when it's time to make a sequel- you've ran out of ideas. Well, not exacly run completely out of ideas, but I'm sure you know what I mean. The script does have a few holes, and some of the jokes and dialogues are very cheesy, but it's nothing that really confuses the viewer when he's watching it.
Now, let's talk special effects! The main man of ILM, John Berton, was the the man leading the special effects team on this movie. I've been a fan of ILM for many years, and John Berton has always been my favorite. He really knows what he's doing! He puts his soul and heart into making the special effects. You can see that he's eager to please the director, who in this case, is Summers. They wanted a kind of Harry Hauser feel to the special effects, and that's the way they made them. Some of the special effects, I admit, could have been done better, but hey- nobodys perfect! Regarding the scorpian king at the end of the movie. Many people say that it stunk and looked awful. The people saying that clearly have no clue when it comes to special effects. The best ILM artists worked on it, and it turned out great! Just to let you all know; ILM hasen't come as far as to making CGI look just like humans and animals. And to quote John Berton: ""Computer technolegy will never replace real actors!"" The scorpian king was superbly made and it turned out fantastic, PERIOD!
Anyway, this movie is really worth having, even if you're not a mummmy fan, it's still a ride! Despite some plot holes, Im sure you're gonna love this movie!",1007078400,,2328,4.3663594470046085

1291852,1,B00003CXT9,"This movie could have been tremendous. Notice I said, ""could have?"" I really thought it was a pathetic attempt. Despite a surprisingly decent acting performance from The Rock, this movie failed to live up to my expectations.
When ranting on this movie, the first thing I look at is the graphics. In parts of the movie, it is phenominal (ex: the armies of Anubias), other parts left much to be desired. The end scene with the Scorpian King was a disgrace, if that is the best that can be done, then it simply shouldn't be done.
I also have problems with the plotline of the movie and logic. Where did this warrior of the light or whatever come from? You cannot throw things like this in and expect people to get into it. If it had been done right, then it would have been hinted at in the first movie. Foreshadowing is everything when you are writing, whether it is a movie or a book.
The good points of the movie are as follows: The storyline (that could have been better, but its still not bad), the actors did a pretty decent job (once you forget the standard movie cliches where every kid has been trained under the Home Alone Movie Franchise).
I wasn't impressed too much with the first movie, but I thought it was well done, if a bit silly. This one is just all silly, and I would definitely rent it before spending your money to buy it. (...)",1006819200,6,1348,4.353174603174603

In Egypt, a band of ""bad-guys"" search for Imotep once more, the leader, the reencarnated Anuk Sun-a-mun! Bum, bum, bum! :o
Brenden Frasier does an excellent job, still portraying Rick as a heroic quipster. Ready to kick some butt when anything threatens and at the same time provides a very amiable and enjoyable character.
Rachel Weisz is perfect as Evelyn, still extremely adventurous and unintensionally mischievous. Something I found improved her character from the 1st movie was how much stronger she was depicted. She could take care of herself and kick butt too!
Jack Hannah, Jonathon (Evelyn's brother) provides the comedic relief amd does it well. You see the unintensional mischief with him as well, and why shouldn't you, the Jonathon and Evie are siblings. He gives off a sort of cowardish aura, but you see how strong and brave he really is, when needed.
Fredie Boath, Alex, was very enjoyable. In many movies, when I child is introduced, they seem in the way or annoying, but Fredie Boath is cute as Alex and I thoroughly enjoyed his performance.
Oded Fehr, is very believable and gives a wonderful performance as the mystical magi, Ardeth Bay. He is a much more prominent character in the sequel and backs up his larger role with great acting.
Arnold Vosloo, Imotep, is, like before, the best for the mummy. I found him the perfect bad guy. Vosloo's performance is shockingly scary at times, but so good it gives you shivers.
Patricia Velasquez, Anuk Su-na-mun, is focused on 10x more in this movie than her short but very memorable performance in the 1st movie. Velasquez's performance, is excellent. She makes the reencarnated Anuk-Su-Na-Mun, seem more evil and devious than Impotep. She's a wonderful bad-guy and I applaud her performance.
I found that smaller characters in the 1st movie became very important in this movie. I found that very clever and much more interesting. One thing I wish had been focused on MUCH more was the flashbacks with past lives. The best scene, I think, is Evelyn and Anuk Su-Na-Mun's flashback of their pasts and how they had been connected. I thought that was so interesting and should have been focused on much more.
The Rock, of whom I almost left out, gave a wonderful performance as the Scorpion King. I expected a struggled performance but it waqs excellent.
I would love to see a 3rd movie focusing more on Anuk-Su-Na-Mun, Neffirtiri, and Imoptep's connections.

1291939,3,B00003CXT9,"It was appropriate that the two lead characters are married and have an 8 year old son.  Because 8 to 12 years old is just about right for this picture.  I would have loved it at that age (at that age I saw  Ray Harryhausen's Seventh Voyage of Sinbad with my friends and we went nuts over it!).  It seems to be written and pitched to that age group as well, and if you take it with that in mind, it is a lot of fun.
It is CGI gone amok, with tons of stuff and barely enough time in between to catch it's breath.  Crazed mummys, even crazier pygmy mummys, villains, ridiculous airships, improbable escapes, and even a nod to Ray Harryhausen with the Scorpion King at the end.  All at 90 mph.  Ya know, 12 year old stuff.
For adults, probably 2-1/2 stars, being generous, unless you're in a 12-year-old frame of mind (which I find myself in from time to time). But it is too loud, fast & furious to put you to sleep, so in the right mood you might enjoy its silliness done with more care than probably necessary.

1291947,2,B00003CXT9,"Director Stephen Sommers must've known he had a hit, because he didn't bother to introduce logic or sense into the script with this movie. He was probably next door all the time at ILM, playing with the CGI nerds because he obvious left any type of storyline with The Mummy Returns.
To quickly go through the plot (what there is of one). Rick and Evelyn are now an architectural duo, finding old egyptian artifacts. They come upon a bracelet that is said to have belonged to a famous warrior called the Scorpion King. Through several events, they activate the bracelet and have 7 days to find the Scorpion King and stop him to rising from the dead.
At the same time, another party finds and resurrects the evil Priest Imhotep (the original mummy) who is also looking to find the Scorpion King, kill him and take over his army of the dead. Meanwhile, Evelyn is having flashback dreams that is leading her to something she is not aware of and Rick has a symbol on his arm that Magi warrior Ardeth Bay realizes means that Rick is also a Magi (personal quests).
There are some good things about this movie. Rick and Evelyn still have some good chemistry with each other, even though at times it feels forced. The sexual tension is no longer there, since they already have a son and have been married for nearly 10 years. However, they still work together well as a duo (even though they bicker all the time). John Hannah, who plays Evelyn's bumbling brother Jonathan also comes back and maintains his role as the comic relief, joined this time by Freddie Boath as the protagonist's son. Boath does a good job (meaning natural) being a kid, without going overboard on the annoying factor.
But the cons far outweigh the pros. I gave this movie a break because it was a summer flick, but it still flunked as a movie. This is because....
1. The director takes no time explaining things. He throws ideas into the air and expects us just to swallow things. Why does Evelyn suddenly have these visions? Why does Meela know all these things about Imhotep? How does Izzy fix the airship with no tools, helium or hot air? A person cannot just present these thoughts without any back drop or explanation. I was shaking my head repeatedly througout the movie.
2. The Airship: I'm glad that the rocket booster was created years ahead of the German V1 rockets. Did you see the handling on that balloon? Wow! Just plain stupid.
3. The duals: I like catfights, but they have to have some sort of purpose. Firstly, a Pharoah would never let his daughter dual another, even if it is step-mom to be. Secondly, what was the purpose of this fight? Oh yeah, to channel some mysterious Bruce Lee energy into Evelyn. How about she took some lessons? That would make more sense.
4. Outrunning the sun. I didn't know Rick O'Connell was part Roadrunner. He would have had to break the sound barrier to run faster than the approaching sunrise.
5. The kids intelligence. I can buy him reading the Book of the Dead, but I can't buy those clues. I wish I could make as professional a sandcastle as that kid could.
6. Bad CGI: Talk about a poor Scorpion King rendition. After seeing the preview for the movie Final Fantasy, I laughed outloud when I saw the Computer Graphic for the Scorpion King. He looks more like a water drawing than a person. And why did they have to make him half scorpion? That was lame and I would have preferred a fight between men, not men and pixels.
Also, those doglings of Annubis must have been real pathetic, since not one of the 12 tribes of the magi appeared dead. Maybe those undead weapons were made of dry sand as well.
7. Opportunity Lost: What would have been cool was for Imhotep and Rick to team up against their nemesis, an uneasy alliance. Just when I thought it was going to happen, Sommers goes all conventional with the bad guy chickening out.
There were many more things that I found annoying missing or added (without explanation) but I think you get my drift.
I like mindless movies, but all the action has to serve the story that the director is telling. In the Mummy Returns, the bad effects and actions was left holding the bag while the story slipped out the back and disappeared into the Nile....Rating: C-",1005696000,2,4223,4.536041939711665

In Love, get the hell outta here, I wanted to see him lay a little smack on the Rock but that never happened, they made the Mummy in the Wussy, but the movie still rocked.

1292018,2,B00003CXT9,"I'm sure there are enough reviews already that discuss the variably awesome to pathetic special effects, and the seriously lacking story and characters, so I'll go right to my few points:
1.  As a sequal, this makes no sense, there is no coherence or consistency between this movie and the first.  Even the basic character types and motivations for the same characters changed drastically between the two films.  For example:  In the first movie, Imhotep is a super powerful destructive force of nature who causes various plagues, and has a pretty simple goal to destroy the world.  In this movie, he is a thoughful, intelligent being with very few powers (and by the way, he has power over the DESERT SANDS, NOT WATER), who wants to steal the power of yet another supernatural being, or something like that, theplot really stinks as I mentioned above.
2.  I really hate it when something is hard for one character, but easy for another, if done only for the convenience of the plot.  For example:  In the first movie Imhotep, who is a priest, has great difficulty in bringing his lost love back to life, and in the end fails.  It takes a large number of people performing a complex ritual to bring Imhotep back in this movie.  And yet, Alex, who is about 10 years old, is able to bring his mother back to life with a single book in the space of about five minutes.  Yeah, right.
3.  And most importantly, when is holywood going to learn that not every action movie has to have a huge special effects finale?  Case in point:  The Scorpion King is set up as a major player, a brutal warrior from the past who fights with cunning and strength.  Imhotep is a powerful undead being, and Brendan Fraser is an experienced adventurer.  It appears that they are all going to meet in the end and do battle for the ultimate prize.  Had this happened, I might have ended up liking the movie.  Instead, Imhotep loses his powers for no apparent reason, and ends up trying to win by feigning weakness.  And, worst of all, the scorpion king has somehow become this stupid looking, poorly animatedm half-man half-scorpion thing.  Not a real blow lands, nothing of interest happens within the scene.  This isn't the titanic battle we were promised in the beginning, this is a cheap trick, and I for one felt sorely cheated.
Well, I've said my piece.  Feel free to disagree, apparently there are a lot of people out there who liked the movie, though I'd imagine they were primarily entertained by the bright colors and loud noises.  It's people like you who cause Hollywood to churn out stinkers like this.

After working a high-stress filled day at the office, plop down on the couch and slide this into the VCR and enjoy!  Some of the other reviewers state that not much character development exists from the first movie to this one, but I disagree.  There is a tatoo that is significant (watch the movie to find out why), as well as some past life regressions that further expand on one character.  The recreation of the Scorpion Kings realm was absolutely awesome!.

For the Mummy Returns the people bring back the entire cast for romance, danger, suspense, death, reincarnation, and discovery of past lives. We also get to see more of the mummy's girlfriend, and the Rock as the Scorpion King. (Who gives us just another reminder that you should never bargain your sole to gods) The charisma and humor of the first movie also has not left, and like the first one Mummy Returns offer another mind twisting plot.

The quality of the DVD both video and the soundtrack are of course extraordinary and the disc contains outtakes, commentary, game previews and even screen savers .......
Wrestling fans are going to love The Rock playing the Scorpion King ...... The Rock Rules ....
Considering that the theme of the movie is the opposite of Miss Universe beauty pageants in that an 'evil force' is released and nothing less than the 'fate of all mankind' now hangs in the balance, minute by minute, of course, you will not have to concentrate that much to follow the plot but rather enjoy the slam bam, back to back, eye candy action thriller .....",1004745600,,958,4.74251497005988

This is a pathetic sequel to the first film, The Mummy (which was much more fun). It is also a film which make several references to older films in some scenes oh! so clich (the jet airship?!?). The scriptwriters obviously did not care about making any sense when writing this junk. Alex's mother would worry but not the father?!?!?! Oh pleeease. The kid seems to have been, at first, a copy of Ramses Peabody (see the Amelia Peabody series written by Elizabeth Peters); however this dissolves after his meeting with the mummy.

However, this is a no brain movie with baddddd action. Infact, not enough action. You will note the following:
-For some reason, the ""evil"" Imhotep from the first movie plays a little girl with no good powers.
-The CGI Scorpian King at the end was sad, really sad. I would've prefered the Rock(Scorpion King)in a ""human"" body.

And where was he? 30 freaking seconds worth in the prologue! Those of you who have read my reviews know I am big on cinematography and soundtrack. OK. The filming was very breathtaking. But the soundtrack was SO OFF! It rose where it should have been subtle, and faded when it should have punctuated. And soundtrack makes 50% of the film. Nice try with the surround sound, but a zither and bow saw would have enhanced this movie. Fraser did his beat, but he came out like a real sissy. This movie was more about Evie coming into her own. Long live women's lib. If it wasn't for some cheesy but nice special effects, this would be a chick version of an action film. Now, bear in mind, I watched this DVD THREE times to find something great, and all I found was the 2.5 seconds of Ak-san-amoon in the past, wearing the body paint top. Yes, there are some nice special effects eye candy, but in no way does this film live up to the greatness of the first.  THAT was a truly excellent film, on a par with the Indiana Jones films (okay, not the Temple of Doom) I am so sorry Brendan, but George of The Jungle and Blast From the Past where more fun to watch, and you ARE an actor with talent. You have proved that. Still, I did watch this 3 times. And I give it three stars. Oh my God. I must be getting soft...",1003968000,2,1440,4.217391304347826

The sequel, however takes ""suspension of disbelief"" and throws it off a cliff. I would point out some of the plot holes, but I'm still trying to figure out if there ever really was a plot in the first place. Sure the CGI graphics were interesting, but what's the point?
There were what, a quarter million or so members of the 'Medjai' in that valley scene just waiting to go up against the Scorpion King's unholy army? Just take a few riders on a ridge over looking a valley, and paint in CGI replicas until you run out of room in the frame.
Oh yeah, the DVD is also chock full of self-serving promo junk like stuff for the Scorpion King movie and some hokey-looking Universal Studios attraction. There's a commentary track, but I don't think I could stand to sit through it again.

I don't understand why these film makers take good ideas and turn them into STUPID movies.  They spend a fortune on special effects, actor salaries and marketing, then they get lousy screenwriters.  Why?  This movie was an insult to my intelligence.  They figure if they bombard you enough with effects and action that you will forget that there is no plot or character development.  To add insult to injury they throw in some wise-cracking kid that isn't the least bit funny.  In one scene this kid is face to face with Imhotep.  This guy is menacing, loud and has a decomposing body.  Does the kid act scared?  No, of course not.  He looks at this living corpse and tells him that ""my dad is going to kick your @ss.""  Wow, that was really believable and funny.  Not. Then you have the airship with jets on it.  That was years before they had discovered jet power.  Oh, and I love the scene where Brandon Frasier is out running the rising sun to get his kid into the ancient ruins before sunrise.  He would only have to be running at 186,000 miles per second to do it.  You never once get a sense of danger or that anyone of the inane characters will get even the slightest bit injured.

For me personally, I would rather see an action movie with more depth of emotion, less obvious special effects, and a less predictable plot. Essentially, not a comic book movie. I would count myself in the minority of Americans, however. Movies such as Three Kings, Memento, and Gladiator are more up my alley.

1292274,3,B00003CXT9,"First off, I loved the first movie and this one is fun on it's own merits.
For those whining about character development, WHY??? It's basically the same people from the first one, so why do they need to be developed? We already know them, aside from the kid (whom I thought was funny.)
Comparisons to Indiana Jones are valid. However, those who hate the kid, I'll say one thing. Short Round was a HECK of a lot more annoying than the boy in this movie.
Also, for those complaining about how the boy tried to hold up a falling pillar. Again, I'm sure they loved Temple Of Doom (like I did), but Short Round in that one did some pretty unbelievable things as well, so please, give me a break!
I do disagree with those who think this is way better than the first. I myself find the first Mummy funnier. However, the bus chase scene in TMR was great and hilarious.
For those also whining about humor detracting from the movie, I say go find yourself a flesh eater. The humor in both movies COMPLIMENT the action in such a way as to give you a way to relax during tense moments. Many try to back up their bogus claims that the humor detracts from the overall believability of this movie. Hello! Nothing in this movie is believable!!! But, who cares? That's not the point of both movies. I can suspend belief and have fun as well. That's the whole focus of the Mummy series.
I will say, I felt The Mummy was funnier than TMR, but still, the humor is great in this movie.
The special effects are pretty good. I will admit, the Scorpion King effects in the final battle (which was a great battle) did look a little rushed and you could see it in the ""Rocks"" facial features. Still, it was scary enough to make me shiver and root for Rick to kick some Scorpian posterior end!
I definitely like the flashbacks to the first movie. Adds a lot to the overall story and possibly explains some of Evie's Egyptian heritage.
Overall, a movie that I am glad I purchased and watched. I never got to see either movie in the theatres, but I wanted to. Now, I've seen both, and I will watch both of them over and over again. This one compliments the first Mummy movie in that we get to see the original characters (minus Benny who was annoying anyways) further their exploits.
If you're not entirely sure if you'd like either movie, I would suggest possibly renting them first. But, you should be the type that can suspend your belief on what can and cannot happen. That's the only way to have fun with both of these movies.",1003363200,,2502,4.359743040685225

1292277,4,B00003CXT9,"I had high hopes after the surprisingly good 'The Mummy' became
an instant cult classic...but unfortunately it came up short--for me, anyway.  As far as action went, 'The Mummy Returns' certainly delivered, in fact almost too much if you ask me.  As for storyline, I liked the idea of our main couple married and
living comfortably in England years after the original *experience* which brought them together in the first film.  But
the whole Scorpion King thing left me wondering what went wrong?
I realize a certain amount of suspension of belief MUST be done in order to even make an attempt at enjoying these films, but
this one took that to the extreme--again, if you ask me.
My children thought it was the greatest thing EVER...and unfortunately the younger generation asks less and less of the movies they see, and therefore they seem to lack more and more
these days.  Some elements bothered me, including the skeletal
pygmies which were never explained, and how poor the ending
fight scene with the digitally animated Scorpion King looked overall.  Every time the focus came to the Scorpion Kings face it was a very poor representation of The Rock who played that
character...sure you could see the similarities, but overall it
looked poor.  The problem with this is that special effects these days have become SO GOOD, the bar has been raised, and if
something doesn't look 100% REAL, well it tends to be almost cheesy.
Gripes aside, it was still worth seeing and my 9 year old daughter has it listed as her ALL-TIME favorite movie (where did I go wrong???).  Searching for a mindless load of action?  'The Mummy Returns' certainly fits the bill--and then some.  The added bonus features in this particular DVD version definitely make this buy even better, and without spoiling it, give it a shot and I think you might see it again just to see those extra's.",1003276800,,1868,4.77639751552795

Sure, if your a lobotomized squirrel you may find something remotely entertaining in this waste of celluloid.  But if you have even a couple of functioning neurons chances are you'll just keep looking at your watch waiting for this thing to end.
The first film was fun, this one is merely tedious.  The sad thing is, as long as we keep handing the studios are hard earned cash for drivel like this they'll just keep on churning them out.",1003104000,7,656,4.787610619469026

Now, Imhotep and his reincarnated lover, Anak Su Namuhn, Are in search of this legendary bracelet so that they may defeat the Scorpion King and rule the earth with his army. The bracelet will show the wherabouts of the scorpion king only to the one who wears it. When Rick and Evie's son, Alex, tries it on and can't get it off, Imhotep kidnaps him.

1292390,3,B00003CXT9,"This sequel is more sure of itself than its predecessor, which suffered from lack of target audience. In this regard The Mummy Returns is more refined. However, it is a throwback to the classic days of Special Effects extravaganza where the visual element overrides all plot and character elements. What this achieves is a rolicking movie without much to relate with the main characters.
Comedy plays a less significant role in this sequel, compared to the first movie, which gives it a more serious edge. This balance of drama versus comedy makes the sequel more comparable to the Indiana Jones trilogy than the first movie, but still falls a long way short of the quality of the Spielberg/Lucas venture.
It is a typical ""leave-your-brain-at-the-door"" movie, which, when all things are considered, IS entertaining. On the whole I feel this is a more rewarding movie than the first.",1003104000,5,882,5.006802721088436
1292391,3,B00003CXT9,"The Movie: The Mummy Returns is not a terrific, flawless, ground-breaking movie. It's too derivative, pat, and easy. Some of it is downright silly.
That said, I don't care. I liked it anyway.
The Mummy Returns gives us an awful lot to watch. I found it downright fatiguing around the time our fearless heros reached Ahm Shere, and by the time the Scorpion King arrived on the scene, I was ready for someone to dispense with him quickly to get on with the real story. (Better to have simply threatened us all with resurrection of the Army of Anubis and left the Scorpion King out entirely.)
Since the story of Imhotep is really a love story (think Bram Stoker's Dracula), I would have liked to see fewer special effects and more development of Imhotep and Anck-su-namon. Only in retrospect do we realize that Imhotep talks about their love and Anck-su-namon talks about ruling the world. I liked Imhotep's end as well; nice to see something besides a spell, incantation, or sword do away with him for a change.
The writer trying a little *too* hard to create Nick and Nora (The Thin Man) with Rick and Evelyn. Nice attempt (Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz gave it the old college try), but not quite good enough. That said, their affection for their son is clear and to the point without becoming maudlin.
Alex was a gem. I find most movie kids annoying -- too precocious, too cute, too something -- but the character of Alex showed just enough of his mother's intelligence and his father's street smarts that he was interesting and fun without becoming (heaven forbid) ST:TNG's Wesley.
It was sad to see Jonathan reduced to his greed. He was more fun in The Mummy when he had plenty of opportunity to bluster, boast, and cover his tracks with the chaps in the bar.
Finally, I don't mind too much about the ""bad"" CGI because waiting for perfection means the movie is never finished. Had they not included the Scorpion King at all, the movie would have fared better from a CGI point of view -- another good try, but...ugh. Make it a bug or make it human, but not both.
In general: Mindless entertainment. Lower your expectations and hang on.",1003104000,,2139,4.616797900262467

A terrific film, I personally would recommend it.",1003104000,,339,4.265625
1292393,2,B00003CXT9,"The only reason I gave this movie two stars is because they spent so much money on special effects that I felt bad just giving it one.  This movie is absolutely the worst film I've seen this year.  Unless of course you're into weak characters, stupid one liners, and a wise cracking kid that gets more annoying by the minute.  It's predictable, and not worth the energy spent sitting through it.",1003104000,,395,4.535211267605634
1292394,5,B00003CXT9,"Anyone looking for a ""great"" movie will probably be disappointed, but anyone looking for sheer fun will probably be more than satisfied.  Director Steven Sommers took his enjoyable 1999 movie ""The Mummy"" and expanded it out to an epic scale.  The action picks up 10 years after the original; tomb raiders Evelyn and Rick O'Connell (now married, with 8-year-old child Alex in tow) discover another Egyptian artifact (the bracelet of the legendary Scorpion King) that unleashes yet another peril to the world, and once again, Evie and Rick have to stop it.
A contingent of bad guys, however, want in on the action, and they raise Imhotep (the mummy from the first movie) because he's the only one strong enough to take on the Scorpion King.  The bad guys are led by a woman named Meela, who claims to be the reincarnation of Anck-Su-Namun, Imhotep's long-lost forbidden love.
Sommers cleverly adds an expanded backstory to the main characters from the  earlier film, and while some of it stretches the imagination-- it seems like every character is a reincarnation of someone else-- it's executed in a mostly fun and believable way.  In particular, the development of an ancient rivalry between Evelyn and Meela is fabulously well-done, adding considerable dimension to the reasons for Imhotep's horrible punishment in the first film.  Arnold Vosloo was great in ""The Mummy,"" but now, teamed up with his long-lost love, he's a thousand times more fun-- creepier, smarter, and yet at times endearingly vulnerable.
Mystical warrior Ardath Bay (the very hot Oded Fehr) also has an expanded role in this film, and helps ground viewers when they are faced with things like multiple reincarnations and hoardes of screaming pygmy mummies.  Fehr brings exactly the right touches of appeal, swashbuckling dash, and ""exotic"" Middle Eastern mystery to the role.
A surprising amount of care seems to have been given to the supporting characters; they have just enough depth but not too much: Evie's brother Jonathan is back, providing much of the comic relief (but he also has some wonderful moments of heroism); little Alex is fun and resourceful without being overly precocious.  Special care seems to have been taken with the villains: they are by turns menacing, funny, and *smart*, often a rare thing in the action/ adventure genre.  In particular, Bay's rival Lock Nah is well-written and well-acted.
The script isn't exactly Shakespeare, but it's fast, funny, and (mostly) makes sense.  The action sequences are spectacularly well-choreographed, and of course, the special effects are impressive.  Sommers also allows some wonderful moments of human emotion: the sexual chemistry between Evie and Rick (ditto Meela and Imhotep); Jonathan's concern for his sister and nephew; Evie and Rick's love for their son; Bay's concern for his friends (and his great affection for his wonderful hawk).  These little touches make the difference between a mindless action flick, and something that really stays with you after the credits roll.
Oddly enough, the much-touted presence of WWF star ""The Rock"" as the Scorpion King turns out to be almost negligible: it's a cameo that mostly sets up his own epic ""The Scorpion King,"" due out in 2002.  The real heart of this movie are the Evelyn-Rick and Imhotep- Anck-Su-Namun love stories.  Without these and the other great characters from ""Mummy Returns,"" it's hard to imagine that the next movie in this franchise could possibly top this one.
So if you're looking for something great, rent ""Lawrence of Arabia.""  If you're looking for a highly enjoyable popcorn flick, ""The Mummy Returns,"" should fit the bill perfectly.",1003104000,34,3650,5.1315345699831365
1292395,1,B00003CXT9,"I just saw this movie and was among the few that were disapointed. The first was at least ok. The special effects were not top notch. There were so many things that annoyed me in this film. I think the first sign it was a bad movie was when the kid nocked the pillars down in the beggining and he was actually trying to push it back up. I know kids do stupid things but that's beyond what a kid would do. The parents mentioned the kid was smart in the movie but that's as believable as the whole movie. I started seeing it last night but after the first 20 minutes I wanted to be entertained and not annoyed but poor cinema. I put in MST3000. I thought the balloon with the turbo was very laughable. They probably killed Eevie to keep her brother and son busy till the end of the movie. Why did the Mummy's love not save him. One guess is that he lost the Scorpian King army but does that still break eternal love. Visually some parts of the movie were great like the ancient egypt set. The cgi wasn't the greatest even though it was done by ILM. The effects were rushed for the movie to be out on time. This movie left a few more unanswered question. Maybe I'll torture myself and see it a gain.
If you wanna see good CGI and turn off your brain see Jurrasic Park. Especially JP3 since the dinosaurs are the most real looking to date. The action sequences are at least exciting.
If you wanna see good special effects and a story with depth see TPM.
If you wanna see mild special effects and a weak story see MUMMY RETURNS",1003104000,,1522,4.180272108843537

A plus is all the actors/actress return for the sequal, I always hated new cast members in old roles, but somthing is missing in their preformances. They all lack chrisma.

As for the effects. Well some are good some are bad.
Good ones include: The Mummy soilders that leap off buildings and who fight on the bus. The Army of Dogs/Cats (I don't know what they are) that the Rock fights and also at the end.
Bad ones include: The wall of water....seen it before just it was sand....boring same old same old. The little hunter demons...it felt like Jurassic Park 2. The Rock's showing in the end is the worst effect of all summer, you can tell it was rushed.

This could have been a really good movie if someone had put some effort into developing a story for it.  The timeframe is in the mid-1930's but somehow we get to see a turbo charged dirigible!  And since when would an ancient Egyptian site be guarded by mummy-zombie-pygmies?!?
The most humorous part of the DVD was the outtakes; don't expect to see things like Rick O'Connell screaming at mummified guards or Evie getting drunk and passing out in Rick's lap.  Even Johnathan wasn't very funny in this movie and I usually enjoy John Hannah in anything he's in.

This mummy sequel is better than the Original Mummy (which established the characters & theme). All of the ensemble cast returns. The established characters roles are expanded, action packed, great dual love story (immortal vs mortal), unbelievable special effects. Like Indiana Jones movies you buy into the story and question nothing about the physical or mental capabilities of the characters or plot.
In summary: Our hero's are a family unit. We find out the destinies of 2 plots. Good (True Love) vs Evil (Symbolic Love) and all that goes with it. Indiana Jones was basically a single (loner) macho scientific action hero who defied and conquered all a trilogy we all loved. The Mummy Series provides a team of individuals with unique talents when established and thrown together form an unbeatable team.
Indiana Jones remained single where as Rick O'Connell marries Evie and have a Son. This trio actively and cooperatively solve riddles, battle and succeed together.
This DVD is Widescreen and Digitally Enhanced to provide the best picture, period. If you are a PROGRESSIVE SCAN, COMPONENT VIDEO, HDTV/16:9 WIDESCREEN OWNER, with a DIGITAL THEATRE SYSTEM OWNER stand by for one of the greatest cinematic rides ever.

The story takes off a few years later from the original Mummy and features all the members from the original cast. This time, two Mummies are resurrected, the old Mummy who has been resurrected to stop the new mummy, which is played by the Rock (WWF).

Outtakes (Hilarious), 3 behind the scenes featurettes (although I can't find 'A special message from Oded Fehr'. Why do they have to hide it?????) Behind the scenes documentary (quite good) and of course what made the movie 'The special effects' 15 minute look in on how they did it. You know like 'Behind the magic' and the guy with the mask on or else he'll be hunted down by the magicians for revealing their secrets.

I saw it three times in the theatre and I own the Ultimate Edition of the first movie.  WHEN I SAW THE LACK OF EFFORT PUT INTO THE SEQUAL'S DVD, I WAS EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED.  This DVD claims it is in widescreen format, but beware that IT IS NOT WIDESCREEN.  It is standard format ""to fit your TV"".  Well, I'm sorry, but just like the pod racer scene in Star Wars Episode I:  The Phantom Menace"", it is an insult to the film when not viewed in widescreen.  The sound was superior as it was in theatres.  The clarity and sharp unparalleled sounds of a sword are unforgetable.  The picture quality, however, falls short of decent.  I often watch DVDs on my LCD screen on my computer, which, according to physics, that the picture should be perfect and far better quality than a television.  I was disappointed to find that the picture was a just a small step up from a VHS (which is the only way to watch ""Phantom Menace"" until Oct. 16, 2001, so I know the difference).  Although I love the movie and wish I could justify buying the DVD, I'm afraid I will have to refrain until the Ultimate Edition is released.  I'm sure, based on past observations, that Universal will wait until everyone has grown tired of waiting and purchased this poor excuse for a DVD.  Then, they will come out with a sparkling Ultimate Edition and all of us disgruntled DVD fanatics will sigh and reluctantly go out and buy a second copy.",1002499200,,1575,4.386206896551724

The Mummy Returns is a wonderful adventure movie that truly has something for everyone. The cast and crew acheived their goal by taking what made The Mummy so much fun and adding unforgettable charcters, drama, a killer score, ""blink and you'll miss it"" action, and of course jaw dropping special effects.

1292688,5,B00003CXT9,"The Mummy Returns, in my opinion, actually topped the original story.  Imhotep's character, I felt, was given much more depth.  While he still trys to take over the world, he isn't the embodiment of pure evil that he is in the first movie.  While it worked once, it probably couldn't have worked a second time.  The legend of the Scorpion King works, but I had to admit that the way he was reincarnated was a little on the cheesy side.  Giving Evy more action in this one also helped, since it didn't leave Rick and Ardeth doing all the work.  All the humor of the original movie is here, along with some surprises.  That darn stork is still giving our heroes problems.  The DVD collector's edition doesn't match the Ultimate Mummy in features, but the outtake reel is pretty funny.  (Although there had to be more screw-ups than we saw.)  The on-location featurette seemed to repeat some of the stuff from the Ultimate Mummy, but was good for those who haven't gotten a hold of that one.  All in all, great popcorn movie.

1292691,4,B00003CXT9,"Mr. Sommers imaginative and action filled spectacle works hard at entertaining the audience and succeeds--when it isn't trying so hard. The flashbacks into Ancient times are sumptuous and intriguing. But the SFX get carried away and become distractingly cartoonish at times, i.e.: the re-awakened Scorpion King, the jackal army of Nubis, and the pygmy mummies of Am-Sher.  While the Mummy Returns picks up on threads from the first movie it doesn't (unfortunately) advance them much further.  However, despite it's flaws this is still an enjoyable film.
It's 1933, Rick and Evelyn are now married and have an 8 yr old son, Alex. Investigating a tomb that Evie has dreamt of, they discover the 5,000 yr old tomb of the Scorpion King and his mystical bracelet which unknown to them can bring the evil King back to life. A villainous group (including the Mummy's ancient love, Anec Su-Namun) also seek the bracelet as they plan to resurrect the mummy Imhotep and have him kill the Scorpion King so as to take over the army of Nubis and thereby rule the world. Rick, Evie and Alex return to England where Alex puts on the bracelet and is kidnapped by the villians. The race is on to save Alex and keep Imhotep from defeating the Scorpion King and taking over the world.  Ho-hum. It's a shame Mr. Sommers didn't focus more on the past life flashbacks, ressurections, book of the dead, reincarnation, ect--the interesting stuff.
Brendan Fraser is an amiable Rick, though a tad too tongue-in-cheek at times. Fredie Boath is cute as Alex. Rachel Weiss does a fine job as Evie. Patricia Velasquez is intriguing as Anec Su-Namun. John Hannah is  comical and charming as Evie's brother, Jonathon. Oded Fehr still sizzles as medjai warrior Ardeth Bay. Arnold Vosloo is fantastic as the mummy Imhotep.  Vosloo's final moments on screen are incredible. His expression and eyes speak volumes.
If Mr. Somers has plans for a third installment, I hope he will focus more on Ancient times and lore (keeping the sumptuous sets and sexy costumes) and lose the cartoon monsters. Perhaps, a story involving Imhotep, Anec Su-Namun, Nefertiri, and the ancient carnations of Rick, Oded and Jonathon. Just a thought.",1002240000,,2189,4.9375

It's clear the producers put a lot of time and expense into making this the biggest ""Mummy"" movie to date and it was fun to see all the original actors assemble again for the sequel. I have to agree that the ending sequence with the ""Rock"" was cheesy at best and could have been eliminated. The dvd is superb and gives your channels a great workout, especially in the in the rear and subwoofer channels. The image is sharp and clear, near reference quality but the extras for the most part are pure marketing on the part of Universal. The first film had better extras although you'll find many of the same in this one as well, eg: director commentary and cgi demonstrations.  Rent it or buy it. You'll love it so long as you (a) haven't bought into the movie critics negative reviews beforehand and (2) you're watching it simply for the fun of it.

And this movie certainly live up to it's name. I must say that this movie is a must for those who can't get over the Mummy from the first movie. Brendan Fraser reprises his role as the good old Rick O'Connell, handsome as ever, and Rachel Weisz as the feisty librarian and wife to Rick, more graceful and beautufulful as ever. Not a bad entrance by The Rock either. This movie is a best-seller in Singapore on DVD! So, I'm sure it would be a big hit over there, too. Two thumbs up!

1292783,3,B00003CXT9,"What bothered me the most about this movie was the lack of plot.  I know it hinges a bit on sci-fi, but not only was it hard to follow, it was not very believable.
Character development was definitely left by the wayside in the director's quest to dazzle us with special effects and explosive scenes.
Rachel Weisz' character was so far removed from her first appearance in The Mummy that I found a hard time believing it.  Gone was the slightly ditzy Evie of before, and I found myself wishing to see a bit of it here and there in the second offering.
But their son Alex was a delight.  I loved his character.
I think the director could have made this into a lot better movie by writing a better plot, fleshing out the characters better, and adding more believability to the entire thing.
It's worth watching, but I have to agree, if you've seen the first one, this one will not meet your expectations.  The first one was by far better.",1002153600,3,936,4.393063583815029
1292784,1,B00003CXT9,"I thought the original was pretty bad, and sequels are never as good as the original, so right away the cards are stacked against this one.
It does have some good stunts, such as the fight between the two leading ladies, some of the special f/x are cool, such as the Army of Anubis, and some of the characters were great, personally I thought the pygmies were hilarious.  The plot is a standard hollywood summer blockbuster plot (an excuse for special f/x and stunts), but every now and then some interesting ideas managed to slip by, mostly the myth of the Scorpion King.
Eventually the movie becomes boring, simply moving from one action sequence to another, with the characters exchanging the minimum required dialogue to explain the plot.
I would have given this movie 2 stars had it not been for the poor quality of the DVD.  There are two versions the fullscreen and the widescreen version, which is pretty dumb considering 99% of DVD's come with both versions on one disc.  I don't understand why someone would want to buy the fullscreen version, since the backgrounds and FX are the best part of the movie and in fullscreen you miss over 1/3 of it if not more.
Most of the other options on the DVD are either disappointing or simply advertisements for the spin off 'The Scorpion King' or the new Mummy Adventure Ride.  There are no deleted scenes, and the commentary is almost unbearable.
This movie and DVD had potential but so many things were done wrong in so many different ways that they ruined it.
Unfortunately they're going to milk this cow in as many ways as possible, so we can expect new versions of this DVD in a two disc edition with the original Mummy, and eventually a trilogy edition with Scorpion King and who knows, we'll probably see in the summer of 2003, the Revenge of the Mummy, and let's not forget ""The Mummy: The Animated Series"".",1002067200,6,1864,4.605421686746988

The DTS soundtrack (yes, this is standard on the R4 DVD unlike the R1)is of reference quality and quite outstanding in dynamic range (especially in the water-wall sequence). Unfortunately, the film was a total waste of time and I think studios should be paying audiences to watch films like this. No where near as good as the original -very formulaic and it felt almost like a cartoon with its over reliance on CGI. I scanned through most of the movie and I feel sorry for everyone who thinks this is worth buying. Even if a free copy was offered I would not accept -because I would never watch it again! And the bonus materials! Who cares about this when the film is so pathetic. I hope I'm not a minority who thinks film substance is still more important than its technical merits.

1292786,4,B00003CXT9,"I enjoyed the first mummy movie, so I really anticipated the second one. What some people seem to fail to realize is that movies create their own reality, that they take us somewhere new and different from everyday life. These two movies in the series do that task as well as any, and better than most. A movie doesn't have to be Shakespeare, or Gone With The Wind in order to be enjoyable. Perhaps they're not classics, but what they are is first-rate escapism, with likeable characters, amazing effects, and happy endings. What saves both films is that neither of them take themselves seriously. There are bits of broad humour injected into them, just to show they're having fun. These films provide a good get-a-way from the grind of day-to-day life, not to be taken seriously, and just simply enjoyed. Considering The Mummy Returns pulled in over 200 million in its theatrical release, I suppose some backlash is inevitable. If you are reading this in order to decide on buying the move or not, rent the movie first, and form your own idea on the movie, because as you can see, there is a wide discepancie in the opinions on it.

Was the movie as intelligent?  No, but it's not supposed to be.  For fans who loved the the first movie because of the CHARACTERS and their RELATIONSHIP, the sequel was a gem.
For fans who loved the first movie for other reasons, it could probably be diappointing (not to mention the incomplete CGI on The Scorpion King's face at the end).

1292874,2,B00003CXT9,"THE MUMMY was a surprise hit in 1999. It at all of the elements of the great INDIANA JONES films with a lot of originality. Plus the characters were all likeable and the dialogue was extremely witty. Now, we are presented with THE MUMMY RETURNS, a highly disappointing sequel that is loud, noisy and impersonal.
The movie opens with background information on The Scorpion King. This is handled well and this movie could have been just about him. Then, without ever getting a title credit, we move to Egypt of 1933. We already see our heroes stumbling upon relics that relate to The Scorpion King. They find an artifact and take it with them, but unknowingly start a trap. Needless to say, they escape back to London with their son, who places the artifact on his wrist and has 7 days to find The Scorpion Kings lair before he dies. This is an interesting movie itself, but no, we forgot about The Mummy. Well, an Anck-Su-Namun look-a-like and others try to resurrect The Mummy so that he can kill The Scorpion King and be ""more powerful."" Confused? I sure was.
The plot to THE MUMMY RETURNS is simply a mess. It has too much going on and doesn't stop to let you relate and enjoy the characters. They give you just enough plot to put action sequences around them. The dialogue, while clever at times, is delivered horribly to even attempt to be witty or interesting. Sure, they are saying something but we really don't care, because if it isn't a Mummy soldier chasing them, it is little pigmy skeletons pulling everyone down under the grass similar to the raptor scene in JURASSIC PARK II. The things that made the first one so good (fun characters, good acting) are abandoned for non-stop and numbing action sequences. And on top of that, the movie isn't scary at all. At least the first film had its tense moments. And when the story tries to be tender and serious, you can't help but think, ""It'll be OK.""
The special effects are also a problem. It seems as if the filmmakers want to show the effects to you so quickly that they abandon all tension or horror that the first film tried. You can help but think of the droid army in THE PHANTOM MENANCE when you see the ""dog"" army in the desert. How many times do we need to see a mummy or another creature stretch their mouth open wide? It was done a lot in the first film. Seeing it now didn't make it more interesting. And when we finally see The Scorpion King, we are just so overwhelmed that we just want it to be over.
It was fun seeing the characters again and how they changed. O'Connell didn't change much. He was given some parental instincts, but the script made them seem forced. Evelyn is much more physical than she was before. She isn't afraid to make a fist and fight and some of this leads to her interesting past. Jonathan is back but he is given the worst dialogue, so it makes him look even more idiotic. The rest of the cast does a good job but is given little to do, including The Mummy himself.
I just can't help but feel disappointed and bored with THE MUMMY RETURNS. If they had taken the time to stop and let us enjoy the characters rather than the effects, this could have been a better film.",1002067200,3,3169,4.409556313993174

It is still entertainment, it's not bad, but the replication of jokes and scenarios from the first movie wears a little thin - been there done that.  However, on the plus side, the addition of 'The Rock' as The Scorpion King is a good one (if only minor), the development of Patricia Velasquez's character is interesting, and Rachel Weisz and Brendan Fraser are terrific (although a bit awkward as a married couple).

Taking place a few years after the original adventure, this episode finds our heroes taking on the vicious Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo) once again, plus the added threat of the reincarnation of his eternal love Anuksunamun (Patricia Velasquez, whose extended role reveals a shaky and moderately-talented actress). The two groups are racing against time to be present at the reawakening of the centuries-dead Scorpion King (WWF Champ The Rock), who will raise up his army and take over the world with his evil powers. The adventerous scenes are even more plentiful than they were in the original, though thankfully Sommers' direction isn't as heavy-handed as it was the first time around, thanks mostly to much better production design and a lighter score by Alan Silvestri. The film's only drawback is an overemphasis on computer-generated images that after a while start to feel a little awkward.

It's what we true movie goers have been waiting for: action-packed with thrills and chills, lots of laid-back comedy, superb fighting sceens, drama, and even romance all rolled together into one! This film has got some of the best computerized special effects since TITANIC. Everything fits perfectly. So what if there is no really good chemistry between the characters? We're not really here to watch the characters, anyway. We want ACTION. We want THRILLS. We want CHILLS. We want COMEDY. We want ADVENTURE! So what if the plot isn't the best in the world? Not many are these days...but we still find 'em enjoyable.
The cast does a great job - Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, The Rock, Freddie Booth, John Hannah, Arnold Valsoo, Oded Fehr, Patricia Velezquez, as well as the rest of the cast. A lot of the characters you'll remember from the first film, THE MUMMY (1999). But some of them are new characters who were not in the first film. It's more thrilling and exciting then the first. I went to see this film opening weekend with my best friend and we both loved it. I can't wait to get my laptop computer with a DVD player for college next year. When I do, THE MUMMY RETURNS and THE MUMMY are going to be the first two DVDs I plan to buy! This is a must-see and a must-own on DVD.

Too much of a good thing...what ever happened to leaving something to the imagination or affecting the viewer psychologically? Still, the adventure was there, most of the characters were likable, and some of the special effects really did the trick. Those little guys running around in the jungle were pretty freaky. Some of the effects seemed a bit outdated however. Like when the Scorpion King shows up in the end...the special effects looked so 1996. Not a long time, true, but as far as new technology in computer animation goes that's like 30 years ago. He looked so fake and computerized and generally left me unimpressed, to say the least.

The real star of the flick is Oded Fehr as the fearless desert nomad Ardeth Bay. The final battle scene between his desert warriors and the evil Anubis creatures is the high point of the movie. Rachel Weisz' character Evie Carnahan takes a new dimension as she battles the returning Egyptian princess Anuck-Sun-Amoon played by Patricia Velasquez. As with the first installment, the action goes from Indiana Jones-type situation to situation until the final confrontation between O'Connell (Brendan Fraser), The Mummy - Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo) and The Scorpion King.

The Mummy Returns, in my mind, was a great summer blockbuster film that had all the elements, romance, horror, humor, and quite a lot of action.  Personally, I think it is a number of steps above The Mummy (1999), since it devoes more into the history of the main characters more so than the first one ever did, and what actually led up to the teaser in The Mummy, the action scenes actually blend in quite well, and even if the movies were only made less than a year and a half apart, the special effects are double the amount and work than the first one.

1293129,2,B00003CXT9,"The Mummy movies are Indiana Jones Lite. Not all the calories and half the fat of an Indian Jones; perfect for when you're in the mood for something funny, adventurous, and likable, but not for anything you'd take too seriously. Lets face it, you just can't make ""Last Crusade"" or ""Raiders of the Lost Arc"" movies all the time. Then The Mummy and its sequal, the Mummy Returns was released. Both are great for those days when you just want junk food in an adventure-comedy. And both films deliver very well.
The MUMMY RETURNS has more great one-liners from the hysterical and under-rated missing-link actor Fraser; a new, though waxxy looking, villian played by the wrestler the Rock, I'm told; and, to make it even better, Rachel Weisz's character has found the kick-butt knife fighting side of herself, which makes for not only a great character addition, but also some great ending scenes. Plus, viewers will be glad to see SLIDING DOOR's lead actor with more film time in the MUMMY RETURNS as the hysterical brother of Weisz's character, who shone so brightly in the first, and does an even better job in MUMMY RETURNS.

For ultimate enjoyment, do not take them seriously, but enjoy them for what they are, which are very fun movies. For an even more Ultimate enjoyment, wait and buy the ULTIMATE edition of the MUMMY RETURNS, ...which will most likely be released in a few weeks. It will probably hold all the gongs and whistles of this release, as well as another CD with more great making of docs and etc like the MUMMY ULTIMATE EDITION's had.

1293131,1,B00003CXT9,"I didn't want to see this movie. I really didn't, but I was dragged into doing do. I already had an acrid taste in my mouth when I sat down in the theater. Thence the film poured forth.
This was the second worst movie I've ever seen in theaters, the worst being 'Mission to Mars'. Every single aspect of the film displeased me, from the actors to the script to the special effects.
Brendan Fraser leads the cast in this flick and I must say I liked him considerably better when he was frozen inside a block of ice in 'Encino Man'. In fact Pauly Shore would have been more convincing as the hero in this movie.  Along with Fraser, 'The Rock' is thrown at us as 'The Scorpion King'. If you don't know who 'The Rock' is, well picture an actual rock being thrown at you and it will almost hurt as much as watching his performance in 'The Mummy Returns'. I'd guess the only reason the guy was cast in this film was to appeal to the wrestling audience. To their dismay though (and my delight) our sedimentary friend only appears once in the beginning and then again at the end, but as a computer-generated man-scorpion. If you think you understand the story by now you don't.
The script unfortuantly was no better than the shoddy actors. If you think you understand ancient Egyptian history forget it, because this version is much more painful and exciting. I won't go into the details of the story (I don't want to ruin it for any sadist who might actually buy this movie), but it makes about as much sense as a madlib.
Lastly I'll touch on the special effects. When most people go to a movie like this, they don't expect a good story or well-defined characters. They want big explosions, computer-generated dinosaurs, and maybe some full-frontal nudity. The Mummy Returns tries to give you all but the last, and it succeeds. We're presented with a mindless parade of cg mummies, rocket-powered blimps, an army of anubises (what's anubis plural?), and a spectacularily fake looking man-scorpion hybrid. I love pop culture.
If you haven't caught on by now, DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE. If you do hollywood might actually be tempted to make a third flick in this series.",1000857600,4,2157,4.544987146529563

Indiana Jonesis my favorite Triology of all time and I was ecstatic when I saw the first 20 minutes of The Mummy because it revisited my favorite things about movies.

Why is there a problem with films with special effects. The moment someone has make up on it is a special effect, no?
Yes, it would be a lie to say that the film has some deep meaning or is historically correct ( there is much debate about the current accepted history of Egypt, anyway) and the film makes no attempt to take itself seriously. The first movie had the pyramids on the banks of the nile AND at Thebes, but is aimimg for a ""look"" rather than accuracy.....was there a ""Private Ryan"", a ""Judah Ben Hur""? I could go on.
Obviously, we all have different tastes (imagine how boring films would be if they were all the same because we all liked the same thing!)

1293222,4,B00003CXT9,"In The Mummy, we saw unlikely characters come together to face an unspeakable evil.  You had an ex Legionnaire, played by Fraser, a clumsy but beautiful librarian (Weisz), her gold hungry brother, and an Arabian holy warrior fighting to keep a mystical mummy from coming to full power.  It was a great romp and we had a blast watching it.  In my opinion, the best thing about the Mummy Returns is that not only does the Mummy return, so does everyone else...well at least everyone who may not have died in the first one.  It is great to see all the familiar characters come back.  Once again, the believability and plot are stretched to their limits but also once again, the movie moves at a blinding pace.  The action and story are well structured, and the script is solid, if not hokey at times.  The story is more original, dealing with the reincarnation of Imhotep's lover as well as raising the Mummy again as well.  A chase begins, as Rick and Evelyn (and friends) pursue Imhotep and his allies across the desert.  In the tradition of making a sequel bigger and better, the formula sometimes gets too big for it's own borders, but director Stephen Sommers seems to know when to draw the line in most cases.  He maintains control and still keeps the movie from going awry.  The special effects are once again incredible, but in some places, too much CGI may have been used.  The fight scene at the end would have been better if they had toned down certain aspects.  I won't say more about it for fear or ruining it for those who may not have seen it, but if you liked the first movie, there is no reason why you wouldn't like this one.

In the case of The Mummy Returns more is less. Sommers does a nice job of reintroducing elements and characters from the first film without remaking it. While the film has its moments, it's a bit too predictable and lacking much of the sparks of the first film.
I have to give Sommers credit as he could just have remade the first film scene for scene with more gore. Instead he attempts to come up with a film that builds on The Mummy. Unfortunately, he isn't completely successful. Still, he does manage to provide a fun thrill ride for two hours.
Just as the second Indiana Jones film (and, yes, even the third film in the series) coudln't quite equal the impact of the first, TMR is at a disadvantage from the first frame. It's a been there done that type of film. TMR works best if you view it much like the Indiana Jones films; the first film was merely the first episode of a 1940's ""serial"". The thrills can be difficult to maintain but sometimes just going along for the ride is enough. TMR doesn't recapture the sense of wonder evident in the first film but does manage to transcend the problems of most sequels. Credit must be given to the performers who clearly are having a blast returning to their roles and Sommers' script which still manages to infuse thrills, chills and wit in all the proper places.",999907200,,1476,4.430147058823529

1293348,5,B00003CXT9,"""The Mummy Returns"" is a great film to watch, especially on DVD because of its great script, wonderful plot, great actors and a great director. ""The Mummy"" was an instant cinema classic because of its orginality even though it was a remake of ""The Mummy"" made back in the 60s. Brendan Fraser leads a great cast yet again in this wonderfully scripted sequel. Stephen Sommers puts this sequel together beautifully with returning Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo) and Anuk-sun-amun (Patricia Velasquez). Of course, Fraser returns at Rick O'Connell. After nine years, Rick is now married to Evelyn (Rachel Weisz)and they have a 8-year-old son (Freddie Boath) who gets into a lot of trouble. Then, you have Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson as The Scorpion King. That was a great move because they are making a ""Scorpion King"" movie which blasts into theaters next summer. Finally, you have Evelyn's brother, Jonathan (John Hannah) and the warrioir Ardeth Bay (Oded Fehr). With this cast and director, there are no limits. ""The Mummy Returns"" is a great movie and an excellent sequel. The box office proves it. This is a 200 million dollar blockbuster so you definently know that the thrills return.",998956800,4,1176,5.005102040816326
1293349,5,B00003CXT9,well i must say i have never seen such an amazing film. there isn't a word to describe how absoloutely fantastic it is. i must be the biggest fan in the world of this film (the mummy returns). after i had watched this film my chin felt like it was going to drop right down to the floor this is due to the fact that i couldn't believe what i had just watched. i have seen this film 6 times at the movies so far. the story line is amazing and as the effects well what can i say they're absoloutely amazing. it is my favourite film in the whole world as u can probably see by my review of the film. the actors and actresses in this film are all extremely fantastic especially rachel weisz and brendan frasier(what a stud)rachel weisz looks so pretty in that film its a joke. i don't know what his name is but in the film alex the little boy in the film is also a superb actor especially for his age. i don't know what else i could possibly say i think this review sums it all up its absoloutely fantastic exciting adventures brilliant etc. a must see film. i just cant wait untill it comes on video il buy it the second it gets transported into a shop. written by michelle garner (age=14) from birmingham England,998956800,8,1209,4.170940170940171

1293351,5,B00003CXT9,"THE MUMMY RETURNS (2001, PG-13= Adventure Action, Brief Mild Language, and Some Disturbing Images)
The Cast: BRENDAN FRASER, RACHEL WEISEZ, FREDDIE BOATH, JOHN HANNAH, ODEH FAHR, PATRICIA VALASQUESZ, and DWAYNE JOHNSON.
The Genre: Action/Adventure/Comedy/Sequel
The Plot: This film picks up in 1933, ten years after the first film. After finding an ancient bracelet worn by the ""Scorpion King"", Evelyn and Rick O'Connell's son puts on the bracelet. In doing so, vicious villains are after him, and the O'Connell's must get their son to an ancient temple before the bracelet kills the young boy. So back for the ride come, big brother Jonathan and Odeh Fahr.
What Works: The excellent action/adventure, wonderful adventrous plot, positive visual effects, and the way it ties into the first film very well. The humor, acting and directing remains just as good as the first film.
What Doesn't: The rather poor visual effects for the Scorpion King in the near-end of the film.
Reality Check: Why would Rick and Eevie go back to that temple if they knew what could possibly go wrong? And what ever happened to all the gold and jewelry riches they had brought home with them in the first one?
The Catch: The film has some of the old re-caps of the first film, mostly including dialogue like a scene in the beginning when they're inside the temple and Eevie finds the bracelet, she says: ""It's just a box. What danger could there be from opening a box?""- Eevie
""Yeah just like what could happen from reading a book.""- Rick So you see, there are some repeats which could possibly put the audience in predictable boredom. But this is the perfect Friday night family flick.

The Mummy Returns is of course the sequel to the surprise hit The Mummy.  Basically, the entire cast of the first film, that didn't die- are back.  The story was better than average, the special effects were the best we've seen this summer, the acting and humor mixed well and the adventure never lets up.  Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisez are a great couple.  Freddie Boath, Jonathan Hyde, Arnold Vosolo, Odeh Fehr and Patricia Valasquez were all magnificant as well.

1293467,5,B00003CXT9,The Mummy Returns was better than the The Mummy.  It had more action and romanice than any other action movie that I had ever seen.,997401600,,131,4.24
1293468,1,B00003CXT9,"I'll preface this by saying that I loved the first Mummy.  A great combination of humor, action and special effects mixed with great character acting by every one of the leads brought back the feel of Indiana Jones.
So of course, I went to The Mummy Returns hoping to catch another glimpse of what I consider to be the best humor/action movie in the past 5 years.  I was sorely disappointed.
Essentially, they took everything from the original and rehashed it in the sequel.  They cracked almost every good joke from the first movie in the second, a repititious affair that went from slightly painful to excruciating within the first 20 minutes of the film.
Combine that with the removal of a central, cohesive plot to be replaced with no less than 5 weakly connected subplots.
Plot 1 - the Scorpion King.  Sold his soul to Annubis and awakes every 5000 years.
Plot 2 - Reincarnation of Anck-Su-Namun (sp) she's back in modern form and helps locate the remains of the mummy.
Plot 3 - Reincarnation of Eve.  That's right, she's a reincarnation too, the daughter of the pharoah killed in the first movie.
Plot 4 - Guess what?  Brenden Frasier's a supreme warrior!  Yep, he was left at an orphanage (weak!) and has a tatoo on his forearm that means he's a magi warrior.
Plot 5 - Resurrection of the mummy - yep, he's back again.
So, the evil people use the new Anck-Su-Namun to locate the remains of the mummy, bring him back to life, and then want to use him to kill the scorpion king and take control of his army of warriors.  There's only one weapon that can kill him, and it happens to be in Jonathan's possession (wow that's nice!).  In the meantime, Evelyn is plagued by dreams of her past life and somehow starts to become this massive warrior woman.  Oded Fehr is back as the magi warrior who spends the entire movie telling Brenden's character that he's ""the one"".
Is anyone else lost yet?  I am, and I'm the one writing the review!
Basically, what is left is a sequel destroyed by overkill.  Instead of sticking to the formula that made the original so good (straightforward plot, solid bad guy, good mix of humor and action), they went one step too far and tried to do too much (splintered plot, bad character development, very weak, rehashed humor).  The idea of two bad guys could have been great, but the mummy is barely seen during the movie (and when he is you wonder if a 4 year old wrote his part) and the scorpion king is an absolutely atrocious piece of CGI (tip:  if you're going to make a CGI bad guy, then don't show him as a real live person beforehand, because you'll never get the likeness right).
A great franchise driven completely into the ground and destroyed.  Maybe they won't make the same mistake for The Scorpion King, but don't bet on it.  Once again proof that to be allowed to make a sequel for a hit movie, you MUST have a review committee of normal people watch you so they can tell you when ""you've gone too far!!!"".",997401600,4,2954,4.472998137802607
1293469,4,B00003CXT9,"I tend to rate a movie on it's 'see again' factor - I'd watch this one again and again...  I've rarely seen a sequel that follows on so beautifully from where the original left off.  It's 10 years later and the O'Connells have a son, Alex, who has a relentless tendency to get into trouble - kind of like his mother, really.
Okay, so there are a few 'seen-it, 'been there, done that' moments, but despite this, ""The Mummy Returns"" manages to pack in the action and keep your eyes glued to the screen.  Best points: the story behind the murder of Pharaoh Seti I in the first movie involving Evy, Imhotep and Anck Su Namun - nice follow on there; the FANTASTIC battle between Anubis's army and the Medjai in the desert - great SFX! And the moment of Anck Su Namun betrayal - one of those rare times your heart goes out to the bad guy.
Most importantly, the movie is about FUN.  Yes, there are things that defy reality, the plot isn't water-tight or rock-steady - so what?  It's an action-packed, entertaining, SCI-FI movie with memorable characters, great actors that makes brilliant use of special effects and doesn't take itself too seriously.  What more could a die-hard movie buff ask for?",997401600,6,1191,4.542056074766355
1293470,3,B00003CXT9,"The sequel to the 1999 summer hit The Mummy, The Mummy Returns is about Rick O'Connel and his quest with his wife, warrior friend, and brother in law to save his son and the world. (again) All of the main characters from the first one return in this one, including Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weiz, John Hannah, Arnold Vosloo, Oded Fehr, and director Stephen Sommers. Joining them are Rick and his wife's son, Alex and a new villain, the Scorpion King. (which is played by WWF star The Rock)
Most people say, ""What's not to like about this movie?"" And a lot of other people would agree with them. There are numerous gunfights, exciting action sequences, a double decker bus fight, and a battle scene. Whoa. Obviously, the sequel chose to take up more time with gun fights than plot development. In the opening scene, there's a battle. After that there's a fight, a gunfight, and a bus chase. All in the first 20 minutes. The movie adopts it's ho-hum plot from most video games. Save the world while battling monsters and men and the scorpion king and ihmotep. Action goers will love this film, but people actually looking for a little depth and something original? Look somewhere else, fellas. At least the first one had a moment where there was at least three minutes of plot development.
Now those are pretty significant flaws, but there are some pros that keep the film frombeing a totally rotten apple. There are some slight gags that are occasionally funny and there are some very exciting action sequences. Not to mention that the special effects are marvelous. (but take up almost all of the movie) The movie is also suspensful, but not as much as the first.
The only thing worth watching this film for are the special effects and the breathtaking action sequences (which are very well done) so sit back and relax and watch this film. Just don't look for any orginality or depth.

Both movies are supposed to be simple. They're a throwback to ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", that kind of thrill-a-minute action/adventure stuff that Saturday morning serials were made of. Each bit of action is 'supposed' to lead to the next, meaning: In the scene where Evie is stabbed by Meela/Anck-su-na-mun, that was supposed to be then end of one chapter of the serial which would lead to the next chapter. Rick, the hero, is supposed to then do what he can to resurrect his beloved, just like Imhotep from the first film. Oded Fehr playing 'Ardeth Bey' is clearly a 'good guy'. GO BACK AND WATCH THE FIRST MOVIE!!! These characters are flawed (a refreshing change). Jonathan (John Hannah) is 'supposed' to be the foulup he is (think Marcus Brody 'Raiders'). For me, both films reawakened my belief in movies. A good cast with wonderful characters to cheer for or boo at. My hope is for a third installment to wrap everything up as did 'Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade'. These movies are better than the Karloff pictures taking the old dried out 1932 movies to a new level. My kudos to all involved!!!

Any special effect that might have a chance of eliciting an 'ooh' or 'aah' was not left out: this film has the whole array of dazzling cgi's.
Rather than concentrate on such trivialities as plot or character development, the film-makers head straight for what the audience surely wants in a summer blockbuster -- huge, spectacular, *really* unbelievable special effects.

What really surprises me is that ""The Mummy Returns"" turned out to be the giant hit that it was. Sure, it made a ton of money opening weekend due to the success of the previous film, but movies make money on good word-of-mouth and repeat viewers. When I saw this movie for the first time, I figured it would have neither of these factors going for it. Why, you ask? Because, compared to the first film, ""The Mummy Returns"" is just dumb fun.
I loved the character development and the story line from the first film (which can be compared to ""Raiders Of The Lost Ark""). However, ""The Mummy Returns"" can be compared to ""Temple Of Doom,"" in that neither spend an appropriate time on story development and focus mainly on action, as well as new characters that just show up with little explanation. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed this movie, but it's just surprising that so many others did as well.
Here's my main point about ""The Mummy Returns:"" things happen and you just have to go with the flow, rather than ask questions every five minutes. How do Rick and Evelyn have a kid? Well, it's ten years or so after their first bout with the Mummy, they're married, live in a luxurious mansion they bought with the sack of valuables they carried off at the end of the first movie, and the bad guys are now after the famous O'Connell family of explorers. Why is the Mummy coming back? Just another one of your average bad guys wanting to rule the world schemes. How can there be so many Magi warriors? They apparently live all over the desert in tribes, plus it's also a movie about mummies coming back from the dead, so nothing is to be taken too seriously. And that is the most important thing, not to take anything too seriously with ""The Mummy Returns.""
Some personal highlights in my viewing experience were: pop-culture references to both ""Titanic"" and ""Dr. Strangelove"" within the movie, the Pigmy Mummies, the complete cheese-factor of the CG Rock/Scorpion King, and the zany fun that I had watching ""The Mummy Returns."" This was definitely a worthy follow-up, not the one I expected, not serious at all, but worthy to add to your adventure films collection.",994464000,,2425,4.589861751152074

Okay, there was a lot of action, but instead of being exausting, it keeps you on the edge of your seat. Another thing: the graphics were better. And it still has the element where O'Connell has to save the world AND his son, and he does a pretty darn good job of doing it. The only part I didn't like was all that about reincarnation. But that one little thing can't spoil the movie. Take my advice: if you liked The Mummy, you'll love The Mummy Returns!",994464000,,574,4.2272727272727275

Acting:  I've seen better acting in fifth grade musicals.
Plot:  Plot, what plot?
Dialog:  Laughable.
Character Development:  The characters are so static that I felt like I was watching a soap opera set in 1930s Egypt in which many things arbitrarily exploded.
I will praise this film in one way: it is better than Hollow Man (but then again, sitting in an empty parking lot watching a dumpster for 90 minutes is more satisfying than watching Hollow Man).  In closing, my solemn hope is that the mummy won't return again.",994204800,,751,4.492647058823529

If you are looking for a movie that will showcase the latest in CGI technology, by all means see it. Just don't look for interesting characters or a good story. The first movie was good. It was one of those movies that in the future if it's on during a lazy Sunday, you will watch it. It had that quality about it. The sequel left me wishing for it be over as I sat in the theater.
The story becomes borderline ridiculous and the acting, well, they knew their lines at least. It follows a formula. For example, in the first one we had the crazy biplane pilot, now we have a crazy blimp pilot. It seems to me that the legacy of Ancient Egypt could help a writer create some more interesting aspects to this movie. Well, I was wrong.",993513600,,847,4.13939393939394

  The special effects were very good, except for one effect at the end involving the depiction of the Scorpion King which could have been done better. The action is fast and furious, the film is never boring, and the flesh eating beetles are back!
  So far, this is the only ""Summer Film"" that delivered the goods. I can't wait for the DVD.",993513600,,591,4.444444444444445
1293869,4,B00003CXT9,"""The Mummy"" is one of my favorite films. The effects were excellent, the music was good and the film was exciting and action packed, but most of all there was a special chemistry on screen between the actors and that made the film so much fun to watch.
In ""The Mummy Returns"" I was expecting and hoping for the same magical chemistry that made the first one so much fun to watch and it just didn't happen. I can't help but feel that the special effects were enhanced and, it seemed, made more important then the story or the acting. Both of which felt contrived, almost as though the director felt as if he put the cast on the set together the same thing would happen on screen as did in the first movie and that just didn't work. The actors still need a script and some direction to recapture that same feel. Unfortunately, neither the script, with all it's witty moments in the first movie, nor the screen moments and expressions were present, which leads me to feel as though the director didn't provide the actors with the right stimulus to draw out an equal performance.
So why did I give the movie four stars? Bottom line... I still enjoyed the film and although I felt somewhat slighted compared to the first one, I only had to remind myself ""it's a sequel,"" never as good as the original and take the movie at face value. See it just for what it was a special effects film designed more to push the technical envelope of special effects for sheer entertainment then for it's acting and on-screen moments between the characters and at this they succeeded admirably.
Whether you have seen the first movie or not, if you like special effects and allot of action you will enjoy this film. Buy it!

Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz were great leads, with Freddie Boath boasting his talent as a promising child actor. The movie's script is unpredictable and entertaining despite failing in scenes near the end of the 2:10 running time. The only irritating performances or character flaws were John Hannah and Arnold Vosloo's cheesy performances and Oded Fehr's character was not explained enough, I couldn't remember if he was evil or not in the first movie, which lead to confusion in this sequel. I guess it's The Mummy's fault for not being memorable!

1293936,2,B00003CXT9,"... I loved the first movie - The Mummy.  The special effects were fantastic, the characters were interesting, funny and real, and the story line was interesting.  Unfortunately, the second movie appears to have been designed by a committee of marketing folks with too many focus groups.  There are too many different elements to make a coherent movie.
For example:
-  the charming batter between Brendan Fraser and Rachel Wiesz has been replaced by nauseating declarations of love for each other and their son.
-  in the Mummy, excellent special effects served complemented and enhanced a credible plot.  In the sequel the special effects replaced the plot.
-  attempts at consistent characterizations are completely gone.  Rachel Wiesz's soul transforms from the reincaration of the mummy's lost love (the Mummy) into her mortal enemy (the Mummy returns).  Odedth Bay's uncompromising desert warrior is suddenly willing to drop his life's purpose of keeping the Mummy from tormenting the earth in order help Brendan Fraser's son.
My pet peeve - rocket powered sailing balloonships that magically regenerate after being smashed to bits.  Does the director think all of his moviegoers are idiots?
Too bad.  The actors are first rate and the original movie was amazing.  Let's hope that the studio can redeem itself with the third movie.",992995200,5,1336,5.191588785046729

1294082,3,B00003CXT9,"Sometimes a sequel does justice to the original. Other times...well...it doesn't.  This latter occasion is where we find ourselves with ""The Mummy Returns"", the ambitious follow-up to Stephen Sommers' spectacular and financially successful 1999 offering ""The Mummy"".  It is a victim of sequelitis, a condition caused by a studio's demand to fast track a sequel in order to capitalize on the first film's success.  This happens at the expense of the screenplay, actor preparation, and post-production turnaround.
Everything about ""The Mummy Returns"" is bigger, from budgets to sets and scope of story. Both ""Deep Rising"" and ""The Mummy"" proved that Sommers has a knack for mature storytelling that appeals to the youthful side of adult audiences, the same skill that helped George Lucas craft ""Star Wars"" and ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"".  Sommers also opted to develop the story like ""The Empire Strikes Back"", presuming audience familiarity with all the returning characters and unabashedly self-referential to events in the first film. That's how Stephen Sommers wanted it, and there is absolutely nothing the matter with that.  Unfortunately, the release window for the film did not allow Sommers to draft a script worthy of his vision.
""The Mummy Returns"" is, at best, a collection of vividly imaginative sequences, appealing humor, and thrilling cliffhangers.  The problem, though, is that there is nothing beneath the glossy surface that allows the audience to connect with and care about either the story or the characters, save for the most inspired writing in the film - that being the scenes involving the kidnapped Alex, son of Rick and Evie.  Even some of that gloss remains rough and unpolished, especially during the last moments of the film when a large CGI creature is rendered so poorly that a Ray Harryhausen model would have been better.
Perhaps the most symbolic element of the film's failings is Sommers' cinematography this time around.  For his combat scenes, Sommers employs the chaotic camera motions made famous in ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Gladiator"".  The effect fails completely here, rendering what might have been some excellent duels, shoot-outs or whatnot into senseless, irrelevant blurs.  Sommers had a surefooted style he brought to his earlier works, but abandons here, no doubt feeling the pressure to create a ""hit"". Ultimately, the problem with ""The Mummy Returns"" is the fact that it could have and, with more time, would have been a much better film.  Even beyond its disappointments, the film gets a three-star rating based solely on the many wonderful characters Sommers created and the actors who pull off the roles so well.  There is much to commend about ""The Mummy Returns"", but the film it might have been will remain forever shrouded in the realm of ""what if"".  Shame on the studio system for rushing this film out.  The strengths of Sommers' previous movies were the smart script and tight, well-paced plot.  Let's hope he lets his next screenplay/project stay buried a little longer before digging it out.",992736000,,3055,5.15587044534413

That movie had something of a slow start, but that was understandable because the audience going in had no idea who anyone was or what was going on. However, this sequel avoids the trap so many other sequels have fallen into by not wasting any time explaining things that were already explained in the original. This alows for an absolutely nonstop pace and action that never lets up.

My friend missed the first ten minutes and never quite figured out what the Scorpion King had to do with anything despite my attempts to explain.  Rick an Evelyn are now married and have a son.  The three of them are the three corners of an ancient legend set into action thousands of years ago and each must fulfill his or her part.  Imhotep and Anak Su Namun are also back with the original actors doing an excellent job.
The movie was nonstop action mixed with legends and beliefs that even if you don't share, make the movie even more interesting.  Not too many of the jokes were the same as in the first film, just enough to make them funny if you recognized them.

1294089,3,B00003CXT9,"Starting off the summer this year is ""The Mummy Returns"", which offers a semi-good popcorn flick. If it were looked at as a pure popcorn flick, then I would give the film four stars, not three. But I am rating this film as a film in general. ""The Mummy Returns"" is based around the idea of reincarnation, and without that the story of ""the Mummy Returns"" would not be possible. It is almost as if they had to find an excuse to bring long dead characters back so that people will already be familiarized with the characters. Steven Sommers wrote the script and directed the film. The script itself had to have extremely small amounts of dialogue for each character and then a description of the CGI image that would follow. There are two things that are being used as tools to fill the theatre seats; the special effects and of course ""the Rock"". The special effects were supposed to look photo real but ended up looking a little cartoony. ILM worked very hard to bring various egyptian creatures to life, but they just made the deadline for finishing all of the work needed. It is a shame that they did not have the time to fine tune all of their work and I think it would have helped to produce a film that is a little bit better by setting a later release date. ""The Mummy Returns"" is set around 10 years after the original. Rick(Brenden Frasier) and Evy(Rachel Weisz) are now married and they take their son Alex(Freddie Boath) on their own personal archealogical digs. John Hannah, Arnold Vosloo, and Oded Fere all reprise the roles that they played in the first film. The Rock plays the scorpion King, an egyptian leader who falls and sells his soul to Anubis for a last chance at taking over Hamunaptra. He barely makes an appearence in this film and his character is being played as a major one on the poster and in various T.V. specials. The army of Anubis fight the maji in a battle invloving thousands of computer generated warriors against the tribe of protectors. It is funny that the enemy is defeated so easily and it almost makes no sense that they could die at all. It is supposed to be the greatest army in the heavens but with a simple slicing off of the head, they are no more than dust. ""The Mummy Returns"" features some of the same basic ideas concerning special effects that were in the first film which gives a dejavou feel. Now they are shooting ""The Scorpion King"" which stars the Rock in a role that I don't believe could be the main character in a full length film. The Rock is a good actor as he has proven on the WWF, but it is not him but the character of the scorpion king which is one dimensional and hardly worth any future consideration. There are an incredible amount of hard to believe subplots in ""The Mummy Returns"" and when describing the change in the character of Evy from the original to the sequel, one can compare her to the change that Linda Hamilton had taken between both ""Terminator"" films. It may be summer, but that doesn't mean that our standard for good films should be lowered. If you want to see a quality film concerning the mummy rent the original or the old Boris Carlof one.",992563200,,3132,4.448695652173913

The bracelet is found by the now married couple, Rick and Evelin, who have a son named Alex. That is all I will tell you about in the beginning.
There are about 5 times more good one-liners in this movie then the first. Alex and Jonathan mainly keep the comic relief. Though Rick and evelin have a few of there own. Great script altogether!
Nonstop action! This is the best Action movie of this year probably. One scene, after another of great and realistic combat. It is an awesome movie for action. This movie has more action then Indiana Jones, and that is a lot! I was on the edge of my seat the entire time!
The Special Effects in this movie are stunning! I have never in my life seen so much special effects, and called them as good as these. The water seen where Imhotep rises the water is cool. The anubus warriors who attach the Black robed warriors are great. The Special Effects are the best in this movie.
The characters, (all of them), played their parts spectaculary! This is a superb movie if you want acting as well. The script was excellent, and the lines were right in time. This is not a cheesey, bad acting movie. These acters know how to act. Brendan Fraser in particular did an excellent job, but all of them were good.
In closing, this movie is worth seeing, and when it comes out on video, I am buying it. You should see it if you haven't, but if you haven't seen the first one, make sure you see it first or you won't understand it. GREAT MOVIE!!!",992563200,,1744,4.303951367781155
1294168,1,B00003CXT9,"i'm suprised at some of the glowing reviews this movie has been getting here. i was very disappointed. the 1st mummy film was a suprise hit, good natured with some great effects. It's obvious watching this sequel that the movie studio wanted a repeat hit whatever the product turned out like. Although this kind of popcorn movie requires a certain amount of suspension of disbelief the writers require you to turn off your brain so much you may fall into a coma. plot holes come thick and fast, the dialogue become banal in the extreme. When a funny one line is needed we get a 'well done' or 'great' from the actors. Brendan Fraser spends the whole film with the same contorted grimace stuck to his face. The acting in places is downright shoddy. The kid character some becomes tiring and i was willing his death at the end. The effects are suprisingly poor in places. the final showdown is a damp squib with the scorpion king resembling computer effects from the 80's. If you require absolutley no coherence or quality to your films then you may get a kick out of the frenetic pace.",992304000,4,1084,4.564102564102564

Suspense, action, comedy, drama, TOTALLY AWESOME special affects. And it never stops. I was so hooked the first time I saw it, I bought another ticket and saw it again, THE SAME DAY. It's incredible. Not only am I definitely going to buy it when it comes out on DVD, I can't even wait for that, I'm going back to see it again. Stephen Sommers, James Jacks, Sean Daniel, Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, Arnold Vosloo, they're all back. The unbelievable cast and crew that made The Mummy truly come to life are back. To make The Mummy Returns more awesome, more spectacular, and more suspenseful than the first. The Mummy and The Mummy Returns are both #1 on my all time favorite list of movies. It really pulls you in, you get so caught up in the characters, the plot, the effects, the intrigue, that by the time the credits roll, you suddenly realize you're in the middle of the theater and now you have to go home. Where you sit and wait for the movie to be put on DVD, so you can watch it over and over again. If there's one movie you have to see, this is it. Actually there's two movies you have to see, this movie, and it's prequel. I doubt there'll be a third, but if there is, I'll be the first in line.",992217600,2,1331,4.182879377431907

The third Mummy doesn't involve Eve or Rick which in my opinion-stinks. Its the story of the Scorption King.",992217600,,437,4.615384615384615

The visual effects are like none other and the fight seens are unbelieveable. The fight seens are the reason i saw this movie 4 times. The sword fights were ok, but the SAI fight seens are the best i ever seen. I have studied Martial Arts for about 7 years, and it looked like the actreses have studied for as long as i have.

It has tons of action, tons of effects, and keeps you curious on what will happen next.

Stephem Sommers, who directed the first ""Mummy"" and 1998's superior creature feature ""Deep Rising"" has once again mastered the art of special effects in this non stop action packed sequal that takes the effects of the original and pushes them further and harder.

I really liked the first Mummy movie, so when all of the charachters I had grown to really like came back and a few more were added, this one caught me, too. There were a lot of allusions to the first movie that I thought were very funny, but when I saw it in the theater (twice I add grinning sheepishly) no one else seemed to pick up on those subtle allusions. There were also a lot of allusions to other movies. One that stuck out was a pygmy mummy that was on a falling log and rode it into the chasm like Dr Strangelove, which you don't see unless you look carefully. And while they did revisit the first movie with some quick references, they did not just rewrite it, there is plenty of new material. I thought that it was funny how Rick and Evie's son Alex is just as much like his uncle as he is his parents, which I thought made for some funny scenes. The only thing I didn't like was the previous life thing, but I won't say too much and ruin it for those of you who have yet to see it. I found this to be a very enjoyable movie. Someone else who wrote a review on this movie said don't take it too seriously and you'll enjoy it more, I have to agree with that. It's just a fun movie to escape from your world for a while.

This movie was seat gripping scary at times with anticipating scenes of the next move.  You will not be disappointed in this scienfic filled with mummies, demons, scorpion and lots of fighting.

The Originals may be All-Round Better Films, but their Sequels are such Action Packed, Fun-Filled Thrill rides I Simply Have to rate them As Good, If Not Better.
Brandon Fraser, Rachel Weisz, Oded Fuer and John Hannah all return for another Bout with the undead, and Arnold Vosloo and Patricia Velasquez come Back from the Dead just to be Sent Straight Back. (please don't take that as a Spoiler, you know Very well how this film will turn out) Also making the Return Trip is Writer/Director Steven Sommers, who Once Again fills the Enjoyment level to Boiling Point. The films Real star is it's Special Effects, we get Jaw Dropping Mummy's, an 8 foot Scorpion, Violent Pygmies, 1000's of Anubis Warriors, Jet-Powered Blimps and Tidal Waves with Faces... Yes it's more of the same, but More of the Same is what Audiences Wanted.
The Story isn't Easily Summarised, so I won't attempt it, the Performances are Spirited and Fun, but you don't need to know about that, what you Do need to know is that the film is Meant to Be... All About... Fun. Please remember that, so you don't become some dried up old Mummy like all the Critics who take this film so Seriously.",991612800,7,1371,4.6929460580912865
1294437,5,B00003CXT9,"First off, I want to say that I never had a chance to see the Mummy before I saw this one.  I regret that now, but that's ok, because I enjoyed this one immensely.  After the first few minutes of ""ok here's where our characters are now and how they're faring since the last movie"", it's seriously NONSTOP ACTION from there.  I just have to say that their son is ADORABLE.  I sometimes wish that the movie wouldn't go so fast over the scenes that were more character- and plot-development, but it was easy to forgive the producers for this because you get so caught up in the action!  The movie gained some of its exitement from being given EPIC proportions!!!  It seems that the whole world might be at stake if the good guys don't win (though they never actually say that, thank god, or it would just sound cheesy.)  Another very good thing about this movie is that the good-evil is not clear-cut and black-and-white, but many shades of gray.  The love story between two of the main villains is interesting, as is the way the story seems to parallel what had happened in egypt a zillion years ago in the time of the pharohs.  The thing i enjoyed most was the spackling of sly and subtle humor...no hero-cracking-jokes-as-he-fights kind of stuff which has become worn-out, but just seeing the way the hero's brother in law shakes in his pants and whimpers at any sign of danger, or their pint-sized kid trying to be a tough guy--adorable!!!!!! --It's cute!  I also found humor in these tiny tiny pygmy mummys that were jumping at them like monkeys and firing blow darts at them...the humor is timeless.  If you don't like loud, action-packed, epic, humorous, movies, then please don't see this one!  I loved it, and it seems to be the next generation of Indiana Jones, except our hero is just your typical run of the mill archaologist father and his wife, your loving mom who is prone to having random visions of her past life and is very well versed in the language of martial arts!",991612800,,1983,4.523809523809524

You will feel delight in watching the landscape and the generated creatures.  The fighting with the two women was great.  The movie rarely slows down...this is also nice.  Now...for what was bad.  GET RID OF THAT ANNOYING KID!!  Precocious smartmouth boy bit has been overdone.  I'd also like to know why Stephen Sommers didn't hire some real writers to come up with better dialogue.  I can swear that he took all the cliche lines from Home Alone and stuck them in this movie.  The fighting sequences should have been better choreographed.  The Patricia Valesquez character was brutally betrayed by the film...it made no sense.  And is the cleavage supposed to distract from the bad dialogue?  Anyway...the special effects were eye candy.

 no. 1 The Scropion King, How did he get discovered. I think they just inserted him in, and he didn't show that much...
 no. 2 Anaxsunamoon, how did she get revived. I think, after the scropion kings intro I think they should have shown Anaxsunamoon getting revived, then started. Also, how did the French Curator know about all the mummy and stuff?
 no. 3 It's strang, how did Evylin (Eve), Rick O' Connol, and Alex O'connol get the piramad. How were they involved in the past. And how did they get re-born in the future?
 no. 4 I think the mummy was good and all but, alot of stuff was just ""Bounced in"", If you know what I mean...
 The Mummy returns was great, I highly recommened it for a summer sequel! It had awesome affects and great action but I think they exadurated on the ratings, PG-13? Just For ""Action Adventure, and Action Violince?"" This is what I saw:
 PG-13 Parents strongly cationed  some material may not be  sutible for children under 13  For""action adventure and  action violince""
 See what I mean...  I still think it was awesome, but I'd be here all night for naming all the cool adventure!
 Also the actors/actresses were GREAT!!!!!
Rachel Weisz:  Very good 1000/5 star acting  Although she's pretty, She act like, so good!!!!!!!!!!!! She was into it and with the story
Brendan Fraser:  An awesome action fighter. It's hard to belive he only stared in 2 movie's. I think he's very experianced and cool. He's with it and into the legand
Arnald Voolso:  Awesome acting for the Mummy. He really acted like he liked The Mummy. He was also into it and had a good egyption accent and was Evil. But, I think it was sad when Anaxsunamoon abandonded him...
Patricia:  Patricia was a good Anaxsunamoon. She really acted like an Anaxsunamoon, I think she was the best one to pick for this paart and she did speak Acient Egyption very, very good!
Jonathon:  Like himself, he did a great part in the movie. I don't know his real name but he crackes me up! He's halarios! and Cool!!!!!
? (I don't know his name) The desert egyption ninja was one of the favorties, he was an awesome actor and soooo awesome adventures. What I meant was, He 's the awesome dude who stop's the anubis warriors w/ his squad of ninja's kickin' butt!!!

I am personally a Brendan Frasier fan and have become fans of many of the other actors from their part in this movie. There aren't really any characters who are portrayed badly, all are well done, the good guys are brave, heroic and skilled, and the bad guys are sinister, powerful and skilled. Oh yeah, they're mean too.
I know that all the characters were in the first movie, but for some reason, I just noticed the names of the bad buys in this one. Anck-Su-Namun is just so much fun to say.
Sure it isn't the next best picture Oscar, but if you were expecting that, you obviously didn't watch one fo the previews. A solid trip to the movies, highly recommended.",991353600,,938,4.459302325581396
1294443,3,B00003CXT9,"So, what went wrong?
""The Mummy Returns"" is sorely lacking in the humor that was so refreshing in the first one.  Like most sequels it suffers from ""overkill.""  Having two villains (the returning ""Imhotep"" and the new ""Scorpion King, too many inept marksmen, and a horde of computer-generated ""warriors"" makes this film too much to bear.  The script ""borrows"" heavily from other flicks like ""Roman Holiday,"" ""The Ten Commandments,"" and the final few seconds involving the oasis is highly reminiscent of an episode of Disney's ""DuckTales"" entitled ""Too Much of a Gold Thing.""
The returning actors are not as excited about this one as the first.  They appear to be just ""going through their lines,"" counting the hefty paycheck that they, no doubt, will receive for this blockbuster. Only Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje has fun in his villainous turn as ""Lock-Nah.""
There surely will be a third installment.  Hint for the producers: GET RID OF THE KID!  Send him off to boarding school or something. The ""cute syndrome"" is not needed for this series.",991353600,2,1041,5.023255813953488

The usual cast of baddies and villians (including our moldy Roman soldiers)are in attendance, whilst a few new ones emerge, including a special appearance by The Rock of wrestling fame.
Special effects abound and the action is non-stop. The Mummy Returns is definitely a film that you can lose yourself in for a couple of hours. Pure Escapism!",991267200,,555,4.731958762886598
1294585,2,B00003CXT9,"I went to see this movie not because I thought it was be good, but because I thought it would be entertaining. And that's what the producers were planning most people would be thinking. They didn't make this movie because they thought it would be GOOD, but because they knew it would appeal to people as a fun summer movie and make money.
And you shouldn't expect much else. Basically this movie is filled, from minute one to the last, with computer generated effects, including two full armies (or more), swarms of pigmy mummies, an airship, and, of course, a mummy. It grows tiring to see, and all I could think of when I was watching this movie is that the best movies have the least special effects.
The action is good, but nothing exceptional. This movie feels less like a sequel and more like an extension of the first. The same characters returned, with the new addition of O'Connell's (Fraser's) new son. I don't even know why they chose to add the boy. He merely serves as an excuse to get Rick and his wife into the mindless fray. The Rock's three minute appearance was way overhyped, and it was disappointing that he didn't return in the end, given all of the attention he was receiving for the role.
This movie is little more than a series of loosely connected action sequences, with the ocassional flashbacks (these are the most intuitive parts of the movie) that attempt to add more depth to a shallow plot.",991267200,,1421,4.5546875

You can expect the damsel who can be quite as tough as the hero and at the same time can be charming as well. Isn't that a rare one in movies nowadays? Rachel and Brendan definitely have a good chemistry. Their relationship is stronger and for you girls, watch out for the romantic scenes. The mummy/ies, though you can expect it to be scary, hateful, gruesome etc... , but wait until the end of the movie. You'll see the ""other side"" of it.

This movie is not supposed to be Academy Award winning drama, instead, it is exactly what it was intended to be, a big, brash, high octane action adventure, done in the over-the-top style of a 1930's comic book. This a movie so chock full of amazing things to experience that it will literally wear you out. Why just keeping up with the interesting and complicated plot lines is enough to boggle the mind.
The cast is excellent with all the familiar faces from ""The Mummy,"" and a few new ones thrown in for fun, including a young boy who plays the son of Brendan Fraser, and Rachel Wiesz.
The film starts out kind of slow, but before you know it, you will have been captured and taken along for a fantastic thrill ride through the centuries with a breathtaking surprise around every turn.

I've got a bad feeling about this!

1294592,3,B00003CXT9,"In 1999, the world saw a fresh and new adventure "" The Mummy "". In 2001, the world is seeing the not so fresh sequel "" The Mummy Returns"" or should we say the same actors return but left the script and refreshing characters behind in the first movie. The film starts off the bat with the O'Connells ( Brenden Fraser and Rachel Weiz) as a married couple this time around with a ten year old boy. There is an evil plot to ressurect our old friend the mummy, to stop another evil enity named The Scorpion King, played by the WWF's Rock ( very dissappointing debut )and his army of the dead. Much of the film relies on more action this time around, with more speacial effects to make us understand this is a sequal and it's a summer movie. Even though more action, it has less hart and less witty that made the first one so enjoyable. Brenden Fraser, unlike the first one, seems to be just walking around with no expression or feelings. It is good as a summer flick, but for making sense and good story line, this film is buried.",991094400,,1025,4.2615384615384615

1294753,3,B00003CXT9,"I recently discovered Brendan Fraser as a real gem of an actor. He seems to be one of the few out there that is more into playing a character than in making a character into himself.
When I saw The Mummy, I was mightily impressed. The potential for a small franchise was obvious, so it was no surprise when this sequel came out. Unfortunately, it appears that the producers latched onto the wrong element of the first film when trying to identify its success. The monster was not what made that movie so great, so much as the protagonist. It's sorta the opposite of the mistake made in the Alien(s) films (in my opinion, Sigourney was the one weak element -- bring on more aliens and more marines but Ripley's story itself just isn't that interesting).
The opportunity to do yet another take on the early 20th century pulp adventure series (as Lucas did with Indiana Jones) is right there in front of the movie execs' faces, and they don't see it. More mummies? Whatever.
Now, yes, the film WAS fun, but not as good as the one before it.
So, that being said, you'll probably like it better than I did, and I DID like it. Let's just hope that the next sequel leaves Egypt and the mummies behind for some new threat to overcome.
P.S. Yes, I know it's a pulp adventure film, but the dirgible with rocket engines seemed a little much.",991094400,,1330,4.43265306122449

1294757,4,B00003CXT9,"I couldn't help but think of Indian Jones or The Shadow while watching the Mummy.  I like the time period but for some reason the setting seemed secondary and not that important.  Aside from the setting being in the thirties there are several scenes that invoke Indiana Jones, particuliarly the scene where columns within a tomb domino around the room.  The little boy reminded me a lot of Short Round.  This isn't a criticism though.  I wouldn't put this into the same class as the Raiders of the Lost Ark but it is none the less an entertaining summer film.
I hadn't seen the first Mummy before seeing the sequel, but this didn't affect my enjoyment any.  I was a little confused on which character was which but as there is very little characterization it isn't really that important.  I have since seen The Mummy and found it slightly better than the sequel.  Brendan Frasier is funnier in the first one.  The main source of humor in the Mummy Returns comes mainly from Rachel Weisz's brother and the little boy (the two main characters' son).  I guess it should tell you something about characterization that I can't remember any of the characters' names.
As for the special effects they are spectacular to see but no better than the CGI in any other movie of the last two years.  Imohetep and the Scorpion King look like computer generated characters.  It was a little distracting but it helps to think of it as mix of live action and animation.  Just remember it's not suppose to be real.
I don't usually get excited by this kind of film anymore but I thought this was an enjoyable movie, there wasn't a lot of depth to it but there were good fight scenes, stunts and special effects and it kept me entertained for a few hours.",990921600,2,1734,4.536977491961415

It is one of my favorite movies of all time, and it was known that it was going to be hard to make a better movie out of the sequal that the first.
But it doesn't let down. The action is taken down a notch in ""The Mummy Returns"". But the action that we do see, it's great. Rick O' Connell must save his family from being destroyed by The Mummy. What lacks in this movie is the fact that we don't get to see The Mummy as much as alot of people would have liked.

Some of the characters,especially the Pilot and the Kid are excrutiatingly irritating. John Hannah,s character has also been severly dumbed down too much. Some of the special effects were very impressive,but this does not compensate for the lacklustere plot and weak characterisation.

His part is less than ten minutes long, most of it isn't even him--it's computer animation and he has one line that isn't even in English. Apparently, though, this is enough to spawn a third Mummy movie centering around him. The Mummy Returns has none of the charm, wit, or tongue in cheek humor that made the first Mummy so worthwhile. The special effects aren't moving at all--nothing like the original, in fact they have an obvious 'didn't they do that in the first one?' feel to them. Overall, despite anticipating the sequel for quite some time, it was quite disappointing.

1295039,3,B00003CXT9,"Consider this a side note, rather than a full review, which other people have already provided.
While this film indeed was an enjoyable thrill ride all the way through, I noticed that the film producers were running out of time and money. Had the money been spread less thin, over fewer special effects and action sequences, they would have worked better. Now many of the CGI scenes seemed blaringly unfinished. And frankly, I'd rather see fewer well made bits, than a large amount of hastily made ones.
I also found there was a bit too much Star Wars Episode One in this one. Some bits seemed more appropriate for a fairy tale than a humorous Indiana Jones style adventure. And while all the characters indeed had their backgrounds and stories to tell, they didn't really get to interact much while running away from whatever peril was facing them at the moment.
There seemed to be a bit too much action. There's nothing wrong with action, sure, but the directors were having a hard time trying to follow a full intensity action scene up with something that felt even more intense - the intensity curve must drop once in a while, so that it could climb up again. There was almost no suspense to pace the action into tasty bits, and after a while, the viewer just sort of gets numb to all the action. The romantic / dramatic moments here and there, that were meant to drop the intensity, didn't work very well, because they slipped to the realm of syrupy romance or melodrama. Just like another reviewer said, it was all cheese and no crackers.
Nevertheless, the film had its hilarious moments, and I enjoyed it. Just like a roller coaster ride.",990403200,,1645,4.617747440273037

However, when the roller coaster repeatedly goes up and down in a predicable pattern it becomes boring. The film Mummy Returns has a very predicable pattern, which exhaust the viewer in during the first half hour. There was no room for reflection of the theme, plots, or story. But then again, the story is thinner than air in vacuum. Therefore, I get the feeling that the director Stephen Sommers gives a feeble attempt to save the film with FX and creatures.

I have read many reviews by many different people of this movie! Many who did not enjoy it say that their is no plot. I do not see this because the story flows very nicely. It starts with the O'Connell's who are on a dig in Egypt when the find the bracelet of the Scorpian King and when their son Alex puts the bracelet on the story just flows off of that.  I have also heard people say that, unlike the first one where Brendon Fraser's character goes on the hunt to save everyone and is not just waiting around for stuff to happen, he just reacts to thing that happen to him. I think it is better that he reacts to things(he goes and gets Evelyn when she is taken and the same for his son) because he has a family and the most important thing to him now is that he has the people that he loves around him and he should not be off risking his life when he has others to love and who love and care about him.  The last thing that I have heard many people complain about is that there is not enough character development but I totally disagree on that point as well. Every character that was in the first one grows so much and we learn a great deal about every character.  We see that there is so much love between Evy and Rick and that is very evident and we see that Rick has much more to love and care about in his life.  Evy is now a lot stronger then she was and she is such a wonderful character. She is very strong and yet she has many intrests and thing and people that she loves. We can see that Alex O'Connell has much of his parents in him and yet he is his own person. He is very strong and brave, like his father and yet at the same time he is smart and witty, like his mother.  We also see in the end that Imotep really loves and that he cannot deal with the fact that his lover does not love him as much as he loves her.  The last thing I have to say is that I highly recommend this movie to anyone, whether you are going for the story or for the special effects(which are awesome and a reason in itself to see the movie) it is great for everyone!!

1295134,5,B00003CXT9,"This movie is great and let me tell you why. The director did not abandon the original movie as so often happens in these kinds of films. Batman and 007 always have a new woman in each movie. Instead of doing this, the director decided to expand the characters and their relationships, and he did an incredible job. He also managed to tie the two movies together so well, that it actually made the first one better in essence.
Many people also complain that there is too much action and not enough plot. The thing about this is, you have to let your inhibitions go a little bit and just let your imagination enjoy this film. If you can do this, the film is just incredible. Though every other scene is an incredible action sequence, the plot still moves along and, as I said, the characters are very well developed. And finally, although some say the plot is a bit generic, it is very well performed and they do even make fun of its triteness a little.
The only downfall is that it may fall under the cliche of ""it's a guy thing,"" similar to how Bridget Jones is a ""chick flick."" My final diagnosis - see this movie and decide for yourself. You may just get hooked. PS. You don't need to see the first movie first.",990144000,6,1214,4.328947368421052

All the spark from the original is gone, leaving us with a souped-up husk that's all about effects and nothing about story and character. More like a video game than a film, Mummy Returns features god-awful dialogue, wooden characters, self-important special effects and none of the Saturday matinee charm of the first.",990144000,5,580,5.180851063829787

DID you know that more people showed up on the first weekend showing of THE MUMMY RETURNS, than they did when Star Wars Phantom Menace came out? It is a fact!!...IT was exciting, funney, and FUN!!! I wanted to see it again, ...I had gone in a group and we all agreed that it was a good movie.  The speacle effects were breath-taking, and the fight scenes were REALLY GOOOOOOOOOD!!!  It had a lot of twist and turns in it, and it had the effect on you that you want to incourage the screen by holloring at it!!! Which means you got wrapped up in the movie.  You'd hold your breath in the exciting parts, and laugh your head off in the relefingly funny parts.  It is the kind of movie that you just want to watch over and over again. The thing is that you couldn't tell what was going to happen next.  Usually I can tell what is going to happen next. Even if I've never seen the movie before in my entire life.  So watch this movie!!! you'll leave with a smile and ready to have FUN!!  This movie is REALLY COOL, so TAKE MY WORD FOR IT!!! see ya around...",989798400,,1188,4.248888888888889
1295264,4,B00003CXT9,"When THE MUMMY came out 2 years ago, many critics savaged the film as being not up-to-par with the old Boris Karloff classic and being an Indiana Jones rip-off.  In fact, it was a fun-filled and enjoyable movie that never pretended to be more than what it was: a fun popcorn movie with action and thrills.  In the sequel, THE MUMMY RETURNS, the same thing applies.  Despite a thin plot with basic cardboard characters, this flick packs enough action, fun, and special effects to satisfy any action junkie. The battles on the double-decker bus ,the Anubis army and the Scorpion King bring fond memories of the great Ray Harryhausen films.  Brendan Frasier is again solid as the adventurer, Rick, while Rachel Weisz gets to show a little range of emotion as Evie. The rest of the cast is as good as last time, while the Rock does a fine job in his cameo appearance as the Scorpion King.  If you're looking for a critical masterpiece, search elsewhere. This is a movie meant to be viewed in a spirit of fun and, in that regard, this film is highly recommended.",989798400,14,1057,4.571428571428571

I'm glad they have the same cast because I think they're all great and I like how the story continues on and ties back to the first one.  The locations are spectacular and the special effects are awesome!  This is my favorite role for Brendan Fraser - he was meant for this role and I like the chemistry between him and Evelyn (Rachel Weisz).

1295268,3,B00003CXT9,"Basically the Mummy Returns has some good and some bad points to it.
The Good; The cast of actors did a very good job with their roles.  Specially Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz and Freddie Boath as Rick, Eve, and Alex O'Connell.  They played a family pretty effectively and it was fun to watch them to do in every scene.
The Bad;  This movie was rushed into production and you can see this in many of the CGI effects.  Most look fake and needed more work, but due to budget and release date up-coming, they clearly were working on a tight timetable and thus the finished effects do not look good in many places.
The Ugly; This film has no script and Stephen Sommers needs to work more on getting the screenplay to be a better story.
End result; You have an entertaining movie, but it really is no where near the quality that we see in the Indiana Jones films, and maybe it was never ment to be.",989452800,2,893,4.2976190476190474
1295269,5,B00003CXT9,"Of course the movie was totally cheesy, but so was the first one.  The second movie answers some questions brought about after the first movie.  And if anyone is wondering about Rick's tattoo on his right arm, it very well could have been there in the first movie, because he was wearing a leather wrist band for the entire movie.
Anyway, I thought The Mummy Returns was a decent sequel, although a little disappointing that the Rock did not appear in the movie for more than 10 minutes.  Aside from that the story gave the audience much more background information and tied up the loose ends.  Now of course this movie seems much more far fetched than the first, isn't that the point?
If you liked the first Mummy, then you will enjoy The Mummy Returns.  The best part is all the original characters reprised their roles, so there was no need for introductions (minus the Scorpion King).  My advice to all - sit back relax, and enjoy the loud, thundering, soundtrack and amazing special effects and you will completely forget about the little corny cliches.  All around a good family flick and an enjoyable movie night experience.",989452800,2,1131,4.681818181818182

1295370,5,B00003CXT9,"""The Mummy Returns"" is the best movie I've seen this year.  The film started off with lots of action and ended with lots of action.  The shortest time this film went without me at the edge of my seat was ""3 minutes"".  Special effect were great.  Imhotep looked better than he did in the original and The Rock is a great presense.  The pigmy people and dog warriors were a treat.(though the dog warriors finished off too quikly.)  The scene were the tree is blown in half looked pretty fake, but why am I complaining.  There are very funny jokes in the movie.  Brendan Fraser is once again at his comic and action genius.  The Boy was a nice touch to the movie and the black guy who flew the derigible.  The plot is thin and action so fast it's hard to follow, but it's a big and fun summer movie, meant to be big and fun.  This film is far superior in action, special effects, and humor, but the original ""Mummy"" has something this one doesn't: Scares.  There a few jump-scences, but that's it.  I a visual treat to start of your summer. I still welcome a ""Mummy 3"" and I am impatiently waiting for ""The Scorpion King"".  A good title for a 3rd Mummy would be ""Revenge of The Mummy"".  I totally recommend seeing this movie!!!",989280000,2,1224,4.307017543859649
1295371,3,B00003CXT9,"If you've seen the trailer for this movie, you're probably expecting fast paced adventure, non-stop action and a special effects extravaganza with just enough story to keep it all interesting.  And if that's what you're hoping for, you certainly won't be disappointed; because that's exactly what you get in ""The Mummy Returns,"" written and directed by Stephen Sommers.  The story begins in Egypt, where Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser) and his wife, Evelyn (Rachel Weisz) discover an ancient bracelet that had once belonged to a warrior known as ""The Scorpion King (The Rock),"" who, back in the day, had sold his soul to the god, Anubis, for control of his armies and domination of the world.  Now, it seems, The Scorpion King's resurrection is imminent, and if he succeeds and once again raises the armies of Anubis, he could very well take over or destroy the world.  Followers of Im-Ho-Tep (Arnold Vosloo), however, who are privy to this information as well, decide to resurrect their dark leader so that he can face The Scorpion King, defeat him, take control of Anubis' armies and conquer the world himself, putting them in control.  But the key to the whole plan lies with who has control of the bracelet at the time of The Scorpion King's resurrection.  And the O'Connells have taken it back home with them to London.
 So the adventure begins in earnest, moving from Egypt to London, then back again to Egypt.  Along the way, there's plenty of mummies, fighting, and bugs, but very few surprises, except for one scene near the end when something quite unexpected happens.  The story itself gets somewhat lost in the muddle, but it doesn't really matter; plot is fairly insignificant in a movie like this, as long as it maintains at least a thread of credibility and can give the action some context.  And that it does, so all is well and it allows you to get on with what this movie is really all about, which-- simply put-- is having a good time.
 With shades of ""Indiana Jones"" and ""Star Wars"" abounding, the real success of this movie lies in the fact that it never pretends to be anything other than what it is or what it was meant to be, and that is an entertaining, fun movie.  It's visually explosive, from the sweeping, desert vistas of the converging, battling armies, to the mummies and assorted demons and creatures generously sprinkled throughout.  And the hand-to-hand combat scenes between Evelyn and Anck-Su-Namun (Patricia Velazquez) are especially thrilling.  The one element of the film that doesn't seem to work too well has to do with a particular mode of transportation to which the O'Connells must resort upon their return to Egypt, and which ultimately plays a significant part in the outcome of the whole adventure.  It's something that seemingly would have been more appropriate in ""The Adventures of Baron Munchausen"" or ""Peter Pan.""
 As far as the performances, suffice to say that the actors involved all do their jobs well; after all, in a movie like this you're not going to find anyone struggling with ""The Method.""  Fraser strikes a handsome, heroic pose-- call him a poor man's Indiana Jones-- and Weisz is becoming as Evelyn.  Most importantly, they all walk the walk and talk the talk, and Sommers keeps them on track and wisely avoids allowing any lapses into ""camp"" or tongue-in-cheek character interpretations, which makes this a solid, fun-filled, action-adventure movie that is what it is.
 The supporting cast includes John Hannah (providing some comic relief as Jonathan Carnahan), Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje (Lock Nah), Freddie Boath (Alex O'Connell) and Obed Fehr (Ardeth Bay).  As with most sequels, you'll get more out of ""The Mummy Returns"" if you've seen the original, which had more of a story and, of course, would give you the background of the characters.  But even on it's own and taken at face value, this movie is a feast for the senses, and just a lot of good fun.  Just don't go in expecting anything more than what the trailer promises; if you can do that, chances are you're going to enjoy the movie and have a good time.",989280000,14,4085,4.830703012912482
1295372,5,B00003CXT9,"I just got back from this movie maybe bout 10 minutes ago and I was extremely impressed. Seeing that the 1st one, ""The Mummy"", was not all that great i was surprised to see it really had a successful sequel.

I liked how they linked this story with the history that the first movie only briefly touched on.  I did however, think that the scorpion king (aka ""The Rock"")looked very unreal in the last scene, I think that the movie was very good overall, and worth seeing again.  If you think that seeing it at a regular movie theater was good enough, try seeing it on one of those 40-foot IMAX screens....fun to be had... :)",989193600,,579,4.433962264150943

The battles are great and always offer different assortments, such as better weapons and different types of enemies. There were only a few problems in my opinion. The script suffered minor flaws and got a bit confusing when the past was brought into the picture and some connections were revealed. Other than that, this movie is great and certainly exceeded my expectations.",989193600,,690,4.8559322033898304
1295375,4,B00003CXT9,"I was really excited about seeing this movie, but was praying that it would not be another terrible sequal, like so many follow up movies are.  It wasn't.  I loved it.  The dialogue could have been better, but it certainly didn't ruin the movie, some of it is really funny.  All I'm going to say about The Rock is, wrestlers should stick to getting beat up for fun and stay out of movies.  Luckily, his role was to look big and strong, which he is, so no real harm done. Anyway, those things didn't affect the great time I had watching this movie on Saturday *and* Sunday.  The action was nonstop, the plot was better than in the first movie and the actors were GREAT!  The ladies have really good, interesting fight scenes.  It's cool to see them be so powerful and their fight choreography was impressive.  The clothes and human characters are beautiful and the new little nasties that they made up to try and foil our heroes were just as ugly as intended, especially the army of creatures they fight.  Those were awesome.  Overall, it was great and I am going to see it again.  Brendan Fraser is great and just as cute as ever, but Rachel Weiss (Evy) really steals the show.  She looks great, acts great and has a commanding presence on screen.  Feminine, smart, beautiful, stong; she's the ultimate woman, full of love and integrity.  I'm aching to give this movie 5 stars so that everyone will want to see it.  What few flaws it has, it makes up for with everything else that is great about the movie.  GO SEE IT!

1295445,5,B00003CXT9,"Okay, maybe I'm crazy this way, but I _like_ ""The Mummy Returns"". I love it, in fact. I found it to be a really, really good movie; I enjoyed it more than the first. (And yes, I love the first one, too)
This movie is an _action_ movie; that's all there is to it. It keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time. The special effects are a*maz*ing . . . I can't even imagine the small fortune they must have dished out for those effects. Almost every scene had something-or-other in CG animation.
But that's not what made this movie so spectacular, really. All the computer generated effects in the world won't do any good if the acting isn't convincing. The actors, during filming, have to act afraid/angry/etc. at nothing but air; but if they act well, once the effects are added in, the result is nothing short of amazing. At the acting in this movie, especially when it was in response to really _nothing_ for THEM, was spectacular.
(spoilers ahead) But there was also some real _emotion_ in this movie. The real grief on Evelyn's face when she is thinking about her kidnapped son; the anguish on Rick's face when he loses his wife; the affection parents and child all have for each other----this is an action movie, but these are real _people_ here. Kudos to all the actors for a job well done. And my favorite characters from the last movie were only heightened in my respect for them by this sequel----the brother Jonathan, who provides plenty of moments of comic relief but also gets to have some serious, dignified moments; and of course Ardeth Bay, the leader of the Madji (or Madgi, I really must look up t'at spelling sometime), who has some great drama sword-fighting scenes. I love Ardeth, not only because I have a thing for guys in black with swords *g*, but because, for lack of a better way to say it, he is not Bruce Willis. When he has a hoarde of ten hundred thousand warriors of Anubis pouring towards him and his band of a hundred or so Madgi, he refuses to run away, he stays to face it----but the guy looks a little nervous, okay?  Of COURSE he'd be nervous!  Wouldn't you be?  Kudos to the actor (Odin Faer, perhaps?  It escapes me right now) for giving this character not only bravery, but fear (which he overcomes) at the same time. It's about TIME we see a real action character for once.
What about the ""in-depth"" stuff I was babbling about?  There isn't much time for a long slew of character development, but it is there. My favorite would have to be Evelyn, who becomes as much as a warrior as the rest of them in this film. I won't spoil by giving away the reason as to how she learned all this, but it is a good one. :) And Rick is told by Ardeth, who catches sight of a tattoo on Rick's forearm, that O'Connell is one of the Madgi himself. Rick, who has been running from responsibility to anyone but himself (and now, his family) for a long time now, refuses to accept what Ardeth is trying to tell him----that is he a warrior for God. He doesn't want to be responsible in any part for humanity----""You've got the wrong guy."" Ardeth tries to convince him a few times, ""If you embrace this, you will find peace in yourself,"" but that doesn't go over too well. :) It is resolved at the end of the movie, because Rick has a choice of whether to send Anubis's army back or use it to take over the world----and he takes no time in deciding what he really wants to be.
So what can I say; the acting is great, the effects are great, and the kid (""Are we there yet?"" -- ""NO!"") is quite fun. My advice would be, lighten up, stop expecting this to be the next ""Star Wars"" (and quite frankly, I enjoyed this more than I did ""SW""; I'm sorry, but it's true), and just enjoy it for what it IS, not what it is NOT. And you will probably find that this truly is quite a good movie. Enjoy.",989193600,,3812,4.311018131101813

Forget all those put-down reviews by those so-called movie lovers who probably didn't even see the film (more like movie-stinkers!). And don't listen to all of those so-called film critics because they usually put-down all of the good films, anyway. And even if you don't like the storyline or some of the cast, then you should still go see it - at least go see it for the visual and sound effects because even just by going to see this film for that is definitely worth it!
THE MUMMY RETURNS is a sequel (as if you couldn't already tell) to the hit film, THE MUMMY. THE MUMMY RETURNS takes place ten years after the first, and it is now the year 1933. Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser - a hunk and an excellent actor!) and Evelyn (Rachel Weisz) are now married and have a son, Alex (Freddie Boath). They have a home in Londan, England and return to the place where all of the mummy stuff happened before. When they unexpectedly help bring the mummy back to life (WWF's The Rock), they have to defeat the Scorpion King to destroy the mummy.
Most of the original cast is back with a few addition of some new cast members. THE MUMMY RETURNS is definitely more entertaining and enjoyable than the first, but even the first was really good, too. The visual effects and sound effects are absolutely incredible and spectacular - you have to see it to believe it! - and this film is definitely worth your $8.00! Even if you haven't seen the first one, this is still worth seeing...though I do recommend that you see the first (THE MUMMY), before going to see the second film. Excellent!

1295585,3,B00003CXT9,"He's back, and he's hungry for power. Two years after Universal Pictures' ""The Mummy"" hit theaters with a successful box-office intake, the team that made the first film serves up a second helping of slapstick humor, special effects, and contrivances to blow your mind. ""The Mummy Returns"" is certainly a funny movie, I'll give it that, but it never captures the essence of the first film, mostly due to the bloated visuals and certain places in the story that garner a high ""Oh, come on"" quotient. There were times when I enjoyed the movie immensely, and times when I winced in disdain.
The story begins, again, with Ardeth Bay's narration of the story of a warrior known as the Scorpion King, who sold his soul to Anubis in order to attain victory over his foes. After his descension into the underworld, the movie skips ahead to 1933, nine years after the original adventure, and our hero, Rick O'Connell, is still busy digging up artifacts and toting big guns, along with his now-wife Evelyn, and their nine-year-old son, Alex. There discovery of the bracelet worn by the Scorpion King coincides with the discovery of Imhotep's corpse at the sunken ruins of Hamunaptra, lead by a woman who bears a striking resemblance to Anck-Su-Namun, Imhotep's past lover.
As the rest of the story goes, they group that finds his corpse must have the bracelet in order to resurrect the Scorpion King, which will result in a duel between he and Imhotep, who will destroy the him and take over his army to dominate the world. However, upon returning to their home in London, young Alex puts on the bracelet, which becomes attached to him, showing him the path to the Scorpion King's lost oasis. This leads to a kidnapping, as well as our small group of heroes risking their lives time and again in order that he and the world might be saved.
I wish I could say that the story is as involving and well told as the first mummy venture, but I'd be lying. There are too many machinations and ridiculous twists which make the movie more cheesy than believable. At one point, it is established, through one of Evelyn's dreams, that she contains ties to the time which began the first movie, she being the daughter of the Pharaoh in a past life before being reincarnated into her present self. This provides some nice girl-on-girl fight sequences, but never proves to be anything more than that. Rick also holds some ancient ties of his own: a tattoo on his wrist resembles that of the Maji, who were the sacred bodyguards of Pharaoh. I guess this was thrown in to keep him from walking away from the fight, but Rick is supposed to be a fighter, right? He's going after his son like any faher would, right? So why the twist?
The reasons for Imhotep's resurrection are also a ruinous factor. In the first film, he was simply a victim of a curse put on him for his forbidden love, and when he came back, all he was doing was reclaiming that love, and stealing a little flesh, but that was okay because he was only sticking to the prophecy. Now, he's just coming back to take over the world, with the help of some of his warrior mummies which he brings in a jar. He's gone from being a helpless romantic to greedy and possessive; his motive is lackluster, and the romance between these two characters hinders in its wake.
As for the special effects, they leave a lot to be desired. The first movie's special effects weren't all that special either, but they were more believable and fun to watch. The new movie boasts effects that are unbelievable and sometimes agonizing. The scarab beetles look even more artificial than before, as does a sudden provoked waterwall which is intended to take out our heroes. The climax is the worst one of all, boasting an army of Anubis-like animals careening across the desert, and a larger-than-life enemy which looks like something out of a video game other than a convincing effect. And the overabundance of these unbelievable effects take away from what could be a better film.
The movie is not without its high points. The humor and wit from the original is back, softening some of the more intense moments while giving the movie a lighter feel than just a standard horror movie. Most of the humor now resides with their young son Alex, who uses the typical child antics to annoy his captors (""Are we there yet?""). O'Connell is also given lots of one-liners and off-the-cuff remarks, while the goofiness of Jonathan Carnahan is always a delight to watch.
The original cast is back in fine form, though some of the characters could use some polishing up. Brendan Fraser reprises his action-hero status as O'Connell, whose character never really changed from the first movie. This is a bit of a refresher, due to the fact that Evelyn, played by Rachel Weisz, has lost the timidity and quaintness she possessed in the first film. Ardeth Bay is given more lines and more scenes in this film, probably due to the sensation that he, as an actor, created among many adoring female fans. Arnold Vosloo is Imhotep, and, given more lines, his character becomes less intriguing. Patricia Velasquez has more to do with her character, Anck-Su-Namun, and she proves her worth as an actress here. Wrestling sensation Dwayne Johnson, otherwise known as ""The Rock,"" portrays the Scorpion King, and it's probably better that his character not have too many lines; the ones he does have aren't all that rousing.
In summation, ""The Mummy Returns"" is not a movie I hated. I enjoyed the humor supplied through the characters, and some of the action is nicely executed. But the special effects do too much of the storytelling, while some of the story contains some useless plot twists that come off as hokey and forced. I enjoyed the cheese, but where's the crackers?",989020800,,5763,4.695652173913044
1295586,5,B00003CXT9,"If you saw the original Mummy, as in the one released 2 years ago, then you know it was your typical summer fare, with one-liners, a pretty cast, and awesome FX. I liked the film a great deal, but I saw the sequel, the Mummy Returns, and it is even better than the first one all the way!!
There is more character depth and story in this one, and many things that may have confused you or left you wanting more story wise is explained here in detail. Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz are terrific together as their two characters are now married and have a 9 year-old son. As with many sequels, it seems necessary these days to bring in a kid to livin things up, and the story usually gets stale and tiresome. But the child in this film is great, and even has some of the best moments. He is a combination of his rough and tough and resourceful dad, and his stubborn yet intellegent mother.
John Hannah returns as Evie's(Weisz) brother, Jonothan, and he seemed to be the only weak point character wise. I thought he was a great addition in the first film, but they seemed to use him less in the movie, and was the only character that remained un-changed from the first film.
Chances are you have seen the trailers for this film, and you know that they have been saying the Rock is in this film. If you are a fan of The Rock, then you will be dissapointed, for he is only on screen for about 5 minutes. But they are making a spin-off involving his Scorpion King character, and should come out next year. I do not want to give too much of the story away, because it is a great story! But I will say that that the Mummy of course is back, and so is his girlfriend from the beginning of the first movie, as well as the entire army of the Magi(the descendents of the Pharoah's body guards, the guys wearing black and carrying the swords).
I have to tell you that there is at LEAST 5 times as much action in this film. From beginning to end, you will be blown out of your seat. The special effects are even better in this film, and the music is even better too. Alan Silvestri composed it, he did the great work on Forrest Gump, Castaway, and the Back To The Future movies. Stephen Summers has also returned to write and direct, and the effects were done by none other than the magicians at Industrial Light and Magic.
This movie flat out rocks, and you have to see it at least once. There is tons of action, romance, humor, and excitement for at least 2 summer movies here!!",989020800,6,2467,4.251063829787234

1295588,5,B00003CXT9,"This is the return of Brandon Fraser, Rachel Weisz, Arnold Voosloo, and John Hannah and the edge of your seat thrill-ride that is the world of The Mummy. The Mummy was a great movie with great characters and action and suspense and comedy. The Mummy Returns keeps those elements, and adds nothing more. Well, except for the fact that there are 3 things to worry about: Imhotep (the Mummy), his resurrected lover Anucksunaman, and the brief but stunning performance of the Scorpion King. I have to say that there is more action than there was in the first. The movie starts off with action, and it never ceases. One of the characters are in great peril every second, and literally has you on the edge of your seat. A friend of mine who went to see The Mummy Returns didn't even see the first, and didn't care for movies like these, but she was still on the edge of her seat and cared for the characters. Why would she say she cared for the characters when she didn't even see the first? Because the acting is done so well, and character development is done so well, that some people instantly like them. Some people will say that the FX is what makes this movie, but I say it's the intense action (most of which does include FX, but some that didn't were still great), great acting and directing, and the beautiful Rachel Weisz is what makes this movie.",989020800,,1352,4.455645161290323
