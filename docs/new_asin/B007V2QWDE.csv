8522086,4,B007V2QWDE,"The documuntary is full of cool details, including how the band started (none of which I had ever googled, so it was all new to me). But it's something you only watch once.

The videos and live performances vary -- I started being a fan with ""Sleep is the Enemy"" (2006), so it's great having those vids featuring Danko's characteristic ~verve~.

I was a little disappointed that the first few ""live videos"" were amateur-shot, vhs-tape, one-shaky-camera affairs (all pre-record-label, i guess). I was further bummed when some later live videos were from the AREA 10 festival (which I already had seen in full, thanks internet!)...

As a result there's really only a dozen or so clips that I will go back to again. But with the price drop (I pre-ordered at $19, it shipped at $15) I can live with it.",1341619200,3,798,4.6453900709219855
