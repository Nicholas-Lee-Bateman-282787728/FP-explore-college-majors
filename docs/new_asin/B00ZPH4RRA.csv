7286198,4,B00ZPH4RRA,"Texas Rising tells the story of The Alamo, Golead, and the Battle of San Jacinto.  There is a lot of extra ""fluff"" that might make for some good soap -opera, but it's not a part of history.  The acting was superb except for Sam Houston--Bill Paxton was monotone throughout the movie and spoke so slowly I just wanted to shoot him myself....ditto Kris Kristofferson.  Especially outstanding was Jeffrey Dean Morgan as Deaf Smith and Olivier  Martinez as General Santa Anna.",1435536000,11,472,4.8625

7286201,2,B00ZPH4RRA,"'TEXAS RISING'....Ooookay...Here we go....

The performances are overall, quite good...but the History is questionable, with unsupported myths given apparent credence by vivid portrayal on screen.
The narrative itself is over-stuffed with filler scenes and meaningless character sub-plots that have absolutely nothing to do with the subject of Texas Independence. Was Santa Anna seduced by 'The Yellow Rose Of Texas' ? Did Sam Houston engage in Native American Purification Ceremonies before going off to fight? According to this film all that actually happened, and as 'proof' you get to SEE Santa Anna swoon and Sam Houston (personified by Bill Paxton`s naked butt) prance around a pond chanting, covered strategically with nothing 'butt'  mud !  (my wife was not impressed--and she used to work at The National Archives, AND knows a good butt when she sees one)

Those are merely the major 'details' that are revealed here. I won`t go into the number of painfully-transparent throw-away bit characters that populate this too-long-by-two hours tale of 'Texas History'. Bit characters walk onscreen, interact in meaningless soap opera sub-plots, and then they are gone, to be caught-up with later on...only by then, if you`re like me ( and I know I am) you will have forgotten WHO these people are and will find it hard to care what they are babbling on about. Why should you? They Just Do Not Matter. They are not fully-realized people; they are thumbnail character sketches, given brief screen-time , but not enough to make any real impression, thus you can`t really care what they are about..
One Truth will stand out to you: They have nothing to do with History....and History was supposed to be the point here.

Paradoxically, some wonderful factual characters are merely glossed-over and given surprisingly very few lines of dialogue. Some solid talent is wasted here. Brenden Frazier? Wasted. Jeffrey McDonald? Wasted....And they were portraying genuinely fascinating real people ! I would gladly have traded the sub-plot with the lecherous 'Ranger' lusting and pursuing the young virginal daughter of 'The Doc' for just a few scenes where History was served up rather than Soap Opera.

I was really hoping that this would be on par with 'Hatfields & McCoys', however this production suffered whereas that one did not-- the true facts  behind the 'H&M' story already had built-in the elements that this 'docu-drama' apparently just had to artificially add for prurient interest : Sex & Soap Opera.

To be sure; there are some engaging scenes here....But having almost the entire thing overlaid with a Sepia-Tone aspect to give it a faux-age-patina is annoying. Grand vistas of scenery and even the blue sky itself are washed-out by a light-golden aspect that is consistently irritating.
 I had thought that at first, the Sepia trick was to set a 'You Are There' in History perspective for the viewer and that it would then fade into beautiful, natural full-color... ( a cinematic technique executed perfectly at the beginning of 'Butch Cassidy and The Sundance Kid"" just for comparison reference) but, no.... it is nearly incessant ! Scene after scene roll by in washed-out light-golden 'glory', as if you were looking at the picture through an un-flushed urinal after visiting The Alamo while drinking too many cervezas.

Yes. It is that annoying.

 I cannot imagine why anyone would feel the need to shell-out for a Blu-Ray just to be cheated out of full color in High Definition Digital Quality  by a cheap overly-relied upon visual trick.

In fact, if I ever decide to purchase 'Texas Rising"" (possibly after having too many cervezas) I would go for a regular ol` DVD and even then I would wait a good, long while.....Perhaps the 200th Anniversary of the battle of The Alamo.

Mayhap by then, the memory of 'Texas Rising' will have faded.",1435276800,15,3850,5.079239302694137
7286222,3,B00ZPH4RRA,"The musical treatments are trite, many of the characters cartoonish.  It's a second rate affair for the most part and it's bothersome as well to boast of it being somehow historical.  Where for instance is Sam Houston's camp?  I don't think there's any such topography between the Alamo and Victoria.  It's just the old fashion hollywood crap that's been put out.

7286227,1,B00ZPH4RRA,I'm 10 minutes in and it's painfully obvious this wasn't even filmed in the correct state. They didn't even get basic information about the Battle of the Alamo correct. 2 of my ancestors died there. It would be more respectful to drop trou over my ancestor's grave at the Alamo and drop a log. I bet we're going to see something about how aliens are responsible to defeating the Mexican army. #fakenews,1534118400,,402,4.597222222222222
7286228,5,B00ZPH4RRA,"I live in this area, and it is pretty obvious the film locations are mostly very different from the historical setting. But that is a quibble, probably because of the need for existing mission-like structures and space to film. The final battle setting seems pretty accurate. But, all that aside, the issues portrayed and attempts at character-drawing are all very good. Good and bad, sloppy and clever, brave and stupid on both sides of the draw are played out with good effort.",1533859200,,479,4.853658536585366

7286230,4,B00ZPH4RRA,"I watched this on TV when it came out in 2015 and as a long time Texas history buff found it to be enjoyable, yet quite inaccurate. For one thing, the Alamo fell on March 6 instead of March 7. South Texas is not a land of mountains, cliffs, and deserts like this series shows. The Yellow Rose of Texas song did not appear until the 1850s. Other than that, the series is quite good and worth watching. The portrayal of the Battle of San Jacinto is largely accurate except for the extremely close distance of the Mexican and Texan camps. It was nice to see this from the viewpoint of the Comanche Indians who are understandably angry that their lands are being invaded. Watch this series as it is good but don't expect historical accuracy but far better than the abomination of the John Wayne Alamo movie.",1533859200,,803,4.4324324324324325
7286231,1,B00ZPH4RRA,"Wow, it's a history channel-type documentary that, on the one hand purports to be sympathetic and PC (""Slaves were caught in the cross-fire..""), but is really just an pro-Texas republic piece. This show stirs up all the self-delusional concepts Texans hold about themselves: they were a reluctant republic, the Mexicans didn't want the land, slaves were not really slaves, Indians were evil and full of hate towards the whites....grab your NRA card, clutch your American English bible and get ready for some DUMB, DUMB, DUMB American delusions passing for ""history"".

7286236,3,B00ZPH4RRA,"Decent film regarding the events after the Alamo and the acquisition of Texas with a star studded case that includes Brendan Fraser, Bill Paxton -RIP, Ray Liotta etc... but I find this film boring in parts .  This movie or mini-series event from the History channel is just not that great. I loved the series like ""Men who built America,"" ""World War's,"" ""Hatfield's & McCoy's,"" an even parts of the Houdini mini-series event but this movie/mini series makes the classic mistake. To many know actors in a movie that is just not that great , it takes to long to get to the points , an the movie focuses on to many aspects of the everyday struggles an not enough on actual battles etc... that lead up to the FINALE' that we all know.

The area around San Antonio don't got no mountains and it ain't dry. The topography simply ruined the movie. Reminiscent of John Ford and his obsession with Monument Valley Utah.

7286247,1,B00ZPH4RRA,"I made it through the first 3 episodes. Things like this are unfortunately just par for the course when it comes to the ""History"" channel these days. There is so much ""artistic licence"" taken at every turn, with just the first three episodes, that I almost threw up. As usualy with the ""History"" channel, the producers of this show felt no need to be true to the actual history of the events leading up to the Battle of San Jacinto, and decided instead to make up thier own alternate history that was far more Hollywood-ish than reality.

Take the Emily West story line. For some reason an interracial love triangle between Sam Houston, Santa Anna and Emily Houston, a slave woman, HAS to be one of the central focuses of the story. While it is actual, historical fact that Houston's first marriage did fail, and neither he nor his ex wife ever revealed what the reason for this was, The History Channel, that's right THE HISTORY CHANNEL, decides they'll just make up a relationship between Houston and this woman as the reason for the collapse of his marriage and insert it into the story as one of the main story archs. In a mini series that is supposed to be documenting the real history of the time period between the fall of the Alamo and the Battle of San Jacinto. What?  Secondly, this entire storyline is a pure and simple theft of the Betty Ross/Karl Von Donop story from the American Revolution and the Battle of Trenton, which itself may or may not have actually happened. So the writers of this series decided to take a historical event from another revolution entirely and insert it in their production, for no reason other than, I guess, because it makes for better TV in their minds.

Secondly, as for other destructions of history, take the surrender and massacre of Colonel Fannin and his troops after their retreat from Fort Defiance. Again, this show glosses over the real, actual and compelling history of this event, that Colonel Fannin upon his execution requested three things, that his personal possessions be returned to his family, that he not be shot in the face, and that be given a proper Christian burial. He was instead robbed, shot in the face and his body burned. ALL OF THAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED!! Col Fannin really did all of these things in real life. The writers chose to gloss over all that and dedicate about 30 of the lamest seconds in TV history to this very real and despicable event by showing a standing Col Fannin shot first of all his men by a mounted Mexican Officer, as his Troops were lead away unsuspectingly to their fate, who then rides out to oversee their execution. In real life Col Fannin was executed last, left alive so that he would know the fate of his men, then tied to a chair in the courtyard, robbed of his possessions, blindfolded and shot in the face by a firing squad. To not even have the decency to get that right at least is just disgusting. As for the execution of Fannin's troops, they are marched out of Fort Defiance in three columns, stopped in the road and shot. In the show however they are marched out of the Fort, told they're being marched to a boat landing down river for transprot elsewhere where they are then lured to a wagon full of water. They are then surrounded on all sides, yes surrounded on all sides (stop and think about that real hard, History Channel) by Mexican troops who open fire on them, managing to kill all of them with a single volley.

As for the acting, it's decent enough, though far, far more should be expected from such a good cast, though the writing is poor and they are clearly suffering from a small budget. The sets look just like that, sets, they don't look like real places that real events took place. Everything seems small, rushed and cheaply done. The worst part is how out of period most of the costumes are. Most of the Texans are wearing uniforms that looks to be US Army Uniforms from the 1850's, while the Texas Rangers are outright dressed like the Texas Rangers would have been had this been supposed to have taken place in the late 1880s. At least they got the Mexican Army's uniforms mainly right. All around this is a failure at every. Single. Level.",1521936000,5,4177,4.5431606905710495

7286250,1,B00ZPH4RRA,"The label shows the HISTORY channel logo, but then you must remember that is the same channel that now shows Pawn Stars and other entertainment shows as 'history'.  The story seems heavily fictionalized which might not be bad, but if you watch the film and know nothing about Texas you would believe the War of Texas Independence took place in a region with hills, mountains, canyons and something you would expect in a 'wild west' film.  There are no hills behind the ALamo (which does not even look like the compound) or Goliad which are the same structures they used for the Alamo.  Interesting scenes with Sam Houston camped at a scenic point overlooking a canyon, but most everything east of the Alamo is on a coastal plain and there is nothing that spectacular there.  Even the area near the Alamo is portrayed as something like a desert, but all those Americans who came to live in Texas back then didn't come to live in a desert like region.  If you watched the news coverage of the flooding around Houston from the 2017 hurricane, I am sure you will notice the scenery in that region looks nothing like they show at the Battle of San Jacinto (which is near Houston).  This portrayal of east Texas is about as accurate as watching a film about the Vietnam War filmed in the Sahara Desert.  I won't mention the problems with the story, but the action is relatively limited with more attention given to less interesting subplots.",1520380800,8,1435,4.625984251968504

7286409,3,B00ZPH4RRA,"Texas Rising / Sons of Liberty features two complete HISTORY Channel miniseries. Texas Rising covers the early history of Texas and its war of independence from Mexico. The series opens with the smoldering ruins of the Alamo in 1836. The film switches back and forth from various camps whose men are trying to hold onto territory. General Sam Houston (Bill Paxton) is a strategic leader, weighing the consequences of impulsive actions to avenge the Alamo massacre. He sends Emily West (Cynthia Addai-Robinson) to avenge her dead brother by serving as a spy.

Meanwhile, General Santa Anna (Olivier Martinez) with his huge force is celebrating after defeating the outnumbered Alamo defenders and feels complete victory is well within his grasp. He is portrayed as an unctuous, ambitious military man who sees the Texas campaign as stepping stone to a political career.

Theres so much padding, uninteresting subplots, and jumping around that viewers will lose interest well before the series resolution. Performances are fine and the casting interesting, but its length ultimately is its worst enemy.

Sons of Liberty follows events leading up to and during the Revolutionary War, including the Boston Tea Party, Paul Reveres ride and the Battle of Lexington, as the colonies join forces as a single, united country .

More historical fiction than true history, this miniseries covers high points in the nations founding, but embellishes them considerably. The focus is Sam Adams, a tax collector for the Crown who won't take money from friends hard on their luck as he helps start a rebellion with a band of thugs, a silversmith, a doctor, and a wealthy merchant.

The cast features Ben Barnes as Sam Adams, Henry Thomas as John Adams, Dean Norris as Ben Franklin, Michael Raymond-James as Paul Revere, Jason OMara as George Washington, Ryan Eggold as Dr. Joseph Warren, and Rafe Spall as John Hancock.

Bonus features on the 5-disc DVD release include the featurettes Capturing the Revolution: Filming Texas Rising, Sam Houston: A Man of the Revolution, General Santa Anna: Leading Mexico, Lensing Liberty, Men of Independence, and The Choreography of War.",1479772800,9,2157,5.183908045977011

Many of the critics on this series posting here seem to think they experienced these historical personally!  I'm pretty sure they were not around back then...so no one knows exactly what happened, just the end results.  And there were in fact written records and accounts of actual battles such as San Jacinto, which were written by people actually fighting there like Thomas Jefferson Rusk, then Secretary of War for the Republic of Texas.

It was entertaining, the scenery was great and I enjoyed the acting.

7286439,4,B00ZPH4RRA,"This is an historical epic that fans of accuracy have been a tad miffed about. It starts with the aftermath of The Alamo and General Sam Houston deciding to do tactical withdrawals. We get to meet the main players and they are all based on real historical persons - well mostly  as far as I was able to ascertain. We have Brandon Fraser playing a half breed called Billy Anderson of the Texas Rangers and Ray Liotta putting in a very strong performance as Lorca  who goes Mexican killing mental after El Degello was played by Santa Anna prior to the over running of the Alamo  meaning that no quarter would be given and indeed none was.

Then we have the political machinations of the gung ho brigade who wanted to avenge thier countryman and take on the Mexicans as soon as possible  versus the caution and strategy of Houston. We also have the Comanches and their position in all of this  ostensibly from the war path loving young bucks. The makers also throw in a fair bit of love interest and plenty of action too. The guns are proper muzzle loaders too so they have tried to be authentic but some commentators have complained of the colour of the speech as being a bit grand for some of these back woods type people. The plot follows all the way up to the final battle and beyond and leads nicely to the second season which is going to be about the Comanche wars.

Now I really enjoyed this but I was not seeing it as being a history lesson. It falls short in places but fine performances all round manage to keep it from being any where near a car crash. The one thing that is truly awful is the location filming; this was done in Mexico and so wildly misrepresents the topography where the conflict actually took place. So if you want a good period romp with a fair smattering of frontier action, then fill your boots, if you want a history lesson then you may want to avoid, and one last mention Kris Kristofferson plays Andrew Jackson albeit fleetingly and the music is quite good too.",1464825600,2,1994,4.4021739130434785

I have ancestors who fought in the Texas Revolution. And this piece of dreck is so historically inaccurate that it tarnishes their memory. The series was filmed not in Texas, but in Mexico. Scenes that were supposed to be in the Piney Woods of east Texas were depicted as desert (because everyone knows that Texas is a desert, right?). As for the characters, about the only historically accurate thing about most of them is their name. And even if you can step back and say, ""ok, but this might be enjoyable just as a piece of fiction"", it's such a poorly written piece of fiction that it's not even tolerable on those terms.

If you're ever down around Nacogdoches and see an unearthly glow, it probably comes from my ancestors spinning in their graves. If we could harness it, it could likely power a good-sized city.",1461283200,3,969,4.666666666666667

7286459,3,B00ZPH4RRA,"With high budget TV shows such as Game of Thrones, dominating DVD sales, that look just like movies do on the screen I had pretty high expectations for Texas Rising. Especially when reading the DVD cover and seeing all the big name actors in this one, I was expecting something as good as Hell on Wheels. It didn't bother me that this wasn't documentary/history book accurate, I wasn't expecting it to be, but it did bother me when I saw a guy jump onto the front of wagon, fight the driver, clearly miss him each time, yet the driver acted like he was being killed then dead. There were other poorly done scenes that should have been reshot or simply culled from the episode if they couldn't go back, reshoot and get it right. Bigfeet whipping the guy looting his mother's house clearly wasn't connecting with each strike, and not giving away so as not to spoil who for you, but a character emotionally ends his horse's suffering by shooting it in the head, and as his sobbing continues over its corpse, it clearly is still taking huge breaths as its side moves up and down as its lungs inflate and deflate.

Texas Rising was low budget (maybe apart from the actor's salaries), it reminded me of the old Western movies from before I was born which were before special effects were invented, big budgets for makeup, wardrobe, set building and props came along. There aren't that many episodes, all up including the intro and end credits, this will only take you just over seven hours to get through so you can push your way through it, simply because you've paid money for it. But really you're better simply not to pay money for it in the first place.

Since this is mostly fiction if you haven't already seen it, I'd get a copy of Hell on Wheels instead, or if you want a miniseries TV show with big name Hollywood actors set in the pioneer days Hatfields & McCoys is also a lot better. This DVD set didn't even have any extras.",1460160000,,1930,4.4645892351274785

7286461,5,B00ZPH4RRA,"If you're looking for an accurate historical document this movie has about the same relation that ""Tombstone"" or ""They Died With Their Boots On"" has with the truth. I've read fairly extensively about this period of American history and unlike a lot of commentators here, I know the difference between fact and fiction. Just because the History Channel made it doesn't make it a documentary. This particular piece of fiction has a lot going for it with a large cast and the mini series length to develop them. A are a few unusual choices for characters and some work better than others but if you're going to spend the 7 hours watching you'll come to appreciate most of them. Bill Paxton has the roughest job as Sam Houston. By virtue of the title he's the focal point of the movie and he carries it with a gruff commanding exterior attitude. There are more than a few who disagree with this casting but what's interesting that Paxton, as a native Texan, can trace his bloodline back to Sam Houston's mother. If you want to see the evolution of an actor contrast his early performance as whiny Marine Hudson in ""Aliens"" with the confident strength he shows here.  Jeffrey Dean Morgan, who seems to have lost about 40 pounds to play consumptive ranger Deaf Smith, is a standout. His scenes with his Mexican wife are particularly affecting.
I liked most everything about this series. The dialog, the wardrobe, the locations, the direction and the actors. Historical based films can be nitpicked to death very easily. There are people who, for the best of reasons, hold their viewpoint as personal and sacred. I feel that way about crappy Vietnam movies. But all fiction, maybe entertainment in general relies on that ""willing suspension of disbelief"". So ""Texas Rising"" ain't history but it ain't bad.

It starts in the immediate aftermath of the fall of the Alamo. The date shown is March 7, 1836 which indicates the ignorance of the writer. The Alamo fell on March 6, 1836! At Sam Houston's camp, there is a group of officer's dressed in mid 19th century uniforms. The Texian army had very few uniforms and those were not as shown. An officer, sitting in Houston's camp, stating that he was with Fannin and the reason why they turned around and did not go to the Alamo. Unfortunately, nobody from Fannin's command was ever at Houston's camp! The scene shifts to a group of Texian's on a high mountain overlooking a desert. They see smoke from the burning Alamo in the distance. There are no high mountains nor such a desert near San Antonio. The Texas hill country has high hills and no sandy desert! Also, seen is a wagon escorted by Mexican soldiers. In the wagon are Susannah Dickenson, her daughter Angelina, and several other women. Unfortunately, Susannah was the only white women to still be there at the time of the battle. She left with her baby daughter and Travis's slave Joe. We are then shown an old fashioned Indian attack on the wagon, straight of the old cowboy movies! Susannah never mentioned any such attack when she recalled her experience!

7286493,4,B00ZPH4RRA,"'TEXAS' - THE ONE-STAR STATE'
I love American-History, the struggle for Texas certainly of some interest probably because of the heroics at the Alamo.
This made for the History-Channel series is based around events of that time.
March 6th 1836 'The Alamo' has fallen, friends and legendary figures alike, all dead, all heroes, at the hands of 'General
Santa Anna's' army.
'Santa Anna' (Olivier Martinez) determined to crush the uprising with brutal efficiency, there would be no mercy.
Up until that time those seeking to claim Texas independent of it's Mexican rulers have not worked together as a
single force though 'General Sam Houston'(Bill Paxton) has been trying to mould a force capable of defeating the enemy,
the once rag-tag 'Texas-Rangers' led by 'Deaf' Smith' (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) aligned their allegiance to the cause.
'Santa Anna' determined to crush the uprising with brutal efficiency, there would be no mercy.
'Colonel James Fannin' (Rob Morrow) who, with his force had, because of problems with supply wagons failed to go to the
aid of the defenders at the Alamo had taken his force to 'Goliad'
'General Houston' who commanded the resistance army had sent word to 'Fannin' to join his force, 'Fannin' failed to do so,
a decision that would prove fatal for both himself and indeed 'all' his force as 'Santa Anna' after the Alamo turned his attention
toward 'Goliad'
'Sam Houston's' military decisions would be repeatedly questioned as he seemingly backs away from a showdown with
the Mexican Army again and again.
Of course he'd not gone to the aid of the Alamo defenders when asked, retreating when many pleaded with him to fight,
his actions will be a source of speculation, 'General Santa'General Anna' believes 'Houston' fears him.
But there would be a date with destiny at 'San Jacinto' when the two sides would finally come face to face....it would be a
battle to avenge those lost at the Alamo and Goliad for the followers of 'General Houston'.......it was of course indeed a
battle to gain 'Texas' (The Battle itself lasted just 18 minutes)
The film goes on to deal with the aftermath of the battle and forward to the declaration of independence for Texas and
indeed beyond.
It is a well made mini-series that try's to cover also the struggle of settlers trying to set-up home in this war-torn land of
Texas which for many also included having to face the 'Comanche's'
It also follows volunteers and their misfortunes in trying to join the rebel-army in the fight against 'Santa Anna's' army.
As we know, other than a few women and children and reportedly 'Colonel Travis's' slave 'Joe', no other's walked away from the
Alamo, however the film has what can only be described as a avenging-angel played by 'Ray Liotta' who'd fought at the
Alamo a fictional survivor taking vengeance upon Mexican Soldiers as often as he could. (would have preferred the character
to have not been invented in truth, for me, fact is fact, that's not to say the character didn't play a significant role in the presented
story, he did)
'Emily West' (Cynthia Addai-Robinson) who was indeed a real character of those times, may well have been with 'Santa Anna' during some of the conflict, however placing her as an Alamo survivor is somewhat fanciful.
It has a large cast of both familiar and unfamiliar faces playing roles of factual and indeed fictional characters and also has several
well staged action and battle sequences.
However, though it drifted some from historical events from time to time it is an enjoyable series well worthy of viewing if you,
like myself have interest in this period of American History.
The Blu-ray release is multi-region.

Most of this miniseries that runs more than seven hours long on three DVD disks is about Sam Houston and the struggle for Texas independence from Mexicos General Santa Anna who commanded superior forces. Watching this series, I learned a lot more than I had known. The odds were against this rebellion succeeding but General Santa Anna was too confident and made more than one serious mistake while Texas General Sam Houston was under constant pressure from his troops and one of the political factions behind the revolution to attack when he knew it was wrong.  Houston stood his ground and because of that, his forces eventually won the fight and Texas became an independant nation.

7286500,2,B00ZPH4RRA,"I really, really wanted to like this show. I missed it when it was on television and so it was on my must buy list for Blu Ray. Unfortunately, it was one of those I should have found another way to watch because it's unlikely I'll open the box again.

Texas Rising has a lot of great actors in it and the premise of the story is good, avoiding the retelling of the Alamo (other than as a tangential event) and instead focusing on other aspects of the early days of Texas which aren't as well known to anyone who doesn't spend time in the library or isn't a history scholar of some kind.

Unfortunately, the script just doesn't deliver and the actors (and audience) are left hanging.

I don't have an issue with the scenes being shot in geographical locations completely unlike those where the real events occurred. Sometimes it's not possible, for budgetary or other reasons, to recreate the exact topography but even if you set those things aside along with the historical inaccuracies as to weapons, clothing, etc., the series still fails to deliver anything close to what it could have been.

The History Channel uses that name very loosely and often strays from history into other areas but in this particular case they stuck with a historical theme and just made a bad movie.

What a shame.",1452470400,2,1295,4.588744588744588

7286504,4,B00ZPH4RRA,"Carping purists should take note - 'Texas Rising' does not claim to be historically accurate, but the main themes are and the general spirit of the time is fully conveyed.  It is, however, a little over-padded with fictional themes.  The actual historical locations are no longer appropriate, but film is a visual medium and Durango is indeed a most pleasing backdrop.

Bill Paxton's riveting portrayal of Sam Houston was clearly thoroughly researched.  Houston was possibly bi-polar, and was a brilliant, egotistical man with many demons including alcoholism, depression and even loneliness.  Paxton's characterization was appropriately nuanced from caution at first, through conflicts with officers and government officials, the tragedies of The Alamo and Goliad, to the utter elation of victory at San Jacinto and political success afterwards.  In all, the cast was first rate.

Roland Joffe's fine direction and meticulous attention to visual detail was impeccable - from the vintage accoutrements of Houston's quarters, the grubby unkempt appearance of most principals and extras (one could almost smell them!) to the realistic Battle of San Jacinto.  The musical scoring caught the content and period perfectly, and the titles were clever and entirely fascinating.

Because of 'Texas Rising', my interest in the Republic's history has been stimulated, and I am now researching its amazing personalities and its complexities.  Accurate or not, 'Texas Rising' is a 'rattling good yarn' but it is a total injustice that the production, the director and the actors - particularly the most excellent Mr. Paxton - failed to be recognized by any major award.",1451692800,5,1657,5.4375

7286513,4,B00ZPH4RRA,"This is interesting, brutal, bloody, and I wonder how accurate. I love the scenery but some of it looks like a glass painting backdrop.

If any of the narrative is true, it's a wonder Texas became independent of Mexico  with all the in-fighting, disobedience and disregard for orders, and general chaos. The ""Rangers"" are undisciplined, outspoken, and mutinous, appearing almost as a man intent on having Sam Houston ousted as their commanding officer instead of joining forces to rally and support him. Houston is portrayed as a vacillating between fighting and retreating when not coping with nightmares stemming from...what? The Alamo massacre was unnecessary because the men were ordered to give it cup and retreat and refused to obey that order. A second massacre occurred because the commander ignored Houston's orders and did the same. Santa Ana,on the other hand, is cold, brutal, methodical, and near-psychotic, and his troops are as afraid of him as the ""Texians"" are.

Somewhere in all this killing, there's a story, scenes of fighting, and riding, and more fighting, and more riding, interpersed with a few semi-domestic scenes here and there. We get accustomed to characters and begin to like them and then they killed off. It's a series and so new ones are introduced to no doubt do the same within a few scenes or episodes.

There are well-known actors in this one, but it's difficult to recognized a good many,hidden as they are behind all that facial hair, dirt, and blood.  Deciding who's who can become part of the fun.

Good entertainment but how much accuracy is involved is anyone's guess.

7286566,1,B00ZPH4RRA,"I am not sure that I can express how much I hated this series in words, but I will try.
Not having cable TV, I had anxiously awaited the release of this series on DVD.  When I got the DVDs, I binged watched this ridiculous series, vainly hoping hour after hour, that it would transform into a reasonably accurate depiction of this interesting period of History.
I can understand understand deviations and historical inaccuracies when a movie is made about a historic event.  But this series has almost nothing to do with history.  Fake characters are spread prominently throughout the series, like pouring mayonnaise over what what should have been a pretty good plate of fajitas.
None of the geography is correct.  NONE of it.  Mountains and canyons and deserts.  None of that terrain exists in the San Antonio-Victoria-San Felipe-San Jacinto areas where the action of this historic period takes place.  They depicted the Battle of San Jacinto being fought in the woods, when only the north flank of the battlefield had trees on it and the rest was open prairie.  When the Mexican Army disintegrated at San Jacinto, they show Santa Ana scurrying among large rocks and hiding in a cave to get away.  Clearly no one bothered to visit the location of the actual battlefield.  They might as well have filled it in Manhattan.
The clothing/costumes were all wrong for the time period.  This series looked like a Sergio Leone Spaghetti Western, replacing revolvers with flintlock pistols.
They didn't even get the weather right.  The movie is all filmed in crystal blue skies and warm desert climate.  In reality, the weather was cold and very rainy.  That wouldn't be a big except the weather played a prominent role in how the real history played out.
The how the main (historic) characters were portrayed missed the mark with the exception of Santa Ana.  In fact, if there was one compliment I could give for this film, it would be how they handled Santa Ana.  The rest were not remotely accurate.
The story line of the series did not follow history.  In fact, it had almost nothing to do with the real history.  In the movie, Emily West is a heroic spy who rides into the Mexican camp, seduces Santa Ana, then attempts to kill him in an attempt to exact revenge for the death of her brother by firing squad at the Battle of the Alamo.  Oh, and she had a relationship with Sam Houston sometime before the action takes place, and another one at the end of the series.  In reality, she was an indentured servant who was kidnapped by Mexican cavalry and dragged along for part of the campaign.  She didn't have a brother at the Alamo, or even in Texas.
There was no commando-like raid to blow up a Mexican-garrisoned, stone Vince's Bridge over a big dry gully just in the nick of time to stop advancing troops headed to San Jacinto by Texas Rangers.  In reality, a group of Texas cavalry, led by Deaf Smith, burned down the wooden Vince's Bridge over a bayou with no Mexicans in sight.
I could go on and on and on.
This series had such great potential.  But the History Channel completely screwed it up.  In fact, the History Channel should be forced to drop ""History"" from its name for spawning this stinkhole of a soap opera series.  It should be just called the ""Channel"".  Or, the ""Movie with a Tiny Bit of History Channel.""",1442188800,18,3322,4.626279863481229

7286592,2,B00ZPH4RRA,"Texas Rising is a History-TV mini-series that covers the early history of Texas and its war of independence from Mexico. The series opens with the smoldering ruins of the Alamo in 1836. The film switches back and forth from various camps whose men are trying to hold onto territory. General Sam Houston (Bill Paxton) is a strategic leader, weighing the consequences of impulsive actions to avenge the Alamo massacre. This puts him at odds with many of his followers as he spouts heroic-sounding lines while figuring the best time and place to make a move. He sends Emily West (Cynthia Addai-Robinson) to avenge her dead brother by serving as a spy.

Meanwhile, General Santa Anna (Olivier Martinez) with his huge force is preening after defeating the outnumbered Alamo defenders and feels complete victory is well within his grasp. He is portrayed as a slimy, ambitious military man who sees the Texas campaign as stepping stone to a political career.

Other characters include Deaf Smith (Dean Morgan), a courageous Texas Ranger with a secret illness, Lorca (Ray Liotta), an Alamo survivor who goes on a murderous rampage, President Andrew Jackson (Kris Kristofferson), and half-breed Texas Ranger Billy Anderson (Brendan Fraser).

At 7 1/2 hours, the series is way too long. Theres so much padding, uninteresting subplots, and jumping around that viewers will lose interest well before the series resolution. Performances are fine and the casting interesting, but its length ultimately is its worst enemy. Theres not enough material to justify so much screen time. Battles are well staged, for the most part, but the elimination of the Alamo siege is a misstep. This might have been covered in a montage, just to set the stage for what follows. Instead, the viewer is thrown into the aftermath of the siege. Its almost like coming into a movie theatre and missing not only a big sequence, but the springboard for everything to follow.

Bonus features on the Blu-ray release include profiles on Sam Houston and Santa Anna, and a behind-the-scenes, making-of featurette. A digital HD copy is included.",1440892800,10,2101,5.081159420289855

7286597,1,B00ZPH4RRA,"In 2015, television can boast of the finest productions in its history.  There is outstanding writing, acting and production that, in the past, was only seen on the big screen.  Indeed, movies seem stuck in the mire of special effects and computer generated imaging having forsaken all semblance of creative substance.  Yes, TV is the current bastion of quality dramatic productions.  But ""Texas Rising"" is not one of them.

I looked forward to watching this mini-series on the formation of the Great State of Texas.  But early into the first episode, I was confounded by the worst writing and acting I've witnessed on a purported ""major"" production.  Nevertheless, the DVR continued to record this POS and I continued to watch the train wreck for the sheer entertainment value of pure incompetence.

Being of the Baby Boom generation, I've been subject to the history of Texas in various forms for decades.  Most of it was from movies and TV and books of fiction and I'm sure most of it has been myth.  But all this exposure has led to some familiarity with the core facts involved.  I'm also very familiar with the geography of Texas, having spent a great deal of time visiting most of the areas of the state over many years.  I wish the people involved in ""Texas Rising"" had spent a little time becoming familiar with the state before rushing into making this travesty.

History is frequently twisted by poetic license.  I can accept that a dramatic presentation of an historical event will contain fictional elements.  But the writers who came up with the peripheral characters and events in ""Texas Rising"" just recycled writing elements that I thought had been tossed out in the 1980's.  The characterizations are so stereotypical and predictable it adds to the whole comic atmosphere of incompetence.  As for the truly historical characters portrayals, the writers apparently felt the legends and myths surrounding these real people has more validity than their actual lives.  Take Emily West, for instance.  History indicates Ms West was an indentured servant of mixed race who was held captive by the Mexican army as it was engaged in the fight with the Texas rebels.  The writers of ""Texas Rising"" turned her into a former New Orleans whore who spied for Sam Houston (her lover) by becoming the mistress of Santa Ana.  This, of course, should make for interesting theatre but, instead, made for a series of totally unbelievable episodes without really adding anything to the plot.

While some have criticized the acting, I'm going to cut them some slack here.  The cast seems to just be crew members of a sinking ship.  They're doing their job as best they can so they can draw their paychecks, hit the life rafts and make it home intact.  This is a truly awful production but most of us have worked at bad jobs before.  We did it for the pay, not the satisfaction of performing an important role in life.  It's an embarrassment to the actors because their faces and performances are on display.  That's sad because there wasn't much they could do with this wretched job to make it better.

The real stake through the heart of ""Texas Rising"" is the locale.  All the action for the events portrayed happened in Southern and Southeastern Texas.  This is not desert country.  Repeat >NOT< desert.  This is really a geography of lowlands, bayous, coastal plains and woodlands.  At the Battle of San Jacinto, Santa Ana was trying to escape through a swamp when he was captured by the Texas army.  San Jacinto is adjacent to the current city of Houston and this is NOT in the desert.  But ""Texas Rising"" was filmed in Mexico and in the Mexican desert.  In ""Texas Rising"", Santa Ana is captured while meandering around boulders through dry, rocky terrain.  The rationale for the shooting location is beyond me.  Again, this adds to the comical ineptness of the whole production.

In summary, ""Texas Rising"" is truly an awful mini-series and a waste of all the resources used for the production.  It's a great example of incompetence and, if for no other reason, it might be worth watching just to see how not to do this type of work.",1437868800,70,4135,4.783898305084746
7286598,1,B00ZPH4RRA,"Nearly everything about this travesty is inaccurate. The architecture and the sets are pretty accurate, but the costumes are from all over the 19th Century. The characterizations are wholly inaccurate -- Texas Rangers were never a bunch of giddy, snot-nosed kids playing childish games.

The fantastical, completely unsupportable nonsense about Sam Houston and a Black woman was revisionist, 21st Century CRAP. Oh, and another thing... nothing about the countryside even vaguely resembled what it looks like around San Antonio, Austin, or anywhere in East Texas. You can only find big desert canyons like that in a few parts of far West Texas (hundreds of miles away from San Antonio).

What a waste! This could have been wonderful, and instead, to anybody who knows anything about Texas history or Texas geography, it is disappointing, revisionist idiocy.",1437523200,77,856,5.333333333333333

Looking back, the state of Texas is better off separated from Mexico  no argument here. But if you were an African American living in Texas in the early 1830s, would you fight against Mexico  who abolished slavery as early as 1835, as opposed the Angelo-American settlers who imposed the hideous system of legal slavery for another 30 years?

Too much pointless dialog, confusing character development and interaction, playing loose with historical facts, and so on (as so many critics have observed).  That it was developed for the History Channel can only serve to impune the integrity of that channel.  Acting was so bad it was almost comical, even for actors Ive liked in other movies.

8720559,2,B00ZPH4RRA,"This is one of those shows that could have been absolutely amazing, but instead was completely undermined by terrible inaccuracies. As others have pointed out, the terrain is all wrong, the weather is wrong (important given how it actually effected real events), and there is a bunch of useless embellishment that serve no real purpose. The thing that bothers me the most though is how the battles are portrayed. The Alamo was a total loss for the Texans, but they killed 2-3 times there number in Mexicans, making it a costly victory for Santa Anna. Colonel Fannin wasn't as incompetent as he is made out to be, he did wait to move, but that was because he did not have enough wagons to move everything, and even after sending, and receiving more wagons he still had to destroy supplies left behind. When he was caught by the Mexicans his men weren't crushingly defeated as the show indicates, but actually set up a defense and inflicted again 2 to 3 times the casualties they took. They only surrendered the next day due to low morale and the fact that the Mexicans had placed artillery in elevated positions.

If all you want is a show with guns and sex, and pointless sub plots, this a show for you. If you are looking for something reasonably accurate to actual events, which quite frankly were more dramatic, this is not the show for you. It is that last part that confuses me. The actual history, and people involved were full of drama, and dramatic action. Why rewrite it to be less dramatic, just to underscore a plot thread that didn't actually occur?",1535068800,,1561,4.615107913669065
