4102089,5,B003AFPWI2,"I may want perfect glutes,abs and legs, but it will never happen. But doing this workout I come very close with Dr. Olson's instruction.  If you do this workout 3 times a week you will change your backside.  The instructions are percise and show the Dr. Olson researched all the exercises before attempting to direct the DVD.  This DVD is not the normal run of the mill DVD.  This is a world class workout.
Dr. Olson is a professor and writes numerous articles on exercise. Excellent...!!!",1274140800,24,489,4.651162790697675
4102090,5,B003AFPWI2,"I know Dr Olson personally. She is a fitness instructor besides being a PHD. She teaches 3x a week classes that replicate this, kettlebell, zip ball and her new Viper training. If you want to transform your body she will do it for you. The exercises are challenging but do what you can, build the base and begin torching calories and sculpting your body.  I have also been part of her research at Auburn University Montgomery. I'm 53 now, I've known her for 6 years and she continues to deliver excellent workouts and quality videos.  You will be sore, but you will recover.  If you're serious and want to sculpt your body and lose ""inches"" and look great you'll love this video. Highly, Highly Recommend. Lt Col, USAF (retired) and a PHD as well.",1415232000,5,747,4.559701492537314

4102092,5,B003AFPWI2,"I am an avid exerciser, I am a 40 year old female, I have been working out with Jillian michaels, brazil butt lift, the bowflex and even some cardio with Simmons. I have to say, I haven't been sore in months until this DVD. I was looking for some core strength training for my legs and backside for trouble spots and found it with this. This workout will focuse on your legs and butt, so if that is what you are looking for get this DVD. I am in great shape and this exercise is tough, and made even me sore. I love it! I am not a marketeer, like you get with some reviews, I am really a huge excercise nut, and I suggest Michele Olson. She gives you great instructions, shows you exactly how to do the exercise. The ab work is tough, I have a six pack, and it still got me sore, thank goodness it was short cause it's tough. I can already see a difference on back thighs and butt in 2 weeks. I do not think it is boring because it is focusing on the areas I want to work, and if you like to exercise then that is what you want in a workout, not a bunch of women jumping around looking pretty. I hope this review helps.",1398384000,12,1119,3.977777777777778
4102093,5,B003AFPWI2,"Straight forward instructions.  Not for the beginner!

4102094,1,B003AFPWI2,"I found this dvd very monotonous which is bad for 2 reasons: First - it's boring. I couldn't imagine wanting to perform this more than 3 times in a month. Second, heavy repetition of the same move is NOT good for your body. You do not need to do 100 lunges for results, nor is it healthy for your body. I have seen many other instructors do lunges with less repetition and with more effectiveness. Definitely would not recommend this in general, and it especially shouldn't be attempted by those with knee issues.",1389744000,4,513,4.526881720430108
4102095,5,B003AFPWI2,"Wow, this is a workout you will feel. I have done the whole thing several times, its hard. Sometimes I break it into two parts, still hard. I will do one leg segment and the following ab segment and feel it the next day. If you want real torture do the whole thing. Warning some parts of this dvd hurt! Michele is awesome, give us more!",1386806400,,336,4.106060606060606
4102096,2,B003AFPWI2,"Michelle Olson does a great job in the workout itself. However, first time I tried to play the DVD, it would not load. Second time I tried, it played flawlessly.

4102098,5,B003AFPWI2,"This is definitely not a beginner DVD! The first Mega Leg segment kicked my butt! 3 days later & I was still sore! Don't get me wrong - I LOVE this DVD! It works muscles in your legs & butt you never knew you had. The Mega series works on the larger leg muscles. I was surprised at how much cardio it provided with the Mega series. The Master Leg segment is great as well and really works deep leg, calf & thigh muscles. I was really looking for a quality DVD that would provide better definition for my legs & this is it! Dr. Olson helps to push you though it and works all the moves right along with you - with a smile on her face! I have not found any pain in my knees like some other workout DVDs. I am VERY pleased and am continuing to use this DVD in my weekly routine.
CONS: (but by no means deal breakers - buy the DVD!)The cool up & warm down are a bit short in my opinion, the AB segments are tough, and a bit short too. I do wish you could play each 25 minute Mega & Master series separately, instead of choosing each piece on the main menu. You can 'play all' & work both sets - which will provide about a 1 hour workout - but I am not ready for both yet!",1365206400,5,1167,3.8870292887029287

4102100,5,B003AFPWI2,Sound and picture quality are excellent.  This is a very challenging workout.  I have gone at my own pace and still been challenged.  I really like how she incorporates your arms into the workout while doing all the squats and lunges because it feels like a total workout...really gets your heart pumping too!,1361923200,2,309,4.7924528301886795
4102101,5,B003AFPWI2,"This is a hard workout, it really concentrated completely on your lower half, my legs were screaming at the end of if. I am in excellent shape and I really couldn't do some of the abdominal work, I would definately recommend it. I would say that it is probably not for beginners though.",1360886400,9,286,4.415094339622642
4102102,5,B003AFPWI2,This has got to be the most difficult workout I've ever done!  Two days later and I'm still sore!  Targeted exactly where I had hoped!  Looking forward to seeing the results!,1360108800,3,174,4.548387096774194
4102103,5,B003AFPWI2,"I have been exercising for a while now [running, yoga, kettlebells, Insanity, p90X, etc.] and wanted something to target my legs.  I had been doing Brazil Butt lift for about a year and not getting the results I had hoped for, so ordered this seeing that it was reviewed as an advanced workout.  That it certainly is!  I now combine this with Brazil Butt Lift, and am noticing the muscles and tone in my legs much more now after about a month than I had with other programs.

There are 2 separate 30 minute sessions [and I enjoy doing one right after the other for a good hour of leg training, 3-4 times per week].  The first workout, ""Mega Moves""  will really get your heart rate up and your legs burning.  You'll do a series of [many!] squats and lunges, with and without weights.  I work up quite a sweat by the end of this one - it's a great cardio workout.  The second workout, ""Master Moves"" is a little less on the cardio and has you work more on your stabilizing muscles by having you do more balance work.  The two combined provide a great and challenging workout for the entire body.

I have to say, most trainers out there have a group of people behind them doing the moves so that they can stop to talk while not doing the whole workout, so I was impressed that Michele Olson is by herself and is able to talk the entire time without really looking out of breath despite all the hard work!

In addition to the awesome leg workouts, the ab routines are up there with the tougher ones I have done.  Definitely not for the beginner, as even I have a hard time doing every move for the entire duration!

Overall, this is the most challenging leg and ab workout combination I have come across.",1359417600,12,1700,4.321766561514195
4102104,3,B003AFPWI2,"I have used many exercise videos, primarily J Michaels, but wanted to try something different to mix it up.  I like Michele on a personal level.  She is very encouraging and likeable.  The exercises however are a bit monotonous,  and just too many reps of the same thing.  This is not only boring, but almost impossible for a beginner, let alone someone who has been exercising for years, like me.  I mean, just when you think you should be done, she is like, okay ""8 more"".  and the ab exercises? they would be impossible for a beginner, no doubt.  The routines in general are very short, even though there are a lot of repetitions of the same thing.  you would think the brevity would allow the exerciser to push herself knowing it's almost over, but if you can't even do one of the abdominal exercises, it doesn't matter if there are one or ten.  I will continue to use this to break up my routines, but not a fav.",1358380800,5,917,4.372781065088757
4102105,5,B003AFPWI2,"Very good workout! If you are a beginner or even advanced, this is a serious workout! You will feel it deep within your muscles if done right!",1354320000,,142,4.296296296296297
4102106,4,B003AFPWI2,"Love it!!!

The dvd has 2 leg/glute workouts, and 2 ab workouts (called Mega and Master routines). Though I'm in reasonably good shape, I found all the workouts challenging - especially the leg routines.

The leg workouts are standing leg routines (no floor work), last about 20 minutes and involve creative squats, plies, leg lifts and lunges, often alternating fast with slow moves. The only equipment needed is a chair, and light & medium weights. The ab workouts last about 5 minutes and involve creative crunches and leg lifts (no planks). The set design is nice and bright and Dr. Olson's cuing is great.

The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that I found the Mega leg routine to be oh-so-boring, with endless squats & lunges set to repetitive music. I had to stop after about 12 minutes as I'd had enough (I still got an awesome workout however)

I haven't used the dvd enough yet to see results, but from the way I feel after each workout, I'm confident I will!",1351900800,8,969,4.551724137931035
4102107,5,B003AFPWI2,"This was bought for the girlfriend, she is very happy with it. Its a very intense workout & suggest anyone new to it take it slowly, as she was hobbling for a few days after trying to go thru the whole workout on the 1st day.",1351123200,3,225,3.9130434782608696
4102108,5,B003AFPWI2,"I was a potato couch till about 2 months ago. I have never trained my legs during my lifetime! After finding out that if I train my leg muscles I will be able to burn more calories (because in legs there is the biggest amount of muscles), I decided to try this. I love how Michele is always smiling and encouraging; it keeps me motivated and calm (as opposed to irritated by the load). This is a really hard workout. No beginner will be able to do everything. When I started I was able to do like 1/4 of it, maybe less! I felt like I will fall down and my legs won't lift me. The next day I had the biggest muscle pain in my life. It lasted for a week! I literally could hardly walk. I am glad I didn't have to go anywhere that week so I just stayed at home and waited till it passes! I felt like after an accident that crushed my legs. This is how hard this workout is for an untrained person.
After 2 months of doing these exercises (1-2 days a week, other days I am using elliptical bicycle or training my arms and abs) I can do a little bit more than half of Master Moves workout. Mega Moves is WAY too hard for me; it puts me off exercising. I will try that one after half year maybe. I am happy to say that I lost 2cm off my thighs already. I will work on this till I can go though all of it and till I conquer the Mega Moves. I really enjoy this. My only problem is that after I do all the leg workout, I can't do the ABS workout in the end of it because my legs are so tired that I can't lift them. If I do the ABS workout first then I am able to complete it.

Anyway, great product and an inspiring instructor!",1344297600,6,1619,3.891238670694864
4102109,5,B003AFPWI2,"Absolutely one of my favorite exercise DVDs for hitting trouble spots.  My legs are burning after both workouts!  The abs section is really effective, more than pilates. I have seen fast results in seat and thighs and huge differences in how clothes fit.  Straight forward exercises, which are well explained and challenging to do.  The time flies by. The moves alternate between slow and fast speeds that increase heart rate, yet don't feel frantic.  Must buy.",1340928000,12,461,5.0131578947368425
4102110,5,B003AFPWI2,"I love this DVD, but can't get thru the whole thing yet!!! Good for intermediate/advanced exercisers.  If done on a regular basis this will definantly get you perfect legs and glutes, just make sure you use good form, I wouldn't recommend for people with bad knees. All you need is a chair and a couple of hand weights, just be prepared to do a lot of squats and lunges!! :)",1339545600,2,374,4.3428571428571425
4102111,5,B003AFPWI2,"I recently had shoulder surgery and must not use my right shoulder for six weeks.  I started looking for lower body workout dvds to keep up my fitness level - I exercise 7 days a week and am an advanced level with a body fat of 13%, 5.5"" and 120 lbs.  I did the dvd this morning and liked it very much.  I did the exercises without the dumbbells or any arm movements due to my surgery, I still got a good workout, I was drenched in sweats!  This dvd is not for beginners as you will need to know the proper form and stance for the lunges and other exercises as she doesn't get into the details.  This is a fantastic dvd and she is not annoying.  Super fast shipping and fantastic communication as well.  I hope she will make more in the very near future.",1338854400,5,754,4.08843537414966
4102112,4,B003AFPWI2,"I was surprised that someone said that these exercises don't hurt your knees because mine were hurting almost immediately after I completed the legs & glutes section. I do believe that these are good effective exercises for legs & glutes(haven't done the abs sections yet) and she does do a ton of reps to the point where you may be begging for mercy depending on your fitness level. But I find it interesting that in her intro, she didn't discuss any of the reasons why she chose specific exercises since she is an exercise physiologist. In Tamilee Webb's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Science-of-Fitness-with-Tamilee-I-Want-Those-Buns-VHS/dp/B000055ZGS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Science of Fitness with Tamilee: I Want Those Buns! [VHS</a>] Tamilee goes into detail about how the exercises in her DVD have been proven to be the best ones to tone up that area, and that's why she chose them. I expected to hear something like that in this one but she didn't spout any scientific basis. Surprising since she's a PhD. Also, she doesn't discuss proper form when doing the lunges and squats which is crucial for not hurting yourself. She just says things like ""Go down only as far as is comfortable for you"", which I don't find all that helpful. If you already know proper form, this will not be too much of an issue but I think reminders are always appropriate and helpful. If you have bad knees and don't know proper form, you could end up doing a ton of reps that can hurt you. Often, she takes a fast pace with the reps and it's easy to lose form which is what may have happened to me and why my knees were hurting, or it could just be that squats & lunges in general, are hard on the knees (especialy if you already have issues with them, which I do) even with good form. I'm not sure why people thought this workout was so ""fun"". I don't get that part unless those were people who know her, putting in good reviews. Fun? Ok well, she is not annoying like some fitness instructors, the set is fine, and the exercises, I believe, will be effective if I can find a way to do them without hurting myself but I would not call it fun. But it is a good DVD overall and I would recommend it. Just with reservations for those with knee issues. I would've liked to know all the things I mentioned before purchasing. Hope this helps you.",1337558400,18,2383,4.730769230769231
4102113,5,B003AFPWI2,"I LOVE THIS WORKOUT!!! Michelle really gives you a great workout, one that takes you to the next level, and you have the option of not needing to do it all, but can skip to different sections. She's quite the cheerleader for you, always smiling and encouraging you. Not only do i enjoy the workout benefits of this disk but also the happiness that beams from while you work out!
Would definitely buy any other tapes she's done. HIghly recommend this !",1334620800,4,451,4.512195121951219
4102114,5,B003AFPWI2,"I've done a lot of workout DVDs and many of them tend to hurt my knees, especially if I do any kind of lunge or squat.  I bought this DVD due to the good reviews and I am so glad I did!! It works those legs - you can FEEL it the next day.  I love the pace and the instructor - she is very relatable and positive. She knows right when to say something to keep you motivated to keep going.  I do the Mega Moves twice a week and it WORKS.  Best of all - my knees don't ever hurt afterward! I don't know what it is but the way she has you set up the moves and the motion of the moves makes it so my knees don't pop or hurt afterward - and they ALWAYS have with other DVDs.
This is really worth the money.  I wish she would make more videos!",1334102400,4,736,3.6923076923076925

I'm 51 years old and decently fit. I hike, play squash, and workout with another fitness guru 7 days a week. This workout kicked my...um...glutes. :) I couldn't finish the whole thing, but will keep at it until I can, because I KNOW this midlife bulge around my belly is going to disappear faster than barbecue chips (when they are around me). The exercises are fun and definitely are challenging my muscles in a whole new way. I'm struggling with the floor exercises for abs because my neck always hurts. But, thankfully, Michele shows modified positions that feel equally effective to me. Great DVD to add to your collection!",1326844800,5,779,4.611510791366906
4102116,5,B003AFPWI2,"Wow, i am just so happy I found this DVD. I only have done it 3 times and I am addicted.
I decided to try this DVD, because I came to a plateau doing weight training exercises,  I weight train consistently this past year and dropped 2 sizes without losing any weight. I am strong but didn't feel strong enough. Enter Perfect Legs, Glutes & Abs; I realized that my stabilizing muscles were not being used with conventional weight training.  This DVD is the solution to getting out of my plateau, and I can feel my muscles working deeply, and already see and feel a difference. My legs hardened after doing this workout twice, by the third time, my butt jacked up. I can not wait to see how I will look after completing this without pausing the DVD. It is also quite aerobic, I had to peal off my sweat drench clothes!

I hope there will be a perfect arms, chest and back workout.",1313107200,9,878,4.3090909090909095

And she makes it look effortless (In a good way) and really encourages you---especially at parts when you just feel like you can't go on! My legs felt like 'water' last night-it was my first time!...and my legs/bottom still feel very ""worked"" the day after (that's today)! SURE BEATS A TREADMILL AT THE GYM--and no expensive membership!!! Sadly to say I could not do all the ab exercises, but after 5 kids, I know I'll have something to work at. (I think part of it was because I was so tired from all the leg exercises---guess that treadmill wasn't really helping with those muscles afterall) I can't wait to do this workout again and see how far I can go on round 2. I didn't have any weights, I used some waterbottles instead. The exercise itself is really enough, even without the weights! lots of fun, but I would suggest to get the 'everlast' exercise mat for the ab exercises. It was helpful for my back!! Get it while it's on sale  :-)  (I got the mat and the dvd within 4 days--ordered them here on amazon) Happy Exercising!",1294790400,6,1249,4.265822784810126
4102118,5,B003AFPWI2,I work out 7 days a week and have used exercise DVDs for many years (I own about 250 or so - I'm an addict :| - and I always look for the advanced ones) and this workout is incredibly challenging. It is just amazing. It actually works more than what it says. You get some upper body and cardio in too plus there are also some kettlebell moves. A great variety but with lots of reps to really fatigue the muscles (and they will be toast!) and for reasons I can't explain it was fun at the same time. I did it in the morning and by afternoon my buns were screaming. If you're looking for a challenge this is the one to get.,1282521600,23,621,3.976

Saddlebags and lots of inner thigh fat have always been issues for me and since I've used this for one month, 3 times a week, there are no more saddlebags. And, my inner thighs are down significantly and that area is firm, not like jello anymore. I'm very, very surprised by that because it's gotten semi-firm before but never reduced, not a bit. There is defined muscle on my outer thigh and also starting up the inner lower part - that's amazing.

This DVD is worth buying because Ms. Olson is really on to something, whether it's the exercises and/or the sequencing this is working. The abdominal exercises are tough and also get the job done.

I like that Michelle explains why we are moving the way we do during the workout, but I found myself really wanting to move into a different exercise rather than doing the same thing over and over. I am a pretty impatient person so maybe that's why, AND the workouts really did start to burn so maybe it was just me needing a break haha. I am 20 years old and in decent shape and 5 minutes into the first workout I found myself burning and my heart pumping.
