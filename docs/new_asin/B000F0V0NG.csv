2547673,4,B000F0V0NG,"What a nice tribute to an outstanding athlete: jockey Laffitt Pincay Jr. Being a horse racing fan for many years, Pincay was a familiar name to me, but I had little knowledge of the man.

Little did I realize what an incredible physical specimen and disciplined human being this guy was and what lengths he went to do stay that way for 39 years in his profession. How many other athletes, it is asked here in this film, are on the top of their game for 39 straight years?! Nobody but Pincay.

A bunch of famous jockeys, a few top trainers (D. Wayne Lukas and Bob Baffert heading the list), horse owners, celebrities, reporters and others all explain why Pincay was so good at what he did. Better yet, they showed us. There is a lot of racing footage in here, and it shows some losses and horrible spills as well as the big victories.

You'll meet Laffit's amazing family, too, and be moved at the end when the famous Panamanian is given a special day in his honor at Santa Anita racetrack. All in all, for a horse racing fan, this is great stuff!",1226620800,19,1046,4.3538461538461535
2547674,5,B000F0V0NG,This is a well deserved show of respect to an outstanding and interesting man. This sport has many great characters human and horse but Laffit is one of the greatest.

8116165,5,B000F0V0NG,"Laffit Pincay, Jr., should be ranked as one of the greatest sports heroes of all time. The care that he took of his body, the effort he put in to mastering the skills of a professional jockey and his focus, dedication and commitment to his profession is perhaps unparalleled by any other athlete in any sport. Forced to retire at the age of 56 due to a broken neck, Pincay was still a dominant force and commanded the respect of all jockeys.  I have followed horse racing for the past 35 years, and I feel privileged to have seen this world class jockey win races time and again while riding inferior horses. Pincay rose to the top of his profession at a time when the quality of jockeys on the local circuit were never better, and were fiercely competitive. He is deeply admired for the effort he put into every race he competed in, regardless of the value or the importance of the race. He deserved all the recognition and fame that came his way. Finally, I refer to him as a sports hero, and a fantastic role model for any young person, because he overcame all obstacles with commitment and desire and always played by the rules of the sport, never turning to illegal or inappropriate means to remain competitive. He was always a kind, gentle and gracious man, until he mounted a racehorse. That is what he loved to do, and he did it better than anyone else in history.  I encourage anyone interested in learning about commitment or dedication to watch this DVD.",1501372800,,1465,4.503759398496241
8116166,5,B000F0V0NG,"I thoroughly LOVE THIS DVD!!! I have watched it several times and never tire of seeing it!  I met Laffit in May, 2015 at the Jockeys & Jeans event near Indianapolis Indiana and found him to be everything I thought he would be!  What a gentleman!  Someone I will never forget...this DVD has so many horse people, past and present, that it should be in every Thoroughbred Horse owner and lover's library!",1451692800,,402,4.555555555555555

8116168,5,B000F0V0NG,"With my parents being die-hard handicappers, I pretty much grew up at Hollywood Park, Santa Anita, and Del Mar.  Since I could remember all I knew was Laffit Pincay Jr.  This video is simply AMAZING and taught many things I never knew about the Laffit.  To think how many times as a kid I would get his autograph after a race as he went back to the jockey's room, I am blown away to finally know his complete story.  This is a must have for any fan of horse racing and Laffit Pincay Jr.!",1447027200,,487,4.148936170212766
