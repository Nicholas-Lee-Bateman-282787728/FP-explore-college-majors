4469745,1,B004UOH3D4,"That was the worst POS I have ever watched in my life. I thought that Yor, The Hunter from the Future was the worst film ever made, but at least it had genuine action scenes, a linear plot, and something vaguely resembling a point. Tales of the Ancient Empire fails at even the most rudimentary things that people take for granted, things that exist even in bad films. If I had bought this, I would have returned it and demanded my money back on the grounds that Lionsgate is fradulantly deceiving the public into believing they were buying a movie. It's not, except in the sense that it contains some moving photographs and has people doing stuff. I believe that the filmakers simply ran out of money before completing the film and put together what footage they had. There's no other explanation. Entire passages, including both the prologue and climax, are done through narraration and ink drawings, with the actors stepping in to deliver dialogue. Everything is out of sequence, but not in a cool Taratino sort of way, but apparently done because it was the only way to splice the footage together. The CGI is laughable. They apparently didn't have the resources or money to do a proper render on their sequences, so they just used the test renders instead. I'm truly speechless. There's not a single sword fight in the entire film. And with the exception of a brief cameo by Lee Horsely (looking rather embarrased and pathetic, and still sporting that Matt Houston mustache), and a few passing references to Edan and Micah, this film has absolutely nothing to do with The Sword and the Sorceror. Shame on Lionsgate for even releasing this. Avoid this POS like the Black Death.",1328313600,19,1681,4.7406143344709895
4469746,1,B004UOH3D4,"Ive never written a review on amazon before. I loved the Sword and the Sorcerer. I'm a fan of Kevin Sorbo. I also usually am VERY forgiving of movies. I can let alot go and enjoy things. With all that in mind i was severely disappointed in this movie. I liked a couple of the FEW scenes actually in the movie. the rest was all explaining and bad graphics. i mean i went into this expecting to be bad or cheesy but not like this. Everything that Oda did should have been Talon. The damn necklaces the kids used to find each other were little talons. Lee should have been and played the father considering Pare only had a few more scenes anyway. I just got lost when the movie would stop and they would try to explain things then stop again.

So yeah its basically like an audio book with some moving pictures.",1328227200,11,808,4.246753246753247

4469748,1,B004UOH3D4,"This has to be one of the worst sword and sorcery movies I have ever seen. I am a big fan of ""The Sword and the Sorcerer"" so I was expecting something to be at least similar in production quality.

What you get is a disaster from beginning to end. The acting is horrid for most of the actors, half the scenes are shot in front of a green backdrop, the computer generated graphics (such as the ship) is worse than you would see in a video game.

The story was non-existent, and at a point the movie just ends. They pretty much tell you the ending instead of filming it...Or I think that is what happened. I couldn't really say, it was that bad of a sequence - which I think they showed you about 3 times..

If the opening titles don't scare you from watching the rest of the film, you must be dead.

I'm not a big Kevin Sorbo fan and when I found out he was in this movie, I almost didn't get it. But, like the other reviewer said, he wasn't bad in this film. Lee Horsely (I noticed they renamed his character from Talon to ""The Stranger"" should have declined to be in this film. Why try to connect ""Sword and Sorcerer"" with this garbage. It really had nothing to do with the first film.

Total, total garbage...Stay away and recommend to people you hate...",1327536000,20,1256,4.195020746887967
4469749,3,B004UOH3D4,"Normally,I get excited every time a new Kevin Sorbo movie comes out. Unfortunately,that is not the case with Tales of An Ancient Empire. Sorbo's performance,imo,is the movie's saving grace. His womanizing Aedan is somewhat comical at times and rather sarcastic. He & Melissa Ordway,who plays Princess Tanis,work very well together and keep the story flowing. For the most part,though, it's just a story of vampires,warriors and some sorcery. Speaking of which,the appearance of Lee Horsley,while intended to connect this film with The Sword and The Sorceror,is totally unnecessary,since his character has nothing to do with the overall plot. It is common knowledge that this movie ran into financial difficulties,which is why it took so long for it to finally come out. In any case,I think the producers could have put out a better product than this. If you are a die hard Sorbo fan,you may want to check this out,otherwise,don't bother.",1327449600,2,937,5.211920529801325

4469759,1,B004UOH3D4,"The Sword and the Sorcerer, in 1982, was one of my favorite films as a kid, and it still is years later. The end of the Film promised further adventures in the Ancient Empire, which never saw the light of day. I used to dream about the Ancient Empire, what was there, what adventure was to be had. Those were good little boy dreams.

Flash forward 30 years, we have Kevin Sorbo and the withered earthly remains of Michael Parre in ""Adventures in an Ancient Empire"". And, unfortunately, the dream turned to a genuine nightmare.

So, where does one begin?? Picking apart this film is like making fun of a crazy fool stumbling down the street with his pants down: you could say something witty and snide, but should you??

I suppose one could start with the extreme lack of production value. The sets are minimal, in some cases there is no set, just sucked-in facial shots of actors standing in front of nothing, not even a green screen. The CGI looks like it was accomplished on a Commodore 64 by a first-grader. The background music is ok, I guess, and ""ok"" is reaching for the stars in this turd. OK is something to tack up on the bulletin board.

The dialogue?  I'll just say that some things are ""unsayable"" and should be left that way. When the Vampire Sorceress gives herself a head rush from all the talking before she bites somebody on the neck is a telling sign.

Albert Pyun has always had a love of flashbacks in his checkered career, and he goes to the well early and often in this one. I counted three flashbacks to start the film, with each sort of nested within another. The ""action"" doesn't start until minute 45, and by then, you're either totally lost or completely drunk to have lasted that long.  It is nice to know, however, that Lee Horsley is still alive.

I just ... I just, I don't know. I wish I could ""Un-see"" this film or purge it from my brain, that way the Ancient Empire could remain a little boy's dream floating in the night.",1377907200,,1956,4.413888888888889
4469760,4,B004UOH3D4,I purchased this DVD as I am a fan of Lee Horsley and hunky Kevin Sorbo.  It was not the best sequel but plenty of action,1376006400,,121,3.6538461538461537
4469770,1,B004UOH3D4,"Double Wow, this was supposed to be a sequel to Sword and the Sorcerer.  Lets not Romanticize it, it was a B movie, but a good one with a clear plot line, unlike this.  It just makes this movie even more embarrassing.

Wow.  I actually like cheezy horror/fantasy/indie flics, but this does not even fall into the laughable category.  In order to be as cheap as possible, 99% of the action in this is explained by a narrator through bad ""Vampire"" voice modulation.  Once the group of ""heroes"" finally announces they are going after the evil Vampire Queen, it just jumps to a near still photo of Kevin Sorbo slaying her with an explanation that this is what happened. The rest of the movie is spent introducing us, one after the other, to four separate and indistinguishable female siblings of his which ends up being completely confusing.  The lack of decent lighting compounds the difficulty in figuring out whom is whom in every scene.  Even if the abundance of over-narration was more understandable, it would still make zero sense.  This was so bad, it was the first time in at least a decade I have bothered to review anything.  Thank god for netflix.  I don't know how this movie could claim even a $1 million dollar budget.

When I say Vampire voice modulation is used to explain the plot, I mean it, although it sounds more like an evil mushmouth from Fat Albert, and goes on for several minutes.  Epic Fail.",1364688000,,1415,4.589641434262949
4469771,4,B004UOH3D4,"A lot of viewers don't like this film for the cheapness of its stage sets and special effects, which makes the story presentation more akin to the video theater as opposed to a film watching experience. This is because this film is a labor of love 20 years in the making that was made on minimalist budget and the film relies on theatrical storytelling where a mainstream Hollywood production would rely on straight filmography. Keep in mind that Shakespearean theater has evolved into what we know today, precisely because Shakespeare's Globe Theatre was a bare stage with minimal set decoration and Shakespeare relied on his writing style and improvisation to make his production seem on par with the more elaborate and grander theatrical productons that were common in his day, especially in places like Paris.

This film apparently is not able to shake off its low-budgetness as well as Shakespeare, but it tells a very original story that challenges the manstream assumptions of the fantasy genre, it uses elements of the Japanese theater in its presentation; the art could hve been better and more vivid, and unlike the rest of the fantasy films since the 1980's, it is a true Epic, not the Tolkinesque high fantasy, but an Epic, where the fate of the Universe is at stake and the allegorical Adventurer is more like a sleeping God.

Sword and the Sorceror is the original film, of which Tales of Ancient Empire is a sequel.  Sword and Sorceror was an early, early fantasy film, almost the first to establish the genre that we know as Fantasy today. The earliest fantasy films are the Excalibur, the Dragon Slayer, and the 1981 Conan the Barbarian, with Arnold Schwartzenegger. Prior to these films, fantasy movie was really a historical drama, with medieval constumes, combat and story inspired typically by the Medieval England, Greek mythology, or the Bible. 1980's saw the advent of true fantasy films as a genre. Among these, the original Sword and the Sorceror holds the distinction of being the first and only film to successfully incorporate the Dungeons and Dragons fantasy sertting into it. It does very subtly and avoids being pigeon-holed into a ""Movie for D&D fans"". Other D&D films that followed did so with a lot less success.

Tales of Ancient Empire is nothing like its predecessor. For whatever reasons, it repeates the story elements of the first, to make a sequel, that has nothing to do with D&D and stands on its head the expectations and elements of the traditional fantasy genre and is a completely different movie.  You will enjoy this film more, if you like literature and theater, and you won't like this movie at all if you are looking for a fantasy action-adventure. Having said that, the Rascal in this film is more in keeping with how Rogues were portrayed in Medieval Literature and in Reanaissance and less that what was re-invented for D&D and modern fantasy genre. Theatrical innovation gives this film 4 stars. If it wasn't, I would have given it 3 stars for the very original and a very satirical story that it offers.",1364256000,3,3061,4.845124282982791
4469772,5,B004UOH3D4,"About 30 years ago I watched a awesome lower budget  movie called ""The Sword And The Sorcerer"" I am a huge Robert E. Howard fan & my friend & I both agreed that it was a better Conan movie than ""Conan the Barbarian"" was. As soon as the movie ended we noticed a teaser stateing "" watch for Talon's further adventures in Tales of an Ancient Empire"". Low & behold 30 years later I see this hauntingly familar title on net-flix so I que it & watch it & i'll be hung if theres not a brief cameo by actor Lee Horsley playing the ageing adventurer Talon from ""The Sword and the Sorcerer"" Unfortunately other than Xusia the evil wizard and a brief bar room scene showing Talon off to save now Emperor Mika that is the only conection to the now cult classic sword and sorcery movie from the early eighties. But the DVD 2012 ""Tales of an Ancient Empire"" is entertaining enough & cheap enough that I couldn't resist adding it to my collection being a huge fan of sword & scorcery/sandal movies. I love all sword & fantasy movies includeing historical. But if your a fan of fantasy adventure this movie delivers what it lacks for in budget it makes up for in its stylistic fast paced fun adventure Director Albert Pyun proves once again 30 years later you don't need a huge budget to deliver a good movie, good story line & decent acting will get it done every time. If enough people Buy this DVD Albert Pyun will probably use the proceeds to give us another cult classic hopefuly it won't take him 30 damn years this time! Ok it  certainly isn't going to steal any Oscars and there certainly could be more sword swinging but like I said for the price I got it for it was well worth it. So many people are bashing the hell out of this movie like something has been defiled!!! Its a low budget fantasy romp meant to be fun so Albert Pyun gives, a nod to a movie he made 30 years ago, I must have read 6 reviews that were scathing like he mentaly scarred people by not making poor old Lee Horsley the main character,& didn't follow up on ""The Sword and the Scorcerer"" its ok its just hollywood.

This is the WORST movie. Ever. Seriously. It may be good for some comic relief and I did laugh at the sheer ridiculousness. While I was watching, I kept thinking this was some sort of inside joke, and surely they were all in on it. I kept waiting for the wink-wink, nod-nod, elbow poke, and someone to jump out and say, ""Just kidding! Here's the real movie.""

I gave it one star because the rating system made me.

I had to come back and make an addition to my input after reading through the other reviews. Someone here actually gave this four stars. They advised people that they have to know what they are watching and stated that this movie has a good plot. 0. O

The photographic cinematography was as horrible as Beverly Hills Cop 3; however BHC3 had a score that they used throughout the movie.  The movie score at the beginning of the movie was reminiscent of Conan or other slayer movies, but it was hardly used in the movie.  The grade school stage backdrop sets were as laughable as the CGI.  The story would have been ok if it would have had Talon and his mighty mercenaries save the queendom; however Talon does not appear in this movie.  The Stranger, Lee Horsley, was a nice scene, if only he was used throughout the movie.  You just have to wonder if Lee Horsley, Kevin Sorbo, and Ralf Moeller lost a bet.

4469795,1,B004UOH3D4,"I don't think I've ever been as disappointed in a film as I was with this one. Like many of the reviewers here, I'm a huge fan of The Sword and the Sorcerer and was genuinely excited for the sequel, but aside from a few scattered references, this ""sequel in spirit"" has nothing in common with its predecessor, and in fact, does not even deserve to be associated with it.

I actually had the displeasure of viewing the overseas version of the film before the US version, so I already knew how awful it was, but I took a chance on this one just to see if there were any improvements made. The American version is just as bad, however, it's a different kind of bad than the original cut. While the overseas version deplorably gives away the ending of the film (in the first 5 minutes!) the US version opens with a series of comic book-style animations explaining the film's backstory. It actually turns out to be the best part of this movie, as it promptly goes downhill after that, with stiff acting, horrible CGI, and almost no action to speak about. The cameo of Talon, as portrayed by Lee Horsley, seems out of place in this film. He definitely deserved a much bigger role here, or else should have been cut out entirely. Another sticking point for me was the triple-bladed sword itself, which was one of the most memorable aspects of the first movie. The sword makes an appearance toward the film's climax, but unfortunately looks nothing like its original incarnation. Except for a brief scene in which it is partially obscured, we never really see the weapon up close, and the solid-looking projectile blades from the first film have now been replaced by crappy CGI. Based on all this, I'm inclined to believe that they couldn't even afford the actual prop sword, although given the budget constraints involved with this film, I can't say I'm all that surprised.

This is one of the worst (if not THE worst) movies I've ever seen, and I sincerely hope that Albert Pyun will not further tarnish the legacy of what is quite possibly his best film with any more worthless sequels.",1331078400,,2081,4.591397849462366

It also has 12 minutes of end credits which shouldn't even be there. After all, WHO would want anyone to know they worked on this POS?

Names; there are two associated with this lemon. Kevin Sorbo and Michael Par as Oda. Oda is a vampire killer. He decides to spare one (Xia played by Whitney Able) and they consummate their union (in cartoon form) and she becomes pregnant.

In cartoon form? Yes, the opening of the film - 10 minutes of opening credits involve still pictures - cartoons done in a Japanese style as Hekate (Cazzy Golomb) appears at talks directly to you (breaking the fourth wall), narrating the back-story.

Hekate appears again at the end to narrate the story, and more cartoon stills appear in place of any action. Hekate appears now with blacked out eyes (she's a vampire, apparently) only the eyes are blacked out digitally and really badly so as her head moves slightly you see the blackness not quite in place where the eyes are.

Digitally done sequences such as a ship in a storm are done so bad it looks like someone using a program based on Windows 95.

The vampires all appear with their fangs permanently extended (except Hekate, for some reason) and they can appear in the day time. To hide their fangs they wear a kind of hajib that covers the mouth.

Kara (Victoria Maurette) is beautiful but you don't see enough of her or anyone to give this a second star. The film's over-all plot is executed so badly but Albert Pyun (the director of Cyborg) might not be to blame. Perhaps the fact at least 10 people have a producing credit is the cause of this mess.

The closing credits is another 10 minutes.",1328572800,6,1687,4.584717607973422
4469799,1,B004UOH3D4,"I enjoy cheesy sword & scorcery movies. I enjoyed the original ""Sword and the Scorcerer"" move and I enjoy Kevin Sorbo's work. You would think that would make this movie a good movie right? WRONG!!!

A few nick-picks about this movie: The biggest one is this... Every single 'big scene' or 'battle' or 'fight' was just simply narrarated. The narrator herself has some obsucre connection to the movie that is just.. confusing. It is confusing because the whole ""Final Battle"" was just simply talked about by the narrator.

You'd expect the ""Oda"" charactor by Michael Pare to be ""Talon"". He is ""Talon"" in all but name and even have the three bladed sword. But Lee's charactor is just a cameo called, ""The stranger"" and that was confusing also.

Another thing. It is very obvious that all of Michael Pare's scenes were not even filmed with the other main characters.",1328486400,3,862,4.771812080536913

It actually may be come a cult classic as an example of something extraordinarily bad. And yet, I will keep it lol!",1517961600,,276,4.326923076923077
8441933,1,B004UOH3D4,Truly awful doesn't begin to say it all.  I loved Sword and the Sorcerer but this is just a big mess.  It is almost incoherent.  Kevin Sorbo must have really needed money to agree to make this disaster.  The story line makes no sense and most of the actors just stand there.  The female lead is more concerned with looking good than in good acting.  The movie starts out with a long backstory narrative that is so poorly done that it set the tone for the rest of the film.  Don't waste your money on this one.  My copy is going straight to Goodwill.,1501718400,,549,4.211538461538462
8441934,2,B004UOH3D4,"Very disappointing.  Did not like the way it was filmed.  Telling the story took away from the actors,  who were not allowed to do anything but stand around and say lines.  No real action.  Terrible director.",1475366400,,208,4.666666666666667

8441937,1,B004UOH3D4,"This is not a movie whatsoever. This is just a bunch of badly acted, badly choreographed, badly directed and even worse edited scenes put together. Albert Pyun has finally reached an all-time low with this production.

I have heard that he was hindered from properly editing some of his previous works in the past, but this time there are no excuses for such an incredibly poor result... Not even budget limitations, which are quite obvious throughout the entire film, account for this ugly mess.

The first 11 minutes are just too painful to see. As in David Lynch's Dune a girl begins to unfold the background story, only that this time through some kind of artsy drawings with the odd appereance of real actors in front of a green screen. That's Michael Par&eacute; trotting out his lines like a dummy with a two-dollar wig on his head, a female vampire with way too fake fangs and what it is supposed to be an evil sorcerer with the likes of an amicable librarian of some sort with no make-up on him at all (what a lazy bunch of people they are)... I almost gave up the moment Sasha Mitchell (Rodrigo) ludicrously steps onto the screen and joins Par&eacute; in a 'what's-up-bro' fashion while wielding a samurai sword with a big smile on his face. And that's just 3:29 min. into the movie...
Then the real action sequences begin though surprisingly enough the words 'Tales of an Ancient Empire' finally  make their way into the screen... at 15 min. 45 sec. !!

Fom that moment on it's all about awful and campy acting, wobbling sets, stock footage of the forbidden city in Tibet, more sequences in front of a green screen, horrible and lame CGI effects, atrocious editing of equally atrocious shots... an apalling story that seems to go back and forth and over again to the point there's no telling what is really going on: 20 years later, 2 months earlier, back to present, flashbacks here and there. Just lots of different sequences in different places interspersed with little sense..

Later we see Par&eacute; with yet another 2-dollar all too fake wig; snow-white this time... And the joke goes on 'till enough is enough and we are treated to listening to him belching and eben...farting!! Oh gosh...

One last thing. I can't either believe this movie takes 13 full minutes to roll on the end credits. Miserable way of adding some running time.

Poor guys...Kevin Sorbo, Matthew Willig, Ralf Moeller, Oliver Gruner... They all deserve better than this.

I truly enjoyed and own some other Pyun's movies like The Sword and the Sorcerer, Nemesis or Cyborg... So for the life of me I cannot understand what on Earth he had in mind this time.",1452902400,,2647,4.70194384449244

This fillm tries to carry that feeling of nostalgia and continue the story, kinda.  The story was almost unintelligible.  The costuming might be OK.  The acting is laughable, the very odd CGI background shots connected by some beautiful design sketches and way too much narration leads me to think they ran out of money and put out what they had,.  It's a film.  Show me don't tell me.  I really wasted my money on this.",1431043200,,540,4.393939393939394
