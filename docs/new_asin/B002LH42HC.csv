I caught up with him on Facebook where he has site and the books were publicised there.  It's good Amazon is stocking his work and long may it continue.  We need to know the truth about where we came from, all of us.  The truth will always come out.  I recommend this DVD and also the DVD by Hugh Montgomery made by Philip Gardiner about the Ulvungar Dynasty.",1399507200,,463,4.215909090909091

8473990,1,B002LH42HC,"I only watched about a half hour as I couldn't stomach any more. The format is and interviewer and and interviewee, talk show style. There were no worthy visuals to accompany the interview. The fellows accent is heavy English brogue which actually requires subtitles for us others to understand. Just two talking heads. I want my money back.",1348185600,,341,4.896551724137931
