I found myself fast forwarding thru every scene with his agent and guess what?....That was most of the documentary (If you can even call this a documentary). Well whatever this was, it was all over the place and not well thought out at all. I only gave it two stars because of the peppered in interviews with some of my favorite comedians. I wished he'd spent more time interviewing and documenting real comedy work and shows. I know when it comes to comedy, it's subjective what is funny. I think I'm pretty open when it comes to comedy but this was not that enlightening about the world of comedy or entertaining. Five minutes into this film I was thinking ""Ugh, what the hell did I just buy?!""",1437868800,,793,4.513888888888889
