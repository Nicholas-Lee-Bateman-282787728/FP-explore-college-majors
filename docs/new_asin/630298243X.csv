7833093,3,630298243X,"A ridiculously ambitious project, director Moretti here attempts a commentary on life in the New Left by way of a water polo film. Adding to the challenge, the film is also an amnesia comedy. I can't knock him for the effort, but ""Pamobella Rossa"" doesn't pull it all together near as well as I'd hoped it would.
Moretti certainly succeeds in mixing pride, anger, and melancholy in his portrait of a personal involvement with Italian Communism. Making it a personal portrait is a smart decision; it prevents the film from becoming overly didactic or just plain boring. Mixing it with water polo is also a smart move I think. But the amnesia angle is just too much. Plausability is thrown totally out the window and the plot quickly begins to irritate. This is not to say that the films is without value. Quite the contrary, there are a number of moments of fine, fine film-making. But on the whole, I can't commend the film beyond the three-, maybe three-and-a-half-, star mark.",1041897600,,978,4.7251461988304095
7833094,5,630298243X,"If you enjoyed Caro Diario, don't expect this movie to be  similar: Palombella Rossa is a tough movie, but it is one of the great masterpieces of italian cinema. At the end of the '80's the Italian communists face a big crisis. Nanni Moretti succeeds in giving a clear idea of the entity of such crisis, in a movie which mixes fun and profound reflections. The idea of mixing politics and waterpolo is fantastic. For the non-italians: Nanni Moretti is the best actor/director we have, and he really faced a crisis as a communist, and, yes, he really player waterpolo.",981590400,8,567,4.67
