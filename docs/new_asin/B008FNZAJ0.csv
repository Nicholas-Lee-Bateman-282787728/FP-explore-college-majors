5158678,5,B008FNZAJ0,I was lucky enough to see this movie in the UK during a cinema presentation in Sheffield. I was just blown away with this real life story. It really added a new perspective to my life.,1352419200,2,184,4.138888888888889
5158679,5,B008FNZAJ0,"We were at the premiere of the movie and it was done so well. Jasons story is as much about his music, loving family, and how they have dealt with adversity. You will laugh alot and shed a few tears as well. There is no end to this movie as Jason is alive and well kicking ALS's ass everyday...he is far from writing the final chapter. You will be inspired to live your life a little different after watching this. Appreciate life everyday, deal with adversity, and surround yourself with people who love you. Brilliant movie put together in almost a timeline..baby to adult. BUY IT AND SUPPORT JASON!",1348358400,18,601,4.522935779816514
5158680,5,B008FNZAJ0,"The movie is a father son story...a family story. A young man with so much talent and raw inspiration that his creative spirit could not be silenced by a disease that took away his ability to move his body. With his mind intact he produces music , records , writes music ,instructional videos, an inspiration to countless Guitarists world wide...this is the kind of film that pumps you up and shows you the impossible is possible. It is one of the greatest documentaries I ever seen..Period. It is a movie you can watch over and over it is that good.",1348272000,13,550,4.51

5158689,4,B008FNZAJ0,"I enjoyed this thoroughly.  Growing up during this same time (same age as JB), guitar player, DLR fan.  I found this sad/happy/fascinating/educational.  My wife (who has very little interest in shredding guitar players) found this to be a great movie also.  Jason Becker is such an inspiring man who was robbed of physical ability yet never gave up.  ALS is a scary disease that takes you so quickly.  He the epitome of perseverance.",1471824000,,433,4.863013698630137

8527342,5,B008FNZAJ0,"I first heard music with Becker, back when I was like 15.  Wow, that was 17 years ago.  I found his music on a program called IRC.  It was amazing to me.  I played guitar and just could not believe how he was playing.  I got as much of his stuff as I could.

Something happened to me in 2003.  Putting me in a coma for 6 weeks.  When I woke up, I had forgotten a lot of things from my life.  But you know, I still remembered Becker.

I found this video.  I had wanted to for a long time.  It was a really low price.  So, I got it.  I watched it last night.

It is done very well.

You get to hear about how he first started playing.  How he got to make his first albums.  The huge chance he had gotten chosen to be a part of and how sadly, he lost the ability to do what he did no amazingly.

You get to hear other musicians, friends and family members talk about him.

Also, you can watch a bunch of videos of him playing, in the special features part.  I watched one or two last night.  I have to watch the rest.  While I was watching the videos that I did, I was watching his arm.  I was looking at the muscle as he played.  Thinking how soon, he would loose them.  Sad.

This guy is such a strong person.  An inspiration to anyone who complains about the little problems in life.  Someone I remembered, even after losing most of my memory and who I look forward to remembering in this life and the next.

Thank you Jason Becker, for continuing to rock.",1501200000,3,1456,3.954861111111111
