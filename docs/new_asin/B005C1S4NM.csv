8499441,5,B005C1S4NM,"Abby Apple and her Fruit Friends make fruit fun, as well as teaching kids about the fruits, where they are from and what they are like. Abby also presents related concepts like colors, shapes, and counting. I have three kids and I find Abby has something to teach to each of them, from the words for the fruit and their shapes and colors to details about how they are grown. The show is very interactive, talking to kids with simple questions like you and I would. I particularly like the fact that these movies use still photos and images to help young kids' concentration and learning without overwhelming them or getting them addicted to fast-paced, flashy movie sequences.",1329696000,,676,4.737288135593221
8499442,5,B005C1S4NM,"In this episode of Snapatoonies, a very endearing apple introduces the children to a whole number of fruit, telling them where they come from, what colour and shape they are and what they taste like. I think it's a brilliant way of introducing fruit and a healthy way of eating to a young child.
I think this style of production is also a welcome change as the producers have used images with animation rather than film. This makes the children concentrate better on the story and process the snippets of information that are given to them. Also, the information provided is just right--not too little and not too much. It goes that extra mile by telling you where the apples are grown or how the pineapples are covered in diamond shapes.
This video definitely managed to grab the attention of my little one and I have noticed that the repetition and the rhymes have really re-enforced the concept in his mind.",1329609600,,910,4.658385093167702
8499443,5,B005C1S4NM,"In Snapatoonies: Abby Apple and her Fruit Friends, a very friendly host (Abby Apple) takes children through the world of nature to see the different types of fruit and where they come from.  At the toddler stage, children are making decisions about food and building their own eating habits.  This introduction to the world of healthy foods will be an encouragement to make the right choices.  Colors, shapes, and letters are addressed appropriately as well, making the teaching deep and relevant.  The engaging format and minimal animation is perfect for this age child.  He or she will enjoy interacting with Abby, her friends, and the train full of other kids.  The learning that comes from the video will complement the teaching that comes from parents at this crucial stage of development.  This is a great addition to every parent's toolbox as we guide our child through this important phase of life.",1329523200,,906,4.960264900662252
