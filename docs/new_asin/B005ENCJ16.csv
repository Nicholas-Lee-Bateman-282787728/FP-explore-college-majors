4666935,5,B005ENCJ16,"I saw ""Unhappy Birthday"" on On Demand a couple nights ago (after reading a great review on [..]) and was blown away by it.  Everything really comes together in this film, from the performances and writing, to the photography and music.  There's something about it that makes you uncomfortable from the beginning, and that feeling just grows and grows in your gut (or at least it did in mine).  It's hard not to compare it to The Wicker Man, but only because it deals with an odd religious community cut off from the mainland, and because of the deliciously slow build-up of dread.  Otherwise, it's a remarkably original film with a trio of main characters who we like and sympathize with, even as we're cringing at some of the choices they make.

If you like stuff that's more creepy than bloody, and love character-driven horror, then you will be in for quite a ride with this movie.  It's still resonating with me, days after the fact, and that is a rare thing these days.",1320105600,,974,4.568965517241379
4666936,5,B005ENCJ16,"Wow...

Love is tidal right? The whole premise of the story is very well portrayed and done very well. Some lovely shot's throughout and I think the gore within it was perfectly placed... if that can happen?

Basically, a REALLY good film and can not wait to see more from a clearly talented, up and coming director!

Massive props to the 'Unhappy Birthday' crew!!",1317859200,,364,4.65625
4666937,4,B005ENCJ16,"Fantastic British indie, this film is worth a watch. Eerie, full of suspense and a highly original plot.  I hope to see more movies from these film makers.",1317254400,5,155,4.535714285714286
4666938,5,B005ENCJ16,"One of the best films I've seen in ages. Very new, fresh and original with a great plot full of twists - a brilliant mix of horror, sex and humour! Can't wait for the next one...",1316304000,7,178,3.9722222222222223
4666939,5,B005ENCJ16,"Unhappy Birthday continues to haunt me months later, with its brooding pace and delicious slow menace. It's a tall order to compare any movie to the original Wicker Man but for once the comparisons here are fully justified. But there's also an unpredictable sexuality here that takes you somewhere completely new. For me a mark of a good movie is that it gives me nightmares. Unhappy Birthday gave me nightmares. Loved it. But I'm not about to book a trip to Amen anytime soon...",1315612800,,479,4.714285714285714
4666940,4,B005ENCJ16,"Paying homage to the likes of The Wicker Man and a whole heap of paranoia from the Seventies, Unhappy Birthday builds a creeping sense of dread that eventually builds to a palm sweating finale and a pay off that had the audience crying out not once but twice at the preview screening I attended.  Solid performances, striking cinematography and a truly unsettling score more than make up for the lack of budget. And although the story meanders in one or two places at the start of the film, it offers a solid balance of dark humour, decent scares and moments of the truly bizarre. All in all, Unhappy Birthday is a refreshing treat for thriller/horror fans of all denominations.",1315440000,3,678,4.697478991596639
4666941,5,B005ENCJ16,I caught this as part of a festival at our local cinema and decided to give it a chance - I loved it! The story is unusual and gripping with a real sting in its tail. It has fairly graphic scenes of sex and horror interspersed with very dark humour and even pathos though the overwhelming mood is one of a creepy psychological thriller. A twisted yarn set in a hauntingly beautiful landscape - highly recommended.,1315267200,2,413,4.447368421052632
4666942,5,B005ENCJ16,"This is an amazing film, so good I went to the cinema twice to see it.
It has everything: drama, suspense, comedy, brilliant cinematography, its a real thriller...with a good dash of sex.
Miss it at your peril",1315180800,7,209,4.526315789473684
8468765,5,B005ENCJ16,This film was brilliant. I loved it. saw it 3 times now must buy it. I wish there were more films out there that took a chance. Loved the editing with the tide/water. This film has an ambience thats just down right creepy.,1446940800,,222,4.186046511627907
8468766,3,B005ENCJ16,"I was very torn with the number of stars for this movie. I love my British films and maybe I expected too much but it is really and okay movie. Kind of predictable and kind of dull at the beginning. It really took a long time to get to the point. Pacing is one thing but let it flow. The idea of the tidal island was very cool. the performances were okay but I did like David Paisley, he seemed to give the best performance. I won't say too much because I don't want to give anything away but give it a shot. it is really okay.",1398124800,,527,3.9345794392523366
8468767,1,B005ENCJ16,"This movie was so light weight I cant remember what it was about.  I was disappointed.  I love gutsy, political, deep movies and thougfht from reading reviews this would not be bad.  A giggle of a different sort.  The only joke was the one on me thinking this would be good.  Thanks to the industry for making the movie but more omph would be good.
Thanks

8468768,2,B005ENCJ16,"Although this film had  some quirky characters doing some unpredictable and often mildly erotic things, i coiuld not really get  comfortable with a sense that anyone in the movie really were serious about making this story believeable.. When Sadie's husband  who I was remotely attracted to I must admit  got shoveled to death Scarecrow style I was truly disappointed ,and wanted a refund.. I love Horror that gives you a good scare ,but fims like this that leave you with a an unsettling sense of
disease,and gore for it's own sake, are not a path I enjoy traveling down,. even if there is a little gratuitous sex thrown in.

Unhappy Me Too",1362441600,,641,4.6875
8468769,2,B005ENCJ16,"I wish I had given into the feeling I had of not watching this about 30 mins into it. It's disturbing, and I feel worse for having reached the end of it. Twisted and dark, yes, so enjoy if that's what you're after. Big Hammer fan here, unsure of what it has in common at all with classic Hammer Horror. Sex perhaps.",1362268800,,315,4.096774193548387
8468770,1,B005ENCJ16,"Actually it's a ""0"" rating, but :1: is as low as I can select:  This is the worst kind of, I won't even call it movie making.  Crap making?  Unless you're into gaybashing killing and inbred religious freaks dispensing what they see as justice upon women having babies out of wedlock, do skip this crap-fest.",1339891200,,307,4.545454545454546
8468771,1,B005ENCJ16,"this is kind of a spoiler, but it kind of makes the whole movie a bit silly.
Why would you want to trick women to come onto your island when it's the men that are infertile?
Makes the entire premise of the movie a big ""Doh!""
It's an okay movie except the writer suffered from a complete breakdown in critical thinking.  The end is waaaay too choppy---maybe the director finally figured out the gaping hole in the plot and thought if he got real choppy with the scenes, he'd confuse the audience so much they wouldn't notice.",1338595200,,524,4.402061855670103
8468772,4,B005ENCJ16,"This is a beautiful love story, full of suspense, mystery, and horror.
It deals with the amazing turn of events when thee young people who
Have a special love form a bond with a fourth and fith person .. perhaps more.
While the ending is a nice wrap up - like happily ever after - it does not quite make since.
Perhaps that is why I find myself wanting to continue to follow the story, even after the end.
Perhaps in unhappy birthday II.",1336089600,,437,4.214285714285714
8468773,3,B005ENCJ16,"Yes this is a sexy, thriller, horror, gay themed road movie that ends on a spooky Scottish Island that is cut off by tidal flows. Sadie and Rich are partners she wants a baby, he keeps trying, but is firing blanks. He is also seeing Jonny on the side, his best friend who only cares so long as he keeps firing. They are all off for a party weekend on the above mentioned island.

Only big surprise is that Rick (Holby City's David Paisley - he will never live that down) has found Sadie's (Christine de Vallee - never been in Holby City but had an unscheduled stay in A and E once) long lost sister and family. Meanwhile the tide comes in and cuts them off before they have a chance to visit `Amen Island'. So they go to a Bed and Breakfast for some much needed sex.

The following day they make it to this island and any sane person would have skedaddled straight away - even without the scary music, which is a constant by the way, as all of the inhabitants are weird. Even the scarecrow has been crucified. They do have some more sex though so all is far from lost.

This is one of those modern horror types that feels it has to trowel on the frights and it keeps reminding you that bad things are gonna happen with the music, the constant shots of the incoming tide, shots of crows, cries of crows and the dysfunctional bunch of in breds on the island. There is also quite a lot of sign posting and some pretty flabby plot holes.

That said there are some pretty good performances especially from Mr Paisley - well he was on the BBC you know. And most of the production values are high. I think that writers and producers Mark Harriott and Mike Mathews just tried to shoe horn in too much and that took away from the film rather than adding to it. Still I think it kept me entertained and is far from being the worst film ever but not quite four stars but more than a solid three. If in doubt get it on a rental, you will not be wanting to see it again as it trades on the scares and `twists' and sex and the crow shots and scary bits - I think you get it.",1329868800,4,2060,4.116915422885572
8468774,4,B005ENCJ16,"This unassuming and brow-stitching flick set me up with seemingly uninteresting, moderately attractive young characters only to leave me creeped-out and using too many adverbs in this review. I wouldn't call this a psychological thriller but I will note that it disturbed me in an insidiously head-shrinking way (there goes another adverb). There are no real shock moments until the end but there are tons of behaviors that I didn't expect and couldn't decide how to interpret; therein lies the power of ""Unhappy Birthday"". That power fizzled when the ending turned out to be convoluted, ""jumping"" from nowhere with ****** ******** and ***********. I'm leaving these descriptions partially omitted (replaced with asterisks) because they might actually spoil the end for some viewers. Watch the film and enjoy the understated strangeness.",1321660800,5,837,5.446153846153846
