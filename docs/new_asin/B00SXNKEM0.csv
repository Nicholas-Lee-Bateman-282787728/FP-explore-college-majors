8749274,5,B00SXNKEM0,"Born Reckless with Mamie Van Doren is very entertaining. A great B film about a Rodeo trick rider romanced by a Rodeo competitor in horse, steer, and bull events. Mamie sings lots of songs, ballads and 1950's rockers. Fans of Mamie will like it the most. I have met Mamie and she is so nice to her fans. I appreciate her stand on women's and gay rights. A living legend and one of the last stars of the Golden Age of Hollywood.",1425859200,,427,4.219512195121951
