Long Dream is a movie about a guy who has dreams that last many months and sometimes years in length, his body weakens and changes as his mind thinks all that time really passed.  When the guy eventually decintrigrates little red crystals are found in his head, the doctor (having never dreamed and wanting to) thought the crystals were what was causing the guy to dream so he put them in himself and that's where it gets confusing...

I think what happened is the doctor is actually the patent having the dreams and what was always shown as the patient was actually the doctor...idk go rent it watch it and draw your own conclusions.

I give this movie a 3 out of 5 stars",1267315200,,785,4.393103448275862
8264624,3,B00171NYKY,"Marred by low budget and inferior production value, this film is more interesting than more JHorror products. Long dreams often seem like they only last a few seconds in waking life, and this movie shows what happens when one is caught up in dreams of increasing magnitude until one's humanity is lost. Beyond the poor SFX and pedestrian acting are some interesting ideas. Junji Ito's original manga story, though brief, is well worth seeking out as well.",1265241600,,455,4.922077922077922
8264625,1,B00171NYKY,"Story line, props, script and acting reminds me of a 50's sci-fi movie. There's suppose to be a message embedded in the story but unfortunately it drowned in the self-indulgence of this really poor quality film.",1238630400,2,211,4.888888888888889
