3422257,4,B00191AF04,"In ""Right By Me"", a 2005 release from Thailand, we meet three college students whose relationship is the focus of the story.  There's Tat, the rather nerdish and studious one, on the college swim team, and closeted from his unsuspecting parents.  On the other hand, his best friend Nat is flamboyant and out to the world (and the constant target of bullies because of it), with an unrequited crush on Tat.  Tat's attention is drawn by Ek, the hunky college basketball star who has a girlfriend, but who shows up at an off-campus gay student meeting and - when he sees the others from his class - quickly claims that he went to the meeting ""by mistake"".  Uh, huh.

After promising not to tell anyone about Ek's ""mistake"", Tat tutors him to pass his Statistics exam, while relishing the proximity this affords him to his crush.  Ek is still deeply in denial, but realizes his attraction to guys is real, and is likely the cause of ongoing problems with his girlfriend.  Meanwhile, Nat continues to drop not-so-subtle hints to Tat that he likes him as more than just a friend, but is frustrated when his friend doesn't seem to get the message.

These are, of course, familiar scenarios to many gay or bisexual men, but if the characters themselves seem somewhat familiar, that could be because the film is based on the novel ""Rainbow Boys"" by Alex Sanchez, which was exceedingly popular when published in Thailand.  The movie was called ""Rainbow Boys: The Movie"" in that country, and received kudos by Fridae. Com as ""... the first Thai film to treat gay men as full-fledged warm, complex, loving individuals - as opposed to the cartoon stereotypes typically depicted in Thai cinema.""

Nice dramatization of the book, slightly overacted, the photography choppy in spots, but recommended for way in which the story deals with these universal ""coming out"" concerns.  In Thai with English subtitles.  No extras on the DVD other than trailer and chapter stops. Give it four proud stars out of five.",1215388800,14,1991,4.7894736842105265
3422258,2,B00191AF04,Sometimes the characters just stand there waiting for another to deliver a line;  that's a little embarrassing to watch.  The fight scene wasn't realistic.  Sometimes the writing was very good and sometimes it was lacking.  It dealt realistically with its subject matter.  I liked most of the characters.  I would like to know how it was received in its home country.  Was it shocking or cutting edge?  Overall I enjoyed the movie because I enjoy this kind of story and am forgiving of imperfections.,1447113600,,500,4.869047619047619
3422259,5,B00191AF04,It's really cute and upbeat movie that sends a strong message. Kudos to the mom that unconditionally supports her son!,1445472000,,118,4.95
3422260,3,B00191AF04,"This is a cute movie.  First boy is in love with the second boy who is in love with the third boy.  It's almost a love triangle.  First boy is gay and his mother knows he's gay, in fact the whole world knows he's gay.  Second boy, no one knows he's gay except his best friend (the first boy) and himself.  Third boy doesn't know if he is gay as he also has a girlfriend, but wants to know if he might be gay, but no one even suspects that he could be gay.  The third boy, by the way, is a star basketball player at the school.  The mess starts with the first two boys going to a meeting for people to discuss the hardship of being gay.  The third boy out of curiousity decides to go to this meeting only to bump into the first two boys who attend the same school as him.  Now, out of necessity, the third boy befriends the second boy to ensure no one knows he attended the meeting and also, to get tutored by him when he found out the kid is quite smart.  In the process, you learn how each character's life is different from the other and what decisions they make along the way.",1445472000,,1079,4.0

3422266,4,B00191AF04,"""Right By Me"" is a little film in which you could almost turn off the subtitles & still know what the film is about. It follows three Thai boys who are quite different from one another--the smart but closeted-from-his-parents Tat; the effeminate but out & proud Nat; and the sexually confused athlete Ek--as their friendships entwine through issues of being different, society's prejudice towards gays, gay bashings, and romantic feelings. The latter issue troubles the friendships as an entanglement ensues: Ek & Tat are attracted to each other, but Nat is secretly infatuated with best friend Tat, and is jealous of Ek's presence.
Probably due to the strict laws in Thailand, the filmmakers never veer into graphic sex & nudity...and quite honestly, it doesn't need these elements. The film simply sticks to the issues in an understanding & affectionate way through the experiences & feelings of its three key characters. At the same time, because it doesn't include more graphic elements, RBM comes dangerously close to being an ""afternoon special"" in its occasional ""paint-by-numbers"" storyline.
Still, it's a worthwhile film to watch as these characters must weather their own personal storms & gradually get the happiness they deserve.",1244851200,6,1241,5.2727272727272725
3422267,4,B00191AF04,"When I first got Alex Sanchez's novel Rainbow Boys (which ""Right By Me"" is based on), I read that book so many times that I thought the cover would fall off. When I found a comercial for the ""Rainbow Boys"" movie in Thailand, I spent weeks - WEEKS - trying to find a copy, even though all of the sites said that it didn't have subtitles.

After about two months, I *finally* found out that the English title of the movie is ""Right By Me"". I ordered it, and delivery was amazingly quick (A+ for Amazon).

I. LOVED. IT.

The movie stars three different boys - Ek, Tat, and Nat - who go to the same college. Ek is the stereotypical jock: he's good looking; he's on the basketball team; he has a *girlfriend*. But he's starting to wonder if he might be bisexual because of certain 'feelings' he's been having towards guys. Tat is more of the bookish type: he's on the swim, but his best class is statistics and his only friend is Nat. Tat has had a crush on Ek since... forever! Nat is the screaming queen of the group: he talks with hand-motions, whines and wheedles to get his way, and is despirate for sex. He wants to take his relationship with Tat to the next level, but Tat has no interest.

Ek decides to go to a gay youth meeting, but he never expects that the meeting is Tat and Nat's weekly hang-out. He's not surprised to see Nat. He *is* surprised to see Tat, since Tat doesn't seem gay to Ek. Even though he flees the meeting half-way through, he and Tat start to become friends when Tat assures him that neither him nor Nat will tell anyone he was at the meeting. When Ek mentions having trouble with statistics, Tat offers to tutor him and the two become a lot closer.

Nat would be happy for Tat - really he would - but it would be so much better if Tat were in love with *him*. He gets jealous and throws hissy fits whenever Ek and Tat are getting along, and he constantly tries to talk Tat into kissing, making out, and even doing it. He never comes right out and tells Tat how he feels - and Tat is a bit spacey, so he doesn't notice - but it leads to a huge strain on their friendship because Nat doesn't always want to stop when Tat tells him to.

Do I think the movie might have been a bit better if Hollywood-ized? Hmm... probably. The accting fell a bit short at times - was Ek's abusive father even *trying* to hit him? - the musical score was... two? songs and there were patches of grainy filmogrophy. But ""Right By Me"" was still a fantastic movie, and I've watched it so many times I'm afraid I'm going to wear out the disk.

NOW FOR THE BAD NEWS!

~~ Those familiar with ""Rainbow Boys"" who want to see Nelson's story - his one night stand with Brick and his HIV scare - will be severely disappointed. Not a bit of it is mentioned. He becomes less of a third major character and more of a supporting character who molests Tat a lot. Even Jeremy is only seen once - during the credits - and is unidentified. For Jason/Kyle (Ek/Tat) fans like myself this is a plus, but Nelson (Nat) fans will be missing something.",1242000000,8,3035,4.220689655172414

8271546,4,B00191AF04,"This is a low-budget feature film from Thailand. I watched it out of curiosity. It starts slow and it never really picks up speed. I did not get the feeling that anyone in the film was a professional actor. It covers many of the same situations that have been covered in almost every other gay Asian film I have seen: The desired one is always closeted; there is always a screaming queen character. There are always issues with parents, especially fathers, who reject their gay sons. The closeted one always has a girlfriend or wife.

This film telegraphs or foreshadows almost every minute that is going to follow. Production quality is fair. Translated subtitles are good and clear.

All that said, despite the fact that I wanted to turn it off at least ten times, I stayed with it. What I learned is that this is actually a sweet, not great, romantic comedy in true Hollywood fashion. It doesn't successfully hit all the nails on the head, but it sure tries to. There are many funny lines, both intentional and unintentional. I howled at both, as well as some of the questionable acting choices. There is also one bizarre scene where the screaming queen character (Nat) opens the refrigerator at his home and is distressed to find there is no soda.

Ultimately it didn't matter, because the film correctly portrays real life situations for gay men who are closeted, who live in fear of their parents' or society's reactions, who desperately long for love, who are bullied, and who either fall in love with their best friend or fall in love with ""straight"" men. All of it is accurate and true. On that basis, I gave this four stars.

Overall, it is sweet and endearing, even though there will be times you want to slap Nat across the face and say ""Man up, girlfriend!"" The actor who plays Ek has definite sex appeal and it's easy to see why people would fall in love with him.

There is also a great pop song which is used as the theme song and occasionally surfaces in the film in other places.

If you can stick with its slowness, its obviousness, its blatant foreshadowing, then you will have a pleasant viewing experience, some good belly laughs, and you will also either revisit or become aware of what so many gay people (in this case just gay men) still must deal with on a daily basis... which is so sad and unnecessary.

I applaud this filmmaker for attempting to tell this story with a limited budget, but he did a wonderful job.",1453852800,,2441,4.559360730593608
8271547,3,B00191AF04,This is a cute video with a happy ending in a fantasy world.,1453507200,,60,3.6923076923076925
8271548,3,B00191AF04,"The movie presents three students in different levels of coming out. The first is a complete Sissy, accepted by his mother in his flamboyant way of living. The second, friends to the first, has a tranquil acceptance of his homosexuality, but still hasn't had the nerves of discussing the matter with his family. As for the third, a successful basket player, we have a complete closeted case.  The three meet, almost to the dismay of the closeted case, at an encounter of the rainbow group, where coming out strategies will be discussed by the members. The meeting will have healing effects for the three of them, specially the closeted one, for it will open ways of disclosure
The film has the merit of showing a situation set in Thailand, where we are shown that things aren't significantly different  from what is seeing in the west. Including, the novel in which its based is American. Its a good film, acted with little artistry by the leading actors.",1452470400,,955,4.746987951807229
