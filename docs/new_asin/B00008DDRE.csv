10)Photographic market

It touches upon the majority of the topics and issues of photography, and includes (a younger) Herb Ritz as a guest commentator among others. Some people may find its style, dvd menu design, or music a bit quirky or off(beat). I found the content quite interesting overall, given how rare it is to find serialized documentaries on photography. The only other one I recall is ""The Language of Photography"" that aired/airs on some PBS stations.",1155686400,23,840,5.17910447761194
1835015,1,B00008DDRE,"I  ordered this DVD for my University Library. I will not show this DVD to my students until I can turn off the sound & replace it with my own voice. A 1-star is because there is no option for 0 or negative stars in the rating scale. I have never written a review for Amazon.ca but I am inspired by the wasted opportunity to write this. I purchased this DVD in hopes that it might offer the opportunity to provide a compact teaching aid of an overview of photography history. Indeed it does provide a compact history of photograpy --- completely ignorant of the important thinking around photography & representation since 1980. My despair is that these ignorant, but canny, authors have managed to soporificly subvert the enlivening re-evaluation of photography as the most significant & controversial invention of the 19th Century & enduringly significant in the 21st C. These authors are canny enough to include images by those photographers conventionally considered important to photo history in the 1990s, but overlaid with a 1970s heroic modernist perspective in the voiceover.
I've only viewed the First Part (there are many more) and it is striking that this DVD is predominantly French speakers, not Qubecois, in translation. Yikes! Barthes wrote Camera Lucida sometime in the early 80s. The one Anglophone speaks of technology in a surprisingly complex way -- compared to the voice over & the other talking heads.
This is sad. So many good images of importance NOW, interpreted from uncomprehending authority.
Oh, funding powers that be, please give me the money to make 2 DVDs on the histories of photography & I will make something interesting and usuable & current.
If you buy this (that Brassai cover is seductive - hence, the canny) you will be disappointed.

1835016,1,B00008DDRE,"Upon initially ordering this DVD, I was excited at the prospect of having a useful pedagogical resource in a single volume with which to instruct my introductory photography students. But after viewing its installments, my subsequent disappointment has led me to consider writing the company for a refund.
The series' audio presentation and accompanying visual inserts between the actual photographs is camp 80's-and not in any contemporary neo-kitsch appropriative manner either, rather surprising for a recent release. Granted, The Adventure of Photography provides a thorough display of many diverse photographic images from its 19th century origins to more recent expressions, although much is left untheorized and simply accepted, devoid of a necessary, critical self-reflexivity. For example, the treatment of the nude only confirms-or performatively illustrates-what photographic theorists and feminist cultural critics have argued since the 70's: that photographic practitioners are often complicit in the objectification of women and the male-dominant gaze found within western culture at large. Lauding the likes of Helmut Newton and presenting non-critical discussion of various other objectifying sorts renders this segment substandard.
Although other topic areas provide useful information, one has to put up with the *same* music clips in each chapter--along with the Star Wars-like textual display, which gets tiresome and irritating. In summary, The Adventure of Photography engages in nothing more than mere description, and as a result, gets my grade of D for disappointing.",1085184000,28,1592,5.896103896103896
1835017,5,B00008DDRE,"This is a superb dvd to those that are interested in Photography in general. If you are a beginner or a pro, the material shown here will make you blown. This DVD covers every area of photophy, and contains almoust thousand of pictures of the greatest camera artist,",1052438400,25,266,4.5625

7981589,3,B00008DDRE,"Not, great, true. Much of the problem stems from the production for this English-language version, The narration is hurled at breakneck speed (kind of the opposite of Ken Burns films) by an extremely annoying narrator. The grating music - mostly just percussion - plain sucks. And, instead of subtitling the French interviews, they are simply translated, so you really don't even hear the original voice relegated to the background. Finally, many of these kinds of docs include an extensive gallery where one can linger on images from the show. This doesn't. Basically, another shoddy Kultur production, one of the oldest and still weakest of the art and music oriented video companies. Still, if you leave the sound off, and just pause on the images, there's a lot of great photography to take in. Three stars for that possibly, otherwise, likely just one.",1431475200,,857,5.042253521126761
7981590,1,B00008DDRE,"A misguided attempt to cover the history of photography...the production is amateurish, the commentary is uninformative, the talking heads are boring.  Major photographers are discussed without any substance or context and the artistic aspects of photography are mostly ignored.  I would go on and on, but I would really like to put this series behind me and not have it take up any more of my time.  One star for the archival interviews of some well known photographers, sadly a wasted part.",1374364800,,492,4.975609756097561
7981591,4,B00008DDRE,"I don't understand why some of the reviews were so negative. Did they expect that every aspect of photography(a huge subject) would be defined in detail in one program??? Impossible. There is a lot of information and history in this offering and it is very interesting to those of us who have many books and other dvds on photography. I recognized so many photographs that I have seen and read about in my books(I have about 150 books on the subject) and it is interesting to see it all and to learn more and more about the pictures and the photographers....It is more about history than anything else in particular....If people are truely interested in photography and history, they will enjoy this program and add it to their collection...If you expect one DVD to cover everything there is to know and see about photography, you are very foolish.",1369699200,,848,4.736486486486487
7981592,5,B00008DDRE,"One of the most comprehensive historical timeline of photography Ive ever seen. With many, many archival interviews from the masters. Truly an outstanding series.

Yes it has flaws, just as some of the finest street and documentary photography have flaws as well.  If you're a nitpicker you may not like the seriesbut I find it superb! It is one of my all time favorites.

If you Google my name, you can see my photography. Read my bio at my Tumblr. Make sure you Google the other reviewers names, to see their photography, read their bios. This may help you decide on where the reviewer is coming from.",1344729600,,603,4.616822429906542
7981593,2,B00008DDRE,"I got this video because I love documentaries about photography and was going to use it as teaching tool in a class I teach.  It is okay but is lacking a lot of info and is dated material when taking about modern photography (production was in 1998 and it's now 2012). But thats okay I expected that and wanted it for the history.  It also seems like they were trying to take  20 hours of documentary  and pack it into 4 1/2 hours.  The video does have some useful points, but yet again it moves way too fast.  Instead of looking and a few photographs and talking about them, it's like a 3 second per image slide show with thousands of images, really too much to take in, and the narrator talks a mile a minute.  Rush...rush...rush, moving on.. moving on.  The video production is low quality too and has some very annoying background music.  Kind of like a home video with a good attempt at being put together that needs a lot of work. Definitely not PBS or National Geographic quality.  Overall, I would skip it.  It's just too fast and doesn't give enough, if that makes sense.  Check out American Photography A century of images.  Much much better.",1336435200,,1152,4.428571428571429
7981594,5,B00008DDRE,"I have this set, and I own it too! I very much like it, and that I mentioned to students that are going into photography to watchg this DVD set, Yes it maybe a half hour for each chapter, but you can look at it over, and over again. I like the sountrack, and also that its a French production with the sponsors from French PHOTO, and Paris Match. Two well know publications. And its very well done, and educational. And that Photography did started in France...  Viva La France Viva La Kultur Video!",1245628800,2,499,4.308510638297872
7981595,4,B00008DDRE,"This two-DVD set is a 10-part TV series from the BBC, produced about a decade ago.  Each segment is approximately 25 minutes and covers a specific genre of professional photography -- war, photojournalism, fashion, et cetera -- with lots of examples and cameos by leading practitioners of each genre.  Although a tad dated (the segment on future developments has been completely outrun already) and made to a British sensibility, it is an interesting and informative series, worth a look.",1200614400,5,488,5.1645569620253164
7981596,3,B00008DDRE,"I would not say skip this DVD as would most of the other reviews.

It is very helpfull as a overview and exposes people to allot of diffrent photographers.

Yes it seems to have a dated perspective, and some weird bias on certian things.

But really can you expect much from a DVD that trys to cover so much.

Eventually something like this needs to be made as a full series of DVDS.

Untell then this is a suggested DVD purchase for a photographers or teachers DVD collection.

Just remember to tell whome ever is watching to not pay too much head to the commantary and

watch the devlopment of photography over the years.",1169942400,9,623,4.412280701754386
