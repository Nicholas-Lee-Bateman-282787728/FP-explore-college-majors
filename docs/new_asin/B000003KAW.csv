7902714,3,B000003KAW,"Neelix starts getting worried that he won't be able to help Voyager anymore now that they are approaching the Nekrit Expanse, an area of space  that he hasn't travelled beyond before. In an attempt to prove his worth  Neelix tries to find someone who he can buy a map of the Delta Quadrant  from - a costly item. So Neelix meets up with an old friend who promises to  get the map for him, they take a Shuttle and the two go to collect it. A  phaser-fight breaks out and someone is killed.
Suddenly Neelix realises  he was in the middle of a Narcotic's smuggling ploy and that his  Shuttlecraft has been carrying drugs, that there is no map and that there  is a dead body who was shot with a Starfleet phaser. All this evidence  could implicate him, and Voyager, in the illegal activity and the  murder.
This episode concentrates on Neelix who while trying to do a good  deed ends up making things a lot worse.",966902400,4,909,4.351190476190476
