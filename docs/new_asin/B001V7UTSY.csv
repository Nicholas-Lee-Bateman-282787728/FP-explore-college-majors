3819198,5,B001V7UTSY,"Because of the other review I held back on ordering this Blu-ray. Finally it came down in price so I could give it a try without worrying about a waste of money. But on my 46"" Samsung it is absolutely beautiful. Close-ups of the flowers are especially clear as a bell. There are many options for the music to play with it. While I prefer natural sounds, the classical music for me is a good second and I found that really relaxing but there are plenty of other options to try if classical is not your bag. I was glad to have another of these fine videos to add to my library.",1296259200,9,575,4.142857142857143

8345557,5,B001V7UTSY,I enjoy visiting botanical gardens and this was a complement to my lifestyle. I view this dvd and play my easy listening music as part of my daily routine. This reminds me of the garden of eden when humanity will be restored to the fellowship with GOD on the eighth day of the Feast of Tabernacles perhaps in our lifetime.,1518048000,,322,4.383333333333334

8345564,5,B001V7UTSY,It's quite beautiful and makes one look forward to summer as winter comes to an end.  A good way to relax at the end of a very stressful day.  Life always looks better when in a garden !,1385078400,,186,3.8684210526315788
8345565,5,B001V7UTSY,good selection of different flowers in both sunshine and shade. Appreciated the piano music the most but have also enjoyed the 6 different musical scores that go along with it so whatever mood your in can work. It auto plays by itself so you can easily leave it on for hours on end and not get tired of it.,1373587200,3,306,4.203389830508475
8345566,3,B001V7UTSY,"i bought this after buying HD moods Aqarium and Fire, which have stunning live images of fish and fire, making the TV look like a fireplace or aquarium.

living landscapes take a different approach. it has constantly changing scenes, which is more like a live slideshow than being immersed in the scene. so, this particular blu-ray title is pretty boring.

i got into these because the images look amazing, but, for me i wanted it to feel like you're really there, and this dvd moves around too much. HD moods is a better blu ray series in my opinion",1351468800,7,550,4.545454545454546
