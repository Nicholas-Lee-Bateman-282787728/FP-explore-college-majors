Balanchine is a teacher and a role model. He  tells us in language of Dance the minimum we need in order to react, and he activates our individual imagination, demanding full concentration from his audience. He respects Music, he respects Art, and he respects us. We just need to try to receive on as  high a level as possible what is offered to us. The dancers and  orchestra know that they are all united and involved in this important mission. Good Dance, like good music, has a clear structure and every movement has a meaning and a context. Balachine knows how to build pictures that stay in our mind .Every work of his has a beginning and an end. Works like Balanchine's  are very rare, and you can always watch them again and again. His technique is classical but his choreography is modern and intelligent.",986947200,11,1006,4.661016949152542

The choreography is so perfect and musical that after you've seen the ballet, every time you hear the music you see the dance steps images in your mind again! and the dancers are amazing,pure energy. The only regret is that there's not enough Balanchine's Ballet videos available, I've already bought them all.",985305600,11,443,4.620253164556962

For those of you not such Balanchine  disciples you may find out what this contemporary choreographer really has  that makes him one of the most influencial people of our century.
