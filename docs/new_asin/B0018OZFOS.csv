3418080,5,B0018OZFOS,"I've been waiting literally for years for this disc to come out!  I was very pleased with the outcome of all of Dr. Yang's efforts.  The disc is well produced, with almost too much information, if that's even possible!?  This is what has been missing from all other videos in the world teaching this very ancient form of Qi Gong...... proper instruction!  Dr. Yang imparts quite a lot of detailed information on  relaxation, mood, beathing, and even a large section taught by one of his students on the relationship of the 5 Animals to the 5 Elements in Chinese medical theory and which organs they affect.  The 5 sounds for the 5 organs are introduced as well.  It's absolutely a wonderful disc if for only the information alone!  The disc is well over two hours long, so the instruction is more than enough.

However, on the down side, this particular version of Hua Tuo's exercise is not for the absolute beginner.  It is one of the most physical versions of this Qi Gong.  Without some background in some form of martial art, or at least Tai Ji Quan, I think it might be difficult for a beginner to grasp the physical movements without a lot of effort.  This style is very martial in character.

The other major drawback with this version of the 5 Animal Play is that it does require a fair amount of space in order to perform it.  So plan on doing one repetition of each move each way in your small kitchen or living room.  Luckily this disc came out in the spring so that you can learn the whole form outside, then alter it for the winter months to make it more do-able indoors if you have a small living space like I do.

To sum things up, I couldn't recommend this disc enough! Dr. Yang's teaching style is very warm and personal. After just one viewing you will know so much about Qi Gong and Chinese medicine that you'll be the center of attention at your next party! Just be sure to dress as your favorite animal....the monkey maybe?",1210636800,53,1944,4.433802816901409
3418081,5,B0018OZFOS,I would recommend this DVD to anyone.  I have gotten many hours of use and education from this DVD.  Highly recommended.,1399939200,4,120,4.666666666666667
3418082,5,B0018OZFOS,"it met my expectations completely. Very good teaching of the 5 animals, though my master Xu Li practices the animals a little differently.",1392854400,3,138,5.043478260869565
3418083,5,B0018OZFOS,"After watching only parts of this dvd, I thought I should receive some college credits!!  At first, I hesitated to get it because of the price.  But now, I am VERY happy that I purchased it.  Dr, Yang is a master!!!!
Together with Wu Gin Ji produced by the Chinese GiGong Association, you will have a wealth of information available for review.
Glad I purchased it.",1392595200,6,365,4.5
3418084,5,B0018OZFOS,"This is a great reference video and re-enforces what my instructor teaches. If you're looking for confirmation in your Yang Style training, this is it!!",1387065600,2,152,5.12

3418086,5,B0018OZFOS,"It would be superfluous for me to wax lyrical about the sheer quality of both the content and the production of this DVD - all the existing reviews have covered this perfectly already. Once again Dr Yang has dazzled with his depth of knowledge and his personal charm infuses the end product to such a degree that the viewer cannot help but want to get involved! There is one serious downside to this particular set of qigong movements - the neighbours have been looking very worried when they see me cavorting in the garden as my favourite animal! Perhaps I should invite them to join in?

Don't just read about this, go and buy the DVD, you will not regret it.",1365206400,7,661,4.462809917355372
3418087,5,B0018OZFOS,"This is an exeunt video for getting a base knowledge on the five Animals. I like how they explain all the aspects at the beginning. Its hard to find good things that break it down and explain the different parts.

3418088,5,B0018OZFOS,"When it comes to Qi Gong, Dr. Yang Jwing Ming is never one to disappoint, and this DVD is no exception. Presented here, is a possible original Five Animal Sports Qi Gong, with reference notes taken from Hua Tuo's writings. ([...]) In the introduction, Dr. Yang discusses the history of Chinese Qi Gong, how the Five Animal Sports possibly came to be, and why there are numerous variations of the form.

One of the more interesting aspects of this Qi Gong program is the inclusion of the five healing sounds into the routine, along with a full explanation of what they are, what organs they effect, and how to best implement them during the movements. The animal movements themselves are explained in great detail and demonstrated first by Dr. Yang, then by his class. This allows for a better understanding of the movements, since you get to view the movement from different angles performed by different body types.

The TCM references and Five Element segments are explained clearly, and are accompanied by comprehensive diagrams (which are also included with the DVD, both as a physical copy, and as a digital chart that can be viewed separately on the DVD.) The DVD menu is laid out in a comprehensive manner, allowing the viewer to skip to each animal form, or to the complete form demonstration.

Overall, this is a great overview of the Five Animals, and can be easily picked up by someone with no prior experience with the form, however, some of the movements may be a bit strenuous. The material is clearly explained, and easily accessible. Another great product from YMMA.",1280534400,5,1582,4.8088235294117645
3418089,5,B0018OZFOS,"I honestly have few words to use to evaluate and review this DVD: it's absolutely awesome!!!!

A lot of other reviewers have done a wonderful job in describing quite well the content of the program, so i will not go into it; i will, however, share my experience with this program.

Not being fully knowledgeable in Qigon, i moved quite slowly from one form to another. Btw, as one of the reviewer pointed out, you do need some room to exercise.

Frustrated a bit at the beginning, i continued and i enjoyed the forms tremendously. They are challenging but...really FUN, and by that i mean ... I smiled a lot while practicing. The instructor himself seems to enjoying (he even invites you to make funny noises with your mouth while doing one of the forms).

It may be silly but i liked his approach to it. This dvd is the most enjoyable, enjoyable and fascinating one i have.

I would like to deepen my knowledge of the topic because  of this very well done program!",1272412800,5,965,4.485714285714286
3418090,5,B0018OZFOS,"This dvd is a very high quality tool for learning one of the great medical qi gong sets. As other reviewers have noted, the dvd includes both a lecture from Dr. Yang and his daughter on the principles of qi gong embodied in the set and on five element theory. The in-box chart is terrific and provides a great resource for reference during the lecture.

I would agree with other reviewers that the Skill Level designation of I/II is warranted. The sets are quite physical and require some study--especially the monkey sets. Rank beginners would be better served by starting with the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Eight-Simple-Qigong-Exercises-For-Health-The-Eight-8-Pieces-of-Brocade-YMAA-DVD/dp/B00016USR8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Eight Simple Qigong Exercises For Health - The Eight (8) Pieces of Brocade (YMAA) DVD</a>. For qi gong practitioners used to the Eight Pieces, though, or martial arts, the Five Animal Sports represent a significant step above the Eight Pieces,  and are an invaluable practice.

While the lectures are quite helpful on their own, getting the most out of this dvd will require commitment. If you are willing to give it that commitment, then this resource will serve you well.  I found that by breaking up the sets and practicing each animal two or three times independently, making copious use of rewind and slow forward, I could get a sense of the movements well enough to join in the continuous class set.  Based on that method, after a week of practice, I could follow along fairly well with the class set. Furthermore, it is a long set all told--50 minutes or so for just the forms, with another 20 minutes or so if the warm-ups are included. If you can commit to a daily practice, you'll reap the rewards--during push-hands the other day I found myself slipping into effective patterns from the bear set without even thinking about it...

To summarize, then, this is fantastic resource if you're looking to deepen an existing qi gong practice or to put a solid qi gong foundation under your martial arts practice!",1271808000,10,2095,5.276276276276277
3418091,5,B0018OZFOS,"Without needing to restate raving comments made by other reviewers, I would summarize this DVD in a few words:  Comprehensive, Complete, and Probably Not For Beginners.  However, that is not to say that this video does not have value to those who practice tai chi, yoga, or other similar ""soft"" exercise.  Without question, the viewer will realize the potential health benefits of Five-Animal practice by observing the spinal flexibility and fluidity of movement of Dr. Yang, who at the time of this writing, is in his mid-sixties.

This video contains four units:  history, theory, warm-ups, and finally, the exercises.  Dr. Yang introduces the history of Wu Qin Xi with discussions of historical figures who were key in the development of these exercises throughout history.  Afterwards, Dr. Kathy Yang discusses interpretation of Traditional Chinese Medicine theory and why these exercises fit into TCM health theory using a chart that is included with the DVD.  The warm-up movements are some of the same motions that are demonstrated in several of his other videos, such as Qigong Exercises for Back Pain Relief and The Essence of Shaolin White Crane:  White Crane Hard & Soft Qigong.  The bulk of the video is devoted to twenty-five exercises that together complete the Wu Qin Xi set.  Each exercise is covered in detail with description by Dr. Yang as he guides the viewer through the movements.  The breathing and sounds described by Chinese hero Yue Fei (March 24, 1103 - January 27, 1142) are included into the exercises.

This video produced by YMAA is truly a masterpiece.  I would highly recommend this video to any practitioner of Chinese martial arts or to those studying Traditional Chinese Medicine.  This DVD will be a great compliment to the practice of tai chi. The clear downside to the video lies within one of it's strengths: completeness.  Running 180 minutes, this video is not suited for those looking for a daily exercise video.  Those unfamiliar with qigong may find the depth of material intimidating.  For those people looking for an introduction to qigong or ""soft"" exercise, I would recommend one of  Dr. Yang's other DVDs, such as Simplified Tai chi Chuan with Applications (YMAA) .",1266451200,4,2215,5.035714285714286
3418092,5,B0018OZFOS,"I was given a copy of this DVD to review for which I am quite grateful. It is not something that I would have chosen for myself, but I have benefited greatly in expanding my understanding of the breadth of martial arts applications outside the traditional focus on fighting. The routines taught in this DVD are physically demanding, so if you are looking for something challenging, healthful and stimulating you should consider purchasing this DVD. However, I can highly recommend this even if you never plan to engage in the routines presented. The history and  information on principles of oriental healing are worth the purchase price.",1265846400,3,638,5.018867924528302
3418093,5,B0018OZFOS,"I've heard really great things about the five animal qigong and have been learning it in class.  But I wanted to learn different forms since I know there are several versions of the five animal qigong being taught.  This DVD is excellent!  Not only does it have very clear and detailed instructions, Master Yang goes into the history of the five animals.  This helps you understand the whole of the qigong practice.

He explains how each movement benefits a vital organ and the sounds that will help with the practice.  The video angling is very good so you can clearly see each movement.  I highly recommend this video!",1256428800,6,620,4.685185185185185
3418094,5,B0018OZFOS,"This is a wonderful, detailed dvd that covers a vast amount of information; history, five element theory, healing sounds, warm up exercises and a beautiful Five Animal routine. If you are an experienced qigong or taiji player, you will find lots of detailed information in this set.

A total novice will be able to understand the information and do these sets, however, I think it may require lots of patient review and practice. This is a dvd that you will never get tired of viewing, as there are many levels of information. Not for those wanting a quick fix, even though they are the students who may need it most!

Approach it calmly like the deer, with energy of the tiger, strength of the bear, soar softly with it like the bird, but remember to have fun like the moneky.",1254096000,5,777,4.542857142857143
3418095,5,B0018OZFOS,"The ""Five Animal Sports"" is based on the movements of five animals: the tiger, deer, bear, monkey and bird. Master Qigong instructor Dr. Yang, Jwing-Ming encourages an open minded, fun, and at times humorous approach to this ancient qigong exercise.

Starting with a stretching and warming up sequence, Dr. Yang personally explains and demonstrates each sequence with step by step instruction. Both front and helpful side views of each movement are presented to help learners. During the demonstrations, Dr. Yang indicates which internal organs are being stimulated and the associated healing sound (breath sound) for maximum health benefit. Each sequence is further demonstrated by a group of Dr. Yang's students, sequence by sequence, and as a complete form at the end of the DVD.

The intellectually inclined will not be disappointed with Dr. Yang's program. Included are sections on the history of the Five Animal Sports, an explanation of the Five Healing Sounds and a short lecture on the Five Elements theory by Kathy Yang. Included with the DVD is a helpful insert with a chart and diagram summarizing Five Elements theory.

I should mention here that the Five Animal Sports is fairly long (5 animals = 25 sequences), and does require space to perform. Anyone practicing in a small area will have to limit repetitions and improvise. Also - The Five Animal Sports DVD skill level is rated at level ""I"" and ""II"" and some of the postures may initially be difficult for beginners, although Dr. Yang does a very good job at demonstrating the movements for learners.

With that said - anyone seriously interested in learning and practicing an ancient qigong set to increase strength, improve heath and promote longevity will greatly benefit from, and enjoy ""Five Animal Sports Qigong"". Personally, I am very pleased with this program and I highly recommend it. Have fun!",1253836800,26,1872,5.087947882736156
3418096,5,B0018OZFOS,"I have been a martial artist for 43 years.  Over the years I have studied the 5 animal Qigong movements as presented by several other masters.  In my opinion, Dr. Yang's DVD presents the best of the best interpretation of the Five animals. He integrates, in detail, how the yin organs correspond to the movements to achieve physical and emotional health benefits.  His humble presentation style, masterful movements, and detailed explanations made me feel like I was in the presence of a true immortal master.  These animal forms can quickly be learned by practitioners of various Chinese styles. For someone not familiar at all with Martial Arts it would take much more time to learn the movements and they may want to start out with something else by Dr Yang such as the ""8 simple qigong excercises for health: The 8 pieces of brocade"".  But for the martial arts enthusiast I highly recommend this DVD.  I own 4 other DVD's by Dr. Yang and before I purchase any Martial Art DVD's I search his inventory first....",1253145600,8,1014,4.732954545454546
3418097,5,B0018OZFOS,"Dr. Yang has produced another excellent DVD which inspires you to workout and to learn the theory, history and practice of Qigong. An added attraction is a very good explanation of the Five Elements theory given by one of his students.

Throughout the sessions are explanations, demonstrations and theory of the animal movements which can benefit the body. The student is taught to imitate the movement of animals, to perform healing sounds for various parts of the body and to receive an excellent workout at the same time.

There is also an excellent warm-up and stretching session to be performed prior to the regular exercise routine. These movements alone are beneficial to the health of the individual and help make the body more comfortable before beginning the animal exercises.

Five Animal Qigong is more for the intermediate student, or at least for someone who has a basic understanding of Qigong, but a beginner should be able to obtain a very good workout and learn a lot about this art form. I know that I will be able to work along with the students shown on the DVD at least several times a week. The entire program can be done in one session but time should be set aside so that one could follow along and do the exercises correctly. Overall, I believe that this DVD will contribute to the good physical health and mental well-being of the serious student.",1252800000,4,1374,4.7405857740585775
3418098,5,B0018OZFOS,"I have been looking for years for a qigong to give me the workout that this one does. Aside from the excellent exercises themselves, this DVD also features the following:

1. Excellent instructional design -

a. History of the five animal sports.
b. Five element theory with Kathy Yang.
c. Each piece has a detailed introduction by Dr. Yang stating why the piece is done the way it is and what it works on.
d. Each piece is then practiced by Dr. Yang's class of 5 students.

2. Easy to follow along at your own pace -

Because this is a DVD, you can skip over the chapters you are not currently interested in. I have been following along every day. On the weekends, when I have more time, I review the detailed instruction. On the weekdays when I do not have as much time I just follow along with the class. Following the students from beginning to end (including the warm-ups) it takes approximately 1:15 to complete all 25 movements.

3. Excellent production. High quality video, charts and graphs included for five element theory and TCM.  The background is not too busy.  It is easy to see what Dr. Yang and the students are doing.

4. VERY detailed information - you really learn WHY you are doing the exercises. Dr. Yang invites you to modify them to suit your needs after you understand them fully. This is definitely NOT a DVD you should follow blindly. It teaches you and encourages you to think for yourself.

I agree with other reviewers.  This exercise routine is quite strenuous.  I would not recommend it for beginners.

I have quite a few of Dr. Yang's DVDs (probably about 10) - all of which are very good. However, this is the crown jewel of my collection.

I cannot recommend this DVD more highly.",1245628800,21,1715,4.511326860841424
3418099,5,B0018OZFOS,"This DVD covers the 5 Animal Sports Qigong set that displays the movements and spirit of the Tiger, Bear, Monkey, Deer and Bird.  Master Yang's daughter Kathy Yang helps to perform the set with her father.  These five routines are far from short and simple.  They are complex and long.  Each of them in their own right would be a wonderful Qigong routine.

One of the important aspects of doing Qigong, Taijiquan and many other internal martial arts is intent.  Without intent the moves become empty in meaning and lack focus, balance, rooting and power.  These Qigong routines display the characteristics and spirit of the five animals, which brings life to these routines.

The DVD starts with a lecture by Master Yang on the history of the Five Animal Sports Qigong set.  This is followed by discussions of the healing sounds, and their relationship to the Five Elements.

The five animals have their own sound in these routines and are linked to the five yin organs, the liver, kidney, spleen, heart and lungs.  Emotions and their link and effect on the organs is explained.

These sounds are not some imaginary creation.  Master Yang provides concrete examples of how we use these sounds in everyday life.  The panting a runner does after a long run is similar to the sound He, which is related to the heart and to the monkey.  The He sound is used to release the fire of the heart.

Master Yang has always had a wonderful ability to relate the movements and postures he is teaching to real life actions that people do on a daily basis.  This allows the student to immediately grasp the concepts by relating things they are already familiar with to the new routines and skills.

Unlike Taijiquan, which doesn't require much warm up before doing the form, the Five Animal Sports Qigong routines are quite heavy on stretching and a warm up prior to practicing the routines is highly recommended.  Master Yang discusses how first you stretch, then move around to loosen things up, and then one can move the stretch deeper into the body to the ligaments and tendons.

After teaching the five routines, they are then performed continuously by Kathy Yang and four other students of Master Yang.  The routines are long, complex and very complete.  I've been slowly learning the routines from the DVD and feel that this is a stand out from the pack Qigong form that has many benefits to the practitioner. As always, David Silver's quality production and directing presents this DVD information in a very effective and pleasing to watch format.  Highly recommended.",1214265600,35,2561,4.796803652968037
3418100,5,B0018OZFOS,"Over the last 1.5 years I have purchased a total of 14 of Dr Yang's videos. They are all excellent in every way. I could not begin to recount all that I have learned, but in a nutshell, so much about body awareness, centeredness, breathing, energy manifestation, channeling energy, mind-body-spirit connections, are you starting to get the idea?

These are DVDs that reward repeated viewing and practice over time. Dr. Yang's gift to mankind is treasure for those who seek it.",1213142400,8,476,4.8765432098765435

This DVD explains in wonderful detail why we should observe our fellow creatures more and why we should imitate the movements of animals to extend our human lives. Dr. Yang has such an amazing ability to teach us how to lead and guide the Qi to nourish ourselves using ancient knowledge, techniques and secrets. The Tiger, Deer, Bear, Ape and Bird movements and how it is explained that they compare to 5 organs is fascinating. If you know Wu Qin Xi you will find this DVD quite different. The movements presented in Dr. Yangs DVD Five Animal Sports Qigong will teach you a lot of new exercises that will help you to build strength and longevity.

Dr. Yang has always been thorough in his verbal instruction in all of his videos and this one is no exception. The animal forms are easy to follow and interesting to learn. Each animal form chapter is further broken down into subsets of movements so you can master a subset of movements via repetition before moving onto the next. I also find his students very good at demonstrating. Unlike most of Dr. Yang's videos, this one doesn't require too much space - just an ordinary living room - for the workouts to be done. I used this video for the first time when I woke up in a cold morning with some soreness on my back.

Than his a group perform the movement makes it very easy to learn. 5 Animal Sport requires more space than other Qigong. I feel a energy and well being from performing this exercise. It really improves the internal organs.

5 animal improves the internal organs by flexing, stretching, and relaxing them.

What you need to know: There are actually 25 movements combined with learning how to make distinct breathing sounds. So it takes longer to learn than I expected. It also requires more space.
