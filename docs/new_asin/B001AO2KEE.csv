8278381,5,B001AO2KEE,"Pourquoi Israel (Israel, Why) (1973) is Shoah filmmaker Claude Lanzmann's first film. The documentary examines life in Israel twenty-five years after becoming a state. Lanzmann spends time with, among others, German-Jewish migrs, intellectuals, prison inmates, dock workers, and the newly arrived. The title of the film is often incorrectly given as a question ""Israel, Why?"" however, Lanzmann intended it as an answer or an explanation from a collection of viewpoints. The film premiered in Israel just three days after the Yom Kippur War. Highly recommended.",1214265600,5,560,5.6
