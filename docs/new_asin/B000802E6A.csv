2255093,5,B000802E6A,"I thought this was a great film. It would have been nice to see the color version as the costumes were probably lovely, but the film doesn't lose anything in black and white. The actor playing the main character is unknown to me, but I think he's a great dancer. I kept thinking of Fred Astaire and wondering how two contemporaries could have such similar styles. If you want great drama, this isn't your movie, but if you want light hearted entertainment with some great dancing, give it a go. I wasn't expecting much and was pleasantly surprised.",1126051200,9,548,4.6020408163265305
2255094,5,B000802E6A,"I was amazed when I saw this film. I expected a slick, programmed, predictable musical. I am sure those who are used to the predictable musical genre will be a bit put off, but I loved the uniqeness of this film. Collins(the pirate) is a wonderful dancer and looks a good deal like Errol Flyn(but a bit thinner). The musical numbers are very inventive, and the dancers are superb in the chorus. The camerawork is much more modern than things that followed years later. Collins sings only one song, but he has a beautiful voice, and boy can he dance. What a nice change from the MGM look, which can be too overblown. I have always loved the smaller studios B&W musicals, which are always off-beat, such as Doll Face with Carmen Miranda, and Lady of Burlesque with Stanwyck. It's like the difference between General Motors and Studebaker or Packard. Who the hell wants a Buick when you could drive a Packard Phaeton?

2255095,5,B000802E6A,"Great dancing.  Great music - could use more - but who can argue with Rogers and Hart.  Cute plot - typical of light musicals of 30's and 40's.  Comedy of the Wizard of Oz - i.e. Frank Morgan - entertaining as is the dialog.

Missing is the Technicolor that the titles advertise.

2255098,5,B000802E6A,"While it won't be everyone's cup of tea, I found this movie to be fun and enjoyable.  It makes me think of some combination of Zorro and The Kissing Bandit  It's a light-hearted musical adventure story with a minimum of violence or angst.  The hero is a gentleman and a very talented dancer.  He is cunning and resourceful and doesn't hold bitterness for the bad things that happen to him.  He's a good example of just plain decent behavior.  The lady is beautiful, intelligent, and bold enough to try to save his life.  It's refreshing to see a woman not portrayed as a damsel in distress, yet staying very feminine and not a tomboy.  She too dances very well.  It was fun to see such good tap and flamenco styles, along with the waltz, represented together.  Surprisingly, both of the stars sing as well.  I expected to maybe see they'd been dubbed in the credits, but they actually did their own singing, dancing, and acting.  I'm amazed I haven't seen more of either of them.  They're very talented and performed their leading roles well.

The supporting characters filled their roles nicely.  I haven't seen much of any of them before, but they managed to bring comic relief without being annoying.  It was more goofy and occasionally witty humor, rather than just stupidity.  The main villain even wasn't too evil.  His sidekick felt more threatening and dastardly.  You may think that's bad acting on the villain's part, but it was keeping in character for him, and I found it pleasant to not be asked to hate him just because he is a rival for the lady's love.  He wasn't a great guy, but he gets a just ending.

The costumes looked great and the sets were decent.  They were maybe not elaborate, but I didn't find them to look cheap or flimsy either.  I was able to see the film in color, and I recommend you to view it that way also, if at all possible.  It adds to the film and shows off the costumes.

If you're looking for a romance, adventure, comedy, or all-around enjoyable and wholesome film, this movie is for you.",1384387200,5,2032,4.516483516483516
2255099,4,B000802E6A,"I'd never seen any of the featured actors.  The plot was pretty standard but this is a musical.  The singing and mainly dancing was excellent.  The bad guys were comic relief.  Image quality was poor to average.  If you like 30s stuff, this is worth a look.",1382400000,,257,4.382978723404255

The main characters are well acted but the some of the supporting characters not so much.  Some of is the fault of the dialogue and some of it is just lack of good acting.

Frank Morgan steals the show!!  Luis Alberni is also excellent.

2255104,3,B000802E6A,"The movie is ok, but it is falsely advertised; it is not in color.  Apparently the DVD distributor black-and-white-ized it.",1205539200,8,123,5.15
2255105,2,B000802E6A,"THE DANCING PIRATE billed itself as ""the first dancing musical in 100% new technicolor.""  Now, you may be wondering to yourself (even if you're not a fan of musicals) why on Earth you've never heard of this film before.  One would think that such a cinematic first would be less obscure.  Few people today have seen THE JAZZ SINGER, but many more would recognize the title as being the first talkie.

Well, I'll tell you why you've never heard of this technicolor marvel.  Because it's no damn good, that's why.

Now, granted the cheap DVD version of this film is actually a scratchy black and white print rather than the full color experience.  However, I doubt that seeing this film in technicolor would improve it significantly, even if the producers had managed to invent some new color and painted Harry Morgan's mustache with it.

And before I get to the plot summary, I need to point out an annoyance courtesy of the DVD cover concerning the actor in the previous paragraph.  At the end of the description on the box, the simple sentence follows: ""Frank Morgan (of MASH TV series fame) costars.""

Well, almost.  Frank Morgan (who is indeed in this film and best known as the cinematic Wizard of Oz) died of a heart attack in 1949.  The MASH television series began in 1972.  Clearly someone over at Digiview got Frank Morgan confused with Harry Morgan (who played Colonel Potter on MASH).  Harry Morgan, however, does not appear in this film.  I've tried cutting back on criticism of Digiview's grammar and factual errors, but this is far too egregious to ignore.

The plot is simple and silly (although, to be fair, musicals aren't really supposed to have very involved storylines).  The opening slide informs us of the setting: Boston, 1820.  At this locale is a flamboyant dancing instructor teaching his class about a new craze called ""the waltz"".  While horrifying the older generation because of the increased male-female physical contact, his students are pleased.  He closes his class, leaves the building and is immediately hit over the head and kidnapped by pirates.  Taken onboard the pirate vessel, he is now forced to perform menial tasks for the ship's cook.

Fortunately, these are singularly unobservant pirates, so he rapidly escapes them, and finds himself in a small Hispanic village somewhere in California.  He is immediately mistaken for a real pirate and sentenced to death.  However, his sentence is commuted on condition that he teach the villagers to dance.  This gives the dancing pirate (who isn't a pirate at all) the opportunity to dance a lot, give waltz lessons to the film's audience and fall in love with the movie's love-interest with whom he has absolutely no chemistry and who happens to be the daughter of the village's leader.

Rereading my description of the plot, I'm realizing that it's far goofier and hokier on paper than when I was actually watching it.  I suppose it says something that the film manages to convey a fairly strong suspension of disbelief.  On the other hand, you could point out that the script totally fails to capitalize on what could be a very entertaining premise.  The plot summary makes it sound like a bad film, but a bad film that could be fun.  Unfortunately, it isn't.

One of the first things that jumped out at me in the opening few scenes is how appallingly low-budget the film looks.  It looks like a small high school did a production of this and then the movie crew simply filmed on the same sets.  It's hard to take the film seriously when it looks like one mistimed twirl could take down half the village.

But the worst thing about the lack of money spent on the film is that these period musicals only really work if they look spectacular.  Like them or not, those MGM musicals of the 30s and 40s looked epic.  Picture in your mind those giant dance numbers with dozens of extras and enormous towering sets.  Even if you don't care for the overall experience (and I generally don't), one can still appreciate all the time and painstaking effort that must have occurred to produce something so overwhelming, intricate and energetic.

You simply do not get that effect here.  It doesn't look special.  It doesn't look extraordinary.  It just looks like a small number of guys jumping around a movie studio.  The costumes are bland; the sets are uninspired.  And moving beyond the mere budget, there just isn't anything imaginative about any of this.

The acting is acceptable.  Our hero is played by Charles Collins.  He spends 50% of his screen time with a cheesy Howard Dean grin plastered onto his face, which makes him a bit difficult to accept as a) a strong protagonist and b) as someone who could reasonably be mistaken for a pirate.

As mentioned, Frank Morgan appears in this film, and - bizarrely -- he appears to be playing the exact same character from THE WIZARD OF OZ, albeit without access to the impressive equipment that allowed that wizard to rule by fear.  He's the same bumbling man behind the curtain.  So much so that you almost expect him to leave the movie in a hot air balloon shouting, ""I can't come back; I don't know how it works!""

One thing about this character I could figure out was how Morgan became leader of this village given that it's clearly a Hispanic village, and Morgan obviously isn't.  I suppose we should be grateful that Morgan doesn't attempt a Mexican accent or use Charlton Heston's TOUCH OF EVIL makeup.

As for what's left, I personally got nothing out of the singing and dancing.  Usually with musicals, I can at least remember some of the more catchy tunes, even if I don't actually like them.  But none of them stayed in my mind more than an instant after ""The End"" appeared on the screen.  On the subject of the dancing, I tried to teach myself the waltz from the endless sequences where he teaches the steps, but I had about as much luck from this film as I did from the free salsa dancing tutorial DVDs I once got in the mail.

You might get some enjoyment out of the film by asking your friends to come over with a few adult beverages and giving this the full Mystery Science Theater 3000 treatment.  But even then, this is a film to be endured, not enjoyed.",1151539200,8,6202,4.669741697416974
2255106,2,B000802E6A,"So I bought this movie on dvd... it's one of my most prized posessions. Not because it's any good...but because it's so freaking bad. I mean, I cannot even watch it without being pissed. This dude is no pirate. He dances like a girl. I mean, some guys can make dancing look masculine, but this dude... he just looks like a pansy. See, I got it at walmart for $1. I would never pay full price. Also, the title is totally deceptive... this doesn't even have pirates in it... maybe in the begining, but they're big and fat, which are the dumbest kinds of pirates. In fact, I wouldn't even call them pirates... i'd call them ninjas-trying-to-be-cool. Oh, but it does have indians... and mexicans. I mean, if you're some sort of a softy pc looser... then you're gonna be all offended and think it's racist because all the mexicans act dumb. Sorry, there's not much I can say. It does have the Wizard of Oz in it, though. Which is weird. I mean, I can't figure out who the heck he's supposed to be... is he white? Is he mexican? His daughter is mexican... so was her mom mexican? Is she a half and half... a mutt? She looks like cathren zetta-jones too. So if you have a thing for cathren zetta-jones, add this to your library.... sicko. Anyway, I wouldn't buy this unless it was for a dollar... or less. Oh, but if you do like Aphex Twin... then buy it.",1145145600,4,1348,4.33201581027668
8054883,4,B000802E6A,"This was a early three strip TechniColor film, but the color prints have all been lost.  This B/W copy used for television is the only intact 35 mm copy that remains. Too bad because judging by the lighting and costuming the studio put quite a bit of money in this production and the color must have dazzled.

Rita Hayworth is uncredited because she performed as one of the dancers in the chorus in two numbers and only a true fan might be able to pick her out. Also dancing in the chorus are Pat Nixon (later First Lady of the US) and Marjorie Reynolds.

The plot is fanciful and there is definitely a pacifist leaning to the screen ""violence"".  No blood letting and only a few bops on the head.

The music by Alfred Newman tries to capture early California before the Mexican Revolution.  The songs by Rodgers and Hart are amazing.  Some of the lyrics are only in Spanish.

Apparently the film did not do well at the box office.

Frank Morgan does a interesting performance as the Alcalde.  Those who remember him as the Wizard of Oz (three years after the release of this film) will recognize his stock delivery of his lines here in that same character.

Steffi Duna (Serafina) and Victor Varconi (Balthazar) were both  European actors from Hungary.  Their Hungarian accents passed for ""foreign"" and so audiences of the 1930s may have accepted them as Spanish.

Not a movie that modern viewers will necessarily appreciate but it is sugary sweet and entertaining with an art deco musical score.",1525651200,,1496,4.638783269961977
