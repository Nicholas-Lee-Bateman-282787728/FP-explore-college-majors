8634696,1,B00HR736MI,I so wish our son didn't know our PIN. This is not a movie. It's just the same episodes that are available for free.,1456617600,,116,3.875
8634697,1,B00HR736MI,"The show is good, my son watches it all the time. Why this is getting a 1 star is because the description and packaging makes it sound like a new movie based of the series that came out in 2014. This is NOT the case. This is just a bunch of episodes from season 1 strung together with no credits. So if you don't have the series or Netflix buy this BUT if you have Netflix just go over there and watch it for free.",1416960000,4,414,3.8823529411764706

Love the toys, love the game, and love the Tv show, so i'm a 100% Pac-man ATGA fan and i not afraid to defends this form idiots who can't handle 2014.",1391385600,2,164,3.8529411764705883
8634702,2,B00HR736MI,"I was a very young kid in the 1980s, but I still remember PAC-MAN. It was one of the first video games that we owned and I believe it came included with the Sears Atari 2600 that we owned. MS. PAC-MAN was a bit more fun because it was more colorful and the mazes were a little more challenging. I also remember the 1980s PAC-MAN tv series. Therefore, I was really excited when I had the opportunity to see a promo copy of PAC-MAN AND THE GHOSTLY ADVENTURES: GHOST PATROL.

Sadly, like Rainbow Brite, Strawberry Shortcake, G.I. Joe, and even the Looney Tunes, Pac-Man has suffered from being ""updated"" for the modern era. The Pac-Man outside of the original video game was a husband and father and the guardian of his village. The Pac-Man of PAC-MAN AND THE GHOSTLY ADVENTURES is kind of a bratty teenager; he's an orphan and the last of his kind (the yellow Pacs), but that's no excuse for brattiness. Blinky, Pinky, Inky, Clyde, are still ghosts, but instead of trying to defeat and foil Pac-Man, they're actually friends of his from the ""Netherworld"". Also, in this series Pac-Man is pretty much unstoppable as he can become just about anything by eating berries from the Tree of Life.

Besides the changes in the characters, PAC-MAN AND THE GHOSTLY ADVENTURES also suffers in the animation department. It's not terrible animation. However, it's not all that great animation either. The animation in the episodes I watched reminded me of those inexpensive knock-offs of name brand movies (e.g. there's a movie called WINGS that has packaging extremely similar to Disney's PLANES). There's not much detail or shading involved and much of the scenes lack depth. Compared to the 1980s series (which was done by Hannah-Barbara), PAC-MAN AND THE GHOSTLY ADVENTURES is a big disappointment.

I can understand why some children might like PAC-MAN AND THE GHOSTLY ADVENTURES: it's got lots of pretty colors, most of the adults are clumsy or idiots, there's lots of silly physical humor, and there's very little storytelling or characterization involved. However, even the 1980s series was based upon a video game and was silly at times, there was some characterization, the storytelling was better, and the animation was of a much higher quality. Therefore, even if you have younger children, I'd recommend staying away from PAC-MAN AND THE GHOSTLY ADVENTURES and instead find a copy of the old PAC-MAN tv series instead; you'll enjoy it more and it's better entertainment for the kids, too.",1390780800,2,2485,4.911904761904762
