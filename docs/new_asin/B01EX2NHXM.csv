7741096,5,B01EX2NHXM,"A gritty and sometimes disturbing (especially if you are Italian) story about territory and control.  It doesn't matter if you are a man, woman or child, everyone is power hungry and everyone is also dispensable.
Very addictive, we had to binge watch some of the episodes.",1475798400,8,272,4.913043478260869

7741107,5,B01EX2NHXM,"SEE EDIT AT END: 5 stars for the series, but minus 3 for including only 9 out of 12 episodes. I'm really annoyed that I bought this from Amazon but it doesn't include the last 3 episodes of this season- there are 12 eps, not 9. This ends really abruptly. Wtf, Amazon? EDITED TO ADD: I am an idiot. We binged on the series (it is that good) and didn't realize that they weren't all issued at once- there are air dates for them. Popping three more stars on there.",1496707200,2,461,4.133333333333334
7741108,4,B01EX2NHXM,Amazon -can U at least get current with the releases? I already got to view the ending for season 2 and season 3 is being filmed now. Take care of your loyal customers who have an interest in this series.,1496534400,,204,4.125

7741110,5,B01EX2NHXM,great series.,1493251200,,13,6.0
7741111,5,B01EX2NHXM,"It seems, as of this date that Amazon doesn't have Season 2 available on Amazon Instant Video.  They do have it available on disc, however.

I binged on the second season and the TV series gets even better than season 1.  The middle of the second season each episode has not stop plot twist, red herrings, subversion among the ranks of the crime families as the mafia bosses battle for territorial control.  Unstable alliances are formed and the loyalty among younger members shift back and forth between bosses which cause violent conflict with the older members of these crimes families.  Jealousies set in among those that earn the most and those on the bottom of the revenue stream.  Some surprising main characters get whacked opening voids in the power structure within the organization and more conflicts to fill in those voids.

What I most loved about this second season was the continuous changing storyline.  Even within each episode, family dynamics change several times that it becomes a little challenging to keep track of it all.  Power struggles are at the heart of this TV series and how these families cannibalize themselves in their quest for power and control.  Not a problem for me because I love rich, complex plots.  But given the nature of this being a foreign TV series, it does challenge the audience to keep track of all of the different factions and temporary alliances that form and dissolve within each episode.  It's almost like a foreign mafia version of House of Cards.  Once I was three episodes into the new season, I could not stop binge watching.  The TV show became a suspense thriller with each episode ending in a cliffhanger.

And finally the finale of the show.  The series ends with one of best endings I've seen in any crime show.  I was satisfied with it but lamented this mob series ended on season 2.  This season definitely is one of my top ten TV series in any language.",1493164800,,1919,4.711711711711712
7741112,5,B01EX2NHXM,very satisfied,1492041600,,14,6.5
7741113,5,B01EX2NHXM,"This is one of the best TV series. It's in Italian Neapolitan dialect, but the subtitles don't bother at all. The action and the description of events are very easy to understand. Too bad that there are only two season to watch!",1491955200,,228,4.4523809523809526
7741114,5,B01EX2NHXM,Comes in PAL format which is in the description. You can convert it to play on US DVD players with a little IT experience. I got it to work great and my uncle loves it.,1491177600,,168,3.8285714285714287
7741115,3,B01EX2NHXM,Good DVD! But shipping took a very long time to get to me. It was a christmas present so I was pretty bummed.,1487376000,,109,3.782608695652174

8759713,5,B01EX2NHXM,This show is fantastic. We binge watched both seasons. I wish season 3 was available since they are already filming season 4.  Hurry up Amazon ,1529280000,,143,4.68
8759714,5,B01EX2NHXM,"Brilliant!  Maybe the best tv series--the best television period--focusing on the world of organized crime in italy. It invites comparison to the HBO series that was one of the shows that kicked off the contemporary renaissance if not revolution in television cinematography, direction, writing, production, etc.--""The Sopranos.""}  And strongly reminiscent of ""The Wire,"" possibly the best television ever, coming close to that same level of shot on location realism. (There is at least one set of scenes in Series One of ""Gomorrah"" that obviously 'quotes' ""The Wire,""  (See the episode in which the residents of a highrise throw whatever they can find onto the police below who are in the process of raiding the place. Fans of ""The Wire"" should easily find an almost identical set of scenes in its first season.) And easily as good as the film that preceded it all, ""Gomorrah,"" based on the superb book of that name by  Roberto Saviano. Saviano is also mentioned in the opening credits of the tv series as having furnished the inspiration for the show.",1516147200,,1053,5.0
