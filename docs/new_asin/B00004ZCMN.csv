I normally love anything afro-brazilian however, this was not a good buy. A better one is ""The Method's"" Afro-Brazilian workout. If you do go with this one, all I can say is good luck!",1013817600,,348,4.287878787878788
7928404,3,B00004ZCMN,"I have a hard time doing a workout video more than twice.
I don't really enjoy most forms of excercise, and dread doing most of the aerobics videos I have, but not this one. It's fun, it really is. It doesn't feel like a workout but more like a dance class. You will work up a sweat, but you won't feel exhausted. The music is pretty cool, alot of latin with some african drum beats too. Plus, some of the moves could look cool on the dance floor... like the samba and shimmy! However I only gave this video 3 stars because I thought it should have been longer, it says 42min. but the dance segments equal only 30min. On the other hand it is a plus when i'm having lazy or time crunched days. The only real complaint I have on the video is it is a little hard to follow. More instruction should have been given on the moves, and the camera did not get the feet work often enough. If you rewatch it enough though you can get it. Other than that the video really is a gem to me, it's fun and I enjoy it, and to me that's what counts. So if you're looking for something fun and not the average fonda workout give this one try.",1002758400,3,1123,4.063063063063063
7928405,5,B00004ZCMN,"It's hard to find exercise videos you can stick with. This particular video gives you a workout but it doesn't seem like plain, boring, regular exercise.  It feels like a mix between a cool, exotic dance class and dancing in the sultry, Brazilian carnival streets.  The moves get progressively more challenged but are so well broken down that with a little practice you'll get it.  It's about letting go and letting the music move you.  When your body is moving, especially to this music with these moves, your going to sweat.  It also has a very upifting, spiritual effect, almost like when you had a good yoga workout.  It's not harsh on the body, but you feel it later.  Her personality is very sweet, charming, happy and exciting.  This will definitely rub off on you. If you exercise at home with videos (it's good to have variety to keep you going and interested), try this one, I absolutely loved it, and I usually don't like a lot of the dance/exercise videos out there.  Some of these moves would look hot on the dance floor too.",997747200,3,1038,4.5675675675675675
7928406,5,B00004ZCMN,"Befor this video I thought I knew Afro-Brazilian dance, but I now know how sourly mistaken I was. Vanessa Isaac's dance/ workout film showed me the way. I recommend this video to everyone- both young and old, dancer or non-dancer. Whether you've spent your life in ethnic movement classes, or are just starting out; this video is the one for you. This film transports you from a workout in the studio to an alluring ocean side dance, and back again.  It's obvious that Isaac knows what she's doing. This is my favorite dance/ workout video. Vanessa Isaac is a genious!",980294400,3,568,4.68
7928407,5,B00004ZCMN,"I am not a person to usually write a review, but I was so inspired by this video that I had to.  Vanessa's energy is enough to keep any one moving.  She breaks down every movement in a simple way so that next thing you know, you are dancing.  I was sweating by the end of the video and had just learned great new moves.  I recommend this tape to everyone, no matter what your dance experience is.  Vanessa's video delivers exactly what she says, you can dance and workout at the same time.  I walked away feeling mentally and physically alive.  You will have a great workout without even knowing it.",980294400,2,599,4.294642857142857
7928408,2,B00004ZCMN,"Before I begin on the bad points I would to say this is an enjoyable
video with a latin flavour & good soundtrack but & it is a BIG
BUT. .... 95% of this video is USA Aerobics with a latin flavour with
5% of only the basic step of the Samba or Capoeira. Afro dances
whether Afro-Cuban or Afro-Brazilian are specialist dances which
involve different body movements than of the ordinary dances.  Any
Brazilian Sambistas, Male Passista or Mestre Sala dancers will find
this video a disappointment. This video is good for the USA market as
they do not know any better but do not think you will be able to join
the real true Brazilian trained dancers. For all the bad points of
this video it is still one of the best with a latin flavour just
beware it is very limited in what it shows you.",979689600,5,785,4.268456375838926
7928409,5,B00004ZCMN,"This workout will teach you the most popular Brazlian dances while helping you develop your smiling muscles. It's very easy to follow the steps, and lots of fun. This video shows you how to enjoy dancing the Brazilian way. I know, because I've been to Brazil three times for carnaval and believe me when I say that nobody knows how to have a good time like the Brazilians do. I can't wait to go back and practice what I have learned :-)",973728000,3,436,4.329268292682927
7928410,5,B00004ZCMN,"This workout is a lot of fun! I love the Brazilian music, the great beats, the moves, and especially discovering muscles I didn't know I had. No wonder Brazilians are so gorgeous!",973555200,,179,4.625
