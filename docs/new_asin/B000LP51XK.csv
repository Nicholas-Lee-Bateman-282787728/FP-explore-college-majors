8162964,4,B000LP51XK,Very basic circle walking and 8  palms. Done very well with English subtitles. Having looked at alot of these  videos on Bagua I liked this the best.,1445472000,,149,4.481481481481482
8162965,5,B000LP51XK,"It's so nice to be able to watch this for the price of Prime. I would have spent my 20s with this instructor easily, if I could have been so lucky. The translation is great. His explanations are like poetry (don't know if it's literal, or the translator (with the language.)) I've had my eyes on Bagua since my late 20s (I'm 45 now), but never dove deep into it. I did recently notice the two different styles of walking, and I sat down to watch this and bang! Explained it right off the bat. I will be looking for more of the low stance demonstrations now. It's the hardest, so it must be the best for the movement of ki. He explains everything so ""matter-of-factly"", then when the video's over, I'm thinking that this was a lot to absorb. I'm buying all his videos for sure. There are old Chinese videos on youtube showing competitors from the 60s and 70s and probably 80s. They're AMAZING!",1424390400,,892,4.379518072289157
8162966,4,B000LP51XK,"I have to agree that this instructor is very good. Instructions are clear and concise, his movements are fluid and natural, his energy is smooth and gentle, and he is obviously the real deal. (As I practiced the palm positions along with him, I could feel qi moving in my palms - this is always a sign for me that the instructor is good. When this can happen from a video it is a very good sign indeed.)

There is not too much history and theory (which you should also learn - it is just good to concentrate on one thing at a time), just good, basic instruction in the proper basic movements.

Insofar as it is possible to learn bagua from a video, this set is a very good place to start. If one has not had any personal instruction from a good instructor, it will be difficult to learn the more subtle aspects of the art and possible to get bad habits started.

However, for those who have had good instruction in taiji or similar arts, this video and the companion will be very useful.

Recommended.",1415836800,,1001,4.308510638297872
8162967,5,B000LP51XK,Good video. Quality is good. Watched this for free when i had amazon prime and immediately decided that i needed to order the dvd as a good resource for my Bagua training.,1402876800,2,171,4.375
8162968,5,B000LP51XK,This video is in Chinese.  The Subtitles are quite good and the demonstrations are well done.  This is a very good basic instruction for someone wanting to learning the basics who also had some previous martial arts instruction.,1389139200,,228,4.973684210526316
8162969,2,B000LP51XK,"First, let me state I am not practice bagua, so a bagua enthusiast may have a completely different perspective on this video.

I had purchased the video as a visual companion to Tom Bisio's book, ""Bagua Circle Walking Nei Gong"".  While the performer is a incredible athlete, I question his internal arts understanding.  The major cause for my concern was the way the performer would extend his weight-bearing knee what seemed to be four inches (or more) beyond his toes.  This shows he has extremely strong legs, but following his example could destroy the knees of an old man like me.

I also had difficulty with the subtitles.

If you want a companion video to work through ""Bagua Circle Walking Nei Gong"", spend a few more dollars and get ""Bagua Concepts Volume 1: Ding Shi"".",1371945600,,778,4.725925925925926
8162970,5,B000LP51XK,"This is a great instruction video on introduction level Bagua. How often do you have a master in Bagua teach you the basics in detail? Sifu Liu Jingru demonstrates how to perform the movements correctly and mistakes to avoid.

Stepping Practice
Sifu Liu demonstrates Linear, Circular and S walking techniques. If we analyze this from a defensive perspective, we find that standing still makes it very easy for an opponent to target us. So if we want to make attacking us more difficult then we start to move. First, straight line movement is fairly easy and the opponent must now at least plot an intercept course. Second, circular movement requires a little more capability to perform and a lot more effort from the opponent to track on you. Third, S movement again requires more capability to perform yet the unpredictability creates great difficulty for the opponent trying to intercept you.

Basic Circle Walking Form.
Most martial arts start by developing ones health and fitness, then move to developing self defense skills, then advancing to protecting others skills. This form is to develop level one health and fitness. The form consists of holding the arms in a posture (Tiger, bear, dragon and others) while walking in a circle. This develops the basic strengthening of the arms and legs. The form is demonstrated 2 ways. First the complete form. Then each posture one at a time with the full detailed instruction of how to move into and hold the posture, changing direction and changing from one posture to the next.

Audio is in Chinese with a choice of English or Chinese subtitles.",1294185600,9,1596,4.9037037037037035
