8474325,4,6300206289,"I actually had an original VHS -NFL All The Best that broke. I thought the video was so good, that I felt it was worth buying a replacement. All The Best features Walter Payton, Eric Dickerson and Dan Marino, 3 of my all-time favorite players; along with others. The opening start of the video has a nice football atmosphere and classic NFL films music. Throughout the video inspirational, orchestrated-classic NFL films music from the 1970s-1980s is played, which is excellent, unlike some other football videos of today. The comparison piece between Payton and Jim Brown was nice. The seperate piece on Payton was excellent. Overall I think it is a very good video. I believe anyone who loves the game of football, who also are really into the history of pro-football and who enjoy the different aspects of the game would really enjoy this video. I would recommend the All The Best video for the new and younger generations of coaches, players and fans at all levels as a learning tool, to teach about the great historic players who made the game fun and exciting, and to teach about how to have good work ethic, determination, focus and how to be great at what you do. I also would hope to see NFL films make more historic videos like this featuring great players of the past, with the classic 1970s-1980s orchestrated music themes which is important to note.",1378166400,,1362,4.726890756302521
