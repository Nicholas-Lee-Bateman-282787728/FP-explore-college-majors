5361439,5,B009RWRINE,"The Criterion Collection has done it again! For several years now, they've been filling in the blank spaces in the collections of film lovers, and now it's a newly remastered version of Alfred Hitchcock's 1934 thriller, THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH. As one of Hitchcock's biggest fans, I'm here to tell you that there has never been a really good print of this early masterpiece available on DVD before, to say nothing of Blu-Ray. Now, thanks to Criterion, we have both!

This was Hitchcock's first version of the venerable spy story; he filmed it again in 1955 with James Stewart and Doris Day (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Man-Who-Knew-Too-Much/dp/B000CCW2TS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Man Who Knew Too Much</a>). Fans argue about which is the better version, and the director himself preferred the later one, but I love them both equally. There's something truly charming about the earlier film, and it includes one great performance that doesn't have a correlative in the 1955 version.

The story is simple and straightforward: A British couple (lLeslie Banks and Edna Best) are on vacation in Switzerland with their young daughter (Nova Pilbeam) when the father accidentally learns a deadly secret from a dying man. A political VIP is about to be assassinated in London by a nasty ring of terrorists led by a vicious psychopath (Peter Lorre, giving the great performance I mentioned above). In order to keep the parents quiet about the plot, the villains kidnap the daughter, which leads to...well, see for yourself.

This was Peter Lorre's first performance in English, and he is truly memorable. Banks and Best are excellent, too, and the swift pace of the movie never lags. It's one of the Master's most enjoyable early works, paving the way for later gems like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-39-Steps/dp/B007N5YJYS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The 39 Steps</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/North-By-Northwest/dp/B0045HCJ9E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">North By Northwest</a>, and now Criterion has given us a reason to appreciate it even more.

5361440,5,B009RWRINE,"This blu-ray is brilliant, I didn't expect there to be so many special features for a movie made long before Blu-Rays and even DVDs existed, but there was. I haven't seen all the special features but I did see some of them.

Simply brilliant. As a fan of the movie, I'm very happy to know the thought progress behind the movie. Even Alfred Hitchcock himself has an interview on this Blu-Ray, thank goodness television existed back in the day.",1447977600,,442,4.594936708860759

5361442,2,B009RWRINE,"Which was far superior to this amateur effort. This film isn't bad, but it isn't the best version. The British do so much fast-talking rambling, subtitles are often needed. I did not like the corny criminals, either; they acted more like cartoon characters. I much prefer the Jimmy Stewart/Doris Day version; there is more suspense and tension in the remake. If you want to see 1930s Hitchcock, there are better films to choose from: ""The 39 Steps"", ""Sabotage"", ""Young and Innocent"" and ""The Lady Vanishes"" come to mind.",1437264000,,520,4.920454545454546

5361451,5,B009RWRINE,"This movie was Peter Lorre's first English language film.  His Character was very evil, but in a subtle way.  If you have seen the Remake with Jimmy Stewart, you also need to own the Original.  If you don't like going to the Dentist, this film show you why we don't like going to the Dentist's office. Edna Best is the mother and plays a somewhat well know sharp shooter. Pay attention to the trap shooting contest at the beginning of the film, it sets up the film. Leslie Banks is no Jimmy Stewart, but he does a good job as the father who does his best to save his daughter.

I was surprised to find that there IS a discernible difference. Peter Lorre is superb in this kidnapped by spies thriller and there's more than enough dry humor to hold your attention. This issue of a true Hitchcock classic has been beautifully restored and is one that I highly recommend.",1397433600,2,478,4.443181818181818

5361455,4,B009RWRINE,"Years ago, I watched the Jimmy Stewart film of the same name, and I didn't realize that Hitchcock had remade HIS OWN movie. It is a really interesting concept. I like the original too, and I think the biggest reason why is because of Peter Lorre. I love him as an actor and I think he's perfectly cast in this film. He plays a villain who kidnaps the child of a couple while they are skiing in Switzerland, to protect his gang's plan of assassinating a diplomat.

The movie is short but it's got a great amount of suspense, as the child's father infiltrates the gang to find his daughter. The climax includes a really well-shot gunfight, for a movie of its time.",1389830400,,662,4.382113821138211
5361456,3,B009RWRINE,"This is one of the first sound movies Alfred Hitchcock made in the early 1930s.  The acting is good but the movie drags.  Some parts of this movie are not realistic.  This, from adirector who was known for the attention to detail he put into his work.  I do not recommend this movie- see the remake of this movie with Doris Day and Jim Stewart.",1380240000,2,344,4.246153846153846
5361457,5,B009RWRINE,"The film looks outstanding on BluRay. The picture quality is beautiful. Excellent Criterion release - informative commentary and I love the Del Toro tribute to the film.

The film is a masterpiece. I feel that there is more playfullness in Hitckcock's British films. His British comedic script is delicious (reminded me of Lubitsch or Renoir) - something he could not replicate fully in America.

These British films (essential 39 steps and Lady Vanishes also Criterion) are pure entertainment - there is not the dark sinister threat that is present in his American films. There is almost a fairy-tale innocence to them. This film is considered the first ""Hitchcock"" where he got to explore the themes of interest to him and where his styled becomes formed.

Performances are outstanding - Leslie Banks, Edna Best , Peter Lorre - all characters are wonderfully detailed.

A film to rewatch again and again! Hitchcock was a master craftsman!",1377993600,2,940,5.084415584415584

5361459,3,B009RWRINE,"The Man Who Knew Too Much, 1934 film

The film shows a ski jumping exhibit in St. Moritz Switzerland. Mrs. Lawrence takes part in a skeet shooting contest, and misses. The polite chatter tells something about the times and popular culture. There is a shot, and Mrs. Lawrence's dancing partner dies after giving a message. Mr. Lawrence goes to the man's room to retrieve an object - a message in a shaving brush handle. He now asks to speak to the British consul. But he gets a message warning him to say nothing or his child will never be seen again! Upon his return to England they are questioned by the authorities. Mr. Gibson tells them Louis Bernard was a special agent for the Foreign Office, and knew of a plot to assassinate Mr. Rapa, a foreign official. A telephone call reminds them not to talk to the authorities. The call is quickly traced to Wapping (the name on the message). Mr. Lawrence and his friend Clive visit the name on the message. The dentist gets a treatment instead. Mr. Lawrence hears the words of two conspirators. Next they visit the Tabernacle of the Sun. But they are caught! During a fight Clive escapes to warn Mrs. Lawrence.

When a policeman shows up the conspirators convince him that Clive was drunk and disorderly, so he is arrested. We then learn more about their assassination plot. Mrs. Lawrence is warned against interfering. A scream is heard before the shot is fired. Their plans have gone awry. The shooter is followed back to their lair. They open fire on the police, who send for rifles at a local gunsmith's  store. (No gun ban in those days.) The police open fire then break into the building. The shoot-out at the end is unusual for a Hitchcock film. Their daughter escapes to the roof, and her mother takes aim to protect her from her pursuer. None of the terrorists are taken alive. [It must have some political message for the audience.]

Two decades later another version of this story was filmed, updated for a new audience. Four decades later yet another film was made from this story (""Foul Play""). Comparing them will tell how they match popular culture of their times.",1373414400,,2126,4.63129973474801
5361460,5,B009RWRINE,"I Love these originals in B&W.  Peter Lorre is at his best.  Core Classic for the collector. Don""t miss it!",1371427200,,107,4.3
5361461,4,B009RWRINE,"The Criterion Collection has released only a handful of Alfred Hitchock's movies, but they tend to be subtle, psychological movies that are often eclipsed by better known movies like ""Psycho"" and ""The Birds.""

And yes, Alfred Hitchock may have preferred his later remake of ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"" as opposed to his early ""amateur"" original. But the original has a raw, murky, taut appeal all its own, and it has the veddy veddy British flavor that many of Hitchcock's early hits have. In short, it's unpretentiously enjoyable.

The Lawrence family is vacationing at a ski resort, and hanging out with a friendly Frenchman -- until their last evening, when he is shot during a slow dance with Jill (Edna Best). Bob (Leslie Banks) follows his last instructions, and finds top-secret information hidden inside a shaving brush. He's supposed to take it to the British authorities.

But what they don't realize is that a sinister man at the resort (Peter Lorre) is the leader of an enemy terrorist cell, who is planning to assassinate someone. And to keep Bob from turning in the information, they kidnap Bob and Jill's daughter. Now Bob and British intelligence must somehow free his daughter, while Jill thwarts the assassins...

Hitchcock directed a lot of spy movies, and this one is part of an early trio that includes ""The 39 Steps"" and ""The Lady Vanishes."" Each one is pretty amateurish by comparison to his later works like ""North By Northwest,"" but are still tight, enjoyable little suspense movies.

Hitchcock keeps the relatively simple plot moving along at a rapid pace, with a sense of solid suspense and often creepy dialogue (""Tell her they may soon be leaving us. Leaving us... for a long, long journey...""). It's not a slick James Bond-y flick -- the action is dirtier and misty, like the back streets of London. And the climactic scene in a crammed opera house is wonderfully chaotic.

None of the actors are really remembered now, except for Peter Lorre who plays the slimy creep to perfection. But they all carry off their parts well, with Banks and Best carrying their roles as an ordinary couple in extraordinary circumstances. They're completely believable, and a hundred percent sympathetic -- these are the people next door, dragged into a nightmarish situation.

As for the Criterion release, it's gonna be the loving production we've come to know and expect -- a full high-def digital restoration (since the film is rather elderly), a massive interview with Hitchcock from 1972 and an audio interview by Franois Truffaut, a film critic booklet by Farran Smith Nehme, an interview with the always awesome Guillermo del Toro, and audio commentary by Philip Kemp. Not their most expansive work, but a decent showing for an older movie.

Hitchcock may not have known as much about filmmaking, but the original ""Man Who Knew Too Much"" had plenty of raw cinematic skill and a powerful knowledge of character.",1368144000,,2929,4.939024390243903
5361462,5,B009RWRINE,"Beginning with his first major Hollywood production, Alfred Hitchcock began a familiar formula within his films which made for countless successes. He very often used ordinary people, put into what he called extraordinary situations. In the case of The Man Who Knew Too Much, Leslie Banks stars as the ordinary man and title character. Once discovering a plot for a political assassination, an otherwise average man is thrown into a thrilling case of international intrigue.

  The recently released biopic about Alfred Hitchcock is primarily focused on the risks that he took when making the film Psycho, which essentially started the slasher genre and changed the direction of horror pictures forever more. This was certainly an interesting point in Hitchcock's career, but mostly because it was later on in his career and many thought that his best pictures had already been made. The truth is, even from this first Hollywood production, Hitchcock was not afraid to take risks.

  One of these risks comes in the casting of the film's most memorable villain, Abbott (Peter Lorre). This would be Lorre's transition into English-speaking roles, though it came at a time of desperation. Although Lorre was an admired and respected actor after M, the war had put a hold on a film career in Germany. The Man Who Knew Too Much was a saving grace for Lorre's career, and a risk that paid off well for Hitchcock. So much so that it is hard not to miss Lorre most of all in Hitchcock's admirable second attempt at this film decades later.

  The Blu-ray release for The Man Who Knew Too Much includes a new digital restoration of the film, with uncompressed monaural soundtrack. There is also an optional audio commentary with film historian Philip Kemp and a new interview with fan and filmmaker, Guillermo del Toro. Archived material includes a 1972 interview with Hitchcock and audio excerpts from Truffaut's legendary interview from 1962. There is also a short featurette with a restoration demonstration and a booklet insert featuring an essay by critic Farran Smith Nehme

5361463,3,B009RWRINE,"For those who've seen this movie, I'm sure you remember how short it is.  Around 70-something minutes.  And while there are a few valuable exras on the disc, such as a video interview with Hitchcock, the rest is fairly lackluster, in my opinion.  My advice is wait until it goes on sale.  Spend the big bucks on 39 Steps, instead.  The film is better, as is the supplemental package.",1366243200,,383,4.492753623188406

5361467,3,B009RWRINE,"The Man Who Knew Too Much was released in 1934 and will not disappoint. The film begins on the ski slopes of St. Moritz, Switzerland, and shows a female shooting a rifle in competition. Later we learn that the woman shooter's daughter had been kidnapped. We see the kidnappers and police in a shootout during a concert at London's Royal Albert Hall, which sets the scene for the fighting between the kidnappers and police. At the end, the mother of the kidnapped girl shoots the person holding her daughter and she is freed. This 75 minute film provides a preview for what is to come in later Hitchcock films.",1363478400,,609,4.5963302752293576
5361468,5,B009RWRINE,"I am so pleased with this excellent restoration of a Hitchcock's classic.  I wish Criterion could have done more with the restoration of The 39 Steps and The Lady Vanishes where even with Blu-rays did not do these classics justice.  Hope Criterion will consider remaster them again.  For those fans who do not have this latest Criterion Collection DVD version,  please do yourself a favor and add this to your collection.",1363305600,,421,4.887323943661972
5361469,5,B009RWRINE,"A gem of film that exemplifies visual storytelling. It's reminiscent of the best of Fritz Lang--inventive, kinetic, playful, and brimming with detail. What Hitchcock adds to this is his own cool, comedic touch to create a work of pure entertainment. The director was already in full command of the workings of film language at this point, and he used every element of the medium to heighten his story and tell it the way that only a movie can. There's a delightful weirdness to it as well, with its offbeat humor, creepy villains and strange set pieces.

As far as comparing it to the remake, personally I prefer this version. Some might complain that the original has too much artifice to it, that it feels heightened or unreal, but to me this is exactly the film's charm. The problem with the 1956 remake, to my mind, is that it's sufficiently naturalistic that the kidnapping of the child is too jarring; it's simply too horrible an occurrence for a movie which is essentially intended to be entertainment. The artificiality of the original 1934 version puts the viewer at a safe distance from the harshness of this plot device, and we can relax knowing that it's all not really TOO serious.

Also, Doris Day belting out ""Que Sera Sera"" twice in one movie is a little much.

The Criterion production is fantastic, of course; the clarity of the film is amazing (especially when compared to the terrible public domain version I'd seen previously), and the bonus materials give us a nice glimpse into Hitchcock's method and genius. It can be a little tough to parse what the characters are saying at times, thanks to the various accents and an almost eighty-year-old soundtrack, but that's only to be expected.

All in all, I strongly recommend it.",1362787200,,1748,4.7781456953642385
5361470,5,B009RWRINE,"(This is a review of the Blu-Ray version.)
What a thrill it is to see one of Hitchcock's earliest British films (from 1934) restored to such beautiful life.  Criterion's transfer may be one of the best they've ever done, with every frame looking like a crisp still photograph.  Deep blacks, bright whites and virtually no discernible blemishes prevail throughout the entire 75 minute running time.
The extras, meanwhile, are quite the added treat!  A 1972 interview with Hitchcock, conducted by journalist Pia Lindstrom (the daughter of Ingrid Bergman), is hugely informative and entertaining.  Hitchcock appears here in good humor and shares many wonderful anecdotes about his films.
Finally, the film itself.  ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"" was Hitchcock's return to form after a series of disappointing and mostly unsuccessful pictures.  Here one begins to see the successful combination of humor and dread that would highlight his greatest films.  With this release, Criterion has completed a must-have trilogy of Hitchcock's best British films (the other two being ""The 39 Steps"" and ""The Lady Vanishes"", both also available on wonderful Blu-ray editions).  If you already own one of those poor-quality, cheap boxed-set versions of TMWKTM, it's time for an upgrade.  For the Hitchcock fan, this Criterion edition is pure gold.",1362182400,3,1328,5.315789473684211

5361473,3,B009RWRINE,"The first directed Hitchcock movie in the 1930's introduces Peter Lorre to the screen. It's good, but the age shows. The James Stewart-Doris Day remake in the 1950's is far superior. I only would recommend this early version if you wanted a complete Hitchcock collection.",1361059200,,271,5.044444444444444
5361474,5,B009RWRINE,"Like most, I'm more familiar with the Jimmy Stewart-starring remake than the 1934 original. And by ""more familiar with"" I mean I didn't know the original existed until a few years ago. Smarter people than I can do a much better job comparing and contrasting the two versions. But I believe it stands up just fine on its own, even while I still prefer the latter version (though an included essay makes a strong argument for the original).

First, though, the restoration. It looks incredible. The film could be average and the restoration job would be worth five stars alone. Similarly, the sound is as clean and crisp as you could want. Criterion has knocked it out of the park again.

As to the film itself, it's immensely enjoyable. It lacks the nuance of the remake and the polish that Hitchcock developed as a director, but it's worth seeing for Peter Lorre's performance alone, his first in English. A performance he delivered, I might add, without knowing quite what he was saying, as he learned his lines phonetically on account of not actually speaking English at the time.

At the end of the day, it's classic Hitchcock presented by Criterion. What's not to like?",1360540800,5,1173,4.740196078431373

5361477,5,B009RWRINE,"The original version of Alfred Hitchcock's THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH (Gaumont-British, 1934), has often been overshadowed by the director's 1956 remake starring James Stewart and Doris Day. That version always struck me as an overlong movie built around its popular co-stars, whereas the original is all about the story, which gets told deftly in just 75 minutes. The pattern Hitchcock laid down in THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH is revisited to varying degrees in films like THE 39 STEPS (Gaumont-British, 1935), THE LADY VANISHES (Gaumont-British, 1937), SABOTEUR (Universal, 1942), and NORTH BY NORTHWEST (MGM, 1959).

A husband and wife (Leslie Banks, Edna Best), vacationing in St. Moritz, come in possession of knowledge regarding an assassination plot, and have their young daughter (Nova Pilbeam) kidnapped in order to force them to co-operate with the assassins. One big advantage the original version has over the remake is the presence of the fascinating Peter Lorre as the arch villain. This was Lorre's first English speaking role, and he gives a performance that's expertly nuanced with oily menace and perverse humor. Lorre's character goes a long way in giving the film its distinctively dark atmosphere. Of course, the suspense is developed intriguingly, climaxing in the well edited Albert Hall sequence. But it doesn't end there; we then get an exciting shootout between the police and the criminals which reaches it's height literally as one of the kidnappers corners the little girl on the edge of a roof, by which time we're at the edge of our seats in pure, Hitchcockian style.

I'm a great admirerer of Hitchcock's British films, and it always frustrated me that THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH was only available in dupey, public domain copies on budget DVD sets. Happily, this is no longer the case. Criterion's fully restored Blu-ray release of this important Hitchcock work is beautiful, with a clarity to the image and audio that's never been available to us before. This commendable restoration, transferred from a 35mm nitrate fine-grain master print, is sure to renew interest in the original MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH, and help put it in proper perspective as being superior to the  remake.

The extra features will enthrall any Hitchcock fan: A commentary by film historian Philip Kemp, an interview with director Guillermo del Toro, ""The Illustrated Hitchcock"" - interviews with the director conducted by journalist Pia Lindstrom and film historian William K. Everson, audio excerpts from Francois Truffaut's 1962 interview with Hitchcock, and a restoration comparison. There's also an in-depth booklet with an essay by Farran Smith Nehme.

5361479,5,B009RWRINE,"This Criterion edition is well worth the price. Everything you need to know about this film is included with the informative extras and booklet. I don't have Blu-Ray but I can say the DVD's restored visual & audio quality is as good as we will get considering the age of the film. You can always upgrade to Blu-Ray but for now this disc will not disappoint and that's putting it mildly. It looks great in standard definition on my 42"" Panasonic Viera which is a year old. If you have any doubts before purchasing this film in either format, watch the disc's restoration demonstration which also can be found online on Criterion's website. One extra to make this edition a keeper is director Guillermo del Toro's capsule summary of Hitchcock's style and themes. I wasn't aware that del Toro who is a lifelong fan wrote a book about Hitchcock so this explains his incisive, enthusiastic remarks. And there's a vintage 1972 interview with the Master of Suspense I recall seeing on TV. Here you will learn more about his creative decisions while making his films. As in this or other interviews, he always makes for enlightening and amusing conversation.

  As for the film itself, I prefer this version to the 1955 remake. This is Hitchcock developing his craft which bloomed with his next film 'The Thirty-Nine Steps.'  As in any Hitchcock film it's the individual scenes that are more important here (a plus or minus criticism of his British films; read Graham Greene's contemporary reviews for the negative ones.) although his American films were better paced. And how could any film with Peter Lorre as the lead villain not hold your attention? It's hard to believe he learned his lines phonetically for his first English-speaking role because he is most convincing with his understated menace and rage. The other actors mostly forgotten unless you're into early British films are very good and well chosen for their roles. In fact, every actor and extra seems to have the right face & body because Hitchcock had a good eye for casting. Be sure to listen to the commentary to learn about the production history, actors, continuity issues, and censorship problems for its time. A must for fans who have been waiting for a good restoration and one with extras.",1359158400,,2259,4.829457364341085

5361481,5,B009RWRINE,"NOTE: THIS REVIEW APPLIES TO THE CRITERION COLLECTION STANDARD DVD EDITION OF ""THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH""

THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH is one of those movies that has been in legal limbo for so long, that one despaired of anyone ever doing the legal, much less the archival and restoration work, involved in returning the movie to some kind of presentable state. Unlike most of Hitchcock's other early British thrillers, whose US copyrights were ""merely"" shaky (a problem partly solved by the GATT Treaty), or where the underlying story-rights had migrated elsewhere, THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH had been remade by Hitchcock himself, who was on record as decisively preferring his later version -- it was all very complicated, and contrived to make the prospect of upgrading the original all the more daunting on its face.

But here it is, looking fresher and newer than anyone in 2013 has a right to expect, with details that have been missing for half-a-century or more from extant copies, and killer sound, too. And this reviewer, having done the audio commentary on Criterion's DVD of THE LADY VANISHES, can say all of this with some sense of authority.",1358899200,6,1153,4.788944723618091

5361483,5,B009RWRINE,"I have loved this early Hitchcock film since I was a child. Thanks to home video we were able to view it in our homes instead of cruddy looking TV prints. The public domain versions on video didn't look much better, but we could watch it when we wanted to. Criterion started a trend back in the  day with immaculate Laserdisc transfers (boy those were costly!) and then DVD and now blu ray. I am so thankful they have survived all these years so they could bring us great transfers like this one into the hi def age. Who would ever think a little film like this would get the respect and care that it has deserved after all these years. So many people know about the American remake Hitch did and know nothing about this great classic. Well its time for the newer generation to catch Hitchcock's earlier British films thanks to Criterion and these awesome restorations. The Lady Vanishes always will be the cleanest and detailed of their restorations, but The Man Who Knew Too Much comes close. I have never seen this old movie look and sound as good. We can finally follow what is going on in the final scene! Images aren't lost in the shadows. This is one striking picture when you come to realize its from 1934. There are still a few soft spots and blemishes, but they are far and few between. I am so amazed how good the video looks, that I haven't even went through the special features (will love to hear the commentary). The movie survives on its own and doesn't need all the bells and whistles that special editions have (it is nice to have them though).
Criterion just keeps proving to me why they are my favorite when it comes to classic films on blu ray. Cannot thank you enough for releasing this great classic on home video (finally).
Bravo!",1358726400,8,1754,4.447204968944099
5361484,5,B009RWRINE,"One of a series of Hitchcock classics made after the Master escaped making junk like ""Waltzes from Vienna"", ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"" was, according to Hitch himself the work of a ""talented amateur"". I would disagree with that assessment. While this version of ""Man"" may not have been made while Hitch was at the height of his powers as a director (the 1950's through, arguably, 1963), it shows the same attention to detail, brilliantly thought out and staged sequences that we would see in ""The 39 Steps"". After failed attempts to remake ""The Lodger"", Hitchcock finally got the chance to remake his own early work with the 1956 version starring James Stewart and Doris Day.

Hitchcock dreamed up the scenerio for ""Man"" while on his honeymoon but pitched the idea to producer Michael Balcon as an attempt to adapt one of the Bulldog Drummond stories popular at the time.

SPOILERS:

While vacationing in Switzerland Bob (Leslie Banks), Jill (Edna Banks) and daughter Betty (Nova Pilbeam)befriend Louis Bernard (Pierre Fresnay). During dinner the diplomat is murdered but not before giving Jill that will her to learn of an assassination planned in London. To keep Jill and Bob quiet their daughter is kidnapped.

END OF SPOILERS:

Featuring Peter Lorre in his first English speaking role, ""Man"" demonstrates that Hitchcock had already begun to develop his skills as a director of taunt thrillers.

In its own way, 1934 version of ""Man"" although less sophisticated and lighter in tone than the 1956 film, this more compact version of the same story displays wit and ingenuity.

Working in collaboration with the British Film Institute, Criterion has done a marvelous job of transferring this nicely done restoration. Most of the film looks exceptionally good with nice contrast, detail and many of the flaws evident in public domain versions of the film not a problem here.

There are, however, a couple of shots here and there that suffer from a soft image. Two shots of Banks in medium shot are extremely soft and I doubt that it was intentional. It's more than likely that these were the best available versions of those shots as the BFI painstakingly assembled the best version they could from the best surviving elements.

We get a thoughtful commentary track by Phillip Kemp as well as a featurette with film director (and author of an exceptional book on Hitchcock)Guillermo del Toro. The 1972 BBC documentary ""The Illustrated Hitchcock"" has been trimmed down to around fifty minutes for its presentation here giving a concise overview of Hitch's career. We also get an excerpt from Traffaut's early 60's interview with Hitchcock.

As with all of Criterion's releases, we get a booklet essay by  Farran Smith Nehme.

This is a fine restoration by Criterion (at least to my eyes) and the extras are quite nice as well. Is the 1934 ""Man"" better than the 1956? I'd argue that they are very different films made for different audiences with each one of them having merit.",1358380800,8,2975,4.928
5361485,5,B009RWRINE,"We all know the movie, what everyone wants to know is how this new Criterion restoration looks.
I can tell you that this is the BEST The Man Who Knew Too Much has ever looked.  An original Nitrate Fine Grain that was made from the Nitrate Camera Original Negatives was used to make this Blu-ray.  Apparently the Nitrate Camera Original Negatives are lost or have disintegrated, so this is the best film master available.  This Nitrate film Fine Grain was located in the British Archive.

The Gray Tones are perfect, no loss of details in the shadows or light areas.

The focus may not be as sharp as a modern film, but it is very good. Only the original camera negatives would give a sharper image.

The film condition is near flawless. i believe this was a wet-gate transfer (using a liquid that would fill in any scratches when transferring to video).  The source film was fairly free of wear to begin with.

Image stabilization was used to steady the picture of the now-shrunken Nitrate film.  So no bouncy image.

The audio has also go through a clean-up and is easy to hear. You won't feel like you are in the same room, but you can not expect much more from a 1934 soundtrack recording.

This is the best that existing films and modern technology will give you.",1358294400,37,1267,4.5131578947368425
5361486,4,B009RWRINE,"After NORTH BY NORTHWEST, the 1956 remake of THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH is my favorite Alfred Hitchcock movie, which makes it difficult to be objective in writing about the original 1934 version.

The remake starred James Stewart and Doris Day as American tourists in Morocco who stumble upon a political assassination plot, but are prevented from telling the authorities because the bad guys have kidnapped their son.  In the 1934 original, Leslie Banks and Edna Best are a British couple in Switzerland, whose daughter is taken when they discover the dangerous secret.  Peter Lorre, in his first English-speaking role, heads the gang of assassins in this version.

There are definitely some great Hitchcockian touches and set pieces in the original, but the overall film and its performances are rather stagy, lacking subtlety and the nail-biting suspense of the remake.  That's not to say the movie isn't entertaining, because it is.  Paraphrasing Hitchcock: ""The difference is that the 1934 picture was made my a talented amateur, whereas the remake was made by a professional.""

What's interesting about this version is the comparison of how essentially the same story has been told in some remarkably different ways.  The key Albert Hall sequence has its genesis in the film, as does the confrontation in the church, though the handling of those scenes is far removed from the 1956 version.  Also, the final confrontation in the earlier movie bears no resemblance to the later one.  It's a straight shoot-out, inspired by an actual event, the Sidney Street siege, which took place in 1911.

The Criterion Collection has released the original THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH in a new pristine digital restoration that includes some marvelous extras.  Among them is THE ILLUSTRATED HITCHCOCK,  an extensive 1972 television interview with the director, conduced by Pia Lindstrom and William K. Everson.  There is also audio commentary by film historian Philip Kemp, audio excerpts from Francois Truffaut's 1962 interviews with Hitchcock, an new interview with director Guillermo del Toro, the usual essay-filled booklet found in all Criterion releases, plus a restoration comparison.

This DVD is a ""must"" for all students and fans of Hitchcock.

5361487,5,B009RWRINE,"I can hardly contain my excitement knowing Criterian will release this early Hitchcock masterpiece...and no doubt will do a good transfer..
Now for the miracle of miracles lets see a great transfer of  'Young and Innocent'",1354665600,2,222,5.166666666666667
5361488,3,B009RWRINE,"While there is no question Criterion's upcoming release will be a big improvement on the quality of several older transfers, by Hitchcock's own admission, this 1934 version is not one of his best.  I agree.  While the thriller isn't quite up to it's reputation, there are some scenes showing the brilliance of Hitch.

The bad guys, bent upon killing a visiting politician in London, plot to assassinate him at the theater.  Peter Lorre, the leader chorographs the shot to be taken at the time of the cymbals crashing.  Our heroine (Edna Best) discovers the plot as her eyes dart back and forth between the intended target and the box where the killer lurks.  Another scene at the end also involves Best as her character Jill must shoot the assassin as he chases her teenage daughter across a rooftop.  This is the good stuff.

The other scenes are filled with henchmen, always smoking, fighting with our hero played by Leslie Banks. He never takes off his trenchcoat, even when held captive inside for hours.  The fights are terribly unrealistic and he seems pretty calm when his daughter's life is at stake.  Except for a few tense scenes, the movie underwhelmed my expectations.

Hitchcock, realizing the film did not meet his own expectations, remade it in 1956 with James Stewart and Doris Day in one of her few dramatic roles.  It is far superior.",1353283200,11,1352,4.780172413793103
5361489,5,B009RWRINE,"The Criterion Collection has released only a handful of Alfred Hitchock's movies, but they tend to be subtle, psychological movies that are often eclipsed by better known movies like ""Psycho"" and ""The Birds.""

And yes, Alfred Hitchock may have preferred his later remake of ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"" as opposed to his early ""amateur"" original. But the original has a raw, murky, taut appeal all its own, and it has the veddy veddy British flavor that many of Hitchcock's early hits have. In short, it's unpretentiously enjoyable.

The Lawrence family is vacationing at a ski resort, and hanging out with a friendly Frenchman -- until their last evening, when he is shot during a slow dance with Jill (Edna Best). Bob (Leslie Banks) follows his last instructions, and finds top-secret information hidden inside a shaving brush. He's supposed to take it to the British authorities.

But what they don't realize is that a sinister man at the resort (Peter Lorre) is the leader of an enemy terrorist cell, who is planning to assassinate someone. And to keep Bob from turning in the information, they kidnap Bob and Jill's daughter. Now Bob and British intelligence must somehow free his daughter, while Jill thwarts the assassins...

Hitchcock directed a lot of spy movies, and this one is part of an early trio that includes ""The 39 Steps"" and ""The Lady Vanishes."" Each one is pretty amateurish by comparison to his later works like ""North By Northwest,"" but are still tight, enjoyable little suspense movies.

Hitchcock keeps the relatively simple plot moving along at a rapid pace, with a sense of solid suspense and often creepy dialogue (""Tell her they may soon be leaving us. Leaving us... for a long, long journey...""). It's not a slick James Bond-y flick -- the action is dirtier and misty, like the back streets of London. And the climactic scene in a crammed opera house is wonderfully chaotic.

None of the actors are really remembered now, except for Peter Lorre who plays the slimy creep to perfection. But they all carry off their parts well, with Banks and Best carrying their roles as an ordinary couple in extraordinary circumstances. They're completely believable, and a hundred percent sympathetic -- these are the people next door, dragged into a nightmarish situation.

As for the Criterion release, it's gonna be the loving production we've come to know and expect -- a full high-def digital restoration (since the film is rather elderly), a massive interview with Hitchcock from 1972 and an audio interview by Franois Truffaut, a film critic booklet by Farran Smith Nehme, an interview with the always awesome Guillermo del Toro, and audio commentary by Philip Kemp. Not their most expansive work, but a decent showing for an older movie.

Hitchcock may not have known as much about filmmaking, but the original ""Man Who Knew Too Much"" had plenty of raw cinematic skill and a powerful knowledge of character.",1351382400,20,2929,4.939024390243903
8543948,5,B009RWRINE,"If you were to ask me for a list of top five Hitchcock movies, four of the five would come from circa 1930s when he was still lensing in Britain: The Man Who Knew Too Much (1934); The 39 Steps (1935); Young and Innocent (1937); and The Lady Vanishes (1938). I'd stack any of these four early thrillers against any that Hitchcock made in Hollywood. My fifth favorite would be Northy by Northwest (1959), closely followed by Saboteur (1942), Foreign Correspondent (1940), and To Catch A Thief (1955). So, there, my top eight.

I saw the remake before I saw the original. I thought I loved 1956's The Man Who Knew Too Much until I saw the 1934 version, after which I reassessed things and decided that Hitchcock's remake is too bloated. The original is a thing of beauty, marvelously executed and briskly paced and absent of fat, with a running time of 75 mins. The plot involves ruthless anarchists abducting a British couple's daughter to conceal a plot to assassinate a foreign statesman in London. This time out, Hitchcock's MacGuffin is a brush that contains vital information dearly coveted by the British foreign office.

The performances are of the sparkling variety. Leslie Banks and Edna Best play the Lawrences, Bob and Jill, as a loving couple who are playful with each other. The story opens with them and their teen daughter Betty (Nova Pilbeam) holidaying in snow-capped St. Moritz, Switzerland, and it's these early scenes that allow us to get to know these characters. Note that Bob and Jill sort of go against the grain. Jill is the one who indulges in sporting activities: she's a renowned marksman who should have won her contest in skeetshooting that day, except that her daughter distracted her. Anyway, deep into the movie, it's a skill that would serve her well when she needs it most. And Bob? He's a laid-back fellow who seems not to mind his wife's harmless flirtations with other men, although he isn't averse to using Jill's knitting to pranking her while she was dancing with another man at a night club.

But if Lawrence was serious about getting some getback - he wasn't - he should've bided just a few minutes more. The man dancing with his wife is actually a family friend, Louis Bernard (Pierre Fresnay). Whilst engaged in conversation with Jill, Bernard is shot by a sniper from out a window. A fading Bernard slips Jill the key to his room and mentions a brush that needs to be brought to the British consul. Honestly, expiring by way of dancing with a beautiful woman - it's not a bad way to go out.

Where was I? Oh, yes, the sparkling performances. For Peter Lorre, playing the unusual heel would become old hat. Here, he plays the lead anarchist, Abbott, who at times makes for a convivial host, never mind that he sports a nasty forehead scar and he's got skunk hair. But the man can charm in a creepy kind of way.

I know Nova Pilbeam only from two films, this one and in the suspenseful Young and Innocent where she plays the lead. You can make a case for Pilbeam's snatched character here as Hitchcock's actual MacGuffin, the plot device that is given the most cursory of explanations and serves mainly to drive the narrative. Except Pilbeam is very likable and you do root for her to come out okay.

Hitchcock is masterful yet again. 1934's The Man Who Knew Too Much is an addictive watch. I soaked in the banter, was put on edge by the tension, and I marveled at that distinct Hitchcock touch. There are boss set pieces strewn throughout, most notably the concert at the Royal Albert Hall, and the epic shootout at the cult church of the Tabernacle of the Sun, but, before that, the sequence in that same sacred edifice as Lawrence and his chum, Clive, sneak in and proceed to converse by way of singing their words to the hymn being sung. In talking about Lawrence, maybe I made him out to be this limp lily. He's not. He's actually one of Hitchcock's coolest customers. Watch him in the cult church as fights off a mob of goons while he dangles a cigarette off his lips. Now, that's some unflappable sh--.

But, oh, poor, put-upon Clive (Hugh Wakefield), that pal of Lawrence's. In falling into skullduggery with Lawrence, the bloke gets a tooth extracted by a suspicious dentist, is subjected to hypnotism, and, when he reports a crime to the bobby, gets hauled away to the police station. Now that's a friend.

If someone has a sharp object pressed against your jugular and you're given the choice to watch either the original or the remake, go for the original. Sure, it may not have the star power, or the exotic vistas of Morocco, or ""Que Sera, Sera."" What it has is a young Hitchcock at full energy and brimming with exciting ideas. In Leslie Banks and Edna Best, we have two English leads who, to me, are exceedingly more appealing in their activity and in their playfulness than Stewart and Day. Lorre makes for a more memorable villain. And I love that - and a ***SPOILERS ALERT*** now - it's Edna Best who saves the day. And maybe it's because the leads are British, with their pluck and their smile in the face of adversity, but it seems to me the dialogue is delivered with more verve and more snap. And the movie just flows better. It's just better.

- Jill (worried): ""What about your food?""
- Lawrence (dashing out): ""Oh, leave me a bone on the mat.""

Yep. Love the dialogue.",1530489600,,5336,4.583857442348008
8543949,4,B009RWRINE,"This 1934 black and white film is fascinating because of the plot and the way Alfred Hitchcock develops it, how Hitchcock worked in 1934, and how Peter Lorre acts and delivers lines at a time when he knew no English, having just escaped from the Nazis. Lorre plays the leader of a gang of assassins who are planning to kill a diplomat.

8543950,5,B009RWRINE,"THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH (1934 UK, 1935 US) is Hitchcock's first auteur thriller. By that I mean it has all of the elements he later exploited as the ""Master of Suspense."" He had done effective thrillers before this (BLACKMAIL and MURDER! come to mind), but they were dry runs for what he achieves in this film. The oddly appealing psychopath so central to his films is well played by Peter Lorre, who looks almost forlorn over the terrible things he plans to do as a terrorist and all-purpose baddie. Hitch had a love/hate relationship with his villains--horrible as they are, they remain fascinating. Norman Bates (PSYCHO, 1960) begins to take form in Lorre's character. The most striking moment here, to my mind, is not the nail-biting sequence in Royal Albert Hall, but the chair throwing scene in the false church; startling in its violence, it reminded me of A CLOCKWORK ORANGE (1971). Hitch had two secrets that place him in a class by himself as a director: he knew exactly where to position the camera, how far away to keep it, how to move it, how long to hold it; and he got his actors to do things no other director did. I saw many things in this thrilling Criterion cleanup of the public domain copy that Hitch later used in his films, such as the rooftop sequence he used in TO CATCH A THIEF (1955).

Criterion does an excellent job in restoring this film and offering a thorough commentary on it. The Hitchcock movie is just as good even when compared to the latter version. This one is slightly shorter, it is in black and white, the setting and many events happen here differently than in the 1955 version. In addition to this, a girl is kidnapped instead of a boy. In spite of these differences, this film is as enjoyable as the 1955 version. One thing this movie has to its favor is Peter Lorre playing the cold-blooded mastermind of a murderous plot to assassinate a politician. I have always thought that the kidnappers in the second movie didn't seem too convincing as political terrorists. However, Hitchcock may have improved the assassination attempt scene in the latter film. Overall though, this is a great Hitchcock film from the thirties.
