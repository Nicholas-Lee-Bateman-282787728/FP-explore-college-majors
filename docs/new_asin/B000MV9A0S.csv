8173041,5,B000MV9A0S,"The first thing you should know about this DVD is that the sequence is by Gary Kraftsow. In 1999 he founded the renowned American Viniyoga Institute. He's been a pioneer in the transmission of yoga for health, healing and personal transformation for 30 years. His credentials are extensive and impressive. Rest assured that when you do this workout, you're in good hands ... very good hands.

The instructions are given in voice over by Bija Bennett, herself an internationally renowned author, yoga teacher and seminar leader with extensive training in yoga, fitness, and mind-body health. A quote from Wikipedia says this about her: ""As director/producer of YogaAway's new series of elegantly designed, contemporary yoga videos, Bija is on the leading edge of the next step in mind-body health. With her unique combination of personal charisma, accessible healing skills and distinctive artistic style, she speaks strongly to a cross-generational audience who is interested in holistic health being expressed in new ways.""

I would definitely describe this DVD as ""elegantly designed"". The set is a white floor with a white backdrop upon which are projected white patterns that change from time to time, almost resembling wings, or wind patterns in white desert sands. The postures are demonstrated alternately by a woman and a man, both wearing white outfits. The background music is nice -- quiet and unobtrusive. You can watch a short clip of this DVD at the YogaAway website ( [...] If that link didn't come through, just do a Google search for 'yogaaway' and watch the clip for ""The Workout: Feeling Great Again"". The music in the clip is a bit louder than on the DVD, but it's in the same style. I like that Ms. Bennett speaks in a pleasant, normal, everyday tone of voice, as you'll hear in the clip. There's no ""spiritual"" or ""flowery"" talk, just good form and breathing pointers throughout the workout.

The workout consists of 16 postures which I will try to describe in detail, since the names alone really wouldn't tell you much. There is the briefest of pauses between each posture, only 5 to 10 seconds at most -- just long enough to breathe and feel the effects of the asana you just completed. This in no way disrupts the flow of the workout. (Even Bikram's world-famous Hot Yoga routine has pauses between sets and postures). This workout progresses smoothly and logically from one posture to the next, even though they are not linked with vinyasas.

The postures all incorporate ""dynamic flow"". Each one is made up of unique (and fun) flowing moves. The movement in each posture is done in a slow, graceful manner. Some postures have a ""stronger version"" that is done after the regular version.

At the start of each pose, its Sanskrit name appears on the screen, then Ms. Bennett briefly gives the name in English and states which body parts it benefits. Incidentally, there is no menu on the DVD, but it's chaptered for each posture. The total length of the workout is 44 minutes. I think it's suitable for everyone from beginner to advanced level, but I wouldn't call it a ""challenging"" or ""demanding"" workout. It would be perfect for those days when you don't feel like really exerting or pushing yourself, but still want a full-body workout, delivered in a gentle, flowing routine. Would also be good anytime you want a ""change of pace"" workout.

The comments below in quotation marks are things Bija says during the brief pauses.

 1. The workout begins standing in Samasthiti (Stable and Balanced Posture) and doing a couple of minutes of Ujjayi breathing.

 2. Tadasana (Tree Posture). Standing in Tadasana, rise slowly up on toes, bringing arms out to side and overhead. Lower halfway down, arms straight out to sides. Repeat 3 times, holding final  position (on toes with arms overhead) for several breaths. Come down slowly. ""Pause and feel the vibration that pervades your body"".

 3. Ardha Uttanasana (Half Stretched Upright Posture). Arms overhead, come into forward bend. Come halfway up, moving arms out to sides (airplane). Exhale down, hands by feet. Inhale all the way up, arms overhead. Repeat. Now ... the stronger version: Same as before, but this time when coming halfway up, hold arms straight out in front instead of out to sides. Repeat once, holding the last halfway up position for several breaths. Then bend forward, all the way down, and stay for several breaths. Come all the way up, lower arms. ""Pause and feel the effects of this posture in your back.""

 4. Virabhadrasana (Vitality Posture). Move slowly into and out of Warrior 1, raising and lowering arms as you do so. Repeat 3 more times, holding last repetition (Warrior 1, arms overhead) for several breaths. Repeat sequence on other side.

 5. Ardha Utkatasana (Half Squat Posture). Raise arms overhead, bend forward - chest to thighs, hips at knee level, hands  by feet. Raise arms as high as you can, keeping hips at knee level (Chair Pose). Exhale, lay chest back on thighs. Raise arms, inhale and come all the way up, arms overhead. Repeat 3 times, holding final Chair position for several breaths, then chest on thighs for several breaths. Come to standing, arms overhead, lower arms. ""Pause and feel the increased circulation in your body"".

 6. Cakravakasana (Goose Posture). Kneel on all fours (table posture). Inhale to Cat, exhale rounding back and lowering back into Extended Child. Inhale forward into Cat. Repeat sequence 5 more times, then come to rest in Extended Child for a few seconds.

 7. Ardha Salabhasana and Salabhasana (Half Locust and Locust Postures). Lie on stomach, arms extended forward on the floor. Lift chest and right leg, stretching your left arm forward and up, hips level. Come down, repeat on other side, and keep repeating sequence for several reps. Now slide hands back by ribs, elbows up. Lift chest and legs and stay for several breaths. Come down, palms by side, and rest.

 8. Dhanurasana (Bow Posture). Strengthens the muscles of your shoulders, back, buttocks and legs. Inhale into Bow Posture, exhale down. Repeat in slow flowing motion for 4 reps, holding the last one for several breaths. ""Notice the activation of your entire system.""

 9. Vajrasana (Diamond Posture). Releases tension from back, neck and shoulders. Stand on your knees, arms at sides. Raise arms forward and up. Bend forward into Child's Pose, sweeping arms around to place the hands on your lower back. Inhale up, sweeping arms forward and overhead. Repeat 6 times in graceful, flowing motion. Rest in Child's Pose, hands by feet.

10. [Note: I think this one's a super nice flow.] Urdhva Mukha Svanasana and Chaturanga Dandasana (Upward Facing Dog and Four Limb Stick Posture). Stand on knees. Inhale, lifting arms forward and up. Bend forward into Extended Child. Come up into Cat. Curl your toes under and lift into Downward Facing Dog. Come forward, keeping arms straight, lower your knees to the floor, arch your back (modified Up Dog). Bending your arms, lower your chest till torso is parallel to the floor (modified Chaturanga). Inhale back up to modified Up Dog. Push back into Down Dog. Lower knees to floor. Lift chest and chin (Cat). Exhale, rounding back, moving back into Child's Pose. Inhale, raise your arms, lift chest, standing up on your knees. Exhale down into Child's Pose. This completes one full sequence. Repeat entire sequence. Now the stronger version: Same flow sequence, but this time keep your knees off the ground in Up Dog and Chaturanga. Two rounds, holding final Chaturanga for 10 seconds, then come into Up Dog, then Down Dog, forward into Cat, then round your back and come back into Extended Child and rest for a couple of breaths. ""Now sit up and notice the activation of your entire body.""

11. Supta Padangusthasana (Prone Toe Holding Posture Variation). Lying on back, feet off the floor, knees bent, hands behind the knees. Straighten legs, hold back of right knee with both hands, lower your straight left leg until heel is a few inches off the floor. Slowly lift leg back up toward the ceiling. Repeat 4 times in slow, flowing motion, holding last rep (foot a few inches from floor) for several breaths. Repeat sequence on other side.

12. Jathara Parivrtti (Abdominal Twisting Posture).  Lie on your back with arms straight out to the side, palms down, raise one leg straight overhead, then lower it across your body toward the opposite hand. Bring it back to vertical. Repeat for several reps, holding last rep with foot toward opposite hand and a few inches off the floor for several breaths. Repeat with other leg.

13. Paschimatanasana and Navasana (Stretch to the West and Boat Postures). Sit with legs extended straight out in front of you, hands by hips. Raise arms overhead. Bend forward, belly and chest to thighs. Lift your chest and arms forward and come up. Lean back, lower arms to chest height, knees bent, feet on floor. Lift arms overhead and come up, sliding legs out straight. Repeat 3 times. Now the stronger version: Same as before, but this time when you come up from the forward bend, as you lean back, keep your legs straight and lift them so you're in Boat Pose. Come up, arms overhead, lowering legs to floor. Repeat, this time staying in Boat Pose for several breaths. Come up, arms overhead, go into forward bend and stay for several breaths, lengthening the spine. Come up, arms overhead, lower arms, lie back on the mat, arms at sides.

14. Dvipada Pitham (Two Footed Posture). Relieves tension in neck, shoulders and back. Lie on back, knees bent, feet on floor, hip distance apart, arms at sides. Lift your pelvis, raising your arms up overhead to the floor behind you. Then gradually lower your hips and arms back down. Repeat 3 times. On the final repetition, lift pelvis but leave your arms down (Bridge Posture) and stay for several breaths. Unwind slowly to come down, pause and rest.

15. Apanasana (Downward Moving Vital Energy Posture). Stay on your back, knees bent, feet off the floor, hands on your knees, arms straight. Exhale, tighten your belly and bring your knees toward your chest. Inhale, move your knees arms' distance away from your chest, keeping your hands on your knees. Repeat 6 times in a slow, flowing motion.

16. Savasana (Corpse Posture). Lie in Savasana, eyes closed, and relax for one minute.

  That's the practice. I enjoy it a lot every time I do it. Like I said, when I don't feel in the mood for Power Yoga or Kundalini (Ravi & Ana are my favorites for that), but still want a workout that leaves me feeling I've done something really good for myself, this is one I often reach for. By the way, I have no ties with the producers of this DVD, or with anyone connected to it. I just wanted to try to post the kind of review that I like to see for fitness DVDs, and give enough details for people to decide if this is something they might enjoy. Hope I succeeded.",1195171200,12,10899,4.840322580645161
8173042,1,B000MV9A0S,"I thought this yoga video was way too slow to be a good workout, and didn't flow well.  The poses call for being held and the lack of movement make it very choppy.  I would prefer more than one person on the screen as I couldn't relate to the made-up model.",1193184000,2,257,4.019607843137255
