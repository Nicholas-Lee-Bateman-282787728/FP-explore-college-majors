333171,4,6301536932,this video of stomach exercises moves a bit faster than I could do. I did as many as I could & moved on to keep with the video workout.,1203292800,,135,3.689655172413793
333172,5,6301536932,"Richard Simmons is known for producing good workout videos and this 1 hour Stomach Formula is produced by the same company, Karl-Lorimar, that did Jane Fonda's early workout videos.  The production is done very professional and pleasing to the eye.

The workout concept is to do SEVEN Minutes, SEVEN Days a week.  The exercises are from the old school.  They are good strenuous workouts that focus on mid-section.  Most are doable, but some will simply not be doable if you have not worked at it.  You need to ""get there"", with practice.  And with discipline, it has to work.  If you are familiar with the early work of Jane Fonda, you will recognize the same mid-section movements and the classic terms like scissors, bicycle, etc.

The Set:
What is pleasing to the eye is the setting and color scheme for each day.  The young exercise group is dressed in clothing that coordinates well with the strategically placed mats and background colors.  Each day is a different color scheme enhanced by the workout outfits and mats. It's easy to see what day you are on. Overhead cameras capture attractive patterns.

Legwarmers!
Made in 1984, you will see plenty of dated workout costumes, and tight curly perms. And, there are no heavyweights here, only slim young people who do it well.

Music:
I always like to workout to my own music, because most exercise music is horrible and repetitive.  This one is so similar to Jane Fonda's early videos, nerving, but tolerable! This tape production is so NOT Richard Simmons, who loves good music.

Overall, this is a tough daily shortened workout!  ....Rizzo",1143244800,4,1598,4.841328413284133
333173,4,6301536932,"Richard Simmons' The Stomach Formula can be difficult for beginners. Stick with it for a week, and you will not be sore at all. You may want to try doing the first seven-minute workout only during your first week or so. Each daily workout is repeated a second time on the video, and you can, if you try, work up to doing the whole thing twice.

There is a different workout for each day of the week. Simmons does one set of exercises, and then repeats them. Each workout is short and to the point. Most of audio consists of instructions on the exercises. Personally, I prefer the ""Oldies"" exercise tape Simmons put out earlier.",1142035200,,627,4.452173913043478
333174,5,6301536932,"i have probably ordered every exercise video there is, but the stomache formula is by far the best video there is. just like he promises if you do the exercise for 7 minutes for 7 days for 7 weeks you will have a flat stomache, period.",1009411200,17,235,4.130434782608695
7812373,5,6301536932,"When I first got this dvd, I laughed and said to myself Oh yeah Richard Simmons. But once I started trying it out, it was torturous. I couldn't finish the routine. It is 7 minutes of pure heck. But if you really want great abs, follow this dvd. 7 minutes a day, 7 days a week for 7 weeks. Great job Richard. I'm sure a lot of people will be and have gotten in shape because of him.",1397001600,,381,3.8974358974358974
7812374,5,6301536932,Had used this video in the past and it definitely works. Love that it's only 7 minutes but can do more than one day,1377993600,,115,3.8333333333333335
7812375,5,6301536932,I bought the VHS used and it was great...saved 30 bucks buying used and no regrets!!! Delivered on time with no damage to tape......the video is a real workout....recommend it for anyone without much time and that loves leg warmers....total 80s flash back,1373846400,,255,4.953488372093023
7812376,5,6301536932,"I've been doing this workout for 20 years.  I like how there are 7 different workouts, so you don't really have a chance to get bored - I just wish Richard would convert this one to DVD, even with the out-dated outfits and hair styles!",1360713600,,235,4.222222222222222
7812377,5,6301536932,"I started doing this workout with my mom when I was about 12. When I was 20 I coached cheerleading and had my varsity cheerleaders do it. Now, 30 and after 2 kids, this is still a great workout. The 7 minute timeframe works great for a busy mom. I do this every morning and it helps energize me for the day. My 4 year old likes to do the workouts with me and my 1 1/2 year old sometimes climbs on me but it's worth every minute.

Get this, stick to it, and you will be amazed with the results.",1338854400,,493,3.881188118811881
7812378,5,6301536932,"I've been using this tape, off and on, for the past 20 years. This is the only thing that works for me and keeps me motivated. It's quick, only 7 minutes a day. It's simple, you don't need any equipment. It works.",1328486400,,213,4.095238095238095
7812379,5,6301536932,This is an excellent exercise tape. I have the original tape from back in the 80's & transferred it to a DVD. Love to exercise by this tape.,1325894400,,140,4.035714285714286
7812380,5,6301536932,"I started using this video after each child was born. It always brought my waist back to a 26"" after all three c-sections.  All my friends always laughed, but I always had great abs! Using it again now that I'm fighting weight gain with menopause!!  I wish they would do a remake on DVD!",1281916800,2,287,4.296296296296297
7812381,5,6301536932,"I must have bought this video close to 25 years ago, and still think it's one of the best.

Like the original Jane Fonda videos, the music and production quality is high.
Richard is serious but pleasant and motivating (none of his silly stuff) as he gets the job done.

Please bring it back to DVD!",1280016000,,298,4.303571428571429
7812382,4,6301536932,"Still love this old ab workout, but I was a little disappointed that it was the same 80's version I already own. It had an updated copyright on the on-line description. Now I just need to get it on DVD.",1259539200,,202,4.075
