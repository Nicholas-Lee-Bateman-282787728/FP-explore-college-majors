7364065,5,B013FDBGV0,"This is another great 80's chick toon!  While I only got to see the Punky Brewster toon alongside She-Ra, Rainbow Brite and Jem as an 80's kid, I never did hear or see this until the mid 90's when I got to see some of the intro.  This show is definitely great!  It's cute and fun too!  While some of the episodes are in no particular order, they're still pretty good and fun to watch.  You'll have lots of fun with the coolest, sweetest gal from Surfside and her friends 'cause good times are happenin' in Maxie's World!",1455235200,,520,4.26530612244898

7364069,4,B013FDBGV0,"Kudos to Mill Creek for bringing this somewhat obscure, but definitely memorable, late-'80s Saturday-morning cartoon back into the public eye. Although the animation is sometimes cheap and overly simplistic, that flaw is easily overlooked thanks to the entertaining (and often thought-provoking) story lines and colorful character personalities.

The one unfortunate aspects of this first-time DVD issue is the sound mastering. As ""Maxie's World"" incorporated a lot of original songs, there are many episodes where the character's voice tracks are barely audible when music is also present. I still have some of the original VHS releases of the show, and this was not as obvious an issue then. So, it seems that not a lot of care was put into necessary restoration of sound quality.

Overall, I'm very happy to finally have the full series of ""Maxie's World"" in an official collection. Episodes like ""Fat Chance,"" ""Pirouettes and Forward Passes,"" and ""Ashes to Ashley"" were unique looks into universal teenage issues that made this show stand out from many other cartoons of the time. By contrast, lighthearted episodes like ""Photo Opportunity"" and ""Very Superstitious"" are a real hoot to enjoy again!",1447459200,,1201,5.315789473684211

7364071,4,B013FDBGV0,"It's so awesome to finally have this on dvd. The 32 episodes are divided onto two discs with the famous Beverly Hills Teens crossover episode (Beach Blanket Battle) appearing as the last episode on disc two along with a preview of Alex & the Kaleidoscope. The first surprise upon opening the set is the inner flip tray case (which Mill Creeks never used before to my knowledge) which is a vast improvement over the paper envelopes/center hub cases. The episode lists are printed on each disc as opposed to the back cover, which shows more generic artwork than the front cover. Another surprise is the addition of episode previews at the end of episodes (which I don't recall seeing during the show's original airing). I am very happy with this release.

As an 80's child, I have a weak spot for cartoons based on toys which were very prevalent during that time. And Maxie (s World) is no exception. Back in the early 80's, Hanna Barberra (Superfriends) and Filmation (He-Man) were the top animation houses, then Marvel (G.I. Joe, Transformers, JEM) took over that position with World Events (Voltron) adding to the mix, but it was around 1982 that DiC Enterprises debuted with Pole Position, a video game based cartoon that was not only fun but also unique for both it's realistic animation style and catchy music. And after cutting their teeth with shows like Jayce and the Wheeled Warriors, they hit paydirt in 1985 with M.A.S.K., which solidified their unique style in animation and became an animation house to be reckoned with. And in 1986/1987, they basically became the most popular with numerous shows like Bionic Six, Beverly Hills Teens and others. And by that time other shows that were created by rival companies, were now being created by DiC (G.I. Joe). And their influence in animation had become apparent (JEM's ""The Presidential Dilemma episode). Toward the end of the 80's, their style had become a bit lazy and their time at the top was over. But Maxie's World was unique because of it's generic yet vibrantly realistic design (the character's hair, facial and makeup coloring and design). It had what I call a ""water color"" design (see the characters artwork on the dvd cover for an example) which was unique at the time. It's a style World Events later emulated on shows like Denver The Last Dinosaur and Vytor. But DiC's Maxie's World was also different because of it's lineage to rival Marvel's shows G.I. Joe, Transformers and JEM, all of them being Hasbro toy properties. Their doll Maxie being was created to compete with Mattel's Barbie, the same rival of Hasbo's previous doll line JEM. It's also rumored that the Maxie's World cartoon was a result of a failed junction between DiC and Mattel to create a Barbie cartoon series after their one hour Barbie and the Rockers cartoon special. And to the casual looker (and maybe a few of those who actually remember watching it on tv), Maxie may seem very Barbie-like, but she is actually different in that she's more relateable in her adventures. Yes, she is a teen aged newscaster, not the president, doctor, singer etc. her rival Barbie is. And as a former artist, the simple water color animation style of the show is very enjoyable to watch.",1445644800,8,3219,4.8

8727492,4,B013FDBGV0,"This was a good show (especially if you are an 80s baby like me.) I vaguely remember watching it way back when and couldn't recall most of it, but did get bouts of nostalgia during the intro. I guess I just have a few gripes with the production of these dvds (although I've grown fond of Cookie Jar ever since the release of Beverly Hills Teens.) I didn't like that not all of the episodes played the intro and that they didn't seem to be in order based on the preview that played after some of the episodes. Another thing I absolutely abhored was how some of the voices would get drowned out by the blaring music, making it difficult to hear what they were saying. I'm guessing there was some technical difficulty with the audio during the transfer from VHS to DVD.
  With that being said, onto what I did like: Despite how old this is, the colors were nice. I also enjoyed the novelty of some of the over the top, often fun and amusing, story lines. I guess my favorite thing would have to be how original the show was in tackling the occasional serious issues some teens face in an outrageous way; somehow the creators managed to make it work. I just wanted to make a note for those parents who worry about what their kids are watching in some cartoons. Episodes such as Ashes to Ashley address the issue of smoking and actually show teenage Ashley purchasing cigarettes despite her age and consuming them in an effort to appear more sophisticated in order to get the lead in the high school play whose director/caster is also a heavy smoker. Of course Maxie and her friends outrightly object to Ashley taking up smoking; in one hilarious scene they all practically fly out of the Surf Burger diner where the gang hangs out when she decides to light up. In another titled Fat Chance the focus is on weight issues. Due to a joke directed towards Ashley about needing to go on a diet, she takes it seriously so her insercurities gets the best of her and she starts visualizing herself as being overweight everytime she looks in a mirror. She then proceeds to starve herself and exercise profusely, despite Maxie trying to reassure her that she is perfectly fine the way that she is. I have to admit, I thought it got a little extreme when Ashley's conscience produces this little scrawny fairy that constantly nags and taunts her about her weight. I mean that little fairy was relentless and I just couldn't picture a little kid watching that unless they were a bit older. Either way all of the episodes end on a good and positive note in its message. Although, the censors would have a field day with this one nowadays. That's probably why it isn't rated.
  By the way, as I expected being a fan of Beverly Hills Teens, the Beach Blanket Battle final episode left something to be desired. Had both creators collaborated, it would have been far better than what it is. The designs were completely off when it came down to the original characters of that awesome show (Bianca looked horrible as a blonde and Lark even worse as a brunette. Not to mention not all of them were in attendance.) All and all I'm glad I own a copy of Maxie's World and welcome it to my growing 80s toons' collection.",1518480000,,3193,4.481099656357388

8727495,5,B013FDBGV0,I loved Maxie when I was a younger and had a VHS tape at one point that was destroyed in a flood. Husband got my the DVD for my birthday and I love it. My 10 year old wanted to see and she is now in love with Maxie too. we stayed up and binge watched almost the whole dvd. Her question to me was why did I get all the good cartoons and she gets the bad ones. lol,1493251200,,362,3.5375
