8225724,3,B000WUN488,"I love Sandra and find that she is very helpful. This was my first time seeing Ron, he was also helpful. This DVD would have been better, for me, if there were actual demo's of the different finishes. You will have to watch and take notes, like someone commeneted before. I wish I could give it 5 stars, but I found it lacking in detail. I wish I had read the reviews before buying, so I would have known there was no actual sewing.",1349308800,,432,4.154761904761905
8225725,5,B000WUN488,"I feel like I've gotten more than my money's worth from this video. They present many many different styles of professional looking hems and seams that I can do myself; and, not just on clothing. In my opinion, this is a must have for every sewer.",1291766400,,247,4.391304347826087
8225726,4,B000WUN488,"Sandra is the queen of quick and easy couture, if there is such a thing. In this video she shares great tips on how to seam a garment so that it truly has top designer quality. Her videography isn't as sophisticated as others such as ""Sewing with Nancy"" so some techniques aren't very easy to see, but it is good enough that I was able to follow everything. She also adds a bit of wit, which makes great fun out of what could otherwise be a somewhat dry subject. I'd recommend it for the serious home garment sewer/designer.",1227657600,3,524,4.357142857142857
8225727,5,B000WUN488,"Sandra Betzina has done it again! She and Ron Collins are a great team; they interact well, share the limelight, give great techniques, share new skills, and bring different views on the same topics. Having sewn for nearly 5 decades, I didn't think they could teach me much. But, I took notes, practiced their ideas, and have made some really cute outfits using them. You can't go wrong with this one.",1216684800,3,401,4.661971830985915
8225728,4,B000WUN488,"This DVD is rather different than I had expected. I was hoping for a menu of demonstrations on how to make and finish seams and hems etc. I thought there might be a menu list that one could easily access  before starting a particular project, much like an index of a sewing book but with visuals (Betzina's""Power Sewing "" is excellent). However, Betzina and Collins show different techniques one after another, within a theme but in no particular order. For it to be useful as a reference source one would need to view the DVD multiple times and take notes. That said, they do demonstrate things clearly and transmit to the viewer their enthusiasm and love of the art of sewing. If people want to feel empowered to try new ideas and learn about tricks of the trade and new products then definitely worth buying. A visual is worth a hundred words for me.",1200787200,9,853,4.538961038961039
