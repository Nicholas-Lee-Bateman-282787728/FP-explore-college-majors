8252541,5,B0013QH9WW,"I recommend this video to all people who need to do chair exercises -- whether Parkinson's or MS or other disability. Her personality is very uplifting and the moves are well explained and excellent.
It gets you moving.",1368057600,,219,4.7894736842105265
8252542,2,B0013QH9WW,"I ordered this for my husband who has PD. Mary Ann's instructions are given too fast and she changes from one type of movement to another way to fast for any patient with PD. I cannot recommend it. And, in addition, in order to get to the exercises, you must first listen/watch 3 advertisements. We paid $20+ for the DVD; I don't want to watch commercials.",1323475200,8,356,4.409090909090909
