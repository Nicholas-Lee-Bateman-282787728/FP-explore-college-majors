8049691,4,B0007OY2W6,A wonderful sequel to a great movie.  Amazing fight scenes.  Several of our favorite characters return.  I'm not sure if someone who hasn't seen the previous movie will enjoy it as much as someone who is already familiar with the universe would.  Definitely a must have for cyberpunk anime fans out there.,1240617600,,305,4.8076923076923075
