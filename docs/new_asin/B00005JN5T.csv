1564737,3,B00005JN5T,"Greg (played well by Ben Stiller) and Pam (Teri Polo) hook up with her parents (Robert De Niro and Blythe Danner) to visit his folks (Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand). This is the sequel to ""Meet the Parents,"" which was a funnier film.  The cat, the CIA checks, and the ""Circle of Trust"" are also in this movie, but the jokes don't seem as fresh, although some of them made me laugh.  We also get to see Mrs. Focker's sex statues, hear about senior-citizens' sex practices, etc., since she is a sex therapist in Florida.  Her husband was a lawyer, who became a stay-at-home dad, and has just put up a bulletin board to his son's ""accomplishments,"" such as finishing 9th (out of 10 places) in some competition.  This display of fatherly pride, of course, is viewed as honoring mediocrity by DeNiro.  DeNiro is made to do ridiculous things in this film, such as breast-feeding his grandchild through a tube hooked up to an artificial breast, but at least he has an Albert Einstein puppet to use with the baby to help him become more intelligent.  In addition, we get to endure the sexual machinations of the Focker's dog, who has sex with the puppet, but we also get to see the dog flushed down a toilet by DeNiro's cat.  Another good moment is when we meet a teenage boy, who looks like a Hispanic Ben Stiller, after learning that his character made it with the Focker's Hispanic maid.  Anyway, I enjoyed parts of this film, but there were too many times I was bored or found the jokes falling flat.  I hope there are no plans to produce a Fockers 3.",1103673600,,1553,4.4787234042553195
1564738,4,B00005JN5T,"I am not a big fan of ""Meet the Parents.""  I wasn't looking foward to a sequel until I heard the casting of Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand.  I knew that these two additions would be a happy addition to the mix and compliment the rest of the cast.

The sequel itself is funnier and fresher for some reason.  Its not just a one joke movie, it's more developed.  Hoffman and Streisand are fabulous.  Babs has never been funnier, and I wouldn't be suprised if she gets an oscar nomination.  Hoffman is equally great.  The real scene stealer is a baby.  He steals EVERY scene he's in.  Also the pets steal one scene.  Lotsa laughs abound in this movie.  It is one of the best comedies of the year, and I was pleasantly suprised of how good it was.",1103673600,4,747,4.294964028776978

1564928,5,B00005JN5T,I actually enjoy the sequel better than the original. I really enjoy Barbra Streisand's quirky character -- I hope I have a friend or mother in law like that one day. I also like the setting better. It mostly takes place in the Focker's household -- which possesses a Bohemian vibe. #FeelGoodFilm,1492128000,,296,4.711538461538462

1564930,2,B00005JN5T,"This is maybe the best argument in the world for NOT doing a sequel. Although I know that Hollywood can't help itself. As amazingly funny as ""Meet the Parents"" was, this dismal follow up is amazingly not funny. I have to lay that at the feet of the script, I think. It is a great cast, but holy cow, what a waste of the great Dustin Hoffman and the equally great Barbara Streisand in some of the stupidest comedic roles I have ever seen in a film. I mean seriously, Streisand as a Sex Therapist? And Hoffman as a New Age-y Florida Keys livin' high-on-life something-or-other. Sheesh. Avoid at all costs.",1489968000,,603,4.441441441441442

1564997,2,B00005JN5T,"This was a movie I avoided at the theater. Didnt think it would be worth theater prices. I was right.

The gratuitous humor could have been better crafted. For example, how many times can Focker be used? For me probably one of the funniest scenes was in the bloopers. A rather simple minded scene and you can hear Dustin Hoffman jokingly exclaim I studied acting so I could do Shakespeare!

I must admit I have never been a great fan of Ben Stiller. I have seen a few of his movies and find there is a pattern. Angry Ben, lecture Ben and put down Ben.  It happens in this film.

I watched the extended version. It didn't help the film.

I do like De Niro, Hoffman and Streisand but I wonder if they did this film for contractual reasons or simply a paycheck?

I doubt I will watch this film again and I have no interest to see the others.

If you never have seen ""Meet the Parents,"" than you may feel like you've walked in to the tail end of a joke.  Most of the movie was a take off of ""Meet the Parents,"" instead of being original.  It is funny, but after ten minutes of watching I began recognizing take-offs of lines and scenes from the original movie.  I really enjoyed ""Meet the Parents,"" and continue to watch it occasionally, but I didn't find this quite as funny even though I knew it was a sequel.

This one was OK, but it seemed just like more of ""Meet the Parents.""  Many of the stunts were similar.  So unless you're really a big fan of Ben Stiller, skip this one.  I also liked ""There's Something About Mary"" (1998) and ""Tower Heist"" (2011) with Stiller.",1473206400,,435,4.443037974683544

I wish that more actors as they aged would relax and give performances like these did. I LOVED Dustin Hoffman as Ben Stiller's dad, even if he only had one testicle....Barbara Streisand as the sex therapist for elderly couples seemed so WITH IT....Robert DeNiro as--what--how can you describe his obsession on SECURITY....and bless sweet Blythe Danner's heart for still having an interest in sex with DeNiro? Wow.....the problems of getting the young couple married is almost a Keystone Cops comedy routine.

1565302,2,B00005JN5T,"While this sequel has its moments, its tone (and, hence, its audience) is too different from the original to properly appeal to fans of the original, in my opinion. While the original (and Little Fockers) had a lot of variety to its humor, Meet the Fockers relies too heavily on sex as a source of humor, with many such scenes just being too over-the-top. The rest of the humor centers around unfunny interactions with Jack's grandson that reek of the sort of soul-draining tedium that Full House subjected viewers to with its youngest child actors. I'd skip this one if you're pleased with only watching the first movie, although I do feel that anyone who's interested in eventually watching Little Fockers should see this movie for the sake of completion. There is *some* level of continuity going on that I feel warrants seeing all three movies.",1441843200,,848,4.815068493150685

Too bad that there will be tension in the when his future in-laws and his parents get together in the sequel of Meet The Parents. Things did not go as planned as when Byrnes meet the Fockers - Bernie and Roz - as both families are culturally mismatched and have different perspective and views about life. In the end,both Greg and Pam try their best to put their families at peace and everything back to order before things get worse.
This movie was good enough to be entertaining. Its stellar cast - DeNiro,Stiller,Hoffman and Streisand - did their best to make it appealing and entertaining.

Ben Stiller is an RN, and married to a wonderful woman, who is pregnant with their first child. Ben Stiller plans to take a trip to visit his parents, where the in-laws get a chance to bond. His parents are Barbara Streisand and Dustin Hoffman, and his wife's father is Robert De Niro. The in-laws do not hit it off, especially the first few hours of their get-together.

Robert De Niro plays the role of an over-protective father, and puts Ben Stiller on an unforgettable visit to hell, as he questions his future son-in-laws past, and present life.

Barbara Streisand and Dustin Hoffman are both hilarious, and light up the entire movie. There are moments of pure laugh-out-loud fun, and entertainment. Overall, enjoyable, and very funny. Highly recommended!",1408492800,,865,4.837837837837838

1565765,2,B00005JN5T,"MEET THE FOCKERS is a family comedy in which two ill-matched couples meet over a weekend, argue and fight with each other, and then agree in the end to sanction the wedding of their children.  A familiar plot, allowing plenty of opportunity for comic situations with a soupcon of sentiment.  What is perhaps most remarkable about this film is the not only talent assembled - Robert de Niro, Barbra Streisand, Dustin Hoffman, Ben Stiller and Blythe Danner - but how director Jay Roach manages to waste it throughout the film's over-stretched 155-minute running time.  Yes, it might be fun to watch de Niro hamming it up as a retired CIA officer with an obsession for surveillance; or witness Hoffman overact fearfully as a middle-aged man pretending to be young; or look at Stiller trying and failing to keep the two families on an even keel.  But when the film ends up trying to get laughs out of a libidinous chihuahua chasing an aggressive cat, we sense the desperation running through it.  The best part about it comes right at the end, when Owen Wilson turns in a cameo as Kevin Rawley, charged with the responsibility of marrying the (un)lucky couple; through eye-work alone he manages to raise more laughs than in the previous 110 or so minutes.",1390780800,,1251,4.746543778801843

I couldn't believe Robert DeNiro did this movie.  He must have been bored at the time.  I'm not a Ben Stiller fan, so his presence meant nothing.  And Streisand...what was she doing in this?  I thought the humor in this movie was stupid.  I'll put it this way - it's not my kind of humor.  It thought the movie was total trash.

Andrew's Blu-ray Review: MEET THE FOCKERS is a mild comedy with Ben Stiller and Robert De Niro, and was a surprise box office sensation when it was released in 2000, leading subsequently to preparations for a sequel, which was thought would never materialised. The sequel wasn't released until 4 years later, with the ingenious premise that, instead of focusing on Teri Polo's parents from the first film Jack Tiberius Byrnes [Robert De Niro] and Dina Byrnes [Blythe Danner], we'd visit Ben Stiller's parents, hence the title: 'Meet the Fockers.' Admittedly casting of Barbara Streisand and Dustin Hoffman as Ben Stiller's hippie dippy parents was a stroke of genius. But the association of ""genius"" and MEET THE FOCKERS begins and ends there. I never saw it at the cinema, but I am glad I waited for this Blu-ray release.

The basic premise of the sequel is that Gaylord ""Greg"" Focker [Ben Stiller] is travelling with his soon-to-be-wife Teri Polo and her parents Jack Tiberius Byrnes [Robert De Niro] and Dina Byrnes [Blythe Danner] on their RV road trip to visit his parents. If you'll remember from the first film, Robert De Niro is a hard-nosed former CIA Agent, so there's a lot of stuff that involves him being uptight, hilarious, I know. The cat from the original film, Jinx, is also on-board the RV (for some unknown reason). Harkening back to the earlier film, the cat can flush the toilet. So if you're wondering if Dustin Hoffman's pint-sized Chihuahua will have a run-in with the cat, wherein the cat flushes the dog down the toilet, well, and my friends you are in for a real treat.

I was struck this time around by how weird it is that Ben Stiller was supposedly brought up by these incredibly sexually liberated parents, yet he himself is a total uptight dweeb [who I personally am not a great fan of this actor]. Also what's really crazy is that a lot of this second film concerns itself with a young child, in this case Ben Stiller and Teri Polo's nephew, who again is part of this road trip for reasons I can't entirely understand. So you have Robert De Niro and his wife reacting to the outrageous exploits of Barbra Streisand and Dustin Hoffman; you have everyone reacting to a baby, and the baby reacting to everyone else; and you have a cat flushing a dog down a toilet, hilarious? One of the weirder subplots in the film is Robert De Niro becoming suspicious of Ben Stiller has illegitimately fathered a child a number of years ago. First off, who really cares? Secondly, it's just lazy plotting and it's the kind of broad silliness that the film often falls down on, but it doesn't make it any less annoying or trite.

Especially funny is Barbra Streisand assaulting Robert De Niro with an erotic massage and she also has great chemistry with a delightfully impish Dustin Hoffman. Sadly the writers don't fully exploit the clash between Dustin Hoffman's ageing hippy and Robert De Niro's government spook as the awkwardness between Jack Tiberius Byrnes and Gaylord ""Greg"" Focker remains the heart of the story.

On the downside Ben Stiller's onscreen fiance Teri Polo is given nothing to do except balk in the appropriate places and the major set-ups also feel a little too familiar. Among these are the customary blocked toilet gag and a re-tread of the polygraph scene from Meet The Parents, but this time Jack Tiberius Byrnes injects Gaylord ""Greg"" Focker with truth serum. Although not as disarmingly funny the second time around, inspired casting means that, unlike most in-laws, the Fockers don't outstay their welcome.

But surprisingly this film ended up making more than $500 million worldwide, with yet another sequel released at the end of 2010. If you made the silly mistake of seeing the first film, then MEET THE FOCKERS is a total vast improvement, as `Meet the Parents' was totally rubbish and was so totally unfunny, on top of all that how the hell was it a big hit, especially with the terrible Ben Stiller in it and they call him an actor, what a joke.

Blu-ray Video Quality  MEET THE FOCKERS has a 1080p encoded image, with a 1.85:1 aspect ratio. The best thing about this image is the astoundingly vivid and gorgeously saturated colours. Dustin Hoffman's bright red shirt is a wonder to behold, and it never radiates into blooming territory. The Florida landscape locales that look very lush, with wonderful turquoises, and the kaleidoscope of party umbrellas during the closing wedding scene are also quite beautiful. But, oh, what edge enhancement and other artefacts, especially when Jack holds up the little graphic signs for Little Jack's edification, ugly white halos surround the black lines. There's rampant edge enhancement throughout the film, and over and over we get a lot of shimmer on things like Robert De Niro's salt and pepper hair, as well as moir and aliasing on things like Jack's blue pin striped sport coat. If you can get past that (and it's frankly not always easy to do so), this Blu-ray sports a nicely sharp image with good fine detail, decent grain structure, excellent depth of field, and very good contrast. But it's the colours that will probably linger in memory as being the best thing about this transfer.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  As in the mindless vacuous MEET THE FOCKERS, we are given a perfectly serviceable 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio mix that simply doesn't have a lot of opportunity to strut its stuff. There's certainly decent enough surround activity, within the confines of a dialogue driven comedy, but it's limited to things like the roar of an RV panning through the sound field, or party noises at a nightclub. Otherwise, we have excellent fidelity during the talking scenes, with everything crystal clear and easy to hear, anchored solidly in the front channels. It's hard to get very worked up about a sound mix like this, but there's certainly nothing wrong in any way with this DTS track. It does its job absolutely professionally, with no problems to report.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Audio Commentary: Commentary with Director Jay Roach and Editor/Co-Producer Jon Poll: Like 'Meet the Parents,' this features commentary with director Jay Roach, who previously helmed 'Parents' and the three 'Austin Powers' features, and his editor and co-producer Jon Poll. Unlike the 'Meet the Parents' disc, this doesn't have a livelier and extremely weird commentary with the cast; this track is mostly technically oriented and will please only hardened fans of the franchise (are there hardened fans of the franchise?)

Special Feature: Bloopers [1080p] [11:03] Sometimes bloopers can cause caustic intolerance of endless bloopers, but I will have to admit that in this never-ending string of bloopers, screw-ups, and flubbed lines, there are some amusing moments mostly with Robert De Niro, which if it had been not included, would not be any loss.

Deleted Scenes [1080p] [15:45] I know it's shocking that a film that feels like a loose selection of deleted scenes from the first film should have its own cache of deleted scenes but, hey, it does. There is some mildly diverting stuff in here but it's mostly pretty lame. You can very easily skip this without any worries.

Special Feature: Inside The Litter Box: Behind-the-Scenes with Jinx The Cat [1080p] [4:02] Apparently a feature on the 'Meet the Parents' disc about the damn cat wasn't enough. There is still at least four minutes of new material to explore with the cat that flushes the dog down the toilet. I suggest you skip this.

Special Feature: The Manary Gland [1080p] [3:05] Oh yeah! I cannot believe they included this totally crass silly item. SKIP this if you feel you might be offended and will be no loss if you do NOT view this item.

Special Feature: Fockers' Family Portrait [1080p] [5:59] Split into separate brief chapters on Gaylord ""Greg"" Focker, Rosalind ""Roz"" Focker and Bernard ""Bernie"" Focker, offering the actors talking about their characters. Ben Stiller, Barbra Streisand, and Dustin Hoffman talk about bringing the Focker family to fully formed life. This is flimsy stuff and can easily be avoided.

Special Feature: The Adventures of a Baby Wrangler [1080p] [5:32] This is a brief documentary about the two young children that play the baby in the movie named Little Jack. I know, it sounds terribly exciting. Thankfully, it's over in less than 6 minutes.

Special Feature: Matt Lauer Meets The Fockers [2004] [7:57] Here we have a fun interview segment with the cast. It's called synergy, people! It's one of the biggest constellations of stars you'll see all year and one of the biggest surprises on the screen: three of Hollywood's most honoured dramatic icons doing anything for a laugh. Barbra Streisand, Dustin Hoffman and Robert De Niro. They're the nuts and bolts of the screwball comedy Meet the Fockers, the film from NBC's parent company NBC Universal, that's a follow-up to the hit Meet the Parents. The films a sequel, but the conversation is a first. NBCs Matt Lauer sat down with the entire cast for their only television interview together. And it was quickly clear that this comedy is all about chemistry. They talk about your raucous reunions, this is the first time this cast has gotten together as a group since filming, and there's no director here to yell cut. There's a lot of Hollywood clout sitting on these couches. Among this group, you can count 18 Academy Award nominations, six Oscars, and billions of dollars in box office. Matt Lauer brought them all back to the Focker family living room where these two film clans first meet and they actually brought them set to them. ""Meet the Fockers"" is the sequel to the hugely successful Meet the Parents, which first followed the struggles of Ben Stiller's character, Gaylord Greg Focker, as he  desperately tries to win over his fiances by-the-book dad, Jack Tiberius Byrnes, as played by Robert De Niro. The film ends with one thought left hanging in the air and that the two sets of parents have to meet.

Finally, MEET THE FOCKERS like many of the actors in the cast, who are slightly old and tired. It's a warmed over re-tread of the ""hey, let's make people squirm"" formula that inexplicably made the first movie a box office smash. To most critics, they felt at times things were not that funny, but I must be a very rare find, as I thought it was quite funny in places, so even if you might feel you are not a fan of the film, I would still recommend this Blu-ray disc, especially if you are a fan of either Barbra Streisand or Dustin Hoffman. The video transfer not that pristine, especially for a Blu-ray disc, the audio mix is workmanlike at best, and the special features have already been exhibited on the previous DVD release. Still despite this, I really liked this film and I am glad it is in my Barbra Streisand Blu-ray Collection, but as to whether you are keen to purchase MEET THE FOCKERS then maybe you should hire it out first, but for me personally, I am glad now I own this Blu-ray Disc. Highly Recommended!

1565938,2,B00005JN5T,"Sequels are not usually that great. This one is no exception. The main gist of the movie is that, following ""Meet the Parents"", Pam and her parents go to Gaylord's house to meet his parents. While Pam's parents may have been more traditional and strict, Gaylord's are liberal, loose, and fun-loving people, and those differences cause obvious clashes during the movie. Also not surprisingly, Pam's father still has some doubts about his future son-in-law being man enough to take care of his little princess.

There is some comic element to this movie, and I guess I would have to admit that there is a little thought in the plot, when the couple gets a little surprise in the middle of the story. And if you're into slapstick comedy with the usual cliched situations, you may just find this entertaining. For myself, it was hardly worth watching once, but never again.

It's an easy-to-forget movie and I forgot and watched it again. Unfortunately. ""Meet the (Sorry, mentioning the name gets my review dropped)"" would seem to have a lot going for it. The cast consists of mega-stars. The production values are high. The music is by Randy Newman. This thing should be a smashing success. Well, perhaps it was at the boxoffice, but as a home movie it's one of the lamest comedies I've watched in the last decade.

The story involve a man and his fiancee, together with her parents, as they go together to meet his parents in a trip by motorhome. The man's last name is unfortunate hence they go to meet the parents and relatives as the name of the movie says. Get it?  Well, believe me, as a comedy it's all downhill from here. The basis problem is, of course, it just isn't funny. The name grows wearisome after the second use, and wait, there's another 50 times or so. Those with a middle-school- level humor will get a lot of laughs. Using the name in this review has gotten me in censor problems twice so far in submitting this review and I don't consider it a bit funny, the name or the censorship. Anyway, I guess other people do, at least the name. The supposed jokes among the two families and their meetings are embarrassing, not funny. None of the acting generates a feeling of fun and belonging. Even the pets aren't funny, although they come the closest. I sat in disbelief as this non-funny comedy slowly unfolded. It seemed overly long and I thought it would never end. Well, what can I say? I suppose in every great star's list of movies, there's a few turkeys and this is one of them for quite a few people. Hoffman and Streisand, in particular, must be embarrassed to be credited with this bomb.

What spoils everything is, that Greg doesn't know his own parents and acts with surprise to everything they do. Boring. Many of the 'funny' scenes are highly predictable (boring again) or not funny at all. Like showing a middle finger to a one-year old could be funny? Anyway, the baby character could easily be excluded from the film. And the worst character? Definitively Owen Wilson. The audience at the theater went silent at his arrival on the scene.

Teri Polo has a role that is just a watcher of course.
Now, I am NOT a fan of Ben Stiller.  He does his usual routine in this role as he did in the 1st & in ""There's Something About Mary"".  Same lying, put out then blows his top role.  Wish they could have gotten a better actor for the role.
And, we MOST DEFINITELY could have done WITHOUT Owen Wilson in both films.

As for the DVD, it is a good package.  I like extras  & this one has the kind I like.  Deleted scenes, bloopers, etc.

1566035,3,B00005JN5T,"It shouldn't be too big a surprise that this movie is a fairly mediocre Hollywood confection, but I did have a whimper of a hope that this was going to be an edgier social commentary given the comedy potential of the situation. Alas, it would be too much to expect director Jay Roach to be in the same league as David O. Russell or Alexander Payne given that his track record is mostly made up of Austin Powers movies. I never saw the original&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Meet-the-Parents/dp/B00003CXO1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Meet the Parents</a>, so luckily I don't have that point of comparison, but one can easily fill in the blanks with this soft-centered sequel. Written by Jim Herzfeld and John Hamburg, the plot seems ready-made from an instant pudding mix. Having given permission to Gaylord Focker to marry their daughter Pam, the white-bread Byrnes family from Oyster Bay now prepares to meet their new in-laws in Florida (of course).

Simple enough, but the big surprise is that Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand (third and fourth-billed, no less) seem to be having such a great time playing Bernie and Roz Focker that you can almost overlook the script deficiencies. Each had auspicious film debuts over 35 years ago (he in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Graduate/dp/B00000F798/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Graduate</a>, she in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Funny-Girl/dp/B00005O3VD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Funny Girl</a>), and they have known each other since their struggling New York days in the early sixties. That history is helpful in explaining their natural chemistry here, and you're left wondering why these two never worked together before. Streisand, in particular, seems relaxed as a free-wheeling, caftan-wearing, opinionated sex therapist, which seems like a send-up of her self-important psychiatrist in her own&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Prince-of-Tides/dp/B00005OLYF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Prince of Tides</a>. For once, she's not bathed in candlelight in some Harlequin romance with a blonde gentile unable to commit. Rather, she lends credibility to a grounded character in an often hilariously passionate marriage to a physical and intellectual equal, and at certain moments in this film, I don't think I've liked Streisand more onscreen.

If Hoffman seems less surprising, it's only because he has already proven to be a masterful comic actor with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tootsie/dp/B000ZM1MG4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tootsie</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wag-the-Dog/dp/0780622561/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wag the Dog</a>. Even when the running gags (a passion for capoeira, overzealous displays of affection) get tired, he still imbues his caricature with a zestful spirit. The remaining elements of the film seem tired in comparison, and unfortunately I have to include the original stars. Perhaps it's because they are recycling behavior that would be hard to refresh a second time. Robert DeNiro's tiresome portrayal of Jack Byrnes, the intimidating ex-CIA spook, is particularly disappointing and not so much because the actor is slumming (which he is) but because his character works on only one motivation, to humiliate and eventually eject his future son-in-law from the ""circle of trust"". There are hints that the summit meeting of Hoffman, DeNiro and Streisand would turn into something more substantial, but the sitcom dimensions of the script quickly extinguish the possibilities. Ben Stiller, who is the actual protagonist of this comedy, seems to be sitting back as his character, Gaylord, recedes into the background. He has exactly one funny scene on his own, when he spouts his honest feelings after being injected with a ""truth serum"".

The whole subplot with Gaylord being accused of fathering his former family housekeeper's son seems tired and superfluous. I like Blythe Danner as Jack's wife, Dina, looking to resuscitate some spark in their marriage, and Teri Polo, who actually seems sharp and worthwhile as the fiance at the center of the story. But neither is given much to do except a funny scene where Roz uses hand puppets to teach Dina how to get sex out of Jack. If seeing DeNiro wearing a homemade rubber ""manary gland"" sounds hilarious, by all means go see this movie. For me, it just made me think how it would be great to see Hoffman and Streisand re-team in a James Brooks comedy, how DeNiro should go back to Scorsese for career guidance and how Stiller may want to take a break before he plays yet another nebbish character. By the way, I'm guessing Streisand's ""A Star Is Born""-era hairdo is an in-joke to her partner since her character's name was Esther Hoffman. Now that's the kind of subtlety this comedy needed.

The 2005 DVD features two versions of the film - the theatrical cut and a completely unnecessary extended cut, which edits in several deleted scenes. Like the DVD treatment for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ray/dp/B00005JND5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ray</a>, the additions are announced to the viewer through a blinking gimmick and consequently inhibit the flow of the narrative. It's better to see these understandably excised scenes separate from the film. Roach and editor/co-producer Jon Poll provide a so-so commentary track, and there is also a fitfully funny blooper reel. Several disposable shorts are included, among them ""Fockers' Family Portrait"" featuring brief snippets from Hoffman, Streisand and Stiller; a behind-the-scenes look at Jinx the Cat (""Inside the Litter Box""); another behind-the-scenes look, this time at the infant (""The Adventures of a Baby Wrangler""); a five-minute featurette on ""The Manary Gland""; and a Today Show interview with the entire cast.",1207699200,8,6043,5.998841251448436
1566036,3,B00005JN5T,Meet the Fockers is ok. Standard jokes and humor. Good plot line but it tend to drag on sometimes. The baby sort of saved the movie at certain places.,1204675200,,150,4.206896551724138
1566037,3,B00005JN5T,"I will admit that `Meet the Fockers' is funny; in fact it's really funny.  If I were judging this film of pure comedic effect alone I'd have to say that this truly nails it.  You see, it's not a question of landing jokes and gags here for each and every one lands fine, it's just that sadly this film is nothing new.  `Meet the Fockers' is more like `Meet the Parents' rehash with a few new faces.  Taking as its own film it's genuine and hilarious yet when taken alongside its superior predecessor it can prove disappointing.  If only the script had been as ingeniously constructed as `Meet the Parents'.

This film picks up right where `Meet the Parents' left off.  This time it's more a game of meet the in-laws as the Byrnes family travels to meet Greg's parents.  Greg's parents are obviously complete opposites of Pam's.  Bernie and Rozalin are loud and obnoxious and, for lack of a better word, `loony'.  They love their son regardless of his flaws and failures, in fact they celebrate everything he's ever done, which is not something that sits well with Jack.  Add to this the fact that Pam and Greg have a big secret that threatens to dismantle her father and you have all the makings of a very tense visit.

My issues with `Meet the Fockers' lie solely in the script.  The decision to revisit Jack's untrusting paranoia was frustrating to me.  By the end of `Meet the Parents' we feel that maybe finally Greg has broken into Jack's ridiculousness and that they are going to move forward in their relationship.  Having Jack resort back to his scheming and manipulating and deceiving all over again seemed kind of forced and repetitive.  The clash between the Byrnes and the Fockers was funny and Hoffman and De Niro play off one another well, but Jack's character is not as enjoyable the second time around.  There is no real character development.  It's like the writers said `hey, this worked last time so lets do it all over again'.

The cast all works well, everyone returning as well as the new faces.  This film belongs to Barbara Streisand and Dustin Hoffman.  I can't think of two actors better suited for the roles.  They are hysterical and add layers of genuine sincerity to the roles, much like what De Niro did for Jack Byrnes in `Meet the Parents'.  Teri Polo has more to do this go around, but she still a backseat to the more memorable performers, Blythe Danner being one of them.

I enjoyed this film and I think if you watch it as just another comedy then you will too.  The jokes land one right after the other beautifully.  Like I said, it's that pesky problem of remaining stagnant that hits this one.  There is no progression of comedic entertainment here.  `Meet the Fockers' is `Meet the Parents Part II' and that said it's bound to be funny.  Sometimes that's good enough.",1204243200,,2806,4.567134268537074
1566038,4,B00005JN5T,"Meet the Parents is one of those Ben Stiller vehicles that's so slapstick in its hilarity that it can actually make you feel uncomfortable.  It's funny, but it's almost disturbingly funny, such that if you make the mistake of imagining yourself in Greg ""Gaylord"" Focker's (Ben Stiller) shoes, you want to hide under your seat.

Meet the Fockers takes the conceit of the original movie one step further.  Greg's already met his fiance's (Pam Byrnes, played by Teri Polo) family, including Pam's pleasant mother Dina (Blythe Danner), her nephew Jack (Spencer and Bradley Pickren), and her domineering father Jack (Robert De Niro).  It's now time for that momentous meeting that all engaged couples dread: the family meeting. It's time, finally, to meet the parents who named their son Gaylord Focker.

Thus begins a road trip down to Florida to meet Greg's parents, played hippie pitch-perfect by Barbara Streisand as Rozalin (a special kind of therapist for older couples who want to be more intimate) and Dustin Hoffman as Bernie, the over-supportive, super-pal of a dad.  Mix the Byrnes with the Fockers and stir.

The additional twist is Little Jack, representing a flashpoint of parenting debate.  Jack's childrearing is strict and disciplinarian one hand (the Byrnes hand, if you couldn't guess) and the free-love, do-it-if-it-feels-good empowerment of the Fockers.

Streisand and Hoffman are the real treat here. Their parental struggles and angst, or lack thereof, are what make the film. If you're a fan of either, you won't be disappointed.

If you are recently married or have a kid, the movie's struggle over childrearing is a very funny debate indeed. If you don't, then Meet the Fockers is probably only mildly amusing.  Since my son was born the same month I saw his movie, it had particular comedic resonance, and my parents (who are definitely Focker-types) and my wife laughed all the way through.",1189900800,,1913,5.079872204472843

I will say this one was good and did what good sequels do. It takes advantage of character development to get to more jokes. I think you could probably enjoy the movie even if you hadn't seen the first, but I think it helps to understand a bit about the relationship between Jack and Gaylord.
The basic premise of the movie is that Pam's family has to meet Greg's family. Jack, being straight laced and stoic as he is, isn't ready for the affectionate Focker family. The family seems to be getting along well until Jack shoots Gaylord with Sodium Pentathol, truth serum, and he reveals a lot of things during speech. Things get tumultuous. The thing I like best, and this is kind of a spoiler, is how dedicated Pam is to Gaylord throughout the movie and she stay dedicated and in love throughout. She doesn't act particularly well, I thought, but it was touching.

As if the chemistry between Robert DeNiro, the father in law of Greg Focker, played by Ben Stiller, a male nurse that married the woman of his dreams, played by Teri Polo was not enough to make a classic comedy... Bernie and Roz Focker join this winning team!

Meet the Fockers is a superb sequel to Meet the Parents. Now, it is the turn for the bride's parents, Jack and Dina Byrnes, played by De Niro and Blythe Danner, to meet the groom's parents.

With Gaylord and Pam, they travel in their new RV to Florida. They also bring with them their infant grandson from their other daughter, and the kid delivers some of the best lines of this film... Still to today... when we want to laugh, we find ourselves saying.... Ash-whole!!!

Gaylord's parents, Bernie and Roz Focker, played by Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand are simply magnificent. As with great comedy, they play opposites to DeNiro, and rather than strict and controlling, they are care-free, touchy-feely... fun-loving parents.

I am not a big fan of sequels, toilet humor, little dogs humping everything that moves, overdone baby jokes, ""Fockered"" jokes, and Ben Stiller. Barbra Streisand is not on my list of the favorite actors, either. But I saw ""Meet the Fockers"", I laughed out loud, I liked it a lot and I may see it again on DVD. Dustin Hoffman was hilarious - wild and crazy; together with Streisand they made a great team. Streisand was very funny as a Jewish Mama (I am dying to say Mother Focker - but it's been said hundreds times already. Well, I did say that :)) - Sex Therapist for octogenarians. They were the best things about the movie, and it was enough for me to spend very nice two hours (my husband and my son enjoyed it, too.

1566055,4,B00005JN5T,"Okay, first i would like to say to all of you who are giving it one time for it's ""potty"" humor....don't be idiots..please.

You are giving an above average comedy a bad review, because you wern't intelligent enough to know what you were getting yourself into when you decided to watch this movie. The reasoning behind my statement? The movie is titled ""Meet the Fockers"".  What in God's name did you think you were going to see?

Anyways, this movie is pretty funny. In no way do they try to portray greg's parents as ""hip"" or cool to anyone. They portray them as people who arn't afraid to be themselves. Is there a problem with that? I think not. I'm guessing that to you people who use that as an excuse to give this film such a bad rating, are people who are anti-social. Or are so concerned with what ""cool"" is...you take every instance in which someone acts a bit differently, and immediately assume it's an attempt to be cool.

Yes, this movie is slapstick, yes it is painful to watch at times. But that's because you see the main characters setting themselves up for trouble later. However, the acting and script handle it beautifully. I just watched the movie the illusionist. I knew what would happen at the end half way through the movie, however, the way everything ties together is what made it such a great film.

Basically, this movie is a 3 and a half- 4 star film. Funny, but not brilliantly clever.

and to the guy who is nay-saying this film, talking about what retired cia folks can or can't afford.

are you serious? it's a comedy. A movie. They are not going into the film saying, okay, how can we make this movie as realistic as possible. Let's make sure every detail is completely precise, so people walk away from this movie not saying wow, that was a good laugh. But, wow, that movie sure was accurate.

Not to mention the fact that, if you knew anything about politics. I'm sure you would know about all the financial scams government officials pull. So unless you worked for the cia. You are not the person to question what is they can or can't afford.

TO EVERYONE WHO READS THESE NEGATIVE REVIEWS. REMEMBER. KNOW WHAT YOU'RE WATCHING...AND DON'T LET THESE PEOPLE WHO REALLY HAVE NO LEGITIMATE ARGUMENT ABOUT WHY THIS FILM IS BAD, STEER YOU AWAY.",1167782400,,2276,4.53170731707317
1566056,4,B00005JN5T,"Reuniting the same cast from `Meet the Parents' and brilliantly adding Dustin Hoffman and Barbara Streisand to the mix as Greg's parents Bernie and Roz Focker, `Meet the Fockers' is saved from ruination.  Yes, as many have already mentioned, the plot truly follows the first film.  Jack (De Niro) is still weary of Greg (Stiller) and is trying to convince his daughter Pam (Polo) to steer clear of marrying him.  But this time around Greg has moral support in the form of his parents.

As the complete opposites to Jack, both Roz and Bernie are loving parents who smother Greg with commendation and praise while Jack is quick to tear him down.  Dustin Hoffman steals the show from Robert De Niro this time, but De Niro still delivers none-the-less.  Streisand is fantastic as Roz and Blythe is still hilarious in her naivety.  Sadly, even with a sequel, Teri Polo fails to rise above the background.  Her character may not be as developed as the others but she still could have elevated her performance.  I read the other day that Naomi Watts lost this role to Teri Polo, and all I kept thinking was that after seeing what Naomi was able to do with her character in `I Heart Huckabees' that she would have been a much better choice for this film.

Oh well, no use in complaining now.  So, it's not as original, but with De Niro still on board and Hoffman and Streisand recruited `Meet the Fockers' is still an enjoyable and hilarious ride...plus you get to see Robert De Niro breast feed a baby and that alone is priceless!",1166486400,,1523,4.583025830258302

1566114,1,B00005JN5T,"Like other reviewers, I found MeetThe Parents mildly amusing and this sequel was in the 3 for $25 bin at Hollywood so I figured ""Why not?""

Well here's why not. It presents the main character's parents as crude, clueless buffoons, and having no social judgement whatsoever, but it seems the writers want the audience to think of them as cool and hip. And for some odd reason they live in a house that resembles the castle on Fantasy Island. I'm surprised they didn't include a sex with a midget scene. Nobody would want their daughter to marry into this family let alone a right wing former CIA agent, who was set up as an object of ridicule. Oh, and they had to be Jewish too. Streisand and Hoffman should be ashamed of themselves portraying their own people in such an unflattering way. {""Our people don't shoot ducks, dear"")

Do former CIA agents make enough money to live in mansions and buy a custom built RV that would cost at least $250 k? The toilet humor and profanity wouldn't have made it into ""Dumb and Dumber""

1566118,4,B00005JN5T,"This is an enjoyable sequel to Meet the Parents that suffers the same fate as many sequels (especially comedies)- it's just not quite as good as the original.

In the first film we meet the bride-to-be's parents, played by Robert DeNiro and Blythe Danner. It's only natural that the sequel introduces us to the parents of the groom (Ben Stiller), played by the perfectly cast Barbra Streisand and Dustin Hoffman.

I'm not a big fan of Streisand's film work, but this is a wonderful ""comeback"" role for her. She is so good as Mrs. Focker that at times I forgot I was seeing Streisand the star on screen. Hoffman is great as her husband, too.

The movie is worth a look just to see DeNiro, Hoffman, and Streisand on screen together. DeNiro's character is an uptight former (?) CIA agent, while his future in-laws could be described as new age or hippies, depending on your age... certainly the opposite, which is the source of much of the comedy. I'm pretty sure this is the only movie with all 3 of them, and the only one Hoffman and Streisand have done together.

Although this film stands on its own as a story, I still suggest seeing Meet the Parents first for those who have not done so.",1145145600,,1190,4.49537037037037
1566119,3,B00005JN5T,"Dragooned into watching this one, what a mistake!  Although, I do agree with others that the casting of Hoffman and Streisand is out of this world.  They couldn't have been better, though whoever did Streisand's makeup should be taken out to the Everglades and shot like a croc.  But the same catasrtophe happens to youngish Teri Polo in this film.  In the first one, she looked pretty, in this one, she looks harsh and garish, older than Blythe Danner.  It's like they hate her.

It must have been madness on the set as for decades people have been saying that Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand were the most demanding and difficult stars in Hollywood.  Has time mellowed them, or have they finally woken up and smelled the coffee, that their careers have pretty much ended as stars, sure Barbra can still sing, but for the rest, are either of them ever going to get as simpatico a hand-made part as the script of MEET THE FOCKERS gives them?  As Bernie and Roz Focker, they shine.  Everyone's good, but the movie itself just sits there, nothing happens and nobody really cares.  Ben Stiller gets himself in one embarrassing situation after another, but the actor has played this role so many times before we don't even feel for him any longer.

I liked that the Fockers cherished their son so much, never made him feel inadequate, smothered him with kisses, framed his jock and his 9th place bowling ribbons and trophies.  In their eyes he's the best male nurse in the world.

De Niro's CIA thing continues to be creepy.  For the next Focker picture I'd like Hay Roach to step down and somebody like Ken Loach or George Clooney take over the directors chair and show De Niro's character invading and decimating Ghana or Ecuador or somewhere.

1566121,3,B00005JN5T,"So as I left the theater I was thinking, how funny you think this film is depends a lot on how old you are, and who you are, and who you identify with in the stratified society.  If you are a couple of New Aging hippies nostalgic for the summer of love and your lost libido, you gotta love it.  But if you are Oliver North or Dick Cheney, welding loose cannons or loose nukes--whatever--this has got to be some kind of insult to American manhood.

Anyway, there was this carnival guy in the lobby with a pink top hat and a big red nose and a microphone getting comments--for publicity I guess.  ""DID YA MEET THE FOCKERS? he says, eyes wide.  Most people ignore him but some guy in a NASCAR baseball cap says:

""Yeah, I met 'em and the Byrnes too.  I wasn't too impressed.  They're kinda gay and touchie-feelie.  So fock off, would you?""

He and his bud crack up.

An older woman says in passing, ""Bobbie De Niro used to be such a fine actor.  And so handsome.  Now look what they've done to him.  Oy ve!  But Bah-bra.  Wasn't she divine!  She is sooo good at comedy.  So funny, so natural.""

""Perfect casting,"" her friend says.

One teenaged boy says, ""Yeah, dude, just like Frankie's parents.  You know Frankie Rigotelli...I mean crack me up like wow it was so, so identical, I mean identical.  Dude, like when he f..in' kisses him on the neck like he wants blood or something.  I mean, dude, it was bogus.""

His buddy says, ""Teri Polo is hot.""

""Yeah, I'd like to--.""

Never mind.

A pregnant woman with her husband, beaming: ""We loved it. So funny and the little boy was just adorable, wasn't he, honey?""

""Adorable.""

An old guy in a World War II red hat with gold scrambled egg on the bill, snarls, ""No retired CIA operative would stand for that.  It's just not natural.  That's not the way he would act.  He'd, he'd...take control of the situation.  Dustin Hoffman's a p--y.  He can't knock Robert De Niro down.  That's as phony as a three-dollar bill.""

""'Meet the Parents' was better,"" a woman says to the guy she's with.

""Yeah, but the kid was adorable.""

""Adorable.""

So I thought, what did I think of the movie?  Well, you have two of the most outstanding actors of our time, De Niro and Dustin Hoffman in it (totally miscast, of course).  But they do a good job anyway.  You have a really fine performance by Barbra Steisand.  She is just perfect as a sex therapist for seniors.  Seems like she was born for the part.  And yes, Bradley Pickren as the boy whose first spoken word is ""a--hole"" is as cute as cute can be.  And what is more, they did a great job of getting all those expressions out of him on film and then splicing them in at exactly the right spot.

But I wonder if this is director Jay Roach's best work.  My laugh-o-meter says no.  I understand the prequel Meet the Parents (2000) which also starred De Niro and Ben Stiller (but no Dustin Hoffman or Barbra Steisand) was funnier, but I haven't seen it so I can't say.  I did see one of the Austin Powers movies that Roach directed and it was very funny.

A warning: some straight-laced types might find this movie a bit creepy.  After all, the Fockers are parents who have a trophy wall for their son showing off his ninth or tenth place ribbons for whatever along with his jock strap, framed.  On the other hand, I think young people might get some chuckles laughing at people who remind them of their parents.  And, for some aging hippies this might come off as a very warm movie.  There's a happy ending in which the uptight learn to loosen up a bit, and they did, as Barbra Streisand's character says, ""Fockerize"" De Niro's Jack Byrnes, who is a retired CIA agent.

So bottom line is chill out.  This is a comedy and if you don't feel Fockerized, well, then you can just--

Never mind.  But remember, ""If it's yellow, let it mellow, and if it's brown, flush it down.""",1141689600,,3851,4.357344632768362

1566154,4,B00005JN5T,"TWO-HOUR SITUATION COMEDY AT ITS FINEST!

This is a terrific modern comedy with a classic theme. Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand brought added chemistry and welcome diversity which really helped this character-driven sit-com. Whereas ""Meet The Parents"" had numerous funny ""gags"" and a lot of comedic tension, ""Meet The Fockers"" takes embarrassment to a new level for Greg Focker. Although this movie is 115 minutes long, there is hardly a dull moment. I have already viewed this DVD about 15 times.

Yes, the film does resort to some cliched, overused themes, some of which are a bit vulgar and may even be offensive to some viewers. However, the enormous credibility that the all-star cast brings, and delivers, to this sprawling situation comedy, more than makes up for the predictable silliness, and occasionally irksome crudeness that sometimes gets tiresome.

ABOUT THE DVD:

The sound and visual quality of this widescreen DVD is about what you would expect from a new big-budget release ... about perfect. It does contain quite a few features that I found interesting, but the extended version option was by the best of them. Although it does make the movie 150+ minutes, it adds some new insights into the characters and their motivations. One such extended scene depicts Greg with the father of the boy that Jack wrongfully believed was his Greg's son. Of course, Ben Stiller played the very odd, minor league baseball coach meeting Greg [himself]. Sure it's a cliche, but it was funny. There were also deleted scenes and bloopers. They were mostly okay, but some seemed contrived.

There are three behind-the-scenes featurettes: one about the baby wrangler's role (pretty interesting), another about the mammary gland prop, and the third was titled ""Inside the Litter Box"" and was of course about that darn cat, ""Mr. Jinx"". The featurettes are a little over the top as features go, but it is, after all, a comedy.

BOTTOM LINE: ENTERTAINING, BUT OFTEN AT THE EXPENSE OF GOOD TASTE!

Is ""MEET THE FOCKERS"" as entertaining as ""Meet the Parents""? I believe so, but unfortunately, in many instances, it is done so at the expense of good taste. After viewing the movie and all the features only one question remains in my mind (as well as in the mind of many others, I'm sure.) ... Will they all return in yet another sequel, ""MEET THE LITTLE FOCKER""?",1137110400,6,2360,4.9294710327455915
1566155,5,B00005JN5T,"I find it rare that a movie sequel is better than the originally.  However, that is just the case with ""Meet the Fockers"".  Maybe because I lived for five years in the Netherlands and knew people with the last name Focker, I am not shocked by the name, although I understand its comedic value.  The beauty of this film is that it is a true ensemble piece.  Three male/female pairs populate this nearly laugh-a-minute cinematic beauty -- the newly engaged couple and both their sets of parents.  We met her parents, the straightlaced, up-tight WASPS, in the original Meet the Parents.  When the original foursome team up to meet HIS parents, the eccentric Jewish ex-hippies, laughs abound.  Of particular beauty is the pairing of Hoffman and Streisand.  You would swear throughout the film that the pair were actually husband and wife who were still madly in love (and lust) with one another after all these years.  Sure there is bathroom humor, and silly bits, but it is all put together surrounded by such amazing acting talent and funny script, that the film is a winner from opening credits to close.  Buy this film, call in friends, and prepare to enjoy an evening of fun and belly laughs.  And, while you're at it, if you have a dog and/or cat, make sure they're in the TV room to enjoy the show too!",1136937600,,1305,4.606060606060606
1566156,3,B00005JN5T,"This predictable, corny sequel to Meet the Parents gave me a few hearty laughs when I saw it in the theater, but it seemed less funny when I rented it on DVD for my sister.

Some of the acting was great.  I'm a big fan of Ben Stiller's and he delivered his usual excellent performance.  The toddler was an absolute screen stealer -- can't imagine how that little guy learned to make faces, signs and laugh on cue.  However, De Niro, Streisand and Hoffman all seemed a little over the edge.

The main problem with this movie was the script.  There wasn't much to work with aside from obvious jokes about fornication and scatological humor.  Gay Fokker takes his fiance and her parents home to meet his eccentric parents before they tie the knot.  If the dialogue had been crisper and the scenes had been a little more realistic or believable, this could have been a good follow-up to Meet the Parents, which was extremely funny.

Instead, it ended up being a mediocre comedy.  Rent it if you loved Meet The Parents but be forewarned that it's not half as good.

1566157,5,B00005JN5T,I don't care what anyone else said this was a laugh out loud kind of movie.  Especially since I'm the daughter of a cop (and we tend to have strange senses of humor).  After talking with my staff at work too we all liked this one better than the first.,1136678400,,252,4.02

1566159,2,B00005JN5T,"Given the casting of Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand as Ben Stiller's parents, along with Robert DeNiro back as the hot-tempered Jack Byrnes, you'd think that ""Meet the Fockers"" would be a tremendously funny movie.

Alas, I was very disappointed.  The gags and dialogue don't work nearly as well as in the first film.  What kind of screenwriter would think that attaching a fake breast to Robert DeNiro, or having a toddler utter profanities, or giving Greg Focker an illegitimate son, would be funny to watch?

The running joke about Greg's last name ran pretty thin in the first film, and in this one, they run it into the ground.

It's a shame so many talented actors had to work with such a lame script.",1136419200,,711,4.656
1566160,4,B00005JN5T,"I was worried about the sequel to ""Meet the Parents"" thinking it might turn out to be rather boring and far less funny than the first part, like it often happens. But I was worrying in vain. ""Meet the Fockers"" lived up to its predecessor. Certainly the first part was more sophisticated and laughable, but we all know it's always difficult to keep the same level whatsoever. There's a lot of blunt humor here (like a scene with Greg's foreskin), but there's also many situational jokes that make this film just hilarious. And actually it's not the wisecracks themselves that matter, but the way they are delivered by Robert De Niro, Dustin Hoffman and Ben Stiller. I was laughing like mad throughout the whole movie, even when there seemed to be nothing to laugh at. But the way De Niro talks and makes faces can't leave you indifferent.

Screenwriters did a very good job, they wrote Greg's parents, who are played by Hoffman and Streisand, so vivid and thruthful, all I want to say is ""bravo!"". From the first moment we see them, it's obvious they are just so not like Pam's parents, and it's getting crystal clear there's gonna be trouble.

Dustin Hoffman is the greatest acquisition of the film. I know he had plenty of serious, world-known movies, but this part is truly one of his best.

The edition has interesting extras, and the principal one is a blooper-reel, which sometimes is even more funny than the movie itself.",1135641600,,1428,4.681274900398407

""Meet The Fockers"" is filled with repetitive, low-class humor, embarrassing to listen to with family.  The only redeeming part of the dvd are two documentaries:  Jinx the Cat (where true tongue in cheek humor emerges) and the Baby Wrangler.  Trust me, you do not want to Meet The Fockers.",1135296000,3,542,4.836956521739131
1566213,3,B00005JN5T,"`Meet the Fockers' means meeting Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand. That's all you have to know, and that's the best part of the film, of which script is utterly lame, and of which set-pieces are not as funny as they should be. But the Fockers, I mean, the husband and wife played by Hoffman and Streisand are so lovable, silly, and most of all, believable that you can forget all the unnecessary part of the film, and enjoy yourself watching the vintage comic acting from the couple.

Greg, no, Gaylord (Ben Stiller) and Pam (Teri Polo) come back as the lovers who are going to marry soon. This time, they have a bigger problem than before, and that is that they have to introduce the uptight father of the future bride, ex-CIA agent Jack to the parents of the Fockers. And the two Fockers house husband Bernie and sex therapist Roz (Hoffman and Streisand) are far from ordinary parents, who can casually talk about the `first time' of their much, much beloved son at the dinner. And to Greg's dismay, they are truly enjoying the embarrassing conversations.

And it is only natural that Jack find them a lot more embarrassing and even rude when ex-hippie Bernie makes fun of CLIA (L stands for `lack of') right before the proud Jack. The ice never breaks between the two families when they pretend it does, and the awkward relations, which get more and more awkward as the story goes on, are seen in the center of the comedy.

Unfortunately however, the script never gels. It has sparks sometimes, but clearly we see misfires oftener. There are several reasons for that ineffectiveness. Ben Stiller and Teri Polo do not look like a couple loving each other, and there are too many familiar kinds of gags involving toilet, dirty words, and a baby. To me, the greatest problem is that all the set-pieces are tired retread of `Meet the Parents.' Instead of volleyball in the original, you see football. If a cat is not good enough, there is a dog. And I admit Robert DeNiro is good, and I can say he is as good as in the first one, but don't you think that he is doing too many comedies these days?

But the couple of Hoffman and Streisand is a different thing, special gift from these veterans. They almost single-handedly save the film from the uninspired mess with their hilarious comic acting. The actors themselves may not be your favorite, but you should forget your liking or disliking for now, because these parents are so charming and credible. Especially Dustin Hoffman does one of his best performances in recent years. Probably the character of Bernie is so close to his own that some seem to say that the way Hoffman keeps on bubbling funny nonsense is exactly the impression we have about him during his interviews, and you can believe their words simply by watching the extraordinary but likable character he plays. Obviously Hoffman is in his element.

Despite the weak script and the weaker husband-wife descriptions of Robert DeNiro and Blythe Danner, `Meet the Fockers' is better than I expected. Of course, that does not mean very much when I usually don't expect much from the sequels. But the family of `The Fockers' of the film's title are genuinely fun to see, and I am ready to revisit their home, even if I  didn't find the film itself particularly great.",1134259200,2,3281,4.658031088082901
1566214,4,B00005JN5T,"This is not burst your gut comedy but it was amusing and Hoffman, Streisand and DeNiro definitely had great chemistry. Lots of suttle humour.

1566216,4,B00005JN5T,"There are sometimes in the whirling world of movies, where sequels don't always shine very well when movies are made. Nevertheless, there is once in a while, a movie that can be just as funny as it was before. That was the case with Ben Stiller and the film, Meet The Parents. The film was side-spliting, and it was one of the most recent comedy treasures I've ever seen. Now, would Robert DeNiro and company be able to bring it out to a whole new life itself. Hard to believe, but the sequel shines even more than the original actually did a few years ago, all thanks to a little star power.

Meet The Fockers, with Ben Stiller, Robert DeNiro and others shows how the in-laws can be a better world than imaginative. Jack, a former CIA agent and his family, visits Gaylord Focker and his parents played by Dustin Hoffman, a lawyer who has a inner-feeling of a hippie, and his sex therapist wife played by the legendary Barbara Streisand. The plot again follows the previous Meet The Parents, where Jack tries to get along with the Gaylord's family, and in the process tries to do whatever he can be able to to stop and prevent his daughter from marrying Gaylord. Some of the gags DeNiro pulls aren't all that bad, but from Dustin and Barbara's side, they both pull it off extremely well. The movie is funny and worth watching out of all the comedies that were released over the past few years. I just couldn't take my eyes off it.

All in all, Meet The Fockers was a great comedy when I just saw it for the first time recently on cable television. It you haven't seen this, go get a glimpse into the focker joy that is here. You'll be even amazed that your in-laws couldn't even be this loveable.

Just as hilarious as Meet the Parents, Greg and his fiance' Pamela bring her Parents to meet his sex-therapist mother, and quirky lawyer father.  This movie is crazy and funny!  Jack, played, by the great Robert DeNiro again tries to investigate a little too much while feeding his grandson through his home-made boobs.

1566218,1,B00005JN5T,"This awful tripe is of the ""squirm"" school of comedy.  People are so obnoxious or do such odious and tasteless things that the only logical response is discomfort.  Like watching your best friend get drunk and make an ass of himself or herself at a wedding or funeral.  That kind of thing.

It can be done well. And judging by the movie's popularity I guess there are legions who found the godawful Fockers contrasted with the uptight DeNiro hilarious.  I wasn't one of them.  I found it especially apalling considering the wealth of talent in front of the cameras.  DeNiro, Stiller, Hoffman and Streisand, and it sucked?  Yep.  Sorry.  I couldn't wait for this one to be over.

The first film had some of this discomfort humor too, but that film actually had its moments, with Stiller's geometric progression of effups becoming increasingly absurd and funny.  But here his parents were so completely obnoxious and inappropriate at all times (to my mind) that it was just one labored scene after another with some people you wouldn't want to know if your life depended on it.  DeNiro was so stiff reacting to these old hippies that he was a pain in the ass too.

Anyway, the only way to enjoy this film was to detest these people, and I didn't want to waste the time.",1131926400,11,1267,4.598214285714286
1566219,4,B00005JN5T,"Dustin Hoffman plays off DeNiro even better than in Wag the Dog and Barbara proves that whatever her shortcomings in political opinion, she can act and produce laughs in this wonderful sequel to Meet the Parents.

There is very little to not like in this movies as once again Ben Stiller underplays himself and lets everything around him shine.  There are too many funny moments in this film and it would be a crime to give spoilers to any of them, so I would just suggest watching it.

All the cast from the first movie continues to shine to the point that there isn't much left to add.  Only the totally expected ending makes this movie lose its last star.",1131840000,,658,4.458333333333333

The jokes are stupid, over the top, and require the characters to do a lot of actions that seem to be done just so the situations can be set up. The humor is dull and slapstick, and isn't funny.  The ""risque"" jokes intended to be funny just by virtue of making the audience uncomfortable fall flat.  They didn't make me uncomfortable, and they weren't funny. I did feel somewhat sorry for the actors forced to deliver the lines, but I figure they saw the script before they agreed and decided to do it just for the money.

Save your money and spend it on the original, or on Zoolander instead of this.",1131235200,7,828,4.421052631578948

1566267,3,B00005JN5T,"Meet the Fockers, was a bit of a disappointment considering how wonderful Meet the Parents had been.  The film picks up from the cliffhanger that the first movie had left behind; meeting the in-laws.

Ben Stiller, Robert De Niro, Dustin Hoffman, Barbra Streisand, and the rest of the cast, do a very good job considering that the plot and most importantly the dialogues are not that great.

There are quite a few unnecessary flaws with the movie, such as the extreme ""weirdness"" of the Fockers, which does not make them likable or cute in the least, and the little baby, which was totally unnecessary, not to mention the plot jumping around all over the place.

In short, far from being a masterpiece, it is a movie worth watching, though you might not want to go so far as to purchase it.  3 Stars",1130976000,3,798,4.5524475524475525
1566268,4,B00005JN5T,"I was expecting the worst, but this movie is actually very funny. Dustin Hoffman and Barbara Streisand do an excellent job portraying the ""free-loving"" hippie parents of Ben Stiller's character. From the other spectrum of that generation, Robert De Niro and Blythe Danner equally portray well the very conservative, reserved,  straight-laced side of the coin. As expected, friction arise, particularily between the two fathers.  This conflict is especially funny/interesting, since these were the two generational types battling it out in the presidential election of 2004, with Bush condemning ""those liberals"" and Kerry supporters, ""those conservatives."" The movie takes a funny look at these two generational types that do not get along at all. It's comical that for a ""non-violent"" pacifist, Hoffman's character inflicts the most physical injury to De Niro's character.

I thought Ben Stiller's performance was good. He plays a low-key, unassuming guy always trying to please everybody and do the right thing at the same time.

There were some dumb moments, but overall very funny. My favorite scene in the movie is when Hoffman stages his one-man sit-in.",1129852800,,1159,5.4222222222222225
1566269,2,B00005JN5T,"What I can't understand is the total lack of energy that Stiller put in his performance. It's so bad, so by the books, so uninspired, that it did not seem the same Gaylord Focker we watched in MEET THE PARENTS. This alone was responsible for a great part of the disappointment that this sequel is.

Hoffmann gets out of this mess untouched. This guy is a master actor, he can play anything, he has timing for anything. De Niro is, to my pleasant surprise, better than in the first movie.

The trouble is: the script is not even close to the hilarious quality of the first movie.",1129507200,,578,4.392523364485982
1566270,3,B00005JN5T,"The film that preceded this, Meet the Parents, was an exercise in situational comedy.  The jokes grew naturally out of the moments and the personalities established by the characters.  It also had a feel of truth to it - even if Jack (Robery De Niro) was ex-CIA (which most parents aren't), he was mainly a Dad looking out for his daughter.  In Meet the Fockers, we meet the groom-to-be's set of parents.  That they must somehow contrast with the uptight New England nouveau riche Byrneses goes without saying.  Unfortunately, they are too over-the-top to allow much in the way of ""truth"" in the characters' personalities.

That's not to say that such a film could not be funny, and the most delightful bits in Meet the Fockers are, in fact, those between the Focker family themselves - the hippy stay-at-home free spirit Dad (Dustin Hoffman), the hippy sex-therapist Mom (Barbara Streisand), and their eternally embarrassed son Gaylord ""call me Greg"" Focker (Ben Stiller).  There are also some great moments featuring the Byrnes family - the yearning of Mom for the kind of physical connection with her husband that the Fockers have for each other, and the continuing battle between Greg and the Byrnes patriarch.  Unfortunately, the screen gets filled up with too many alpha-male (and female) actors (Hoffman, Stiller, Streisand, and De Niro) that there is no time to develop the interrelationships to the point where the comedy pays off.  This is made worse because time needed to be made for Jinx (the cat) and his new nemesis, the Focker chihuahua.  But the most fatal mistake is the inclusion of Jack's grandson (by his second daughter) who makes the trip with them.  Again, he has some very funny scenes, but he exposes the script as sacrificing character for plot points - the Fockers should be delighted at the efforts Jack has made to bond with his grandson, because that was their philosophy in raising Greg.  Instead, they ridicule him for the sake of cheap laughs that diminish their characters.

Still, when the screen isn't overcrowded by all these stars vying for time, there are some great jokes, and the third act almost returns to the kind of situational comedy of the first.  It may not be as enjoyable as the first film, but if you did enjoy Meet the Parents, you will not be wasting your time Meeting the Fockers.",1129334400,,2335,4.819548872180451

1566324,2,B00005JN5T,"Meet the Fockers had a big promise of great fun for me - I've liked the first movie, Meet the Parents, quite a lot. Meet the Fockers is about Pam's parents finally meeting the future in-laws - an event Greg clearly is very nervous about. Things start rather smoothly, even as Pam and Greg get to the Byrneses house, where Jack is happily engaged in the grand-parenting business - a bit obsessively as is a custom with him, with Little Jack (or L.J. for short) as the object of his child-raising experiments, but then they very quickly get on a bumpy road. The main problem is the Fockers are nothing like the Byrneses - they like to live their life at full and in the full view of whoever wants to watch. They never hold their feelings, they are spontaneous to a fault and obviously that throws the old uptight Jack for a curve. A lot of misunderstandings, confusion and embarrassment later finally end up in a grand finale - The Wedding! With Kevin the old boy-friend as a rabbi no less. Unfortunately for me, this time a lot of ""funny"" moments in the movie revolved around toilet and sex life jokes and it looks to me I was more siding with the Byrneses in my reaction to them than with the Fockers. In short, I did not get it. Most of the funny moments for me were related to LJ - here is a cute funny little guy with the great sense of humor! I did enjoy seeing Barbra Streisand and Dustin Hoffman in the roles of Greg's parents - I may not like the story much, but those two act as naturally as they breathe and it's great to watch! Oh, and the two animals in the movie - the cat Jinx and the Chihuahua Moses - those were a lot of fun too. All in all I suppose the movie was OK to watch once, but when I watched it the second time - to see what the DVD extended version looks like - I even found it a bit boring. The extended version has the deleted scenes included and it's painfully obvious why they were deleted - they don't add anything to the narrative, only make it longer, not more fun. The other extras I suppose might be interesting for those who did like the movie. There is the Fockers Family Portrait, the story of creation of one of the main props in the movie ( I won't tell you what it is), Behind- the-scenes with Jinx the Cat and the story of how the role of Little Jack was played - and I rather liked the last two extras, they were fun to watch.",1127606400,3,2369,4.163398692810458

This one.. let's see, what's the one fatal mistake that directors/writers often make when they find a winning formula? Overkill! Let's take everything that was redeeming and charming about the first movie, and push it to the limit- the dog down the toilet was just too much..

I actually just watched this movie for a second time(a favor for someone), and found it almost painful to sit through. The person I watched with was a pretty big fan of the first movie, and I just knew they were going to think this one was disappointing.

I don't know, I just thought everything was overblown and unrealistic.. I realize most movies are, but the first one didn't stretch it this far.

Let me actually end this on a postive note, and I will give two scenes from this movie some due credit: the shrine Gaylord's dad made for him- the one displaying all of his ""Certificates Of Completion"", ""Sixth Place""- this was a funny thought. Also, just seeing the Focker family trying to play football..

1566365,3,B00005JN5T,"I'd give this a low three stars or a high two stars.  It's called a comedy, I suppose, but it really isn't funny.  There are very few laughs in it.  It's more of a human interest story.  Plus, it plays out the American right wing-left wing thing.

The left wingers are Dustin Hoffman, Barbara Streisand, and Ben Stiller, a married couple and their son.  They are pointedly Jewish.  There is really only one right winger in the story, Robert DeNiro, playing a very uptight retired CIA agent.

The moral of the story is that right wingers are much too uptight and should loosen up and have sex with their wives.

The first half of the movie was just too un-funny.  The last half wasn't funny either, but it was more ""human interest"" and was okay.

Take a potentially funny scene like a man trying to breast feed a little baby by actually putting on a fake breast that can squirt milk.  Charlie Chaplin would have made it hysterical, if it had been okay to do in his day, and perhaps he would have found a way to pull it off acceptably for his audience.  Richard Pryor and Chris Rock would have made it funny too.  So would Red Skelton, most likely.  Groucho Marx would have had us rolling.  I think he was about the funniest man of the last century.  But DeNiro really isn't a comedian, and when he does it I'm not laughing.

It's tough to make someone laugh when the script has you being a robotic tight-butt.

The movie is basically about telling conservative America to loosen up like a liberal Jewish family.  Okay, good.  Nothing wrong with loosening up a little.

DeNiro's dramatic work is better than his comedic work.  I don't think of Ben Stiller as one of the giants of comedy, though he is nowhere near as annoying as that guy who plays Bigelow the Gigolo, or that annoying guy from Saty Nite Live who does the No No No commercials (what's in your wallet?), or that constantly complaining and overly macho Denis Leary who has yet to do anything remotely funny, and who is about as funny as smacking a girl in the teeth.  You want funny?  Try Rodney Dangerfield, or Sam Kinison.  Now that's funny.

But the cast also has Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand, two very talented comedic actors, so how can it miss?  Dustin Hoffman can do anything.  He is just a damn capable performer, and if I see that he is in something, I know it was taken seriously and is worth a look.  He even made that wooden chunk of cardboard Tom Cruise into something once.",1125100800,,2456,4.429530201342282

I got a lot more of the humor and the additoion of Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand to the cast made the film for me.

The film picks up some time after the events of the first one. Gaylord ""Greg"" Focker (Ben Stiller) has finally earned the respect of future father in law Jack Byrnes (Robert DeNiro), who he is now allowing to marry his daughter Pamela (Teri Polo). However, there is one hurdle they have to clear: meeting Gaylord's parents. Jack is intent on meeting his daughter's future in-laws. So, the Byrnes (including Blythe Danner, returning as Dina Byrnes, and Jinx the Cat) journey down to Florida to meet Bernie Fokcer (Dustin Hoffman) and Roz Focker (Barbra Streisand), Greg's carefree parents. As soon as they meet each other, it's clear that the Byrnes and the Fockers are polar oppsites. The Byrnes (okay, Jack) are conservative and somewhat stuffy. They tell onlyof their achievements and think that a simple handshake is the proper way to show friendship. The Fockers on the other hand are the opposite: they hug people, tell embarassing stories, and dedicate an entire wall to Greg's underachievements. This creates some tension between ex - CIA agent Jack and Greg.

This results in several slight but very funny gags. Among them, a football goes horribly wrong, baby Jack drinks booze and sees ""Scarface"", Greg ""speaks the truth"" aout what he thinks of everyone, andon top of it all, Gaylord may already have a little Focker of his own.

It's basically a rehash of the first movie, but the same schtick is even funnier the second time around. This is a film that I think I could recommend to just about anyone with a bird's taste in movies.",1123804800,,1895,4.719033232628399

1566443,4,B00005JN5T,"Arguably the best comedy of 2004, Meet The Fockers is a hilarious, humor-filled marathon. Screenwriters Greg Glienna and Mary Ruth Clarke (who should have received Oscars for their flawless penmanship of Meet The Parents) turn in another blockbuster manuscript. But, as with its predecessor, Meet The Fockers wouldn't be the comedy masterpiece it is without the onscreen chemistry of Ben Stiller and Robert De Niro. Stiller, son of comedian Jerry Stiller (Seinfeld & King Of Queens), is a comic genius in his own right and has recently dominated the Hollywood box office with a string of smash spoof comedies such as There's Something About Mary (1998), Meet The Parents (2000), Zoolander (2001), Along Came Polly (2004), and Dodgeball (2004). De Niro, on the other hand, moves from the less serious roles of his early career into the comedy genre with an ease fully indicative of his enormous talent. Earlier comic roles in Wag The Dog (1997), Analyze This (1999), and Meet The Parents (2000) prepared movie-goers for the veteran actor's zinging one-liners. Throw Dustin Hoffman (who's also surprisingly funny) into the mix, and Meet The Fockers becomes one of those rare comedies that movie aficionados will want to see over and over again...

Meet The Fockers follows the continuing hardship of Gaylord ""Greg"" Focker (Ben Stiller), a male nurse whose future father-in-law, Jack Byrnes (Robert De Niro), is a never-ending source of torment. A retired CIA operative, Jack is paranoid and controlling, and Greg's previous attempts to win over Jack's affections have always come up short. Now, Greg's life problems are multiplied by the imminent first meeting between his in-laws-to-be and his ""birth parents"".

Traveling by RV, Greg, his fiance Pam (Teri Polo) and the rest of Byrnes family arrive in Florida where Bernie (Dustin Hoffman) and Roz Fockers' (Barbra Streisand) free-love, hippie lifestyle stands in stark contrast to Jack's serious faade. Throughout the visit, Greg works overtime to avoid having Jack learn of his mother's thriving sex therapy business, his own youthful indiscretion with the family maid, and his inability to supervise Jack Jr. for even a single afternoon. When Jack gets the idea that Greg fathered a child back in high school, he administers truth serum to Greg, sparking a series of events that is sure to make even the most ardent critic of ridiculous and juvenile movies (and this is one of them) burst forth in laughter...

Meet The Fockers is a rarity in that it's a sequel to a fairly successful film that manages to live up to the reputation of the original. Although Meet The Parents is probably the better film, Meet The Fockers is a truly hilarious comedy in its own right. Directed by Jay Roach (director of the Austin Powers franchise), Meet The Fockers is a highly entertaining comedy, deploying all the tricks of the trade - slap-stick, bathroom humor, zinging one-liners, classic ""fish-out-of-water"" sequences, and situation humor. By no means is it a cinema classic worthy of artistic awards and praise from sophisticated critics. But it delivers on its promise. It promises to make you laugh, and it performs that task with relative ease...

Yes, the first one was ok, so people that loved the first felt compelled to see the second one, and the filmakers knew that..so let's make a sequel, add new gross out scenes, make more fun of the focker last name (cause it's so easy), add in a cute kid, make Ben Stiller still screw up and get himself in weird and wacky situations, and make Robert de niro more crazier and deranged than the first.(which they did but it wasn't funny, what was the needle in the neck scene? Pretty weird!)

No matter how good the writing is, or how charming the Hollywood A-list cast is, comedy sequels always receive indifferent reviews, and regardless of box office success, they never reach the heights of the ""sometimes not that great too begin with"" original movie. Sure, there are laughs, but Ben Stiller and Robert DeNiro did all this before, and second time around, the back-and-forth shtick doesn't hit it off. The highlight is Dustin Hoffman, who manages to take a stereotypical character and give the film the most laughs. But cheap jokes about sex and circumcises are more painful than positive. And I think we got the idea that Gay Lord Focker is a queer name, it's only drilled into your brain every 5 minutes. On the plus side, the music zips the movie along at a sprightly pace, and there are some genuine chuckles to be had, but you shouldn't have to search for them. Like the recent string of comedy sequels (Whole Ten Yards, Ocean's 12 etc) Fockers thinks it's way funnier than it actually is.

First off there is way to much ""hey lets give them hints about what happened in the first movie"" in this sequel, while it is humrous and does have some entertaining moments as a box office smash it falls flat. Robert De Niro being the brilliant actor that he is, does much of the same dry, CIA humor as in the first, but in this case it goes to far, he's constantly running around being all secretive with the classic De-Niro facial grimus that he's known for, but this gets old fast. Ben Stiller pretty much still plays the confused uhh role here, and Dustin Hoffman doesn't really fit but he does bring some pleasant, Tootsie type laughs that manages to drown out some of the foul humor throughout the film(Dustin and Robert need to stick to there best roles, DRAMA). Barbara Streisand, who is very multitalented takes on the role as gaylord's mother, who is yep ""how fitting is this"" a sex therapist. This main flaw is what makes the movie really spiral down hill, there are so many sexual innuendo's in this movie that it should have definately gotten an R rating. Would i recommend any teenager watching this movie, probably not, whether or not it was the Foreskin that hits the bug zapper, or the greg stating on stage in front of everyone that he still Masterbates to Pam, or even Robert De-Niro holding up the book that states, Is Your Vagina Happy?? if you watch you'll get my drift. So basically this movie is just a bunch of crude humored sexual jokes thrown into an hour and forty five minute film, which is not what Meet The Parents was all about in the first place, this movie lost touch with itself and the first movie, and even the audience judging from all the bad reviews. Be a bit more strict on your rating Motion Picture Association, i myself am not that offended but i don't want my children going around calling each other FOCKER'S, everyone knows the insinuation.

1566497,4,B00005JN5T,"When ""Meet The Parents"" was first released in 2000,I didn't see it in a theater. I rented it on video,and even though I enjoyed it,I didn't seem to like it as much as everyone else did. So,when ""Meet The Fockers"" was released to theaters,I didn't rush out to see it,and I just watched it tonight. I must say,while I am glad that I didn't see this film in theaters(just because it is kind of long)if you liked the move that came out before this one did,then you will love this movie. Read on for my review of this:

This film picks up on where ""Meet The Parents""left off. Remember the first film,when Greg ""Gaylord"" Focker(Ben Stiller)wanted to marry Pam Byrnes(Teri Polo)the daughter of the insane Jack Byrnes(Robert De Niro)? Well,this film appropritaely leaves off on where the first film left off. Greg and Pam still not have gotten married,but the good news is that they are past dealing with Pam's father. And now that Greg and Pam are ready to get married,before they get married,Greg,Pam,Jack,and Pam's mom(Blythe Danner)go down to Florida to visit Greg's parents,Bernie Focker(Dustin Hoffman)and Roz Focker(Barbara Streisand). Now this is when the fun starts. Greg's father is not insane the way Pam's father is,and his mother is not calm and not willing to work things out the way Pam's mom is. The truth is that both of them are insane in their own little ways,which is the real highlight of this movie.

""Meet The Fockers"" is defnitely one of the funniest movies I have ever seen,and it is definitely one of the best sequels ever made. I found myself laughing my head off several times during this movie. There are things in this film that are funnier than some things in the first movie(in my opinion),this movie delivers a lot of laughs,and there are a few surprises in this movie that you may not see coming(I won't give those away).Someone who has not seen either this film or ""Meet The Parents"" needs to see M.T.P. before they see this film,because this is one of those sequels where You won't get it if you watch it when You hadn't seen the first film. But everyone who has seen the first film definitely needs to see this film-it is hillarious,and anyone who enjoyed ""Meet The Parents"" should enjoy it's sequel as well.

Oh,one more thing. Here is more good news:when the producers/actors involved with making this film were making it,they,as usual,they took out some scenes,and the DVD gives you two choices to which film you want to watch before You put it on and enjoy it:the version that was shown in theaters,and the extended version-which,if you select the extended version after you have the DVD in your DVD player,a blue horse comes up during the extra scenes,and You see the part that they did not show in theaters-the time on Your DVD player stars off from 0:00,You see the scene,and then you go back to the main movie. I won't give away what the others extras on this DVD are,but I give two thumbs up to the production team who worked on the extra features for this DVD).",1119571200,3,3000,4.667296786389414

Overloaded by an overabundance of lame, extremely unfunny, unoriginal, and juvenile attempts at toilet humor, sex humor, physical humor, breast-feeding humor, you name it humor, sunk this movie to a new low.  At the same time, many other clever opportunities for genuinely humorous moments were overlooked and squandered in an attempt to please the lowest common denominator appeal to an audience.

I have to wonder what made any stars of their magnitude appear in such a stupid movie.  Did they owe someone a favor? Did they read the script? Did they all need a check that badly?  Blythe Danner could have phoned in her part while she was asleep, that's how little she contributed to this film.  I know I won't look at these actors in the same way again, now that they've shown such disdain for us, as an audience, as to appear in this film.  I feel ripped off!",1119225600,7,1357,4.506122448979592

1566531,3,B00005JN5T,"I really enjoyed ""Meet the Parents"", and after the first twenty minutes or so of this movie I thought I was headed for another disappointing sequel. Luckily, the movie picked up considerably at that point, with the entrance of Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand, and the final result was satisfactory, although not as good as in the original production.

After Gaylord / Greg (Stiller) went through the odyssey of meeting his fianc&eacute;'s parents, it is time for both sets of parents to be introduced before the time of the wedding. I am not sure if everyone has such a hard time with this event, but I know that in my case it was a clear originator of concern and stress. Even though the movie is exaggerated to the extreme, it brings back some recollections about the occurrence, especially about how our parents may embarrass us when they describe certain childhood experiences.

Anyway, Greg is right on track after being able to enter the Byrnes circle of trust, and wants to stay there, at least until the wedding. There are a few facts though that may prove this hard to do, since upon their arrival at his parents' house, he learns a few ""truths"" that would certainly ruin his relationship with Pam's dad (De Niro) if they become known. Of course, hiding secrets from an ex-CIA agent is no easy task, and the process involves funny situations that really liven up the mood of the movie. If we add on top of this that Greg's mother is a therapist in a very special field, and that the contrast between both sets of parents could not be more striking, we end up with a mix that has lots of potential.

The funniest aspects of the film have to do with the comparison between the characters portrayed by De Niro and Hoffman on one side, and Danner and Streisand on the other. All four of them are excellent actors that take the script's strengths and exploit them to their maximum potential. The other new addition that is a hoot is Little Jack, who is the grandson of big Jack (De Niro) and as a result is being subject to rigorous training so he can become a genius kid. The scenes in which Little Jack stays alone with Greg and the results from this make this movie worth seeing.

There are two options for watching this film on DVD; you can go for the original theatrical version or for the extended one. Also, the features include a series of deleted scenes that are extremely funny, and which I think should have never been edited out of the original production. Be sure to watch them! - 3.5 stars",1119225600,2,2511,4.5364238410596025
1566532,2,B00005JN5T,"Meet The Fockers could have been great!

It started out good, but then lost its touch.

Honestly, I felt it ruined the original story

from the first film.

There were some things in this movie

that were just plain stupid...and not funny.

WHY would Jack bring his grandson along?

This little kid belongs to Pam's sister,

he has nothing to do with Pam or Greg.

I doubt they would take him along to meet Greg's

parents, especially on such a long road-trip.

The dog being flushed by the cat?

To me that changed the original style

of the comedy. I mean...this was not

a Naked Gun movie, why did they have to

write in something so ridiculous?

It was like a gag from a children's movie.

The Fockers saved Greg's foreskin?

Come on...this wasn't South Park.

I didn't find that gag funny at all.

They sure were scraping the bottom

of the joke barrel.

Jack puts a needle in Greg's neck?

Now that was just plain scary.

Not even Jack would resort to doing something

so nasty; it was just too un-realistic

Owen Wilson returns as Kevin,

the rich ex-boyfriend of Pam's -

but you'll notice he acts more like

Wilson's character from Starsky & Hutch,

and nothing like the original Kevin character.

This should have been a good movie,

using some of the original characters

from the first one, but for some reason

it just didn't live up to my expectations.

However, Dustin Hoffman did a great job

playing Bernie Focker! I thought the character

was warm, caring and a lot of fun!

Who could ask for a better dad?

Unfortunately, this was not a good

follow-up to Meet The Parents.",1119225600,,1592,4.50709219858156
1566533,5,B00005JN5T,"First of all, it is the first movie in a long time that unites such wonderful stars as Robert De Niro, Barbra Streisand, and Dustin Hoffman. So, having these people, you can imagine how good it is. It certainly is a wonderful comedy with very funny moments.

I hadn't seen such a funny and pleasant comedy in so many years!

It is always a pleasure to see Robert De Niro acting, with the faces he puts to Ben Stiller when he feels something is wrong.

Also, it is the return of Barbra Streisand to the movies for such a long time.

It is the third time for Hoffman and De Niro working on a same film.

Throughout the film you can see the chemistry of the 3 great actors, you can sense that they are having a great time while they are filming.

Streisand and Hoffman are such a great couple as the Fockers.

The one who steals the movie is definitely Little Jack (who is played by the Spencer twins), he is Jack's grandson.

The actors I disliked were Teri Polo and Ben Stiller, because for my taste, they have nothing to do with De Niro, Streisand, and Hoffman. In the few scenes they appear, they don't act as good as the other 3.

Blythe Danner is great as De Niro's wife. She's so conservative in her part, as De Niro is.

The movie is about how hard is meeting in-laws. Nurse Gaylord Focker goes with his future in-laws(Byrnes) to Miami to meet his parents, which are as different from the Byrnes as can be (Bernie Focker is a house husband, and Roz Focker is a sex therapist). Of course everything goes bad for Gaylord and his parents, as well as for Jack Byrnes(an ex CIA agent).

A very good thing of the movie is the Focker's dog Moises, he's very funny.

I highly recommend this film,whether you saw Meet the Parents or not.",1119052800,,1733,4.298461538461538
1566534,5,B00005JN5T,"This movie is not for children. It is also not for prudes. Having said that, I think this is one of the funniest movies that I have seen in years. There is little plot. Greg Focker (Ben Stiller) wants to marry Pam Byrnes (Teri Polo). In the film, Meet the Parents, he meets Pam's parents: Jack Byrnes, a hard-nosed type retired from the CIA, and his wife, Dina (Blythe Danner). Meet the Parents consists mostly of Jack bullying a klutzy Greg. In Meet the Fockers, the four of them, plus Pam's sister's baby, plus yappy dog take Jack's motor home to south Florida to meet Greg's parents. Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand are downright priceless as Bernie and Roz Focker. Bernie is a lawyer, Roz a sex therapist, and they both are the kind of ditsy characters that you meet in south Florida. (You meet them in California too.) There is a lot of sexual humor and a lot of potty humor. For example, the Fockers' cat, Jinx, flushes the Byrnes' dog down the toilet. (My cat, Duchess, would do the same thing in an instant.) I wondered how they got Jinx to do such a good job of acting. Humans generally don't train cats, cats train humans. Fortunately, Inside the Litter Box, one of many additions to the DVD tells us. As you might expect, Jack clashes repeatedly and outrageously with Bernie and Roz, but everything comes out fine in the end. I liked it.",1118793600,3,1352,4.5
1566535,3,B00005JN5T,"The Sequel to the comedy smash Meet the Parents has the soon to be married couple of Greg (Ben Stiller) and Pam (Terri Polo) travelling by way of RV to Miami so Pam's parents Jack and Dina (Robert DeNiro and Blythe Danner) can finally meet Greg's parents Bernie and Roz(Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand)  Whew!  Greg is not formally in Jack's circle of trust but Jack still won't let him  blow the horn on the RV.  Along for the ride is Jack's little grandson ""Little jack"" who is basically along for the ride to allow Jack to wear his special-made ""Boob"" milker and to learn a swear word as his very first spoken word.

Of course Greg's parents are polar opposites of the gruff and conservative Jack.  Dina is a senior sex therapist and Bernie is a former trial lawyer who quit work to be a stay home dad when Greg was born.  Of course Greg tries to hide these facts from Jack which becomes the central theme of the movie...Greg hides his parents occupations, the story of his first sexual encounter, as well as the fact that Pam is pregnant.  This all serves to get the former CIA agent back on guard and investigating Greg all over again when he thinks that Greg has a 15 year old son by his parents former housekeeper.

It's all formulaic with Hoffman and Streisand playing the hippyish, sex-crazed parents while driving Jack nuts with their odd ways.  In a near re-run from the first movie where Greg was in charge of Jinx the cat, he now finds himself watching little jack and is told to let him cry, no TV and only approve toys.  Well that all goes by the wayside as little Jack escapes from his playpen and glues his hands to a bottle of rum and is found by Jack watching Scarface on TV..oh...and he learns that swear word and repeats it over and over.

Meet the Fockers had some laughs but much of it seemed force in terms of lets get these people from opposite worlds together ans see what happens.  It was just a bit too over the top for me, especially Hoffman who came off a bit creepy.

We're so wacky!"".  Usually you'll want to crawl away, not unlike the Byrnses.  Still, it's fun to watch big name actors embarrass themselves.  Keeps 'em humble!

Unfortunately, this sequel continues in the same vein as the original. Making fun of Greg's profession as a male nurse and using his last name in virtually every way possible to replace the sexual expletive, this film appears doomed from the start.

Along with heavy innuendo based on the family moniker, much of the script's humor relies on overt sexual themes for the punch lines. Working as a seniors' sex therapist, Roz promotes erotic exercise moves and candidly discusses options for an amorously repressed couple. A paternity case, a busload of buxom cheerleaders who start to remove their tops and an incident of mooning are also played for laughs. As well, a toddler learns to swear repeatedly and gets his hands on some hard liquor when a flustered caregiver is distracted by an incoming call.

1566579,2,B00005JN5T,"In this sequel to the popular and very funny MEET THE PARENTS, Greg Focker (Ben Stiller) and Pam Byrnes (Teri Polo) are planning to marry, so naturally their parents should meet each other first.  Greg is understandably nervous about this.  Where the Byrnes' are uptight and strict, the Fockers are antiestablishment liberals who are open to the point of oversharing on a regular basis.  There you basically have the plot, as the two parties ricochet off each other.  Additionally, Jack Byrnes (Robert De Niro) is still going to extreme lengths trying to prove that Greg isn't good enough for his daughter.

Where PARENTS was clever this film isn't.  The script is about as lowbrow as you can get without bumping it up another MPAA rating.  The situations are predictable; Greg got into trouble while taking care of the cat before - this time it's the baby.  And so on.  De Niro's character, who was genuinely intimidating in contrast with the hapless Stiller's, is just a cartoon now.  On the plus side, Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand are occasionally funny, likeable and well cast as Greg's parents, but many of their lines still fall flat.  The film runs far too long, largely owing to an extraneous subplot in which Jack believes Greg has spawned a son via another woman.  Much of the ""humor"" is derived from Greg's real name (Gaylord), which was a single throwaway joke at the end of the first movie.  That's about all it was good for, but it is relied upon again and again here.

It also struck me as odd that in a film loaded with bathroom humor, explicit sexual discussion, a preschooler swearing repeatedly in baby talk, close-ups of cleavage, a dog that humps anything it finds (moving or not), a flying foreskin, and fake breasts and penises (the Focker home is virtually a museum of erotic art; Jack straps on a makeshift mammary so that he can ""breastfeed"" his grandson) that a flasher on a bus still has to carefully lift her top so as to stop just short of showing her nipples in a brief scene near the beginning of the movie.  It's absurd, and in a film that is supposedly espousing sex as something healthy and fun, feels hypocritical.

There are two options to watch the movie on DVD - theatrical and extended.  In the extended cut, the deleted scenes are clumsily inserted back into the film.  It's jarring and these segments are even more tedious than the bits that were left in, so I recommend just watching the theatrical edit if you watch the movie at all.  There is a short feature on Mr. Jinx, the Byrnes' cat, which is silly but cat lovers will enjoy getting another look at this fine feline who has far too little screen time.  There is also commentary by the writer and director, as well as bloopers.",1117843200,4,2733,4.630705394190872

I respect Robert Di Nero for some brilliant films like ""Casino"" and not to forget the mafia perfect film ""Goodfellas"" He's getting old and I'm sorry it feels sad to see him play a character as ineffective and out of place as what he plays in MTF. His character in Meet The Parents was better lined but in ""Meet The Fockers"" he seems to try hard to be taken seriously. He still remains one of my favourite actor. I just hope no more future ""meet the ____"" movies come up.

Dustin Hoffman is about as irritating as they come. It's quite apparent how unintelligently inclined his pretentious over the moon happy character is. There is absolutely no story and the humor seems rather bland and highly exaggerated. I have  a bit of a humor going around but this is the classic case of befooling the audience.

""Meet the Parents"" was one of the best and most commercially successful mainstream comedies of recent years, a hilarious tale of a young man trying his damnedest to impress his prospective father-in-law - an ex-CIA agent with some mighty strange ideas about interpersonal relationships - and being thwarted at every turn.

Now comes the sequel, ""Meet the Fockers,"" in which the young, affianced couple, Greg and Pam, take her parents, Jack and Dina Byrnes, to meet his parents, Bernie and Roz Focker, a pair of freethinking flower children left over from the `60's (she's a psychologist who specializes in sex therapy for geriatrics) who have little in common with the uptight, conservative Jack, a man with a few eccentricities of his own to account for.

One of the reasons why ""Meet the Parents"" worked so well as a comedy was that, no matter how absurdly preposterous and slapstick-y the scenes became, the humor always remained rooted in a universal, believable premise.  We always felt for Greg because we could identify with his predicament.  By bringing in this second set of parents, ""Meet the Fockers"" begins to feel less like a human comedy and more like a strained sitcom, one in which the characters and situations become subordinated to the laughs and all sense of reality flies out the window. That's not necessarily a bad thing, since many of the jokes here are, indeed, very funny, but one still misses the heart that made the original film such a first-rate comic charmer.

That being said, ""Meet the Fockers"" is still a lot of fun to watch, primarily thanks to the high-caliber cast that has been assembled for the occasion.  Joining the original players - Ben Stiller, Robert De Niro and Blythe Danner - are Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand, two old pros who seem to be having the time of their professional lives plowing full-throttle through this material.  The material itself is a bit on the crude side, with lines that are not quite sophisticated or subtle enough to qualify as double entendres.  Add to that a few too many jokes about mammary gland function and scenes involving dog humping and you will quickly realize that the writers are aiming for a fairly low common denominator audience here (the title is the first dead give away, I suppose).  Nevertheless, some of these bits do actually result in some genuine laugh-out-loud moments, thanks primarily to the caliber of the performances.

Although  the director tries to reprise the success that he enjoyed with the prequel, he falls short of the mark. In the final analysis, this film is simply not as funny. It is too contrived and forced, and some of the humor falls flat.

The basic premise of this film is that Gaylord Focker (Ben Stiller) is going to marry his fiancee, Pamela Bynes (Teri Lord). Consequently, her parents, Jack (Robert De Niro) and Dina Byrnes (Blythe Danner), are going to meet his parents, Bernie (Dustin Hoffman) and Roz Focker (Barbra Streisand), for the first time. This is a proposition that has Gaylord in a state of total anxiety.

Gaylord, who prefers to be called ""Greg"", and  Pamela join her parents in order to travel down to Florida, where the Focker family lives. Joining them is the Byrnes' cute baby grandson, Little Jack (Spencer and Bradley Pickren). They all travel to Florida in Jack's custom made, kevlar coated, state-of-the-art RV. When they get there, the clash of the titans begins, as the conservative Byrnes are polar opposites of the ultra-liberal Fockers, and never the twain shall meet.

Robert De Niro and Blythe Danner are, once again,  excellent in their respective roles, as are Teri Lord and Ben Stiller. Unfortunately, Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand fall flatter than a pancake, being neither funny or likable. This is not necessarily their fault. The fault lies in the screenplay, as their characters are too contrived. Rather than funny, they end up being simply annoying.  Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand manage to hit simultaneous career lows with their respective roles. How the mighty have fallen.

Still, the film is not a total loss, as it does provide some laughs. One should, however, rent this film, rather than buy it.",1116720000,2,1827,4.928338762214984
1566623,3,B00005JN5T,"""Meet the Fockers"" is a funny film with an all- star cast of Hollywood big wigs. This movie is a sequel to the fun film ""Meet the Parents"" from many years ago. This time around, the soon to be married couple is driving to Florida with the bride-to-be's parents to meet with the groom-to-be's parents. The bride's father is a conservative stick in the mud type who dislikes anything he doesn't consider normal. The groom's parents are throwbacks to the 1960's- strong believers in free love, hugs, and unconventional living.

Barbara Striesand and Dustin Hoffman play the roles of the two liberal parents, and they offer some good, entertaining on- screen chemistry. There is plenty of contrast among the different characters, and this adds to the movies appeal. There are also a few surprises in the plot and some original humor, making the movie that much more enjoyable. And the basic premise is something most people can relate to. We all feel a little bit of anxiety when we meet our significant others' parents for the first time, and this movie uses this scenario (in an exaggerated way, of course), as its main plot.

Director Jay Roach moves this film in a few different directions to keep it from becoming a boring, standardized comedy. In the middle and near the end, he introduces a new segment to the plot involving a young teenage boy who looks very much like Ben Stiller's character. The bride's father, played by Robert DeNiro, decides that his future son in law is the actual father of this boy and he sets out to prove his point, with the ultimate goal being to eliminate Stiller and convince his daughter to marry someone else.

This movie isn't a comedy classic, but it does have its moments. Whether it's the contrast between the characters, the contributions from the baby, the comedic timing, or something else, you will probably like ""Meet the Fockers"". It isn't quite as good as the original, but it's still a fun flick to watch for its good humor and fun plot.",1116547200,,1985,4.714697406340058
1566624,2,B00005JN5T,"During the seventies and eighties, American movies were obsessed by cars. They raced relentlessly over rain-slicked streets at night and desolate interstates in such classics as ""The French Connection,"" ""Bullit,"" ""The Terminator,"" ""The Getaway,"" ""Easy Rider."" Since 2000, the car has been replaced as a major plot device by that appliance found in every home, hotel and motel: the toilet. Not since the excrutiating usage of toilets in ""Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle,"" has this appliance been given such a workout as you'll find in ""Meet the Fockers."" Early on in the movie, we're introduced to glum, grim Robert Diniro whose teaching his little grandson to make hand signals when he needs to ""poo poo"". (Big audience guffaw). When everyone enters Diniro's monstrous van, he again reminds the travelers about the do's and don'ts of using his vehicle's state-of-the-arts toilet (more chuckles). Or, as Mae West once referred to bathroom humor as ""tur-let"" humor. You suspect correctly that we're being set up for a major happening later in the movie involving this gleaming item and we're not dissapointed. At the Focker's residence, Dustin Hoffman then instructs everyone about the proper usage of HIS toilet (Uncontrolled giggles). Perhaps the most indelible image one carries away from this constipated comedy is the sight of Hoffman sitting on the john and doing Number Two. (Major hysterical laughter). Diniro is taking a shower just a few feet away and he peers out and says he'd like to have some privacy. Hoffman flashes him that endearing Hoffman grin and says: ""I've nearly finished."" This scene is so striking in its crudity that you wonder how it was filmed. In his heyday, Hoffman was notorious for shutting down sound stages while he got ""into the mood"" for his role, or, as this Method Actor put it, until he found the proper ""sense memory."" What sense-memory did Hoffman recall to create that look of satisfied well-being on his elfin little face? How many takes were necessary before achieving this glowing visage? Were there really numerous rolls of Charmin' used for the sake of authenticity? What a sublime moment in film history! From Ratso Ritzo in ""Midnight Cowboy"" to toilet sitter. And how could a movie like this end without the requisite toilet disaster being caused by that adorable cat and dog? Call me old-fashioned but I found all those cars of decades ago vastly more entertaining than all the boring, porcelein 'turlets' in ""Meet the Fockers.""",1116460800,,2481,5.038929440389294

1566626,5,B00005JN5T,"Robert DeNiro and Ben Stiller delighted audiences in the last quarter of 2000 in MEET THE PARENTS. Director Jay Roach reunited himself with DeNiro and Stiller and made this sequel which gained just as much viewership,maybe more,as the first film. In this film,we meet Bernie(Dustin Hoffman) and Roz Focker(Barbra Streisand) who are Gaylord's(Stiller) parents. Bernie is a legal aid attorney and Roz is a sex therapist. Jack Byrnes(DeNiro) has an RV and takes his wife Dina(Blythe Danner),their daughter Pamela(Teri Polo),Pamela's fiancee Gaylord(nicknamed Greg),and Pamela's toddler nephew(his mother is Pam's unseen sister) on a road trip to Florida where Bernie and Roz live. The Byrnes' cat Jinx,now can flush a toilet on his own(he was trained to do such things since MTP). This impressed the hell out of Greg. Stiller recalled in an interview that he had little to do with Jinx in MTF and more in MTP. Jinx is the furry creature's real name and producers had a chair made with his name on the back support! The Fockers' pet is a chihauha(che wow wuh) named Moses,whose real name is the same also. One funny scene was when Moses almost gets flushed down the RV's toilet accidentally,Jinx saves him! Another was when the Fockers and Byrneses were eating dinner at the Fockers' home,Greg's penis foreskin landed in the gravy pitcher! It was between two pages of the Fockers' scrapbook,not secured in place. The Byrneses were looking inside of the scrapbook during dinner. Greg pulled the book out of Roz's hands and the foreskin flew into the gravy! Another was when Jack's and Dina's grandson ended up with glue all over his hands. Jinx opened the toddler's playpen and out went the toddler. Greg was keeping an eye on the kid and turned his back for a minute to answer the phone. That's when Jinx did what he did. Jack,a retired CIA agent,discovers details that at first leads him to believe that Greg is the father of a Hispanic boy named Jorge(hor hay) Villalobos. 15-year-old Jorge's mother is the Fockers' beautiful housekeeper Isabel. Then it is discovered that Jorge's father is actually a retired baseball player. At a Florida nightspot,in the mens' restroom,Jack administers truth serum via syringe into Greg's neck. Then Greg appears on the bandstand,with mike in hand,confessing unbelievable truths such as losing his virginity to Isabel,masturbating to Pam and that Jorge is his son. He even makes insulting comments to Jack Jr.,the Brynes' grandson. During a touch football game,Jack pulls a muscle in his back and it comes to the attention of Roz,who also gives professional massages. She tells Jack that Dina is a hot sexy tigress! Also,there's a showdown between Jack and Bernie,who is so fed up with Jack's bad attitude. Jack even almost goes back home to New York,leaving his family stranded,except Jack Jr.. Bernie and Greg track down Jack and they end up speeding and caught by a nasty-tempered state trooper. Jack catches the threesome and abruptly stops. The vehicle registration for what Bernie and Greg were in expired in 1979 and was never renewed. Jack explains to the state trooper that Jack is a CIA agent. The word ""retiree"" appears on Jack's ID but Jack still acts like one since he is proud of his job. So Bernie,Greg and Jack are in jail. A short time later,they are bailed out by order of a judge who was once one of Roz's patients. The judge thanked Bernie for the wonderful job that Roz did to him(the judge). Greg planned to create his own ""Circle of Trust"" after he married Pam. He initially decided not to put Jack in it. Jack created a COT,mentioned in the first film,which Greg was in and out of a couple of times. In the final scene,Greg and Pam are married in a Jewish ceremony. The young minister was played by Owen Wilson,who co-starred with Stiller in STARSKY & HUTCH. Since this film probably exceeded the success of MTP,there will probably be another sequel. All producers have to do is come up with a good title. This is Hoffman's best film since 1988's RAIN MAN,in which he won a Best Actor Oscar. Streisand had many starring roles in films as early as the 1960's when her showbiz career began.",1116288000,,4146,4.857344632768362
1566627,3,B00005JN5T,"Working in the business world, you are constantly told that by hitting your goal, you are just working to your average potential.  If you exceed that goal, then you are surpassing your potential.  Nearly everyday this is mentioned to me in some form or another, yet I wonder why it wouldn't apply to the business of Hollywood?  The bar for Meet the Fockers was set, but for some strange reason, the actors only worked to their goal, and never exceeded it.  Riding high off the hysterical Meet the Parents, I thought that this film would bring a new chapter into this ""original"" story, but instead director Jay Roach decided to stick with Hollywood standards and recycle the same jokes using different players.  I don't know why I am so surprised, I witnessed this before when Roach directed the sequels to Austin Powers.  The original film was inventive, original, and hysterical, while the other two films just seemed to recycle the same formula from that original film.  The same could be seen in Meet the Fockers.  From a similar plot structure, to undefined, clichd characters, to a complete lack of humor, Meet the Fockers hit their goal, but chose not to exceed it in any way.

For a comedy film, I felt this just didn't quite have the punch from the original film.  While there were a couple of lines that I found myself chuckling at, there weren't any of those ""laugh-out-loud"" moments that I experienced with Meet the Parents.  The actors who were in the original seemed bland and really just going through the motions, while the new elements (Streisand and Hoffman) seemed over the top, nearly tipping the structure all together.  There was no balance.  It was almost as if director Jay Roach was asking us to forget about DeNiro and Danner, and focus more on Streisand and Hoffman.  We needed a stronger, more comedic balance in this family.  While I do think that there was chemistry between these four players, it was never fully matched or developed.  Their jokes also make for bad comedy.  Have we not learned yet that bathroom humor is a thing of the past?  There seemed to be more of these than the intelligent humor reached in Meet the Parents.  Secondly, how many times can we hear the word ""Focker"" and laugh at it.  I believe that it was overused in the first film, and deeply buried in this film.  If these were the two anchoring jokes for the film, we are definitely on the wrong road of comedy.  Roach had a very funny film on his hands here, but strangely, he focused on repeating similar jokes from the original, ultimately lowering this film from hysterical, to humorous.

I mentioned above about how the actors were not reaching to their potential, and I do believe it to be true.  DeNiro seemed bland throughout this entire film.  There was no surprise or inviting element to him.  Ben Stiller, literally, needs to take a break for a bit.  His humor seems to be slowly fading with each film that he creates.  He seems to jump head-first into the big budget films, when I really think that he could make a bigger impact on the smaller, independent pictures.  Hoffman's character seemed forced.  I could tell that he was having fun, in fact the whole cast was having fun, but no work was getting done.  Hoffman had this one-dimensional character that only seemed alive because of Streisand's wacky shenanigans.  Finally, there was the muted Teri Polo, whose character was so exciting that I nearly thought that she was dropped midway through this film.  Again, I cannot state this enough, there was so much potential wasted in this film that I nearly imagined new ways to make this film as the film was still playing.  Hoffman and DeNiro together should have created a match in comedy heaven, but instead ""ha-ha"" purgatory seemed more apt.

Finally, I would like to say that nothing in this film surprised me.  I kept waiting to get to the point in the movie where I would finally say, ""This is why this film was created..."", but it never arrived.  Roach hit the potential bar, but chose not to go above it.  He knew he had enough money invested in it if he continued to use repetitive jokes and situations that creativity and originality was completely thrown out the window.  It was sad to witness such greats fall, but I just wish there was more to this film ... not in length, but in girth.  Meet the Fockers is a perfect example of Hollywood creating just to meet budgets and create revenue.  It was a formidable idea, but the finished product probably never reflected this idea.  I was massively disappointed.

Overall, there were some chuckles from me as I watched this film, but never any laughter.  From the reviews and friends who spoke so highly of this film, I was expecting to be blown away by the possibility of a comedic sequel that worked, but perhaps I was setting the bar too high.  Stiller does seem tired, as did the rest of the cast except for the newbies that never quite balanced out this picture.  Everyone seemed so clichd that you could literally pick out their characters from other comedy films from across the ages.  A majority of the blame I bring on Roach's shoulders, as he needed to break his normal, tired, Hollywood recycled mold of filmmaking.  I wasn't overly impressed with this film and would probably suggest skipping it.  It carries none of the power, originality, or creative genius that Meet the Parents did.

1566676,3,B00005JN5T,"""Meet the Parents"" fame introduces the Focker family. Bernie Focker (Dustin Hoffman) and Roz Focker (Barbra Streisand) play the parents of Gaylord Focker (Ben Stiller).

Robert De Niro (Jack Byrnes) returns as the father of Pam (Teri Polo). Gaylord and Pam are engaged but want the blessing from both parents. The whole film is based on Jack looking for Gaylord's flaws to expose to Pam. And a reason to dissolved there wedding.

The potential in-laws Bernie and Roz are very affectionate in public and private. They teach Gaylord that there is no winner and loser. Everyone is a winner. Hence, they display all of Gaylord's trophies albeit seventh place or below. A shrine is built on a wall for everyone to ""envy"" at. Well that is contrasting to Jack Byrnes where you either win or you're a loser.

The parent's differ in values, parental methods and personalities, thus giving the film some comedic options that the viewer can relate to. This gives some value to the film.

This film has some good laughs utilizing the stepson. Of course utilizing the running jokes (Everything Focker!) through out the film keeps the viewer interested, but cannot excel this film into a classic comedy.

1566679,3,B00005JN5T,"This sequel to the hit comedy MEET THE PARENTS exceeded everyone's wildest expectations when it grossed nearly $280 million at the US box office, and became the highest grossing live action comedy of all time.  Although audiences seemed to love this lowbrow culture clash comedy, most film critics were seemingly merciless in their hatred of the film.  In the end, the film is solidly enjoyable, and perhaps is even superior to the somewhat one-note original film.  The picture ends up delivering more or less what it promises, so it's difficult to fathom exactly what type of movie that most critics and naysayers were expecting.

The likable Ben Stiller had been on a hot streak of successful films for a good five years or so before the release of FOCKERS, and he has emerged into a remarkably good straight man - managing to find laughs without pushing too hard.  Robert De Niro, unarguably one the screen's finest dramatic actors of all-time, has staged an amazing third-quarter career revival as a comedic actor in the last few years, and he has never appeared more comfortable playing comedic aggression as he does here.  The film's major casting ace, however, is the dynamic one-two punch of Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand as Stiller's free-wheeling parents.  Hoffman and Streisand literally radiate with an irresistibly genuine warmth and a combustible comedic energy that completely steals every scene in which they appear; if there is to be a third FOCKER film, I hope that Hoffman and Streisand are given the starring roles!

If the film has a downside, it is certainly the often ho-hum nature of the script, which somehow manages to be somewhat unfocused and completely predictable at the same time.  Also, I do wish that the film-makers had given the lovely Blythe Danner and Teri Polo more to do this time around, as they often seem heavily underutilized in the presence of heavy weights like De Niro, Hoffman, and Streisand.  The film succeeds, however, thanks to it's ensemble of extremely likeable character and it's powerhouse cast that overcomes even the most well-worn screenplay.  While it will never be a critical favorite, MEET THE FOCKERS is an amusing, sometimes hilarious, farce that is much better than many of the so-called ""comedies"" of the last few years.

About the DVD: The picture quality on Universal's MEET THE FOCKERS DVD is sharp and clear, which is to be expected for a recent film, and the sound is perfectly fine, although this isn't the type of film that will give your sound system a work out.  Viewers have the choice to watch the film in either it's original theatrical cut, or a new extended version.  Unfortunately, the extended cut does not use the seamless branching technique, and there is a noticeable ""jump"" when the new scenes are spiced in.  Also, the added scenes are presented in non-anamorphic widescreen, and are of poorer picture quality.

The extras are well done.  The audio commentary by director Jay Roach and co-producer Jon Poll is a good listen, although it could have potentially been a classic track if some cast members had been included as well.  Several deleted scenes are presented in non-anamorphic widescreen, and most are pretty funny.  The entire cast's appearance of the ""Today"" show is very much worth watching, and I hope that more studios begin to include such supplements on their DVDs.  The gag reel of the actors flubbing their lines and various other onset goofs is somewhat routine, but very funny nonetheless.",1114992000,,3500,4.960616438356165

Blythe Danner may be the second banana to all the shenanigans of her co-stars, but she admirably holds her own, in the role of the wife of a real paranoid lunatic.

1566717,2,B00005JN5T,"Normally, sequels try to disguise the fact that they are simply attempting to create the same profit from a cheap remake of the original.  They do this by trying to retain the chemistry of the first film, while providing a new plotline for the characters to travel down.  MEET THE FOCKERS, on the other hand, fails to provide even the smallest bit of originality.  What the producers of this film have done is take the same characters, overdeveloped them a little, and forced them to run down the same plotline.  I'm serious.  One gets the impression while watching this movie that they simply erased MEET THE PARENTS from the original script and inserted ""FOCKERS.""

Of course, the film is not entirely without merit.  On the plus side, MEET THE FOCKERS takes itself a little less seriously.  While Stiller's parents, played by Hoffman and Streisand, are quite over-the-top and ridiculous, they have moments of rational clarity and insight that prevent their characters from becoming outright annoying.  Unlike the Byrnes' family, who is seemingly unaware of their ticks and flaws, the Fockers are aware of their quirkiness and I enjoyed that aspect of the film.

While I found myself laughing at certain points, however, this sequel was more painful to watch in a variety of ways.  De Niro's character, Jack Byrnes, is difficult to watch in MEET THE FOCKERS.  In the first film, Jack came across as uptight and conservative, but generally a rational (if not overly-rational) man.  In this film, however, Jack just comes across as a heartless jerk and we are no longer convinced that Stiller needs to pander to his sensibilities, for anyone who does so would be equally soulless.  Finally, the film did not know when to end itself.  The last 30 minutes drag on at an unbearable rate and I could not wait for the film to end.  In summary, if you liked the original, you might want to check out this sequel.  But I have a hunch that it will disappoint you.",1114473600,4,1955,4.770833333333333

It was of course a hit too so a sequel was in the works but not immediately simply because ""we wanna make sure the scripts good"". They should've waited about a year.

Pam and Greg(real name's Gaylord) are getting married soon and Greg has just barely impressed Pam's parents. But now it's time for everyone to meet Greg's. So off they go in their RV with Pam's newphew Little Jack to Florida. And of course Greg's parents couldn't be anymore different than Pam's. His father is very uninhibited and loves to talk and laugh and joke around while his mother's a sex therapist. They also have a cute little dog named Moses which, as dogs like to do, hump things. Which isn't a good thing for Jack's expertly trained cat.

There's a noticeable sameness with the film. It almost feels like things were placed together simply because they knew it would work and don't take chances. We still have the jokes about Greg's last name(Focker) such as his cousins Randy and Orny, since one family has a cat, why not add a dog? There's even a moment where through really no fault of Greg's, he's blamed for a big catastrophe, like the original.

The casting however is spot-on. Normally playing a kind of know-it-all, Dustin Hoffman is quite perfect as Greg's eccentric dad. And while I normally can't stand Babs, Barbara Streisand was likable, but she still sucks otherwise, just not here.

It would have been much more funny if the 2 families would have liked each other superficially at first and then as they learn more...grow further apart.

What a waste of time for some very good actors.",1114387200,4,580,4.383177570093458
1566760,4,B00005JN5T,"Meet the Fockers is a solid sequel to the Ben Stiller starring Meet the Parents.  In the sequel, Greg (Stiller) must bring his future wife and her family to Florida to meet his parents played by Dustin Hoffman and Barbara Streisand.

Meet the Fockers is more of the first movie, with Greg trying to keep his parents from totally embarassing him in front of his conservative, uptight future inlaws.  With so many stars in this movie, Striesand and Blythe Danner don't get as much to do.  De Niro's character does the exact same things as the first movie.

Dustin Hoffman is really the star of this movie.  He is the focus of almost every scene and is definitely the acting equal of DeNiro.  And am I the only one to notice...What happened to Teri Polo.  In some scenes, she looked kind of creepy, not anywhere close to the cute girl in the first movie.

Meet the Fockers is a fun movie to watch, but is basically an extension of the first movie and offers nothing new except solid laughs.",1114387200,3,987,4.4692737430167595

With the addition of Dustin Hoffman and Barbara Streisand as the parents of Gaylord ""Greg"" Focker there are some truly hilarious moments in this film and they are just perfect as the parents of Ben Stiller's character.  The only funnier choice could have been Jerry Stiller and Ann Meara, Ben Stiller's real-life parents.  Regardless, Hoffman and Streisand are very funny as caricatures of former-hippy, bleeding-heart, Jewish liberals -- and they play it to the max.  Back, of course, are Robert DeNiro and Blythe Danner as Jack and Dina Byrnes who just have a fantastic chemistry together.  The one weak link in the cast in Teri Polo as Pam, but she was also the weak link in the previous film.  She is just not funny.  She should stay with The West Wing where she has excellent chemistry with Jimmy Smits.

1566762,5,B00005JN5T,"Meet the Parents was a genuinely funny and suprisingly heart-felt comedy about parents coming to terms with their children growing up and accepting their choices... including the choice of a future son-in-law. The story followed the various problems Gaylord M. Focker encounters while trying to get into Jack Brynes's good books and no matter how good his intentions are or even if he lets his guard up for 1 second he ends up in the middle of a disaster. The first installment of this story had a time bomb quality to it which thankfully has been let go off in the second installment. The funny one-liners have been replaced with a lot of bawdy jokes, innuendo and sexual references which although had all the adults in splits may confuse the youngsters and some of the material is not appropriate. There is no nudity but some profanity (used in a humourous situation) may be unsuitable for very young kids. The story this time around revolves around the Brynes' meeting the Fockers after having accepted Gaylord aka Gregg as their son-in-law. The Brynes are old fashioned,rigid and uptight and the Fockers are their exact opposite. Dustin Hoffman plays the house-husband and Barbara Streisand plays the sex therapist for the elderly which adds to the awkwardness between them and Jack Brynes. This movie delivers the funnies in large doses and has enough repeat value to merit buying the DVD. The DVD has loads of deleted scenes among other features which will make you want to revisit the same. Go get it now !!!",1114300800,3,1515,4.8307692307692305

1566764,4,B00005JN5T,"Meet the Fockers is the sequel to 2000's Meet the Parents. It begins with Greg and Pam flying off to visit Jack and Dina Byrnes. He doesn't have to check his bag (which was the running joke from the last movie), the flight is overbooked so they're upgraded to first class; everything seems to be going right at the start of a vacation Greg's feared for years. Once they arrive, the four (plus Jack's infant genius grandson Jack Jr.) head off in the Byrnes' new RV to ""meet the Fockers."" Dustin Hoffman plays Bernie Focker, Greg's stay at home father who deluged him with love as a child, and Barbara Streisand plays Roz Focker, Greg's sex therapist mother.

Once again Ben Stiller and Robert De Niro are a hilarious duo, their on-screen chemistry, Stiller as the trying too hard to impress son in law and De Niro as the tough guy father have made them the new odd couple.

The comedy I have to say is not always as classy as most would care for but it is most certainly always funny. Yes some of the jokes are quite trashy but then there are always so many jokes one can make out the name ""Focker"".

Ben Stiller is back to his usual gig: entertaining, self-deprecating, and lovable. Robert De Niro shows once more that he's as good of a comic actor as a dramatic actor. Dustin Hoffman is a tremendous addition to the cast, answering the long asked question, ""Who would name their kid Gaylord Focker?"". And after eight years off-screen, Barbra Streisand's return to film makes for a good gimmick but not the most enjoyable performance. She's suitable as Stiller's mother, but aside from her Yiddish quips she's the least funny of the gang.

Meet the Fockers is exactly what a sequel should be, funnier than the first and it most dfefinately does this. With a hilarious cast and brilliant director this film was always destined to be a winner with the public.",1114300800,,1857,4.550898203592815

1566767,3,B00005JN5T,"There is a moment in ""Meet the Fockers"" when Pam makes a stand regarding her intention to marry Greg.  She will become Pamela Focker.  Greg opines it could be Pamela Byrnes-Focker.  ""No, no, no,"" she insists, ""I will be Pamela Martha Focker.  I know how that sounds, but, but, that's the name I'm taking.""  I burst out laughing and my wife wondered why.  ""Honey,"" I said with that sort of loving condescension that infuriates her to no end, ""there is only one joke in this movie.""  That is an exaggeration, but one look at the title and you know what the main joke is for this 2004 sequel to ""Meet the Parents.""  But Polo plays the moment so absolutely straight faced, not only because it makes the line work perfectly but also because the actress knows (a) this is probably the only laugh she is going to be able to get in the film and (b) it is impossible to compete with the rest of her cast mates when it comes to mugging and milking a scene, so why even try?

This is a movie that stresses character over plot because the plot basically boils down to the same thing as last time: Jack is worried about Greg and makes an erroneous assumption that sends him off into full-blown CIA mode, yelling about the ""Circle of Trust"" and insisting his daughter cannot marry this man.  As Pam says, ""Here we go again, Dad.""  There is another family dinner where something both alien and familial is added to the table.  There is another pet to worry about.  However, the big difference is that for the sequel Greg's parents have been added to the mix and it is in the manic performances of Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand that this film gets most of its laughs.  They are Bernie and Roz Focker, and they are as loose as Jack is uptight, plus they talk twice as fast, apparently in a frantic effort to find something genuinely funny to say.

Last time Ben Stiller's Greg had to play second fiddle to Robert De Niro's Jack.  This time he not only has that burden again with his parents added to the mix, but there is a baby, Little Jack (Spencer & Bradley Pickren), who is being raised strictly in accordance with Jack's viewing of parenting.  Of course, Greg will take care of that in short order, the same way Jinx is going to get that little dog too.  The baby fits into the movie perfectly because when he finds his one laugh line, the kid sticks to it for the rest of the film.  Then there is poor Blythe Danner, pretty much forced into the 7th position in the film's hierarchy and taking small comfort in knowing her daughter has an Oscar given all the grown ups in this film have two a piece.  Dina finally gets a funny bit to play, as she uses sock puppets to role play a conversation between herself and her husband, and she has to play the scene in a long shot.  At least they gave her that much.

There are plenty of chuckles in ""Meet the Fockers,"" but with the basic story being the same and the main jokes being the same, it has to be less than the original.  Only having Hoffman and Streisand on board breathes some real energy into this sequel and when you find out that they were improvising a lot of their scenes that only underscores the inadequacies of the script.  I am sure the cast had fun making this film, but it really should have been funnier on this end given all the star power assembled in front of the cameras.",1114214400,18,3334,4.340322580645161

We surely seem to be inundated with stupid or one-joke comedies, or those that rely on the ""schtick"" of a particular performer, one, at that, who  may not exactly be brilliant.

No, this is NOT a great movie. Not even the cleverest comedy of all time.  Still, it is very, very good, and thoroughly enjoyable.

The main achievement of this film is the chemistry between all the players.  It is a minor stroke of genius to take such high-level talent and orchestrate a wonderful ensemble effort such as this.  That these stars were willing to be part of an ensemble, thereby sharing the spotlight, is very gratifying.  Major kudos to Ms. Streisand, and Messrs. Hoffman and DeNiro, as well as the film-makers, who apparently set out to create a very enjoyable and satisfying movie-going experience. Mission accomplished.  You gotta love watching Ben Stiller control his reactions to his future father-in-law's jabs and underhanded compliments.

1566824,4,B00005JN5T,"I'm a big Barbra Streisand fan, but to be honest, even I lost patience with her last few movies.  She seemed to play into this lofty image of herself as this sophisticate whom no man she meets can live without or is worthy.  In The Prince of Tides, I thought that if she wasn't careful, Barbra the actress was going to do in Barbra the director.  That was borne out in her last movie, The Mirror Has Two Faces.  Happily, in her return to the screen here, she goes back to the kind of comedy that she does so well, that a lot of younger people have never seen.  (Check out The Owl and the Pussycat and What's Up,Doc? kids.)  Yes, some of them can't believe that they are enjoying her (it must be killing Mssrs Parker and Stone!), but Barbra hasn't been this loose and in over 30 years.  And as if she isn't good enough, she works for the first time - at long last - with BOTH Hoffman and DeNiro!  I will even committ an act or heresay and say that I think Hoffman stole the picture.  However, his chemistry with Barbra is wonderful and a treat to watch.  What the hell took so long?

The rest of the cast does fine, considering what they are working with.  Yes, DeNiro has been slumming, but it is fun to see him and Babs have a couple of scenes along together, though one of my favorites was seeing Barbra reunited with Blyth Danner whom she directed in Prince of Tides, coaching her as a sex therapist!

OK, so maybe Babs, Dusty and Bob should have done something more topical and serious with Scorcese instead of this silly fluff with Jay Roach, but I'll bet it wouldn't be anywhere near as fun!",1113868800,15,1597,4.248344370860927

I just rented this today (it just came out on DVD) on the recommendation of my 18 year old daughter, who saw it in the theaters. She liked it. I didn't see it in the theaters because I thought the trailers I saw a year ago (as we all know, they're the best parts of a movie) looked lame.

Weelllllll......... turns out I should have followed my original instincts. If I could have rated this piece of crap with negative stars, I would have.

The driving force behind the humor of the first movie was the dichotomy of De Niro's character versus Stiller's. In this dreck, De Niro's character has been reduced to some kind of simpering, mugging character who barely conforms to the character of the first movie. He looks uncomfortable in the part, as well he should - he obviously was just copping to the paycheck. Pathetic.

Dustin Hoffman: Well, hell, who knows what's been going through his mind for the last decade or so.

Streisand:  I don't know what to say here. She lives down to her previous level of thespian accomplishment.

Stiller:  Ben, bubba!  Wake up and smell the coffee! Your career is so erratic you can't afford to keep making this kind of mistake. Starsky: cool. Dodgeball: cool. Parents: cool. Fockers: sucks! Zoolander: sucks! Tenenbaums: sucks!

1566887,3,B00005JN5T,"""Meet The Fockers"", the inevitable sequel to ""Meet The Parents"", has a sufficient number of laughs. Surprisingly, these laughs are generated primarily by just two of the stars and they are not the same people who caused all of the laughter in the original.

Two years later, Greg and Pam (Ben Stiller and Teri Polo) are still engaged and anxious to set a wedding date. Before they can move forward, they have to introduce Pam's parents, Jack and Dina (Robert DeNiro and Blythe Danner), to Greg's parents, Bernie and Roz (Dustin Hoffman and Barbara Streisand). The plan is that Greg and Pam will meet Jack and Dina at their home and fly to Florida together. Upon arrival at Casa Byrnes, they learn that Jack has purchased a super customized motor home and they will drive down to Florida together. They also meet Jack's grandson, by Pam's sister. Jack has taken an obsessive interest in his grandson, Little Jack, going so far as to teach him sign language and communicating with the baby. Greg knows that the meeting will probably be awkward and tries to prepare his parents, two free-thinking liberals who are a sex-therapist and a stay-at-home father.

In ""Meet The Parents"", Jay Roach crafted a hilarious comedy of errors about a nervous young man going home to meet his girlfriend's parents. Every time Greg tried to become part of the family, his nervousness or Jack's watchful eye caused him to make some mistake. The events escalated until Greg was setting fire to a hand-crafted gazebo or beaning the bride-to-be with a volleyball.

""Parents"" was a wildly successful film and proved to the world that DeNiro, known for his work in dramas and action films, has a place in comedy as well. Because of its success, a sequel was pretty much inevitable. ""Fockers"" generates a lot of laughter, but these are almost all created by the work of Dustin Hoffman and Barbara Streisand.

The filmmakers have shifted the focus that made ""Parents"" so funny. In the original, all of the laughs came from Greg's unease with Jack. In ""Fockers"", all of the laughs come from Jack's (and to a lesser extent, Greg's) unease with Bernie and Roz. Bernie and Roz, products of the 60s, are the type of people who were overjoyed when Greg lost his virginity, at 15, to the Latino housekeeper. So overjoyed in fact, that they invite her back to help with the welcome home dinner, and to meet Jack and Dina.

Hoffman, in particular, and Streisand seem to have a great time playing these characters. Greg has inflated the truth about each of his parents, to make them seem more impressive in Jack's eyes. Bernie is a lawyer and Roz is a doctor, at least as Greg relays the message. In truth, Bernie quit his practice to stay at home and become Mr. Mom to Greg and Roz is a sex therapist to senior citizens. Because Hoffman and Streisand work so well together, they create the same effect as watching DeNiro in the first film. Much of the laughter comes from watching actors known for their great work in dramas letting loose in a comedy. There is something exhilarating about watching Hoffman play everything for laughs.

Everyone else basically plays the ""straight man"", setting up the jokes. In a few cases, they aren't taking on this role intentionally. A scene in which Jack injects Greg with truth serum is spectacularly unfunny, but Stiller manages to wrench a few laughs out of it. DeNiro isn't so lucky.

Let's talk about DeNiro for a moment. DeNiro has always been a busy actor. Most years, you can expect to see him in two or three films. In the past, I have always felt that he took on certain roles for the challenge of playing a different character. For instance in 1998, he made ""Ronin"" and ""Great Expectations"". ""Expectations"" was more or less a supporting role for him, but ""Ronin"" was a great action film. In 2000, he made ""Men of Honor"", ""The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle"" and ""Meet The Parents"". A mixed batch to be sure, but ""Meet The Parents"" stands out as a very good comedy. Lately, he just seems to be on a money grab; making sequels, bad horror films and terrible comedies, banking on his name to earn him large paychecks. Is he broke or something? Worried about retirement? I don't know, but how else would you explain the actor taking roles in ""Showtime"", ""Godsend"", ""Analyze That"", ""Shark Tale"" and ""Hide and Seek""? It's the great DeNiro money grab.

The problem with ""Fockers"" is that it tries to redo many of the same situations that were so funny in the first film. In the sequel, we have a beloved family Chihuahua, in addition to Jack's cat. Of course the cat came along for the ride, they're in a mobile home. Jack redirects most of his obsessive tendencies from his cat to his grandson, Little Jack. Of course, Greg will get into trouble when he watches Little Jack. Also, since we are familiar with the formula from the first film (every thing Greg tries to do right will spiral out of control and make him look bad), we know what to look for and aren't that surprised.

""Meet The Fockers"" has a few laughs in it, and is best when we get to watch Hoffman and Streisand have fun.",1113264000,4,5097,4.635658914728682
1566888,5,B00005JN5T,"Meet the Fockers is a fresh and entertaining comedy with a lot of hilarious punch lines. Ben Stiller is funny in everything that he does and Robert DeNiro has a classic comedic touch. The casting of Barbara S. and Dustin H. could not be any better for this part. It's nice to see Babs in a hip movie for once. Some of the best comedy though came from the little baby and the ""sign language"". Although not as good as the original, this was an excellent way to move with this story. Getting 3 oscar winners to do a movie like this is not easy, therefore its fun to watch for that if not for anything else. I'm a huge DeNiro fan and am glad to see him do some comedy (King of Comedy (1983) is a sort of dark comedy with DeNiro that I recommend for anyone).

In this sequel the Burns family goes on a trip to meet, Greg's parents. Streisend plays a sex therapist and Huffman a retired lawyer. Of course, everything goes wrong with the trip including Jack being convinced that Greg has an older son by his childhood babysitter who took his virginity.

I recommend this movie greatly, and I suggest you watch the first one if you haven't already also.",1113177600,2,1145,4.296296296296297

No, I thought and we went to the marvelous ""Finding Neverland"" (which I highly recommend over this dud).  Eventually I did give ""Meet the Fockers"" a chance, against my better judgment, since I was thoroughly disgusted throughout the whole film (and I have quite a stomach for certain levels of comedy, but this movie is just too much) wondering how in the world it didn't receive an ""R"" rating.  This movie has more gratuitous, gross-out, fart joke, sexual innuendo and over-the-top-in-your-face sex jokes than any ""PG-13"" movie I've ever seen.  I cannot believe that our culture was willing to pour hundreds of millions of dollars to see DeNiro (forfeiting all dignity) wearing a breast and jokes about Stiller's (losing even more of the little dignity he had from his wonderful-cancelled-sketch show) foreskin falling into the fondu.  What the world needs now is love sweet love, not more jokes to make us all go ""gross!""  I would never show this to my children in a million years, and I don't have any!

1566936,4,B00005JN5T,"I thought this sequel would like many hyped up sequels prove to be a huge disappointment, the first film was brilliantly original and funny and trying to top it was a hard task.  Bringing in Barbra Streisand and Dustin Hoffman to join the cast in the sequel was not only brilliant casting but a great audience puller and I thought when I went to see it that it wouldn't live up to it's hype - I was wrong.  The movie joins Greg (Ben Stiller) and Pam (Terri Pollo) as they are about to introduce their parents to one another at Gregs parents home of Focker Island in Florida. What follows is a hilarious clash of cultures and Jewish Liberal meets conservative WASP. As we had all met Jack (de Niro) in the first movie you knew it was going to be explosive when Jack (Robert De Niro) met the Fockers (Streisand and Hoffman). Dustin hoffman and Barbra Streisand play Greg's parents, he is a stay at home father and she, a sex therapist for senior citizens.  Getting these two was brilliant and their chemistry was electric.  The scenes they shared were the highlight of the movie, as were the scene between Streisand and Stiller.  Barbra Streisabd proved she really is a star by coming back to the movies and letting people see her as never before, she was motherly, sexy and very funny. Ben stiller for me is at his strongest as Gaylord Focker he proves he is a talented actor with unbelievable comic ability. The only real negative from me comes from Robert De Niros character, not in the way it was portrayed but rather the way it was written, he did exactly as he had in the first film as the ex CIA, he was suspicious and very straight and after a while it began to grate on the nerves it was overkill.  All in all a very funny film and one not to miss.",1112313600,5,1755,4.351681957186544
1566937,4,B00005JN5T,"While this is not as good as the first movie, (""Meet the Parents""), this movie does a good job of carrying on the Focker story from the first movie. It also has to be said that the first movie would have been a seriously hard act to follow.

The story line is pretty similar to the first, with a few differences thrown in to spice things up. While it is not as gut-wrenchingly funny as the previous installment, it is actually a very good laugh.

Robert De Niro is his usual best being the cold and paranoid Jack Byrnes, with his ""circle of trust"" thing. He is brilliant in the ""fish out of water"" role as Jack struggles to cope with a completely alien environment. Stiller is still putting on an excellent act as Gaylord Focker, and does well in a role that changes through the movie. I won't spoil the changes, but just add that it is good to see.

I must add that Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand really rock as Gaylord's parents. They are truly hilarious and completely the opposite of the Byrnes, (some interesting developments there, too, as the movie goes on). Streisand is remarkably good at comedy, something which I had not guessed she had a talent for, (I have not seen many of her movies before). With Hoffman and Streisand, the makers cast the perfect people for the role of the Fockers. They were simply brilliant, and were superb in every crazy way.

This movie is one that you will not regret seeing. It is funny, at times touching, but also just mighty good comedy. I thoroughly enjoyed it, though my stomach did not hurt as much as it did with ""Meet the Parents"".",1112313600,2,1584,4.451724137931034

The Fockers were supposed to be eccentric, but they became annoying after a while as each scene became more and more obsurd.

It's the sequel that we ""Meet The Parents"" fans have waited three or four long years for... and guess what- it tops the first! When I went to see this sequel I thought it would not live up to the high standards set out in the first one but,this comedy managed to pass my expectations and keep me reasonably entertained. It's a good feel good and roll over laughing movie.

Unlike the first that had suddle humour this movie was over the top and maybe not the sequel you will expect to see but, it still manages to be a nice chapter in Gaylord's acceptance and approval from his father-in-law Jack.

Of course you know their will be casosis as the two families meet for the first time The Fockers- have always been touchy, feely, coddling and admiring parents- who love Gaylord no matter what he achieves even displaying his collection of eigth and ninth place ribbons. While the Byrnes have always had family secrets and have expected nothing less than perfection Jack even trys to pass that perfect onto the next generation of Byrnes by, making his grandson Little Jack into a baby genius by teaching him sign language and using a new method in which the youngster has to comfort himself rather than be coddled by others. The two families could not be more differant and when they meet all hell breaks loose... first of all Greg's mom is a sex therapist and her and her husband are not afraid to engage in loud activities and touching eachother- something distrubs Jack straight away... followed by the fact that Greg's dad left the position as a high-powered attroney to stay at home and care for Greg... the two families collide in a mishaps of events from showing sercumsion photos, to flushing a dog down the toliet, to Greg learning he may have a son with the woman he lost his virginity too, and Greg's mom helping Mrs. Byrnes' with some bedroom issues. Before Greg knows it he finds himself outside the circle of trust and on top of that- Pam's pregnant so they need to speed up the wedding date. But, can they when Jack dosn't approve?

Ben Stiller is great along with great performances by DeNiro, Hoffman-who is a real comedian despite what I believed at first and Streisand does a half-way decent job herself.

I laughed out loud watching this movie and in my opinon it's just as funny if not funnier than the first and I can't wait to have it my collection. I just hope we haven't meet the last of this movie series!",1111449600,,2525,4.579646017699115

Ben Stiller is a decent actor, I have not liked him ever since he made Cable Guy, but I am starting to warm up a little to his movies. I really liked the first one, and the second one was very good but didn't, in my opinon, surpass the first one, in comedic funniess. It had its fair share of laughs, but not as much as the first one. There were some very funny moments in this but they quickly got stale, and overused. It felt like they were trying to milk the joke til it is not funny.

I must admit, I went in expecting the worse based on the reviews, but it surpassed my expectations.  Meet the Fockers is very easy to sit through, doesn't make you look at your watch, and it has some great laughs (even if they are rather crude). Everyone enjoys a film from time to time which doesn't require too much thought.

Hoffman, Streisand and De Niro steal the show for sure. Stiller isn't too bad as the son embarrassed by his parent's behaviour. My advice:  Do not to take it seriously, just enjoy it.  It is a good value 3 star film ... no more, no less.",1110067200,2,824,4.256410256410256

1566957,2,B00005JN5T,"Meet the Parents was a good movie with many laugh out loud moments. Unfortunately they should have left the success of the movie alone. Instead they made Meet the Fockers which did not live up to my standards. When making sequels they should be as good if not better than the first. I believe Fockers put a bit of a damper on Meet the Parents.
I went in to Meet the Fockers expecting to laugh, a lot. Ironically I laughed out loud more at the showing of Christmas with the Kranks which had bad ratings. I expected Fockers to be so much more than Kranks but it definitely was not. There were some cute parts in Fockers but it did not live up to Meet the Parents, not even close.
There are great actors in the movie which may attract you, and they do great performances. The movie gets kind of old after everything always seems to go wrong. The awkwardness of Ben Stiller around the inlaws gets annoying which actually started to get annoying in the end of Meet the Parents. Unfortunately the roles of his parents in the movie just seem to be overplayed.
Overall I do recommend this to be rented, but definitely not a DVD buy. If you feel as if your Meet the Parents collection will suffer without the Fockers then so be it, but I guarantee Fockers will get dust on the cover.
I originally gave the movie 3 stars but after remembering how much I worked myself up for a great movie and was let down I was forced to put 2. The actors are what save the movie from not being a dud and deserve 2 stars.

Stiller is too embarrassed because his father Bernard Focker played by Dustin Hoffman (Racing Stripes, Finding Neverland) and his mother Rose Focker played by Barbara Streisand (The Mirror Has Two Faces) are insane. His mother is a sex therapist and his father is a lawyer. Much more outrageous then the first one but yet when you have a scene in which Dustin Hoffman tackles Robert DeNiro throwing DeNiro's back out...you cant miss the fun. Some scenes aren't funny but hey, I had a decent time. If someone says its a stupid movie just by the trailer then there's something wrong with you....if your a movie fan...watch it and then complain about it...I hate people who do that. Highlight would have to be Ben Stiller talking on the microphone after he had truth syrum stuck in his neck. Tim Blake Nelson (Minority Report, Cherish) and Kali Rocha (Tv's Buffy The Vampire Slayer, The Crucible '96) also star and Owen Wilson (The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou and The Wedding Crashers) has a cameo towards the end. This is the second best Stiller movie to come out this year...I hated Dodgeball, I sorta liked Anchorman and I hated Envy but I liked Starsky and Hutch. Streisand hasn't done anything for a while...wonder what drew her to this. Hoffman has a couple more coming out and this is Robert DeNiro's only good movie this year....Shark Tale and Godsend sucked.

1567025,3,B00005JN5T,"In the original movie back in 2000, we were introduced to the incredible family name of Focker. With a name like that, you could expect all the eventual jokes that followed. And they were funny. As they kept going on and on overusing it, it was no longer the funny joke it was, but it could still muster up a good chuckle or two. Well, that's pretty much what you get with this sequel. It's a case of been there, done that, got the T shirt. A comedy with jokes you've seen and heard before, a lot from the first film, but still has a silly, goofy enough charm that it can still elicit some laughs here and there. By no means is the movie original, or does it really differ a whole lot from the original smash hit. More on that later. This time around, male nurse extraordinaire Gaylord Focker(the always game Ben Stiller), and his fiance Pam Burns(the lovely Teri Polo), are getting ready for there wedding, and are readying up the meeting between her parents and his. Ex CIA agent Jack Burns(Robert DeNiro), and wife Deena(Blythe Danner), insist on driving down to Florida to meet Greg's parents in Jack's new swinging RV. A ""hotel on wheels"". They are also bringing along their son Denny's infant son, who Jack is in deep training with. Once down in ""Focker Isle"", the Burns', and us, are finally introduced to the people who would spawn a child and name him Gaylord Focker. Lawyer turned housedad Bernie Focker(the exuberant and lively Dustin Hoffman), and sex therapist mom Rosalyn(the pretty good Barbra Streisand). The two are light, freewheeling type of hugsy/kissy happy people. Right off the bat, they mix with stoic Jack like mayonnaise and concrete. Then the film simply goes into a retread of the original. Future in laws clash, embarrasing momets occur, and so on. Even Jinx the cat is back for the ride. It's a decent, albeit one note, comedy, that pretty much does with the jokes that made the original pretty good and popular. While there are numerous funny moments, the comedy seems to take the easy way out a lot of the time and really go for the lowest joke or sight gag. With mom being a sex therapist, you can guess where a lot of the more adult humor will come from. If you offense easily from sex talk, sex jokes, and toilet humor, then this is not for you. A lot of the jokes and gags get repetitive after a while, but a lot of it can be quite funny and enjoyable. It's not a bad movie, it's just not very original. The cast tho, is what really saves the movie. The returning cast are all good and game. DeNiro is DeNiro. He is a living legend. It seems like he was going through the motions a bit here and phoning it in. Wether or not he was or it was just keeping with the character. He still is DeNiro, and him phoning it in is still better than most else out there. Stiller is still a likeable goof and he is here too, although it seems he isn't as big in the comedy department as he was in the original. The real shining spot here is the addition of Hoffman and La Streisand. I have always been a huge Hoffman fan, and he is a lot of fun in his role as Bernie. He is lively, energetic, and seems to jump right into the silliness of it full force. He is the main one here who really made the movie better than it is. As for Ms. Streisand, this is her first movie in 7 years. She pretty much matches Hoffman in the way that she too seems to just dive into the role and fill it with a lot of zest and livelihood. The two are the best parts of the movie, and they go together with their characters so well. Blythe Danner, on the other hand, pretty much has a background role. She is there, like in the first movie, to get on Jack's case for being a jerk, and nothing else. Same goes here. Teri Polo is pretty much around to pertty up the place, and not having the role she had in the original. Keeping in touch with it's predecessor, the movie touches upon Greg's ""milking the cat"" moment, and an appearance by Owen Wilson as Pam's ex boyfriend Kevin. We also get a parade of new Focker-isms, and some new relatives whose names go interestingly with their last name. With such a strong and dazzling cast, one would of hoped for something more. The only reason it succeeds in being silly, fluffy entertainment is because of the nice work from Hoffman and Streisand(can't believe I am writing a reivew of praise for Babs)who, with their energetic and fun performances, elevate the movie. So, the end result can be funny at times, and is entertaining and enjoyable enough. Especially if you liked the first one. In the end, this latest sequel doesn't cause any harm at all.

Ben Stiller's family is loud, obnoxious, and very open about private things.  You can bet that's where some of the dirty humor comes from.  The girl's family is very polite.  They are very private about private issues...and the two families put together create a funny, not hilarious, movie.

The two seemed a natural couple and obviously were having a great deal of fun together. The movie is magic when they get on screen.

If you were fans of the original movie you love this even more. In contrast to Robert Dinero and Blyth Danner's characters this film is a funny roller coaster fromt he moment Dustin and Barbara hit the screen. The contracst of the two familties is hysterically real.

Bed Stiller is really the audiences persepctive in this movie. The story is simple - in-laws meet in-laws. The fun begins when Dustin enters the room with Barbara right behind him!

I would reccomend this film to those who need a light fluffy fun picture. I applaud Dustin for doing this film and I applaud Barbara for letting her hair down, out and all over!

I didn't care for the first one too much..but Iloved this one!

You go Dustin and Barbara!  1-05",1106438400,,1220,4.589861751152074

The movie has an all-star cast (Robert DeNiro, Blythe Danner, Barbara Streisand, Dustin Hoffman, and Ben Stiller) although it is becoming blatantly obvious that Stiller takes the same types of roles just about every time he does a film (""Along Came Polly"", for example). In my opinion however, he does a great job 9 times out of 10. If it ain't broke, don't fix it! I would highly recommend this movie to anyone, especially those who are in need of a good laugh. Many comedies have a laugh here and there, but this movie had me laughing the whole way through (and the rest of the audience at my showing would probably agree! They were laughing hysterically too!)

1567078,3,B00005JN5T,"I liked this movie but just due to the cast. The movie is uneven and basically just skips from one scene to another. If something is funny it's repeated a few times until you are tired of hearing about it as well. For instance Jack (Robert Deniro) teachers his nephew sign language and doesn't want to treat him like a regular baby. He also wants his first words to be something special. So of course Greg Focker (Ben Stiller) messes that all up by teaches him a bad word on accident. That's funny until the baby repeats it and repeats it through the movie until it's not funny anymore. We are constantly reminded that Barbara Streisand is a sex therapist on it for example. That almost makes it feel like an adult sex comedy as well which does make it seem a little diffrent from the first one.

  Dustin Hoffman is hilarious though as Greg's dad and steals the show along with Barbra Streisand as Greg's mom. They have an open sex life and are just all out open people. While Jack has all these secrets and keeps everything inside which makes his scenes with the Fockers more enjoyable. The fact that the movie trys to make you think Jack can change just like that isn't that believeable though. While the first was about Ben Stiller trying to fit in and constantly messing up. This one has little for him to do. I think it works more when Stiller does mess up in a scene or two. For instance the scene where he babysits and totally makes a disaster of it is the scene that I think worked the most. Plus Jack thinking that Stiller has a 15 yr son he's hiding from everyone is pretty funny as well.",1105574400,,1599,4.34113712374582

Priceless for the star of ""Raging Bull"".  Who knew Hoffman could be so funny since ""Tootsie"" and Babs, where have you been???  Blythe Danner is a dream and Ben Stiller is just a comic genius.  Watch the babysitting scene.  His delivery is flawless - not since ""Along Came Polly"" have I seen such an rip-roaring performance.  This IS the feel good film of the year!  Opening with Greg (aka Gaylord) planning a reunion with Pam's retired CIA human lie detector father down to the measurements of his suitcase!  Even the stewardess with the chopsticks in her hair has returned!  Wow!  We were hysterical!

1567111,3,B00005JN5T,"If you caught and enjoyed ""Meet the Parents"" a few years back, you might have, in a second, brainstormed the idea that became inevitable sequel.  Take the same idea, toss in an annoying set of parents for Ben Stiller who are liberal and extroverted counterpoints to Deniro's uptight and competitive waspy-ness, toss in the same jokes and let the script work its magic.  You know the result wouldn't have knocked your socks off, but then you're not a Hollywood writer.

Unfortunately, ""Meet the Fockers"" goes no further than the hash of ideas you might have had after unreeling ""Meet the Parents"".  The Fockers are liberal and liberating jewish counterpoints to the Byrneses, and the turbulent meeting between the two of them would entrap Ben Stiller's character in a series of embarrassing snags (the most egregious involving sodium pentathol, the teenage son of the Focker's hottie cook, Mr. Byrnes's prodigal grandson, and a simulated latex breast designed by Deniro's character).  The script tries to brainstorm the twists of the first movie (remember how none of Focker's stories panned out after a records check because his name had been changed?) but comes up short.  Most of the subplots seemed forced (like Stiller's father getting all three of them arrested) and by the end, you're more relieved than amused.",1105228800,,1317,5.074074074074074

To see these 3 legends together (Streisand, De Niro and Hoffman) in one movie plues this ine being a comedy and being kinda silly is fun, they wanna have fun doing it and we have fun watching them, plus add to the mix the very funny Ben Stiller and you have a winning formula.

The plot is very simple in the first we meet the parents of the girl now is time to meet the parents of the boyfriend they are as wacky and as different the the gorlfriend's parents so guess who has a problem with them, yes De Niro and some very happy things happened.

Wrong.  Now, the Byrnses are coming to meet father and mother Focker, Bernie (Hoffman) and Roz (Streisand).  To call the excentric might be an understatement, and Jack is his usual uptight self.  And, of course, that means that Greg's life is about to become hellish once again.

""Meet The Fockers"" is the sequel to the popular ""Meet The Parents"" that was released a few years ago.  Following the same formula, ""Fockers"" puts Greg in one uncomfortable situation after another as the parents meet.  All the principals from the first film are back, along with Hoffman and Streisand as the Fockers.  Both do a good job as the quirky parents that must have made poor Greg's life interesting as a child.  Hoffman is the standout in this movie, I think.  He is probably the most likeable of all the parents, and is genuinely funny almost every time he is on screen.

If you liked ""Meet The Parents"", you will like ""Meet The Fockers"".  Simple as that.  If you didn't, then stay away.  This is more of the same, and for the most part it works.  When it is funny, it can be extremely funny.  Hopefully, now that Greg has survived this second meeting, his life will less stressful.  He deserves it!",1105056000,5,1365,4.69198312236287

If it were on TV, and there was nothing else on, I'd watch it.  There is something to the sophomoric humor and screeching annoyance of Barbara Streisand that simply irks me the wrong way.

That said, I am forced to admit that this wasn't a poor film.  The cinematography was adequate; this is not an artsy film.  The acting was fine, Robert De Niro was okay, but the teeth and edginess of his character was removed.  Stiller continues his reign as king of the awkward moment.  There are plenty of laughs, but none that one couldn't find in a much more accessible form on network sitcoms.

I actually didn't think it would be as good as the first one (most sequels aren't), but I found it was just as funny, if not funnier!

However, with some excellent casting choices and just a better story I'd say this one did it.  If you thought that Stiller's and DeNiro's characters were clashes then wait till you see Hoffman, ex-hippie, and DeNiro, CIA of course, clash.

That's where most of the humor lies, although even the stuff that goes wrong this time is more interesting then the last film.  Somehow, they even managed to throw in a few twists.

Like I said, I don't know how they came up with an idea that would save the Meet the Parent's idea, but once again all I have to say is good casting creates good chemistry.  And they found the formula.

Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand are hilarious as Greg's offbeat parents, but they aren't enough to save this movie.

""Meet the Fockers"" also relies on more crude humor than the first film, which was disappointing and unnecessary.

Some of the scenes are just way too over the top and it doesn't fit at all.  The movie is enjoyable though, I found it to be worth my while, it's just that I wouldn't have carried it as far as they did.  There is one scene where the family is eating dinner and talking about the wedding, Barbra Streisand then brings out a memory book of Stiller's childhood.  When the other mother picks up this crusty thing and asks ""oh my, you kept the umbilical cord?"" in which Streisand replies ""oh no, that's Gaylord's forskin from his circumcison.""  Then she throws it up and it lands in the Fondue pot.  While the movie is funny, it can step overboard at times to a point where you want it to step back but it doesn't.

ACTING: The cast from the first movie are all the same, but our new additions are Streisand and Dustin Hoffman as the Fockers.  The two are funny and pull this cuckoo but heartwarming feel.  I think the cast works well, but I'm sorry, I have just had enough of Ben Stiller for one year.

The further adventures of Gay Focker (Stiller) find him journeying with his future in-laws (Robert DeNiro, Blythe Danner) to meet his highly quirky and very embarrassing parents played to the hilt by Barbra Streisand and Dustin Hoffman.

Ben Stiller has yet to show one iota of the comedic talents of dad Jerry Stiller.  (Frank Costanza and his Festivus celebration will long remain a classic as will the infamous bro episode of which a much less funny takeoff is done in this movie.)

Greg worries terribly that his parents will be a total embarrasment to the Byrnes family, who aren't really the type for craziness. No matter how much he prays, crazy things happen. The Byrnes' family cat and the Fockers' dog fight, Pam's baby nephew causes mischief, and Greg holds a terrible secret that might finally be revealed.

I had really wanted to see this. It was top at the box office, and even though the reviews were bad, I kept my hopes up and went to see the movie. I came out disappointed, wishing I had listenedt to the reviewers. There are many jokes, although most aren't very funny, so it's not really worth your money. And worst of all, there is no plot. It all feels like a bunch of running gags stirred into one film. Do not see this movie--there are much better comedies instead.",1104278400,2,1074,4.479591836734694
1567228,2,B00005JN5T,"This movie has a lot of funny moments.  I liked how DeNiro's character loosened up in the end.  The only part that ruined the movie for me was the presence of sexuality in almost every scene.  Streisand's character is a sex therapist.  She has books and statues all over the place.  She constantly turns the conversation toward sexual things.  She and her husband are constantly thinking about, talking about, and starting sex.  I feel sad that people think that sex has to be part of everything.  Comedies such as this would be just as funny without sex, but they always insist on adding it.  At least the first one is better.",1104192000,3,627,4.576576576576577

I kinda liked Meet the Parents, but to me this sequel is much funnier and the the addition of Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand make it a real hoot. It does go a little overboard on the raunchy factor (especially for PG-13), but all the gags got a laugh out of me. I may be in the minority here, but I would say this is the funniest comedy I have seen all year.",1104192000,7,523,4.087378640776699
1567290,1,B00005JN5T,"After watching ""There's Something About Mary"" a few years ago I promised that I would never see another Ben Stiller movie again, and his most recent idiotic incarnation has done nothing to change my mind. Wow ! How far have the careers of Blythe Danner, Barbra Streisand, Dustin Hoffman and Robert De Niro sunk to appear in such a brain dead misadventure ? Is this the same Robert De Niro that was in Godfather II, Taxi Driver, The Deer Hunter, Raging Bull, Casino and Goodfellas ?? Yeesh, he probably needed some fast cash !! The producers surely counted on moviegoers to be so thrilled & amazed [addled ??] to have such old, stale, former power actors appear together that it would be enough to get people to go see this movie, and according to the first weekend box office returns, it worked. I never could understand the humor of Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara, and I still can't understand the oddball humor behind the infantile home movies of their son. Cough up ten bucks if you wish, but better money would be spent washing and waxing your car.",1104192000,2,1050,4.590425531914893
1567291,2,B00005JN5T,"Yes, I saw Meet the Parents, and yes I enjoyed that movie for what it was.  And yes I love Dustin Hoffman and Barbara Streisand and really looked forward to this movie.  And yes I thought I would enjoy Meet the Fockers.  And yes I thought it was just the right stress free movie to see the day before Christmas.  BUT I never expected to walk out and say, ""Wow - that sure was a waste.  I would have been mad if I even spent money to rent this.""

So what went wrong for me.  How could a film miss with the likes of DeNiro, Hoffman, Streisand and Ben Stiller?  I'm still asking myself that question.  And now I'm really perplexed since some close relatives including our daughter loved this film. As far as I'm concerned, I could have stayed home and watched Tootsie, Funny Girl or The Godfather to see these three long time favorites at their very best rather than spend money for this movie.

Sure I began watching the movie laughing and some of the scenes were funny.  How about a cat going down the toilet bowl and coming back blue.  And the Mom bra was cute although I thought of the much better Bro episode from Seinfeld.  And Owen Wilson as a barefoot Rabbi was clever. But as far as continued laughter, midway through I got tired of DeNiro looking like a constipated General and Streisand trying so hard to act New Age as she flitted around complete with 60's jargon.  And then Hoffman was so wasted to say nothing about Ben Stiller and Blythe Danner.  I guess the adage is true -- if it works the first time be sure and make a sequel to make lots of money but this one which should have been left on the cutting room floor.  Two isn't always better than one in my opinion and too often sequels are so bad, including this one.  I hate to sound so negative about this movie and did give it two stars instead of one if only because of how I feel about the cast but still it was a big waste of time and money, My advice, rent older videos from these actors and see the way they were.

Finally, I understand that signing and furbarizing babies is now the in thing.  What will they think of next, huh?  Subjecting your children to watching this film?",1104192000,,2151,4.251231527093596
1567292,3,B00005JN5T,"They should have gone ahead and made this a rated R flick, I mean, the 13 something crowd couldn't possibly like this movie, not that the humor was too ""adult"" for them, it's just that to really get the humor you almost have to have been married or at least been in a serious relationship at some point.

I don't mind stupid raunchy humor, so there were a few good laughs here, however, I don't exactly go for the predictable and ""that would never happen"" type humor, and some of it here is over the top.

The premise is age old and rehashed, what made this movie is that the first film was pretty funny and it carried the characters into this film, that said, if you haven't seen the first one, don't go see this one yet.

As for buying this when it comes out on dvd, well, if you have the first one in your collection, I guess, go ahead and pre-order this second in the series flick, but otherwise, why bother?  It's hardly the kind of movie you need to see twice, at least in my opinion.",1104105600,,990,4.1947368421052635

3.  Dustin Hoffman

1567294,3,B00005JN5T,"Yes, when I saw the coming attractions in the theater, I gasped to see that the Almighty Barbra Streisand was in this movie. She's joined by Dustin Hoffman, and of course Robert De Niro. So how many Oscars do these folks have among them? And yet here they all are, in a Ben Stiller movie. The pay must have been GOOD.

But you've got to hand it to Stiller, because it stayed His Movie. He's the star, to the end.

Is this a bad movie? Oh no, not at all. Is this a good movie? Ah, well, there you might have me. It's a so-so movie. It's got plenty of bathroom humor (including several scenes in bathrooms, as a matter of fact), but many Americans like that sort of thing, judging by the roars of laugher in my Forest Hills movie theater. It's really nothing more or less than another entry in the Two Families That Have Nothing At All In Common Will Now Be Related By Marriage category. You saw it in ""The In-Laws"" with Peter Falk/Alan Arkin back in the 70s. Probably even back in the 60s with ""Lovers and Other Strangers"". You'll see it again, years from now with some other stars who are young now, maybe even Ben Stiller's daughter marrying Keanu Reeve's son or something.

So, if you don't mind sex-filled, poopy pants dialogue and stars that could have done any number of other things but decided to have a good time over the summer, this just might fit the bill.",1104105600,4,1367,4.33203125
1567295,4,B00005JN5T,"This film is, as many may already know, the sequel to the 2000 film called ""Meet The Parents"" in which Greg Focker (played by Ben Stiller) struggles to get the approval of his girlfriend's father (played by Robert De Niro). Teri Polo does a good job of playing Greg's girlfriend, Pam Byrnes.

In the sequel it is now time for Pam's parents to travel to meet her boyfriend Greg's parents. Predictably, the two sets of potential in-laws couldn't be further apart. Greg's parents are a throwback to a commune-type 1960's relationship while that is hardly what Pam's parents are about.

The film is well cast and that's a treat: Barbra Streisand plays Greg's mother; she is very funny and keeps up her part of the jokes! Dustin Hoffman is Greg's father, Mr. Focker; it's great to see him, too. He does a fine job. Robert De Niro of course plays Pam's Dad and Blythe Danner plays Pam's Mom.

Without spoiling it for you, there are numerous funny moments that will entertain you if you keep in mind that this is a somewhat amusing comedy. Some of the jokes could be considered crude by some people but then again the title is a hint at that!

I would recommend that you go see this movie for some fun, light hearted entertainment. It may not be the very best comedy you'll see ever in your entire lifetime, but it's one of the better ways to overcome a dull afternoon!",1104019200,6,1362,4.502024291497976
1567296,2,B00005JN5T,"I can usually find something good about movies but to do that in this movie is beyond me. I am so glad that the theater was so packed that my parents could not sit next to me because that movie was embarassing. The entire movie was full of crude humor. Not to mention the statues of things I did not want to see and the sick books. I also could have sworn I saw some women flashing (on the bus scene) but if not, there are parts in this movie that the women have parts just hanging out. This movie should have been rated R because I sure would never have let my children see this farce of a movie. I am appalled and I am only seventeen. But to give a different point of view, my mother liked this movie for some reason. Only thing she told me was how true to life it is that cops would stun you for no reason.

The movie really dragged on and had no specific plot. I really started to get bored with the dog in heat jokes and it was nasty watching the dog humping a leg or the cat. Some issues were not resolved like the rental car's window getting broken (one of the funny moments). Moreover, in the beginning of the movie, the family is commenting about all these people that the audience does not understand so it was confusing. But maybe if I had watched the first one, I would have understood it.

The reason I gave this movie two stars is because it had a couple of funny moments but not nearly enough for almost a two hour movie. The baby was funny with his hand motions and the one word he knows is a curse word.

Some parts are unbelievable in case anyone hates that, though I didn't mind it. The dog getting flushed down a toliet and the CIA technology along with the truth serum bit.

Overall, I think if you are an adult who doesn't mind crude, raunchy jokes and just wants to watch a maybe funny movie that doesn't make you think too hard, you should watch it.",1104019200,,1873,4.123287671232877

To those that give this movie a bad review based on adult humor... I think you are truly out of your mind. What do you expect when you know that the movie's title is Meet the Fockers. Were you expecting a kids movie? Get over it. Sexuality is a beautiful part of who we are and humor about it is fanfockingtastic. If you don't like that kind of thing, I suggest you not see movies that are geared toward adults and stick with the kids flicks until you can grow up and see that there is NOTHING wrong with sexuality or having a sense of humor about it. Also, for those of you interested, I found a site that is awesome and carries the products shown in the movie based on sex therapist Barbara Steisand at holisticwisdom.com. An adult (not dirty) site worth your time if you are able to accept that sexuality is a natural and wonderful part of who we are.",1103932800,8,860,4.2439024390243905

There was no subliminal thoughts passed on to you, no anguish, no sex, no violence, no subplot.... just flat out dumb humor.  Every once in a while you need that type of experience.

So if you found Meet the Parents funny then you will love Meet the Fockers. I can't wait in till some of my other friends go to see it so I can watch it again.

It's an embarrassing film with the sickest of Hollywood ""humor."" This flick should have received at least an ""R"" rating due to the continuous perverted adult content. It says a lot if in supposed-to-be ""funny"" scenes the whole theatre was quiet and nobody laughed. Sure, there were a few laughs here and there, but it was all messed up with the tasteless sick stuff this screenwriter put into it. Not just one scene, but one scene after the other as if the creator of this film really had a mental problem. And the script has a number of flaws as e.g. a trip from New York to Florida is played out in less than 5 minutes in the film. If you do want to see this film, don't take your kids with you -- it's absolutely not suitable. It's not the kind of comedy the trailer seems to indicate.

1567365,5,B00005JN5T,"Meet The Fockers(2004). The Sequel To 2000's 'Meet The Parents'.

In 2000, 'Meet The Parents' became a surprise hit, becoming one of the year's top movies alongside 'The Matrix', and become the highest grossing comedy of 2000. While I expected it to be a dumbed down comedy, I found 'Meet The Parents' to be a great social commentary on the hardships of marriage, and the film was as hilarious as it was made out to be. Obviously, there had to be a sequel, and 2004's 'Meet The Fockers' fills that void. Opening up right before Christmas, 'Meet The Fockers' overtook 'The Series of Unfortuneate Events' to become America's #1 movie, and it has grossed almost 40 million to date. So, did I like the sequel as much as the original? Read on to find out!

Plot- Gaylord Focker, the quirky male nurse, and Pam Byrnes, his fiance, are preparing to travel to Miami, where Pam and her entire family can meet Greg(Gaylord)'s parents, Bernie and Roz Focker. Greg and Pam meet up with Pam's parents, Jack and Dina Byrnes, and they hit the road on Jack's high-tech RV. When the Byrnes get to the Focker's house, they are immediately greeted with the Focker's quirky and odd behavior, and the uptight Jack seems to be unhappy with them, especially after Bernie destroys his RV and Roz nearly breaks his back. As Greg tries to get the two families to get along, Greg is being closely watched by Jack, and Jack believes Greg to have conceived a son with his babysitter, so he continually puts a strain on the family. As Greg and Pam get ever closer to their marriage, they are burdened with too many secrets to keep, and they soon come all spilling out. Will they be able to get through? Go see the movie to find out!

Opinion-

Like the original, 'Meet The Fockers' is a fun, hilarious, and touching movie that seems to never even touch the surface of boredom. Robert Deniro and Ben Stiller give excellent performances, and each represents a person in your family everybody can relate to. Dustin Hoffman and Barbara Streisand also work extremely well as Greg's parents, and their weird traditions will keep the laughs coming until the end. 'Meet The Fockers' relates to anybody, because, in a nutshell, it combines all those goofy family tales familes tell and combines them all into one big, catastrophic story. Like the original, the story does sacrifice the laughs for a few touching moments, and the story teaches many valuable lessons. I really don't think it gets better than this!

Overall, 'Meet The Fockers' was an utter joy to watch, and the entire audience never stopped laughing during the movie. I went with my family to watch it, and, if you have a mature family, this film would be a great movie to see after Christmas.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO PEOPLE WHO ARE LOOKING FOR A GOOD LAUGH AND A COMEDY THAT THE WHOLE FAMILY WOULD ENJOY! GO SEE IT!

1567366,4,B00005JN5T,"I have been listening to interviews that Ben Stiller has been giving for the last couple of years.  Being a big fan of ""Meet The Parents,"" I wanted to hear what was happening with the long awaited sequel.  He kept saying ""We are delaying the making of the movie, because we want to get a script that we really like and is really good.""  At first I thought that was code for ""We can't seem to think of a good script and the sequel in not going to be any good.""  I'm glad that I was wrong with that assumption.

The movie has a really simple storyline:  Greg (Stiller) and Pam (Polo) are going to get married after a two year delay and its time for Pam's parents to meet Greg's parents.  Pam's dad Jack (DeNiro) is worried that Greg's family is going to ruin his families legacy.  That they will put a ""chink"" in the family chain.  And his worries are soon confirmed when he actually meets Greg's parents.  Greg's dad Bernard (Hoffman) is a very honest, a little too honest person, that likes to tell embarressing stories and is a stay-at-home dad.  Greg's mother, Roz (Streisand) is a senior sex consultant, who wants to know everything about Greg and the Byrnes' sex life.  So Greg has to try to make his family seem acceptable to Jack.  Obviously, that doesn't work too well and many funny sequences occur thereafter.

All of the characters that return in this movie are basically the same characters.  The only major difference is that Pam's sister, Deborah, had a baby and Jack is watching it.  Stiller and DeNiro do another great job at their characters.  This is the kind of role that Stiller was born to play and also his funniest character that he plays.  Jay Roach also returned for this movie.  He optioned to make this movie instead of making Austin Powers 4, which looks like will never see the light of day.  Thank God!

I would definately recommend seeing this movie.  It was really funny, the funniest movie that I have seen this year since ""Dodgeball"".  Hollywood should also take this movie as a hint.  Take time to make a really good movie, rather than shoveling out a crappy sequel the following year.  The audiences will be patient for quality.",1103760000,23,2163,4.512886597938144

As soon as the baby sees some big [...] he is making the Yammie Milk sign...very over done and this has all been done before! Give us some new material please!

It started out with the joke on Gaylord's name and as a guy nurse, which was filled with laughs for the whole theater. Gaylord, or Greg...is going to marry Pam, so it was time for Pam's father Jack and mom Dina Byrnes, to meet the Fockers, Greg's parents. They drove a RV van all the way to Miami with Pam's infant nephew, the intelligent Little Jack. Throughout the movie, Little Jack takes out the funny parts and adds in baby jokes. When they all arrived to the Fockers, the Byrnes discovered that Greg's parents are kind of, over-loved...um, a word here means, too friendly...in a funny way. The whole movie is Greg trying to motivate Jack into liking his family, but while Jack is a bit too old-styled, and stands in his own way, it is hard to deal. Each little scenes is filled with funny lines, faces, moves, and more. It just makes one laugh ever other seconds!

I suggest you guys not to bring children's to this movie, because it is uses sexual humor, as said on the rated PG-13.",1103760000,,1266,4.360169491525424
