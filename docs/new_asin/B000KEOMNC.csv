2688672,1,B000KEOMNC,I ordered this mix twice - from a different seller each time - and got mix 1 both times!  There is definitely something wrong with this particular set-up so save yourself the trouble and order from somewhere else.,1277942400,3,213,4.605263157894737

2688674,5,B000KEOMNC,"I am in pretty good shape in terms of cardio fitness but have bad knees, so I have trouble finding good workout DVDs that really get my heart rate up without lots of jacks, jogging, squats etc. This DVD is the best I've found on that score so far.  There are points where some of the above are used, but the modifications are such that I still get a good workout (unlike those DVDs where the modifications amount basically to standing around while the people on the DVD do a million jacks etc.).  Although Chalene is a bit cheesy (""Just shake it!""), I find her genuinely encouraging, and the whole DVD has a warm atmosphere that makes you feel part of the ""party"".  If you want a fun cardio kick-boxing DVD that won't kill your knees but still get your heart rate up, I recommend this one.",1240012800,10,789,4.35374149659864
2688675,5,B000KEOMNC,"Two years ago, I was in really good shape, aerobically.  I did a very hard class at our local gym that was wonderful.  Not only did it make you sweat like crazy, it was fun and lifted the spirits like crazy.  I have been looking for something I could do at home that would be similar, and I have finally found it.  Turbo Jam is not for the faint of heart.  But, as with most workouts, the leader offers low impact options.  You can most certainly get this and work your way up very slowly.  I only did the first 20 minutes the first day, then added on a few minutes every other time.  It is enjoyable and you feel very virtuous when you are done!  Highly recommended!",1227398400,6,667,4.1484375
2688676,1,B000KEOMNC,"THEY SENT ME CARDIO PARTY ONE NOT THREE AS STATED I AM BEYOND LIVID! I had waited and waited to get this and it's the one I have done 1000 times! I have this already on dvd! I was looking forward to something new! I AM SEVERELY DISAPPOINTED that I got the same one I already own and am bored with, have to return this and pay $6, and wait a month for it to be credited back on my card! THEN I HAVE TO BUY ANOTHER ONE FROM SOMEONE ELSE! THEN I HAVE TO WAIT AGAIN FOR IT TO COME IN THE MAIL SO I AM ABLE TO DO THIS WORKOUT! PAY ATTENTION!",1214006400,,536,3.710526315789474
2688677,5,B000KEOMNC,"Cardio Party was the first Turbo Jam video I've tried. I was looking for a fun kickboxing workout, and overall, I was not disappointed. The workout wasn't as dancey as I had expected--there are occasional brief interludes where you are encouraged to move to your own beat--but the entire atmosphere is more akin to a dance club than to a workout studio.

This workout is about 43 minutes long, and I realy liked how it was broken down: each chapter is a 6-7 minute segment that is separately choreographed, so once you are done with that segment, you move on to a new routine. I have provided an overview for the moves contained in each segment below (times are approximate, and I didn't necessarily include *every* move):

Warm-Up, 4 minutes. Charlene begins by warming you up with each of the 4 basic punches (jab, cross, hook, upper) and simple side steps. A few moving stretches are included towards the end.

1st cardio segment, 7 minutes. As with most of the segments, you'll learn two combinations which you then connect together. The first combination consists of ""wheel"" (a standing side crunch) combined with cross and hook punches. This combo connects to a march with alternating knee lifts and then double knee lifts to either side; at the end, Chalene changes the march to a jog.

2nd cardio segment, 7.5 minutes. The first combination here consists of a partial squat to either side; side kicks are then added to the squat. Building on this, you'll do the squat/side kicks, then squat front and back, add front/back push kicks, and then add knee lifts with front/back push kicks. Last comes a move Chalene calls a ""twist""--you'll move front with jab-cross-jab punches and then do a knee lift, first just on the one side but then on both sides with arms added in. The entire sequence is then repeated to the other side.

3rd cardio segment, 7.5 minutes. You'll start here with speed bag, adding an upper cut to the end of the move and then adding a front knee/back kick. After doing two knees to either side, you'll add in ""Tai"" punches--slow punches and blocks to the front while in ""horse"" stance (straddle squat).

Turbo, 1.5 minutes. For the turbo, a siren goes off and you kick up the intensity, doing jogs and hopping knee lifts. However, two of the women in the large class always do a low-impact version of the moves.

Water break, 30 seconds. Following the Turbo, there is a pause allowing you to get a drink of water, although Chalene encourages you to keep moving during this time.

Recovery Dance Party, 6 minutes (but for some reason, this segment continues partly into the next chapter). I didn't really notice much difference between this and the other cardio segments; after a brief freestyle dance at the very beginning, Chalene moves back into kickboxing combinations. Here, she does cross, hook, and uppercut punches to one corner, speed bags to repeat in the opposite corner, and then does ""zig zag"" knees--basically, a side crunch combined with a knee lift to one side; eventually, a back kick is added on as well.

Final cardio segment, 4 minutes. This is a quick segment performed entirely in horse stance. First, you do a front speedbag followed by quick cross punches. Staying in horse stance, you do a high-low punch to the side, then add zig zag knees; for the last couple of reps, Chalene does a hop when doing the knee lift.

Aerobic cool-down, 3 minutes. Chalene describes the moves in this section as ""finesse."" There are some arm swings to the front plus some low front and back kicks, but everything is performed at a slower, more relaxed pace.

Stretch, 1.5 minutes. Here, Chalene borrows from Tai Chi and talks about focusing your energy; she does just a few very brief stretches such as a hamstring stretch.

Overall, this is a high-intenstiy workout that is mostly low-impact--there are a few jacks/hops thrown in here and there, but as previously mentioned, two of the participants always show funky, low-impact alternatives. The mood of this workout is definitely high energy, and the music is loud and upbeat, with a few recognizable songs (eg, a very fast version of ""Busta Move""). Also, there is a countdown bar at the bottom of the screen which lets you know how much time is left in the current segment as well as previews the upcoming moves. If you enjoy kickboxing but are looking for a style that's more fun and funky than serious, this might be the perfect video for you.

Additional comments about the instructor: Chalene is clearly enthusiastic and has a ton of energy. She makes frequent comments to say that she *knows* you are having fun, and there are several points where she bursts out singing along to the moves. I would say that she's pretty over-the-top, but I didn't find her to be annoyingly so.

You may have heard that Charlene's cueing is poor; she actually *does* cue, but I wasn't always sure what she was talking about. For example, she cued ""twist,"" which turned out to be a punching move. If I had done her ""Learn and Burn"" video first, I'm sure I would have found it much easier to follow along with this workout, but as it was, I was able to pick up the combinations pretty quickly the very first time through.",1170979200,25,5194,4.6996699669967

league right now.  Fast paced and you really need to be familiar with her routine or else it's
frustrating to follow along.
Recommend for someone who has done Turbo Jam or others like it before.  Not for beginners
looking for an easy going workout.  But I can't wait to try it out again once I learn the steps.
Fun and energetic!",1295222400,,434,4.070588235294117
2688688,1,B000KEOMNC,"Okay, I order this product and got Turbo Jam cardio party mix 1 and I wanted Cardio mix 3. Very upset about this happening.  After several e-mails, I was told they do not have the Turbo Jam Cardio Mix 3 in stock anymore, which is a lie they never had it in the first place.  Buyers beware!!! They are sending the wrong tape and maybe hoping someone won't return it. Not sure, but I am upset that I just now found this review place as I had only been looking at the sellers performance. I am really upset because I was looking forward to adding this one to my collection.",1278892800,3,570,4.172727272727273

8155907,1,B000KEOMNC,"I was helping a friend deployed overseas to get a copy of this workout video I looked all over and passed up several ads because they specifically stated, clearly and in the the headlines that it was VHS video. Not so here In the description on the page I was looking at it did not specifically state that it was a VHS tape and when I got it, I found out my friend had already found a copy elsewhere. I definitely couldn't use it one because it was VHS, but two, because I already have this workout (I have all her workouts including PIYO)

When I tried contacting the seller I got a message that you couldn't directly contact them, took a couple days to get them at which time I was told they would accept it back but at my expense and for a restocking fee at that point, i will have not really recouped any money, so I will probably just sell it myself and at least get my money back.

(I did just notice a big black bolded sentence saying this was a VHS, but it was not there when I bought it)

The video itself is kick butt! I LOVE Chalene! Do her Turbos often and just started Turbo Fire recently- A- MAAAZING!

and P.S. her name is Chalene Johnson, not Charlene Johnson (no r)",1410048000,,1182,4.148471615720524
