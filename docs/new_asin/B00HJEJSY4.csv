8633091,5,B00HJEJSY4,"I discovered Ayman and Sherine during their coverage of the 2008-2009 war. I had only recently subscribed to Al Jazeera English and was able to contrast their reporting from within Gaza (the only international journalists there) and what the other channels were saying and showing (CNN, BBC, Swiss and French channels) since I live in Europe. They did an enormous service to the world by showing the war from the Gaza perspective. They became heroes for me and I watched for Aymon's coverage during the 2014 war. Such courage, excellent journalists and humanists. I was very happy to find this video ... while I was oking for why NBC had pulled Ayman out of Gaza until the social media protests got loud and they sent him back in.
Excellent film, an important documentary.",1409011200,2,772,4.81203007518797
8633092,5,B00HJEJSY4,"DOCUMENTARY MOVIE MORE INTIMATE AND GRAPHIC THAN WHAT YOU WILL SEE ON CNN

IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND BEFORE YOU WATCH: Let me explain up front that this is inescapably a Palestinian perspective of life in Gaza while combat is underway in late 2008 because of the positioning of the reporters who are stuck there at the time, simply recording what they see. They are Al Jazeera reporters as well.  Let me also qualify what I say by explaining that I have spent over 10 years in combat zones as a soldier and civilian.  I was also raised in a strong Christian faith that has close ties and reverence for Jews and the state of Israel.  Regardless of the Palestinian viewpoint, I felt most of this movie stuck to showing the helplessness of the situation for average residents in a tiny area with no place to run.  They are caught between two warring sides and you see it unvarnished and mostly uncensored.  Towards the latter part of the documentary, it does start to point fingers and hurl more indictments at Israel in regards to the use of white phosphorus (which was later authenticated and officially recognized by Israel though first denied).  regardless, I did not feel this was a hatchet job.  In fact, I felt that much of the time the two reporters go through pains to avoid the political side and simply show the tragedy of those who cannot avoid being caught up in the violence.  For those who have only the Israeli opinion, you will not care for this movie.  For those with a strong sympathy for Hamas, you probably will think it doesn't go far enough.  As always, the truth usually lies somewhere in between.

THE STORY:  This documentary follows two Al Jazeera reporters (an Arabic News Outlet) who are in Gaza before the start of hostilities in 2008.  During this conflict, international news agencies were not allowed into Gaza.  However, Sherine Tadros and Ayman Mohyeldin are there for what they expect are just a few days on assignment.  As war breaks out, they cannot leave Gaza even if they wanted to.  They are uniquely positioned to cover the war as it rumbles around them.  The events and shelling happen even as they are out and about with the Palestinian people so you are going to see the shells and rockets land.  You are going to see people as they get hurt or as they are actually pulled out of the rubble, dead or alive.  You will feel the helplessness because they are moving with the people of the area as they try to cope with what is happening.

I admit, sometimes watching CNN now in the 2014 conflict in Gaza, sometimes It feels a little produced with a little more hysterics as they often arrive after the shelling has happened or at a funeral procession the day after.  Perhaps I feel, unfairly, that locals are putting on even more hysterics because they know CNN and a world audience is now watching.  Of course their grief is still real.  This footage is not like that at all.  The locals are not interested in the camera at all.  They even seem to avoid them in their personal grief.  Though as a soldier I am fairly sure the worst of the gore is spared from the camera, you are still there in the hospital at the moment a father's deceased daughter is pried from his arms and he is told she is dead.  There is nothing fake in his haunted eyes.  The bodies just after mortars hit are not blurred.  They are there as a dirt covered man is pulled from under building rubble still alive.  Plenty of others are not so lucky.  To be frank, there is not much like this movie in mainstream media.  It is painful and heartrending at moments.  However, I think it's not such a bad thing for us to remember that innocent people always get hurt the most when we go to war, just or not.  Again, I say that as someone who still believes in defending the defenseless or fighting for a just cause.

My recommendation is to leave the political judgments aside and watch this for the perspective of those who get caught in the middle.  It is still very graphic and there are many dead children in the footage.  If you can't handle it, you may want to take a pass. I would never shed a single tear for Hamas, but I admit to plenty of emotion for those in this footage who can't even help themselves.  Outlets like CNN have been allowed inside Gaza during later conflicts such as 2014, and they never had unproduced access like this.  It is sad to realize as the reporters say 2008 was the most intense and deadly conflict since 1948, we now know the 2014 conflict (which started after this movie was made) was actually much worse, and it's not the end of it.",1407542400,4,4578,4.468674698795181
8633093,5,B00HJEJSY4,"Eye-opening look at what happens inside a war from the point of view of civilians living it without any chance of escaping it. Brilliant reporting by Ayman Mohyeldin and Sherine Tadros, showing what happens behind the scenes and the emotional side of what they go through as humans rather than just journalists, seeing death and destruction all around them. A must see for anyone looking to educate themselves of what actually happens in these wars rather than what the mainstream media will show you.",1407196800,5,501,4.976190476190476
8633094,5,B00HJEJSY4,I have already seen bits and pieces of this movie online - it is WELL WORTH the purchase to watch 2 amazing journalists report with no bias and truthfully. Also listen to the hauntingly beautiful music of Austin Wintory. A must have for every home movie library,1388102400,9,261,4.574468085106383
