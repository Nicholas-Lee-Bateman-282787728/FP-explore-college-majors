8049665,3,B0007OP1D0,"Goofy ""film almost-noire."" Racial and ethnic and gender stereotypes, suave smoking (not), and totally implausible plot. But hey, it was made in 1940. Find it at your local library or on Youtube. (The irony in the next-to-last scene provides a chuckle; and since this was made before ""North by Northwest,"" the last scene should get some credit.)",1509667200,,344,5.052631578947368
8049666,2,B0007OP1D0,"People are being robbed on the Midnight Limited. So on of the robbies, Joan Marshall, (Marjorie Reynolds) teman up the the top railroad detedtive Val Lennon (John 'Dusty' King) to track down the culprit.

They may get more then they ask for; it may posibley be murder.

Stilted wording, cheap singing, too many clues, and dumb plot. The advantabe of the dumb plot si you get to say That is a dumb plot.",1484265600,,402,4.493150684931507
8049667,2,B0007OP1D0,"A very 'B' movie. Some B movies are really entertaining. This one is not. I bought it because I like Marjorie Weaver, but she seems very subdued here, unlike her roles in the Chan series. The plot left a lot of holes, places where you are saying 'wait a minute'. John King is pretty boring as a lead - Lloyd Nolan could have made this part way more interesting. But I keep hoping I'll find a gem in this genre, and every once in a while I do.",1429747200,,442,4.034090909090909
8049668,3,B0007OP1D0,"It's ok, the female lead adds no value to the actual story and is pretty useless but I guess they felt it was a way to add the romantic angle. You must remember, not too much depth would go into to the plot, it is after all a B movie. Sad to say because the plot is good enough that they could have made a really good movie with just a little more work on it. I watched it, it's not the best but it's not the worst I've seen.",1406764800,2,425,3.7333333333333334
8049669,4,B0007OP1D0,Pretty good story line with some suspenseful moments. Good interplay among the characters. The filming was done in such a way as to keep the picture bright even in the darker moments.,1389312000,2,183,4.75
8049670,4,B0007OP1D0,"It takes a while for the bad guys to get caught, but stay in there it all ends well. The sound and picture are good. If you like 30s, 40s, and 50s, movies you will want to add this one to your collection.",1367884800,3,204,3.7674418604651163
8049671,2,B0007OP1D0,"The Midnight Limited, an overnight train from New York City (?) to Montreal is plagued by a robber and killer who disappears in the night after commiting his crimes. Ace railroad detective John King (Ace Drummond in the serial of that name) investigates and has time to romance passenger/robbery victim Marjorie Reynolds and sing half a song along the way. It's an okay Monogram programmer, nothing special but it doesn't put you to sleep either with its short running time of 61 minutes. Not much of interest to train fans, just a few stock shots of a moving train and a couple of train terminal (depot) scenes, probably shot on the studio back lot. It's a typical Alpha transfer...looks like it originated on VHS tape, maybe even at the 4 hour speed. Not as bad as some Alpha titles though.",1120780800,22,792,4.664285714285715
