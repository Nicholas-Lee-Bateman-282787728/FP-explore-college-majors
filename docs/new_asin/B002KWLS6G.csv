8372278,2,B002KWLS6G,"This DVD has four segments based on four automotive companies: Buick, Oldsmobile, Pontiac, Cadillac. Each is a separate program and the value/quality of these vary greatly.

The segments on Buick and Pontiac were very good, giving history of the marque as well as design philosophies and significant models for both labels. These give the viewer a good understanding of the challenges and successes at various points in time for these companies as well as highlighting important models produced. The viewer is treated to both period footage of cars and close-ups of restored models.

The segment for Oldsmobile was actually a GM-produced, promotional short film from the 50's titled ""The Lady And The Rocket"". This was, unless you are a fan of period promo films, boring and a waste of the viewer's time and money. It was simply ""filler"" on the DVD.

The segment on Cadillac was very poor. As a matter of fact, I don't remember enough of it to comment on it! It was that bad!

Overall, two segments were quite good while two others were duds. I leave it up to a potential buyer to decide if the two that were good are worth the money for the whole package or not. I personally would not reccommend it.",1263686400,2,1201,4.704761904761905
