7924713,3,B00004VYI2,"This movie was made by the French, and is heavily slanted towards French interests ,and French expats living in Kolwezi. Belgians are barely mentioned.
The movie opens with a view of a strip mine (probably lifted from an old documentary). That much is authentic.
 The movie does not appear to have been shot on location -nor even in the Congo- I lived in Kolwezi during the early Katanga  wars (years before this Kolwezi affair) and I do not recognize any of the Kolwezi landmarks nor aerial views. The paras are warned that Kolwezi is 500 meters above sea level (actually: 1,500 meters, which does not help) and there are many other inaccuracies. The French  ""officials"" do not resemble their models, and pronounce ""Kolvezi"" like Parisians.
The movie does a fairly good job of recreating the atmosphere of the (many) Katanga ""events"", but for accuracy, I recommend reading instead the excellent book ""La Legion saute sur Kolwezi"", available on Amazon., by Pierre Sergent. It is a lot more complete and precise (maps etc.)",1383004800,3,1022,4.930232558139535
