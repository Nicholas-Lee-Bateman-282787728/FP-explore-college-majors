8156300,3,B0002YCUVG,"Video quality is poor, like a transfer from VHS and it's rather distracting especially on a big TV. Sound has a noticeable 60 Hz hum which is frankly annoying.

Content is OK better than most Youtube videos but note it really is 'beginning' clawhammer. If you know tuning, the basic strum, the bum-ditty etc. this will be only a review. I was hoping the close-ups were more revealing on left-hand actions.

I'd give more stars except for the grainy video and poor sound. I guess with the latter you can always cut the bass on your tv.",1436486400,,534,4.494845360824742
8156301,5,B0002YCUVG,clear and concise directions and the accompanying workbook is great. It's so fun.  I don't ever want to put the banjo down.,1390867200,,123,4.590909090909091
