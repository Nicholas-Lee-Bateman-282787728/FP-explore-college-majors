2348667,5,B000A0GP4K,"Great! Watching Dylan himself tell the story of his life up to '66 seems almost Bizarre after so many decades of silence. The footage is incredible, I have seen most ""rockumentaries"" for the past 25 years, I really think this is the best, it is better than ""Beatles Anthology"" too, for me anyway. I couldn't believe that half the stuff on this movie existed on film, & since it does, why was it it was never seen before? Was Dylan waiting till the last part of his career? It is the best music-related product to come out in many a year, (many a decade). This is my opinion anyway, I think if you like good music, you will agree.",1127260800,7,629,4.294117647058823
2348668,4,B000A0GP4K,"If you like Bob, you'll like this. I just finished watching it and have seen it all except for the bonus material -- which I'm really looking forward to watching... in about a week.  I definitely recommend letting time pass between watching the two parts.  This is a lot of Dylan to absorb in one sitting.  You might want to pace it out.

The first half is essentially a pretty fascinating history of the folk music scene (and I'm not even a folk fan) and the ways that Dylan fit himself into the whole thing like a puzzle piece.  The second half is a look into how the avalanche that Dylan created caught up with him, and how he dealt with the chaos and the positions it forced him into.

Yes, you actually get to see Dylan being asked by a newspaper photographer to, ""Suck on your glasses.""

There's some great, widely bootlegged footage, lots of very nicely cleaned up stuff from ""Eat the Document"" (no Lennon in the limo, though).  I think the most surprising stuff are the early outtakes of ""Subterranean"" in different locations from the famous alley, with Dylan flubbing the timing of the cue cards.  Quite hilarious, I didn't know it existed.  There are also clips of his Warhol screen test.

In the end, ""Direction"" gives a lot of information but it doesn't really give many answers.  Sara is completely ignored.  The accident; the drugs; the individual latter albums are all blurred together.  Still, the bottom line, the beat is good and you can dance to it.

And while I won't downgrade this disk for the previews, I too was wondering, ""Why the hell are there previews for 'MacGuyver' in front of what's supposed to be a definitive musical document?""",1127174400,10,1661,4.6020408163265305
2348669,5,B000A0GP4K,"I just got this DVD today, having received the CD set last week.  I thought I knew what to expect, but it is so much more.  It's an historical  event the likes of which I haven't experienced in quite some time.  An emotional journey through the 60's, and even before.  Being of the generation from which he came, I can honestly say I have grown up, and grown old with Bobby Dylan, and have loved him forever.  Still, I was surprised at how wonderful this was, and it can only be Martin Scorsese's genius film making that makes Bob's story so accessible. The usual cliche's won't work - this is just something everyone that has ever loved him should own.  It's a very important piece, and it's an emotional wringer.  I can't wait to share this with everyone I know.  It's that good.",1127174400,7,781,4.405594405594406
2348670,5,B000A0GP4K,"This is a remarkable film in all aspects. Scorsese does a wonderful job of illuminating Bob Dylan's career through 1966. In the process he not only reveals a lot about Dylan as a person, but about the times in which Dylan was a part. The interviews (including with Dylan), the archival materials, the choice of music, the editing, and so on are outstanding. The film conveys a lot of passion and compassion for Dylan, for his colleagues, his fans, and even his detractors. It is hard to believe that it could be done so well, but given the director, perhaps it is not too surprising after all. Buy it, and treasure it.",1127174400,7,618,4.526785714285714

2348672,5,B000A0GP4K,"I was lucky enough to catch this film at my local movie theatre, which was screening the Telluride Film Festival. Of course, the subject of the film makes it that much more compelling. I  was really knocked out by the precious film footage of early Dylan performances. The film spends considerable time on Dylan's very early years and the burgeoning folk scene. I was also glad to see that Al Kooper gets his due in this film. There is also great (recent) interview footage of many Greenwich Village characters of the era. The film is hysterically funny in some parts as well. But probably the most interesting aspects are of the footage of his Royal Albert Hall concert and the press conferences he endured as well as the boos and jeers after going electric. Just a magnificent piece of work. When will Scorcese get his due? But - he also owes a debt to those who had the cameras rolling way back when, too!",1127174400,,908,4.536585365853658
2348673,5,B000A0GP4K,"Found this at The Rogovoy Report (He is a cultural critic for WAMC Northeast Public Radio)

I've seen the complete No Direction Home Martin Scorsese documentary, upcoming on American Masters on PBS in a couple of weeks (9/26-27), and it's really great. I didn't realize that it includes extensive new interview footage with Bob Dylan himself, appearing in his most straightforward, seemingly normal role EVER -- even more than on the 60 Minutes interview with Ed Bradley -- normal enough almost to take him at his word on his extensive comments on particular songs, his background, incidents in his career, etc.

The film includes terrific interviews with dozens of key figures from Dylan's life and career, including Izzy Young, Harold Leventhal, Joan Baez, Paul Nelson, Bob Neuwirth, Al Kooper, Bruce Langhorne, Pete Seeger, Mark Spoelstra, Suze Rotolo , and fortunately, Allen Ginsberg and Dave Van Ronk when both of them were still around.

The film also includes a tremendous amount of vintage film clips, concert footage, and still photography, a lot of which I've never seen before -- and I think I have had access to most if not all of the unofficial stuff circulating from that era. It even includes footage from postwar Hibbing, as well as early recordings (some of which of course are reflected in the companion CD ""soundtrack""). It includes a lot of Newport Folk festivals and ""Eat the Document"" era concert and incidental footage in the best quality I've ever seen or heard any of it, and a lot that I don't think was included in the original ETD.

The home DVD version also includes extensive full-song versions of concert songs that will not be screened on TV.

More important than all these parts, the sum total is a fascinating ""interpretation"" of how Robert Allen Zimmerman became Bob Dylan up through and including summer 1966, weaved subtly by master filmmaker Scorsese simply through vintage clips, interviews, and really smart editing. The way Scorsese handles the combination of interviews and songs reminds me of The Last Waltz, but he does an even better, more subtle (and more complex) job here.

I think it's as valuable a document that has ever been made about Bob Dylan -- as valuable as any book or biography, including Chronicles itself.

Now, if only Scorsese spent equal time and effort on 1966-2006, but I imagine that's not likely to happen.....

I've gotten some feedback already that Scorsese didn't originate this project and had nothing to do with the original footage, but of course that doesn't matter -- the point is he and/or his team organized it in a way that makes it a coherent narrative, and one with a particular point of view that has the imprimatur of Bob Dylan himself. For those who take issue with that, I suggest, as Dylan himself said all those years ago, eat the document.",1126569600,236,2829,4.879166666666666
2348674,5,B000A0GP4K,"I was very frustrated by the lack of credible reviews, so I hunted down a review from the UK Observer newspaper:

""Bob Dylan is a private man who is notoriously camera shy. The TV interview he gave around the publication of his autobiography, Chronicles, last year was his first in two decades, so there was some surprise when Martin Scorsese announced he was making the definitive TV biopic with the man's full co-operation. It seems that in his sixties, Dylan - who has spent so much of his career laying false trails and telling downright lies about himself - has decided it's time to set the record straight and get his version of his life and times on the record, both in print and on film. And Scorsese, who directed The Last Waltz, the 1977 film about Dylan's former backing group, the Band, was the obvious man to do it.

Almost four hours long, No Direction Home deals only with the early part of Dylan's career, ending in 1966 and the tumultuous world tour on which he was booed by folk purists unable to accept his new-found rock'n'roll ways. It airs on BBC2 next month and is a riveting piece of film-making that draws on wonderful contemporary footage, much of it previously unseen, as well as revelatory new interviews. Scorsese and his team also turned up a treasure trove of unreleased music, which constitutes the latest volume in the 'official bootleg series' Dylan launched in 1991 to combat the pirates who have conferred on him the dubious honour of being the most bootlegged artist in history.""",1126224000,210,1516,4.695488721804511

2348689,4,B000A0GP4K,"'Great background story on Bob Dylan-- as you know, we received little press, or very spotty press at best , about music, little news or coverage on the performances that were done around the world by the stars, and about their actual back-story. We received a hodge-podge of press. Obviuously few had a chance to  see the performances in New York City, which this movie finally explains to me anyway, was the epicenter of jazz, folk, and with the Brill Building almost all pop. (Look up Brill Building).  We finally see in a visual way the basis of Bob's training and inspirations, and about his world around him that bled into his music. Bob's evolution into electric sound caused trama to the Folk world, yet the electric music was organic, exciting , beautiful, and even more reflective of the social energies about us, those forces of the Vietnam War, the vibrations of the worlds politics creeping into his psyche and ours, whether recognized by Bob or not.
This movie follows his career from the start as a youth and ending with possibly his last concert on the European tour, a concert showcasing the cathartic electric music we know and love, but which was his last tour for 8-years after the motorcycle crash which would be the marker until his next musical phase.",1479168000,2,1274,4.7342342342342345

From his blossoming as a singer/song writer, greatly influenced by Woody Guthrie, to the 'Judas' of the electric era, this DVD keeps you enthralled.  While much of the footage and information is nothing new to many fans, it is still entertaining and enjoyable, as it chronologically charts this fascinating period of Dylan's life.  Although Dylan has recently released 'cover' albums, he, for me, is at his best when he is speaking his own words, and this DVD allows him to do just that.  It shows him expressing himself, sometimes quite forcefully, but it shows him to be human, just like the rest of us, with the same concerns and fears, the same emotions, and I find that endearing.  Dylan's musical style is still ever-changing, even at 75 years of age, and just 'Like a Rolling Stone', you know that he will never sit still long enough to allow the moss to gather.",1464480000,,1017,4.653631284916201

2348718,5,B000A0GP4K,"""No Direction Home"" is one of my favorite rock documentaries. It consists of live performances and interviews with Dylan and his friends. It mainly focuses on the years between 1961 and 1966. Dylan is a mysterious figure, who rarely gives interviews. In this documentary, he opens up a little. As a Dylan fan, I found Scorsese's film compulsive viewing.

The funniest parts of the film are the press conferences where Dylan faces a succession of earnest interrogators who ask inane questions. They assume that Dylan is the spokesperson for his generation so they ask him about his role and philosophy. Dylan tells them that he is ""just a song and dance man."" One reporter wants to know about the significance of the motorbike on the cover of Highway 61. Another asks how many protest singers like him he thinks there are in America, Dylan deadpans ""136"". When his questioner queries how he can be so precise, he concedes it could be 142. It quickly becomes clear why he might think the press are idiots and why he grew tired of the circus.

The interviewees are candid and often funny. They mostly include people who knew him in the 1960s: Joan Baez, Suze Rotolo, Pete Seeger, John Cohen, Al Kooper, Peter Yarrow, Allen Ginsberg, Maria Muldaur, Bobby Neuwirth, Dave van Ronk and Bob Johnston. Everyone attests to the brilliance of his music, but some are less complimentary about Dylan the man. Dave Van Ronk claims that he stole ""House of the Rising Sun."" There is the suggestion from Baez that Dylan used the protest movement as a stepping stone. When Dylan became a rock star he ditched his old friends and their left-wing causes. The Dylan of today seems a lot wiser and almost apologetic about some of his behavior.

Much time is spent exploring the attitude of Dylan's folk audience who almost viewed his commercial success as a betrayal. Al Kooper could not understand why, as the headliner at the Newport Folk Festival, Dylan only bothered to play a 20-minute electric set. Kooper implied that Dylan seemed to want to alienate his folk fans. Peter Yarrow persuaded Dylan to go back on stage by with an acoustic guitar to placate the booing crowd. It is now difficult to fully understand the controversy given that acoustic folk music has now moved to the margins of the music industry.

Dylan was ambitious and probably wanted more fame and a larger audience. However, his rock influenced records of this period were arguably the best things he ever recorded. The three albums he released in 1965 and 1966 are amongst the greatest albums released in the 1960s: Bringing It All Back Home, Highway 61 Revisited and Blonde on Blonde. His change in direction was justified artistically.

The concert footage includes scenes from his 1966 UK concerts where people turn up in large numbers to complain and heckle. Looking back on it, it's difficult to understand why they bought tickets. After the UK tour, Dylan is exhausted and fed-up and turns his back on the music business to live on his royalties in Woodstock. Dylan only started touring again in 1974. Dylan seems happier as an observer rather than the leader of a movement. The film suggests that perhaps his followers in the 1960s expected too much from him.",1429142400,2,3219,4.803249097472924

A shy kid from Hibbing, Minnesota and the musical influences such as Hank Williams Sr., Woody Guthrie, and some great British folk groups of the period. The interviews of Bob Dylan and movie footage of his tours are something that should not be missed. It is truly a ground breaking video of one of the great performers and song writers of the 60s.

The only footage of Dylan that competes, although shorter yet extending further into his career, would be the 60 minutes interview with Ed Bradley. The 60 minutes interview is also excellent but is presented primarily as an interview without the extended performance footage in ""No Direction"".

I think anyone interested in Dylan should see/buy this as it dispels many myths about the man and shows him for the incredibly talented and influential artist he is.",1400976000,,675,4.964601769911504

The clips and interviews with Odetta, Dave Van Ronk, Joan Baez, Jeff and Maria Muldaur, etc., really brought back the excitement of that particular re-birth of folk/roots music. Watching these performances, and hearing Dylan's early recordings, makes obvous his ability to almost instantly ""channel"" these earlier masters, as well as making obvious the contributions of these musicians to Dylan's transformation of himself into perhaps the greatest musician/poet of his time.

I am a huge Dylan fan and though I have never thought he is a good vocalist, he is certainly the greatest poet of the second half of the 20th century, with Oscar Hammerstein a close second. in my opinion.

I have 2 children that are currently chasing their music business dreams and I am proud to say that I have passed my love for Dylan on to them. This film shows them the journey and the struggle that it took for Dylan so that they can keep it all in perspective as they make their way, The great thing about the struggle is that, you may never make big or become famous, but as all music lovers know, the songs that you write and sing are known to you and God.

While the doc works hard at exploring the context Dylan's rise to fame, it falls short of  clearly coalescing the opportunist and the artist to make it a satisfying look at a very important cultural figure and leaves more questions on the table than it answers.

Aside from loving the doc in itself I found myself comparing where I was when all this was happening. When Dylan was becoming known in Greenwich Village I was seventy miles away at Ft. Dix, training basics. I used to go into the Village, but I wasn't aware of him then. But I bought Freewheelin' in the PX on Okinawa in 1963, and took that and the first three Joan Baez albums to Vietnam with me at the end of '63. That was in the days when Special Forces thought of itself as a kind of armed Peace Corps. I was turned on to Baez and Dylan by young Green Berets who identified with their music totally. Nobody knows that anymore. What they know is a media image that does not even remotely match the reality of what we did. We loved the people we fought with. The clever little buggers wouldn't die for you if you didn't. That's the sum of my experience of the '60s, that I fought with people who died for freedom and didn't get it because we left them. And that's what washes over me when I hear Masters of War.",1349568000,3,1134,4.25462962962963

2348850,4,B000A0GP4K,"So...what is a 60-something, conservative Christian doing writing a review on a Bob Dylan documentary?  I confess, I have liked Dylan since I was in high school.  I became a fan when ""Like a Rolling Stone"" was on the radio.  Became a bigger fan when I found that Peter, Paul and Mary had been doing his earlier stuff, and even bigger when the Byrds covered him.  I always bought the popular notion that he was a political commentator...a rebel with a cause.  This DVD dispells that notion, and I love it!

Dylan is too cool.  He did musically what he wanted and was unconcerned that the folk lefties were so dimayed.  I thought Peter Yarrow was going to cry when it looked that Dylan wasn't going to do the acoustic stuff at Monteray.  Some of the other folk socialists took his apparent heresy in stride, but Joan Baez was simply broken-hearted that Bobby wasn't fronting the social movement of the early sixties.  Wah!

This documentary was just so much fun (nostalgic as well.)  I was left hoping for Part Two (maybe titled ""Blood on the Tracks""?)  I would love to know what was really going on behind the scene through the eighties and nineties.

Oh well.  ""No Direction Home"" was just great, and it'll have to do for now.",1343347200,2,1226,4.534246575342466

make it sound like he was just doing his thing, and everyone else was making a big deal about a guy who was just living his life, and making music.
 Seems like everyone from Hendrix to the Beatles, to practically everyone else sights Dylan as an influence. Who am I to argue?

2348862,5,B000A0GP4K,"To craft this superb three-and-a-half-hour landmark documentary presented on two separate DVDs, Martin Scorsese reportedly edited down more than 10 hours of source material, so as usual with filmmaking most of the available footage was left on the cutting room floor. The result is a textbook lesson in first-class documentary filmmaking very much in the mould of Scorsese's 1978 release `The Last Waltz' or his excellent film series about the blues.

Scorsese's ambition with `No Direction Home' is to tell the story of Bob Dylan's journey from obscure origins in Hibbing Minnesota to international success in the mid-1960s. In 1966 following injuries sustained in a motorcycle accident, he dropped out of the public eye for a couple of years to later re-emerge into the second phase of his long and enigmatic career.

The film describes Dylan's time in Greenwich Village NYC in 1961-62 (visiting Woody Guthrie in hospital, playing the folk club circuit and making his first recordings), then uses Dylan's important but at the time controversial UK tour in 1963 as the framework for a revealing montage of concert footage, straight-to-camera interviews with the young Bob and contributions from Joan Baez, Pete Seeger, Alan Ginsberg, Al Kooper and others from the period. His embracing of electric instruments and a fuller sound in the teeth of the anger and bewilderment of diehard folk purists is well told, an early character indication of iconoclastic mould-breaking. Dylan is and always has been his own man, does what he wants and answers to no-one; he can come across as hard-as-nails even whilst delivering sentiments of exquisite tenderness.

At the end of the film, do we understand more about the 20th century's most important popular musician/poet, the `voice of a generation', and what makes him tick? Well, a bit. Dylan's legendary taciturn personality and cryptic answers to (sometimes unbelievably crass) interview questions is on full display here, and the film really does reveal something of the young man in all his frustrating don't-try-to-pin-me-down complexity. Now aged 70, he ain't changed that much.

This is an absorbing, interesting film which never drags, despite its length. Martin Scorsese is very, very good at this game. Even if you're not really a Dylan fan, watch the editing and choice of content to see a master filmmaker at his craft and see how it's done. A follow-up film of Dylan's mid-life and later career from 1970 would be something to look forward to, but will we see the result of such a project? Probably not - more's the pity.",1327017600,2,2576,5.111638954869359
2348863,5,B000A0GP4K,"I recommend that you read my entire review, but if you don't have the time make the time (or you can scroll to the bottom and read my short sentence summaries).

I have been a fan of Dylan's music for quite some time. I recently started to watch some of his performances from his 1966 European tour online. I later found out that those performances where featured in this DVD, So I bought it just for the footage from the 66 tour. I later realized that the footage from Dylan's 1966 tour only makes up a very small fraction of the feature presentation and I am very glad that it does because the rest of the of DVD is a very informative, interesting, and entertaining look at Bob Dylan's career. This Documentary is a must buy any person who wants to learn more about Bob Dylan and his musical career and I think it's so well made that it could easily appeal to any Person that's not a fan of bob Dylan's Music.
The feature presentation of this 2 disc DVD set is a three and a half hour long Documentary about Bob Dylan's career and the things that might have influenced it and the things it might have influenced. It starts off with Dylan's childhood and ends with Dylan's 1966 European tour. The documentary talks about way more than just Dylan's career. It also informs the viewer about Dylan's surrounding during this timeframe. If Dylan is talking about his childhood they will have old footage of his hometown to show you what it was like for him in the 1950s with period music to go along with it or if Dylan is talking about his time in New York, interviews and music will be used to inform you about what it was like to be in New York during time.  The documentary is filled with rare photos, film footage, and audio of all kinds that inform , entertain and get the point across in a way that none of the interviews can. You can tell that they really dug deep when finding some of these forms of media.  Many people besides Bob Dylan are interviewed and I got to admit Dylan's interviews are the least informative. Even if don't know who Joan Baez or Alan Ginsberg are their interviews will inform you more than and possibly entertain you more than Dylan's.
I can honestly say that I learned more about Dylan from other people's interviews, which I find interesting.  What really makes this a great Documentary the way that everything connects and builds upon on each other. This is also the reason that I would recommend this DVD to non-Dylan fans.  By doing this Director Martin Scorsese does a great job of informing the viewer while entertaining him as well. It's hard for me to explain but everything in this Presentation just fits together so well that it really keeps the viewer's attention. Nothing seems out of place or unnecessary.  They might show you footage of the Million man march, a still picture of Dylan, a song from an artist of the time period, and then an interview of Bob Dylan's manger within five minutes of each other and you will be able to make connections.  Dylan might say something about one of his songs, then another person does the same, and then that song is played. Things like this sound simple but when you see it happen during the documentary it teaches you something about Dylan, the time period ,or a certain event. Another thing that I really liked was the way that the interviews built upon each other with. For example Dylan might say something weird and shy away from the subject and then another person's interview would tell you what Dylan was trying not to talk about. This really amused me. Quite a bit of the Footage from Dylan's 1966 is used to begin, end, or transition between certain parts of this otherwise linear documentary. When this is done it usually contradicts whatever came before it or after it. For example a certain section might be about Dylan being praised and idolized at a particular time and then the footage from 66 comes after showing Dylan being booed and threatened by fans. It Needless to say when the Footage from 1966 is used in this way, it will want to make you keep watching just to see what caused such a change. If you're looking for a DVD filled with music you might be disappointed because while the feature pretention does included dozens of Dylan's song their all only snippets. Music is only a portion of what makes this Documentary entertaining, so there is not one song that is herd in its entirety. This Documentary uses music as more of a teaching tool than a means of entertainment which is way other artist's music also play a big part in this documentary. The only other thing that I could say about the Feature presentation of this two disc DVD set is that for what it is it is pretty much perfect for what it's trying to be. It will inform you about Bob Dylan's career and the time period while keeping you entertained. The only negative thing I can say is that I can see this documentary might be boring to some people because it is long and in certain sections it does get dry. This is not a problem for Dylan fans.
Now to talk about the other stuff. The box that the two DVDs come is a standard DVD case with a very unique and interesting picture on the front of Bob Dylan. Half of the main feature is on one disc while the other half is on the other. Of course things like subtitles and scene selection are included.  The main menu annoyed me a little because one of the choices listed is ""Dylan performances"", buts these performances are really just the snippets taken from the Documentary, so like in the main feature their not showed in their entirety. I was really happy when I found out that there is full length Dylan Performances in the Special features in disc two. There are only about 10 but there all rare and very good. The main reason I bought this DVD is for one of Bob Dylan's performances of Like Rolling Stone during his 1966 tour and it was part of the list of full performances. To be honest if this DVD had nothing but the 10 full length Dylan Performances and the Footage from the 1966 tour I would have bought it, but that would be unfair to non Dylan fans. To be honest again, I have not checked out any of their other extras, ever since I found the list of full performances. I think they had people covering Dylan's music and stuff like that, but who cares the main reason I still pop in the DVD is to watch the full performances.

Summary

Main Feature
5/5 if you want a documentary that will teach you about Dylan's career than this is the perfect product or if you just want to see an entertaining documentary than this is the perfect product. It is a little boring at times but like Bob Dylan's career it will change and keep you entertained with new material.

The DVDs
5/5
Menus and Discs fit the style of the Main feature very well. Could have used way more FULL Dylan performances in the special features, I am a Dylan Fan after all, but these DVDS are meant to inform and  entertain through multiple forms of media and the fact that they included quit a few FULL Dylan performances is just Icings n the cake.

You might not like this product if
* You're not a Dylan or Documentary fan. YOU WILL BE BORED
* Expect this to be a plethora of Bob Dylan music and performances.  As I said before Music is only a portion of what makes this Documentary entertaining. If you want full length Dylan Performances comment and I will give you a Recommendation.",1322265600,,7390,4.428256070640177
2348864,4,B000A0GP4K,"Bob Dylan/ No Direction Home/ a martin Scorsese Picture (DVD):  The point of this film is to show the history of Bob Dylan up to the ""Judas"" incident when Bob was going electric.  There are some essential moments in this film, which make the film essential for any Dylan fan.  However, Scorsese purposely makes the sound of the key electric performances louder and more chaotic than they really were in order to push the point he (the filmmaker) is trying to make.  That trick was unnecessary and is extremely irritating.  It is a big enough error in judgment to drop this film from five stars to four stars.",1321833600,,608,4.592592592592593
2348865,4,B000A0GP4K,"I'll confess--I don't like Bob Dylan. I've never liked his voice, nor his sense of humor, nor have I particularly liked his songs. He's always seems brutally disinterested in the feelings of anyone else. The last few days, I've been watching the Martin Scorsese documentary, No Direction Home, and tried to disarm my bad feelings of this guy with a deeper understanding of his psyche. Maybe it sounds obnoxious and prideful, but I don't like not liking somebody. I feel that if I just knew a person, comprehended them, that my mind would fall into line, and I'd develop--what's that word we hate so much?--compassion.

So I watched Scorsese's 2005 story of Bob Dylan's first 25 years. He was born Robert Zimmerman, you probably know, in Northern Minnesota, not far from Lake Superior. It was coal country, and a small town environment without much to do. Only once does he mention his father in the movie; he never mentions his mother. Later in his career, he made much ado of the fact that he ""grew up in Gallup New Mexico,"" which was a blatant lie, as if he were trying to distance himself from his pedestrian, middle-class lifestyle. During high school, Dylan played guitar or piano in local bands, for a while with 50s teen idol Bobby Vee. During those years, he would often introduce himself as Bobby Vee himself, in an attempt to--I don't know what--gain popularity by proxy? To attract girls? To impress peers?

From there, he went for a year to University of Minnesota, where he admits ""I never attended classes. I was enrolled. But I don't remember going to class. I would play music all night, and sleep all day."" Eventually, he found his way to New York City's Greenwich Village, which had a flourishing arts and music scene. He never lacked work. He met (or at least claimed he met) Woodie Guthrie, who was at Greystone Hospital, an asylum.

Those who knew him during the era claim he was a kind of musical sponge, quickly picking up genres, tunes, songs, even instrumental styles. He often imitated others; sometimes sang with an Irish accent; sometimes with a Southern US twang. He would do whatever it took to sell the song. Later, when he was enough of a name to sell records, his producers and label managers say he would con anybody with any kind of line, to make himself stand out from the crowd: ""I learned this song from an Indian chief up in Ontario."" His self-promotion was unabashed.

As I watched, the opening line of Allen Ginsberg's poem ""Howl"" kept running through my head: ""I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness."" Was this Dylan guy sane? He had no center: he admitted no parents, no past, except the one he invented for convenience's sake. If nothing else, he had chutzpah. Maybe that's a working definition of madness: someone with enough of a mental condition that they'll go after what they want, no matter the cost. If you throw enough mad people at the institution, one or two are bound to get through. We call those mad people geniuses. Just a thought.

His treatment of folk singer Joan Baez was opportunistic and, as soon as she'd outlived her usefulness--she was quite popular--he very pointedly and publicly ignored her, until she was left no choice but to leave him, so he would continue his tour alone. She mentions seeing him, many times, turn his back on an audience for a song or two, or stop playing, even during a duet. This I found most unconscionable since a performance, like it or not, is a kind of social contract with minimal expectations. The audience has an expectation--I'd go so far as to say a right--to see the show they came to see.

The record producers interviewed during the show seemed to take the attitude that, to paraphrase, was ""Sure he lied to everyone, but look at all the money he made us."" As if that justifies such a behavior. I suppose it takes a sort of madness to attain fame, even more to attain money. Scorsese's film is aptly named; coming from a line in Dylan's hit ""Like a Rolling Stone."" But, I wonder if he had no direction home, because Dylan himself removed home from the equation. To become someone, he seemed to think he had first to become everybody, and then nobody.

Everyone who worked with him admits his genius. Sometimes it seems that genius is not enough to make up for lack of talent, especially when bolstered with conceit, and public rudeness. It is made obvious, in the second half of the film, that Dylan was completely unprepared for the effects ""going electric"" would have on him. Once the golden child, it became commonplace for 1/3 of the audience to boo him. The film ends with an interview clip with Dylan, who is clearly stoned, but is rocking uncontrollably in a chair, cigarette in hand saying ""I don't know where home is, but I just want to go home."" He goes on stage, quips to the band that he wishes he could replace himself with another Dylan and that he ""shouldn't be playing tonight."" He opens the stage door and is greeted by an attendee shouting ""Judas!"" as he plugs in his guitar.

You can't help feel from him. Even a guy like myself, who went into the film to find more reasons to hate the singer. If that was my initial demands, I left the film satisfied. Yet a came away from the film with something else, for once: compassion. Nobody deserves to be treated the way he was, and for something simultaneously so nonessential and so important as music.",1317427200,,5392,4.609375
2348866,5,B000A0GP4K,"No Direction Home the film made by Martin Scorcese on Bob Dylan is a worthwhile documentary on Dylans life. Part 1 (late 50s-63)describes his early years in Hibbing Minnesota. The kind of influences on the radio and in music. Bob gives from the perspective of weary-eyed wisdom the kind of place Hibbing was,the cold winters,the helping out now and again in his dads hardware store,the monotony of the life,the average ness of Bobs attempts at music-making. He describes his two girlfriends with their exotic names, and his attempts to woo them with his music. Dylan felt the need to get away as far as possible from his hometown. He learned as a musical expeditionary to steal a collectors records of folk and popular music, absorb all influences, develop a back story which is closer to mythology of where hed been, how he developed, what hed done. He returned 2 months later to show what hed learned..

Friends who knew him are quoted. Suzie Rotolo, David Van Ronk, Liam Clancy. The Greenwich Village years. His early process of absorbing everything Woody Guthrie had done, his way of telling stories and his left wing sense of injustice. Dylan absorbed the way other musicians performed, the best ones had a certain look in their eyes. He donned new identities, had a Charlie Chaplin quality. Later Joan Baez loved his songs, found out about him and sung at concerts with him or introduced him(she being then more famous). They loved each other, but Dylan reacted vs. being adopted by the left -wing protest movement(of which Baez was a part), and his genius threw off the shackles of the topical songs he sung, moved to a more internal muse in songs like Hey Mr Tambourine Man and The Chimes of Freedom. He severed his links with Baez , leaving her with a wounded love she never got over. She saw all the new electric phase as decadent, but she reflects now he didn't want to go down one tunnel, he was his own man, with a choice of many roads. She acknowledges his genius.

Liam Clancy remembers being irritated by his presence, always hanging around, having no definite identity. But after seeing him at Newport Folk Festival in 1963, realized he was a shamanic receiver for his generation, picking up all the influences, expressing what everybody thought. We get the decisive break with his folk fans at Newport in 1965 when he went electric in a group with Al Kooper and Paul Butterfield. Pete Seeger, one the idols of his folk music, wanted to cut the cables, due to the noisiness of the sound when Dylan played for 15 minutes. All the time the historical context (with the background of JFK and Martin Luther King) feeds into the music-making. Like a Rolling Stone seems to symbolise the break between his music and politics, almost a put-down of the former fans/non musical journalists and its played several times in the film. Dylan seems to be unaware of the source of his song-writing or its meaning, he typed away on his type-writer, not sure if he was producing a novel, play or song. Dylan is shown bemused at press conferences. ""I'm a song and dance man"".

Ginsberg expresses something which had to change when he shifted over to electric. In his singing says Ginsberg, he `had found a way for all his consciousness and intelligence to be focussed on his breath'. That connection would become broken when he played electric guitar. The organic quality, the magnetic hold with his audience would become lost. The group played loud, Dylan shouted over the guitars. Mr Tambourine Man was his break away from public manipulation into inner worlds. He learned from The Byrds how it could be done and he learned from the Beatles, that pop and rock music were the future. He injected real intelligence into pop lyrics. He shifted for a while into country music after his motor-cycle crash rest period(where Part 2 ends).

Dylan gives sober commentaries looking back on his elusive, mercurial youth. He's very clear-eyed and matter-of-fact. For instance: ""I had a perspective on the booing...because you can kill somebody with kindness."" We have had his Chronicles I, which gives a literary take on the period covered here. Scorsese has crafted a seamless mesh of documentary footage, concert out-takes, history(Kennedy, King,The Cold War,early singers ,Hibbing footage),interviews with those who were there at the start, Van Ronk, Liam Clancy, Joan Baez, producers, Al Kooper, Cash, Neuwerth, The Band. There is a gap in what made him world famous. It's hinted at-as with The Beatles-the vacuum left after Kennedy's death , also the incredible changes going on with the baby-boomers, the space race, Vietnam, colour TV, post-war leisure and wealth. Part 2(1963-66) gives a series of takes from concert footage, especially In England, including the famous one where hes called Judas and shouts at the Band to play it f loud. He usually played an acoustic set followed by an electric set. The diehard fans asked for Dylan to stay as he was. Dylan: ""As a performer, you can never say you've arrived. You've always got to be moving on.""

Dylan himself remains an enigma,always moving, unable to be pinned down, avoiding definitions or analysis, yet curiously likeable, approachable, down-to earth, focussed, human. His genius was the innovative transformation of traditional folk melodies and source materials. Whether Dylan likes it or not,it was as an acoustic guitar-playing(with harmonica)singer-song-writer and folk singer that he became so famous world-wide. Those early, idealistic, traditional themes were well captured by his lyrical fecundity, guitar-strumming,his wordplay, his emotional range and stylistic diversity. But above all it was his amazing voice, highly-wrought, plaintive,sarcastic, tender, humorous, full of conscience and yearning that bowled people over. His longetivity and chameleon changes,testament. Part 2 is less absorbing lacking the integral freshness of part1 and we could have gone up to the mid 70s, There are lots of scenes taken from Dont Look Back and Festival. Dylan meant more than its possible for any singer to matter now. Who but Scorsese can do justice to him?",1305936000,,6115,4.997055937193327

2348868,5,B000A0GP4K,"No matter how great a filmmaker Martin Scorsese is---and he's one of the best in the USA----this is a documentary that could have ended up being a disaster had its subject, the former Robert Alan Zimmerman and present Bob Dylan, refused to cooperate in making it. The biggest plus here is that not only did he cooperate, but Dylan turns out to be disarmingly straightforward during his interview, the binding glue for the program. Perhaps this was because production was so close to the release of his own memoirs, CHRONICLES VOLUME 1, that Dylan felt an imperative to set the record straight for everyone who, in the past, could have been forgiven for not being sure if he was ever forthcoming when not performing. In any case, Dylan comes off in NO DIRECTION HOME as very assured of how he remembered his early years up to the end of 1966, and the corraborations of his recollections by such fellow travelers as Joan Baez, Dave Van Ronk, Izzy Young, Pete Seeger and others definetely gives the right feeling of authenticity. Scorsese fleshes out his program with deft uses of archival concert and news footage, including several moments from Dylan's last concert tour of England with The Hawks (later The Band) prior to the motorcycle crash that sidelined him for the bulk of 1967. THAT footage is extraordinary, if only because you see how raw and unfettered his band sound really was, but the moments taken from various outdoor festivals, TV shows and indoor concerts from 1961 to 1966 are just as incredible.

Throughout it all, one central theme emerges; Bob Dylan knew from the get-go how to tap into most of the aspects that make the difference between a good performer and a great one. If you've ever even now still find yourself pulling out BLONDE ON BLONDE or HIGHWAY 61 REVISITED and getting blown away by what you find there, you MUST see this documentary.",1303171200,,1869,4.75076923076923

Most of my favorite music was mad and recorded during the time period presented in this movie.

2348873,5,B000A0GP4K,"No Direction Home is one of the best music documentaries, essential for anyone even remotely interested in Bob Dylan or twentieth century music; its reach and Dylan's importance are such that it is arguably essential for anyone interested in twentieth century culture period. As informative as it is entertaining, it is masterful as a film per se as well as a documentary; fans could hardly ask for more, and the quality is such that many others will be interested.

The film covers Dylan up to his 1966 motorcycle accident, focusing specifically on 1956 forward. It goes into his upbringing somewhat but focuses mainly on musical influences; we learn what made him want to be a musician and much about what made him the one he became. The details of his pre-fame life are fascinating. Post-fame years are here in greater detail, as every major event is covered along with many others. Director Martin Scorsese and company also skillfully use a variety of outside material - songs, movie clips, news footage, poems, narration, etc. - to add context and clarity. They are also very adept at using Dylan's own music. They always seem to pick just the right song at just the right point; for example, playing ""Lay Down Your Weary Tune"" over the closing credits is a brilliant touch. Their touch with photos, videos, etc. is similarly deft. More importantly, there are extensive interviews with the often tight-lipped Dylan, who opens up in unprecedented detail and range. A wide range of peers and other insiders also appear - Allen Ginsberg, Joan Baez, Al Kooper, etc. -, including former girlfriend Suze Rotolo for the first time. We thus get an excellent overview of Dylan's most famous and probably best period; the story is told with drama and verve, potentially drawing in many who do not even like Dylan. However, it is important to realize that the story essentially aims at casuals. Anyone familiar with Dylan's art and life will find few revelations, which may disappoint some. That said, the film has much for them also, not least the interviews, nearly all of which are interesting; many are entertaining, and quite a few are insightful. Perhaps most valuable of all is the extensive performance footage, much of it from underground classics like Eat the Document or unreleased Newport Folk Festival footage. Some, including the legendary ""Judas!"" version of ""Like a Rolling Stone,"" was not even thought to exist - a fan's dream.

Simply put, No Direction can hardly be overpraised; it is as essential as all but Dylan's best music, which is all that need be said.",1276300800,,2573,4.9126436781609195

Others viewed him as a prophet, I think he viewed himself as a guitar playing singer. He was just trying to make music and wrote stuff that others found profound. A real history lesson and takes you back to the 60's and 70's. I went to High School in Duluth MN. Bob went to High School in Hibbing MN, before me, but the video captures the times, and to know where he came from and what he became is an amazing transformation. The video does a good job of showing the change as it played out. He is an gifted music creator, and has done incredible things with a voice that would not be considered classically great.",1263772800,,837,4.30379746835443
2348876,5,B000A0GP4K,"This is Martin Scorsese's magisterial account of Dylan's early years. It includes extensive selections of previously unseen interviews with Dylan. Izzy Young is a real standout, though at least one of his pungent comments was cut from the film. Allen Ginsberg is characteristically perceptive.

Some of the Newport footage has been superseded by the release of ""The Other Side of the Mirror,"" but there is a lot of exciting concert material here. Scorsese's real triumph is in the editing. He makes the story exciting and moving. There is a mass of material to work with, so that kind of achievement is extraordinarily difficult. Using Dylan's tour of England as a framing device, the film is a drama of the rise and emotional collapse of a great artist. The film, that is, is more than a document. It is a moving human drama.

2348881,5,B000A0GP4K,"Over the past several months or so I have spent some time going over the musical influences back in the early 1960's that had an effect on  my political development as I was growing up, or that just caught my ear. Not surprisingly many of those same musical influences still resonate today. Of those early 1960's influences none probably was greater than that of Bob Dylan, no only because he had a different sound but because his super-charged protest-oriented lyrics `spoke' to me. That Dylan could only go a very short distance along that political protest route that others, including myself, had to travel does not negate the important of that influence.

As this very well-done almost four hour in-depth Martin Scorsese documentary makes abundantly clear I was not alone in feeling that influence. Others also felt that Dylan `spoke' to them, if not as the voice of the ""Generation of `68"" then for a moment. I have previously reviewed a number of Bob Dylan's early albums (""The Free-Wheelin' Bob Dylan"", ""The Times They Are A-Changin'"", ""Bringing It All Back Home"", etc.) in this space as I believe that those albums reflect both the prime period of his musical influence and, when future generations begin to ask their versions of the social questions posed by the 1960's, will be the music they will be pressing to learn 100 years from now.

This documentary is also formatted to reflect fully on that above-mentioned shared underlying understanding of Dylan's career and place in the folk/rock pantheon. The structure of the film also reflects the now standard method of doing a film documentary. Plenty of clips of Dylan's childhood, youth, the early days in the burgeoning folk scene in Greenwich Village in the early 1960's and plenty of clips of early performances up until that decisive period in 1965 when Dylan decided to move in another direction combining his still thoughtful but by then more personal lyrics with an electric guitar (and band to back that sound up). That changeover gets full attention by having clips of the breakthrough Royal Hall concert interspersed through the film. The film thus has its central focus on this switch-over that is a part of what made Dylan so controversial and upsetting to traditional folkies back in the day.

Additionally, this film also has something that is not always the case with biographic documentaries; the subject himself holding forth on the meaning of it all. Most times that would not necessarily be a revelation as such efforts are usually unproductive. Here, however, the notoriously private and generally unresponsive (to interview questions, at least) Dylan contributes his take on what is bound to be used as a primary source for ""the first draft"" of his effect on popular music in the late 20th century. Although Dylan generally responded to the interviewers questions here I would argue that for whatever purposes he told no more than we already knew or what he wanted told. Not unusual in the famous but a little maddening here for those, like this reviewer, who happen to be serious looking at the question of ""the meaning of the 1960's. But, so be it.

Fortunately another feature of theses types of documentaries helped out on that question. The film is heavily seeded with comments, performances and anecdotes by many of the performers still standing and other interested parties of the early 1960's who personally knew Dylan or had something of interest to say about the times. The list of ""talking heads"" (to the good here, I usually use this phrase with a little tongue-in cheek"") brought into this production formed a veritable who's who of those in or around that folk scene at the time.

Most informative of this crowd, not surprisingly, were the late folk historian, Dave Van Ronk, and the, as of this writing, very much alive Pete Seeger who not only performed music but made it their business to know and keep the folk tradition alive. Van Ronk was especially informative about the competitiveness of the early folkies mainly the male ones, as Joan Baez was conceded on the female side to be the ""queen of the hill"", to see who would become ""king of folk"". He also had interesting comments about the commercialization of folk music and the dreaded ""selling out to mainstream culture"". By Van Ronk's account backed up by other sources I have run across as well, Dylan was intensely interested in that battle. Seeger was strongest on the transition, of which he was a seminal figure, of the folk tradition from the older 1930's Great Depression `lefties' like Woody Guthrie, Josh White, Cisco Houston and Lead Belly to the new kids on the block.

Others of note along the way include the afore-mentioned Joan Baez, at one time also Dylan's girlfriend, with some very insightful comments giving us the ""skinny' of what it was like actually living with such a whirlwind and about the strains on their relationship (and her psyche) of her direction toward more political involvement, and his away from such activity. Liam Clancy (of Tommy Makem and The Clancy Brothers) and Maria Muldaur (most noted then for her key role as singer in the Jim Kweskin Jug Band) add some spice to the conversation. There are many others who have something to say about particular events but of that crowd I would select John Cohen (of ""The New Lost City Ramblers"") as most informative about the history of what was going in those times and the schism between the `purists' and those who wanted to `sell out' for filthy lucre. Again, Cohen is not a surprising choice, as ""Lost City"" spent much time on tracing the folk traditions (and it included Mike Seeger, Pete's half- brother so you know they were interested in history).

Others have, endlessly, gone on about Bob Dylan's role as the voice of his generation (and mine), his lyrics and what they do or do not mean and his place in the rock or folk pantheons, or both. After viewing this documentary it still seems hard to believe now both as to the performer as well as to what was being attempted that anyone would take umbrage at a performer using an electric guitar to tell a folk story (or any story for that matter). The well-known English Royal Hall performance or that equally well-known three song folk/rock set at Newport in 1965 hardly seem worth getting steamed up about now. It is not necessary to go into all the details of what or what did not happen with Pete Seeger at the Newport Folk Festival in 1965 (although this incident gets a full airing by all parties) to know that one should be glad, glad as hell, that Bob Dylan continued to listen to his own drummer and carry on a career based on electronic music.

Note: Although I do not usually spend much time looking through special features sections of DVDs here there are several extras well worth looking at. They include some early performances by Dylan both highlighted in the documentary and others that did not make the cut. Additionally, a number of the ""talking heads' that are heard in the documentary , including Liam Clancy and Maria Muldaur, do renditions of some Dylan's songs.",1235433600,5,7085,4.815119145439605

2348895,5,B000A0GP4K,"Martin Scorsese scores big in this documentary on the great Bob Dylan. Interestingly, Scorsese also filmed a documentary in 1978 on The Band's last concert called ""The Last Waltz"". The Band were the backing band for Dylan before striking out on their own so this Dylan documentary ties things up nicely.

""No Direction Home"" explores Dylan's life and career up until his motorcycle accident in 1966. There are incisive interviews with people he met along the way, rare footage of Dylan on and off stage, and rare and illuminating interviews with the great man himself.

This film does much to explain the seemingly inscrutable nature of Dylan. He is definitely his own man and like many great artists he stands outside his own time.

The highlight is footage of Dylan singing ""Mr Tambourine Man"" at the Newport Festival in July 24, 1964 - just a man by himself on stage with a guitar and harmonica saying nothing and yet saying everything...

This is not just for fans but for anybody with a passing interest in Dylan and the tumultuous musical and political world of the late 50s early 60s.

The first disk is the most interesting, and provides a background of how the artist was created.  From his beginnings as a youth in Hibbing, listening late into the night to performers on distant AM stations, he latches onto their sounds, and the musician-composer begins to develop.  We see a great artist growing not in a vacuum, but rather through a compulsion to consume and digest everything around him, and to experiment without boundaries.  His extrication from the drab canons of Hibbing becomes as inevitable as the sunrise.

The running narrative by the present-day Dylan lends an autobiographical sense to the documentary.  What is revealed is not just the events, but also how he felt about those tumultuous years, a viewpoint available only now that he feels comfortable openly reflecting on these experiences.

Viewers may find the scenes of Dylan in his later post-acoustic concerts a little drawn out, and some of these performances do seem dreadful.  The audiences clearly thought so, and perhaps that is the way the filmmaker thought you might react.  This is what Dylan eventually became, right before his motorcycle accident.

He sings about individuals. He lets us know as he used to do the rounds of Cafes at New York's Village where he decided to strike a chord with at least one listener. Aiming to target his audience out, he further enhanced his skills and style learning as much in 2 months in the Village as someone may learn in a lifetime of playing music.

If Dylan sold his dirt I would buy it. I am that obsessed with his persona and music.

This documentary does a great job and bringing us his roots. Incredible footage of not just Dylan but that of those artists who inspired him to be what he is. Most of all his love of Woody Gunthrie's music. He grew up from a small town nobody to a National and International sensation.

A man with his voice at that time couldn't even make a buck, while Dylan with his choice of words and topics revolutionised the entire Music Industry.

Country music or mainstream - he is a Rock Star like no other.

Still counting he is publishing more records and setting new standards. Martin Scorcese lets us visit the humble star who talk candidly about his meetings, performances, influences and success. Truly magical world revealed here as we see how from Jack Kerouac's On the Road to a book on Woody Gunthrie feels like home to the teenage Dylan.

A world of misfits and he fits at ease in it. Thinking what others can't dream of, he merges and weaves and intertwines styles and stories to make an incredible form of music with unmatched pace.

2348901,5,B000A0GP4K,"You don't have to be a Dylanologist or even a generational fellow traveler (though it doesn't hurt) to be completely captivated by Martin Scorcese's 200 min. documentary of the magnetic early career of the legendary artist.  With a carefully textured combination of archival footage- some never seen before- and contemporary interviews, including a revealing and engaging running commentary by the notoriously elusive subject himself, Scorsese portrays in fascinating detail the unlikely and uncanny transformation of the small town Bobby Zimmerman into the daemonic lyrical genius whose clairvoyant creative fusion with the nascent Sixties' zeitgeist shaped and catalyzed a momentous cultural tipping point like no other artist of his time.  It is a great story told by a master story teller.

For me, however, the ultimate achievement of this film goes beyond its vivid portrait of a mythic young artist.  It is the nagging and even haunting question that the film eventually leaves us with; the indecipherable mystery- in plain sight- of Dylan himself.

The genius of Scorcese is what he is able to show us. That there is such a thing as an artistic charismatic; that there are larger than life phantoms who appear seemingly out of nowhere, whose mesmerizing, mercurial incandescence can manifest a preternatural subjectivity so intense and at the same time so permeable they are able, in the swirling ebb and flow of their creativity, to transfigure themselves over and over again at will.  In doing so they are able to bring their art to a white hot heat that galvanizes and transfigures the imagination of almost everybody it touches, and, after the fire has subsided, leaves an indelible stamp that even they do not understand.",1173916800,7,1734,5.197132616487456

Yet between Scorsese's excellent documentary & Dylan's own Chronciles (Vol. 1) this is as close a revealing display of 'who'/'what' Dylan is, and how that means different things to everyone interested in him and his art. I think the film brilliantly explores the facts, myths, contrivances, and oh yeah, impact the man's music and the path it cut through American culture and beyond. His impact IS so immense that it's easy to forget that he's just a man with a guitar/piano, a pen/typewriter, scraps of paper and cigarettes who has somehow been able to filter the complexities of humanity - be it love, anger, fear, outrage, compassion, sarcasm, loneliness, hope and humor via deceptively simple music and incredible poetry. He is a mirror, but not always the reflection of that mirror. As he sang in 'The Man in Me' (New Morning) ""The man in me will hide sometimes to keep from bein' seen/But that's just because he doesn't want to turn into some machine"". Still, Dylan is always an open book to anyone - whether or not you are of his generation, ignored him at the time this film explores, were born after this era (I was born in early 1968 in Rochester - a day's drive from his base at the time) or you have only recently discovered him. That is a hallmark of great art and a great artist - there's always something different you find everytime you tap into it.

Scorsese's research into his subject is excellent - from interviews (starting with Dylan himself) to contemporaries both alive and gone (Ginsberg, Van Ronk), thoughtfully plucked film footage including from 'Eat The Document'(including some outtakes(?)) not surprising since Scorsese as a young man edited both Pennebaker's film of the Monterey Pop Festival of 1967 and the documentary of Woodstock. There are many revealing moments, too numerous to list here and many more questions raised about the relevence of the artist to late-twentieth century, cold-war era culture.

The pace is perfect, the threads many and artfully woven together. And stands up well to repeated viewing as a result. However, I take one star away because a discussion/exploration of the apex of his gradually frenzied pace and output - 'Blonde On Blonde' is *completely* omitted. I'm still scratching my head about that one. The record that best illustrates the genius and contradictions of the end of the era the film look at isn't even given a passing mention! Why? Not particularly interested? Had to cut any segment on it out to make the original TV broadcast time limit? Having said that, this is my sole disappointment with what otherwise is a fruitful and fascinating attempt to nail down the droplet of genius that was/is Robert Allen Zimmerman/Bob Dylan.",1169769600,4,2749,4.909677419354839
2348904,4,B000A0GP4K,"""Not as represented"" is the phrase used when rating a seller on Amazon.

""No Direction Home"" could be validly advertised as concentrating only on the earliest part of Dylan's long career.  If it is to be part of a continuing series on the artist, it would be fantastic.  But:

The first disk is fascinating.  The controversy with the folk purists takes up quite a bit of time.

Unfortunately, the second disk deals with nothing but an old and unimportant controversy.  Fewer whining fans and more of Dylan's recent career would have been welcome.  Dylan's final impatience at the constant requests for his viewpoints on the whole silly business was very understandable.  It ends up being an older fan's documentary about music politics.

The man has moved on.  If this documentary was truly about a whole career, why, as my husband said, was there no ""Blood on The Tracks""?

When Scorsese finishes the documentary he could just keep Dylan's performances on the second disk and flip the rest.  Considering the length of Dylan's career, he's probably going to need the disk space.

Dave van Ronk never had a chance to see it and his book ""The Governor of MacDougal"" was posthumously released. Harald Leventhal died just days after i bought the DVDs. Maria Muldaur, meanwhile, has released Bob Dylan's ""Moonlight"" on her album ""Love Wants To Dance"" and on her album ""Heart of Mine"" which she produced and belongs to the Dylan Cover Songs category.

Interesting is also the list of record sleeves shown in the film about how often the song ""Blowin' In The Wind"" had already been covered in the early 60s, a song of which i in my youth always thought was a traditional song.

every movie for me has favorite and not so favorite scenes, but my most favorite scene in this film is where Maria Muldaur explains after the ""Newport Folk Festival"" event that she saw him sitting there alone in the corner and she went up to him asking if he'd like to dance and Bob Dylan replied ""I'd love to dance with you, Maria, but my hands are of fire."" i guess that's THE statement in the movie ... well, at least for me.

2348917,5,B000A0GP4K,"I am certainly ""running hot"" in terms of documentary selection as it seems like every time I find one which is superlative another comes along and outperforms it. No Direction Home makes one contemplate a great many things. Perhaps the most immediate is the idea that there is nothing in this world that Martin Scorsese cannot do better than his peers. We don't think of the eminent director's name being associated with documentary, but he advances this genre in the same fashion he did short film with his forty-some-minute work, Life Lessons, within New York Stories. Here he accomplishes the impossible as viewers finally are exposed to the man Bob Dylan as opposed to the idol. Unfortunately, the results are fairly jarring. I'm always worshipped Bob but my opinion of him was definitely lowered by this portrait comprised of interviews with the artist and those who knew him ""back in the day."" On the positive side, we again, just as in Don't Look Back, see firsthand evidence of his genius and how so much of what he did could not have been done by anyone else. His production during this brief moment of time was amazing. As a person though, we find him to be ruthlessly ambitious and opportunistic. Bob Zimmerman was on a mission to make it one way or another and nothing was going to stop him...and nothing did. The most disheartening element in this depiction is the lack of honor he showcased. He appears to have stolen a few hundred records from an old friend, and, even when confronted, refused to give them back. It is implied that he never, even when worth tens of millions, made good on this debt. This is unfortunate but probably reflective of the way in which young Dylan used and discarded others. Relationships seemed to be a means to end and never an end in them self. Joan Baez's observations support this as well. To please her, he merely had to invite her upon stage with him in London, but this was asking too much from a man about to become king. Yet, in the final analysis, he is a king and the person of the artist is always subsidiary to the works produced--at least in the minds of fans like this reviewer who will always love Dylan no matter what he does or says.",1157241600,7,2195,4.573604060913706
2348918,5,B000A0GP4K,"I first saw this movie as two part ""fund raiser"" special on PBS. Having grown up in NY in the early sixties this wonderful movie by Scorsese really brought back a flood of memories I didn't even know I had of that period.

While this movie is shot in a documentary form it flows effortlessly through Dylan's formative and (I think) most creative years. The mix of performances and following Dylan and his entourage are masterfully done. The interviews with an older weary Dylan and his contemporaries are so insightful: Dave Van Ronk, Allen Ginsberg, Maria Muldaur and of course the incomparable Joan Baez who still seems to have such a soft spot for Bob and his genius.

If you're even remotely interested in Dylan and the music of that era this is a must have DVD for your collection. Kudos go to Scorsese for whom this was clearly a labor of love.

The times they have changed...we just don't have music with this power any more.",1156550400,5,932,4.568862275449102
2348919,5,B000A0GP4K,"Bob Dylan has always seemed the kind of musician I should have been into (intelligent lyrics, etc), yet for some reason I never have been able to find a way to get into his music. This is probably going to sound silly to Dylan fans, but I was put off by everything from not knowing which album to buy first, struggling to understand what Bob was saying. It just all seemed a very different world to mine. Well, after this DVD ""No Direction Home"", compiled by Martin Scorsese, I'm rather turned around on the subject. I've gotten some context, I GET it now!

By way of original concert footage, TV spots and present day interviews from many people including Joan Baez, Allen Ginsberg and even Bob Dylan himself, we see over two discs the rise of Dylan's career, disc one covering his early life and influences up to about 1963, the second disc covering 1963 to just after Dylan's infamous motorcycle crash in 1966. It's done pretty straightforward, though there is the occaisonal arty directional flourish put in by Martin Scorsese (silence after the motorcycle crash, beginning the documentary in silence, as if there was no music before Dylan, etc). It's not strictly chronological, the documentary will often cut to 1966, where people will be booing Dylan for having a band and going electric. Though I usually like my stories and documentaries pretty chronological, I thought the flashing back and forth added to ""No Direction Home"". It reminded you what was going to happen, compared the folk versions of Dylan songs to some of the electric renditions, provided some contrast, showed what the shock must have been to the audience back then.

I'd always heard about this infamous change, and had never really understood what the big deal is. After seeing this documentary, I understand why it was such a big deal to some fans, who saw Dylan as a folk purist, as a national conscience, etc. I also see why it wasn't such a big deal to Dylan. He had always been into rock'n'roll, even when he was growing up. He'd had an electric guitar back then, even.

I know a lot of things now that I've seen this documentary. I know that Bob Dylan and Johnny Cash not only met, but sung a song together. I know why, in the 1960s, so many bands did covers of Dylan's songs. I now know more about Allen Ginsberg and his scene. It's great to have a documentary where you come away with a heap more than what you expected. Then again, it is a rather lengthy documentary.

Special features include a selection of performances used in the film that can be watched seperately, plus a few performances that are not. They date from 1963 to 1966. As a casual listener, I was pleased to find some footage of ""Positively 4th Street"" being performed, as it's a song I quite like.

I'd recommend this DVD to anyone interested at all in Bob Dylan. It'd be a good place for newcomers to start, I think, it definitely was for me. I don't think I've seen a music documentary this interesting since the Beatles Anthology. I'll be picking up an album of Bob's pretty soon, I'm sure.",1154390400,12,3052,4.602941176470588

Whereas Scorsese built the story of The Band around The Last Waltz concert, here he takes his time, exploring the ins and outs of Dylan's storied early years, showing how this kid from Minnesota exploded onto the folk music scene, able to absorb and assimilate both the music and the social events of the time.  Seeger quickly picked up on this young talent, who like Dylan's obvious musical and social reference, Woody Guthrie, was able to capture the mood of the time.  Scorsese intersperses the documentary with a number of amusing anecdotes, the best delivered by Liam Clancy.  Concert footage is edited, but then there are a number of concert DVD's available of Bob through the years. You won't be disappointed.",1152576000,,927,4.775

The movie focusses on Dylan's life itself, not just his music career. It shows a lot of interviews with different people who knew Bob Dylan or just knew his music. I was captivated with how the movie managed to just flow freely and was surprised when it ended because if seemed like it had only just begun. This is one film you should definately see.

The film focusses on Bob Dylan's childhood; from growing up in a town in Minnesota, and how he managed to start singing and playing music in small coffe houses and even festivals. What was great about this film is all the new footage that was aired in it. We see still photography shots of Dylan as a young man, playing with a guitar or his harmonica in front of a crowd of people. There is old footage of concerts, interviews, and press conferences that many people probably wouldn't have seen back then, or even now.

Interviews include people such as; Izzy Young, Paul Nelson, Al Kooper, Allen Ginsberg, and many others. But probably the greatest interviewee of them all is Bob Dylan himself. He talks about everything! Growing up, his first musical performance, he even talks about other great musical artists, my favorite of them being Johnny Cash. Some great footage in this film.

Extras include:

Bob Dylan Performances:

No Direction Home

From his fateful journey in search of Woody Guthrie to his rise to stardom to his fall from his fans' graces, this film is a non-stop joy ride into what the 1960's was for Bob Dylan. I have always felt that Martin Scorsese was brilliant with his use of music in his films, and this film is no different. Not only does it include many Dylan songs and performances, it is also packed with performances by many of Dylan's friends and influences including Joan Baez, Woodie Guthrie, Rhetta, Pete Seagar, Peter Paul and Mary, and any number of other figures.

2348924,2,B000A0GP4K,"This is a long documentary from a vastly over rated director that only covers the initial discovery of a rising star. The pic is good in that it shows how Dylan evolves his music from a amateur Woody Guthrie imitation to polished professional, discovering in himself a talent for word play, a fixation with a certain rough edge sound and a desire to express his music only the way he likes.

But it covers only the first decade and a half of his long career, which for youngsters like me - for whom his lexigraphy is already firmly entrenched in legend - omits the musically better, albeit not most influential, portion of his career. It stops in 1966.

When I grew up, Dylan's folk tunes were already the wisdom of the ages: Springsteen was hailed as the new poet for my generation. Yet this was the time Dylan was producing his complete work. It was the 70s when he produced ""epigrams of surrealistic poetry and emotional intrigue"" blended with a blues band. These are the gems that shine today as the best selling Dylan albums of all time.

There is not much on this pic about his family (did he have brothers? Did he involve them in his career? Did he buy Mom a Cadillac?). There is little about Joan Baez, her obviously awesome talent, or his other loves. There is little about how well the songs did on the pop charts, then or now.

Ray, De-Lovely, All That Jazz and Walk the Line are all full Hollywood musical bio-pics that impact not only the joy of the music, but also the character of the artist and the flavor of the times. Sadly, this one does not.",1143676800,7,1561,4.428571428571429

'No Direction Home' is an insightful treasure.  I was thrilled with Dylan's own reflections, musings and memories throughout.  Equally endearing to me is his apparent self-consciousness and humility in his commentaries... his subtle sense of humor is delightful. I was quite impressed by his down to earth, genuine demeanor. Though larger than life, he is a very human man who differs from most of us largely in his courage and persistence in relentlessly pursuing an unknown ""direction home""...

I truly enjoyed the stories of Liam Clancy, Pete Seeger, Joan Baez, and so many others who have known Dylan from the beginning of his career.  The plethora of rare old film footage was definitely a bonus.  The chronicle of his early Britain tour seemed to expose a vulnerability in the young Dylan that I had never seen before.  I found this to be quite poignant.

(This has no particular bearing on the film, but... I was taken aback at the end of the 2nd DVD, about half way through the credits, by Dylan's ""Lay Down Your Weary Tune"", sung from beginning to end. This song has been running through my head since Hurricane Katrina devastated the Gulf Coast. The lyrics are especially powerful to me, and this ended my experience on a sweetly emotional note.)

I highly recommend this DVD set for everyone who is interested in the evolution of music and Bob Dylan's essential role in that evolution.  Kudos to Martin Scorsese for doing this powerful film... a true work of art.  It left me wanting more...

""No Direction Home: Bob Dylan"" (2 DVDs) contains quite a few surprises: first of all, Dylan himself provides commentary in a clear and focused way, not at all as one might expect from an artist who mostly appears on stage aloof, if not disinterested. Second, the footage that Scorsese uses, is absolutely astounding. Check for example the various Newport Folk Festival appearances. While DVD1 traces the early years of Dylan's childhood, and gives a good musical context of which artists influenced Dylan, the real treasures are on DVD2, and in particular the footage from the 1966 UK and European tour. Watch how an exhausted Dylan towards the end exasperates ""I don't want to go to Italy! I don't want to go nowhere! I just want to go home!"" The documentary ends with the infamous ""Judas"" performance of ""Like a Rolling Stone"", which has long been available on CD, but now for the first time is shown on film. And amidst it all, Dylan the elder-statesman comments how sick he was of it all by then (mid-1966). No surprise then that he made such subsequent incomprehensible albums like ""Self-Portrait""! Anything to be one step ahead of the public's expectations.

The DVD comes with a number of extra features, the best of which is a collection of 8 Dylan performances, including early TV performances, ""Mr. Tambourine Man"" from the 1964 Newport Folk Festival, an unfinished ""I Can't Leave Her Behind"" from his hotel room in 1966, and 2 more songs from the 1966 UK tour.

2348934,5,B000A0GP4K,"This documentary is really LONG, but it is more than WORTH watching. Why? Because it tells us a lot about Bob Dylan, or at least as much as Dylan himself is prepared to say for now.

 ""Part One"" of ""No direction home"" goes from the late 1950's to 1963, and deals with the place where Dylan grew, and the kind of music he liked. I found this specially interesting, as I hadn't heard of Woody Guthrie, Tommy Makem, and others that had an enormous influence on Dylan. I enjoyed watching and hearing him as he developed as an artist, and changed accordingly.

""Part two"" covers the period that goes from 1963 to 1966. It is very good, and has great footage of Dylan's concerts, like ""Part one"". The main difference between the two dvds probably is that the second one lacks the kind of explanation regarding the historical context that the first one has. All the same, it is enjoyable, and only obviously in fault when compared to ""Part one"".

This documentary includes lots of footage of the young Dylan and comments made by the ""old"" Dylan, the person that young and gifted man grew up to be. Not only that, but there are also quite a few interviews of people who knew him at one moment or the other, and that help to shed some light on him. The interviews that involve Joan Baez are probably the most insightful regarding Bob Dylan's character, and his refusal to be trapped in a role as symbol of the left.

I think that if there is a constant in Dylan's career, it is probably the fact that he refuses to be pinned down, to be anything other than himself, and that is nothing less and nothing more than what he feels like being at the moment. ""No direction home"" shows that, and I think we should congratulate Martin Scorsese for that. So... thanks, Martin, but please bear in mind I really, really want to watch the sequel  :)

The sections I liked most in this doc are the sections (interspersed throughout) where Dylan, the way he looks today, sits there and simply talks about how he felt about events that took place during the 60s--and touches on some other things: the town he grew up in, hearing J. Cash sing for the first time, etc. This guy Dylan, to me, comes across as a genuinely decent, intelligent human being--and I truly dug that.

Am also  thrilled that he had the smarts to stay clear of all those missguided commie types (who shall go nameless here).

What I have to say  to all those pro-commie goofballs is just this: try living in a communist country before you go around praising communism to us. How's that? Can you grasp that concept, folks?

Lastly: wished they could have gone past the year 1966 here a bit, to see and hear Dylan sing some of his other tunes.

Keep making music, Mr. Dylan. Stay true to yourself. I know: ain't always easy, but you've managed it so far.

Suggestion to all the journalists: can we please stop reffering to this guy as ""the reclusive singer/songwriter?"" How can he be reclusive--when he's on every CD he's ever cut, ever book he's ever written--not to mention all the documentaries he's been in? Give us a break, will you?

Want to talk about ""RECLUSIVE?"" The great writer B. Traven was RECLUSIVE--and not someone like Bob Dylan. He's even appeared in a Bloody Sam flick, for Pete's sake.",1139270400,4,1630,4.517006802721088

Out of this material emerges the tale of Dylan's rise to fame, the sources of his music, the themes of disguise and homelessness that have run through his art ever since.

Scorsese's documentary on the artist as a young man is a work of art in itself.  Despite its length, it leaves the viewer asking for more.  Like many fans, I'm desperate to see the complete song sets of the legendary 1966 Tour.",1138406400,,829,4.851063829787234

However, what elevates this to 5-star status is the superb footage of Dylan performances through the years, from the early ""protest"" songs to his seminal 1966 UK tour.  The full-length version of Dylan singing ""Like a Rolling Stone"" on the 1966 tour is a brilliant display of an artist at the peak of his powers.

""I've never written a political song. Songs can't save the world.""

-Bob Dylan

Throughout Martin Scorsese's two-hundred minute documentary we get to see Bob Dylan squirm under a barage of journalist questions. Several times he just asks the questions right back at them, and at one point starts snapping pictures of the photographers themselves. Dylan is portrayed as a chameleon, refusing to be a spokesman for the left or put on a pedestal by the folk movement. The closer Scorsese gets to his subject the blurrier he becomes.

The story of Dylan is framed nicely within the turbulent times his music came about. When pictures of Dylan's sleepy Midwest town is flashed across the screen it's apparent that the straight laced conformity was indicative of the nation as a whole.

No sooner are we are introduced to the restless kid who enrolled in college but never went to any classes, then we see him skirt to New York where he is rumoured to have followed in the footsteps of the old bluesmen, and sells his soul to the devil. Shortly after, his mediocre playing is transformed into confident musicianship.

During the times Dylan is in New York you can almost feel the pressure that was building in America. This is also the time where he probably gained a political consciousness that he would later accept or deny depending on how he felt, or maybe on who was asking.

The majority of the concert footage contains booing and heckling from the crowd. I had always heard about the controversy concerning Dylan ""plugging in,"" but it is something else to actually witness it.

This documentary has a long running time, but it never dragged. I was constanty intrigued, and always engaged. No Direction Home is richly layered and deals with a lot more than just Bob Dylan -- I'm sure I don't understand half of it. Scorsese show us a scene of Andy Warhol and Dylan right before he cuts to some British fans deriding the new Dylan music as ""pop."" As is the case with any Scorsese movie, it is about a lot more than what's up on the screen. In some way No Direction Home is about the changing art of the sixties. It was this decade that modernism started to visibly give way to the post-modern movement, and that's represented here as Dylan claims his music is a collage of influences.

The relation between Dylan and his music also intrigued me. The Beats and many of these folk musicians viewed art as a truthful unveiling. Much of this film will have you wondering if Dylan's music concealed as much as it revealed. The idea of an artistic ""Truth"" is chipped away at, and instead Dylan lets little ""truths"" slip out of his art. There is an act going on whenever Dylan writes a song, and especially when he performs a song. At times it is almost as if he is creating a personality out of bits of images and sounds he finds in the world, and then puts them together to create something fresh.

The film manages to deal with multiple themes without losing sight of its subject. In fact, it is precisely because the film deals with so much that it didn't lose my interest despite its length. Scorsese has shown us one of America's great artist, and in the process proves that he also belongs in that category.",1138060800,6,3254,4.602763385146805
2348942,1,B000A0GP4K,"Bob Dylan thinks putting out of movie of him talking is supposed to be cool? Granted there are some performances but its all in black and white!!! And sometimes there's no band, just him and his boring guitar and harmonica. He doesn't even try to solo. I've seen much better rock performances by the likes of Dokken, Ratt, or Poison (take your pick). At least these newer bands look like they're trying to have fun. Bob Dylan just mopes and poses but never rocks out. Funny thing is people just seem to gobble this suff up. Sometimes there's no accounting for taste :(",1137628800,6,568,4.524271844660194
2348943,5,B000A0GP4K,"I first saw this documentary on my local PBS station when I was in the hospital. The first thing I did when I got home was order this DVD. I still watch it frequently because there are so many subtleties that you need to see it again and again to appreciate what a truly masterful piece of work that Scorsese made here. My musical preferences were forged during the 50's and 60's folk revival era. Perhaps the most important new figure to have arrived during that time was Bob Dylan. This DVD paints a rare portrait using tones and settings that are indescribably effective. For instance, while riding on a train to who-knows-where, Tony Glover tells of how Dylan came back to Minnesota from NYC able to pick and play the harmonica as if he had made a deal with the devil at the crossroads.  Dylan jokingly corroborates the story. And, Liam Clancy relates his Dylan anecdotes over a pint of Guiness at a bar where a mural of a very shocked looking visage of Dylan Thomas presides. Rare performances and very early recordings punctuate this most riveting documentary.

Pete Seeger referred to the folk performers of that day as all being ""Woody's children."" In this documentary, Scorsese has put together a very fine family reunion",1137542400,6,1230,4.689814814814815

2348945,5,B000A0GP4K,"I've been a Bob Dylan fan for a few years now, but the feeling has been reinforced a thousand times after seeing this. I always thought that the best Dylan was the mid-60's Dylan. After seeing the film, I have a greater appreciation for the folk revival, and some of the music that preceded it. Woody Guthrie was genius, Hank Williams was genius, and the mournful sonnet by Odetta was haunting, but still genius.

The thing I liked most about the movie was that the viewer was able to identify with the thought process of Dylan. You were able to personally feel what he felt. I was very proud of the fact that Dylan didn't care what critics thought. He did his own thing. He didn't 'turn his back' on anything. He simply evolved. The roots were still there. It may be true that as an entertainer, keeping the audience amused or 'entertained' is important, but if it means compromising your own wishes and your own amusement, then you've lost your rights to perform.",1136160000,4,965,4.545977011494253

I first started paying close attention to his legacy of work around the turn of the century, and each step of the way I feel more and more respect for what he accomplished and his willingness to take risks and navigate against the current many times.

The documentary ""No Direction Home - Bob Dylan"" by Martin Scorsese, only underscores further what a fantastic artist Dylan is. It follows him from his early days until the time right before his motorcycle accident in 1966, jumping between footage of interviews with the artist, friends, colleagues and people that knew him along the way, and live performances from his 1963-1966 period.

Granted that the special features in the DVD set are not particularly special, the 207 minutes the 2-part documentary lasts feel like a short time, when you realize the transcendence of Dylan's work and how he broke new musical ground along the way. ""No Direction Home"" (a title taken from the lyrics to his classic ""Like a Rolling Stone"") will entertain and inform newcomers into his music and die-hard Bob Dylan fans alike, as it sheds new light on a fascinating era in our contemporary history.",1134950400,4,1237,4.85781990521327
2348948,5,B000A0GP4K,"Every so often something comes out that is extraordinary.
Martin Scorsese took the time to put together a documentary of possibly the finest writer of the 20th Century.
This shows Dylan from his growing up years in Hibbing Minnesota to his coffee house years in Greenwich Village.
For any Dylan fan this documentary is a must. It goes into his rise in detail and has unreleased footage of several performances. Among the performances are This Land is Your Land, which shows Dylan paying tribute to Woody Guthrie.
You also hear a rare recording of Song to Woody from his very first album. You hear a Demo of his classic, Dont Think Twice Its Alright. This recording pre-dates the version from the Freewheelin Bob Dylan. The lyrics are the same as the way Peter, Paul and Mary recorded them on their album.
Masters of War is live and sounds like the version on the album.
I Am A Man of Constant Sorrow is certainly worth the listen..
When the Ship Comes in and Mr Tambourine Man are also very well done.
The version of Blowin in the Wind is a disappointment.
The second CD is loaded with electric tunes he later did.
Dylan himself is interviewed as well as contemporarites such as Joan Baez and others who knew him at the time.
Dylan has always been a very private individual so we finally see the man for what he really is, and what he meant to America in the 60's
I would not only recommend this to Dylan fans but to any historian who wants to know about Bob Dylan.
Martin Scorsese as he did with his blues series has really put a gem together",1134777600,2,1543,4.436619718309859
2348949,5,B000A0GP4K,"In ""No Direction Home"", Martin Scorsese gives us a rare look at Bob Dylan's pivotal and volatile evolution from a Woody Guthrie copycat to arguably the single most important solo artist in rock history. And he does so with enigmatic clips of the man himself, old and withered, looking back on a time when everything changed not only for himself but for the world of pop music at large.

The film, which uses Dylan's 1966 British tour as a frame of reference, looks at Dylan's beginnings in the cold wilds of Minnesota, his move to New York and rise to fame in the folk circles, and the moment that he ""plugged in"" and revolutionized music forever. Through it all, there is the music, which really gets a better treatment than in most ""musician bios"". After all, it's the music that made Dylan a landmark cultural icon, and coupled with the various images he adopted over the course of the years (here seen first as a Guthrie acolyte, then a roving folkie, and finally a stoned-out rock god), it is a fitting testament to his aura and appeal.

Much like ""The Beatles Anthology"" some ten years ago, ""No Direction Home"" uses archival footage and modern interviews blended together to present a seamless look at what was, and what is. Scorsese narrows his focus to the years of 1958 to 1966, during Dylan's groundbreaking debut and transformation from the darling of the folk scene to something much more. He intersperses accounts from contemporaries like Dave Van Ronk, Joan Baez, and Allen Ginsburg with footage of Dylan's performances to make a compelling portrait of an American enigma.

That being said, you won't come away from the movie feeling as if you ""know"" Bob Dylan. Such would be impossible, because in some ways it is his mysterious aura that keeps him in the public eye. But whatever you may feel is lacking in your knowledge of the man, you will come to understand the drive behind his music all that much more.

When Dylan first appeared, of course, he was taken up as the second coming of his idol, Woody Guthrie. As he relates in the film, Dylan became disenchanted with the movement and soon began looking for ways out of what he considered a barrier on his artistic growth. What you come away with is the sense not only of how he felt about his transformation to a rock sound, but also how his peers in the folk scene (many of whom praised his early work) felt and why both sides had a right to do so.

Bob Dylan's life and work will always be a source of endless fascination for those continuing generations that discover him. In ""No Direction Home"", Martin Scorsese has given the world a fine look into his most revolutionary period, a time that saw him rise from the Boy-King of the New York folk scene to a pop icon with a poetic license unlike the groups that came before him. And in the middle of the film, Dylan shares the great secret of what fueled all these changes: ""A real artist is never satisfied with what he's doing. Once you get comfortable, that's when you die artistically"" (or words to that effect).

And that, in the end, is the message to take away from ""No Direction Home"", quite possibly the finest musical biography committed to celuloid. It's a must not just for Dylan fans, but for anyone seeking to make a living as an artist. When you have a guide like Bob Dylan to lead the way, it will always be interesting.",1134518400,5,3357,4.549668874172186
2348950,5,B000A0GP4K,"At 3.5 hours this fascinating documentary can cover a lot of territory, and it does. Most interesting for many viewers who know Dylan only as a folk-rock star is the film's portrayal of his emergence from utter obscurity into national prominence by the age of twenty. Looking at old photographs and early footage, we see the first of his many self-inventions, based in large part on the songs of Woody Guthrie and nourished in the creative epicenter of Greenwich Village in 1960.

For anyone who lived through the 1960s, the film also vividly recalls the political and social turmoil of that time, which did much to create the public figure of Bob Dylan the singer of ""protest"" songs. We see him thrust by others into the role of spokesman for a ""new generation"" clamoring for social justice. And it charts the evolution of Dylan into his incarnation as folk rocker, experienced by many loyal fans and other performers as a bitter betrayal, which is where the film leaves us, in the knowledge that he had outgrown one persona to embrace one that would command an even larger fan base.

The film's length also permits reference to a large swath of mid-century musical history, ranging from Johnny Cash to Johnny Mathis. There are also telling glimpses into the recording industry as it both shaped and attempted to anticipate the evolution of popular taste during this time. And there is much more.

What the film doesn't do, even in its interviews with Dylan years later, is reveal him as more than a gifted opportunist who somehow tapped into the collective unconscious of his time (or so his early career is remembered by others in the music business who are interviewed in the film). Even in the rare glimpses into his private life he is, as close friend Joan Baez remembers him, self-absorbed and unpredictable, finally enigmatic.

Special features include performances of Dylan songs by Mavis Staples, Maria Maldauer and others. My favorite is Joan Baez's ""Love Is Just a Four-Letter Word,"" which mimicks Dylan's phrasing at points. For Dylan fans and anyone interested in the history of popular music in America, this DVD set is a total immersion in ten of its most amazing years.",1134518400,3,2186,4.8525469168900806

2348953,4,B000A0GP4K,"""No Direction Home,"" may be the best biography, in any medium, of Dylan out there, except for his own autobiography, ""Chronicles,"" and the works seemed to have happened simultaneously.  It's the artist as a young man, from baby-fat folkie to cadaver like rocker, burning his candle at both ends; and it's the times Dylan helped change - whether he likes to admit it or not.  The press conference clips show Dylan as both a captured and captivating participant - at turns volatile, and humble.  It's also a nice look at his peers and mentors, some self-serving, others, like Ginsberg, deeply touching.  The full-length versions of the songs with Dylan captured in concert, and the other interviewees in relaxed settings are all marvelous.  But its Dylan's rendition of ""Like a Rolling Stone,"" that blows the lid off - the eye-rolling Dylan is inspired, impassioned, and near crazed.  Anyone performing with that much energy could only crash and burn.

But that's it.  Five years in a career of 40.  It's a good stopping point in terms of dramatic arc, but only the beginning of the story, and certainly left me wanting more.  It's going to be interesting to see what comes next, and maybe ""Chronicles, Vol. II"" will be the impetus or co-creative force behind a ""No Direction Home, Vol. II.""

2348955,5,B000A0GP4K,"Try compiling a modest collection of, say, 12 tracks of Bob's greatest songs since the mid 1970s and it soon becomes apparent how much fertility was in the whipper snipper in the 60s. Don't get me wrong. I have dipped into stuff from throughout a career that has accompanied me throughout my maturity. And, yes, I did take succour from,'Time Out of Mind', and'Love and Theft'. There's always something worth listening to on a Bob outing. But we no longer expect, with baited breath, the next move. Scorcese has the same enthusiasm for the prodigious early Bob as all of us that have committed those formative songs to the soundrack of our adolescence. How we were infatuated with the androgny of that face, the eyelids closing as the heavily vowelled rhymes found their way to us. Was this a blokey thing?As a stylist, we took his taste in clothes, and his put-downs of interviewers sent us into delerium. There were no false moves. But you can tell, with the marvels of 20/20 rear vision, that nearing the end of this brilliant doco. if ever a lad was cruising for a bruising, it was Bob. No matter how trifling the bike accident might have been to cause his retirement from the hurly burly of public life, it was just in the nick of time. Sagacious Bob provides the glue to the footage, looking more and more like Keith Richards, these days. There's Van Ronk, the bourgeoise looking Baez, and a glimpse of the ethereal John Jacob Niles. Why hasn't someone reissued recordings of this legend? This film is a great accompaniment to 'Chronicles. Vol 1'",1133395200,2,1551,4.664233576642336
2348956,5,B000A0GP4K,"Well, as a 56 year old, I grew up with Bob Dylan's music. I also lived in New York in the 1960s and spent many of my teenage weekends in Greenwich Village. This film brings back all those days magnificently. Martin Scorsese after his brilliant ode to the Blues in 2003 has done it again! This 4 hour journey is worth watching again and again. You see new things each time you watch it, a mark of a great filmmaker! It just screened on TV here in Australia last week, but the DVD has been available here for over a month.

My music interests are primarily a love for the Blues (see my reviews), but this film clearly puts the link between folk and blues together. My favourite parts of this DVD are the ""Electric"" folk Dylan performed with the Paul Butterfield Blues Band, Al Kooper (Blues Project, Blood, Sweat and Tears) and Mike Bloomfield. Films of Mike Bloomfield playing are exceedingly scarce (Monterrey, The Recent Blues Reunion DVD). Dylan unfolds the story of him meeting Bloomfield and asking him to help him go electric. They even show part of the set they did at Newport! You can hear but not see Mike! For the uninitiated, hear Mike on the PBBB East-West CD.

This film follows Bob Dylan through his early career in the 1960s until his motorcycle accident towards the end of the decade. It is a perfect time frame. It shows the social and cultural changes in America, how music was part of them and how they contributed to the outcomes. We who were young at this time remember these days well- Civil Right's, The Women's Movement and  Vietnam! However, what I really love about Dylan in this film is that he shys away from any recognition for his contributions to these movements. Dylan is an enigma and that's always been part of his appeal.

I am a Blues fan and not an expert on Dylan or his music. I found this DVD surprisingly entertaining and very interesting. I loved the way Dylan comes off and a person who did but didn't want fame, the best line in the whole thing is ""I just slipped in the door when nobody was looking and there wasn't anything anybody could do about it!"" He also indicates, like John Lennon did, that his songs were written as clusters of words he liked or sounded good and not necessarily to make any social points. Which I always thought anyway. People read what they wanted to in his music. I do agree with a previous reviewer that the best performance is ""Mr. Tambourine Man"" at the Newport Topical Song Workshop, with Pete Seeger in the background. Great!

This film is an essential addition to anyone's collection.",1132358400,10,2562,4.524838012958964

I'd seen some other films on Dylan before and thought they were pretty good.  This one is the best I've seen so far.

2348958,4,B000A0GP4K,"Bob Dylan is an amazing folk hero from New York and is widely considered a poetic genius who is constantly protesting society's labels and stereotypes. If you aren't yet a Dylan fan, then it's about time you watched this documentary by Martin Scorsese. This is an amazing film that follows Dylan's journey to becoming a folk singer and poet.

The internal story is not told directly in No Direction Home, but one that is shown by a powerful tableau of clips of events of his musical career that are told by Dylan and the people who knew him best. Dylan's simple philosophy is perfectly represented in this thought provoking two part documentary. Dylan is the embodiment of the complicated and skeptical thinking that we all have though few of us ever come to accept.

In the film we see Dylan question society, the media, and himself under the speculation of the public and his fans. He often refuses to do as the media would like and isn't affected musically by his fans or the press. Some of the most entertaining moments of this documentary are the atypical honest answers he gives in his interviews.

While some detractors may find Bob Dylan and this film boring and outdated, the real uniqueness of the documentary is the timeless story of a man's struggle to find fame as well as purpose. Dylan's genius is complemented by Scorsese's brilliance in this amazing film that is engraved with excellence and I highly recommend.",1132012800,2,1428,4.75
2348959,5,B000A0GP4K,"Hands down, the best documentary yet of the 20th century's most significant songwriter/poet, ""No Direction Home"" brilliantly follows young Robert Zimmerman on his journey from Minnesota to New York and his re-birth as ""Bob Dylan.""

The highlights are the interviews Dylan gave to his manager, Jeff Rosen, in which the ever elusive legend seems to let down his guard for maybe the first time, and looks back on the times that he helped shape and which shaped him. Never before has Dylan seemed so relaxed and open.

The concert footage, including legendary performances at Newport and at the famous ""Royal Albert Hall"" concert, is extraordinary, but there is much to savor here, including witty and insightful reminiscences from Dylan colleagues, including Joan Baez, Alan Ginsberg, Bobby Neuwirth, and, most memorably, the late, great Dave Van Ronk.

Martin Scorsese is less a ""director"" here than a sculptor, having taken miles of rare footage and shaping them into a compelling narrative for PBS' excellent ""American Masters"" series. The footage includes performances by some of Dylan's contemporaries, as well as his influences, all of which help put his career in perspective.

""No Direction Home"" only follows Dylan through 1966, the year of the motorcycle accident that provided him with a much needed respite from the madness of fame. There's a lot of ground yet to cover, including Dylan's remarkable series of 70's albums (""Blood on the Tracks"" through ""Slow Train Coming""), his controversial conversion to Christianity, the downward spiral of the 80s, and his return to form in the 90s when the Never Ending Tour was in full swing. This is one time when a sequel is not only welcome, but necessary.

He can hardly hide his glee during the song, presumably aware of the ground-breaking aspect of this complex song. It's ironic to see Pete Seeger tapping his foot in the background, clearly enjoying a song that pointed the way to Dylan's electric transformation a few months later.

2348961,5,B000A0GP4K,"I will watch any 3 1/2 hour Bob Dylan documentary.

I will watch anything directed by Marty Scorsese.

Although Dylan proves himself to be the ultimate fibber, I am fascinated by anything that comes out of his mouth while talking or singing. He's been blowing smoke up everyone's behind since 1962 and I can't respect him more for doing so. Short of Axl Rose, I can't think of anyone who has sabotaged his career more and more, over and over, just to mess with us. But in Bob's case, each time he comes out looking more like a genius, while Axl looks for rent money.

Bob Dylan will never give a straight answer. We all know that. So, why do we sit for 3 1/2 hours waiting for one? For the same reason we'd sit for 8 1/2 hours for one. If we got one, we'd quit waitin'.",1130544000,4,769,4.1824324324324325
2348962,5,B000A0GP4K,"I waited for this documentary in the same way that Joan Baez waited to hear Bob Dylan for the first time; the hype was too good to be true, she said, and so she went to see him only to find out it was as good as portrayed. That was my hope, that it would be as good as it was hyped to be, and I was not fully satisfied.

I was more than satisfied with Part One (late 1950's-63) - very little psycho-babble on his childhood; merely shots of his face as a kid fading into the music which influenced him. The arrangement of the old footage from Woody Guthrie to Tommy Makem and the Clancy Brothers(they even had the legendary John Jacob Niles!) was genuinely exciting; it was Dylan without warts (the guy stole 45 invaluable records from a generous folk music collector, justifying it by claiming to be a musical expeditionary, and with a straight face); and Dave van Ronk was a genuine character, stating that Dylan was comfortable with the Left, but not really a man of the Left. Yet the Left cottoned on to him, seeing him in terms of an activism which was not fully there (compared with Baez or the courageous Pete Seeger). This told me far more about the wish-fulfilment of the US Left in the early 60s than any other programme. The Dylan performances were gems. So - Part One was excellent, with the music and the historical contexzt reinforcing each other.

But - Part Two (1963-66) did not live up to my expectations. The great performances by Dylan were there - they even had the legendary British concert where someone called out 'Judas' as he began Like a Rolling Stone, leading him to spit back 'you're a liar' and to use the song like a gun against the critics in the crowd (they had been partly organised by the British Communist Party, who were angry at Dylan's withdrawal form political folk music). The historical context was there at the start, but then suddenly stopped. It became one-sided - a chronicle of his performances, at its best a recognition that Dylan's breath-control in the 1964-66 period was an expression of beat poetry set to electronic sound (Whitman and Ginsburg used breath as a more natural means of organising the poetic line than the artifical iambic pentameter).

But the historical context was missing - what was Dylan's attitude to the Vietnam War? The angst in his music of 1964-66, looking for the desperate and desolate in an age of affluence, was to my mind a reflection of the angst troubling American society as the Great Society was being proclaimed.

Worse, the musical context was missing. What about the Beatles, whose own music was transformed by Dylan, and who helped to transform Dylan (""that's nothing; it's just something I learned in England"")? Dylan didn't stop listening to music in 63; he continued to evolve, and the musical influences on that evolution are missing here. So we are left with the performances, magical as they were.

So - Part Two was not excellent. It was merely very good.",1130457600,3,2951,4.624045801526718

If there were any criticism, I would say there was not enough music presented in its entirety (some musical cuts were too short; others were spoiled by voice overs).  However, the film as a whole is great.

As someone who lived through the period designing posters and saw Dylan both at the Club 47 Mt. Auburn in Cambridge and at Gerde's Folk City in the Village, I especially enjoyed seeing Dave Van Ronk talking about the times.  It would have been nice to see Van Ronk in context - singing ""St. James Infirmary Blues"" or ""He was a Friend of MIne"" to further the connection.

But there is only so much time availble in a two-hour format, and I feel that this will be the definitive Dylan film for some time to come.  I hope there will be a sequel to bring ""Zimmy"" through the early years of this century as well.

2348965,5,B000A0GP4K,"Although some of Bob Dylan's most popular songs and albums were familiar to me from my earliest childhood, I never knew very  much about him or his history.  I watched this Scorsese documentary on TV (on the recommendation of  my ninety-year-old grandmother!) and then rushed to rent the DVD, which I've been watching again and again since.  It's riveting, especially part 2.

It's very interesting to learn about the historical period and the music scene, and some of the interviews, most notably with Allen Ginsberg, are fascinating, but what stand out most for me are the performances and the music.  It seems like Dylan absorbed many influences to invent practically a new art form that combines poetry, music, and performance.  When speaking he seems almost inarticulate.  But the lyrics in his songs excite both the ear and the mind; and the music, together with the rest of his performance, add even more interest, emotion, and pleasure.  Altogether, I found the music and performances, as well as the film, moving and exhilarating.  It does seem that something, if not the holy spirit exactly (as Bob Johnston, a record producer suggests), is speaking through Dylan.

Some of the performances that stood out the most for me before I go on with the rest of the review:

I enjoy the clip of a relatively short-haired Dylan playing ""Chimes of Freedom"" because the performance has such a youthful exuberance very different from some of his others; he smiles and bounces and is playful with the audience, using goofily exaggerated gestures to act out a kind of bashfulness, even telling the audience he loves them.  And, as usual, the lyrics, with their alliteration, rhyming, images, etc., are a treat.  We see Dylan's handwritten ""Through the mad mystic hammering of the wild ripping hail...""

Dylan's wordplay based on signs in the street at the beginning of Part 2 and the ""Subterranean Homesick Blues"" clip from _Don't Look Back_, in which he holds up cards with words from the song on them, are wonderful, quick-paced fun, similar to a poetry slam.

But the later concert performances from 1965 and 1966 are the most stunning.  When I see the black-and-white clips of Dylan performing ""It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)"" and ""Gates of Eden"" I can well believe what Bob Neuwirth says, ""No one had ever seen anything like this before.  No one had EVER seen ANYTHING LIKE this before.""  Or heard.  And I can also understand what Allen Ginsberg means when he says that Dylan at this point in his career became at certain moments ""a column of air.  He had become one with his breath.""  The words and music, and Dylan's intense performance of them, seem utterly, almost shockingly, new and original.

His performance of ""Maggie's Farm"" at the Newport Folk Festival, where for the first time he publicly played with a rock band and was booed, has another kind of exciting energy.

And when I see Dylan performing ""Visions of Johanna"" on his 1966 tour, I understand what Tony Glover says in his notes to Vol. 4 of the Bootleg Series: ""He has a wired-to-the-bone stoned fragility that makes it look like he might vanish in a burst of flame at any second....You can see the ghost of electricity in the bones of his face for sure....""  Incandescent.  It is moving to see how much emotion he feels while performing, to see how close to the edge he is living, and to see the defiant energy with which he responds to the hostile audience when he plays ""Like a Rolling Stone.""

Various people who worked with Dylan describe what fun it was to work on _Bringing It All Back Home_ and _Highway 61 Revisited_.  Bob Johnston, the record producer, says that the music was changed ""by freedom.""  There were no clocks, people just came in and played and experimented together, and ""Dylan just always did what he wanted."" We get to hear how the songs changed, and we get to hear the brilliant first verse of ""Highway 61 Revisited"" and part of the wonderful ""Ballad of a Thin Man.""

Seeing all these various moods, personas, and sides of Dylan and watching his development is fascinating.  I guess all along he's trying to be ""who I am"" though other people just want him ""to be like them.""  (Sorry, I haven't quite memorized all his lyrics yet.) I agree with Dylan that his later songs are just as much protest songs as his earlier ones, but I wish he'd been able to connect the personal with the political more in his later songwriting, to combine the rock band, surrealist lyrics, and introspection with more direct politics and social consciousness--after all, what could be more surreal than politics and the workings of power? And what has more effect on the lives and feelings of all of us? (Also, I have to say that, even taking into account his youth, his inebriated state, the emerging battle between the generations, and his discomfort at feeling pigeonholed into a role he doesn't want, his speech to the Emergency Civil Rights Committee is very painful to hear.  I couldn't imagine how he could have the stupidity and gall to think such things and to say them to the likes of James Baldwin and other people who were fighting such hard, essential battles for all of our lives--and who were giving him an award--until I read on the Internet his explanation of what he meant and why he said it.) Nevertheless, I have to feel glad when he says that he ""ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.""  Home is where the creative spirit is.

Scorsese follows the thread of ""home."" Dylan says that when he was a child, listening to country music on the radio made him feel like someone else, a totally different person from somewhere else, who maybe even had different parents.  He leaves home the day after graduating from high school.  He goes through different artistic stages and says that artists must be careful never to think that they've arrived, that they'll be okay as long as they're constantly in a state of becoming.  On his European tour before his 1966 motorcycle accident, we hear him talking about how long he's been on the road and then asking someone, ""do you know what home is?,"" and saying that he doesn't want to travel anymore, that he doesn't want to die in a plane crash in Sicily, that he just wants to go home.  And then there's the ""Judas concert"" clip that ends the movie with the poignant ""how does it feel, to be on your own, with no direction home, like a rolling stone?"" (""Lay Down Your Weary Tune"" plays during some of the closing credits.)

The music and images in the last sequence of the movie, starting with ""Visions of Johanna,"" are especially powerful.  Now I want to buy all of Dylan's CDs through 1966.  My grandmother is looking forward to listening to them too.

For various reasons; possibly lack of appreciation at the time as well as Dylan's famous introverted antipathy to being filmed, there is little quality footage of this early and exciting period especially the electric with The Band. Don't Look Back is excellent but it is strictly acoustic. The Eat the Document Video is the closest thing I have seen but it contains so little of Dylan singing and performing and much is wasted on banal incidental peanut gallery footage for which its filmmaker (Pennebaker) deserves eternal condemnation. However, what snippets of Dylan singing and performing that it does contain are priceless gems that are poignant reminders of how great this film could have been. Now we finally have a film that lives up to the teasing and tintillation of Eat the Document. Pennebaker should take a lesson from Scorcese about how to make a real film and not a kaleidoscopic collage of garbage. No Direction Home is a true smorgasbord of bliss for the Dylan fan. Finally, we have the performances that have been denied us for so long. Scorcese gives us a nice chronological history of the rise of Dylan punctuated by numerous lengthy snippets of songs and performance footage.

There are old home movies of his hometown of Hibbing Minnesota, and the influences along the way that shaped Dylan into the premier spokesman of his generation. Influences like Woody Guthrie, old bluesmen, Bobby Vee and many others.  His early New York folk singer days with Von Ronk, Joan Baez, Clancy Brothers and more, paint a vivid picture of what the New York folk scene was in the late 50's and early 60's.  One fascinating segment was how the ""suits"" at Columbia Records were scratching their heads at John Hammond's recommendation of signing him up on that label in 1962. A label that had Johnny Mathis, Tony Bennett and Doris Day and Mitch Miller as head honcho. He revolutionized how songs were written and how songs were sung.

Some things that struck me - how incredibly lame some of the questions from the press were at the time to Dylan, a ""misunderstanding"" between Baez and Dylan still exists today, how changeable Dylan's choice of music has been (rock,folk, protest (anti-war), country) - is this to maintain his or his audience's interest?, and the utter beauty of Joan Baez's voice.

Even Bob does not understand Bob. I think, and bear with me on this, that when someone has a mind that is processing information in a non-traditional way that it is impossible to explain these processes to the rest of us. It is probably not possible to linearize and explain what is going on in his head. The word I'm struggling for is ""ineffable"".

2348978,5,B000A0GP4K,"I have been an avid Dylan fan from the begining. I doubt any other director than Martin Scorsese could have captured such an elusive target as well as he did. I do rank ""The Last Waltz"" a sligh notch higher.

My few complaints with the film are this: First of all, in spite of a lot of footage of them, The Band is barely mentioned. After not touring for 8 years it was The Band he toured with. Several of their members were about the only people he ever co-wrote songs with. Two of the most famous bootlegs were ""The Basement Tapes"" and the ""Royal Albert Hall Concert"", both with The Band. Some of the finest music ever.

Secondly, I wish there was more of his carrer than after 1966. The tidbit with one of his heroes, Johnny Cash is just mentioned.

Inspite of this, it is a great look at a great man. By today's hyper-commercial music as product era, I can't imagine news that people were booing at a Britiany Spears concert for selling out!

In the second disk you see him begin to unravel. The innane questions at press conferences show real humor. I loved the one where he was asked how many protest singers there were. ""About 136"", he said! He really paid an emotional price for playing the music he wanted and this clearly comes out in the film. Thanks to D.A. Pennebaker's work. This is summed up in the end of his European tour when I says in an almost plaintive voice, ""I want to go home.""

Last thing, I hope that D.A. Pennebaker releases ""Eat the Document"" after seeing so much of it in this film it whets my appetite for the whole thing.",1129334400,2,1552,4.319587628865979
2348979,3,B000A0GP4K,"I wholly understand some reviewers' frustration with director Scorsese's ""artistic pretension"" in the construction of ""No Direction Home"" - the use of Dylan getting booed during his ""electric"" set on a British Tour in 1966 as a link to various aspects of his life and career.

Personally, I found the device both fascinating and helpful. I walked away with the feeling that I finally understood what Dylan was about: all he ever wanted from the get-go was to be a rock 'n' roll star.  His immediate goal, as shown in his high school yearbook, was to ""join Little Richard."" That's about as far removed from emulating Woody Guthrie as you can get without dyeing your hair fluorescent pink.

By the time Bob Zimmerman graduated, there wasn't much of Little Richard left in ""rock"" music; top 40 radio had been overtaken by the Fabians, the Ankas, and those three other Bobbys: Darin, Vee and Vinton. So Dylan discovers folk music, and is captivated by its raw honesty - something the young man from Hibbing has a problem with, given the tall tales about his upbringing.  Still, he pursues the genre, eventually discovering his prowess as a writer.  On his way to becoming the poet laureate of the coffee house, his songs grow more and more abstract, which eventually earns him the blind adoration of the great unwashed and the scorn of genuine poets like Ewan MacColl.

Nevertheless, there's no denying he became a driving force.  And yet... every time somebody makes a statement about Dylan's contribution to the music, or his impact on audiences, or his effect on other folk musicians, the man himself responds with comments like: ""That wasn't my thing."" ""I didn't mean for that to happen."" ""I couldn't understand where they were coming from."" ""That wasn't what I was trying to do.""

Well, what WAS he trying to do when he was knocking every folk artist, from Baez to Seeger, for a loop?  Dylan won't tell us, but according to Scorsese, he was just making his way back to rock 'n' roll.

Thus, at strategic moments throughout, we pop back to 1966 and watch electric Dylan on stage getting harrassed.  Of course, he's thoroughly stoned - presumably to anesthetize himself from the rejection.  You're a rock musician, Bobby... happy now?  Hmmmm, apparently not.

Ultimately ""No Direction Home"" is as transparent as its subject tries so very hard not to be.  It does, however, strive for an enigmatic ending.  When all is said and done, you're left to ponder: did Dylan realize at the time that the rock 'n' roll dream for which he'd bolted Hibbing wasn't all it was cracked up to be, or did his post-tour motorcycle accident simply knock some sense into him?  Surely it had to have been one or the other.

2348982,5,B000A0GP4K,"Martin Scorsese's film No Direction Home, which I watched last night, provided an absorbing three and a half hours of insight into Bob Dylan's early life and his emergence into prominence and controversy in the mid sixties. I mention the duration of the movie because I can rarely sit and watch for so long without my attention wandering. Not in this film. Before remarking on the content of the film, it is worth considering Scorsese's direction. I recommend this film to anyone interested in watching or in making documentary film. The way in which archival material, concert footage and interview segments are integrated and paced is masterly. The film really tells a story and creates an atmosphere: I felt as though I was there. Scorsese's experience in making feature films has enriched his direction of this film. Although comparisons are silly, it may be his best film. It sent me back to The Last Waltz for comparison of his method.

The film's most valuable asset is Dylan's own recounting of his past, and the most striking point about it is how much interview time in Dylan's early years was wasted in asking often trite questions of this most intuitive mind. He rarely answered them, and often could only express his irritation of the questioner. Scorsese's film of the contemporary Dylan rarely presents the questions, content to record what he has to say. Hibbing, Minnesota is stripped bare. Even Dylan's evasiveness, when dealing with his more questionable behaviour to friends and colleagues, is revealing. There is a conflict between Scorsese's intention to make a coherent narrative and Dylan's lifelong habit of crossing borders and categories, throwing dust on his trail and refusing to be pigeonholed that adds an interesting tension to the viewing.

The main thrust of Scorsese's film is the impact of Dylan's crossover to electric instrumental accompaniment. Listeners then had become divided into self perceived groups, the folk 'purist', social conscience type and the mindless consumers of pop pap who just enjoyed the music, and Dylan outraged everyone by moving between these groups freely. His motives were neither pure nor particularly self aware. From the perspective of our own times the differences between these types of music seem less extreme: both were commercial entertainment; listening to a protest song was often a substitute for more committed action. Yet at the time the difference was important to those who were there. From the conflict that ensured, the boos and the cries of traitor, there would emerge something new in pop culture, the pop music artist, and Scorsese doesn't let us forget it. One disadvantage to this emphasis is that it focuses on the same period and phenomenon as Pennebaker's Don't Look Back, which is even quoted in Scorsese's film. The Pennebaker film (a masterpiece) has been available on DVD for some time, and most watchers of No Direction Home would be familiar with it (note the similar inspiration between the two titles).

The film reveals Dylan's background, and then moves on to an overview of the music he grew up listening to, from Hank Williams to Muddy Waters, fascinating to those interested in developments in popular music. The society of Dylan's youth is sketched in vividly: Cold War, Greenwich Village, the folk music scene, the civil rights movement, the birth of folk-rock. The controversy over Dylan's move to electric instruments in the mid 60s is shown through concert footage. We see the Dylan who found, used and then dropped Woody Guthrie, Joan Baez and many others. One comment, that Dylan was like a sponge, reminded me of a similar comment about George Gershwin, who absorbed, or 'stole' elements from all the popular cultures of his time. But transformed them. This was the Dylan who became, unexpectedly, a pop star, who poured out a stream of literate, introspective pop lyrics which made pop culture 'respectable' to the intellectuals and had a transforming effect on the way popular music was presented by other artists. In a way Dylan could be said to have re-invented pop music in this period.

So, everyone has his Dylan. In the 60s Dylan was for some The Genius; for others he was The Poet; for others again he was The Traitor. These are all projections of our own that tell us what we are looking for. No wonder Dylan dodged like crazy. Today if you become a star you deal with it by making it a persona, or you self destruct by taking it all seriously. Dylan survived because he had many personas. This film is Scorsese's Dylan. We'll never know Dylan's Dylan.

Scorsese's film covers the period 1941 to 1968, when Dylan suffered injuries in a motor cycle accident when he was about 26 years old. Therefore the film does not deal with a lot of important things about Dylan: his marriage and family; his influence on popular music, especially on the Beatles; the literary value of his song lyrics and his stature as probably the greatest of popular song writers; his use, even quite late in his career, of traditional melodies (which is common folk practice); the creation of country rock; the disintegration and self healing recorded on Blood on the Tracks; his various religious affiliations; and his non musical activities such as paintings and novels. If anyone reading this knows Martin Scorsese would they ask if a second film is going to be made covering this material? Probably the elusive Dylan would consider it too defining and completing a study to be made in his lifetime, but you can only ask.",1128988800,6,5519,4.949298813376483

2348985,5,B000A0GP4K,"What a daunting task director Martin Scorsese had in approaching this subject.  Throughout Dylan's 45 year public career he has defied easy definition.  Imagine if Scorsese decided to tackle the total of Dylan's career and not just up to 1966.  By using archival materials and interviews with Dylan's contemporaries and associates Scorsese tries to give us an idea as to who Dylan is but that even proves elusive.  The interview subjects even seem befuddled by Bob.  Even interviews with Dylan himself prove to be evasive and cryptic. Scorsese, a noted music buff, painstakingly catalogs potential influences on Dylan from the folk, blues, rock, and country-western scene.  That approach even hits a brick wall because alot of the artists in these genres consider Dylan to be traitorous.  Anybody going into this film looking for the definitive portayal of Dylan will be sadly disappointed.  Anybody who has followed his career to any degree know that's an unattainable task.  I've seen Dylan four times in my life since 1981 and at no one concert were my expectations met, the least satisfying being the 1986 tour with Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers as his backing band.  Would I go back?  In a heartbeat.  Dylan may not meet my preconceived expectations but at least he's an artist who does things on his terms.  Scorsese is an artist in another medium who recognizes that and is shrewd enough not to box Dylan in but allow us to make our own judgement.",1128729600,,1456,4.893877551020408
2348986,2,B000A0GP4K,"It's hard to tell which is more confusing - this terribly unfocused rambling documentary or its insufferable subject. Bob Dylan has always struck me as nothing more than a very coy businessman. With a few exceptions (Tangled up in Blue, Shelter from the Storm), his music is quite feeble in terms of melodic composition, lyrics and actual performance. This documentary, like many of Dylan's sheep fans, confuses pretentiousness with profundity. I gave it two stars for the backround scenery in the old film footage.",1128729600,8,515,5.142857142857143
2348987,4,B000A0GP4K,"Like so many here, I am curious about Bob's life ... especially the early years. Seems to be so much just passed over or avoided on this dvd ... so there's still a lot of mystery. What about his family, parents and so on?

The one gripe I have is that Bob's MAIN influence once he hit New York was easily Ramblin' Jack Elliot!!! I mean they even called Dylan ""Son of Jack' back then. Jack lived with Woody and his family basically ... Dylan just visited Woody in the hospital once I believe. It was Jack's mannerisms and more advanced guitar techniques that Dylan copped to perfection. I don't think there was even a mention of Ramblin Jack in this documentary!!! For shame Bobbie.

A great companion dvd is 'Ballad Of Ramblin' Jack' done by his estranged daughter. A better documentary in my opinion on many levels if one is interested in the times when Dylan and so many fantastic folk artists bloomed in NY. You'll gain a ton more insight regarding Woody via Arlo and his sister and learn a few new things about Dylan along the way.

I was let down that Dylan and Martin avoided the area of Bob's greatest influence back in those days. Watch both and you'll see what I mean. Otherwise, fun to see the old footage and relive those wonderful days of real music.",1128643200,5,1262,4.431034482758621
2348988,3,B000A0GP4K,"Although this film is a must-see for anyone with even the slightest interest in popular culture let alone Dylan-heads, Scorsese has botched the story. Covering only the childhood and first several years of his career, this should have been an easy story to tell: Childhood, hero of acoustic folk, controversial decision to go electric.  But Scorsese has muddied it by plopping, randomly, scenes from Dylan's electric period with fans complaining about it throughout the entire documentary! This happens like 5 times during the film. It is annoying as hell to have this constant negative mantra throughout the film, and gives undo importance to these complaints. It also interrupts and confuses the story he is trying to tell. I've already talked to young viewers who have said it confused them and appeared illogically constructed. I don't blame them; it's probably the worst ""artistic"" device I've ever seen in a documentary and it marrs the formative years of his career.  In fact, all you have to do is edit out these 4 or 5 segments (using your VCR or DVD editing equipment) and the documentary flows 100% better and gives a much more positive feel to Dylan's much-heralded acoustic period. (For the record, I prefer Dylan's acoustic period but still don't like hearing fans complain constantly about his entry into electric music.)
  Once you get past this directorial faux pas, there is still loads of excellent material in this film. Folk singers Maria Muldaur, Dave Von Ronk, Liam Clancy, Joan Baez, and Beat poet Allen Ginsberg are excellent witnesses to the Dylan phenomenon and the whole folk music scene in Greenwich Village in New York City. The Beat poets, the jazz musicians, the bluegrass artists, the influence of past poets-- the whole picture comes alive.  The political consciousness of the folk scene is well represented through the influence of Woody Guthrie, Pete Seeger, and especially through its participation in the civil rights movement.  Liam Clancy, as much an actor as a folk singer, is animated and engaging in his comments, and Joan Baez cracks me up with her dead-on imitation of Dylan.
  The switch to electric music is also well told (if only Scorsese had waiting until this moment to begin commentating upon it), and includes film footage of Dylan's infamous appearance at the 1965 Newport Folk Festival where he shocked the audience by performing a short electric set.
  All in all, it's a superb story about one of America's greatest songwriter, told imperfectly by Scorsese who unecessarily obsesses on acoustic die-hards negavite rants. However, everything else about the film is wonderful.",1128556800,10,2631,5.097674418604651

2348991,4,B000A0GP4K,"Martin Scorsese's lengthy study of Bob Dylan's early years is about as thorough a look at the early 1960's folk music scene as you're likely to get.  Along with Bob, there are interviews with Dave van Ronk, John Cohen, Izzy Young, Tony Glover, Suze Rotolo, Liam Clancy, Joan Baez, even Pete Seeger and Allen Ginsburg--in short, anyone who could be found who was around in those early years.  There is, amazingly, a candid and almost relaxed Dylan himself, offering early memories and reflections on his entry into the music business, some of which is straight out of ""Chronicles,"" but much that is new.  In terms of facts, there is probably nothing here that the committed Dylanologist won't already know--if you've read ""Chronicles"" and Robert Shelton's ""No Direction Home,"" and if you've bought all the ""Bootleg Series"" releases (including the excellent Volume 7 that serves as the official soundtrack to this film), then you're already pretty familiar with what's on this disc.

That being said, there is a cornucopia of visual delight awaiting both hardcore Dylan fan and curious newcomer alike.  The film is rich in images, not just of Dylan, but of the early 60s New York folk scene, including old TV performances and concert clips.  Much of this has never been seen before, and it's an exhilirating treat for the eye as well as the ear.  And it's not just wall-to-wall Dylan: the film does a good job of setting Bob in the context of the folk music boom of the early 60s, in order to highlight just how different, how extraordinary he really was.  In fact, the main theme of the film is how Dylan kept re-creating himself artistically, much to the bewilderment--and sometimes anger--of his fans and colleagues.  The linear narrative of Dylan's rise in first the folk and then the rock world is intercut with scenes from the legendary 1966 tour of the British Isles--footage shot, I assume, by DA Pennebaker for ""Eat the Document.""  Here, the booing and the catcalls are prominent--even more than they are on the Manchester concert recording issued as ""Live 1966""--and we get close-ups of Dylan's bleary, drug-bolstered-and-sleep-deprived eyes as he forces the audience to listen to grungy, elemental performances of his songs with The Band.  Thus, the darling of the folk boom becomes the ""Judas"" who sells out to commercialism.  It all seems rather ridiculous now, but it's fascinating to watch people so upset by Dylan's change of sound.

I'm not sure if, at the end of it all, I understand Dylan the man any better.  For example, the film says nothing about Dylan's relationships with Suze Rotolo, Joan Baez, or Sara Lowndes--so anyone looking for juicy insider gossip won't find it here.  Similarly, a lot of Dylan's childhood is passed over, except for his discovery of Hank Williams and black R & B artists.  Dylan himself is typically offhanded about his work, so we don't get any particular insights into ""Blowin' in the Wind"" or any other song associated with him.  But that's not really the point.  What the film forces us to see--and what really matters in the end anyhow--is Dylan the extraordinary artist, the writer and performer who, as many in the film suggest, had the uncanny ability to absorb the feelings of those around him, and to articulate those feelings as no one else could.  At the same time, when Dylan chose to follow his own creative urgings, there were many who could not accept that he wasn't necessarily supposed to speak for them.  There's still a lot about Dylan that is left unsaid here, so one cannot call this ""definitive,"" but as a portrait of the most amazing songwriter of the 20th century during his most productive and creative time, this film cannot be beat.",1128384000,7,3709,4.857142857142857

I've never seen early live Dylan like this before. But mostly, this paints a pretty good portrait of Dylan's personality, unlike much of what Dylan said to reporters which was usually nothing.

Also, thought it was already somewhat known, Dylan doesn't intend to put a message in his songs, they write themselves from stream of consciousness. Joan Baez is interviewed about Dylan's writing habits. Dylan would sit for hours typing lyrics and then tell her he knew nothing of the contents.

This further extends Dylan's talent and explains some of Dylan's erratic behaviour around reporters when probed with questions he can't answer.

2348996,5,B000A0GP4K,"Scorsese has a knack for taking music as a subject and making a movie that actually has a point. This is in stark contrast with almost any other director's attempts at filming something music related, be it a concert or documentary.

""Typical"" music-based movies feature audience shots, mindless rambling, and an assorted amount of throw-away footage. Most viewers find this stuff horrible - a lesson Scorsese learned as an assistant director on Woodstock: the movie. One could argue that Scorsese wrote the book on how to film a concert with The Last Waltz - the first concert to be filmed in 32mm, to have storyboards, and to have a set designed by Hollywood professionals. After the Last Waltz, Robbie Robertson lived with Scorsese for a little over a year, where they would trade artistic criticism and new ideas. I gather it is precisely because Scorsese truly sees Dylan as an artist that the normally secretive Dylan gave Scorsese the time of day.

With that little pre-amble out of the way, on to the film at hand: For a Scorsese film the message is pretty clear, though I would argue that its presence is something many other directors would fail to achieve. The tone for the film is set early when Joan Baez describes Dylan telling her in the early 60s that someday people will be searching for meaning in his songs, when really they weren't about anything in particular. While that statement is likely not entirely true (who can say for sure besides Bob himself?) the notion of an artist's intent is brought to the forefront.

A bit of background on the subject: Socrates refused to write anything down for fear of misinterpretation. The idea has been articulated and rearticulated over the last two and a half thousand years - once an artist dies, his audience can freely interpret his work. Take for example Shakespeare - who can't remember learning about the notions of tragic hero and tragic flaw and how Shakespeare is a pure genius for intending every other letter in one of his plays to spell some cryptic messages (sorry, that's the bible). When in reality the notion of tragic hero was invented by AC Bradley two hundred years after Shakespeare died, and probability suggests that in any document as long as the bible such coincidences occur (the occur in Moby Dick for example, but enough of the aside).

What is the point? This movie answers the questions ""what is it like to be Bob Dylan?"" ""what is it like to be a pop star?"" and ""what is it like to be an artist?"" Such a life is to have your work constantly scrutinized, with both credit and blame falsely attributed to you. If you happen to be alive at the time of your popularity, such a life is filled with people demanding more of the same, a direct contradiction to the very artistic freedom that led you to such fame. Case in point, during one of the press conferences in part two, someone asks for an explanation of one of the pictures on an album cover, explaining that he had given much thought to its deeper meaning and the placement of a motorcycle. Or at another conference when someone asks Dylan how many folk singers there are (Dylan responds ""136"").

In short the point Scorsese is trying to make is the same point Dylan tried to make in 1966: an artist performs his craft with little explanation. The audience has to make something of it without necessarilly a hand to hold onto. The irony of the situation is how abindantly clear Dylan's message in 1965 and 1966 was in hindsight. Opening Newport in 1965 with lyrics like ""I ain't gonna work on Maggie's Farm no more,"" and singing ""it's all over now, baby blue"" was no coincidence. In England in 1966, at the time during the sets when the booing would get out of control, Dylan would be singing lyrics like ""something is happening, but you don't know what it is.""

To summarize, this film is a well made neoclassical depiction of a modern Shakespeare. To Shakespeare fans out there, not only is that comparison not overblown (I personally think Dylan is the greatest writer of the 20th century, and there are certainly people who would disagree with that claim and others who would defend it, but that is neither here nor there), but perhaps no other writers have been as scrutinized and misinterpreted as William Shakespeare and Bob Dylan.

Perhaps after the new wave of attention the power that be will grant Scorsese the Oscar he deserves, and Bob Dylan the Nobel Prize (he has been nominated several times) he deserves.",1128038400,5,4465,4.680254777070064
2348997,5,B000A0GP4K,"People just don't get it. An artist must always grow, else Art stagnates. Folk Music itself is a protean beast, undergoing an eternal metamorphosis. Unfortunately, those who are not True Artists believe that Artists must remain the same, and continually rehash their original triumphs.

Real poets are always misunderstood. Dylan's art is what great art is: paradoxical, multifaceted, impossible to pin down, impossible to ignore. This film is a portrait of Freedom pursued and Freedom attained, only to be condemned by those who do not comprehend and are therefore lost in the labyrinth that Genius inhabits.

Dylan followed his own vision where it took him, heedless of the banal snares and molds within which the small-minded and those lacking in Vision sought to entrap him.

Real poets recognize that the pursuit of Vision is Vision itself, the pursuit of Truth is Truth itself. The path of the Poet is a solitary path, down Diamond Highways, past Twelve Misty Mountains, across Windy Beaches, one hand waving free, silhouetted by the See.

The Poet's path, though personal, is also universal. Look up at the stars. There is mystery there. Can you comprehend it? Must you comprehend it? The mystery of stars IS their Truth, it IS their Beauty. And in the comtemplation of Mystery, there cometh Understanding.

To be a real artist, one must be true to one's own vision. A butterfly is not a butterfly when it is pinned to a board. The small-minded do not recognize protean visionaries. They tell you that when they do not understand something, that there is nothing to understand. They murder to dissect.

Albert Einstein once said: ""Great Spirits have always encountered violent opposition from mediocre minds."" This is still true. You can read it in some of the other reviews of this same film.

Martin Scorcese has proved what a great artist he is, by understanding what makes Dylan a great artist, and by translating the vision of his understanding into great art in its own right.

Unfortunately, the film doesn't go past the middle 60's. In fact, there is far more general documentary of the 60's than there is of Dylan or his music. This film gets bogged down in the 60's and the points that are raised about Dylan in this period could have been made in one third of the screen time.

The folkies come off as naive and self-centered, the rockers come off as sophomoric and insulated.

On the plus side, it was kind of fun (for an old fan) to see Dylan as a young man playing his electric guitar and braying into a microphone in front of a top notch combo of pop musicians, but after a while all the syrupy interviews and congratulatory tales of his genius and all the glances at his face peering out of the darkness pontificating about what amounts to marginalia at best, just get too tedious.

2349003,5,B000A0GP4K,"Dylan is probably the premier American poet post-1960. His songs shimmer in a way that most songs do not but that poems can, and are boosted by his own performance of them, as the fine live selections picked for this film demonstrate. His oft-mocked drone is not in evidence early in his career, this film's focus.

Some reasons suggest themselves here about why Dylan met with such enthusiasm. He entered a folk scene by its very nature about people performing the work of other people, i.e. all those ""folks"" whose music was being rediscovered. So when Dylan began writing his own stuff, instead of just imitating Woody Guthrie, he automatically set himself beyond his peers.

This was an era when young people were musically starved. The pop scene was lean from 1958 - with departure of the first wave of original rockers variously to death, scandal or the Army - to the emergence of the Beatles in 1963. That's why a niche music like folk music could gain as much steam as it did. Dylan, writing with real lyrical power, got better notice at a time when his major competition included Fabian. His fans were the college crowd - people in college, just out of college, or about to go to college. But now, American college enrollments were exploding. If he'd been born 30 years earlier he probably would have been forced to work for a living. (Like all those folks folksingers sang about.)

Today's Dylan seems in the movie refreshingly void of BS, reflecting matter-of-factly upon his life and times. Much of the mystery attributed to him way back when, was bull to begin with, something he may very well have never sought or meant. Many parties were at fault:

--The fans who, worshipping him as an oracle, expected him to be oracular offstage, which he neither was nor wanted to be.

--The starstruck who parsed his every word and action for deeper meaning, like the one who presses him for the real message behind the shirt he's wearing on the cover of Highway 61 Revisited. (Dylan tries to answer him honestly - ""hey, it's just what I was wearing that day, I didn't give it that much thought"" - but the fan won't take that for an answer.)

--The reporters who would ask him whether he was the Voice of a Generation. How could anyone answer that kind of question? If he said yes or even no, he'd seem unbelievably vain. How would he know? Who picks the Voice of a Generation, and how do they let you know? The movie contains a great clip where a reporter asks sonorously how many real folksingers there are. Dylan says, ""136."" The reporter has no idea he's being put on, and presses Dylan on the number. Dylan then says, ""142."" Much of what Dylan said, deemed enigmatic by the wide-eyed, were just goofs told when no straight and sincere answer existed. This says more about the naivete of the public at that time than it does about him.

Alienated young intellectuals found deep meaning in the outrageous, ever-changing lies Dylan told about his past, whether he claimed to be a cowboy, carnie or whatever. They neglected the obvious: as a 20-year-old college kid from a proper, comfortable small-town, middle-class Jewish home, he didn't have much of a past. Hardly anyone does, at 20. And so, he was trying on personae, as young people will. Folkies uncritically ate it up because they themselves were nave, credulous, middle-class college kids rejecting their own backgrounds by singing songs of sailors, miners, Oppressed Negroes and Irish revolutionaries - of those, in other words, from as far away as possible in space and time from Levittown.

Too fixated on his being the Voice of a Generation, the world failed to notice obvious reasons Dylan did what he did. He quit playing folk because the scene got old, and because he wasn't the Pope of the Folk Church of Idealists Struggling for the Oppressed. He was a songwriter who put truths into song as well as anyone ever did, but who was ultimately in the music business,  something inexplicably deemed shameful by folkies. He moved to rock because it was popular - the masses actually preferred electrical guitars to acoustic ones - and because in its exploding musical possibilities circa 1965 it offered more creative room than three-chord folk did. He faked his motorcycle accident because the pressures of pop stardom became too much to bear. And because, in his late 20s, he really wanted a normal family life. His kids, quoted in a recent bio, say he was a pretty good dad.

His milieu couldn't bear to imagine that someone could make these choices - a career? a home life? kids? Quel horreur! - or that this shows how smart, normal and well-grounded Dylan actually was. He walked away from folk music because he got tired of being deemed the Voice of a Generation by teenage depressives and other naifs. And he walked away from the same rock star pressures that drive lesser celebrities to drugs or other self-destruction.  Sounds pretty sane, and not really very enigmatic, to me.",1127952000,29,4953,4.721064814814815
2349004,4,B000A0GP4K,"As a fan of Bob Dylan's music, I am not going to analyse him or this documentary piece by piece. He can be (or pretend to be) whoever he wants to be, it doesn't matter to me.

I wanted insight into how he created his music and where he came from, and I believe I gained it by watching this documentary. Bob avoids answering anything concretely in the interview portions of this documentary and remains as elusive as ever, but that does not mean you will not learn anything about the man. This is a time capsule of sorts, showcasing various moments in his early career.

I think this documentary does an adequate job of telling the story of a man who wishes to remain mysterious. And that's all.",1127952000,2,694,4.372093023255814
2349005,1,B000A0GP4K,"I was so disappointed with this documentary. Why does it only go through the late 60s?  Dylan has THIRTY more years of his career, which is ENTIRELY ignored in the film. Martin Scorsese made this? What? Oh how the mighty have fallen. To me, the most interesting part of Dylan's career was when he turned his back on all the folk music/hippy nonsense and got real, real weird - but you won't see any of this in this clunker. Avoid.",1127865600,9,430,4.375
2349006,5,B000A0GP4K,"No one has mentioned this about the film - it really struck me that Dylan's writing seemed to be truly inspired, almost in a spiritual way.  His long, wordy songs seemed to ""channel the collective unconscious"" as someone said - he seemed to be receiving messages from the people, or from the cosmos, or both.  The scenes of him singing at the Newcastle gig made him look transcendent (or high - but if he was, he still managed to nail the songs, and that is a lot to remember.)  I got the feeling that somehow these songs came through him in a way that was beyond his own control.  Sure he was a person who cared about his reputation, but don't overlook, minimize or misunderstand (as some reviewers here have) the brilliance of the songwriting - the poetry - which first changed and then became part of our culture.  The movie is incredibly interesting at a psychological and spiritual level.",1127865600,20,893,4.55625
2349007,4,B000A0GP4K,"Some of the other reviewers here have done a good job of describing the film, so I'll just add:

1. WAAAAY too much screen time was given over to the pretentious,  self-important windbag Allen Ginsberg, who, it should not be forgotten, was a member of and celebrity spokesman for the North American Man-Boy Love Association. My skin crawled every time that twisted, depraved creep appeared on camera. So it crawled quite often.

2. Most of the incredible, rare and first-rate (in sound and picture) concert footage was chopped off way too early. I had no idea Dylan sounded so strong and focused at Newport in '65. Show us the whole performance.

3. To be fair, it should have been pointed out that the electric performances would have sounded nowhere near as good to the audiences of the time as they do in the film. Dylan admits the sound systems were ""archaic."" We hear those performances remixed now and can discern every word and every guitar lead and every organ note. The concertgoer in '65 and '66 heard a distorted, booming, cacaphonous mess. How much different would their responses have been if they'd been able to hear the music properly?",1127865600,7,1150,4.763819095477387
2349008,5,B000A0GP4K,"This movie is great & Bob is special. No doubt. So here's my problem. The movie wants me to believe that lots of people turned on Dylan just because he went electric. But if so, Bob was writing for an audience of total imbiciles - and what does that make him? No mention here of the new lyrics which were a little dark. And then we all had a big psychic crash, which hasn't ended yet. Blame Bob?",1127865600,,395,4.076923076923077
2349009,5,B000A0GP4K,"The only complaint I have is that because it is a documentary, I would've loved to have seen more complete performances. The Newport footage was taken from Murray Lerner's ""Festival"" movie (shot at 4 Newport Folk fests, including the infamous ""Dylan goes electric"" set), which should get the Criterion treatment and put all the performances from the shows he filmed out to the public, because a lot of the artists that performed the shows are no longer with us as well as artists who have very little film footage available. The footage included here looks stunning.

Also, ""Eat the Document"" has yet to be released, the footage shown on the documentary also looks great (although Dylan chopped the master reel up supposedly), with the pre-Band Hawks backing Dylan, but ""Like A Rolling Stone"" does remain intact for the extras.

Keep in mind this isn't a definitive biography of Bob Dylan, but mostly surrounding the years when he was hailed as a voice of a generation and booed as a rock star sellout, with the footage from '66 being intersperced throughout the film, building up to Newport '65. What's amazing to me is how young he was when all of this was going on, and that when he hit big he was only 20.

Scorsese (who had directed ""The Last Waltz"" and has made many documentaries as well as classic films) had said that growing up in NY, he only became familiar with Dylan when he did ""go electric"", so everything he did earlier he wasn't that familiar with.

Seeing Dylan going from this goofy cherub to cantankerous pain in a short amount of time captures him in a way ""Don't Look Back"" only covers the latter, and the inane questions interviewers ask him only make it worse. Baez mentions Dylan's mood swings on stage during his ""folk"" phase, and Seeger's threats to cut the electric cord at Newport are elaborated on.

Where ""Don't Look Back"" captures Dylan as being difficult and mean (""Eat the Document"" footage shows him in an even worse light),and Albert Grossman is mentioned as being one of the reasons for Dylan's change, ""No Direction Home"" kind of shows how he got to that point.

It was great to see interviews with Allen Ginsburg and Dave Van Ronk (who are no longer with us), as well as Pete Seeger, Maria Muldaur, Joan Baez and Suze Rotolo. I would've thought Robbie Robertson would've taken part in it (as he did in ""Last Waltz"" with Scorsese), but the Hawks' drummer (who had put out his own backstage footage on DVD) instead talks about it.

But again, the best part of the film are the performances, a lot of which has rarely been seen outside of bootlegs, and some for the first time. 40-something years later, whether he had center stage as a folk artist or the leader of a rock band, he was a mesmerizing performer, unfortunately over the years he would rarely put on shows with the same level of energy and enthusiasm (except on the Band's 74 tour with Dylan and his resurgence in the 90s-00s to college crowds. Don't write him off yet!). The ""Bootleg Series"" 1964 and 1966 are excellent CDs of his concerts that are captured in the documentary, the CD sountrack to this film is also worth picking up. All his CD from his debut to ""Blonde on Blonde"" should already be in your collection as well as the scrapbook and ""Chronicles"".

Even though this is a great film for future generations getting into Dylan can get into, keep in mind there's some strong language throughout the film. But as far as history goes, you see Dylan performing in DC and was there for the ""I have a dream"" speech Martin Luther King gave, the folk scene and the variety of artists that had used Dylan's songs (it's funny to see Bob with a young Sonny and Cher).

Overall, it's a great documentary that Dylan himself narrates (through interviews past and present) and as far as Scorsese goes, tells the story without trying to be too matter of fact or digging up intimate details (which I'm sure the Dylanologists will again be frustrated by). It's kind of long to watch it in one sitting, but 4 hours is needed to be able to fit it (unfortunately the performance footage is cut for the interviews).",1127865600,,4104,4.60328317373461
2349010,5,B000A0GP4K,"The problem with viewing a documentary about Dylan is that there is a wealth of material that has been released over the years and they fear is that there will be nothing new.  That was the main complaint about the A&E ""Biography"" released a couple of years ago.  It was superficial and not worth the effort.  Sort of like a thumbnail sketch of a great artist.  ""No Direction Home"" by Martin Scorcese is a landmark event in portraying the most important artist of our time.  Not only does the film confine itself to a specific 5-6 year period (1961-1966) in Dylan's life, the great one actually participates in the production.  The key question that Scorcese seems to ask over and over is:  how did Dylan go from Woody Guthrie to completely transforming American music in 5 short years.  Most artists struggle their whole lives within a certain genre and are never able to break through to the essence of the form in which they toil.  Dylan is the Shakespeare of our time, and this film makes it abundantly clear that the artistic process was filled with traps, lies, backstabbing, etc.  Scorcese incorporates never before seen and heard recordings, film, interviews, rememberances, and comments by the master himself.  My first viewing of this film yeilded some interesting results.  Dylan is a very funny guy.  He can tell a joke with just his eyes and to watch him spar with reporters and other ""Mr. Jones'"" is tremendously entertaining.  No wonder this guy didn't care much for the press.  Dylan also offers a few gems during his interview.  My favorite is ""You can't be wise and in love at the same time"".  Upon a second viewing, you definately get the sense that Dylan put up with a whole lot more than most people would have just to practice his art.  Dylan looked weary on the 1966 tour, burned out, despartely tyring to maintain his sanity, while he is ""just trying to get home"".  The added material on the DVD don't really add a whole lot to the presentation but some of the extra's are fun.  The film is genius.  It certainly validates Dylan when he decided to only work with the best throughout the years.  Scorcese really catures the times, the artist, the madness, and the crash.  I absolutely loved it and plan on viewing it whole for the third time within a week of its release.",1127865600,7,2294,4.623762376237623
2349011,3,B000A0GP4K,"I knew next to nothing about Dylan. But why is it that once again a talented artist revered by many has to turn out to be an awful human being? In fact, a comman thief. Stealing someone's record collection is the seventh deadly sin around these parts as far back as I can remember. Someone out there (you know who you are) still has my white vinyl copy of Bela Lugosi's Dead. But to steal someone's song without their permission to further your own career and wallet is a blindfold, cigarette and firing squad offence. It's still a fairly comman thing to happen to this day. The guy he pinched from was wryly avuncular about it in retrospect but I bet at heart it rankled. But what goes around, comes around and very appropriately the offender is called a Judas at the end of the documentary. Actually, the electric stuff sounded alright to me, although the playing of the last song was obviously despondently delivered. If I turned up to see something gentler and had my eardrums assaulted by discordant psychedelia maybe I would have been miffed too. But it sounded okay.

Dylan was different than I expected him to be. With those eyes and that drawl, he rather reminded me of Clint Eastwood. I felt the film was too hard on journalists. It's not easy to ask questions about music and some people at least tried to ask something thoughtful, even if it didn't come across that way. Unless it was a contractual obligation, Dylan was big enough by then not to have to do press conferences.

One thing Dylan did get right was in not inviting Joan Baez back on stage with him down the line. It was obvious by the cringe making footage that their two vocal styles were too at odds with each other to come together successfully. But some obsessive out there will probably do a five hour documentary proving just how wrong I am on that point. Wasn't that little girl who sung in the beatnik cafe great, though? Something Maulder. Looked a bit like Cher.

Was Like a Rolling Stone the most important song of all time? Well, it's certainly catchy and if it's catchy then who cares about the lyrics?",1127865600,,2090,4.523809523809524
2349012,5,B000A0GP4K,"Just finished the documentary and while I have seen much of this footage (Don't Look Back is an incredible document)and heard most of the music, I am still blown away by Dylan and what he did and the time he did it in.  Four hours dedicated to such a short and intense span of Dylan's career only added to my belief that he was the Master of Words and the Chameleon of irony.  Scorsese's participation as puzzle master, piecing together existing footage and historical context added to the depth and pleasure of this fine work. Scorcese's editing around the JFK assassination was excellent adding depth to well known footage, as well as Dylan's impact on the time.

During the press conferences and interviews, Dylan continuously denied his role as the leader, genius, voice.  Yet his writing, playing and song selection spoke louder and clearer than any interview.

The culminating event- Newport '65 is covered amply and brilliantly with many perspectives presented.  After 15 minutes of ""electric"" performance (electric in many ways)Dylan and his band leave the stage to hoots and boos. An obviously shaken Peter Yarrow promises, pleads and hopes that Dylan will return with his acoustic guitar.  After a few tense moments Dylan, equally shaken, looking drawn out and sweating, steps to the mike and sings Baby Blue with such intensity and enunciation that I got emotional sitting on my sofa.  The reluctant leader of protest songs pushed himself away with his own eloquent words-  Was that song choice a coincidence, or was he in full control with the ultimate protest?  Check it out and you be the judge.

This is great stuff and I am ready for more whenever Mr. Scorsese wants to delve back in...",1127865600,5,1702,4.875
2349013,4,B000A0GP4K,"This film follows Dylan up until 1966, and it is not THE story of Bob Dylan, so much as A story of Bob Dylan. Those familiar with the history might get a little antsy in places, and at first I was a little frustrated that we find ourselves focusing on the young Dylan most people have in their heads already, instead of the older Dylan who seems the more interesting subject, if only because he's been less exposed. The film tells, in a way, why Dylan probably didn't want to touch on that, why he changed and retreated from view, and the last half-hour approaches the subjective jitteriness of the last section of GOODFELLAS. While not a groundbreaking masterpiece, it is still full of delights -- for instance, I can't get the image of Dylan and a drunk Johnny Cash warbling a slowed-down version of ""I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry"" out of my head.",1127865600,6,847,4.470967741935484
2349014,5,B000A0GP4K,"Bob Dylan was a American kid with a brilliant mind, and nothing to lose. In this beautifully edited film, with awesome, never seen before, vintage footage, Scorsese certainly tells us lots about Bob Dylan, but mostly it is the bigger picture, about  what it means to be an artist, about traveling the unmarked territory that is the artist's map. The times were ripe in 1966 when Scorcese begins this film, for a Bob Dylan. But it was Bob Dylan who was paying attention. Not only does Scorsese show the passion and energy (and ego indeed) that drove Bob Dylan to absorb, find, meet,  everyone of the time, who were valued, incidentally, if they ""had something to say"" more than all else, but the film shows how determined Dylan was to protect his oeuvre, by showing how often he would simply refuse to be pigeonholed, or even to answer questions, in interviews. As Picasso said, "" we do not ask to understand the song of a bird."" This is just amazing, that Scorcese shows us this bigger picture; how art gets made, and how challenging it is to stay authentic. I am a visual artist, and was really not an avid Dylan devotee before I saw this, but his brilliant mind,  irresistable authenticity, even charm, has made a fan of me. The segments of actual interviews with, now older, Dylan are beautifully lit, and reveal a wise and soulful man. One of my favorite quotes, that makes me laugh, was ""You can't be wise and in love at the same time""... This film makes America look good, too, like we are original thinkers who care about more than simply commerce. Scorsese has made a brilliant, important film.",1127865600,5,1602,4.594405594405594

2349016,2,B000A0GP4K,"First off let me begin by saying two things:

1. I've been a rabid Bob Dylan fan for most of my life.

2. I've been an avid Scorcese fan for most of my life.

Too bad this documentary is a flop.  Mostly it's far too long, and covers more of the era and the other bands surrounding Bob Dylan at the time than the actual man himself.  The pace of the documentary is awful, and I could hardly believe the director's name when I read it.

The segements about Woodie Guthrie are interesting, and the concerts where Dylan was booed because he'd gone all ""hippie"" was a neat addition.

Other than that, it gives most fans nothing that they really want to see...which is perhaps a more intimate look at the man behind the legend, not the era surrounding the legend.  And perhaps that is how Dylan and Scorcese wish to leave the legacy.

A legend rather than a hardknock story.

If you want to watch a truly entertaining documentary check out ""Don't Look Back"".  That one is mentioned briefly in ""No Direction..."" and though it's only shot on one of his many tours, it serves as a more entertaining experience.

Also I recommend picking up ""Chronicles by Bob Dylan"".  It pretty much covers the same stuff as this documentary, but it's told by the man himself.  And despite all of his ""experimenting"", he's actually a pretty good writer.",1127779200,10,1327,4.497907949790795
2349017,4,B000A0GP4K,"This is a blockbuster documentary.  I think anyone who likes music should watch an utter genius in formation.  Man, Dylan was great singing that song for ""Wonder Boys."" and to think ""Tangled Up In Blue"" is only considered an average song.  Dylan has lasted because he is vital and important.  I hope he keeps charging forward with his music, because I think he will have interesting things to say as he ages.

As Steve Allen said during Dylan's appearence on that show in 1964, ""genius knows no rules.""  How true it is.  Like most geniuses, Dylan arrives from Hibbing, Minnesota as Robert Zimmerman, like some kind of space alien. He is just a special being not tethered to the reality of place. He could have been from Timbuktu somehow.  It sure didn't seem to matter - or did it.  Perhaps being from the bland post-war Midwest is what gave him the ingredients to work with.

Dylan is an artist.  The reviewer who below said that Dylan was not a poet is politely a nincompoop.  Dylan is a great poet, whose songs transcend his accompanying music and his awful voice.  But who cares about his voice.

In reality, all you hear is the VOICE of a great artist. I was not around during the sixties.  I picked up a Dylan album after listening to ""Dont talk twice it's alright"" after breaking up with a girl.  That song spoke to me, and other songs spoke to me with their simplicity and ther beauty.

In terms of this documentary, the tremendous archival footage is culled together in an utterly interesting and vital way.  You can see Dylan literally discover his genius as an artist.  This documentary captures interviews of the figures in Dylan's life, including the Beat generation poet Allen Ginsburg, Joan Baez, and others.  (Interesting to note is that Dylan says that Kerouac's ""On the Road"" didn't have much of an effect on him.)

This is a film worth seeing because it gives you the life of the artist.  A rare and worthwhile glimpse into greatness.  Imagine if we had the same footage for Michaelangelo or Leonardo DiCaprio (I am kidding :))  I mean of course, Leonardo Da Vinci.  How great would that be, well you have a chance to discover a unique talent here with Scorcese's Dylan.  Enjoy.",1127779200,4,2197,4.612403100775194

I'm living in a time which allows a talentless media slob like Paris Hilton and her ilk to flourish - it's a pleasure to see a real talent, a real artist, a real treasure given the time and attention he truly deserves.

2349019,4,B000A0GP4K,"While watching Martin Scorcese's Dylan biopic, ""No Direction Home,"" I kept wondering just what might have happened if all of the obsessed Dylan-philes from the early `60s had known all the facts as they are presented here. At the time of Dylan's fairly sudden rise to fame, he was surrounded by so many myths - many of them self-perpetuated - that the true Dylan fan of the time could only believe what he heard (or not). This naturally lent Dylan a mysterious aura that only made him more attractive to the fans who wanted to figure him out. More importantly, it also lent his writing that same aura of mystery, leaving every single person who came in contact with his words to apply their own interpretations, or scratch their heads in awe, wondering what all of it could possibly mean. This method of self-mythification worked brilliantly for Dylan, although it also backfired in some ways, especially when it led to people rifling through his garbage for clues, or assigning their own opinions and meanings to words that he did not intend. Nonetheless, it was fascinating to watch the contemporary Joan Baez explain (rather saucily) how Dylan would write some verse that even he considered mysterious, then show it to Joan Baez to ask her opinion. When she offered her own interpretations, Dylan was pleased, and commented that years from now, people would probably still be doing the exact same thing.

Watching the modern day Dylan remove much of the myth that surrounded his early days is perhaps the most fascinating element of this 2-part biography of Dylan's first foray into fame. His lucid explanations of how his thought process functioned back then would have been a Rosetta Stone for the obsessed Dylan fans, but I wonder if they would have believed what they heard, even if they knew that it came straight from Dylan's mouth. After all, they already sensed that he was `colorizing' aspects of his past and so might have considered the source untrustworthy, but more importantly, they probably didn't want to see the myth disturbed. The truth would have made everything so plebian. From today's perspective, though, the truth is just as fantastic as the myth.

Episode one of ""No Direction Home"" covers the time period from Dylan's youth in Hibbing, Minnesota to the fame following the release of his third album. A lot has been made of Dylan's constant reinvention, but few people concede that in the beginning, he reinvented himself with virtually every record. Here, Dylan himself makes it clear that the changes were a combination of deliberation and a reaction to the times. His first album was a quickly assembled hodgepodge of random influences, painting him as an adequate folk singer. The second album launched his career as a serious songwriter, with thought-provoking words and melodies that could be `beautified' by Peter, Paul and Mary or Trini Lopez. A rather telling (and amusing) moment occurs when a music publisher takes credit for making Dylan famous because he managed to distribute his songs among so many different artists. It's a ludicrous claim, but it has an element of truth to it, too, since middle-class America is unlikely to have accepted Dylan without middle-of-the-road artists softening the rougher edges of his own performance.

My only complaint here is with Scorcese's means of assembling some of the footage. Perhaps sensing that he would lose some of his audience if he didn't let us see some `electrified' Dylan, he continually cuts into the future, showing us footage of Dylan and the Band before a hostile English audience. The result is disconcerting, especially since it was usually irrelevant to the topic that was previously being discussed. I think it might have been ultimately more effective to watch Dylan evolve organically into his electrified phase, since it would probably better convey the shock and sense of betrayal felt by his older fans. Instead, it is confusing, especially for younger fans who wish to understand this very important phase of musical history, and it will almost certainly soften the sudden impact of the change when it is covered in part two of this biopic. Nonetheless, this is a fascinating assemblage of rare footage, myth debunking, and revisionist history that does not let go. I can't wait to see part two, and I only wish that Scorcese and Dylan would consider continuing their collaboration, all the way up to the present day.

2349020,5,B000A0GP4K,"If there can be any discernable pattern of development in the early career of Bob Dylan, it is his moving from the idyllic world of simple folk music, to the dirty world of electrified blues.  ""No Direction Home"" demonstrates the direction that Dylan took using newly found archival footage, past and present interviews and incredible performances.  Dylan is often thought of as an American original, but the musical grounds that he has walked on for now over 40 years is well tread.  The originality of Dylan, however, lies in the fact that he took so many different paths as an artist and a musician.  As he said in this film: ""You have to realize that as an artist, you need to be constantly moving.""  ""No Direction Home"" focuses on the first two iterations of Dylan.  The first Dylan in this movie is the folk artist embraced by the Greenwich Village liberals, while the next Dylan is the blues musician embraced by almost no one at first.

The first Dylan songs speak to the future,  (A hard rain gonna fall...) while the next Dylan has his feet firmly planted in the present.  (How does it feel...)  Dylan's recent albums ""Time Out of Mind"" and ""Love and Theft"" reach further back into American musical history.  Unfortunately, the artist (and Dylan is no exception to this) has an unfortunate tendency to wound the people that they leave behind as they move in a different direction.  For example, the bitterness of Joan Baez and Pete Seeger is still palpable in ""No Direction Home.""  Overall, Scorsese's direction is great to watch, but, the last word appropriately should belong to Dylan, ""I wish that I'd been a doctor, maybe I'd saved some lives that been lost, maybe I could have done some good in this world...'stead of burning every bridge I'd crossed.""  (From the album `Infidels')  What makes ""No Direction Home"" such a great documentary to watch is that we get to see Dylan burn that bridge with the reckless abandon that we would never expect from a popular musician today.",1127779200,11,1991,4.730434782608696

2349024,5,B000A0GP4K,"I will not bore you with a long review. This is the best video of the year. The early Dylan story in his words, the words of his contemporaries with songs, everything! I am so excited by it.

There are even 7 or 8 full length videos of his songs.

I am too busy today to write a full review since I must practice Gates of Eden and It's All Right Ma, I'm Only Bleeding before the open mic on Wednesday.

OK, so last year was Chronicles. This year - No Direction Home.

Now will they start issuing DVD's for all those Dylan live performances and promo videos locked away in vaults, like ""Series of Dream"" and the ""Subterranean Homesick Blues""?",1127692800,5,641,4.2727272727272725
2349025,5,B000A0GP4K,"Bob Dylan's biography on his emergence into the musical (and political) world could not have been documented better than this.  The documental is a real treat. Scorsese really digs deep into the thoughts and actions behind every Bob Dylan move during his rise to fame as a folk singer, a political figure (or so called protest singer), and a true rock icon (to the discomfort of some of the old folk crowd).

But the viewers don't only learn Bob Dylan's history.  This is an up-close-and-personal deal.  Old and private footage combined with current interviews to Dylan and the people who where there with him (and what friends does he make - Alan Ginsberg, Joan Baez, Al Kooper, just to name a few).  Dylan is praised as the voice of a generation and criticized at the same time.  People clap and go wild during the first half of his concerts and boo and call him Judas during the second half.  And Bob Dylan has a lot to say about all this revolt.

Some takes are just extraordinary.  There's one in which he is outside of the store that ""takes your bird, trades your dog, sells cigarettes, etc""... Dylan jumping outside of the store reciting all the probable uses of such weird type of shop.  Or him arriving in Paris with a camera and photographing back to the media.  These are just two though; there are so many more; so many anecdotes and the thoughts, actions, and reactions behind this amazingly creative mind and mysterious character.

Faced with a changing and sometimes discriminating society, Bob Dylan remains humble and sincere.  As he says in an interview: it's not his fault he became a famous musician, it just happened like things happen and fame or glory don't necessarily mean happiness and can be perceived at different levels.  Did he really like becoming such a representative figure?  Did he like his audience and cared about their thoughts and feelings? The documentary gives clues to answer these questions but Scorsese is so sincere and unbiased that really leaves room for the viewer's interpretation.

Time changes, events unfold, and moods are altered. ""Yes, I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes. You'd know what a drag it is to see you"".  (Positively 4th Street). Positively an absolutely successful documentary.  Unprecedented in the history of music.",1127606400,9,2309,4.817258883248731

I am a big fan of Dylan, and have read a lot, but this really pulled the veil off the mystery and showed another side of Dylan.  Pun intended! The quality is great. The content great. And the music is sublime! My only gripe is the extras on disc one the Dylan Performances are not the entire performance, just a replica from that section of the film. On disc two, however, are entire performances, and they are great!  If you are a Dylan fan you will love this disc! I hope and pray he will continue with Dylan's history!

No Direction Home capsules the early years of Bob Dylan with marvelous stills and precious film clips.  The interviews are so well placed within the archival footage, it flows seamlessly as the era unfolds and we watch the birth, the growth and finally the full-grown genius that is Bob Dylan.  Dylan's conversational comments along with the peers who accompanied him on the journey are perfect in pitch.  This is a long-needed film and well worth the wait.",1127606400,5,550,4.881720430107527

The more he tried to say, ""I'm just me."" the more his fans would respond, ""We're just you too.""  Assuming the weight of America's collective unconscious is a heavy burden.  He barely lived through it.

  The most telling bit of his comedic genius as a defense mechanism is when he threatens to play his harmonica about ten times during ""Mr. Tambourine Man"" with a complete straight face.

  This cinematic Confession to Father Martin is the ultimate document of rock neorealismo.  After all, art is a lie that reveals the truth--something Bob Dylan has always understood.",1127520000,5,656,4.881818181818182

2349030,5,B000A0GP4K,"Dylan has always been an elusive subject. Myth and fact cloaking him well on his long journey, and it seems the more we know the more complex the man becomes.

In this 3 hour+ documentary Scorsese weaves a wonderful mixture of archival footage and interviews, with Dylan's insightful narrative, creating what is both an exploration of a career and a keen account of the 1960's music scene.

No Direction Home helps explain the fascination with Dylan as visionary poet and prolific musician.

Scorsese manages to convey Dylan's impact on the folk/rock/country/blues scene illustrating how his mastery of tradition fueled and informed the progress of the genre.

It's a great in-depth look at a long and complicated career and it only covers up to 1966!!

And in the process of telling Bob's rich tale Scorsese reveals,  more than a little, of just how the 'star-maker machinery' turns a man into a myth.",1127520000,2,902,4.940397350993377
2349031,5,B000A0GP4K,"I was out on the deck cooking a steak and listening to Bob Dylan playing down in Bayfront Park when between songs he pointed out to the crowd that he had been born here in the Zenith City in a hospital on the side of the hill.  This was the second time that Dylan had played Duluth, and the fact that he acknowledged this is the city of his birth was seen as icing on the cake because most of us were surprised he would ever come back here to play.  That is because the man born Robert Zimmerman has been running from northern Minnesota pretty much since the day he graduated from Hibbing High School.

The title of ""No Direction Home: Bob Dylan"" emphasizes that the singer-songwriter was a construct and attempts to chronicle the transformation from Robert Zimmerman to Bob Dylan.  The key influence has always been considered to be Woody Guthrie, and Dylan's visit to Guthrie in the hospital is an iconic Sixties vision quest, but this documentary is able to work in many more names into the mix.  The connections to the music at any time during the early stages of Dylan's career are only addressed tangentially, but that only underscores that this is not a music appreciation course on Bob Dylan, as much as that would be nice.  This is an attempt to preserve the extant record on the first quarter century of Dylan's life, with an emphasize on the five years at the end of that period that represent the most creative and significant portion of his career, aided and abetted by talking heads the likes of Joan Baez, Allen Ginsberg, Liam Clancy, and Al Kooper, who provide memories and retrospective insights (Kooper's story on how he ended up playing the organ on ""Like a Rolling Stone"" is a testament to serendipity in the music business).

Since Martin Scorsese was basically given 10 hours of film footage to shape into a four-hour documentary, the sense in which he served as ""director"" of ""No Direction Home"" would be in laying out the basic structure for film editor David Tedeschi.  Obviously the main thrust of the documentary is the chronology of Dylan's life, which mixes archival footage with contemporary interviews.  But this narrative plays out against Dylan's 1966 tour of Great Britain, already the focus of D.A. Pennebaker's documentary ""Don't Look Back,"" during which he offended a large segment of his fans by picking up an electric guitar.  Night after night Dylan would play an acoustic set to raves from his audience, and then return with a backing band for an electric set.  Time and time again you hear audience members scream ""Judas"" and other insults, while Dylan tells the bad to just play louder.  The main narrative and the subtext come together when Dylan shows up at the Newport Folk Festival supported by the Paul Butterfield Blues Band and shocks the world.  The U.K. tour kept the wound open and it was the motorcycle accident in the summer of 1966 that turned Dylan into a recluse that adds the exclamation point on the

One of the things that resulted from that decision was the song that ""Rolling Stone"" magazine picked as the top rock song of all-time, ""Like a Rolling Stone,"" which also happened to be the first single Dylan ever released (it went to #2 on the Billboard charts).  This was taken as clear evidence that Dylan was going ""commercial,"" yet even the fans who booed and shouted curses when Dylan came on stage with the Band (nee the Hawks), applauded that one song.  The problem was not that Dylan was becoming commercial (""Eve of Destruction"" was a #1 song and that did not hurt Barry McGuire's bona fides as a folk rebel), but that for the most part he appeared to be giving up being the voice of his generation.  In that regard the biggest slap in the face to those who worshipped him was not ""Like a Rolling Stone,"" with its powerful onslaught of pointed lyrics, but ""Mr. Tambourine Man,"" which we see him performing at a folk song workshop, because that is not a song that is going to send young people to the streets let alone to the barricades.

The interviews done with Dylan are actually the least important part of ""No Direction Home,"" because if there is anything we have learned from listening to Dylan over the past four decades it is to let the music speak for itself.  In all of the footage from the first half of the Sixties showing Dylan talking with reporters he repeatedly dodges their questions.  They want to know what the songs are about and he refuses to tell them.  It might seem like he is waiting for somebody smart enough to pose a question worth answering, but I have to believe he would never play that game.  This is a man who insisted he grew up in Gallup, New Mexico rather than admit to being from Hibbing, and his willingness to sit in front of a film camera and talk about his past does not automatically mean increased veracity.  I would like to believe that when Dylan talks about the musicians he listened to growing up that he is telling the truth, but I always wary.

What is potentially the most illuminating thing that Dylan says about himself in this four-hour documentary is his insistence that he was never a topical songwriter.  If you can wrap your mind about the truth in that obvious lie, which is possible if you keep in mind Dylan's contemporaries on the folk scene in the early Sixties and remember that sometimes words have two meanings, then you can arrive at a better understanding of the truth inherent in Dylan's music.  ""No Direction Home"" does not fully illuminate Bob Dylan, but that impossibility is hardly Scorsese's agenda.  Ultimately, Scorsese is making the case for why Dylan should end up getting a Noble Prize for Literature some day soon.  The only better way to make the case is to simply listen to the man's music.",1127520000,8,5740,4.6175024582104225
2349032,5,B000A0GP4K,"I must confess that in the 1960's, (and no more than 30 minutes from NYC living in Tenafly, NJ across the Hudson River), I missed Bob Dylan entirely! Right, not one album. I was raised wearing white blouses, kilt skirts, knee socks, circle pins and cheerleading my way to nowhere while steeped in classical music including madrigals, choir, and orchestra. But I purchased - No Direction Home - almost on a whim, or maybe it was a prayer, in a most serious effort to understand how I ended up in-the-age-they-call middle. To my utter astonishment, however, I found myself soaring-singing again above all the muck-n-mire within this sublime documentary of language (music itself) as part of Dylan's life, loves, hopes, dreams, genius, despair, and joy while distilling the very essence of that oh-so-mysterious light within ALL of us: but so gloriously embodied in one...named Bob Dylan (a man - a real man - representing all our colors). If this documentary-CD set had been 10 times the price, it would be worth still more. I assure you, whether you are new to Bob Dylan (as I idiotically am); or one who has been there all along, I would beg you (and I don't beg) to buy this sublime work of art. It could change our world somehow stuck, and seemingly spinning askew. God Bless you always, Bob!",1127520000,9,1294,4.730088495575221
2349033,4,B000A0GP4K,"Overall, this is a great film. A lot of footage never seen before. The biggest criticism of this documentary is the absence of Ramblin' Jack Elliott, who played a huge role in making Dylan who he was in the early days. Elliott was the original Woody Guthrie protege, and Dylan's early persona was probably more a copy of Elliott than Guthrie, who was already too sick to play. Maybe Elliott didn't want to participate in this film? Who knows? He's still alive, unlike Dave van Ronk, who's in it quite a bit. Nevertheless, his absence is a big hole.....",1127520000,5,552,4.585858585858586
2349034,4,B000A0GP4K,"Great archival footage... Revisionary Dylan myth themes

Ramblin' Jack Eliot - a major Dylan influence - is omitted.

The BEATLES 1964 takeover of the US music scene isn't mentioned once.  Dylan doesn't acknowlege that their emergence spurred his morphing from full-on folkie to folk rocker in 1965.

And someone else mentioned that they left out the part of Dylan's acceptance speech after JFK died - the part where Bob says he identified in a strange way with Oswald.  They cut that out of Bob's history - probably anyone would want to forget saying that.

THe recording of BLonde on Blonde isn't even mentioned - even thought that's the last album he would make before his cycle accident.

Otherwise - NDH has great old footage of Bob - especially the '66 footage, but also the full-length songs in the extras section of disc 2.

In some ways the documentary isn't long enough; the Dylan story covered in this doc. needs 6 hours to really do the job.  I appreciate the effort, though, but not the revisionary stuff on the part of the producers.",1127433600,10,1047,4.708791208791209

2349036,5,B000A0GP4K,"When you get to the end, you want to start all over again. That's the No. 1 reason to own the DVD version of Martin Scorsese's ""No Direction Home.""  Coming from a project so awash in audio and video treasures, it seems odd that the only meaningful extras are complete versions of Dylan numbers trimmed in the documentary. That said, there are some great performances in the extras -- for example, the 8-minute version of ""Like a Rolling Stone"" with the band that became the Band.

The DVD's Dolby Digital 5.1 audio achieves reference quality. Images are TV-friendly full screen, with pleasing grays and medium contrasts. The video texture is amazingly consistent given the Babylon of sources.

The film's subtitle should be something like ""Bob Dylan, 1960-65."" Dylan acts as his own witness throughout -- at ease, clear, sometimes funny and seemingly pleased to take control of his legend. ""I don't feel like I had a past,"" Dylan says, but the assembled evidence proves otherwise. Part 1 unspools much like a video companion to Dylan's vastly entertaining biography ""Chronicles, Volume One,"" which covers his years on the Greenwich Village folk scene, the epicenter of American hip in the early 1960s.

""No Direction Home"" becomes A Film By Martin Scorsese in its dark concluding act. Like ""Mean Streets"" and ""GoodFellas,"" it captures the paranoia and disintegration as the central character's life implodes. The artist faced a far-flung confederacy of dunces, Scorsese shows us, over and over: moronic reporters, abusive audiences, uncomprehending music lovers, petulant folkies, teenagers who shrieked, fawned and grabbed. No one seems to have any sense except for Dylan and his in-crowd.

Dylan's songs play non-stop in that gorgeous DD audio, but there is little discussion, surprisingly, of the groundbreaking music he produced in the mid-'60s -- no recognition of the vast Baby Boom audience that heard the genius in his explorations and embraced them. No one testifies to the deep and immediate influence of  ""Highway 61 Revisited"" on rock innovators up to and including John Lennon.

Still, it's easy and satisfying to buy into Scorsese's view of Dylan as underdog. The slant and subjectivity give ""No Direction Home"" much of its drama and depth, especially in the final hour. Bottom line: No one has made a better rock documentary.",1127260800,60,2340,5.125984251968504
2349037,2,B000A0GP4K,"Dylan plays the same old cat and mouse game during this movie.  He give out no new information and ignores most major things we all want to know about.  For example, we never hear a thing about his wife Sara or his extremely heavy drug use.

A lot of this movie is a fraud to make Dylan out to be some mythical hero.  For example, booing is inserted into many parts where no audio of it exist.  The famous ""Judas"" scream is made to look like it was screamed as soon as Dylan came out on stage witht the band when it really came before the last song of the show.  Also they talk about a controversial speech Dylan gave, but never mention the controversial part where he talks about how he could see himself in the man that killed John F. Kennedy.

Even with the people who put this movie together trying very hard to make Dylan come across as a Christ figure we see cracks in that shell.  We see Dylan being arrogant to fans and reporters while oozing with a very hateful hipper-than-thou attitude.  Through all this though the movie wants us to feel sorry for Dylan which is hard to do because his drug and party habits are what caused him to burn out.

Overall, besides the concert footage this movie is a drag.",1127260800,28,1212,4.276315789473684
