7943545,5,B00005KJYN,"Fantastic plot, brilliant comic timing and raw humour!
One of my favourite comedies.
Eric Cantona's presence is not distracting, rather adds to the feel of the movie and he played in it while he was still active professionally.
What can I say.. it is up there along with Diner Le Con and La Cage Aux Folles.",1236038400,,307,4.5
