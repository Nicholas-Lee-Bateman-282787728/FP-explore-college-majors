1995810,5,B0001FGC2E,These have been the biggest hits with our little one (17mo).  He loves the sounds and music and looks forward to the short stories which have great story value packed into a attentive time span.  The intro/out songs by Aaron Neville captures his attention right away. great collection!,1357257600,,285,4.916666666666667

1995812,5,B0001FGC2E,"I love the Little People DVD's,  and so does my 2 year old grandson.  They are definitely his favorite to watch.  If given the choice, he almost always asks for the ""people"" videos.  This one, like all the others I've purchased, is super cute and educational as well.",1333238400,,267,4.5
1995813,4,B0001FGC2E,Our son loves the little people videos and toys.  He knows their names better than mom and dad.  He is 2.5 yrs old and a couple of the chapters scare him (1 in the music/1 in the creativity) so we skip over those.  But overall he enjoys watching the DVD each night before going to bed.,1272931200,,285,4.053571428571429
1995814,5,B0001FGC2E,"We have a lot of the little people toys and the stories are a fun way to help them use their imagination and bring the toys to ""life"".  Little people stories are full of kindness and are age appropriate for the very beginners.",1232323200,,226,4.255813953488372
1995815,5,B0001FGC2E,"My toddler watches this over and over again.  He practically has in memorized.  He is learning words and manners from the Little People.  This may be annoying to adults, but the little tots love it!",1230595200,,198,4.6

1995818,5,B0001FGC2E,"I purchased this DVD before a long vacation, and it was an immediate hit with my almost two-year-old.  If you are considering buying any of the Little People movies, this collection would be the one I recommend most highly.  It seems to be a favorite for my daughter and myself.  Also she has taken several of the ideas in the movies and incorporated them into her imaginary play.  (For example, Sarah Lynn teaching Maggie to sing).",1207612800,,432,4.644736842105263
1995819,4,B0001FGC2E,"My son loved the Lil People DVD his toy came with, so I bought this one for variety.  He absolutely loves this DVD!  He giggles and dances to a couple of the songs.  My son has no interest in watching other cartoons (except Superwhy) so I was quite surprised when he was entertained by Lil People.  We have Creativity Collection and the Friendship Collection and they're both colorful and cute for little kids.",1203465600,,410,4.575342465753424
1995820,5,B0001FGC2E,My 15mos old daughter loves this dvd! She even asks for it by name. The music can get annoying and will inhabit your dreams but a great purchase bc it keeps her occupied.,1199145600,,170,4.181818181818182
1995821,5,B0001FGC2E,"My 2 1/2 year old loves all of the Little People videos!  None of the other videos we have hold his attention for longer than 5 minutes, except for the Little People ones!",1199059200,,171,4.181818181818182
1995822,5,B0001FGC2E,"My son won't sit still for very many cartoons let alone a movie, but he loves the Little People stories.  We have enjoyed this DVD. I would enjoy all of their DVDs. Each story if about 3-5 minutes so the kiddos don't get bored. There were 10 stories.",1193788800,,250,4.208333333333333
1995823,4,B0001FGC2E,"Got a couple of these videos for my son as he enjoys the little people toys. He loves the videos and still watches them a couple years later. Good lessons in the stories, but the songs and voices can get annoying...also the theme song that plays before every scene/story.",1189209600,,271,4.551020408163265
1995824,5,B0001FGC2E,"My son loves the Little People DVDs (all except the newest three, which are oddly different). This one is the best of the bunch. It's a great introduction to music, singing and art.",1176854400,,181,4.515151515151516
1995825,5,B0001FGC2E,Little People are a favorite of both parents and children. I love these.,1171152000,,72,4.615384615384615
1995826,5,B0001FGC2E,"every house should have it

its the best ever for children not just to learn but also to behave!

we all like it me, my children and who ever saw it from my family and friends.

Lots of thanks that never end to all who work on this dvd and brout it for us,thy are creative and unbelivable!",1164585600,,289,3.9482758620689653
1995827,3,B0001FGC2E,"As others have posted here on the content and themes of the Little People video, I won't repeat what they have said. My 3yo loves them, and my 8 month old looks at the telly when they are on.

 I was disappointed they really did nothing more than place 2 episodes from the vhs onto a disk. Neither episode auto-starts when the disk is placed into a player. There is no option to play all of the adventures on the disk with one select. You can play the 5 from one episode, then have to go back to the main menu, and select the other episode to play the 5 adventures there. A minor gripe I know, but one that even the most basic dvd authoring software would have let them fix prior to production.",1150502400,,694,4.133333333333334
1995828,5,B0001FGC2E,"I bought another ""Little People"" video cassette tape at a garage sale for my 2 year old grandaughter. She LOVED it! Up until that time, she was not interested in anything on TV. For her birthday, I then bought her two more ""Little People"" DVD's. Her parents say that I ""created a monster."" She goes around the house whining saying, ""People, People."" She wants in on ALL the time. I have watched it with her, and find it charming and educational. My grandaughter is learning the names of the characters, as well as the song. She goes around the house singing the song all day long also. I think all the ""Little People"" ""stuff"" is driving my son and his wife crazy, but their daughter absolutely LOVES it!",1141084800,,703,4.5
1995829,5,B0001FGC2E,We love little people and the little people DVDs are no exception.  The stories are only 5 minutes each which is perfect for any attention span.  Both my 4 year old and 20 month old will sit together and watch.  They will also pull out their little people playsets and try to act out what they see.  I even enjoy watching.  The claymation is great and I love seeing the girls being creative and entertained.  I know that I can go into the kitchen and begin dinner and not worry about what they are watching.  This is a perfect addition to the playsets you own!!,1140220800,,561,4.285714285714286
1995830,5,B0001FGC2E,"My daughter received her first Little People set as a gift for Christmas, she was just 6 months old and the box said 1 year +, so I put the set away for later. I kept the video that came with the box though and dropped it in for her and I to watch. She LOVED IT! Ever since that day, she has been hooked on the Little People videos! Even as a 6 1/2 Month old, she became excited when she saw the red Little People logo and heard Aaron Neville singing. :)

 Excellent video, the teachings are so nice - most videos, I sit there and cringe, thinking to myself, 'Yeah, uh.. I don't want my child acting like that!' But this one has wonderful teachings, great animation - the colors, music and voices grab little one's attention and my daughter will sit and watch it quietly the whole way through! Even my husband (Sales & Marketing) and I (Art Teacher) love viewing the movies with her and it's been 7 months of daily use.  These are the only characters my daughter is willing to watch - she has no time for Blues Clues, Dora the Explorer or any of the other currently popular baby type videos.

 Buy this! You won't be sorry!",1090713600,,1123,4.2046511627906975
1995831,5,B0001FGC2E,"This DVD originally came out as two separate VHS tapes and it was a terrific idea to combine them for a value-packed One hour DVD  release.
The Little People are a lovable claymation characters and in the Discovering Music portion, Michael, Sonya-Lee, Maggie, Sara-Lynn and Eddie introduce creative ways to listen, sing, and play music in their episodic adventures.  Like in most Little People releases, one or two catchy songs are sung.  And get this, Aaron Neville beautiful voice introduces each adventure with a Little People theme song verse!
A MUST HAVE in your Little person's DVD library, I'm happy with the fact that claymation is still alive and well...and although each of the 10 adventures runs no more than 5 or 6 minutes, they tend to be well-written and linked to one another.",1081296000,,791,4.888059701492537
