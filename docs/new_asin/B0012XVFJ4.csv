8248155,5,B0012XVFJ4,"""Little Dove""  is such a lovely film that it takes my breath away.  The setting is in West Texas where you would expect to see Native Americans carrying on their daily life long before strangers arrived to change the world for them.  The charaters are so believable I was pulled into their story of love and loss.  This is a must experience short film!",1202515200,,352,4.453125
8248156,5,B0012XVFJ4,"I got this DVD as a present and quite frankly was blown away by the style and epic feel of this wonderful film. It's the best short film I've seen in a long, long time.

The DVD contains lots of extras and background info about the story, location and film shoot. Trust me....after seeing the film you'll be wanting more and the DVD does just that with all these extras.

While the film is a classic tale of star crossed lovers, it is told in a fresh manner that was surprising. It was filmed in an isolated and amazing location that gives the film a huge and epic feel. All the actors were great. Their acting skills along with the location deliver this wonderfully told story with few words. I found myself feeling as though I had been thrust back to the time when Native Americans were the only humans in the Great Southwest.

The soundtrack was also very good and I hope the makers of this film will create a CD of the music from this film. I don't think anyone will be disappointed in this DVD. It tells a clasic tale of lovers and gives us a peek at the wonderful Native American culture that has been lost to time.",1202428800,,1121,4.278301886792453
8248157,5,B0012XVFJ4,"By two bootstrap film makers, this short film tells the timeless story of star-crossed lovers. Told with authentic dialogue, perfectly cast actors and the backdrop of gorgeous scenery, it as a tender and emotional piece.

The DVD includes pictures from the beautiful location and a behind-the-scenes video.",1201651200,,306,5.51063829787234
