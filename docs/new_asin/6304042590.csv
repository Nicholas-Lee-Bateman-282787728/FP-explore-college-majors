7861733,5,6304042590,"Paramount Pictures presents ""PIRATES ON HORSEBACK"" (23 May 1941) (69 mins/B&W) (Fully Restored/Dolby Digitally Remastered) --- One of the most outstanding series of westerns began in 1935 from Paramount Pictures ""Hopalong Cassidy"", under the guiding hand of producer Harry ""Pop"" Sherman --- continued well into the '40s proved to be the most successful 'B' Westerns ever made --- based on Clarence E. Mulford's stories, they strived in changing Cassidy's image, which was both original and influential --- the hero, played by William Lawrence Boyd, was mature and a man of his word --- the plots were solid with a sudden burst of climactic action in the last reel, usually a frantic chase backed by tension building music.

Hoppy's interaction with California Carlson (Andy Clyde) is always a shot in the arm with his down-to-earth humor and sentimentality, theses scenes are pure Americana! Boyd, with his silver hair, black clothes and white horse (Topper) rode into our lives and we've never been the same since --- your children and grandchildren will enjoy this clean wholesome entertainment --- Hoppy always wore two silver white handle six shooters, never drank or smoked, when the good guys always won and the moral to the story was fair-play -- outstanding role model.

Another pick for ""Pop"" Sherman was a new sidekick for the Cassidy films --- a newcomer Lucky Jenkins, played by Russell Hayden had his job cut out for him, with Boyd (as the hero) and Andy Clyde (California Carlson) for comedy, left the field of romance and action wide open, Hayden filled those ""boots"" perfectly.

Hats off and thanks to Les Adams (collector/guideslines for character identification), Chuck Anderson (Webmaster: The Old Corral/B-Westerns. Com), Boyd Magers (Western Clippings), Bobby J. Copeland (author of ""Trail Talk""), Rhonda Lemons (Empire Publishing Inc) and Bob Nareau (author of ""The Real Bob Steele"") as they have rekindled my interest once again for B-Westerns and Serials --- If you're into the memories of B-Westerns with high drama, this is the one you've been anxiously waiting for --- please stand up and take a bow --- all my heroes have been cowboys!

7861734,4,6304042590,"Producer Harry ""Pop"" Sherman, originator of the Hopalong Cassidy film series that stars William Boyd, is responsible for this well-devised work, released through Paramount, that recounts of gold miner Ben Pendleton, viciously gunned down by henchmen of gambler Ace Gibson (Morris Ankrum) during an unsuccessful endeavour to force Ben into revealing the location of his newly found rich strike.  Since Cassidy's friend California Carlson (Andy Clyde) is a distant cousin of Pendleton, he, Hoppy, and their sidekick Lucky Jenkins (Russell Hayden) attempt to locate the concealed lode while simultaneously seeking Ben's killers, but when the trio comes to the cabin of the deceased, they find it occupied by his niece Trudy (Eleanor Stewart).  When the evil Ace succours the young woman, in the process turning her head against Hoppy and his friends while planning to defraud her of her legacy, Hopalong and his pals face tough sledding and many anxious, danger fraught moments.  Shot in the rugged high country of eastern California's Inyo County, the brief (69 minute) film is replete with finely wrought detail and naturalistic dialogue, trademarks of director Lesley Selander who had benefited from his close friendship with Buck Jones, gradually developing into a top drawer helmsman of low-budget Westerns.  Additionally apparent is the hand of assistant director Glenn Cook, one of the best at deployment of extras. The work showcases humour as often as it does action and melodrama, all smoothly blended by Selander, while crisp editing and effective sound mixing, especially of the scoring, are noteworthy, and skillful cinematographer Russell Harlan is consistently inventive.  All of the featured players perform capably, the beautiful Stewart a nifty rider to boot, with brief but effective turns from Dick Simmons, as a cheated gambler, and lanky Wen Wright as a Gibson lackey; acting laurels go to Dennis Moore, cast as Gibson's principal henchman, who eventually joined cinema's Forces of Good as a Range Buster but still frequently fulfiled roles as a member of the Forces of Evil.",1121904000,,2094,5.35258358662614
