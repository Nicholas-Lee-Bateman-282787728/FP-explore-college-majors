8397497,4,B003IMERR4,"I saw this originally on CMT, and it mad me a Little Bigtown fan.
They do a couple of Mac songs on their tours, and put some great energy
in their singing.
Lindsey is just an incredible singer, song writer and guitarist and the
combination of him with LBT is awesome",1322179200,2,266,4.235294117647059
8397498,1,B003IMERR4,"I watched the original performance on CMT and recorded it on my DVR in 1080i High Definition. When that recording was accidentally erased, I looked for a long time to find a comparable version. I love Little Big Town, and was excited to find this disk -- until I received it and put it in my BluRay player.

The quality of the video is terrible. Very pixelated and blurry. I have seen better quality video on YouTube.  The sound is muffled too. It's not worth my time and trouble to return it, so I'll just take my lumps and chalk it up to experience. I would strongly advise against buying this.

If anyone knows where a high-def version (with 5:1 surround sound if possible) of this performance can be found, I'd be grateful if you shared it.  Heck, even a good quality standard DVD would do. Anything would be better than this one.",1277596800,11,834,4.431372549019608
8397499,1,B003IMERR4,"I saw the original program on Crossroads, and it was excellent! This is evidently a pirated cheap copy, and the quality is dismal. That is a shame, since I love Little Big Town.",1276473600,10,177,4.393939393939394
8397500,5,B003IMERR4,"We saw this performance when it originally aired and were blown away by it.  So glad it is finally available on DVD....you really should put this in your collection.  If you are a fan of great harmony, this is the DVD to own.",1276387200,3,225,4.209302325581396
