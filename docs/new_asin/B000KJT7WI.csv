Somehow I had missed the 2006 release KID CREOLE AND THE COCONUTS ""LIVE IN PARIS"" an expanded DVD upgrade released by Warner Music Vision of the old&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Embassy-Home-Entertainment-THE-LEISURE-TOUR-VHS/dp/6300145697/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Embassy Home Entertainment ""THE LEISURE TOUR"" VHS</a>&nbsp;with five additional tracks adding 26 minutes to the original 60 minute run time. The track order is the same as the VHS release, with the additional songs smack in the midddle. The only unfortunate setback is that you need a multi-region player to view, it is only a Region 2,3,4 & 5 NTSC DVD.  Beside the original Dolby Surround there is also now a dts 5.1 track.  The band is playing in a much larger venue than the recent&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/LIVE-AT-ROCKPALAST/dp/B0089M0DGM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""LIVE AT ROCKPALAST""</a>&nbsp;release (Le Zenith, Paris, France) which makes the sound more cavernous.  The remastered picture is as good as you can expect from a 26 year old videotape, but is from a spotless source, a marked improvement over the VHS release. The only extras are a short Biography and Discography, and French and English subtitles (the English don't work!).  There is also a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/version-released-in-2000/dp/B00004ZESV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">version released in 2000</a>&nbsp;that seems to get poor reviews for sound and picture quality.  The band is obviously having a good time, and give a fun, spirited, energetic performance, putting on a colorful show indeed!  Filmed almost two and a half years after the ROCKPALAST dates, the group's set and costumes are more like a Broadway show, which was August Darnell's vision in the beginning, with solo spots for band members and individual Coconuts throughout.  The road tested musical arrangements are also tighter and more complex, with a noticable rap and hip-hop influence as well.  They perform: ""Don't Take My Coconuts,"" ""My Male Curiosity,"" ""Table Manners,"" ""Mr. Softee,"" ""Annie, I'm Not Your Daddy,"" ""I'm A Wonderful Thing,"" ""No Fish Today,"" ""Dear Addy,"" ""Stool Pigeon,"" ""Say Hey,"" ""Laughing With Our Backs Against The Wall,"" ""Mona,"" ""Lifeboat Party,"" ""Endicott,"" ""Indiscreet"" and ""Caroline Was A Dropout,"" an all-out finale.  A must for the fan and will make converts out of the newly initiated......
