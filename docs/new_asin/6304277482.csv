7868670,5,6304277482,"In 1991 The Chicago Bulls Dynasty began and it comes to close here. This video chronicles the final hurrah's for Jordan, Pip and Jackson. At the start of the season Jackson told his team this would be the 'last dance'. The beginning of the season things didn't go so well with teams gunning to take down the Bulls and Scottie's injury caused the Bulls to go on a losing streak. It was frustrating and caused Jordan to tell his teammates he should have never came back for this season. The Bulls would rebound. In the playoffs the Bulls would find themselves in a dogfight with Reggie Miller lead Pacers coached by Larry Legend Bird. Only the New York Knicks gave the Bulls a tougher fight. They would go up against the Utah Jazz for the second straight year in the NBA Finals. It was a classic series and a fitting end to the Bulls Dynasty. I recommend this video to Bulls fans, Jordan fans and fans of the NBA.",1368057600,,911,4.396449704142012
7868671,5,6304277482,"This was one of my favorite WrestleMania's. It keeps up the excitement throughout the whole event. The matches are wonderfully chosen with great superstars battling each other out.

WWF Championship Match: Sycho Sid vs The Undertaker

The Undertaker defeats Sycho Sid in a heavy brawl and wins the WWF Championship. This was a really good match with an all out fight between two powerhouses.

Submission Match: Bret ""The Hitman"" Hart vs Stone Cold Steve Austin

This was the best match of the Pay Per View. I was very happy that Hitman won the match. Bret Hart won the match fair and square in the middle of the ring proving that he is far better than Stone Cold. Stone Cold is good but he is nowhere near as good as Hitman as he is hyped up to be. Bret Hart completely dominates, decimates and destroys Steve Austin in this match and leaves him bloody in the ring.

Chicago Street Fight: [Ahmed Johnson, Animal and Hawk(LoD)] vs [The Nation of Domination]

This match was also one of the most exciting matches that have ever taken place in WWF. The war between these two factions is pure hardcore with no rules and takes place all over the ring and outside with all sorts of weapons used.

Tag Team Title Match: [Owen Hart and British Bull Dog] vs [Vader and Mankind]

The best tag title match I have ever seen. British Bull Dog singlehandedly beats the living daylights out of Vader and Mankind while Owen Hart provides some support here and there. In the end however, Mankind pulls out his cheap Mandible Claw and disqualifies himself and his team mate Vader.

Intercontinental Title Match: Rocky Maivia vs The Sultan

An average quality match, Rock's first WrestleMania.

Four-Team Elimination Match: [Furnas and Lafon] vs [Headbangers] vs [Godwinns] vs [New Blackjacks]

A pretty cheap match as two of the teams were either counted out or disqualified turning this into a 2 on 2 type regular match. WWF hyped it up to be four-way elimination. It was nothing of this sort.

Regular Match 1: Goldust vs Hunter Hearst Helmsley

This was actually a decent match with both wrestlers performing good moves and fighting bitterly till the very end.",1125273600,,2145,4.7466307277628035
7868672,5,6304277482,"This video depicts the Chicago Bulls' 6th (and for now, last) world championship.  The Bulls won their customary 60+ games this season, but they nearly missed the Finals due to a gutsy performance by the Indiana Pacers in the conference finals.  The Pacers did something that many thought was next to impossible; take the Bulls to a deciding 7th game.  Game 7 was played at the United Center, and Indiana nearly pulled off one of the greatest upsets in NBA history, but the Bulls managed to win the game at the end.
Once again, the Bulls moved on to the NBA Finals, where they met the Utah Jazz in a rematch of the previous year's finals.  However, it was the Jazz who held home-court advantage this time.  It was a back-and forth series much of the way, but the Bulls managed to take a 3 games to 2 lead with game 6 being played on Utah's home court at the Delta Center.  Utah was leading as the game drew to a close, but the impeccable Michael Jordan hit what will probably be remembered as his greatest shot to win the game for Chicago.  Who can forget Michael's wrist held in the shooting position for several seconds after the ball left his hand to fall through the net and destroy the Jazz' hopes of a championship?
After the game, Michael and Scottie hugged and shed a few tears, because they realized that this was probably going to be their last game together, and sure enough, Jerry Krause and Jerry Reinsdorf managed to dismantle one of the greatest sports dynasties ever during the off-season.  Michael retired, coach Phil Jackson's contract wasn't renewed, and Scottie was traded (or virtually given) to the Houston Rockets.  This led the team into a miserable downward spiral from which it still hasn't recovered.
This video is a must for Bulls fans.  It offers a last glimpse of ""The Team of th 90's"".  Watch it and remember how good the Bulls were and, unfortunately, how bad they are now.",1081900800,,1905,4.557184750733138
7868673,5,6304277482,"Austin and Hart in one of the greatest matches of all time, very nice.  Taker and Sid, I could have done without.  The Rock (babyface vs Rikishi (The Sultan) was terrible.

7868674,5,6304277482,"""He's God...disguised as Michael Jordan!""--Larry Bird, after watching Jordan score 63 points against the Celtics in a double overtime playoff loss in the Boston Garden in 1986.
  When you talk about the best basketball team ever, the playoffs narrow down fast!  If you start with the earliest great teams, like Bill Russell's 1950s and 1960s Boston Celtics, yes, they were better than Wilt Chamberlain's Philadelphia 76ers or Wilt's Lakers, and they were better than the two time 1970s champions New York Knicks.  And yes, Russell's Celtics would have beaten the Celtics coached by Tommy Heinsohn, and the Portland Trailblazers with Bill Walton, and even the four time 1970s finalists Washington Bullets, and Rick Barry's 1975 championship team Golden State Warriors, and the Seattle Supersonics championship team that won the last title of the 1970s.  So before 1980, yes, Bill Russell's Boston Celtics were the best team ever.  But in 1980, that's when Magic Johnson won his first championship with the Los Angeles Lakers, and then his rival Larry Bird followed with his first championship in Boston in 1981.  By the time the 1980s were over, the score was 5 championships for Magic, 3 for larry, and a strong case for Magic Johnson's Lakers as the best team ever, since even though Bill Russell had more titles--11--no one has been able to answer how ULTIMATE DEFENSIVE PLAYER BILL RUSSELL would have been able to guard Lakers center Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, forward James Worthy, and ULTIMATE POINT GUARD MAGIC JOHSNON!!!
  And then came Michael Jordan!  As Magic Johnson himself once said, ""Larry and I were the best on the ground, but Michael took the game into the air!""  And if MJ's first act wasn't enough--3 straight championships from 1991 before his first retirement in 1993--his second threepeat--great word, Pat Riley!!!--was even better, thanks to the play of BEST DEFENSIVE PLAYER IN BASKETBALL SCOTTIE PIPPEN, and the presence of the MOST UNDERRATED SUPERSTAR IN THE HISTORY OF BASKETBALL, DENNIS RODMAN!!!  During his Chicago Bulls years from 1996 to 1998, not only was Rodman the best power forward in basketball, but he could also guard centers.  Not only was Rodman the greatest rebounder in basketball, but he was also an excellent passer.  Not only was Rodman the best power forward, not only could Rodman guard centers and rebound, but Rodman was a disruptive force in every single game that made winning the championship impossible without him.  People have forgotten how when Jordan returned to action for a 17 game stint at the end of the 1994-95 season he ended up humiliated at the end of the season by a tough Orlando Magic team that easily defeated the Bulls in six second round playoff games, and that's what forced management to call for Rodman!
  And with Jordan, Pippen, and Rodman together, no team in basketball could beat the Bulls!  No team in history could have beaten the Bulls!  Not Bill Russell's Celtics, not Magic Johnson's Lakers, not Larry Bird's Celtics, and not Phil Jackson's Lakers!  THE JORDAN-PIPPEN-RODMAN BULLS WERE THE BEST TEAM EVER!!!
