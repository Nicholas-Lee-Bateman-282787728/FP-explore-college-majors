5020147,5,B006US3UNK,Saw this movie when it previewed at the Louisville International Film Festival - - it's an awesome movie and so glad it's now coming on in DVD.  The scenery is beautiful.

5020149,5,B006US3UNK,"I have watched it more than once and enjoy it each time. It's a darn shame that those Hollywood jerks couldn't make it readable to the deaf and hard of hearing. That way it would be understandable to every one. I'm seeing that a lot lately, especially in the filthy Hollywood fixation on the ""f"" word that is missing (good ridden's) from this great movie and in the good ole movies. This was great - no filthy words; no nudity, wow hard to believe in this filthy minded nation. Ron S",1438128000,,483,4.318681318681318

5020157,5,B006US3UNK,"Wonderful film! Believeable lines delivered in a sincere fashion backed my emotion that seems to flow naturally from the characters. Not a poor performance in the entire film and Tom Skerritt's performance although brief was suberb! Surely worthy of his efforts and I don't think comments made by others as to his presence in the film being an attempt to cash in on Skerritt's reputation are worth any serious consideration. Overall a well written, suberbly filmed, movie with the added bonus of relatively unknown actors proving once again that Hollywood's supposed lock on talent is a myth! Can't wait for Jay Picket's next film",1408147200,,630,5.0673076923076925

It has everything a person who loves human dramas could want.

This movie has a big heart.
As one of the reviews said ~ she's seen it many times ~ I too  am like her  in that ~ this is a movie I can watch over & over....even just having it playing in the background brings up good warm feeling to my heart & soul.
A guy starts his life again after giving his life ~ so to speak! & going to jail to keep a woman with kids from going to jail.
If you do not love this movie ~ I do not know WHAT.
Enjoy from a girl who has survived the worst of life thru watching movies & listening to music ~

5020160,5,B006US3UNK,"Yes, Soda Springs is a story of redemption, but I found it to be more about honor and about loyalty.

The first thing that caught and held me was the authenticity of the locales.  The seemingly untouched details of the town and the awesome sweep of the desert pulled me into the scenes.  Next was the authenticity of the characters.  Close-ups of the face of Edens mother, Beth, might almost have been of my own motherfree of makeup but richly expressive.  (I was surprised to see that she was Patty McCormack.)

The mythological Quijano silently invites us to enter the story and see inside it.

All of the elements of film-making come together to make this picture deserve  more attention than it has gotten, in my opinion.

I do not find it cheesy, as a couple of reviewers here do.  Rather, I agree with Amazon Customer  that in spite of the low-key tone, it's well-paced.  In less capable hands, Soda Springs could have traded drama for melodrama. It never does. . .",1405987200,,971,4.5813953488372094
5020161,5,B006US3UNK,I did see part of this DVD and decided to order it for my library.  It is a very good story and know we'll enjoy it very much.,1405296000,,126,3.5
5020162,5,B006US3UNK,"I have watched this movie over and over again.  This story has touched me deeply on so many levels.  It's spirituality, honesty, truth and love is simple and clear.  The acting is exceptional and believeable.  There are not many movies that have moved me enough to want to watch it more than once. That is the main reason I have given this movie 5 stars.  Lu B",1394236800,,360,4.313432835820896
5020163,5,B006US3UNK,"This movie is one of the best I've seen in a long, long time.  My husband loved it, and made me play it over and over again before he died.  It is a man's movie, but it has romance and mystery for women to enjoy.
It's about a man who has been in prison for 10 years over a crime that he is unable to forgive himself for.  The town is more than happy to oblige him on that feeling, as well.  How he digs himself out of his own depression and makes a way to go on with his life, is the driving plot of the movie. By the way, Jay Pickett looks a lot like a younger, better looking Tommy Lee Jones.  He is a very, very good actor!",1392595200,,626,3.7480916030534353

good story plot and excellent acting.
it will keep you interested clear through the ending.",1389225600,,158,4.888888888888889
5020166,4,B006US3UNK,"If you like character-driven movies with a strong mood, this is a movie for you. Like many modern films, some situations in the story-line are not explained. You have to figure them out from clues in the movie. A second viewing of the movie can help pull the threads together. At least it did for me.

 I was drawn into the movie from the opening scene. I stayed engaged throughout. The acting was first rate, the production quality was excellent, and the mood perfectly fit the story. There was an early-on coincidence with a character with two horses that stretched the imagination, but I tend to question story elements that seem a bit implausible. All in all, I found this an enjoyable, heart-warming movie with unexpected plot developments that kept me engaged from beginning to end. There were a few details that I wanted more clearly explained, but those did not take away from the overall impact of the story.

Good acting about realistic people in a believable plot with sympathetic characters.",1383264000,,1003,4.819767441860465
5020167,4,B006US3UNK,"This is a nice story.  A bit simple and predictable, but very enjoyable. Beautiful scenery.  Something you can watch as a family , which is hard to find.  I would recommend this movie.",1380499200,,184,4.515151515151516
5020168,5,B006US3UNK,Story line was easy to watch and loved seeing it again. My mom had me order this after seeing it with me.,1370995200,,105,3.8181818181818183
5020169,4,B006US3UNK,"This film, cowritten by the star, Jay Pickett, tells a story of a man seeking to heal his tragic past.  For the most part, it engrosses the viewer and offers realistic situations, good acting, and great countryside.

Jay Pickett released from 8 years of imprisonment returns home to a town that doesn't want him, an ex-wife with unexpected news, an ex-lover, and his widowed mother who's just getting along.  He has his girl problems, and it is his fault.

A changed man, he struggles to do what's right, but there are no easy answers, and he stews in his quilt and loss of self-worth.

All the actors do a fine job.  Tom Skerritt has more of a cameo, but it's an important one.  The story teeters dangerously close to melodrama, but doesn't quite reach it.  The moral of the story of love, integrity, and making amends is quite good and meaningful.  Dealing with the consequences of one's actions makes for a relatable condition that we all have had to face to some degree in our lives.

Overall, a good flick, but not kid friendly: very adult themes with alcohol, adultery, death, some language, and implied sexual situations.",1359331200,,1128,4.680203045685279
5020170,5,B006US3UNK,"This a movie that eveyone needs to see! It just goes to show that we all make mistakes and that we as people are not perfect! We are learn from the mistakes that we have made and that is what makes us a better person. Sometimes we take the fall for someone and we have to pay for that, Eden shows this is this film! There were a few times tears came to my eyes because I  can relate to this movie. All I can say is this is one great movie. Eden shows that he has changed his way and is trying to do better and there are a few that just don't want him to be there. He has to start all over with his a new love, old friends and the tradgy that has happend! I so Love this move! Carrie from Chattanooga, TN!",1358035200,2,704,3.7891156462585034

5020172,4,B006US3UNK,This movie is very good but kind of slow. I feel for Eden as he is not treated the way he should have. He payed for a crime he may have not of caused. It ends very well. I hope you enjoy it,1355788800,,189,3.4186046511627906
5020173,5,B006US3UNK,Great comeback story. A nice clean view of character on the part of Eden. Enjoy3ed enought to purchase for family watching. Victoria Pratt is an example of studios ability to chose actors well (she did a superb job of developing her character). Teaches a lesson for all to build character on.,1349827200,3,292,4.745098039215686
5020174,4,B006US3UNK,"Since my husband hails from Soda Springs, Idaho, I bought this movie for him!
He actually saw landmarks from Soda (as the locals call it) and the surrounding towns
where this was filmed on location.  So he was pleased with that reality.

We both thought the story was heartfelt.  The performances very good!  Great
characters!  It was ""real"".... down-to-earth... nothing lofty...  with a story-line of
HOPE and sweet redemption.

We felt a part of the story.  Involved.  Nice touch.

We give ""Soda Springs"" a big thumbs up!",1347408000,2,523,4.908045977011494
5020175,5,B006US3UNK,"This movie is a treasure. It begins in one place and ultimately takes you to a completely different spot. The story slowly unleashed deep emotions which continuously sounded the depths of my soul.
Only a zombie could leave this movie emotionally unaffected.",1347148800,5,257,5.142857142857143
5020176,5,B006US3UNK,Awesome movie. It is nice to have a real story line with some twists! Kept my attention. Pickett was great.,1340496000,2,107,4.4
5020177,4,B006US3UNK,"The film is slow moving. Eden Jackson (Jay Pickett) has spent 8 years in prison for vehicular homicide. He is surprised at his release as is everyone else. Apparently in Oregon they release prisoners at random. He returns home to a mother (Patty McCormack) that still loves him, but a community that has some people who wish Eden would rot in prison.

Eden (symbolic for new beginning) keeps his prison Bible, but this is not really a ""faith based"" film. He has memories of that fateful night, playing at the local honky-tonk and cheating on his wife Pam (Miranda Frigon). Pam gets even by not visiting Eden in prison and marrying Larry (Michael Bowen) the town's biggest A-Hole.

Larry controls the sheriff (Duane Stephens) and doesn't like Eden hanging around, partly because he uses annoying phrases such as ""it is what it is."" Shelly (Victoria Pratt) the pretty blond who owns the feed store, needs some help. It normally isn't hard to figure out where this drama is headed as Jay Pickett subs for Patrick Swayze. I was pleasantly surprised by the twists the film takes in this unlikely drama about redemption.

4 stars for fans of ""Lifetime"" style films.

No f-bombs, but some adult language (S-word, P-word, AH-word, SOB), implied sex, no nudity (girl in bra-Whitnie Mauney) Brief appearances by Tom Skerritt as the dad.",1338681600,7,1326,4.853982300884955
5020178,5,B006US3UNK,"This movie was a gem. I watched it based strictly on a recommendation of a friend, so I had no idea what to expect. The longer I watched, the more engaged I became. By the end of the movie, I was fully connected with the characters, the story had some great twists, and the pace of the movie was wonderful. In today's rush to provide complete sensory overload, it was nice to sit and watch a calm but powerful story that evolved at a relaxing pace.",1336780800,4,448,4.22093023255814
5020179,5,B006US3UNK,"Idaho natives, actor Jay Pickett and music Steve Fulton, do an absolutely amazing job with a familiar story told a different way.  Talking about family relationships, redemption, and other values could have gone the other way, but this film brings everything together in a fresh new way of looking at things.  This film has truly earned everyone of the awards it's gotten!  Having gone to school with Jay and Steve, all I can say is WOW!  Good job everyone, and thanks for bringing back memories of growing up in S. Idaho.  The familiar scenery, the old state pen, everything portrays Idaho and the way we grew up wonderfully.",1334707200,11,626,4.7592592592592595
5020180,5,B006US3UNK,"""Soda Springs"" is a Western/Drama about a man looking for redemption and just wanting the chance to proof he can belong again. Right from the start of the film I knew I was in for something special, Eden was a character I immediately attached myself to and no matter what happened in the past I wanted the best for him going forward so I was engaged and set to see it through. Eden isn't the only character in the film that you take notice of right away, every character is well-written and realistic and when you combine that with a terrific story, beautiful landscapes and amazing music you got your self a gem and ""Soda Springs"" is just that, it's a dramatic triumph. The film tears at your emotions, from happy to sad the film draws you in and never lets up.

There's a lot going on in Eden's life after he returns but to talk too much about the details would only ruin the film for those waiting to see it. This is one of those stories that reminds us why we fell in love with cinema in the first place, sadly you don't get to see many films like ""Soda Springs"" anymore so when one does show up it's not only a surprise but a joy as well.

The entire cast did a terrific job, Jay Pickett is incredible was Eden and Tom Skerritt gives a powerful performance as his father in a limited role. I can go right through the cast but instead I will just say everyone is fantastic in their roles. If you like a good drama then I highly recommend picking up one of the best films I have seen so far this year, I am confident it will find a huge audience on DVD with strong word of mouth.

Do yourself a favor and make sure you pick this up, you are going to be glad you did. Let me finish by saying Director, Michael Feifer has a talent for telling a good story, my hat goes off to him and I look forward to seeing what he has coming out next.",1334361600,7,1838,4.114206128133705
5020181,5,B006US3UNK,"What a wonderful film. Shows Idaho at it's best. This is a film with a moral!
There is something here for everyone who is not addicted to movie violence.
Beautiful scenery, great actors and characters.
Great family film.",1334188800,3,220,4.815789473684211
5020182,4,B006US3UNK,"Soda Springs (2012) was co-produced, co-written and stars Idaho native Jay Pickett, whose handsome performance as prodigal son Eden centers the film. Soda Springs is solidly directed by Michael Feifer and sports Jeffrey D. Smith's accomplished cinematography of Idaho's beloved sagebrush desert country. There isn't a single dishonest note in any of the film's performances, including a heartbreaking appearance by veteran actor Tom Skerritt as Eden's father. A classic narrative about fathers and sons, mentors, and guiding spirits, Soda Springs speaks to classic--nearly mythic--themes of sacrifice and redemption.",1333929600,8,616,6.011363636363637
5020183,5,B006US3UNK,Soda Springs is a great story most of the family can watch and enjoy. Probably should be rated PG or PG13. Is my 8 year-old daughter's favorite movie. Sure to tug at the heart strings. First rate acting and music. A wonderful story about redemption and the importance of family. Highly recommended.,1333670400,,298,4.75
5020184,4,B006US3UNK,"This is a fine, quiet little film with low-key believable acting and gorgeous cinematography. In less capable hands, ""Soda Springs"" could have traded drama for melodrama. It never does and in spite of the low-key tone, it's well-paced.  True, story itself isn't a new one, but its plusses - including some interesting twists - held our interest. Especially good are Jay Pickett, Tom Skerritt, Henry Darrow, Victoria Pratt, Patty McCormack and young Lan Larison.",1333411200,13,461,5.22972972972973
5020185,5,B006US3UNK,"Soda Springs is an uplifting story about second chances and redemption.  It is a well acted and beautifly shot film with a couple of good plot twists.  Many of the characters in the film are easy to identify with which brings it home in several scenes. It starts slowly and builds nicely.  This film won best feature film at the Louisville International Festival of film last fall and just won the audience award at the Sun Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.  That says a lot.  Here is a recent professional review link [...] The film isn't rated, but, I would guess it's probably PG for those wondering. This is a great little indie film worth seeing.",1333238400,9,655,4.516949152542373
5020186,2,B006US3UNK,"Sorry, but you can avoid this one. Staccato dialog delivered by wooden actors for the most part. The two female leads were the only ones who appear to know how to deliver a line, even as bad as it is sometimes. And to give Tom Skerritt what amounts to top billing for his less than 10 minutes on screen is an obvious ploy to attract viewers, which it did for me. The storyline deserved better writing, better acting, and better production values. Unless you're out of things to watch, let this one go.",1333238400,4,501,4.397849462365591
5020187,3,B006US3UNK,"""Lock up your wives and daughters, Eden Jackson's back in town."" Eight years after a terrible accident affected a small Idaho town the man responsible returns to start his life over. Almost instantly the town begins to treat him as an outcast and refuses to accept him back to the community. Slowly he begins to win his ex over and secrets start to come out that change the town forever. I have seen a few movies like this (I can't remember the names of them) but it has the feel of a movie like ""Pure Country"". An exiled resident returns to face his past and meets resistance. You have all seen that movie before so you won't be surprised. This movie is pretty cheesy but it is actually not bad and does have a twist at the end that isn't totally predictable but not unexpected. Without trying to spoil the movie I will let you know that Tom Skerritt is in the movie for about 2 minutes, so if that's why your renting it be warned. Overall, not really a whole lot to say about this movie. Cheesy but an OK movie that many will like. I give it a B.",1332460800,4,1048,4.218905472636816
