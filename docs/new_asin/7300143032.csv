The plot evolves around the detective, his values and his personal life.  One should note that the transfer no the dvd is not the best possible as there are few problems with the sound and picture quality.

1112641,4,7300143032,"The Detective was one of Frank Sinatra's best movies. Tough as nails as always, determined, honest, and principled, Sinatra plays a New York City homicide investigator who is looking into a murder of a gay man. His investigation leads him into police corruption and conspiracy.

Sinatra gives a great performance, and the film may be somewaht dated, but presents gay characters that are not stereotypical. Lee Remick plays his wife, from whom he's separated, and gives her typical solid performance. Other great supporting performers include Jack Klugman, Ralph Meeker, Lloyd Bochner, and Tony Musante.

The Detective is definitely a worthwhile film for Sinatra fans, and for those who enjoy a nice, well-acted thriller.",1162598400,,720,5.3628318584070795
1112642,3,7300143032,"Someone wandering into a showing of ""The Detective"" in 1968, after a movie absence of say a year or so, might well have not beleived what they were seeing or hearing.

The film broke a certain amount of new ground at the time as it depicted somewhat graphically the mutilation murder of a homosexual.....one of Sinatra's first lines of dialouge as New York detective Joe Leland is ""penis cut off....fingers shredded.....""

Despite the first time utterances of screen obscenities and its dabbling in the worlds of homosexuality and nyphomania, the ""Detective"" felt somewhat square and retro even at the time of its initial release--could be all those New York cops in snap brim hats running around calling homosexuals ""fags"" and the Jerry Goldmsith score with that lonely trumpet right out of 40's film-noir--one has to remember this was also the film era of ""Easy Rider"" and ""The Graduate""

Screenwriter Abby Mann puts so many liberal platitudes in Sinatra's mouth, there are times in the film when he sounds more like a crusading social worker than a tough cop--""there are things to fight for, and I can't fight for them while I'm here..""

In any case ""The Detective"" provided Sinatra with one of his better roles in the 60's although that trademark fedora made him look older than his 52 years at the time, and the supporting cast (especially Lee Remick as Leland's nymphomaniac wife) is fine.

It might also be worth noting that ""The Detective"" played a part in the breakup of Sinatra's marriage to Mia Farrow.

Farrow was originally scheduled to play the part of Norma Mc Iver but scheduling problems with ""Rosemary's Baby"" led to the role going to the beautiful Jacqueline Bissett (sporting a Mia-type short hairdo)and to Mia being served with separation papers on the ""Rosemary"" set.

1112643,3,7300143032,"Sinatra really was an underrated actor and I'm guessing a lot of younger people today may not even know about his acting career.  Sinatra starred in a number of crime dramas in the 1960's notably Tony Rome and Lady in Cement.  The Detective is one of his lesser known films but by no means a bad film.  He plays a New York Detective named Joe LeLand who is investigating the murder of a gay man and fighting a political battle as well with the pressures to solve the case.  Lee Remick plays his estranged wife and a bit of a sex addict.

The supporting cast really helps out a movie that has a plot that's a bit all over the place.  Besides Remick we get Tony Musanta, who was so gripping as the thug in ""The incident"", Jack Klugman, and Robert Duvall.  With it's homophobic, and sex and drugs undertones The Detective was probably fairly edgy for 1968 but in present day it all comes off a bit forced and a bit cheesy.

This is a story of tortured people keenly told focucusing on wwo main plots: a homosexual murder and the connected subplot involving an urban housing scandal. Both are well woven into a gritty storyline that is stronger that the written work of Roderick Thorp. The most effective visuals: ugly police tactics that lead to the execution of a wrongfully convicted petty criminal, convincingly played by Tony Musante, in one of his first screen roles and the stench of 1960's NYPD corruption.  Sinatra is outstanding in the lead role, showing a realm of extreme emotions: dogged, rigged, self righteous, guilt ridden, defeated.

1112667,3,7300143032,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

Released in 1968 I was surprised at how much times have changed while watching this film. The subject of homosexuality was just being touched on and still easing out of the taboo stage with movies like THE BOYS IN THE BAND still 2 years from release. Even more surprising was the fact that Frank Sinatra was involved here giving one of his more subtle performances.

Sinatra stars as Joe Leland, a New York police detective who lands a career changing case. The son of a well-connected millionaire has been murdered and signs of his sexual choices can be found at the crime scene. The same holds true for the list of suspects connected to the case making it not only career changing but a sensitive case as well. Leland and his crew catch the suspect, sweat a confession out of him that sends him to the electric chair and Leland moves up in rank and position.

But something wasn't right. Leland was aware of this when the whole deal went down. As time passes another case lands on his desk involving the apparent suicide of an upper crust accountant. His wife is certain he didn't commit suicide but was murdered instead. As Leland looks into the case a connection to the one that made his career is found. If he follows the leads it could result in the demise of his career. If he doesnt can his conscience hold up to the knowledge he finds?

As a movie the film feels as if it plays things by the numbers in style and acting. Nothing felt as if it stood out while I watched the movie. What did stand out was the handling of the subject matter. The difference in how it was handled compared to today shows how far society has come on the subject. Where scenes involving gay nightclubs featuring little more than guys standing around talking or picking one another up were shocking for their time they pale in comparison to even TV shows today that feature characters in bed together in the middle of various physical acts.

Is it for the better? I don't know. My own personal belief is that there is far too much made of sex in todays films and television shows. What was once titillating is now common place making it all seem to mean less while being emphasized more. As Ive said before there are only so many ways to shoot two people making love in front of a fireplace and I think weve exhausted them all.

At the same time it was movies like this that changed the perception of the gay community. It not only removed the shame but the violence brought on those in the community as well. Whether you agree with the lifestyle or not I think we can all settle on the fact that violence towards someone is not the answer. The fact that someone as influential as Sinatra helped to make that point makes this movie historically worth watching.

Twilight Time, a company I have hailed on more than one occasion, has once more brought out a version of a film that holds to the highest quality to be found. The print is clean and as clear as it can be. Extras found on this release include an isolated score track, an audio commentary track featuring film historians Dave Del Valle, Lem Dobbs and Nick Redman and the original theatrical trailers.",1453334400,,3201,4.461538461538462

1112669,4,7300143032,"Back when this movie premiered in 1968, it stirred up its share of hubbub. In an era in which Hollywood cinema was just beginning to explore new liberties concerning language, violence, and tittilation, The Detective caused the Gertrudes and Mortimers of the world to fan their faces and mutter words like ""The nerve!"" or ""Well, I never!"" Nowadays, the Detective is comparatively tame, lacking that lurid punch to the face. But, yeah, it is a psycho-sexual police drama that aired out formerly taboo subjects like homosexuality and nymphomania. Frank Sinatra is in fine form as Sgt. Joe Leland, a jaded but honorable New York homicide detective who gets caught up in a case involving the fatal bludgeoning and, uh, depenistration of the son of an influential politico. I was channel surfing and stumbled across this one, and credit it for being an absorbing drama, because I never did turn the channel until it was done.

The Detective adapts Roderick Thorp's 600-page novel, and thank goodness for the film's opting for relative brevity. It's a heap of solid, professional actors, from a fantastic Lee Remick (who plays Leland's troubled wife) to a stunning Jacqueling Bisset (yet almost unrecognizable in her short bob do), from old vets like Jack Klugman and Ralph Meeker to Al Freeman Jr. (whose young cop newly come to the 19th Squad later reveals an unexpected side to him) to a decades-younger but very menacing Robert Duvall. But it's Sinatra's vehicle all the way. Old Blue Eyes makes full use of his baby blues as they become the gateway to a series of flashbacks. Sinatra does mighty fine in these hard-boiled roles. He generates this air of toughness and world-weariness. He paints a picture of a copper whose righteous dedication and inability to sugarcoat things have alienated his more, um, flexible colleagues. His ""Joe Leland"" reminds me of Ned Stark from Game of Thrones, both of them these straight shooters forever submarined by their inability to compromise and play the game.

Chock full of great dialogue, oozing with cynical mood, bringing the mild kinky, it's an interesting and sort of trippy peek into how 1960s Hollywood perceived and portrayed gays back in the day. There's an accidentally hilarious scene in which gay dudes were cozying up at a truck lot by the docks that hearkened me back to that rest stop scene in There's Something About Mary. The Detective is also an unsentimental study of old school police investigation, back before smart phones and hi-tech CSI methodology. The seediness is pervasive, as is the sense of corruption, and that desolate vibe is abetted by a bleak, bluesy musical score that when you listen to it makes you want to shrug on a trench coat and a fedora, light up a cancer stick, and start monologuing about the mean streets and duplicitous dames. I'll be up front and mention that the murder case didn't intrigue me as much as did Leland's relationship with his messed-up wife (Remick). Lee Remick did a fantastic job of etching a character who loves her ex-husband desperately but can't help what she is. I found her to be the most likable and most tragic person in this movie. I'd like to think, in the end, she and Joe Leland gave it one more try. They could use a break. Except the movie ends in ambiguity.",1428883200,,3277,4.839572192513369

This is based on the novel by Roderick Thorp. An automobile stops, Joe Leland arrives at a murder scene. A dead man lies on the living room floor; he is mutilated. The ME arrives. Where are the missing body parts? Detective Leland looks around. [No dusting for fingerprints?] ""It takes all kinds."" Another tenant is questioned about the deceased. Leland doesn't allow one man to intrude on the crime scene (he has connections). Joe meets Karen Widener at a social event. They meet again. Karen speaks her mind. Being a cop is the most useful thing he can do. Karen was an orphan. Joe talks to her. They become friendly. [This explains their past.] They watch a football game. There is hearing on a police shooting, an accident. People on the outside don't understand.

Leland gets a call to an apartment. Will he help a 19-year old? Can he make it to the top? Can he crack a murder case in 48 hours? They question suspects. A detective visits health clubs, then an apartment house to find the suspect. Getting a confession will assure Leland's promotion. Can he use psychology to get a confession? [Isn't this distasteful?] Leland feeds Felix information and gets him to talk. [No Miranda warning?] Later Leland sees Karen in a bar with another man, an old schoolmate. That night he talks to Karen. ""Who is it?"" Joe tells his wife what to do. The next night he surprises Karen with another man! Is there something wrong with Karen? Yes, she explains. Leland is promoted to Lieutenant. Felix pays the price for his murder. A man falls from a racetrack's roof. A young girl goes missing. Who is the suspect?

Mrs. Mac Iver visits Lt. Leland about her husband's death. Is there a conspiracy? She hired a private detective but they dropped out. Was it a suicide? Were pages missing from Colin's notebook? A 68-year old man is questioned nude; the detective got the idea from Nazi methods. Are tenements in the ghetto the most profitable for landlords? Is it worth money to Leland to squash the Mac Iver case? Leland questions Mrs. Mac Iver. He visits Dr. Roberts to ask about Colin. He treated Karen. Leland doesn't like psychologists. Norma had a police record. She tells Leland about the room with Colin's records. Joe finds a ledger with names and money amounts. Joe survives an assassination attempt in his parking garage! ""Rainbow"" refers to a Planning Commission, who decides where new buildings are located. Wendell Roberts' name is on the list. ""Be careful!"" Leland snoops in Roberts' office. There is a tape from Colin Mac Iver. ""Play it!"" We hear Mac Iver's voice as he tells about his secret. [Sensationalism to attract customers?] ""What's the matter?"" There is an argument and a fight. Colin was guilty of a murder. A few weeks later Colin fell from the rooftop. Did he face responsibility? What will Leland do? ""You'll never win"" says the Captain. Why did he do it? What will Joe do now? Goodnight (and goodbye).

This movie has sensational parts and topics formerly censored, it still seems below average. Was the pacing too slow? Was the story too complicated? There was a slight reference to a ""Planning Commission"" whose members seek to enrich themselves by their control of land, the basic unit of wealth from time immemorial. Isn't this the real crime that affects everyone's taxes? Was the book better? This 1968 movie records the attitudes and culture of that era. Was it meant as an attack on capital punishment?",1412985600,,3471,4.760797342192691

1112690,4,7300143032,"Based on a bestselling book, and incorporating some controversial plot elements for its time, the urban police drama The Detective (1968), was promoted as being an ""an adult look at a police detective"".  While not having a particularly ""enlightened"" attitude toward homosexuality, the film does deal with some provocative topics.

Frank Sinatra (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Von-Ryan-s-Express/dp/B009A8825S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Von Ryan's Express</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ocean-s-Eleven/dp/B003QHWG9W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ocean's Eleven</a>) plays Joe Leland, a NYPD homicide detective in charge of the investigation of the murder of a gay man, who is found sexually mutilated in his apartment.  Suspicion falls on the victim's roommate, and an arrest soon follows.  Also in the mix is the unraveling of Leland`s relationship with his wife Karen (Lee Remick,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Experiment-in-Terror/dp/B00AYJVSR6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Experiment in Terror</a>), an influential psychologist (Lloyd Bochner), a grieving widow (Jacqueline Bisset,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Deep/dp/B00441GYSS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Deep</a>), and an elaborate web of corruption.

In exploring the subject of male homosexuality, The Detective enters territory that wasn't often dealt with at the time, as prejudicial views and attitudes are directed towards gay individuals.  The resolution isn't very predictable, and was probably quite shocking and provocative for the time.  The non-linear method of storytelling is a bit confusing, as Leland's personal issues, are meshed in an investigation where a number of disparate elements unexpectedly come together.

Sinatra gives a strong performance as a character who is edgy, cynical, and something of a social crusader, who is still quite clichd in some ways.  The film features a solid supporting cast that also includes Ralph Meeker, Jack Klugman (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Odd-Couple/dp/B001DHXT48/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Odd Couple</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Quincy/dp/B00005JO3P/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Quincy</a>), Tony Musante, Robert Duvall, and a brave William Windom.

The image quality of the wide screen presentation is very good, with rich colors.  Not your standard late 60's police drama, The Detective may overreach in places, and the manner in which it handles some material could be offensive to some, but the film can still be seen as ""progressive"" in some regards.

For the 60s this movie was over the top and probably considered sensationalized as well.  The victim of a murder has had his privates removed and is believed to be a gay male victim.  A black cop, trying to move up in the ranks, strips a suspect naked and has him tied to a chair because he saw it in an old Nazi Germany footage.  Sinatra's character is more outraged than being able to sway the minds of these people nor properly punish them.  He speaks of integrity and living by his own standards yet he lets those close to him get away with a lot.  That's the rub.  I'd say the actual investigation was done well enough and there are some good supporting actors alongside Sinatra, like Robert Duvall, Lee Remick, Jack Klugman and Jacqueline Bisset (to name a few).  The perceptions of gays and how they are perceived would not be a popular one today and people super sensitive on the topic shouldn't see this movie.  Those who do should see this as a period piece as to how gays were perceived and stereotyped.

THE DETECTIVE is a well-acted 1968 film that broke new ground---sometimes shattered it. Frank Sinatra is Joe Leland, a veteran NYPD Detective, who is assigned to investigate the brutal mutilation murder of the gay son of the richest real estate developer in New York City.

THE DETECTIVE tries to address its subject sympathetically. In the course of doing so, however, it taps into every gay stereotype. It actually taps into almost every stereotype, and yet, overall, it works. Impossibly dated now, THE DETECTIVE is a fly in the amber. Men are still wearing hats and women white gloves.

From the outset, THE DETECTIVE throws us off balance. Sinatra, tough-talking out of the side of his mouth, plays Joe Leland like a liberal Joe Friday, stolid, fair, and ""square."" His opening gambit, ""Penis cut off...fingers shredded"" was absolutely shocking for the time, and put THE DETECTIVE into the realm of film noir right from the beginning. Leland's investigation carries us through a nether world where (as the script describes them) ""closet queens"" have secret dalliances with other men.

THE DETECTIVE relies on Havelock Ellis' groundbreaking but inaccurate early 20th Century research into human sexuality to explain sexual orientation: ""There are no bisexuals,"" proclaims the film's noted psychiatrist, ""only homosexuals with no sense of commitment to their creed."" Gay men as portrayed in this film are all grotesquely ""swish."" The film is an outsider, looking in on a world it presupposes exists in a certain way. Still, THE DETECTIVE tries to make a serious social statement.

The script is full of words never heard before onscreen. Scenes of men mouth kissing stunned 1968 audiences. The gay subculture is portrayed as uniformly smarmy (more as a result of being driven underground than anything intrinsic).

The Cop Universe around Joe Leland is both anachronistic and brutal. Jack Klugman plays the Bill Gannon role, as Dave, Joe's thoughtful sometime partner. Most of the cops in Leland's NYPD are on the take. This was still a world where the boys in blue gave suspects the Third Degree. A suspected child molester is interrogated naked in the Station House. ""Breaks 'em down,"" the token Black cop (played by Sugar Ray Robinson) explains. ""I saw it in a newsreel on German Concentration Camps(!).""

The police routinely brutalize the gay men they find lurking in dark alleyways. Robert Duvall plays a particularly relentless homophobic cop, to whom the word ""fag"" is practically an honorific. He specializes in unprovoked beatings of his ""queer"" arrestees. The Department ME says, ""Twenty years on The Job and those people still make me sick,"" to which Leland responds, ""They don't bother me. I got my own bag.""

Joe Leland's bag is his wife Karen, played by the strikingly beautiful Lee Remick. Ms. Remick has a class and ease onscreen that current-day actresses simply cannot match. Karen, who grew up in orphanages, yearns toward Joe (and he toward her), but cannot overcome a deep-rooted self-destructive psychological compulsive need to seduce other men. Although Joe and Karen are separated, it makes little difference. They clearly love one another and spend much, frustrating, time together.

Joe is a decent man and a good cop, but even he isn't immune to his environment. He coerces a spurious confession from a ""psycho"" gay muscleman (Tony Musante in his first role) who goes to The Chair for the murder even though Joe knows he's innocent.

Joe is promoted for closing the case. Not long after, Joe is visited by Jacqueline Bisset, whose husband has mysteriously committed suicide. Joe then discovers that he committed the murder, which is tied into a high-level real estate scam involving the Mayor.

Joe's sense of justice is outraged. ""Those people up in the ghetto are tired of living in garbage cans!  It's our job to sit on the lid of those garbage cans! And when the lid blows off, brother, we are going to be in for it!""

The sincere Liberalism of THE DETECTIVE is what makes it work, despite its repeated references to ""those people."" Gifted screenwriter Abby Mann takes a subject which was absolutely forbidden and brings it into the light with the best of intentions. Although THE DETECTIVE tends to be ham-handed, Sinatra plays it well, without parodying himself. It is instructive to remember that this film was the first of its kind. It tried to humanize its characters and subject. If it did a flawed job, it still set our feet on the right path.",1286755200,11,4759,5.17295188556567

1112730,3,7300143032,"Here's one of the pictures where Frank isn't just passing through, but seems to be making an effort.  He's good as a tough NYC cop on the way up, if his anti-authority attitudes and compassion for gays and minorities don't sideline him.  This is similar to Madigan, and like that movie we get too much of the cop's home life as Frank ruminates on his marriage to nyphomanical Lee Remick.  She's effective in her big scene, but a cloying distraction elsewhere.  The rest of the cast is pretty solid with Frank squaring off with Ralph Meeker, Lloyd Bochner and a young Robert Duvall as a gay-bashing thug on the force.  These scenes are the picture's coolest as Frank matter-of-factly shoots down the other characters' homophobia.  He's got his ""own bag.

1112731,4,7300143032,"THE DETECTIVE is apart of those movies from the late sixties that are the beginning of modern movie making.  I had been wanting to see this for a long time for its taboo subject matter.  At least taboo for the times.  To see this movie because you might think it is a ""gay"" movie and to see the shock value is wrong.  This movie is much more than that.  It is Frank Sinatra at his best.  He's a little aged, but still one of the coolest cats ever.

I was impressed with the way Sinatra's character was played.  He was so calm and cool under pressure.  The best example is the interrogation of the ""insane"" gay man.  The other cops were trying to scare it out of him but Sinatra told everyone to leave and he took care of it his way, calm and cool.  Just like Sinatra was.  The movie was even able to weave in a love story between Sinatra and his girlfriend/wife.  They are going through rough times, but by the end of the movie, you assume they are going to get back together.

Another great part of THE DETECTIVE is the flashbacks and the final scene that is narrated by an important character.  The flashbacks are great for the back story on Sinatra's wife and their problems.

The only negative about the movie is for just a few minutes I remember thinking this should have been cut out or re-edited.  But it's not a big problem.  Also, the gay men are portrayed incorrectly, but that was the public opinion then, so that's the route they took.  Overall, a great, great film that I plan to watch again soon.",1217980800,2,1510,4.290780141843972
1112732,3,7300143032,"Based on the 1966 novel by Roderick Thorp, THE DETECTIVE was among the highest grossing films of both 1968 and one of the most popular of Frank Sinatra's film career.  At the time it was considered remarkably honest in its portrait of a no-nonsense cop who finds himself trapped between a series of compromises and his own sense of integrity.  Today, however, it chiefly notable for its unintentional window onto 1960s homophobia.

Joe Leland (Frank Sinatra) is a third generation New York City police officer who begins the film with two victories: in his private life, he has wooed and won a remarkably beautiful wife, Karen (Lee Remick); in his professional life, he is assigned to a particularly notorious murder case that he quickly solves and which results in a major promotion.  But both explode in his face in particularly unsavory ways.  Although flawless on the surface, Karen is a distinctly disturbed woman who shatters their marriage through a series of compulsive affairs.  And although it seems solved, the case on which Joe's promotion rests may not be nearly as simple as every one thought at the time.

The case involves the brutal murder of a gay man who is found with his head battered in and sexually mutilated--a circumstance that leads Joe and his co-workers to prowl 'known homosexual hangouts' such as gyms and the waterfront.  In the process, the film creates a portrait of the gay community that says considerably less about the gay community than the way in which heterosexual America thought of it at the time.  The gay men themselves are improbable, being pulled out of group gropes from the back of cargo trucks, flexing muscles in tawny-colored gyms, frequenting bars notable for satin and velvet, and lounging about in silk robes.  They come in two basic varities, victim and predator.  They are weak and are routinely brutalized by both each other and the police, the latter of which positively delight in knocking them around.

This is not particularly unusual for films of the 1960s and the 1970s; it is much the same portrait presented by such diverse films as ADVISE AND CONSENT and CRUISING.  What is unusual is Joe's attitude toward them: unlike his co-workers, he dislikes seeing them mistreated and prefers to see them (and indeed all other suspects) accorded a certain basic respect as human beings.  It was a very, very bold stance for a film to take at the time.  Even so, it does not counterbalance the portrait itself, which is intrinsically demeaning, or the story, which ultimately pivots on a version of ""gay panic""--a heterosexual myth used here with a slight spin.

The chief grace of the film is the performances of Sinatra and Remick.  Today Sinatra is best recalled as a singer, but he had some significant acting chops, and he proves more than able to over the shortcomings of the script.  Lee Remick, a much-admired actress, is flawlessly cast as the perfidious wife Karen, a woman who superficial qualities conceal an unraveling personality.  The supporting cast, which features Jacqueline Bissett, Jack Klugman, and Robert Duvall, is also quite fine.  But the script is weak, the story choppy, the film is a shade too glossy for its subject--and its incredibly niave portrait of gay men tends to overpower everything.

All films must be considered in the context of their eras, but even so a good film can transcend its era.  THE DETECTIVE doesn't manage to do that: sometimes ridiculous to the point of being amusing, sometimes so grotesque that it becomes a bit embarassing.  All the same, it remains interesting primarily because it offers a window on what mainstream Americans of the 1960s thought homosexuals were like.  The DVD offers the film in original widescreen format; the transfer, however, is merely acceptable.  Recommended primarily to Sinatra fans and film historians interested in Hollywood's frequently off-the-wall portray of gay men.

1112733,3,7300143032,"The Detective suffers from excess baggage that detracts from the main story. I would have eliminated most if not all of the Lee Remick character. The reminiscences regarding the beginning and deterioration of Joe Leland's relationship with Karen are too long and break up the progression of the plot. The director has forgotten that his main story is that Detective Leland coerced a confession from a man he describes as a psycho, and he's guilt ridden over it. He failed check out the veracity of the confession because he saw a quick case closure to be a ticket to a promotion denied to his father. For example, he knows a good detective would have matched fingerprints on the murder weapon, but this clearly was not done. Another weakness was an over-reliance of 1960's liberal social values. For example, there was really no relevance of NYC ghetto housing failures to Detective Leland's poor police work or police corruption in general. Moreover, it was a gratuitous slap to any hard-working police officer to imply that they would watch Nazi concentration camp documentaries to gather effective interrogation strategies such as removing a suspect's clothes and questioning him while he was nude.

Get rid of Lee Remick, remove the needless social preaching, and you're left with a pretty entertaining drama. The director also would have had more time to develop the rainbow conspiracy (which had far more potential than a half naked Lee Remick). If you know the scene progression, you can use the bathroom or get some microwave popcorn going without using the pause.

Ralph Meeker was good as a sleazeball corrupt cop, and William Wendon (Commander Matt Dekker from an episode in Star Trek) was also very believable. When Sinatra wasn't being misused as some Great Society mouthpiece, he also was quite credible. It could be remade, but I would suggest LA Confidential if this was almost what you were looking for, but somewhat disappointing.",1186876800,,1948,5.027863777089784

The 'reason' to still watch it, is to see Frank Sinatra, at 53 still in his prime playing a world-weary detective on a case involving a high profile gay man who is murdered, a suspect who is caught, and made to confess by Frank. The other plot running alongside the murder is Frank meeting and marrying Lee Remick who has a little problem with screwing other Men. The way gays are portrayed and how they are treated by everyone but Frank in the film is pretty shocking by today's standards, but not inaccurate for 1968 I'd say. The sex addiction in Frank's marriage is handled pretty sensitively actually and both Frank & Lee Remick come off as sympathetic characters. That the film takes on these issues in a 1968 film warrants high praise in my view even if somewhat clumsily done. The 'climax' of the film where corrupt politicians are 'exposed' by Frank is actually somewhat ""anticlimactic and the weakest part of the movie in my view.",1508198400,2,1130,4.655

Hot Toasty Rag, September 13, 2017

I thought I was in for another Tony Rome when I rented The Detective: a silly, 1960s screwball detective comedy that made incessant sex jokes to celebrate the end of the Hays Code. Boy, was I wrong! The Detective is a very heavy drama, and while it absolutely takes advantage of the drop of the Hollywood censors, it does so very tastefully. Theres nothing funny about this movie, and unlike many 60s movies, its not dated.

Frank Sinatra plays the title character, and the plot alternates between his work life and his home life, showing his strain as he juggles being a detective with being a man. He falls into a whirlwind romance with beautiful Lee Remick, and the love scenes are steamy without being obscene, a combination that helps keep the movie classy.

The film discusses touchy issues like murder, the death penalty, homosexuality, nymphomania, and police confession tactics. Frank Sinatra gives a wonderfully conflicted performance; on one hand, he objects to using inhumane tactics on murder suspects, and on the other, he treats his wife disrespectfully when he comes home. I came here to ballaint that what you do best? he shouts during an argument. On the third hand, does she perhaps deserve this treatment? Watch The Detective to find out! Its entertaining and the acting is very good. I recommend it!

DLM Warning: Theres one scene where someone jumps from the top of a building and the camera spins out of control during the fall. Its about halfway through the movie, so keep on the lookout.",1505260800,,1573,4.836431226765799
