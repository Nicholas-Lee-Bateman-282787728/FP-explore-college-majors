972458,4,6305078246,"MST3K:TM on DVD is very good. You get the standard excellent picture and  incredible sound, and of course, the funniest movie of the decade. But  what is missing here is the extra added features which would have  warranted this receiving 5 stars.  Think of all the fun things which could  have been added: a blooper reel,  comments from Jim Mallon, Mike Nelson,  Trace Beaulieu, and Kevin Murphy  about their film, extra scenes which were  excluded from the final  theatrical version and much more. All you get with  MST3K: TM on DVD is  the standard jump-to-any-scene-you-wish interface and  widescreen  presentation.
Granted, if you are a fan of Mike and the Bots,  you don't need any extra  features to keep your attention, however, the  lack of extras may scare off potential buyers, especially those who are not  fans.
If you don't know by now, MST3K:TM is the story of a mad scientist  marooning a janitor in space with 3 robot pals on an orbiting satellite.  Mike Nelson, and two of his bot pals-- Tom Servo and Crow T. Robot are  forced to watch an edited down version of the 1955 sci-fi magnum opus  ""This Island Earth."" The mad doctor Clayton Forrester monitors  Mike's,  Crow's and Tom's minds while they are watching the film so that he  can  unleash the result on the unwitting public and rule the world. Mike  and  the bots do not go quietly, throwing a bunch of witty and often  humorous  insults back at the screen. What you get is a product which has  propelled the TV series to a ravenous cult following, boasting a  100,000+  member fan club, numerous internet websites, a book and even a  Peabody  award.
MST3K:TM is truly unique and it is truly incredible to see the  ""cow-town  puppet show"" unleashed on DVD.",913161600,6,1730,4.684563758389261
972564,5,6305078246,"Whether you're already a dedicated Mistie (fan of MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATER 3000), or a newcomer to the show, this set has much to recommend it. Originally released in late 2013 to coincide with the 25th anniversary of Mystery Science Theater 3000s first airing, it contains six movies rather than the usual four. A wide range of movie genres are represented, including a detective movie and an imported European myth in addition to the more usual horror and sci-fi fare. All of these episodes are good, some are among the very best in fans eyes.

Moon Zero Two - Or written differently, Moon 02 -- That is, the future relative to when the film was released (1969) and perhaps a subtle riposte to 2001. A kind of medium-budget space western, set on a partially colonized Moon, so if you're expecting special effects on the order of 2001 or OUTLAND, you may be disappointed. Pretty good riffing of macho posturing in this early (Year One) episode, though in my opinion too much was made of the female leads looks and helmet hair. Still, you can see the legendary MST3K wit in formation, such as referring to one visual as a combination of the TV shows HEE HAW and SPACE: 1999.

The Day The Earth Froze - Originally called Sampo for the magic mill at the heart of the story, and the source of all those Sampo references in other Mistie episodes. This 1959 Russo-Finnish production is, in my opinion, a treat for old and young. Based on the Finnish legend called KAREVALA, it was trimmed somewhat for American theatrical exhibition but is still enjoyable -- and its otherworldly and occasionally overblown quality promotes great riffing up at the Satellite of Love. The feature is preceded by a short subject (which often were included in MST3K broadcasts, especially in the early years): A Day at the Circus based on the old Clyde Beatty circus.

The Leech Woman (1960) - Or, Ponce de Leon meets the dark continent. A woman who claims to be over 140 years old makes contact with an American endocrinologist, whose ethics are tested when he realizes the magic powder she uses, if it pans out, has amazing commercial possibilities. Overuse of stock African footage makes a dubious movie even more suspect, though Mike and the bots have a great time pointing out such discrepancies. Occurring late (Season 8) in the series run, its also a great opportunity to catch the SOL crew picking up arcane references (I need the Lillian Vernon catalog!) from the subtlest of source-movie cues.

Gorgo (1961) - The success of Godzilla and similar Japanese monster movies prompted this 1961 UK-US production out of MGM, about a large aquatic reptile seized by sailors off the coast of Ireland -- who brings more trouble in his wake than anyone could have expected. Unlike the Japanese critters, the real culprit here is human cupidity (an impresario wants to exhibit Gorgo publicly) rather than nuclear testing. Critic Leonard Maltin makes a guest appearance on this episode.

The Bonus Disc Double Feature starts with Mitchell (1975), starring an unusually surly Joe Don Baker as an idiosyncratic detective, but it does have Linda Evans as the sleek call girl one of his enemies sets him up with. A meaningless round of bickering between Mitchell and her little boy seems to serve no purpose other than including a kid actor -- though its sore-thumb inclusion did spark many in-jokes in future episodes of the show. The Satellite of Love gang has much to comment on here, including Bakers lack of star quality and the clich&eacute;d quality of such movies: Lets rip off the last scene from Key Largo, Mitchell! This was Joel Hodgsons last appearance as host before Mike Nelson took control of Crow T. Robot and Tom Servo up in the Satellite of Love.

The last movie in this collection is The Brain That Wouldn't Die (1959) - A classic, both in terms of wack sci-fi-slash-horror and as a Mistie send-up. A woman is decapitated in a car accident while riding with her surgeon fianc&eacute;, who puts her head on life-support: Jan in the pan as Mistie mavens call it.  Said betrothed, showing increasing mad scientist tendencies, goes looking for a shapely body to graft Jans head onto. Joel and the bots have a great time sending up not only the situation, but the conventions of trashy films in general: When the soundtrack plays blatantly seductive music over an early-morning scene, Tom Servo mimics a radio deejay: K-PORN, he intones, Sleazy, slutty music all morning long. Its that kind of knowingness that makes this flick a favorite among MST fans. Its also Mike Nelsons first appearance as botmeister aboard the Satellite of Love.

Its hard to recommend this set too highly at the current price. I think Mistie mavens will enjoy adding any missing titles to their collections, and newcomers will get broad exposure to the kind of movies Mystery Science Theater 3000 lampooned in the past, and hopefully will continue to send up in the new revival.  Win-win!  And a bargain too.

Next Sunday, A.D. --
There was a guy named Joel,
Not too different than you or me.
He worked in a satellite loading bay,
Just polishing switches to pay his way;
He did his job well with a cheerful face,
But his bosses didn't like him
So they shot him into space.

We'll send him cheesy movies,
The worst ever made.
Joel says when you got lemons,
You make lemonade.
Now keep in mind he can't control
When the movies begin or end,
Because he used the extra parts
To make his robot friends.

972822,5,6305078246,"It's hard to believe that Mystery Science Theater 3000 is this old, but it also goes to show how classic comedy ages well while the trendy comes and goes. The ""Mystery Science Theater 3000 25th Anniversary Edition"" comes either in conventional packaging or in the deluxe limited-edition tin, which I purchased. Either way, it's a great assortment of MST3K humor from across the ages.

I have to say my favorite movie in the collection is the goofy space western ""Moon Zero Two"" which is trippy and hilariously dated; that it's a perfect target for the MST3K treatment is immediately obvious from the animated opening credits. I was also fond of ""Gorgo"" (with an especially funny cameo from Leonard Maltin!) which I don't think is a bad movie of the giant monster genre, it's just so British in its demeanor that it stands in great contrast from most of the kaiju films. ""The Leech Woman"" is another classic, and one I hold especially dear: I actually named my favorite cat ""Neil"" after the protagonist, mostly because of his constant summoning by name (watch it and see; it's a great recurring joke). ""The Day The Earth Froze"" is a crazy Finnish fairy tale about young love between Lemmink&auml;inen and Annikki which is constantly confounded by a witch, foreshadowing the wonderful ""Jack Frost"" four seasons later. It's one of the loonier plots to grace an episode of MST3K, and brings us the long-lasting mystery of the sampo. If you have to ask ""what's a sampo"" you need to watch the episode immediately!

A bonus disc presents ""Mitchell"", Joel Hodgson's last episode, and ""The Brain That Wouldn't Die"", Mike Nelson's first, along with an excellent short about that transition. Speaking of extras, Shout Factory has done a great job with this package: there are extras on every DVD and they are uniformly excellent, interesting, and relevant: particularly good is the multi-part special ""Return to Eden Prairie: 25 Years of Mystery Science Theater 3000"".

If you are a fan of MST3K this is an indispensable package; if you don't know much about MST3K this is a great collection to sample...or sampo!",1439337600,6,2102,4.898876404494382

As much as it makes no sense to make a movie of a show which shows movies over an 80-90 minute timespan, it works. A considerable budget (compared to the show) allows for better host segments, and the crew have really worked on their riffs of this one (more than usual).

Consider this a deluxe episode, and you'll be happy/",1410652800,,608,4.672897196261682

MST3K (Volume #28) I.E. ""25th Anniversary""

Moon Zero Two: (Joel, Trace & J. Elvis),(my reaction) movie & riffs fell flat. Rating 1/2
Bonus,'Return to Eden Prairie Pt1' 12.5 min, Not very interesting slow
rating 3 1/2.

The Day The Earth Froze (color?): (Joel, Trace & Kevin) A Viking themed movie. Seems a real swan was killed to make this movie. Riffs were pretty good - but movie was so bad - it brought it down. Rating 5
Short: 'Here comes the circus' (b+w)rating 7.
Bonus, 'Return to Eden Prairie Pt2' early making of MST 1/2 hour. Very Interesting!! Rating 8 1/2.

The Leech Woman:(Mike, Kevin & Bill)Seems to have Nothing to do with 'Leeches'. Trip to Africa. Sometimes the movie is better than the riffs. - then later it's vice verse. Some laughs here and there. Rating 4 1/2.
Bonus, 'Return to Eden Prairie Pt3' Drags a bit. Some about Mary Jo. 31 min. Rating 7.

Gorgo (color): (Mike, Kevin, Bill & Leonard Maltin)An English (as in the U.K.) version of Godzilla. 'Gorgo' looks Gross (same as parent). Not much point to movie (it Sucks!). Some good riffs! Rating 4 1/2.

Mitchell (color): (Joel, Trace & Kevin - Joel's final MST show)This movie is odd but watchable. A few good laughs. Intros to bring in Mike to replace Joel.
40:23 min a 'Blooper' by Gypsy? 'They have movie Line'? Rating 5.

The Brain That Wouldn't Die (b+w): (Mike, Trace & Kevin)One of My Favorite MST episodes - because the Riffs are so GREAT and perfect timing!! After seeing it about 4 times - I like it even more!! Best of this set!! Rating 9!!

I LOVE MST - and will keep buying ALL the sets!! I just review as I react to each episode. This is an art form. And what I offer is my opinion. My overall rating is based on averaging out my rating system over the 6 movies (Not factoring in the bonuses)- for this set (#29) - Rating 4 3/4. Thank You.

973280,1,6305078246,"This was given to me as a gift by someone who knows I love old horror and science-fiction movies. What they did not know is that MST3000 is aimed more at an audience who does not necessarily appreciate the films themselves, but the art of yelling ostensibly funny things at the screen. I've witnessed the phenomenon of shouting at the screen countless times at venues from Chicago grindhouses to college campuses, and what it bears out is that the things being said are only fitfully amusing and frequently blunt the effectiveness of the film itself.
This set is exemplary of the variable success of the MST3000 format, and their won't to pick any film that is old regardless of its merit. What the hell is Gorgo doing on this set?  Or Hammer's Moon Zero Two?  Or The Day the Earth Froze?? I could go on, but like MST's theatrical release of This Island  Earth (1955), these films are interesting, or sometimes insane, enough on their own without the repetitive and predictable quips from the peanut gallery.  Apart from the overuse of military stock footage, Gorgo is one of the best examples of its subgenre, and its inclusion substantiates that much of the ""fun"" derived by viewers of this series is looking down upon cinema from a different time when different technology.
And watching films like Gorgo or Moon Zero Two with fuzzy image quality and shadows in the foreground is for viewers with too much time on their hands, perhaps the ones at screenings who can't resist shouting out the most banal quips at inopportune moments. Or the ones who watch every DVD extra or every episode of The Walking Dead and Dr Who...perhaps its time for them to make a film themselves, or do something, instead of watching all the ""pop culture"" product that is manufactured for their demographic.",1396656000,,1786,4.751612903225807

It's also a pretty rounded set of movies, with selections from all the eras of the show, plus the two bonuses showcasing Mike's first two episodes aboard the SOL.

While this version does not include the collectible tin, it also doesn't have that $100+ price tag.  Frankly, I'm OK with that.  Not only does this include all the movies from the tin, but the same extras that Shoutcast has been lovingly adding to each release, including the mini-posters.

973473,5,6305078246,"Many of these episodes I have never seen before so for me it's a real treasure to find these and experience them for the first time.
Moon Zero Two is a blast, if you have missed this episode it's a must see.  There are many worthwhile extras like the gorgeous tin, the mini posters and my personal favorite, a three-part documentary called Return to Eden Prairie that examines the history of the show, the characters and the the people behind it.  This is brand new material made for this Anniversary Edition and it's a true love letter to the many fans of the show.  But I have to admit that there is a certain melancholy that sets in when watching these specials.  It is so rare that  the right chemistry comes together to create something as unique as MST3K.  All of the various talents of the people involved had to mix in just the right way.  These comedians, writers, actors, puppeteers caught lightning in a bottle.  They were still pretty young when success hit them and you get the sense through the many recent interviews that now that they are older they can reflect back and realize just how precious and special it was.  Cinematic Titanic and Riff Trax have had some hits and misses but they usually lack the spark found in the best MST3K episodes.
On a personal level, I'm an Atlanta native but I happened to be living in Minneapolis back when the show was being produced and lived in an area called Uptown.  One of my favorite haunts was a restaurant/bar called the Green Mill.  It was three blocks down from my apartment and being a single guy living in the city, I ate a lot of meals there and saw the bottom of a lot of pitchers of beer.  When Trace mentions that they were frequently at the Green Mill to discuss show ideas I about fell out of my chair.  There is a very good chance that on some random night I was in the very next booth and had no idea.  I wish I could go back in time and tell these guys Thank You and let them know how important the show would be for so many people.  Everyone has rainy days in their lives and this show is a 100% reliable weapon against the darkness.  It should be prescribed for people suffering from depression and anxiety disorders.  It has a Monty Python-like ability to remind us that life is really pretty silly and we shouldn't take it all so darn seriously.
One last comment about this collection:  Mitchell and The Brain That Wouldn't Die are on a single DVD and there is an animated Top Menu that has Mitchell trying to talk the disembodied woman into taking her clothes off.  It's the sort of inspired nonsense that makes this collection unique and is pitch-perfect in tone for the series.",1389657600,3,2657,4.407786885245901

973641,5,6305078246,"MST3K is one of those shows you either 'get' or you don't.  I've watched people sit stone-faced through MST episodes where others were literally rolling in the aisles with laughter.  It's just not a show for everyone, but if you are one of those people who gets the show then this is a must-have set for two of the movies alone...

The Day The Earth Froze is an episode from late in season 4 (2 years into the Comedy Central Joel era) and the show had both found its footing and had matured to the point where it now was more than just a cow town puppet show.  It had hit the big time, and everyone had stepped up their game to match the venue.  Season 3 and 4 were the era when MST came into its own, and this episode was one of their best.  The short ""Here Comes the Circus"" is priceless with Hitler clowns and other nightmarish images mocked to perfection.  The movie itself is a non-stop riffing masterpiece that slams every goofy fantasy trope the movie hacks up.

And Mitchell...  I've seen every MST episode ever made, and I have to say that Mitchell is without a doubt the finest work that Best Brains ever put out.  The Host Segments are all about Joel's departure, so they are kind of a mixed bag which add no real humor.  However, the movie itself...!  Mitchell represents the densest, most consistently funny level of riffing that MST has ever made - bar none.  Other movies represent worse films (Manos) but Mitchell is funny top to bottom and constantly delivers the laughs without being forced.  If you ever have to show a friend a movie to introduce them to MST then Mitchell would be the one.

The other movies (Gorgo, Brain That Wouldn't Die, Leech Woman, Moon Zero Two) are all more 'average' MST outings.  That still makes them better than 90% of the slop you see on TV nowadays, but they aren't as out of the park funny as Mitchell and Day the Earth Froze.  A good collection overall, but a 'must own' because of the two glittering gems contained in it.",1388275200,2,1974,4.393939393939394

The biggest bonus of all here was two rereleases of the Satellite of Love classics ""The brain that wouldn't die"" and Joels final film experiment  with Joe Don Baker's ""Mitchell"" either one alone worth the extra cost on this one, but if you break it down as a 6 movie mSt3k set its a particularly great deal, even better if you price those bonus movies alone, if could even find them.

Gorgo w/ nanites circus Lenard Maltin teams up with pearl to send a cruel film to the boys, then the bots & Mike stage their own production of Gorgo, Mike challenges the indifferent Crow and Tom to the William Sylvester trivia game

Then the Swedish fairy tale fantasy ""The day the earth froze"" & nightmarish ""Here comes the circus"" short. Also an Invention exchange featuring the Mads Unhappy meals & Joel's ""Snaction""  The Boys brainstorm clown acts with Joel's help to keep it from becoming ""too dark"" then much debate as to what a Sampo actually is... ""Sampo means Flavor"" or maybe it's just the Finnish title for it.

A trivial complaint, really, and a minor inconvenience when I go to store the movies.

I thought the extra disc with The Brain That Wouldn't Die and Mitchell was a fantastic addition to show the transition from Joel to Mike.  So you actually get 6 movies (even though you may already have these two).

That's not to say that the other MST3K releases between them have been bad, that's just how good this release is.

Gorgo is actually rather good for the time, and the documentary about the making of Gorgo is very interesting.

  Well I have to say that Shout Factory did a fantastic job transferring it to DVD for this set.  I love the whole set and so far have been pleased with all of the MST3K Shout sets but for me,  they knocked it out the park especially with their special features: The Making of Gorgo,  Leonard Maltin's ""Explanation""  and the theatrical trailer.
  I can go on and sing the praises of the whole set very easily but will leave that to rest of MST3k's fans.  I was so touched by the treatment of this film that I actually got a little misty-eyed. ( no pun intended...really).  I'm going to share my next viewing with my remaining family members that still remember this film.",1385769600,3,902,4.284023668639053
973779,4,6305078246,"Since there are plenty of reviews that describe the movies in this set I am going to write a different type of review.  Most people that would purchase these sets are already devoted fans of the show and don't need to hear any show-related info from me.

I will say that this set is diverse and covers major milestones of the show.  It includes an experiment from the first season along with two experiments from the Sci-Fi Channel days, but, it also includes the transition episodes that show how Joel escaped from the Satellite of Love and the first experiment to feature Mike in the theatre.

One great thing for the purists out there like me is the fact that Shout Factory includes the introductory scenes before the actual opening credits.  Rhino did not include these with their DVD releases.

What I am referring to is the black backdrop with the caption, Turn Down Your Lights (where applicable) for Seasons 2 and 3, and the Reel Inserts for Seasons 4 and 5 where they show a still from the movie and you hear a voice-over say something like, Show 501 Reel One Take One.  In this set, The Day The Earth Froze, Mitchell and The Brain That Wouldnt Die, all have the Reel Inserts before the opening credits.

Now for the bad news. I am hoping others will chime in and relate similar findings so that this issue can be addressed as soon as possible before other great experiments get released:

I noticed, that, soon after the Gamera Set, some of the experiments on later sets have digital
artifacts in the master prints.  I have noticed this in sets XXV and XXVI, as well as in this 25th Anniversary set.

It is hard to describe in words but it typically manifests itself as a quick white cloudy or dark bar at the top edge of the screen although it has appeared lower as well.

Sometimes, it looks like a pattern of vertical lines (almost like the old Thriller show).

These things disappear as quickly as they appear but there are usually between 8 and 12 of
them throughout an experiment, sometimes, even more.  They look like ghost frames that somehow got superimposed on the screen.

These things occur due to buffer problems with the software that is performing the conversion/transfer to disc.

They could be caused due to electrical current fluctuations during the burn process, or,
the computer environment suddenly and unexpectedly engaging in a background process.

Like I mentioned earlier, they may be simple flow-control problems during the burn process.

On this particular set, The Day The Earth Froze, The Leech Woman, Mitchell and The Brain That Wouldn't Die, all contained these artifacts throughout the run of the shows.

Moon Zero Two and Gorgo were fine.

I am not getting confused with problems in the masterprint of the movie itself because I am using my own experiences with transfers to DVD and I watch the silhouettes when I am troubleshooting to see if an anomaly affects the entire screen or just the movie part.

Like so many other MST3K fans I invested a lot of time and effort in to recording the shows on VHS tape back when they were being aired on T.V.

These Box Sets enable me to get rid of old tapes to make more room in the house (so I can buy more MST3K DVD Box Sets!); however, I had to wind up keeping tapes because my copies on tape are more perfect than the official DVD releases!

That is not good.

There are experiments yet to be released that I am dying to purchase like, Human Duplicators, High School Big Shot, Girlstown and the remaining Hercules movies that have not yet been released.

I would like to have perfect copies of these great experiments when they are finally released.

I hope Best Brains and Shout can refine the transfer process and eliminate these errors.",1385683200,17,3727,4.609090909090909
973780,5,6305078246,Having a Thanksgiving marathon watching these DVDs. The episodes are brilliant and hysterical and the extras are some of the best I've seen in an anniversary edition of any TV show or movie. They really put  thought and creativity into making these for all of us MSTies. Still the one of the best shows made. If you are a long time fan or just someone who has heard about Mystery Science Theater you will not be sorry you bought this.,1385596800,3,434,4.425
973781,5,6305078246,"First off please don't be swayed by non informative reviews based on price alone and personal opinion about said price. If you go to the shout-factory site you will see that the suggested retail price of this release is the same as previously released limited editions, $64.99. You alone can decide if the cost is worth the product you get, I will say that if you order from Amazon you will be spared the $8 shipping charges and that bonus content in included in the tin and not ""available only"" from Shout-factory like the last 2 bonus discs.

So with only 2 weeks till the 25th Anniversary limited edition tin ships, with 5 dvd's 4 previously unreleased episodes and 2 bonus episodes, Joel's last episode 512 ""Mitchel"" and Mike's first episode 513 ""The Brain That Wouldn't Die"" long, long time out of print from Rhino/Best Brains and the four episodes, ""Moon Zero Two"", ""The Day The Earth Froze"", ""The Leech Woman"" and ""Gorgo"", ""Gorgo"" which was pulled after the second showing due to copy-write infringement but somehow Shout-Factory was able to get the rights to release it. It's an English Godzilla and it is an incredible episode. I have the best quality fan copies out there of all the unreleased episodes and all the volumes that have been released 1-27 and all the single dvd releases including 512 ""Mitchel"" and 513 ""The Brain That Wouldn't Die"" and I can tell you from experience that the Shout-Factory releases are of amazing quality that far exceeds even the best fan copies. For me the price is very much worth it, I'm not that big on the bonus material but you get a ton, if you are, I'm far more into the episodes themselves and with this set you get 6 of them and 2 of them are on my top ten list of all time best episodes, ""Gorgo"" and ""The Leech Woman"" are a cut above, the opening 5 minutes of ""The Leech Woman"" are some of the best riffs the guy's have done to me, always makes me laugh.
 I for one am so glad that Shout-Factory is continuing to release what for me are some of the most enjoyable TV shows ever created and hope that Shout-Factory continues till all the episodes are released.

Im very happy to see them celebrating 25 years by bringing some classic episodes to DVD. Gorgo and Earth Froze are worth the price alone but we also get Mitchell! Either one of the Joe Don Baker films that are riffed are classics and it actually created a beef with Joe Don and the Mistie crew where Joe wanted to beat their A$$es.

Long before I discovered the fascination of Finland and Finnish culture, I was laughing until my sides ached while watching Joel and the 'bots skewer this movie. I can't wait to hear them singing ""He's a loser"" about Lemminkainen while using bad Scandinavian accents for much of the commentary. Do I remember the other three movies on this collection? Yeah, vaguely, and they'll be worth viewing.

973853,5,6305078246,"This set contains two episodes with show creator Joel Hodgson as host and two with head-writer Mike Nelson as host. The former are from the Comedy Central era of the show while the latter are from the Sci-Fi Channel era. These are four solid episodes that fans thought might never be on DVD, so Shout! Factory has again done an excellent job of securing the rights to the films to ensure fans can add these to their collection.

MOON ZERO TWO, Episode 111
James Olson and Catherine Von Schell star in this 1969 UK color science fiction film that is really just an old western about miners set in outer space. A group of criminals want to salvage a valuable asteroid by crashing it into the moon and the only place to do it unobserved is on another miner's claim, so they dispose of the miner. They hire a salvage team (headed by Olson) to get them the asteroid, but unknown to them the missing miner's sister (Schell) hires the same salvage team to help her find her brother. It's kind of a fun and lively movie with great sixties style music. Years later Catherine Schell would drop the ""Von"" from her stage name. Host segments include a moon landing pageant and Crow and Tom fight over the women in the movie in zero gravity. This is a rather enjoyable episode with a quite watchable movie.

THE DAY THE EARTH FROZE (with short: HERE COMES THE CIRCUS), Episode 422
This 1959 color Russian-Finnish movie is based on the Finnish folk tales set down in the Kalevala by Elias Lonrot and the original title was ""Sampo"". A sampo is a magic forge that produces salt, flour and gold. Apparently editors in the 1960s thought the Finnish folk tale was confusing to Western audiences so they chopped so much out of the film that it makes virtually no sense at all. This is similar to the hatchet job they did on the tale of ""Sadko"" by turning it into The Magic Voyage Of Sinbad. Anyway, the story revolves around the hero Lemminkinen battling the evil witch Louhi to rescue the kidnapped maiden Annikki. This American dubbed version of the movie is goofy fantasy fun and worked extremely well for MST3K. The short is also not to be missed as every short about circuses made fun of on MST3K turned out really funny. Interestingly, Joel and the 'Bots talk over the explanation of what a sampo is during the film, then make hilarious speculation about what it is for the rest of the episode. Both the movie and the short get related host segments. This is a must-see and must-own episode of the show.

THE LEECH WOMAN, Episode 802
This black and white sci-fi horror film from 1960 concerns an endocrinologist seeking to keep his wife forever young by taking serum from the pineal gland of younger women to do so, a process that is fatal for the victims. This movie was a staple of UHF weekend ""creature feature"" programming back in the 1960s and 1970s. This was only the second episode to air of the new Sci-Fi Channel version of MST3K so Bill Corbett is still settling in with his portrayal of Crow. It's an entertaining episode using a fairly well-known low-budget Universal Studios film. The movie can be a little tedious in parts, but Mike and the 'Bots make it fun.

GORGO, Episode 909
Some UK film makers created their own Godzilla-like color film in 1961 and called it Gorgo. Eugne Louri directs this decent ""kaiju"" type monster film about a large dinosaur-like creature captured and put on display in the UK under the name, Gorgo. When an even larger parent monster comes looking for the baby Gorgo she gives London the same treatment that Godzilla gives to Tokyo. Gorgo is a pretty good movie of its type for the time which makes for an enjoyable episode of MST3K. Like the Leech Woman, Gorgo used to be on UHF TV a lot back in the 1960s and 1970s and its nice to see what MST3K does with another relatively well-known film. This episode aired only twice on Sci-Fi Channel before an apparent rights dispute forced them to stop showing it, so it's fantastic good news for MSTies that Shout! Factory was able to get the rights to release this episode. Don't miss it!

- The box of DVDs comes in a 25th Anniversary Collector's Tin
- Bonus double-feature DVD with MST3K episodes Mitchell and The Brain That Wouldn't Die (which have been out of print for a while)

973854,3,6305078246,"Sadly, this was a bare-bones DVD, with no extras... just the 1996 movie in widescreen with a menu. Unlike other MST3K episodes on DVD, this does NOT include the original movie (""This Island Earth"") uncut (though this movie is available on DVD separately). It's non-anamorphic widescreen.

The DVD went out of print quickly and went for incredibly high prices on Ebay for a long time. Now the DVD is being re-issued, and it may be in anamorphic widescreen (I'm not certain of this), but otherwise it's just as bare bones as before.

However, you'll be able to get it for $15 or less, so please get that new edition this May!

To MST3K Fans: This is worth seeing to ""complete your collection,"" but be warned, apart from taking advantage of the PG-13 rating (there are a few instances of profanity) and a slightly higher budget for the host segments, this is average at best in terms of humor. The TV series has done FAR funnier riffs on bad movies, much more entertaining host segments, and even the rate of jokes per minute is lower in this one than your usual episode. If you're new to the series, check out ""The Essentials"" to get a better experience. This movie has a special place in my heart though, because I've seen it countless times with friends, to the point where I have nearly every joke and scene memorized.",1207353600,2,1319,4.580508474576271

The good news is that, in a press release dated 23-January-08, Shout! Factory announced they have ""secured worldwide home entertainment and digital download rights to the cult TV series.""

So, the movie is destined for a new DVD release, probably by May 2008!

973856,5,6305078246,"This MST3K effort produced for the big screen is a slight variation of the usual fare.  Very funny, of course, but just a bit different.

The victim movie in the instance is, ""This Island Earth"" (1955).  A little campy, but actually not too bad of a sci-fi film on it's own.  A much better source product than some of the low budget B-movie abortions that are commonly used (and are so hilarious w/ the MST treatment).  The movie has been cut down so that the whole presentation is less than 90 minutes.  The cutting job on This Island Earth was seamless and the viewer never really sees anything amiss.

The off-screen skits by Mike and the Bots are fewer, longer, and of higher quality (re: the sets, props, careful scripting).  It's good, but one gets the feeling that some of the ad-lib and casual fun is missing.  Also missing is the catchy opening and closing theme music that (for me) helps create the whole Mystery Science Theater experience.

The treatment of the movie is well done and very funny.  None of the satire ever really ""falls on it's face"" (probably due to the absence of ad-lib, as I mentioned).

Currently the DVD price (new and used) for this is ridiculous, running well over $100.  May I suggest that you just buy the VHS.  Very reasonably priced.  You really won't miss anything and will save a bundle compared to the DVD.",1195862400,2,1348,4.558333333333334

A few downsides to the film is that the folks at Universal told the MST3K boys that they had to pick one of their movies (obviously) but it couldn't have been a ""bad"" movie (What the hell? That's the whole point. Movie execs.. I'll never get them.) and while it is shorter than your average MST3K episode (And runs shorter the original version of ""This Island Earth"" which is the movie the boys riff) it's still an entertaining watch.
Be farwarned though, the movie has been out of print for quite some time and there are certain people out there in internet land who will try and gouge you 100 bucks and upwards for it (as of the time of this writing some knuckle knob is charging 415 bucks for a USED copy..

This DVD is easily found in most major stores like Walmart/Target/Kmart and if you're on the west coast Fred Meyer!  Case in point, I found a bunch of these in a bin at Fred Meyer for $5.99.  I only bought 1 but heck this movie isn't worth $100+!  Studios know that when a movie is overinflated like this, it's only a matter of time before they release ""a newly"" released version.  It's quite simple for them to do actually and they make A LOT of money instead of seeing these ""bottom feeders"" try to swindle unsuspecting customers and studios!  Word of advice on DVD's OOP, no DVD is worth more than the initial suggested price.  If it's too expensive, wait until the DVD is affordable again.  A lot of DVD's that were released between 1996 and 2000 will be getting a re-release simply because the marketing audience of DVD's has literally changed 100-fold since the technology has become so available.

973933,5,6305078246,"When someone first explained the concept of Mystery Science Theater 3000 to me, I thought that it was the worst idea ever for a movie or television show.  Then I saw my first episode, and I was blown away at how funny it was.  For those of you who've only seen this movie and never an actual episode, you'll probably be surprised to learn that the movie they screen, This Island Earth, is actually pretty good compared to some of the other stuff they've shown.

Anyway, Mike Nelson (Mike Nelson) is a man who was shot up into space by a mad scientist named Dr. Clayton Forrester (Trace Beaulieu).  His plan is to rule the world by driving everyone insane by showing them the worst movie ever made.  Nelson is his test subject, and in order to keep his sanity, he built two robot friends, Tom Servo (Kevin Murphy) and Crow T. Robot (also Beaulieu).  The trio watches the movies and makes fun of the poor stories, bad acting, and awful effects.  Humor ranges from intelligent observations to pop culture references to low-brow cheap shots, so there is something for everyone in this movie.

From time to time, the movie stops, and we see what is called a ""host segment"", where Mike and the bots do stuff around the ship.  A lot of people think that the host segments are stupid, but I personally think that their stupidity is what makes them great.  After all, this show is poking fun at bad sci fi by being bad sci fi, so why not go with the flow?

If you have never seen an episode of the show, you may want to watch one before this movie because the density of jokes in this is a little smaller than in the show.  The writers were afraid too many people would be laughing in the theaters, and dialogue would be missed, so they toned down the joke count.  I know that sounds arrogant, but they weren't incorrect.

973936,5,6305078246,"First let me just say that I am a huge fan of the film and the show. One of the main reasons for a trip to the wilds of Minnesota in December '97 was to go on a tour of Best Brains Productions, which is where they filmed the show. I'd recommend any of the episodes on DVD and say that the movie is definately worth it too.

Now to explain for those of you that wonder why the film is out of print... Back in the day, Universal signed a deal with a production company by the name of Grammercy to produce films to be released through Universal. Everything seemed to be going okay until they started to have a dispute over, if my memory is totally correct, DVD and video revenues. Whatever the main reason, Grammercy took Universal to court over the whole thing and Universal stopped production on DVDs from their partnership with the production company. There are several films stuck in this little litigious black hole, like Pam Anderson's BARB WIRE, that have been allowed to drop out of regular circulation due to this battle. Unless there is some kind of decision either way concerning this, I think that the film will remain hard to find on DVD for the time being.",1105315200,4,1167,4.402777777777778

I've heard they cut out many scenes outside of the theater. Also, I don't know if they ever filmed the robots and Mike watching the whole movie of This Island Earth. The original movie This Island Earth was longer than the whole MST3K movie with them out of the theater and watching their own credits.

It has the greatest one-liners, that are funny in any circumstance.

No matter how many times you have seen it, it will always be funny, because everytime you watch it you will catch a joke you never heard before, either because you were laughing so hard from the previous one, or you didn't know what the heck they were talking about.  I would highly recommend this movie to anyone, although it does take a certain person to watch it.  You either have to be so dumb that it is funny, or smart enough to get the intellectual jokes.

I myself would always get together with friends and make fun of stupid movies, and that was what this show was all about. It took a while but finally we rented this movie and it was a blast.

I have never laughed so hard in my life- I was literally close to tears- I even almost choked (so be careful!). The story of a mad scientist who wants to take over the universe by showing everyone a movie so bad it will make them bow to his will is great by itself, but it's not until you see him showing the movie on his test subjects Mike and two robots that the fun really starts. Their silluettes make the most sarcastic comments throughout the movie and you can't help but fall in love with how brutal they are! The most fun at a movie I've had in YEARS!

973941,5,6305078246,"The popular TV show that revolves around a man and his two robots heckling horrible movies in space has found its way on film (very hard to find, but it's there!).  ""Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Movie"" gives you the rare opportunity of enjoying a bad movie as Mike and the robots are there to help you through it with their wisecracking and flawless delivery.  It's true that anyone can heckle a bad movie... but very few can do it as good as these guys can.

The mad and evil scientist, Dr. Clayton Forrester, has created an evil little scheme that is bound to give him world domination... but first thing's first.  He plans to torment Mike Nelson and the robots by sending them a real stinker of a film to watch called, ""This Island Earth.""  He is convinced that this movie will drive them insane.  And since the guys cannot control when the movie begins or ends, they are forced to witness the true horror that is this awful movie that has a lobster creature dressed in slacks.  Will this be the ultimate cheese that breaks the boys' spirits?  You'll find out once you begin this hilarious movie.

The movie isn't all that different from the regular show, which is a major plus.  Sure, there is a little bit of a plot going on that concerns Dr. Forrester's plan for global domination, but there's always a side story like that going on in each of the episodes.  The movie may look a little more professional than the show, but that's the only difference.  We still see the three silhouettes wisecrack and mock their way through the awful movie.  Their delivery is always constant and right on target.  In fact, you're bound to catch something new that you didn't catch the first time around when you watch it again.  ""This Island Earth"" was a good choice for the movie, although they have been through much worse than this (see the episodes ""Space Mutiny"" or ""Manos: Hands of Fate,"" and you'll see what I'm saying).  The DVD has no extras whatsoever.  Not only that, but it is EXTREMELY hard to find these days, so good luck trying to find it (it's out there somewhere).

""Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Movie"" doesn't disappoint in any way.  It's always funny, always fresh and always clever.  Fans of the show will most likely love the movie.  It can even be enjoyed by those who are experiencing MST3K for the very first time.  If you're lucky enough to stumble upon this little gem, then I highly recommend checking it out.

The plot isn't really too important. Average joe Mike is an unwilling pawn in his bosses plans to find the worst movie ever created and unleash it on the world to secure an easy take over. With the aid of robot pals Tom Servo and Crow T. Robot, Mike does his best to survive the experiments by mocking the hell out of them. The results are hilarious.
The film being mocked this time round is ""This Island Earth"", a typical old fashioned sci-fi with a handsome hero, a damsel in distress and an out of control monster. A nuclear scientist is recruited by a strange individual who claims he is working towards world peace, but is really covering his true agenda... The film is cheesey and fits the MST requirements quite nicely. As others have said, TIE is edited down to fit it in so those interested may want to look in finding the original.
The one weak area is the parts with just the MST cast. Dr Clayton Forrestor provides some laughs, but scenes such as Mike crashing into the hubble will likely have you looking at your watch and wondering when they'll be back to the theater.

Robot, are repeatedly forced to view horrendously bad movies in a sadistic experiment to test their breaking points. But Mike and the bots are too clever to let bad movies get them down. Though it can be tough at times, they always pull through by turning torturous films into hilarious ones. As they sit in their own private theater, showing us only their silhouettes in the lower, right-hand corner of the screen, we overhear their smart and sarcastic comments and insults about virtually everything the currently playing movie shows us.

It sucked then, but now I think it's genius. If you have a pulse, purchase this DVD...and his casket was made entirely out of coconuts, thank you.......",986256000,,317,4.19672131147541
974196,4,6305078246,"This Mystery Science Theatre episode was shown in a few selected theatres in the US in 1995, wildly popular with the fans of course, but ignored by everone else. But now you can own it on DVD! At 74 minutes it is not longer or remarkably different from a television episode, but the higher budgets mean the host episodes have better sets, plots, and special effects than usual. The general story behind MST3K series is explained for the newbies (crazy professor tries to drive test subjects mad with bad films, in order to find the perfect world domination weapon. Test subjects try to stay sane by using their sense of humor and relentlessly mock the films) so it is a good introduction if you are trying to get your friends hooked on the series. If you haven't seen MST3K, think Beavis & Butthead, but with bad movies instead of rock videos, and three clever guys instead of two morons. Only, two of them are robots. And MST3K came BEFORE Beavis and Butthead. But never mind.
The movie spoofed is ""This Island Earth"", a classic 50s sci-fi film where the cream of the world scientist community is kidnapped by an alien race with enourmous foreheads. The aliens' planet is dying and they need the scientists help them save it. Or else help the aliens exterminate the human race so they can take over our planet instead. Which ever is more convenient. It is the kind of movie that is actually quite good for the genre, but still very goofy. In my opinion, these are the type of films that become the best MST3K episodes.
Show hilights include the time the hero's fighter jet is telekinetically controlled by the aliens and flashes a bright green. MST: ""Mmmm. Suddently I have this refreshing mint flavour"". Our hero frantically tugs on the rudder between his legs. MST: ""Ehhh...Mike? Should we be seeing this?!"" Hero: ""I have no control!"" MST: ""I just keep eating and eating!""
There are no extras whatsoever with this DVD (unless you count chapters as an ""extra""), but the picture is very sharp and the (stereo) sound is good. Appearently Siskel and Ebert gave MST3K: The Movie ""Two Thums Up"", and Ralph Novak from People called it ""The funniest movie to appear in theaters this year"". I can only agree. Not the best episode ever, but a must in your MST3K collection.",978393600,,2266,4.653366583541147
974197,5,6305078246,"The Science Fiction part of the entertainment industry can be an unsure place, you either hit, creating a beautifully intricate movie that most people enjoy, or miss, leaving the audience with a bad taste in their mouth as they leave the theater. With such a narrow margin for error, many movies have ended on the wrong side of the mark, making no profit at all.
That's where Mystery Science Theatre 3000 (MST3K, for those familiar with it) comes in. They cash in on the sci-fi that no one wants to see, and make it bearable, if not side-splittingly hilarious.
Case in point: Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Movie.
In this under-ground classic, you see Mike and the bots (as well as the evil Dr. Forrester) in all their glory. Heckling the sci-fi classic (which this one actually is) 'This Island Earth.' Some will tell you not to bother with this movie, but I am here to tell you: ""You must see this movie with your own eyes, if you go on someone else's opinion, you might be left in the dark for all eternity, never knowing the beauty of this movie.""
The premise is very simple, you watch 'This Island Earth' with the silohuettes of Mike Nelson and both of his robot friends, (Crow and Tom Servo) while they constantly make jokes at the movies expense. If anything is funnier than that, I am a three-legged chicken dancing around in a ballroom with Kim Baysinger. Forget that, please.
All in all it's a beautiful performance. while introducing the characters, for people who have never heard of the television series, it retains a great deal of the humor that appeals to those of us who still try to tape every single episode that airs on The Sci-Fi Channel.
If you are still uncertain about this great movie let me give you an explanation as to why it's hilarious. No other movie actually has the guts to stay for it's own credits and heckle themselves, commenting on everything from the 'special effects wizardry' to the fact that there weren't any puppets in this film.
Seriously, if I were to suggest one movie to buy on DVD this holiday season for anyone from the age of 13 to 47, it is Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Movie.
It's the most heart-felt movie I've seen since that one with Natalie Portman. Forget that too.",974160000,4,2231,4.58

MST3K  is simply a wonderful concept, executed with just the right degree of  studied amateurishness (if that's a word) and vicious sarcasm.

(apparently ratings were slipping and 'Sliders' had more teen appeal) In  any case, this movie is truly the culmination of the entire TV series. If  you have ever watched the original star trek tv series and made fun of  Shatner and his girdle - this movie is for you. If you don't laugh like  hell, then get all your friends together to watch it again, (drunk or  sober, sober is better there are so many jokes) I honestly pity you.

974278,5,6305078246,"Mystery Science Theater 3000 was one of the funniest shows on televison during it's run from 1989 to 1999 on the Comedy Central and SciFi cable channels, and it shows here in the big-screen verson.  It's not quite as  funny, but the blame there can be given to Grammrcy Pictures who  short-changed it and put their major efforts that year into their sure hit  ""Barb Wire"".  Having seen both films I can without fear of  retraction say that it was one of the worst moves in modern filmaking.  The basic plot is identical to the TV series, Mike Nelson and his two robot  pals, Tom Servo and Crow T. Robot, are trapped in space and forced to watch  the worst movies of all time by the evil Dr. Forestster.  The only way to  keep their sanity is to throw sharp and humorful barbs at the screen.  The  movie torn to bits this time is the scifi classic ""This Island  Earth"" which has supposely brillant scientists taking half the movie  to figure out these guys with huge foreheads are actually ALIENS!  The  humor used by our three heros is great, rolling on the floor laughing.  I  would recomend this DVD to anyone with the slightest sense of humor or  irony.  Five stars?

A close acquaintance tells me that I might enjoy posting here, so here goes:  This set is a bargain!  It contains five discs holding six MST3K episodes.  The films here are --
Moon Zero Two
The Day The Earth Froze
The Leech Woman
Gorgo
And on the bonus disc are: Mitchell, and The Brain That Wouldn't Die

I've seen all these movies, and they are representative of the ""Mistie"" experience at various points in the first ten years of that show, and good ""riffs"" in and of themselves.  Now that these Shout! ""Roman Numeral"" releases are into their thirties (XXX and following), this package might be a good place to start for the new ""Mistie"" who has seen the Eleventh Season episodes now on Netflix and wants to check out the show in its earlier, cable-TV, format.

7883862,5,6305078246,"This review is for the MST3K version of ""Colossus and the Headhunters"".  This 1960 Italian sword and sandals mess starts out with a tribe of primitive people escaping the stock footage destruction of their island with the help of a hero called Maciste (or ""cheese steak"" as the guys call him).  Unfortunately, the tribe goes from the frying pan into the fire by landing on an island controlled by a creepy guy who kidnapped the king with the aid of a tribe of headhunters and who wants to marry the hot princess.  I watched this movie on its own and believe me, there is a reason it got a 1.8 on IMDB.  Mike and the bots made the movie enjoyable with lots of jokes about the beefcake hero, lack of clothing and just how ludicrous the film was.  The highlight was near the end, during a ridiculous hoochie-coochie dance where the riffing was so funny that I was spewing root beer (sorry about the visual).  After this, the film became an incoherent mess and the riffing slowed a bit, but there were still some good one-liners.

Host segments:  The segments revolve around a fuzzy pink dog that Dr. Forrester invented called Nummy Muffin Coocol Butter which seems to enamor everyone except the bots, who hate it.  This includes a pretty good song by TV's Frank, who misses his pet.

This episode streamed with no problems.  This was a very funny episode and I recommend it.",1492732800,,1371,4.555102040816327
