2416487,3,B000BGR0UG,"Full Moon, the wonderful company that brought us such titans of terror as Puppet Master and Demonic Toys, brings us another story of little things that kill, Doll Graveyard. Unfortunately, this movie lacks some of Full Moon's pervious luster.

The dolls are horrible, scary, and full of gruesome ways to kill someone, the plot is nice and formula (loner kid who's into action figures is shunned and picked on until the puppets help him take on his bullies) but the poor finish, choppy editing, and odd lapses in continuity detract from the over all picture. The film has the feeling of a school paper that no one proofed before it got turned in.

Don't get me wrong, it's good to see Full Moon back in the saddle and swing of things after not tackling the demonic puppet/doll genre for a while. I'm glad they took a swing at it, but trying to compare this movie to the early work of the Puppet Master series is too harsh. This movie can't compare to that horror classic. Still, compared with the stuff that Lion's Gate and Asylum are cranking out, it's not half bad.

So if you want an hours worth of brainless fun, this is your movie. If you're looking for something that makes sense or will scare you, look for Puppet Master 1, 2, or 3 or Demonic Toys.

Recommended for C horror movie buffs and Full Moon Fans.",1142121600,2,1312,4.476987447698745
2416488,3,B000BGR0UG,"Producer/Director Charles Band returns to his roots with Doll Graveyard.  A Puppet Master style thriller with a promising premise, but with deadly dull execution.  When young Guy (Jared Kusnitz) uncovers a Samurai doll in the backyard of his house, he also digs up the vengeful spirit of its previous owner.  A young girl accidentally killed by her abusive father.  Soon the girl's spirit is trying to possess Guy while the Samurai and its friends (an african warrior, a german soldier, and a regular baby doll) are attacking Guy's sister DeeDee (Gabrielle Lynn) and her partying friends (Anna Alicia Brock, Kristyn Green, and Scott Seymour).  Play time is over.

While Doll Graveyard has its moments, the overall quality of the movie is far removed from Full Moon's far superior Puppet Master movies.  Not helping is the clumsy pacing of the story and Band's inattention to storytelling detail.  There are plenty of moments where the characters could just leave the house, but don't.  Band's next project, the insane killer cookie movie The Gingerdead Man, also suffered from the exact same problems.  What Band needs is a director that can inject some b-movie energy into his productions, because he doesn't seem to capable of doing so.  Too bad, because the concepts are full of potential.

The disc has the usual behind the scenes documentary and a blooper real.  Both are far more entertaining than the movie itself, but neither are worth the full retail price of the disc.  This one is for Full Moon fanatics only.",1138147200,8,1520,4.956521739130435
2416489,1,B000BGR0UG,"Charles Band invites you into his Dull Graveyard...

This movie starts with a little girl playing with a bunch of dolls. She mistakenly bumps into a table and breaks a vase. Her father comes downstairs and decides to punish her by forcing her to bury her little buddies in a grave outside. She somehow trips and falls into the grave, killing herself. Dad buries the daughter with her beloved toys. Flash forward to thirty years later, a new family has moved into the house. The youngest son is a nerdy geek who likes to collect action figures. Imagine his joy at discovering a whole gaggle of antique dolls buried in his back yard! These dolls come to life and start protecting their new owner by killing everyone that ever picked on him. There are no spoilers here, I'm not giving away anything that isn't on the back of the DVD case.

Charles Band returns to what he knows best, making evil puppet horror movies. But just because this is what he knows best, doesn't mean he's any good at it. This is really just a reboot of Puppet Master and Demonic Toys with a new set of evil dolls. The production is shoddy, shot on a cheap DV camera with horrible lighting and a soundtrack that someone did on a Casio keyboard from 1982. Not to mention the fact that the puppets are the best actors in the movie.

Ever since Charles Band came out of retirement or hiding, the Blockbuster shelves have been graced with horrible Full Moon movies that are a few pegs below what they used to be. Even in his prime, Charles Band was nobody's genius, but time has definitely taken its toll. Titles like DECADENT EVIL, DOLL GRAVEYARD and THE GINGERDEAD MAN prove that you can't keep a hack director down. Band is back, folks.",1136764800,10,1707,4.5
2416490,4,B000BGR0UG,"I'll keep it short and sweet.  This movie reminded me of the early Puppet Master flicks.  Some good kills, decent storyline and acting (!).  The dolls look really great and are quite convincing.  The movie itself is short, but never really gets boring.

Puppets protect boy against bullies. The acting ranged from poor to fair. Some cute girls, one shows us her bra. The plot was dull as was the dialouge. Borders on camp. One good scene when a guy after smoking pot, drinking beer, JD and champagne tries to have a meaningful conversation with a doll. The movie needed more of that type of scene. How many dolls do you think they made with a spike on its head? The movie makes some more attempts at humor that failed with me. The delivery just wasn't there. Did you ever hear a joke told by someone who can't tell a joke, then not laugh. Then someone who can tell a joke tells the same joke right afterwards, and it is sooo funny...even when you just heard the joke moments earlier? I felt like I was listening to that first guy tell the joke.

2416512,2,B000BGR0UG,"After sitting through ""Blood Dolls"" before this film, I figured this one couldn't possibly be as bad. It may not be as bad, but it does share it's same brainless and pointless ideas with potholes and no reasoning for why the heck someone would go in that direction ways.

A young girl in 1911 is playing with her dolls, the same dolls shown on the cover and the mini-stars of the film. She is playing in the house with them and knocks over a vase with her fathers ashes. Her father then gets angry and forces her to dig a grave for the dolls and bury them. When she is done she accidentally falls in the grave herself and is now dead. Her father doesn't call for help, instead buries her and the movie cuts to 2005 to a home on the same land.

A young geek, his sister, and father live there now. While cleaning the backyard, the geek finds one of the dolls and cleans it off and adds it to his collection of action figures. That night while the father is out on a date, his sister invites some friends over, and a few boys invite themselves too. They bully the geek and break one of his action figures which sparks the doll to blink (how scary). The kid then starts to hear the dead girls voice in his head saying that the dolls are coming to help him. This is where the expected idea of what would make sense goes down-hill, as the innocent dead girl now wants to possess the geeks body and have her dolls kill everyone, which have somehow come to life for no reason other then maybe she is possessing them or something. It made no sense, and it makes even less sense later at the end of the movie (a gold watch is involved, it made no sense where it returned from, and the outcome was stupid)

The very end of the movie was a decent ending, right after the stupid ending. I mean the final 10 seconds of the film was decent. However, I still wouldn't recommend you going out of your way to see this film... even fans of Puppet Master won't accept this a same universe type of film/prequel whatever. It's not worthy, and just a complete rip-off of the dolls. One is basically Tunneler, one is Jester, ones Pinhead and the other is Leech Girl, all with a few altered changes, but none the less, they look horrible, hardly do much in the movie but bite and stab eyeballs, and leave you with a feeling of ""Puppet Master Wanna-be"". If Dark Moon want to make Doll movies like this, then keep doing Puppet Master sequels that have nothing to do with the last movie, and stop trying to reinvent it even cheaper, and more poorly thought out.",1329177600,,2534,4.275
2416513,3,B000BGR0UG,"Doll Graveyard is a decent Full Moon offering, not quite as good as Full Moon's Demonic Toys or Puppet Master. But it is better than all of the sequels to those two classics. It's got a few funny scenes, courtesy of the douchebag character named Ritchie. And it has some good gore on display. This is really like a teen slasher film, only with dolls doing the killing instead of a homicidal maniac. See it if you're a Full Moon fan or a fan of killer doll flicks.",1321142400,,463,4.2727272727272725
2416514,5,B000BGR0UG,"This movie isn't meant to be taken seriously, it's meant to be taken lightly. If you are coming for a gorefest and something that will actually scare you, this isn't the movie for you. If you are looking for so cheesy it's good and will make you laugh, then this is for you. Just don't take it too seriously and you won't be disappointed.",1318723200,,338,4.296875
2416515,2,B000BGR0UG,"If you're a fan of Full Moon then you already know they love to indulge is murderous puppets. They started it off with Puppet Master released in 1989 and have made many follows ups to the series along with some other independent puppet flicks. Of course with there ultra low budget they are usually very entertaining as the special effects team pulls out all the stops. Doll Graveyard was the exact opposite. Despite my lover for low budget horror this one was really dull.

The film starts with a flashback to 1905 with a young girl named Sophia. She is playing with a few handmade dolls when she accidentally knocks over a vase in the house causing it to shatter. Her father becomes enraged and forces her to bury the dolls in the backyard. Somehow she falls in the tiny hole and breaks her neck. Her Dad then does the responsible thing and decides to bury her. Why bother taking her to the doctor? I guess this guy wouldn't be nominated parent of the year. Now flash forward to present day as the Fillbrook family moves into the same house and the young son Guy uncovers the dolls in the backyard. Since he has no friends he takes the dolls in as his friends and they come to life. After that happens the dolls stick up for him and take out a few bullies over the house for a very lame party his sister's throwing.

As much as I wanted to I just didn't enjoy Doll Graveyard. I really tried to get into it and find some laughs but couldn't get past the boredom. A couple of the dolls were pretty interesting looking, especially the voodoo looking one with the bone through his nose. I'm a fan of the puppet flick Charles Band is behind and hope they can get back on track to what they used to be. So I really can't recommend this one even for the avid b horror lover.",1247184000,,1769,4.3093093093093096
2416516,2,B000BGR0UG,"Doll Graveyard is part of the Full Moon double feature this evening. Being that these films barely run over an hour will allow you to pull out 2 flicks in one day if you dare to spend your time that way. Luckily for b we are dedicated and love it enough to do just that. As we've said before Full Moon pictures are no walk in the park if you're looking for anything legitimate. There is no chance any of these movies take more then a week to film, edit, and get out on the shelf. This one may have only take 3 days which would at least explain a lot of what was going on.

We start of in 1911 with a young girl Sophia as she plays with some dolls. She winds up breaking one and her old man freaks out. He makes her go out back and bury the dolls despite her poorly acted pleas. Somehow the little girl winds up falling back into the 2ft ditch she dug and dies. And like any normal father he skips over the thought of getting her some medical attention and buries her with the toys. Hey it's b, these things are going to happen.

Flash forward to present day where we are graced with a total dutch named Guy who collects action figures. He's outside doing some yard work where he uncovers the toys and brings them in the house. He is immediately mocked by her older sister reminding him what a tool is and always will be. While she busts his onions their father is getting ready for a date and leaves the kids home for sis to throw a party. A couple jocks come over a smack Guy around unleashing the fury of his newly found toys. From here on the film gets beyond confusing so you have no choice but to roll with it. Long story short Guy becomes possesed by the little girl, some dead bodies pile up, and nothing is explained. No logic, no reason, it had the blackest eyes...the devils eyes.

Now for Sid, who been subjected to years of Full Moon's b-ness, this way was really bad. It was potentially the worst we've ever seen them do which is really saying a lot. It's kind of like they wanted to relive another puppet master idea but put in even less of a budget and only finished about 1/4 of the script before they started shooting. If you have the chance don't even bother with this one. It didn't even have any laughs.",1239062400,,2223,4.165116279069768

It's funny and stupid, but it's just a good time. Definitely worth a look for horror buffs. I'd give it a C overall, even though it's a D list movie, because it was just a really fun ride and there were some genuinely entertaining moments. It's not at all scary or suspenseful, but it will definitely keep you glued to your seat for the predictable finale!",1218499200,,527,4.28

It's okay - I won't watch it again - the storyline had more potential than the actual film showed.",1215820800,,395,3.9873417721518987
2416520,4,B000BGR0UG,"Some folks just aren't going to buy into the idea of little dolls/action figures coming to life and killing people, even when all the fun comes direct to DVD from the same guys who gave the world The Puppetmaster, but I call it grand entertainment - as long as the kills are sufficiently gruesome and numerous.  Demonic doll fans everywhere should be excited by the news that Fool Moon and Charles Band, the famed low-budget director and MonsterBra inventor who has killed enough characters with dolls over the course of his career to make Chuckie feel like a demonic beginner, are back - and they're not here to put on any fancy little tea parties.

Doll Graveyard is a far from perfect little horror film, but I enjoyed the heck out of it.  It's really all about the dolls, man.  What a quartet of doom: a Samurai warrior (with sword); a pre-WWI German soldier (with gun and really pointy helmet) I affectionately call the Kaiser; ""Ooga Booga,"" a spear-wielding African witch doctor; and a cute little china doll with quite a mouth on her.  What could inspire this motley crew of toys to animate themselves with a lust for blood, you ask?  Well, how about being buried since 1911 alongside their owner, a cute little girl who more than paid the price for breaking one of daddy's vases while playing?  If I were buried and forgotten for 94 years, I'd be pretty grouchy, too.

We have the deadly dolls, so all we need now are some horror film staples: hot chicks - check; a likeable geek who is always being picked on - check; jerk jocks who all but beg to be killed - check; a little blood and gore - check.  There's no nudity on the part of the aforementioned hot chicks, but I guess you can't have everything.  The story couldn't be any simpler, really.  Jared Kusnitz plays Guy, a geeky freshman who's into action figures and irritating his older sister, Deedee (Gabrielle Lynn).  Stuck with babysitting Guy while their dad is out on a hot date, Deedee invites girlfriends Olivia (Kristyn Green), a ditzy blonde always in search of a good time, and Terri (Anna Alicia Brock), who's actually quite nice and almost sensible, over to enjoy some alcohol and weed.  Naturally, a couple of young jocks show up to paw at the womenfolk and tyrannize young Guy, thus creating the perfect conditions for a devil doll bloodbath.

Earlier that day, Guy had dug up a neat old samurai doll in the backyard.  Now, the other buried dolls and the spirit of Sofia, the unfortunate little girl from 1911, emerge from the hole as well.  As Sofia begins the process of possessing Guy's body, the dolls seek vengeance on those who would hurt him/her.  I thought the death scenes were really quite satisfying in detail and execution - not as gory as I would have liked, but bloody nonetheless.  The special effects guys did a great job with the little killers - nothing fancy, just some blinking, simple movements and efficient killing strokes.  What truly excited me, however, was the fact that the dolls seemed to be taking orders from me.  Time and again, they attacked in just the way I wanted them to - and I was rather specific in some of my requests.

The film whizzes by in little more than an hour (with the last ten of its seventy-two minutes consisting of some extremely slow-moving end credits) - which has its good and its bad sides.  On the good side, it helps distract the viewer from some of the film's inconsistencies - why, for instance, did no one in the house ever think of actually turning tail and escaping through the door?  And why, assuming there's at least one phone in the house, do the girls only scramble for a missing cell phone in the midst of their crisis?  On the bad side, the film is just way too freakin' short.  By the time the dolls go on the rampage, you've only got a half hour left in the whole movie.  Couldn't they have thrown in a couple more teenagers to kill or something?  They had a good thing going here, so why stop at just an hour?  Additionally, the whole possession thing between Guy and Sofia could have used some more work, and any impact the last shot might have is negated by the viewer's sudden astonishment upon realizing the film is actually over already.

I have a feeling that viewer response to this film will vary considerably - and you probably already know if you're the type of person who would enjoy watching dolls come to life and start killing people.  I really enjoyed Doll Graveyard, but I must admit that the dolls really aren't all that scary, the plot would leak in several places if you filled it with water, and the whole thing really is predictable from start to finish.  You don't come to Doll Graveyard to be stimulated intellectually, though; you come to see dolls kill people, and the movie definitely succeeds in that department.",1155081600,4,4793,4.5642523364485985

8086587,3,B000BGR0UG,"Charles Band has built an empire on dolls and puppets, so when I found out he was the mastermind behind the 2005 film DOLL GRAVEYARD, I wasn't a bit surprised.  My only concern was that it would be too similar to the PUPPET MASTER movies and feel like Band was just repeating himself once again.  It basically was.  I mean, the premise of the movie is that a handful of evil dolls have come to life and kill everyone in the house.

The actual story is more complicated than that.  It starts in 1905 with 12-year-old Sophia playing with her dolls in the foyer.  Theres the baby doll, the samurai, the German soldier and the African tribal warrior.  She accidentally bumps a table, which breaks a vase, which sends her father down the stairs to punish her.  Hes told her countless times not to play out here, but shes just a slow-witted child and needs to be taught a lesson.  That lesson, her father decides, will be that she has to dig a hole for her dolls, then bury them in it.  Except when Sophia tries to get out of the hole, she slips, cracks her head and dies.  Her father, seeing no one around, decides to cover up the accident by burying his daughter along with her dolls.

Cut to 100 years later and the Fillbrook family--dad, DeeDee and Guy--are living in the house formerly occupied by Sophia and her abusive father.  Guy is a collector of classic action figures, and when he finds a cool samurai doll buried in the back yard, he takes it inside and cleans it up to add it to his display case.

That night dad has a date, so DeeDee decides to invite a couple of girlfriends from school over.  One of the girls, the slutty Olivia, mentions the party to DeeDees boyfriend and another boy, and they crash the party.  After tying up Guy in his bedroom so he cant interfere.

This doesnt sit well with the samurai, or any of the other dolls, which have also emerged from their century-long nap underground.  The boys are taken out, then the dolls start to go after the girls.  Guy tells them to stop, but his body is being taken over by the spirit of Sophia who wants revenge for having been hurt a century earlier.

Charles Band directed the movie and came up with the story, with the script being written by August White, who would go on to pen other Band classics like THE GINGERDEAD MAN, EVIL BONG, EVIL BONG II: King Bong, EVIL BONG 3-D: The Wrath of Bong,  and GINGERDEAD MAN VS. EVIL BONG.

The idea is a pretty simple one and, unfortunately, its handled simply too--too simply, if you ask me.  The movie is 71 minutes, and a full 9 of those are spent on the end credits.  Weve got a cast of 6 main characters, not counting the Fillbrooks father--three girls, two high school jocks, and high school freshman Guy Fillbrook (none of the actors are anyone youll recognize from anything else).  There are so many opportunities for awesome kills here, but--SPOILER: only the two jocks get it, and everyone else lives.  WHAT?  Sure, they're cut up and one is mutilated pretty badly, but at the end they're all still standing, except for the jocks.

And the climax comes and goes with barely a whimper, impeded by some pretty weak acting.

Everything about this movie screams made in a week, although Im sure it took longer than that.  But it couldn't have been much longer.  The story feels rushed, the acting feels rushed, the production feels rushed for sure.  Its not a terrible movie, but with, what, 10 PUPPER MASTERS movies as well as a plethora of other killer doll movies, just from Charles Band alone, theres really nothing new here that sets this one above the rest.

Id say pass on this one and stick with the PUPPER MASTERS movies.  I mean, if you HAVE to see a killer doll movie, those are just as good as anything else in the genre, and they have the added bonus of not being over before theyve even had a chance to really begin.  DOLL GRAVEYARD hinders itself by sacrificing suspense and drama in favor of a shorter running time, leaving the audience, in the end, feeling somewhat cheated.  At least thats how I saw it.",1384819200,,4041,4.442934782608695

DOLL GRAVEYARD is one of them.

This is a real low-budget affair, with a real basic horror story. Six teenagers (2 Bully Jocks, 2 Slutty Girls, 1 Nerdy Boy, 1 Nerdy Girl) party at a house (the film's sole location). Drinking, pot-smoking, sex, bullying of Nerdy Boy, etc. ensue. The usual stuff.

The party-goers are attacked by four creepy dolls (because the dolls are possessed by a dead girl). Some party-goers die, some survive. What you'd expect.

My DVD player says this film is 71 minutes long, but the end credits begin at 62 minutes. Take away the opening credits, and this film is UNDER an hour long.

The killings don't start until 35 minutes into the film. At that point there's only 26 minutes left before we roll end credits. So you're looking at 26 minutes of horror.

Tepid horror, at that. Not many deaths. Even then, you don't always see it. For instance, one doll gores a Jock's private parts -- but the goring occurs off-screen. All you see is blood splattering the Jock's screaming face.

While the actors do a serviceable job, they're bland, without any charisma or screen presence. A forgettable cast, as is the story and film itself.",1383523200,,1425,5.255506607929515
