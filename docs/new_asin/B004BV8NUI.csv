4320564,1,B004BV8NUI,"The best part of this movie is the tittle. I'm not kidding. Actually at some point in the first half hour or so the two main girls suddenly get in a girlie catfight scene rip off each others tops.
This and a short part at the end is all the nudity you will see. However the eye candy so to speak are quite large and nice to look at. And as a bonus for sitting through this crap or for those of you who have figured out how to work the fast forward button, you get to see those lovely breasts getting blood sprayed all over them for a good minute or so. Which is great in that sex and death kinda way. (I guess)
The acting although not in english language just looked kinda sad and the fight scenes were kinda low budgety. You wouldn't be missing as much as the title implies if you never see this movie.
On the other hand try Tokyo Gore Police it's significantly better than this.",1324252800,4,880,4.092485549132948
4320565,4,B004BV8NUI,"After reading the title I had no interest in watching this film, it sounded like....well you know what it sounds like, but after reading reviews on other sites people seemed to like it. There were several fighting scenes and some funny moments. For some reason I love asian girls reactions to everything, it's funny, anyway its not a bad movie at all. Despite who stars in it there is no sex at all thank goodness, that would have ruined the movie. I watched it with english subtitles so I can't comment on the acting.

I will not keep it in my collection only because I have to read subtitles everytime I watch it, but if i knew japanese Its a keeper.",1300147200,4,652,4.3884297520661155

4320573,3,B004BV8NUI,"Hey all, back with YET another zombie film.  Maybe this one will have its own unique spin.  Instead of that tired lumbering zombie of Romero years, this will be mildly intelligent and sentient flesh eaters.  Doomed to roam a world where no one understands their plight, hopes and dreams.  So grab your clear heels, draw up your g-string and prepare of swirling and twirling.  This is Jugs &Ghouls...er...I mean Big Tits Zombie.

Spoilers dig strippers...it's true...look it up.

Soft corn pornographer/writer Takao Nakano (Sumo Vixen, Sexual Parasite and Hot Step Jump!) decided to branch out in his...particular genre of horror eroticism and delve into the realm of zombies.  Now you Nakano fans must be asking, ""But Jake how will he achieve the proper exploitation of actresses and insure us nudity?""  Well as luck would have it he makes the girls fending off the legions of the undead, strippers.  Yeah breaking some new unfettered ground there let me tell you.  This manga (Japanese comic book for those of you not in the knowing) influenced film was based on Rei Mikamoto's Kyonyu-Dragon.  Our story opens with a barely dressed stripper lightly dribbled with blood.  I think it must have been a pen cap full sprinkled on.  As she attempts to clean her ample cleavage off, three shambling ghouls appear with patented Walking Dead moans.  Another girl with a cowgirl outfit and chainsaw, Lena (Adult actress Sola Aoi) splits one down the middle in true Tokyo Gore Police fashion with blood sprinklers at the ready.  She proceeds to have technical difficulties but her friend got her second wind, proceeds to go sickhouse on the lot with a katana.  Joining back in the fray, Lena goes back to back with Ginko (Risa Kasumi of Tokyo Girls 2: Supervixens and Subete no onna ni uso ga aru)

A few technical critiques I have offhand.  The feel of the film is to give the implied Grindhouse standing.  Lower budget and grainy film stock to give it that patented 1960's exploitation feel and overall it is decent but the combo of CGI blood splatter, squibbed gel blood packs as well as the more viscous sprays with a under cranked fast paced film may be a bit hard on the photophobic eyes.  Takano is really going for the live anime standing so that means absurd violence, twisting the laws of gravity and physics with a dash of what the hell.  Lucky me I got to endure the 3D version and yes we are talking old school red and blue glasses rather than your polarized version of current.  Migraine sufferers you may want to skip this film but of course the title didn't shoo you away I guess you deserve your fate.

This is ridiculous violence, caricatures of working girls and an amusing narrative through this bloodbath.  Mindless hack and slash for all to enjoy and yes boys ample amounts of nudity so you are fully covered. So have at it folks.  I'm going to crack up a Doctor Who book.",1351728000,2,2884,4.695219123505976
4320574,4,B004BV8NUI,"[BIG TITS ZOMBIE (AKA `Kyonyu Doragon: Onsen  Zonbi VS Storippaa') - 2010 - Widescreen - directed by Takao Nakano] ""They Have Boobs To Die For!"" ""Deadly D Cups!! A Bloody Armageddon Has Begun!"" So reads the poster for this hyper-violent though highly entertaining excursion into 'Exploit-Asian', as I like to refer to these flicks. For fans of arterial bloodbaths, walking undead, sexy and underdressed babes you actually want to see naked, bloody and brutally kicking ass simultaneously, this one's a no brainer. No one else should be stepping up to this plate. Still interested? Then read on.

For starters, it stars Sola Aoi, known for her expansive resume in Exploit-Asian films and mighty curves, along with Risa Kasumi, who starred in 'Tokyo Train Girls 2', my personal favorite of the four entries in this series (read my reviews for all of 'em), an incredibly sexy bombshell - not one of those undernourished 'cute' Asian leads prevalent in so many films like this - and these gals are dressed in hot pants, thigh-high boots, skimpy black leather jackets and gunbelts, or fringed suede jackets, cowboy boots and halter tops, armed with samurai swords, semi-automatic artillery and enormous chainsaws to do battle with the undead - have I got your attention yet? I thought so. The other girls are also very easy on the eyes and dressed in fashion-forward fetish-stripper styles of garments (the 'naughty maid' and punk goth look), so variety is the spice of life when it comes to mowing down a sluggish, motley army of zombies for their self-preservation and our voyeuristic amusement. It's the simple things in life that are the most rewarding sometimes...

Oh yeah, the plot - I almost forgot, not that it truly matters, 'cause most of you have already hit the 'Buy It Now' button or ceased reading altogether. Rena (Sola Aoi) just got back from a stripping gig in Mexico and her sleazy agent sends her on a dubious job at a far-off hot spring resort. When she arrives, the place is no kind of resort and is nearly deserted. There's almost no one in the audience either; the strippers practically outnumber the patrons, and with good reason. There she meets Ginko (Risa Kasumi), Maria (Mari Sakurai), Nene (Tamayo) and Dana (Io Aikawa), who are all bored senseless and bicker like foul-mouthed alleycats while preening and prancing for our uncultured edification. Turns out there's a Hellmouth of sorts in the basement, and one of the girls summons up a demon, the townsfolk become zombies and it's time for an abattoir anatomy class with wonderful, wicked weaponry and scantily-clad sexy superbabes. There's not an abundance of nudity for a flick with this title (though the women are all natural, which was a relief for me), but the oversaturation of hyperviolence coupled with the scorching chicks keeps boredom at bay and makes for some inspired drinking games while watching with like-minded brethren.

I don't know why it's taken so long to get a stateside release (I got a copy of this film almost a year and a half ago on ebay), but for fans of psychotic offerings like 'Machine Girl', 'Tokyo Gore Police', 'Zombie Hunter Rika', 'Robo Geisha', 'Vampire Girl vs. Frankenstein Girl', 'Onechanbara', 'Attack Girls Swim Team vs. The Undead' etc. it's mandatory viewing. It's not quite as over the top as some of those and, like those films, suffers from a lack of budget for special effects (remember, it's not a Romero flick, it's low budget indie exploitation) yet it's a kindred cousin nonetheless. And way better than some I just mentioned too. Available in 2D and 3D viewing versions, but no blu ray as of this date.

When you're in the mood to kick back, turn your brain off to conserve energy, watch dangerous darlings kick the bejeezus out of hordes of silly-looking zombies while lecherously leering over the female form and enjoying a few good laughs and libation, you could do a lot worse than 'BTZ'. Is that an endorsement? Damn right it is...3 and 1/2 to 4 stars depending on your mood and mindset.",1349913600,5,4024,4.87719298245614
4320575,4,B004BV8NUI,"EDIT*
THIS REVIEW WAS ORIGINALLY FOR THE PAL RELEASE (AT THE TIME ONLY) VERSION ON THIS MOVIE.
HOW IT ENDED UP HERE IN THE NEW REGION 1 VERSION IS WELL BEYOND ME...

In a word...FUN!
Not much else to it, this is not a true splatterfest film.
Good looking japanese softcore models, cleverly written dialog,
ultra cheap zombie costumes + cherry juice = Great beer movie!

There is no softcore scenes featured unlike Nihombie 2.
The girls do loose their tops in a few scenes, luckily they
have a bit of charisma to back them up + swords N chainsaws!

My fav girl is the ultra ditzy money grubber that while
clearly japanese...plays a foreigner...lol
The main lead holds her own, and has a smart mouth
more akin to Hong kong sassiness than typical japanese
girls.

By the way this is for PAL region only no USA release.
So either you watch on your PC using VLC player or
one of those awsome hard to find region free DVD players.",1346284800,5,924,4.41764705882353

However in the 2D version the picture is very dark in some scenes, hallway, office and a couple other places(even with the brightness at max). There are also a lot of lines through it like an old film that has seen better days, I'm not really sure if that's deliberate or not, there's not much of it so it's not as annoying as 'Planet Terror' was.

8422364,1,B004BV8NUI,"I think it's unconscionable that ""Schindler's List"" has been remade for the adolescent male market in this manner. To take Spielberg's brilliant and deeply moving historical drama and fill it with strippers cavorting in their underwear -- in six instances involving an actress without her top, which equals exactly a dozen separate breast exposures -- should be considered an act of war on morality itself. I am shocked and sickened each time I screen this outrage in the privacy of my home. How can the public stand for being subjected to this repulsive and nauseating product?",1463529600,,578,5.03125
8422365,4,B004BV8NUI,"If you like T&A with your gore, the Japanese filmmakers take a back seat to no one and this is another prime example. In recent years, most of the sexy actresses appearing in these gems have been chosen from from the large talent pool of current and former adult video and gravure idols Japan has to offer. In this one, the ladies, headed by JAV icon Sora Aoi with fellow AV girls Risa Kasumi, and Mari Sakuraias in supporting roles, are dancers who accept an engagement at the Paradise Ikagawa Theater. That soon leads to them working at a local spa, where the girls can make better money, but, of course, do more than just dance there. One evening after a ""performance,"" while the ladies are relaxing in their shared dressing room, one of them decides to venture down in the basement in hopes of finding some hidden riches. She does, but she also stirs up a hoard of zombies who respond like hornets after their nest had been treated like a pi&ntilde;ata. The flesh-eaters then proceed to devour her and then search for more, since she was merely an appetizer, and away we go. A couple of the dancers wind up joining the other side, but Sora battles the zombies to the end, displaying a few decent martial arts moves while doing so. The blood and splatter are abundant, the special effects are intentionally laughable, and the ladies show some genuine acting skills in this one, if not much skin ....but a simple Google search of any of their names will yield plenty of that.",1461628800,,1477,4.556390977443609

8422370,2,B004BV8NUI,"Big Tits Zombies (2010)
 Ok, I admit it, the title intrigued me so I watched this campy Japanese Zombie flick.  Sometimes a catchy title will reveal a low budget gem, a film made with imagination and style but not much money.  This time we have a catchy title revealing a poorly made Zombie flick and one made with little imagination or style.  The actresses are all Japanese so even the title is bogus.  The tits would only be called big if our frame of reference is the typically small breasted Asian young ladies.  Average sized tits would be a better title, or at least more honest.
 Lets see, what didn't we like?  The fight scenes are terrible, among the very worst we have ever seen.  Sometimes the Zombies actually begin to fall before one of the strippers swings a pipe or a Samurai sword at them.  The same Zombies are used in every shot, even after they have been dispatched by the heroines.  The story line breaks down into gibberish after a while, not uncommon as we have seen elsewhere.  The acting is done in Japanese so we don't actually know what the actresses are saying.  The main characters seem to be OK but most of the supporting cast do not seem to be actual actors.  More likely to be friends of the producer or locals swept up for the thrill of being in a movie.
 Remember Mystery Science Theater 2000?  The sound track in English is modeled on that kind of humor.  But there are no cute robots commenting on the film, the dubbed in dialog just takes on that kind of non-serious tone.  The actors are made to say disparaging things about the movie while making the movie.  I didn't like that very much.  Perhaps the people who put in the English language tracks did not have a translation of the original script.
 The story-before it breaks down-has a band of exotic dancers called to a run down resort to entertain tourists.  Instead they stumble into an occult generated Zombie outbreak.
 The young girl dressed like Sailor Moon and the use of Samurai swords reminded me a tiny bit of Bikini Samurai Squad which I liked much better.  The Zombies are slow movers most of the time, except when they move fast-a bad check mark for the movie.  Sometimes a Zombie talks, but not at other times, another bad check mark.  The Zombies are unleashed by reading from a tome of forgotten lore, which is OK but at the end a demon comes up from another movie set to drag the villain to Hell and talks about being from anther movie to the audience.  Big bad check mark.
 No one over the age of nine will enjoy this film and no one of that age should see it.  Not rated but it should hold an R for total nudity, fire issuing from a Zombie stripper's most precious place, occasional prolonged shots of attractive young women going topless for no particular reason, graphic gut gobbling and really very crude comments by the cast about each others anatomical features.
 The film lasts only one hour and 13 minutes.  This one brain flick wasted my time in-spite of the great title.  Do not waste your time.
 In the credits a voice over comes on, supposedly the director, that says I told you I could make a Zombie movie in three hours.  Maybe so but we want good Zombie movies not quick ones.",1420588800,,3201,4.452667814113597
