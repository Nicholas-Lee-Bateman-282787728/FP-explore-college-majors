4311199,3,B004AUCCZ2,"I am so glad to hear from other reviewers who express longing to
see ""Mother Love"" --I have been patiently waiting for this to be re
leased, and was hoping this collection would finally satisfy.  I
will wait and hope!",1352505600,,217,4.425
4311200,1,B004AUCCZ2,"I felt that this dvd did not contain her best works.  Very disappointed it did not contain ""Mother Love"" which I consider
one of her best performances for BbC TV.",1330646400,30,162,4.4
4311201,5,B004AUCCZ2,"This is a must for Diana Rigg fans. Outside of the Avengers TV series Dame Diana has done a lot of theater but a minimum of cinema and TV. This set is
the usual BBC quality and presents Dame Diana in a variety of roles plus the delightful Mrs. Bradley series.",1317513600,25,259,4.098039215686274
4311202,4,B004AUCCZ2,"Gosh - how I wish this collection would have been without 'The Mrs. Bradley Mysteries' as this already has been released separately. Instead BBC should have included 'Mother Love' which is yet to see the light of day -at least officially.
Still there's enough included here for me to obtain this collection of dvd's anyway, but with 'Mother Love' I would have given it a full set of stars.",1312848000,64,389,4.6521739130434785

4311206,5,B004AUCCZ2,"Mrs Bradley series very good. Earlier BBC a bit dated, looked like filler.",1495152000,,74,4.769230769230769
4311207,5,B004AUCCZ2,a must for the library filled with gems I had not seen before,1489795200,,61,3.769230769230769
4311208,5,B004AUCCZ2,"British movies and tv programming are the buzz. They make great mysteries and movies, this is. Great to watch,",1484956800,,110,4.842105263157895
4311209,1,B004AUCCZ2,"I like Diana Rigg, but she was crummy in these episodes.",1484006400,,56,4.181818181818182
4311210,4,B004AUCCZ2,I liked the last 2 mystries.,1482796800,,28,3.8333333333333335
4311211,4,B004AUCCZ2,We bought this solely for the Mrs. Bradley mysteries.  We enjoyed those; not so much the other movies on these disks.,1482710400,5,117,4.571428571428571
4311212,5,B004AUCCZ2,wonderful,1481414400,,9,9.0
4311213,4,B004AUCCZ2,Have seen only the first segment of Mrs. Bradley's Mysteries - the reason I ordered the set.  The friend I shared it with and I enjoyed it.,1477094400,,139,4.148148148148148
4311214,5,B004AUCCZ2,loved it,1475193600,,8,3.5
4311215,2,B004AUCCZ2,"The DVD did not work very well.  After I finished viewing one mystery, I was unable to see the second one.  The DVD kept going back to the first one.  Very frustrating.  I even removed the disk from the player and tried it over again.  I only could get the first mystery.  What I saw I liked but I've yet to see the second episode.",1473120000,3,331,4.015384615384615
4311216,5,B004AUCCZ2,"Wonderful series. Have thoroughly enjoyed watching this, ended far too quickly",1472947200,,78,6.181818181818182

4311218,4,B004AUCCZ2,"I bought this for the Mrs. Bradley mysteries, which are all included. Fun, interesting mysteries set in the 1920's. I will probably get around to viewing the other material later. All in all a good collection.",1468454400,5,209,4.833333333333333
4311219,4,B004AUCCZ2,"I love Diana Rigg and enjoyed this but they're not my favorite shows, unfortunately.",1462233600,,84,5.071428571428571
4311220,5,B004AUCCZ2,Diana Rigg at her best. Great performance and excellent plot.,1459555200,,61,5.2
4311221,5,B004AUCCZ2,Love. Love. Love,1456876800,,16,4.666666666666667
4311222,5,B004AUCCZ2,There's nothing like a Dame Diana.,1447891200,,34,4.833333333333333
4311223,2,B004AUCCZ2,Not funny and too much sex and swearing for me.,1444003200,,47,3.8
4311224,4,B004AUCCZ2,The set opens with several comedy skits that are about 30 minutes each.  They are OK but I thought the best part about them was seeing the lovely Diana Rigg again.  Then there was a rather depressing story about a couple whose crippled son dies.  The crown of this set is the 5 mystery stories that are done with some tongue in cheek humor that is absolutely wonderful.  Kind of like a lighthearted Murder She Wrote and perhaps where the idea for the Miss Fisher Murder Mysteries came from.,1443225600,16,490,4.47191011235955
4311225,5,B004AUCCZ2,Diana Rigg is a legend in BBC female crime solvers. Wanted to have the DVD to see her again in her prime.,1438819200,,105,3.8181818181818183
4311226,5,B004AUCCZ2,She has always been one of my favorite actors.,1426896000,,46,4.222222222222222
4311227,1,B004AUCCZ2,Package came heavily damaged.,1424736000,,29,6.5
4311228,3,B004AUCCZ2,I thought this stuff was pretty mediocre.  I was expecting Avengers-quality entertainment.,1423267200,,90,6.5
4311229,3,B004AUCCZ2,"Being a fan of Diana Rigg as Mrs. Peel and also enjoying the Miss Fisher Murder Mysteries also set in the 1920's I had high hopes for Mrs. Bradley.  Guess I just couldn't warm up to that character as it was portrayed. Ms. Rigg came off as extremely imperious and unlikable although I enjoyed George, her chauffer and confident played by Neil Dudgeon. The 1920's theme and costumes made it more watchable for me. As an actress, Diana Rigg is so versatile, and the three early short stories were amusing and well done. The ""Unexplained Laughter"" episode was very strange and although I didn't really enjoy it, found it to be rather intriguing.  Loved her as Mrs. Peel, not so much as Mrs. Bradley. Maybe if I rewatch some episodes, I will get more out of them.",1421884800,3,758,4.525547445255475
4311230,4,B004AUCCZ2,Good addition to my English collection,1420416000,,38,5.5

4311232,5,B004AUCCZ2,I just wanted this for the Mrs. Bradley Mysteries which I really enjoyed.,1418601600,,73,4.6923076923076925
4311233,5,B004AUCCZ2,"Diana Rigg is my favorite actress since I saw an episode of ""The Avengers"" many, many years ago. The only disadvantage with this box is that ""Mother Love"" (1992) is missing. And I regret that the interview only relates to the films in this box. Certainly Dame Diana could tell much more - about ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" for instance. But I hope I will see (and hear) this another day...",1415750400,2,395,4.5
4311234,5,B004AUCCZ2,"great, great  Ms. Rigg!!! wish there were more episodes!!",1412726400,,57,5.333333333333333
4311235,5,B004AUCCZ2,Movie arrived in excellent condition.  Thanks.,1409961600,,46,6.666666666666667
4311236,5,B004AUCCZ2,DVD and delivery are perfect.,1408233600,,29,5.0
4311237,5,B004AUCCZ2,"I initially bought the set for the Mrs. Bradley mysteries (which were sadly discontinued).  She is absolutely perfect in this role and Neil Dudgeon as her chauffeur, is a hoot.

I admire Diana Rigg for having moved from her days as Emma Peale, to a woman of a maturity and doing it splendidly!  Some of the other offerings on the CD's are interesting, and she shows a wide variety of creative acting.  It was well worth the money to watch Dame Diane glide across the screen in some very unusual outfits.",1401235200,9,503,4.4945054945054945
4311238,5,B004AUCCZ2,"The Mrs Bradley mysteries were the reason I looked, but there is so much more in this bargain set!  Typical BBC quality roductions of Diana Rigg's masterful performances, many hours of enjoyment and entertainment, very pleased with all aspects of this purchase!",1396310400,22,261,5.214285714285714
4311239,3,B004AUCCZ2,Would someone please make Mother Love available?  It is not in this collection.  I have been waiting for years to see it again,1396051200,,126,4.434782608695652
4311240,2,B004AUCCZ2,"I ordered this for a friend. It came up when I put in ""Mother Love"" (which is what we wanted) and Mother Love is not on this. Very disappointing.",1377993600,3,145,4.0344827586206895
4311241,4,B004AUCCZ2,This was a good mix of Diana Riggs work. Didn't know she was so versatile before watching it. I have a greater appreciation for her acting.,1364601600,9,139,4.384615384615385
4311242,5,B004AUCCZ2,This shows the wide range of Dame Diana Riggs talents. I recommend it for any fan of good British acting.,1363046400,3,105,4.3
8420881,5,B004AUCCZ2,"This was a great bargain considering that the set with just the Mrs. Bradley Mysteries was slightly costlier. Having said that, I have watched and enjoyed all the Mrs. Bradley episodes. I am a fan of Midsomer Murders so watching actor who is the latest Barnaby as her chauffeur was great fun. Nice set to add to my collection.",1520899200,,326,4.5423728813559325
8420882,5,B004AUCCZ2,"Highly recommend this BBC collection.  Diana Rigg is incredible in each of the roles she plays!  Her ""Avengers"" (late 1960s) Emma Peal humor shines through in so much of what one sees in this collection of really good entertainment.  The Ms. Bradley series, although only six episodes, is outstanding, and alone, is worth the price.  Per another reviewer's suggestion, skip the DVD with only the Ms. Bradley series and get this grouping of outstanding offerings.  The ""look back"" finale in this collection is wonderful.",1520467200,4,519,5.130952380952381
8420883,4,B004AUCCZ2,"not as happy with this as we had hoped. loved the Mrs Bradley series, though",1513209600,,76,4.133333333333334
8420884,5,B004AUCCZ2,Love Dinna Rigg. Realy enjoyed.,1509840000,,31,5.4

8420887,5,B004AUCCZ2,Funny and entertaining! We love the one-liners that Diane Rigg delivers so expertly.,1502496000,,84,5.538461538461538
8420888,3,B004AUCCZ2,"Always a fan of Diana Rigg.  I like the Mrs Bradley episodes (the few that there are), but the rest of the DVDs are not so good.  Still, price was right.",1499212800,,153,3.903225806451613
8420889,5,B004AUCCZ2,Great collection...got this mostly for Mrs. Bradley mysteries which are delightful.,1498694400,,83,6.636363636363637
8420890,1,B004AUCCZ2,"I was looking for the BBC movie ""Motherlove"" since the comments looked like it would be on this DVD. It is not, so I am quite disappointed. Does anyone know how/where to find ""Motherlove""?",1498435200,,188,4.5588235294117645
