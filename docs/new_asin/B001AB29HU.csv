8276567,4,B001AB29HU,"I did find this to be a very interesting DVD. The technical production of this presentation leaves room for improvement, which is why I gave it 4 stars. But it remains very watchable and it is filled with a lot of information, much (most? all?) of which may also be found in his book (""The Reconnection""). So for anyone who has read his book, or attended one of his seminars, there will be no new material presented. However, we all take in information in a variety of modalities, and some may enjoy actually seeing/listening to Dr. Pearl.

Having now seen him give a live presentation -- which I also recommend -- I must say he is much more dynamic in person. In that sense the DVD gives the wrong impression, which I suspect is largely a result of the sound leveling.

In the interests of transparency, I should note that I have met Dr. Pearl, ""forced"" him to shake my hand, and completed levels I, II, and III of his training. And while I don't fully understand what is happening or how it is happening, that something is in fact happening is incontrovertible. I have experienced it. And I am now a Reconnective Healing Practitioner.",1257638400,21,1136,4.536585365853658
8276568,1,B001AB29HU,Mr. Pearl leaves me jaw dropped and breathless as I'm still waiting to figure out why I spent any money hoping to get any pertinent and useful information. He rambles. I could watch Seinfeld if all I wanted was dry wit and flaky humor. Thoroughly disappointed with this video. Zero stars....Black Hole of non-information!,1254873600,12,321,4.962962962962963
8276569,4,B001AB29HU,"First of all, I think Dr. Eric Pearl is amazing. He was great in this DVD as he tells an audience the story of ""Reconnective Healing"" and how he got into it.

I just wish that there would have been some graphics to support his credibility.
