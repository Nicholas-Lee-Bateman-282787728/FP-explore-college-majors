The scenery of the few places they went is incredibly beautiful--I would have happily spent an hour just looking at it. They include a selection of paintings they did on site, which are all interesting and some are really nice. Obviously they went to a lot more sites than are in the video, as shown by the number and variety of paintings. I'm a huge fan of the Group of Seven, Tom Thompson, and Emily Carr, and I have been wishing there were ANY kind of video about them and their work. This video is a great idea, but 15 minutes--actually it's less than 13 before the credits start rolling--is no more than an appetizer. If they read this, I hope they'll get back to work and make a longer version. There are plenty of written sources about the original artists, but I'd be happy to watch these two guys paint on location, just talking more about how they approached these gorgeous scenes, or what inspired them about the original artists. The music and poetry are nice enough, but far less interesting than the subject of the video.
For anyone who admires Tom, David and Emily as much as I do, it's worth the money--just watch it twice and pretend it's half an hour long. I would have given it 4 or 5 stars if it were longer.",1325548800,2,1296,4.381742738589212
