Teenage angst, annoyance with parents, and the ultimate quest (to lose your virginity) are the basic themes of the film. Great fun, best appreciated by adults with a bit of perspective now that they've grown up.",1259193600,2,298,4.537037037037037

Want the facts of life served raw? Actually the bonus material titled 'Kevins Guide to Becoming a Teenager' is probably better than the main movie - and nearly as long!
By the way, Corn dogs are the American equivalent of sausage from the chip shop (hot dogs in thick batter on a stick) and only appeal to those who also like macaroni and cheese.",1079654400,2,571,4.447619047619048

Its basically just a London version of A NIGHT AT THE ROXBURY, with one too many erection jokes. It gets annoying after a while, and I lost interest in it about half way through. I finished it hoping it would get better.

7927405,5,B00004YN7I,"One of the things that is annoying about many club films is their tendency to involve drugs throughout the story-line. To be fair, club culture has a lot of drug-use but (as someone who is a keen clubber but has never used illegal substances to 'enhance' the experience) it does get a bit annoying that the counter-culture is plagued by such things.

This film, though, is different as it does not contain any illegal drugs (so far as I can recall) & hence develops the other two themes that can often be neglected by such films, namely Music and Love.

There is also the added bonus that this film is funny, but not in a saccharine or corny manner that some films (of this sort) can be. Having listened to the dialogue on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/the-Soundtrack/dp/B00004T3XY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">the Soundtrack</a>, there are some very funny bits and I'd say the comedy writing was up there with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shaun-Of-The-Dead/dp/B0002MJT0I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shaun Of The Dead</a>.

***

Onto the story (Beware: Plot spoilers!)

The film starts off with introducing Kevin & Perry through a scene where Kevin states ""The only person who really understands me is my best mate Perry. He is Joyful in his Understanding of my Bountiful Wisdom"" (before Perry points out that Kevin's jacket is on inside out!)
We then discover that the two of them are Virgins & that they spend most of their spare time DJing & making mixes (e.g. their song&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/All-I-wanna-do-is-do-it/dp/B00004W9KR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">All I wanna do is do it</a>), all the time wanting to be famous DJ's and be surrounded by women.
After pretending to have slept with a girl & the truth being publically revealed that they are virgins (in the most humiliating way imaginable), they set off to Ibiza.

In Ibiza, they meet up with Eye-ball Paul (a narcissistic superstar DJ) & effectively become his slaves.
Meanwhile Kevin's parents use the holiday as an occasion for romance and Kevin tries to deny increasingly obvious signs that they love each other (""My parents don't do *it* - they've only ever done *it* once."")

As the plot develops, the pair meet up with two ladies who seem to be as equally unlucky in love as them and, after persuading Eye-Ball Paul to play their mix, they get into one of the biggest clubs in Ibiza ('Amnesia' - said to be based on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cream/dp/B000002GFC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cream</a>)...

Anyhow, the rest of the plot is fairly predictable, but hopefully this will give a flavour of what the film is about, without giving too much away.

***

If you haven't seen this film, then I thoroughly recommend it as a classic of its kind, with a good balance of club culture, comedy & charactors to carry the film along creating, in the process, some very funny and very memorable scenes (e.g. the scene where Kevin & Perry are listening to a walkman, walking in the sea and Perry decides the answer the call of nature - ""You've got to have a **** in the sea - it's the law!"")

And the other curious thing is that only one film about clubbing has equalled it since (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/It-s-All-Gone-Pete-Tong/dp/B000IYV1RO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">It's All Gone Pete Tong</a>), and I'd argue that no other film better defines Ibiza.
That said, if you're after club culture, then your first stop should be&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Human-Traffic/dp/B000TR6BC0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Human Traffic</a>&nbsp;as the definitive tome on all things dance. I'd also recommend&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Go/dp/0767835093/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Go</a>&nbsp;as an excellent example of an American clubbing film.
However, once you've seen&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Human-Traffic/dp/B000TR6BC0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Human Traffic</a>, this film stands out as the only other pillar of a sadly missed musical movement...",1291939200,,4284,6.123333333333333
