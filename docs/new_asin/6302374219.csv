7825289,1,6302374219,"Stagey performances , poor sound, repeating songs, every wretched excess in the ""music video"" style with jerky camera cuts, sexy babes for no reason,  Not what I expect from Neil.
I've been a fan since '66 and this video is very disappointing , especially if you have seen ""Rust.."" and ""Year of the Horse""",1026345600,5,305,4.648148148148148

7825291,4,6302374219,"A must have for any die-hard Neil Young / Crazy Horse fan!  Collection of videos that I had never seen before, professionally fimed, from the Ragged Glory album.  Includes Piece of Crap, Love and Only Love, Mansion on the  Hill (2 versions) and Country Home.  Good video, just know that this is a  short, 30 minute collection of videos only!",931910400,14,341,4.616666666666666
