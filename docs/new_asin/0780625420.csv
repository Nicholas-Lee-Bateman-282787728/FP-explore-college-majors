7789875,3,0780625420,"Thanks to an internet download, I saw able to see this VHS tape of the first annual Great American Bash held at the American Legion Memorial Stadium in Charlotte, NC which was a joint production with Pro Wrestling Illustrated as this was a one hour tape that just showed highlights of the big attraction matches throughout the event hosted by Gordon Solie & Bill Apter who gave the introductions & showed some background footage leading into each match.  The matches shown in edited/highlight form include Ron Bass vs. Buddy Landel, National Tag Team Champions Ole & Arn Anderson vs. Buzz Saywer & Dick Slater, Billy Graham & Adbullah The Butcher & The Barbarian vs. Sam Houston & Buzz Tyler & Manny Fernandez, Jimmy Valant vs. Paul Jones in a Dog Collar Match, AWA Tag Team Champions Road Warriors vs. NWA Tag Team Champions Ivan Koloff & Krusher Khruschev, United States Champion Magnum T.A. vs. Kamala, and Television Champion Tully Blanchard vs. Dusty Rhodes in a Steel Cage Match where Rhodes gains the services of Baby Doll if he wins.

The only match shown in full was NWA Champion Ric Flair vs. Nikita Koloff as it should be noted that David Crockett was the special referee for this match, Nikita came into this match as one half of the Tag Team Champions with his uncle & partner Ivan Koloff in his corner & Ric Flair had a spectacular entrance via a helicopter. Nikita showcased of it superior power advantage early constantly shoving Flair down only for him to retaliate with a heavy amount of chops to the chest as they traded momentum getting more physical as time went on with both men pushing the limits of a disqualification causing the referee to get physically involved on more than one occasion before Nikita was finally able to take control using his strength advantage to not only constantly work over Flair in & outside of the ring to the point where he was bleeding but stop any attempted momentum dead in it's tracks only for things to start getting out of control with not only the referee being an innocent victim more than once but a fan taking matters into his own hands.
[United We Slam: Best Of Great American Bash]

As I said earlier, this was mostly just a one hour  highlight tape with the only match shown in full available on a recent WWE DVD release so this is only something I could recommend for hardcore collectors or fans of this time period but this tape can be skipped otherwise.",1416355200,,2422,4.638694638694639
7789876,5,0780625420,"This tape highlights some of the best matches of the 1985 Great American Bash, all of which were held at the outdoor Charlotte Memorial Coliseum in July of 1985.  Tony Schiavoni is on commentary, and Bill Apter and Gordon Solie provide timely studio commentary as they introduce the matches and explain the background storylines.",1393286400,,329,5.092592592592593
7789877,3,0780625420,"Well after another long period of time since I have written a review, I was able to catch on some classic wrestling events & Great American Bash 1992 was one of them. Now during this time, we were going through a transitional period in WCW as Bill Watts (remember him?) had token control of WCW & first official act was to have a one night tournament to determine the NWA World Tag Team Champions. Along with that WCW Champion Sting was scheduled to defend his title in what was arguably his toughest test yet in Big Van Vader. Now remember during this Bill Watts era of WCW, there was no mats on the floor & there was a rule in which you come off the top rope, it would result in a disqualification (seriously don't ask). One other thing that should be noted is that during this time, WCW constantly edit down their events to run for 2 hours so with the exception of Sting vs Vader, every match here is edited off a couple of minutes.

Ricky Steamboat & Nikita Koloff vs Brian Pillman & Jushin Liger. This was the first of the quarter finals match of the Tag Team title tournament as it was joined in progress but during that time, you had non-stop action as Pillman & Liger relied on their speed & quickness along with attempting to ground Steamboat at times while Nikita was the powerhouse of the match each time he stepped in before it was one counter mistake that allowed Steamboat & Koloff to qualify to the next round.

Hiroshi Hase & Shinya Hashimoto vs The Fabulous Freebirds. This was joined in progress as well as the team of Hase & Hashimoto dominated this contest with the Freebirds getting a shot here & there including gaining the advantage before it was just too late for them to overcome.

Dustin Rhodes & Barry Windham vs Rick Rude & ""Stunning"" Steve Austin. This was joined in progess also by a couple of minutes but within in the time that we did see action, it was a quality tag team match as Rude & Austin tried to cut the ring in half while isolating Dustin from Barry to later on doing the same to Barry before Austin & Rude made one mistake to many allowing Windham & Rhodes to get back on track & gain the victory to the next round. Even though this match was edited, this was actually my favorite match of the tournament as the crowd was just hot from start to finish here.

Steve Williams & Terry Gordy vs Nikita Koloff & Ricky Steamboat. Originally, the WCW Tag Team Champions The Steiner Brothers were supposed to face Williams & Gordy but due to the victory they received at the last Clash along with Scott's injury, Williams & Gordy got a ""bye"" into the next round. Another match that was joined in progress but in the time that was shown, there was a good story being told in how Steamboat was again isolated from his partner for long periods of time but the difference was that the focus was on his back allowing him to be slower than he would usually be with that injury playing a factor in the end.

Dustin Rhodes & Barry Windham vs Hiroshi Hase & Shinya Hashimoto. This match again was shown in progress as the story here was that Dustin & Barry went through a much tougher opening match than the Japanese team so they were more worn down in this match before they were able to pick up some steam & gain access to the final round of the tournament.

WCW Champion Sting vs Vader. This was the beginning of the feud that I believed was carrying WCW at this time as Sting & Vader never had a bad match together. The storytelling was there as Vader focused on Sting's injured ribs (that Vader actually injured a few weeks prior) even to the point to where Vader even used Sting's own finishing move as a slap to the face to Sting. Sting was able to rebound with his speed & quickness along with surprising power offense including various suplexes to the much larger Vader. The ending was a shocker for it's time as Sting made one mistake that cost him to not only be busted open but lose his championship.

Dustin Rhodes & Barry Windham vs Steve Williams & Terry Gordy. Even though this was the final match of the tournament, this match was also edited. Williams & Gordy applied the same strategy that they used in their previous match in which they cut the ring in half & kept wearing down Dustin while at the same time taking advantage of the fact that they were fresher than their opponents (this was Dustin & Barry's third match while it was Gordy & Williams second). However, the shock at the end was something to see as Williams & Gordy became the new NWA Tag Team Champions to complete silence to the crowd. As a side note, this match showed the problem WCW had with the booking as Williams & Gordy just weren't over at the time due to their New Japan past so the crowd really didn't know how to react to them & barely did during this match other than a few times for Dustin & Barry. The match wasn't bad but the dead crowd really put this one down.

Overall, this was one of those events where they tried to have too much on the card & while the wrestling quality is there, I can't recommend finding this tape since the only non-edited match on the tape is the Sting/Vader clash (which is on the ""Rise & Fall of WCW"" DVD so this is an event that I would find online (as I did if you really want to see it.",1298419200,,5246,4.318781725888325
7789878,4,0780625420,"The only bad matches on the tape were The US title match between Bill Goldberg & Konnan which was one-sided flop & The Roddy Piper/Randy Savage-Hulk Hogan/Bret Hart which was slow & sloppy. Other then that,this tape is pretty good. I give this tape a 7 out of 10.",1279670400,,263,4.387755102040816
7789879,1,0780625420,"I thought I was getting complete matches, but they are just clips and very fast clips at that. The matches are excellent but its like watching them in fast foward. Maybe get it because WWE will never put out a great selection of WCW matchs.",1156204800,,240,4.355555555555555
7789880,5,0780625420,"Absolutely the finest of WCW's ""Best of"" series from one of the longest-running PPV's WCW has had.  Features matches from when the GAB used to tour the country back in the days when WCW was still an NWA member.  The matches selected were mainly the older matches, which is good, since people more than likely have a greater memory for the recent stuff.  Flair/Sting & Luger/Steamboat were both excellent, and Flair v Savage on Father's Day at GAB '95 set up a very nice angle for the next PPV, showing that even as late as 1995, WCW still was capable of putting on a good show and a good angle.  1996 was my personal favorite, showing Steve McMichael turn on partner Kevin Greene to join the Four Horsemen.  With Horsemen advisor Bobby ""The Brain"" Heenan and valets Woman & Elizabeth, and Tara Greene & Debra McMichael for the ex-footballers, this is a shining example (especially for Vince Russo, who booked several of the last years of WCW) that you can have a lot of people ringside, yet they don't have to distract from the action in the ring.  A 4-star match.  Highest possible recommendation.",1071619200,2,1098,4.628865979381444

from Sting was shocking!",999993600,,88,4.5625
7789882,3,0780625420,"This was ok.  I was expecting more from this movie.  It shows the 1989 U.S.title match between Luger and Steamboat.  It shows 1 year later, Sting's 1st title reign, defeating Ric Flair.  Vader beats Sting 2 years  later for the title.  Ric Flair beat Savage on Father;s Day in 1995.  It  also shows Steve McMichael Joining the 4 Horseman in 96.  And more.  Please, do not get this movie if you are in need for a good movie.",949190400,2,423,4.3076923076923075
