3058096,3,B001110H00,"I found the narrator of these ""trips"" to be a bit long-winded and somewhat full of himself. He tends to ramble and mumble as he ""travels"" to each place.  He is also British so some of the humor did not ""translate"" well to my students.  I teach elementary gifted students and we are studying World Wonders as our topic.  I bought this DVD along with other resources.  The Reader's Digest ""Great Wonders fo the World""  was better because it was more on topic and more understandable and consise for historical facts.",1269302400,7,514,4.604395604395604
3058097,4,B001110H00,Wonderful.  I remember this when it first aired on t.v. and thought I must get a copy so I can record all 80 treasures.  Cruikshank is a treasure himself-full of enthusiasm and knowledge.  It's a great DVD to have because there were too many unknown places to remember at a single viewing.,1261353600,3,289,4.519230769230769
3058098,5,B001110H00,"I loved this travel series and rewatching it again made it even better.
It's not that I'd ever get to the places he goes to(but that's not the point is it?)- he's revealing and reviewing these places as the makers are sure most won't see these things as well-and that's what makes it good.
I especially liked the Silk road/carpets/tiles and arabesque buildings-that's something the west doesn't always appreciate.
Dan Cruikshank has a demenour and humour that is unique and also needed as he stumbles his way around some of the most sensitive parts of the globe. Don't expect in depth history lessons from him and take it as a casual stroll around the planet. That'll make it a favorite.
This is a great travel brouchure series and if you can never get to his selected 80 treasures you can always watch the DVD.",1249344000,3,811,4.638888888888889
3058099,5,B001110H00,"If you like any of the other BBC videos and have an interest in other cultures I highly recommend this video, as well as The Ganges and Galapagos videos. This video covers so many cultures and sites that fortunately/unfortunately it leaves you wanting more in depth description, hoping that they produce more video. The only draw back is that the narrator can become a little obnoxious at times, its not really his fault though he's English.",1244419200,2,441,4.815789473684211
3058100,5,B001110H00,"This is a very interesting shapshot of a wide variety of 'Treasures'. It is amazing just from a travel logistics standpoint, and the items discussed are frequently 'off the beaten track'. I enjoyed this very much and have lent it to many friends who got an equal amount of enjoyment. I highly recommend this",1233446400,,307,4.703703703703703
3058101,5,B001110H00,"The narrator's British accent and seemingly constant enthusiasm makes this video a jolly good treat. He manages to provide new insight to some very exposed art treasures.
My only complaint is that there is no program directory- I suppose he wanted the `treasures' to be unexpected.
Not having a program, makes finding a specific treasure to view difficult. I had to take notes, so I could go directly to video segments for class use. Maybe the producers could post a program list on the BBC website?
I highly recommend this video!",1232496000,5,530,4.835164835164835
3058102,5,B001110H00,"Congratulations to Mr. D. Cruickshank and to all the BBC team who made possible this beautiful documentary. It is in itself a treasure !!
I recommend this DVD series not only for family-home entertainment but also for libraries, schools and science museums in order to promote this so fine work. The quality of image and sound is excellent.
Key words from my part to this product: culture, knowledge, travels, photography, dream come true, peace, wonders of the world, amazing planet, beauty, diversity, mankind, animals, plants, architectural structres, ancestors, modernism. I can only compare this TV series with just one other TV series, and only one: COSMOS !!.",1222128000,21,666,5.233644859813084
3058103,5,B001110H00,"Amazing 5 month tour of 34 nations.  Having worked or traveled in most these countries, I was much impressed by Cruickshank's ability to capture the essence of these diverse cultures as manifested in their art and architecture.  His comments were intelligent.  One might quibble over some of the details, but all in all it's a stunning achievement. I really appreciated his covering lesser known spots like Mali and Ethiopia.  Of course, I have my own photos, but they cannot compare with the beauty captured by these professional cameramen.  What a marvelous addition to my own memoirs!",1221004800,19,587,5.072916666666667
3058104,5,B001110H00,I love Dan Cruickshank.  I first saw this series many years ago and I knew I wanted my own copy to watch over again.  It never gets boring.,1394841600,,139,3.9285714285714284
3058105,4,B001110H00,...almost excellent except that in my copy I couldn't watch the parts about Egypt. Here the copy was defective and I just couldn't watch the Egyptian treasures. It's a pity!!,1390262400,,174,4.833333333333333
3058106,5,B001110H00,I love this travel documentaries. Cruickshank shows a different approach to ancient historic buildings from many different places around the world.,1376611200,,147,6.0476190476190474
3058107,3,B001110H00,Keep thinking I will get back to it and I probably will. For some reason didn't make me just want to watch it all. Can't identify why.,1373241600,3,134,4.0
3058108,1,B001110H00,"I ordered this set of DVD's for the pure enjoyment of seeing places in the world we would most likely never be able to travel to. They would have been a nice journey if Mr. Cruickshank had kept his political views to himself. As it is, he is just one more liberal voice with the same rhetoric and opinions about what he thinks about this country and about historical events world-wide. It appears he embraces Communism. He is from Britain and that in itself makes me wonder how he can be so critical of this country or others when his own country has such a deeply embedded plank in it's own eye. I'm sending this set back even before finishing it. We travel to get away from the day to day weariness of 'news' and opinions, not to hear the travel host and others he or she interviews tell of their own opinions limited to their own ignorance and assumptions of history.",1362441600,9,870,4.3765432098765435
3058109,5,B001110H00,excellent production with very thoughtful information.  Some common places but also some nice exceptions.  All were well covered and the presenter showed that he knew his subject. i picked it as the price was right.,1350172800,2,215,5.114285714285714
3058110,5,B001110H00,Bought this for a give.. great video quality. Takes you to lots of places and lets us see alot on one video,1328227200,,107,3.909090909090909
3058111,3,B001110H00,"The travel was very scenic and interesting, but if I was on a trip with this guy he and I would of gotten in several fights along the trip.  The host probably will eventually rub most the wrong way.  If I were on vacation with him  I would of dumped him in China and went off on my own.",1320105600,6,286,3.8135593220338984
3058112,5,B001110H00,"Absolutely wonderful, engrossing, engaging and fascinating series! And Dan Cruickshank makes it all the more fun with his quirky personality. I smiled often through this series, and sometimes chuckled loudly at Cruickshank being Cruickshank - like the way he lowers his voice and urgently whispers into the camera when he is really excited about a piece of history he is relaying.

But most importantly, this man knows his stuff! He has a very unique take on things, selecting wonderful treasures that I had never even heard of, but am now anxious to visit, along with some of the more expected ones we are all familiar with. Yet even the familiar ones are made more interesting with new information and facts, or areas that Dan shows us that we would never get to see. He had amazing access, and when he didn't, such as in The People's Republic of China, he shares his frustration at the government's machinations, and political correctness be damned! Wonderful!

In some cases, such as when he visits NYC, he takes us around to all the places we think he will select, telling us how wonderful they are, just to then exclaim, ""but that's not my treasure!"" And when he gets to the treasure, through his description, pointing out details that most of us would never notice, you come to understand, and agree, with his choice. Staying with NYC as an example, he exclaims that of course skyscrapers are treasures of the world, and NYC is renowned for them, so he must pick a skyscraper. We then see him in front of first, the Empire State Building, then the Chrysler Building, and finally at his treasure, The Seagrams Building! That boring, rectangular thing, one might think. But he goes on to explain that it was designed by Mies van der Rohe, and points out the attention to detail and wonderful design features that even a design professional (like me) would normally overlook.

The skyscraper is not typical of his treasures though. Most are wild and wonderful ancient places, as other reviewers have noted. Get this video, and enjoy!",1296086400,10,2037,4.797720797720798
3058113,1,B001110H00,"I was very disappointed in this DVD. While some of the sites picked were interesting like the Incas. Most were frankly disappointing or extremely bloody like the Aztecs. His choices concerning Pre Columbian America were frankly not the best. I was also disappointed in his coverage of America (A Pistol and New York City!?! Are to be considered treasures?) I could pick a few places like Alaska or the Grand Tetons that are more of a treasure.
