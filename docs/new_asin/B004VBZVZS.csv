8443182,4,B004VBZVZS,"Can't blame anyone involved with the hugely successful Underbelly franchise to cash in.  Not to say that the 3-individual movies are not good.

""The Man That Got Away"" - the story of the only foreigner ever to escape from The ""Bangkok Hilton"" prison.
I read the book and thought the movie was an excellent adaptation

""Infiltration"" - man and woman police officers go deep undercover as husband and wife to infiltrate the Italian Mafia in Australia.
I would rate this as very good-excellent

""Tell Lucifer Was Here"" - massive manhunt to find the killers of 2-police officers
I would rate this as good-very good

All-in, the 3-movies are worthwhile stand alone features.",1336521600,2,669,4.9375
8443183,5,B004VBZVZS,"Underbelly Files takes this popular true crime genre franchise from television series to television movie mode. The three films in this set all standalone. However there is some minor interaction with past Underbelly characters in two of the three films, i.e. ""Infiltrator"" and ""Tell Them Lucifer Was Here"". The films are all highly informative regarding true Australian crime, and provide a unique Aussie style with absorbing acting, authentic dialogue, great costume design, and quality location filming.
