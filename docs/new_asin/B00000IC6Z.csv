7910601,4,B00000IC6Z,"In BELA LUGOSI MEETS A BROOKLYN GORILLA (1952), Sammy Petrillo as Jerry Lewis is nothing less than remarkable. No wonder Jerry hated this younger man on sight! The kid had his act down to the tiniest nuance. Especially enjoyable is when Sammy drops the ""la-la-la nice lady"" voice to do a corny stand-up routine in his natural baritone and manner. Just like that (snap) Jerry Lewis vanishes.

Conversely, Duke Mitchell is no Dean Martin, and he clearly knows it. Twice, Mitchell sings in a near-operatic vibrato. The balance of the time he's content to let Sammy carry the load, which the kid does admirably.

Evidence of a 'C' grade budget is everywhere-- in the cheap sets, store-bought wardrobes, jungle animal stock footage and lack of retakes. Example of the latter: once they enter Lugosi's home, Sammy flashes a tiny grin after sarong-clad 'Nona' (Charlita) mentions how brilliant 'Dr. Zabor' is. He matter-of-factly replies, ""Anybody who'd live in a creep joint like this must be a moronic idiot."" Duke glances at him, breaks into a broad smile and Sam responds in kind. These men must like each other. At very least, they're enjoying themselves and so can we, thanks to the inclusion of an imperfect but cute 'take.'

""Brooklyn Gorilla"" is mindless fun. It belongs in the home libraries of Lugosi and Lewis fans alike.",1390608000,,1326,4.910714285714286
7910602,3,B00000IC6Z,"If you like Martin & Lewis, The Bowery Boys, or Abbott & Costello, this one is worth checking out.  The production crew usually worked on Abbott & Costello and Bowery Boys movies, and this silly jungle comedy  is no worse (and sometimes better) than its higher-budgeted rivals.  Nightclub comics Duke Mitchell and Sammy Petrillo do a good Martin &  Lewis imitation (in some scenes you'd swear you were watching Jerry Lewis).  The aging Lugosi, playing yet another evil scientist, delivers his usual  professional performance, and even does romantic scenes convincingly.  Saturday-matinee stuff, but fun for B-movie fans.",944611200,,620,5.329896907216495
