1665445,5,B00005UERJ,"I popped this DVD in last night and was surprised.  I guess I shouldn't be, with National Geographic producing this.  The DVD does a great job of exploring the events that influenced JRR Tolkien, including Industrialization and World War I .
I was also surprised with the footage and interviews.  These are not interviews of some random Tolkien ""experts"", but with his best friend, war buddy, and also the man Peter Jackson himself.  The rest of cast speaks also, some in full costume on the set.  There is tons of footage from the movie.  This adds a lot to the DVD.
There is also an in-depth study of the origins of the Elfish Language.  Very nice.  My favorite part of the DVD was seeing how the filmmakers modeled Hobbiton after the childhood village of Tolkien.  The bridge is exactly the same!  Cool stuff.  The houses look just like the village of Bree.
Overall, this DVD is a worthy effort.  It gives an in-depth look at the origin of the novels and also the movie.",1013731200,46,973,4.528735632183908
1665446,5,B00005UERJ,"The National Geographic has always been great with performance of documentary.  This disc shows them at the flux of the New Tolkien look, (according the the 2001 Lord of the Rings release), and follows with the useful information of Tolkien.",1389916800,,241,5.025
1665447,5,B00005UERJ,"i own this dvd but this order was for a friend who is just starting to become a tolkien fan, i got it for him so he can learn how tolkien made the fascinating tale that is LOTR. must see for anyone who wishes to learn how real world events shaped tolkiens writings",1379721600,,264,4.0
1665448,5,B00005UERJ,This is the best special feature from the Lord of the Rings special features.  The scenery is fantastic.  The DVD was in good shape when it arrived and was what we ordered.  Enjoy!,1377734400,,180,4.393939393939394

1665452,1,B00005UERJ,"While comparisons between the Shire and Tolkien's boyhood home were among many interesting points, National Geographic uses this movie as a soapbox for their own issues. The worst part of the film was when they spent 10 minutes on deforestation in Gabon, comparing it to the quest to destroy the ring. Really?",1359504000,3,309,4.961538461538462
1665453,5,B00005UERJ,"Tolkien was a scholar first and foremost. People interested in the history and culture that influenced Tolkien will enjoy this film.  For instance, I knew that Tolkien wanted to ""give the people of England their own mythology"" but I assumed his biggest influence was Anglo-Saxon language and myth.  So little is known of Anglo-Saxon myth, that there wasn't much to build off of.  His primary language influence was Finnish!  Which really surprised me because it's in a completely different language group, not remotely related to Old English.

A lot of people (in America anyway) have never heard of the Karelians.  What a coincidence that I had just been researching them, and they were featured in this documentary!  If ancient cultures who have remained apart from modernization, keeping their cultures and traditions alive the way our ancestors used to is fascinating to you, then you will love the section on the Karelians.  Imagine interviewing a village elder who is the LAST remaining holder of his culture's oral history!

Fans of 20th century history, readers of Hemingway, etc, will appreciate the sections on the World Wars.  Tolkien lived through them, as did Hemingway.  And although most people would never place them in the same literary category, it was interesting to see how the wars influenced Tolkien's writing every bit as much as Hemingway's.

Other issues such as modernization, destruction of nature to feed our ever expanding industrial growth are issues we still grapple with today.  Seeing imagery of the coal mines, child labor, and deforestation in Tolkien's day as an influence to his work really brought it home that his work is just as relevant today as ever.

In sum, if you're looking for interviews with the cast (there are some, not many), flashy behind the scenes looks at the technology and computer graphics, this documentary isn't for you.  If you're interested in culture, history, and the true influences on Tolkien's writing, you will appreciate this film.",1349308800,,2000,5.110769230769231
1665454,2,B00005UERJ,"Is this documentary worth watching for its literary or environmental value?
Heck, no!
But, if you can get a hold of it for free, it is worth watching to see the car driving down the road behind Frodo and Sam.
That's right! Remember the big thing about a car in the background of FotR?
Well, it's true (the producers make reference to it in their audio commentary for FotR).
However, nearly the only way you'll ever see it is in this documentary, b/c the scene was ""fixed"" for the DVD release of the film.
If you don't know, it's the scene when Frodo and Sam are leaving the Shire and Sam notes that he's never been that far away from home before.
It's silly, but fun.",1298160000,,667,4.301587301587301
1665455,4,B00005UERJ,"This National Geographic documentary does a good job of covering some important aspects of Tolkien's life, and how they relate to his writing.

No doubt a great deal was left unsaid, though I suspect that a truly comprehensive examination of this man's life and work could easily fill 12 hours of video.  I mind this incompleteness less, though than the two detours which the film takes.  The first takes the viewer to Finland, where the disappearance of an older way of life seems only tangentially related to Tolkien's books.  The second is a protracted description of a man's journey across the remotest portions of Africa- again seemingly relevant only in the most abstract sense.  I note that both excursions involve National Geographic associates.  Judicious editing of these two unnecessary portions of the movie would have rendered it a bit short.

The film includes some interviews with people involved in production of the recent film adaptations of ""Lord of the Rings"", whose comments I found moderately pertinent.

Despite the distractions and somewhat ""light"" content, I enjoyed watching this.",1274832000,,1106,5.209039548022599

1665457,2,B00005UERJ,"I received this as a gift.  Pretty hard to impress me with something Tolkien related, I've read the main books at least 3 times each, the entire 12 volume History of Middle Earth series from Christopher, the entire Tolkien Studies series from West Virginia University press, and numerous others.  This would be good additional information for anyone that was a fan of the Peter Jackson trilogy, but if you're the type that's as far into Tolkien as having read the Silmarillion, this will disappoint.  For many I'm sure the information about the rune singers and the Kalevala is info you might otherwise not find unless you read some of the more esoteric of Tolkien histories, so rent it for a night (there's hardly an hour of content here) but don't buy it.",1230940800,,757,4.71969696969697
1665458,4,B00005UERJ,"My daughter Sonya asked me to write a review and tell she really liked the DVD.

Now my two cents. Basically the main line of this story is if the site currently known as Troy is the Troy from the Iliad. A few experts are sharing their opinions and their conclusion is basically yes, it could be that Troy. But this film doesn't tell much about the Iliad, a lot of time is spent showing the modern time actors playing ancient scenes somewhere in the US (not very convincing to my taste). Another big part of the file is about the treasure known as the Gold of Troy, currently held in Moscow. There is some interesting footage from Turkey and Greece, but unfortunately, not as much as I would expect.

Overall, this is an interesting program to watch especially if you going to see the movie ""Troy"". But it could've been done better. Too much modern stuff, too little about the ancient Troy.",1136160000,7,890,4.45398773006135
1665459,3,B00005UERJ,"Not as bad as the Alexander fiasco that NG put out, this has more to do with the search for Troy than the Iliad.  Even so, I still dispise using Roman God names while reading from Homer, which happened.

1665460,5,B00005UERJ,"I thought it was very interesting.  I was intrigued by the ideas of Tolkien'a life as presented by National Geographics.

1665463,1,B00005UERJ,"I was very disappointed. These National Geographic specials are usually quality productions. But this one seems more of an afterthought than a serious effort. The actors walk around in cheap high school costumes that make no effort at all to be historical. And the expert commentary seems very tongue-in-cheek. Nothing in this special is at all special. I really expected better.
Check out Michael Wood's ""In Search of the Trojan War"" instead. It has more of what you expected to be in this DVD.",1087603200,12,495,4.904761904761905
1665464,5,B00005UERJ,"This documentary on Troy and Trojan War is brought to life in such a vivid and entertaining way as only the folks from the National Geographic could.  Shown on the National Geographic channel as the special ""Conquering Troy,"" this documentary appeals to everyone from the casual history buff or mythology fan to historians and scholars alike.
There are re-enactments of the various scenes from Homer's ""The Iliad"" and Virgil's ""The Aeneid"" sprinkled throughout.  The documentary talks about Homer's tale but also attempts to unearth the truth behind the mythology.  That is: Did Troy really exist?  Was there a Trojan Horse?  Did the war between Troy and Agamemnon's Greek fleet really take place?  Were there really such persons as Achilles and Agamemnon, Helen and Paris?  These questions are answered by comparing Homer's and Virgil's texts to the actual findings by archeologists and scholars - for instance, excavations by Heinrich Schliemann in the 1870s and Carl Blegann in the 1930s that determined that present day Hissarlik, Turkey, was in fact the site of the ancient city of Troy.  There are also several interviews from historians, archeologists and scholars as well as film footage and pictures of the various dig sites, findings and treasures from Troy and Mycenae (Agamemnon's Greek city).
I grew up fascinated with Greek and Roman mythology and, in anticipation for the upcoming film ""Troy,"" I was eager to learn more about the Trojan War.  This show is enlightening and interesting, to say the least.  Fans of mythology and those who want to learn more about Troy and its history will certainly enjoy this documentary.",1084060800,43,1636,5.139622641509434
1665465,5,B00005UERJ,"I loved watching this DVD. I felt transported back to ancient times and as if history came alive in front of my eyes. I learned a lot more about the subject, was glued to the interviews and was absolutely blown away by the gorgeousness of the landscapes.",1083283200,10,254,4.425531914893617
1665466,3,B00005UERJ,"I purchased this DVD hoping to find an exploration into the historical and anthropological background to Lord of the Rings.  Did it deliver?  Well...sort of.
It gives us some information (precious little) about the life and times of J.R.R. Tolkien - but nothing much that we did not all ready know: he fought in World War I, he was from the English countryside and was not a fan of industrialization, he was educated and taught at Oxford, etc.
Some insight is provided into the historical aspect of the Trilogy.  Tolkien was heavily influenced by Beowulf and Anglo-Saxon history.  Most illuminating was the discussion of the Nordic Kalevala, and the possible roots of Elvish.  (For all you MST 3K fans out there, the Kalevala is the source of the Sampo).
Where I feel the documentary went wrong is that there is not enough of such material.  Instead, it comes off as too much of a plug for the movie The Fellowship of the Ring.  It is chock full of interviews with Peter Jackson and the cast and would certainly be at home as an extra on the DVD.  It also tries to justify its existence by providing parallels between themes in the book (like nature conservation) and our world today.
Unfortunately, we live in a time when we seem to be at war every other year.  Sauron's and Saruman's abound.  It is not too hard for us to find the parallels between Earth and Middle-earth for ourselves.  As Christopher Lee puts it at the end of the documentary, ""Where is the Ring Bearer now?""
Where indeed?",1075420800,18,1493,4.59622641509434
1665467,1,B00005UERJ,"This is getting one star because you can't give it a half star.
The worst part about this DVD is that it doesn't do a good job at masking the fact that's its not really educational- it feels more like a long winded commercial for the movie.  It hits on historical bits and points here and there but never goes into much detail.  Additionally, it just seems to wander from point to point without a lot of structure.
Sleep inducing, really.
Save your money.
LoTR can easily sell itself without the help.",1071532800,8,501,4.434782608695652
1665468,4,B00005UERJ,"If you're a fan of Tolkien's works, I mean a fan of the works beyond the movie and beyond the Lord of the Rings trilogy, then you might be interested in watching this DVD.  If you're looking for a behind-the-scenes dvd about the blockbuster movies by Peter Jackson, then you might want to turn off this DVD after the first ten minutes and pick up a Fellowship of the Rings boxed set.
This documentary fulfills its claim of going beyond the movie.  It certainly does!  This dvd goes beyond even the works of Tolkien and centers around the author's life and influences.  If you're interested in languages and history, you might find sections of the DVD fascinating as National Geographics takes us to places like Finland and spends what seemed to me to be ages talking to people about language and myths.
I'm not really a linguist, nor am I a historian interested in Norse mythology, but I am quite intersted in Tolkien and the things that influenced his works.  For these reasons, I found this DVD to be filled with a wealth of information that goes beyond the shallow tv-style approach to movie backgrounds.  This DVD explores several possible influences on the Lord of the Rings trilogy ranging from foxholes in World War II to epic poems such as Beowulf.  It was very interesting to see how historians and archeologists can shed light on modern fantasy novels and can influence our interpretations of the events within them.
I do have a few detractions for this DVD.  It is true that when I purchased it, I expected more of a behind-the-scenes look at the films by Peter Jackson, and I think the cover and description is somewhat misleading in this way.  I was surprised, and not unpleasantly, by the content, but some of the sections discussing language seemed to drag on for a while and leave the audience behind.
If you're a Tolkien addict, check out this DVD.  If you're a Peter Jackson addict...buy the boxed set of FoTR.",1054684800,29,1928,4.660766961651918
1665469,1,B00005UERJ,"As a true Tolkien fan, I can safely say that almost every review on this website that proclaims this feature bad is entirely CORRECT. The only reason you would want to buy this production is for some film footage, and snippets from some cast interviews, which could very well be included in the behind-the-scenes stuff on the Fellowship of the Ring extended edition DVD.
At one point, they show a film clip of the Fellowship beginning to kick some orc-rear in Moria, and right after the cave-troll takes a whack at Sam, we cut to images of tanks, and railroads, and industrial machinery, as the narrator talks of Tolkiens experiences with war, and how industrial progress was portrayed in the novels as the Dark Lord Sauron. There are several other times where the documentary infers this. Was there symbolism like this in Lord of the Rings? Yes, some. Was Mordor supposed to represent industry, and machines? Do the novels contain a Save-the-Earth, hug-a-tree message? Not really. Tolkien was a conservationist of sorts, but he would spin in his grave to learn of the things National Geographic said.
Towards the end of the feature, they discuss the language that Tolkien based Elvish upon, the language of the Kalevanas, and National Geographic just cant help veering 180 degrees away from Lord of the Rings in order to focus on the failing culture there, a failed attempt to compare the peoples of then to the peoples of Middle-Earth.
So, overall, Id say that this isn't worth buying, unless its included in a package like the extended edition gift set, which, as I said, is the only reason I saw this.
To National Geographic's credit, on the DVD, theres some extra material regarding the Inklings, the writers group Tolkien was a member of. It mentions Tolkiens CHRISTIANITY, and his friendship with C.S. Lewis. Here you can find some valuable information about the two, and the group itself. Otherwise, there is zero mention of the impact that Christianity had on his life.
Take my advice, Tolkien fans: PLEASE don't buy this!",1052006400,15,2031,4.872832369942197
1665470,1,B00005UERJ,"Having read ""The Lord of the Rings"" and being a large Tolkien fan I was sickened at how the makers of this video tried to twist Tolkien's visions into their own independent agenda.

I used to have a very high opinion of National Geographic, but they've really let me down here.",1046908800,13,386,4.661764705882353
1665471,1,B00005UERJ,"They should have called this video, ""Have you hugged your Ent today- A distorted view of Tolkiens Middle Earth"".  I watched this video, not only to see perhaps a little bit behind the making of the theatrical versions of Tolkiens masterpieces, but to also see the beautiful vistas of New Zealand that I've heard so much about.  Instead National Geographic gives us an inside look at how they can take a wonderful piece of literary genius and twist it to conform to their own misguided liberal views of the world.  As a long-time Tolkienite, I consider this video pure blasphemy.  The Lord of the Rings is a reinterpretation of mythological motifs and a hero's journey, not a political statement to save the rain forests.  If -5 stars was a choice, I would have given this video that rating.  If you are looking for insight into the realm of Tolkiens Middle Earth, I suggest purchasing ""J.R.R. Tolkien - Master of the Rings Gift Set"".  As far as a tie-in between New Zealand & Lord of the Rings, the Travel channel had an excellent 2 part series on this, but to my knowledge it is not available on video yet.  Perhaps it will be included in the 4 disc set of ""The Two Towers"" coming out in November, 2003.",1046044800,18,1204,4.516129032258065

1665474,1,B00005UERJ,"The DVD has lots of ""filler"" of unrelated material--the gratuitous WW I footage and the eco-hiking nonsense at the end of the film. Nat'l Geo is unbeatable for photography, but they do not apply it much to Tolkien's world and influences, as the title might suggest. They should have filmed Tolkien's surroundings, his haunts at Oxford, shown still-life photos of his drawings and friends and influences (e.g. C.S. Lewis), etc. These foundations of Tolkien's thinking comprise perhaps 45% of the film--the other 55% is consumed by excerpts from the movie and explaining the plot of the film and a large dose of politically correct irrelevance such as lengthy WW I footage and, inexplicably, the African hike of an eco-activist who is, in the minds of Nat'l Geo, on a quest analogous to Tolkien's Fellowship. If you are imagining a Ken Burns-style examination of Tolkien's influences, this ain't it--you get may a total of 15 minutes of Tolkien scholars and a brief glimpse of his Oxford days in the entire hour film. Shame on Nat'l Geo for wasting their talent and reputation on such an awful documentary.",1041292800,17,1104,4.940860215053763
1665475,4,B00005UERJ,"I bought this DVD expecting to see a ""Making-of"", and was quite surprised (Happily so!) to find that it's very much more than that. There is quite a bit about the life of J.R.R. Tolkien- His childhood, the area where he grew up (Which would eventually serve as the inspiration for The Shire), and his horrific experiences in World War I (The Lord of the Rings was first written about in a journal Tolkien kept in the trenches). In true National Geographic fashion, there is also a great deal of information about the Anglo-Saxon history and folktales that may have inspired Tolkien, as well as an incredibly fascinating piece about the Finnish language inspiring his creation of the Elvish tongues. The segnent about The Kalavala (an epic Finnish poem) was truly moving.
 The only drawback I have about recommending the DVD is the price: The visuals are great (Which is to be expected from National Geographic), and the content is absorbing, but I think the price is a tad high for a mere 53 minutes of program, and a few trailers for other National Geographic products. If you don't mind paying a lot, it'll make a worthwhile addition to your DVD collection.",1039651200,7,1159,4.737623762376238
1665476,2,B00005UERJ,"This really isn't the best National Geographic feature out there. The special is basically just an hour of Tolkiens Inspirations for writing the books, there really wasn't any real focus on the movie.
The problem with this dvd is that it really has no substance. By that I mean that the feature really doesn't have much to go on. For example, Tolkiens inspiration for the Elvish language in the film comes from a dying language from a foriegn 3rd world country (i forget the name), but the feature spends about a good 15 minutes on a segment about this one really old man who lives alone in the middle of nowhere and sings songs in this language. I was like ""who cares, what does this realy have to do with the movie?"" I would understand them mentioning it for a few minutes, but to dwell 20-25 on just the language (which is about the only thing NG did it's homework on) is a clear sign they were trying to kill time.
The segment on WW1 and tolkiens inspirations for the book was intresting at first but didn't go beyond mindless babble spending a significant amount of time saying the same thing. They really didn't dig up any good stuff on Tolkien for this thing.
The dvd then just goes on showing short clips of the movie and talking pretty much about locations and such, but nothingn that we haven't heard before or even really care about. Even the ""special features"" section was just more segment on tolkiens inspriations, that were decent,and that should have been put in the regular feature in place of most of the useless stuff.
It's obvious that National Geographic really wanted to put out some kind of LOTR feature but really didn't dig up enough useful information for it, so they hacked some hour long segment together real quick just to make a few bucks. The $21.50 price is a tad cheaper then most dvds but that is way too high a price to charge for such a mediocre feature. I gave this 2 stars instead of 1 just because it starts pretty well, but drops after the first 15 minutes. Also, a couple of the special feature segments were a bit interesting. Save your money unless you're some die-hard LOTR fan, but even then I'm sure you'll be dissappointed by its lack of effort for such an amazing film as LOTR.",1039305600,2,2225,4.482758620689655

This DVD is an insult to Tolkien and everything he believed in. Although there are some interesting things in it about the Kalevala and Anglo-Saxon stuff, this DVD as a whole, lacks any kind of focus or single subject and has numerous blatent inaccuracies about Tolkien. Supposedly, this is about the Lord of the Rings movie, but they barely talk to the cast/crew of the movie at all.

Tolkien's anti-industrial views and how they were illustrated in the LOTR is well presented.  The similarities were shown between Tolkien's own home town and that of the Shire.  The rest of the documentary is a stretch at best.
Too much emphasis was placed on WWI and WWII.  They certainly had an impact on Tolkien's life; however, anyone who has read Tolkien knows the two world wars have little impact on the content or history of Middle Earth.  Morgoth and/or Sauron are not Hitler.
Much time was spent discussing the Finish traditions and their language.  The documentary explained that Tolkien was influenced by Finish when developing Quenya.  What about the other languages of Middle Earth?  This was a great opportunity to discuss the various languages of Middle Earth, their real world counterparts, and Tolkien's genious with languages.  Instead we spend much of the time at an old man's home discussing the oral traditions of a remote part of Finland.  Interesting, but a little off the point.
A subject totally off the wall was trying to draw similarities between Tolkien and the saving of the rainforest in Africa.  I'm sorry, although truly an important issue, it has no relevance whatsoever to Tolkien's work.  It was nothing but National Geographic propaganda.
The documentary missed the major themes of Tolkien's work.  His works focus more on the peoples of Middle Earth than the languages and more on the moral values of life than just traditions.  Although language is important, the Elves are much more than just Quenya, Hobbits are more than just peace loving, simple creatures, and men certainly can be more than technology loving, destructive beings.
According to the documentary, Tolkien created the Elves as pure, idealistic beings.  Wrong!  They certainly are different from men.  There is a more majestic sense to their being, they have strength of mind and will, and they are more in tune with Middle Eath than are men.  However, they are far from perfect.  They are subject to many of the same weaknesses as men - pride and arrogance for example (Feanor ring a bell).  From what traditions of England's past did Tolkien base the Elves?  Certainly a topic worthy of discussion in the documentary.  By the way, Tolkien considered himself a Hobbit, not an elf nor a wizard as proposed by the documentary.
And, although war is horrid, Tolkien did beleive in fighting (and going to war) for what is right.  The Shire was a peaceful place not only because the Hobbits are a peaceful people, but because they were protected by men.  These men were descended from kings and yet they were content to protect and die for the Shire even though the Hobbits were too simple to know it.  Another great lesson from Tolkien - sacrifice and courage - and a message that men can be both noble and humble, strong and meek.  Yeah, but the gorillas in Africa make for better film footage.
Save your money for the DVD release of LOTR.  Although it isn't perfect (don't get me started....), it represents Tolkien and Middle Earth much better.",1025395200,2,3145,4.896030245746692
1665481,3,B00005UERJ,"I did enjoy parts of this DVD, but not all of it.
I was expecting much more from National Geographic. The first part is quite interesting and informative, but it truly deals little with the actual movie, other than with limited actor interviews. It is more the story of JRR Tolkien's original work. Maybe that's what they mean by beyond the movie, but if that was the case I would have preferred that the movie not be mentioned in the title.
Historically the information on the time period and how it may have affected the Lord of the Rings series was useful. The parts dealing with the verbal traditions of Finland were enjoyable.
What really hurt this DVD was the stretch from the adventures in Middle Earth to the trek across Africa by J. Michael Faye, which really struck me as self promotion. I understand The National Geographic Society had an important part in the ""Megatransect""  and featured it many times in various media. But they failed convince me that there was a strong connection between that and LOTR.
Overall, I did not feel that this DVD offered appropriate value in return for my money. It fell short of the high quality I had come to expect from National Geographic and would have been better served as an extra on a future LOTR DVD without the footage of the Mr. Faye's journey.",1019692800,18,1300,4.603448275862069

1665483,3,B00005UERJ,"Of course this DVD is cashing in on the success of the movie ""The Lord of the Rings - The Fellowship of the Ring"", and why should that be a bad thing? It is interesting to learn about Tolkien's life and experiences, which do seem to have influenced his writing.  The Shire as the idealised rural England of his boyhood, the Hobbits representing the worthy people among whom he grew up, his attempt to ""give the English back their mythology"", and the effect of his experiences in the First World War, these are not really open to dispute. The DVD does a good job of looking particularly at Anglo-Saxon and Finnish roots for Tolkien'' vision, even if these are not covered in great depth. In fact the material generally is on the simple side, but it isn't simplistic. The attempt to link in the Second World War is a bit annoying - the voice-over admits that Tolkien, while he was writing during that war, denied any parallels or allegories with it, but at the same time shows lots of Hitler/Sauron, Germans/Orcs, British/good guys imagery. And the ending section, with someone trekkiung (""questing"") across Africa is one of the most obvious pieces of filler I've seen. But the interviews are good enough, and the chance to hear and see more about this incomparable movie about a marvellous book makes it a DVD worth buying.",1019174400,9,1322,4.67381974248927

Anyone who is familiarized with J.R.R. Tolkien's life should know that his intention was to create a world of fantasy for children and adults as well.  He specifically denied any relationship with actual real conflicts or characters of our history.  Surely he is influenced by the nordic myths, traditions, legends and landscapes but if you get to read his own introduction to ""The Lord of the Rings"" you will find an aversion to the specific line of thinking used in the production by National Geografic.
I do not recomend this product.  It is educational but has nothing to do with the real background of J.R.R.T. and his idea of creating the longest story ever written.",1019001600,18,899,4.940397350993377

Endless scenes of fighting, bombing, Hitler (Sauron), factories, soldiers and all this between Germany (Mordor) and the rest of the world (Shire) is never ending.
J.R.R. Tolkien made clear that he had the idea with the ring, the fight, between good and evil in his head before the war even started. The whole story is strongly linked to the hobbit. All I can say ""what a waste of money!!!"" If your a real fan of the movie please don't buy it !!!!!!!",1017619200,32,595,4.321428571428571
1665486,4,B00005UERJ,"When I saw this tape, I wondered how National Geographic could review what essentially was an epic fantasy stressing good v evil and friendship. They have done an excellent job.
The video explores three points. First, how the degradation of industrial England destroyed the environment of small village life. (a typical Geographic theme: Ecology).
Second, the effect of World War I on the fantasy, mainly in the battle scenes. Readers of LOTR know that one of the major themes is that the heroes do not seek glory on the battlefield, but when it is required, they do indeed heroically fight. It also points out how the war democratized Tolkein's view of the then stratified British society.
Third, it points out the roots of the fantasy in Finnish poetry.
For those who dismiss LOTR as a childish fantasy, this exploration on the cutural and intellectual basis explores why this epic tale has such a hold on so many people of different backgrounds.",1017532800,9,948,4.894409937888199
1665487,3,B00005UERJ,"This documentary was interesting, but definitely not what I expected. It's not of the movie or books, but rather about how the imaginary world of Middle Earth reflects our own world. If you are expecting a documentary with behind the scenes footage, the making of the films, or snippets of the next two movies and stuff to that extent you may be disappointed. However if your a Tolkien fan you'll love this documentary. It explores how Tolkien created the mythical characters and world and how they compare to our world (Read the back cover to learn more of what it's about). So the bottom line is: I suggest renting or borrowing it from the library, but if you are a Tolkien fan this is a perfect treasure to add to your bookshelf.

It was really well researched, but there were no interviews with Tolkien of any kind. One would have thought that some insight from Christopher, his son and editor of the Silmarillion, would have been included in this, but it wasn't.
There was never any mention that the story of Bilbo Baggins was a story he told to his kids, and because they liked it so much, he began to write it down.
I found out more about Tolkien by reading the CD sleeves of the radio dramatization of LOTR (ISBN 0553456539) than I did with this DVD, I feel completely jipped.
If you want to see it, I recommend renting it. It's not worth adding to your collection.",1016323200,34,801,4.493150684931507
1665490,2,B00005UERJ,". . .which would have, in all probability, greatly angered the Professor.
JRR Tolkien, author of the beloved bestsellers ""The Hobbit"" and ""The Lord of the Rings"" was also a professional academic -- one who hated allegory; attempts to deconstruct works of literature based on conceptions about the author; biography in general, etc.  Recognizing, as he did, that biography was inevitable, his estate kept careful control over who would provide biographical material, what would be released, and how much applicability should be made between himself and his fictional works.
While I greatly respect ""National Geographic"" this is an attempt at deconstructionalist analysis which would not have been appreciated by the author were he yet alive.  In his ""Letters"" he stated quite clearly that while there was certainly ""applicability"" between his writing and events in the 20th century, ""The Lord of the Rings"" was NOT meant to tell the same story.  While the care of the environment was important to Tolkien, he was not an environmentalist as that word is now commonly used.  Tolkien was a conservative, Roman Catholic, monarchist -- and any attempt to portray him as an environmentalist, an anti-war activist, etc. is just not academically honest or accurate.  (Yes, Tolkien would have horrified at the politics of many of his fans in the 1960's and beyond!)
Read the books, enjoy the movie, but pass this film up.  If you are interested in serious Tolkien scholarship (rather than faddishness and fandom) allow me to recommend ""A Tolkien Compass"" and ""England and Always"" by Jared Lobdell as a good starting place.",1015804800,31,1612,5.157088122605364

1665495,3,B00005UERJ,"If they'd clung to the subject material, this could have been a GREAT documentary. As it is, it is flawed and mediocre, with some bright bits. Unfortunately, heavy-handed messages sometimes take over the narrative, rather than allowing us to hear about Tolkien and LOTR.

The first half is pretty good. We hear a basic outline of the premise, stuff about the hobbits and Middle-Earth and the making of the movie -- including clips from Jackson, Elijah Wood, Orlando Bloom, Billy Boyd, Ian McKellen, Liv Tyler, and Sean Astin. We also hear about some of the things that shaped Tolkien's experiences for LOTR, such as his fighting in WWI and the destruction of little rural communities when he was a child. Also some production stuff, such as the descriptions of creating Hobbiton and Orlando Bloom waxing eloquent about his long-knives.

But then the documentary starts to unravel. We hear about the Kalevala - but hardly anything about how it affected Elvish. Lots of preachiness about the vanishing languages of the world, followed by a giant tract about modern enviromentalism, which gives the feel of a modern P.C. spin.

Very little about the heroes in the story is mentioned - they talk vaguely about Frodo, but literally nothing about Sam! How far would Frodo have gotten without Sam? Two miles? Three?  Tolkien's religion was another great shaping force on LOTR, yet it doesn't get a word. Why not cut the tree-hugger monologue and include something about the moral structure of Middle-Earth, or the theological hierarchy? It's only one of the ways in which this documentary approaches Tolkien's work ALL WRONG.

However... if you are in withdrawal for PJ's live-action film, and can't wait for the DVD release next summer, then you might want this. It includes some great footage from the film (and one or two snippets of Two Towers): We see Legolas receiving his Lothlorien bow, the ""fiery letters"" scene, just about everything in the birthday party, the adorable ""ask Rosie for a dance!"" Frodo-Sam interaction, and Gandalf's first scene.

Overall, watch this if you don't mind a deadly-dull second half after a delightful first half, and some irrelevent stuff after hearing about the movie production.",1015200000,22,2211,5.043835616438356

If this movie is supposed to be about the influences that shaped J.R.R.

Lewis and Tolkien's family life (the fact that he wrote much of his material for his wife and children) are completely ignored. Instead, the folks at National Geographic seem to have opportunistically decided to glob onto the success of the Lord of the Rings movie in order to push a left-wing anti-capitalism environmental agenda. For sheer pretentiousness, the ending in which we are asked the rhetorical question ""Who will be the ringbearer?"", takes the cake - it sure sent my gag reflexes into overdrive.",1014940800,48,891,5.027027027027027
1665497,4,B00005UERJ,"This National Geographic Beyond the Movie is a great companion piece to the movie. Though the video has a strong ecological and environmental message (it's a National Geographical piece after all), the video does much more than examine the conservationism of Tolkien. In fact, the main purpose of the video is not environmentalism, but an examination of how the fantasy world of Middle Earth that Tolkien created was rooted in the realities of our own world.
Tolkien strongly stated several times throughout his life that THE LORD OF THE RINGS was not a modernist fable or allegory about the World Wars or Industrialism vs. Agriculture or anything like that. THE LORD OF THE RINGS is simply a story; one of the greatest and most detailed fictional stories of all time perhaps, but a story nonetheless. However, THE LORD OF THE RINGS was influenced by all that had affected Tolkien in his life. This special illustrates how some of those events inspired THE LORD OF THE RINGS: how the rural agricultural area where Tolkien was raised helped inspire the Shire; how WWI influenced Tolkien's view and description of the War of the Ring; how the endangered Finnish language helped Tolkien create the Elvish language.
The tape includes interviews with lots of people including one of Tolkien's remaining living friends, Tolkien scholars, linguistic experts, anthropologists, environmentalists, actors on the set of THE LORD OF THE RINGS, and even Peter Jackson himself. There is quite a bit of archival footage (for a 60 minute tape) and there are also a few snippets from scenes of the two remaining THE LORD OF THE RINGS movies to be released.
The documentary went into a great detail discussing how various elements and events affected Tolkien's grand epic. However, there was one very important part of Tolkien's life that affected THE LORD OF THE RINGS, that the video did not even mention. The tape does not mention anything at all about Tolkien's devout Christian faith. Though Tolkien firmly stated that THE LORD OF THE RINGS was not a Christian allegory (like many of the writings of his good friend C.S. Lewis), he never denied that his faith played a role in what he wrote and how he wrote it. Tolkien's faith was the most important part of his life and to not even acknowledge the importance it played is shameful.
Overall an enjoyable special great for any THE LORD OF THE RINGS fan, Tolkien fan, and anyone interested in learning more about J.R.R. Tolkien.",1014681600,50,2464,4.911270983213429
1665498,3,B00005UERJ,"First off, let me say that there is a lot of content in this DVD about Tolkien's influences, and this is a tremendous help in thinking about The Lord of the Rings. WWI, WWII, Beowulf, and the Kalevala were all important influences, and like most literature, the Lord of the Rings can be somewhat mysterious without knowing about it's cultural groundings. As such, this video will be of tremendous value for the uninitiated.
My frustration with this video stems from the fact that it mentions a number of these connections, tourbook style, without exploring any of them in any depth. For example, the video mentions Beowulf as an influence, but fails to explain *what* it influences or where you can find its signature in Lord of the Rings. It mentions Tolkien's experience in World War I, but fails to explain *how* it influenced his work. And it also fails to look more than superfically at the complex relationship between Lord of the Rings and WWII (yes, Tolkien denied that the Lord of the Rings was an allegory for WWII, but was very careful not to say that the Lord of the Rings was not influenced by or not applicable to WWII).
Additionally, I feel National Geographic has hijacked the Lord of the Rings for some of their favorite causes in this video. There is a very long segment on the Kalevala which never touches on its revelance to Tolkien, but does tell us that languages are dying out and they should be saved as they have cultural significance. Doubtless true. There is another long and melodramtic piece at the end, which compares an environmentalist's 1000-mile trek through Africa to get some publicity for the flora and fauna endangered by man's activities to the journey of Frodo, which seemed a little grandiose to me (whether or not there were hordes of armed men trying to kill him, or whether he ran any serious risks at all, is not mentioned). The thing is, while the Lord of the Rings certainly preaches the good of the natural world, environmentalism is not one of it's root values in my opinion (the mining, manufacturing, worldly-good-obsessed Dwarves are stalwart good guys whom Sauron could not corrupt, after all. None of the book on Tolkien that I've read have seriously mentioned environmentalism as a theme in the same was as they have for, say, Stephen R. Donaldson's Covenant books). Alan Lee ends the DVD with a pitch for saving the environment and ending war by asking ""who will be the ring-bearer?"".
Despite the apparent obviousness of the Good vs. Evil and Evil vs. Nature themes, Tolkein's work is one of amazing depth and subtelty and to try to apply such black-and-white interpretations does not do the book (or movie!) a service. Frodo would never have made it 10 miles without his friends, the Fellowship, the gifts of Galadriel and Bilbo, the hospitality of Elrond, Faramir and Tom Bombadil, or the sacrifice of Gollum (just to pick a few); not to mention that he rose to the challenge of a task thrust upon him. To apply such simplistic metaphors to a work of the depth of the Lord of the Rings is dangerous.
Now, it may sound like I'm coming down pretty hard on the video, and it's true that it could have been a heck of a lot better. However, despite these flaws, the video is still quite a good introduction to Tolkien's influences. However, I highly recommend you follow it up with a read of T.A. Shippey's excellent and highly readable ""J.R.R. Tolkien : Author of the Century"".

Some of the things presented in this production are contradicted by other sources - mainly about JRR's war experiences influencing the books.  The section about ""modern day Frodos"" was a bit over the top for me, getting a little too ""tree hugger-ish"" for the over all theme.  The sections about the loss of language and oral history was interesting, but I still felt like I was being preached to.
There are other DVDs available through Amazon.com which cover Tolkien's life and works rather well, but this is the only work to really touch on Peter Jackson's film.
The video quality was excellent, seeing clips from the movie makes me anxious for the DVD to be released.  There's even some snippets from the next two films.  I would have liked to see more of the 'Making of' and cast interviews and less of the 'horros of tropical deforestation'  this is not the place for that sort of material.

In addition, it delves into how the movie was created including how some scenes were modeled after events in Tolkien's life.  I was afraid that having a look into the things that influenced the writing of the LOTR might take some of the magic out of the story for me.  But, in fact, the opposite happened.

He discovered that England was robbed of their early legends & history through 5th & 6th century invasions.  Tolkien decided to re-create an entire world including an Elven Language (both written & spoken) which revolved around England & its mystical past using ancient castles & landmarks as references.
