8391971,3,B00395ATJ0,"First off, this is not an action film.  Nor is it a gangster film.  And it's not a story of revenge.  This is actually a conventional family drama. And that's not a bad thing.  But you'd never suspect that by the gun-wielding fellow on the cover and the movie description.  The story revolves around an unsuccessful criminal who gets thrown into prison for eight years and his older brother, who is achieving success on the outside with his drug-dealing business.  Trouble starts when the older brother takes advantage of the imprisoned brother's wife.  This is not a terrible movie.  The villain is well-done so you kind of want to see his comeuppance.  But the pacing is a bit on the slow side.  And the cinematography has the feel of a made-for-TV movie.  The actors are all very good.  I can't slam this movie because I like to support indie movies and I believe the actors all deserve a chance to go onto bigger projects.  But if you're looking for a fast-paced revenge thriller, this is not that kind of movie.",1409961600,3,1016,4.5777777777777775
