8482417,5,B005P7UC9W,"Perhaps it's just me, but I really love this film. It's not all about action or even the most compelling of story lines, but if you're a shy, lonesome kid that always finds yourself having no luck with women and have a love for Bruce Lee then this is the film for you. A nice little gem.",1348531200,,287,4.052631578947368
8482418,5,B005P7UC9W,"Once Upon A Time In High School is a South Korean drama with martial arts elements; when I say ""martial arts elements"", I don't mean Bruce Lee or Donnie Yen level of fighting, instead it holds the messages of legendary martial artists Bruce Lee and Jeet Kun Do. (It does have fight scenes, though.) As for the story, it follows Hyun-soo as he transfers to a new school filled with violence involving the gangster students and the abusive teachers. He also falls into a vicious love triangle involving his new best friend. It's really is much more than a high school drama....

First, I thought the story was great; the acting significantly contributes to the authenticity and flow of the movie. It's easily a film many people can relate to, whether it's the harsh bullying or romantic difficulties that are still relevant today. Hyun-soo's story is inspirational, especially when he starts to train like Bruce Lee. So, the story has action, drama, romance, comedy and it all blends very well; I particularly loved the Bruce Lee impressions by the students, they were fun and respectful. The fights are intense and realistic; there amateurish, but that's how they're supposed to be because they're in high school; the last fight is Hyun-Soo with his Nunchaku versus 10 (or so) students, and it's thrilling and well done. Also, the music is great and matches the film.

Overall, Once Upon A Time In High School is a well-made drama that is easily relatable and, more importantly, is very entertaining. It holds significant messages and should be seen if you get the chance. As of 9/23/12, this film is available on Netflix Streaming, but a purchase is also highly recommended.

Once Upon A Time In High School has violence and blood (many fist-fights, and physical punishment from teachers), and a very brief sex scene. (no nudity, more of an attempt to have sex than anything.)",1348358400,,1876,4.85625
8482419,5,B005P7UC9W,"Inspired by his movie hero (and mine), Bruce Lee, a South Korean teenager decides he has been bullied enough at school and turns to Lee's brand of martial arts to make his stand.
If you get turned off by the amount of abuse this kid and his friends go through, do this ---check out You Tube and the number of videos devoted to real life school violence and teen suicides. I did and immediately enrolled my 14-year old nephew in a neighbhood martial arts school.
All it took was one altercation at school and the bullies left my nephew alone, never bothered him again. Word got around that he was the wrong boy to mess with.
God bless martial arts and Bruce Lee!",1337990400,,661,4.382113821138211
