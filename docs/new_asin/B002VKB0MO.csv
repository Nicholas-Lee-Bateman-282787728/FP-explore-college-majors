Little did I know at the time that her show was ""new"" on HBO and no DVD was out (yet). As soon as I found it on Amazon, I pre-ordered right away. I CANNOT wait to get it and watch the full show. I bet that I could burn as many calories laughing at her jokes as I can being at the gym for an hour!!

She's a parent now, she looks healthy and at peace. She is married again, but this time doesn't seem in such a hurry to call it quits. The relationship is less fodder for the stage, more like glimpses into love's little infuriations. She is older and wiser. Don't worry! She's still got a fire wit and razor tongue. But she's doing it all with love. You can see it at the end. She's feeling truly blessed, true gratitude. That is a real artist. Can't wait to see her next role, show, special. Whatever it i, it's always a delight to see Wanda again.",1456790400,,697,4.453125

3999693,2,B002VKB0MO,"Wanda Sykes' delivery reminds me of a gay and female Chris Rock.  But unlike him, nothing she says is cutting edge.  I'd even call her act hackneyed.  Her entire act is about being black and loving Obama and her observations make Jay Leno look downright incisive.  She either lacks basic knowledge or she's intentionally tailoring her act to her vapid white middle class audience..  (that's the kind version of what I was gonna say!)

She does move on to other topics later in her special, but it just wasn't very good.  Ninety percent of her appeal is her deliver I think, because the actual stuff she was saying was pretty uninspired.  Once every five minutes she says something worthwhile, but god did I find her act tedius.  Perhaps if she didn't direct her standup to the kind of people that I really don't like, I'd be more receptive to her.  I had the same problem with Stephen Colbert.  In real life Wanda Sykes is probably very funny.  But her act isn't.",1440892800,,963,4.567251461988304

Once or twice she was WAY over the PC line, so be forewarned. I didn't mind it, but there's was more shock value than humor sometimes. It might have been funnier several years ago.

OTOH, there's some real comedy gold here, and it's definitely worth a view. Like George Carlin, half the show is Wanda's presence and delivery, not simply the funny content. Stuff that normal people would try to say and fall flat doing it becomes hilarious when a comic genius delivers it, and Wanda is a comedic genius. Make no mistake about that.

Given my proclivity for darker movies, my penchant for comedy has never truly grown, but I do enjoy some more innovative presentations.  I saw this piece and frankly it does belong on Prime since it is free to watch.  Wanda Sykes being described as anything but a shrill plagiarizer of tired and hackneyed humor is to bestow upon her a moniker she is unworthy to hold.  I am frankly amazed that people out here state that they love her humor.  How is it that one running gag for the past decade or so is now considered some sort of valid oeuvre where she illustrates her ability to reinvent herself?  All this woman does is scream and ratchet her voice to intolerable decibels to spew stereotypical and offensive  invectives that are more inane than anything resembling clever.  With pearls like black people they know about being broke, Michael Jackson died of Michael Jackson,  and menevery other commercial is for broke dickevery other commercial.  This is not a woman who reflects society, nor do we require her special and self-ascribed brand of social commentary.  Wanda is yet another in a long line of comedians who was in the right place in the right time and gained a quasi-following because of others talents rather than her own.  She is unlistenable and this opinion is far more aligned with her sets rather than her voice.",1433635200,2,1420,4.704453441295547

4000555,5,B002VKB0MO,"From word one, this special with Wanda is just laugh out loud funny.  I didn't think it was offensive at all, as some have said. It was within context.  Part of who this woman is, and what she has done so well.  If the ""N"" or ""F"" words offend then don't watch.  IMO, this act was classic Wanda, a bit treacly and more than a tad some sort of ""ist"" person- I just don't care, her material is a hoot!  She's bold, brave, totally gorgeous, with a sense of humor which ignites watchers, and invites them in to share the fun.  My personal standing ovation goes out to her. About halfway in, I had to stop to catch my breath, from laughing so hard!
I may have broken a rib or two............Yeah, Wanda rocks!!!",1432771200,2,705,4.223880597014926
4000556,1,B002VKB0MO,"I'm sorry but if this is what passes for comedy, I must have a very different sense of humor. I was SO disappointed because I think Wanda Sykes IS hilarious - she's done some great bits in movies (my favorite being Monster-in-Law, in which she really takes the cake and almost overshadows Jane Fonda with her acerbic delivery of snarkasm) and I also really liked Sick and Tired. But this one is just so bad that I couldn't even get all the way through.

If you watch any kind of stand up comedy, you pretty much have to steel yourself against some pretty abusive language - that seems to be par for the course (although Gabriel Iglesias - one of my faves - keeps it to a minimum). But when you have someone throwing out the N word repeatedly, that's just bad - I don't care who you are or what color your skin is, that is NOT an appropriate word. I was really appalled that a comedienne that I generally enjoy and think is undervalued and underrepresented would stoop so low.",1432598400,3,975,4.357142857142857

My only negative comment is that she used a couple of jokes from the Correspondents Dinner. I feel like I shouldn't have to pay for something you just gave me for free, but maybe that's just me. Wanda Sykes is hilarious without having to be excessive like Monique, Adele Givens, etc. I'm still a fan of theirs but they are a bit too much sometimes.

Bottom line: If you're already a Wanda Sykes fan, no need to be concerned, just click ""buy"" right now. If you've never hear her before, this won't be your last time buying her DVD.",1367712000,,617,4.273504273504273

The best parts are when she talkes about Michelle and Barack Obama living in the White House, what to say or not to say at her first correspondents dinner, the pirates off the coast of Africa and her own experiences with hair waxing!
Wanda is simply crazy funny and one great story teller.  So down to earth, so real, so right on.

Filmed in Washington, D.C. this performance deals with the politics of today, our new President, the first lady but the funniest and most poignant parts of the show are about Wanda herself. She comes out of the closet and talks about aging, married life, her children and the daily complications that her new life creates. I love stand-up comedy and Wanda Sykes is one of the best comedians of the new millenium. She always brings something fresh to each of her acts and this one ranks at the top. The title of I'MA BE ME is absolutely on the mark. She is proud of her life, her accomplishments and she isn't afraid to share that with her audience.",1351641600,5,798,4.707142857142857

Even though it's now a couple of years old and the political jokes aren't what they probably were when it was still brand-new, it's still funny. Wanda's a great stand-up comic and the camera work on this live performance in Washington DC is terrific. It's one of those DVDs that you can watch repeatedly and still find the humor.

Wanda Sykes is funny on so many levels, as a woman, as a lesbian, as an African American and most importantly just as an observer of life. I've never been such a great fan of her before, but she deserves an Emmy for this performance.

For me to get to the post office on a saturday (they are closed by the time i get home from work) and mail it back to amazon is a pain. amazon should just send another, they should realize their customer-base won't bother returning it... maybe they already do.",1292544000,,554,4.186915887850467
4000628,4,B002VKB0MO,"Wanda Sykes is just hilarious and constantly keeps you laughing throughout.  This is her second comedy special for HBO done in 2009 and she comments on Barack Obama's presidency, her new life in a interracial lesbian marriage, Bikini waxing and being a performer on a all gay cruise ship with 3,200 couples.  She is amazingly funny, honest and provocatively rough around the edges.  Her ability to entertain is enormous and she is a strong and fearless woman.  Wanda has much strength to admire, sharp wit to enjoy and it all comes out in fearless comedy.",1282348800,5,555,4.810526315789474
4000629,5,B002VKB0MO,"This is a wonderful treat for Wanda fans.  It is not for the faint of heart, but nothing that she does is ever rated ""G"".  She makes fun of herself as well as gay folks, political types, children...  It is a laugh out loud balst.",1281312000,,229,4.044444444444444

I am a 76 year old retired white educator who has NEVER written a Fan Letter in her entire life. Wanda Sykes is the BEST comedian EVER. This DVD of a recent event proves my opinion. Her event was over an hour long without a single break, not even for a sip of water. Her topics are current and extremely original. One simply cannot hold back laughter even when watching her in an empty room with only two cats for company. I sing Wanda's praises to all who will listen!

I look forward to her amazing future in comedy.

We are all foder for her scrutiny and it is refreshingly funny...and true!! I'd love to hang out with her!! So funny! Not a DVD for kids, so put them to bed and sit back and be prepared to LOL....

8382273,5,B002VKB0MO,"Love Wanda Sykes. First half of this show was excellent about politics during the Obama era and the second half was okay about her personal experiences.  In the middle of this show, this amazing woman talks about her coming out to her family as being gay and how she pokes fun at how it is not much different than if she had to come out to her family as being black.  It was a nice juxtaposition between being gay and being black, both are things she cannot change about herself, yet her family or anyone will offer two different reactions.  This is definitely a show for adult audiences, but if it wasn't for the adult language, young people would enjoy it too.  Very intelligent woman.  Great show!",1521590400,,700,4.480314960629921
