8340697,1,B001T79XU6,"I dislike this video a great deal. The songs chosen are, in my opinion, terrible and not very motivating. The worst though is that they talk WAY TOO MUCH. I can't stand it when someone is constantly chattering. They think they are motivating you but all the do is really make me angry.  They are so fake in their interest to help you. I'll just jake my own playlist from now on.",1393459200,,378,4.25
8340698,1,B001T79XU6,"If you are looking for a spinning dvd, forget about this one.  The price is way too expensive.  Get it at spinning.com for $14.00 only.",1349827200,,135,4.36
8340699,5,B001T79XU6,"Great motivational and workout DVD.  This one will really get your heart pumping and jumping.  Great music and also motivation by the trainers.  Wonderful workout. Had a great time doing it, and still do.",1327795200,,204,4.9411764705882355
8340700,1,B001T79XU6,"I've got 8 videos from this spinning series (Mad Dogg/Spinning.com). I enjoy the other ones and they are good workouts, but this one is pretty lame. Spin & Burn's music selection is pretty bad and music volume is low. I prefer pumping music that helps to drive your pace and ""pump"" you up to. Mike Michels is one of the instructors and he's great. Josh Taylor is good coach, but duct-taping his mouth periodically would be a benefit. On and On about how special spinning is, we get it! On newer videos featuring Josh...he's toned it down quite a bit. But he's an excellent trainer and knows his stuff. Louise Hernandez is the third instructor/trainer in this video, they all 3 ride side-by-side switching leading the class back n forth. Louise I could do without and if I never saw her in another video it would be great. Maybe it's me, but she comes off as smug and condescending. Only thing she moved me to do was TURN OFF this video and put something else in!

Only other video of spinning.com/Mad Dogg that is poor is the Johnny G one. The Spin & Burn video may be OK for someone who just got a spinning bike and knows nothing, but for anyone with a bit of experience...SKIP THIS ONE, DON'T WASTE YOUR $24. I tried to return this video but wasn't allowed to exchange it...basically wasted the $24.",1295222400,,1301,4.466386554621849

8340702,5,B001T79XU6,"I never had a spinning class before and heard about spinnig from my friend ......she has been struglling to shape her body and after a few spininng classes we were all wondering about her secret .
i didn't have time to go to a class so i went ahead and bought this dvd and i am in love .... its a very clear program with many guide lines to help and i love that they right all the instruction on the screen so after a few times training with them i can now play my own motivating music and follow them along",1269820800,3,507,3.980392156862745
8340703,5,B001T79XU6,"This is a great DVD for beginners allowing you to be challenged while having fun at the same time. The instructors are very motivational and extremely helpful with techniques, especially for a ""beginner spinner"" like me.",1207180800,11,220,5.138888888888889
