A fare warning though, this an incredible collection of videos from Tom Petty but it only covers their work up until Mary Janes last dance. There is nothing from any releases after greatest hits.

So many great little moments--Ringo Starr, George Harrison, and Jeff Lynne join Petty & the band on one number (whose name now escapes me).

And who can forget Johnny Depp and Faye Dunaway on the ""Into The Great Wide Open"" video?? Amazing! If you loved watching Petty's videos back in the 80's, you will enjoy this DVD!",1126483200,6,501,4.758620689655173

734042,4,630386340X,"""Video Killed the Radio Star"" was the name of the first video ever played on MTV.
Twenty years later we know that this bold prediction is not true. Music videos, which
took the recording industry by storm and created a whole new entertainment medium are
today, slowly sinking into obscurity.
Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers ""Playback"" is a case in point. Few would argue with the
quality of the music. Opening with a 1979 cut of ""Here Comes My Girl"" and closing with
1993's ""Mary Janes's Last Dance"", this DVD evolves chronologically through some of
the great pop songs of the past twenty-five years.
As a big Tom Petty fan, It's hard to be unbiased. I like every cut on the DVD. In fact, I
love most of them! After a single viewing of this disk, anyone born after 1950 will
appreciate the way that this southern rocker from the 70's grows into one of the great
songwriters and performers of the 80's and 90's.
The videos themselves are a different story. They range in quality from the genius,
""Don't Come Around Here No More"", to the atrocious, ""Runnin' Down A Dream"".
Perhaps I'm getting old, but in seems that visual stimulation does nothing to enhance the
music.
What these videos do however, is tell the story of why MTV and the music video industry
are in decline. The early offerings from the disk are from the late `70's and early `80's
and they are great! They include concert style cuts and simple visuals. ...Then this new
art form got ahead of itself. The mid `80's had great Petty songs, but the video producers
seemed to be in a race to see who could be the most abstract and absurd. They attempt to
tell stories that have nothing to do with the music.
In a mater of four or five years the great MTV phenomenon evolved into a series of two
or three second visual bytes that are hard on the senses and distract from the very song
that they are meant to enhance. ...Darwin was wrong. At least when it comes to music
videos, evolution is not always for the better.
If you like Tom Petty, buy this DVD! But of course, you already knew that. If on the
other hand, you are wondering what ever happened to music videos, rent this DVD and
see how poor visual effects can hurt great music and be a real Heartbreaker.

734043,3,630386340X,"This is a really great video, with really great songs, but when you watch a whole lot of Tom Petty, and look past that twinkle in his eye and the humor, and the macho rock n roll, you find that he's lacking a certain warmth.  He's good at being mad.  He's good at being sardonic.  But.  It's hard to connect to the cockles of his heart.  He's a bit cool and a bit remote and he doesn't let you into his ribs, and into his brain and bones, all the way.  Not like Lennon and McCartney (in their prime), or Morrisson, did.  Petty is clever, amusing, fun, interesting and he's got a lot of tricks.  But.  There's not a lot of poetry in what he does and he's a bit of a sphinx.  Is he a sphinx without a secret though?",1039046400,3,713,3.99290780141844
734044,4,630386340X,"...I hope they re-release these videos at some point and re-master them while they're at it. Even though this is a DVD, the videos are grainy and not that much better quality than the VHS version. And as others have mentioned, the sound is only plain stereo. They could tack on some of the videos Tom Petty has done since 1995, too, like You Don't Know How It Feels and It's Good To Be King.
That being said, this is an amazing collection featuring some of the best music videos ever made. If you have ever watched MTV in the era before 1996, you've seen at least a few of them. They're classics and it's great having them on DVD!",1011571200,,630,4.258333333333334
734045,5,630386340X,"If there is any artist who should be nominated the poet laureate of California, Tom Petty would be it... I didn't know until I picked up this video that MTV had made a Video Vanguard Award just for him, because he invented the music video and the MTV! Perhaps in a successful attempt to promote his band (as any fans of Heartbreakers would know he did relentlessely), he took what was then a promotional format for musicians to advertise their music and turned it into an new art form. It was on the strength of his vison and talent as an artist that he was able to attract the best and the brightest, film directors, supermodels and artists to participate in his videos. Whether its' Johnny Depp or Kim Basinger in a dedidedly non-traditional role, or whether its film directors and video animation special effects people, they all worked together to create this incredible collection of videos.
The tape covers a variety of styles, from stage perfomances to animation, to mini films, which was how he conceptualized his videos. What unites most of his work, however, is that it was inspird by the California experience. You can see it in many incarnations. Whether it's the sixties in Learning to fly, and he gets it right, going back all the way to the engineers that flocked to California to work on militray aircraft design and their children, who turned to hippies or whther its the vagaries of being a present day celebrity or the malls, or the politics and power of the ranchers of old in his Insider song, Tom Petty celebrates much and misses little of what is California, while sidestepping the usual cliches of surfers and new age glitter that one usually associates with California.",1009497600,22,1694,4.726351351351352

The only problem I have is that when I received the product, the disc wasn't attached to the inside of the case allowing for it to have free movement during shipping which could have resulted in some of the scratches on the disc. The p[roduct still worked as it should have and the content on this DVD was spectacular.

All in all, this may be a petty complaint because it could have been a total accident and I will not take off a star because it did not take away the quality of the dvd because dvd players have gotten so much better over the years.

A great collection of his best hits. Might have left out a few that came after, but I cannot recall them.
My only complaint is the sound quality.
It should be ""re-mastered"" or whatever for better sound quality. If they do that I would definitely buy another copy as long as the sound was much improved. I want the music to sound the same way it does on the CDs.
My favorite videos from this collection are ""Free Fallin'"" and ""Learning to Fly"".
In Learning to Fly, I remember MTV would air this and the censors would completely miss the topless girl in body paint dancing and writhing on the video. I used to get a chuckle from that.
And in Free Fallin', the video is prophetic with its visual of all the American cars on a California highway turning into Japanese imports.",1329868800,5,863,4.468354430379747

around Here No More"" and in the 90's when I saw the one for ""Mary
Jane's Last Dance"". The first was one of the greatest takes on Alice
in Wonderland that I have ever seen and the second was unforgetable
because it had Kim Basinger in it. All these videos were made
wonderfully and have stood the test of time. This DVD is a must have
for any fan of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers. All these are
rememebered now and will be remembered 30 years from now. That is
what sets it apart from the crap that MTV puts out today. All the

734334,5,630386340X,"I was surprised at how good this DVD video collection of Tom Petty turned out to be.  You know, some artists have some great songs but really lame videos (Billy Joel, The Police, Rush, INXS, Bruce Springsteen), but then there are some artists who have better videos than their songs (Bjork, Sade, Supertramp, Kate Bush, Abba, Genesis, Weird Al Yankovic).  But, this DVD collection from Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers really caught me off guard.  I enjoy the hell out of every video here.  I've even taken to enjoy some songs more now that I've seen the video that compliments the song.

I never realized before how Tom Petty has such a unique sense of humor.  I thought he was just another punk rebel when he first started out.  But....No!  He's quite an influence to all that what MTV came to be.  He's quite a genius and definitely has a right to be working with Jeff Lynne, George Harrison, Bob Dylan, and Roy Orbison (remember The Traveling Wilbury's?).

I was already interested in the song and video of ""Don't Come Round Here No More"".  But, I was amazed at what else we have here.  ""Jammin' Me"" is an awesome song and video.  And then there is ""I Won't Back Down"" which definitely sounds very George Harrison influenced.  And why not?  George Harrison, Ringo Starr and Jeff Lynne are all on this song and video.  Really Cool!  Plus there's ""Into the Great Wide Open"" which is a video with Johnny Depp and Faye Dunaway which makes you think it came from some film.  Same goes for Kim Basinger in his video of ""Mary Jane's Last Dance"".

Too bad there isn't any videos here for ""Breakdown"", ""Don't Do Me Like That"", ""Stop Draggin' My Heart Around"" (with Stevie Nicks) or ""You Don't Know How it Feels.""  Tom Petty does have a video here with Stevie Nicks called ""Insider.""  It's kinda okay.

Well, this DVD is definitely a welcomed addition to my music DVD library.  I have people to share this with who I know are going to love it.  You can party with one.  Crank it up!",1181779200,,1975,4.495774647887324
734335,4,630386340X,"It goes without saying that Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers were at the forefront of the music video from its emergance as a popular means of getting your record wider exposure to being afforded many accolades and respect for contributions to the medium.

If Tom and the Heartbreakers had a hit video they would have a hit record. This collection begins with the early band orientated performance videos from the Damn The Torpedoes period. The ""You Got Lucky"" video is very notable in that it was decided to film a little intro before the song started. Not even Michael Jackson did that at the time. By the close of the 80's Tom's videos were not to be missed, they were appealing, well crafted just as the bands songs were. ""Don't Come around Here No More"" gained wide popular acclaim.

5 videos came from the Full Moon Fever period which no suprise went hand in hand with Tom's resurgance in the late 80's that continued into the 90's where the collection finishes.

""Into the Great Wide Open"" features Johnny Depp and Faye Dunaway. Petty was offered to make the video into a feature film. It was already was the reply.

The award winning ""Mary Jane's Last Dance"" featured Kim Basinger providing something different and sinister to the Petty video collection.

This collection stops there, covering only the MCA years. Petty and the band continued to release videos, until recently, as part of Petty's stance as an artist who will not be taken advantage off for financial gain, he has ceased filming these videos for his singles.
