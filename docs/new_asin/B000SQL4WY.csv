I always think of them as Veggies who are like  Billy Graham. He has never wavered from his message. Veggie Tales have not either.  I was visiting my daughter when one of my Grandson was around 9 months old. This is 17 years ago. He was sitting  in front of the television as we visited on the couch.  He was clapping to the ""I lost my hair brush "" song. Then one of my  favorites tomatoes  came on and my little grandson pointed at the television and said ""Bob""!  and giggled and kept saying Bob. I never forgot that. Except for the two oldest, all my grandchildren have been raised on the wonders of Veggie Tales . I purchased this for my first Great Grandson.

I searched this out after my son and I saw the Pirates Who Don't Do Anything song on youtube. We got the movie of the same name which, surprisingly and very disappointingly, didn't have it's namesake song on it so I went on a quest to find it. On this release, I found it twice since there are two discs and the Pirate song and others are on both. It is family friendly and fun for everyone.

2889796,5,B000SQL4WY,My Kids LOVE music! And since they are still a bit young to sit through a whole Veggie Tales episode (3 and 1) I thought this would be a great addition to our DVD collection. I was right! My 3yr old has quite a few songs memorized now and we'll sing them when out and about. We'll even take the DVD on the road with us to listen to the songs in the car. Or do the same in the house to dance around instead of sitting in front of the TV for the whole show.

A few months after we got the St. Nicolas movie, I had reached my limit of watching it so I decided to get another Veggie Tales DVD for my daughter.  My daughter loves music so I thought the Very Silly Songs/Ultimate Silly Song countdown would be perfect for her.

She has really enjoyed it.  The songs are catchy and of course silly which makes it fun.

My only disappointment in buying it was that there are several songs that are on both DVDs (and there isn't any variation in them - they are exactly the same).",1283212800,3,635,4.302521008403361
