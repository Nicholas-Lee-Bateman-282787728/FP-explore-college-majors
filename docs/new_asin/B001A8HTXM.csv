8326252,5,B001A8HTXM,"Great satire!

The new 'Yugo-American"" grocery store opens in Serbia.  American products galore!  Capitalism, yay!

Jagoda's first day on the job (it is the grand opening of the store).  Poor love-lorn woman.  A catty co-worker swipes a potential boyfriend (a customer) from her.  Disgruntled over this, she refuses to allow an elderly woman to buy strawberries to bake a cake for her grandson at the close of the store.

The next day, Ratnik, in military garb and armed, takes over the store, holds (among others) Jagoda, the catty co-worker, and the owner of the store (a crazed Americo-snob, as opposed to Euro-snob, woman).  The police arrive (the potential boyfriend) and a standoff ensues.  Even the Serbian equivalent to a SWAT team arrives.  A huge crowd gathers, chanting for Ratnik and totally hounding the authorities (who think Ratnik is a terrorist).  As time passes, Jagoda and Ratnik remain in the store... I will not spoil the rest.

I really liked this movie.  It's a slam against consumerism, American capitalism (no, I am not against it at all), and the 'trigger-happy' authorities (which is split into factions) of Serbia.  The crowds root for Ratnick, who stands-up to absurd Capitalism AND Fascism.  Truly great satire.  Even the old sniper is just priceless! (I won't give that away).

Emir Kustirica (director of 'Underground') produced and has a cameo.  You know you're in for a treat if Kustirica has his fingers in it (ok, I love his work, even though he is controversial).

It's not on the level of 'Underground', by far, but it is a pretty slick piece of work from Dusan Milic, who has little cinema work to his name.

Who is right for this movie?  Well, anybody from the ex-Yugoslav states, even old Bloc countries would probably understand the meanings in the movie.  I study Eastern European and Russian culture, so I get it.  I wouldn't expect Americans to truly grasp some of the satiristic elements, but I may be generalizing.

4 1/2 of 5.  The extra 1/2 is for the ending titles musical number (I will not say the piece) which is simply perfect.",1384905600,,2081,4.824362606232294
