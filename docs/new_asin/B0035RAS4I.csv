Scenery drinks some of this up as the film maker compares and contrasts the experiences of film viewers around the globe. One topic appears in each area and that is the idea of relationships, folks from each area discuss how males and females interact. Insightful. The North Korea portion interested me as it appeared there was no minder preventing anything appearing. 'Titanic' was view by multiple groups and discussed.",1519171200,,513,5.119047619047619

The India segment is perhaps most memorable because of the crowds attempting to view the film, the theater's portability, and the visit by Bollywood stars.

One film was about increasing agricultural production and those attending did not appear terribly enthusiastic. The struggling theater in Burkina Faso was an interesting peek into film distribution in that country - the theater picked them up and carried them on the back of motorbikes! The struggling theater in Wyoming showed the routine to keep the theater open - including visits to the local radio station to publicize coming attractions.",1396310400,,933,5.226666666666667
