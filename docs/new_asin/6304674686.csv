7875996,4,6304674686,"Even though this movie was brief(around 50 min) it definately had its share of action, gore, and evil beings like demons.  I would recommend this movie to ANYONE who likes Biohunter, or Wicked City, or movies of that sort. The ending script was VERY well done, and the ending music(when the credits roll) was really cool.  This movie was basically very well done, if you look at everything.  The cover is a feast for the eyes as well.
The only bad part about the movie was ONE thing, it could of been a LITTLE longer.  Enjoy!",1045180800,,525,4.4375
7875997,5,6304674686,"Twilight of the Dark Master is a wonderful piece on good,evil and those stuck between.  Violent and provacative this film takes its time, allowing the audience to learn and understand the motivations of its characters.  In all a beutiful and brilliant piece not suitable for all, but definatly suited for the open minded or lovers of the medium.",1016496000,2,345,4.931034482758621
7875998,4,6304674686,"I had been wanting to watch this anime for some time but didn't want to rashly buy it. Finally I found it at a video store and rented it. Surprisingly enough, I liked it. There wasn't any heavy romance, which I usually look for, and the whole thing was all about violence. Tsumani was a great (and cute) character, probably the best one. His sidekick (whose name I don't know) was a hilarious guy. I wish the story could have been developed more, but all in all it was really good.",1004832000,,481,4.2967032967032965
7875999,5,6304674686,"Okay, just to warn those fans of animes like  Dominion tank police and other silly animes, and also fans of DBZ and battle arena toshinden-type animes THIS IS NOT FOR YOU. The plotline is very dark and twisted, and hard to follow for the (no offense) wacky-anime lovers, however, if you liked X, Ninja scroll, and Vampire Hunter D, then you just may never go back to anything that doesn't have the words ""dark, twilight, demon,or evil"" in the title again.  I cannot express with words the plot in the space provided me, but I can tell you this, Keep both ears open and both eyes on the screen because this anime will have you coming back again and again, not recommended for the kiddies though, let them stick to pokemon. hope I was helpful. bye",985478400,9,745,4.470588235294118
7876000,5,6304674686,"Mix together Vampire Hunter D, Wicked City and Biohenuter for 50 minutes and the result should be Twilight of the Dark Master. Based on the graphic novel, Twilight tells the story of a world in which demons excist. It revolves around Egi, his lover and Tsunami, a man who wants to kill all even though he is one himself (sounds like Vampire Hunter D). So whats wrong with Egi? Egi has transformed into a demon that has gone mad and somehow plays an intricate part in the film (sounds like Biohunter). His lover was first attacked by him and now she wishes to kill him so he'll be happy. Another thing the film boasts from is a somewhat hentai content (sounds like Wicked City). The fight scenes are enough to make Dragonball Z jealous. Animation is very dark, but pretty well drawn. And the dubbing isn't that bad with many familiar voices from other titles. Fans of Vampire Hunter D will quickly take a liking to Tsunami, with his white make up and black lips. Overall, a very nicely done anime that is recommended to all.",983232000,3,1023,4.505376344086022
7876001,5,6304674686,"Ok here is a great anime film for any anime fans out there. Great artistry, this is a beautifully drawn film, with action, but not too much to bore you, or make it the typical ""guy"" film, both males and females can enjoy this film. It has some sexual content so it's not a film recommended for children. Of course, the movie is short and you're left aniticipating more, and wanting more information. I was left wanting more and in a way was left angered that it was only 50 mins. but that's the beauty of it, You're left wanting more (therefore making it a great film, and the creator an intelligent person). Also, if you are a great fan of only action based films such as Battle Arena Toshinden where characters are mainly fighting and little plot is exposed (don't get me wrong, I liked the film/series), this is not the film for you, although it has some gruesome and bloody action, it is not solely based on that.",977011200,4,917,4.4
7876002,4,6304674686,"Twilight of the Dark Master was, in my opinion, a cool movie.  The main character was powerful.  In many movies, heroes and villains get into huge brutal battles, exhibiting phenomenal power but always managing to end with some dramatic finish and/or stalemate.  Not so with this.  Also, the animation was great and the ending very clever.  On the critical side, the movie was too short, leaving some questions unanswered clearly.  I would recommend renting before purchasing, as $20 is a bunch to pay for 50 minutes.",967593600,,517,4.953488372093023
7876003,3,6304674686,"A big thing is that there is no dramatic fights that realy impress you. The hero is just to powerful he just snaps his fingers and POOF, blue sparks come from the enemy and it just vanishes. Realy that's what happens I'm not kidding. The story is strange but you can follow it. This anime has some nudity but quickly turns you off with a demon ripping a her arm off at the elbow. The ending also is strange and leaves you feeling unsatisfied and some what confused. On the good side it does have umm....a twisted strange plot(if you like that kind of thing.)and nice animation but you still cann't get into it very much.",956620800,2,620,4.353448275862069
7876004,3,6304674686,"Twilight of Dark Master is beautifully drawn Anime with very stylish cinematography, resembling that of dramatic Hong Kong action films. Despite its violent and gory content, such stylish quality makes it interesting to watch, in a eccentric, twisted sort of way.  However, I felt the movie was little short with very little story development, leaving not much understanding of the plot or the characters.",944438400,2,405,5.328125
7876005,4,6304674686,"This film really has it all, graphic violence, sex, incest, magic, even some demonology.  Very slick graphics, and a decent script that almost makes sense.  Definitely a must see!",918864000,,179,5.137931034482759
