2883937,5,B000SAGGM8,"Why does this say Howard Zinn? He testified at the trial- but did not make the movie. Along with the dvd ""Hit and Stay""- this is the best documentary on the anti draft actions. We need action like that today- and we get it from groups like Code Pink and the Transform Now Plowshares. Alas, the country slumbers on, stumbling towards reckoning. It will come.",1414454400,2,357,4.507692307692308

2883940,5,B000SAGGM8,"The integrity and courage of the Camden 28 in their opposition to the senseless massacre of Vietnamese people and American soldiers during the Vietnam War is fascinating to watch, as is the Judas deception of one of their own church members and the horrifying consequence to his life, which is almost biblical. This documentary captures, like none other I have ever seen, the moral arc of the universe which MLK Jr. spoke of...that truth does rise to the surface and  things are exposed and real justice prevails. A fascinating and brilliantly edited documentary, especially for those watching the endless wars we are now in and wondering what can be done to stop the lies and deception and war profiteering that keep wars afloat for years. This isn't just a 'historical' documentary-you will be moved to tears by the personal stories within it.",1328918400,,845,4.950704225352113
2883941,5,B000SAGGM8,"I asked Father Michale Doyle to baptize both my children in hopes that his passion for peace and compassion for the poor would influence their lives. Recently, I watched this documentary with my family and asked ""Aren't you proud that Michael Doyle baptized you?"" The answer was a definite yes. This movie is a ""must see"" for those on the spiritual journey. It encourages courage and optimism, but also grounds the viewers in the difficult practicalities of living the honorable life.",1222300800,,484,4.987654320987654
2883942,4,B000SAGGM8,"On August 22, 1971, a group of Vietnam War protesters broke into the draft board offices in Camden, New Jersey, with the intention of destroying files and bringing the selective service process to a halt in that city.  Yet, these were not your stereotypical '60's radicals bent on subverting the government and tearing down the establishment.  Rather, they were thoughtful, deeply religious people (two were priests and one a Protestant minister) acting out of a stern conviction that not only was the war itself immoral but that the draft was inherently iniquitous because it aimed its sites squarely on the poor and underprivileged in the society while allowing the majority of the wealthy to escape unscathed.  Unbeknownst to them, the protestors even had a Judas in their midst - one of their own number who had already informed on them to the FBI, resulting in the arrest, trial and ultimate acquittal of what would come to be known as The Camden 28.

The documentary, ""The Camden 28,"" written and directed by Anthony Giacchino, gathers together many of the original members of the group to reminisce about the break-in and the trial and to reflect on how the event helped to turn the legal tide in favor of war protestors.  For it was at the trial that the Camden 28 came to be seen as advocates for civil liberties who had simply employed the time-honored and deeply American tradition of civil disobedience as a foundation for their actions, making them more akin to abolitionists or the rebels at the Boston Tea Party than to actual criminals - i.e., people more concerned with securing justice than with adhering to the strict letter of the law.  The movie provides ample opportunity for the participants to state their case, interspersed with a generous helping of footage and photos that help to recapture the temper of the times in which all this took place.

Giacchino's sympathies clearly lie with the 28, but he is not averse to examining some of the moral complexities of the issues involved, particularly in regards to Bob Hardy, the informant who was himself an opponent of the war and a part of the ""Catholic Left,"" but who simply felt that his friends were going about their protest in the wrong way.  In fact, not long after the arrests, Hardy switched his allegiance to the other side, testifying in favor of his buddies and against the FBI whom he claims lied to him in assuring him that none of the perpetrators would be placed on trial after their arrests.  Giacchino captures the sense of betrayal many of the 28 felt towards Hardy for what he had done to them, but he also shows how forgiveness and reconciliation have worked to bring about an emotional healing for many of the parties involved (and, indeed, Hardy gets to have his say right along with everybody else).

Though their story is only a very small piece of a much larger fabric, the Camden 28 still inspire us with their unflagging commitment to justice and their willingness to sacrifice all for a cause they believe in.  As one of the prosecutors interviewed for the film states, no matter what one may think of the rightness of this specific action, one must still admire the courage, dedication and moral conviction that motivated them to do what they did.

This is a moving and uplifting film no matter one's political persuasion or stripe.",1210464000,3,3336,4.772569444444445
2883943,5,B000SAGGM8,This fast-moving and suspenseful documentary covers an episode in the history of American civil disobediance that has unfortunately slipped into obscurity. This ought to be required viewing in high schools. It would also be very appropriate for church discussion groups and civic organizations.,1190505600,,294,5.8604651162790695
2883944,4,B000SAGGM8,"During childhood The Vietnam War made a big impression on me.  It was easy to see the controversy in simple terms.  I remember reading posters and lapel buttons.  One poster read, ""War is not healthy for children or other living things,"" yet my childhood recollections were innocent for ""Make love, not war.""  On the other side, I saw bumper stickers exhorting us all to pray for or support our M.I.A.'s and P.O.W.'s.

`The Camden 28' would have been too specific and complicated for me to understand, so it is with greater appreciation I embrace this documentary as an adult.  To be brief, twenty-eight people, mostly consisting of devout Catholics, including two priests, but a few Protestants as well, joined together to plan to infiltrate a government facility in Camden, NJ to steal draft records and burn them as their opposition to the Vietnam War.  Usually the Catholic Church frowns on disobeying secular authority, but these 28 did so with conviction and at great risk.

Clocking in at less than an hour and a half, the film has recent interviews with some of the key participants.  Their memories are sharply honed for detail, and there's plenty of news and ""home movie"" footage to back up their accounts.  'The Camden 28' squares solidly on the titled participants side, but it also features interviews by the key prosecuting and defense attorneys, giving their take on the whole affair.  While I enjoyed their testimony, I also found the amount of material they used and the scope of their focus uses good judgment.  Wisely, they spend a little time showing footage of the war, but they also provide newspaper clippings and news conferences documenting how the FBI was on their trail from the beginning of their plan.

There's not much more I wish to share, for it's better to lay it down there as though you, too, are going into this journey for the first time.  Even the initiated will appreciate some of the intrigue and insights the story and testimony bring to the viewer.  How each participant recalls how they planned the heist and the maneuvering that went on during their famous trial is pretty remarkable.  Plus it's good to hear them share their innermost thoughts on all of the events, including recollecting the riots in Camden that preceded their acts of ""civil disobedience,"" as they call it.

While I may not agree entirely with their methods, the ""Camden 28"" had enough conviction in their beliefs to act out what seem to be ""good intentions"" for ""a worthy cause"".  See 'The Camden 28' and judge for yourself.",1190246400,5,2539,4.824480369515012
2883945,5,B000SAGGM8,"This very even-handed presentation of the case of the Camden 28, a group of anti-war protesters (including Catholic Priests and a Protestant Minister) with plans to raid the Selective Service Office in Camden, NJ in 1971 was informative, entertaining, and moving all at the same time.  The participation of many of the principals from both sides of the story gives the documentary a great deal of authority and gravitas.  Those not familiar with the story will be surprised if not shocked by some revelations, but overall, you are left with a sense that the program could be talking about the United States in 2007, rather than over 35 years ago.",1189814400,4,646,4.863636363636363
