8341259,5,B001TH2G78,"A very interesting compilation of wonderful performances, from several heavy duties of the prog rock scene in the 90s.  The progfest was an amazing opportunity of enjoy our well beloved bands, old and new!  The John Wetton Band is at its best in this concert, and also are specially inspired the intervention of Spock's Beard and Arena.  The Flower Kings is always a great presence, and watching Le Orme after so many years, was a wonderful surprise.

Thanks to the progfest!  To have the video is at least a good consolation for all of us who were not able to be there.  Only problem is that you want to watch more of the performances!!",1286236800,2,637,4.543859649122807
