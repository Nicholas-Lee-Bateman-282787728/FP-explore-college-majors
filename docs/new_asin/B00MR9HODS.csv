8674192,5,B00MR9HODS,"Excellent film.  Uniquely unusual.  Great story line.  Direction and camerawork fantastic.  Actors of a far superior quality...and, of course, why wouldn't they be?  I'm in it.  Doing much better now although sans guts.",1427673600,,219,5.484848484848484
8674193,5,B00MR9HODS,"This is an exquisite film in the vein of Naked Lunch, Franz Kafka, and Cormac McCarthy. It's Cronenberg meets Terrence Malick. It's gritty, surreal, emotional, and dark. The performances are inspired and the direction is genius. One of my favorite films of 2014.",1419552000,3,262,5.116279069767442
8674194,1,B00MR9HODS,"Visually it was too dark to enjoy...I hate films where it's hard to make out what's
happening.",1419465600,,94,4.588235294117647
8674195,5,B00MR9HODS,"I reeallllly enjoyed this film.  Took me by surprise.  I've been a fan of Bill Oberst for awhile now so I remember over a year ago when this movie was announced!  I'm happy it got picked up by a distributor so I can finally see it!  It was worth the wait!  Bill did an amazing job, along with the other actors and actresses.  The music was nuts, totally fit with the disturbing imagery.  It made me think too, which is a rarity for a low budget horror film.  Trevor Juenger has massive potential as a director and I can't wait ti see what he does next.",1419465600,3,552,4.1415094339622645
8674196,4,B00MR9HODS,"This may sound cliche', but Coyote is the type of film that gets under your skin and stays there. Coyote is about a writer named Bill (played to psychotic perfection by Bill Oberst Jr.) who is quickly descending into madness. Writer/director Trevor Juenger uses tension and mood like finely tuned instruments in order to bury into your psyche like a worm. Bizarre camera angles, fish-eye lenses, high contrast shots, deliberate color choices, are all there to build tension. Coupled with Oberst's warts-and-all performance, the film leaves the viewer with the same gripping feeling of horror and paranoia that the film's lead is experiencing.

This is a lower budget film and there are times when this shows through. At times the dialogue can be slightly muddy and some shots can be overly grainy or shaky. That being said, this is a must-see movie for anyone who enjoys seriously tense, bizarre, psychological horror ala David Lynch or disturbing body horror ala David Cronenberg and can get past the few minor technical flaws that come from being a lower budget production. I also recommend checking out the short test film included entitled ""Trash Man.""",1418947200,3,1156,5.052356020942408
8674197,4,B00MR9HODS,"This is probably one of the mosted F'ed up movies I've ever seen.  There's a camera with lady parts as the lens and a knife that comes out of the lead actor's crotch... and all of this seems perfectly normal in the scape of things with Coyote.

It's definitely not appropriate for children.  There is a reason why it's not rated.",1418256000,4,329,4.360655737704918
8674198,5,B00MR9HODS,This movie is destined to become a cult classic. The sound track will blow your mind!,1416441600,6,85,4.375
8674199,5,B00MR9HODS,"If I had two words to describe Coyote it would be ""wickedly brilliant"".

I want you to imagine William S Burroughs and Franz Kafka and David Cronenberg and David Lynch all having an incestuous orgy. And from that incest jewel orgy you birthed Coyote.

This is possibly one of the most interesting and disturbing trips into a whirlpool of pure insanity, laced in an acid trip of a nightmare, that I have ever seen. Screw drugs watch Coyote.

Unless you have seen Coyote it is hard for a person that has seen it to review it in a way that a person who hasn't seen it will get it. To describe how far out, how deep, how interesting, how abnormal this structural movie is, in reality is impossible. Unless you've been raped in the mind by an insane high on crack rock midget, my review won't matter.
