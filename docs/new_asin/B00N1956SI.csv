8675551,3,B00N1956SI,"My first thought when i put this movie on was this was just another bad movie that i wouldn't like. But as it got going it got better and more of a understanding. I never seen the original and the cover to this version striked my interest, not knowing really what this was about other then reading the back. I'd say this is an okay movie nothing to really go out of the way to own.",1477699200,,381,4.026315789473684
8675552,4,B00N1956SI,"Pretty decent little remake. Have never seen the original from the 70's, had no idea what this was exactly about. It was a pretty decent no budget, horror flick. Main reason to purchase this was the presence of Brinke Stevens and thankfully she was in it quite a bit. The supporting cast was very good too. The movie itself was a bit predictable and that's the reason I don't give it a higher rating.",1423872000,,400,4.418918918918919
