6432759,5,B00KIZY2QA,"I don't want to give away the plot.  You'll have to see what director William Castle did.

I Saw What You Did (1965) stars Joan Crawford, Leif Erickson, John Ireland, Joyce Meadows, Andi Garrett, and Sarah Lane.  This is a low budget black-and-white highly suspenseful camp horror classic.  Joan Crawford starred in a string of quality camp horror movies in the 1960s - Whatever Happened To Baby Jane? (1962), Strait-Jacket (1964), I Saw What You Did (1965), and Berserk! (1967).  This movie is right up there with the best of these.  The strengths of this movie are the dark and shadowy black-and-white cinematography, the suspense, and the performance of Joan Crawford and the other adult actors.  The weaknesses are the so-so acting by the two young prank calling girls and the slightly offbeat musical score (though effective in certain scenes) by Van Alexander.  Alexander's musical score for Strait-Jacket is better and fits that movie very well.

I can see how this movie (and perhaps director William Castle) probably influenced directors like John Carpenter.  This movie reminds me of Halloween (1978) in some ways, Psycho (1960) (the Hitchcock movie that influenced John Carpenter's Halloween) in other ways, while at the same time borrows from Psycho.  So, I think of this movie as both a trailblazer and an imitator all rolled into one - it was influenced by and borrows from Psycho, but at the same time influenced Halloween much like Psycho, Black Christmas (1974) and Carnival of Souls (1962) did.

This movie is a prime example of a scary movie that accomplishes its goal of scaring the audience with little or no special effects.  It's the dark atmosphere and the edge-of-your-seat suspense that's so effective.

I highly recommend this movie.  A good Halloween night watch.",1452556800,14,1791,5.04421768707483

John Ireland is in the shower and his wife is seen packing to leave him. The phone rings....a female voice asks for him.... Wife argues through the shower door about the female on the phone.... and John grabs wife into the shower and kills her.  Well done shower scene. Dead wife sails through the broken glass of the shower. The door bell rings...neighbor. Joan Crawford completely decked out with sexy dress and jewelry greets a ""nervous"" John. We find they had an affair and Joan plays the love starved woman to the hilt. John is able to send Joan home. John now IN in a suit and tie.....drags a ""trunk"" to his station wagon....with Joan watching his every move out the window. I laughed out loud at how very stupid this part was..... John is busy ""burying"" his problems when his car is spotted by someone. John returns home and Joan decides to take ""advantage"" of DEAD wife by ""blackmailing"" John into being her new husband. LOL....The female voices on the phone are bored teenage girls playing phone games.

John has to get ""rid"" of the girls and Joan.....and do it FAST~~~~This is a very good movie. The background music is a bizarre choice for a thriller~John Ireland nails it as the psycho husband who 'gets rid"" of his problems by killing them. Joan is excellent as the wealthy nypho nut next door who will get her man by ""blackmail"".....The plot is very good and girls Sarah Lane and Andi Garrett are likeable and cute as the teens who stumble across murder via the phone.

I chuckle toward the beginning when Leif Erickson makes dumb not-even-jokes.  I don't think the daughters even laughed when they were told to - it looks like their giggles were dubbed in later.  And today, being older, I am pretty sure the girl who played ""Kit"" doubled as the woman on the phone as the babysitter who couldn't make it.  Interesting to know that John Ireland REALLY did enjoy love scenes with Crawford.  Some of it is still scary/eerie.

My siblings and I would stay up late at night to watch this show and not be able to go to sleep without having the light on in our bedroom.  After all of these years, parts of the movie are still scary and intense. The theme music of the movie belies the seriousness of the movie.  The teenaged girls in this movie played games on the telephone (didn't we all do similar things as kids in the 60s?). What spoiled, indulged/rich brats!  Such foolishness was halted by caller ID thank goodness.  It is incredible that the glamorous actress Joan Crawford appeared in this campy movie. Sadly, she portrayed a desperate woman. It must have been toward the end of her career.  What is even more incredible is that the girls inappropriate behavior lead to the deaths of 3 people and the girls were allowed to smile, giggle, and walk away from it all without consequence.  The only adults with any amount of responsibility are the mother of the girls and the father of their guest, Kit.

6432775,3,B00KIZY2QA,"One of William Castle's later efforts. ""I Saw What You Did"" was made the year after the terrific ""Strait Jacket"", and also stars Joan Crawford. She must have got on well with Castle as this was a much smaller role, in what it is a less impressive movie all round. The film stars two teenage girls who have been left to babysit the much younger sister of one of them in a remote house. To relieve the boredom, the pair decide to make lots of prank calls, whispering the movie's title down the telephone to lots of random people they pick out of the phone book. Trouble is, one of their victims really DID do something - he just murdered his wife! And once the call has been made, he decides he has to act fast and remove any potential witness.

Now, on paper this all sounds like it has the potential to make a really suspenseful and exciting movie. But for some reason, Castle sabotages the atmosphere by seemingly directing it for an audience about the same age as his two girl stars. Right from the opening credits, swinging beat music blares out over shots of the two friends gossiping over the phone, followed by nearly half an hour of cutesy family orientated comedy-melodrama. It's a problem shared by the original ""13 Ghosts"", in which a similarly spooky setting was spoiled by the irritatingly humourous sparring of the happy family involved. Why does Castle do this, when he's showed he has the know-how for creating real suspense if he wants to? My only guess is that a hard-hitting, adult film about a murderer terrorising two teenagers is not what Castle felt comfortable making here. But if that is the case, why is the film (and Castle's whole career) marketed at ""scaring the pants off America"" (to quote his autobiography)? He managed to make ""Strait Jacket"", ""The Tingler"" and ""Homicidal"" pretty effective, but he really drops the ball here.

Which is a shame, because in places, the film shines. The main murder, which leads to all the trouble, is a knockout. Although it's totally stolen from ""Psycho"" (it takes place in a shower), the roles of killer and victim are cleverly reversed, and it is short, sharp and surprisingly brutal. But once this is over, the plot really creaks as the machinations of the phone call and the murderer's discovery of who made it get awkwardly spun out on the screen. The script makes a real meal of setting up the drama... I'm sure they didn't need to make it quite this complicated, with lots of phoning, scheming and re-phoning going on. As a result, it takes forever for the film to reach it's climax in which the murderer finally starts terrorising the teenagers at their home, but when it does, there's some more real tension as he breaks in and starts his chase. I won't reveal the climax, but after it, as the film comes to a close, it's all ruined with a stupidly jaunty burst of music and some unbelievably inappropriate merriment (along the lines of ""That's the last crank call I'll ever make - ha ha!""), which wipes out the whole dark mood of the preceding 15 minutes. Unforgiveable.

So I was disappointed. Shame really, as the two girls playing the lead roles make good work as the giggly teenagers - not too annoying, and turning realistically scared when things become nasty. Even the little sister isn't bad. Castle must really like working with children, as all his child actors seem pretty relaxed and natural to me. Joan Crawford also makes an impact, in a very small role that she's really acting too well for. It's worth re-watching just the scenes she is again a second time. And there are brief moments of very good suspense. But basically, this could be a film aimed at kids about the perils of making prank calls, in fact if you took out the rather graphic (in this context, anyway) shower murder scene, it would be little more than a piece of Saturday morning matinee fluff.",1415750400,5,3852,4.62043795620438

6432780,3,B00KIZY2QA,"It was an interesting idea.

Alone at home,Two bored teenage girls and a pre-teen little sister decide to play games with the telephone. The little girl pretends she is much younger than she is and has spent her last dime trying to find her mother crying ""Mommy! Mommy!"" thereby upsetting a caring stanger. One teenager calls an unsuspecting woman's husband using a sexy voice and trying to stir up trouble. The couple catches on quickly and the gag falls flat. The girls would never get away with this in 2014 but, remember, this film is set some time in the sixties.

Finally, one girl calls a strange man (John Ireland) and says: ""I saw what you did and I know who you are."" Little does the girl know that the man she is calling has just murdered his wife (Joyce Meadows). Joan Crawford as the man's scheming neighbor shows up to complicate the plot and she does well with what she is given, but Joan's role doesn't merit more than co-star billing. This is kind of a rip-off considering the fact that Joan is far and away the biggest star in this movie.

SPOILER ALERT

The most interesting scene in the movie is a play on the shower scene in PSYCHO. John Ireland is in the shower. His wife, Joyce Meadows, calls him to the phone. When he doesn't respond, Ms. Meadows goes into the bathroom. He breaks the glass shower door, pulls the wife into the shower with him and stabs her to death while he is naked and she, fully clothed (You do not see any actual nudity).

It's not a bad little movie, but, it's not a great one, either. Rent it first. Too bad Joan is not  the murderer.",1408579200,,1582,4.382252559726963

8659452,2,B00KIZY2QA,"This is a fun movie. I own the previous DVD release of this by Anchor Bay which has an odd letterbox effect that reduces the overall size of the picture. I purchased this version from Universal Video hoping the letter boxing would be gone. It was gone, but this budget release has other problems. The print is not well balanced in regard to the black and white contrast, faces often look harshly white and washed out. During credits the reverse titles (white letters against black background) have a halo effect around them. There are also projectionists cue marks in the upper right corner of the picture. So every 20 minutes or so there is a brief black circle that flashes in the pictures corner which were used in movie theaters to tell when to change over to the next reel of film. I haven't seen these in years! The packaging is very minimal and there are no extras on the dvd except subtitles. Play is the only menu feature. The Anchor Bay release, although now of print is by far superior quality and presentation. This is just ok if you like this movie for a cheap price.",1520208000,3,1080,4.4873096446700504
8659453,5,B00KIZY2QA,I have waited so long for a reasonably priced DVD.  Knew it wasn't a great movie but it was great to see Crawford again.  The girls in the movie are terrible.  Crawford's hair & jewelry have to be seen to be believed.,1517702400,,217,4.119047619047619
