8503008,5,B006QEWPKW,"Okay, so first off this DVD is worth 6 stars, not just 5.

Now, we purchased all Shawn's WCS videos and started with the basics working our way up to this one.  I highly recommend you get them all if you are interested in this advanced video because it is truly just that... ADVANCED, in a good way of course as that is what you should expect by the title.  If you know the basics you still should get the moves and patterns dvds because they give you the moves you will need to know before getting into these advanced moves.

The moves Shawn and his partner teach on this DVD are absolutely great.  I have to say that one of the best aspects of all these DVDs and especially the more advanced ones is that each move taught is a 'leadable' move, meaning that is not something where you have to tell your partner what to do next, instead you just lead her into it.  We have tried a few other instructors videos on WCS and found that the advanced moves were more choreographed then anything, which does not make for a smooth dance.

All and all, this was a great DVD and my wife and I highly recommend it.",1398643200,2,1103,4.199052132701421
