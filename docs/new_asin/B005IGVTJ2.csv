8474615,5,B005IGVTJ2,"""Haunted Changi"" was a decent ghost story as well as an interesting glimpse into another culture. I thought it was well-written and well-acted, the characters all being believable. My only beef was with the extras; I find it hard to read the TV screen. Other than that, Singapore's entry into the genre was a good one.",1367193600,,318,4.696428571428571
8474616,4,B005IGVTJ2,"It seems amateur viewing angle starts to be the norm nowadays for horror films -- effective ones.
Paranormal Activity series is great, particularly the first one, which caused me to Google whether it was real. However, its sequels are not as scary, including the one in Japan, probably due to similarity of tricks.
Yes, it's all about the tricks. Haunted Changi is a Singaporean production, meaning it emphasizes on different aspect of supernatural phenomenons for viewers believing in different paranormal activities. For me, as an example, horror films lose credible feel greatly if Satan or Lucifer appears. Thus, Haunted Changi might not satisfy the taste of some Western audience.
Not all tricks Haunted Changi uses is convincing to me, but some of them are greatly effective to scare, especially one that towards the end of the film. Overall, it is a great horror film and definitely could scare the hell out of a timid mind.",1349049600,,931,5.012903225806451
8474617,5,B005IGVTJ2,This story line is not that of a typical horror film. Watching a movie without some one from the group of friends tripping and falling to the predator was a nice change. Recommened for those who enjoy watching a great ghost movie!!,1338163200,2,231,4.523809523809524
8474618,4,B005IGVTJ2,"I disagree with Randall... I thought it was a well made film. He seems to think everyone who disagrees with his negative rants must be involved with the projects, lol (he does this a lot). In fact, I respect reviews that are actually critical and professional, not generalized attacks on people. Anyway, the director set the mood just right- it's appropriately dark, good suspense and a few good jumps. If you love the genre, see it. In an age of Hollywood remakes and diminished tangible media, it's nice to see indie horror is still out there.",1323302400,3,545,4.6875
8474619,5,B005IGVTJ2,"This is a great story using real buildings with real history.  The characters were interesting and the plot was excellent.  even though the hand held camera movies are becoming a bit old at this point I believe this one is definitly worth a watch.  I watched this movie online last year and have been waiting to purchase it ever since.  The only issue I had with this movie is sometimes the characters speak too quietly and its difficult to understand.  A positive note is the movie is in English so you do not have to read subtitles.  For the cost of a movie ticket you will own a piece of entertainment that does not get old, has not been run into the ground by the mass media, and something different to show your friends on movie night.",1322352000,,740,4.364963503649635
8474620,5,B005IGVTJ2,Pacey and scary. Great cast. It was like listening in on a group of friends. Fabulous use  of an iconic abandoned building. Loved the creepy twist at the end. Goosebumps.,1318377600,,170,4.666666666666667
8474621,5,B005IGVTJ2,"An entertaining horror romp well worth the price. It's a fascinating look at the genre through the eyes of Singaporeans, weaving in elements of the country's history with clever storytelling and excellent camera work. Showcasing local talent that are not yet household names, the movie continues on the great work by local film-makers and hopefully will serve as a beacon for more to try their hand and growing the industry here. Kudos and I hope to see their next work soon!",1318291200,,475,4.8765432098765435
8474622,5,B005IGVTJ2,"Haunted Changi has 250,000 Facebook fans. Quarter of a million people can't be wrong! Suspense, atmosphere of an abandoned WWII hospital, a great story - this movie has all the right elements. I loved the way it was shot - the gritty colors, the naturalism and great attention to details. I watched it again and again, and each time, I found new disturbing details. The hand-held cam style didn't make me sick, as some other found footage movies do. Great acting too. I felt like I was right inside there with the crew, shooting the documentary. The unsettling dread, always a feeling of something's around the corner. Wish I could go into the hospital now. But apparently the authorities have sealed it up. Won't give away the ending but I was stunned into silence for a long time. Had me thinking about it for a long long time. Not your average mindless, everything explained for you type of movie. Viewers with the smarts will totally understand and appreciate this perfect little gem.",1318204800,3,988,4.75
8474623,1,B005IGVTJ2,"I bought this movie from a DVD shop in Singapore, mainly because I live 2 minutes walk from the old Changi Hospital where the movie is set. Before I saw this film I thought Tiger's Whip was the worst movie ever made. Now I can see that Tiger's Whip was brilliant when compared with this drivel. I had hoped to learn something of the history of this old hospital, but references to historial facts are scant to say the least.",1315353600,5,424,4.3125
