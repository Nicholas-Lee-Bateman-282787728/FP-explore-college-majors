4400989,3,B004LAIU48,"The price is excellent but one might like to check the complete series which has the remaining 10 or so episodes needed to complete the series.  But for an episode/dollar price this collection is well worth it.  The half hour format works surprisingly well.

I particularly recommend the episode Hot Ice Cream with Yvonne Craig which is in both collections.  It is a fine example of the early acting of Ms. Craig, soon to be an Elvis movie co-star, and best known for her memorable, yet brief, one year role as the future Batgirl in the Batman TV series seven years later.

Mr Bronson is better in this series in my opinion than some of his later work, as he had not hit upon his tough guy persona that became a mainstay of celebrity impersonators like Rich Little.  He seems more accessible and human in this series in my opinion.  The series was probably an influence for later series like Mannix and Rockford Files with their tough but likeable heroes.",1308355200,12,955,4.58235294117647
8434027,3,B004LAIU48,"I enjoy this old T.V. show.  The video quality on these discs is very good, but the audio is somewhat low/uneven.  Unfortunately, increasing the volume seems to cause audio distortion, so it is even less understandable.",1516838400,,219,5.055555555555555

8434031,2,B004LAIU48,"I didn't remember this series very well and was disappointed at the amount of violence it contained. I know Charles Bronson is known for that, but I guess I didn't expect a photographer to have to deal with so much violence outside of war experience. I wasn't able to watch more than a couple of episodes at a time because of the violence, so I alternated it with some comedy and non-violent mystery shows to minimize the affect it was having on my peace of mind. The stories were interesting but they didn't seem to make the series better than ones with much less violence.",1438300800,,574,4.476190476190476

8434034,5,B004LAIU48,"Probably few people remember this show but if you like 50s detective style shows, I recommend it. Charles Bronson is a former boxer/ free lance photographer who helps solve crime. You can purchase this item cheaply. It contains 19 of the 29 episodes or the full 29 at triple the price. I should have gone with the 29. A unique show with Bronson actually showing some acting ability.",1396051200,4,382,4.632352941176471

8434036,5,B004LAIU48,"Frankly, ""The Man with a Camera"" series was much better than I remembered and I realize that I didn't fully appreciate it when I was eleven. I bought this collection to augment our collection of DVDs which we watch on Saturday mornings, and we wound up watching the bulk of the episodes the first day we had the DVD and sampled the first episode on the first DVD; that episode, ""Another Barrier"" involves Mike Kovac shadowing and photographing the pilot of an experimental X plane as the pilot goes about his daily routines, and it encapsules everything good about the movie ""X-15"" without including an of that movie's many bad features, on top of that the true ending of the episode held a complete surprise. I had remembered the series as one in which Bronson ""beat ups the bad guys at the end of the show,"" and I wasn't prepared for a story in which no one throws a punch, no one fires a shot, no crime is committed, but was rich with human drama and showed that Kovac was a sensitive and sensible man.

 There are a few episodes in which Bronson beats up a bad guy or two in the last few minutes, but not because the series had three basic plots which the series recycled with variations each week, and a producer assumed the viewers wanted action for a climax to each story. ""Man with a Camera"" was a thirty-minute program with a single principal and almost no reoccuring characters, as such it was plot driven and there was a nice rich variety of stories. Mike Kovac might not quite be a character who can go anywhere and do anything, but he could go anywhere and take a photograph of about anything and he met some interesting people. ""Man with a Camera"" isn't great television but many of its episodes (i.e. ""Another Barrier"", ""Lady on the Loose"", ""The Man Below"", ""Hot Ice Cream"", ""Kangaroo Court"" and a few others) are very, very good television. I'll undoubtedly be watching all nineteen stories several times in the future.",1372896000,4,1935,4.541547277936963
