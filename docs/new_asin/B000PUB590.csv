8193438,2,B000PUB590,"The first feature on this disk, ""The Day Time Ended"", is a fairly decent little sci-fi film.  It has some provocative ideas, some weird landscapes, and unusual twists.  The f/x are primitive, but serve to get the point across.  Jim Davis carries the film, and he would soon become famous as oil tycoon Jock Ewing on the TV show ""Dallas"".  I have to admit, it was rather surrealistic to see ""Jock Ewing"" pontificating about ""space-time warps""!

The second feature you might as well skip.  A truly boring story and yawn-inducing long speeches by the cast, as they basically just stand around and argue.  The ""Doomsday Machine"" is some device the Red Chinese use to blow-up the world (why they did it isn't explained---apparently they did it just for the heck of it).  A dreadfully slow and boring space voyage follows, in a tacky ship while the crew gets into petty arguments.  Watch for the ""Lay-z-Boy"" recliners that serve double-duty as flight chairs for the crew.  The print of the film is truly bad, with the outside space-walk scenes being little more than mirky at best.  I was surprised to see veteran actor Henry Wilcoxin in a major role.  He played Pharaoh's general in ""The Ten Commandments"", and later was Cecil B. DeMille's associate producer.  You can also spot a very young Mike Farrell in a bit part as a newspaper reporter, years before he became prominent as B.J Hunnicut in the TV series M*A*S*H.",1501891200,,1413,4.741803278688525
8193439,4,B000PUB590,"In this Alpha Video cheapie collection that is capitalizing on the ""grindhouse"" term this particular set is probably the best.  You get two features, neither in particularly good condition or in a clean transfer (but ""The Day Time Ended"" fares better in this respect than ""The Doomsday Machine"" does), and both significantly different than the other.  In ""The Doomsday Machine"", a cautionary Adam & Eve cubed or quadrupled tale in outer space, several astronauts witness the earth explode from their spacecraft due to some nefarious communist Chinese plot.  How the astronauts manage each other and the resulting shock is the movie's main concern and draw, and there's decent drama amidst the stale acting.  Decent enough if you can stand the slow pace and poor transfer.  But ""The Day Time Ended"" is a personal favorite and makes this set worth it.  In short you have three generations of a family gathering at an isolated desert ranch when a time storm repeatedly deposits all sorts of things, alien monsters, helpful sprites, pyramids, and flashing light u.f.o.s to decently unsettling effects.  The acting is good for the most part, and the actors integrate well with the spfx that makes a lot out of a little budget wise.  This is a fun watch and the main reason for the four star review.",1466553600,,1293,4.89908256880734
