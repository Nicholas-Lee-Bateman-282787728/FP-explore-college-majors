5463406,5,B00AOSE1DA,I purchased this dvd for my mom who is a diabetic. She has been using it and really enjoys it. I was shocked when she told me that the stretching segment of the dvd is really helping her keep artritis at bay. Thanks!,1400716800,4,216,4.046511627906977

5463408,5,B00AOSE1DA,I purchased this as a gift for my Mother. She loves the program! It is very good for older/elderly people and people dealing with restrictions. Use it or lose it is truely the case. For people trying to maintain thier health and mobility it is a wonderful program.

5463414,5,B00AOSE1DA,"As I age and fight type 2 diabetes, some days I find myself walking like a weeble wobble toy down my hallway.  I have a balance board, which I've fallen off more times than I care to count, so I wanted an exercise DVD to help build up my legs and improve my balance.  This is it.  Hopefully, in the months to come I won't be knocking the pictures off the wall and will be in better shape overall.",1469232000,15,396,3.9873417721518987
5463415,4,B00AOSE1DA,"I thoroughly enjoyed the easy workouts & since I'm recently disabled I find it really meets my needs. Since the series isn't available on PBS in my area,  I was thrilled to be able to buy it.",1468627200,3,191,4.162162162162162

5463421,2,B00AOSE1DA,No music.  Weird exercises. I don't care for these videos.,1443139200,2,58,4.8
5463422,4,B00AOSE1DA,"The diabetes workout is great, but the other two workouts in this set are to be done standing. That is not very helpful to my purposes as many in my class are not capable of standing.

I usually love the Sit and be fit workouts because all standing exercises are shown modified for sitting as well. This allows all of the members of my class to participate equally.",1434240000,18,365,4.367647058823529

8555486,2,B00AOSE1DA,"The editor should be shot...which unfortunately is all too common with exercise / dance routine videos.  Sometimes the focus was on the standing person as opposed to both the seated AND the standing person doing the workout.  And then sometimes there was a focus only on the upper body when all of the action was happening in the legs.  Even with me coaching my mom, she couldn't follow the routines.

Also, the music kept putting me to sleep.  There are a lot of jazzy, fun tunes that could have been used, but too many soothing sounds were incorporated.",1507420800,4,555,4.622448979591836

8555490,2,B00AOSE1DA,"This instructor is very soft spoken. I didn't care for this tape at all. There was no intro. about the tape, program, she didn't even give her name or any kind of intro. Exercises were OK. That's the joy (NOT!) of DVD's. Can't return them for content.",1493424000,,251,4.361702127659575
8555491,4,B00AOSE1DA,"I was able to do the exercises with out hurting myself. I really enjoyed my self.  my only complaint is that there isn't a specific listing of the things you
are going to need like the little ball.  A ping pong ball just doesn't do it.",1489276800,3,235,4.086956521739131
8555492,5,B00AOSE1DA,"Nice workout for older individuals with Diabetes. There are several versions of exercises that one can choose from. Also, one can do these exercises by sitting in the chair or standing beside one. Both ways are demonstrated in the DVD.",1484352000,7,235,4.9
