7968883,5,B00006HAYY,"I AM A DRUMMER, (YOU PROBABLY GUESSED THAT) BUT IF YOU ARE A MUSICIAN, YOU'D APPRECIATE THIS. PLAY IT AND WATCH FOR YOURSELF, IT'S AWESOME. PETE YORK REALLY PUT THIS VIDEO TOGETHER WELL. I LOVE WATCHING THIS AND SHOWING MY BAND MEMBERS THIS INCREDIBLE VIDEO. FOR YOU DRUMMERS OUT THERE, YOU CAN PICK UP ON A FEW GOOD TIPS TOO.",1358294400,,326,4.45
7968884,2,B00006HAYY,"I have been a drummer for some time, and try to appreciate all forms of music even if I don't prefer the style. This DVD is 100% not my style, but I still cannot get past the cheesiness of the whole thing. This is just a bunch of guys hanging out playing together and having the camera run. This is the kind of stuff that people watch and then sit down at a drum set and start banging away and think they are a drummer. Maybe on a Saturday morning in the late 1980's this would have been a little better, but this DVD does not pass the test of time. There are too many other, much better things out there to watch and get inspired from.",1335744000,2,636,4.015748031496063
7968885,1,B00006HAYY,Wow this is really bad. First they should call it drum set duets because most of the playing is done with two drumsets or drumset + percussion. The music is really canny and would be most suited for kids cartoon show. I am not sure what the producer is trying to do here. I rented this DVD to see the drummers.  All the camera does is wisk at the drummer and then it moves somewhere else.,1289606400,,388,4.105263157894737
7968886,5,B00006HAYY,I bought this solely for Simon Phillip' performance as he is probably one of the greatest drummers on the planet...Video and audio are good. Remember this is from the 80's. I enjoyed it.,1248134400,3,186,4.666666666666667
7968887,5,B00006HAYY,"Great DVD and a must for every drummer. Some of the greatest drummers show there drumming, solo and with each other. Great sound quality and perfect images. I saw the actual TV series back in the 80's and I'm glad that they finaly put in on DVD.",1190592000,3,245,4.23404255319149
7968888,1,B00006HAYY,"First, let me point out that I'm a rock and roll drummer (been playing for over thirty years and work professionally as a drummer) and have little affinity for jazz or jazz fusion- gives me a headache mostly. So, from a decidedly rockist standpoint what you've got here are a few excellent drummers of various stripes playing horribly annoying jazz-rock compostions with super-uncool German jazzbos on very high-production sets.

Sure, you've got Cozy Powell, Cobham and Bruford, Bellson and Phillips (very good duet between these two) but please- Nikko McBrain? Nippy Noya!? Even Ian Paice who I really like is trapped here playing some of the most wack-ass crap you've ever heard. And don't get me started on this Pete York character who ""hosts"" the entire thing. Whatta corndog! My personal theory is that he wrangled this whole deal so he could get some air-time for his own dubious talent. He must have known someone at the TV station.

And despite his name being on the box, as far as I can determine Dave Mattacks does not appear anywhere on this DVD. I think he's hiding in the back somewhere hoping no one sees him.",1111449600,10,1124,4.758974358974359
7968889,5,B00006HAYY,"The first time I have seen Super Drumming was about 15 years ago in Germany. This DVD is a great Reference DVD for any Musician. Pete York did a hell of a job putting this DVD together. The sound is great and so is the picture. Featuring Louie Bellson, Gerry Brown, Bill Bruford, Billy Cobham, Dave Mattacks, Nicko McBrain, Nippy Noya, Ian Paice, Simon Phillips, Cozy Powell, Freddie Santiago, Zak Starkey and Pete York.
I've been playing drums for approx. 17 years and use this DVD to get ""ideas"". ""Louie Bellson, Simon Phillips & Band: Laid Back Heart Attack Tango"" - SUPER!!!. In addition, I also recommend the ""Super Drumming"" CDs!!!
Keep the Groove going ... ;-)",1054166400,12,667,4.7094017094017095
