8256905,5,B001513AGE,"Great video for the young softball player who wants to learn pitching.  Get this one first!  Covers all the basics for beginners.  Her other videos are for older, more advanced girls.",1477612800,,183,4.838709677419355
8256906,5,B001513AGE,"I really liked this Nancy Evans video because it really stresses the importance of pitching mechanics.  The video is very thorough.  The video includes teaching proper windup, troubleshooting control problems and drills to improve performance.  I like the fact she stresses control, rotation and then speed on pitching goals in that order.  Too many coaches are obsessed with speed and forget about proper mechanics, control and rotation. I would highly recommend purchasing the video.",1380499200,,485,5.513513513513513

8256908,5,B001513AGE,Windmill Pitching 101 - by Nancy Evans.  Nancy Evans shows the basic windmill pitching motions and drills in this video.  My 9 yr old daughter decided she wanted to learn to pitch.  This video helped me work with her to develop the basic motions for pitching.  The video is full of excellent drills for the beginner.  I also bought a few more pitching videos - but this one is by far the best one for the basics.,1285372800,4,412,4.298701298701299
8256909,5,B001513AGE,I received the item in about 3 days after purchase and was very satisfied with that. The video is exactly what I wanted and is helping my young pitchers with there mechanics. Nancy's views are alot like mine I believe in good mechanics before moving on. To many coaches can't wait to have a girl pitch full right away when all that does is form bad habits. Once these habits are formed they are very hard to correct. In this video she stresses good mechanics and explains it very well with some good drills to help form these mechanics.,1247702400,5,536,4.424242424242424
