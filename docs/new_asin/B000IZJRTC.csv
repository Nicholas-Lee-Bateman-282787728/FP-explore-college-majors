This is a classic cult, about 20 years old, one of Bobby Deol's best roles to date, memorable music, well acted, well script, excellent direction.",1459123200,,215,4.684210526315789
8283937,1,B000IZJRTC,The only reason why bought soldier is the story its action/thriller film. The action is good lots of fights and foreign scenes as for actors in film they NOT that  good but boby deol does ok in his hateful self image where he is frustrated man.,1421280000,,244,4.304347826086956

8283939,5,B000IZJRTC,"Bobby Deol excells in the action and the romantic comedy scenes. He got some vague expressions at times for sure, especially during the sentimental times. His dialogues have got more and more solid. He was in need of a hit movie and we got one here. He seems to have got more chances as an action hero more than in any other role.

Preity Zinta's first movie as the heroine got herself some good image as the film did click well in the box office as well as the songs too worked well. She looks good at romantic scenes with that cute smile on her face and seems to be suited for comedy in the most appropriate manner. Well, she looked much different from the current Preity, well time has passed too fast, I think.

Dilip Tahil and Suresh Oberoi were good as the dons and Ashish Vidyarthi did his small role really well. Johny Lever did bring the much needed humour into the movie as expected as a person wandering here and there searching for his twin brother who was lost. He comes at all occasions when we are in need of some humour. We do want some humour in thrillers so that we can relieve the high pressure.

but the dvd have some screeched it like  used dvd........",1325635200,,1173,4.318181818181818
8283940,2,B000IZJRTC,"I had this film about ten years ago on VHS and so was excited when i saw it on DVD on Amazon! I bought it but did not have the opportunity to watch it because i travelled. I got back home and wanted to sit back, relax and watch one of my all time favorite Bollywood productions but boy was i shocked! It was not the film per se cos i already know the story but it was the quality of the DVD that i got. I swear the VHS picture quality was sharper! The sound was even worse as the background music was louder than the people's voices and sometimes the voices go off completely. I could not bear it and stopped the DVD about 40 minutes into the film.
I actually bought this because i have fond memories of ""Soldier"" as the film that made me go back to watching hindi films after about a decade of not watching hindi films. The songs too were definitely worth buying as i got the audio CD from India. If one is able to get a good copy of the film, its definitely worth buying and watching the young Preity Zinta and Bobby Deol in a storyline that will leave you both surprised and shocked!
The vendor has really spoilt it for me!!!",1307750400,,1128,4.085585585585585
8283941,4,B000IZJRTC,"This is another one of Abbas-Mustan's big budget action packed suspense thrillers casting Bobby Doel and Prity Zinta. This movie is about a young man on a mission to find his father's killers who have become successful businessmen in Australia. This movie will leave you on the edge of your seat as the story takes new turns as it goes on. Mostly filmed on location in Australia and New Zealand, it is beautifully photographed and shows mind blowing scenery. It's really good entertainment overall and I would recommend it to anyone.",1304467200,,533,4.868131868131868
