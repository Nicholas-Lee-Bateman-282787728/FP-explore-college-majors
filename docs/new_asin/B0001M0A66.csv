8173518,3,B0001M0A66,"Despite the efforts of director Leo McCarey, ""The Milky Way"" (1936) was unable to reverse Harold Lloyd's box-office decline in the sound era. Nevertheless, it's a pleasant comedy with  Harold as a timid milkman turned prizefighter. Adolphe Menjou steals the show as crooked Gabby Sloan.

In his review for ""The Spectator"" magazine, Graham Greene summed up the amiable blandness of Lloyd's talkie persona: ""One is more amazed than ever at the good fortune of this youngish man whose chief talent is not to act at all, to do nothing, to serve as a blank wall for other people to scrawl their ideas on."" Though he gave it his best shot, Lloyd never recaptured the brilliance of his silent classics.",1385769600,,695,4.831932773109243

8173520,2,B0001M0A66,"The Milky Way is a Harold Lloyd 'talkie' (from Paramount). As a milkman, he inadvertently gets into a scrap with a boxer and promoter/manager, one evening, when Burleigh (Harold Lloyd) goes to meet his sister, after she gets off work.

This movie may get a laugh or two from you, if you're an HL fan,

but after that, there's just too much waiting/anticipating for Harold's next scene.

Now, unlike the silent ""The Freshman"", produced eleven years earlier, The Milky Way pales terribly in comparison, in the area of quality 'belly laughs', and also as a 'quantity' movie, having too many scenes without the silent era star. The Milky Way provided me with only a couple, if any laughs. Still, a fun movie to watch with family, but try to go with the older stuff, if you can find it.",1103414400,,781,4.60431654676259
