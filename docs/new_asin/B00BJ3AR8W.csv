5627103,4,B00BJ3AR8W,Very well choreographed compact workout.  Has a nice balance.  Maybe slightly on the weak side for core muscles but there is plenty of roomto alter some of the movements if you have yoga experience. Simple enough for beginners and enough to keep an experienced yogi from being bored. If you have a good library of yoga DVDs it's a good one to add to the mix.,1388448000,2,358,4.409090909090909

5627105,5,B00BJ3AR8W,"Sara Ivanhoe's Taste is the next step in making Yoga accessible to the rigors of modern life, which often times doesn't give us a lot of time to take care of ourselves. Each of the workouts in Sara Ivanhoe's Taste is only a few minutes in length, so it's easy to work Yoga into our busy schedules. At those times when we have more time we can do all of the workouts together to create a beneficial workout.",1375056000,2,406,4.217948717948718

5627107,4,B00BJ3AR8W,"NOTE:  I received a free copy of this DVD to review for the web site Metapsychology Online Review; you can read a more detailed version of my review on that site.

TASTE provides a series of short yoga routines--each about five minutes in length--which can be used as stand-alone practices or combined together for longer yoga sessions.  Ivanhoe practices alone in a small indoor room, and she instructs via voiceover.  Sometimes her mat is set up parallel to the camera, sometimes perpendicular to it.  In addition to a yoga mat, a chair is required for the ""Work"" routine (Ivanhoe uses a stool).  I have described each segment below.

WAKE (5 minutes).  This routine, intended for the a.m., builds from sun breaths and forward bends to half sun salutations, which are then repeated for several minutes.

SHED (5 minutes).  This practice, which has the theme of letting go, starts with some cat/cow stretches then focuses on a series of cleansing breaths, first in low lunge, then in high lunge.

BURN (5 minutes).  This active routine begins with a vinyasa which moves between chair pose and standing forward bend.  This is followed by a vinyasa moving in and out of Warrior 2 pose which includes breath retention holds and is repeated on both sides.

CLEANSE (4.5 minutes).  This is a twist-focused routine which starts with a seated twist, moves into a low lunge twist, and finishes with a squat twist.

FIRM (4 minutes).  This upper-body centered practice consists of plank pose, side plank, forearm plank, and side forearm plank.

CORE (4.5 minutes).  Begins with a vinyasa in and out of boat pose.  Coming to lying on the back, moves into alternating leg drops and then finishes with a criss-cross crunch.

WORK (<4 minutes).  This routine seems designed to stretch the upper body while seated at a desk.  It starts with a stretch overhead, moves into a twist, and finishes with eagle arms.

TAIL (5 minutes).  This practice centers around balancing postures in a kneeling position.  After opening with cat breaths, it includes bird dog, a side version of bird dog, and a kneeling half moon.

CHILL (6 minutes).  This slightly longer routine offers seated breath work, including breath holds.  Coming to lying on the back, there is a Figure 4 stretch and a brief (1.5 minutes) rest in savasana.

SLEEP (6 minutes).  This all-lying session starts with reclined cobbler's pose and then moves into a reclined twist.  It concludes with savasana (2 minutes) using a knee support.

In addition to the short routines, Ivanhoe includes several ""premix"" workouts on this DVD--i.e., longer practices made from a combination of the shorter ones.  These are as follows:

*SLIM (15 minutes)--consists of Wake, Shed, and Burn
*STRENGTH (14 minutes)-- consists of Firm, Burn, and Cleanse
*REST (12 minutes)-- consists of Chill and Sleep

Personally, I felt that these segments were a bit too brief to work very well as independent practices.  Furthermore, the usability of this DVD is limited by the lack of a programming option; I found it disruptive to have to go back to the Main Menu after each sequence when trying to attempt a longer practice.  (Note:  Even the preset routines are still choppy:  in-between segments, the name of each individual sequence appears on screen as well as an additional separator screen stating ""Yoga with Sara Ivanhoe,"" which felt completely unnecessary.)  Still, I expect that fans of Ivanhoe's prior material (e.g.,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Crunch-Candlelight-Yoga/dp/B002UQ05ES/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Crunch: Candlelight Yoga</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Yoga-Body-Makeover-Series/dp/B000Z4KN1W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Yoga Body Makeover Series</a>) will appreciate this new offering.",1373846400,28,3816,5.454700854700855
5627108,5,B00BJ3AR8W,"Sara Ivanhoe is a great yoga instructor.  I have most of her dvds and use them regularly to supplement my home practice between visits to my yoga classes.  Sara is easy to follow, and her dvds are a nice blend of strength, flexibility, and relaxation.",1372896000,5,251,4.555555555555555
5627109,5,B00BJ3AR8W,I love Sarah's approach and clear explanations of each pose.  This DVD is great when you want to focus on a specific area and only have a few minutes.  Wonderful music too!,1372464000,,172,4.34375
5627110,3,B00BJ3AR8W,The tape is kind of boring and the audio quality is not great. I do like the shorter routines on days when I don't have much time.,1370563200,,130,3.8518518518518516

8569283,5,B00BJ3AR8W,"I enjoy most of Ivanhoe's work, but I really love these 10-minute segments. Most are relaxing and still enhance strength and flexibility. The visuals and music are beautiful as well.",1496620800,,182,5.1

8569285,5,B00BJ3AR8W,"Great short little yoga sequences. I am not supper fit, but I found that these routines were within my physical capabilities.

8569286,5,B00BJ3AR8W,Anything by Sara Ivanho is great. Sh encourages and inspires.  A lot of other teachers seem more  interested in just showing off their abilities.,1448150400,,145,5.0

8569290,3,B00BJ3AR8W,"I looked specificallly for a DVD by Sara Ivanhoe because I used to have 'Beginning Yoga for Dummies' and she was wonderful - calm & soothing yet still firm in the importance of her instruction.  Although her demeanor is the same, and I like her just as much, the moves themselves are for someone more advanced than I.  I am still going to use this DVD but only as an alternate to a more fluid basic step yoga DVD I already have.",1398988800,,428,4.2073170731707314
8569291,3,B00BJ3AR8W,The segments are not easily mixed. There should be a yoga matrix to combine sections. Awkward transitions stopping and starting selections.,1395619200,3,139,5.666666666666667
