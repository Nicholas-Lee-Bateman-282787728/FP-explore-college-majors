It is the only college football movie that  shows the true ups and downs of a season. It is also the only one that  shows just what a coach much go through to create a championship team. I  wish I could have seen the road seen though, I was unfortunate enough to  see the movie after that scene was taken out",916099200,2,484,4.063157894736842

529098,4,630299408X,"Today, it's chic and sexy to denounce football as a bad thing. When The Program came out in 1993 and I saw it in the theater, I thought it incisive and hard-hitting and thought-provoking. It explored the dark underbelly of collegiate sports, and what drives the players and coaches all for the sake of athletic glory, and the exterior pressures imposed on the participants and the shady compromises achieved. James Caan is the embattled 12-year-coach of the ESU Timberwolves fighting to validate his job with legislature and alumni alike. Craig Sheffer is the troubled, boozy quarterback what's buckling under heavy expectations and the burden of being a Heissman trophy candidate. Omar Epps is the cocksure frosh trying to impact his team and trying to mack on his posh tutor (Halle Berry). The movie informs us that, for the second year, ESU has failed to qualify for a bowl, and, so, the movie opens with things at ESU in flux. There's recruiting to be done, that eternal search for a gamebreaker. Golden boy Joe Kane (Sheffer) is trying (but failing) to keep it together. Maybe his salvation lies in the shape of a rehabbing tennis player named Camille (Kristy Swanson)? The film knows better than that. The gridiron action comes with force and brutality and with nasty trash talking, all things that get your adrenalin pumpin'. I love the bit about hitting a guy so hard, snot comes out his nose. It's got its share of strained and hokey moments, sure. Most of Joe Kane's arc is of the overwrought persuasion. But there are moments that work, like Darnell's determined pursuit of Autumn, never mind that she's too good for him, and moments that are poignant, like the crestfallen look on James Caan when he realizes that Lattimer had succumbed again to his demons. By the way, Lattimer (played by a hulked-up Andrew Bryniarski) is one of those characters that are really hard to root for. He does some pretty despicable stuff. And while I don't at all sympathize with him and the pressures he caves under, I get what motivates him. So, yeah, The Program is a solid sports drama with fine performances and some cheesy soap opera elements. It's even a good underdog sports story. It's also got two smoking hot babes in Berry and Swanson. I'm not sure which message resonated with me more: dad, love your kids or you know you're a hick if you have a working television sitting on top of a non-working television. The Program is worth your sit-down time. It tries and, at times, succeeds as an uncompromising expos. It's just that Varsity Blues does it better.",1451260800,,2561,4.77027027027027

529198,5,630299408X,"Really like this movie. College football is one of the most exciting sports on the planet! Only the World Cup might top it. I grew up in Texas, so even though soccer or futbol rules the world, football rules the U.S. I also love the NFL, but to me college fb is better. The Program is a good representation of the reality of college sports. From recruiting, to steroids, to improper benefits offered to student athletes, the NCAA, the movie covers a lot of areas.  They use a fictional team to tell the story. The uniforms look almost exactly like Boston College. Maybe some Florida St. in there as well. Although they play real teams like Miss St., Georgia Tech, Michigan, and Iowa.  There is some really good football scenes. The acting was decent but could have been a little better. Hally Berry and Omar Epps were just starting there careers and this movie probably helped in launching their success. Epps just finished Juice with Tupac and Berry was only 2 years removed from Boomerang with Eddie Murphy.  Craig Sheffer plays Joe Kane, an edgy star quarterback and Heisman candidate. And who can forget, the seasoned James Caan? Great actor.  He plays the head coach. There are some other memorable characters like Lattimore(Andrew Bryniarski)  and Mack(Duane Davis). There are the defensive stars on the team.  For many who are fans of the movie, Lattimore and Mack are the most compelling characters. I would have to agree but I also like Epps's and Scheffer's characters. The movie depicts mostly one season of the football team and all the drama that can go into a full year of college football both on and off the field. I would recommend this movie to anyone that likes sports and football fans most definitely. I can't believe this movie is over 20 years old! Seems like just yesterday I was watching the previews during my sophomore year in high school. Haha. I also remember that there was a crucial scene cut out of the movie due to a real life death caused by a person or persons trying to re-enact a crazy stunt.",1425686400,,2029,4.653631284916201

529273,5,630299408X,"One of my most favorite football movies of all time. Why this movie got horrible reviews is beyond me. I wish i could find the uncut version that has the scene where they lay in the middle of the road after the bar scene. Give this movie a try, you won't be dissapointed. Tells alot of the problems that exist with college football and how the coach tries to deal with them. Alot of the way he deals with the programs problems is turning a blind eye as long as his team is winning but eventually he must man up and deal with it. Alcohol issues, steroids, rape, players flunking classes, rivalries between players jockeying for the same position etc. This movie has it all",1412640000,,671,4.376
529274,4,630299408X,"That's the best way to describe 1993's ""The Program"" in as few words as possible. It's a realistic drama/sports film focusing on a handful of players and their stories as individuals and members of the ESU Timberwolves.

I was well into the second half of the film when it dawned on me that I was into the characters' stories and had forgotten I was watching a movie, which is always a good sign. The characters include the quarterback (Craig Sheffer) who has to deal with the incredible pressure of his position and the fact that his Dad's an aloof drunkard who's given up on life; the linebacker who takes steroids to compete and starts to become a rage-oholic; the black dude from the ghetto who memorizes big words to appear smart; and more. For most of them, their lives and futures hinge on the game and so getting seriously injured can wipe out their very reason for existence. James Caan is notable as the coach.

As for women, there's Halle Berry in her prime and Kristy Swanson, but their roles are too limited and there are essentially no other women to be found, except cheerleaders & students in the background.

People who have played university football have pointed out that ""The Program"" is realistic in its depiction. It's a really good sports film for sure, but 1999's ""Varsity Blues,"" which focuses on Texas high school football, edges it out. In fact, ""Varsity Blues"" ranks with my all-time favorite movies; it's got a more compelling story & characters, a funner vibe and better women. But both of them are must-see sports flicks.

The film runs 112 minutes and was shot at Duke University, Durham, North Carolina, and the University of South Carolina, Columbia, SC.

529323,4,630299408X,"If your at all in to sports movies, this one is a must watch.  James Caan plays a football coach for the ESU Timberwolves(or wolves) a potential bowl competing team being quarterbacked by superstar 'Joe Kane' played by Craig Sheffer(somebody who I have never seen in another movie).  The team is not without their troubles as the movie follows several different players and gives us insight into their personal issues while on the team.

The movie starts off with a scene showing us the Timberwolves losing a game that knocks them out of the playoffs for the year.  Determined, coach Winters(Caan) works towards building the team for next year, recruiting players and assessing the best strategy and position for each player.  As training camp begins, the players return and one in particular, Lattimer, appears to have taken steroids in the off season.

There's other scenes in the first part of the movie, including Darnell Jefferson(Omar Epps) and his introduction to the school.  He is the teams savior, only problem is he fumbles and he is behind in his grades.  The quarterback, Joe Kane, who has an alcoholic parent and who himself drinks to ""blow off steam"" after a game.  Then there's Alvin Mack(Duane Davis) a standout defensive lineman who hopes to one day play in the NFL and essentially puts all his hopes into playing career, skipping classes and cutting out the whole 'educational' part to his college experience.

As the movie progresses, these characters and a few others develop over the team's season and we see how their problems are escalated or handled.  At times, there's enough issues in this movie to make you think that there's no dependable character in the movie other than Kristy Swanson's character who plays Joe Kane's caring girlfriend.  Some of the issues seemed liked they're a little glossed over, but the characters are all college kids so as the audience we can understand/relate to the pressures they're going through.

In some ways this movie is similar to Higher Learning(1995), but without the depth or issues of that movie.  Still I enjoyed this movie and even though the ending is more of a typical sports movie I felt I enjoyed the characters and could sympathize with them.",1390262400,,2218,4.911528150134048

529325,5,630299408X,"I love this movie because it not only reveals practices some football teams have used to win games more often than the native ability of its coaches and players might predict; it also reveals how the same teams work hard to fabricate ""squeaky clean"" images in spite of using these practices.

I've been at The University of Colorado, the University of Washington, Stanford University, the University of Montana and San Diego State University and all have had strong football programs. I particularly enjoyed the UC, UW and SDSU programs, especially the Don Coryell days at SDSU. It seems that a football program has always been a part of my life in one way or another, so I picked up ""The Program"" DVD Starring James Caan in an instant after finding it in the five-dollar bin at Wal-Mart.

""The Program"" is an interesting movie and well worth watching. However, the movie is somewhat flawed in several ways and I'd have to say the main fault probably lies with Director Davis Ward. The movie depicts campus life and, specifically that tied in with the football program. My gripe would be that although all of the things depicted go on, and nobody would deny it, the depiction is exaggerated. Everything comes out larger than real life. Trust me on this one. When it comes to campus life, I've been there, done that. The football players come across as ""animals"" rather than some of the fine young men that I've been aware of. The coeds, well, let's just say that every campus has such coeds, but they're not nearly as prominent and abundant as illustrated in the movie. Again, it's a basic truth, but exaggerated. I have nothing against exaggeration when it's used to make a point in a story but this movie has such an across-the-board exaggeration that it actually detracts from the story being told. It's football stuff that you might get from reading newspapers and magazines, not the stuff of real life on an actual campus.

Okay, it's a pretty good movie and the only problem it has is that it's tainted by my 58-year university life. If you haven't been on a campus, or you've been on one without a football program, you probably wouldn't even notice. Go ahead and enjoy the movie. It's well done. I can see it as being worth four stars.

The Program follows players and coaches at a powerhouse football school (a very thinly disguised FSU) through a mediocre season.  There are a lot of vicious hits, some adequate game day drama, plenty of drinking on a school night, and the quarterback beating a college tennis player in racquetball.  Everybody (I mean EVERYBODY) is a stereotype, but they're generally well done.  Unsurprisingly, a young Omar Epps and a young Halle Berry outshine their still largely unknown co-stars.  Surprisingly, James Caan delivers a weak and wooden performance.  To their credit, the producers brought in actors that actually look like football players: Abraham Benrubi is 6'7"", Andrew Bryniarski is 6'6"", and Duane Davis is the son of an NFL Hall of Famer.

Sonny Corleone vacillated between a ginzo accent and a southern accent for parts of the movie. Pretty impressive. Playing for coach Cann was Alvin Mack the stud LB who liked to say crazy crazy to the offense before the snap. Alvin was the heart breaker in this one. He was a sure-fire NFL prospect who talked smack to the wrong Iowa guard and got his leg snapped. On the bright side Cann goes to visit him in the hospital and the two give us a lesson in B emotion. There were a couple other problems like Lattimer the juicehead gorilla DE back when DE were bulkyheaded white guys instead of freaks of nature like Cameron Wake. Yeaaaah buddy! He gave us one of the best scenes though when he finds out he's starting opening day and immediately jeopardized it by head butting 4 car windows. The real star of the show of course was #13 QB Joe Kane the western PA trash with the golden arm a drinking problem and an affinity for cheating death on his hog. He was Dylan McKay as a heisman candidate. If that's not B...

Fantastic movie and due to Cann's mailing in coupled with Omar Epps playing the gangster RB with the heart of gold who is apparently the team's only receiver and Joe Kane's dad this was a superior effort. Joe's dad even said ""Merry f'in Christmas"" to show you he was really guttersnipe tripe. We actually had to take a star away here for the fact that this would have been very disappointing years ago. 27 year old Hallie Berry was in this movie playing J Reed's love interest and they didn't have her in even a bikini once. Shame on you. Other than that though, great 90's B. You could even go as far as to say it's the best B football action since Lockup.",1315267200,,2722,4.928104575163399
529404,4,630299408X,"I can't relate at all to the desire to play football, but can totally relate to The Program.  It's a very accurate portrayal of the process of becoming involved with and caught up in something (any type of institution/activity/team) bigger than yourself.  It explores the effects that can have; both positives and negatives, and yes there are usually a lot of negatives.  How you can't help but be consumed by it to some degree, and how being consumed affects you.  Being a part of something like that has the ability to take over your life, to take away or distort or ruin everything else you've got going for you until you've got nothing left to sacrifice to it.  The powers that be get absolutely everything out of you they can, even if in the process they erode your ability to continue as part of the team.  If and when they break you and you become unusable they do generally throw you away, without acknowledging their contribution to the problem.  Like the steroid user; they plan to replace him and they need to replace him for the next season, because he made himself crazy trying to keep up.  His addiction was never to steroids, it wasn't even to football, it was to being really good at football.

The catch 22 in that situation is that you can't not give it your all, but you have to also come to terms with the fact that your best is never going to be enough.  The trick is not to let your role as part of the team/institution consume you to the point that you lose yourself.  You have to learn to take pride in giving it your all while you're playing while still maintaining an identity separate from your role as part of the team.

The final two scenes aren't necessarily happy endings, they are portraits of two individuals who got involved with something bigger than themselves and experienced the positive side of the situation.  They both learn or are learning to use their participation in the football team to strengthen their personal identities instead of letting it destroy their identity.  The rookie gets serious about his academic goals and challenges the tendency of others to place him in the role of the one dimensional football player.  The guy with the drinking problem comes to terms with his dad's alcoholism while refusing to continue using self destructive methods of `blowing off steam.'",1302393600,,2326,4.65281173594132

There indeed were a wide variety of subplots in this movie but I felt that they generally helped the film to progress. The acting was solid, with great performances from Epps and Caan. The actor who played Alvin, the defensive superstar, ironically got his just desserts. I also think Halle Berry played her role very well, although her character almost made the movie unnecessarily messy. The character of Joe Kane was a bit stereotypical, the brash,young quarterback comes from a drunken and self destructive lineage. His daddy doesn't love him- boo hoo! There have indeed been better football movies in the past ten years; I could easily name a half dozen better films simply because this one seemed to lack an ending. I was a little confused why they did not show the infamous ""bowl game"" after talking about it the whole time. Perhaps the film had run too long.

And James Caan has had better performances, for example, ""Brian's Song"". As for Craig Sheffer, this isn't his best either. You could probably give the hot spot to Omar Epps just for his hard work to try to make mediocrity into something worth watching.

We have football movies with better quality than this. While I can watch this a few times, and laugh at some of the dumb humor, it just doesn't stand up. ""The Program"" has been since buried by good stuff, such as ""Remember The Titans"" and most recently ""Friday Night Lights"". It tried to match the standard of classics like ""Brian's Song"" and ""Rudy"". Most of the humor stacks up there with the likes of ""Little Giants"".

I think this also finds itself looking for originality. This stumbles under pressure, and tries way, way too hard!

529477,3,630299408X,"If you're looking for a movie that will give you an overall feel on what behind the curtain NCAA college football is all about, this ain't the one. Unfortunately, there aren't too many out there. While I did find The Program somewhat entertaining, I thought that it tried to appeal to way too many *types* of viewers by convoluting any one clear and relevant plotline with a host of subplots.

 At the beginning of this movie, you may be led to believe that the movie is going to be a sort of expose on the business that college athletics has become. We start out by seeing the college's well-planned attempt at trying to recruit a blue chip running-back (Omar Epps). James Cann is great as the 3-dimensional cool-headed coach, who understands that college football is big money (I like contrasting this to the mean sum'va'bitch coach that Jon Voight plays in Varsity Blues). This underscores the idea that education is a secondary concern to many university officials.

 There are some great moments in the movie about NCAA corruption. Star linebackers take alumni bribes in the movie. Issues of steroid addiction and grade fixing are touched upon, but never examined to full capacity. Don't get me wrong, normally, I like my sports movies with plenty of sports, but I don't think that the proper set up was there for this to be called a solid 100% sports flick.

 While the movie toys with the idea of being a sort of expose, it never quite gets off the ground. I think this is largely due to the fact that the makers of the film tried to rig it to appeal to too many different audiences.

 For example, for the non-sports fans, there are 2 romantic subplots. One involving the moping pariah star QB, Joe Cain, and his passion for the girl who doesn't date jocks (touching...yawn). And yet, another involving Epp's and Halle's characters. For the sports diehards, there is the oh so very cliche big game with the classic slow motion play that always works. For the sentimental crowd there is another subplot involving Joe Kain's tobacco-roadish alcoholic father who never goes to see him play. There is, yet another subplot about Kain's rehab from eposodic alcoholism.

 Like I said, normally I like my sports movies with plenty sports, but this movie frames itself up to deal with the ""behind the scenes"" issues and just doesn't come through. Yes, NCAA football is a dirty business. Shoot to kill! Who gives a damn whether Omar Epps and Joe Kane find true romance?

The movie takes us through one season of college football at a fictional school called ""Eastern State University"".  But unlike most directional schools, this one seems to be some kinda good at football.
Mostly, the action centers around the lives of the star quarterback, a Heisman candidate, and the highly recruited true freshman tailback.
To be perfectly honest, I wasn't expecting much. ... I thought it might be something neat to watch.  I was very surprised that it turned out to be good.
Here's a few thoughts:
* The movie is rated R, but it could easily have been PG or even G if not for the gratuitous use of profanity.
* I kinda wondered if this is supposed to be the University of Georgia.  They finish their season with Georgia Tech and there is a banner that says ""SEC"" hanging in some shots.  Although the banner could be there just because nobody bothered to take it down - when they show a wide shot of the stadium, it looks like South Carolina's stadium.
* The logic doesn't quite work out with what they needed to do for a bowl game.  By 1993, the bowl alliance system had started and by winning their conference, they were already assured of going to an alliance bowl regardless of what happened with GT.
* There is one play where a defensive player sacks the QB to end the game.  But he does so by ripping off the poor guy's helmet.  Rules have changed a little in the last ten years, but I'm pretty sure that was still illegal then.
Overall, it's a good movie for a college football fan.  The plot is a bit cheesy, but a college football fan can enjoy it anyway.",1057276800,,1798,4.40785498489426

The acting is  unforgettable.",944265600,2,312,4.456140350877193
529613,4,630299408X,"It was great to see James Caan back in action after an extended hiatus.  This is a thouroughly enjoyable movie.  The Plotlines tend to be a bit cliche, but anyone who has ever played football, or been a fan will forget  that once they see the practice sequences, as well as some of the game  footage.  If you are a football freak, you need this movie in your  collection.",943833600,,371,4.304347826086956

7833190,3,630299408X,"This movie seems pretty realistic to me.  It shows how far College Coaches and and administration will go and look the other way when their star football players get into trouble.  James Caan is excellent as the the head coach who buts heads with administration and has a classic line defending one of his players when on of the administration points out that the college is an institute for higher learning.  When he comes back with the line when was the last time 80,000 people watched a chemistry exam.  And Kristy Swanson is good also as a tennis player who cant help but notice how the football players are treated different.  And Halle  Berry has a good early role.  This is a good sports movie.",1514419200,,701,4.56
