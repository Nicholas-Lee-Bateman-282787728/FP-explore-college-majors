8454285,4,B0052SO0VA,"When Columbia Pictures released Slightly French in 1949, Dorothy Lamour was 34 years old and her film career on the ebb, never mind that she still had plenty to offer, talent-wise. Slightly French is a fun remake of the Ann Sothern starrer, Let's Fall in Love (1933). But, really, both films are essentially a riff on George Bernard Shaw's classic play, Pygmalion. In Slightly French, draconian motion picture director John Gayle (Don Ameche) browbeats her French leading lady (Adele Jergens) so exceedingly that she collapses in a heap. The promptly fired director tries to worm back into the film studio's good graces by passing off versatile but tough talking carnival performer, Mary O'Leary (Dorothy Lamour), as his latest discovery, the French ingnue Rochelle Olivia. Ameche is imperious and temperamental and calculated. Lamour is glamorous as the fake mademoiselle and spirited as the more down-to-earth, take-no-guff Mary O'Leary. She gets to sing four songs, and probably my favorite is her French-accented rendition of ""Let's Fall in Love."" The plot won't bowl you over with its originality. We get the usual scenes of the unsophisticated girl being groomed to ladylike ways, and it's probably inevitable that she ends up falling for her ""Professor Higgins."" Honestly, what piqued my interest are those early moments when Ameche first notices Lamour at the carnival as she shows off her knack for mimicry as, in quick succession, she plays a sultry Brazilian showgirl, then a dame of Chinatown, and, finally the Parisienne can-can girl, Fifi. Lamour may not have had opportunity to throw on a sarong, but she does get to wear a diverse catalogue of exotic get-ups. Slightly French runs at 81 minutes only, so it doesn't wear out its welcome. Highlights are whenever Ameche and Lamour get to arguing. Lamour is tremendous with her double act. Janis Carter and Willard Parker lend good support as, respectively, Ameche's cynical sister (but, really, poor child's just looking for love) and Ameche's producer and best friend whose keen interest in Lamour extends beyond a businesslike nose for talent. Actually, Janis Carter comes off as so engaging and wistful a figure that I pined for more scenes with her.",1436918400,,2217,5.14404432132964
8454286,5,B0052SO0VA,"Dorothy Lamour gets to showcase all her talents in this one, singing, dancing, comedy, drama and several different character dialect's. Lamour and Ameche are both great in this and keep the movie rolling along. Beautiful musical numbers performed by Dottie arranged and accompanied by the great Henry Russell orchestra. Very good movie transfer.",1424390400,2,345,5.528301886792453
8454287,3,B0052SO0VA,Very well made by Douglas Sirk. Not as good as his other movies. It is a movie that one watches once and soon forgets. I have forgotten the plot.,1369180800,,145,4.0344827586206895
8454288,5,B0052SO0VA,"Dorothy Lamour, one of Hollywood's most remembered stars, has been very poorly served by DVD. Apart from the ""Road"" movies, and the ubiquitous ""My Favorite Brunette"" (a movie in public domain) very little of her work is available. What we really need is a nice box set of her jungle, sarong clad adventures, and some of her 30's/40s musicals like St. Louis Blues and The Fleet's In, would be nice.

So, in the meantime, it is very good to have Slightly French on release. It's one of Dottie's later films but she still has alot of verve and glamour. It's a light comedy with a Hollywood theme, here superbly presented in the crispest, sharpest black and white print imaginable.

It certainly merits a view and until we have that elusive box set is nice to be going on with in the meantime.",1309132800,16,789,4.549295774647887
