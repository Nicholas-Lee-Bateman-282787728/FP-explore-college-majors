4980484,3,B0069HECQG,Both of my babies 2 years and 1 month are entertained and soothed by the music and colors. My only complaint is you must stay awake and turn it off at the end because after the show there is a loud up beat ad with bright colors that automatically comes on and can awaken them from a light sleep.,1373068800,9,295,4.016949152542373
4980485,4,B0069HECQG,Good video with great music and colors for my baby. I would recommend to others. I love this whole collection.,1368748800,2,110,4.55
4980486,5,B0069HECQG,"My son loves all the Baby Einstein videos.  This one is very peaceful with soft music and images.  It still has the puppet shows, but they are toned down and I think it's pretty much this sleepy lamb.  It made me tired watching it!  Good for winding down or relaxing with baby.",1356652800,,277,4.269230769230769
4980487,1,B0069HECQG,"My daughter really enjoyed this DVD. It was a really nice ""settling down"" video. Then, to my shock (though, if I had read reviews here--I wouldn't have been so surprised) the show ended and a blaringly loud ad came on. What a ridiculous decision to have made by the marketing folks at Baby Einstein. Any relaxation achieved for your child will be quickly undone at the end of the show.",1333497600,17,385,4.514285714285714

4980490,5,B0069HECQG,"My daughter loves this! It is very calming and doesn't have as many creepy annoying scenes as a lot of baby videos do, We watch this when she is having a rough day, teething, etc. and can't sleep.",1417478400,,196,4.184210526315789

4980493,4,B0069HECQG,"We got Baby Mozart by Baby Einstein off our registry and loved it. We would often use it to settle baby before naps, or when we wanted to occupy baby a short time while doing housework. I had to really remind myself not to use the dvd so often because my baby loved it. Wanting to give her some variety, I purchased this as well.

Unfortunately, this one is not as engaging as Baby Mozart. There's not as much movement, the scenes take longer to change, and the music is much softer. I know, I know- it's a lullaby DVD. It makes sense that it would be slower, softer, and gentler. I getcha. But it doesn't work if it doesn't keep baby's attention.

That being said, after some weeks of viewing this rarely, my baby has come around. She is in fact more interested in this and will watch it with almost no distraction. I don't know if it's because she's a little older and more developed or if it just took some trying to get her intrigued.

 I can particularly reccomend this if your child especially likes watching other babies yawn and sleep, as there's a good long segment of that. There are also segments dedicated to dogs, cats, and nature, seperately. The nature bit is my favorite, and my daughter seems to enjoy it as well. There's also a sleepy little lamb puppet that appears now and then. My daughter has strted smiling when the lamb shows up, which I love!

So, at first I would have rated 3 stars, but it grew on us, so I will give it a solid 4.",1400630400,3,1457,4.283636363636363
4980494,3,B0069HECQG,Typically great Baby Einsten product with one flaw...the entire video is nice and soothing but beware the ad that comes on shortly after it ends as it is MUCH louder and throws the whole lullaby part down the tubes!,1390176000,8,215,4.538461538461538
4980495,5,B0069HECQG,I love these movies. They do a really good job of keeping my baby's attention. These movies have become part of our daily routine.,1389139200,,130,4.458333333333333
