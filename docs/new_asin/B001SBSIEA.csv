8339641,3,B001SBSIEA,Bought this for my husband for Christmas. He liked it but it wasn't a WOW for him. He wanted to see more of the gadetry and have less movie history.

8339645,3,B001SBSIEA,"When you think of Bond, you think of classy.  The DVD was just ""ok"".  I think the worst part was the music.  Sort of sounds like music from a porno movie.  Not quality, but then again, it was inexpensive.  Just not what I thought.  OK for a stocking stuffer.",1360195200,3,258,4.163265306122449
