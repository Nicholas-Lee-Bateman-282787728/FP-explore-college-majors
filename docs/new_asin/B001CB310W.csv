3506982,5,B001CB310W,I purchased all 5 DVDs in a set and was pleasently surprised when they came to my home less than one week later. The DVDs were exactly as promised and were packaged with care (and a little goodie for me!) Thank you so much - will buy from seller again!!,1283904000,4,253,4.08
3506983,2,B001CB310W,It is VERY hard to follow. They do not speak at all and jumble sentences together without telling you what word you are working on or looking for. I know over 1000 words in sign language and this was hard for me. I can't imagine someone sitting down with this who didn't know any signs. They should be telling you what they are signing while they sign it. Not very impressed with this series.,1382313600,2,392,4.3108108108108105
3506984,5,B001CB310W,"If you are taking ASL 1 and ASL 2, you should but this!!!! All 5 Idioms in 1 DVD! GREAT BUY!",1374364800,,92,3.4285714285714284
3506985,3,B001CB310W,Not all of these idioms are accurate or used anymore. When I used half of these signs the deaf community had not a clue as to what they meant. All of my Deaf professors say to be careful with this series. It is good if you have a professor or a Deaf friend with you to show you which ones are not accurate.,1359936000,8,306,3.873015873015873
3506986,3,B001CB310W,THere is only 1 DVD. WHile the one dvd is good don't pay this price. YOu will not get your moneys worth!,1355184000,2,104,3.772727272727273
3506987,4,B001CB310W,"This deaf couple are funny and educational at the same time. I have been signing for 25 years and know that idioms
can only be learned by ""hanging out with deaf people"", which makes it difficult if you do not have deaf family.
I would recommend this video to the intermediate or advanced sign student to help complete their skills.
Interpreter programs benefit from this video as well.
WE LOVE this couple ;-) ;-)",1332633600,12,413,4.594594594594595
3506988,5,B001CB310W,"I recently purchased the ""Idioms & Phrases in American Sign Language"" 5-Volume set of dvds by EverydayASL Productions, Ltd. These dvds are a must have for anyone learning ASL or brushing up on their skills. We are using them in an ASL Idiom course I am taking in my Interpreter Training Program. I have a Bachelor's of Science in Deaf Ministry and am almost finished with an Associate of Applied Science in Interpreting for the Deaf. I have learned so much from these dvds that I never learned from ASL books and college classes.  The idiom, (in English words), is shown on the screen. Then, Gilda or Avery will show how to sign the idiom three times slowly, with all of the non-manual signals. After that an English sentence is shown as an example of how that idiom could be used. Finally, they sign the sentence with the idiom. So, you see how the idiom is used, but you also are learning many other signs too. The videos are professionally made and will make you laugh. The Deaf actors should be on tv! They are so good!! I will be purchasing more materials from Everyday ASL Productions. By request, they arrived quickly so that I could use them to study for my test!! Thank you!",1330819200,12,1183,4.502325581395349
3506989,2,B001CB310W,"I have watched all these DVDs and they should incorporate subtitle with their sign language and speak slower.  It goes over what will be signed on one screen and then a person get lost on the next screen when they are signing.

So, I did not think was effective learning.",1296172800,7,271,4.4
3506990,2,B001CB310W,"When I recieved this item, I was excited to watch it. I am an intereting major and have taken many ASL classes. I also socialize with Deaf friends, so I understand and use ASL often. these DVDs advertise subtitles and so forth that did not work on the first DVD of the set. The first 10 minutes were not captioned and when the subtitles finally appeared, they only showed the first line of the sentance. The DVD keeo pausing and skipping. I returned my DVDs because I beleived them to be defective.",1294099200,9,498,4.423913043478261
3506991,5,B001CB310W,"I am a beginning ASL student, have limited access to the deaf culture, and want even more than what is available at the local Vo-Tech.  (There are no classes at the local university.)  I bought the 5-DVD set, and am very impressed with the phrasing, expressions, and the interpreters' presentation of the material.  The humor that is added on occasion makes it even more fun (some of the bloopers are ""a riot"").  I am still building my signing vocabulary, so the amount I am learning is actually beyond just the phrases they they teach.

Before purchasing, I'd asked my ASL instructor to look at the description of this set and several books I could order.  She said having the idioms would probably go a long way in helping me in the deaf culture.  When the set arrived I asked her to look at the first DVD to let me know what she thought.  She was so impressed that she is getting her own set to help future students.

The format is very easy to follow, but I would suggest having a little background in signing, otherwise the amount of information presented may be a little intimidating.  Remember: I am a BEGINNING student, so you don't need much of a background for this set to really help you progress in your ASL proficiency.

Several phrases seem to have an Exact English phrasing.  I will ask my instructor whether these phrases are ASL or SEE.  Either way, it makes for easy learning on multiple levels.

I got the DVDs SCREAMINGLY fast: they arrived 3 weeks earlier than promised.  Even though I only paid for routine delivery (4 weeks), my package was waiting for me in 3 business days (I ordered it late Thursday night, and it was here Monday morning).  Everyday ASL Productions did a great job!

Incidentally, the only glitch, and it is VERY minor, is the lighting washes out the interpreters' faces a little (emphasis on little).  Even given that, because of the great learning I am getting, I'm giving this the highest rating possible.",1288396800,19,1951,4.605797101449276
3506992,5,B001CB310W,"I love these DVDs.  I am new to sign language.  My niece is deaf and I'm trying to self teach our family how to sign.  These DVDs have been very helpful, but they are not for the beginner.  I still have a hard time following along because I am so new, but I know I''ll catch on soon. Great for intermediate to advanced levels.  It's good to watch them sign and how important facial expression is to signing.  Great set!  I love that my hearing children want to know why there is no sound on the DVDs!  It's truly learning from the deaf and I love it!  Thank you.",1286928000,6,562,4.08256880733945

8286458,1,B001CB310W,"A great concept but the quality is terrible.  The examples are not quite accurate-- once you try to translate from one language to another, the message gets lost.  It is best to explain the meaning behind ASL and provide elaborate examples of how to use the phrases rather to try and translate.  Higher quality of videos are needed, the make up was terrible and the features need updates.",1401235200,,388,4.676470588235294
8286459,5,B001CB310W,"Came across this series in a sign language class I went to at church. My daughter has unilateral deafness, and while she can hear and speak, she has always been interested in deaf culture. She was not taught sign as a young child because they wanted her to use her hearing and focus on being a hearing child. Now as a teenager she is choosing to learn more about deaf culture and is very interested in learning to sign fluently. I bought her this DVD and several others in the series, so that we can all learn together at home.",1392854400,,527,4.28
8286460,5,B001CB310W,This is a wonderful way to improve your sign skills.  Idioms in english are very hard to translate to a person that use sign language because a lot of the meaning is lost.  Learning these idioms helps to broaden your understanding of the grammar structure of ASL and be more at ease when having a conversation in sign.,1384473600,4,318,4.4655172413793105
