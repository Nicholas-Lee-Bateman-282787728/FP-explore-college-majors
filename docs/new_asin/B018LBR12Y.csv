7553638,5,B018LBR12Y,"I was ready for another cliche overacted romantic storyline but this w/ a lovely surprise. Everything was shot in Bucharest, so nice twist using locals and the city. There is a making of video online - good to watch. Pleasantly surprised by lead actress Giulia Nahmany (her company produced this based on her story and this was her first film role!). Beautifully shot and acted. I wondered if that Fashion Week rep was Michael Damian...lol. He has directed and produced heartwarming, well written films for many years. Thank you for not over-producing Music track to force the feeling in scenes. Hallmark has gone too far w/that making films unwatchable online. Nice to see an actual Production take place in Romania, highlighting the language and culture. Keep it up!!",1470787200,13,769,5.015625
7553639,3,B018LBR12Y,"...but it's a story that's been told before ...""girl"" losses job, goes home, meets "" boy"" and everything works out even better than before. A nice movie but I thought the acting was overly done at times. The main character, a lesser know actor, was nicely cast. Lovely scenery, nice looking actors. I'd say this movie could be between an ""it's okay"" and ""I liked it"".",1470787200,,367,4.575757575757576

7553647,5,B018LBR12Y,"So genuinely real & refreshing to watch.  Have enjoyed viewing many times.  Beautiful love story and the surprising way this couple met.  Sweet romance.  Inspiring to anyone who aspires to designing clothing.  Have purchased this movie as I don't want to lose track of it.  One note on the family.  The love shown and caring for each other, was good to see.  Wish a SEQUEL would be made to continue this sweet love story between Danielle and Adrian as well as the success in their new adventure at the designer factory.",1533772800,,519,4.626373626373627

7553658,3,B018LBR12Y,"I liked the story line, just not all that big on how it was told. There was a few times in the movie I asked why or what does that have to do with the story. That's why I dropped it down to three stars. If I didn't have the why and what moments I would have rated the movie with four, possibly five stars. I do like the grandparents and the house. I loved the house.",1525996800,,366,3.7662337662337664

7553660,2,B018LBR12Y,The acting is really bad. I'm surprised Jane Seymour would appear in a movie with such sub-par actors. I couldn't even make it halfway through the movie thanks to the acting and boring plot. I have watched many movies with inexperienced actors if it had a good storyline. Unfortunately this is not the case for this movie. It's not worth the time.,1525392000,,347,4.612903225806452
7553661,5,B018LBR12Y,"...I wouldn't have known about this movie if it wasn't in Prime. This was a really good movie. The actors & actresses played their part quite well. Wonderful, loving support from family and new friends. I enjoyed watching it.",1525305600,,225,4.794871794871795

7553665,5,B018LBR12Y,"I was charmed . I had met a number of Romanian people who arrived as refugees from the communist regime and thought the simplicity of a small town would be enjoyable to see.
I reckon the film fits into the genre of chick flick as well as that of the underdog conquering great odds However, I think it also puts a spotlight on the savage capitalism of the Western world, and the fashion industry in particular. I believe that it gives and accurate view of the importance of businesses that support communities and the business decisions that can destroy them. The adventure of Danielle's unexpected adventure back in her Homeland shows the riches that we all too often turn our backs on. That said, I admit that this was a cute romance.",1523664000,,735,4.575757575757576

7553668,5,B018LBR12Y,A feel good movie with an endearing female heroin who overcomes and rises above adversity by remaining true to herself and what she loves.  Very refreshing and up lifting.,1521849600,,171,4.896551724137931
7553669,4,B018LBR12Y,cute but kind of cheesy,1520640000,,23,3.8
7553670,4,B018LBR12Y,"I loved this romantic comedy! It delivers all the satisfaction of the genre without being your typical rom com. The heroine is not the typical size 2 ingenue but very pretty with her own flair - I liked her a lot. And the hometown she goes back to after losing her big time New York fashion job is in Romania, which offers a fun contrast. The supporting characters - her family and friends in her hometown - are really sweet, and characters in their own right. There's a nice realism blended in with the romance and glamour. I didn't give it 5 stars as a film because my bar is high for that - the acting was not award-winning, the directing/editing a little stiff, but overall very enjoyable even if you aren't necessarily a fan of romantic comedies with happy endings.",1518307200,,770,4.468085106382978

7553674,5,B018LBR12Y,"The main character is really fun, really pretty and NOT FAT! She is so pretty and I hate that she and others keep calling her fat. Ugg.
She looks great. I love the sewing and love to watch movies with sewing. Maybe some of the actors aren't as strong, but not horrible
so far. I recognize her red head coworker in NYC as the young woman to the main character who was in Lark Rise to Candleford-or it looks like her.",1517961600,,415,4.135802469135802

7553677,3,B018LBR12Y,"I actually enjoyed this film.  It was interesting. Took a different twist from what I was expecting. It was exciting and fun to see danielle realize her dreams. No foul language, which was a relief.  I didn't care for the kissing, or the drinking in one scene.  I recommend you don't let kids watch it, I had to fast forward that stuff, can't stomach it. It is not a Christian film, apparently. However, it was a nice overall storyline.  Would've been perfectly clean if it didn't have any drinking or kissing.",1517529600,,510,4.571428571428571
7553678,3,B018LBR12Y,"Fabulous idea about love, fashion, and friendships. Very cute movie that almost sounds like dialogue (as opposed to words from a memorized script). Enjoyable.",1517529600,,158,5.625
7553679,5,B018LBR12Y,"I watch lots of these Chick-Flicks. Mostly I just watch them to pass the time away. However, this one resonated with me.. I guess because I enjoy sewing & designing clothing. It started okay, but once she moves home, it really picks up! I loved all of the scenery Romania.",1517097600,2,272,4.46
7553680,4,B018LBR12Y,"Cute plot. Acting or directing sometimes a little off, but the feel-good characters and scenery made up for it. Not my normal kind of movie, but nice if you want something light. Happy ending.",1516924800,,192,4.676470588235294
7553681,4,B018LBR12Y,"Ok- this is a 'guilty pleasure' rom/chick flick. It's not breaking new cinema ground, and I didn't expect it to. Wanted something to casually watch that was entertaining and didn't require my thought or lots of attention as it was 'background' while working on a project. It's actually quite charming, and what made me want to write a review was the fact that the LEAD is a 'real size' woman (albeit she is very beautiful, of course), and non-American actress. I found her refreshing, as was her supporting cast in the Romanian portion of the film. Hey, it's not going to win any Oscars, but not every film needs to  it's fun.",1516147200,,626,4.589285714285714
7553682,5,B018LBR12Y,"The subject of the fashion world interested me.  This is a romantic comedy with an underline plot about the business world. The acting was very good even those who didn't speak English well.  Of course, Jane Seymour did a great part too. The Romanian countryside was beautiful as well as the opening scene with the skyline of NYC...great filmography.  The music was upbeat and I enjoyed it.  Glad I watched it.",1515974400,,410,4.732394366197183

7553687,2,B018LBR12Y,I personally did not like the acting in this movie. Main character annoyed me entirely. Could not even finish movie.,1515369600,,116,4.85

7553689,2,B018LBR12Y,"This would be a 5 star if you enjoy the unique script of :  Top of world to fired and down on luck.  Move to countryside, fall in love as reinvent yourself, have a misunderstanding with new love, then rise back to top as misunderstanding is resolved.

This is a 4 star if you enjoy Poor character development, with great leaps in assumptions to move the plot along

This is a 3 star if you enjoy simple pleasure of watching someone go from top to bottom to top of the world without giving to much thought to intellect

But this is 2 star.  Not drivel - as it does entertain, but for someone who does not enjoy all those things mentioned in 5 star.",1515283200,,647,4.17741935483871
7553690,5,B018LBR12Y,I loved that this movie was set both here and in Romania....it held my attention and made me smile. Perfect choice for actors and actresses and the director is fantastic.,1515283200,2,170,4.7

7553692,5,B018LBR12Y,"Kinda like a made-for-tv movie done right!  The characters were loveable and the NY to Romania connection was odd but fun.  This is the kind of movie you watch with your mom, or your pets, or by yourself when you need to be reminded that the world is not all bad. :)",1515196800,2,266,4.096153846153846
7553693,5,B018LBR12Y,SERIOUSLY CUTE ROMCOM!!! I loved the variety of characters from NY to Romania and how the sweet star dealt so graciously to those around her. She didn't get revenge but she did prove herself and it was such a fun twist and not typical romantic story. I LOVED IT!,1515110400,3,262,4.36734693877551

7553699,4,B018LBR12Y,"Enjoyable film in  a great setting. It is a great idea to film mostly in Romania in a different culture, and show that yes, things can definitely come out of different countries, even romances. I love the actress in it as well.",1513123200,2,227,4.404761904761905
7553700,4,B018LBR12Y,"A friendly little movie with a plot that didn't require too much suspension of disbelief. I typically don't care for the ""lost my job"" and ""made a big comeback"" type of flicks, but this one kept a fair balance. The sudden reversal is present, as usual, but not overdone. It did make me want to visit a small town, so there is that. Give it a little time at the beginning and I think that you will be pleasantly surprised.",1513123200,4,421,4.275
7553701,5,B018LBR12Y,"To be honest, I didn't really think I'd like it as much as I do now. I always check the trailer to see whether I'd feel the script, actors and the flow of the movie. I did. Like other reviews, the pace is quite slow. Acting is only okay. Hence, I assume it isn't high budget kinda movie so everything looks quite not as high standard but manageable. I am quite impressed learning that the actress is also writing the script and co-produce this production. Kudo to you.
I normally don't get attracted to British accent like my sisters...though I must say this, David Oaks is perfect in this as a rich, humble British CEO Adrian...delicious!",1512432000,2,639,4.517241379310345

There are no big character layers but actually a lot of people are like her...just basically descent and polite people.  The dialog is not clever or smart.  You don't get any chuckles.  But it is very real life in that respect. But honestly, the whole story was a bit predictable, still, everybody loves a happy ending.  Reminds me of a made for TV movie.  Good for watching while washing dishes or on a lazy Sunday afternoon, but that's about it.  Not movie theater quality.",1505952000,,619,4.464285714285714

7553729,5,B018LBR12Y,"A classic! This well paced, beautifully acted movie brings true emotions and sensibility to the screen. Its action is build around honesty and sensitivity. At every the stereotypes of its characters are challenged by the sensibility of their inner core, not only their sympathy but their support and enlightenment. This movie works on every level. The actors are well costed, and use a wide, understated dramatic range with touches of comedy and joyful inspiration with solid self confidence. More than other movies, it breaks down class barriers to create a common community that lives in its love and appreciation for each other--the movie's wider story.

The movie's prince finally joins that community of love by embracing--and kissing the princess--a real girl anchored in her work and her acceptance of fate which she ably transforms. American movies are often over the top. This movie is a work of relief, an understated gem. Beautifully done. Worth watching! Like the fashion we all wear, it is familiar, well known, but fresh and exciting.",1504828800,2,1048,5.1647058823529415

Usually in theses movies when the child goes back home her attitude stinks. She is disrespectful to her parents and during the course of the movie she has an epiphany and we're suppose empathize. BULL!. In this movie she goes home and actually loves her family. She doesn't mind running errands for her mother, milking the goat with her grandmother and digging up potatoes with her grandfather.  If for no other reason, I give this movie four stars because of her respect for her family.",1500422400,4,650,4.643478260869565

I think she should have given herself a smaller role and let someone trained be the lead. However on a girl boss level, I love that she took the initiative to make her own mark in the world. Why wait on someone to give you a lead role when you can create your own. She made some smart moves such as the setting was gorgeous and a welcome change from the typical big city backdrop, the camera work and editing was quality, and casting well known actress Jane Seymour was smart.",1498780800,2,631,4.266666666666667

I would say that it is more for girls/women because of the topic; however, I do think that it is a great family movie to watch, easy to see in big groups.

Fortunately, pretty much all of her relatives in Romania speak English so you don't have to read many subtitles.  The script is so sophomoric that if the actors are talented, you would never really know.  And as far as the main character, here's another lesson in not writing and also starring in your own movie -- the script is bad enough without casting such a mundane lead.  I will give it two positives:  Nothing exploded, and none of the characters vomited.",1488153600,4,629,4.571428571428571

True enough that in the romantic sense it might be a bit predictable (although still enjoyable to watch) but then there are the added elements of family and friendship that round out the story.  Danielle's family truly love and care about her and they show it.  And her friends stand by her and not only wish her well but work to bring about something good for her.  Even some of the music - which sounds Romanian - is fun and spunky.  In the background is the theme that clearly acknowledges that you don't need to be a size 0 to be beautiful.  Bravo since beauty can happen at any dress size!  Lots of good family friendly messages, fun to watch and definitely a feel good movie!  Enjoyed it!",1485216000,9,722,4.37593984962406

What are you teaching women, to just give up everything you believe in because you meet some guy and he takes you to dinner!! And of course the stupid stereo typical bull that vegans only eat salads and wheat-grass - such lies!!. This movie is everything wrong with society today: being healthy is only for skinny teenagers, but being over weight is some how accepted by society!? Being over weight is what causes disease and cancer. Also the fact that they seem to have a message saying never leave home because you will fail, and eventually you will have to go back home, absolutely ridiculous.

The scenery was amazing, made me wantg to fly to Romania for a visit.
The antique treacle Singer machine was a nice touch.
The message was well given and supported in the show. Also, the message regarding quality in a small company rather than the cheap garments from China was spot on. Believeable love story in this clean, fun movie.  I would even watch a part 2 of these likeable characters.
Great directing as it flowed at a fast pace with good acting",1535846400,,579,4.621359223300971
