8543579,4,B009PCXGQY,"What I know of the hacking culture has been sifted through mainstream media in which I have little faith. So I figure to watch this and fill in the blacks. This is valuable on many levels.

Here's the scoop. This documentary uses interviews and archival footage to plot the history of hacking up to, and including, the now (in)famous group ""Anonymous.""

This was both fascinating and unsettling at once. You have all these hacker rock stars, some who have done time for their supposed crimes, talking about their experiences in hacking as well as their philosophies regarding the freedom of information. It tells of how they targeted various groups they feel are operating against any given society's best interests. This would include the likes of The Church of Scientology, various banks and even, Mubarak's oppressive reign in Egypt. They talk of what they did to give these groups as hard a time as possible. And in the case of Egypt, they opened the floodgates of the government closed internet, allowing the citizens to connect to social media and bring Mubarak down.

The dicey part comes when you see some of them just causing trouble for no real reason. Then there is the question of when releasing information, as in the Wikileaks case, that as much harm as good may come of it. As the expression goes: Yes I like eating sausage, but do I really want to see how it's made? Running the world, and governments, is not pretty. Knowing what goes on behind the curtain might get really depressing. I don't know the answer but thinking about it makes me squirm.

That being said, this is a heck of a watch. It made me this as hard as I ever had about anything, and to me, that's a good thing. We are in a new age and this film should help us navigate the possibilities.",1473724800,,1773,4.60126582278481

8543582,5,B009PCXGQY,"What I had never considered was that revolutionaries are right here, active, political,
and the modern rebels use the internet!  I didn't know how expansive and numerous
they are and how purposeful.  I was impressed that they were able to intervene with
the Egyptian revolution and restore communications to the Egyptian people when Mubarack
shut down the internet.
  I hope their causes continue to be on the side of good and great!",1376179200,,433,4.972222222222222

Would that we all participated, held our criminal govt & institutions to task for grievous wrong-doings. And i learned a lot; lots of  background and history for a movement MSM appears not to want us to know much about. BRAVO!",1372118400,2,394,4.954545454545454
