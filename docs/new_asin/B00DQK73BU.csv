8596349,4,B00DQK73BU,A great film. If you are a movie buff i highly recommend owning a region free blu-ray player. They are easy to operate and open up a whole range of possibilities for special blu-ray purchases from other countries. Then you could play this and other wonderful classics without having to send them back.,1485993600,2,301,4.69811320754717
