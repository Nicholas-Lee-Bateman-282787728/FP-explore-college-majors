4571928,5,B00553K9Z8,"Why this film was not released in theaters I will never know,  It is inspiring, touching, and beautifully made.  Aiden Quinn gives a performance that would ordinarily be considered for an Academy Award.  I hope the movie finds a wide audience now that it has been released on DVD.",1313712000,5,280,4.673469387755102
4571929,5,B00553K9Z8,I have been a Wake Forest fan for years and remember when this tragic yet inspiring story happened. The movie captures everything so well that you can't help but feel for the Abbate family. It's such a touching story of how someone so young can affect so many people and the obstacles that the family had to overcome. I remember when the crowd would put up 5 fingers at the start of every 4th quarter and how it felt to be a united community around the family. And how the football team came together and were able to overcome the preseason disappointment of being picked to finish last in the conference. This movie is very inspiring and I highly recommend it to anyone. GO DEACS!!,1313020800,18,682,4.464

4571948,1,B00553K9Z8,The DVD does NOT PLAY!!! I ordered this to show in class for my 10th and 11th grade students to contrast a novel that we read previously. I ended up having to purchase the movie from another source because the DVD failed to play.  Through my PC it just brings up a bunch of files that state they cannot be played in any format.  I even requested a DVD player and still nothing.  This was an utter waste of money and class time.,1485129600,,427,4.120481927710843

It was difficult to get through, disjointed story line, slow, annoying, pleading music overlays dialogue through the first half of movie. It could be watchable but needs editing and story line work.

4571969,1,B00553K9Z8,"What a disappointment. This story starts well with a heart-wrenching story that suddenly drives off a cliff after 20 minutes. The screenplay, editing, acting, and directing all tumble together into an epic fail. In an avalanche of poorly acted melodrama, the viewer is thoughtlessly jerked through an endless montage of bad acting, boring football collages, family meltdowns, and lame inspirational monologues. Your spirits will soar because the credits start to roll.  But even the credits will leave you confused with photos of real people that didn't seem to be in the movie.  The strongest emotion you'll feel is relief that it's over.",1457740800,,639,5.254901960784314

4572028,1,B00553K9Z8,"After the funeral scene, the storyline began the very quick and painful slide into Crapdom, for which it festered there for the remaining hour and a bit.  The acting is atrocious.  The story is disjointed.  And because of that, any sentiment that the writers and director may have hoped to convey is horribly lost.  It's not very often that I actually begin to feel physically sick while watching a movie, but this one sure did the trick.  I shut it off during the ACC championship game sequence.  I just couldn't stand to see anymore of this drivel.  Bad, oh so bad.  Anyone associated with the making of this film should be ashamed of themselves.  I know I would be.",1410998400,,668,4.546218487394958

If you are fortunate enough to see this be sure to watch through the credits where you will see photos of the real people of whom this story was written.  Then go to the extras for about a six minute series of interviews that also include the family members.  This is a truly great story that will leave you with a warm feeling when it is over.",1410393600,2,531,4.28

It shows that even though they went through hard times they made it through them as a family which is something everyone should be able to relate to. Whenever you are going through a rough time no one can get you through them like the people you love. ,1409788800,,417,4.2

4572059,4,B00553K9Z8,"February 13, 2006, was a normal winter's day in a small suburb of Atlanta. Luke Abbate, a 15 year old High School Lacrosse star, accepts a ride home from a teammate. On the way the new driver decides to show off his driving skills by flying down the street at 90 MPH, when he loses control of the car. The car flies about 70 feet, injuring all the passengers and killing young Luke. It's a nightmare story that all families fear, when their kids start driving, the only difference about Luke's story is that it really happened. The 5th Quarter is a film dedicated to Luke's memory and tells the story of his family in the wake of such tragedy. As the film plays out, it starts to lean away from tragedy and toward triumph, the triumph of the 2006 Wake Forrest Championship Football team. There captain was John Abbate, Luke's brother. The team was supposed to finish dead last, but wound up having a miracle season. It is a story that was so well done, that it couldn't have been anything but a true story. I don't think any writer could have thought of a story like this. Ryan Merriman stars, once again in a sports drama, and of all his performances that I've seen, this had to be the strongest. Not only does he show tremendous athletic ability, but he takes the audience of a roller-coaster ride of emotion. Merriman was so good, that he even had a cold hearted cynic like myself, tearing up. Aidan Quinn and Andie McDowell play the matriarchs of the Abbate family, giving outstanding performances. They made the audience see and feel just what it was like for the Abbate family. Most films are meant to entertain, but the 5th Quarter does more than entertain, it tells a very important story and actually makes you feel something for the tragedies and hardships of other people. I was expecting to see a sports movies, instead I saw something that really made me think. Only the best the big screen has to offer can make you both think and feel for the characters.",1385251200,4,1969,4.5027932960893855

4572077,1,B00553K9Z8,"This could have been such a good movie but everything was just plain awful.
  It tries again and again to hit you in the face with heart-felt after after heatfelt scene that (and no disrespect to the family that this film is based on) it just starts to bore you.  The director seems to be able to take something that would normally make you emotional and turn it into something silly and I couldn't help but laugh at it.  Characters are introduced and dropped  as quickly as they appeared.
  When I said earlier that the acting was poor, I meant more of the fact that it just simply isn't how people would normally act in these circumstances. Yes, they would be crying, and yes, they would be angry but what these actors are doing doesn't ring true and I can't explain why. Maybe it's because you can feel the director forcing these actors to say and do things more so that they can get a dramatic effect rather than a realistic one.  When you are watching a film your not supposed to feel the director's voice dictating every single movement, you're supposed to feel like your watching something real and you are part of it.
  Overall, I hated this film, and I hate that I hated it because it's a true story, but it seems more that this film was made more for the sake of money rather than the sake of giving justice to the family that actually suffered through these events.",1371945600,,1376,4.403162055335969

I bought this movie because I had read a number of reviews recommending it as an inspirational Christian movie.  I'm sorry to say it was neither inspirational nor particularly Christian.  Yes, the Bible was mentioned and Scripture was read during the first 15 minutes of the movie; after that, Christian references were mostly nonexistent. The movie then tried to transform itself into a inspirational football movie.  It failed at that as well.  The supposed source of this inspiration was the character of Jon Abbate, the older brother of the automobile accident victim.  But how can a character be inspiring if he doesn't play?  For the greater part of the movie, Jon doesn't play football.  His ""comeback"" training scenes offer nothing to be inspired by ... and certainly nothing of a Christian message.  His private trainer takes all the credit for getting Jon back into ""fighting trim;""  there is certainly no glory given to God for any of the characters' recoveries.  And the coaches ... they couldn't have been much more lackluster about the ""miracle of the fifth quarter"" going on around them. This was particularly true of the head coach.  His speeches both to the team and to the alumni supporters certainly didn't add any drama or provide any inspiring wisdom to the movie.  Truly, the first 15 minutes of the movie are the most coherent; after that, the movie is struck by a schizophrenia of themes ranging from football to the way different family members deal with tragic difficulties to the miracle of organ donor programs.  (The ending with the organ recipient looked contrived and like a complete afterthought.  ""Oh yeah, we forgot about that lady we showed at the beginning having heart problems in the park.  Guess we need to bring her back into the story."")  Sticking to just any one of these themes could have made this a great movie, but trying to handle all these topics just ends up short-changing each of them.",1371168000,,2084,5.21021021021021

4572117,1,B00553K9Z8,"I am a former Christian Professor, and as such I feel The fifth quarter unfortunately down played prayer as a healing agent. While some reviewers say this movie has an uplifting and Christian spiritual component , I feel it does not show it. The movie did not even illustrate its help for the grieving family.  The tragedy that struck the 5 family members, and mainly the inability of the Father and son to handle the grief, seemed completely realistic and debilitating, butn the movie showed it was ONLY time that did the healing.  I did not see how the friendships and spiritual component was used to help them through it, or help the team. Why the remaining son studied boxing, and kick boxing to be a better line-backer (weight lifting helped) I will never understand. Also, while the message of seeking spiritual strength was handled ALMOST sublimely, and not in your face, the remaining son's apparently minimal contribution as a player also seemed to have little to do with the team's success. It even appears,from the scenes, they showed, to be mainly a 2nd string bench warmer. I only remember one lucky/good block and 2 assists that were helpful. I also failed to see where the title came from. Even the coach did not want to tie the success to the dead sons shirt number, or give any credit to God, but instead he gave it to HIS and the teams efforts. Now the real life nature of this movie and the family's helping the organ donation efforts was very touching and God bless their efforts, but this video did not try to stress that part until the very end when the father ""gropingly"" hugs the woman chest who had received his dead sons heart. Sorry, I think this flick missed the mark on many levels.",1332892800,6,1711,4.588235294117647

While in the end it's a feel good movie the journey through the film is rough.

Thirty minutes into it, I felt sick that I was actually laughing at times during the telling of such a tragic, true story.  Unfortunately, the film is just that horrible. The heavy-handed melodrama, constant sappy ballads, hammy overacting (except for Andie McDowell who was actually pretty good) and an endless flood of overwrought sobbing and breast-beating just made it unwatchable. It was as if the director felt he needed to constantly pound the viewer over the head with the suffering of the family and he was going to use every syrupy cliche in the book to do it with.

4572123,4,B00553K9Z8,"As a Wake Forest grad, it took me longer to see this movie than it should have.  One key point of this movie are the difficulties the Abbate family had in dealing with the death of one of their sons.  As a parent to 2 children, I can't imagine outliving one of them.  The story then moves into the almost impossible to comprehend season Wake Forest managed to put together with Jon Abbate as their spiritual leader.

I remember the 2006 football season at Wake and watched it closely from the beginning.  It seemed like their was something otherworldly happening.  Wake is a small NCAA division I school and somehow, after losing their starting quarterback and running back, beat GA Tech to win the ACC.  Again, this is a small school where most of the football team probably wanted to go to a school with a larger program.  They were expected to win one game in a season where they ended up shutting down  Calvin Johnson to take home an ACC title.  Jim Grobe did such an amazing job with this team.  Abbate was also just amazing to watch, he simply never let up all season and the whole ""5"" part of the story is real.  This is the part the movie simply cannot show you - the actual game coverage is a nice accent but the feeling of the season on the whole is almost lost although I'm not sure that any 1.5 hour movie could really do it justice.  Yes, this movie isn't perfect but trust me that the story is authentic and worth watching,",1329609600,,1437,4.337078651685394

Watching Lukes family cope with their grief and how his older brother helped them reminded me of how our family and friends helped my wife and me deal with our loss.

The Executive Producer, Bob McCreary, a former Wake Forest football star and successful businessman should be proud of this film. It will become a classic of how faith, friends and family are so important in our lives.

4572128,4,B00553K9Z8,"In life, nothing is certain.  Sometimes when things are going good, sometimes there are things that happen in life that can easily derail one's life.

In the case of ""The 5th Quarter"", the true story is about how tragedy derailed a family but how one young teenager's death, gave life to five individuals and how another son used his brother's memory gave him strength to overcome tragedy and eventually helped him as a college football player for Wake Forest University.

This is the story of the Abbate family which became an inspirational sports story but became a spiritual and inspirational film adaptation of the book by Rick Bieber (who would write and direct the film).

VIDEO:

""The 5th Quarter"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (widescreen 1:85:1).  It's important to note that the film is presented with various video sources.  For the majority of the film, ""The 5th Quarter"" looks good when featuring the shots made for the film.  There is a good amount of grain and also some detail.  But it's not a film where one can say the film completely has great picture quality because it incorporates a lot of video sources from archived Wake Forest University football matches.

So, while the first half of the film looks very good, the second half is where you see a lot of the football archived footage showcasing the rise of the Wake Forest football team when it was pegged to be the last place team of their conference.  And for some people, archived football footage may not be for them.  But for me, as a football fan and having watched many archived football footage on the NFL channel from the past 50-years, if you love football, the camaraderie of the sport and the excitement on the field and on the stands, it's those footage that Rick Beiber tries to capture in the film.

It's not perfect but he did manage to capture the team's winning season in the film using that footage and while it worked for me, the inconsistency of the picture quality for the film may not work for everyone.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""The 5th Quarter"" is presented in English 5.1 DT-HD Master Audio.  The film is primarily a dialogue-driven film with a lot of music, so it's front and center-channel driven which is expected from a film like ""The 5th Quarter"".  You do hear crowd ambiance through the surround channels, especially during a helicopter scene when Luke's body is being airlifted to the hospital.  But outside of that, the film is dialogue driven and dialogue is crystal clear.

For the most part, the lossless soundtrack is appropriate and for a lower budget film, I was not expecting an immersive soundtrack.

Subtitles are in English SDH, Spanish and French.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""The 5th Quarter"" comes with the following special feature:

  The Making of the 5th Quarter -(6:08) Interviews with the director Rick Beiber, the cast of the film and also the Abbate family and the making of ""The 5th Quarter"".

JUDGMENT CALL:

""The 5th Quarter"" is a spiritual, emotional and inspirational film that will touch but also break your heart.  It's a film that will make you cry and for the most part, it's a touching football film that is a Christian film but doesn't force it down anyone's throat.

It's a film that is similar to another tragic football film ""We Are Marshall"" but instead focuses on one football player and his family facing adversity during their darkest time.

But most importantly, how these individuals made it out of the dark after their lives were shattered by the sudden death of their beloved young son.

And this is a film in which both the real Steven and Maryanne Abbate were involved in and as difficult as their story is, it's also a film that brings attention to the importance of organ donation but how people can move on from suffering after a loved one's death.  It's not an easy process and its a hurt that remains with you for the rest of your life but it's a film that also shows how a community and how a university was very supportive to the family during their darkest days.

The family went on to form a foundation after Luke to increase awareness of organ donation but also the dangers of reckless driving and the film helps carry the message and gives a voice of the Abbate family and hoping the message reaches other people who watch the film.

I know there are film critics who are going to hate on this film.  One because it is a spiritual film and two, it is a film that focuses on a message and it's not exactly a big budget film with a storyline that focuses all on a death of a child and a family that wants justice.  It's not that type of film.

This is not a film that chooses to become anything artistic, nor is it a film that was meant to show what happened to the family members after Wake Forest University won the championship.  It's a spiritual film that carries on the message of the Abbate family and there will be people who are touched by the film and its message while others who are hoping to have a deep film along the lines of ""We are Marshall"" being disappointed.

The film's first half focuses on the death of Luke and how the family members deal with it but the second half of the film is about Jon Abbate playing at Wake Forrest University and how the team faced adversity after being touted as the team to be in last place.  Sure, the film uses archived video during the time Jon did play at Wake Forest  and yes, actor Ryan Merriman (""Final Destination 3', ""The Ring Two"") may not have the same body type compared to the real life Jon when you watch the archived football footage.

Sure there is a lot of archived Wake Forest University football footage from 2006 featured throughout the second half of the film and this is not a big-budget Hollywood film that could re-enact a lot of those football moments throughout the various seasons.  If anything, why did the second half focus on the football game versus the family?  It's because those games and team's winning season, was what gave the family that peace of mind during their darkest time of their lives.

For the Abbate family, seeing their older son Jon in a historic season for the Wake Forest Demon Deacons was a big thing for the family and the university was also very supportive towards the family.  Seeing him raise his five fingers to honor his brother was one thing, but then to see the team and then suddenly everyone in the bleachers doing the same, that probably was a bit support for the family.

Yes, there are unexplored storylines with characters such as the middle brother, Jon's girlfriend, Jon's good friend who helped bring him back home for training.  For me, these characters were good for the support to Jon and his family.  For me, It didn't matter in the storyline to focus on those moments.

The Hollywood Reporter's Kirk Honeycutt wrote, ""But hospital scenes, then funeral and lengthy testimonials mean little to an audience that doesn't know the deceased.""

While I can understand where Honeycutt is coming from towards his evaluation of the film, at the same time, when it comes to films that deal a lot with spirituality and faith....and yes, I mean Christian films, these films are created differently from normal theatrical films.  The same can be said with Christian music and commercial music.  They may share similarities but Christian music is about the message.

""The 5th Quarter"" is a film with a message.

So, as I can understand where Mr. Honeycutt and also  a few other people would make comments towards those scenes, those scenes are where the family's show their faith in God.  It's not driven down anyone's throat nor is made to preach that one should follow a certain religion but it does show how even the most spiritual families can also be shattered by tragedy and it takes time to heal.

A month ago, there was another inspirational/spiritual (and much bigger budget) film titled ""Soul Surfer"" in how the family held things together because of their faith after their daughter lost her arm to a shark.  Those scenes shown in that film with the church group and the family's dedication to their faith may not mean much to one who doesn't share the same feeling towards faith, and for ""The Fifth Quarter"", the funeral and testimonials, especially the hospital scenes made the film and the pain that the family and friends went through, seem so real.

But for those who are able to watch and understand the message of the film, if that message can save many lives...then the goal of the Abbate family and possibly also Rick Bieber made this film successful.  Also, a great emotional performance by Aidan Quinn (""Benny & Joon"", ""Legends of the Fall"", ""Unknown"") and Andie MacDowell (""Groundhog Day"", ""Short Cuts"", ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"").

As for the Blu-ray release, you get a short featurette featuring ""The Making of the 5th Quarter"".  It would be nice to have an audio commentary track or even give the family a short featurette to promote their foundation created in the memory for Luke.

The picture quality of course varies between the actual film and archived football footage but for the most part, I do believe that this is a film that many families can watch and be moved by it.  Those who have lost a young family member can possibly be inspired by it.  Because for the family, the pain still resides...these are not perfect people.  And they show that even having strong faith, it's hard for families to go on after a tragic incident but the fact is, through time, people will heal, through the support of friends and family but if anything... time.

""The 5th Quarter"" may not be for everyone, nor is it a perfect film but for an independent, spiritual and inspirational film with a lot of football incorporated to the film, I enjoyed it.  I was moved by it.  And yes, as a father... I found myself crying as well.

I recommend this film and this Blu-ray release!",1323993600,,9865,4.642281105990784

While I'll give the movie credit for the first 15 minutes, after that it just plain falls apart.  It is almost like watching a reality show - no real plot or story line.  The movie is supposed to be inspirational, but I missed that part.  When I think inspirational, I think Rudy, Hoosiers, The Blind Side, etc.  Movies that have a beginning, a middle and an end.  The 5th Quarter just seems to bounce all over the place.  After Lucas dies and his organs are donated to 5 different families, one of the brothers goes into a slump.  The movie shows one and only one scene where he is out drinking with his friends and they tell him he's had too much.  Hell, he doesn't even look like he's had one!  Next scene, he is in front of a physical trainer who says he can bring him back, but he's got to be ready.  Now, here I thought it would be something out of Rocky, with inspirational music and such...but, nothing.  So, after all this ""training"" you would think we would be seeing some awesome football plays.  No again.  The brother isn't even in hardly any of the mediocre football plays.  You see him on the bench quite a bit.  It is just so flat it is sad.  And at the end, the doorbell rings and a woman who received Lucas' heart shows up and the house with her daughter.  Once again, dad breaks down and cries.  The woman doesn't say more than a word or two.  We don't know why she dropped by, how she knew who the donor was, etc.  See...now I'm rambling, just like the movie.  It's like watching a home movie or something the family put together.

I was reluctant to see this film because, as the mother of a teenage son, the last thing I want is to explore is the feelings I would have if he suddenly were taken from me. It was touted as being uplifting though, so I went ahead. I'm sorry I did. As a fan of Aiden Quinn, I'm aghast at how relentlessly he over acted in this film. Andie MacDowell, as his wife looked so uncomfortable throughout, I wondered if it was because she was embarrassed by her co-star's antics. Sad? I'll say it was sad. I had tears streaming down my cheeks the whole time. If jerking tears were the only requirement for a good movie, this film would be considered a masterpiece as it's the only thing the director does well. He hits you so hard and so frequently over the head with the tragedy of the situation that, when the family finally cheers up at the end when they meet the recipient of their son's heart, the viewer is still depressed. There is a lot of football footage that is kind of random and feels like you're flipping through the sports channels on a remote. It's like a student produced recruitment effort for the Wake Forest football team.  The young man who plays the brother of the boy who died is a good looking guy but he's been saddled with limp stringy hair that is so bad it's distracting. Also distracting are the sappy songs that keep cropping up with the lyrics competing with the actors' dialogue. There is also some reading from the Bible and inspirational talks from various characters which are delivered in such a ham handed way that resembles a Davy and Goliath episode. I found myself asking if there really was a story worthy of being made into film here. If you look at the content of the true story, you'd have to say ""yes"" but this film is clearly not worthy of that story. I feel especially sorry for the family to have to endure the insult of such an amateurish effort at depicting what they went through.

More then a sports movie, this is more of a christian themed film about dealing with loss.  This was a good movie overall.  While I enjoy a feel good type movie like this one, the big problem I had with this is that (like most christian movies) everything seems to perfect and when the main character begins his quest there is not much that stops him.  This movie is very heart-wrenching in parts, but the poor acting takes away from the emotion. Overall, this is a good movie, but the fact that everything works out a little too well and the bad acting makes this a little worse then I wanted it to be.  I did like it though. I give it a B-.
