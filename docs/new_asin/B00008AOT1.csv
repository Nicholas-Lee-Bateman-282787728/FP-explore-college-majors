7981102,2,B00008AOT1,Very raw and poor grainy video in some of them. A few different blues black musicians playing guitar in different performances. Never seen or heard the musicians.,1361145600,,162,5.037037037037037

7981104,5,B00008AOT1,"This dvd is nearly perfect. Firstly, I'll state the few complaints I have: the audio quality was especially poor during Johnny Shines' performances and two of Jesse Fuller's pieces were filler. Aside from these minor imperfections, this dvd is an excellent historical and musical item. The Son House performances are full of magnificent power, Jesse Fuller's ""Johny Henry"" is an epic that falls short only of Furry's version on his ""Shake 'Em On Down"" album and Pink Anderson's version, Mississippi Fred McDowell is in excellent form, although he's even better on the Yazoo dvd with Big Joe Williams, Furry Lewis plays a little sloppily and probably should have been given time for another song, Johnny Shines dazzles us with his original lyrics and incredibly powerful voice, and Mance Lipscomb plays better than he does on his ""In Concert"" dvd. If you are a fan of the Country Blues, you should buy this right now!",1213056000,6,916,4.954545454545454
