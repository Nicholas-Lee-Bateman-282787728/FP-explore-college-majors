AMISH GRACE is based on real events. With this movie, we can compare and contrast two very different mothers, one the mother of a victim, the other the mother of the shooter, and see how, though there are differences, there are also many ways that they are the same.

If you have ever had trouble forgiving someone else, then this movie is for you, because there can be no higher example of forgiveness than that of a mother forgiving someone for murdering her daughter.

SAVING SARAH CAIN shows how the Amish community comes together to support their own, but at the same time, showing the temptations that affect the younger generation. Sarah's sister died without leaving a will, which means that Sarah is the only person who can keep the five children out of the foster care system.

Five children who have known nothing except life in an Amish community suddenly find themselves confronted with life in the big city, and must react to temptation, each in their own way.

This is a wonderful collection. I will be watching these movies again, and again. I highly recommend them.",1428364800,,1300,4.709251101321586
8639279,5,B00I4ODX6W,"Great message for BOTH MOVIES !....AMISH Grace is a good movie, but I have grown up and lived around Amish. My next door neighbor is the Amish school teacher to the local Amish school and this movie lacks HOW Amish speak/ act . They acted more ""English"" in reference to Amish Grace, BUT  saving Sarah Cain is a REALLY GOOD movie and it better depicted how Amish speak/ act...",1422662400,,375,4.434782608695652
