845238,5,6304340486,Have not seen this movie since it was released back in the 80's. Was thrilled to see Stallone at his best.,1504310400,,106,4.095238095238095
845239,1,6304340486,"Okay, so I'm the 399th person to review this film on Amazon. I'll first start by quoting from Leonard Maltin's Movie Guide. ""Stallone wraps himself in the American flag and fights for the greater glory of mankind."" Every other cop in the film was a stick figure while Stallone was a giant. When I first saw this film as a kid I thought it was the greatest of films. Now I realize that it is a waste of time for anyone to view. What little plot there is, is so full of stupid inconsistencies that one can only get shake their head.

Who were these people? Presumably a cult from their pedantic chanting behavior. Yet they also seemed to be a motorcycle gang using the most ridiculous tactics I've ever seen when it came to trying to overwhelm two or three people in a motel. Also, why would Brian Thompson, the man who was seen by Brigitte Nielsen panic about having been seen? She couldn't ID him as he'd never been arrested. And if he had been arrested, why would he risk going after her in the hospital. There are so many plot holes in this screenplay that one can only...that's right, shake their head.

Leonard Maltin gave this film One and a Half Stars out of Four. That Translates to Two Stars out of Five Stars. I'm not even going to be that generous. One Star and One Star only. Seeing Stallone mow down scores of cultists was as high a score as this film deserves. Buy it at your own risk. This is Stallone's worst film and I mean worst!

845509,4,6304340486,"I first saw this movie when my parents first rented the VHS roughly 30 years ago and loved it ever since! Stallone plays LAPD Lieutenant Marion Cobretti, the commander of the notorious Zombie Squad, unit of renegade cops tasked with the dirties jobs no other cops want. Brigitte Neilsen is a witness to a gruesome murder committed by an army of serial killers hell-bent on creating a New Order. Predictably, the psychotic army of killers led by Brian Thompson pull no punches and spare no expense in hunting Neilsen's character Ingrid Knudsen down. Complicating matters further is the stereotypical (but highly accurate) stonewalling and general ignorance of the police brass. Add it all together and you have an '80's blockbuster.",1481155200,,731,5.1

845512,5,6304340486,"I love action and I love babes, thats a fact so obviously I loved this movie. Stallone does it all! He beats up punks and gets laid by hot chicks, especially hot chicks. This movie blew my mind, it also scared me a little bit because the cult that Cobra has to fight was scary. Also, the action is great and I love his cop sidekick who is always trying to get Cobra to let loose even though Cobra is already loose because he hangs loose. The guy knows how to clean guns and the streets! But don't worry there are even some cool funny parts that maybe girls will like, like when we find out that Cobras first name is Marion because it sounds like a girls name LOL. If you don't like this movie then you don't like me and you're probably not into anything cool like 80s action movies or Sylvester Stallone or hot chicks. This movie is definitely going in my top number one list!",1479254400,,876,4.189349112426036

845576,5,6304340486,"I saw this movie in the theaters when it first came out in 1986!  I absolutely Love this movie.  In this film, I think Stallone blended First Blood's John Rambo character with Clint Eastwood's Dirty Harry and Outlaw Josey Wales characters.  I can surely see all three characters in Cobra!

I just recently ordered a handmade Night Slasher knife that the bad guy used in this movie.  I ordered it made with the high end D2 steel...The spikes too which are screwed in actually, and can be screwed out!  I also ordered it with slightly longer, beefier blade than the movie one.  Still, my interest repeated regarding this movie and with ordering this knife.  So I decided to watch the movie again!  I'm sure I will watch it again once I receive my knife!

845676,3,6304340486,"COBRA another stallone film produced by the Cannon films company Golan & Globus
originally this film was supposed to be longer 120mins
but tragically it was cut down by Cannon to about 90-95mins
mainly cause back in 1986 when this film was previewed before actual theatrical release
TOP GUN was released in cinemas
so for some reason Cannon removed alot of scenes about 30mins worth before they actually released in Cinemas
 i have seen the original workprint version  screen ratio is 1:33:1 full screen ofcourse
 and the picture quality is VHS quality really & the sound is Mono
so it's tolerable to watch, the runtime is about 120mins there's no intro or end credits
i can definitely tell where the workprint scenes are inserted with the Theatrical cut scenes
but the story makes more sense & the violence is more Graphic
in my opinion the workprint version is much better version than the average Theatrical version no Doubt about it
tragically the workprint version still has not been officially released & may not ever be released
warner bros owns the rights to COBRA who also hold the rights to the workprint version so don't hold your breath
if by some miracle WB do release the workprint version to the public someday
i don't think they'll Digitally remaster it, they might clean up the picture quality a bit & boost the sound quality to master stereo mix
but i think it'l be just straight VHS transfer to DVD or blu-ray
so for now fans of COBRA will have to try getting a bootleg copy of it floating on the internet somewhere.
as for this new Blu-ray reissue of the Theatrical version
the HD transfer is pretty Good, the sound quality is only a master audio 2.0 stereo mix
the only extras is behind the scenes making of- filmed for TV broadcast back in 1986
the Deleted workprint scenes are not on the blu-ray
obviously WB did not bother added them as extras
but there's audio commentary with Director George cosmatos which was recorded for the old dvd release
3 stars for this new blu-ray reissue, probably 5 stars for the workprint version if it ever gets an official release",1468540800,,2086,4.663043478260869
845677,4,6304340486,"Stars. George P. Cosmatos and Sylvester Stallone make a movie that is everything right and wrong about 80s action movies. Loosely based on Paula Goslings Novel, Fair Game, Stallone wrote the script and stars as the title character, Cobretti. The movie follows an elite member of the LAPD, Marion Cobretti, who is only summoned when they need him. In typical fashion he doesnt follow the rules to get things done. When a model and businesswoman (Brigitte Nielsen) witnesses a murder by a group called the New Order and lead by The Night Slasher, its up to Cobra to protector her and rid the world of the bad guys. As the story goes, Stallone was cast for Beverly Hills Cop (1984), a role later given to Eddie Murphy. Stallone wanted to make the move more action-oriented and less comedic. The studio rejected the idea for being too expensive and Stallone left the movie. He went on to make Cobra. The original version was rated X for graphic violence and was edited down to get the R-rating. After the release of the hit, Top Gun (1986), Stallone and Casmatos were afraid that it would be overshadowed. They again edited the move down from two hours to an hour and half, so they could get in an extra screening each day. While Cobra was critical failure, being sighted for poor plotting, dialogue, gratuitous violence, and rehashing action cliches, the movie still killed in the box-office. They did rip off Terminator (1984) with the use of the red site on the fun and factory end battle, with a very iconic ending of Cobra handing the The Night Slasher on a hook. It was nominated for six Razzie Awards; Worst Picture, Worst Actor (Sylvester Stallone), Worst Actress (Brigitte Nielsen), Worst Supporting Actor and Worst New Star (both for Brian Thompson) and Worst Screenplay. The movie has since moved onto cult status for being awesome 80s schlock with quotable lines and cheesy (but memorable) action scenes. Director Nicolas Winding Refn and Ryan Gosling are fans, which is why Goslings character in Drive (2011) had a toothpick in mouth similar to Cobras matchstick. Its definitely one of those 80s movies that is so bad thats good. Like any classic horror movie or bad Cannon Production of the period, its mindless fun thats worth watching.",1468454400,,2247,4.808785529715762

They crammed in almost every action movie cliche they could think of; such as the tough-on-crime maverick cop who always gets the job done even though his superiors don't like his tactics. And at the end of the movie, the cop gets offered a promotion, which he turns down.

To say the characters in this movie are one-dimensional would be an exaggeration. They showed no character development throughout the entire movie. Neither the main hero (Cobra) nor the main villain (Night Slasher) are given any kind of backstory. In fact, the villain was just called ""Night Slasher"", he didn't even get a name. A psychopathic killer called ""Night Slasher"" would have been better suited for a horror movie, not a generic 1980s Sylvester Stallone shoot-em-up.

No cast member in this movie gave a memorable performance. All were instantly forgettable. I think this movie's only redeeming quality was the death of ""Night Slasher."" Now that was a pretty sweet death scene!",1456790400,,1012,4.947058823529412

There is no-let-up action; lots of killings. At one point Stallone faces a couple of dozens of murderers.

This movie was also Stallone's original vision for Beverly Hills Cop when he was initially involved in making that film and features a pretty impressive soundtrack featuring some of the artists Stallone used in his previous classic Rocky IV the year before he did this one. Overall, it's an 80's action fan's dream.",1450569600,,735,4.75

846132,3,6304340486,"Released in 1986, ""Cobra"" stars Sylvester Stallone as Lieutenant 'Cobra' Cobretti, an atypical LAPD cop who investigates serial murders by the so-called Night Slasher (Brian Thompson). Reni Santoni plays Cobras partner and Brigitte Nielsen his potential babe.

The Story goes that the Stallones script for Cobra was to be Beverly Hills Cop with Stallone in the role that Eddie Murphy played in that 1984 movie, but Stallone dropped out two weeks before shooting because the producers insisted that his ideas were over-budget. A couple days later Eddie signed on resulting in massive rewrites to include his witty comedic flair. Despite these last-minute changes Beverly Hills Cop was a great mid-80s cop thriller and the #1 film in the USA in 1984 and #2 worldwide.

So Sly took his script and made Cobra, which simply isn't in the same league as Beverly Hills Cop. It has a palpable comic book schlock tone and pales in comparison to all five of the Dirty Harry flicks and 1977s The Gauntlet. This is surprising since Stallone was riding a wave of success at the time with Rambo II and Rocky IV being massive hits a year earlier.

This isn't to say that there aren't any entertaining aspects to Cobra, because there are several. For one, Cobretti is the epitome of cool. Secondly, Thompson plays a great villain frothing at the mouth with malevolence. Thirdly, there are some thrilling action sequences, overdone though some of them are, like the ridiculous car chase. Fourthly, the climax in the factory is so effective that 1991s Terminator 2 ripped it off. And, lastly, the role of Ingrid (Nielsen) is tastefully done. She doesn't get naked once and there's no gratuitous sex scene, plus they try to give her a personality and she gets in on the action at the end. She was a pretty good damsel in distress and its cute seeing the chemistry of Nielsen and Sly as they were a couple in real life and married from 1985-1987.

While these positives may make Cobra an 80s cult flick or guilty pleasure, they don't turn it into a good movie. Its too Grade B schlocky for that. Just because you like it doesnt mean its a good movie.

The film runs 87 minutes and was shot in the Los Angeles area.

846525,5,6304340486,"Like another reviewer commented, they simply don't make movies like this anymore! If ever there was a candidate/poster child to represent what 80s action films were all about this film would be it. At its heart, it's actually a pretty good detective story. Marion ""Cobra"" Cobretti (Stallone) is tasked with solving a series of murders attributed to a serial killer the press has dubbed ""The Nightslasher"". I don't want to give anymore away in case there are those who have yet to see this awesome movie, but thats the gist of the story. And of course, it fills every 80s action movie cliche like a checklist. Misunderstood, but well meaning bad-good guy cop? Check! Best friend /partner that tries to keep him in line? Check! The clueless lieutenant? Check! The angry Captain? Check! Over the top violence and lots of it? Check! Massive body count? Check! and so forth including that awesome 80s music. Interesting trivia about this film, the Director, George Cosmatos previously directed Rambo II and later went on to direct one of the best westerns ever made, Tombstone. Also, sharp viewers may remember that Reni Santoni (Cobretti's partner) and Andrew Robinson (the police lieutnenant) had previously worked together in another famous film (with an almost similar plot)...Dirty Harry! Reni Santoni was Dirty Harry's partner and Andrew Robinson played the ""Zodiac killer"". And finally (and my favorite) keep an eye and ear out for the reporter that hassles Stallone outside of the grocery store at the beginning of the film. I say keep an ear out because while you might not recognize him at first, as soon as you hear his voice you'll know...it's the Nu-Wave oven infomercial guy!",1421712000,,1684,4.99644128113879

846527,5,6304340486,"This movie is so bad that it is good. I grew up in the 80s with TV addicted parents and my dad had to have the full cable package, keep in mind it would have been around 40 channels, with all the premium channels and it was those channels that exposed me to many violent R-rated cheesy action films with names like Stallone, Schwarzenegger, Van Damme, Lundgren and Norris taking down bad guys single-handed. I have not seen this movie since those days, but my interest was peaked after listening to an episode of ""How did this get made?"" and remember the insanity of this film. Stallone plays Marion 'Cobra' Cobretti, part of the Zombie Squad, and is trying to stop a serial killer called the Night Slasher. He is convinced that it is a gang (yep, an axe murdering gang) and none of the superiors believe him. A model named Ingrid (Brigitte Nielsen) witnesses the Night Slasher and she goes into witness protection with Cobra as the protection. The movie then moves into Stallone killing a ton of people and getting the girl.
There isn't much in the way of special features, but I just enjoyed it for the movie itself. When I received my copy I ordered a pizza and had a trip back to Reagan's America with this movie along with ""Commando,"" ""I Come In Peace"" and ""Road House."" I wonder if Stallone will bring Cobra back the way he has Rocky and Rambo since the movie was very successful. If you are a fan of these type of movies then check out Cobra and watch him battle the most inept axe murdering gang in pure 1980s action.",1421452800,,1525,4.430604982206406

My hope in watching this movie after so many years was that it may have aged well, but no dice!

Stallone looks great as his 80's self, but the movie premise is rife with 80's action movie cliche's: terrible attempts at creating memorable one-liners -- ""You're the disease and I'm the cure"" (ooh pleeze *rolls eyes*), gratutious violence, and horrid acting. For example, as Stallone's character and Bridgette Nielsen's character attempt to establish Cobra's backstory (oddly enough, this occurs after about three-fourths of the movie is completed), my bestie and I weren't too involved in the movie and we didn't hear what the characters' discussion revolved around.

847212,3,6304340486,"""Cobra"" is an interesting film for its 80's politics and ""police vs. the scumbag criminals"" attitude that it so vehemently makes clear. While the bad guys in this film certainly deserve to be wiped off the face of the Earth, the politics are too obvious, the dialogue too silly, the story too protracted, and the music too pop-oriented. If you like Stallone you'll like it of course, but this isn't a pleasant film, and yet it is nonetheless enjoyable on a violent, ignorant kind of level, where one's brain is hijacked by a sense of exuberance on the level of watching a traffic accident--you feel guilty, but you look anyway. It's also hard to take George Cosmatos seriously as a filmmaker (obviously), but I did like his ""Of Unknown Origin"" and that film was rewarding on many levels. ""Cobra"" I will watch just for its nostalgic value, its over-the-top villains, its fast pacing, and its attempt to work from a literary source (a Paula Gosling novel that the film doesn't resemble in the slightest--but I hope Paula got paid well at least). What is also interesting is how this film's politics compare to those of ""Dirty Harry""--Stallone's Marion Cobretti isn't quite Eastwood's Harry Callahan, but they both are preserving that Wild West attitude of cowboys gunning each other down in the streets (so to speak). ""Cobra"" continues these conservative politics in a serious way, but Stallone's character is less brutal, and he also is fairly humorless. It's his job to kill these bad guys, but for Callahan it was a passion, a pleasure (even here in this violent study we can detect society's softening attitude towards violent criminal justice, best represented in the film by Robinson, who played a great psycho himself in the original ""Dirty Harry""). I always thought it interesting that Siskel and Ebert used to discuss the most pointless films at the greatest length, probably because simple-minded films like this tend to do well at the box office. Whether their cult status holds up years later on DVD and home video and BluRay is another matter, but ""Cobra"" is fun as a Stallone vehicle, much more unpleasant and absurd in its paranoia-driven plot details.
The Warner DVD is great, as usual, and the commentary by Cosmatos is a fun listen, but it isn't an essential purchase unless you enjoy nostalgia. Since I remember it from childhood, I have to watch it every once in a while. I know...I have an attitude problem. But it's just a little one...",1388016000,,2456,4.836104513064133

847216,5,6304340486,"Sylveter Stallone creates another electrifying American hero in the ROCKY/RAMBO mold: Cobretti the cop, a fearless dispenser of justice out to stop a gang of serial killers.

In the opening scene of this thoroughly mindless action flick, a psycho holds a group of terrified hostages in a grocery store, and yells to renegade cop Marion Cobretti (Sylvester Stallone) that he's going to blow the place to kingdom come. ""Go ahead,"" says the cop nicknamed ""Cobra,"" presumably because he's tightly coiled and strikes with deadly force. ""I don't shop here"" and so it goes with this brutal and for the most part disgusting Stallone showcase, in which Sly's then wife(Brigitte Nielsen) provides bad acting and ample cleavage as a fashion model (what else?) who's the only witness against a crazed cult of serial killers.

Cobra likes to kill first and leave the questions to his disgruntled superior officers, who call on the maverick lawman when all other options have failed. This movie does have a modest following, and for what it's worth, a few of the action sequences are disjointedly exciting.

COBRA also takes me back to memory lane to when it was theatrically released in the Summer of 1986 when I was 13 going on 14 years old in the 8th grade and to when I saw it on HBO for the very first time in the Summer of 1987.",1387324800,,1320,4.730434782608696

847288,3,6304340486,"After rewatching COBRA after an interval of many years, I didn't know whether to rate it one star, because its so ridiculously, God-awfully silly, stupid and over-the-topor to rate it five stars for that exact same reason. So I compromised and gave it three.

Marion Cobra Cobretti would hate me for that. He doesnt like compromise.

In fact, Marion Cobra Cobretti doesnt like much of anything, except chewing on matchsticks, driving his 50s muscle car, and mowing down criminals like a drunken redeck knocking tin cans off a fence with a machine gun. Who is Marion Cobra Cobretti, you ask? Well, if Clint Dirty Harry Eastwood and Charles Death Wish Bronson had a baby, and that baby was Godfathered by Arnold Commando Schwarzenegger, the answer would be Marion Cobra Cobretti, the head (and seemingly almost the only member of) The Zombie Squad, an LAPD detective unit called in when wishy-washy nonsense like Miranda and the Bill of Rights fail. And at the films opening, Cobra (Sylvester Stallone) is called in to deal with a psycho who has just shot up a grocery store at Christmas. This displeases Cobrettis immediate boss, wishy-washy Monty (Andrew Robinson), who knows where Cobretti goes, a litter of spent shell casings and bloody corpses will follow. But F Monty and those bleeding heart liberal reporters, because the truth is that crime is a disease, and Cobra is the cure  so he tells the psycho before first stabbing and then finally riddling him with bullets. Afterwards, the reporters ask if this killing had any connection to the Night Slasher case. Monty says no, which of course means that there IS a connection to whatever the hell the Night Slasher case may be, and that the Cobra will soon discover what it is.

(Behind those mirrored shades lies the investigative savvy of a Sherlock Holmes, believe me.)

But who is the Night Slasher, you ask? The Night Slasher (Brian Thompson) is the jut-jawed leader of a gang of homicidal maniacs who go out every night and viciously murder Angelinos with sharp or blunt instruments, evidently for the hell of it. He spews nonsense about creating a new world by slaughtering the weak but really, hes just evil scum  precisely the sort of scum Cobrettis .45 ACP slugs were made to splatter all over downtown Los Angeles. And when the Slashers gang drops the ball (or rather, the axe) by leaving a witness alive to one of its random slayings, the ball gets a-rollin. See, ole Slasher has what you might call an unforgettable face  it screams I AM THE NIGHT SLASHER, ASK ME ABOUT MY DISMEMBERMENT SPECIALS. So naturally he wants to locate this witness, a model named Ingrid (Bridgette Nielsen at her most horror-movie hapless) and hack her into chum before she can finger him. And Cobra, see, he doesnt want this, so you just know the two men  Slasher n Cobra  are gonna butt their sweaty, furrowed brows.

What follows is the sort of wanton mayhem only the 1980s, mingled with Stallone, could possibly produce. People get impaled. Vehicles get wrecked. Millions of bullets get expended. And Sly grates out stone-faced one-liners while setting people on fire. Seriously, the last twenty or so minutes of this film feature a freaking WW2 movie level of violence, with what seems like hordes of motorcycle-riding psychos testing out the dubious theory that leather biker jackets can stop submachinegun rounds, and Bridgette Nielsen reminding us why her career lasted about as long as a Viagra erection (four hours if you believe the commercials). But don't sweat it, folks, because what would traumatize you for life is just another day in the life of Marion Cobra Cobretti, a man so tough he slices his pizza with scissors!

COBRA is either a great awful movie or just a greatly awful one. Stallone, not exactly known for the subtlety of his worldview, is essentially remaking DIRTY HARRY here  even going so far as to cast two men who were in that film, Robinson and Reni Santoni  but the fact is, as iconic as Sly is, hes no Clint Eastwood, and no amount of burning gasoline, spent gunpowder and roasting human flush can mask the stench coming off the crappy acting, horrible writing and submoronic plot of this film. The difference between a hugely entertaining bad movie like COMMANDO and one which causes you to hold your head in your hands and make feeble groaning noises is subtle, but its there, and COBRA too-often strays into the latter category, probably because Sly, unlike Arnold, did not know at this stage of his career the secret of how to make fun of himself and boast at the same time. But if you're in the right mood  bloodthirsty, silly, 80s-nostalgic  you will probably enjoy the antics of Marion Cobra Cobrettiat least until you can lay your hands on a copy of RAMBO: FIRST BLOOD PART TWO.",1386720000,,4768,4.797560975609756

Stallone is easily one of the 2 or 3 worst actors of all time.  He is also, tragically, one of the most prolific.  Once he latches onto a cinematic idea that more than 5 or 6 people will buy into, he assaults the living universe with sequel after ever more odious sequel, until the universe begs him for mercy.

Stallone plays one of his better parts as an anti-political correctness, status quo member of society, nitro-injected and laser focused as a police lieutenant in Los Angeles. The movie kicks off immediately establishing his Cobra character, called upon when the other police resources will not work, for situations nobody else wants to address. Justice administered correctly and quickly in fully justified situations. Additionally, the Cobra character has a highly intelligent side many in the movie over look or simply do not recognize. This is an absolutely action packed, exciting, well acted and fun movie to watch, if one enjoys the serious kick ass action films of this genre. I highly recommend watching this young Sylvester Stallone express many personas, many unexpected, in this character. Oh!

847672,4,6304340486,"Why do Sylvester Stallone movies always have such bad acting? I've often wondered. Finally, I think I understand. Stallone, himself, is a terrible actor and there's no way to remediate it except to surround him with equally bad actors, either the good guys or the bad guys. Except for the women, of course and they're usually much better and quite beautiful. Does this work? Well, in Cobra, the acting is just awful, but does anyone care? I think not. You watch a Stallone movie for the unrelenting action, the really extended chase scenes, the destruction and violence, the body count and, yes, everything is so extreme that it's actually funny. All these things come together in Cobra. Who cares if the story  doesn't make particularly good sense? To notice that a functioning steel mill has no workers is just being picky. Of course it has no workers, they're filming a Stallone movie, you idiot.

Cobra, AKA Marion Cobretti, is a typical Stallone movie. It's very entertaining even though it doesn't make good sense and the acting is atrocious. I should indicate that the production of the movie is quite good. The stunts, especially in the car driving scenes, are spectacularly done, except that I hated to see that beautifully customized '50 Mercury destroyed. Well, they made up for it with the scene where Stallone was machine-gunning a good-sized contingent of hotly pursuing motorcyclists from standing in the back of a speeding pickup truck. How do they ever do those scenes? How do they make them look so realistic? I wonder what the body count in this movie was anyhow. Let's not worry about it. Cobra was Stallone being Stallone ad it made for an entertaining evening of watching.

847788,3,6304340486,"When the film begins there is a voice over saying something like, ""Every 5 minutes in America there is a robbery, every 10 minutes there is murder, every 20 minutes a rape"". Then it shows a shadowy character clinking together two axes above their head. I kind of suspected vigilant's. Instead the bad guys are an underworld army trying to forement a revolution and as a group they clink their axes and picks above their heads. It might have made some sense if this were filmed in the 1960's or early 70's. Instead it has a more timeless feel to it but perhaps it's just a film that makes no sense at all, at least in any kind of real world way. For some reason Cobra did better in Europe than in America. A more interesting review might try and explain why.

This is basically a copy of the Dirty Harry movies with Sylvester Stallone in the lead instead of Clint Eastwood. It seems careful not to do more than that as if the producers didn't take time to investigate what real cops do and instead based this on other cop movies.

In some ways the character of 'Cobra' played by Stallone is more grounded in reality than Dirty Harry. He doesn't give his superiors quite as hard a time as Harry does and there are less speech like statements about 'justice'. In some ways the film is farther 'out there' in Cobra's exotic taste in weapons, clothing and cars. In one scene he's wearing a fancy black overcoat more like something Wesley Snipes would later wear playing a vampire.

The mad criminal in the first Dirty Harry movie, the unlucky punk, plays a police chief in this movie. You expect this is a redeeming movie or something but instead Cobra punches this police chief for being less than helpful. At the end, after capturing the bad guys, the chief tells Cobra, ""No hard feelings""? Cobra punches him one and replies, ""No hard feelings"" There are other surprises as well in that Cobra will get his car crashed up in chases and not always get his man. For me, the best thing about the film are the scenes with no dialog and nice background music that make it seem more like a music video.

2/3rds of the way through the film we learn for the first time the main characters last name is 'Cobretti', so I suppose we could consider this a serious movie instead of the kind of dumb one it really is. When the film came out it received a trouncing from critics. A favorite critique was about the scene where Cobra is riding in the back bed of a pickup truck while firing a machine gun at a number of biker's chasing him, ""would you really chase after someone firing a machine gun at you while riding a motorbike?"". I took this as a way to show the fanaticism of the criminal gang the city faced. It must be a huge gang, apparently. Cobra must kill or incapacity over 100 criminals but they just keep coming as if they are baddies spawned by a video game. At least twice it's explained that Cobra works on the 'Zombie Squad'. Considering the abandon with which Cobra wastes bad guys the squad might be aptly named. If there were allusions here touching on zombie movies which were popular at the time the references must have been deleted before the final edit.

I give this 3 stars because I liked some of the fantasy elements to the movie and I liked the portions that reminded me of music videos of the era. At least it has something to recommend it. I think I may have actually liked the character Cobra, at least compared to all the other cops - Dirty Harry, Axle Foley, Mel Gibson and Bruce Willis and Jackie Chan.

847867,3,6304340486,"COBRA is the ultimate ""bad"" Sly action film, made when he was hot-trotting with Nielsen, an actress of dubious talent.

SPOILERS AHEAD!

As police Lt. Marion Cobretti, '50s throwback Stallone mumbles his way through sentences of six words or less. My faves: ""Hey dirtbag! You're a lousy shot. I don't like lousy shots!"" and ""You're the disease... I'm the cure."" Here, Sly takes on a small army of ""New World Order"" thugs who have been killing randomly chosen victims with knives and hatchets. When Nielsen (in a bad blonde wig) scarfs an eyeload of their leader (Thompson), the entire mob comes after her.

For no explicable reason, she falls in love her cop guardian, Mumbles Cobretti  and they ""do it"" in a cheesy motel room while the gang, tipped off by Nielsen's bullish policewoman chaperone (Garlington), closes in. After Sly wipes out several dozen of these Harley riding fiends without sustaining a scratch, the two lovers ride off on a purloined bike. This film was a huge misstep for Stallone, one that left him with the still persisting (if inaccurate) stigma that he's stupid and tongue-tied.

Santoni reprises his&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/DIRTY-HARRY/dp/B001EC0OQI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">DIRTY HARRY</a>&nbsp;(1971) role of the star cop's sidekick. In both films, he doesn't have a lot of luck. Robinson, who was the crazed serial killer hunted down by Inspector Callahan in that same classic picture, brings more than a touch of Scorpio's insanity to his role of Det. Monte. We're not sure why, but he passionately hates Cobretti and is constantly insulting and annoying him. You just know that before the final credits, Monte's gonna be spitting out teeth.

Other character clich&eacute;s abound here along with a pass&eacute; and intrusive '80s music track and a plug for a Colorado brew. Unlike fine wine, COBRA has not improved with age. Only for devoted Sly fans.

The story begins in a grocery store where a man starts shooting with a 12-gauge pump shotgun. [Senseless violence!] The police arrive to try to stop this maniac. One man goes inside to stalk the killer. [Who wrote this script? Note the product placement.] ""The show is over."" There is another scene with two cars. The television set plays Christmas advertising. [Peace on earth?] The ""Night Slasher"" is a serial killer who has fifteen victims so far. Two men attack a lone woman in a car. The knife wounds linked her to the other murders. Do they need more policemen? There is another killing in a parking garage. The police interview the survivor. It was too dark to see details, she says. Will the killer try to complete his attack? Cabretta arrives to stop the two villains. But one continues to hunt the survivor.

A fire alarm brings everybody out of their hospital rooms, saving the survivor. They have a plan to take the survivor to a safe house. But the villains knows this and prepare a trap. There is a car chase on the highway, then through an alley, and into a parking garage. A lot of shooting and explosions. Cars bouncing off ramps and bridges! ""Oh my God!"" There is a conflict among the police over the proper policy to be followed. ""You gotta have faith."" ""Tell it to the judge."" [As if judges didn't have to follow the laws.] They stop to eat. Fries and ketchup? [Not weight conscious.] There seems to be a small army of killers conspiring against this woman. Is there a leak from the inside? Cobra has explosive devices and an H&K MP-5 as part of his toolkit. Cobra gets friendly with the woman.

The gang of killers attacks with guns and petrol bombs. Cobra tosses grenades for explosive effects. They race away in a pick-up. Cobra is the tail gunner. The shooting goes on, they flee to an orange grove and the juice factory. The shooting continues inside the factory. [There is never a shortage of ammunition.] There is a confrontation to provide a dramatic conversation. Then a hand-to-hand fight! [But we know who will win.] There is a fiery death for a villain. ""Let's get out of here."" Can Cobra get his car replaced? ""Its not in the budget."" ""No hard feelings, pal.""

There is a high level of violence and a high body count to distract you from a thin story.

847872,2,6304340486,"First let me say that this film sucks!  I can recall way back when this came out that it was hyped up, released, out of the theaters and then on cable a few months later!  Now anyone from back in the 80's knows that it took a while before films got put on cable - especially the great ones, so for this to be on cable so soon gave me a red flag!

You know, since it's release, I have made serveral attempts to watch this film.  A couple of times on cable upon it's debut and about ten years later on TV.  I guess the turn-offs were every tough guy stereotype in film is in here.  Shades, all black dress, designer gun, does not talk much, is always calm, fearless, brave, works alone, toothpick, self assurance, needs no guns - you name it!  Add to that his 1950's car which was a turn-oof to me because I do not like those cars and what we have here is a film that tries to be cool but fails.

Now, I JUST watched this today!  Yes, it took me this long to watch it.  Every other time I tired, I always left off after the supermarket scene.  I did not know what the film was about up to that point and even after I did not know what it was about.  You have a group of crazed slashers who go around killing and talking about their goals.  Only when you watch it all do you realize what it and they are about!  Thanks to Youtube, we are able to get a better idea of these New World Order sickos and their devilish aims.  Yes, the main antagonist says to Stallone: ""Do you want to go to hell with me?""  He also adds:""We kill the weak so that the strong survive!""  He also said something about the ""new order.""  So without fully explaining the killer's reason for killing, this kind of sums it up.  At the time of it's release, I doubt that anyone would have a clue as to what was going on, many would not today.  ONLY in this context does this film have any cohesiveness to it.

On a story note.  Bridgette Nilsson barley saw the killer and they wanted to remain secret, but they blow their entire cover to kill someone that barely saw them?  They would have been better off not trying to kill her as she could not pinpoint anyone!  So this film is good a pointing out the NWO theme in film yet again.  I am guessing that this sick cult of madness must be real!  President Bush I made it public when he announced a New World Order and Michael Paine (husband of Ruth Paine of JFK assassination lore) also said that he and Lee Harvey Oswald were trying to accomplish a new world order!",1313798400,,2480,4.103950103950104

847969,4,6304340486,"First of all, I'd like to say that while Cobra isn't a masterpiece by any stretch, I don't think it really deserves the backlash that it's gotten ever since its release 25 years prior.  Cobra is one of those movies that doesn't break any new ground or provide anymore insight into the ""dirty cop"" or ""vigilante"" genres pioneered by such movies like Dirty Harry (1971) and Death Wish (1974), but I'd be lying if I told all of you that I didn't enjoy watching this one.  I say that Cobra is Dirty Harry's more aggressive little brother because much like Dirty Harry, it's about a cop who feels the police procedures and the rights of the accused are holding him back from catching the bad guys, but unlike the Clint Eastwood crime-thriller classic, Cobra glorifies the brutal vigilante justice committed against the antagonists of the movie.  I believe casting Andrew Robinson (the Scorpio killer in DH) and Reni Santoni (Chico Gonzales in DH, whose also named Gonzales in Cobra) was deliberate as to draw in the Dirty Harry crowd.

STORY

A cult of serial killers lead by a psycho named the Night Slasher (Brian Thompson) is terrorizing Los Angeles, and when a model named Ingrid (Brigitte Nielsen) witnesses a murder by the Night Slasher's cult, she becomes a target.  However, a specialist cop named Marion ""Cobra"" Cobretti (Sylvester Stallone) and his partner Gonzales are assigned to protect Ingrid and find the Night Slasher.  Cobra is best known for his unorthodox methods in dealing with criminals that would normally break standard police procedure, and has anger problems.

CHARACTERS

To be honest, don't expect much depth out of any of the characters.  However, there is some good characterization for select ones.  Cobra doesn't really have any depth, but he spouts out lots of cheesy yet memorable one-liners like ""Go ahead, I don't shop here"" and ""You're the disease, and I'm the cure"" that'll make any 80's action buff happy (like myself).  Also, Stallone does a good job portraying the vigilante cop with a charmingly one-sided right-wing view on how to deal with crime as he's all muscle and has absolutely no regard for the crooks.  Brian Thompson plays an excellent Night Slasher since he looks and acts like a beast.  I'd normally scorn the fact that his character lacks depth as we really don't know why he leads a cult of murder other than the whole ""kill the weak so only the strong remain"" brute philosophy, but I find the simplicity in this charming because for a simple 80's action thriller like this, it feels perfect that the antagonist is evil just because.  The Night Slasher's followers, especially the one who holds an armed robbery in a grocery store in the beginning, are delightfully over-the-top in their ""evil"" factor.  I personally wish that Gonzales had more screentime because I found his dialogue with Cobra about junkfood entertaining precisely for how hokey it is.  Ingrid is a bucket of cliches since she's an ideal embodiment of the ""damsel in distress"" since she always needs Cobra and Gonzales to protect her and has no depth to her.

ACTION SCENES

Cobra is pretty off-kilter compared to most other blood-soaked 80's action flicks because in the beginning, it feels like it'll be a slasher thriller given the ominous main theme and the shots of the Night Slasher cult clinking axes in a derelict warehouse and the scenes of the Night Slasher slaying his victims in the dark.  However, easily by the halfway point of the movie, it takes a steep turn into action territory when the Night Slasher's gang ambushes Cobra on the road and it ensues into a giant chase scene, and after that, dozens and dozens of the killers storm Cobra's hideout and surprise surprise, Cobra's prepared with a submachine gun (complete with a giant laser scope) and grenades that result in a huge body count.  The action scenes are pretty darn cool because it's just so much fun to see Stallone hiding in a trailer house landing perfect shots against the scum on motorcycles and dishing out rather painful deaths to the cult in the factory.  Some examples of these are when one of the killers walks through a series of flammable pipes, Cobra releases the gas valve, which shoots out flammable gas near open flames and torches the creep.  The other is when Cobra hides behind a barrel of fuel, a rifleman accidentally shoots the barrel and gets soaked in gas, then Cobra drops a lit match on him, which leads to some pretty bright and hot results.  The final confrontation between Cobra and the Night Slasher at the end is one of the most brutal I've seen in a movie like this and like any well-made 80's action flick, is loaded with brutal violence (too good to spoil, you have to see it yourself).

SOUNDTRACK

The soundtrack reeks of the 80's (in a nostalgic, fun way).  It's a mix of 80's synthesizer instrumentals and popular pop rock from the decade.  The pop songs add that mandatory 80's feel to the movie and the synth instrumentals have some diversity.  The main theme is the most memorable as it's a primarily synth-based composition with a wholly dark tone (it somewhat reminds me of some compositions at the hands of Brad Fiedel from the first Terminator movie), but some others have much more of an upbeat feeling to them and would probably fit pretty well in a Sega Genesis-era Sonic the Hedgehog game.

PRODUCT PLACEMENT

The product placement in Cobra is pretty amusing and given the numerous shots of Pepsi signs and Pepsi display items (such as that huge cup with the spinning transparent spiral caramel rod that looks like pouring cola in the grocery story, which I fondly remember seeing in my own youth), I'm having a  really tough time figuring out who placed the most funding for a product plug-in compared to the other products clearly featured in the movie (like RC and Coca Cola).  I don't know why, but the really vintage Toy's R Us Christmas commercial playing on the TV in Cobra's apartment really stuck with me.

FINAL WORD

Cobra isn't a masterpiece, but it isn't a terrible movie, either.  If you're a junkie for simplistic 80's action  and thriller movies with all the cliches you've come to expect with a few original nuances, then this will sit comfortably in your collection.",1294704000,,6233,4.780783582089552

12/06: Marion Cobretti is one of the best characters to ever grace the silver screen.

Can't anything be more exciting than Cobra?

It is one of the most aesthetically made neo-noir pictures. Sylvester Stallone really outdid himself this time by creating one of the coolest characters in movie history through Marion Cobretti, the pride of the Zombie Squad.

The public's hate for Stallone is completely undeserving because he is a great storyteller with a creative imagination. Great writing, action sequences, and style all make Cobra to work.

All in all, Cobra is a neo-noir masterpiece.

2/08: Seeing it for the seventh time in the past six years, Cobra still hasn't failed to entertain me.

It might be the most creative Stallone picture made. It's the neo-noir quality that makes it to look cool and exciting. Without the character development in Marion Cobretti, Cobra would have been just another mindless action flick.

Some of the best parts of the film are: the reading of crime statistics at the very beginning of the film, Monte's enmity for Cobretti, the ultra cool-looking '50 Mercury car, the matchstick, the car chase (which easily rivals the one in Bullitt), the Mercury spinning around to the rear with Stallone using the Jati-Matic on the truck, the distinctive-looking knife, Brian Thompson's comically funny pig speech, Stallone's overlarge sunglasses, and Cobretti's intro for the shopping market incident.

All in all, I don't care how many times I have seen Cobra or the fact that the film is so widely panned by the public; I love Cobra, and it's my kind of a movie.

10/10: There are many great scenes in Cobra that make it one of the best neo-noir movies made.

Many kudos to Sylvester Stallone's unbridled creativity, James Symons and Don Zimmerman's editing, and Ric Waite's cinematography.

All in all, Cobra is a very underrated neo-noir that should be highly respected for its distintive style.",1286409600,,1998,5.03951367781155
847973,4,6304340486,"When Stallone was making ""Cobra"" he was at the top of his game. He was just coming off of making ""Rocky 4"" and ""Rambo: First Blood part 2"". Stallone had great intentions while making ""Cobra"", in fact there was even a sequel planed for the film. The sequel never was made, due to mixed reviews.

""Cobra"" is about Lieutenant Marion 'Cobra' Cobretti, (Stallone) he works on the ""zombie squad"", where he does all the jobs that nobody wants to do. He knows all the bad guys in town.
Cobra is assigned to the case of bringing down the ""night slashers"". While the night slashers are out and about one night, Ingrid, a model (Brigitte Nielsen) was driving home from work and witnesses the night slashers committing a murder.
Now, after seeing the night slashers face, Ingrid is in great danger, so she is put under the protection of Cobra and his partner Sergeant Gonzales.

848082,5,6304340486,"Since it was so overdue we decided to get back to basics and finally tackle the Stallone classic Cobra. Judging from our extensive past of some of the world's greatest B you may be asking why did it take so long for the review on this one? Well it's simple. Cobra is somewhere in that back pocket selection we've created for ourselves. For us it's one of those classics that is very easy to access forcing it to get knocked behind some harder to find B. So the other evening when it appeared on a favorite action channel we decided it was the perfect time to reintroduce ourselves to the man known as Marion Cobretti.

Right from the start it becomes clear this is easily one of Stallone's top 5 most B films as he takes the scene in a local grocery store. The dialogue is something that is almost too hilarious to even comprehend. With lines like ""I don't deal with psychos. I put them away,"" ""go head I don't shop here,"" and ""you're a disease and I'm the cure"" you will be left in a state of pure shock from some of the finest scripted lines in the history of film. Stallone plays Lt. Cobretti ""Cobra"" that's hot on the trail of a new murderous cult wreaking havoc in his city. Once the lunatics take aim at Brigitte Nielsen (whose hot according to Santa) Cobra takes his game to another level in the a** kicking department. He proves that no maniac, cult, or army could do anything except slightly inconvenience him as he brings them time once broken nose at a time.

Cobra has held up so well over time easily earning itself a 5 star ratting. There is so much going on here it's hard to write about it without going on for hours. Honestly the writing is something that is nothing more then mind boggling as the ultra tough one liners pour out with no end until the credits roll. It's a film that truly hard to wrap your head around unless your a very large advocate of the B arts. See for us this film is pure gold and even inspired an interesting thought (without any mind altering substances involved). We started to think how amazing it would be if two iconic Stallone characters in Marion Cobretti and Frank Leonne would join forces in the ultimate criminal take down team.

Cobra is up against a gang of assassins known as the ""New World"", whose major activities are axe-clanging, riding motorbikes and killing random victims (apparently an equal opportunity gang, as there are asians and women among the victims).
The initial supermarket scene is memorable, as we learn that Cobra prefers to ""put away psychos"" (read: shoot multiple times) rather than dealing with them.
More importantly, as the gang sets its sights on hapless Nielsen (a fashion model), Cobra turns into a lean killing machine that despises sociological analysis of crime ie ""tell it to the judge...we put them away and they let them out"".

I really think she should have gotten an Oscar in 1986 for this movie.  Why not?  Judi Dench received an academy award for Shakespeare in Love and she was only in it for five minutes.  Here we have eighty-seven minutes of sheer genius.

Last but not least, I love the Bounty Hunter from the X-Files as the lead villain.  What a wonderful job he did, because he had to really work outside his acting realm to be in this film.  I also loved the Bounty Hunter's minions, all very upset blue-collar workers who wanted to be loved.  So they joined a serial killer cult!!  I love this movie!  I love the Zombie Squad!

848354,4,6304340486,"COBRA blows. Don't ever forget that. However, the movie sucks so badly that it rules! Whether Stalone is battling his enemies or his partner's bad-eating-habits, the action is always present and usually overflowing with corny intensity.

The film starts off with a horrid scene in a grocery market where a crazy-lunatic enters a food store and immediately blows away various fruits and vegetables with his enormous shotgun with precise aim (maybe his parents forced him to eat those as a child). Stalone enters and says more corny things that may make you puke, and that is basically the basis of the entire film. Nothing more happens then that. However, there is one scene in the movie where the ""Hunters of the New World"" clang their axes together in an intimidating way that comes off (to me and my siblings, at least) as incredibly hilarious. We often raise our own arms and pretend to clang our own imaginary axes together during this scene, and it once freaked my old friend out. He never came over to my house again.

The suspense in this film is mediocre like everything else in the movie, but a few scenes are awesome. In particular, I thoroughly enjoy the scene where the main-hacker attempts to murder the supermodel inside the intensive-care ward. That scene puts me in a surprisingly calm and good mood. The end scene in which the main-hacker gets thrown onto a gigantic meat-hook (which, incidentally, becomes penetrated through his stomach entirely) and gets hauled off into the metal-grinder is a truly uplifting moment in the film. If you are queasy about blood, guts, death, occult-like murders, and psychopathic, crazy axe-murderers, then stay away from this film.

848356,3,6304340486,"In the mid-80's, Sylvester Stallone was one of Hollywood's biggest money making actors, and a gauranteed box office draw. He was given a green light by producers to go over the script and make changes the way he saw fit. One of these scripts that Stallone was interested in was called Beverly Hills Cop. The script mixed humor with action; Stallone, however, wasn't keen on comedy so he turned the script into a darker, more action-oriented script. The result was that the producers decided to stick with the original script and give the starring role in Cop to a rising young African American comedian/actor named Eddie Murphy; Stallone, on the other hand, was given the boot. He, however, had finished revising the script, changed the title to Cobra, brought his then wife Brigitte Nielsen to co-star, and filmed it on his own with George Cosmatos, who had directed him in Rambo: First Blood Part 2, as director.

Cobra doesn't come close to Beverly Hills Cop. It was a critical disaster despite doing good business at the box office.

The story is about a cool cop named Marion Cobretti, so much for Axel Foley, who is known as Cobra. He wears jeans and a pair of dark sunglasses, lives in a slum, drives an awesome car, carries a gun with a cobra drawn on it, tosses one-liners around like frisbies, hardly smiles, and chews on a matchstick (how cool is that?!). He is hired to protect a model, played by Nielsen, who witnessed a group of killers commit their grizzly crime.

The films follows Cobra and the model as they escape from the gang to nowhere in particular. And that's where the movie goes: nowhere. In other words, Cobra is plotless. Why are the killers doing what they're doing? To take over the world and start a new order, but why?!

On the other hand, the action sequences are unrealistic (Cobra's car flying out of the second floor of a parking structure and taking off like nothing happened), but they are cool just like the movie's main character.

Not really recommended, unless you love Stallone and 'cool' action movies (together, that is!).

After several dozen murders, Stallone tracks the killers down and blows them all away (except for the one he hangs on a hook and burns to death). The End.

Total Recall showed how extreme violence could be used to produce an imaginative, entertaining film. Cobra shows how extreme violence can be used to produce a multi-million dollar mess that makes you wonder if Darwin was wrong. It's basically a star vehicle slasher film during which victim after hapless victim is paraded in front of the screen to be slaughtered in the name of forwarding the ""plot.""

Slyvester Stallone is Marion Cobretti AKA Cobra (nickname derived from his surname) He is a no nonsence cop that belongs to the Zombie squad unit. He takes no prisoners and can be as violent as the criminals he dispossess of. The movie starts with a gun wielding maniac who raids a store for no particular reason and starts shooting up innocent folks like Duke Nukem. The cops are called but they can't handle the situation and one of them utters the words -call the cobra-, u can't help but start to laugh at this point. Stallone rolls onto the scene looking like he just walked off a Giorgio Armani fashion shoot and does what he does best i.e kill the psycho. But thats just the beginning, theres more madness out there in the shape of a cult led by Brian Thompson who wants to establish a new world order. Their motto -we kill the weak so the strong survive- is evident as they mainly target women and only operate after sunset. They are extremely violent and use a variety of axes,chains,spikes and vicious looking knives to kill their prey. Brigitte Nielsen a model almost falls victim but escapes and calls the cops, who assign cobra to the case which includes protecting her as she is a valuable witness who recognizes Thompson aka -the night slasher-. A female member of the cult also works for the zombie squad and keeps the gang one step ahead of the impending investigations. This fact makes Cobra's job difficult as Brigitte is moved from place to place, the gang seem to follow as we witness extreme violent killings. This takes us to the very end when cobra delivers his own form of justice to Thompson in a violent scene where he ends up being impaled on a giant hook and is transported into a blast furnace as he yelps in pain like a baby. Other violent scenes include an innocent female being axed to pieces and a man gets rammed against a wall by a van at very high speed. This movie has some funny moments too but as a whole now seems a bit outdated. Its an o.k flick and should not be taken seriously. I give it 3 stars.",1126828800,,2077,4.411458333333333

And,quite obviously the screenplay sucked..I own this on dvd because i love fun movies and this is one of those...People,This is not ben-hur or Citizen Kane.....just a fun,stupid movie.
The dialogue that deals with society is pretty good...but it barely scratches the surface of things. This was a vehicle for ""Brigitte Neilsen""  who is not a very good actress in my opinion. The love scene is absolutely horrendus(How could she fall for a guy who deliberately puts her in danger?)
Not bad picture on the dvd in component video,but the sound is awful even with 2 sub-woofers.
A laughable commentary track by George P. Cosmatos..Very slow and he seems to get real bored all of a sudden so decides to tell us that he likes pepsi and gummi bears....Now,he's a good director but this was a poor job and he knows it.
But for guys and girls who like fun movies...go ahead and buy it,you'll like it.

Stallone demonstrates quite admirably why action movie stars should not write their own screenplays.  From the ""maverick in the police department"" to the ""female lead who falls in love with a guy who continually and recklessly endangers her life"" to the ""treacherous partner cop-gone-bad"" to the ""one man vs. an army"" of the climactic shootout, the plot might interest a sleeping zombie.  Maybe that's his target audience, as the brutal senselessness of the movie could only escape the undead.  Although even zombies will get a little nauseated at the retro-80s soundtrack.

848684,1,6304340486,"Cobra (1986)
Cobra is a God awful movie that really sets the standard for lousy action films.
The story is strange and goes absolutely  nowhere. Some killer called ""The NightSlasher"" kills multiple  people with a very sharp and lethal knife. Marion Cobretti (Sylvester  Stallone) is also known as ""Cobra"",and sets out to destroy the  ""NightSlasher"".
This film is sooo bad it's kind of hard to  describe. The  screenplay (written by Stallone) is horrible,and has tons of  plot holes and has unbelieveably stupid dialog. The story goes absolutely  nowhere. The characters are terribly developed and are strictly zero  dimensional. And Brigette Nielson is a horrid actress.
Beyond that,Cobra  is filled with an incredibly cheesy and  irritating 80s  soundtracks. Director George Pan Cosmatos has to be the most serious problem  with the film. He doesn't know where he wants the film to go,and his  direction is just soooo  weak,it makes the film predictable,slow,and  boring.
Cosmatos gave us some really good films over the years (Rambo 2,  Leviathan,etc),but this is probably his worst film.
Cobra is also very  boring due to the slow-paced plot and Cosmatos' incredibly weak  direction. The action scenes are also very stupid and brainless. Such as when  Cobra nukes two axe- wielding killers at his home and his boss and fellow  cops say he still doesn't have proof that the killings are being done by  more than one person. Cobra's sunglasses are also horrible  looking.
Overall,Cobra could've been a good movie. It could've been a  Stallone favorite. It has VERY few redeeming qualties. Brian Thompson is  excellent as the ""NightSlasher"",the finale is pretty intense,and  the beginning is superb. Still,that can't  save this dreck.
It's easy to  see why Cobra 2 was never planned. This movie stunk up the house real bad!",966211200,,1823,5.1506849315068495
848714,1,6304340486,"I reviewed this film quite a some time ago and gave it 2 stars out of 5  (which means seriously flawed and is only recommended for hardcore fans of  the genre. Otherwise,steer clear).However,after viewing this DVD,this movie  is worse than I originally thought. A while ago,me and my friend Ted went to  BlockBuster to rent some DVD's. Ted owns a DVD player,so I went to his  house. The DVD's we rented were Small Soldiers,Friday The 13th, Phantasm and  this. Ted absolutely loves this movie, so just to be nice,I watched it with  him. However, he didn't enjoy it very much because the DVD had some VERY  irritating problems. The picture quality is horrible. Some scenes are  difficult to see coz the picture has a dark tint to it. The sound is bad. On  the DVD we rented,the actors voices were hard to hear has some of the  gunfire and sound  F/X.There was also a hiss that would interrupt  every  once in a while. It wasn't loud or constant but still. The extras are fairly  decent,but the director's commentary isn't a commentary at all.  George Pan  Cosmatos is silent throughout the entire film and doesn't speak once about  it. Overall,I'd recommend you avoid this. If you must see this dull  flick,rent the VHS tape.

But he goes for it anyway, giving us this  terrible motion-picture, whre there's a gang of killers who wants a new  order for something..A mere vehicle for actres Brigitte Nielses, I guess..",957830400,,358,4.852459016393443
848716,3,6304340486,"I remember when Cobra first came out there were posters for it all over the place. I was mesmerized by the simplicity and suggestive nature of them. Stallone, against a red background, chewing a match, with his custom-made pistol tucked under his belt. I'd never seen anyone chew a matchstick before, I'd never seen a laser-targeting machine gun, and the idea of a cop associating himself with an animal was intriguing.

In 1988 I rented the VHS tape from the local store. It was one of those old, massive, clamshell cases with the old Warner logo on the side. That night, at the age of 7, I was left alone for a few hours and the movie was merely to keep me amused and out of trouble. It didn't so much amuse me as it did terrify me. For any action-junkie kid born in the 80s the words 'Night Slasher' will be forever carved into your consciousness. This guy, to me, at that age, was the ultimate villain, and pushed the movie out of the action genre and into horror. I developed a fear of strange men driving around in unassuming vans, which I still have. Brian Thompson (who was only 26 at the time) is utterly bone-chilling in the role. You might recognize in a less terrifying role as the punk who challenges the naked T-800 with 'Nice night for a walk, eh?' in the first Terminator.

Marion Cobretti (Stallone in another bigger-than-life role) is part of the 'zombie squad', a group of LAPD cops who are the absolute bottom line and will do the jobs that no one else wants. The movie opens with some random psycho holding hostages in a supermarket. 'Call the Cobra' the normal, useless cops say. Cobra arrives in his muscle car and calmly enters the store, sipping some free beer and taunting the psycho before obliterating him, much to the distaste of the wimpy, bleeding-heart liberal media circus who have invaded the scene.

Cobra believes that the supermarket psycho is part of a bigger gang, an axe-clanking cult in which members from every facet of society gather in a sewer to clank axes over their heads. Their leader is the Night Slasher, a man who's head is 95% cheekbone and 5% staring, staring, staring eyes. He believes in creating a New World, not the Aldous Huxley kind but the kind which can be achieved, somehow, by murdering random blondes. His latest target is Ingrid (Brigitte Nielsen in a so very not Oscar-winning role), a model who towers over Cobra by a full 4 inches, but she needs his protection and he needs to keep her alive as a witness. Not taking too kindly to having people being able to identify him the Night Slasher rounds up all of his fellow psychos and unleashes World War 3 on California, thus creating thousands more witness in the process, but logic is not this film's strong point.

After finding success with Rocky and Rambo, Stallone was clearing trying to create his own spin on Dirty Harry here (the Dirty Harry villain Scorpio even features here as an unhelpful Detective constantly berating Cobra). There is a strong right-wing theme of fighting fire with fire, and that with psychos as utterly demented as the Night Slasher you need someone just as unsympathetic and daring on the right side of the law to combat him. It's so far-fetched, and filled with dozens of logical and physical impossibilities that it makes Commando look like a freakin' documentary. But while Commando was cheerful, upbeat and self-aware, Cobra is deadly, deadly serious and believes itself to be making a serious point of how close society can come to complete anarchy if the Police were not there to keep the psychos off the streets.

This would be a fine message for an action picture, but there is a air of sleaziness to the production that spoils it. Many scenes are set in oppressive environments such as parking lots or concrete underpasses which give it a cold, alienating feel more like early James Glickenhaus or Joseph Zito films.
Cobra is also produced by the notorious Menahem Golan and Yoram Globus, and directed, mostly, like a pop music video by George Pan Cosmatos. There are lots of quick cuts and fish-eye lens shots. Cosmatos overdoes it with these gimmicks in a few scenes. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. If there was a little more elegance to the production then perhaps the critics might not have been so merciless and it might have aged a bit better too. I realize that this not a Kenneth Branagh film, but it's still too mainstream to be outright exploitation and too sleazy to deliver the conservative message it so desperately wants us to believe in.

These days few movies are as straight-up and to-the-point as Cobra. The one-man army theme was the 80s zeitgeist. Before John McClane came along and made the vulnerable hero fashionable audiences preferred the bulletproof, genuine, straight-up tough guy. Cobra has endured a lasting cult following thanks to its undeniable 80s mentality. A film like this would be very, very quickly forgotten in modern times. If you want 87 minutes of entertainment it works, if you want to look beneath the surface at a possibly deeper message, Cobra almost, just barely has one.

It's insane to think that this film is basically Stallone's Beverly Hills Cop. When he was attached to star as Axel Foley he wanted to make the film more action-orientated. Paramount didn't want to spend so much money on the project so he left, and took his ideas with him. Those ideas were turned into Cobra, despite an onscreen credit for 'Based on the novel Fair Game, by Paula Gosling', a novel it bears little resemblance to, which was later turned into its own movie in 1995 (starring Steven Berkoff as the villain, who was also the villain in Beverly Hills Cop and Rambo 2) which is absolutely nothing like Beverly Hills Cop or Cobra. And on top of all that a poster for Cobra can be seen in Beverly Hills Cop 2, which stars Brigitte Nielsen.

Try getting your head around that.

The Blu Ray presents the film in a reasonable 1.78:1 1080p transfer. There aren't many high-key shots in the film to take full advantage of HD, but it's certainly a considerably upgrade from the shoddy DVD. The sound is in DTS HD-MA and there are a tiny amount of extras. A shame, as I'd really like to hear what Stallone thinks of this film these days.",956620800,,6228,4.664845173041894
