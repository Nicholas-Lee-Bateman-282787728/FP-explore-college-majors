part of the world that most Americans are pretty ignorant about.  The sense of
humor evident in the DVD was refreshing.",1476921600,,203,4.638888888888889

8585000,1,B00CQARYRY,"I was really looking forward to this DVD, having spent some time in the South Pacific and wanted to revisit some memories.

Instead, I got a couple of hours of some hipster dork making a fool of himself in front of islanders.  It's the kind of behavior that gives tourists a bad rep, including making what I felt were inappropriate comments about Tahitian women.  There isn't much about the scenery.  Heck he goes to Tahiti and instead of enjoying the lagoons or making a trip to Bora Bora or Moorea, he eats Chinese food from food trucks and loses in a canoe race.

He obviously hates Christianity because he keeps emphasizing how these islands managed to ""save"" themselves from Westernization, yet we see plenty of electricity and cars, which I'd say the islanders appreciate and make tourism more feasible.  I have no love for the cruel criminal acts against islanders that many missionaries were guilty of, but I do not think it's fair to judge an entire religion on the acts of a few.  He fails to mention the good that missionaries did, like eliminate cannibalism.

I've found the Pacific islands to have a beautiful mix of traditional and Christian religious beliefs that is open and welcoming to all, not the hatred this idiot seems so intent on finding.  In fact, one of the mutineers from the HMS Bounty became a devout Christian on Pitcairn Island, leaving a legacy of deeply religious residents.  So Mr. Toolbag visits a church and seems to delight in trolling a church member who is clearly saddened that few island residents still attend church.

Mr. Toolbag also seems to have a deep admiration for the mutineers of the HMS Bounty, so deep that he fulfills a lifetime dream of swimming near the ruins of the burned and sunk ship.  I'm guessing he also plans to do cartwheels at Benedict Arnold's childhood home or something.  He again makes what I felt were offensive comments about South Pacific women.

Waste of time.  Save your money, invest it, and visit the islands for yourself.  I'm glad I did.  Next time I want to revisit memories, I'll look through my photos.",1381795200,2,2084,4.712707182320442
8585001,5,B00CQARYRY,"I have always been curious about the south pacific islands.  This dvd covers a pleasant young man traveling to Easter Island,Tahiti, Mangareva and Pitcairn Islands.  We learn about the history, the natives, how the inhabitants presently live.  The scenery is gorgeous.  Part two is the continuing journeys of the same man, as he visits Tonga, Fiji, Norfolk island and New Caledonia.  There are lovely unspoiled places on this planet.  Good educational video.  I hope these places remain undeveloped and unspoiled.  For a unique vacation, visit, buy soveniers, take pictures, then leave it as you found it.  Delightful dvd.",1375920000,3,622,5.26530612244898
