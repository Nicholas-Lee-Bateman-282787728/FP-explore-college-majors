7980153,4,B00008976G,"Yusuke Urameshi is a high school delinquent. He doesn't go to class, and he's always getting in fights. One day he is trying to save a boy that is about to be hit by a car, he is killed instead. He is approached by a pretty girl flying on a broom. Her name is Botan, and she's the Grimm Reaper. She offers him a chance to regain his life. After coming back to life Yusuke becomes a Spirit Detective. He gain spiritual powers and hunts down rogue apparitions that cause trouble for the living world. He is joined by his friend Kuwabara, the demons Hiei and Kurama. Together they fight off the deadly demons that seek to destroy the world.

Round 3 finds team Urameshi fighting the demon world ninjas. The powers that be have also rendered Hiei and Genkai useless in this fight. That only leaves Yusuke, Kuwabara, and Kurama able to fight the dreaded team Masho.

This is  a great series. It has lots of cool characters, good animation, voice acting, and a very engrossing story. It's a very long anime, so if you want to watch it be prepared to like it and spend a long time with it. It's one of those that gets more interesting as it progresses. Even though it has a bang up start it maintains the flow throughout. I would even go so far as to say that it's one of the most famous anime series' of all time. It has a bit of a Dragonball Z vibe to it, and everyone likes that. I highly recommend Yu Yu Hakusho to every anime fan, it's simply amazing.",1353110400,,1449,4.261818181818182
7980154,5,B00008976G,"I really liked this one! Kurama has to fight two guys in a row to help the the team get through this round. First, he goes up against a guy who uses paint as a weapon! Then, he has to fight another who can use ice! Then Yusuke gets mad when the third guy tries to kill Kurama. I thought it a neat display of friendship.",1121731200,,319,3.8484848484848486
7980155,5,B00008976G,"Yu Yu Hakusho: Vol. 11: Fairplay: is a great DVD.  Even though it only has three episodes, this is a far better DVD than some of the other Dark Tournament DVDs.  Kurama is the central character here.  Many fangirls are in love with this mysterious, flower-controlling, red-haired bishie demon.  But there is plenty of compelling battle as well, as two compelling opponents of Team Yurameshi are introduced: Touya the Ice Master and Jin the Wind Master.

Vol. 11 contains episodes 37 - 39.

Episode 37: Master of Disguise - A very sexy and scantily-clad female ""nurse"" demon named Ruka traps the Masked Fighter and Hie in the ""medical tent.""  Helpless, they watch as Kurama squares off against Gama, the makeup-brandishing Shinobi.  Before battle Gama explains that the original use of makeup has been forgotten and corrupted.  Kurama soon finds himself in a fight for his life.

Episode 38: Kurama's Stand - Still bound by Gama's body-paint spells, Kurama takes on the next member of the Team Masho, the Ice Demon Touya.  Stalling for time, Kurama asks Touya why the Shinobi have come out of hiding.  Touya says that they have been promised the island if they win.  Kurama suspects there is much more to the Shinobi's plans for the island.

Episode 39: Crushing Revenge - In a coma, Kurama is rescued from certain death in the ring by an enraged Yusuke.  It is moving and powerful to see the lengths Yusuke will go to save his friend, and also how much the seemingly impassive Hie cares for Kurama. Yusuke then takes on two members of Team Masho, including the whimsical pointy-eared Jin.

Extras in this DVD include action figure Hie, translations of kanji, character profiles, and attack profiles.",1121644800,,1699,4.847222222222222
7980156,5,B00008976G,"I love Kurama and two Shinobis (Touya & Jin) that are introduced in this Dvd. This DVD is a must for any fan of YYH or fangirl of any of the three characters I named.

Only Yusuke, Kurama, and Kuwabara (still wounded) are able to fight after Hiei and Genkai are trapped in a forcefield. Kurama desides he will fight first winning as many matches as possible. The fights are as follows: Kurama vs Gama; Kurama vs Touya; Kurama vs Baken; Yusuke vs Baken. Some good old fasion bloody, butt kicking going on in this DVD. Poor Kurama almost dies. Gama gets cut into lunch meat, Touya gets stabbed with a death plant (lovely). This is definetly one of my favorites.",1093478400,2,659,4.446280991735537
7980157,5,B00008976G,"If you are half way familiar with the series all I can say is that it's good.  It's only got three episodes but the series being what it is in a hybrid format with DVD transfer:  you can't ask for too much more.
