8075982,2,B000A7X7OY,"The music is solid.  This was a time when the band boasted an all-star jazz  component.  The video leaves a lot to be desired.  This was obviously dubbed directly from original videotape footage with no effort to clean it up.  Color correction, perhaps conversion to 24-frame effect, some black and white segments to cover the disastrous video reds, would help immensely.  I, personally, would have cleaned this up considerably before releasing it.

My advice; listen to the music and ignore the video.",1405900800,4,502,5.048780487804878

and well orchestrated throughout.
