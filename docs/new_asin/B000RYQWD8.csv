8203156,5,B000RYQWD8,I learned of this book at a glass trade show. I find it amazing. He shows how to create amazing artwork with only small pieces of ground up glass. He shows how to layer colors to get better control on the colors etc. He seems to have almost invented this way of working. Recommend it to any glass worker interested in going in this direction!,1399593600,,342,4.276923076923077
8203157,5,B000RYQWD8,I enjoyed Michael Dupille style of teaching on this video and he went thru every step so you could work and follow along. I will be able to do better firt work now. Thanks,1378512000,,171,4.0588235294117645
8203158,5,B000RYQWD8,Lots of details in the demonstration.  It was a pleasure to watch each step in the development of a beautiful picture. This is a long video but certainly kept my interest.,1378339200,,171,4.516129032258065
8203159,4,B000RYQWD8,The video is very informative.  I think it covers all the basics of painting with frit.  The only negative is that the pace is kind of slow.,1368576000,,140,4.148148148148148
8203160,5,B000RYQWD8,"Michael demonstrates his Fritography method in clear steps. It was just like going to a class and learning this art form. I loved it!

8203161,4,B000RYQWD8,Very Good video.  Michael does go through the fritography process step-by-step.  If it is what you want or are interesting in starting this is the video fro you.  AAA+++,1266624000,4,169,4.758620689655173
8203162,5,B000RYQWD8,"As far as I can tell, Michael Dupille invented fritography: the process of ""painting"" onto glass using glass frit (the powdered or crushed form of stained glass) and a glass kiln. His method includes doing multiple firings to create layers of images, just as a traditional painter paints the background before she adds in the foreground items.

It is beautiful, unique -- and a new way to explore glass art.

In this video, Dupille walks you through the entire process of creating fritography. Nothing is arm-waved (""I finished the background to save time""); you see every step. By creating a glass image of a geisha (with only two firings, but you get the sense of how much more could be accomplished), he makes fritography understandable. He also makes it fun; this guy has a sense of humor and really lets it show.

My only complaint is that the video could have used more close-ups, particularly on the final piece. I also would have liked to see the final piece (even as a still image) before the process began, so that I knew where I was headed. Also, I wish he spent more time at the end, showing his gallery of what could be accomplished, because it's gorgeous work.

Nonetheless, we got enough from the video instruction to make us willing to try a few projects, with modest to excellent success. This DVD really gave us a great introduction, and I'd recommend it to anyone.

Well, not quite anyone. This shouldn't be the first thing you watch if you're brand-new to fusing. Dupille does assume that you're familiar with your glass kiln and basic fusing techniques. So get that knowledge under your belt, first.",1204588800,21,1620,4.710247349823321
