I am only giving it one star because it took a week and a half for me to get it and once I got it, parts of the dvd case was broken and the dvd would not play in any of my dvd players. The reason why it wouldn't play was because the regional code was a two therefore not compatable with the code one for the United States dvd players all of which did not state in the product description.",1362873600,5,426,3.852272727272727

5457739,4,B00AMZFFQ2,"This show is obviously scripted or staged. However, it is fun to watch while on the treadmill. I never watched the Kardashians on TV. I started with seasons 1-4 on a streaming service. It is interesting to see the changes over the seasons.",1396656000,,239,4.5813953488372094

8554417,4,B00AMZFFQ2,"I like the Kardashians. Even with all the drudgery, arguments and conceitedness, they are a family. They teach us that no matter what life throws at you, family always comes first.

8554420,1,B00AMZFFQ2,"Of course I watch this show, much to my own dismay.  I wish Amazon did not carry this show, though, because it is such a nasty habit to pick up I do not want people to traffic it to others. What's next, Amazon? Selling crack?  Selling video footage of puppydog-slaughter?  Help me break my cringeworthy habit by no longer trafficking trash through your otherwise good name.  Dump this sewage back into the gutter from whence it came, and instead offer more foreign television shows.  Sure, many of those shows will not be entirely understandable by many of your users - but then again, neither is The Kardashians.",1468540800,,613,4.691588785046729
