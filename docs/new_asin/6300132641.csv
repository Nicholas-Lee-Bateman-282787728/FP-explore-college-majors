210443,5,6300132641,"People say kids shouldn't watch this film, but I saw it when I was seven. I did not understand everything, but enough for it to have a great impact on me. Partly because of this film I am an animal rights advocate. I think it is very well done. I loved the dogs esp. Snitter, but I wanted to cry everytime I looked at his head; not because it scared me (if you see the movie you will know what i mean), but because it hurt me to see an animal go through that. I think that kids could watch this and maybe it will help teach them compassion, but parents should definitely watch it first and decide whether it is something their kids can handle.",1086825600,13,643,4.111111111111111
210444,5,6300132641,"An original story by author Sir Richard Adams (Watership down, The Plague Dogs, Shardik, and The Girl In A Swing) has been turned into an amazing animated film by director Sir Martin Rosen. (Watership Down, The Plague Dogs, and Stacking)  This film shows the horrors of vivisection and other repulsive things humans have done to animals in the name of 'science'.  I must admit this is NOT a film for the younger veiwers or the light of heart. I know I cry no matter how many times I see this film.  Whether it be the cruel fate of The Tod or the dramatic ending of the film, I will always cry.  And yet this is my favorite movie of all time.  A must for fans of Sir Richard Adams or Sir Martin Rosen or even just for people who want to cry.  I usually watch it every Friday or Saturday night that's how good it is.",1050278400,10,814,4.185897435897436
210445,5,6300132641,"Very heartbreaking story, but gets the point across about the unecessary cruelty of animal experimentation. Though this is an animated film, it is not something you should allow a young child to watch since it is a real tear-jerker and has some graphic scenes of animal cruelty. The story is told very well, and you really become attached to the characters, especially if you are a dog owner. I would like to see a live-action, ""Babe""-type version of this story made.",1045094400,5,467,4.777777777777778

210447,1,6300132641,"When I first heard of the vidio version of the terrific Plague Dogs story I couldn't wait to see it. Having recently read the book I was very disappointed by the drastic changes made in the vidio. Snitter and Rowf are cartoonish shells of the serious characters they were in the book. The 'plague' is just a ploy used by the Institute to prevent people from having sympathy for the escapees, a point lost in the movie. The ending is particularly distressing as there is no closure leaving you with that empty cheated feeling. Better just read the book!",1005091200,6,552,4.585858585858586

210500,5,6300132641,"Just have to say that this is hands down, the saddest movie I have ever seen, animated and live action included.  I don't like to start this review like this, but I can't help it.  Have heard about this movie for years but for some reason never got around to watching it. As gripping and powerful as Watership Down was, this one is even more intense. Richard Adams, the author of both books, definitely has a soft spot for animals and tells their side of the story with humans taking a back seat. Grew up with WSD, seen that movie countless times as a kid and adult and read the book. Only saw Plague Dogs once and can't stop thinking about it. The movie has had a few releases on vhs and dvd but it is long out of print. Although it can be watched via streaming. Now I have to read the book as well. The movie starts out with the 2 main characters(dogs) being tortured in an animal testing facilty. Also, they are not the only animals being tortured as you will notice in watching the 1st few minutes of this movie. Be warned, those images will stick with you, Very disturbing to say the least. I will give the briefest of summaries as I do not want to spoil it for others. All I will say is that you will be cheering for all the animals in this movie and be despising the humans. In the end, you should be moved in some way or another. Very graphic and violent, not recommended for kids. Parents, up to you to let them, but be ready to explain things once the credits roll.  I can't get my wife to watch it with me due to her extreme sensitivity to animals. She can't even watch those ASCAP commercials with Sary Mclachlan singing that sappy song.",1468886400,,1649,4.228571428571429

210503,4,6300132641,A seriously deep animated move based off the book.  What these dogs went through was serious and emotional. The ending ends at a cliffhanger...making you wonder what happened.  Good thing is that the book actually gave the dogs a happy ending.,1466899200,,243,4.902439024390244
210504,5,6300132641,"**Make SURE to buy the Region 2 version of this movie if you want the uncut version. I previously owned just the Region 1 version, which is missing several minutes. If you do not have a player capable of playing a Region 2 DVD you can use your computer to play it. The Region 2 DVD also includes the cut version so you get both!**

This movie, like Watership Down, is not a children's show. It's the dark adventure of two dogs who escape a research laboratory where they have been used for experimentation to further human knowledge. Punches are not pulled, dead and mutilated animals are seen on screen, a man is shot in the face and another found eaten, and the very opening scene of the movie is one of torture. It's best not to watch this movie if these things are subjects make you uncomfortable. I would say that this movie is much more intense than Watership Down.

It's pretty rare to find a Western animated movie that is not aimed at children and is not a comedy, so personally I love this movie. I was ecstatic to finally find the uncut version. I don't know why they chose to cut what they did because it makes some parts of the movie not make sense (things mentioned in one scene have no relevance because the other related scene was cut), and some music is switched around which leads to a totally different tone in some parts.

I have rated this five stars because I find this movie very engaging and emotional every time I watch it. I love the animation style and the story being told. I think it's a great film and I would recommend it to others who enjoy serious animated movies. The DVD could be better by the addition of any bonus features, and I still have a hope in my heart that Criterion will pick this up like they with did Watership Down.",1466812800,4,1764,4.33939393939394

210536,4,6300132641,"I read the book so I am going to be writing a lot of comparisons to the book vs. the movie, in case anyone is curious. Overall, the movie itself, I think, gets 5 stars. The animation is wonderful and the sound quality is spectacular. However, much is missing from the book, which is to be expected from a movie.

-First off, the human perspectives in the book are not accounted for in the movie, aside from some narration we can hear in the background as the dogs are walking. We don't get in depth views of Dr. Boycott, Mr. Powell, Tyson, etc.
-The character of Digby Driver does not exist. Instead, he is replaced by a very minor character, Lynn Driver.
-The Tod's death is not a gruesome in the movie, which is a good thing.
-The movie omitted the scene where Snitter comes across the lone female dog and her owner that died in the ditch.
-The movie also omits any part that was written in special editions of the book; how Snitter's master is actually hospitalized and comes to the rescue of the dogs along with Digby Driver.
-Snitter's master's sister is not in the movie.
-Snitter's never mentions mice running around in his head like he does in the book.
-Rowf's character is not as violent or aggressive like he is in the book. However, the character of Snitter stayed true to the book.

So there you have it, some differences that I noticed while watching the movie. If you are a person who has read the book only, read the movie! Even though it misses many parts, it's still a great watch. And, on the opposite side, if you have only seen the movie, give the book a try! It's more gruesome, in my opinion, than the movie was, and there are a lot of descriptive scenes and scenes in the humans' perspectives. Either way, both the book and the movie do deserve respect...I think this book was better than Watership Down, and should be more famous. Not a lot of people think about cruelty to animals, animal testing, and vivisection, and hopefully this movie/book will make people think of animals more.",1455580800,4,2010,4.474114441416893
210537,4,6300132641,This animated adaptation of the book by British author Richard Adams is as depressing as expected.

210562,5,6300132641,"This is a unique animated film, it is authentic in its message and in its execution.  Here the point of view of a few animal characters is presented, amidst a drama that involves humans.  Animals and humans develop a drama, and it is impossible to deny the legitimacy of the struggle.  The animal struggle is natural and legitimate, with no ulterior motives or agendas, unselfish, and a sharp contrast is inevitably discerned with the human side of things.  One has to wonder, if man is also an animal, albeit one with an ego, does that give him the right to sacrifice these younger brothers in fauna?",1447200000,,601,4.6415094339622645

The horror and sadness of these two dogs lives as portrayed in the movie made it very difficult to watch.  I tried to read the book as a kid but couldn't get through it.  Watership down was much more uplifting compared to this.  This is one of the few movies that made me cry, especially at the end, due to the ambiguous ending.

210625,4,6300132641,It's a very sad story about two dogs escaping from a research lab. The happy ending in the movie and book was removed to make more of a impact. The movie starts out with the lab mix Ruff being allowed to drown after his swimming gives out. He is being watched by a group of white coats. This movie is not for young children or sensitive adults. It seems to end tragically and leaves you wondering if Snitter and Ruff survived. They thought the dogs had a dangerous bubonic plague from the lab and would had shot them. It was  a fight for survival. It's a very good story and also an outrage to the treatment of lab animals. The story novel is great but not for the faint of heart. This story should be for the very mature only and not for family.,1435968000,5,746,4.180555555555555

This is not an uplifting film and if you are squeamish about the thought of dogs being used for animal testing purposes, ""not an uplifting film"" is an understatement.  Though it's animated, I think most children these days would be bored by it. I would give it 2 stars but the story this movie carries is so strong and emotional, it eclipses the quality of the production. From the moment the dogs escape the lab, your longing to find out how these dogs make it to the end of the movie is the captivating motivation.

210777,5,6300132641,"This was a profoundly powerful and emotionally evocative movie. Without knowing the original author of the story was the same who wrote Watership Down, I found my mind wandering to that book as something that stirred me in the same way, so I was not surprised to find the connection!

Like Watership Down, this story is about a lot more than the main plot of the animals, which in this case is dogs escaping from a lab. I interpreted the two dogs as mental patients, perhaps damaged to the point of being institutionalized or at the very least medicated, whose trauma and symptoms threatened those around them. Their escape from their containment and attempts to find their own freedom were met with coldness and a complete lack of empathy. They were isolated and misunderstood in every way by those they interacted with, all while being confused in their own minds about what was real and how to survive on their own. I think this movie really speaks to the stigma associated with mental illness, which would have been even stronger in the time the story was originally written.",1417737600,,1079,4.73936170212766

Children are raised in a horrible experimental lab, public schooling and the sick and twisted family system. A rare few dare escape with their inner richness intact. In their awkwardness and unfamiliarity with the reality of society, the rebels desperately make mistakes....trying to find some sort of home for themselves in the harshness that surrounds them. Tod represents the false self that does all it can to protect the survivors from the realities of society. There is nothing but hunger, desolation, coldness, and hunger for the rebels to try and weather. The ominous hunter, Shame, tracks them but ultimately cannot kill the rebels because of the efforts of the false self. This only leads to an escalation on the side of the hunters. The last resort for the rebels is to leave the false self behind, whom sacrifices himself, and enter into the depths of the ocean of emotion where their ultimate salvation resides...so long as they don't drown in it.",1417651200,,1077,4.890710382513661

210781,5,6300132641,"I have not seen this DVD version. I saw the original film when it came to a local indie film/foreign theater back (The Music Box in Chicago), back in 1983. If there are missing scenes in this DVD version, that is a shame. The original was extremely powerful. I also have not read the original novel (the only Adams novel I've read is Watership Down). This is a review of The Plague Dogs as a film only.

If you're a science-geek and simultaneously an animal lover like me, the animated film The Plague Dogs will rip you out of your complacent cognitive dissonance and shove the plight of experimental animals in your face.

This is mostly because their story is told in an extremely subjective manner; the plight of experimental animals is portrayed from their point of view; you are immersed in their experience. It is harrowing at points and the original ending is wrenching.

This is one of those cases where fiction illuminates and elucidates very difficult, disturbing truths and questions far more effectively than any dry recitation of facts or propagandizing ever could.

Obviously, they're somewhat anthropomorphized animal characters (they talk). The plot is not entirely predictable, but you can tell 1/2 to 2/3 of the way through that it likely won't end well. You could say the execution is emotionally manipulative as any Spielberg or Disney film, yet it is hard to imagine it *not* being that way, given the story being told. The Plague Dogs is like a Disney movie as reflected in a black mirror: the negative inverse of every happy ending, animated Disney animal movie you have ever seen.

I sobbed at the end of this movie and I could not stop sobbing for a couple of hours. I think my boyfriend (who brought me to it) thought it broke me mentally because I couldn't stop crying. It is that upsetting. If you at all have a heart for animals and have animals in your life, it is almost unbearable to watch the last twenty minutes of it.

Yet this is a movie I think EVERYONE should see (adults and teens only -- definitely not children). Maybe every human being in the industrialized world should be strapped into a chair, eyes held open like Alex's in Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange, and forced to watch The Plague Dogs -- if for no other reason than to see the price that other species have paid for humans to have conquered diseases that used to kill humans by the thousands, if not millions, just a few hundred years ago. There is a price to this progress. Epidemiologically speaking, we consider it a success -- for humans. But it isn't success from the perspective of the species used to achieve it; speaking plainly, it's more like species holocaust.

We humans have reasons for all that we do to eradicate diseases and disorders. But are they good enough? Can they erase the tide of deaths -- animal genocides -- that eclipses that of every human ever killed in every war, in every human genocide and holocaust committed? Is all of that excusable simply because the deaths are those of ""animals,"" not humans, and they were for ""the greater good""? Whose good? The planet's? Other species? Or only our selfish species'? What other species kills as many of its own kind as well as the sheer volume of other species, as humans do--and doesn't that prove how bankrupt our hollow claims to superiority over animals actually are? To whom will we answer for all of this, in the next life or the beyond when we die, whether we were a direct participant or merely a passive bystander and recipient of said ""greater good""?

These are some of the questions that The Plague Dogs made me ask myself.

I still don't have the answers.

In some respects, it might even have been worse for me because at the time I saw this movie, I worked upstairs and down the hall from a toxicology lab at a university. I never saw the dogs in the lab, but I sometimes heard them barking. And while I was in junior high and high school, my mother worked in a neuropsych lab with mice and hooded rats. I used to help her feed them and take care of them on the weekends in the lab. (I wasn't supposed to play with them or pet them -- just feed them -- but sometimes I couldn't resist. They were so cute and friendly and curious when I fed them, especially the mice with their almost prehensile little tails that would curl around your finger. And they were used to being handled by humans when they were put in mazes. I've always wondered if my playing with them occasionally screwed up some experiments. Sigh, I was too much of an animal lover as a teen to refrain from petting them.)

I knew that later the mice and rats were (painlessly, with ether, I believe) killed and their brains were sliced into frozen sections for studies. But it was easy to forget that when they were crawling up my sleeves from their little cages when I opened them to give them food, so alive and inquisitive.

It was not at all easy to forget when I saw The Plague Dogs. All of that came back to me, with a much larger, more inclusive perspective that put the human role in all of it in a much more dubious light.

My background may give some explanation for why The Plague Dogs was so hard for me to bear, so I include it here:

I have been, my entire life long, a huge animal lover. I was the only kid in my family of 5 who *wasn't* allergic to cats and dogs and horses, but since 4/5 of us were -- and so was my dad -- we could never have cats or dogs. Yet I had fish, birds, hamsters, even a crayfish I captured at the lakeshore and kept for a summer before returning him to his natural habitat over Labor Day weekend -- and an anole.

As a child, I was always finding and saving baby birds that couldn't fly. Once I rescued a baby cardinal and we took it to a wildlife rehabilitation sanctuary, where they hand fed it until it matured, then rehabilitated it for introduction to the wild. And I was always rescuing stray cats, dogs, kittens, puppies, even though I knew we couldn't keep them. (Now that I think about it, the stray problem isn't as bad as it was when I was a kid, maybe because spaying/neutering programs have been successful.) As soon as my parents split up and we stayed with my non-allergic mom, we got a dog. Then we got another dog, so we had two.

As soon as I moved out on my own as an adult, I also got a couple cats. (At one point, I had 5 cats and a dog, yikes! Once you have one cat, it seems like everyone finds a stray or a kitten that needs a home, and -- voila! -- suddenly you've got multiple cats, at least if you're like me and you can't say no to homeless pets. This doesn't even count the numerous strays I myself found and took to no kill shelters -- for a $50 ""donation"" cost each -- because I simply couldn't take any more in, but I didn't want them to die horrible deaths on the streets because of the irresponsibility of the owners who abandoned them, failed to fix them, didn't tag or chip them, or otherwise didn't care about them after they got them.) Anyway, you get the drift: I love animals.

Yet, all my life, I was also a Nova- and Nature-watching science geek. I believed in responsible animal experimentation because I knew (and was occasionally reminded) that a couple of my siblings would be dead were it not for the animal-experiment based antibiotics that saved their lives. In my adulthood, I found myself realizing that, without animal experimentation in surgeries, I might have no nephews and possibly could have lost two of my sisters, since all of my nephews were born by emergency C-sections, and my sisters might well have died had the C-section deliveries not occurred. I almost died of the measles as a kid, so I would be dead too if it weren't for modern medicine circa 1969-1970.

I get a flu vaccine every year and I think the pseudo science that has confused people into not vaccinating their kids is a travesty (and it has been disproven multiple times already). Now I am a nurse, and when I worked ER, I saw the effects of people not vaccinating their kids. It's unconscionable to me that diseases which were eliminated in the industrialized world when I was a kid thirty years ago have returned. It's disgraceful that infants and children are dying of preventable diseases all over the world, but it's perverse and disgusting that it occurs in first world nations where the diseases were previously eradicated. Not only that, but it adds insult to injury to all the billions of deaths of experimental animals -- so they all died for NOTHING, just so dumb yuppie moms scared by Internet-perpetuated pseudo-science can choose not to vaccinate their kids and get a bunch of other people sick, such that some will die??

Of course I was and remain opposed to animal testing by cosmetics companies. I knew how cruel and pointless the experiments were, without any scientific merit or methodology, and without the humane practices of university research that must pass institutional review boards before the research is conducted. I was anti-fur, though not anti-leather; I don't condone the farming of animals for fur, though it's really not that different from the factory farming of all our non-organic meat. Humans have been eating and using animals for thousands upon thousands of years, but not on the disgusting and inhumane scales of factory farming and fur farming. (Yet I'd never do what the animal liberationists do, freeing a bunch of fur animals that have been raised in captivity for generations -- I bet the majority of them die, because they don't know how to hunt or how to evade predators. It's almost as inhumane to release them into the wild -- they're like snacks for coyotes, hawks, etc. -- as it is to leave them on a fur farm.)

I'm not anti-hunting, but I dislike trophy hunting and I despise the heartless caged hunts of big game people like Ted Nugent get up. If you can shoot it, you should eat it, is my position, or at least feed it to other people, which is why I condone the donation of hunted deer to food banks and why I've eaten venison and elk. (Aside from the fact that they taste good.) I grew up with stories from both my parents, who grew up through the Great Depression, on how animals used to be slaughtered, how you slaughtered and killed chickens and ducks (including the running around of headless chicken bodies).

I fished a lot as a kid on our summer vacations up in the north woods, and my cousin and I used to kill and clean people's fish for a quarter a piece. There is nothing like fresh fish, right after you caught them, killed, cleaned, and grilled on an open fire at the beach; yes, there is a little outdoorswoman in this city girl. I don't consider it a tragedy to kill and eat something, and I daresay I'm a lot more in touch with my food than most because of that. For me, food doesn't come from a supermarket; I'm fully aware it comes from the animals themselves and the earth. I try not to eat factory farmed meat, not only because the organic, grass-fed, free-range meat and poultry is better for us, but because it's better for the animals, more humane, and more like the way we used to live *with* animals when humans first became agrarian (herders), than the way we live *off* them now.

All of that being said... I can't say I wasn't disturbed by the toxicology lab near my university job. I heard the dogs barking sometimes, though I never saw them. The toxicology staff were careful to never let anyone see the dogs or other experimental animals. They transported the experimental animals in steel covered carts, so on the rare occasions when we shared the elevators, you couldn't see the animals (and the animals couldn't see us). They could have been rats, rabbits or dogs, for all I knew. But I told myself that the toxicology lab followed university guidelines for animal research and that it was for science and medicine -- for the good of all.

Nevertheless, when I read Douglas Adams' The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy, I initially laughed aloud and then thought about the more profound implications of a casual line: white lab mice, Adams wrote, were actually an alien species visiting Earth and conducting ""frighteningly sophisticated experiments"" on humans. Frighteningly sophisticated indeed: what does it say about us, as a species that we wholesale experiment on and then kill animals we don't even use for food or clothing?

I remembered my brother telling me that there is a part of the Buddhist wheel of life when it is impossible to live without sinning. I thought he was full of crap, his white liberal Buddhism dalliance, until I asked a Buddhist Thai co-worker who confirmed that such a time exist in the Buddhist wheel of life. My brother thought we lived in a time when it is impossible to live without sinning because, whether he wanted it to or not, and whether he voted against it or not, his tax money goes to fund military interventions which necessarily result in the killing of civilians (collateral damage) and propping up of dictators (the enemy of my enemy is my friend).

Yes, that *is* sinful -- and when you have no control over it, it *is* impossible to live without sinning. Yet I couldn't help but think of all the lab animals that have died by the millions -- probably billions at this point -- so women could have fat sucked out of them by liposuction, so Revlon could test cosmetics, so pharmaceutical companies could churn out ""sister drugs"" of existing successful drugs, instead of actually inventing new treatments that cure rather than treat diseases. I remember an ex-army doctor I worked with, telling us at a party how they would shoot up hogs with AK-47s so the new guys could practice trauma surgery. I was like: but they anesthetized them, right? He just laughed. Yeah. Your tax dollars at work there, too.

So I love animals and I eat them and I'm anti canned hunts but not anti hunting and I'm anti fur but not anti leather, and I respect the gains made with animal research and experimentation while wondering if it has all been worth it if once-eradicated diseases have returned in 21st century America.

It all sounds like cognitive dissonance and it probably is. I guess I live with it and though it bothers me at times, I (like other health care professionals) consider the benefits to outweigh the risks, the pros to outweigh the cons.

But films like The Plague Dogs make the cognitive dissonance really, really dissonant.",1411776000,4,14393,4.551004636785162

210877,3,6300132641,"In my weird curious quest to see disturbing kids films I was draw to one of the most gruelling 'Plague Dogs'. This one begins in an animal lab where dogs are being experimented on and we are immediately greeted with a drowning dog meeting its maker, or does he? The film diverges into many compelling moments but it is very bizarre watching animated dogs talking in a cute way but with a bleak atmosphere. It all seems so unsettling and ominous with morbid music and gore throughout.
The scenes are often nightmarish and at times far too strong for children. One of the strongest, and infamous scenes, shows a hunter going after an escaped dog and shooting himself in the face. The scene actually shows the blood pouring out of his face and subsequently dying. We cheer on the actions as the dogs are now free to escape, but the humans as usual are painted in a bad light as the real enemies. This has psychological ramifications that must impact a young child's mind.

Not for kids? John Hurt voices one of the dogs, Snitter, and he seems to love these gory animations as he was also voicing a rabbit in Watership Down. Martin Rosen was the main mind behind the film as he was also with Watership Down so he also seems to revel in kids movies with tons of gore. Richard Adams was also responsible for the novle of both this and Watership Down so easily it can be seen that it is a specific type of film. An animation for teens or adults. It could be argued it is not a kids film but the animated talking animals would be a drawcard so how do you police this type of film?

210883,5,6300132641,"My first encounter with The Plague Dogs was probably a little too young... I was around ten or twelve, and some genius at Blockbuster Video (remember them?) had stuck this in with all the animated kids movies. I bought it on VHS and can still vividly recall watching it in a state of something akin to shock. Not because it graphically depicted the realities of a vivisection lab and the the consequences it had for Snitter, although I will say that the depictions of his deteriorating mental state is something that remained with me for many, many years. And not even because of the two dogs die - and of exhaustion, at that - but because I KNEW, young as I was, that while the story itself was fiction, animal testing was not.

And so it was one of those movies that strikes such a chord, you don't know whether it is phenomenally brilliant or the most terrible thing you've ever laid eyes on. Just the thought of it certainly made me physically ill for a long time afterwards.

Recently, I was going through some old boxes in the garage and came across my $5 VHS tape from Blockbuster. I popped it into my antiquated old VCR, and the moment the opening credits came up, I could not stop trembling. After having only seen this once, and a good twenty years ago at that, it appears I hadn't forgot a second of this movie. And that was worse than my first time viewing, because now I knew exactly how it would end. Hopeless. There were a few scenes where I had to either stop watching for a moment or fast forward a bit, and I honestly don't know how I made it through this as a kid. Maybe it was so much worse now since after having been breeding dogs for several years, and been involved in the politics of the dog world, I see this movie less as personification and more as a truth we sweep under the rug or worse, trivialize.

To be perfectly honest, I was getting more than a little queasy about 3/4 of the way through and finally had to shut it off. The Plague Dogs transcends the politics of animal rights and approaches a terrible subject in a humane manner that forces you to confront these realities. After my second time watching, after having been furious for so many years that some moron stuck this in the family section, I've come to the conclusion that The Plague Dogs IS a children's movie, after all, and am grateful to whomever left it there (on purpose, I suspect) because I think it did go a fair way in turning my stomach to these sorts of practices and forcing me to think.

One of them I didn't pick up on until later was Scroudingers test (I think that's what it's called) which is done with monkeys. Google it. I don't want to give away too much, but this in my opinion is way, way darker than Watership down and the ending will pull at your heartstrings. The thing that disturbed me the most was Snitter. I don't know what they did to him in that lab but it really ****ed him up to the point of skitzo. I really felt sorry for him. The reason I give this 4 stars instead of 5 is because it suffers from a problem that wasn't too bad in Watership down...the audio. The audio was really strange. The sound and music was way louder than the character voices and I often strained to hear what they were saying.

210976,4,6300132641,"It's easy to look at the cover of the movie ""Plague Dogs"" and then call the kids into the living room for an enjoyable Sunday matinee. There is a deceptive nature to the beautiful hand drawn animation of cute little animals that harkens back to the golden age of Disney animation. This would be a mistake however for it's that very deceptive quality to ""Plague Dogs"" that makes this film such a treat for adults and a rather disturbing nightmare for children.

Like it's predecessor ""Watership Down"" (another Richard Adams book made into an animated feature by director Martin Rosen), ""Plague Dogs"" is a very adult tale about animals in jeopardy. In ""Watership..."" it was a small group of rabbits in search of a safe home. ""Plague Dogs"" is the story of two dogs who escape from a testing laboratory. Together they are desperate to find safety and a life free of abuse and pain. The smaller dog (Snitter) having just had brain surgery, is a smart but tortured animal. Rowf, is a dog mentally and physically beaten by repeated drownings.  Together they search for peace, but peace does not come easily on an empty stomach and the many pastures of sheep are too tempting for the two dogs to pass up. As sheep carcasses begin to pile up local farmers begin to make the connection that the testing laboratory may have had something to do with the two wild dogs that are roaming their land. When it's discovered that the laboratory was working with Bubonic plague, the dogs are marked for death.

Ultimately ""Plague Dogs"" is an adventure tale; however, director Martin Rosen uses the bleak storyline to propel a theme of hopelessness. Snitter and Rowf and undesirables, cast out by bad luck and bad timing. The society that they find themselves in is unable to fully understanding their situation and their destruction is a simply seen as a more effective way of dealing with them.  The ending in particular has our two furry antagonists in questionable straights.

Such a film would not play well today, nor did it play that well in this country  25 years ago. It asks too many questions, pushes too many cringe inducing buttons, and often doesn't wait for the passive viewer to catch up. I can't think of one reason why or how a movie like this got made, but it's our great fortune it did. ""Watership Down"" proves to be a better movie experience but ""Plague Dogs"" goes where ""Watership Down"" didn't and we are all the better for it.",1180483200,42,2428,4.661214953271028
210977,5,6300132641,"I don't really have a lot to add about the film itself that the other reviewers haven't already said; this is a dark, distressing, relentlessly grim and harrowing film about two dogs on the run from an animal research laboratory. It has a somewhat slow pace at times, and much of the animation is crude by today's standards, but it has tons of character. It's not exactly a pleasant experience but it has great power and a worthwhile message. Just to make it clear (if it isn't already), this is mature material only suitable for older teens and adults.

I actually just wanted to address a couple of points in a previous review (possible spoilers coming). The original film, released in the UK in 1982, was 1 hour 42 minutes - this is the full, unedited version which can ONLY be found on the Australian DVD release (the quality isn't great, but at least you're getting to see the whole film). The difference in running time (99 mins on DVD as against 102 mins in theaters) is simply down to the fact that films run slightly faster on VHS and DVD than they do on the big screen; ALL films are approximately 3 - 4% shorter when transfered to home entertainment formats.

When it came time to release the film in the USA, director Martin Rosen had great difficulty finding a distributor willing to take it on. That shouldn't come as too much of a surprise; the film is far too disturbing for kids or families, and adults are likely to dismiss an animated  feature with talking animals as kids' stuff - so who exactly would pay to see this movie? In an effort to placate the distributors, Rosen was forced to cut 17 minutes from the film's running time. Some of the cuts were simply made to speed up the pace, and others were made to remove some of the more unpleasant scenes (most notably the sight of a human corpse which the starving, desperate dogs have partially eaten). Needless to say, these cuts did little to lighten the film's grim tone, and it only ever received a brief and extremely limited run at a few US theaters. Unfortunately, it is this shorter version that has been used for most of the recent DVD releases; as I mentioned before, only the Australian edition has both versions included.

There were some changes to the plot in the transfer from novel to screen. The somewhat forced but nevertheless welcome happy ending in the book was removed, to make the film a more powerful anti-vivisection statement. Also the fate of the fox, or The Tod as he is known, was changed; in the book he falls victim to a hunt, whereas in the film he sacrifices himself to a pack of army hounds as a distraction, allowing the two titular dogs to escape (temporarily) on a train. This was NOT changed due to any pressure from pro-hunting groups; neither Richard Admas or his admirers would have tolerated such a move. I imagine it was changed to allow the Tod's death to play a more important part in driving the plot forward, and to show us the wily fox was a noble fellow in the end.",1178668800,37,2985,4.49171270718232

210979,5,6300132641,"_The Plague Dogs_ by Richard Adams has long been one of my favorite books.  For this reason, I have avoided seeing Martin Rosen's adaptation until now; I was afraid I would be deeply disappointed, that the film would somehow tarnish my relationship with the book.  Although the film adaptation falls short in places, and there are slight variations in plot (notably, in the last five minutes of the film), overall it is an exceptional work that stays true to the heart of the book.

Fortunately, I have not seen the entire movie in its original format.  If I had, I may be disappointed.  Having researched the changes that were made, I do see how Martin Rosen's original rendition would have been stronger.  However, those new to the film will not be disappointed.

Also, there seems to be a debate about the ending of the film vs. that of the novel.  Although completely different, both endings are equally as strong and poignant.  Both the book and the film will elicit an emotional response from all except the coldest of hearts.

The voice actors in the film are excellent.  John Hurt, who did the voice of Hazel in _Watership Down_, appropriately performs as Snitter.  Christopher Benjamin excels as Rowf.  We are even briefly treated to the voice of Patrick Stewart in a very small role.

This film falls short in one area: length.  It is impossible in 87, or even 99 minutes to thoroughly develop the plot of the novel.  The absence of Digby Driver, for example, eliminates a fascinating and ironic subplot from the film.  However, since editing was necessary, it was nice that Rosen chose to focus almost exclusively on the animals themselves.

If you, like me, have read the book and are thinking about checking out the DVD, please do not hesitate.  The animation is beautiful, the voice acting is excellent, and it is thematically true to the book.  Its only shortcoming is its length.",1175904000,4,1895,4.754601226993865
210980,4,6300132641,"This woefully underappreciated animated film was created by the team behind the wonderful Watership Down. The story concerns a pair of dogs, Rowf and Snitter, who escape from an animal-testing lab in the wilds of England and their attempts to survive in a cold and hostile world. Rowf and Snitter traverse the wilds and encounter both a fox named The Tod who trains them in the ways of being wild and humans who are either afraid of them or try to hunt them. The film is excellently animated and touches on themes of friendship, bravery, and animal rights. The ending is very moving and always makes me shed a tear or two.

Many talented people lent their skills to this movie. Martin Rosen, also the creator of Watership Down, led a team which took almost two years to painstakingly craft this masterpiece. Among the actors who gave vocal performances for The Plague Dogs are John Hurt, Nigel Hawthorne, and Patrick Stewart as an army major. I was even surprised to see Brad Bird's (creator of The Iron Giant and The Incredibles) name in the credits as an animator!

Unfortunately, while the film itself is great, this DVD leaves a little bit to be desired. The movie is presented in its North American edited length of 85 minutes. There is apparently a longer 99-minute cut available on DVD from Australia, but only in PAL video format. The film itself looks in pretty good condition for being almost 25 years old. Other than Scene Selection and Interactive Menus (as if those even count), the DVD is devoid of any special features. Another feature lacking on the DVD that I do miss from my old VHS copy is closed captions or subtitles. I have a little difficulty making out some of the difficult British Isles accents, especially from The Tod and the sheepherding dogs.

I highly recommend that fans of adult, drama-oriented animation (and Watership Down fans in particular) check this one out. Despite its barebones DVD presentation, it's a great, powerful film that deserves to be seen. I give the film 5 stars but subtract 1 star for the lackluster DVD presentation.",1136937600,66,2072,4.75
210981,5,6300132641,"Richard Adams's novel 'The Plague Dogs' always stood in the shadow of his superior masterpiece - the classic 'Watership Down'. The same goes for the animated films, both of them directed by Martin Rosen. The animated version of The Plague Dogs, released four years after the acclaimed Watership Down, never quite achieved the kind of success its predecessor had; not because it wasn't as good, but because of pretty much the same reasons for the novel's limited success. While Watership Down hid violence and severe social-political criticism behind a disguise of a children's tale, The Plague Dogs is much more in-your-face, much less subtle, and makes no attempts to hide itself behind pretty words. The Plague Dogs is a tragic tale that is mercilessly critical toward modern society, taking a strict stand on the subject of cruelty to animals. The idea of an animated film strictly for adults was as difficult to swallow twenty years ago as the idea of a novel for adults told from an animal's point of view. Therefore, movie-goers didn't quite know what to make of the film; it didn't seem right for an adult to go watch an animated film about animals - and a parent who takes his little child to this film would face an even bigger problem of explaining to them why the bad people do such horrible things to the poor dogs.

Fortunately, today we know that animation isn't just for kids, and we can fully appreciate this masterpiece. The story is that of two laboratory dogs, voiced brilliantly by John Hurt and Christopher Benjamin, who escape from their cages and from the lab seeking the freedom of the outside world, and finding out that surviving in the wilderness isn't as easy as that. The scientists have reason to believe that the dogs contacted a bubonic plague virus during their escape, and so the two must run for their lives and fight for survival. Most of the film is from the dogs' point of view (they are later joined by a fox, voiced by James Bolam, who helps them survive in the wild, not without his own reasons). On the other hand we also hear the humans' conversations, yet we never see a human being's face; Rosen doesn't allow us to sympathize or identify with any of the human characters. The animals are clearly the more humane here, and that's the basis of what Rosen and Adams say here.

Be warned - don't let the animation fool you, this is not an easy watch. The violence in The Plague Dogs is more explicit than in most live action films, and the message it bears about human beings as a whole is difficult to swallow. John Hurt's performance as Snitter, alternately funny and sad, dominates the film, and it makes for one of the most beautiful and round animated characters ever seen on film. The story, especially that of Snitter's, is incredibly sad and touching, and is more powerful emotionally than any other animated feature I've seen. A highly recommended film, and not just for animation enthusiasts.",1123545600,10,2944,4.714563106796117

7803351,5,6300132641,"PLEASE NOTE THIS REVIEW HAS CERTAIN THINGS THAT REFER TO THE REGION 2 PAL VERSION BUT IN GENERAL THE REVIEW IS FOR THE FILM ITSELF ALSO.

The Plague Dogs is a film that comes from the book of the same title, some parts liberally and the ending left to interpretation.

First things first, THIS IS NOT A KIDS FILM, for the love of God I have seen some people review this as a horrid kids film and it is not (same with Watership Down, not a kids movies yet somehow gets lumped into child entertainment, even for the 70's).  This is a film about the lives of two dogs that escape a testing facility and are pursued by the government and the media.  The dogs escape and eventually attack a sheep (different from book to movie but I will stick to the movie here) and are eventually hunted. In the film, to get to the point faster, the viewer knows via exposition that they never got near where tests on the Plague are happening but the fact that it may have been possible (because of a lone flea) they are portrayed as ""possible carriers"" and the manhunt starts.

Keep in mind I am over simplifying the plot a bit but that is the gist of it. While out they meet a  ""The Todd"" (for fellow Americans that don't know, another name for a fox)  and he teaches them how to survive out in the wild.  The fox is ever cunning and you are never quite sure of his intentions, coupled with the smaller dog Snitter who had a brain surgery (see movies as to why) and Rowf the big black dog that is cynical (for good reason) and the film also tells the story about cruelty of performing vivisection and animal research for its own sake.

There are two cuts of the film, 86 minutes and 103 minutes.  America only saw the full uncut version from Thorn Productions on the old Thorn EMI VHS (not sure if that edit was theatrical or not), only 8000 were made.

Then there is the 86 minute version.  Embassy pictures picked it up and ordered cuts. THIS was given a limited theatrical release and Charter Productions (Charter Entertainment Home Video) released it on VHS with the run time of 99 minutes on it (I've owned multiple copies, their version was never 99 minutes).  99 minutes basically comes to the 103 minute cut after you factor in what some call PAL speed up (more Frames Per Second, NTSC, which is America is 24/25 FPS and PAL rounded up is 30 FPS).

HERE is where we diverge in the review for the PAL Region 2 disc I bought.

Anchor Bay in the UK released a copy with BOTH cuts and I believe some nice extras but as fast as it was made was as fast as it was gone, very collectable.  There was an American domestic version, but only the 86 minute version, again, very hard to find.  Then there is this version of the DVD I got with both versions released by Optimum releasing. This is bare bones in the fact that it is just the two versions of the film (and I am okay with that). The picture on the 86 minute cut is fantastic (and full frame which is how I believe it was made).  I was really happy with it. HOWEVER, the longer 103 minute cut is obviously sourced from a well worn 16mm or 35mm print.  It's not horrific, but on a scale from one to ten I give it a 7.5.  I can't help but wonder what happened to the original elements after the original cut, story is the longer print is from the producers private collection and only known surviving copy.

*SLIGHT SPOILER ALERT*

Are the differences worth it? Some of it seems superfluous but adds to the character of the dogs and the fox development but in reality it does show they are out longer than the shortened version seems. By the end of the film you see Rowf's ribs and you wonder why, longer version shows you via titles DAY ONE, DAY TWO, etc... (By the end of the film they are out there 40 plus days).  They removed a ""graphic"" scene (as it was deemed).  In both versions a hunter is dispatched to hunt and kill the dogs, the fox saves them, hunter falls off mountain and dies. In the longer take, you see the helicopters flying around looking for the dogs and you see a mutilated body, the hunter, and you are to assume the dogs ate the guy (though never said but slightly implied in both  versions).  Another crucial difference is (if you've seen the shorter version), you don't hear the end theme song over the opening credits like in the cut version.

 *BIG SPOILER ALERT*

Another ""hmm"" moment is the ending. For those that know the book ended on a happy and sad note. Author wanted a down ending and the publisher said you can't do that, author said yes I can, long story short, the book ends with the dogs drowning. At which point the author has a ""Conversation"" with the reader in a type of poem rarely used for and it basically says, ""here's your happy ending"" and we read ending #2 where all is well.

The movie does and does not do that,

At the end of the flick the dogs swim away because the smaller dog wants to swim to an island for dogs.  It is in this swim he tires and comes the realization there is no island and the other dog Rowf says, ""yes there is, look, there it is! Our Island!"" and the audience realizes they are swimming to their death into the fog and as credits roll, you kind of see what looks like a mountain/land.

Longer version, same set up, however the mist slowly falls away and you see what you see in the credits of the shortened version. So was Richard Adams intention of a double meaning done in the longer version but sort of pushed to his original version for not a happy ending from the end of the book, that is for the viewer to decide.  I'll be honest, when I watch the shorter version I think one way and when I watch the longer version, I tend to believe they may live, but then again, you never know.

All in all, Plague Dogs is a very good film that I have seen people actually say, ""hit me right in the gut.""  People that would never show emotion period.

Also, until rights holders decide who and when can release a proper special edition without wanting too much money the Optimum DVD is the best one to get from Amazon or Amazon seller.  Just make sure you have a DVD Player or a Blu-Ray Player that can play multi-regioned DVD's and convert PAL to NTSC if you are in the states (same with Blu-Ray player, an all zone player usually covers the bases).",1508803200,,6255,4.2650296359017785
7803352,5,6300132641,"I bought this DVD quite a few years back, and remember it was a chore to find it then. Appears to be near impossible to track down these days. Rest assured knowing that any efforts and hassles one endures will be rewarded greatly.

""The Plague Dogs"" will tax your emotions to previously untested limits. While watching the film, you will be surprised that a 'cartoon' can inspire such sadness and empathy. Although I love animals, I wouldn't classify myself as any sort of animal rights activist. I realize animal testing is sometimes necessary, and I indulge in my share of meat and meat by-products. Regardless of your stance on the issues mentioned, ""The Plague Dogs"" will kick you in your emotional teeth. Through a brutal, bleak and realistic portrayal of the canines' suffering, you may reevaluate certain opinions.

The journey of Skitter and Rowf is compelling to watch, but might be too graphic for younger audiences. Like Adams' ""Watership Down"", it will prompt many questions from children about violence and death. Unlike ""Watership Down"", this film ends on a down note; after the entire story has already dragged viewers into a valley of despair. Life has not been kind to our heroic pups, and understanding this, they state a preference for death at several points throughout the movie.

As far as the DVD itself, it is stripped down to almost nothing. The opening menu treats you to two choices, ""play movie"" and ""scene selection"". No language or subtitle options either. Film quality is standard fare.

My final advice: if you like adult themed animated features like ""Graveyard of the Fireflies"" and ""Barefoot Gen"", hunt a copy of ""Plague Dogs"" down and settle in for a powerful experience.",1506124800,,1707,4.937282229965157
