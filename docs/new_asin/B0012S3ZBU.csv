8247549,5,B0012S3ZBU,"A very touching set of personal stories set against a wider commentary. The stories of Dvir and his mother Miri, and the people who surround them are told through the eyes of Dvir, who is eleven or twelve years old at the start, and thirteen at the end. This is important to realise, because the focus is on how the stories, and the lives, impinge on Dvir's existence. Tomer Steinhof, as Dvir, gives a beautiful and screen-commanding performance, while Roni Yudkevitz's Miri is understated and devastatingly realistic. This film lays bare the impact that the impersonal regime at social collective agricultural Kibbutzes can have on somebody's sense of person. Watch this film. Love Miri. Love Dvir. Hate injustice.",1434153600,,715,5.067796610169491
8247550,5,B0012S3ZBU,"This movie is of modern kibbutz life.

Having nowhere to go and no skills but looking after cuttle female is being looked after by her younger 12 y.o. son.

Regrettably, not much comedies present to a world from Israel but dramas.

Fresh insite for foreign viewers is surely of educative and entertaining value.",1236211200,,311,4.830188679245283
