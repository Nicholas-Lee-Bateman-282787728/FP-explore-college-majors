It's a really well made film, and if you haven't seen it, try not to spoil it for yourself because it's a really interesting watch. I finally got the DVD yesterday, but I haven't checked the Features out yet. I'm a sucker for commentary tracks though, so I'll probably check one of the two out today. It's a really fair price for the quality of film and features you're getting. I can't recommend this movie to people enough. If you're curious at all of underground horror, you have to check it out!",1310774400,,634,4.291666666666667

2799793,4,B000OU28J2,"*Possible Spoilers* I love this movie! The director also did ""The Burrowers,"" but this is a totally different kind of movie. I knew this guy was an original when I saw his first (very experimental) film, ""Soft For Digging."" But this was an unexpected delight. It's a horror movie inside a documentary. Most of the documentary bits are real. JT, the director, interviews actual authors, psychologists, and filmmakers. He talks to the Toe Tag Pictures folks (You know, August Underground and so on) and Bill Zebbub. Let's back up a sec. If you don't know August Underground or Bill Zebbub, if you can't identify Debby D on sight, you probably won't get this movie, so stop right here. Anyway, JT starts out at a horror convention, interviewing all these real people. These are straight-up interviews with underground horror film people. But in the middle of all of this, he interviews a filmmaker named ""Eric,"" who makes a series of films called S&Man. (That's ""Sandman,"" by the way, not ""S and M Man."" Eric is quite pissy about this distinction.) Eric is a cute, chubby, sweetfaced fanboy. And he appears to be stalking and killing women for real. The more JT focuses on him, the more unsettling things get. Some reviewers have griped that they saw the twist coming. There IS no twist, Oh Dipstick Reviewers. You're supposed to believe that Eric is a killer from the first time you see him. He confesses to murder about two dozen times during the film, but no one wants to believe him. The ultimate question this film raises is voiced by the author of ""Men, Women, and Chain Saws."" She comments (and I'm paraphrasing) ""if you watch hyper-violent movies all the time, can you even recognize the real thing when you see it?"" Damn good question. I loved this sly, evil bit of filmmaking, and I can't wait to see more from this director!",1298246400,18,1832,4.710280373831775
2799794,1,B000OU28J2,"Just saw this at a film festival and was really disgusted at how this thing portrays horror film fans. By concentrating on the lowest NO-BUDGET videographers who peddle thinly veiled horror / p0rn these 'mockumentary' makers are working this angle to try to break into Hollywood by shamelessly pandering to the PC (politically correct) crowd who desperately want to show any evidence of misogyny in the world.

The overwhelming majority of this 'mockumentary' is a series of interviews with a fake producer of 'snuff films' that the mockumentary makers try to pass off as 'real' footage! They even try to make it seem legitimate by inserting interviews with real life crappy no-budget 'directors'! By putting a spotlight on wretched pukes like Bill Zebub they are giving these sideshow charlatans the publicity they crave and are actually FEEDING the no-budget crapfest machine they pretend to condemn (while getting a foot in the door of Hollywood themselves - see, all of the pukes win).

The technical side of this 'mockumentary' is atrocious as it looks like they shot it with multiple types (and various degrees in quality) of cameras. The editing during the 'real life' interviews looks suspicious as hell with all kinds of jump-cuts that appear to be stringing together statements of interviewees to make them sound as insane as possible. Of course people are going to be voyeuristic and want to see this thing out of curiosity but one needs to keep in mind that this is indeed a 'hit job' that aims to paint virtually all low budget horror fans as perverts (some are, but others simply like cheap horror flicks just for the fun of it, including many women).

Watch out for those clever inserts of stock footage to cover up a lot of jump cuts which are indicated by the dubious audio pasting. Pure exploitation ABOUT exploitation! The hypocrisy of these 'mockumentary' makers is astounding. Horror fans BEWARE! This thing was not made FOR you, it was made to INSULT you.",1286409600,16,1977,4.913173652694611

I found everyone to be very interesting, genuine, and, in the case of the filmmakers themselves, far more entertaining than their movies! Bill Zebub is hilarious! All this said, the best thing about S&NDMAN is the way that JT Petty weaves a fictional character into the narrative, making him as believable as the factual subjects. This gives the movie a sort of MAN BITES DOG feel. If you love horror, or ""mock-umentaries"" like THE POUGHKEEPSIE TAPES, then this should be on your wish list...",1364947200,4,725,5.0

2799802,4,B000OU28J2,"S&Man is a horror movie within a documentary. The commentary from the underground filmmakers is actually very interesting; they explain why they make these films and also talk about the specific genres they explore. Throughout the film, you'll also see clips from movies like Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer and the August Underground series. The S&Man series is introduced within the film as they interview Eric, the creator of the series. He records himself as he stalks women then murders them on camera. His overall characteristics and actions are extremely creepy and add some tension to the movie. The movie is extremely graphic and realistic; without spoiling much, the film includes vomiting, stabbings, neck slices and nudity throughout.

Overall, the film's documentary is very interesting and I think anyone interested in horror or film in general will enjoy it. The film is violent so be prepared and remember that it's all fake; I was even a bit put off by the extreme violence but got through to the (kind of) twist ending. As of 6/11/12, the film is available on Netflix Instant streaming.",1339372800,3,1107,5.016304347826087
2799803,4,B000OU28J2,"<strong>S&Man</strong> (J. T. Petty, 2006)

Note: while I'm sitting here writing a review, I'm going to start off by telling you not to read it. Tru fax. If you haven't yet seen this movie, and you have ANY interest in seeing it whatsoever, I will advise you as strongly as possible not to read anything at all about it before you watch it, because while nothing anyone says will be a ""spoiler"" in the way we know the term, knowing nothing at all about even the structure of this movie before you start will greatly increase your pleasure at the discovery of said structure. And given that there is really no way to talk about the film in any intelligent or meaningful way without discussing its structure...you get the point, I trust. Go watch the movie, THEN read the reviews.

Thus, insert another couple of lines of spoiler space. Seriously, I'm going to blow it for you with my very first sentence. So go watch the movie. Don't read this.

Okay, now that that's out of the way: in the eighties, the Chinese government wanted to bankroll a documentary about the then-still-secret(-and-officially-denied) hijinks got up to by the infamous Japanese military Unit 731. Problem was, back then there was so little solid evidence to go on (after all, since Unit 731 killed every Chinese national they came into contact with, pretty much, in order to cover their activities, doing non-fiction about them was pretty much impossible until they themselves started talking) that the director they hired, Shaw brothers exploitation specialist Tun Fei Mou, had a lot of conjecture and a bankroll. So he ended up making a new kind of mockumentary--one that wasn't meant as a comedy, but was meant to pass as a real documentary, or at least a real docudrama. The result, <em>Man Behind the Sun</em>, to this day ranks as one of the most over-the-top, extreme horror films of all time. More importantly, especially as relates to <em>S&Man</em>, it kicked off an entirely new subgenre of film, especially of horror film--the fictionalized documentary, which was brought to wordwide prominence a decade later with <em>The Blair Witch Project</em> (itself a knockoff of another American mocko, <em>The Last Broadcast</em>). <em>S&Man</em> takes us a little closer to the <em>Man Behind the Sun</em> roots of the subgenre, at least if Petty's voice-overs are to be believed; he started out with the idea of making a documentary about a peeping tom who lives in his neighborhood and how voyeurism relates to horror films. When the peeping tom refused to be on camera, Petty, like Mou, found himself with an idea and a bankroll. So he continued on with the documentary angle, but changed the focus somewhat, heading into the territory of the long-thought-mythical snuff film.

And even telling you that much is telling you too much about this movie, despite my not having gotten to the real ""spoilery"" bits. In fact, there's not a great deal I can say otherwise aside from telling you that Petty's interview subjects include Carol Clover (author of <em>Men, Women, and Chain Saws</em>, a look at the voyeurism-in-horror phenomenon), Fred Vogel, and Bill Zebub. (If you don't know those last two folks, this is probably not the movie for you.) There's some great footage of Bill at work, a great deal of solid interview footage with Vogel (who comes off a whole lot less creepy and a whole lot more frat boy than I would have ever guessed), and all kinds of other stuff that makes this well worth watching. But I can't give you the <em>real</em> skinny on why you want to watch this. That would be cheating. Let's just say Petty does some inventive things with the mocko genre that keep the veracity of the actual documentary footage intact while still managing to make this into something more than it would otherwise be. It's an inventive little film, and I quite liked it. *** ",1329264000,,3861,4.852807283763278

This one actually had me hoodwinked! I read the Amazon blurb carefully and convinced myself that it was, in fact, a narrative feature about a horror director who gets caught up in something dark and sinister while looking into the (fascinating to me) world of underground horror. Something like Shock Value.
So I watch the movie for about forty minutes and then the truth begins to sink in...this really is just a documentary.
Let's just set the record straight. I HATE Bill Zebub. Yeah, in the same way you hate that painful hangnail you just can't stop playing with. Surely there shall come a day when I allow the darker elements of myself to watch Bad Acid, but until then I try to keep myself as far away from the man as possible.
And yet I found myself enjoying him most of all. And he was among some pretty esteemed company. Fred Vogel and Christy ""Crusty"" White. Wow! Yeah, sure, the whole thing was transparently just a behind-the-scenes project for Toe Tag, going all mersh, but still, I liked it enough to merit a four star, which is as much as any documentary this side of Titicut Follies can expect to get from me.
And then I realized that this wasn't real at all.
That Eric Rost guy. Total make pretend. And oooh, it all took a dark turn after I realized that...

8186745,5,B000OU28J2,I love this film. It is a movie that lingers well after watching.  The movie is a true documentary on the Underground Horror movie scene with a Horror movie weaved in.  I have attended festivals such as the one portrayed in the film and the people at the booths who sell some of these underground Films are exactly as in the movie.  There is a whole different world of horror out there and you need to know what you are doing when searching it out or you will never find what you are looking for.

S&Man draws the horror film aficionado in by splicing together various out takes and interviews including with various film makers including the infamous August Underground players.  It humanizes the producers of these kinds of snuff films rather than demonizing them.  We see them peddling their ""art"" at underground festivals and selling their cheesy cinematic explorations to an even more deranged group of people... the viewers.  In doing so this film makes you keenly aware you are among the dweebs buying this stuff.  After all, you're here aren't you, and you're still watching?  We meet a ragtag motley cast of characters who are involved in the making, acting, directing, producing and purchasing the kinds of films most people cannot stomach.  Some are a bit more pathetic than others but for the most part they are a lovable bunch.  It was great to hear from the Scream Queens of horror and the splicing of a psychologist perspective regarding cameras perspective is a nice touch.  Out of all the characters we meet in this ""documentary,"" however, perhaps the least interesting and worst filmmaker of all us in fact, a real serial killer.  His films are the least colorful and flamboyant, precisely because real death and murder is nowhere need as sensational as we have come to expect as viewers.  It's not until the end that our suspicions are confirmed and the nauseating feeling of befriending a deranged lunatic has already sunk his teeth into our psyche.  I found this to be a very interesting movie on a whole host of levels.  Not the least of which was the question: When you watch enough death, carnage, and mayhem for entertainment, does real death loose its power?  What's more real?  For the Sandman, his victims know the answer first hand.  Cool movie.",1405900800,3,1942,4.923076923076923
