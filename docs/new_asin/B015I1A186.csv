Mathieu wants to be a writer but his work gets binned by the publishers he sends it to. He works as a removals man and longs to be taken seriously for his art. Then chance plays a hand and as he is clearing out an apartment of a deceased war veteran he happens on a manuscript written by the dead man of his war time adventures fighting in Algeria.

Mathieu decides to write it up and take it as his own. The book is dynamite and his World changes for ever and for the better. However, the chance that his little ruse may be rumbled is an ever present risk and then fate comes calling a second time.

 Mathieu is played by the very Gallic Pierre Niney (Yves St. Laurent) and he gives a physically demanding performance and makes it all look believable. He is comfortably supported by a super cast that includes the wonderful Ana Girardot (Next time Ill aim for the heart). The film is very stylistic too with great cinematography and just the right level of tension to keep you hanging on for more. It is one of those where you don't notice the time passing and that is high praise for any film. In French and around 100 minutes long this is for lovers of thrillers, French cinema or just a ruddy good story.",1455494400,,1239,4.309012875536481
