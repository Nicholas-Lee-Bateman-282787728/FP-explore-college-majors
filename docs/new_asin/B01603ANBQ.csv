7454159,5,B01603ANBQ,"A Frenchman sees the towers in a newspaper and decides that he wants to tightrope walk between them!  He gathers some friends and makes his way to NYC to study the area.

Then he and his helpers make their moves to accomplish the goal. Amazing! My legs tingled. One unneeded scene of male bare backside. Vivid visuals of the city. Unforgettable. A true story. Some subtitle.",1443916800,,374,4.651515151515151
7454160,5,B01603ANBQ,"(*update follows original review): ""Excellent! I cannot wait for the 3D bluray/dvd combo!  I saw this movie first day, first show, in 3D IMAX, Wednesday, September 30, 2015 (paid $19!).  Movie is excellent! BUT! The blue 3d IMAX glasses: sucked.  I have had much better sturdier black 3d glasses for cheaper 3d movies!  These 3d imax glasses fell apart.  both stems/temples are OFF.  AND the glass was streaked/glare.  AND I sat in the back row (mistake, as I should have sat in middle MIDDLE of the theatre) so I was not close to the screen.  AND the step lights, aisle lights, were coming from my left -and right.  so these things were annoying me, and taking away from the experience.  WITH THAT SAID: the special effects are EXCELLENT!  THE 3D IS EXCELLENT!  The acting and directing are excellent!  Zemeckis has done it again.  I have been wanting to see this movie since I saw the trailer way back in March online!  I have been to the twin towers first time in summer of 1976, south tower, observation deck (and saw King Kong body covered up in tarp for filming of movie); in the early 1980s, in the north tower, in the restaurant WINDOWS ON THE WORLD.  And plenty of times I have walked around there, between the towers and inside in the lobby area, mainly south tower.  This movie makes it look like the twin towers are still there.  I wish they were, and wish someone would rebuild them (in a different spot).  They did a fantastic job of recreating the look of the towers and of the areas.  Bravo!  I plan on buying the movie when released in 3d.  BUT WISH IMAX  would allow me to return so I can watch it with better glasses, without re-paying.  I feel I spent $ 19 dollars for nothing though since I could not truly enjoy due to all these ""mistakes"".  (I would have stayed to rewatch but my mother was outside and waiting in the car for 2 1/2 hours, so I had to leave, and we both have disabilities, so cant stay away from home for too long).  GO SEE THIS MOVIE!  Especially in 3-D if you can.  (I took Dramamine before movie so I did not feel dizzy as I do have vertigo; but now regret as I believe took away from ""the feeling"").  ENJOY!  (Comes out nationally in theatres Friday, October 9).  BYE!"" //// UPDATE: Movie is still excellent; better, since I watched on my own 3d tv, up close.  Showed it to my mother.  Bought 3d bluray and 2d bluray combo pack at best buy on Tuesday, January 5, 2016.  Watched January 6th.  My mother almost had heart attack, due to last 30 minutes of tension and the walk in 3D.  Which I totally agree.  Keeps you on the edge of the seat. And in 3D, you feel like you are up on that wire 110 stories up in the air, My glasses are in great condition, not like the imax 3d glasses I had in September, which were scratched, fell apart, and piece of sh*t. The movie is much better in 3D, and this movie SHOULD BE SEEN IN 3D ONLY. Thanks.  Like my father used to say: watch movie at home when comes to video instead. And Happy New Year to everyone!",1443830400,,2988,4.29802513464991

7454163,5,B01603ANBQ,"The Walk is based on the true story about a french tight-rope walker whom, under the cover of night, rigged a wire across the twin towers in New York upon it's completed construction and amazed the world with his death defying work.

The movie is directed by Robert Zemeckis (Flight, Cast Away, Who Framed Roger Rabbit) and stars Joseph Gordon-Levitt in the titular role. This film is shot as a heist movie with a fantastical view. The script is snappy and the characters endearing. Their positive attitude and ability to chase their dreams is catchy and inspiring. The cinematography is awe inducing and perfect for the 3D nature of the film.

The 3D is amazing to say the least. For a post-conversion it looks incredible and holds up spectacularly. There were very brief scenes where characters were hiding underneath a cloth or it was night where the shadows would make a brief muddy image in the 3D, but other than that the effect worked brilliantly and definitely enhanced the story.

Overall I loved watching this movie again. I enjoyed JGL performance even more this time around, and fell in love with Zemeckis' psudo-fairy tale like approach to this incredible true story. One of my favorite 3D films to date.",1529366400,,1217,4.813397129186603
7454164,5,B01603ANBQ,I read a book about this adventure to a 9-year old boy I tutor and he couldn't believe it was a true story. So I bought him the video because I knew he would love it!

7454173,5,B01603ANBQ,"In 1973, I was on a college theater tour to NYC while the World Trade Center was still under construction. Both towers had been topped off, but many upper floors were still open. One late afternoon I rode an elevator in the north tower to the 50th floor, found stairs, and kept climbing. Workers were quitting and headed down, and no one stopped me from going up. I reached the top floor, 110th, and found a ladder and opening to the roof (not stairs like in The Walk). I emerged at the outer edge where the face of the building angled to the top, and climbed outside on that angled portion to the roof at 1,368 feet. This is perfectly depicted in The Walk, and seeing it on film gave me waves of memories and renewed excitement. So I can vouch for the movie's accuracy in recreating the site. While my adventure could be called The Climb, The Walk took it a significant step further. (Photo I took of the south tower from the roof of the north tower, 1973)",1522540800,,957,4.322222222222222

7454180,5,B01603ANBQ,"This is an amazing film and very visceral in 3D. It manages to put you in Mr Petit's ballet shoes (I'm guessing) when he steps out onto the wire. I don't think I could've watched it if I didn't already know he survived the crossing. I won't spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen it, but he seemed to really push his luck during the walk, and I was still half expecting him to fall the whole time . . . I can't imagine how anyone could want to do what he did. I bought this hoping it would be a good showcase for the 3D technology, and it certainly is.",1518652800,,549,3.954954954954955

I will probably have nightmares as I'm terrified of heights but it's quite something to see almost first hand how heights don't bother others.  It prompted me to look at many web sites to learn about famous wirewalkers.  P.S. --- Can't even look at the picture on the cover to the left.

7454203,5,B01603ANBQ,"The movie depicts Petit's early influences, how he covertly organized the (illegal) wire walk at the World Trade Center, and how he met the folks who played key roles in his feat. He seems driven by an unseen influence as he is supremely confident and determined, yet doubt interjects itself on several occasions. Petit refuses to allow doubt to sway his goal of walking a wire between the Twin Towers. His moments on the wire are utterly mesmerizing--transcendent, really. The story is told in Petit's own words in first-person narrative, which I felt added to the intimacy the viewer feels towards Petit as the story unfolds. If you need inspiration or determination, or if you just want to see an amazing feat, watch this.",1500681600,,725,4.854838709677419

7454206,5,B01603ANBQ,"My wife and I started watching this movie and couldn't stop. Love the way the story is told with the narrative.
I had read Petit's book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Creativity-The-Perfect-Crime/dp/B00G3L6M9S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Creativity: The Perfect Crime</a>&nbsp;and enjoyed it immensely so I was interested to see what the movie would be all about.
The movie is truly a work of art and tells such a fascinating story you'll keep asking, ""how did they do that"" , ""what made this person want to do this?"" ""how could he have the guts to continue?""  It's a really fun movie and it's interesting throughout.
It was also very cool to see the Twin Towers again and the computer graphics are done so well you'll believe he is really at the twin towers again.
So glad we did not miss this great movie.
Joseph Gordon-Levitt was absolutely perfect in the title role.  Amazing.  You'll believe he is Petit as you watch.",1499040000,,965,5.3355263157894735

7454211,5,B01603ANBQ,"Everybody knows what this is about. So... why watch it? To know what makes the man tick? Well, he's (still) alive and healthy. To see early 1970s big boat cars driving around the streets you walk at lunchtime 40 years later? To see if a movie without explosions can entertain you? Yes. Yes! Absoleetly (as someone I know pronounces the word). It's been over a decade and a half since those towers imploded and I so wanted to see them again, in their full glory, without any references to what happened. I loved the precious seconds where the camera lingers on those aluminum gratings, as they earn their greyness from the sunrise. I simply could not stop looking at them. Most architectural critics despised them - though they'd never admit it of late. No matter. I waited for JoGoL (alias PhiP) to do his thing, I waited patiently and I enjoyed the wait. So, after a few false hints the man grabbed his pole, stepped onto the wire and looked down. So did I. So will you. So steel yourself.

It wasn't real - for me. And I couldn't possibly fall. Yet I sunk my hands into the unyielding chair rails to keep from sliding. And JoGoL spun, and the world with him. I would not give anything away by revealing that JoGoL actually learned how to wirewalk - though doing it 50 centimeters above a green screen is clearly and only mentally distinguishable from PhiP's real three quarters of an hour jaunt on an inch thick steel cable so many years ago. This is what 3D is best at, not action - slow moving folks against receding landscapes. I watched this movie 4 times so far, always in 3D. I caught a glimpse of it on regular TV recently and it's like watching Star Wars on your phone - the effects are wasted. This movie - to tweak the purists who despise colorization (I, for one, love it) should only be seen in 3D. Anything else won't do it justice. Can you imagine a restored 1933 King Kong, in full color, regenerated widescreen and 3D? How about Howard Hawks' The Thing? One can dream.

The Walk mesmerizes for the nonchalance with which it paints a New York long gone but melancholically reimagined. It was illuminating - literally and figuratively (because one learns more and more about the feat as it starts at night and the full effect unfolds with the sunrise) - to be taught how one can stretch the cable taut across the chasm and do it securely and safely. A real life telling of this tale is on Netflix and well worth a view. And one should try to watch the movie with French audio and English subtitles for a more authentique experience.

How many of you recall that the brochures promoting tourists to go to the observation deck on the South Tower were promising ""the closest some of you will ever get to Heaven""? Or that WPIX, a long-time fixture and local channel 11 used the Twin Towers as a visual logo? Or how they seemed to rise straight out of the water as one cruised on the Hudson River before the Battery Park City complex was built? Or how these towers swept upwards into the clouds on a rainy day with those thin ethereal aluminum columns so closely spaced that the scale would fool you into thinking they were so far away until you'd be right there, head craned back and staring into the vanishing parallelism of eternity? I can't recall the last time when I knew all along how a movie would end, yet stood in torsioned tension as my fascination was weaved into vertigo while the Little Philip stood taller (maybe by a hair) than the endpoints of his cable.",1493856000,2,3482,4.463108320251178

The film is great. It is narrated in a flashback, paced like a heist movie (Oceans 11, The Sting, Bank Shot), and has a good feel to it, even though the heroes are technically criminals. It's a crime of fun, like college pranksters.

Joseph Gordon-Levitt is a great lead, and really captures the soul of a passionate French artist.

(Odd note: he played Robin in The Dark Knight Rises, who, before becoming Bruce Wayne's ward, was an acrobat like Petitbelieve it or not!)
They handle the issue of of 9/11 tastefully (and subtly), and you have no negative emotions as the end credits roll.

7454256,5,B01603ANBQ,"Well, as a huge fan of Joseph Gordon-Levitt, I can with all honesty say that I have seen every movie he has ever made and been for the most part very pleased. the Walk is the story of Phillippe Petit, the wire walker that walked between the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center in 1974. The part is being played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt. I thought that I would be bored by the subject matter BUT I was not bored at all. The build up and the planning and the enlisting of his co-conspirators in France and in the U.S. was fascinating. the support cast Ben Kingsley, Charlotte Le Bon and the rest were superb and spot on. Make no mistake that although everyone in this cast was sensational it is Joseph and his portrayal of the often manic and self-centered but still somehow lovable Petit that steals the show. I highly recommend this film for everyone. the heights parts kind of put me off but a quick hit on the FF button and Voila.",1476576000,,933,4.337142857142857

Being a native New Yorker and having worked in an around the WTC for years, I immediately snapped to attention. I recognized the outer skeleton of the Trade Center immediately, but, wait a minute, the Trade Center no longer exists!. I had forgotten about the world famous walk between the towers, made all the more astounding by the fact that it can never be done again. At the time, it seemed a one-off stunt carried off by a Nut. This movie makes this man and his partners in ""crime"" REAL. It is a Romantic adventure film about a man living out his fantasy, no matter what the cost and risking his very life to make it happen. The 3D version is nothing short of sensational! I saw this at home on my own big screen 3D HDTV and I found myself gripping the arms of my chair in suspense, even though I knew that (thankfully) he did not fall.

What a character Philippe Petit is.

 I expected this movie to be boring, but it's anything but boring.  I've been trying to get some housework done while watching, but this movie is so captivating I can't tear myself away.  I remember when this tightrope walker got arrested for walking between the World Trade Center Towers, but never thought much about it. Wow! this illegal act took lots of planning,  clever 'spy' work on Phillipe's part & help from many accomplices. Plus he experienced  a serious foot wound 3 weeks before his walk.

By the way, I'm terrified of heights; my tummy got  upset during some segments & parts of the movie left me holding my breath & wishing Phillipe would not be so careless.

A note about closed captioning:
 I always use close captioning &  am watching this on STARZ.  I am missing some dialogue because quite a bit isn't showing up on the close captioning.  I don't know if this is a STARZ issue or not, but thought I'd mention it.",1469836800,,1019,4.552486187845304

The World Trade Center was one our business sites. In 1975 , my husband was on the roof of the North Tower before the buildings were finished and there wasn't a railing. We had just had a baby and he called me by cell phone ( yes you read that correctly) to test the signal. So this movie hit home on another level. He actually was one of the people responsible for putting the very first cell site on in NYC. I'm sure he would have loved this movie as he had a bit of dare devil in him maybe that's why I fell in love with him. If you ever go to tHE WTC Memorial at the very end of the Memorial you will get to see a piece of the broadcast Antenna that was on the North Tower. There is a photo of the South Towrrs as well and that's where our antennas and communications equipment was. I'm sad the towers are no longer here but I'm much sadder that my husband who brought communications to NYC is no longer with us.

7454323,5,B01603ANBQ,"A docudrama can either be informative or entertaining: THE WALK is based the book by Philippe Petits of a true event and as written for the screen by Christopher Brown and director Robert Zemeckis (Forrest Gump, Cast Away, Back to the Future, Polar Express and Flight) it is both and more. It not only shows in detail a terrifyingly dangerous high wire walk of 1974 but it also shares the passion and bravery and commitment of a very unique man. And it celebrates the camaraderie of friends who support a young mans dream.

The synopsis distills the main aspects of the story (two other films have been made about this event - Man on Wire (2008and High Wire (1984), and yet few people know the discipline and all the facts about daring action. Twelve people have walked on the moon, but only one man - Philippe Petit (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) - has ever, or will ever, walk in the immense void between the World Trade Center towers. Guided by his real-life mentor, Papa Rudy (Ben Kingsley), and aided by an unlikely band of international recruits, Petit and his gang overcome long odds, betrayals, dissension and countless close calls to conceive and execute their mad plan.

Joseph Gordon-Levitt incorporates a very fine French accent for the film and he is very well supported by not only Ben Kingsley but also by the supporting cast including Ben Schwartz, James Badge Dale, Steve Valentine, Csar Domboy, Benedict Samuel, Charlotte Le Bon among others.

Gordon-Levitt as Philippe narrates the entire film, offering some very fine lines to remember, such as I find myself in the middle of the wire. And I feel the void. And although a wire-walker should never look down... I do. And it was... It was beautiful. It was calm and beautiful, and serene, and ""not-dangerous.

The cinematography is brilliant using innovative photorealistic techniques and IMAX 3D wizardry by Dariusz Wolski and as the promo states, this film is truly a love story to Paris and New York of the 1970s. It is very difficult to see the World Center Twin Towers, knowing the terrorist destruction that was to dissolve them. But the film strikes all the right cords  even the painful memory of 9/11  and allows us to celebrate mans courage and our own grief. Grady Harp, June 16",1465689600,3,2249,4.783505154639175

7454357,5,B01603ANBQ,"For years and years, ""Amadeus"" was my favorite movie. But now I declare ""The Walk"", the greatest movie ever made.

The plot is as tight as the tightrope Philippe Petite walked on between the tops of the World Trade Center towers back in 1973. Petite is brilliantly portrayed by Joseph Leonard Gordon-Levitt under the direction of equally brilliant, Robert Zemeckis, who'd also directed Forrest Gump.

The then 24-year-old Petite's ability to put together a team of ""accomplices"" to pull a stunt of this magnitude is comparable only to sending men to the Moon and bring them back alive. Petite did what he did, not because it is easy, but because it is hard (to borrow words of Kennedy.)

What the movie inspires is nothing less than doing the impossible: Petite's walk, and also bringing back the towers to life.",1463184000,,812,4.827338129496403
7454358,3,B01603ANBQ,"Not recommended for those who have a terrifying fear of heights. So...""The Walk"" is really only about 12 minutes long, if you cut out all of the build-up to the actual walk.

Still this is an interesting film if you can be patient enough to make it through the first hour plus of the film. I didn't think that the acting was terrible and the computer graphics were certainly worth bragging about, but there isn't a whole lot of substance to the rest of the movie. If you are looking for a great film with an amazing plot and unexpected events...you won't find that here. What you will find is a determined Frenchman talking about walking between the world trade center buildings on a high-wire, practicing in other places and eventually...wait for it...walking between the world trade centers on a high-wire.

The love story is less than satisfying in my opinion and when the movie was over, I didn't cry. I may have felt a little like vomiting from the views of the ground below in the movie, but didn't shed a single tear for the characters. I actually thought the documentary about this was slightly more exciting than the movie.

Not the worst film I have seen this year by far, but not one that I particularly want to own, either. Worth a rental. There's a lot of dialogue. Be patient:)",1462924800,,1291,4.556034482758621

Gordon-Levitt played a great role well, and I noted that Petit was a coach/adviser in the credits so all I can say, even knowing that this ""walk"" was done in CGI (Computer Generated Imagery) is WOW!. When you get goose-bumps watching a movie, you know you are watching something special. I was totally blown away by this movie.

How in the world can a body get the idea that a form of art is wire-walking (are there circuses anymore? I loved the high-wire acts as a kid), and that to defy death gives one life? That's not me, but I kind of understand it. But to string a wire illegally and go to such lengths to achieve what is really an expressive and...how to describe this...act of daring and magnificent courage and confidence for success I've never seen before. And he pulled it off. Unbelievable...and unforgettable.

Is this a movie the family should watch? I think so. Some scenes scared the life out of me, but kids would probably be fine with it. However, it might give them some ideas...

I didn't know what I was going to see when I rented this, but I was totally enthralled with the plot, the actors, and the story. It was all done as good as could be done. And, I saw it as a kind of salute to the Twin Towers. I don't give five stars to any movie...previous to this one, but for that reason, it got the fifth one. Watch this movie.

Why walk on the wire? Its the life of Philippe Petit. He is inspired by the Twin Towers and wants to hang a wire and walk across. This is illegal. It begins in 1973 Paris, where he performs as a troubadour in the streets. This is illegal without a permit. He performs for money from the crowd. But a trick goes wrong and he goes to a dentist. He reads about the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center. He first saw wire walkers at age 8 and it inspired him. He has talents. He meets Papa Rudy of the White Devils and learns his lessons. He leaves home. The carrots are cooked. He performs juggling on a high wire. A girl singer complains about him. He talks to Annie. Philippe wants to become the most famous high wire walker. They become friends. Then he meets Jean-Louis, another friend. He wants to learn more from Papa Rudy. Check the rigging yourself. Philippe practices.

Then he performs over a lake in a small town. He sees the towers of Notre Dame and runs a wire for a public performance (this is illegal). This is not appreciated in France, but in other countries. They fly to Manhattan and view the WTC, which are still being completed. He travels to the top, then looks down. Its impossible, but Ill do it. How can they get the wire across? He is advised to use a safety line; it cant be seen from below. He refuses. A bow and arrow will take fishing line across the void. They prepare for the event. He reconnoitered every day. Its 140 feet between the Towers. But he steps on a nail! He uses crutches. He is recognized by a man who works in the North Tower for a life insurance company. Are they the only ones who parlez Franais in Manhattan? They plan the operation well. The carrots are cooked. Is he under stress? The van takes the equipment to the Towers. Can they use the elevators? They talk their way to the top floor.

They hide when they hear a voice. They are three hours behind schedule now. The arrow and fishing line are retrieved successfully. A wire provides secure communication. The rope is passed to the next tower. Then the rope breaks and the cable falls! They must pull up the heavy cable before daylight. They do, and tighten the cable. A man walks to the top, then leaves. Who was he? Philippe puts on his shoes and grabs the balancing pole to begin his walk. Down below the city begins work. Hes doing it! [Note how the wire is stabilized.] People cheer in the street below. Then he walks back to the South Tower.

The police arrived, Philippe turns around and walks back. Police arrive at the North Tower. Now he has to stay on the wire. Unbelievable! The Port Authority Police helicopter orders him to leave, hes breaking over a hundred ordinances. He thanks the police for their patience. The wire shakes for added drama! Shows over and he is arrested. The workmen applaud as Philippe is led away. The Press interviews him. The judge names his punishment. [This is the same day Nixon resigned.] This is world-wide news. Philippe remains in New York, Annie returned to France. He received a lifetime pass to the Observation Deck.

This story is based on actual events but characters and dialogue were fictionalized for dramatic effect. And they did an excellent job! This happened over forty years ago, most people alive today weren't born then. The World Trade Center was built after tearing down many small businesses that were destroyed by eminent domain to create a large office complex.",1459123200,,3452,4.507987220447284

7454422,5,B01603ANBQ,"Never Have I seen a more suspenseful thrilling movie as ""The Walk"". Very few movies totally capture me as a viewer like ""The Walk"" has. And even though I remember the famous stunt pulled off by one determined Frenchman in 1974 in New York City I still found myself caught up in the story. Even though I knew what happened and what the outcome was of the event that took place the movie kept me glued to the screen in anticipation of what was going to occur next. And for a time that Frenchman, Philippe Petit,  would capture the hearts and admirations of Americans everywhere when it was all over.

For those close to my age might remember what happened. But for those who were not around in 1974 or may have forgotten just what happened here is a brief synopsis. Philippe Petit was a French acrobatic could ride a unicycle and juggle and came to specialize in tightrope walking. In remember that day in August of 1974 and what Petit did the film starts by looking back on the life of Philippe who started as a performer on the streets of Paris. As his passion and talent for wire walking grew the scale of the stunts he wanted to attempted grew as well. Then one day while sitting in the waiting room of a local dentist to have a broken tooth repaired Petit read a magazine article about a pair of new towers being built in New York City. It would become the tallest building in the world and as he read it Petit felt a sudden urge to want to string a high wire between the two towers and walk across it. It became in a lot of ways an obsession. He started drawing in people he knew or would meet along the way to help in the plot Petit was conjuring up. It was a gradual plan as they looked at all the angles. They knew there would be no approval let along co-operation on the local government's part. So it became a kind of covert operation as they started thinking through what they would have to do.

Once they started coming over to the United States Petit, his girlfriend and the rest began looking to recruit Americans who could and would assist them in their plans. This is where the movie get interesting. You couldn't drag up 110 stories all the equipment that would be needed to pull off the stunt. With the help of the Americans that had come on board to assist Petit set up this operation it was all starting to come together as the Twin Towers was coming close to completion. And that is where the story is to this film. All the work that went into helping make one French acrobat's dream come to fruition. The actual walk across the Twin Towers by Philippe is amazing (and the special effects used during this part of the film is spectacular). But it is the planning and covert actions of everyone to make ""The Walk"" happen that draws the viewer in with suspense and wonder as to what will happen next. In the end it doesn't matter if you remember or not what happened on August 7, 1974 or even if you hadn't been born yet. This is one movie that will capture you. And if you are a movie buff then this is DVD (or Blu-ray) you need to add to your collection.

Finally I just want to say this really isn't just about Philippe Petit's high wire act across the World Trade Center on that day. It is a tribute to the Twin Towers themselves. Unfortunately for all of us the memory we will always carry for the World Trade Center is from the horrendous occurrence on 9/11 when a terrorist act brought the towers down. But with ""The Walk"" we have something much more beautiful and amazing  to remember it by. There are moments in the movie where you see actual newsreel footage as the buildings are being constructed. It gives us a chance to remember when the towers went up instead of coming down. So don't just watch this movie for the story about Philippe. Watch it also in loving memory to a couple of towers that at one time were the tallest in the world and captured the imagination of people worldwide.",1458864000,2,3918,4.332425068119891

7454433,2,B01603ANBQ,"I picked up this film along with ""Everest"" to show off our new 4K 3D TV to a visiting friend. We watched ""Everest"" first and we all loved it - a phenomal 3D experience with great acting and tons of real emotion. ""The Walk"" however really falls short, especially after ""Everest"" set the bar so high. Oddly, this film got better reviews - something I still can't understand. It looks nice, they used their budget on costumes, sets and special effects quite well, and if you're going watch it, 3D is the way to go - but it's not nearly as immersive as ""Everest"" with all of its snow and beautiful landscapes. Not to mention, the main character narrates the whole story, sometimes to the point where it sounds like he's explaining what's going on to a brain dead viewer - it's just as annoying as someone talking throughout the whole thing. Let the work of the actors, director and countless talented people speak for itself - all the narration kept taking me out of the film and ruining the little bit of tension and emotion present. Overall, it's a fun 3D popcorn flick - but I say borrow a copy from a friend, it's probably not something you'll watch twice, and you're not missing out if you don't watch it at all. For anyone with the patience to do a little Googling, there are live-action 3D films of much higher quality than this: ""Everest"", ""The Martian"" and ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" to name a few...not to mention the large amount of animated films that got GORGEOUS 3D treatments like ""The Lion King"", ""Beauty and the Beast"", ""Tangled"", ""Kung Fu Panda""...I could go on for days.",1458172800,2,1579,4.524475524475524

Without ever mentioning the tragic day to someday befall the magnificent towers (according to the protagonist), you get to share in the joy that a comes from the act of giving life to something. From the myopic lense my generation views New York- for whom our parents had not yet finished High School when the towers were built, and some 15 years before we were born- it is an experience to feel something other than sadness for those brief moments in time.

1. Terrible Acting-  Bad casting job. Levitt is usually a decent actor but anyone who has seen him in past works the french accent just wasn't working for me. Basically all american actors with lousy french accents.

2. Painfully Uneventful - I never laughed, smiled, frowned, jumped, or reacted in any way to any scene. They made this movie about as undramatic as possible.

Finally, this film seemed to be in incredibly bad taste. People dived from this height when WTC came down on 9/11.

Granted it is only based on a true story so they could have used some artistic licence and ended it in a different way.  I also wondered if other than the actual walking on the tightrope scenes, if there would be much to hold my interest preceding that.  To be honest as soon as it started and Joseph Gordon-Levitt starts talking in English in a Looney Tunes cartoon heavy fake French shouting every word accent, I had my doubts.  But if you can live with that, it's not a bad movie.  Sure they justify speaking English for the most of it by Phillipe telling off everyone else to speak in English to practice for when they are walking between the towers (when in fact he doesn't speak at all while out on the cable) and things like this but that's okay.  I don't know how much of the pre towers scenes (which is most of the movie) are true and what are pure fiction but they were entertaining enough.  I was disappointed that they left out the whole trip to Australia where before New York Phillipe practiced his firing across and stringing up a cable in somewhere he wasn't supposed to, when he cable walked across two towers of the Sydney Harbour Bridge.  This movie sort of implies other than between the towers of the Notre Dame, the first time he really risked his life up any great height was the Twin Towers Walk.

The Walk also nicely reminds, that The World Trade Center towers were significant and had a dominant presence in New York, were a place many visited, besides the footage of what happened to them after the two planes hit that probably immediately comes to mind whenever they are mentioned.",1456444800,2,1799,4.413897280966768

7454494,5,B01603ANBQ,"This film is based on the true story of Philippe Petit's amazing feat of August 7th 1974 to walk for almost an hour on a cable strung between the Twin Towers of Manhattan. It's a peaceful, non violent thriller, a wonderful achievement of storytelling by director Robert Zemeckis, describing how Petit grew up, how he became fixed with the Twin Towers and how he got his amazing skills with the crucial help of an old Czech circus wire walker. Every fascinating detail is included: the original dream, the meticulous planning, the ""reconnaissance"" work done for eight months in New York, the technical and practical problems of rigging a wire between tall buildings, the unforeseen factors that almost led to failure. Petit was balancing on a rope in the full sense of the phrase, being almost maniac about his purpose. Especially the part where Petit finally walks on the wire early in the morning, 110 stories above the ground, is really breathtaking! He made the walk five times back and forth, he kneeled, he even laid on his back on the wire (!), he had a casual encounter with a curious and rather aggressive seagull, and he was finally arrested by policemen who were themselves astonished by his daring feat. The film is terrific in all aspects. The photography is nothing short of magical, and the directing is excellent. It doesnt tell though the whole truth about the reason that Petit's French girlfriend abandoned him straight after his amazing achievement  Petit, swept away by his unbelievable success in Manhattan, had sex with a completely stranger girl, destroying his long relationship with his devoted and caring French girlfriend. Watch and enjoy this film, which proves for one more time that reality far surpasses fantasy. It's trully unforgettable...",1456272000,2,1772,5.0067796610169495

I made it through 45 minutes and then had to turn it off.  I don't like films where the character comes out of the story line to address the viewer...I just don't.  It drove me absolutely crazy.

I remember vaguely when this happened. But never really knew the story.
It comes to life here with great human emotion, adventure.
Gordon-Levitt doesn't get in the way of the main character, letting us go with
the flow of the story, meeting those in his life who help carry him along to this
amazing life he has had.
It's a great ride!

adventurous life.",1455580800,,515,4.5978260869565215

7454519,5,B01603ANBQ,"This movie has been overlooked by mainstream audiences, but I think it is one of the best films of 2015. The premise sounds sorta dull, but it kept my interest the entire time. It has the methodical pacing that the movie Titanic had. And like that film, it has a little bit of every genre in it. There is humor. There is romance. At some point the movie turns into a heist film. Then it turns into a suspense film as the main character steps out onto the wire. I saw the movie in 3D at the theater, and I held my breath through most of the scenes at the top of the World Trade Center. I've since watched it at home in 2D, and the tension is only minimally lessened. One of the best parts of the film are the special effects. The World Trade Center is so realistically created that you would never suspect you are watching computer generated imagery. I hope more people discover this gem of a film.",1455494400,2,897,4.22093023255814
7454520,5,B01603ANBQ,"This is a great film and I will be buying myself a copy of the bluray (we rented the bluray last night). It's fun, funny, beautifully filmed, well acted, and keeps you watching the whole way through. Even though you know he's going to ultimately do the walk, getting there is really fun and the walk itself has several surprises.

I have to say that it's hard to watch this film on a big screen (even a big screen TV) if you are scared of heights. We did not get the 3D version and I was still often tensing up whenever characters would get too close to the edge of a building, for fear of falling over. Even though I knew the actor likely walked on a green screen floor and all the height footage was likely added later, it looked quite realistic. Very well done effects.

The film has heart and it's more about the characters than the effects. It's rare that you could say ANYONE would like a film, but I think it applies here. Enjoy!",1455494400,,936,4.252808988764045

7454533,3,B01603ANBQ,"If you've seen the documentary you're likely to prefer it over this dramatized version of the same story starring a number of Americans playing French people. I love Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and his French is excellent while his French-accented English is a little over-the-top. Compound that with more Americans pretending to have French accents, and it feels cheesy. The computer-generated backdrop of 1970s lower Manhattan and special effects, however are incredibly realistic -- so much so that you'll clench when you see the height from the wire and wonder when the captured this high-res footage of the twin towers! If you haven't seen the documentary, Man on Wire, watch this first and be entertained, then watch the documentary.",1455062400,6,733,5.273504273504273

While the movie leaves out much of what happened, it is very well done technically.  Even in 2D, you can feel as if you are 100 stories up in the air and in great peril.  In that regard, this movie does what Everest did not.

The lead up to the walk itself is whimsical and may be a little slow but it is not annoying.  Rounding up a bunch of strangers to commit illegal and dangerous acts with you takes some doing and a little explanation.

I was not familiar with Phillip Pettit or his story about his walk between the towers as I was too young at the time that it happened but I am glad that I watched this as this movie was far better than I had imagined it would be.  I initially was a bit skeptical at American born Joseph Gordon-Levitt playing the Frenchman Pettit but as the movie went along, I found him very believable and likeable in the role.  The story is well done and entertaining throughout with great pacing and energy.  I would almost describe the story as intense, not because it is a drama filled story but because of the beautifully shot scenes.  I am scared of heights and the realistic feel of the high wire scenes along with an appropriate music soundtrack had me on the edge of my seat.  The music created the perfect atmosphere for this 110 story experience.  In a way, this is almost a tribute to the towers as much as the man and it is beautifully done and worth watching.

7454655,5,B01603ANBQ,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

A few years ago I wrote about an amazing documentary called MAN ON WIRE. It was the story of Philippe Petit, a tightrope walker from France who planned a top secret and illegal event by stringing a wire from one of the twin towers to the other and walking across. The movie was fascinating to watch but as with most documentaries, though well received, not a huge box office success. Apparently director Robert Zemekis felt that it was a great story as well, enough so that he has turned it into a box office smash theatrical film, THE WALK.

Joseph Gordon-Levitt stars as Philippe, a man with a dream. As narrator of the film from start to finish, he tells the tale of his fascination with high wire walkers from childhood on. He watches their every move and attempts to teach himself as much as possible. Only able to go so far, he sneaks into a circus tent to try out their wire and is caught by the owner, Papa Rudy (Ben Kingsley). While he is stopped for the day, he works his way into Papas good graces and begins to learn the real art of walking the wire.

To earn a living Philippe works as a street entertainer, stringing up his rope from one item to another so he can walk across, juggle and entertain any gathering crowd he could summon up with his antics. Not only did it provide him with a means to live it also introduced him to someone special, Annie (Charlotte Le Bon). His performance steals away the crowd she had built as a street singer. The two become involved and Philippe shares with Annie the dream he discovered earlier.

While working the street he injured one of his teeth and had to go to a dentist. While sitting in a chair in the waiting room to be seen he looks at a magazine and discovers a new structure being erected in New York City. It is the Twin Towers, the worlds largest skyscrapers at the time they will be opened. He tears the page of the towers from the magazine and his dream of walking from one to the other begins.

There are numerous problems that must be surmounted before Philippe can make his dream come true, the first being that doing so is illegal and he could end up in jail. There is the construction of the wire to be used, the exact building of which can and will determine if he lives or dies while walking. There are extra people to involve to help him transport equipment, set it up and to film the event. He does indeed set up his team and with passports in hand they head for America. This is the second trip for Philippe as he scoped out the sight previously. Now is the moment of truth.

While much of the movie is the build up to this event it is lighthearted in many moments as we get there. But once the event itself begins, from the moment they begin to sneak their equipment into the building to the final walk he takes, it becomes a mind blowing spectacle to behold and not one for the faint of heart nor those with acrophobia. Any and all will be amazed to witness the sheer brilliance of director Zemekis use of special effects to make it seem as real as possible. Even knowing in the back of your mind that this had to have been done using CGI (computer generated images) since the towers no longer exist you still believe what you are seeing. It has been done that good.

There is no spoiler that can be made with this movie. Since it is based on an actual event you know the outcome already. And yet while watching you still have a sense of unease that permeates every pore of your body. If you're someone whose palms sweat during tense moments in movie be prepared. This one will have not just your palms but your feet and forehead dripping with moisture as well.

Gordon-Levitt has had an interesting career. Some will remember him as the teen yet oldest member of a crew of aliens on the TV series THIRD ROCK FROM THE SUN. Others will know him from his more recent work like BRICK, INCEPTION and LOOPER. One thing is certain, he has grown up to be a more accomplished actor than many child actors have in the past. With each movie he seems to get better and better and that shows here. For myself I would think an Oscar nomination would be in order but chances are more wordy roles will find themselves there. The supporting cast does an equally fantastic job but it is Levitt who stands out.

Special kudos are in store for the directors of cinematography Dariusz Wolski who previously took us on pirate adventures in the Caribbean (all three films) as well as the special effects teams that made this film a reality. Ive heard that in 3-D the film was something to behold but I can assure you that in regularformat it will still have you clinging to the arms of your chair as you walk out with Philippe on that wire. While explosions and spaceships may get the attention the effects used here for me outshine them all.

One thing of note with this film. For myself, when Philippe gets his first glimpse of the Twin Towers I felt a lump in my throat. The fall of both towers still feels like a fresh scab that gets pulled whenever I see footage of them, real or otherwise. I can only imagine the feeling the real Philippe Petit gets when he sees where they once stood. It gets easier as the film progresses but remains sore at least for me. Still, this movie is one that everyone should make a point of seeing. The movie leaves you with a sense of wonder and joy. It is one of my favorite films to be released last year and one I know I will visit again. My guess is you will as well.",1453334400,,5519,4.313404050144648

7454672,5,B01603ANBQ,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  Taken at face value it's a highly entertaining story.  But after viewing this I became very curious about this story and started doing a bit of research.  I simply couldn't believe that some of the events that this movie portrayed actually occurred.  The 2008 documentary ""Man On Wire"" tells this story through personal accounts of the people involved, including the wire walker himself, Philippe Petit.  To my amazement most of the scenes in ""The Walk"" actually happened in real life.  After finding this out I developed an ever greater appreciation for this film, it didn't take as much creative license as I thought it did.  If you enjoy this film I strongly urge you to watch ""Man On Wire"", it's a terrific documentary about this fascinating achievement.

Joseph Gordon Levitt did a terrific job as the completely obsessed Philippe Petit, he simply had to walk between these towers.  The rest of the cast did an admirable job as well.  But for me the star of this film was the imagery of the twin towers.  It's as if they were still standing there and were filmed in HD.  Many people say that seeing this in 3D was an incredible experience and I can completely see why.  Even the way I saw it without 3D it was stunning and actually an emotional experience.  While those towers were on screen, they were for that brief amount of time, real.  Congratulations to those that did the visual effects for this film because they are truly spectacular and a wonderful tribute to the memory of these American landmarks.

In summary this movie is part comedy, part caper, and part deadly serious when the finale arrives at 110 stories in the sky.  I enjoyed it thoroughly and recommend it without reservation.",1453075200,2,1737,4.736666666666666

7454682,3,B01603ANBQ,I would have given this 5 stars if it weren't for a lot of terrible ghosting throughout the movie but especially in darker scenes. I own over 100 3d blurays and have only seen ghosting a few times for a few scenes in a few titles. This is with an Epson 5030ub projector. Good movie that could really be enhanced in 3d but the ghosting kinda ruined it for me. Just watched The Martian in 3d & it was outstanding with NO ghosting so it's not my equipment.

7454708,5,B01603ANBQ,"From the moment I saw the movie trailer in theaters, I knew I had to see 'The Walk', and in 3D, only 3D. And boy, did it not disappoint.

 THE FILM 
The story is about a Frenchman who becomes fascinated with tight-rope walking since he was a child. As he grew up he wanted to go bigger, bolder, and higher. His ultimate dream becomes wanting to tight-rope walk the (then) newly-built Twin Towers in New York Cityhis artistic statement to the world. The first two thirds of the movie sets up all the pieces that would come to make this happen, and the final third act pays off tremendously. Thinking and writing about this third act gives me goosebumps. There is about 20 spectacular minutes of *sustained* tension and suspense that will give you goosebumps and leave you on the edge of your seat wondering if you can handle anymore (like, I can't even). It makes you wonder if this man is incredibly brave, or incredibly stupid. History would come to know it as the ""artistic crime of the century"".

 3D 
The Walk was shot in 2D that went through a near-flawless 3D conversion. Even though it was shot in 2D it's necessary to watch this only in 3D (if you can), because it was *designed* for 3D viewing. The high-wire walking makes for a perfect 3D translation. You don't get gimmicky shots; all the shots were planned out from the start. The telling of the story and the camera movements have taken 3D into mind, and the use of depth is dazzling, with the occasional object hurtling at the screen that'll actually make you duck a few times. Seeing it on the small screen (55"" for me) is not as vertigo-inducing as one might think. A bad 3D movie conversion can leave you feeling nauseated. I can honestly say I was expecting some dizziness, but I got none, I just had a fun time.

 CINEMATOGRAPHY 
When you watch a Robert Zemekis film, you will get impeccable cinematography. Compositions are gorgeous, shots are creative. Technically, they are perfection. My issue is, it's *too* perfect a lot of the times, especially the perfect and impossible shots; it partially detracts from the movie. I appreciate all the technicality that goes into these shots, but at the same time, they also take you a little bit out of the movie. Sometimes you can be too perfect, is what I'm saying.

This is a great film, with a very likeable main character, presented in 3D for your viewing experienceand it is an experience. Recommended!

7454712,2,B01603ANBQ,"I avoided seeing this and should have trusted my instinct. It's biopic by numbers with very ordinary storytelling and character introductions. The most frustrating part of the movie is the constant narration throughout. Joseph's character is on a green screen, I mean, the Statue of Liberty and narrates the entire movie. So not only do we have to have the ordinary story being interrupted by narration, we need to cut back to the same green screen set over and over. Although the story is a very traditional biopic with Ocean's Eleven sprinkled it and is very by the book, I still wanted to see the story unfold. Perhaps even see these solid actors perform, but nope, I had to constantly be pulled out of the story to here the story being told by the story teller. Here's a wild idea for a movie, let the moving pictures tell the story, let's not have a narrator direct the story. The narration was also very unnecessary as it interrupted conventional story moments like the planning for the caper which was very easily understood by what we were seeing on the screen, but yet the narration had to interrupt and tell us exactly what we're seeing on the screen. Scenes showed Phillipe taking pictures of the guards performing their rounds, cut to Phillipe narration saying that he took pictures of the guards performing their rounds. This happened constantly even in the supposedly ""great"" glamour shots of the tight rope act which was captured in high def resolution so you can clearly see that its on a green screened back lot. Although with proper sound design and moodiness I could've forgotten all this until the damned narration kicked in again describing all the feelings he was feeling. I prefer to have the actor emote his feelings, not a narrator tell me his feelings, this isn't a book - it's a movie. The music was also very sappy and the romance was very contrived and made the whole affair a cheese-fest. I would not recommend this movie.",1452384000,2,1952,4.7105263157894735
7454713,5,B01603ANBQ,"In 1971 my parents gave me a birthday present of taking the Circle Line cruise around Manhattan.  I remember the Twin Towers when they were about two thirds finished.  In 1997 I went to the roof of the South Tower with some visiting cousins.  I didn't get nearly as close to the edge where the movie dwells but I saw the same view Petit saw; the corner to corner expanse between the Towers.  When you have a structure nearby to give the height scale to your eye the drop is kind of overwhelming (just look at the DVD cover). The wire walk even crossed my mind at the time because I remember when it happened.

Sure, the accents might miss a little on the American actors but you can roll with it.  It's fascinating how a shoestring effort with some focused research and an immense amount of belief and determination could pull off, and I think the film gets there in the end.  You can feel and appreciate the will of Petit by the time he gets on the wire because there is no other way it could have happened.",1452384000,9,1008,4.273684210526316

7454721,5,B01603ANBQ,"Obviously Phillippe Petit  the high wire walker who walked between the twin towers of the World Trade Center in 1974  did not have acrophobia (fear of heights). Now, me, I have it and  for that reason did not see the film in a movie theater (let alone in 3-D where it was shown in some areas). I knew the actual walk would only take a small portion of the running time of this 123 minute film and I figured I could skip over that portion on the DVD. As it turns out, watching it on a TV (even a 42 one (like I have) is not a problem. Yes, Director Robert Zemeckis does a nice job of using CGI to create the walk, but I didn't feel dizzy. The other thing is that  even though I HATE spoilers nearly everyone (and certainly those who remember when the walk made the papers do) know that Petit did not fall so the real suspense here is watching Petit and his accomplices get the equipment to the roofs of the towers without being caught.

The package of the BD (and DVD) tout Zemeckis as the Director of Forrest Gump and Cast Away. This surprised me because I thought the CGI effects more resembled his first major film Back To The Future.  He also has a great touch for using color and (near the beginning) black and white images.

There was an earlier documentary on Petit (Man on the Wire) which I have not seen. But even that did not have a lot of footage of the actual walk  and certainly not from the top of the buildings). So it falls on Zemeckis to re-create the walk using CGI.

I really liked this film.

The BD (and the DVD, I think) come with some nice bonus features  though short.

There are a few deleted scenes (5 minutes total) and another 8-minute one showing how Petit trained the actor who plays him (Joseph Gordon-Levit) how to walk on a wire. There is a featurette called Pillars of Support which runs about 8-minutes and shows comments from the actors playing Petits accomplices. Finally there is a 10-minute feature showing how Zemeckis filmed the central scene.  These will add interest for those interested in how did they film that?

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

7454725,4,B01603ANBQ,"""The coup has begun. My life is no longer in my control."" Philippe Petit (Gordon-Levitt) is a tight rope walker who doesn't do anything small. After being told he can't do something he makes it his goal to accomplish the feat. He begins my showing his skills in the streets of France, then to the Notre Dame cathedral. When he sees a picture his life, and the world is changed. Philippe enlists a group of men to help him accomplish his dream, to hang a wire between the twin towers in New York and walk across it. This is not a typical biopic if that's what you are looking for. This deals with a specific event in someones life. The most amazing thing about this movie is that it doesn't have to embellish the actual events because there is enough drama on its own. If you don't think a movie about a man walking on a tight rope can be tense and exciting I challenge you to say that after watching this. The movie itself is really good and I liked it, but this is one of the most visually striking movies I think I have ever seen. The way the movie is filmed it really makes it easy to feel what he is feeling and you really get the sense of the danger he is up against.

7454730,5,B01603ANBQ,"The Walk is the story of Philippe Petit, the French high wire artist who in 1973 was determined to walk a wire between the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center, still under construction at the time. Since this was clearly against the law, the stunt required intricate, methodical planning, assistants, and a rigid time plan. So many things could go wrong during the lead-up to the walk that it seemed an impossible goal.

Director Robert Zemeckis (Back to the Future, Forrest Gump) takes us through the eventual feat that captured headlines worldwide and made Petit a folk hero.

The early part of the film takes place in France, where we first see Petit (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) performing as a street mime and juggler. Whenever possible, he sets up a wire and walks it to the delight of audiences that gather, spellbound. It is in Paris that he first sees pictures of what the World Trade Center will look like and immediately becomes obsessed with stringing a wire between the North and South Towers and walking across. This would be the ultimate wire walk.

Planning is critical. He seeks the expertise of veteran tightrope artist Papa Rudy (Ben Kingsley), who explains the intricacies of safety and relates trade secrets hes guarded his whole life, seeing in Philippe the potential and resolve to pull off what seems an impossible feat. When Philippe meets attractive singer Annie (Charlotte LeBon), she soon becomes his girlfriend and accomplice.

Philippe begins assembling the necessary equipment and rounding up assistants, first in France and later in New York. With the cunning of bank robbers casing a job, they assume disguises and pose variously as workers and officials to get into the buildings, take measurements, and lay out their plan.

Most impressive in The Walk is its incredible re-creation, through computer-generated imagery, of the Towers in all their nascent glory. Director Zemeckis has filmed the walk from many angles, just as if it were a traditional movie. We soon become totally transported to the early 1970s as we witness the suspenseful organization and execution of one of the most fantastic capers ever attempted.

Too many films these days are shot in 3D more to milk a few extra bucks from audiences than to truly enhance content. With The Walk, however, the 3D is of the essence, and if you have the chance to see it in IMAX, all the better. The 3D gives us birds eye views and a visceral feeling for the height of the Towers and the distance between them and the exhilaration and danger as if were up there on the wire with Philippe.

Gordon-Levitt as Petit is on-screen narrator bridging sequences and commenting on the step-by-step planning, setbacks, disappointments, lucky breaks, and amazing coincidences that made the walk possible. He speaks in French occasionally but usually switches to English, stating that hes practicing for when he goes to New York. This convenient excuse avoids excessive subtitles. The actor conveys the charm of Petit, his obsession that drew in others enthusiastic to see his stunt succeed, and his often maddening failure to acknowledge the contributions of his hard-working, law-defying team.

To look proficient as a wire artist, Gordon-Levitt trained with Petit himself. In only a week, he mastered enough technique to balance and move gracefully and safely across a wire  albeit from a much lower position.

Rated PG, The Walk, based on the documentary Man on Wire, would have been impossible before the development of computer-generated imagery. The director uses this ability to breathtaking effect, inspiring us to wonder and marvel at the daring of one mans vision.

The 2-Disc edition contains 3D Blu-ray and standard Blu-ray versions as well as a digital HD copy. Bonus extras include deleted scenes, and the featurettes The Amazing Walk, First Steps - Learning to Walk the Wire, and Pillars of Support. To watch the movie in 3D, a 3D HDTV, Blu-ray 3D player or Playstation 3, compatible 3D glasses, and high speedHDMI cable are required. The Walk is also available in single-disc standard Blu-ray and DVD editions.",1451692800,3,4101,5.025036818851252
7454731,4,B01603ANBQ,"A wonderful true story

I have to confess from the beginning that Man on Wire, the documentary version of this story, is one of my favorite films (if I could give it 6 stars, I would), so it was a little bit difficult for me to put the first film out of my mind or not to compare them.  What I liked about this film was that for it was true to the story  and had the same positive message that the book, To Reach the Clouds and the film Man on Wire have.  Also, the special effects were great - especially the 3D presentation and the tribute to New York and to the Twin Towers.  Also, I thought Joe Gordon-Levitt worked hard to give the best representation of Philippe that he could - in terms of Philippe's personality and his optimism and determination.  Joe also learned to walk on the wire by himself, which I thought was wonderful.  The only thing in his performance that distracted me a little bit was the very strong accent - a little bit like D'artagnan in Disney's Three Musketeers :)  I saw some interviews with Philippe, even from the 1970s, when he just recently moved to New York - but I don't think he ever had that kind of accent.  Another thing that was that the pace of this film seemed a little bit rushed compared to the documentary and some of the friends who were in the documentary were missing from this film.  What I liked in the documentary were the real human emotions of Philippe and his friends, but in this film it's more action and more of the walk itself and a little less of the feelings.  But overall I thought this is a very good film and I believe Philippe himself really liked it, which is wonderful :)  If I could make a recommendation, I would recommend this film and also Man on Wire for comparison, as well as the book, To Reach the Clouds (also released as Man on Wire and the Walk) - I thought they were each great in their own way.  I also really like the footage of actual walks that Philippe did in New York, at St. John's Cathedral and in Frankfurt -that is available on youtube.  Philippe's real performances are wonderful to watch - I wish there was a documentary that had more of his performances, but maybe that will come one day in the future :)",1451606400,,2196,4.2729468599033815

7454737,3,B01603ANBQ,"The amazing story of French high-wire artiste Philippe Petit is damn near impossible to screw up. It's simply that incredible, such a sterling example of the feats human beings are physically and mentally capable of. To say his story is perfectly made for the cinematic experience would be an understatement, and it made for a great documentary in James Marsh's Oscar-nominated Man on Wire just a few years ago. Robert Zemeckis is a director known as a standard-bearer in the field of visual effects but little else, and he very nearly screwed up Petit's triumphant feat with his 3D IMAX spectacle, The Walk. It's a film that struggles to find its balance for far too long, but when it does the results are transcendent.

Joseph Gordon-Levitt takes on the role and French accent of Petit, a brash, arrogant tightrope walker whose dream is probably a lot bigger than yours. In 1974 Petit accomplished the unimaginable feat of walking a high-wire across the World Trade Center Towers. That's 110 stories up, in the middle of bustling New York City at a time when the people weren't so fond of those two gigantic skyscrapers. But that's the end of the story, and the film actually begins much earlier with Petit as a street performer struggling to get by despite his overwhelming ability and confidence. An aggravating framing sequence has Petit, sitting atop the Statue of Liberty no less, narrating each step of his journey. It slows down what is already a burdensome origin in which he has a meet-cute with fellow entertainer Annie (Charlotte Le Bon), and gets tightrope-walking tips from Papa Rudy (Ben Kingsley). Always looking for a new place to hang his wire, Petit discovers his incredible life's dream when he chances on a magazine article about the Twin Towers.

What made Man on Wire such an unforgettable documentary was that it maintained all of the hallmarks of a great heist movie. There were teams assembled with members of various professions and strengths, all collaborators in Petit's mad and very illegal scheme. That fear of getting caught and going to jail was a very real thing, but Zemeckis and co-writer Christopher Browne fail to capture that anxious energy. Instead the tone lacks any seriousness in the planning stages, and Petit's co-conspirators aren't given much to do. That's a shame when the group consists of talented actors like Le Bon, Kingsley, James Badge Dale, and Ben Schwartz. Levitt does a good job capturing Petit's spirited, mercurial temperament, although his French accent takes some getting used to.

The mood shifts noticeably once Petit arrives in the U.S., but the film doesn't actually begin to soar until he's up on the Tower roof.  The film evolves into something glorious, as if Zemeckis deliberately kept the earlier stuff a little flat so as to make the actual walk across the wire truly special. This is one case where it's absolutely essential to pay the extra money for 3D, as you'll be mesmerized by the dizzying, vertigo-inducing heights. With every step more dangerous than the last, every one of Petit's theatrical flourishes an act of pure daring, this is as terrifying and exhilarating as movies get. The greatest compliment that one can give Zemeckis is that his recreation of Petit's performance is as thrilling as what we saw in Man on Wire. For a while you totally forget this is a visual effects creation and that Levitt is actually quite safe. You can't help but tremble with every move, and have your breath taken away with every sweeping panoramic view of the city below.

What's lacking is Petit's motivation, or the motivation in others to support him on what must have looked like a fool's errand. There just doesn't appear to be much interest in the inspiration behind Petit's feat, just the feat itself. In that case The Walk is every bit like a showman who dares to dazzle the audience but won't bore them with the details.",1448323200,4,3899,4.874811463046757
7454738,5,B01603ANBQ,"Theatrical Review:  I vividly remember as a boy growing up in Boston the news reports and incredible New York Times front page pictures of Philippe Petit on a high wire between the Twin Towers. After thoroughly enjoying the 2008 documentary Man On Wire when it came out, I wasn't sure what to expect from a Hollywood version of Petit's incredible walk between the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center on August 7, 1974. What could another film with a bigger budget possibly add to the story?

One word review of The Walk: Stunning. Director Robert Zemeckis (Back to the Future, Forrest Gump, Contact, Cast Away), Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Petit and a great supporting cast and crew have lovingly crafted a film which both honors the true story and lifts your spirit into the clouds of boundless imagination and dreams reached for and realized. Petit's feet-first feat ranks as one of the most amazing achievements by an individual in history. To dream of such a seemingly impossible feat; meticulously plan and engineer it over many years; assemble the team to covertly help pull it off and then physically lead that team in rigging the heavy steel cable all night and then, to top it all off---crossing over into the mutant mischievous friendly alien zen zone---to actually walk and even dance with both feet airborne at times on that wire for 45 minutes 110 stories above the street with fearless precision, acrobatic grace and no safety harness or net...? NO F***ING WAY!! (in case you're wondering, that's French for ""otherworldly"" :))

The walk itself is gorgeously filmed and simply breathtaking. It's like the long-lost footage from Petit's GoPro has been rediscovered--you feel like you're right there on the wire with him, so much so that you'll likely find yourself holding tight to your armrests or the person you came with (as I did). The incredible artistry and realism of these scenes alone makes the film a must-see. The Walk beautifully illustrates what I call the DPD formula: Dream. Plan. DO. As I've told everyone I know, run--don't walk--to see this film. It's a stunningly presented story of a remarkable man who truly Walks His Talk.",1448236800,5,2154,4.912087912087912

There is a lot about ""The Walk"", the new film from director Robert Zemeckis, that shouldn't really work. And maybe it doesn't. It sure doesn't seem to for much of the film. But once 'The Walk' happens, all of those complaints, misgivings, doubts quickly fall away, cascading down 110 stories.

Based on the life of Philippe Petit, a Frenchman obsessed with tightrope walking and theatricality, ""The Walk"" concentrates on Petit's plans and execution of his dream to walk between the north and south towers of the newly built World Trade Center in 1974 New York.

If this sounds familiar, you probably saw the highly acclaimed documentary ""Man on Wire"" released a few years ago. Featuring archival footage and interviews with Petit and some of his cohorts, ""Man on Wire"" is perhaps most effective at painting a portrait of the aerialist's obsession. It is a great documentary and should not be missed.

It seems like every other film director Robert Zemeckis does is geared towards advancing or creating a new technique for his toolbox. Then, he sometimes uses that new tool and makes an interesting new film. Zemeckis has been playing with stop-motion capture technology for a while (""The Polar Express"" - which was good - and ""A Christmas Carol"" - which was much better, advancing the technology used in the first film) so it would seem he is now turning his attention to 3-D. Basically, Zemeckis seems to have a process. Create a film to test new technology then create a second film to use that new technique in a better way. Then, he moves on to a new idea.

Why create a fictionalized version of a story we have already seen? There are a number of reasons. Many people are more likely to see a big-budget studio release than a small, independently produced documentary, so there probably are a lot of people who will see ""The Walk"" who haven't seen ""Man on Wire"". Adding some biggish-name Hollywood actors will help to draw more people to this story. And the story is a terrific and unusual way for Zemeckis to play with 3-D technology and use it to both advance the technology and to tell the story in a way that makes sense.

When 3-D first appeared in theaters in the 50s, as a way of fighting the threat of television, filmmakers like Andre de Toth and Hitchcock experimented with the medium by creating stories designed to throw things at the audience (ping pong balls, knives, hands) to give them a feeling of being in the story. But the technique was too gimmicky and didn't last. The medium has been resurrected a few times, without much success. But the release of James Cameron's ""Avatar"" changed that forever. Now, it seems like every animated and every action/superhero film is released in 3-D. The new renaissance may already be waning - many new releases share one theater for both 3-D and regular screenings of the same film, flip-flopping with each showtime. And most live-action 3-D films are retrofitted in post, to create a 3-D print. These movies are usually not the greatest use of 3-D, but the studios continue with this, because they can charge a premium for the 3-D glasses and boost the film's revenue.

So when someone like Zemeckis decides they want to create a 3-D experience like ""The Walk"", you know most of the film is designed to be an experience that will grab you and make you remember it. It is a film that is meant to be seen in 3-D. In fact, if you can see it in IMAX 3-D, all the better.

But before we get to the actual 3-D elements of ""The Walk"", let's talk about everything leading up to that point.

Going in, you probably know what will happen during the climax of the film. Petit, played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, will walk a tightrope between the Twin Towers. This is why Zemeckis wants to make this film and why we should see the film, because this is the thing the documentary couldn't show us in such amazing detail because they didn't have unlimited cameras recording every detail.

But first, we have to get to that point.

And so much of the back story shouldn't work, parts of it don't work, and parts of it are annoying.

We meet Petit as he sits on another high landmark in New York City. He narrates the story, telling us about everything he is thinking. The lyrical, fanciful nature of this narrative is highlighted because of where Zemeckis places him and because he has Petit act as the narrator to his own story. Initially, this seems strange - you might expect the filmmaker to try to make everything seem hyperrealistic, to make The Walk all the more real and interesting. And to have Gordon-Levitt's Chevalier-esque accent telling the story, from a high vantage point, does nothing to help the story seem real and true. But this is exactly in keeping with the subject of the story. Petit seems to live in a fairy-tale bubble looking at everything through his childlike enthusiasm. He wants to walk a tightrope on top of Notre Dame? Why not. Then, when he first hears about the new skyscrapers New York, he believes they are the most beautiful creation, and the fact they are brand new, their height, everything, serves as a magnet to the French aerialist.

As he tells his story, we meet the other people in his life. Papa Rudy (Ben Kingsley), a Czech aerialist, takes Philippe under his wing and gives him guidance and advice throughout his career. Initially, he pleads with Philippe to get this crazy idea out of his head, but he quickly realizes that is impossible. Once Philippe sets his mind on something, he never lets it go. His girlfriend, Annie (Charlotte Le Bon, ""The Hundred Foot Journey"") is always at his side, ready and willing to support any crazy idea he comes up with. Jean-Louis (Clement Sibony, ""The Hundred Foot Journey"") is his most faithful friend, ready and eager to help Philippe with any dream. And they recruit Jeff (Cesar Domboy), who is eager to help, but afraid of heights. Once they work through every angle of the plan, they travel to New York, to put the details into motion. There, they meet JP (James Badge Dale, ""Flight"", ""The Lone Ranger""), a shop owner who happens to be French and wants to help and Barry Greenhouse (Steve Valentine, TV's ""Crossing Jordan"") who is a tenant in one of the towers and is all too willing to help.

This part of the film goes on forever and it becomes a little difficult to listen to Gordon-Levitt's constant narration. He is a bit too showy and full of himself. But this is sort of the point. Petit is showy and full of himself. When you decide you are going to walk between the Twin Towers at 110 stories, you would have to be.

And a strange thing happens. Once they begin to move their equipment into the Twin Towers, and prepare for The Walk, your anticipation begins to build. You know what is going to happen, but they run into obstacles, and have some hurdles to get over, before, you know, The Walk. This is Zemeckis telling us to get ready, something extraordinary is about to happen.

Then the time comes and Petit prepares himself for his first step on the impossibly thin wire to traverse such an expanse - so, so high up - between the towers. He sets one foot on the wire and you gasp, because you see the depth he could fall with the slightest misstep. This is the beauty of a director like Zemeckis - someone who is so invested in their craft that they want to expand the very vocabulary of the art, and the number of people who are willing and able to do this is small - Guillermo del Toro and Inarritu have done some exciting things recently, Spielberg still does this, but not as frequently - making a film like ""The Walk"". He uses CGI and 3-D technology to make you feel like you are stepping onto the wire with Petit. Any misstep he makes, you make. And because we have already spent so, so much time with him, listening to him chatter incessantly, we feel like we know this young, skinny, French blowhard. Every step he takes, we take.

And the entire sequence is why you go to the movies in the first place. You go to be transported - into another time, another place, another life. And let's face it - most films don't do this very well. But ""The Walk"" does this in spades.

Zemeckis shot the film for viewing in 3-D and it was released ten days early on IMAX and large format 3-D screens. I have been to many regular 3-D screenings and I have been to some IMAX 3-D screenings. The IMAX screen is bigger and brings out the detail, making it sharper and more defined. This helps the 3-D experience become even more pronounced and significant. In other words, Zemeckis really wants you to feel like you are walking the tightrope with Petit.

Coincidentally, the film is also a love letter to the Twin Towers. Because we see them frequently, as we watch Petit narrate the story from the Statue of Liberty, they seem real. And Petit chooses to walk between them because he thinks they are a beautiful architectural achievement - that, and their height - so this helps the story to paint a picture of how New Yorkers viewed these towers when they were first built. And much like getting to know Petit, we get to know the Towers, again, while always thinking about the horrible incidents that happened on 9/11.

Everything that shouldn't work, everything that doesn't work about this movie, helps to make ""The Walk"" a breathtaking film and an exciting experience.",1446508800,32,9322,4.5907451923076925

7454741,5,B01603ANBQ,"I saw Man on Wire, and was wondering why this story would be retold.  This is done in a totally different way.  It is completely mesmerizing.

From the outset, the lead character engages you.  I couldn't take my eyes off the screen (even though my stomach was doing flip flops when he was on top of the towers.  Note:  I purposely did not see this in 3D.  The right decision if you have any issues with height.)  The scenery is beautiful, full of character and depth, particularly the scenes filmed in the homes (ostensibly in Europe, but it apparently was filmed in Canada).

The story is told in a way that provides wonderful depth into the various ""co-conspirators"" in his project.  It is a unique story, interesting in many ways.  There is extensive planning, juxtaposed with spontaneity and the persistence to continue despite ridiculous odds, and challenges met along the way.

Joseph Gordon-Levitt is terrific, as is Ben Kingsley.

I was disturbed that the first film did not acknowledge the tragedy of the twin towers.  There is a subtle and ironic homage paid in the final scene of this film, which is not only appropriate, but beautifully done.

Don't miss this film.

We know the climax ending before it starts. The film flashes back to Paris and his childhood as we get glimpses of his training and the people who help him along. I didn't see it in 3D and I was a bit underwhelmed. The tightrope at Notre Dame seemed rather fake, looking like he was walking on a floor.

7454743,4,B01603ANBQ,"Theatrical review.  This film, sourced from Philippe Petits book To Reach the Clouds, chronicles his walk on a wire strung between the World Trade Center towers.  Trained by Petit himself, Joseph Gordon-Levitt gives a credible performance as the wire-walker.  Directed in impeccable fashion by Robert Zemeckis, the film creates excruciating suspense in the final act.

The film begins with some backstory of how a young Petit began as a juggler and Parisian street magician.  He meets another young busker, Annie Allix played by Charlotte Le Bon, a dead ringer for a younger Winona Ryder.  In the early days Petit loved walking across a rope strung between trees, albeit only a few feet from the ground.  Later he meets a circus impresario and former high wire artist he calls Papa Rudy (Ben Kingsley) who coaches the young and careless Petit on the fine art of the craft.

Petit, seeing a photo of the WTC under construction in the early 1970s decides it would be a good idea to walk on a wire between the towers.  Annie and Petits friend Jean-Louis (Clement Sibony) support his dream and the trio head for New York.  Once there, they find additional accomplices to help pull off the stunt.  The schedule is demanding as it must be done before the towers officially open for business.  This is where the detail behind the scenes is explored, including a funny scene of how exactly they would string the large cable between the towers, some 140 apart.

Zemeckis, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Christopher Browne, provides the atmosphere similar to the great caper movies.  What you will remember however is the final act where Petit actually goes out on the wire.  The movie is terrific from both a dramatic and technical aspect.  In addition, it provides a nice coda for the Towers.  Recommended but for the most acute acrophobia sufferers.",1445212800,18,1849,4.875

7454747,5,B01603ANBQ,"Robert Zemeckis is clearly a director who loves to push the boundaries of new visual technology.  He used visual effects very skillfully in Back to the Future and Forrest Gump and used new motion-capture technology for the computer animated characters in The Polar Express.  The Walk is an awesome visual experience, which comes as close as a movie can to making you feel like you are there in the space between the two World Trade Center towers.  Ive not yet seen the documentary Man on Wire about the high-wire walker Philippe Petits 1974 walk between the twin towers, but Im even more interested now that Ive seen this brilliantly made movie.

The casting of Joseph Gordon-Levitt, as the impetuous French high-wire walker Philippe Petit, is perfect.  As a character, hes both likable and unlikable, but like with other brash artists (which is how the character views himself) such as Van Gogh or Beethoven, you as a viewer become obsessed with watching him even though hes a hothead and completely obsessive.  The tasks he went through to illegally get up to the top of both twin towers, with the aid of several accomplices, are fascinating to watch.  I hope to learn more on the documentary or his book about what specific plot elements were made up for the movie.

One of the ways the movie kept me from getting more scared when hes doing the walk is that there are only a few shots which look down toward the ground, and they looked to me more like a computer game image than like a photographic image, so my mind didn't get tricked into thinking I was about to fall.  If someone is really scared of heights, Im sure theyd not even be considering this movie anyway.

There are excellent visual transitions between scenes, an example being where he looks at a building and then it transitions to a model of the building which he built for envisioning a high-wire-crossing.  The swift pace of the whole movie is due to the visual transitions, the narration, and the music.  Because of the energetic pace, I was enthusiastic by the time he was finally making the triumphant walk between the World Trade Center towers.  The suspenseful events of the night of preparation also add a lot to the movies dramatic power.  Theres one part where a guard comes within about an inch of discovering one of his accomplices on the ground, like the climax of The Sound of Music.  I have a suspicion that was added for dramatic tension, but I guess Ill find out in either his book or the documentary.

Complicating his difficulties, he has an injured foot from stepping into a nail, but has brought his friends over from France and cant delay too long for their sakes.  He additionally has a friend named Jeff (who looks kind of like Elijah Wood) who is afraid of heights but quietly loyal to him.

The energy of the movie is fantastic.  One scene moves into another at such a swift pace that I felt almost excited for him to do something that is pretty foolhardy.  However, I came to see that Philippe Petit and Nik Wallenda know exactly what they're doing when they do high-wire crossings with no safety net below them.  They have a rod in their arms to help them be more balanced, and they wouldnt do it if there was a heavy wind.  The sense of balance high-wire walkers have within themselves is really hard to believe.

It always improves the movie, rather than killing the energy of the movie, when the Philippe character narrates what happens between scenes, standing atop the Statue of Liberty.  Its an interesting narrative device to have him standing at the Statue of Libertys balcony and showing you where the twin towers are (were, I mean).  I wasn't even that sad as I thought about September 11, because this movie immersed me so much in its 1973-1974 world, in such an enthusiastic joy of living way.

Alan Silvestri is always a great composer.  I suspected he was the composer when I heard some of the music, knowing that he had done work for previous Zemeckis movies and also knowing his style of melody and orchestration.  His music in The Walk is good at capturing a sense of wonder and adding elements of danger to that beautiful melody, kind of like his Night at the Museum melody does.  The sound effects are also really important for making you feel like you're watching Philippe really walk across the wire.  Sometimes an alternative reality gets presented in the movie which he narrates, as he talks about what he fears will happen and you start to see and hear it for a few seconds.  That narrative device is made more effective by the sound effects.

There is so much imaginative collaboration that went into this movie, which really paid off.  It feels like every component of the moviemaking became a unified whole.",1444694400,46,4732,4.642256902761105
7454748,4,B01603ANBQ,"The Walk is an inspiring film about sheer determination to achieve a goal that fear hardly factors in to the picture. Joseph Gordon Levitt gives an excellent performance as Philippe Petit, the extremely daring man who crossed the twin tower expanse of 1,350 feet above ground level. Levitt plays the role with hardly a sign of fear in him, overpowered by endless determination to never give up on his dream to be an artist crossing one of the tallest high wires in history back in 1974, August 7th at age 25. Most of the film covers his preparation of this feat, through gaining a team to surveying a way to sneak up and connect the wire necessary to make it safe. Safety is also very important to this character, but not entirely at the cost of eliminating the risk of his skill failing, so no safety wire as Ben Kingley's mentor character pleads for him to wear.
Levitt narrates the film, so right away we know he survives, but the narration surely adds to the charm of the film, even during some of the slower scenes.
If you're a 3D enthusiast, the Walk in 3D is the way to see it. While much of the movie has average 3D, when it really counts, the 3D conversion truly stands out and the depths below are the next best thing to being there on the wire with Phillipe. There are a couple pop outs, but nothing extraordinary.
