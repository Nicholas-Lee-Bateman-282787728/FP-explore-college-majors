1207719,5,B00000F7AM,"I've been waiting for a French version of ""Bilitis"" for years and it's finally here - one of Catherine Breillat's early screenwriting efforts, directed by the great photographer, David Hamilton - and while not perfect, it preserves the great photography of the film, for the most part.  There is not only an French track, but Francis Lai's complete soundtrack (as well as other languages, like German, for those interested in that).  The story of an innocent French girl exposed to the harsh realities of love and sexuality is alive and well.  This is the kind of film they don't make anymore.  A moving painting with beautiful music.  A story of longing.  A memory of summer.  Through the eyes of a French virgin.  Our friends at Pathfinder Pictures, who have single handedly rescued Catherine Breillat's unreleased works (in the last couple years, ""Dirty Like an Angel"" and ""Night After Night"") have done it again.  And I thank them personally for releasing this dvd - which also included an exclusive interview with Madame Breillat.",1346889600,,1035,4.97093023255814
1207720,1,B00000F7AM,"Just godawful acting and even worse cinematography. Although, it has an interesting take on the lolita theme (the twist, lesbian pedophilia, and before you said it, yes, is nothing like Nabokov novel, but is an adult woman having a kind of sexual attraction to a teen girl, the definition of pedophilia). And no, I'm not giving it 1 start for the sexual part, is simply is boring moving.  Just skip this one if you are looking for an interesting artful movie unless you are a Hamilton or sexual/lesbian european coming of age movie fan.  David Hamilton may be a great photographer, but he is an awful director (Rebeca was bad too but better than this one).",1324944000,,656,4.646551724137931
1207761,1,B00000F7AM,"this could have been a great movie.  the problem is this DVD is a transfer from VHS to DVD without enhancing the quality of the picture.  so you get a blurd image especially with the soft focus style of director david hamilton.  the quality of the imaqe of this DVD is terrible.  do not waste your money on this, please. since there are chinese markings on the cover of this DVD, i guess this copy was done in china, no wonder.",1321920000,,427,4.234567901234568

1207764,4,B00000F7AM,"The setting is in a rural place in Europe at an all girls school. Not a bad picture for a VHS., I first saw this in 1982 and could not shake the setting and the pictures. Some of it is fuzzy, but it adds to the ambiance for me. Reminds me of another coming of age movie titled ""Laura"" by the guy with the last name Hamilton? Read betwixt thee lines if you are looking for something else this is an all girls school. Now, its does not seem contrived but authentic experimentation. I chose to make this purchase over 100 others not because it was a good movie but because it came into my life at a curious time and I love English film. It was an attempt to go back and see what I was so intrigued about. I concluded that my youthful libido had a lot to do with it, and the picturesque English countryside.",1255478400,,803,4.0886075949367084
1207765,1,B00000F7AM,"I got this film because of the supposed lesbian content but instead felt like calling the police and reporting this underage sex film.  The 'girl' in this film looks about 14, and has several soft porn sex scenes with much older men and women. Even though the actress was 25 when she made this film, she looks about 14.  I wanted to give this film a big zero but Amazon wouldn't let me.  Other stuff -- the movie is dubbed not subtitled.  The video quality of the film is fuzzy and very poor. Several times the movie froze up.  There was no reason to make this film but to watch a seemingly young, underage girl have sex with a variety of older men and women. If you dig that, than this is the DVD for you!",1244246400,,706,4.161764705882353

Once on vacation, Bilitis comes to hold with her developing sexuality and strikes up a romantic liaison with a local boy... A secondary romance concerns Bilitis' female guardian and her new husband...

The treatment of sensuality is soft and beautiful, which is in keeping with Hamilton's style of photography... At the beginning of the film, we see the sweet, sensual bodies of the schoolgirls exuberantly bathing in a mountain lake...

When Bilitis is finally seduced, it is exaggerated romance, heavily diffused, implying rather than showing their coupling... The lovemaking between the married couple is equally stylized, but more steamy...",1232236800,,737,5.513274336283186

1207770,3,B00000F7AM,"I first saw this film on Cinemax some 20+ years ago. I had seen the coffee table and was impressed with David Hamiltons work. I can't say that I'm real big on the soft focus technique though. Actually, the first work I had seen By David Hamilton was ""Sisters"". It was a coffee table book and was very good. This movie has a good storyline. I have seen this on DVD, but not this label. It was on the New Star label, and I wasn't real impressed with the transfer. The cable TV version I saw had some additional footage that was left out of the DVD version ( NEW Star) I saw. The Version I saw also had some interesting outtakes that were not in the movie during the closing credits, primarily scenes that were in the movie, but shot from a different angle.

1207823,3,B00000F7AM,"One doesn't like to admit one watches a serious film for the T&A, but Pierre Louys didn't provide much of a story to hang ones hat on. My tape looks like it was shot through a filter to give it an effervescent artsy look. It certainly was filmed with art in mind and it is a worthwhile addition. Patti D'Arbanville plays an adolescent convincingly but I think she is a little older than she looks.  At any rate it is clear from her nude shots that this small upstanding actress will have happy babies.  The music of Francis Lai is outstanding. It is well worth listening to on its own account.",1143849600,,593,4.333333333333333
1207824,3,B00000F7AM,"Bilitis (all short vowels) is leaving her boarding school.  Although it seems puritanical in some respects, it is quite permissive in others.  Bilitis has taken another girl as a lover but must leave her as she leaves school.  She is not going with parents, but with a governess of some sort.

Bilitis then runs into a young man she who took pictures at her school and begins to spend time with him.  Meanwhile she becomes aware that her governess and her husband do not have the best relationship.  She seduces her governess and vows to find her a lover.  I am not real clear on the motivations here but in the end Bilitis is not the happiest of campers.

Based on a French classic I have not read, I do not know how well it follows the story.  I do know that I felt there was a lot missing and that many things were not quite clear.  Although meant to be erotic, there is plenty of casual nudity and a couple of understated love scenes.  Definitely not for the narrow-minded but very mild overall.",1136332800,,999,4.375
1207825,5,B00000F7AM,"This DVD is a must. Luscious photography, beautiful women and bonuses. It is soft focus which is Hamilton's style. a previous user said the quality looked weird. This is how Hamilton shoots. This is a film you simply must see and own.",1131235200,,234,4.595238095238095
1207826,5,B00000F7AM,"I now have this adult classic on ORIGINAL DVD.it's not bad..but they could have clear up the picture better. One more thing..a person..wrote...that the music was awful. He's crazy. The music score..is pure beauty. Very very lovely. He must have expected HARD-ROCK SCORE-so sad. Anyhow...again..this is not Porn. All the girls might have looked younger then legal age..but who knows?Bilitis...looked..15 or 16. But she was in her mid-20's.

It's an art movie to began with. David Hamilton...we need you back!",1130112000,,507,5.3375
1207827,3,B00000F7AM,"I bought Bilitis on DVD from Amazon to get better picture quality than the very old VHS copy I have. But I got very disappointed. The DVD's picture quality is no better at all! The DVD is obviously just copied it from a VHS, despite this DVD seems to be the ""official"" one.

The picture quality is the worst of any in my DVD collection. Low resolution. Low contrast. Low color saturation. Jerky picture. You can even see some horizontal stripes typical only for faulty, old videotapes! A shame the studio released this DVD without bothering to scan the original 35 mm.

The movie itself is what you can expect from David Hamilton, who is no ""real"" film director, but a photographer. Or he pretends to be. I don't think he has ever been even close to take one single clear focused picture during his entire life. But he is even worse as a director. His films have dull dialogue (dubbed), untalented acting, boring and completely uninteresting story lines, silly characters, and so on.

The only honest reason to look at Hamilton's books and films is that he somehow knows how to get pretty young girls appear nude in front of the camera. A pity the picture quality is so dull then.

I give this DVD two stars because of a rare, one minute scene with a couple of skinny-dipping girls. And a third one, divided between some OK music themes and a few more nude shoots (including a softy, lesbian ""sex scene"" between the main character and a woman.) Story, acting, picture quality and ""extras"" (hardly anything more than scene selections and own music score) get zero combined.",1129852800,,1572,4.623655913978495
1207828,4,B00000F7AM,"I waited for a long time the DVD version of this visual masterpiece (I have already the VHS tape). Promising a digitally remastered version with enhanced audio (Stereo 2.0), New Star Video offers not only the movie but also you can choose (from the main menu) a still gallery with the Hamilton's beautiful pictures (taken from the film) or just the music (to listen your favorite song of the movie). I gave it four stars because the DVD includes only the dubbed english version, without offering the original french audio or subtitles. Also, the remasterization didn't improve the quality of the images as I expected, but the audio sounds fine.",1129680000,,644,4.863636363636363

Patti D'Arbanville makes hard core...Disneyland.with MS.D'Arbanville hardcore is not necessary. She brings out the innocent that once was. I wish sometimes I lived back in the turn of the 20th century. A Pure Adult Classic. And the Music is so much Important to the movie. When at the end..she's once more left alone.

1207830,5,B00000F7AM,"The english photographer & director,David Hamilton...& music score,lovly as ever by Francis Lai..makes this story about a young schoolgirl's awaking to love,pure magic. The beauitful

PATTI D'ARBANVILE..as..BILITIS..is just breathtaking. Sure there's a whole lot of nudity. But it's not pron. There's no girls running around having sex. It just shows them as girls togehter might be in the vision of the director. I happen to own an ORIGINAL VHS..it's a PERFECT ORIGINAL.It can be order at""MOVIES UNLIMITED"".That's how I got it. And it took a lot of years. I once had it on BETA.I now have it on a dvd-burner print. PERFECT!

The story takes place around the beginning of the 20th Century.

Bilitis forsakes the man she loves to give him to her best friend. Played by MONA KRISTENSEN..as..Melissa. It all takes place on her summer vacation away from home. Bilitis discovers Melissa's husband is with another woman,so she decides to find another man for her. Doing so Bilitis is realizing she is not yet ready herself for adulthood. She will make you laugh..& cry.

Set in England..it's a real beauiful love cult story that people have missed. Ms. D'Arbanville..later played Chevy Chase's girlfriend in 1981 movie..""MORDERN PROBLEMS""And she's still beauitful then as in Bilitis in 1977. A MUST HAVE CLASSIC FOREIGN MOTION PICTURE for the collector. Take a step away from today's Blue Screen..specil effects with people on strings..and watch a real movie that will have you thinking of..""BILITIS!"".",1110067200,,1496,5.195020746887967
1207851,3,B00000F7AM,Great T&A movie.  If you are of that persuasion you'll like the movie.  The story is old hat and there are plenty of videos around with the same line.  The tape is terrible.  This remastered and on a DVD would be great.,1096502400,,219,4.142857142857143
1207852,3,B00000F7AM,"This story is based upon Pierre Louys' turn-of-the-century novel, deals with a young schoolgirl's awakening to love. It takes place during her summer vacation at the home of a family friend, Melissa. The young girl, Bilitis, is shocked when she witnesses her friend and her husband making love, however Melissa encourages Bilitis to discover the aspect of love by seeing a young photographer, Lucas.  When Lucas tries to make love to Bilitis, she rebuffs him and runs to Melissa, who in comforting Bilitis finds herself responding to her kisses and embraces.  Melissa tells Bilitis there must be nothing more between them.

Bilitis discovers Melissa's husband is with another woman, so she decides to find another man for Melissa.  She returns with Nikias, a rich young man who has loved too many too well, and both Melissa and he know they cannot have an affair.  In the end Melissa and Lucas becomes lovers and Bilitis returns to her school realizing she is not yet ready for adulthood.

The quality of the VHS movie, while watchable, is not very good.  However, the sound quality is even worse.  There is a lot of high frequency hiss that should have been filtered out in production.

There is adult nudity, plenty of earl teen nudity (front/rear), adult themes and sexual situations (between Melissa and Bilitis).  This is one of David Hamilton's better productions, on par with Laura and certainly better than Tender Cousins.",1091750400,,1430,4.970588235294118

I am so very glad that I took the risk and purchased this version, as it is obviously film transfers from the originals. Video quality is first rate, and the audio is actually remastered into Dolby 2.0 (English soundtrack) and sounds terrific.

This is an import disc, so menus and text are in Spanish, but familiar placement of options makes it a snap to navigate.
