4376672,5,B004HO6I2O,"This movie is awesome! It has a lot of dirty dark humor, and my style of comedy. I love body changing movies, and this one does it right. Jason Bateman and Ryan Reynolds were perfect as each other. Bateman plays Dave Lockwood, a man who spends too much time at work and doesn't spend time with his family. Reynolds plays Mitch Planko, Dave's lazy slacker friend and a man-child playboy. When they pee into a magic fountain they wish they had each others' lives. The next morning, Dave is in Mitch's body, and Mitch is in Dave's body. They go back to the fountain to see that it has been moved. They are forced to pretend to be each other until they are switched back. Dave is forced to be in a porno, while Mitch is forced to change baby diapers. They must work together to switch back and change their lives for the better. I highly recommend THE CHANGE-UP!!!",1313539200,4,860,4.38125
4376673,2,B004HO6I2O,"They make fun of people with disabilities in this movie. I don't like when humor is making fun of others, so I don't like that. Please support those who have a disability. Don't buy or watch this movie!",1312848000,5,202,4.342105263157895
4376674,3,B004HO6I2O,"You've seen this movie on countless occasions; Freaky Friday, Face/Off, Freaky Friday again, The Skeleton Key, and Freaky Friday a third time amongst a half a dozen other movies I'm probably overlooking. Body swapping isn't exactly a new concept. Truth be told though, while the idea has been used in an R-rated film before it may be something new to the R-rated comedy genre. Maybe that's why we're taking this rather redundant feeling trip once again or maybe it's only to capitalize on Ryan Reynolds blossoming popularity and have long time fans of his reminisce about their first time watching Van Wilder. The Change-Up is coming whether you like it or not and while it isn't the funniest film of the year or even the most original, it isn't quite as bad as you might be expecting.

Dave Lockwood (Jason Bateman) has been working hard his whole life. He thrived to make work the most important thing in his life and that shows as he's one of the best lawyers in town. Meanwhile Mitch Planko (Ryan Reynolds) has barely worked a day in his life and tends to quit anything when it shows the first signs of difficulty. Dave never seems to have time for anything while Mitch just wants someone to come home to and feel appreciated. So after a night at the bar and a conversation while urinating in a public fountain the two accidentally switch bodies.

Raunchiness rears its ugly head not even five minutes into the movie. The Change-Up is probably the most obscene and easily the most vulgar movie of the year, at least thus far. The things that come out of Mitch Planko's mouth, whether he's in the body of Ryan Reynolds or Jason Bateman, walks a thin line between being profane and being downright offensive. It's so unbelievable that you can't help but laugh at times. The really bizarre thing is that I couldn't help but somewhat relate to the Mitch character. Not so much the sleeping around with countless women part, but his sense of humor, use of vulgarity, and dislike for children. That's basically me in a nutshell.

Jason Bateman and Ryan Reynolds do a pretty flawless job of swapping each other's roles. The roles they both start off with are pretty much the roles we've always seen the two actors play, so seeing them switch it up a bit was kind of interesting. Jason Bateman will always bring a little bit of Michael Bluth with him wherever he goes while Reynolds will probably always be seen as Van Wilder first. That's part of their charm and part of the appeal for the fans that have been following them longer than a year or two. Bateman playing the douchebag is actually a lot of fun though and Reynolds is kind of charming in the nice guy role in an awkward and goofy kind of way. Their chemistry is really the thing that makes the comedy work as well as it does. Leslie Mann also has her moments, which usually come once her husband starts acting like his best friend. This is probably Olivia Wilde's best movie performance in the past few years though. She was so boring in both TRON: Legacy and Cowboys & Aliens. At least in this she gets to show that she's both professional and has a kinkier side while portraying much more emotion than in those two films.

The movie progressively snowballs further and further into ridiculous territory as it drudges on though. The scene in the kitchen where Mitch is trying to figure out how to feed Dave's children just about ruined the entire thing for me and the whole Tatiana thing is really stretching it. Each character gets to coach the other while in the other's respective body and those scenes might have honestly been the best in the movie. They were concise and had all the strongest points of the movie in those segments. It's a shame the entire movie couldn't quite hold onto that throughout its duration. With all the fecal matter going into people's mouths, ball cupping, genital shaving, and women being shown on the toilet at inopportune moments, the toilet humor got to be a bit much at times and that's coming from a guy who's a fan of that type of humor.

The Change-Up is slightly above the mediocre line for R-rated comedies this year. It's slightly similar to Hall Pass with a little bit of Bridesmaids and Your Highness thrown in for good measure. While it is fairly humorous at times, its outrageousness is its own downfall as certain bits are too ridiculous for its own good. However, The Change-Up was still a crowd pleaser and is sure to at least make a modest profit at the box office.",1312588800,5,4477,4.59125

4376880,4,B004HO6I2O,"Stupid, funny, irreverent comedy, that is totally saved by the chemistry between Bateman and Reynolds. Ryan Reynolds is by far at his best in comedies. Even Deadpool was more of a comedy than a superhero flick, and that's what pulled it off for me. This one has been done many times before, so there is nothing new. Two buddies, one a straight laced father with a law career, the other an arrested development man child with commitment issues hook up for a night of glory days boozing, and the hi-jinx ensue from there. A fate full stop at a fountain causes them to switch bodies, and forces them to live each others lives for the next week. The real fun is watching these two comic masterminds slide into the dueling roles. Although highly predictable, it is fun to watch, as Bateman plays his toned down father character who unfolds in his new body, and Reynolds going over the top as the clueless friend who now has to take on all the responsibilities. What will happen? Will they grow as people, and come to a mutual understanding of each other? Who cares! It's ridiculous and dumb, but watching the scenes when these two interact together are hysterical and laugh out loud. Park your brain and waste an hour and a half on this one.",1497744000,2,1236,4.547085201793722

4377149,5,B004HO6I2O,"If ever there were an introspective Romantic comedy about the proverbial mid-life crisis, then this one is it.  Mitch (Ryan Reynolds) and Dave (Jason Bateman) are 2 friends who live antipodal lives.  Dave is married with 3 children;  his life is structured and he is well compensated as a lawyer for a major firm.  Mitch, on the other hand, is single, free-wheeling, independent but has little $$ as he has difficulties finding steady employment.  He wants to be an actor, but can't score anything higher than commercials & softcore porn flicks.  Dave & Mitch want what the other has;  Dave envies Mitch's autonomy to do whatever he pleases, while Mitch covets the stability of Dave's life.

One day, when they announce their wish simultaneously to a magic fountain, they trade places.  Mitch gets to live like Dave, and Dave gets to live like Mitch.  They both find out that the other person's life is not so neat & tidy & easy as they assumed it would be.  One thing that is clear is that the situations are ripe for a great many laughs!!

The primary reason I bought this film was the inclusion of Olivia Wilde.  After seeing her in the recent TRON movie, I was ""hooked.""  She does not disappoint as the sultry Sabrina.  Dave has always had an infatuation for her, but he's married.  However......what about if he dates her as Mitch?  Does that ""count"" as adultery.....given that he's no longer the same person?  Hmmmm......what is not in dispute is that, for myself, I'm Wilde about Olvia!  I am presently binge-watching her movies.

If you want a different kind of Romantic comedy, one that actually includes a married couple (whoa!) & is on the raunchy side,  then this flick might be just for you.  While I am not huge on bathroom humor, I will say this flick had the funniest BH I've ever seen  & they didn't over-do it.  If you're a middle aged fellow (like myself) then you will find this romp particularly poignant!",1465948800,3,1926,4.646884272997033

This is JUST another remake of Freaky Friday, just with men... Miserable film with a married guy who has it all- a successful career as an attorney, a beautiful wife and 3 children, the home, etc. and yet he wants to change all that and be like his swinging bachelor friend.

Of course there were times that I laughed, but mostly just kind of rolled my eyes because it was just super predictable... The jokes were overused, repeated, and not funny at all. Combining that with the fact that they seemed to deliberately lose the plot, I kind of just didn't want to finish it.

I did walk away from the movie a few times, and when I came back, I realized I missed nothing and was still able to either guess what I *missed* or piece it together... Again, totally predictable.",1454284800,,788,4.458333333333333

4377418,4,B004HO6I2O,"In the genre of ""trading bodies"" movies, this one stands out. Ryan Reynolds and Jason Bateman are both very funny, and as silly as it is, manage to make one believe they have actually ""traded"" places. In one scene in which Ryan Reynolds character is in bed with his best friends wife, the acting is done well enough that you feel the embarrassment for Reynolds character coming through. The hallmark of good acting is when the viewer can empathize with the characters.

Of course, let's not forget about the women in this movie; Leslie Mann and Olivia Wilde. Leslie Mann is, in my opinion, a brilliant actress in these types of roles (she was great in ""Knocked Up"" and ""Big Daddy"" (Hooters girl)). Olivia Wilde always does a great job portraying the ""serious professional office worker"" with a secret - a tiny slip of a tattoo to let you now she's not ""all business"".

Lastly, the writer for the ""twin babies"" should have received an award for these two. The mischief these two get into is hysterical on its own.",1438214400,2,1012,4.616666666666666

4377772,4,B004HO6I2O,"My biggest problem with this genre, the name of which I might have just made up, is that there is little to no explanation of any kind for the magical phenomenon occurring on your screen...the magic of the movies doesn't count.  Here, Ryan Reynolds and Jason Bateman play best friends who simultaneously pee into a fountain somewhere in Atlanta, Georgia, while wishing to have each other's lives.  Without any legit explanation to be seen anywhere in the film, their wish comes true.  Reynolds, formerly a slacker and porn actor/womanizer, now has to take on the responsibilities of Bateman, who's a successful attorney, married, and the father of three young children.  Bateman in turn sees that Reynolds might not be quite all roses...Reynolds never mentioned the porn.  Despite this plot having happened in one way or another in many movies before this one, this was still a film with its fair share of jokes.  Unfortunately, this is one of those films where I can't make up my mind as to whether or not I like Leslie Mann.  Olivia Wilde, on the other hand, has my uncontested support.  She was quite fun to watch and I liked her character's more wild side...though isn't being pushed into a date by your boss with your boss's friend grounds for sexual harassment.  Regardless, the film was still fun.  It doesn't take itself too seriously and brings decent laughs.  So it's safe for adults to watch.  Enjoy.",1404086400,,1411,4.809128630705394

4378189,2,B004HO6I2O,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

 'The Change-Up' is an occasionally amusing farce involving two life-long friends who by sleight of hand, end up in one another's bodies. The big 'switch' occurs after a night of 'bromancing', where the two friends both find themselves urinating in front of a statue fountain, whose visage reminds one vaguely of the Statue of Liberty. The Statue appears to have some magical powers, which causes the transformation.

Jason Bateman plays the 'straight' friend, Dave Lockwood, a workaholic attorney who is married with three kids in the suburbs. Ryan Reynolds plays Mitch Planko, his offbeat, somewhat vulgar friend, who provides the comic relief.

Clearly the far more entertaining character is Mitch, who is continually pushing boundaries from the outset. So when Mitch becomes Dave, Dave has the much better part. We get to see how Mitch as Dave, upsets Dave's world. The humor comes from the fish out of water premise: Mitch simply doesn't fit into Dave's world--but somehow, in the end, he manages to improve it.

For example, he eventually convinces the CEO of Dave's company to play hardball with a rival Japanese company, during a mediation, and Dave's company ends up making out like bandits. On the personal level, Mitch as David hilariously convinces Dave's daughter to meet 'violence with violence', so she retaliates after a school bully knocks her down during a ballet performance.

Unfortunately when David pretends to be Mitch, there is no comic equivalence. The whole idea is that David needs to slow down and adopt Mitch's spontaneous lifestyle. There's nothing funny when he's forced to be aloof during Mitch's porno shoot, or the trip to the Aquarium or relaxing, watching a DVD of 'Animal House'. And there are also no laughs when he starts dating Sabrina, Dave's sexy colleague at work, where he finally learns to become more spontaneous.

Mitch as Dave also falls into line, becoming more responsible as a good parent and eventually reconciling with his father, by attending his father's wedding. So by the end of the film, the best friends learn their valuable life lessons, but whatever humor was generated earlier, with the real Mitch doing his shtick and then Mitch as David doing his thing, is lost. Dave or Dave as Mitch, was never funny in the first place (regardless of the absurd 'poop attack' by Dave's infant, at the beginning of the film).

A good part of 'The Change-Up' also relies on bathroom humor which has limited appeal. One particular scene that fails to fire is the big buildup for Dave's wife when she enters the bedroom, only to end up in the bathroom on the toilet, concentrating on a series of difficult bowel movements.

In the end, this is a film that is mildly amusing in spots. Somehow if Dave also had some more significant idiosyncrasies like Mitch, this would have been a funnier film.",1382054400,,2881,4.93595041322314

4378577,5,B004HO6I2O,"I had very low expectations when this movie began, but I was pleasantly surprised- it made me laugh out loud from start to finish. ""The Change-Up"" is a foul-mouthed bonanza of crude, crass humor, perfectly delivered by the talents of Bateman and Reynolds.

At first, I was disappointed to see that the plot of this movie was to follow a story that has already been exhaustively explored in other movies, like ""Freaky Friday"" and ""Big"". But I've decided that this is fine, and that the ""change-up"" theme is actually quite palatable, if you consider it to be a sub-genre of the comedy field, much like you might consider the ""buddy cop"" concept to be a sub-genre. Sure, it's been done several times before, but it's sort of become its own thing now. And ""The Change-Up"" does enough to bring its own brand to the sub-genre to make it stand out- namely embracing the notion of hard-R comedy that is aimed squarely at adults (under no circumstances watch this movie with your children, or you WILL be embarrassed!).

Granted, you can't just throw a bunch of curse words into the script and expect it to be funny. But that's where the talents of Bateman and Reynolds shine, and their hilarious delivery carries the movie wonderfully. My friends and I had a great time watching this at home, and we couldn't stop laughing!",1355875200,,1315,4.688311688311688

It isn't so much in their beginning roles but when they switch off and you see said actors playing their counterparts quite nicely.

Also starring Olivia Wilde, Alan Arkin and Leslie Mann. Sorry but the nudity scenes were mostly body doubles and CGI, people. Did I destroy the fantasies? Heh.

I didn't care for the potty humor, especially in the beginning, but it picked up thereafter. The ending is predictable. I would have liked it if the two characters made another choice.

Get the kids out of the house for this one because there are ""F"" bombs every few seconds and there is nudity, but every nude part or ""F"" bomb made me laugh. The one way in which this movie stands out is that it finishes well and is funny all the way to the end. Most funny movies and especially every ""switch"" movie gets stupid by the half way mark, but this one kept up its momentum until the credits. Liked it so much that I am ordering the BR now. I wonder if I saw the uncensored version since it was German TV? Reynolds' best movie since Waiting (one of my favorites) and this is basically the same character.

4378609,2,B004HO6I2O,"I love Jason Bateman and Ryan Reynolds, and I have no problem with crudity, nudity, foul language, etc...but this was a train wreck.  The humor and the plot were tired and obvious.  Stuff you've seen a million times before.  The F-word is fine, but it seems like they went out of their way to cram it into every sentence.  It got annoying.  Everything was so over the top.  No one, anywhere, ever, would act the way the Jason Bateman does in front of a child.  Even for a dumb R-comedy, it was unbelievable.  You know those two 15-year-olds down the block who think they're funny but really just bug the hell out of everyone?  This is the movie they would make.

The worst of all is this: because of the body switch, each actor is playing a part better cast for the other.  I don't buy Jason Bateman as a womanizing dirt bag, and I don't buy Reynolds as a corporate attorney, but after they switch bodies, that's what you get for the majority of the movie.  It would have been better to cast the actors in opposite roles at the beginning and then switch them.  They would have been much funnier in their roles.

There are a million other things wrong with this, but I'll save you the time.  Save yourself the time as well and skip this.  Watch ""Waiting"" instead.",1345593600,,1262,4.375

Jason Bateman and Ryan Reynolds are awesomely funny, and their characters are SO WELL-WRITTEN!  This movie has been done before (two people change into each other's bodies accidentally, there are LOTS of outrageously funny situations because of this, and then they change back), but RARELY has it been done so well!  This is pretty vulgar but is done so exceedingly well that I have watched it a number of times with my 24 year old son.  Jason Bateman is Dave, a married conservative, successful lawyer with twin babies who is trying for a partnership in his firm.  Ryan Reynolds is Mitch, an immature dolt of a wanna be actor whose main goal in life is bedding every woman he can, sleeping 'til noon and having fun.  One night they pee in a fountain and wake up the next morning in each other's bodies!  I can't begin to explain the clever situations the writers thought of to exploit every bit of humor from this.

4378640,3,B004HO6I2O,"The Change-Up is an example where the length of the movie was the biggest problem.  Two hours that surely should have been trimmed to less than 80.  You see when the humor was on, it was REALLY on and I was laughing extremely hard (such as the babysititng segment and the way Ryan Reynolds' character was holding the kids while running down the stairs and then setting them on the counter only to discover that the babies were ready to stick their heads in a nearby outlet or throw knives at Ryan's head).  THESE were great moments.  In fact any segment that focused on the babies was really memorable.  I was sort of weirded out whenever the one baby would frequently smack his head against the side of the crib because the film would sort of speed up, lol.

The problem is that the humor is frequently sacrificed for romance that simply doesn't work, or rather (in the case of Ryan's character) feels totally tacked on when, for example, Ryan's character eventually falls in love with Olivia Wilde's character and it all just seemed TOTALLY pointless to me.  I truly don't understand why that entire segment was even necessary to be included.

The storyline is that the always funny Jason Bateman (best actor by FAR in the movie) and Ryan Reynolds urinate and make a wish in a water fountain and when morning arrives they discover that they've been switched so Ryan's immature/silly personality is inside Jason's body, and Jason's professional/serious character is inside Ryan's.  The consequences are often unusual but sometimes they work (such as the segment when both Jason and Ryan were sitting in the living room and trying to convince Jason's wife that they've exchanged bodies and the wife laughing it off as a stupid joke).

Another really annoying aspect is the way the characters would just blurt out REALLY obnoxious swear words.  This was totally unnecessary and certainly doesn't constitute quality writing.  Lots of nudity too.

Again though, the movie is overlong by at least 30 minutes.  Trim away some of the useless fat at the end and I'd be a happier person and probably even raise the rating to a 4 out of 5.  Oh and the ""bouquet of balls"" joke said by the wife when the family was revealing personal information about each other as a way of getting revenge was a REALLY awesome line.",1336176000,,2306,4.71571072319202

The body swap concept has been beaten to death over the past 25 years, but never has there been one so crass and non kid-friendly. There's nudity, swearing, porno parodies, and poop-in-the-face shots. Things you'd never expect. AWESOME! It's about time!

As a parent, you should familiarize yourself with MPAA ratings. Any parent who thought this film was going to be as vanilla as the trailer made it out to be should never breed again...ever.

Naturally, its quite a shock to both of them when they end up switching bodies and lives.

What really impressed me was the ability of each actor to seemlessly make the transition from the characters they spend the first 10-15 minutes establishing, to spending the remaining 90 minutes or so as the complete opposite.  Plus, despite all the hilarious humor - if you don't think poop is funny, don't bother watching this movie - there is actually a deeper meaning to the story.

However, I don't know if its been done between two grown men so maybe that might be where this is different.  The film is entertaining mainly because of the performances by Jason Bateman and Ryan Reynolds.  The female supporting cast is top notch as well, Leslie Mann and Olivia Wilde who is beyond stunning and no surprise she's going to be in a movie called ""Welcome to People"" playing Michelle Pfeiffer's daughter.

The male leads were fun to watch as they take over the other's persona.  Ryan Reynolds is a pot smoking slacker who stays home all day having sex and has zero goals.  Jason Bateman plays an unhappy married guy with a young kid and 2 babies.  His life is his miserable lawyer job and his way of finding happiness is buying more cars and houses.  Naturally both guys envy the other one's life.  Jason's character dreaming of spending the day doing nothing like his pal.  And Ryan's character envying that Jason's character has a family who looks forward to seeing him when he gets home to a place crammed with nice things.

Both of them get that opportunity to switch into the other's body one drunk night as they're urinating in a park fountain.  Ordinarily they'd be slapped with a sexual predator ticket for doing that and done again in a mall in front of kids which was very strange that it was written that way, but obviously the movie pays no mind to those real life rules.

The movie is also crude, crass and plagued with never ending foul language.  Maybe that'll be fun for a teenage boy, but for me it was wearing thin because it simply was not working each time.  There were places where it was warranted and it was funny, but then its sprinkled throughout so you're thinking, 'o-kayyy, what does that have to do with anyone?'

Yes, there were a few moments where I simply laughed out loud, but others where I kind of shook my head. Childhood friends Mitch (Reynolds) and Dave (Bateman) have secretly envied each others' lives. Mitch is a free minded actor who goes thru his life with no responsibilities or consequences for his actions. Dave is a successful attorney with a wife and kids, who thinks the grass is greener on the other side, which in this case would be the life of his free spirited friend. Wishing for the others' life, Mitch and Dave chant their desires while urinating in a fountain in the park. Waking to find themselves in the others' body, they each set to have what they always desired. Through a series of misadventures.....and there are several...they learn to appreciate what they have. Dave learns that success and wealth won't bring you happiness if you don't take the time to appreciate those who love and care for you; while Mitch learns that ignoring his responsibilities; being promiscuous; and smoking pot gets a little old as you get older.

Overall, the movie was ok and somewhat entertaining, and in the end, the theme was clear....""the grass is not always greener"" or ""appreciate, cherish and be grateful for what you have"".  And finally, while I thought I selected the theatrical version, there were some scenes that contained nudity and or sexual innuendo. The ""F"" word was also used liberally.

You start the movie with a dumb guy, you finish the movie with a dumb guy with a hot girlfriend, a very smart Sabrina McArdle (played by Olivia Wilde). And you know a woman like that will probably never end up with a shell of a man like Mitch Planko (even if it looks like Ryan Reynolds)

Otherwise, this movie is a total waste of money and time. Personally, I found it an odd and non-working combination of humor for 12 year olds and thirty year olds. I couldn't reconcile the mix. Did the producer expect that twelve year olds would be watching a movie with ass porn and harsh language in it, or did they expect thirty year olds to appreciate poop in mouth humor?

Maybe I don't get it. Maybe I don't understand the 30-somethings of the 21st century. I'm a male in my 50's, have two teenage kids at home, and I am an avid movie watcher. I will watch anything if for no other reason than to review it for myself.

4378760,3,B004HO6I2O,"A friend who loves comedies recommended this movie, so my husband and I watched it last night. Well, as far as storylines go, there's nothing new here. Justin Bateman plays Dave Lockwood, a successful, up and coming lawyer at a posh law firm. Dave is happily married to Jamie (Leslie Mann) and has a young daughter and infant twins. Then there's Dave's best friend, Mitch (Ryan Reynolds), who is a layabout and 'dabbles' in porn flicks.

The story takes off after the drunk pair pee into a fountain one night, wishing that they could be the other person. Voila! Dave and Mitch end up switching bodies. This makes for some funny and yes, awkward moments, especially for Mitch who ends up living in Dave's house with Dave's family, sharing a bed and some uncomfortably intimate moments with Dave's wife. Dave in the meantime, finds out to his horror the degenerate lifestyle Mitch leads.

The plot is predictable, and the saving grace is the hammy performances by both Bateman and Reynolds. There are some truly funny moments though, like when Dave (who is in Mitch's body) eagerly waits up for a romantic rendezvous with Mitch's regular Tuesday date (the boys have decided it is OK to have sex with the other's wife/ dates as they are technically in the other's body) and discovers the blond bombshell erm, has some hidden depths!

I did feel there was too much profanity, unnecessary in my opinion. On the whole though , this is an average, light-hearted comedy made tolerable by Bateman's and Reynold's performances.",1325030400,4,1517,4.826923076923077

This is by far the best and funniest `switch' movie I have ever seen. All the others are chick flicks. THIS is not. It is a guy flick and funny as hell.

First off, Jason Bateman gets to be the `guys guy'  FINALLY. He gets to swear, cup his coinpurse, and do everything he has never been cast to do. Ryan Reynolds is hilarious as Bateman's character trying to deal with his horrible slutty, slacker life, and Bateman does a great job playing Reynold's slacker character trying to deal with Bateman's button down collar life. Confused? WATCH THE DVD.

Projectile baby poo in the face, a lunatic nympho preggo, a hot wife on the toilet cursing Thai food and advising a scented candle, woofing on your bud's co-worker, and peeing in a magical fountain causing a city-wide power outage....okay, does it get any better? This is NOT your typical `chicks changing places' mindless Hollywood touchy-feely drivel. We've seen those films and they are FREAKING LAME!

Bateman and Reynolds are phenomenal. Their best bud chemistry is excellent, and I for one hope they get to act together again. Get a sack, and watch this dvd. It never stops being funny.",1324080000,,1347,4.619246861924686
4378812,3,B004HO6I2O,"I really wanted to see this movie because the Trailer looked amazing. My favorite actor, Jason Bateman, was in it. And, I really enjoyed Horrible Bosses. HB got a horrible review on Amazon, but I found it really funny-- so when I read that this movie also had terrible reviews, I just ignored it and paid $4 to see it.

Unfortunately, the Trailer was a lot different than the actual movie. They really should hire whomever the guy is that makes the trailers to make a movie! I wish I paid more attention to the reviews. THe Change-Up was excessively raunchy.  It would be funny to people who like that kind of humor.  I, myself, find it amusing in small doses and when it's well timed.  The raunchiness here was just over the top though.

I think that might be a reason why this movie didn't make much money. It actually was a financial loss, according to Wiki.  According to IMDB, it is only a 6.5/10.  It had some funny moments, but most of the punchline was captured in the trailer.  There was a lot of cursing and swearing.  There were a lot of vulgar jokes.

It was like they took the Disney movie, where people switch places, but fraternized it. There was a LOT of nudity. It was just randomly placed. Some scenes which were meant to be funny-- struck me as more grotesque.  It looks like the producers were going for shock factor.  If you like movies, like Weather Man or Elf, maybe you would like this.  It is more in the style of Will Farrell humor.

This is nothing like Horrible Bosses or other work that Jason Bateman usually does.  Just so you know- before you purchase....",1324080000,2,1586,4.4206896551724135

Bateman and Reynolds took this movie because it was over the top, pushing the envelope Bateman said in an interview. This plot and the whole switching bodies has been done so many times.

I never write reviews but I couldn't stand to see how so many people were writing reviews saying there's too much cursing, nudity and so on. If you feel like that then this movie is clearly not for you and you shouldn't be watching it. It's RATED R for a reason, go watch The Smurfs or Grown Ups.

With that said this movie is hilarious, haven't seen a comedy like this in years. Throughout the whole film they were constantly pushing their boundaries which made it great.

Also, you'll only think the parts with the kids are funny if you hate kids. That's a broad assumption, but I think its pretty true. Think an infant pounding his head against the side of a crib is funny? Think a douche leaving kids on a high counter to be nearly eletrocuted and stabbed is funny? Then watch this garbage.

They have twins. He suddenly becomes a single man. Their goal is to try to get by day by day until they can locate the magical wishing fountain. Of course this doesn't last for one minute as the lawyer has turned into an f-bomb throwing idiot, and we find out Mitch stars in soft-core films or lorno (light porno) as they are called in the movie.

When the movie is not being crude and sophomoric, it works fairly well. The guys get to see how others view them, for better or worse. Mitch discovers he is way too juvenile and needs to grow up. Dave discovers life is more than status. The extras include a deleted scene and a gag reel not worth the view. Not as good as either ""Hang Over"" film, more akin to ""Hall Pass.""

Folks, I can't tell you squat about this movie as I was unable to watch it. It started out stupid and seemed to just get more stupid as it went on. I skipped through the chapters to see if it were going to get any better, and it just didn't look like it was going to be worth the time it would take to sit through it.

This was yet another one of those movies about people switching bodies. The storyline has been done to death and it seems that each movie is worse than the last one.

This one, from what little I saw, was horrible. It was as juvenile as any film that I have ever seen. Don't get me wrong, I like stupid movies. But this thing was way too stupid.

4378944,4,B004HO6I2O,"THE CHANGE-UP is another film by the writers of HANGOVER AND HANGOVER II (Jon Lucas and Scott Moore) and the director of wedding crashers (David Dobkin): that should give a pretty solid clue as the what is in store in this film - potty mouth and gross humor that is so very very popular today!  The concept of the story (two disparate characters changing lives in a manner as magical as the fairy tale 'The Three Wishes') is not new and at times it becomes wearing, but the big difference here is that the characters are assigned to two really brilliant comic actors - and so it works in the long run.

Two longtime friends are feeling distance in their relationship: Mitch (Ryan Reynolds) is a womanizing free-spirited life as an actor for commercials and 'lorn movies' (soft porn) who lives in a pigsty of an apartment, grabbing fast food where he can find it, while Dave (Jason Bateman) is a conscientious successful lawyer with a major la firm in Atlanta, and is married to a beautiful woman, and lives in a picture book house with three small children.  The old concept of the grass being greener on the other side of the fence brings the men together for a drunken evening where while voiding in a  public fountain voice that they wish they could change places. Thunder, darkness and boo, they wake up as the other guy.  Mitch must carry on the functions of a learned lawyer while maintaining his own style and faces the duties of a parent of infants and a dissatisfied wife (Leslie Mann) while Dave attempts to adjust to the grungy Lothario existence as the lorn star, being pursued by the beautiful Sabrina (Olivia Wilde).  Gradually each man in his new role discovers ore about life by walking in the others shoes and it is at this point that the film becomes an intelligent vantage of appreciating what we have by seeing it through the eyes of polar opposite friends.

Both Reynolds and Bateman have great comic timing and make us understand the conflicts of views and appreciation found in the change of lives.  The women in the cast do well and there is a touching cameo by Alan Arkin as Mitch's father.  This is a bawdy comedy with the emergence of a heart full of lessons in the end.  Make it through the fist 30 minutes and you'll find a good movie.  Grady Harp, November 11",1320883200,14,2289,4.531553398058253
4378965,2,B004HO6I2O,"Yep, they did a change up--replacing a potentially funny, thoughtful comedy with this inept idiocy. Honestly, this tripe must have been written by relatives of someone within the Hollywood system (hey, I guess they have to do something to pay for their Mercedes). You can encase a turd in 24 carrot gold but it's still, at it's core, a turd.

If you want a comedy with funny scenes with a script that makes sense you need to look somewhere else because this one has the consistency of thin, poor tasting gruel. It's like the writers (and even the director) took a look at ""Freaky Friday"" and tapped each scene for ""inspiration"" while drug or stoned. The director likewise must have been on some mind altering substance since the story has little to no continuity and strains credability (even for a fantasy comedy like this).

To be fair, there are a couple of scenes that are very funny including a scene where Jason Bateman tries to feed the twins and one of then throws knives at him. I gave the film an extra star for this funny scene but the rest...well let's just say that I hope if the world ends tomorrow THIS isn't the only example of film comedy that survives. The bulk of the film though seems like it was written by a monkey at a typewriter and then the scenes were thrown into the air and randomly stapled together.

If these things matter to you the Blu-ray looks positively stunning at times.

Bateman and Reynolds are, as always, appealing even when they play repulsive characters. The cast, sadly, beyond the stars isn't really given a lot to do except look pretty, flash their breasts (in the case of the women)and smack their hand into their head as the main characters do something else stupid. The feel good tone of the ending is poorly handled and, well, seems tacked on from a totally different (better) movie even if it is cliched and overly sentimental.

I've given this two stars because there are a couple of funny scenes but if a couple of funny scenes passes for quality filmmaking today, we've witnessed the nadir of American film comedy.",1320796800,11,2068,4.608695652173913

That well never quite runs dry, but every once in a while it does pump out some rancid sewage and try to pass itself on as San Pellegrino.

The premise is all too familiar: longtime buddies Mitch, a swinging bachelor, and Dave, a married lawyer with kids, have grown to become polar opposites of each other, and each of them envies the other's lot in life. When a freak accident causes them to switch bodies, they learn that the grass isn't necessarily always greener on the other side. Sound predictable and formulaic? That's what I thought, too. Though there's some fun to be had in watching both Reynolds and Bateman play against type, the conceit wears thin quickly, and there just isn't enough left in the script to make the film memorable.
