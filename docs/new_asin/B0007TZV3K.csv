2243998,5,B0007TZV3K,"A truly enjoyable film that is uniquely Canadian, it contains something which makes itself a diamond in the rough among modern day films - heart.  Exploring the intracacies of numerous topics from a failing marriage to the complexities of untold love.  This in depth exploration, in conjunction with excellent acting from the all-Canadian cast, makes this film truly wonderful.",1112140800,7,377,5.372881355932203
2243999,5,B0007TZV3K,"A beautiful, simple, and gently humourous look at the shenanigans and goings-on of a small town in one day, ""Wilby Wonderful"" is simply that - wonderful.  It's a perfect little gem of a film that not only has an all-star Canadian cast, but boasts witty and thoughtful writing, and emotive direction.
Covering such topics as the complicated relationship between a mother and daughter, a marriage on the brink of complete dissolution, and a love that dare not speak its name, ""Wilby Wonderful"" allows 'normal' people to shine in this curiously poignant and oftentimes hilarious movie - some memorable characters include the typically small-town, brashly outspoken mayor, a sign painter who's dyslexic, and a depressed man whose suicide attempts all seem to be thwarted at the worst times.
Most importantly, this film has something which so many movies lack - heart.  The townsfolk of Wilby are easily recognizable, and in a way that seems uniquely Canadian, each person in Wilby seems to have about them a sense of unerring hope, a sort of quiet optimism that keeps them going.
Utterly and completely engrossing and spellbinding from beginning to end, ""Wilby Wonderful"" is quirky, entertaining, and heartbreakingly beautiful.  Don't pass this one up.",1111363200,10,1248,5.199004975124378
2244000,5,B0007TZV3K,"Featuring an all-star Canadian cast, WILBY WONDERFUL is a warm ensemble comedy written and directed by the talented Daniel MacIvor. The small, island-town of Wilby is populated by islanders and off-islanders alike, but what all the characters share is a desire to love and be loved. Central to Wilby's difficulties is a scandal that threatens to tear the town apart. Details are scarce, but rumors are flying with the threat of public exposure hovering over the lives of two central characters in the film. Dan (James Allodi) repeatedly attempts to take his own life, but is constantly interrupted. Real estate agent Carol French (the delightful Sandra Oh) frantically prepares for a town-wide celebration while her relationship with her husband Buddy, a town cop (Paul Gross) grows stagnant. Buddy flirts with infidelity with Sandra (Rebecca Jenkins) whose attempts to resuscitate a local restaurant depends on her decision to stay or leave the town; a decision Sandra's daughter Emily (Ellen Page) frets about as she grows closer to a local boy whose motives for declaring his love for her grow suspect. WILBY WONDERFUL is a funny movie, filled with moments of gravity. MacIvor, whose first film was the emotional PAST PERFECT, directs with a light touch, allowing the ensemble of very strong performances shine. In this case, WILBY is truly wonderful.",1110672000,45,1354,5.187214611872146
2244001,5,B0007TZV3K,"I received this DVD as part of a movie of the month club of sorts, and it has been my favorite film so far in the series.  Wilby Wonderful is a fantastic Canadian film with an all-Canadian cast, set in a small Canadian island town, called Wilby.  The small, seemingly innocent town of Wilby is a hotbed of secrets and lies, that have the potential to destroy people's lives and the very town itself.  The story revolves around several characters and their problems with themselves and each other.  They go about their daily lives with their personal secrets tearing them apart inside, and it all spills out in the final climax.  The most notable performances in a film full of great performances are those of Sandra Oh (Sideways) as Carol French and Callum Keith Rennie (The Butterfly Effect) as Duck MacDonald.  Keep an eye out for this film and see it by any means possible.  Wilby Wonderful will brighten your day.",1109721600,10,917,4.658385093167702

2244048,4,B0007TZV3K,"I kept noticing, as I watched,  that actors in the film, as in the theater, are utilizing the whole stage. In this instance it's the whole island. As the characters move abstractly in and out of each other's lives, they're also literally exploiting vast swaths of space. The story opens with Emily Anderson (Ellen Page) racing across and deep into the idyllic setting to meet up with her guy. This element of intersecting and transecting by the characters, and in their subplots, is amazingly achieved. The storyline is a composite of smaller personal stories of the inhabitants of Wilby, as the town prepares to celebrate its annual festival. Intermittently, and in the way of very dark humor, all the action is interrupted by an island newcomer, hellbent on suicide. And as he, Dan Jarvis ( James  Allodi), punctuates the storyline with a series of bizarre attempts, another character, each time, bursts on the scene in the knick of time. The cast provides an impressive concentration of really good acting.  Callus Keith Rennie, as Duck, gives a strong performance as the omnipresent handyman, a sort overseer of all the characters' personal safety and wellbeing. Rebecca Jenkins and Paul Gross do a fine job.  Knock-your-socks-off brilliant is Sandra Oh as Carol French, the dancing-as-fast-as-she-can workaholic, who's spinning-out is uniquely striking. Now the flaw: the sex scandal relates to gay men hanging out at Wilby Watch, and their names are about to be made public. The film was released in 2005, and although homophobia persists, the notion of a newspaper being on the verge of naming and outing gay men seems pretty archaic as a theme. The plot prevents that outcome and does attempt a somewhat facile resolution. The film, written, directed, and even performed by Daniel Maclvor, is definitely worth seeing. All filmmaking elements shine. Additional praise should go to Rudolf Blahacek for cinematography, Ian Greg for set decoration, Mike Munn for editing, and Michael Timmons for music.",1481414400,3,2006,5.144171779141105

Who could possibly think these movies are not for little kids?  Besides, uptight doesn't win film festival awards. This applies not just to this movie but to many Film Movement DVDs I have watched.  Call this a strong PG-13 or more likely an R.

As for the film itself, the production values are decent and this is its strongest point.

The battle is between a golf course and gay cruiser spot in a small town.  I hate golf and think gay cruisers should get a room.  Not much to root for either way.  Of course the town folks are all depicted as backwards hateful people for finding homosexuality a bit out of the ordinary.  There is no explicit sex, but a few long, uncomfortable gay seduction scenes are included to put straights who may be watching this in their place.

The music is poor.  Most of it sounds like it bad modern granola folk music sung by a neurotic, neurasthenic teenager.

Paul Gross is a fine actor but doesn't have much to work with here.  Sandra Oh I have seen before--in another awful movie--but like in that awful movie movie, gives a good performance.  Maybe the best in the movie.

This is small-town Canadian stuff, understated and very deliberately paced, but as we move around among the various townspeople, a dark comedy begins to take shape. Oh is an ambitious Realtor, married to laid-back Gross, who is a local cop. Page is the rebellious daughter of the town slut. A man is quietly planning to kill himself and his reasons are the heart of this film.

I'm SUCH a fan of Paul Gross, but there is another guy, Callum Keith Rennie, that I'm gonna keep an eye out for in the future. Yum! He's done a lot of movies and TV, and will be in the new American series, ""The Firm"" that starts this season. It features Josh Lucas in the lead. I might take a peek and see if I can spot Mr. Rennie.

This is NOT one of those condescending flicks where the sophisticated filmmaker snickers at the poor unenlightened rubes in his film. The small-town people here have the same issues as the big-city folks and it's great to see their own unique way of dealing with them. Just thought you might like to know.",1325635200,4,1328,4.525
2244117,4,B0007TZV3K,"As a die hard admirer of Paul Gross, I enjoyed this movie.  It was fun to watch, and Paul's performance was good.  Like the female star in ""Getting Married in Buffalo Jump"" said, ""He makes the backs of my knees sweat.""  At first, I didn't think I would like it, but the actors - especially Paul - were worth watching.

The concept of the movie was interesting, funny and likeable.",1310860800,,380,4.385714285714286

I was having trouble because I kept wondering how seriously I should take some of the reviews by Amazon users. When I saw that You and Me and Everyone We know only had three and a-half stars, and that Garden State only had four, etc., I started to realize I had to take a chance - 'cause I love both those films. So for those who might be dissuaded by the reviewers here who say the film is about nothing, or too slow-moving, I'm here to tell you that it's a well-crafted plot, with artfully connected characters and (sub)plot lines. It's subtle and good-humored. It's refreshing in not slamming viewers over the head with its messages. Really, it's a rather sweet piece of work, and I quite enjoyed it. Other (relatively) contemporary films I like include You Can Count on Me, Mumford, Next Stop Wonderland, Little Children, and Pope Dreams. Just to give you an idea. I'm impatient with the obvious, bored with standard, in-the-box, categorical thinking, and relatively disinterested in standard ""romances.""",1298764800,2,1123,4.7055837563451774

2244122,4,B0007TZV3K,"""Wilby Wonderful"" is a typically charming Canadian film, an engaging ensemble piece about a small, isolated rural town standing in the path of modern development. The writing is human and warm (even while dealing with sad subjects...) and the acting is a delight.  Indeed, fans of film and TV will be wowed by the cast, which includes several now-famous Canadian actors.

If you like films that are about more than car chases, bank heists, wars, etc. -- quiet, human-scale films that use the acting talents of their casts in ways that are unusual and revelatory -- then check this one out...

2244123,5,B0007TZV3K,"You know, I really love finding stuff like this.  From the mind of the tragically underrated but extremely talented Canadian filmmaker Daniel MacIvor comes ""Wilby Wonderful"", a quirky offbeat tale of love, redemption, and other random things.  Basically it's a day in the life of the residents of Wilby, a small and tightly-knit island community.  There's not really a main plot on the whole, but rather several smaller plots that sort of intertwine and fit together nicely.

The story follows a variety of colorful characters, including a depressed gay man who continually attempts suicide; a teenage girl (played perfectly by the ever-amazing Ellen Page) who is struggling to maintain relationships with her promiscuous alcoholic mother and her jerk boyfriend, who is pressuring her into having sex; a high-strung real-estate agent (Sandra Oh) whose fierce dedication to her work is putting a serious strain on her marriage; a handyman (played by an unfortunately unknown actor named Callum Keith Rennie) who oddly seems to offer solace to everyone he meets, and many others.

The characters all face their own conflicts, which all escalate as the day progresses, and each plot thickens as their paths cross.  With a movie like this, the challenge is keeping everything focused and organized, and MacIvor does an excellent job of this.  The performances are great across the board, and the story is filled with genuine emotion and just a bit of dark humor to balance things out.  It may sound a bit bleak and depressing by my description, but this is ultimately a feel-good movie that never feels sappy or contrived.  It also manages to be quirky and unique, but still pretty realistic.  You sort of get the feeling that these kinds of things probably really do go on in small towns all over the world, that sort of struggle to maintain a balance between the conflict of the individual and the comaraderie of the community.

Finally, the cinematography is excellent as well.  It has this sort of simplistic, pastoral feel that's perfectly conducive to the mood, and the location (somewhere in Nova Scotia, I think?) is really beautiful.  I really like the music too.  There's at least a couple of songs in here for which I really need to find the artist.

Anyway, this is just a really great movie, one that I could watch over and over and never get tired of.  I really wish MacIvor would make more movies, because I really dig his style.  He did one before this called ""Marion Bridge"" (which also stars Ellen Page, and the woman who played her mother in this one), which is also really good.  I definitely need more.",1208563200,2,2619,4.873589164785553
2244124,4,B0007TZV3K,"This quiet film perfectly captured for me the essence of living in a small community where people still care about who your parents were and what you did in high school long after the glory of prom night has passed, and where political corruption can be truly small and petty and yet still ruin people's lives. It's a surprisingly sweet film considering the dark nature of the central plot. An excellent ensemble cast practicing some fine, tightly controlled acting, makes it enjoyable to watch as events in the small town pass through a possible crisis.

2244125,5,B0007TZV3K,"A day in the life on Wilby Island, off Nova Scotia, may not sound like a resource for rich storytelling, but in the gifted hands of writer/director Daniel MacIvor and inordinately talented Canadian cast WILBY WONDERFUL penetrates more dark secrets, exposes more astray lives, and addresses more human frailties than almost all of the competition. This is independent filmmaking at its finest, with all of the emphasis on quality and little concern for the big budget special effects that mire so many films today.

On the little island, divided between islanders and mainlanders 'visiting', lives an array of lonely people.  We are introduced to a 'cause celebre' that happened on the beach (though the facts are hazy) and investigating the scandal are police officers Buddy French (Paul Gross) and his somewhat loose cannon Stan (portrayed by MacIvor himself).  Buddy's wife Carol (Sandra Oh) is a very busy real estate person, assisted by her doofus secretary Deena (Kathryn MacLellan), out to sell a home to the town mayor (Maury Chaykin) and family (Susannah Hoffman and Marcella Grimaux), and while Carol is fretting over details, her meandering husband Buddy is secreting an affair with island returnee wannabe cafe owner Sandra Anderson (Rebecca Jenkins), whose libidinous past negatively influences her young daughter Emily (Ellen Page) in her new physical tryst with young Taylor (Caleb Langille).  And while each of these stories unfolds, the town gossip Irene (Mary Ellen MacLean) keeps her evil eye on the soon-to-be-made apparent scandal that video store owner Dan Jarvis (James Allodi), who spends the entire movie attempting variations on suicide, and town painter Duck MacDonald (Callum Keith Rennie) are to be outed as being gay.  It is the strange interplay of each of these lonely, needy characters that brings brilliant focus to the tiny bit of reality that is actually heartfelt.

MacIvor and friends pull off this strange little black comedy with ease and aplomb and the film is a charmer in every way  - from script to cinematography (Rudolf Blahacek) to musical score (Michael Timmins).  This is a splendid little movie that deserves a very wide audience.  Grady Harp, October 07",1191888000,,2203,5.200564971751413
2244126,5,B0007TZV3K,"I stumbled upon this film through an Amazon ""listmania,"" and am very glad I did.  There are no car chases, gun fights, supermodels and so forth, just regular people making it through their days; which is the most interesting sort of film imaginable.  ""Wilby"" touches on issues like bad attitudes towards gays, how golf course development can wreck beautiful wild spaces, and how we sometimes lose ourselves in our pursuit of some illusory future or romances.
""Wilby"" is about people ending fruitless pursuits, and restoring their integrity.

2244127,4,B0007TZV3K,"This is a marvelous ""small"" film.  I don't mean ""small"" to denote anything perjorative.  It is merely that the film tells a small story very close up and personal with a fairly small ensemble cast.  I didn't check the closing credits but there may not have been a special effects coordinator.  The film tells in subtle fashion the story of the lives of several residents of the Canadian island Wilby.  The town looks peaceful enough, but it opening shots reveal a simmering scandal.  The names of individuals who meet at a secluded and undeveloped area of the island -- presumably for homosexual encounters and drug use -- are about to be revealed.  Not coincidentally we see a man climbing onto the rail of a bridge, presumably to jump into the river below.  We later learn that he and another resident of the island were likely to be among the names released.

Very little beyond this happens in the film.  We meet people and witness the small but familiar stresses in their lives.  A police officer (played by the wonderful Paul Gross) who is tempted to have an affair with a woman he went to high school with who has returned to the island to run a diner.  His marriage with a high strung, highly driven realtor (Sandra Oh) is not going well and his wife forces herself to be oblivious to problems they have.  The woman who runs the diner desperately wants to be loved and is concerned her young daughter (played by up and comer Ellen Page, who I loved as Kitty Pryde -- my favorite X-Person -- in THE X-MEN 3) will repeat her mistakes.  The daughter, on the other hand, thinks she has found love with a young boy and is contemplating losing her virginity to him.  The town handyman (played by Callum Keith Rennie, Gross's former costar in DUE SOUTH and one of those delightful, fun loving Cylons on BATTLESTAR GALACTICA) is more or less resigned to his forced outing and is more concerned with reaching out to Dan, his co-conspirator.  Dan, on the other hand, seems more determined to end his life.

Thoreau wrote that the mass of men live lives of quiet desperation and that certainly applies to the residents of Wilby.  These are not happy people and are generally not admirable people, except perhaps for Duck (Rennie's character) who is not only an apparently kind person but also steps in as a hero in saving the young girl from a sexual assault.  But despite all the problems of these decidedly limited souls, the movie ends quite, well, wonderfully.

I liked this movie a great deal.  I'll be honest:  I think the plethora of 5-star ratings is not quite deserved.  To me 5-star ratings should be reserved for unquestionably great films.  This is a very, very nice, good, pleasant, unambitious, small film.  And there is nothing wrong with that.  If you like thoughtful, intelligent films you should definitely see it.  If you have attention deficit disorder you should seek out something else entirely.",1182729600,10,2914,4.673870333988212

For CKR fans, this is one of the most enjoyable roles he's played where his talents are not abused by scripts looking for a brilliant and intense villain.

2244130,5,B0007TZV3K,"""Wilby Wonderful"" is a delightful gem I encountered through the Magnolia Arts Center. This Canadian film was directed by Daniel MacIvor who plays the little role of Stan, a cop that keeps trying to plant drug paraphernalia on a pristine beach to further a plot hatched by the mayor to turn it into a golf course. Unfortunately, Stan doesn't know the difference between an unused insulin needle and a heroin addict's discard. James Allodi who starred this year with Carrie-Anne Moss & Signorey Weaver in ""Snow Cake"" does a great job as the hapless divorcee Dan trying to kill himself rather than come to terms with his attraction to other men. Callum Keith Rennie plays Duck MacDonald, the town workman, who has an attraction to Dan, if he could ever catch him between suicide attempts. MacIvor generates comedy such as in the scene where Sandra Oh happens upon the hanging Dan and we hear the body clunk to the floor as she cuts him down off-camera. We know what's happening and hear it, and laugh harder because we don't see it. Rennie won the Canadian Oscar, the Genie, as best supporting actor for ""Last Night"" and also appeared in ""The Butterfly Effect."" Sandra Oh who has become prominent via the hit TV series ""Grey's Anatomy"" and films like ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" & ""Sideways"" turns in a stellar performance as the real estate woman Carol French who'd rather hide a body in an empty house rather than blow a sale. Her husband is Buddy who is the town cop played by Paul Gross who we saw as the Canadian mountie in the ""Due South"" TV series. Buddy is tempted toward an affair by local restaurant owner Sandra Anderson played by Rebecca Jenkins who was in the ""10.5"" disaster TV movie. She also received a Genie nomination for Best Original Song for ""Wilby Wonderful."" Her daughter Emily has to sort out her relationship with a boy. Emily is played by Ellen Page who currently appears in ""X-Men 3"" and garnered a Best Supporting Actress Genie nomination for ""Wilby Wonderful."" The little cafe patron who hates gays named Irene played by Mary Ellen MacLean also gives a delightful cameo performance. ""Wilby Wonderful"" is a film that speaks about tolerance and people's need to be loved and find love. The characterizations are top drawer in this delightful little gem.

Performances are everything in a film of this nature........and, here, not one of them lets you down. These guys and gals 'put out' what the multi-millionaire, cookie-cutter stars of Hollywood quite often do not. So, just a comment or two concerning them and/or their characterizations:

==Sandra Oh---Gee whiz, where has she dropped out of? If you're a fan of hers from TV's ""Grey's Anatomy"" and think she's the greatest, you ain't seen nothing yet (til you see her here........can there be any wonder why she won a 2006 Golden Globe award?).

==Paul Gross---Playing the 'almost' disillusioned husband and the oh-so-wise town policeman, he sneaks in under our radar and becomes 1 of the main axles of the town of Wilby. He's one of those types we all know who ""keeps things running,"" someone with a mission to do the right thing.

==Rebecca Jenkins & Ellen Page---Being mother and daughter, they bring us into their skins (what tremendous performances).

==James Allodi---As 'one of life's saddest,' he gives us two instants on film when, in the lifeless eyes of a benumbed man undergoing both marriage breakup and devastating lifestyle change, we see appear a ""spark"" (the first a scarily breathtaking moment for us; the second a joyous one---you'll easily recognize them both).

==Callum Keith Rennie---If Allodi's Dan is the one begging redemption in this movie (its ""life-loss"" so to speak), then Rennie is its ""life spark."" Aside from the town policeman, no other is as sensitive to everyone else and their needs as is Duck MacDonald (to be stable, a vehicle needs at least 2 axles; Duck is this town's other). He is amazing in his perceptiveness, his caring, his persistence in landing who he knows to be the ""love of his life."" Showing my partiality (and preferences, I guess) I must say I only wish that every film of a lighter, romantic nature (containing gay aspects, or not), had a Callum Keith Rennie.

Lastly, what great and uplifting closing moments we've been given: the depth of feeling and the emotional intensity reached in the final scene's pairing is palpable, almost overwhelming........perfectly capping a little---but monumental---film belonging in every movie lover's collection.

PS: In its release year, if any film would have been worthy of consideration for one of the several ""Best Ensemble Acting"" awards, this film certainly should have been foremost (I can't believe the multi-cast acting in the recently awarded ""Crash"" could be of any higher caliber).",1142380800,29,2578,5.066037735849057

My favorite character is Callum Keith Rennie (Flower and Garnet)as Duck MacDonald.  He seems simple but he's the wisest one of them all and has a deep understanding of people.

The charcters deal with pointless issues as though they were life-shattering decisions and all of them are shallow to the point of being totally unbeleivable.
The town of Wilby seems only to be occupied only with the characters with dialogue - all of who are cliches and this gives the film a stage-play feel to it. This is odd because plot and character devices from both ""American Beauty"" and even ""Jaws"" are easy to spot.  The main stars, Paul Gross and Rebecca Jenkins generate a kind of anti-chemistry with every other character in the film, especially Ellen Page whose performance as the smart-but-misunderstood-diamond-in-the rough is laughably bad.
Callum Keith Rennie is the only stand-out in a movie that is otherwise amateurish in many ways.  The only thing it gets full marks for is being recognizably Canadian by way of low technical quality and numerous plot holes, instances of poor acting, poor casting and childish outlooks.

It has three stories interwined together making this film a funny, thought-provoking, heartfelt, and wonderful experience. It deals with love, family, homophobia, and relationship. A lot can happen in one day even in a small town like Wilby.

Dan Jarvis(James Allodi) is a video store owner, and his wife just abandoned him, because he's been a closeted gay man. Not able to deal with his coming our issues, he's depressed and suicidal. His house is up for sale, and Carol French(Sandra Oh), a realtor is busy trying to polish it up for resale after taking over it. She is very ambitious and a total perfectionist that she basically ignored the emotional and sexual need of her husband Buddy(Paul Gross) who is cop. She gets very aggravated when the handy-man Buck(Callum Keith Rennie) accidentally made the sign Wilby Wonderful instead Wonderful Wilby. Buck is openly gay, and he had an instant crush on Dan.

Meanwhile, Buddy is frustrated by her unavailable wife, and seeks possible good times with his high school old flame Sandra Anderson(Rebecca Jenkins) who is now a single mother with a teenaged daughter(Emily/Ellen Page). Emily is a rebellious case, and she's being manipulated by a boy for sexual favors. Sandra has feelings for Buddy, but knows he's unattainable.

More dramas and surprises take place and things all unexpectedly improved for these six people despite the chaos they had to endured.

All six leads are superb in their performances. The mother and daughter relationship was very touching and Rebecca Jenkins was perfect for the role of an unhappy single mother. The development of the relationship between Dan and Buck was underwritten, but it was a wonderful and subtle treatment that was kind of romantic. Carol and Buddy had gone from not looking like a married couple at first to finally reconnected and realized the importance of their marriage.

There is a nuanced subtlety to the story, the characters and the acting.  While that description may give the idea that the story and characters are not fully developed and vague, you'd be wrong.

Once again, the reviews failed me, I really wanted to like this movie. From the start with it's tinny, irritating drawn out opening music to the dry, dull, predictable acting, clumsy pace and the who cares overall story-line, it lost my thumbs~up...
