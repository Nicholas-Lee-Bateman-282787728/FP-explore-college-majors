1407668,5,B000059POY,As students 34 yrs ago we raved over this film. I haven't seen it since until I found it recently by accident at Amazon. What a surprise! It maintains all the amusement and freshness of a genre that is seldom executed so well in more recent times. To see some of the great actors in their youth again was a real treat. Scandinavian girls were all the rage in the UK in the 60's and no wonder!!!,996105600,,394,4.12987012987013
1407669,5,B000059POY,"Ewa Aulin stars as the blonde beauty Candy. Her wide-eyed innocence serves her well throughout a series of encounters with a bemused group of movie stars. Among the cast, Walter Matthau particularly shines as an ultra-patriotic general who wants nothing more than a peek at her luscious body, but is soon demanding that she bear him a child! John Astin steals the movie in the dual role of Candy's square, college professor father and her randy, pot-smoking uncle. How Mr. Astin failed to get an Oscar nomination is beyond me. Ringo Starr is totally unconvincing as a Mexican gardener, but his performance adds to the overall absurdity of the film. This Candy is very much an acquired taste!",996019200,3,691,4.864406779661017

Okay, so it is far from the best film ever made, but does that always matter?  Not to me.  This is simply a fun movie.  Overloaded with an amazing 'who's who' cast, a gorgeous heroine and an outstanding soundtrack (which I searched for at record shows and finally found) this film is the 60's incarnate.  A silly, sexy, swinging good time.  The limited edition DVD comes in a cool tin case and has a set of cards with comments and rememberances from most of the major cast members.  It's a treat!",987638400,8,609,4.2894736842105265
1407672,3,B000059POY,"This 60s mockery, certainly among the most-wanted of DVD titles, is finally available in a crisp, widescreen print from Anchor Bay Entertainment.  It's a feminine -- but definitely not feminist -- take on Voltaire's ""Candide"" as imagined through the dirty-old-man mode of screenwriter Buck Henry, and based on Terry Southern's once scandalous novel of the same name.
Fate sends naive, voluptuous, high-schooler Candy Christian (Ewa Aulin) on a journey of sexual discovery.  Along the way, she encounters a surprising array of big name stars (Richard Burton, Walter Matthau, Marlon Brando, James Coburn, John Huston, Charles Aznavour among others), all of whom want to sample delicious, innocent Candy.
This uneven burlesque is sometimes sweet, shocking, embarrassing, hysterical and yes, worth a look.  From the perspective of the 21st century, it's a living time capsule that mirrors elements of the distant sexual revolution and is a glossy attempt at what low budget video porn would later exploited in far more explicit, tedious, mind-numbing detail.

Ewa Aulin in the title role, tears up the screen with her wide eyed sexual innocence, but it is her co-stars that carry the film as each molests her in increasingly more absurd situations.  Dicky Burton opens proceedings as a pretentious University lecturer, with an ever present wind machine blowing at his scarf and hair(even indoors!!!!!), he very soon ends up lying face down in a puddle of whiskey - the biggest stretch any actor has ever made on film!!!!!!!!!!  Ringo Starr plays a hunchbacked mexican gardener, John Astin plays Candy's Father AND Uncle, Walter Matthau plays a gung-ho army commander(!!!!!), the list of famous faces in this abomination is endless!!!!! The fact that the plot makes absolutely no sence, is of little consequence to director Christian Marquand, who relishes the fact that he has a big name cast doing the most unbelievably OTT things, delivering inane/insane dialogue, and generally being as ""out there"" as possible. At all costs, get a copy of this film... if only to have a look at some of the greatest actors of all time making total and utter fools of themselves (well, you would exactly watch it for the plot, would you???!!!).

1407733,2,B000059POY,"I love how Kino Lorber has been releasing plenty of obscure films on Bluray that the major studios won't touch, but after screening CANDY, I can safely say this is one for the resell pile.

Overly long, with a muddled storyline composed of various vignettes that see the titular bodacious blonde ditz getting defiled repeatedly, CANDY has no replay value. Even those seeking a psychedelic time capsule of the late 60s will be disappointed. Aside from some Steppenwolf hits and a Byrds theme song, there are better and more entertaining films that capture the Free Love era. CANDY just doesnt exhibit the hedonistic feel of the eraespecially with set pieces contained in weird operating rooms, military aircraft and gaudy mansions.

The prestigious cast are basically wasted. Ringo Starr is particularly embarrassing as a Mexican gardener, slipping in and out of his British accent. And Richard Burton hits a career low, making love to a mannequin and licking booze off of a mirror glass floor. Anita Pallenberg (BARBARELLA) does a good turn as a sexy nurse and Buck Henry (who wrote this) is amusing as a mental patient. Theres a scene where Candy and two police officers crash the cruiser into a drag ball, sending transvestites scurrying in all directions, but this scene which could have been the highlight of the movie had it been fleshed out, only lasts about 2 minutes.

The print does look fantastic, but you may find yourself bored and waiting for this to end after the first hour. TWO STARS.",1502150400,,1500,4.897637795275591

Buck Henry's description of his friends' reaction to seeing the movie in the Special Features interview was right on point, and exactly my reaction, stunned disappointment.  Yes, even the great Buck Henry can write a stinker on occasion.  I was too young to see this movie when it came out, and the movie virtually disappeared for years, so 48 years later I see why it never came out before on VHS or DVD.  Save your money, this movie is awful.

1407813,4,B000059POY,"I love this quirky Marquand movie, which I view as an episodic ""sketch"" story a-la ""Everything You Wanted To Know About Sex"" if a little less focused than that, and the two interviews, one with the screenwriter, the other with a critic, are great additions. The color seems good, though something the critic said about Richard Burton's scarf left me wondering if the color saturation wasn't quite right.

The only flaw in this version I could detect was that in the ending scene the shot of Candy's father in profile has a bizarre double image and unfocused image artifact, for which I'm dropping a star.

Whether you find the characterizations (and presentations) of McPhisto (Burton), General Smight (Mattheau), Dr Krankheit (Coburn) or Grindl (Brando) - to name just four of my favorite characters - as funny and compelling as I do is a matter of taste.

1407851,2,B000059POY,"Candy focuses on innocent but attractive high school student Candy (Ewa Aulin) and her journey of sexual discovery. The movie is comprised of several vignettes that show Candy in bizarre sexual and close-call encounters with an impressive cast.

During her travels, Candy encounters lust and weirdness from a drunken poet (Richard Burton), a Mexican gardener (Ringo Starr), a patriotic general (Walter Matthau), a mad surgeon (James Coburn), and a mystic Jewish guru (Marlon Brando). These episodes range from very funny to uninspired, with some being simply bizarre. John Astin, Charles Aznavour, John Huston, Elsa Martinelli, and boxing champ Sugar Ray Robinson co-star in this 1968 satire featuring music by The Byrds and Steppenwolf. The screenplay is by Buck Henry (The Graduate), based on the novel by Terry Southern and Mason Hoffenberg.

Its fun to see Burton in his parody of Dylan Thomas with wind machines conveniently blowing his hair and scarf, giving him the look of a handsome artist driven equally by his poetic sensibility and his passion for booze. Other performances, however, are sub-par, with many actors completely missing the comic mark.

Made just as the Production Code was abandoned, Candy was a flawed attempt to deal in a satirical way with a subject that had never been dealt with so openly. Despite its impressive cast, the film reflects the inexperience of director Christian Marquand, who had only directed one other movie five years before Candy.

Bonus features on the Blu-ray release include an interview with screenwriter Buck Henry, interview with film critic and historian Kim Morgan, 2 radio spots, and original theatrical trailer.",1463270400,,1670,5.290566037735849

The movie had two language tracks, English and Italian, so I was able to watch it in English and not have to worry about sub-titles, also available in English and Italian.

On the other hand, great acting might not have helped. It doesn't help the great actors because they mostly play dirty old men. In the late '60s, sex was considered something that made the world go round  and they could get away with it. Since then, it has been demoted from that status. Yet another problem with the film is that it carries out what is currently a dirty joke with stereotypes: the phony poet, the phony guru, the right wing general, the naive teenage, the naive Mexican, the egotistical physician and the sex starved teacher. My final objection is while I am sure, the plot was supposed to come across as surrealistic, it came across to me as stupid. For these reasons, I would stay away from this DVD.

1407857,2,B000059POY,"I was in 8th grade when this film came out so I never saw it until now. It is definitely a product of the 60s era. I can't help but feel it is a square, middle-aged man's fantasy of what he perceives the ""Free Love"" movement to be, and how he would be able to benefit with lots of young, nubile women. (The writer, Buck Henry, was 39 when he wrote it.) The 60s psychedelia backdrop and rock music by popular artists like The Byrds is an attempt to make this film ""hip"" and tries too hard to appeal to the younger generation. I bought this film because Ringo Starr was in it, but he was miscast as a Latino gardener. His acting was not going to garner any Academy awards, but he was cast because he was a Beatle and producers hoped he'd attract the younger audience. I found it intriguing that he accepted this role; he was much better in ""The Magic Christian.""

There's little or no plot as others have said--it's supposed to be a madcap sex romp based on a book of the same name, but it comes off as just a strange mess. I imagine the big-named actors all thought they were doing an edgy, hip art film and agreed to do so in order to update their image and make themselves more appealing to the younger generation but it failed. It just makes them look like hormone-crazed, dirty old sots, desperate to recapture their youth with a luscious, empty-headed high school student. Burton is funny as the alcoholic poet, though he probably was drunk most of the time when making this movie. Ewa Aulin was perfect as the innocent naif Candy that these lecherous men want to deflower. She is in a much better and funnier movie, ""Start The Revolution Without Me"", again playing an innocent naif. She was an incredibly beautiful actress, but later claimed this film ruined her career, as she was forever typecast as the ""Blonde Nymphet"" in the film industry. It is a shame that Hollywood couldn't see her soft, exquisite beauty and cast her in better roles. She made only 18 movies.

The beginning of the film looks like an acid trip, complete with hard-edged rock music; it plays way too long and gets tiresome. This sets the tone for an unbearably long, hard-to-watch film. The film has its historical merits in that it does feature Ringo Starr in addition to other big-name stars and it reflects the ""Over 30"" Generation's interpretation ofs the ""Free Love"" era of the 1960s. I understand this was one of the first films to be rated ""X"" in the theaters, but it would be considered pretty tame now.",1405123200,4,2491,4.472527472527473
1407858,3,B000059POY,"Candy directed by Christian Marquand is one of those odd films that could only have been the product of the late sixties. Based on the novel by Terry Southern and loosely adapted from Voltaire's novel Candide, the film follows the adventures of a young innocent who must navigate her way through a world of men that she has a strange power over.

Candy Christian (Ewa Aulin) first appears to the audience as an almost other worldly being before we realize that she is simply a day dreaming high school student in one of her father's (John Astin) classes. From this point on we follow Candy on an almost psychedelic journey with the men who float in and out of her life. Marquand brings a high powered stars along on this journey. First up is a booze addled Welch poet (Richard Burton) who seduces Candy in his Mercedes. The Mexican gardener (Ringo Starr) gives up any hope of the priesthood after meeting her. After these misadventures Candy's family attempts to have her sent to boarding school with her uncle (also, John Astin).On the way we have encounter with a general(Walter Matthau) who has been in a plane way two long and a pair of surgeons (James Coburn and John Houston) who also attempt to seduce the girl. Perhaps. the strangest encounter is with a guru who lives in the back of a truck who attempts to shoe Candy the true meaning of life( Marlon Brando).

If all of this sounds strange it is. This movie would be great at midnight and has become something of a cult classic with its over the top acting and script. Buck Henry  attempted to satirize all of the then popular porn conventions in his script and while he does a good job the film at times feels dated. The music by the Bryds and Steppenwolf  fits the time period perfectly however.

The film has become something of a collector's item and I was only able to screen the region 2 disc from Italy. The disc features a decent English soundtrack but the credits and some inserted material are only in Italian. I'm not sure  if the disc was edited in any way but there appears to be a difference in the running time of this version from the more rare American version. There are no special features to speak of on the disc.

1407881,5,B000059POY,"This much-maligned and vastly underrated French-Italian film, based on the satirical novel by Terry Southern and Mason Hoffenberg, is like no other film ever made. Despite some superficial resemblances to ""Barbarella"" and ""The Magic Christian,"" it truly stands on its own. The dialogue from Buck Henry's screenplay stays faithful to the novel and the film itself moves along, driven by its own irreverent, stylish momentum. In the title role, EwaAulin became a pop culture figure because of this one role. As the innocent, naive high school girl Candy Christian, she proved unequivocally could not portrayed the character in quite the same way she did. This esoteric late 1960s comedy also features appropriately esoteric performances by Richard Burton, James Coburn and Marlon Brando, among several others. Under the stylish direction of Christian Marquand, despite its inability to be truly appreciated in America, this unique film takes the viewer on a wild, swinging, almost chaotic journey that never lets up

1407886,4,B000059POY,"This 60's satire, treasured among cult film fans of a certain age is hard to find but still available in a crisp, widescreen transfer.  It's a feminine -- but definitely not feminist -- take on Voltaire's ""Candide"" as imagined through the dirty-old-man mode of screenwriter Buck Henry, and based on Terry Southern's once scandalous novel of the same name.  As the ads once said: ""...Everybody wants a taste.""

Fate sends naive, voluptuous, high-schooler Candy Christian (Ewa Aulin) on a journey of sexual discovery.  Along the way, she encounters a surprising array of big name stars (Richard Burton, Walter Matthau, Marlon Brando, James Coburn, John Huston, Charles Aznavour among others), all of whom want to sample delicious, innocent Candy.

This uneven burlesque is sometimes sweet, barely shocking, often embarrassing and worth a look at a retro genre of pseudo naughty farce.  From the perspective of the 21st century, it's a time capsule that mirrors elements of the distant sexual revolution.  It's a glossy attempt at what low budget video porn would later exploit in far more explicit, tedious, mind-numbing detail.

Christian Marquand directed.  The music is by Steppenwolf and The Byrds!  And whatever happened to the luscious Ewa Aulin?",1267660800,,1250,5.267676767676767
1407887,3,B000059POY,"The title character of this wacky, uneven comedy, Candy Christian, has a beguiling innocence and nubile figure that entices every man she meets. Her manner with them is inquisitive and soft.
The men are prominent and include Doctor Krankheit, a famous neuro-surgeon (James Coburn) and the Indian guru Grindle (Marlon Brando). They urgently want a piece of Candy, but their feelings for her are ambivalent because their desire is confounded by their professional etiquette or dignity, like a skin they wear as a matter of career survival, but which is incongruent with making love to such a free spirit. As a result, they are strict and controlling, as if to banish doubt. Coburn is good; Brando is a far cry from his Terry Malloy and Stanley Kowalski roles and is the funniest person in the movie.
Film critics generally derided the movie when it appeared in 1968. Some of their criticisms were correct; instances of sloppy casting and mediocre acting; but the critics may also dislike movies that satirize middle-aged professionals confronted with something risque. Truffaut's ""The Soft Skin"" and Rohmer's ""La Collectioneuse"" deal with similar predicaments, albeit not as flamboyantly or unevenly.
Recreational drug use may have contributed to ""Candy's"" uneveness, but the soundtrack by Dave Grusin and the Byrds is memorable, as is the countercultural, psychedelic aura of this cult classic.

This is a psychedelic ""Candide"" story. Our heroine, Candy, travels around the world and encounters a number of men, all weirder than the last. The supporting cast is excellent. Walter Matthau plays a sex starved general, Richard Burton a pretentious, self obsessed, alcoholised poet. Ringo Starr plays the Mexican gardener and Marlon Brando makes a hilarious performance as an Indian guru.

The film is two hours long and the story is thin, but it kept my interest up. It is filled with humour that is sometimes too dry for its own good, but whether you laugh with the movie or at the movie, it's still lots of fun. This is a one-of-a-kind movie that's not for everybody's taste, but it's definately worth checking out.",1149724800,8,965,4.738095238095238

 This film was horrendous. The ever-virgin Ewa Aulin (only 18 at the time of filming) goes from one scence to another molested by a different man each time - all just failing to get the goodies.

 It's got a big name cast Charles Aznavour, Marlon Brando, Richard Burton, James Coburn, and John Hustin but that's all I can say positive about this film

 Also, I checked out [...] which says it's based on Voltaire's ""Candide"", and having read the book I saw nothing in the film that relates to it.",1090713600,10,644,4.508620689655173
1407902,4,B000059POY,"This satire, based on Terry Southern's novel of the same name, does not have the book's bite and is dated, but it is still loads of fun, with a tremendous cast and crew. As a matter of fact, probably the only principle you will not know is the star -- Swedish teen model Ewa Aulin, who is absolutely stunning (in a blonde naive pouty way) in her acting debut. Everyone else is quite recognizable -- Richard Burton as the narcissistic poet with a giant need, Ringo Starr as a Mexican gardener with political issues, James Coburn as an ego-driven surgeon, John Astin as the lecherous uncle, Walter Matthau as a megalomaniacal general, Charles Aznavour as a physically handicapped criminal and Marlon Brando as a guru travelling in the back of a semi. (If it sounds bizarre, that's because it is!)

The crew is nothing to sneeze at, either, wih Doug Trumbull (Blade Runner) on special effects, Fellini cinematographer Giuseppe Rotunno behind the camera, Buck Henry writing the script, and Dave Grusin (with the help of The Byrds and Steppenwolf) writing the music. Unfortunately the weak link is director Christian Marquand, who rarely seems in control of his actors or the action.
I'm puzzled about the film's advertising, which asks ""Is Candy faithful? Only to the book!"" because it seems inappropriate to ask if Candy is faithful to anyone here. Rather, she is continually and persistently accosted by older men who abuse her trusting and giving nature in order to use her body. How can she be faithful to lechers who want one-night stands? It seems that the marketing guys are using poor Candy too!

The film is definitely flawed but marvelously entertaining in a time-warp-ish way. Aulin is just beautiful, and it's great fun to watch Burton and Brando and all the rest ham it up. If Marquand had had a better grip on things, this could have been a classic. As it is, it's a curiosity that will probably entice you to read the book and look for other Aulin films!

The dvd has decent extras including: a trailer, radio spots, stills and interesting cast & crew bios.",1075075200,18,2068,4.754874651810585
1407903,3,B000059POY,"Based on the 'notorious' book by Terry Southern & Mason Hoffenberg (first published by French Olympia Press), ""Candy"" became an instant cult film when it was released.  Not that this is superb or has atristic merits.  On the contrary, the film is actually a hopeless case of loosely-constructed mansion which does not know where to go, or what to do.  But the cast and crew included here is so impressive and the atmosphere of the film is so 60s-like, that you might forgive these fatal defects ... almost.
Swedish Eva Aulin is Candy, a pudgey-faced, cute college student.  In spite of herself (or because her innocence, I say) many guys are lured to her, mostly sexually, and shows their hidden side of character.  The respectable facet of their career is torn down before Candy.  Or, in short, they all want to taste candy.
Many famous faces show up here; Richard Burton, Walter Matthau, James Coburn, John Huston, and Ringo Starr (yes, that's one of the Beatles).  You see each actor one after another, doing some silly things, acting the part of showy professoer (Burton), crazy general (Matthau), super-surgeon (Coburn), his supervising boss (Huston), and naive Mexican (Starr).  And finally, you see Marlon Brando as Guru Grindl.  All these are meant for satire of the time, but looking back from now, the caricatures lost inevitably the impact.  (Still, Brando's 'frozen guru' is funny even now.)
More interesting is the crew; the director is a French actor Christian Marquand, whose CV includes ""Apocalypse Now: Redux"" (look for him in the French plantation scene which was originally deleted).  Maybe I should not say this, but the film's slack way of storytelling is largely due to him, considering the fact that the script is provided by Buck Henry.  But of course, Buck Henry can do mistakes.
The greatest thing about the film is probably its soundtrack by Dave Grusin (!), which features the songs of The Steppenwolf and The Byrds.  In fact, any Byrds fans should know the work, and the phychedelic rock sound is still refreshing and thrilling to hear.  And the opening/closing special effects are by Douglas Trumbull, who is to direct ""The Silent Running,"" and be the supecial effects supervisor of ""Blade Runner.""",1072310400,2,2228,4.954301075268817
1407904,2,B000059POY,"I have never in my life been more confused by a movie. The title I selected for this review was intoned somberly by mystical guru Marlon Brando. As I couldn't sum the movie up better myself, I therefore selected the quote as representative of the quality dialogue found in 'Candy.' If you watch this movie, you will know what I mean.
I am actually quite a fan of campy and strange films, and enjoy plotlines gone wildly astray (think 'Red Zone Cuba' here, for instance), but this takes it to a whole new level, that being the level of having no identifiable plot whatsoever to begin with. I watched this movie twice, and was still trying to figure it out when it was done the second time. It is, evidently, a coming of age fable/parable about Candy, a lovely young woman played by Ewa Aulin.
The general operating concept here seems to be pitting Candy against any number of totally unsuitable middle age suitors, and hilarity (in theory) ensues. First there is the John Astin father figure with an electrical outlet in his head (into which a radio playing Steppenwolf is often plugged) who desperately needs a complex surgery performed by James Coburn, who is quite mad. Other potential trysting partners include Walter Matthau as an insane paratrooper, Ringo Starr as a Mexican Gardner, and my personal favorite, Richard Burton, as a scenery chewing poet who has lines like this: ""The wind whipped strawberry passion of my fractured spleens.""
Two stars for the supporting cast alone. The execution here is quite dismal courtesy of director Christian Marquand. If you want to have a rather bad headache or are possibly under the influence of hallucinogenic substances, this movie is perfect for you.",1063324800,7,1700,4.845360824742268

The movie was deservedly savaged by critics and avoided by moviegoers.  The best excuse I can find for it is that it was made during a time of many studio restrictions. and could be a truly funny independent film today.",1053388800,8,477,4.471264367816092

 What I think is the main reason for people disliking this movie is that it wasn't what they expected it to be.  It's trippy and a little weird at times.  The music is also amazing.  If you don't like Steppenwolf or the Byrds, perhaps you shouldn't bother.

If there is, it's: bunch of Hollywood heavies try to cheese their way into young unknown's, um, affections. I read about this film, but if I hadn't it would seem more like an excuse for some middle aged stars to get together and try to tassel with a hot young vixen, than a collection of good talent trying to make a comedic film.  Well, I'm sure Buck Henry and Christian Marquand said they were making an art film and everybody bought it.  I can't believe it got made (with this cast though, who wouldn't make it?).  But hey, good for them.
Now I said I thought it was bad, but it did have some redeeming qualities.  Several of these guys are pretty funny, some are not.  Brando's bit was good and I laughed at Coburn too.  Burton was hillarious.  Starr, Matthau, and Huston don't fair as well, but their material wasn't as good.  And then there is the sweetness herself, Eva Aulin.  Wow, she is hot.  Oh the poor girl, she looks way too innocent to blame for no script.  Anyone who didn't know better would have taken the part to act next to these guys.

1407908,2,B000059POY,"I actually saw this movie in a theater when I was young enough to be considered fit for active duty in the U.S. Army.  In fact, I was in active duty in the U.S. Army.  Most of my weekends were spent at Fort Knox, Kentucky, for my first several months of basic training, but I finally had the opportunity to go into Louisville on a Saturday night.  I was old enough to buy hard liquor, and I was old enough to see this movie, and I did both in the same weekend.  This was before I heard the ""Thinks he's Audie Murphy"" joke which made my experiences in the army so enjoyable, now that I have survived.  The thing about Audie Murphy that was funny was that he got to play his own part in a movie, ""To Hell and Back,"" after World War II, an event that was considered worthy of inclusion in history books in the 20th century, when most things didn't make any more sense than the movie, ""Candy.""  Honestly, if you tried to tell the world that the United States hardly did anything in the big one until it had secretly built a couple atom bombs, and wouldn't even declare war officially on anyone until it was sure it would have a chance to incinerate a few cities before the ceasefire would end the opportunity to blow people away, hardly anyone would know that you were leaving anything out.
  Back to Audi Murphy:  the stars in this movie (would you believe that one is named Ringo Starr?) were given the opportunity to play themselves as somebody else, but there is something about the roles these people play that hyperbolically exceeds what anyone else could say about them.  Like, who could imagine Richard Burton as a drunk lush, acting the part of stuporous impotence in the presence of young willingness?  James Coburn overstating everything with exuberant pride might be expected, but how could such a clown, Walter Matthau, be the perfect caricature of what everyone thinks in the U.S. Army?  Maybe it was such a shock to me because Walter Matthau seemed to be thinking what I was thinking, back in that theater in Louisville, Kentucky, when I was really in the U.S. Army, in training for a mission to hell.
  Audie Murphy is not in this movie, but that might be because everybody said that after he went to Hollywood, he was nibbled to death by a bunch of ducks.

 You got that right, sister.

 ""Citizen Kane"" finally made it to DVD. Who cares? So has ""Candy""!
 To humiliate its ""star,"", Ewa Aulin, all over again. Anchor Bay's release of the 1969 film has lovely picture qualities. The colors are bright. The look of the film has been preserved and enhanced beautifully. There is depth of image. The film is garbage, but it looks great. It about destroyed my mental.
  I didn't take drugs in those groovy cool times.  This is why. Because I would have conjured up something like this endless bag of hot gas. With this movie,  I wanted nostalgia. I should have stuck a fork in my eye instead. Which, come to think of it, this is. ""Candy"" is based on the novel by Terry Southern and Mason Hoffenberg (just who was Mason Hoffenberg anyway?) which was a satirical, satyrical (it's the level we're on here) retelling of ""Candide."" Yeah, sure. That gave us an
excuse to read it in the Student Lounge and on the quad and to pretend we were culturally mature.
 HA! If our dorm room walls could have talked. ""Candy""--the novel is--hot. Better even than ""The Hand Reared Boy."" Candide, Flandide, who cares? I circled the good parts in my copy with my pen. There were a lot of them.
 The movie, which I had never seen till this DVD, has no good parts to circle. Ewa Aulin was terrifically beautiful. She's got the stupid kewpie doll thing down pat. The second grade leer of the male lechers and the film makers is all here. STARS want to ""deflower"" her.  Tiresomely.
 Charles Aznavour is a hunchback who crawls on walls and the ceiling, and he flies!!  James Coburn is a mad mad cap doctor who performs bloody brain surgery to a theatre crowd, and knows the difference between a human and a spider monkey--which is apparently what Aznavour portrays.
 Marlon Brando is a guru with a far out wig and a dot on the forehead. He sits cross legged, and blithers, in his hippie dippie world in the back of a truck, with lots of neat psychedelic wall hangings,  then, tumbles with our heroine, and blithers, as only Marlon can. Richard Burton is, well, Richard Burton, and he is truly funny in wonderful self parody. Walter Matthau is a mad quasi-military yoo hoo--and also is excellent.
 We've got wanna be fragments of: comedy, a bit of camp horror, an attempt at surrealism, an attempt at a fantasy, an attempt at knocking the Establishment (that made this movie incidentally)and those who did the knocking, or pretend they did.
And a lot of irritating rock music of the time that reminds me why I hated most rock music of the time. Mostly we've got a stuffed turkey dead duck flailing around that tries to be everything the sixties was supposed to be over the place. Barbarella Psychedella--come home. All is forgiven.
 The BIOS on the disc list the various crash and burns the film caused. Including the start of Brando's downward spiral. So that's a good thing.
 But we don't see Ewa good and naked, and that's just cruel. I almost cried. Just close ups of parts of her, and a silhouette. They probably used a body double.  There are some funny shrewd lines. And a few neat put downs. Mostly though it labors. The limp love-in at the film's end nails the coffin tight. ""Candy"" is of course stupid beyond all
measure. It wrecked careers. Embittered Ewa. It did the true deflowering of Candy Christian.
 But it would have been worth it for one crummy four second nude scene of her. ""Myra Breckinridge"" will be on DVD soon-- I just know it. Will I buy it? Of course. I'm something of a spider monkey myself.

Candy is completely unfunny, if not depressing. Poor Richard Burton, licking whiskey off the floor! The various targets for its satire are the military (edgy!), surgeons (they asked for it!), mysticism (take that!), the police (burn!) and intellectual pop idols (huh?). The references to sex and drugs have lost whatever titillation/shock value they might have had thirty years ago, so don't expect to get much payoff out of John Astin with the joint behind his ear or the big transvestite scene. It's not particularly sexy, either. Who wants to see Walter Matthau, Ringo Starr or a hunchbacked Charles Aznavour manhandling a lobotomy patient? (I'm sure Ewa Ulin is/was a very nice person with lots of great qualities, but come on).
Connoisseurs of the weird will prize this movie, but, to whatever degree one can be objective about these things, Candy is not a good film. There's nothing particularly fun, witty, or meaningful about it. It's just embarassing. And honestly, I've seen much weirder.

The film was considered outrageous in its day but it seems pretty tame by ""modern' standards. Ringo Starr received good reviews when the movie was released but in retrospect his performance is almost embarrassingly poor. But the incongruous cameos by a few of the biggest stars of the day are a great part of the film's appeal. (Remember, this was one of the first ""X"" rated films to be seen in wide release and, goodness, there were FAMOUS people involved!)
Sir Richard Burton is riotous as are Marlon Brando, Walter Matthau and James Coburn, but the cohesive bond in the whole plot is the dual performance by John Astin who portrays Candy's stuffed-shirt father as well as her lecherous uncle, Jack. And, not too surprisingly, Ewa Aulin is still ravenously beautiful as the naive nymphet, Candy!
Another shining attribute is Dave Grusin's soundtrack, very 60's, no doubt, but in the end it actually holds up better than film. Songs and incidental pieces by The Byrds and Steppinwolf sound fresh and invigorating.

The drugged out humor is quite dated but many of the jokes work well - Brando does a fabulous job as the guru and John Austin is a panic (as he always is). However the very ending will blow your mind and you'll have to think about it for a while.
As a previous reviewer had said, ""they don't make them like this anymore"" is a trusim - then again I don't think they would allow them to make one like this anymore (or no one would have the guts to do so).

What a lineup!
It turns out that those five all play exaggerated cariacatures of their roles, the uncle (Astin), a mystic who travels across the country in the back of a diesel truck (Brando), a drunken poet who struts like a rock star and whose hair blows constantly as if having a personal wind machine around him (Burton), a surgeon whose operating theatre is like an actual theatre, complete with audience looking down at his performance (Coburn), a general who has been airborne without the company of women for way too long, and a hunchback (Aznavour), all of them trying to score with Candy.
The opening scene is a true stunner--the appearance of a ball of heavenly light in outer space, the scene shifting to various galaxies, with the heavenly light coming to the familiar blue-green planet of Earth.  The camera then pans along a desert, a stretch of cracked earth, and then the ball of light materializes into a covered white sheet.  The sheet unfurls to reveal our beautiful heroine--Candy Christian, who gazes at the camera with a dazed but sensual look.  She gives us the briefest glimmer of a smile, nothing more.
While the next scene revealed that she was in her father's class daydreaming and that she was an Earth girl, I kind of wonder if she was an extraterrestrial, and that scene told of her arrival to Earth.  The Byrds' ""Child Of The Universe"" playing over the closing credits also lend credence to that theory.
The 60's rock guitar score provides a bit of nostalgia, of a style of music and movies that bely a period long gone.  And Candy predates Star Wars by nine years in having only the opening titles without launching into the credits.
Standout scenes--In the hunchback's hideout, the hunchback's friends douse them with pillow feathers (ground shot looking up) while they are making love on a piano (ground shot), whose strings ring with a discordant sound provide a psychedelic moment.  And the various of bogus mystic Grindle (Brando), as he and Candy bend themselves into awkward sexual yoga positions, with the sheets squirming amoeba-like inbetween each position change.  His parable of the pig and the flower seems a cynical denunciation of the classic princess and frog fairy story.
Candy is the most decent of all the characters in that movie.  If she isn't being accosted by all these males trying to get into her pants--including her own uncle (!!), she is arrested by a pair of Mutt and Jeff cops, verbally abused by other females (e.g. the doctor's mother, disguised as a cleaning lady, or the doctor's chief nurse and chief piece of skirt, who is jealous of her).
 The sick twist ending in the book is diluted somewhat in the movie, but it's there nevertheless.  Then there's the final scene of her walking among the people who took or tried to take advantage of her in the scene not unlike a convention held by the Society of Creative Anachronisms, with her pure white virginal robe gaining a flower print and her head gaining a crown of flowers.  Were the flowers a symbol not of love but of the stains of ""human beings"" that soiled her, or did the flowers stand for the universal love she believed in?  And with the starfield scene reappearing at the closing credits, did Candy turn back into that ball of light and set out across the universe for somewhere more civilized than this sick planet Earth, where she was besmirched over and over?
Finally, I'm sick and tired of reading all these negative things about Ewa Aulin.  Okay, so she looks like rape-bait with that innocent look and short skirt, speaks like she was drinking Nyquil like it was Coca Cola, and eyes that alternate between being drooped as a result of said Nyquil and that deer-caught-in-the-headlights look.  The point is, she succeeds as that well-meaning idealist or alien who truly believed in that idea of giving freely of oneself. After one look at that dazed sensual gaze, all I want to do is just hold her in my arms and tell her I love her for what she is.",997142400,73,4309,4.701195219123506
7933778,3,B000059POY,"I really only bought this movie because I saw it as a youngster when it first came out. I was mesmerized by the beautiful Ewa Aulin. At the time it
was pretty daring for a pubescent boy to see, as some of the scenes with Aulin are very sexy. The most disappointing aspect of the movie is that
producer, director had all these great actors who were wasted on such a terribly written screenplay. Buck Henry (who wrote it) must have been on
LSD when he wrote the ridiculous, weird, often boring scenes. Ironically, again 50 years later,  the only thing still good about this movie is the sexy
and beautiful perfection of Aulin. If not for Aulin, this film would be considered nothing but celluloid garbage. I gave it 3 stars for Aulin and the major
actors who did the best they could with such a piece of crap script.",1521936000,,814,4.3907284768211925
7933779,3,B000059POY,"I finally saw this film after years of reading about it in books on the Beatles and sixties movies. It did not disappoint!  I expected a fun ""bad movie"" watch in the vein of Ed Wood or Russ Meyer...Candy is a surprisingly witty and well written project.  Yes, it`s a film of its time, complete with  dayglo colors and campy moments, but it has held up well.  The story is a satire of porno conventions and also satirizes the social tends of the Sixties, from the General`s blustery jingoism to pop poet Mcfisto`s equally misguided ideas on art.  Since it skewers the human shortcomings of lust, greed, and love of power, there`s a timeless quality to be found here.

Candy herself, played by winsome Ewa Aulin, , is a nave and likeable young woman who is constantly bemused by the self centered men who desire her.  Instead of materialism, she values  family and the enjoyment of life.  At times she seems based on the sexual yet inherently innocent characters portrayed by Marilyn Monroe: she doesn`t seek partners who have money or social standing and  enjoys an encounter with a hunchbacked con man more than all the others.  Many may call this film sexist, but the writers viciously lampoon the male characters and go easier on the women, especially Candy herself.

Good performances from Richard Burton, Ringo Starr, and the always delightful John Astin as both Candy`s father and depraved yet hilarious uncle.  The soundtrack is great, with free wheeling instrumentals and songs by Steppenwolf and the Byrds.  It`s well worth a view , especially if you enjoy dry/satirical humor.  Candy is a b movie that transcends the genre in many ways! Don`t believe the bad mouthing  on this 1960`s gem.",1520899200,,1697,4.8
7933780,3,B000059POY,"I remember when the movie came out, and I couldn't wait to see it, due to all the hype.  After all these years, it really hasn't worn that well.  There are two memorable performances that are worth the price of the product.  The drunkenness of Richard Burton, and the wonderful Walter Matthau and his paratroopers. I feel the Ringo Starr segment went on just too long.  Rated R?  That might have been for the time it was shown, but now it probably would get a PG-13.",1517356800,,466,4.372093023255814

Charles Aznavour comes off as lost in the film as I remember him. But o so gallic! No blond female (cept BB) can pull off a constant pout like Ewe Aullin. Richard Burton lurches & leaches like the pro he was. Not one bad cameo in this series of cameos. The best is saved for last,Marlon method man Brando.
