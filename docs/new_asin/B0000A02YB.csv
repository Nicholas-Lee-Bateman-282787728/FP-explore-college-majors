1900085,5,B0000A02YB,"More antics and adventures from the crack(pot) employees of Grace Brothers.  While Vol. 11 falls shorter than most, it's a good thing everybody's funnybone is a little different than each others.

Vol 11 is comprised of four titles from one year and two from another.  As the years passed the writing, like numerous other srriea long in th  tooth, began to suffer.  Auch well.  As a loyal fan, it's still worth watching.",1404864000,,420,4.763888888888889

1900091,5,B0000A02YB,"I am a great fan of AYBS. I will leave the plot breakdowns to better writers than I, just to say that I spent hours sitting and watching and laughing and enjoying these episodes that I have never seen on American TV as far as I know. The replacements for Mr. Grainger and Mr. Lucas and Mr. Grace are all new to me until now. Great show. I will watch this one over again and will look for more of the later shows in this series.",1202515200,,427,3.9767441860465116
1900092,4,B0000A02YB,"--Mrs. Solcombe advertising her ladies' underwear department.
Of the volumes in the second boxed set of this series (Seasons 6-10), volume 11 is the second best behind volume 9.  4 of the 6 episodes are 5-star.  The only one that is dicey is ""Roots?""  This episode, which was not shown on some PBS stations, has the staff researching Old Mr. Grace's family lines.  Things get racially controversial when the staff puts on a show revealing Grace's ""roots.""  The other weak episode is ""Conduct Unbecoming.""  Mr. Humphries is accused of stealing money from the till and is put on trial.  The ""court"" scene is dull. One funny part of this episode is Capt. Peacock's pursuit of Miss Belfridge.
The other shows are excellent, especially ""The Erotic Dreams of Mrs. Slocombe"" which is one of my favorite post-Mr. Lucas episodes. Here, Mrs. Slocombe has the unrequited hots for Mr. Humphries.  The staff reads a psychological report on the matter and it is decided that if Mr. Humphries ""has a go at her"" she'll be rid of the fantasies.  Miss Brahms tries to help Mr. Humphries ""have a go"" in the box seats at the ballet.  ""Closed Circuit"" has the staff making a video advertisement to play outside the store.  The director is a ""friend"" of Mr. Humphries and their interaction is hilarious. In ""Heir Apparent,"" introducing the boring Mr. Klein, Old Mr. Grace sees an old picture of Mr. Humphries' mother and announces that he left her in a certain ""condition.""  Humphries' mother makes an appearance in the store to this man from her past.  In ""Sweet Smell of Success,"" Capt. Peacock reluctantly allows Mrs. Slocombe to sell her homemade perfume in the store that is promoted as attracting the opposite sex.  Then, he finds out it may work too well.
This DVD, like the others, has fun graphics on the menu pages with rotating photos of ""Employee of the Month"" Mr. Harmon and a lift conductor taking you to each episode.  For those who want to try a post-Mr. Lucas volume of the series, volume 11 is the best one.",1074470400,2,2003,4.699140401146132
