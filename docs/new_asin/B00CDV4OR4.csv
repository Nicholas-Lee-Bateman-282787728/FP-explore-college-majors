5716624,5,B00CDV4OR4,"what you get:
2 dvds
2 blu ray disks: 6 episodes on 1 Blu ray, 4 on the other as well as some extra goodies

personally this should have been released at the beginning of the year but i digress

fist off, to not spoil i will be general in my description

Fairy tail is back in another action packed season. the first few episodes are fluff, no real point other than some good old fairy tail caused laughs and hysterics.

old friends return in this season, as well as new ones, to help out our favorite team of fairy tail  on their quests.

for fans of natsu, the bane of flame is back with hunger,a fire in his belly...and motion sickness???

the celestial maiden is back, lucy is showing off her fashion sense in a variety of cloths as well as some fan favorites and with the ever popular PLU.

for  fans of gray, out favorite ice wizard is back, showing off and being cool,...and stripping....GRAY YOUR CLOTHS!

the queen of fairys is back, with blades, new armor, and a hatred of..... columns? titania erza  is here!.

all these plus our other fairy tail members are present so don't be sad, be glad and join the fun.

ok now onto my review lol, i felt this part 1 went by fast i have re-watched it 3 times already and its still good, but leaves you on a cliff hanger, but part 2 is out in a few weeks, (just hope its price drops).

overall i believe fairy tail is one of the best modern animes around, it has things for all ages and brings a lot to the table without being repetitive or stale, and will always have the ability to inspire those who watch it. so my only complaint is that it was to quick to watch, other than that no issues and highly recommend it",1374710400,,1666,4.19811320754717
5716625,4,B00CDV4OR4,"i haven't gotten my copy ,but i know i got the other volumes funimation realsed. i got say i was into the anime when i got the manga it is really good. so i think the fairy tail anime is something worth getting. i not sure if they dub all of it cause there alot to dub. but hey alteast it something.",1374710400,,299,3.838709677419355

5716643,4,B00CDV4OR4,"This is a good series, it filled the void that bleach left in me by its downward spiral in quality.  So far in this series there has only been two episodes I've had to fast forward past because the story and voice acting of the villain was terrible.  I enjoy the manga also but am kinda burned out on all the sexuality the author feels he needs to express.  I feel this story and the characters are strong enough on their own that they don't need panty shots and the nude scenes for shock factor.  Maybe the author is just sexually frustrated with his life and can only express those feelings through his manga?  I dunno but I'm not anti-sex its just this series is so neat and I feel it does not need any of that.",1439942400,,714,4.182481751824818

It introduces the lovable Wendy and her cat friend Carla (or Charlie as the manga says) as they fight one of the dark guilds known as ""Oracion Seis."" The fighting is more slowly paced than previous arcs and some of the members aren't quite as memorable (looking at you Racer) but the arc is still as thrilling as one could expect from Fairy Tail. So check it out if you have liked previous episodes.",1398556800,,515,4.48936170212766

5716687,4,B00CDV4OR4,"Funimation did a great job on making this anime's dub. The only thing I wish they would do ( but they need to make money) is release more episodes together instead of 12 at a time.

But if you are a fan, and you have to have it RIGHT NOW. I guess I can understand buying it. Plus, as ridiculous as the prices can be, anime is a fairly niche market, and it really does rely on strong dvd sales. So if you have tons of expendable income, I can recommend this. But if you are like me, and do not want to spend 30 bucks on a dvd with only eleven 23 minutes episodes, wait for the collection.",1379548800,,529,3.9074074074074074

5716712,5,B00CDV4OR4,"It has been a while since the release of Fairy Tail for fans to enjoy wit Blu-ray quality. First let's review the basic economics of this package. You get 12 episodes with this package, while having to usual special commentary episodes and trailers for around $30 (what i paid). This works out to $2.50 for a 25 min episode. Some might find that a bit steep but consider the fact that FUNimation is bringing this to us from Japan and the voice actors, directors, translators all need to get paid for their hard work. That being said, looking at the crossed out price for this volume and the current next volume set for $47 (almost $4 an episode!) is asking much. Especially considering how the 2nd disc only has the last 4 episodes, leaving me feeling that 4 more could have been put into this volume if they are going to put 8 on the first disc. FUNimation take note!! Don't get greedy and alienate your fans! I think $24-30 for new release is fair enough though.

Now for the content. The first few episodes are just like prior in-between story arc episodes that were very humorous and entertaining with hints of the coming conflict. Then the story begins to really unfold as familiar faces begin to reappear as allies or foes to keep you on the edge of wondering what happens next. There were a few shocking surprises I didn't see coming as well as those that appeared to be predictable before taking a sudden deviation from what I expected. The story goes to highlight how Fairy Tail's strongest team continue to grow as individuals as well as in their abilities. That is a plus as the stagnation of character growth can wear a series down. No such feeling with this saga.

This arc ties into past arcs as Fairy Tail members and their allies take on more powerfully dangerous wizards. It contains all the elements fans of this series enjoy with the quirky humor, action, great story, and lovable characters. The English voice actors continue to be amazing in their capturing the variety of emotions and quirkiness of the series. I definitely recommend continuing the adventure with this volume. If you are new to Fairy Tail, I highly recommend to start watching this series from the beginning and strong recommendation as a must have to any anime fan's collection! It is certainly one of those rare series I will keep coming back to.",1375142400,,2337,4.628915662650602
