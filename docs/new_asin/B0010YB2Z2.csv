8239381,3,B0010YB2Z2,"You get what you pay for - really, having the defunct ""Coral Ridge Ministries"" tell you about Islam is about an unbiased exposition as having&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Martin-Luther-tell-you-about-Jews/dp/1593640242/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Martin Luther tell you about Jews</a>. It's a great DVD featuring the ""who was who"" in Christian apologetics to Muslims made by and for the conservative Christian that more critical readers could do without.

""Islam: religion of peace?"" is a Coral Ridge special report DVD presenting the most provocative elements of Islam as the mainstream that gives a short history of Islam, theological differences between the Bible and Koran, a speech by Dr. Walid Phares on radical Islam, and a witness testimony by&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Steven-Masood/dp/1850780986/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Steven Masood</a>, a Muslim convert to Christianity.  Its an all-star production - consisting of only 45 minutes and four options in the DVD menu, it features concise explanations of Islam by its critics like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ravi-Zacharias/dp/1576739899/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ravi Zacharias</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Robert-Spencer/dp/0895260131/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Robert Spencer</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/James-White/dp/076421215X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">James White</a>&nbsp;pointing the inconsistencies of the Islamic faith to show that it really is hostile based on half truth.  You know, when you put any religion under the microscope, any religion is hostile and based on half-truths.

In full disclosure, I am not a fan of D. James Kennedy or his Coral Ridge Ministries (later changed to ""Truth In Action"" ministries then to ""D. James Kennedy Ministries"" by his sycophantic boy toy Jerry Newcombe) but occasionally watched his program with the same disregard as Pat Robertson. Like most Christian criticism, the featured interviewees focus their attention on the perpetual turmoil in the Middle East without ever mentioning the years of political and cultural dysfunction that make these terrorists groups and militias look really good.  In their effort to make the interviewees appear less prejudiced, they are quick to use broad language like ""the majority of Muslims are peace loving"" but then is immediately followed by with equally broad assumptions like the extent that Muslims follow the Koran or Hadith.  You may remember that D. James Kennedy was a Christian provocateur on par with Robertson so you can imagine the content and tone of this DVD.

It's a passive aggressive expose that is sure to affirm and inform the conservative Christian about Islam but to more apolitical minds like myself, you will look up the people and Scripture only to find out that very little of them panned out to a lasting change.  There is a anecdote told by one of the apologists about a convert from Islam to Christianity with came back with questions about what he should do now, now that he has been saved by grace. The interviewee (I think this was by Ron George) told him to the effect, nothing, which stuck me as odd.  Compared to other religions is a Christian really required do anything except not be homosexual, go to Church on Sunday, maybe read the Bible everyday?  If you search the self help section of Amazon, you will find tens of thousands of books written by Christians for Christians to address some concern like discovering the Holy Spirit or Gods will for your life - seems like there is a lot you have do before you can be reasonably sure you even get to the gates, let alone go beyond them.",1420156800,,3819,6.0036764705882355
