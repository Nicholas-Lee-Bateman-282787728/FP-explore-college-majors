8099695,1,B000CNGBXK,"This movie was very bad.  Long and slow, it tries to play with your head like a psychological drama; but fails since you can't get into the characters.  They are simply weird and sadistic.  There is some nudity to make it slightly sexy, but this one is for esoteric film geeks only.  The rest of you will be bored ten minutes into it unless you like the idea of a half naked woman voluntarily putting leeches on herself.  I'd return it if I could.",1168300800,,447,4.273809523809524

8099697,5,B000CNGBXK,"This film is a must see. It's the type of movie that gets better each time you see it. I've seen it twice and picked up on so many subtle character intricacies on the second viewing. The director is really a master craftsman. The acting is superb. The lead actress, Resmin&eacute; Atis, is both sexy, innoncent and briming with sexual tension. She's definitely someone to watch. Her portrayal of broken dreams, innocence lost, and teen ridden guilt and angst in a single performance is impeccable. If you like great character driven thrillers you must see this movie!",1139788800,,567,4.855670103092783
8099698,4,B000CNGBXK,"This film is riveting, deep and brilliantly subtle. The director makes the most desperate of scenes intimately subtle and powerful.  The characters have an intimate chemistry that is striking. Great film. Buy it.",1139356800,,212,5.424242424242424
