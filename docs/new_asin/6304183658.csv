7864645,5,6304183658,"They've finally released a box set of the three volumes of Patlabor: The Original Series. Note that this review may not be as accurate as others, because I have only watched the first two volumes, and unless the third  volume is a flop, then this rating should still stand. I am hoping to order  the whole one soon. Now on to the review:
Volume 1: The first three  episodes were fantastic and really get you into the spirit of Patlabor OS.  The first episode introduces the main characters of Special Vehicles Unit 2  and their first mission: to stop a runaway labor vehicle.
Volume 2: The  episode with the monster is the worst one yet. The whole episode ends with  pretty much nothing happening. But... the next episode is  amazing!
Unfortunately, the publishing company wants your money, because  they could have easily fit all three videos into one! Also, there are only  two episodes (usually three) in the second volume and the last one is a  two-parter that continues in the next volume. This is why the box-set is  the best value, and at under 60$ that's quite a bargain!",953769600,2,1079,4.621052631578947
