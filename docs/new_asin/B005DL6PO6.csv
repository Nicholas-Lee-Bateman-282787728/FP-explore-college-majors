4660973,1,B005DL6PO6,"Warren William doesn't look very convinced about his role in this production. The whole thing seems forced and contrived. The middle is down-right dull. Otherwise good character actors wander through this as if in a daze, walking around small sets slowly and merely posing. To me this is the weakest Lone Wolf outing of the Warren W. films. And I say this as a Lone Wolf fan. You should check out the excellent ""Counter-Espionage"", ""The Lone Wolf Meets a Lady"" or any of the other Lone Wolf films, which I heartily recommend for purchase or rental. Just not this one.",1388448000,,567,4.68
4660974,4,B005DL6PO6,"warren william does a good job as the lone wolf, the character is on the line of a saint or a falcon,
the only thing i don't like is no close captioning.",1373932800,,153,3.8125
4660975,3,B005DL6PO6,"""Passport To Suez"" was Warren William's seventh and last go-round as Michael Laynard aka ""The Lone Wolf"" (although he is almost constantly with, and assisted by, his Butler/sidekick/ex-partner-in-crime Jamieson) in Columbia Pictures' series of B-movie ""programmers.""  This is also the third release by SONY/Columbia Classics on made-to-order DVD-R's of the series' films, following&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lone-Wolf-Meets-A-Lady/dp/B007G8SEPW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""The Lone Wolf Meets A Lady""</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Counter-Espionage/dp/B005DL6PDM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""Counter-Espionage""</a>. My reviews for both are on their respective pages.  Columbia made four more Lone Wolf films after this, and there was also a later radio and TV series as well.  The Lone Wolf character was created by author Louis Joseph Vance for a series of detective novels.  The plot of this film concerns a group of Nazi spies in Cairo attempting to steal information that would allow them to control the Suez Canal.  Returning for his fourth appearance in the series is veteran TV and movie star Lloyd Bridges, then a Columbia contract player.  Bridges played quite a few Nazi's in his early career!  Besides the always entertaining Eric Blore returning as Jameison, other interesting co-stars are Ann Savage, mostly known for her role in the cult noir&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Detour/dp/B00004W19C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""Detour""</a>, well-known character actor Jay Novello, who can be seen in almost 200 film and television roles, and the great Sheldon Leonard playing a Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart's ""Casablanca"" character) type role as Laynard's old friend, the proprietor of a nightclub where a lot of the action takes place. The picture quality is a step up from ""Counter-Espionage,"" there's a little speckling in the beginning, but as the film progresses, it almost possesses the same great clarity as ""The Lone Wolf Meets A Lady.""

8467190,5,B005DL6PO6,I was unfamiliar with the Lone Wolf series of movies.  Having watched this film and another starring Warren William I found myself enjoying both.  These seem to be the only two that Amazon has on their video so I am hoping for another source for others.,1481155200,,253,4.478260869565218
8467191,5,B005DL6PO6,Never saw the Lone Wolf before.  My sister and I really enjoyed it.,1466467200,,67,4.153846153846154
8467192,4,B005DL6PO6,"A great WWII spy film with Warren William. Good comedy, good plot, and an exotic location with Sheldon Leonard to boot!",1463788800,,119,4.714285714285714
8467193,4,B005DL6PO6,Engaging WW2 espionage tale benefits from Warren Williams' sure presence and an intricate plot of posturing and deception that keeps the viewer guessing. Eric Blore provides comedy relief with a running gag that seems appropriate to his sometimes overbearing butler persona.,1437264000,,274,5.7073170731707314
8467194,3,B005DL6PO6,"A fun Lone Wolf adventure from WWII.  The Lone Wolf is posing as a traitor and attempting to find a Nazi broadcasting site.  Warren William has fun in the role, and Eric Blore adds a lot as his valet/assistant.",1435968000,,210,4.358974358974359
8467195,5,B005DL6PO6,"I have always loved the Warren William as the Lone Wolf because he plays the part so well.  I also love the fact that the plot is so unpredictable.  I never know ""who done it"" until the very end & most of the time I am good at predicting endings.",1429228800,,246,3.9
8467196,5,B005DL6PO6,We enjoy these old movies and it was delivered promptly.,1425081600,,56,4.7
8467197,5,B005DL6PO6,I like old movies in which the actors speak their lines without loud background music and in a manner to be heard.  Thank you.,1398643200,3,126,4.25
