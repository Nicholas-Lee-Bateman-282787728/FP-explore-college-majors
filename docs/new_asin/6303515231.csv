677225,3,6303515231,"Fishburne delivers a fine performance as an undercover narcotics agent who eventually gets hooked to the dope himself. There is also good support from Goldblum as his attorney. A credible score as well, but not much else to  distinguish it from plenty of its ilk. Ambitiously done, but contrived and  standardly filmed.",957744000,,319,5.115384615384615
677226,4,6303515231,"Unlike many other films that have taken the undercover cop story and pursued it in a typical fashion, ""Deep Cover"" takes a tense, intimate approach.  Director Bill Duke creates a quiet masterpiece casting  Laurence Fishburne as a by-the-book cop assigned to infiltrate a major  cocaine empire in Los Angeles.  His connection inside is Jeff Goldblum (in  probably his best performance ever), a supposed clean-shaven Jewish lawyer  who secretly longs for the thrill of a gangster's life while trying to  maintain a family at home.  Duke does not glorify these drug dealers as  Scarface-type millionaires who revel in money & mansions but rather  paints them as quiet, suspicious businessmen who hold no true alliances to  anyone while nesting in pool halls & boxing gyms.  There is never a  moment where any of these characters are seeking fame & fortune.  Instead, they are looking for recognition of their power over both their  friends & foes.
Fishburne soon finds himself sucked into the  dealer's life against his will, doing whatever he can to infiltrate the  organization despite how far ""deep"" he's involved in it (as  opposed to the cliche that the cop decides he likes being a drug dealer).  Meanwhile, Jeff Goldblum also enters  the chaos that's unraveling, learning  to embrace the thug within him that was waiting to emerge.  The film has  the unmistakable look & sound of the early 90's (a good time in film  & music if you ask me), but it has aged well due to sharp  cinematography and a fine soundtrack.  The film has a slightly distracting  sub-plot involving Fishburne and a Christian cop played by Clarence  Williams III, but Williams pulls it off with such conviction that you don't  mind.  There is also a great performance by character actor (and Spike Lee  regular) Roger Guenever Smith as a switchy, mid-level dealer.  Possibly one  of the most overlooked ""cop"" films of the 90's, and a must-have  for fans of Laurene Fishburne or Jeff Goldblum.",945302400,32,1967,4.932515337423313
677227,5,6303515231,"Deep Cover is simply one of the best action films to date. Fishburne, Goldbloom and Clarence Thomas III create an electric atmosphere of violence, narcotics and music that melts off the screen and into the  consciousness of the audience. The sound is as sensual as the lyric poetry  coupled with Fishburne's base imbued voice. See this film, rent it,  contemplate the lines the truth the parallel to political figures and  police activity today. By far the greatest attribute of this film is the  development of each twisted character, i.e., as the film progresses the  characters do more and more cocaine and thus become increasingly hostile  and violent. This movie is cotton candy for any lover of Apocalypse Now.  RENT IT, BUY IT, DO WHATEVER IT TAKES TO SEE THIS MOVIE!",930528000,3,774,4.9

677637,5,6303515231,"""Deep Cover"" is one of the most excrutiatingly honest portrayals of ""The War on Drugs"" that I've seen. Indeed, the intensity and accuracy of this movie is at times disconcerting and a bit disillusioning, which I suspect is why it never had a huge fan base. In the tradition of ""Sugar Hill"" or some of the other raw portraits of urban life in the 90's, Lawrence Fishburne and Jeff Goldblum's performances are so mint that the movie's excesses are all believable. More than anything else, this shows how one culture poisons another and every race eventually gets involved in the general garbage, handshaking, and corruption.  And it doesn't get much more direct in that arena than narcotics dealing and use.

Lawrence Fishburne plays Russell Stevens Jr., a puritanical beat cop who is pulled in by DEA agent played by the impeccably nerdy Charles Martin Smith. Since Fishburne's character saw his father shot by a storeowner on Christmas as a child, he is very inhibited;  Smith's characters urges him to use his repressed vices in the undercover world.

And he does so very successfully, slowly turning into a monster who doesn't mind filling his own people's communities with dope, and executing his rival drug dealer (who looks exactly like MC Hammer) in a bathroom, clearly becoming aroused from the execution. His partner in crime, David, played by Goldblum, is a successful businessman who simply enjoys being a drug dealer in his spare time, helps him grow accustomed to the bowels of the drug world.

David is abused by a Serbian drug dealer constantly at their meetings; juvenile slaps in the mouth take precedence over multi million dollar drug deals. Really, why else be a criminal if you can't be a total scumbag?  David is proud of his Jewish heritage, and lives by the motto ""Never Again"": very soon the Serb finds himself executed. You don't get the sense that Fishburne's character objects all that much.  The amusing thing: this is the kind of bullish*t the DEA's watching. This nonsense.

David begins wearing a big black leather trench coat and corrupting Fishburne's character more and more.  Fishburne is torn between his loyalty to David and a saintly Christian cop played by Clarence Williams III.  The scene in which he confesses to David that he's a cop is epic. In the end, it's nice to watch the movie and imagine that if Fishburne's character had filmed the dirty interactions between cops and a Noriega figure in the film, it would change the world; things like this are revealed everyday and nothing happens. A great film that deserves a re-release.",1439078400,4,2577,4.889908256880734

About mid way or so, I realized this would be a great movie (with some rework of course), if it was filmed like Sin City.  When Laurence was saying that poem, to the cop, I though pure Sin City.  He would have been awesome in a a version like that too.  How cool would that be?  Over all good movie, Laurence makes the movie work.",1433030400,,482,4.359550561797753

677790,5,6303515231,"Another great movie that shows the flaws in the system and how it works. But today it's even worst. The government and law enforcement agencies letting drugs into the country, and cites and the big money is already made before the drugs hit the streets. But to make the good citizens feel safe the same people have made laws to put the low level drug dealers in jail. And make to make sure in the real world they get a lot of time behind bars if the drugs are sold near a school, church or playground or park. And as soon as these people go to jail you have more taking their place. When the big money have already been made. Great movie where a dedicated police officer, became a drug dealer and pretending to be a police. And upper management would do anything to move up no matter who go down. Like I said a great movie. But the drug game couldn't get a rating in Hollywood. The 6 o'clock news and  the front page of any news paper. Let the good citizens feel secure.

It is interesting to see how John's attempt to do good and try to stop the corruption and destruction are undermined by the very people who sent him there in the first place.  His own corruption and then redemption make for a very good story and a cautionary tale.  There is a dark and twisted reality to the world.  Sad, but true.",1402185600,,595,4.324324324324325

678166,4,6303515231,"As grungy and hard-edged as this movie is, I still found a number of good things going for it that made the movie entertaining to watch. The story moves very fast, which tells you something.

As someone who loves narration, I enjoyed Laurence Fishburne's deep-voiced first-person narrating. He was smooth in this gritty 1990s film noir (neo-noir, as they call it) filled with hard-boiled characters, rough language and some brutal scenes wrapped around a drug story. The early '90s produced some fine neo-noirs.

However, as rough as that sounds, they don't overdo the violence but the profanity can make you wince at times. It also has the normal Liberal cheap shots against Republicans: this time George Bush Sr. (The major villain, a South American drug lord is pictured as a friend of Bush's. And, you also get the usual baloney of the U.S. Government and the DEA being bad guys. If that isn't enough, they also play the ""race card"" in here.

Yet, I still liked this film. At least they also took a shot at phony Liberals, who Jeff Goldblum's character portrays. Goldblum's ""David Jason"" actually had the best lines in the film, however. He is shown as morally-bankrupt atheist.

This movie is unusual in that the main character - Fishburne's ""Russell Stevens"" - goes from good guy to bad guy back to good guy! This is an intriguing, dark film.",1233878400,,1348,4.797413793103448

678222,4,6303515231,"The opening scene of this film is probably the best, and sets up nicely the tone of the remainder of the film.  It is Christmas time and snowing heavily as a father drives his son to the liquor store, snorts some coke, and then asks the boy what he wants for Christmas.  He then robs a liquour store at gunpoint, and is shot in the back in front of his son Russell and next to a fake Santa.  The scene captures a nightmare from a child's perspective, that will haunt and inform him until the end.  It is a nice example of how an effective opening scene can simultaneously set a tone, develop sympathy for a main character, and (naively and simplistically but memorably) explain a contradictory set of motivations that will drive him throughout the film.  He doesn't want to be like his father, so he will want to be straight.  But he knows his father loved him, so he won't be quick to judge someone like his father; and he will be looking for a father figure throughout the film.  The film is really not so much about drugs as about parenting and the relation of the child to the missing parent.

He finds a surrogate father, at first, in his racist boss at the DEA, where he works.  The boss sends him on a mission precisely into the kind of life that his own father had warned him to avoid (by words, if not by example, except for the example of getting himself killed).  Yet he continually reminds him that he is doing this effectively to save people like his father.  This first surrogate father seems to be everything his father wasn't: educated, successful, and ""clean.""  Still, just as Russell's father asked him to sit by while he committed a crime, Russell's boss asks him to turn away from an investigation when it gets political.

He finds a better father figure in a ""preacher"" cop, who warns him in the same tone as his father had, but unlike his father practiced what he preached.  At the same time, he is one who clearly has faced the demon in himself that he is trying to exorcise in others.  Effectively, the movie is about Russell (the lead character played well by Laurence Fishburne) learning to face up to the fact that nothing he does will redeem his father or bring him back, and growing up by not merely avoiding his father's sins but by passing through and beyond them.  In the end, he is neither a ""straight arrow"" or a ""lost soul"" but is faced with a choice that he poses to the audience, in order to suggest that there are no easy answers to the existential questions faced by those who are caught up in the world that killed Russell's father.  (In a subplot, he develops a relationship with a young hispanic boy whose mother is in effectively the same position as was his own father.)

On top of that, Russell is paired with a ""brother"" of sorts, a lawyer played by Jeff Goldblum, who is in many ways his mirror image.  Unlike Russell, David (Goldblum) has everything: a beautiful family, a nice house, a good job.  He doesn't do crime, like Russell's father, out of necessity but out of a fascination with the other side, with the criminal element and even (in a not entirely developed but intriguing sub theme) with the idea of being black (he has a black lover, he is fascinated nearly to the point of an erotic attraction by Russell - who he describes in action as a ""beautiful beast"").  Unlike Russell's father who hated the life of crime that he felt obligated to pursue, David gives up his family to pursue the dark life of crime for its own sake. It is against this ""double"" that Russell defines himself -- refusing in the end to be a criminal and insisting that he is still a cop.

Sure it's simplistic, but it's a fun and entertaining film, that plays with the psychology of motivation and with moral questions that are inevitable in the ""war on drugs"" (or the ""war on terror,"" for that matter).  The directing is solid and some scenes like the first one are quite good.  The script is engaging and mostly clever, with convincing characterizations.  The reversals in the story and the fact it uses a grand scheme to address highly personal issues of morality and choice are to be expected from a film that was co-scripted by Michael Tolkin -- who also wrote Altman's ""The Player"" and wrote and directed ""The Rapture.""  There are some extraneous side plots here and there, and both the DEA and the mafia didn't seem very well developed or plausible.  For that matter, the idea that with a little bit of luck and a charismatic ""tough"" attitude one can get to the top of the drug mafia food chain in a matter of weeks or months is sheer fantasy (of a sort that makes ""Miami Vice"" look realistic).  Still, the fantasy elements are really subordinate to the personal story of a boy facing up the consequences and implications of a tragic childhood event.  Worth seeing if you can get in to this kind of thing.",1165276800,7,4844,4.4665153234960275
678223,5,6303515231,"Although he was featured as the moral father in the landmark film ""Boyz n the Hood"" the year before and had been acting for ten years, ""Deep Cover"" was the film that made me sit up and take notice of Laurence Fishburne, then stand up and applaud.  ""Deep Cover"" was directed by Bill Duke and he fashions a film that allows Mr. Fishburne a tour de force performance.

Like a lot of people, I like good Cops and Gangster movies.  But I would argue that films like ""The Godfather"" and the more recent ""The Departed"" are successful in ways that ""Scarface"" is not because we get to see the humanity in the characters.  It's not interesting to watch a bad guy who is nothing but bad through and through in every second of the film.  Good guys aren't interesting in a film unless they're a little wrinkled.  Michael Corleone is interesting in the Godfather films because he WANTS to be a good father, husband and man, but he keeps getting dragged into criminal situations that he would avoid if he could.  By contrast, in Scarface Al Pacino portrays a sociopath and I quickly grew tired of his ""I'm the baddest bad guy there is"" act.

""Deep Cover"" is a movie that has layers and Laurence portrays these many layers in an acting performance that is one of the best I have ever seen.  His character grew up in the streets.  He watched his father killed and is determined to grow up and stay on the straight and narrow.  He becomes a policeman.  Because of his intelligence and background he is recruited to go undercover to infiltrate a drug ring.  He is hesitant, but Charles Martin Smith's DEA Agent character talks him into it.  Smith has had a great career playing nerdy government types, and you can see that HE can't go infiltrate this drug ring, so Laurence seems a good choice.

Under cover Fishburne descends by layers, either becoming or simply pretending to become exactly the kind of man he has tried to avoid his entire life.  Jeff Goldblum is flip and charming in a sociopath lawyer-turned-drug dealer kind of way - reminiscent of Sean Penn in Carlito's Way.  Clarence Williams III is absolutely terrific in his few scenes as the good street cop who doesn't know that Fishburne is actually a cop too, and tries to steer him away from the trouble that he seems headed for.

What really makes Deep Cover burn is the performance of Laurence Fishburne.  He is so convincingly conflicted about putting on the act of becoming a drug dealer.  Will he be put into a position to commit serious crimes?  To kill?  After he has spent such a long time undercover becoming a Prince of the street, what will he do when he is offered the chance to move up to the big time in the drug ring?  The climactic scene of ""Deep Cover"" contains one of the most intense acting performances I have ever seen.  It would be worth watching this film only for that scene - but it's a good ride getting there.  Enjoy.",1161820800,10,2890,4.490421455938697

Laurence Fishburne is at his best in his role of an undercover cop slowly crossing the line between pretending to be a drug dealer and pretending to be a cop. Jeff Golblum is one of those actors you either love or hate, and I loved him playing the dirty lawyer laundering drug money. There's a great chemistry between the two and the supporting cast, which to me, was one of the main weakness of New Jack City.

The use of Laurence Fishburne's character as the narrator works wonder, and somewhere between the slow, dark wailings of the movie theme, the nightime shots of downtown LA and Laurence Fishburn's poetic lines, the movie grabs you into a world, an urban jungle, crowded with nightime vultures, heartless killers and hopeless junkies.

One person told me that you don't have a complete DVD collection without Scarface. Well, I beg to differ!. Deep Cover is such an intelligently made movie that I feel that your DVD collection must include this movie. Laurence Fishburne's performance was riveting! Jeff Goldblum was fabulous as well. Fishburne plays a moralistic cop who goes undercover to catch a very powerful drug lord; hoping to stop drug trafficking into this country. Unfortunately, he has to do the one thing he is trying to stop; the selling of drugs. He becomes a drug dealer himself in an effort to make contact with a powerful drug lord. He is so good at being a drug dealer that he is not sure if he is a ""cop pretending to be a drug dealer or a drug dealer pretending to be a cop!"" He finds himself caught up in murder as well as drugs. He,later, meets up with his future partner in crime, Goldblum, who is a amoralistic lawyer who has been in drug dealer prior to his relationship with Fishburne. Fishburne,later, discovers that he has been bamboozled by the chief DEA. The DEA is really hoping to be in some form of partnership with this drug lord who they want Fishburne to make contact with. Fishburne finds himself circling an emotional, self awareness drain as he takes a sniff of crack and a drink of alcohol( something he swore he would ""never do"") as he realizes taht he has been used. He was driven by the fact that as a child he saw his drug addicted father get shot after he robbed a store and shot the store employee. The movie consists of several unknown actors who contributes to the success of this movie. Oh, I should mention Clarence Williams III who was is known for his role in the original TV series ""The Mod Squad.""

But, my favorite actors in this film are the villains..Eddie, Ivy, and Barbosa.  They have a certain ferocious, scumbag appeal to them, yet each in their own way.  Eddie impressed me with the sheer look of panic on his face as he begs for his life. Most people tend to overlook such  performances.

I also love the chemistry between Goldblum and Fishburne as they go from inferior to C.E.O.s of the underworld.

Both the film and its title theme are timeless and priceless.

678350,5,6303515231,"I haven't seen this movie for quite a few years, but I became a huge fan of Laurence Fishburne because of it.  I remembered loving the dialogue of the film and the intrinsic moral struggles of Fishburne's character.  I had also forgotten that Michael Tolkin (THE PLAYER, AMONG THE DEAD--a novel, and CHANGING LANES) wrote the screenplay.  All until I purchased it on DVD last week and watched it Friday evening.  Man, that's a lot to forget. . . .
Fishburne is simply spectacular in a quietly disturbing and understated way.  His eyes tell much of the story.  One of the reviewers called him ""broding,"" and this is a good description.  His character doesn't want the assignment but flourishes in it.  Doing a bad thing well has its own rewards and punishments.  Goldblum--hardly one's first thought at Oscar time each year--is excellent as Fishburne's ""partner"" in crime.  Everybody else is, at the very least, very good:  Fishburne's superior officer, his lady friend, the drug dealers, the cop/preacher chasing Fishburne.
Tolkin does an admirable job of mixing the music of the movie, fairly heavy hip hop (at least for my taste) with its dialogue.  Fishburne's lines as narrator, at times, are very rhythmic and poetic, blending with the undercurrent of music.  He is also fairly profound at moments, going well beyond his profession (whether as cop or drug dealer) to be a father figure to the little boy who lived across the hall.  The only argument one could really make is that Tolkin's dialogue is a bit too ""preachy"" at times and possibly a bit too profound in some pressure-packed moments--would these thugs come up with these lines in these situations?  It doesn't matter to me.  I'll give Tolkin bonus points for writing a clever, smart, quick screenplay, complete with the moral ambiguities he seems to love and the less-than-happily-ever-after ending we all should have expected from him.
Bottom line:  this is one of the best crime/drug movies I can think of, and Fishburne's performance (really his break-out one) is well worth a rental, at the very least.  It is ""out of the box"" enough and performed so well as to be highly recommended.",1042416000,4,2154,4.887052341597796

678355,3,6303515231,"I, like so many other people who grew up in the time I did, was first attracted to this film solely through the title song by Dr. Dre on the soundtrack to the film.  It was ridiculous how much I heard that song get played all over the radio and the hype it surrounded the movie with during that spring of 1992.  In fact, it, in many ways, has outlasted the film itself in terms of pop culture's memory.  And that is actually a shame.

This a superior thriller, taking the undercover cop story and crafting a tension-drenched and surprisingly subtle movie.  And though it begins to lose its bottom by the end and becomes a little contrived, for the first three quarters of the movie it is expertise and a whole lot more unpredictable than most films of its genre.  Veteran actor Laurence Fishburne stars, in, surprisingly, his first lead role, as an L.A. cop who is assigned to go undercover and infiltrate a major cocaine empire in Los Angeles.  It is a job he reluctantly takes; as a child he witnessed his junkie father killed while pulling a stickup on Christmas Eve.  The flashback of this is shown as the opening scene and is one of the most disturbing in the film, as the young child, who had just listened to his father ask him what he wanted for Christmas, watches the whole bloody incident in horror and pain from the parked car.  This plays heavily on his conscience and his psychic well-being as the film goes on.  He goes everywhere from the seedy streets of the inner-cities and ghettos as a cocaine dealer and manages to get all the way to the highest ranks of the organization.  He does this by working his way into the circle of a mid-level drug distributor.  A supposedly clean-shaven man who owns a house, has a beautiful wife, and an eight-year-old daughter whom he practices the multiplication tables with in the morning.  This key character is played with nervous ingenuity by Jeff Goldblum, in one of his most impressive performances, and is the symbol of the disturbing depths that a man's greed can go to.

All of this, while extremely strong assets, are more or less pretty routine in films such as these.  Director Bill Duke, however, manages to take it a step further and elevates this film with style and class.  He has Fishburne narrate the story and allows the langage to be poetic and colorful, something that derives from classic 1940s film noir.  My favorite line in the narration is on Fishburne's first day on the streets as a dealer when the voice-over says ""The great thing about life on the streets is you know how it's gonna be.  It's always the same.  It's always getting worse.""  The strongest and most potent scenes in the film are the ones dealing directly with Fishburne's struggles with the moral decisions he must make.  The ""deeper"" involved he gets in the criminal life, the more he begins to realize the cold and inhuman manner with which the government and authorities have been cast.  It's not that he decides he likes being a drug dealer, it's actually the exact opposite.  He becomes more and more determined to infiltrate the organization, by any means necessary, no matter how violent and chaotic it gets.  As I said, the film does begin to lose its bottom by the end, as the plot becomes slightly overblown, however, I won't go into details as it would spoil some surprises.  And overall the courage and conviction of the performances causes you to forget the lackluster final quarter.  Roger Ebert said that this was ""a drama disguised as a thriller"" and I will have to agree with that statement.  It is much more dependent on characters than on action scenes, and that is what makes it so much better and more intelligent that most of its genre.  Everywhere in this film there is the unmistakeable look and feel of the early '90s, whether it's in the great soundtrack, the sharp cinematography, the fast-paced editing and camera movements, or the screen sweeps that segue from scene to scene.  It was a good time in movies and music, if you ask me, but this film has aged much better than its closest companion 'New Jack City' has.  Possibly one of the most overlooked cop films of the '90s.",993945600,16,4149,4.5978260869565215
678356,4,6303515231,"Implausible, but engaging.  A cop whose psychological profile suggests that he himself is prone to criminal behavior goes undercover to bust one of the major importers of drugs on the West Coast.  Before long, he is dealing drugs for real in order to maintain his cover.  By the end, he is poised to become a major figure in the drug underworld.  It's more concerned with plot than with deeply exploring the character's moral dilemma, but it's tight and interesting.  As always, Lawrence Fishburn is a powerful screen presence.",975110400,,527,4.943181818181818
678357,5,6303515231,"An awesome movie. Though a fictional story with aspects that could only happen in the movies, it's a cool story of how a law enforcement agent could unwittingly become an asset to the drug trade instead of justice.  This is a movie about covert institutional violence and would be enjoyed by  anybody who likes a good show.",963964800,,323,4.649122807017544
678358,3,6303515231,"Strong performances by Laurence Fishburne and Jeff Goldblum dominate this story of a cop who goes undercover as a drug dealer, in order to ""Do some good,"" in ""Deep Cover,"" directed by Bill Duke.  When he is ten years old,  Russell Stevens Jr. witnesses the killing of his drug addicted father, who  is shot as he attempts to rob a liquor store, while his son waits in the  car.  Twenty years later, Russell (Fishburne) is a cop, making good on the  promise he made to himself the day he watched his father die; he wasn't  going to end up like that.  And he was going to make a difference.  When  Gerald Carver (Charles Martin Smith), an agent with the DEA, approaches him  with the offer of an assignment to go under cover as a drug dealer, to help  them dismantle the South American pipeline supplying most of the West  Coast, and ultimately bring those individuals responsible to justice,  Russell accepts; but only after coming to terms with his initial misgivings  about taking on such a role.  He'll be in so deep, he'll actually have to  become another person; he'll be living the life full time, and it may take  a year or more to accomplish what they set out to do.  He takes the name  John Hull, and goes in.  This is a decent action film with a pretty  good story, but there isn't much here that hasn't been done before; what  sets this one apart from many others like it, however, are the two stars.  Fishburne, especially (still billed here as ""Larry""), takes a fairly  routine character and gives him substance.  He has such a commanding screen  presence that it makes everything that goes down seem credible; he  seemingly has the innate ability to know his character from the inside out,  and what a difference that can make, especially to a movie like this.  Goldblum, as well, takes his character of attorney David Jason to the  limit.  He lends a smarmy edginess to him, as he gradually takes his  initial cool resolve to the brink of reason, then on past to the point of  no return.  Smith is not nearly as effective as the Princeton educated  agent with clean hands, who drives Russell to depths from which he may  never return, but Fishburne is such a good actor that it lifts Smith's  performance to a higher level, too.  Clarence Williams III, as Taft, the  cop with the penchant for scripture, is believable enough, but there is  something disquieting about watching him; he never blinks, which can be  distracting at times.  The supporting cast includes Victoria Dillard  (Betty), Sydney Lassick (Gopher), Gregory Sierra (Felix), Roger Guenveur  Smith (Eddie), Rene Assa (Guzman), and Arthur Mendoza (Gallegos).  Duke  gives a brisk pace to the film, and maintains it throughout, but keeps it  all rather routine and unimaginative.  ""Deep Cover"" then, is a reasonably  satisfying movie, due mainly to the aforementioned performances, which  really make it seem more substantial than it is.",961632000,3,2914,4.739478957915832
678359,5,6303515231,"The acting, directing and casting of this movie makes it one of my all time favorites.  Larry Fishbourne is brilliant in his portrayal of a straight cop who is forced into going deep under cover to bust a major drug  cartel. His supporting cast ( Jeff Goldblum, Clarence Williams III and  other strong performances ) make this movie all the more enjoyable, earning  it a spot on my top ten list of favorite films.  This film is as fun to  watch today as it was in 1992. An excellent soundtrack and great  cinematography make this film very exciting. Director Bill Duke ( A Rage in  Harlem, Hoodlum & Sister Act 2 ) did an outstanding job with this  movie.  Caution, this film is not for weak hearted individuals.  This is a  real gangster flick.  If you liked Scarface, A Soldiers Story, Platoon or  New Jack City, you should love Deep Cover!",958608000,2,842,4.490066225165563
