2300309,5,B0009MFQKI,I just purchased a second copy of this DVD because the original was lost in a move. I can honestly say when I did this workout before I saw quick and great results. You really do work up a sweat in this intense 30 min workout. If you have the chance and are interested in trying something fun and new this is the exercise for you!!!,1186444800,2,332,4.045454545454546
2300310,3,B0009MFQKI,"This is a good workout, don't get me wrong. But it's not that great for advanced exercises who want a REAL workout. I don't even think I broke a sweat. But the band work is good.",1170201600,4,178,3.9722222222222223
2300311,5,B0009MFQKI,"This was my first experience Taebo, let me say I enjoyed it!!  The workout is easy to follow, it can be done with or without the bands and the pace is in keeping with a basic workout. I recommend this for anyone who has worked out before but wants a refresher before getting into the intermediate and advanced levels.  Billy and his crew excel at motivating the user in this dvd, he takes his time to go through the moves and repeats them so the user can get used to the workout, and the best part is you see and feel the results.  I saw the difference in the same week. I recommend this for both beginners and advanced (this dvd comes in handy when you are running short on time to workout in the mornings).",1169510400,7,708,4.1911764705882355
2300312,4,B0009MFQKI,"I really like this DVD - it is fast paced, fun, and pretty easy to follow, especially if you've done any tae-bo before.  If you get off a beat or two, who cares?  You still get a really good workout. I just wish it was a bit longer.",1159056000,,232,3.8125
2300313,5,B0009MFQKI,Billy's workouts have gotten better and you can tell he really cares about people getting into shape. This is a fun workout and you feel like you've had a good workout.,1153872000,4,168,4.451612903225806
2300314,5,B0009MFQKI,This is a great workout with great results.  Be warned if you are a beginner that it is tough.  It is only really 25 minutes of workout and 5  minutes of warmup/cool down.  If you want to be challanged this is it.  Billy does use bands in this one.  Beginners need to work up to it.  I have all the tapes and work out with them all the time.  This one is great if I do not have a lot of time.,1153440000,6,392,3.6951219512195124
2300315,3,B0009MFQKI,"If you don't have this tape memorized, you will be confused and always a beat behind. I have the entire set, basic traning, ultimate training, abs, lower body, cardio LIVE, and cardio and i find that this dvd in particular is the worst.  I was soo excited for this 30 minute cardio routine set on venice beach but i found that Billy and his team go so fast from exercise to exercise that as soon as you figure out how to correctly do the move you are onto the next one.  Billy also does not cue that well, you are being told what to do not right before but during and then you are onto the next move. I find that although the cardio one is 45 min, it is  easier in the apsect that you are doing multiple sets of each exercise, it goes alittle slower, and BIlly lets you know what to do next. Because of this i find that bootcamp cardio is a better buy if you only want to purchase one of these cardio DVDs.

On the other hand, if you are very advanced, have memorized the order of the moves in this DVD and know the bootcamp /tae bo moves very well, you might enjoy this very fast paced DVD.  the background is nice and you do work up a sweat, i just feel is it very difficult to effectively follow this DVD. I have to say that i do enjoy the other five dvds and find them challenging and easier to follow.",1151625600,26,1306,4.046511627906977
2300316,5,B0009MFQKI,Short cardio workout.  LOVE IT.............Gets me in the exercising mood. I would purchase another one or more bands if needed.,1391558400,,128,5.4
2300317,5,B0009MFQKI,worth it!! busted my ass lost tons of weight lost. only down side is i didn't have the bands! but i still did the movement,1385596800,,122,3.92
2300318,4,B0009MFQKI,"I ordered this a while ago and this is one of the best workouts I have done. Total body burn. its a challenge, so if you have been a couch potato for a while. Work at it until you get it!",1369353600,,187,3.5853658536585367
2300319,5,B0009MFQKI,This is a great work out!  I have been doing low impact workouts and needed something with a bit more punch to it and this is it!,1366761600,,129,3.7777777777777777
2300320,3,B0009MFQKI,"Tae Bo I have many DVD's and I do Tae Bo 4 times a week. This is one of my least favorite only because the cut Shellie's microphone off so you couldn't hear any counting for most of the DVD. Also, the music and sound quality isn't very good. Other than this I love the actual workout routine and if you can count on your own for most of the DVD it's just fine.",1362441600,,360,3.8783783783783785
2300321,5,B0009MFQKI,The product came in good time and in the condition i was told it would be in. It works great for me to work out at home at my convience.,1359504000,,136,3.566666666666667
2300322,1,B0009MFQKI,"I wasn't impressed with this DVD...I've always enjoyed Billy Blanks' stuff, but this one was sub-par. Just not for me.",1357862400,,118,4.95
2300323,5,B0009MFQKI,"I realy love this DVD.  One of my favorite Bootcamp DVDs. This workout is great when the time is tight. First you work on your cardio and then you put your Billy bands on. Now its time for upper body training. You realy feel the burn. But it's harder when you use the Billy Elite band. The Elite bands are stronger.
Billy is also a great motivator. When you tired, Billy push you forward.
Buy this when you like Bootcamp training with the bands.",1333843200,,445,4.2976190476190474
2300324,5,B0009MFQKI,"I have been using this DVD while intermingling other workout DVDs for the past four years and I can not give this one up! This is the only one I lost weight while using 3-4x week and not changing any eating habits. For those who struggle with the moves you need to watch it a few times and you master it. Its FAST PACED, this is a GOOD THING...this is what sets it aside from other work out DVDs, as hard as they may be, they're too slow with breaks in between to show you the moves. Billy's DVD just goes from one move to the next with no break, so YES hard at first but after a few times you know the routine and it makes for an efficient work out in a short time. GET IT. its the best.",1328140800,,688,3.8865248226950353
2300325,1,B0009MFQKI,"I couldn't get through the video w/ the scene (it was ""too live""). I just did not care for it, it actually took away from me doing the workout. I sold mine. Was not impressed, but liked the other videos in this series.",1327190400,,218,4.093023255813954
2300326,5,B0009MFQKI,"If you're looking for a fun and effective workout, this is for you!  Taebo is such a fun way to lose weight and tone up!  I have been doing Tae-bo for close to 7 years now and it never gets boring!  Billy's Bootcamp series is one of my favorite taebo workouts, and BootCamp Live is my favorite out of the four.  You get a lot of fun exercise in a 30 min. workout.  My brother and I both had the BootCamp workouts, but my brother's dog recently decided to try to eat his BootCamp Cardio DVD, so I thought getting him a new one would be a great Christmas present.  He was so excited to receive this!  He missed using it to workout to.  Plus, I got an amazing price on Amazon!  I highly recommend this product!!",1295654400,,708,4.109489051094891
2300327,5,B0009MFQKI,"It's only 30 minutes - but a very thorough workout, covering all muscle groups.  No special equipment needed.  Fast paced in a positve way, and not at all boring.  On some of Billly's other DVD's he gets a little too preachy/in your face, at least for my taste -- but not on this DVD.  Really a fabulous workout for just 30 short minutes.  Highly recommended.",1291334400,,359,4.461538461538462
2300328,5,B0009MFQKI,"Great workout!  This is a great 30 minute Taebo workout. The bootcamp team heads to Venice beach for a short intense complete workout.

The Bootcamp workouts have more calisthenics than his other workouts. Also they use Billy bands,... and when they do I use hand weights, Heavyhands or some Everlast weighted boxing practice gloves (they work great). ..all good for a change up.

The outdoor aspect of this is nice for a change. I'm guessing that it was hard to hear things a bit, because the team was a bit less in sync than usual.

Some people get caught up in such things, but I just see this as an excellent short all around workout. I great addition to my Taebo collection.",1284336000,,679,4.540983606557377
2300329,3,B0009MFQKI,"the cardio boot camp is the same as the original cadio DVD with maybe a few new moves and its a slightly faster pace than teh regular cardio DVD. cant go wrong with tae-bo tho, great buy!",1279584000,,187,4.081081081081081
2300330,4,B0009MFQKI,"I am a big fan of Billy Blanks and his TaeBo workouts, this one is good but not as good as the others for the main because the camera angles were a bit off putting and lack of prompts made it harder to follow. However, the exercises get you in a sweat, so Billy is forgiven on this occasion The workout lasts for about 30 minutes so it is easier to fit into a busy day when time is short.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Billy-Blanks-Cardio-Bootcamp-Live/dp/B000EHQU62/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Billy Blanks - Cardio Bootcamp Live</a>",1256601600,,572,5.511363636363637
2300331,5,B0009MFQKI,I originally bought this product on VHS years ago. The tape broke from repeated use over the years. This is a great workout and is not too long for those days when time is limited!! I use many of Billy's workouts and I am a devoted tae bo fan. The price is excellent so buy the product.,1252540800,,286,4.035087719298246
2300332,4,B0009MFQKI,"This is my favorite taebo series. I broke my last DVD, and was ecstatic to find it on Amazon for such an amazing price.

2300335,5,B0009MFQKI,"This is a fast paced half hour workout.  I'm not that used to this type of class and found it to be enough of a challenge that it keeps me interested.

8063156,5,B0009MFQKI,"I absolutely LOVE Taebo!  I've been doing it on and off for the past ten years or more.  I started with the original Taebo workout...you know the one I'm talking about,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Billy-Blanks-Tae-Bo-Instructional-Workout-Basic-Advanced-8-Minute-Workout/dp/6305608733/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Billy Blanks' Tae-Bo - Instructional Workout, Basic, Advanced, 8-Minute Workout</a>, only on video cassette.  LOL  I've since purchased that workout on DVD.  In any event, I then got the BootCamp three DVD set, which included this workout and two others, as well as the Billy bands (loooooove those bands!.)  I found I loved the boot camp workouts even more than I did the original ones.  BTW you don't need the bands to do this workout...it can be done with or without them, or you can substituted the bands with wrist and ankle weights.

This particular workout, Cardio BootCamp Live! is a favorite, because I can get a pretty good workout in a relatively short period of time--only 30 minutes.  It's a great workout for those days when I'm pressed for time.  I haven't done any Taebo workouts in over a year--I quit working out until this summer when I started running again.  Now that the weather is beginning to get cooler I decided to break out the Taebo DVDs for those days when it's too cold to run.  I was dismayed to discover that my copy of this DVD, as well as the Ultimate BootCamp DVD, are nowhere to be found.  I refused to be without my workout and promptly found a copy of each here on Amazon.  So as much as it disgusts me to have to pay for something I already own, I felt like I had no choice because I know that this DVD will get a lot of use over the next few months.

The bottom line is I love this DVD--so much so that I've purchased it twice!  It's a great workout for anyone who is looking for a fairly short, but effective workout.  It's definitely not for beginners, because although it's only 30 minutes, it is pretty intense.  Furthermore, if you're one of those dedicated workout buffs who is always at the gym lifting weights and the like, you might find this workout a bit too tame for you.  LOL  I guess I'd say this workout is perfect for the ""average"" person--someone who is not a cough potato, but who works out regularly, although not at an intense level.  Happy shopping!",1410825600,4,2369,4.8725
