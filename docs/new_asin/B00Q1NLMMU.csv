of The Band after ""The Last Waltz"".",1426723200,2,124,5.25
8690015,5,B00Q1NLMMU,"This is a great concert, which should appeal to fans of the Band. This performance, in Tokyo, was filmed in 1983, when the reformed Band toured without Robbie Robertson but with Earl Cate on lead guitar, plus three other members of the Cate Brothers Band.

The line-up and the set list are both similar to those in the concert filmed in Vancouver the same year, titled 'The Band is Back'. However, this concert is more than half-an-hour longer, and features half-a-dozen extra songs, so it is a good alternative to that dvd.

Musically, it is excellent. The camerawork may not be brilliant, but its not too bad. You see very few shots of the audience, which is a pity because they are a good, appreciative audience.

Definitely recommended to fans of the Band.",1426723200,2,760,4.6992481203007515
