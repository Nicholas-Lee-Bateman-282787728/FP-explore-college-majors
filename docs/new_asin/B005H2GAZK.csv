4699050,5,B005H2GAZK,"Our children enjoyed Buddy and his passion for dinosaurs. He enhances the videos with pop-up animation, original music, and lots of personality. My son decided that he would be a dinosaur hunter when he grows up! :) It grounds them well in the truth of God's word regarding dinosaurs. My only wish was that it had been longer, but what was there was worthwhile and thought-provoking. It does have excellent bonus material showing Buddy designing and carving a dinosaur model, along with other fun extras.",1357257600,9,504,4.9411764705882355

8472601,5,B005H2GAZK,My daughter loves Buddy Davis and I think Grandma and Grandpa have gotten her almost all of his stuff. This one is no exception. Great information!,1489881600,,147,4.6923076923076925
8472602,5,B005H2GAZK,Another great adventure from Buddy Davis!  The grandchildren love these!,1487548800,,72,6.2
8472603,1,B005H2GAZK,"The price on Amazon was more than the price shown on the dvd case.  While the content was great, it was so short for what I paid.  I would have preferred to just borrow it, because it's really only a one time viewing amount of content.  We were disappointed.",1468627200,,258,4.224489795918367
8472604,5,B005H2GAZK,"My kids absolutely love watching this! Buddy Davis goes to an actual dinosaur dig site, and guides you through the adventure ! This is a great Family-safe video. The talented music combined with Buddy's passion for Creation (and especially dinosaurs) have made this one of our home's most regularly selected DVDs. Can't wait for more Adventures!!",1447372800,,346,5.196428571428571

8472606,1,B005H2GAZK,"This is beyond garbage. Only buy or show this video if you are trying to lie to children, because this is as far from the truth as it gets.",1375660800,,139,3.8275862068965516
8472607,1,B005H2GAZK,"OK, so this movie might be good for someone teaching their child that evolution does not exist, but don't buy it if you believe in evolution even in the smallest way.  The ""facts"" as presented in this video are complete and utter nonsense if you believe that the Earth is older than 5000 years, as is the present day opinion of the scientists out there.  It does not present fact.  It should be listed in the fiction section, not a documentary.  It is about God not dinosaurs.",1375660800,,476,4.436781609195402
