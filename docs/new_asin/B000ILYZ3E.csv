8548226,5,B000ILYZ3E,"Traveling by car with only a card table and chairs, a few spiritual items, a lifetime of study and experience, and a consuming drive to foster global understanding and harmony through teaching, one man named Dovid happens upon the Henry Miller Memorial Library in Big Sur. The library is a tribute to the late author who, in the mid 20th century, represented the clash of censorship with freedom of expression. Here, under redwood forest on high cliffs above the Pacific, Dovid expounds on Cabalistic teachings of sexual energy, cosmic metaphor, and historical prophecy in the human process of repairing the universe. Arabs, Jews, the West, the East, and the Movement are all well within Dovid's experience. Passers-by and Henry Miller fans-in-residence are captivated as they discuss with Dovid subjects such as symbolism in current political, social, and military events,; how the Tarot encompasses the shape of creation; inter-generational responsibility; and Dovid's book ""Listening to the Soul."" Ultimately, ""Henry and Dovid: Sex, God, and Revolution"" shows a life that is at once a reflection of the environment while completely individual, avuncular while pushing the limits of permitted opinions, and out of place while so needed.",1158969600,,1238,5.38659793814433
