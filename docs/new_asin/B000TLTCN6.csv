8210131,3,B000TLTCN6,"I don't know who named this movie 'Monkey Business' because the chimpanzee is seen in only one scene.  This, by all accounts, is a kid's movie through and through,  It held my five-year-old grandson's attention through to the end; however, it isn't one many parents would find interesting.  Since it is a safe movie for even little kids, parents shouldn't need to watch it with them.",1225411200,,383,4.7727272727272725
