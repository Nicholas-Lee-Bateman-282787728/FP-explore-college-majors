The first one directed by Bruno Nuytten starring Isabelle Adjani and Grard Depardieu that was released in 1988 which depicts the relationship between her and Rodin, and the second one directed by Bruno Dumont released in 2013 starring Juliette Binoche and Jean-Luc Vincent which depicts a later episode of her life between her and her brother Paul when she was interned in a mental hospital.
