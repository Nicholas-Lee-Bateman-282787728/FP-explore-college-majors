8716859,5,B00XW4TNJU,"Turned this show on Hulu when my daughter was 2 months old and since then she has refused to watch any other show, slowly building the collection of dvds so she won't scream while she's at grandma's house. Good show, wish it was a little more educational though, doesn't explore numbers, colors, or the alphabet, focused more about mechanical stuff.",1479254400,,349,4.833333333333333
