8706117,1,B00UGQ4W7A,"THE LONGEST DAY was the greatest war movie. Production was made when I was in the sixth grade. My teacher commented in class that the director wanted authenticity. So, technicians went to European museums to photograph World War II gum wrappers and printed reproductions for the film.
.
I wished that it was produced in color. However, the makers wanted to include actual footage from historical films. Since most were black-and-white, the movie was made in that format. A colorized version was available in VCR tape. Some reported that a colorized Japanese DVD also existed.
.
That being said, I wish to critique the quality of the movie in Blu-ray format. In general, there is little difference between the Blu-ray and the DVD versions. Both look the same. In black-and-white format, the textures are there in different shades of gray. The finer details are hard to see, unlike a colored film.
.
As a result, save your money and buy the DVD version instead of the higher priced Blu-ray.",1470528000,2,988,4.85207100591716
