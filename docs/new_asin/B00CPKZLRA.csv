8584550,5,B00CPKZLRA,What a sweet fun movie. I just hate the one song that the man and girl are singing in different keys. It was like they were individually dubbed but oh so wrong for that one....jaw clenching song near the beginning. Then it is over and the rest is so great! Definitely a kids movie. Nice and clean.. Love the costumes and the slight cultural difference. I think it was made in Norway?,1424908800,,383,4.333333333333333
