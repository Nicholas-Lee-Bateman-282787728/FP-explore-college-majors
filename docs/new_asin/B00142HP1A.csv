I'd bet that director Ulli Lommel would do well with a special edition that highlighted its infamous reputation, but until that day comes we're left with the original German release. Sadly, that one isn't very accessible to most U.S. Viewers, given its lack of subtitles and PAL format. However, if you happen to own a region-free DVD player and have a thing for movies that others seem to hate, it might be worth purchasing.

The story: Pop star Daniel Kblbck is the target of a murder plot and must rely on the protection of a mysterious, magical individual (Lommel).

Having Lommel as the director was a surefire guarantee that the film was going to be weird. Once a promising international filmmaker, he's now known for making&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/horrible/dp/B0009KQP1E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">horrible</a>&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/no-budget/dp/B000EWBKHG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">no-budget</a>&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/flicks/dp/B000J10EQK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">flicks</a>, and it seems that Daniel der Zauberer is what kicked off this worst leg of his career. Not only does this shot-on-video film seem to have no budget, it has a hard time telling its story for the numerous subplots and detours it indulges. New characters appear from out of nowhere to engage in intimate conversations with established figures, music videos inexplicably start playing, and poor editing ensures that the dialogue doesn't resemble actual conversation. The movie comes across as an ambitious high school project, not a theatrically-released feature film.

The movie tries to drum up support for its star, but Daniel is a pathetically passive figure  oblivious to the plot against his life until the near-end  and the weirdo villains aren't likely to inspire reflectiveness in his real-life detractors. That said, the film does have some definite strengths. The concert footage and exclusive songs are fun, and the film boasts a level of enthusiastic energy that's sorely lacking from director Lommel's other cheapo fare. It's weird but never boring, and for that, it passes as party material  the kind of flick you watch with friends on the couch and revel in its oddness.

The DVD is presented in 1:1.78 / 4:3 widescreen and features two German audio tracks (5.1 / 2.0). Special features are abundant and include a trailer, music videos, a talky making-of feature, artwork, press releases, and a now-outdated Daniel Kblbck discography. This agreeable package helps make the film worth purchasing, but in the end, you ought to know yourself well before shelling out a potentially large amount of money to a third-party seller.",1487635200,,2917,5.8014018691588785
