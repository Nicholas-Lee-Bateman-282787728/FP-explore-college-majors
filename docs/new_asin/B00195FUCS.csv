3423653,5,B00195FUCS,Love this series.  It is so stupid it is funny.  We laughed out loud at almost every episode because the Jenner boys are so out there.,1354492800,,134,4.115384615384615
3423654,4,B00195FUCS,"Having never heard of this series before buying it, I was interested in how Brodie and Spencer acted before ""The Hills"".
I found that (and it is difficult to say it) Spencer seemed like a pretty funny guy. Just a typical young guy, clowning around.
I thought David Foster seemed like an over-reacter (sp?) in most episodes. I understood where he comes from, or what he was trying to accomplish, but he seemed more childish than the boys on more than one occasion.
I really quite enjoyed this series after not expecting much.
If watching people wasting loads and loads of cash on a regular basis offends you in any way, don't watch this! Otherwise it is quite a surprising peek into the lives of the filthy rich and famous.

3423655,5,B00195FUCS,"The Princes of Malibu is reality TV taken to such a cartoonish extreme that it can't really be considered reality TV anymore - I mean, once you've put a full-on dream sequence into your show (as well as an army of Elvises, multiple attempts to sell music awards on eBay, more celebrity cameos than a 2000s era Simpsons episode, and musical stings fo each character) your pretensions of showing real life have pretty well gone out the window.

The central conceit of the show is that multimillionare record producer David Foster's two stepsons have just been kicked out of college and are living it up at his Malibu mansion, making a huge mess and holding gigantic parties without his knowledge.  So Foster tells them that if they don't start paying $10,000 a month in rent, he'll throw them out.  Ignoring all thoughts of getting jobs, the boys turn to their permanent houseguest and ""best friend"" Spencer Pratt (who is also an executive producer on the show) and start scheming and scamming.

But really, has reality TV ever been about realism?  I don't think so.  Reality TV is about insanely over-the-top situations and people in the same manner as scripted TV, it is just a bit more improvisational (in theory) than a scripted sitcom.  ""Princes"" takes this to its logical extreme.  So, why should you, dear reader, watch the show?

1. For the hilariously over-the-top schemes.  I don't want to give away too much, but essentially you have the wacky hijinks of the Simpsons or Ed, Edd, and Eddy but done in real life (for certain values of real life).  The boys are like obnoxious frat boys given an unlimited budget and told to scheme, and things get zany fast.

2. For the strange frission of rooting for and against pretty much every character simultaneously.  David's right in just about everything he says, but he still comes across as if he's also rude and insulting to people who don't deserve it.  The boys may be lazy, ungrateful, and the like, but in a sense they typify a rebellion against authority that I think everyone can on some level identify with.  It seems like to see them as completely ""the enemy"", you'd really have to see Michael's goofy ideas in The Office as ""unfunny, because they could hurt the company's long-term survivability"", and the Three Stooges as simply poor role models for our children with their excessive eye-based violence.

3. To see Spencer Pratt in something before The Hills - sure, he's still kind of a scumbag, but here, he is at least a semi-likeable scumbag.

4. To recapture the mood of wicked excess in 2003-04 that gripped certain segments of our society -  one can see the show as, like Dynasty or Dallas, a sort of period piece.  When your children ask what caused the housing bubble, you can show them ""Princes of Malibu"" and say ""those people, mostly"".

General internet reaction seems to be against the show, but I urge you to give it a try - I watched it with my cousins last summer and we all found it hilarious.  And hey, it's only $8 - certainly much cheaper than a new movie, and it's about 4 hours of content (no commentary either, just straight episodes).",1264204800,7,3122,4.670932358318098

8272069,5,B00195FUCS,"This show was so hilarious, and I was obsessed with the lift that went from the ground up to the house, the bannister of which, the Jenner boys never failed to jump off of into the pool.  I talked about this show all the time and wished it had survived several more seasons.  I was thrilled when I found the DVD on Amazon!!  I didn't hesitate to press the buy button!

David Foster, a renown record producer & multi-Grammy winner, tried so hard to teach his step-sons the value of work and money, and they weren't having it . . . unless, of course, it involved fun or marking David regret his words.  I went from a household run like David wanted his run to a household with step-sons, so I could relate!  Oh, how I cringed when David would pop up after the boys had gotten into their shenanigans just knowing he was going to freak out, and his wife, Linda (once married to Bruce Jenner), just wrote it off as boys-will-be-boys.  I guess that's why David is now married to Yolanda . . . and looking a lot happier & healthier I might add! The Jenner boys weren't bad to look at either, but now I can see them on this DVD any time I want a peak or by catching an episode of Keeping Up With The Kardashians every now and then.  They have both matured since this series, but I'm thrilled to have this show/DVD in my collection so that I can watch them at their most mischievous.

I received this product quickly and in excellent condition.  Thank you, Seller!",1375401600,3,1455,4.2773722627737225
