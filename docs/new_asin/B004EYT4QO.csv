8475124,4,B004EYT4QO,Great HD quality.  full screen even on 52in HDTV flat screen.  music is NEW AGE meditation excellent quality as such.  find this one great for room noise as i cook in kitchen or putz amongst my chores in the house.,1353888000,,214,4.3
8475125,2,B004EYT4QO,"The background ""music"" is annoying, not soothing.  I would have preferred to hear just the sounds of the environment.  The elevator music is almost painful.",1352851200,,156,5.2
8475126,5,B004EYT4QO,"LOVE THIS!. I found an iPad app too of the same thing. It even has the ability to turn different sounds on and off with a great desk clock. so nice to put the iPad on its stand at work and have it in the background. ...don't forget to plug it in though.

8475127,1,B004EYT4QO,"I was disappointed with the quality of the film.
It is pretty basic and it is almost like a home made film.
It doesn't have many choices , just the one film, and the music is not the best either.",1326758400,,195,3.9
8475128,5,B004EYT4QO,"All my friends know what a big fan of Zen Gardens I am. I visit them whenever I can. And this one is one of the best Zen Garden DVD's I've ever purchased. And I'm picky. The imagery was gorgeous, totally relaxing, and top notch professional production throughout. I've never realized what an important feature that water has become in Zen Gardens, and this DVD really brings that out. I love the shots. Love the auto replay so I don't have to get up (I'm lazy.) But what really sold me was the music. Usually the music is usually something I want to turn off. But the Water music on this DVD was just beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, with or without the imagery. My girlfriend kept asking me to turn up the sound. Good sign. She's very picky as I am. Again, I thought this DVD was totally high quality and worthwhile if you're into Japanese Zen gardens like I am. Or if you're just into chilling out. Very relaxing stuff.",1292198400,2,921,4.423529411764706
