4227940,2,B003Y84OWU,"This flick is about as disjointed as  one would expect of a ""B"" move and this case the B stands for bad.  Unless you keep the title in front of you at all times to remind yourself why you are there, you will not begin to be able to fallow the plot.  The viewer is overwhelmed with blood and gore  to such an extent that the story line if you can call it that is lost in the shadows.  From there on you are up to your armpits in hookers and police officers that don't seem to have a reason for being there with the bodies being kind of incidental to their presents.  Then finally in the end you think you may have figured it out and they throw in a curve that leaves the viewer unsure if the actual problem has been solved.  I suppose one could go back and watch it a second time to get some clue as to the real outcome but in this case the pain is to great!  I would pass on this one and if necessary opt for prime time TV!",1400716800,2,923,3.872340425531915

4227942,1,B003Y84OWU,Obviously this is a b movie. i like the cheesey ones sometimes but this one was acted horribly. the worst cameras or lenses were used. it doesn't seem like any genre even. not scary and no scary feel. not comedic or dramatic. i don't know what it even was. id rather watch the grass grow n i don't meen the good kind,1384300800,2,316,4.112903225806452
4227943,1,B003Y84OWU,Not only did this film truly have a stupid plot and low grade 'actors'. It continued to assault the viewer with its derogatory view of women. I don't mind watching mindless B movies but I want my money back on this one. It was insulting. I hope the cameraman got his rocks off on all the ass shots.,1345680000,,298,4.155172413793103
8408907,3,B003Y84OWU,Seems like someone wrote a script for a movie so a bunch of girls can take their tops off. The movie has a T&A rating of 3.5/5. It's silly salacious entertainment.,1524873600,,163,4.290322580645161
