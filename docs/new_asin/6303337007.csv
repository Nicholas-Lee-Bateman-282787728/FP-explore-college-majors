I was anxious to get it again. I was dissappointed to get it in VHS.  I would love to find it in DVD.",1348963200,,239,3.627450980392157
627056,5,6303337007,"A Martinique film of many dimensions, with a deep and dark story to tell of the post-slavery period, unfortunately virtually indistinguishable from the age of slavery itself for the cane workers. Sad, funny, bitter, cheerful, angry ... but ever hopeful for young and very bright Jose, about whom the story is told. His guardian, Amantine, is an old woman who, while working the cane fields herself, never wants him to have to.  Seeing education as his way out of Black Shack Alley, she works her heart out to make sure he succeeds. I especially liked the scenes with Mr. Medouze, a very old cane cutter with little to look forward to but dying; only then can he ""return"" to Africa, a land he has never seen. He apparently lived his entire life in the sugar cane.  He relates his wise and colorful stories in a manner that borders on the truly frightening.  In fact, none of this film treats old Martinique kindly; it is shown as despicably racist. Great acting throughout, superb cinematography, outstanding script, fantastic direction: a virtually perfect, world-class film in every way.",1346544000,,1088,4.870270270270271

It was good to see that it was available on Amazon at a great price! it is set in French Martinque in the 1930's & it has English subtitles.  I love indie films & alternative films!

Beautiful movie, excellent discussion points, interesting for teenagers.  Definitely worth it.",1339718400,,262,4.777777777777778

627060,5,6303337007,"Sugar Cane Alley,A New Yorker films release,the same company that released Dona Flor and her 2 Husbands amongst others,brings 1930's Martinique to life,in a bittersweet provocative film about a little boy Jose growing up in a poor sharecropper/servitude like existance in what is called""black Alley"".Jose has a hardworking,loving, but tough grandmother as his sole relation(no mention really made of his mother or father)Also for moral spiritual support his best friend an elderly man called Medouze;who teches Jose about life and to think big beyond his present condition. Carmen is Jose's friend as well a boatman/house servant who is a charming ladies man who dreams of making it in Hollywood. This movie is filmed in a dreamy sepia tone color that's attractive AND interesting,I've never seen anything like it before this film,it serves to highlight the charecters and time and place extremely well. There are many charecters who come in and out of Jose's life and he takes them and all their idosyncrasies in stride,he's very mature responsible and has more common sense than most of the adults in the movie yet he is still a boy. I loved this film for the child's intelligence and looking at the world from his eye's. His world is harsh and at times cruel on many levels,However he maintains his focus on getting an education and providing his grandmother with a life that will be comfortable and filled with all the good things they've never had. I know many people don't care for subtitled films,this should be the exception,it's really worth viewing!,it gives you a good feeling to see this child being victorious over everything and knowing he will make it, no matter what life puts in his path. If you do buy or rent this film I also recommend the documentary""The Agronomist"" it's not exactly like this film b ut worth checking out.",1323043200,,1843,4.948387096774193

627062,5,6303337007,"This was an excelent film.... It is applicable to any society, particularly Criolo, or in french 'creole' society; mixing of European and African ancestry. This reminded me so much of my own Cape Verdean Culture. Although, Cape Verdeans are Criolo mostly from African and Portuguese heritage, the stories are just about the same. An interesting voice from a different part of the world, depicting human dignity, genuinity and effects of Crioloness. Highly recommend this interesting take on humanity from Creole part of the world...",1211241600,,532,5.345238095238095
627063,5,6303337007,"I have grown up watching this movie and am now glad that I own it on DVD.  It's one of my all time favorites.  It successfully projects pride and respect that Caribbeans often have and are at times misunderstood for by others.  Poverty does not equate necessarily one's morals, ethics and life skills.  There is much emphasis on education and utilizing the resources large or small to achieve one's goals and live a better life. Many with a Caribbean background can relate to some of the idiosyncrasies that Ma Tine has such as children should not look at adults in the eye.  Many of us I'm sure can relate to the switch spanking.

The village of Rue Casse Negres is composed of adults who were born free on the island but are still slaves to the sugar cane plantations.  The story takes place post abolition showing its effects on blacks. It provides a realistic portrayal of how though poverty makes live hard, it need not be identified with.  I usually find that I don't like books that have been depicted into movies, however this is the only exception.  Both the book and the movie are capable of standing on their own.  Just be aware that if you read the book first, the movie is different adding portions that were not in the book.  In this movie for example, Jose's mother is deceased.  In the book, she is alive and a",1208390400,,1326,4.479166666666667
627064,4,6303337007,"This movie depicts the life of sugar cane field workers in the French Caribbean and the great difficulty they have in doing anything else but working in the fields.  It is also a delightful movie on poor blacks in the Caribbean, showing the day-to-day fun of the youth, and the real, practical concerns of their parents. In many respects it shows the intensiveness of Sugar cane harvesting, and is a nice movie to view for those who are interested in the story of sugar and its great impact on the modern Western Civilization.  The movie is a nice companion to the great anthropologist Sidney Mintz' book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sweetness-and-Power-The-Place-of-Sugar-in-Modern-History/dp/0140092331/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sweetness and Power: The Place of Sugar in Modern History</a>. The unknown actors are a treat for both their innocence and naturalness. Two to note are the main character of the movie, a young boy named Jose and an old man in the movie whose facial expressions and words stay with you long after the movie is over (particularly in the scene with Jose and him around a fire). To get more technical, the movie was not fantastic as there were not too many scenes that resonated more than this one just mentioned, the movie was however simply delightful.  For Language buffs a nice introduction to Caribbean French.",1204502400,,1389,5.421296296296297
627374,5,6303337007,"SUGAR CANE ALLEY was my introduction to the culture of Martinique during the 1930s.  This beautiful 1983 release, directed by Euzhan Palcy, is a powerful and sensitively made character study.  It follows the plight of Jose (Garry Cadenat), an eleven year old boy living with his grandmother, M'Man Tine (Darling Legitimus) in one of the poorest sections of the island.  The only way the locals can (barely) sustain themselves is to toil away in the sugar cane fields (hence, the title of the film)-- a back-breaking and thankless job.  The one way out of this toil and poverty is a good education.  M'Man Tine knows this all too well and wants to spare her grandson the pain, anguish and great struggle that they encounter around them in spades.  Jose applies himself in school and proves himself to be an eloquent, intelligent and wise-beyond-his-years writer.  Will Jose's true gift be his (and his grandmother's) ticket out of the slums?  You'll have to watch the film and see for yourself.

SUGAR CANE ALLEY received critical acclaim for its sensitive and realistic portrayal of the poor, Black experience in 1930s Martinique.  This is a must-see for French students, anyone interested in the culture/history of Martinique or anyone looking to watch a powerful film about the triumph of the human spirit in the face of great adversity.  Just beautiful......",1195171200,,1361,5.004444444444444
627375,5,6303337007,"Euzhan Palcy's warm, deeply felt film about mentorship and sacrifice is a life-affirming experience, and springs from autobiographical roots. Palcy recreates the plantation life with a keen sense of balance, offsetting the squalid conditions of workers with an authentic feeling of community and the innocence of childhood. All the central players are superb, particularly Cadenat and Legitimus. Another hidden gem.",1183939200,,415,5.933333333333334
627376,5,6303337007,"I'm delighted that this film is finally on DVD. A 'growing up' tale of a boy and his grandmother's determination to see him leave the sugarcane plantations and achieve a better life.

Memorable film making, this is not a complicated story, but clearly deeply felt by the writer/director, and it has a old fashioned depth and pace to it that contrasts vividly (to this film's advantage) with Hollywood's empty flashiness.

It reminds me in some ways of another little-known gem and growingup tale, Allen Fong's Father and Son, a Hong Kong movie.

One quibble - why change the name?

A big hand however for making this available on DVD and resisting the temptation to dub it for American audiences, who apparently don't like sub-titles...",1125705600,,736,4.911290322580645
627377,5,6303337007,"I really enjoyed this movie. Seeing a story of what life was like during that time in the Caribbean really showed me that black people are the same no matter where we are. This move is about a young man growing up in a sugar cane field and he is very smart and talented. He has the family support he needs around him, and with his intelligence and determination, he wins a scholarship to a top school in the island's main town. What makes it more powerful is that by the time he achieves all this success, his father figure and mother figure die. It is almost as if they were meant to be in his life to carry him to that point and then leave the earth because they did they came to do.

I don't care that the movie was in French with English subtitles, I really wish that people made more movies like this. Very good movie.",1121731200,,823,4.14375

627379,5,6303337007,"A story about an 11 year old boy, Palcy, who was sent to live with his  grandmother. Writer-director Euzhan Palcy tried to show you how important education and respect was growing up in the 1930's in a black community in Martinique. Palcy's grandmother believes he is a smart boy and he won't get anywhere working on the sugar cane fields. She will do anything to make sure he gets a good education. That means giving up her job on the Sugar cane fields and moving to a new city so Palcy can get the education he deserves. This movie shows the respect children had for there parents, and how much the parents will do to make sure there children are taken care of. After working long days on the Sugar cane fields parents come home and make sure there children have enough to eat and clothes to wear. This movie also shows how much a community sticks together and looks after one another. When an old man was missing the whole community go together to find him. This was a great movie. It touchs your heart and makes you think.",1102896000,,1026,4.4
627380,5,6303337007,"Sugar Cane Alley is a simple story but its import to the body of moving images which depict 'Black' life is tremendous. The story is alternately funny, tragic and poignant. Palcy has captured a way of life, being and understanding that is no doubt endangered by the push to so-called 'democratize' every inch of the planet. It is beautifully shot and well cast. I haven't viewed it in a few years but its images, rhythm and resonance still reside within my psyche, in my soul. We're all more human because this film exists.",1102464000,,523,4.634408602150538

627382,5,6303337007,"The first time I saw this film was in college when our history teacher showed it to us to aide in our discussion of the post emancipation period in West Indian culture.  It is one of the most dramatic and historically correct films I have ever seen.  The issues dealt with reflect the concerns of the ""free man"". One can see the emerging importance of education in the building up of the free black community in Martinique during that period as well as the nature of black /white relationships on all levels. For anyone who desires to know more about post emancipation life in the West Indies this is your most entertaining chance. I praise this most dedicated and talented Caribbean film director for an excellent review of a most interesting period in West Indian life. This is and will always be one of my favorite films next to The Sound of Music and Schindler's List.

7843874,5,6303337007,"There isn't much to add to the substantive reviews already recorded here.  ""Sugar Cane Alley"" is a fascinating period piece on 1930s Martinique.  It's also a timeless reflection on family, education, post-slavery emancipation, colonialism, work, power and resistance.  I never tire of watching it, and it always stimulates students.  The entire cast deserves one of the highest compliments paid to actors: you can't tell they're acting.

Here is another resource which can help viewers to get even more out of the film:

<> Albert O Hirschman, ""Exit, Voice, Loyalty: Responses to Decline in Firms, Organizations & States"" <>

It's a brief academic work on economics, but consider how the three main youthful characters perfectly embody the strategic responses of the title.  It makes even more sense knowing that Joseph Zobel, author of the original novel ""Rue des Cases Negres"" and inspiration for young Jose's character, exited Martinique altogether and lived for decades in Senegal and France.

An adventurous teacher seeking to challenge students could put together a very good assignment using the film, Hirschman's book (or its introductory pages), and some other resources.  Along with its didactic elements, the film succeeds brilliantly as pure entertainment.  Enjoy!",1387584000,,1276,5.459183673469388
