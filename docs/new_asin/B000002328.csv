7902107,2,B000002328,"This tape offers episodes 17-18 of ""Maison Ikkoku,"" the popular 1986 Japanese animated TV series based on Rumiko Takahashi's manga. Viewers are advised to gain some familiarity with at least the three main characters making up the tenuous love triangle that dominates this romantic comedy-drama: Godai, a 20-year-old college student in love with Kyoko, a 22-year-old widow who manages the dorm where he resides, and Kozue, a local girl who loves Godai. The first episode, ""The Story of Kyoko's First Love or Rainy Days Like These...,"" offers a meditation on the effects of rain, both good and ill, on burgeoning romance, and includes a flashback to Kyoko's middle school crush on a new teacher. The second episode, ""Kyoko's Gift! 'What, You Mean It's For Me?,'"" is the one that justifies the ""Winter's Yarn"" heading, since both Kyoko and Kozue make knitted items of winter clothing as Christmas gifts for Godai, who feels obligated to reciprocate even though he has little in the way of money. It's a charming story, but it should be pointed out to fans of Rumiko Takahashi's other popular series, ""Ranma "" and ""Urusei Yatsura"" (featuring Lum, the eye-popping alien babe in the tiger skin bikini), that ""Maison Ikkoku"" is quite tame in comparison, lacking as it does the supernatural/sci-fi elements that provide the manic comic energy and twisted humor that sustained those celebrated shows.",1058659200,,1392,5.109649122807017
