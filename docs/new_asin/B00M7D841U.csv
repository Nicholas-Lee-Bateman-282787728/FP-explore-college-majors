6563281,5,B00M7D841U,"I've been looking for this on DVD for years.  It retains most of the nostalgic charm that I remember from my childhood; however, there are moments in some episodes that come across infantile rather than slapstick.  The animation is similar to shows such as Masters of the Universe; the settings are lush and colorful with impressive detail.  Most significant is the fact that this show boasts voice talents of the show's original cast is its most charming aspect, and it is a pleasure to be reunited with the castaways of the SS Minnow.",1419811200,29,536,4.741935483870968

6563284,4,B00M7D841U,"Okay, here is the thing.....There were two Gilligan's Island cartoons in the mid-70s. The first was 'The New Adventures of Gilligan'. The second was this collection, 'Gilligan's Planet'. Both series did not include Tina Louise's voice. It's also interesting that they even gave Ginger white hair and a very different look. In this series, MaryAnn and Ginger are both voiced by the lovely Dawn Wells. This was a short lived series but it is a must-have for a serious Gilligan collector but probably not the casual watcher. The stories try to teach a lesson and obviously geared to very young children. The adults will mostly just enjoy hearing the original castaway voices minus one. This was as hard to find as both TV movies 'The Castaways on Gillgans Island' and 'The Harlem Globetrotters on Gilligan's Island'. This cartoon series was also very cheaply made by Filmation studios but at least it is something different than only the original series. I have no idea why this was released before the Gilligan cartoon series that came before it but perhaps they are waiting to release the first series with the supposed Gilligan's Island movie that is spreading around as a real film but seems to always soon moved to the back-burner.
The other problem is that this is only available in the direct order mode. So it is quickly burned to a disk cheaply when ordered. I've found that some DVDs made like this are not easily played on DVD players, especially if they are compressed too much. Anyway, it's a cute cartoon series and worth having as one more GI item. Hope you enjoy it.",1413244800,14,1579,4.766423357664234

6563308,3,B00M7D841U,"For most consumers who appreciate vintage TV classics,""GILLIGAN'S ISLAND"" is a serious winner in this department-but Saturday Morning cartoons are a whole other area,depending on your tastes,,and in the case of ""GILLIGAN'S PLANET"",this has an interesting history. making it's debut on CBS,the very network that originally launched the classic series in 1964,this Filmation produced cartoon series,the second of two versions,the first,being ""THE NEW ADVENTURES OF GILLIGAN"" for ABC in Fall 1974 (under ABC Funshine Saturday) was a nostalgia laiden
concept,reminding viewers of something like ""LOST IN SPACE"",but with the goofy concepts that only Sherwood Schwartz could muster-up,since afterall,his creation was enjoying great success,with the revival TV specials (""RESCUE FROM GILLIGAN'S ISLAND"" in 1978) it was only fitting,that Filmation Associates was asked to bring back another cartoon series,based on this classic series-but it was also the studio's ""swan song"",as ""GILLIGAN'S PLANET"" would be Filmation's last cartoon series for Network Saturday morning TV,one year before their hit syndicated series,""HE-MAN AND THE MASTERS OF THE UNIVERSE"" made it's debut in Fall 1983,and put the studio into a whole other ball game! but for the many consumers like myself,who enjoys and appreciates material like this,the 1982 cartoon series is a true treasure for the nostalgic minded
viewers,who know and understand these shows,and their intentions-and Filmation,with it's all too short 25 year history,was in the business to entertain and amuse,inspite of the criticism they got,with their limited animation,they still managed to crank-out great cartoons,like their competition from Hanna-Barbera,DePatie-Freleng,and Rankin-Bass,they ruled and dominated the weekends! and with ""GILLIGAN'S PLANET"",this,like the previous series,did exceptionally well,,even managing to bring back Dawn Wells,who voiced both ""Mary Ann"" and ""Ginger"" in this version! i recommend this DVD to both fans of good Saturday morning cartoons,and fans of ""GILLIGAN'S ISLAND"",who won't be disappointed!",1456963200,,2070,6.092465753424658
6563309,4,B00M7D841U,"Obviously, this cartoon follows the 3 season show 'Gilligan's Island."" In this 13 episode last gasp series (some of them surprisingly good), the castaways build a ship and manage to get off the island, but end up lost on another planet. The real cheat here is that some years earlier, they had been rescued for good in the late 70s film ""The Castaways on Gilligan's Island."" But we won't worry about small details.

Except for Tina Louise (Ginger), everyone came back to voice their characters. Even Jim Backus who was seriously ill at the time, came back to reprise his character. While this is obviously a final sequel to the series, the feel is different. More cartoon action, some stranger plots, and in my opinion this pushes further beyond the lines of absurd than the tv series. But ironically, once you accept that it is different, you start seeing the similarities more.  One notable difference is that Ginger is more ditzy and airheaded in this final cartoon, and Mary Anne is notably more intelligent. (She often seems to serve as an assistant to the professor.) I don't want to say she's tomboyish. But she kind of almost is here.

(1) ""I Dream of Genie"" The castaways find a robot that grants wishes. And we see the difference between what kindhearted Gilligan wants, and what ambitious Mr. H wants. This is a surprisingly good first episode that actually would have made a better last episode.  (2) ""Turnabout"" Kind of a weak slapstick episode that relies on the Skipper's chauvinistic attitude. (3) ""Let Sleeping Minnows Lie"" A surprisingly good episode  that seems to be a reaction against the way Smaug was handled in J.R.R. Tolkien's ""The Hobbit.""  Are creatures really dangerous, or are they just protecting their area? (4) ""Journey to the Center of Gilligan's Planet"" Arguably the best episode. Gilligan is reading a comic book, and his book apparently comes to life. His friends are kidnapped. And after 'goofing off all morning,' Gilligan must rise to the occasion and save his friends. VERY GOOD episode that could have been a full length horror film. This episode alone was worth the price of admission.

(5) ""Colossal Gilligan"" Weak episode. Gilligan is turned into a giant. (6) ""Bumper to Bumper"" Ok episode. Gilligan's pet dinosaur feels he has been abused too much and runs away. Not a bad episode. (7) ""Road to Boom"" Surprisingly sad and serious (but well done) episode. The castaways feel their time is almost up. And in a touching and sad moment they decide how they want to be remembered, and prepare a shuttle to launch back to earth for the sake of their memory. FOR ONCE, it's NOT Gilligan's fault! And we see Gilligan get angry and annoyed at the culprit. What irony!  (8) ""Too Many Gilligans"" Funny and surprisingly well done episode that shows us how we can be driven mad (and drive others mad) when copies of ourselves suddenly appear.

(9) ""Space Pirates"" Alright. Not the greatest episode, but watchable. (10) ""Invaders of the Lost Barque"" Surprisingly good episode where Gilligan and the castaways must fight another group for a chance to escape the planet. Does Gilligan mess this up, or does he suddenly feel that sometimes we have to think outside ourselves? (11) ""Wings"" Great episode with a serious glitch. A spaceship finds itself on the island and many fight over the chance to fly it back to earth and get some media attention. Good episode but flawed in that Gilligan is part of the madness at one point, and then later shows himself to be outside it. (12) ""Super Gilligan"" Sadly bad episode. (13) ""Gilligan's Army"" Interesting final episode. Not great, but it does draw attention to the common incompetence of upper powers, the tyranny of bullies, and why Gilligan despite his faults is a true hero. (At least sometimes.)

Many people don't consider this to really be a part of ""Gilligan's Island."" It's basically the final gasps of a show that ended some years earlier. All I can say is I enjoyed quite a number of the episodes. And you should probably give it a fair chance before you say it's not part of the saga.",1456617600,3,4069,4.77524893314367
6563310,4,B00M7D841U,I'm glad they released this as I am with all classic cartoons but ...it's this. lol You know what this is. It's less watchable then the show unless your a big Gilligan Fan,1448841600,,171,4.212121212121212

6563319,4,B00M7D841U,"This is the closest thing to a cast reunion you can get to see even if it's only the voices. It's been so long since I seen them although I did view a few on youtube. It's good to get a clean quality and audio. I forgot about Bumper the little green alien friend of Gilligan. I found him annoying like Bat-mite on the Batman cartoons. The DVD includes the complete series of 13 episodes. 9 on disc one and 4 on disc 2. No extras. I would like to hear about the background stories be it just the writers,  cartoonist, archivist or anyone involved. I do enjoy watching them but of course this isn't like the original TV series that you get to see the Skipper's expression towards the camera, Jim Backus ad libbing to the script or the slapstick routines of the cast members.
The DVD case doesn't include any listings of the episodes so I actually made my own contents and placed in the clam shell case.

6563323,5,B00M7D841U,"Gilligan's Planet is just like Gilligan's Island but now they are animated and on a planet. Only other big difference is all characters voice their own character except Dawn Wells who played Mary Ann now voices not ONLY Mary Ann but ALSO Ginger Grant. Also, Ginger Grant has white hair instead of red. You will love all the little quirks Gilligan has just as you did in the original.
For anyone not familiar with Gilligan's Island, this is the story of 7 people marooned on a Planet after finally escaping their island paradise in an attempt to return home. The Skipper (voiced by Alan Hale, Jr.), Gilligan (Bob Denver), Mr. Howell (Jim Backus), Mrs. Howell (Natalie Schafer), Mary Ann AND Ginger Grant (Dawn Wells) and The Professor (Russell Johnson). In this one, Gilligan has an alien sidekick and they all begin a whole new life on another planet while still trying to repair the SS Minnow (now a space craft).
This wonderful collection to your library is a complete series with 2 DVD's.",1420934400,11,991,4.734104046242774
6563324,2,B00M7D841U,The  show episodes where  juet flat and little in the way of being funny. The limits of animate at that time was all to clear in the series.

It was fun to see Gilligan and the group as cosmic castaways and to hear six out of seven of the original voice cast (no Tina Louise but Dawn Wells playing both Mary Ann and Ginger).
