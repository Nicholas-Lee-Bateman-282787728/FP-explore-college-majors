8759807,1,B01EYW331C,"I do enjoy shows like  A Haunting,  Paranormal  Witness and Hell House. so when I found this I thought this would be right down my alley. The first show on disc one Haunted North America and ""Ghosts  At Sea"" are the only decent things about this set. The rest is just the stupid  ""ghost  hunting "" crap. So disappointed in this, I guess this will be getting donated to the library.",1472860800,2,381,4.295774647887324
