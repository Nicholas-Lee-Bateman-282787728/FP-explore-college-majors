Great music, screenplay, everything ! Set in 1970/71 Arizona, the story  deals with the brutal reality of those that would hunt Buffalo for sport  (sick), and the negative vibes against those with long hair (hippies). One  of my favorite movies of ALL TIME.  I even searched out Bill Mumy's webpage  to offer thanks and praises !  Only a COMPLETE Loser wouldn't like this  movie. I gave it 5 Stars !",966384000,20,546,4.604166666666667
517015,5,6302765188,"More than twenty-eight years after its release, this poignant and exquisitely affecting film based on the Glendon Swarthout novel still resonates deeply with this 41-year-old film buff.  I first saw the film in  January 1972 as a gawky, hideously homely 13-year-old who was taller than  everyone else at Kennedy Junior High in Hays, Kansas and who faced constant  cruelty and teasing - simply for being ""different.""  Thus, I  related to the ""Bedwetters"" as I was convinced no one else could  have.  The boys' camp counselor, portrayed with menacing conviction by Ken  Swofford, was familiar to me as well.  There was a ""Wheaties"" in  every schoolhouse, townhouse and outhouse of my young life.  Moreover, I  was and have always been an avowed animal lover, and the young men's  efforts to save a herd of buffalo from extinction touched my heart and  stirred my soul.  The excellent cast is notable for the presence of  then-17-year-old Bill Mumy, four years removed from his starring role as  little Will Robinson on TV's ""Lost in Space.""  As the brooding,  taciturn Lawrence Teft III, Mumy brings a sauntering, sexy charisma to his  performance - light years away from the apple-cheeked cherub of the 1960's.  This haunting and instructive film leaves us with disturbing lessons about  the price enacted by pervasive rejection and negativity - and the  redemptive power of unity and compassion.",951868800,32,1395,5.070796460176991

517017,2,6302765188,"um...disturbed much? Well...I was checking this out to see the cast list, and I must say, the book is much much better than the movie. I just gave it two stars because the movie seems more interesting when you watch it with a  bunch of classmates, who suddenly become critics when the movie doesn't  follow the book. And the theme song's annoying. Teft and Lally 1 are real  ugly. Plus there's the matter of Cotton's voice and hair. He's supposed to  be a redhead. And in the movie it's brown. Brown. Huh. Also this movie  contained a lot of unnecessary parts that didn't even have anything similar  to them in the book! They won't be specified.",939772800,3,645,4.517241379310345

517145,4,6302765188,"As a resident of the Arizona county (Yavapai) where most of the movie was filmed, I'd heard about this film for years and always had a hankering to watch it, just to see scenes of Prescott, Jerome, and Sedona as they looked in 1971. Upon watching the film I was delighted to find that the story line and message of the movie actually holds up pretty well. The young cast, led by Billy Mumy of ""Lost in Space"" fame is appealing and fun.
(Though I do have to say some of the summer camp scenes of the kids standing around in their tighty-whities was a little too ""Lord of the Flies""!)
Overall, the message of kindness and humane treatment of animals translates to today. Plus, the adventure of the kids as they wander loose across beautiful western scenery and small towns, figuring things out as they go along is of interest to everyone, not just folks like me laughing and pointing to see familiar locations represented on the screen.",1448582400,,934,4.5325443786982245

517277,4,6302765188,"The motto for Box Canyon Boys Camp is ""Send us a boy ... We'll send you a Cowboy"". At the beginning of the movie six boys, along with their councilor, are alone in camp. The rest of the campers are gone on a pack-trip. While their councilor sleeps the six boys run away with the intention of saving a herd of Buffalo.

The movie follows the boys on their quest to save the Buffalo, this journey takes them a little over 24 hours and includes a number of hardships. During the journey the movie audience sees a number of flashbacks which fill-in a little of the background on each of the boys, why they were sent to camp, and how they were adapting (or not adapting) to camp life. The flashbacks also explain why the Buffalo need saving, and how the boys know about the situation.

These six boys are a group of misfits which remind me of the boys in the 1976 version of ""The Bad News Bears"". The boys attitudes are similar, their sports abilities are similar, they even have yellow shirts and frequently use profanity. However please note that this movie came out five years prior to ""The Bad News Bears"".

The movie touches on some heavy subjects (bullying, child abuse and animal cruelty) but does not get preachy about it, the movie lets the actions speak for themselves. In fact, despite the profanity, the bulling, the infighting among the boys, the hardships on the quest and the violence associated with the Buffalo the movie maintains a reasonably light and easy going atmosphere, in a dark comedy sort of way.",1411862400,2,1518,4.553113553113553

517333,5,6302765188,"I saw this movie the year it was released...1971. I was a 15 year old high school sophomore girl with a life-long passion for animals and their welfare, which I still have at the age of 58. The movie and the book, although slightly different, as noted by ""Long Tom"", both moved me, brought tears to my eyes, and sadly introduced me to the cruelty and horror of ""canned hunting"". The movie and the book also gave me my first lesson in Diversity Awareness. I learned that it was okay to be different. As a child who was bullied, I totally understood how The Misfits felt. In addition to raising awareness about canned hunting and animal cruelty, the book and movie were ahead of their time and absolutely right-on for bringing awareness to bullying and the effect it can have on a child...sometimes a life-long effect. What I took from the book and movie is that everyone has something to bring to the party -- and that everyone deserves to be treated the way I want to be treated...with dignity and respect.

I would recommend this movie (and the book) to anyone who LOVES animals and strongly believes in their right to live long and peaceful lives. Really, who cares if the cinematography is not the best??? Or that an evening scene in the book is a day-time scene in the movie??? Darkness does lend to the suspense, but the same important message is there - day or night. And who cares how poor Cotton dies??? It's just so sad that he dies, but then, many people have for their personal ""cause"". I don't remember the acting being stellar, but then again, that's okay (with me) because really, it's all about the message.

I am buying this movie for my almost three year old grandson Crosby. We will watch it together some day when he is old enough to hear the coarse language (and know that ""is not how we talk""), and when he is old enough to understand, with my help and that of his parents, the important messages and life-lessons this movie teaches us. All we have to do is open our hearts and our minds. :-)

One example is that the boy's mission to free the buffalo took place under cover of night, and everything was done in the daytime.  Why?  Rumor has it that they didn't have the budget to do nighttime photography.

Another is that the movie has anti-gun messages that weren't in the book.  The counselor has pistols in his trunk (Huh???) that Teft broke into, and the ending has Cotton shot to death in the truck by bad guys.  (The book ends where the truck crashes into the ravine, for unclear reasons.)

517372,5,6302765188,"When I first saw this flawed film in 1971 in the theater at age 30, I so loved it that I decided it was the best movie I ever
saw.  Based on the book by Gordon Swarthout, the film is about 6, misfit adolescent boys who sneak away from their cowboy
summer camp to try and release buffaloes from a penned location in Arizona where they are killed at close range by
""hunters"" who drew lottery tickets to thin the herds.  This Government process actually did occur back in those days,
and the film includes official ""kill"" footage.  The movie itself is very emotional and a first class tearjerker.  It is one of only
two or three films in my life that actually made me cry profusely two or three times.  But after seeing it repeatedly in the
theatres, and later on VHS, and with more experience cinematically, I can see why it wasn't considered a great film.
The 6 boys are largely caricatures, and the film can't decide whether it is a comedy or a drama.  Some scenes are
buffoonish, and other's extremely real and disturbing.  But the climax mixes triumph and tragedy very effectively, which
was different from the book, and made the ending extremely powerful.  So while I still love the film, I can see why many
may find it too cloying and sentimental, or too realistic in some scenes, while corny or silly in others.  But since Stanley
Kramer is considered one of the great directors of film, a true buff owes it to him or herself to see it and decide where
it fits in his rather lengthy catalogue.",1353715200,9,1498,4.437956204379562

517379,5,6302765188,"I saw this movie when I was 16 years-old in a drive-in movie. It was hot and the mosquitoes down here in Florida will eat you alive if you didn't have a few of those burning incense-like repellent things on your dashboard.

It was that mood of smell and feeling that I watched the redneck counselor of the misfit cabin try to make ""men"" out of the boys who actually had hearts and souls. If that counselor had any brains himself he would have known that his treatment of the boys would have just pushed them together.

Add the slaughter of the buffalo and you have a catalyst for a story of how the misfits could strike back at their heartless world and bond with those buffalo whom they felt were also misfits. In the end the leader of the misfits suffered the same fate as the buffalo proving that people that don't fit in won't be treated any better than a dumb beast if they fight ""normality"".

Everyone wants to pick on Bill Mumy and talk about the long-haired, cigarette smoking, car stealing character he played in Bless the Beasts but let's face it; Lost in Space had been over for years and Will Robinson was just a character like any other and Dr. Smith was no where in sight. It was time for a change and since that time Mumy has played many other characters including a recurring role on Babylon 5.

The one thing no one mentions on any of these reviews is The Carpenters haunting theme song that even to this day can bring a tear to my eye as I think of the misfit slumped over the steering wheel of that Dodge power wagon with a bullet through his brain as the camera pulls back to show the look on the counselor's face when he realizes that he killed a human being and then a high shot of the buffalo pen as the other misfits run toward their dead friend, Cotton.

Karen Carpenter's voice fades:

""Bless the beasts....and the children......(softer) bless the beasts.....and the children.....(even softer)......bless the beasts and the children.....""

(Fade to black)

I dare any of you with a heart who ever really watched the movie and understood it to remember the ending and not shed a tear because don't we all feel like misfits sometimes?",1314489600,8,2158,4.473282442748092

517495,4,6302765188,"Bless the Beasts and Children (Stanley Kramer, 1971)

Stanley Kramer was one of the great unheralded directors of the sixties, perhaps because while his better-known contemporaries were churning out movie after movie, Kramer's compositions were brought down off the mountain by Moses every few years or so during his most brilliant period. Still, the sheer number of classic films from his oeuvre, compared to the number of films he directed, is impressive, to say the least. Bless the Beasts and Children is far less seen, and far less heralded, than such films as On the Beach or It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World. This is a crime.

Based on Glendon Swarthout's excellent novel of the same name (which was assigned reading when I was in sixth grade; my, how the world has changed), Bless the Beasts and Children begins with an unforgettable opening sequence: the six protagonists of the film penned in. The pen is opened, and hunters begin shooting, killing all of them save Cotton (Barry Robins). The hunter targeting him takes off her bandana, and he discovers it's his mother pulling the trigger-- at which point he wakes from his nightmare. Remember, this is the opening scene in the movie; we have no point of reference for these images yet. It is, at this stage in the game, raw image, and raw power. It's obvious from the get-go that Kramer knows what he's doing behind a camera, even if you're not enough of a film buff to have linked his name with his three Oscar nominations for Best Director (for Guess Who's Coming to Dinner?, Judgment at Nuremberg, and The Defiant Ones).

The rest of the movie is balanced between providing the context in which to fit the opening scene and giving backstories on the six main characters. While most people remember the score (the Carpenter-crooned title track was nominated for both an Oscar and a Grammy), the acting deserves a great deal of credit here. The kids are excellent, every last one of them. The adults who surround them are all at least of above-average acting quality. This was a quality casting job through and through. They had a solid script to work with (it is somewhat simplified when compared with the book, though that is to be expected with adaptations; also, a faithful adaptation of the book would have garnered an R, at the very least, from the MPAA), and coupled with Kramer's direction and the remarkable cinematography of Michael Hugo (Bob Rafelson's infamous Head is probably his best-known work), the whole package is tremendous.

That any Stanley Kramer film has fallen into obscurity is a travesty. That this is one of those that has is even more so. It deserves rediscovery. ****",1185926400,10,2659,4.799126637554585
517496,5,6302765188,"While this film might appear as somewhat dated, it is nevertheless a great movie. The story told is moving and thought provoking. And the imagery is breathtaking in spots. Obviously, the film likely had far more affect back when it came out, as buffalo were nearly extinct at the time. The story is still relevant, however. It shows what can happen when people (whether they be kids or adults) decide to make a difference.

Personally, this movie is on my top 10 list. The book is somewhat different in parts, but the film captures the spirit of Glendon Swarthout's written words. I've been to South Dakota and have seen the wild buffalo herd (about 1,500 strong) that roams throughout Custer State Park in that state. They're magnificent animals, and I can't imagine wanting to shoot them just for sport, never mind shooting them while defenseless or being unable to flee from the hunter's gun.

If you've never seen this movie, it is highly recommended. Great plot, excellent characters. Here's to the Bedwetters... Enjoy!",1174780800,5,1024,4.913294797687861

I remember it was on tv a few years later and again, I put this movie into my top ten favorites, but it wasn't until I was 40 that I heard the Carpenters song - Bless the Beasts and the Children on the radio, the title to this movie, and a flood of memories came back.  I had to have this movie in my collection

I found this movie on Ebay one day and ended up spending a lot of money for it because I just had to have it, but I wish I would have come to Amazon.com first to get a better deal.

517499,5,6302765188,"""Bless the Beasts and Children"" remains among my

favorite books and movies.

Both are extraordinary evocation of childhood, done in

reverie, poetry, that manage to appeal to all generations,

for the wind does still blow in all places, and the yearning

to be accepted for what one is, to say this is what I

believe, can never die, not until the human spirit itself is

extinguished. They haunt. Who has not had memories of

wanting to free their own symbolic helpless beast,? who,

in the trying, has not or will not pay the terrible price,?

though hopefully not so terrible as that paid by

Cotton--the buffalo are the clouds in autumn gray, always.

""Lost/stumbling blind/after a dream I just can't find...""

from the film can still make me weep, as does the whole

soundtrack, and glad to be able to.

Bless Glendon Swarthout forever for his unique bold

novel, and Miles, who was there to tell him. Bless Stanley

Kramer for making such a superb movie of it, and that

splendid cast, the lovely music, the sorrowful theme

performed so lovingly, so forlornly, by the Carpenters.

One of my cats was named Lally 2 after the character in

""Bless the Beasts.."". My Lally had dreams also. I'd like to

think he has now found them come true.

Like the boys in the film and novel, he was gentle, and he

was sensitive, and he stayed with me all day long when I

was so ill.  All those months. Those wise large brown

eyes, that seemed so concerned, so warm, and the paw he

always kept on my wrist as we lay in bed most of the day,

like he wanted to be sure he knew I knew he was there.

How like the movie and novel he was.

It was summer when I read the heartbreaking novel.

November when I saw the sometimes sad beyond bearable

film. It has helped make always November a very sweet

month, and summer finer, because of them. If you are a

parent, reading this, see the movie, read the book, then

consider carefully and then pray that your children do or

do not become Bedwetters at the Box Canyon Camp for

Boys--""send us a boy--we'll send you a cowboy"" becomes

in the misfits world, ""Send us a sad child; we will

accidentally send you a human being of worth and

strength and precision of sight."" The cost, though, as one

critic wrote, the terrible cost involved.

There are some movies that become a pattern of memory,

as there are some books. And if one has the hope of

believing in something no one else sees as worthwhile, and

if one can pass by the portals of fools successfully, you

can follow, and your dream may blow up in your face and

it may end in such a sad lesson, but to be pushed in a mud

puddle by bullies, in only your underwear, to be laughed

at, and called names, and to have a boy named Cotton

come along and talk with you, and make you feel like

somebody,  and start you on a heroic adventure, then

sometimes the terrible wracking cost is worth it. Maybe.

Why the movie did not do well at the box office is beyond

me. It is prescient right to this second and always will be.

Stanley Kramer was known for making epics like

""Judgment at Nuremberg,"" another fine film. But this

""little movie"" is an epic of the heart. It maintains

Swarthout's free form dream like sometimes caustic

character studies. It shows how parents caught in booze

and fights and delusion and divorce, can destroy their

children. The opening of the film shows this so

frighteningly, so chillingly. And then shows the specificity

of each child's nightmare. That turns real.

Though ""Lost,"" the most haunting song in the film, has

been for some years now the theme song of the soap,

which is, I believe, ""The Young and The Restless,"" it

deserves hearing as it should be heard with those aching

lyrics, in this movie.

It is about the world children and animals secretly see. It

is about the world they see too well, and turn their backs

on. It is about crying too often, feeling too much, and

being too scared, or too weak, or too thin, or too fat, or

too sissy. It is about the depth of deftness and conscience,

and how sometimes to free buffalo from monstrous

deaths, is to free something so intangible you never can

quite pin it down, which is as it should be, and to try. And

God forever bless the beasts and children, please ""keep

them safe,"" please ""keep them warm."" They are the most

deserving of all.  And the most in need.

And also, keep in your prayers, please, Glendon

Swarthout (who wrote books, this one especially, as

lovely as his name) and the fine film makers who put

everything they had in this film. It is unique, unwavering,

courageous, and a little plea of sanity and hope to all of us

Bedwetters out here.",1098748800,25,4672,4.413223140495868
