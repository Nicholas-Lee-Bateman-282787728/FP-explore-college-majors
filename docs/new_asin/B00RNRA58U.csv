6934108,5,B00RNRA58U,This is one of the best series on the market. It will help you with a deep understanding of the spider guard,1421193600,,108,3.9545454545454546
6934109,5,B00RNRA58U,"I am a blue belt BJJ practitioner looking to add some things to my gi game.  I've been following Stephan's blog, podcasts, and youtube channel for some time.  From those I've learned that Stephan (a black belt in BJJ) is an intelligent, friendly, and entertaining teacher of the martial arts.  I trust Stephan to provide thought-provoking analysis and instruction, and always do it with a smile on his face.

Over the years Stephan has developed a wealth of online instructional materials.  In my opinion, he has established himself as one of the best online resources for someone looking to learn BJJ.  If you want to try before you buy, just go to his website or his youtube channel (both called ""grapplearts"") and view hundreds (maybe thousands) of free articles and videos.

So with all of this free instruction available online, why buy a DVD set?  I bought this set for a few reasons, and I couldn't be happier with it.

First, what you get online (from Stephan or anywhere else) are often ""snippets"" or ""fragments"".  An instructor will teach you one move, one counter, one drill, etc.  It's not systematic.  (In fact, I'd argue this is also primarily what you get from in-class personal instruction!)  But as anyone at the blue belt level and up knows, to be an effective BJJ player you need to have a system or a strategy.  So having a 5-volume series of DVD lessons, all with a very carefully-planned order and structure, provides you with that kind of framework.  To see what I mean, check out the ""mind map for Spider Guard"", which is a free resource that Stephan and Elliott have provided online.  It is a game plan -- that's what you need to succeed in BJJ, and that's what this instructional set aims to provide.

Second, I'd already seen some of Stephan's videos that he's made in collaboration with Elliott Bayev (you can too, so once again, try before you buy) and I can tell you that Elliott (another BJJ black belt with an impressive resume of big tournament successes) is a fantastic teacher.  Not every great practitioner is a great teacher, but Elliott is both.  He's analytical and methodical.  He explains things with such simplicity and precision that it sounds like he did twenty takes to get it to come out just right (though I suspect they only did one or two takes).  I'm a teacher by profession, and I can tell you that Elliott is a natural-born teacher that knows how to break something down to its essential underpinnings.  And pair that with Stephan, who -- as always -- provides an excellent perspective as the grappling partner, pointing out things that he felt or noticed about a particular move that made it effective from his point of view.

And third, in addition to being a great teacher and explainer of the art, Elliott is (as I mentioned) also a successful BJJ competitor.  This means that you are learning techniques that have worked against some of the highest-level competitors in the sport.  So you're not just learning theory here; you are learning tried-and-true effective techniques.

This is a great team-up of instructors.  I've been very happy with this DVD set.  And at the Amazon price it's a great deal.  Just be aware that -- as the DVD title explicitly states! -- this is a spider guard instructional, meaning it's really intended primarily for gi (and sport jiu-jitsu) players.  But don't take my word for it... go online, find grapplearts, and view a sample for yourself before deciding to buy.  And if you do decide to invest in this set, I trust you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1421193600,7,3547,4.71869918699187

This is the essence of modern BJJ.

8695604,5,B00RNRA58U,"This review is for disk one of the Spider Guard Master Class by Elliott Bayev and Stephan Kesting, as that is all I have watched thus far.  In a word, phenomenal!  In just the first disk, I have learned so much, and will take the next couple of months drilling the moves and positions.

The first disk opens with very general grips, movements, drills, etc.  Then it jumps into the Triangle attack from Spider; and then Elliot proceeds to go into variation after variation of the Triangle, in great depth.  Again, showing counters to the triangle, and counters to the counters.  Even if you are not interested in the spider guard just the Triangle Submission Chain is amazing.

Then, the last section of disk one covers the Omoplata Submission Chain, and everything I wrote above regarding the Triangle Submission Chain applies to the Omoplata Submission Chain... exceptional!

After spending some time working on disk one, I will watch disk two, and further this review.

Pros:  Not only do they show attacks, but they show counters, and counters to counters.  Incredibly in depth.
Cons:  Started feeling bad for Stephan watching him cringe, and tap over and over and over.",1421798400,4,1173,4.8686868686868685
