8316727,5,B001KZVQ7U,"My brother in law has this car so this was a no-brainer for a gift for Christmas.  It arrived nice and quick and is exactly as described, and wrapped in plastic.  He really liked it and for the very low price, I find this to be an excellent value.  If you can get anything like this for under $10, I think it is a good value for a Mustang fan.",1293840000,,343,3.8714285714285714
