8329649,5,B001O4X9O0,"I've never done a review for anything before but I saw that no one had done a review of this movie yet and just couldn't stand the thought of it being passed up by someone who wasn't sure if it was worth the purchase.

First, I'd like to say that it's not the best action I've ever seen. I've been doing martial arts since I was 8 and have seen movies with much more crisp movement ect...
Second, It's not the funniest movie I've ever seen.

However, the action is really good;  The comedy is funny and cute and I really like Shin Min-Ah. She has a natural quality to her acting that really made this movie have a great vibe to it.

I wholeheartedly recommend this movie to anyone who is looking for a good fun movie to enjoy.  It reminded me of a lower budget (anything would be lower budget) version of Sherlock Holmes. It didn't have the best of anything but together it stood out for me as one of the best foreign movies I've seen in a long time.

Hope this helped.",1287532800,2,969,4.182795698924731
