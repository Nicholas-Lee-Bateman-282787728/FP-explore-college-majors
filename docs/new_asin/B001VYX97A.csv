8346794,2,B001VYX97A,"I have to say that personally, I was disappointed with this video. This covered the VERY basics - as in you have never done any martial training or need a self-defense class. For what is on this rather short video, I also think it is rather overpriced. However, that aside, each technique was shown multiple times, often from differing sides/angles. If you are looking for a video teaching techniques related to Panantukan or more advanced mano-mano, sadly this video is not going to fit the bill.",1274227200,,497,4.790697674418604
