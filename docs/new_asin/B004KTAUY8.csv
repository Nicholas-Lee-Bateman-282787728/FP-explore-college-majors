4398291,4,B004KTAUY8,It was real funny though I don't recommend it to younger veiwers. Some mature content which would be inappropriate to younger viewers.,1360627200,,134,5.136363636363637
4398292,5,B004KTAUY8,"Absolutely hilarious! I always wanted to see this movie because of the title alone, and I'm glad I bought this! MST 3K is still one of my favorite shows of all time, HANDS DOWN!

Best parts:

1. The skatting/singer lady. (""A blinga blagga bloo!"")
2. Madam Estrella's accent. (""You dirty, feelthy peeg!"")
3. ""Madison.""

Definitely a must-have for fans!",1360627200,,351,4.915254237288136
4398293,5,B004KTAUY8,"As usual, the riffing is excellent, so let's move on to the experiment.

First up, this isn't so much a zombie movie as it is a hypnotically mind-controlled murderer movie.  It has no budget, not much of a script, no real continuity, and only one actual actor--who happens to have a comically severe accent.  The main character is played by the director and is, in modern parlance, a douchebag--so when things happen to him, he pretty much has it coming.

The cinematography is actually surprisingly good for a no-budget film.  According to Wikipedia, three of the guys involved in it went on to better things; one won an Oscar of all things for /Close Encounters of the Third Kind/.",1360454400,3,683,4.705882352941177
4398294,5,B004KTAUY8,"I missed out getting this movie when it was offered in the MST3K vol 9 set but so happy to see it re-released as a single.  I totally agree that this was one of MST3K's funniest but this one is also near and dear to me because I actually remember seeing this at the ""drive-in movies"" as a kid.  And it was just as trippy for me back then as it is now.
 Definitely worth it.",1349654400,3,373,3.8815789473684212
4398295,5,B004KTAUY8,"Didn't take long before I started laughing until tears welled up and this continued throughout the film. Not since ""The Brain That Wouldn't Die"" has there been a more satisfying MST3K episode. From ""Your hair won't clear the door!"" to a redux of ""The Little Drummer Boy"" to ""I see a big house and *spit* there's a swimming pool!""",1343606400,3,329,4.593220338983051
4398296,5,B004KTAUY8,"Oh, where to even begin praising MST3K's deliriously funny treatment of ""Incredibly Strange Creatures""? This was one of my very favorite episodes from Season 8, and I'm glad it's out on DVD. Let's start with their riffing during the movie's many, many musical numbers. MiSTies will probably remember ""Shick Out of Shape,"" but there's oh so much more. I think my favorite scene in the entire episode is the one in which the ultra-white, ultra-bland bland folk singer comes out and starts strumming this very monotonous and tame folk song called ""How Do I Stand With Your Heart?"" and Mike and the 'bots sing lyrics to other songs over him, like: ""Livin' on reds, vitamin C, and cocaine!"" and ""My anaconda don't want none unless you got buns, hon."" But all  songs are great, as are the dance numbers. (""They're like the Blue Angels of dance!"") And then there's the ""Open Wagon, Roll On!"" country song which Mike claims was digitally recorded then erased then re-recorded on a dictophone.

Other great things in this episode:
* ""It wouldn't be Jerry!"" ""And that's a good thing?""
* ORTEGA! - Not just his appearances in the movie, but on the bridge of the SOL, too, when Crow has hired him to cater the movie break despite Mike's objections. (""He's ashing in the quail eggs!"")
* ""...And he misses the ocean!""
* The WALK-A-TON skit (""Hi, everyone! Let's pitch in 'n' get crackin'...."" - still a favorite of mine!)
* ""What do you think we came here for, to eat?"" - All the riffing about Atlas King's character.
* ""Madison!"" - the whole portrayal of wimpy Madison as a would-be action hero
* ""You know what I'm lookin' at? That EXIT sign!""
* ""She saves her washerwoman pay to go to strip shows.""

I could go on and on quoting lines from this episode. I haven't even gotten to the miserably lame emcee at the Hungry Mouth (""I've been asked to explain the Iron and Steel joke"") or the carny who can wash dishes with his hat. If you think this is a mediocre or just-okay episode, I'd all but beg you to back and give it another look. You're missing out on something really funny.",1315612800,6,2068,4.538873994638069
4398297,5,B004KTAUY8,"....the movie that dares to show every pore!
One of my favorites from these guys, hilarious!",1410393600,,92,4.8125
4398298,5,B004KTAUY8,"The dance numbers alone make this one of the best of the series, inducing Mike to say :""Andrea Dworkin choreagraphed this number...""",1407801600,,132,5.045454545454546
4398299,5,B004KTAUY8,It is rare when you can find a movie this bad and laugh till you cry. Ray Dennis Steckler makes Ed Wood look like John Ford. The MSTK crew were on fire with this one. Highly enjoyable and worth buying. I saw this on Amazon prime and it brought back some great memories of watching mstk.,1392508800,,286,4.125
4398300,5,B004KTAUY8,Extremely good MST3K entry.  The film itself is one of those bad it's bad stinkers.  That's why it responds so well to the MST3K treatment.  I won't go in too deeply on how good it is.  I just want to say to MST3K fans who haven't seen or don't have this one:  GET IT.  Highly recommended.,1391644800,2,289,4.071428571428571

4398302,5,B004KTAUY8,"If you like Zombie movies...this is not really about zombies at all...it is a really crummy film, which makes it great material for the commentary of the Satellite of Love crew. My whole family laughed through the whole thing.",1376092800,,226,4.82051282051282
4398303,5,B004KTAUY8,"One of the  best MST3K of the series.
The title alone raises the riffing of the cast  to an even higher level of excellence.",1368230400,,124,4.125
4398304,4,B004KTAUY8,"I honestly haven't watched this one. I think I clicked on it by mistake and Amazon wanted me to rate it. However, MST3K is totally awesome. If you haven't watched these movies/shows, you're missing out. It's a unique genre with great humor and timing.",1368230400,,251,4.7272727272727275
4398305,4,B004KTAUY8,"This movie had dancers(?) and performers(?) listed in the credits. I would not wish to be associated in any way with this so-called movie. But Mike, Servo, and Crow were well worth watching.",1367884800,,190,4.787878787878788
4398306,5,B004KTAUY8,"This movie is absolutely NOTHING short of EXACTLY what MST3K is all about. I don't think I have ever laughed so hard in my entire life. I remember seeing this episode when it originally aired. My friend and I watched it, recited, and still quote it to this day. It's a REALLY slow movie, but the jokes never stop. They take one completely unwatchable pile of filth, and make it a movie that makes the Hangover look like Schindler's List. Watch. Laugh. Watch again.",1364947200,,464,4.535714285714286

8433406,5,B004KTAUY8,Seen this many times on Netflix (before they dropped it). Then bought the DVD. Very funny episode.,1450137600,,98,4.823529411764706
8433407,5,B004KTAUY8,"Although the word ""indescribable"" was made for movies like this one, let me try: a rat-faced git is seduced and hypnotized into becoming a serial killer by an evil stripper and her still more evil, fortune-telling sister. That's only an excuse, of course, for a string of embarrassing song-and-dance numbers, and for the vertigo-inducing experiments of then-novice cinematographers Vilmos Zigmund, Laszlo Kovacs, and Joseph Mascelli.

Is this enough to explain why Mike, Kevin, and Bill rip into this movie with such gusto? Of course there's the hopelessly bad acting, the abominable sound recording, and at least one gender-indeterminate dancer to shake one's head at, but the movie doesn't come so much from a low-budget, fly-by-night film operation as from a parallel universe. There are no human beings in this film, only grotesque, live-action cartoon characters. The movie is a bloody traffic accident you simply can't look away from.",1440115200,2,940,5.351351351351352
