8605899,5,B00EJ4OX1U,Bought this for my step mom because she loved it!!,1484870400,,50,4.1
8605900,5,B00EJ4OX1U,"One of the most interesting television series filmed in NYC ever, created by Sidney Lumet of 'Dog Day Afternoon' fame, it stars Alan Arkin along with a handful of other terrific character actors. There were only two seasons...1999-2001, I think. Am not sure why it ended, but am pretty sure it was cancelled before Sept. 2001 not after. The two night court judges, the prosecutor, the Legal Aid criminal defense lawyers, the NYC people's stories -- justice served or not -- all feel so real. I was very happy to see this again and only wish there were English captions for the somewhat hearing impaired.",1470960000,,603,4.752380952380952
8605901,5,B00EJ4OX1U,"Possibly the best ""court room"" drama series ever made. I just love it.",1414454400,,70,4.461538461538462
8605902,5,B00EJ4OX1U,"We had watched every single episode of this series on t.v. and *loved* it; the stories were quite believable, plus the actors did a terrific job.  We'd tried to find DVDs for many years and *finally* managed to do so.  Watching the series after all these years was like seeing old friends again.",1391126400,3,295,4.547169811320755
