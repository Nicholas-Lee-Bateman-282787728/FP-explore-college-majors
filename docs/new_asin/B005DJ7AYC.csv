4659997,5,B005DJ7AYC,"While one can wonder about some of the lacunae and strange goings on (i.e. going through airport security with 60,000 pounds in a plastic bag), this film gets a 5-star rating because of the moral concerns it raises. Yes, we all now know about rendition, but that still does not affect the morality of the action or how it is covered up by those in high places. Of course we know politicians lie and can be bought with better positions, but how those lies reflect on the integrity of individuals is a valid undertaking for a television program. This type of program brings memories of the old  George Smiley series with the moral ambiguities it raised. Like others, I would like to see the complete 2-hour program. Perhaps all would cohere then. I would also hope to see the series have more episodes. Television cannot have too many thought-provoking programs like this one.",1320624000,4,874,4.712418300653595
4659998,4,B005DJ7AYC,"I love anything with Bill Nighy in the cast. Suave and sophisticated, he is the master of the pithy understatement. In ""Page Eight"" he plays a jaded MI5 Officer, who is caught up in secret political skulduggery that could bring down the government, headed by Ralph Fiennes as the Prime Minister, who, a la Tony Blair, has been too pal-sy with his American Cousins in the 'war' on terror. Coincidentally, Nighy also becomes involved in a political coverup of a war-crime, which has hit the Syrian family of his beautiful neighbour, convincingly portrayed by Rachel Weisz.

The cast, which is top drawer, includes Michael Gambon, who used to be Nighy's tutor at Cambridge and subsequently became his boss at MI5; Judy Davis, a rather nasty piece of goods who is his colleague and nemisis at MI5; and a still lovely and charismatic Marthe Keller, cast in the role of an old love of Nighy and possibly a professional contact, who is a source of ready cash.

Although I was totally absorbed in the story, which moves at a fast pace, the plot contained some gaps, which makes me wonder whether we on this side of the Pond have been treated to yet another truncated version to fit into the Masterpiece time slot. Furthermore, there were maddening lapses in continuity. For instance, Nighy sensibly locks a plastic shopping bag containing 60,000 (the bills with Queen Elizabeth's face plainly showing through the plastic), and then in the next scene, he pulls his car up to the shoulder of the road in the middle of nowhere, opens up the trunk of the car--leaving it wide open--retrieves a tuxedo, and walks off toward the bushes--minus the sack of money--apparently to change his clothes, because in the very next scene, it is night and he turns up at his old college dressed for a dinner in honour of the Prime Minister. In still another scene, we discover Nighy standing at a hotel reception desk; he is deep in conversation with Ms Weisz, and the plastic sack of money is sitting open on the counter (the Queen's face still visible through the plastic), unattended. By the time he reaches the airport in the final scene, plastic sack of money in hand, I kept wondering how he was going to get it through security (which is fierce at English airports!). The point is that the director seems to have forgotten that the plastic sack contained a fortune in pound notes; nor did it occur to him that, as far as the collective memory of the audience is concerned, the prop might consequently become a maddening distraction from the plot.

The stellar cast kept the film on track, but I do think that a strong dose of continuity control ought to have been exercised in the editing of this otherwise riveting film.",1320624000,32,2702,4.69620253164557

4660000,5,B005DJ7AYC,"David Hare both wrote and directed this stylish, intensely intelligent suspense film (his other films include work on The Hours, The Reader, Damage, Plenty, etc).  Few films have been made that depend on smart dialogue and intense acting instead of explosions, car chases, and other improbable acts of danger to make their point.  Aided by a top-notch British cast, Hare has created a thinking person's drama and it is refreshingly poignant.

A contemporary spy film created for BBC, the action is set in both London and Cambridge.  Johnny Worricker (Bill Nighy in one of his best roles to date) is an experienced MI5 officer whose boss and best friend Benedict Baron (Michael Gambon) dies of a myocardial infarction: he leaves a secret file for his friend. Both men have been married to the same woman (Alice Krige) and Worricker has a grown child from his marriage, an artist Julianne  Felicity Jones) who has never quite forgiven her father for leaving her mother for another woman. The file is so important that it is under surveillance by the British Intelligence (Judy Davis et al) and the Prime Minister's office (Ralph Fiennes).  Worricker lives in a flat opposite a beautiful but aloof girl Nancy Pierpan (Rachel Weisz) whose brother has been murdered in the Middle East.  It is the silence about Nancy's brother's death that is at the core of the file Worricker holds and with some help from Nancy he traces the truth to the point of being threatened by MI5 to be fired.  The film addresses contemporary intelligence issues and techniques and the associated moral dilemmas we face today.  To reveal more would be to rob the viewer of the complexity of the story.

The strong supporting cast includes Marthe Kellar in a small but pivotal role, along with Tom Hughes, Kate Burdette, Ewen Bremmer and others.  This is a tense drama, exceptionally well written and acted and a welcome change from the current barrage of action flicks.  Grady Harp, November 11",1320105600,69,1965,4.885542168674699
4660001,5,B005DJ7AYC,"PBS started a new series titled ""Masterpiece Contemporary"" to present films that take place in today's modern world (as compared to the Victorian era of most Masterpiece Theater program). This is one of those new shows. Why it didn't show up in their ""Mastery"" series is a mystery to me. Despite what a previous reviewer said there is a ""mystery"" here that is not revealed until near the end. But, I'm glad they did at least bring it to US audiences.

The film - with a script by David Hare (his first in 20 years) - wonderful and the cast is superb with Michael Gambon, Rachel Weisz, Judy Davis and Bill Nighy (in the main role) as an M5 Investigator (The UK's ""intelligence unit).

I won't give the plot because it would spoil it. And I'll also suggest that  you pass on the review titled ""I'd Like Some Jazz "" which really gives a lot of it away. Even the short description on the back of the DVD divulges info it's more interesting to discover as you watch the film.

This 105 minute film (yes it is 105 minutes on this DVD.. someone asked) is the ""Original UK Version"" so there is the F-Word - that didn't appear when it aired on PBS.

I watched this DVD knowing nothing about the film or plot and thoroughly enjoyed it. It's a modern ""spy/ political"" film as up to dates as today's headlines.

4660002,5,B005DJ7AYC,"Page Eight is a British Spy novel told from a British point of view.  The point of view underlying the drama is that the UK Prime Minister is too close to the USA (e.g., Tony Blair).  I personally am not put off by that view which is often expressed in UK Drama (e.g., The Last Enemy), but you should be aware of the underpinnings of the video before you watch it.

The drama is riveting, and the cast is excellent.  I am not a big Bill Nighy fan, but everyone else is excellent.  I started watching the video at 1AM, and I could not stop watching it.  I found the ending realistic and believable, despite the fact that I wished for something more satisfying from our hero's point of view.  The dialogue is great.  It is witty, and it is what an American Anglophile expects the British ruling class to sound like.

There is a rumor that writer/director David Hare has told some associates that if Page 8 works, he might bring Bill Nighy's character Johnny Worricker back, as part of a trilogy of TV films.  I would love to see more (even with Bill Nighy).

PBS Masterpiece will air the drama next week, and has allowed two hours for the broadcast.  The drama itself is only one hour and thirty-eight minutes.  So, I am hopeful that PBS will broadcast the entire drama.

The only thing wrong with the DVD is the price of $23.49.  This is a made for TV movie of normal TV movie length.  That price is not warranted. I will wait until the price drops before I buy the DVD.",1320019200,47,1469,4.306569343065694
4660003,4,B005DJ7AYC,"This BBC made for TV movie opens up with many loose ends. Bill Nighly stars as Johnny Worricker, an MI5 agent. His neighbor, Nancy Pierpan (Rachel Weisz) suddenly takes an interest in him.  Sitting in her flat is Ralph Wilson (Tom Hughes) who must now leave because Bill showed up.

At work, Bill's boss (Michael Gambon) shows him a Top Secret document. Bill is most interested in ""Page Eight."" There is a concern for future terrorist attacks. Meanwhile Bill's daughter (Felicity Jones) is a famous artist who paints morbid pictures of despair. At a showing of her paintings, Ralph Wilson happens to be there too. Bill doesn't like these coincidences in his life.

***Midpoint plot spoiler***  Page 8 of the document is rather boring by 2010 standards. It seems Americans have secret interrogation sites across the world where they torture prisoners  AND the Prime Minister knows about it. Ralph Fiennes (Lord Voldemort) is the Prime Minister of England. The political and legal ramifications are discussed, but there appears to be no moral outrage. More coincidental things happen in the film to make you go hmm, but it is not really a mystery as there is no puzzle, or is there?. All we have is Johnny Worricker's gut feeling something isn't right.

Good acting. Interesting plot twists. A movie which asks moral questions for our modern society.

The movie initially uses some good old fashion gumshoe jazz as a way to connect us to simpler times. But it's the 21st century now...

4660122,5,B005DJ7AYC,"If you like well written, complex mystery scripts executed by a superb actors then you will love this film.  The aftermath of 9/11 had a myriad of impacts upon the Western democracies.  One of the larger problems was how to we protect ourselves from our enemies who operate in the shadows while at the same time protecting our rights?  This issue had important social, economic, political and (indeed) intelligence implications that didn't - and still don't - fit well together.  At the end of the day it all comes down to whom do you trust?  Not an easy question to answer as this movie demonstrates.

If you're looking for a mindless action file - this isn't it.  But if you're looking for a thoughtful, well plotted story with actors capable of expressing complex emotions with a raised eyebrow or a turn of the head then this for you.

4660131,5,B005DJ7AYC,"This is a fantastic British spy thriller charmed by the great and I think somewhat unknown bill nighy. I like this movie because the British have manners.  They have manners that America seriously lacks, that are so well worth watching in this movie. It's an intellectual spy thriller with no car crashes, explosions, killings or other mayhem. In the modern era those things will go by the wayside in favor of electronic spying, and people have to use their brains to solve things rather than kill each other. Bill nighy is joined by the shockingly white skinned Rachel Weisz. This girl hasn't seen the sun in 50 years. She plays the gal that gets him into all the trouble to begin with. It's a great cast of characters punctuated by all the typical dreary British weather, dark alleys and cloak and dagger stuff we love so much. This movie has it all. Bill nighy was born to play this role, and I watch this movie a few times a year. My only gripe was that I had no idea there were two other movies in the series, I found out totally by accident. And then waited months for kindle to come out with it at an affordable price. The second one of the series set in the triopics has none of the flavor and atmosphere that the first and third movies in the series have. Page eight is the best of the three. You can't lose, this is a great movie. Buy it, watch it again and again. You can never get tired of bill nighy's character. He's just too fascinating.",1431648000,,1452,4.357933579335794

4660140,3,B005DJ7AYC,"This is a highly watchable film, but it does have some issues, mostly in that it feels forced on many levels:

(1) Although the product description does not state it, and there is no indication on the DVD case, this is actually the first movie in a trilogy. You can still watch it standalone, but the the ending will be a little dissatisfying in terms of it really being more of a lead to the next installment.  But even though it is the first installment, I felt like it was missing something.  There was not enough character backstory or character development for my liking. If anything, this felt like it should have been a second installment, after more of a baseline had been laid.  The characters rush into actions, and especially relationships, in a way that makes little sense and feels very, very forced. You're exposed to multiple characters in a shotgun style that feels more like speed dating. Some people feel British shows are too slowly paced, but that is not the case here and it suffers for it. Little of the plot progression feels justified.

(2) This is considered part of Masterpiece CONTEMPORARY. Maybe that is why the pace was forced, rather than being slowplayed such as in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tinker-Tailor-Soldier-Spy-A-George-Smiley-Novel/dp/014312093X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy: A George Smiley Novel</a>. This may be a conscious marketing decision to try to appeal to younger folks and be ""edgy"". But I felt it was trying too hard to feel contemporary, going out of its way right off the bat to include edgy contemporary art, a disdain for marriage, muslim coworkers in headscarves, etc., but in a way that felt very politically correct and again, forced. These are elements that could have worked, but it felt like they were included just as ""check-boxes"":  if we are doing something contemporary, it MUST include certain things, and instead of an interesting character that just happens to be gay it felt more like ""here is a gay character, check"". None of these ""contemporary"" elements were integral or interesting.

To its credit and partially saving it, it is very well cast, the acting is good, and it has an interesting story line. But it ultimately does not stand up to what it is trying to be, a more updated Tinker Tailor type story. Could have been much better, and in some cases a waste of talent from some fine actors who seemed reduced to cameos. 3 1/2 stars.",1425081600,7,2483,5.02676399026764

Supporting performances in this and two later episodes by Helena Bonham Carter, Ewen Bremner, Ralph Fiennes, Rachel Weisz, Winona Ryder, Christopher Walken, Micvael Gambon, Judy Davis and numerous others are uniformly superb, with most of them frequently playing against type in a manner they clearly found liberating.

It does have a cynical view (one which I think is entirely realistic) about where all the money for the War on Terror is going and what kind of people are getting it.  The biggest issue my wife and I, especially my wife, had with the program is its reliance on Bill Nighy's appeal to a seemingly endless stream of much younger women.

4660241,4,B005DJ7AYC,"What's not to like?  Bill Nighy and Michael Gambon in full mellifluous flower as two old college (Cambridge) friends in the top echelons at MI5; Rachel Weisz in full intense mode as an activist whose brother's death at the hands of Israeli forces has been covered up; Judy Davis as an MI5 officer who seems to be willing to mix intelligence gathering with the fraught politics of the British war on terror.  The Prime Minister is Ralph Fiennes, as a character much less sympathetic than the one he played opposite Weisz in ""The Constant Gardener.""  That's a strong cast, and they do justice to a tightly written script by David Hare, who pays his audience the compliment of not needing to have everything spelled out, with the effect that, although the movie is often conversational, a lot of stuff is crammed into its 107 minutes with no loss of clarity.

At heart, this is a story of office intrigue, even if the offices are those of the British Security Service.  Without giving anything away that matters, I think I can say that in this version the old Cambridge guys -- unlike the ""Cambridge Spies"" of the 1940's and 1950's -- are on the side of the angels, but times are changing, and public relations are becoming more important than truth telling for the politicians who see the Secret Service as serving them, rather than their country.  So there's an attractive old-fashioned patriotic element in the story, and the threat of the loss of patriotism as a motive -- especially as voiced by Gambon and Nighy -- gives an elegiac, almost nostalgic cast to the film.  It catches some of the tone of the Le Carre novels with George Smiley, and it too asks the question: can we trust the Americans???  Are the old guys still up to the task in the age of cellphones and the internet?  See it and find out.  It's a highly enjoyable movie of a kind that since the filming of the Le Carre books for TV has become comfortably familiar.",1414800000,,1932,4.573913043478261

Rachel Weisz is terrific as Johnny's neighbor, as is Michael Gambon as Director General on MI5. I have watched all episodes of the show ""MI-5,"" and I love them; however, these lot in ""Page Eight"" are quite as good. (Of course, Ralph Fiennes is in ""Page Eight,"" though his role as  Prime Minister is less prominent, and his performance is what British writer and director David Hare intended: supportive.)
I must now locate the rest of ""The Worricker Trilogy"": ""Turks & Caicos"" and ""Salting the Battlefield,"" said to have been broadcast on BBC Two in March 2014. Bill Nighy is different in his approach to the role from the MI-5 guys (Harry, Lucas, etc.); we need that from him. Who is the ""roundest"" character? You tell me.",1412553600,,859,4.651315789473684

Yes there's a secretary inside the MI 6 building wearing a hijab; some reviewers use this to suggest pandering to the Muslim community by the BBC, but in the movie Zero Dark Thirty (based on a true story) we're led into a senior CIA director's office as he's finishing his prayers on a prayer rug (Muslim prayer) without having to read reviewers disbelieving comments about ""left wing"" using the movie for their biased pro Muslim message.

4660361,4,B005DJ7AYC,"-Minor Spoilers-

Bill Nighy plays Johnny Worricker, a British spy in MI5 with a high level clearance.  His boss, Bernard played by Michael Gambon has just discovered there is a mole in the British equivalent of Homeland Security.  Bernard confronts several peers with detailed report that creates great tension and the potential of exposing many in the security business with egg on their face and a huge scandal if the public is alerted.  Johnny is suspected by his peers as being in the know and thus he is threatened to reveal the source of the information, however, he hasn't been updated.  Hours later, his boss is dead taking the identity of the source with him.  Johnny must discover the source before his peers destroy his career and him.

High drama and male/female tension ensue (unfortunately, Weisz and Nighy just didn't seem to have any chemistry on screen).  Additionally, it is obvious early on that Rachel Weisz will play his love interest and their need for mutual aid verges on that ""yeah right"" attitude however, the plot moves quickly and the actors are successful in creating the necessary tension to keep you watching until the end.  While the story was typical spy vs spy fair, the cast makes this a solid 3 1/2 stars and without the stellar cast, some of whom acted superbly particularly several of the supporting cast made what was a passable storyline, worthwhile entertainment, especially if you enjoy fast paced thrillers.",1408579200,,1451,4.913934426229508

4660396,4,B005DJ7AYC,"Acclaimed British actor Nighy stars as an M16 agent, Worricker, years of service under his belt in the pursuit of facts for the British government.  Looking past or at least very near retirement, his worn, thin and wrinkled face, on a tall willowy body, Worricker finds himself in a moral dilemma about how much his government knew about the torture sites for interrogation of British (muslim) subjects.  All of this has been covered up, in collusion with the USA and Israel, but he finds out that Prime Minister did know.  Ralph Fiennes plays the then-Tony Blair, and the entire story is to indict the Blair government for siding with Israel and not the other Middle East states, to stay on the good side of the White House.

Well, what is new?  USA and UK have been together through thick and thin; we came to their aid with Lend-Lease under FDR and found ourselves fighting Germany, when most Americans were against involvement in any more European wars.

In any case, the film is entertaining in a slow-moving spy-story way.  Aside from our very dessicated main hero Worricker, we have his rebellious, angry, despairing daughter who appears to be a successful artiste at a young age.  She is angry at her father, since her mother was abandoned by him when she was pregnant.  She, too, is now pregnant and abandoned.  This brings the ex-wife into the story since something must be done about his lone offspring's waywardness and careless mistake.

Meanwhile, in his fancy flat, he discovers a beautiful neighbor across the landing, a Syrian woman asking for help with a difficult boyfriend.  Naturally she is not there by coincidence.  Her brother had been killed by Israelis while waving a white flag, and she knew that he worked in secret services.  Her goal is to seduce him and get him to help in the fight to get justice against Israel.

Does she find his reticence and advanced age repulsive?  If so, she smiles and hides it, and he in his loneliness is falling for it.  Her father is an important man; Worricker is getting set up.

While Worricker walks around in his aging swaying thinness in a long dark coat through the streets of London, we are presumably to admire his toughness, his grim clenched mouth and worn, weary features, as he resolves to fight against his own government.  Having no attachments, he knows his career will end (possibly high time?), but he can sell some paintings and escape abroad, cash in hand.

I would recommend this film for those who like:

1.  To fantasize being an old guy still attracting women 40 years younger or more, with little more than a grimace-smile;
2.  Those who like anti-Israeli and anti-American propaganda;
3.  To fantasize being the female who can manipulate with her beauty the heartstrings of a callous old spy who lives alone, presumably by choice, since all the women seem to fall for him.  His middle-aged lover doesn't interest him much.

4.  To consider how the computers of today find out and ferret out everything, as we now know with NSA's exposure by Snowden.
5.  How absolutely hopeless the ""war on terrorism"" really is, since the governments are all involved with it, too.

Above all, I see this as a film for male viewers who are getting on in years and wistfully hope for a little bit of young flesh, or even some recognition like a smile.

Fine acting. Even the females, typecast, do a good job, although their motivations are not clear in the plot.  (I.e. why is the daughter so angry and despairing, careless of birthcontrol and not considering abortion?  Why is the young Syrian across the hall interested in this ancient fellow aside from what he can do for her family?  What is attracting her?)",1402963200,,3680,4.726844583987441

Most interesting is that the US is the subtle antagonist and from there the subject of torture to get information from terrorists becomes the 'big deal' that the MI-5 people want to expose- not because of the torture per se, but that the prime minister of Downing St. knew about the info gathered and did not use it to protect the British people.

Intrigue and underhanded abuse of power by the characters drive this film. As they collide over the ethics of modern day info gathering techniques you realize the game they play is a deadly one.

4660411,5,B005DJ7AYC,"""Page 8"" is one of those movies I become addicted to and want to watch again when the mood strikes me even though it's offered at intervals on ""Masterpiece"".  The story is so cleverly depicted on the screen that there are no times when you feel that it's dragging, every moment is relevant. More importantly, the cast is composed of some of the finest actors available and the slender, cadaverous Bill Nighy, whom I saw here for the first time looks very elegant in his black raincoat in the opening scene and impressed me with his portrayal. I'll not go on and on about the other fine actors but that you'll be depriving yourself if you don't buy the DVD just to enjoy how they do their as-ever excellent work.  Rachel Weisz with her dark beauty holds her own also and not just as a piece of ""eye candy"".  ""Contemporary"" is a good subtitle as after you watch this you'll get a better feeling of the definition of that word.",1400198400,5,924,4.423529411764706

4660414,3,B005DJ7AYC,"Bill Nighy is absolutely superb and the acting level overall is extraordinarily high. The GOOD and why THREE STARS.

Basically, it is a movie based on ""smart"" word play. I know it is British, but at the one hour point I stopped. The film ""Wild Target"" with Bill is still the best film to watch him excel!! Its has the ""smart"" word play, is fun, has a plot that moves faster than a snail too.

This movie's plot line is slow - really, really slow to develop. My deep problems are with the plot line and Nighy's numerous relationships with women (his neighbor, his daughter, his lover, his ex-wife, etc.). The plot line has too many illogical holes (and the film resembles closely one other Nighy movie on world hunger) in its politically illogical allusions (I am trying not to put spoilers in my review). Bill's character is sold as a moral man within a corrupt political framework (pretty standard idea but is actually sophistry in this movie's dialog). Then there are the ""straw men"" to hate and also created as hollow characters. The character development of the British Prime Minister (Fiennes) is missing as is the character development of the Deputy Prime Minister. They are for target practice only, not to be really known. The disingenuous plotting had me wondering why I kept watching for a full hour but then I realized it was Nighy, his work was beyond belief.

Nighy's relationships with the women around him played as disjointed puzzle pieces forced together but not fitting. The movie in fact reminds me of a long running British play - No Sex Please, We Are British! He shows no emotion invariably. His rapid trust in his neighbor (Weisz) is not believable as the depth of his feelings develops almost immediately (hmm...), his difficult relationship with his daughter is a patch job (time after time she is disappointed by his negative/caustic comments yet according to Nighy's character she really cares about his approval. What!) Their interaction plays more like a defiant teenager and a controlling parent, not as two adults. And it continues... Nighy's character does show affection in one line with his lover (better catch it as its short).",1399852800,,2162,4.837837837837838

Bill Nighy is brilliant as Johnny Worricker, the ""against the establishment"" spy who wings it on charm. Rachel Weisz is such an accomplished actress, perfect as his next door neighbor and more! The plot thickens, as they say, but you will want to see all of it.  [Worricker is much more believable than Smiley, though I also love Tinker, Tailor]

The wonderfully understated script and acting presents a story of the tension between politics and intelligence and gives us the unflappable Johnny Worrick, the perfect spy.

4660468,2,B005DJ7AYC,"I was reminded for a few short minutes while watching Page Eight, of why I loved Sandbaggers so much...except in this case, a political agenda, not so subtle hits of Political Correctness and inconsistent writing ruins the show. In fact, it is just the degree of silliness and implausibility that requires so much suspension of disbelief that you can't quite pull it off.

Could Israelis kill someone they didn't like, based on their being involved in an anti-Israeli political movement? Why yes. They could. Could Americans torture enemies of their civilization to gleam information? Why yes. They could. And could certain people know about it and not others? Why yes. They could. And so what?

The truth is that it is not America or Israel that is out to destroy civilization although their methods to save it can be debated and often, strongly disagreed with. And yes, they may even at times be responsible for part of the problems they face. But It is clearly the fascist dictatorships of this world - whether they be in Europe, the Middle East or Asia - that are ""the enemy"".

A film/series such as this always aims their light on the failings of relatively free, relatively honest political sphere of The West - magnifying it's problems while ignoring the horrendous nastiness of what goes on everywhere else around them. How much I would have loved an honest spy story where our hero would have been manipulated by the true villains of this world.

Great Britain is under attack from internal and external threats. And they are not Americans, Israelis or members of Right Wing Conspiracies, nor are they Daleks. They are...Islamo-fascists, Communists, Political Racists and Fascist regimes. A spy ""thriller"" that ignores all that, and makes heroes of villains, villains of heroes, unfortunately falls flat on it's face. There is a reason no one reads Le Carre anymore...because George Smiley doesn't live here these days...and you won't find him on Page Eight either.

Kenneth Clark once said that civilizations fail when they lose confidence, and that is first seen in their art. Well, Britain continues to show how much contempt it has for itself and its glorious, heroic past with this sort of drivel that could have indeed been a masterpiece...I guess we can thankfully turn to China for films about heroes, even if they look a little different on the surface...",1390348800,10,2373,4.93734335839599

These two groups have hated each other since Esau and Jacob, sons of Isaac and Rebekah, GENESIS 26, 37. Esau becomes the patriarch of the 12 Arabic Tribes and Jacob the patriarch  of the 12 Israeli Tribes; since about then, they have been doing atrocities to one another.
The film treats the phenomena of our worldly reality with refinement, I thought, you don't see in it Tom Cruise or Matt Damon slugging out against super naturally dolled martial artists who in the end are no match for our heroes. This film is another message of our worldly reality predicting that dark forces are about to take the planet, with cabals, and turn it into a dystopian pandemonium; by eliminating the Middle-Class and creating a society of masters and servants; Few months ago the three most powerful banks of the world: The Bank of England, The Federal Reserve System and the ECB joined forces which to many is a step closer to the New World Order.
We have seen variations of this reality in different gender of movies such as: Star Wars, Pirates of the Caribbean and The Lord of The Rings, to mention a few. Are these directors and writers trying to tell us something, you think about it, remember it all began with the Templar-they were not all exterminated-and gradualism is the weapon of the megalomaniac.
Bill Nighy and Rachel Weiz put the icing on the cake, two professionals that can carry a script to near perfection-nothing is a 100%.

4660499,1,B005DJ7AYC,"This movie glorifies the decay of Western civilization, particularly British decline.  Johnny Worricker solidly believes in life, the West, and Britain, but is undermined by his family and neighbors and at the end succumbs to this pressure.  His daughter is a poser artist, pretending at despair, which even if it is true is despair of her own making.  Worricker, after his daughter asks him to be honest, tells her this, at which point she becomes upset.  His daughter is also is pregnant, but no boyfriend or husband in site, but Worricker's ex-wife chastises HIM for being judgemental, saying ""It's the twenty-first century.""  Quite sensibly he explodes at such stupidity essentially saying that the current date in no way justifies the moral decay that rots at the heart of Britain.

Also, apparently in the writers minds, the most horrible countries on the world stage are the US and Israel.  Standard anti-American and anti-Israeli propoganda throughout.  Worricker's neighbor is a Syrian activist whose brother was murdered by the Israeli Defense Force while he was waving a white flag because, you know, that's just the type of thing that Iraelis do for fun.

The acting is solid, though.  So if you embrace the modern West's confetti culture of non-judgementalism and the motto ""if it feels good it is good"", along with the knee jerk blame America/Israel first, you're going to love this film.

I thought it was trite.  The obvious moral decay and the failed cultural relativism are lionized and on full display.",1380931200,24,1521,5.04

4660503,5,B005DJ7AYC,"The dialogue of this film is so original I had to get off the treadmill to sit on the sofa and enjoy it. This film is worth watching alone for what is said. But then who says it is also enticing: Michael Gambon as chief of MI5, Bill Nighy as his underling and soon to be rogue agent, Ralph Fiennes as the British Prime Minister, Judy Davis as a scheming colleague and Rachel Weisz as a lovely neighbor whose brother was killed by the Israelis and there has been a cover-up.

The plot centers around some possible shady dealings with the Americans. I notice in British films we Americans are portrayed a bit as cowboys, exceeding what the Brits would do, and operating with different protocol. It's fun to know what they think of us. Slick and brash.

This film doesn't have a lot of dramatic tension - its charm is more subtle and in the relationships and how they interact. Found it enticing and always love a good British mystery or spy story. To have such a stellar cast and smart dialogue is an added bonus.",1379462400,,1011,4.401069518716578

Michael Gambon is the wily spy - a perfect part for him. and Rachel Weisz is also perfect as the neighbor. There are twists you don't expect as you try to figure it out along with the 'hero'. It also makes you think about working in a job where you can trust no one and everyone is trying to outsmart everyone else. Each character has their own psychological profile and their own baggage. Some of the women come off obsessed with a single goal, so are less complicated. But by and large, this little mystery packs quite a story into a short time.

A spy thriller that kept me on the edge throughout yet did it without blood, gore, or over rated special effects... it  did it with damn good acting.. and great filming. I loved the up close in the face shots of the characters which showed off their abilities to draw you into their personality with just their facial expressions. AND, Judy Davis, for me, is still the best and meanest ""Bee-ITCH"" of all time. How I love to hate her characters as she plays them so well....she did NOT let me down on this one either!..

4660526,2,B005DJ7AYC,"How in the world did such a wonderful cast of actors agree to act in this lifeless movie? Its plot - if you can call it that - makes no sense, there is no suspense whatsoever, the main theme (American and Israeli governments are evil) is delivered with heavy-handed repetitions, and the ending is pathetic: The 'hero' betrays the last wish of his recently dead, lifelong best friend and fails to expose the 'really really really really hot secret"" because of a pretty girl half his age (another tired clich). I always wondered: Do movie makers really think we'd believe that a woman as young and beautiful as Rachel Weisz would ever fall in love with an old, poor, wrinkled civil servant? And that the old wrinkled civil servant would refuse her? The actors here do their best--and they are wonderful!--while the director and editor are exceptionally skilled in delivering a well paced and sharp cinema. Alas, they had no story to work with. Nothing happens. Mostly, there are long gazes, ""meaningful"" silences, and murmured dialogue as dramatic as lukewarm English tea.",1375747200,6,1070,4.884615384615385
4660527,2,B005DJ7AYC,"I like English spy films and the cast was tempting.  But this just didn't grab me.  I suspect it might be more interesting to British audiences who are at least more familiar with the local system of government.  Also I think it will be more interesting to aging, old-school types who fancy themselves romantically irresistable way up into their dotage.  The hero, Johnny something, played by Nighy...or perhaps I should say underplayed by Nighy, was so stiff upper-lip, that he barely moved his mouth when he spoke let alone show any emotion on his face.  Or his very strangely stiff body.  I kept thinking that this man needed a serious chiropractic adjustment or a yoga class--it seemed as if his head were welded onto his spine.  Maybe it was arthritis, I don't know, but it didn't add to the allure that this character was supposed to have for mulitple women of all ages and ethnicities.  He really could have passed for the grandfather of Rachel Weisz and it was highly unrealistic to assume that she was attracted to him.  The script was obviously written by a man who indulged in his own fantasies while writing this character.  Besides the gorgeous young Arab woman played by Weisz, a very attractive German art dealer seemed to still have the hots for him, and a nice-looking, plump secretary at the office was sleeping with him.  He was reputed to have quite a past, too....and dumped his wife while pregnant, not something that endeared him to this viewer.

I should have stopped watching when Michael Gambon died.

As many others have commented there are very strong political opinions expressed which may offend Americans and Israelis.  It's so one-sided and heavy-handed that one can't take this film very seriously, at least I couldn't.

As a political thriller it wasn't very thrilling, as a romance it totally fizzled.  I can't think of a good reason to watch this film unless you really hate America and Israel.  Or are a male septuagenarian with delusions of grandeur.",1375660800,5,1988,4.817109144542773

If you have been around the block with movies, you will likely find the movie predictable, and not a great deal different than several other movies and books of the same genre that you have encountered. I was so bored, it nearly put me to sleep. I only continued to watch out of courtesy to the person I was with.

But for myself, I find that no matter what I see him in, from Shaun of the Dead to Love Actually, to Arthur Christmas, to this unknown production (to me until today), he never fails to delight me. I think that this plot, unlike some other BBC productions, such as Spies of Warsaw starring my personal favorite Doctor, did not bore me to 4x fast forward, but rather took me by surprise with the fact that it enthralled me from the jazz credits introduction to its conclusion. I didn't find it dragging or convoluted; rather, I enjoyed the fact that the interpersonal dynamics did not culminate in some morbid romance of the body but of the soul. I only just viewed The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel this afternoon on DVR that left me bleary-eyed with the promise of life after life, but that Nighy can deliver the quintessential British stoicism that tramples the emotion of a father/friend/husband/suitor/spy with such aplomb is simply divine. Judy Davis has been a favorite of mine since Impromptu, second only to the music and she was a great foil to the staunch patriotism of Nighy's character.

Then there's the female home secretary whose main job it seems is to remind the audience that she can be just as big a trash mouth as the boys.  Finally, there's the sympathetic neighbor of our guy whose brother was killed by the evil Israelis while he waved a white flag as they bulldozed his house.

Interesting to see the interplay of Johnnie's skills as an intelligence operative and his struggles as a father and everyday person as well as the loss of his closest friend who also happens to be his boss. I was dismayed to see the triumph of his peer and the country's political leader (i.e., the ""bad guys"") but I suppose that is quite possible at the top of the intelligence community if you lose the support of your boss.  I wonder how Johnnie could have put himself in a stronger position in the office politics without demeaning himself as an individual. I believe family should come first, so maybe the outcome couldn't have been any different for him.

The casting is top notch, led by Bill Nighy as a world weary MI5 operative and analyst; Michael Gambon as his best friend and mentor; Judy Davis as a deliciously devious coworker and rival; beautiful Rachel Weitz as a mysterious neighbor who may or may not be trustworthy; and Ralph Finnes as a British prime minister in perilous times.

Bill Nighy holds this all together with a winning performance as a flawed but principled  figure, cool under pressure, an art collector who's also fond of jazz, whiskey and women. Near the end of his  career in the secret service, he has to put it all on the line for love, loyalty and patriotism.

There are no car chases or shootouts in this spy story. It's a cerebral thriller in the British style of Le Carre. I've watched it several times, and found more to enjoy in each viewing. Highly recommended!",1361836800,,900,4.677215189873418

4660640,3,B005DJ7AYC,"I love the jaded Brit spy genre and Bill Nighy is always enjoyable.  But I'm getting really tired of the way Rachel Weiz is used as the older man's ""crumpet"" in all her movies.  Her subtext is always: ""I'm crushingly intelligent and wounded, so after speaking mere sentences me (my character), you will fall unreasonably in lust with me."" (Apparently, in Daniel Craig's case, it was a real life fait accompli.)  I mean, she's attractive enough, but certainly no great beauty; and her ""intelligence"" often comes across as witholding and manipulative for the sole purpose of enticement.  I'm not doing a very good job of articulating this, but this is just ANOTHER movie that typecast her for these mannerisms rather than any acting skills.  I wish another actress would get more of her gigs just to break up the monotony.

I also found it really jarring the way David Hare's screenplay threw in the simplistic ""Israeli = hero, Arab = terrorist"" trope.  And, of course, Americans are bastards and are responsible for all the skullduggery in the world since the Cold War.  Yawn.  Obviously, David Hare was trying to pin the 7/7/7 attacks in London on the Blair government, implying that they were complicit and callously ""in-the-know"" ahead of time.

I'm a card-carrying Liberal, but I hate having PC/white hat vs black hat plot lines rammed down my throat. This film was simplistic and unworthy of the quality cast that was assembled.",1359504000,5,1432,4.880165289256198

4660642,4,B005DJ7AYC,"I agree with most of the reviews here: ""Page Eight"" is a superior offering from Masterpiece Contemporary.  It has the adult writing and nuance one expects from the best of British-made television that finds it way to America.  I'm a great fan of Bill Nighy, here playing Johnny Worricker, an intelligence analyst trying to get to the bottom of two issues: whether and why the truth about his lovely neighbor's brother's death in the Middle East has been suppressed, and how to cope with a report he sees that exposes Downing Street's knowledge about something that it would rush to deny knowing.

The cast is, naturally, terrific: Rachel Weisz plays Nancy, Worricker's grieving neighbor, who may or may not have taken the flat opposite his deliberately; Michael Gambon plays Baron, Worricker's boss, who knows he has a dicey heart and therefore ensures that Worricker is aware of the report; Felicity Jones plays Julia, Worricker's estranged daughter; Alice Krieg plays her mother, Worricker's former wife, now married to Baron; and Ralph Fiennes plays the Prime Minister whose butt will be on the hot seat if the report gets out.  Judy Davis does a wonderfully nasty turn as the bitchy, conniving head of Worricker's intelligence unit.

But it is Bill Nighy's performance that anchors ""Page Eight"" - he blends sardonic cynicism with a still-beating conscience perfectly.  His versatility never ceases to amaze me: not everyone can go from Victor the Vampire in ""Underworld"" to Johnny Worricker in ""Page Eight""!  Nighy is a true professional who knows his craft - you can also see him teamed with Weisz and Fiennes in the excellent, if disturbing film, ""The Constant Gardener"".

I have watched ""Page Eight"" three times, and each time noticed something that I missed on the previous viewing.  Some viewers may be uncomfortable with or sensitive to a one-sided political view that the plot involves (which I believe is derived from an actual event a few years ago in the Middle East) and I found myself questioning it, but the quality here is undeniable, and one can't deny quality due to political sensitivities.

Then, the heavy plot starts getting fleshed out: straight left-wing (British version) propaganda about the most mundane things in the world. No one can ever explain why the Israelis kill people and why the Americans are torturing just about everyone they can get their hands on. What happens with movies like this is: if they have explanations then the reasoning that is projected onto the enemies (Israelis and Americans) is so absurd and childish that it makes one cringe. So, instead, we find our mind filling in the blanks anyway and then we cringe. Don't bother wasting your time with this movie. You already know the story.

One would think that in the era of blu-ray, panning and scanning is a thing of the past. But evidently PBS still regards American viewers as not knowledgeable enough to see a film as intended by the director. The OAR of Page Eight is 2.35:1, which PBS panned and scanned to 1.78:1. This means we are losing one third of the picture as originally composed by David Hare and his cinematographer. Furthermore, PBS has the gall to put on the cover that its release is the original UK edition; nowwhere on the package does PBS alert the viewer that the film has been modified to fit the 16X9 TV screen. What an outrage.

If you wnat PBS to respect the intelligence of American viewers and stop this horrid practice in the future, do not buy this blu-ray disc.

There were moments of excellence, occasions where dialogue took a witty turn, but other than that this was a very dry, slow paced movie, particularly for a spy thriller. I don't say that a movie has to be car chases and gun fights like most American spy movies (there are none of those in this film), but it should be exciting at least. This was just...not. The mystery (if one can really call it that, as there was little mysterious about it) was uninteresting and obvious; the solution was predictable and dull. And the plot was the stuff of British PC fantasy, complete with brutally victimized and utterly innocent Arabs, evil, wicked, nasty and truly evil Israelis who murder innocents holding white flags and, of course, the big, bad torture-happy Americans. There was even a lovely, smart and witty Muslim intelligence agent (complete with sparkly black hijab) featured prominently, right off the bat, to complete the inclusive imagery -- inclusive to all but those nasty-innocent-murdering-Jews, presumably. I am all for making films that are ""politically correct"" in that they avoid nasty stereotypes and hateful/hurtful images; but I am not a fan of preachy films and ""message"" movies, particularly when the ""politically correct"" aspects of a film do in fact reinforce bigotry and hate. This is such a movie, featuring the virulent strain of anti-Israel hate that has traction in certain segments of British society and media.
The story itself (spoilers) involves two conspiracies: collusion between the big, bad Americans, who are whisking innocent people (who somehow still provide accurate information about terrorist activity) off all over the globe to torture them, and the Prime Minister, who is not only aware of these nefarious deeds but also does not reveal what intel is recovered for fear of having to give up the source. The other conspiracy is the murder and subsequent coverup of an anti-Israel activist (Weisz' brother) by, of course, the wicked, mean and nasty ""occupiers"" (Israel). Nighy must uncover the truth of the Prime Minister's involvement, and also find information about the murder/coverup of Weisz' brother. That sounds interesting, right? Alas, it's not. It's all done in an almost surgical manner, with no more interest or emotion than you would expect to find in the most mundane of discussions; indeed, I've seen more animation displayed over the weather or minor changes in the stock market than this film gets over matters of international misdeeds, murder and espionage.
All of which is too bad, because Weisz and Nighy gave good performances; they really do their best with this, and do manage to breathe some life in here or there. By and large, though, the script is just too dead to be saved, no matter how hard they try. This is one ""thriller"" that isn't ""thrilling"" at all. More like a ""snoozer"". 1/5 stars",1327795200,26,2951,5.024489795918368

The only issue I find with most of them is the tedious explanations and drawn out fight and chase scenes. This film has NONE of that - using a number of intelligent characters instead to create the dialog needed to know what is going on. And The hero's life is at risk, you can sense danger, yet no blows happen, there are no knife fights or guns drawn here, leaving enough suspense onscreen so as to keep you riveted to both characters and events, yet not so much suspense or fear that you need to look away and maybe miss something important.

One is never sure who are the good guys until very late in the movie.  It is very well written and, of course, Rachel Weisz and Bill Nighy were amazing.

Bill Nighy and this high calibre cast were just right, well suited to their roles. I was expecting more screen time for Rachel Weisz, Judy Davis and Mr. Gambon.

4660683,4,B005DJ7AYC,"In our world, the head of some Policitical parties have their own secret service division that answers to him, only. The people who work in this division, also openly work in the larger secret service group, but no one knows. These secrets are how our countries work, secret agents, secret groups, secret meetings, and it is no wonder that untoward things occur, and no one stops them. That is the tomb of this film, 'Page Eight'.

Bill Nighy playes Johnny Worriker a Senior spook in the MI-5. His boss and best friend, Benedict Baron, played by Michael Gambon, have the best and most interesting scenes together. This is spy country at its best. David Hare, the screenwriter, gives us the backstory in drips, and the tension and secrecy are handled slowly. It takes awhile to understand the story that is unfolding, and if you are a lover of the British spy stories, it is much easier to keep up. Someone in the US has given Benedict Baron some highly classified information that involves the Prime Minister. The PM knows and has hidden from the rest of the country that the UK and the US are involved in some nasty stuff. This is politics played the hard way, downright nasty and dirty. It is not until Bebedict Baron dies from a suggested heart attack, that Johnny Worriker realizes he is really in this all alone. He is clever enough to notice the young lady on his floor and her attractive young man and is able to put them in place. The secret Johnny carries and the information he has yet to gain, keep this film flowing. The introduction of Ralph Fiennes as the Prime Minister, and Saqskia Reeves as the dard boiled Home Secretary add the grace that is needed. Johnny finds himself in a tough spot, and we wonder can he dig himself out?

The film gives us a sense of how the MI-5 and the CIA has worked over the last years. The terrorists threats after 9-11 have added a sense of foreboding and dirty tricks are the name of the game. Bill Nighy gives a superb performance, he is natty and sexy and a great spy. Not quite James Bond, but that is not what we want. We want this man, Johhny Worriker, who seems to be a true patriot, a little tainted, but the best we have.

Highly Recommended. prisrob 11-12-11

4660684,1,B005DJ7AYC,"I watched this movie because somebody gave it 5 stars and I love English who dunnits.  But this is not the England of Agatha Christie, Arthur Conan Doyle or Dorothy Sayers. This plot is just pathetic.
The Americans and the Israelis are the bad guys. The Americans apparently have secret detention centers where they are torturing prisoners night and day and the Israelis apparently killed a poor peace activist waving a white flag. Our hero is on to the fact that the Prime Minister knows about this but is covering everything up. So does the truth come out or do the British bow down and kiss American and Israeli butts? That's what the dramatic tension of the movie comes down to.  It might resonate with English audiences but I found it completely uninteresting.
The acting is good. Some of the interactions between the characters are interesting and the political infighting is well done. This is a good movie to watch if you've had a stressful day and would just like to unwind and watch our hero struggle with issues of no consequence whatever.",1321056000,25,1050,4.73224043715847

4660686,3,B005DJ7AYC,"""Page Eight"" is a political thriller written and directed by David Hare for British television. Johnny Worricker (Bill Nighy) is a high-ranking MI5 agent, a direct subordinate to his oldest friend Benedict Baron (Michael Gambon), MI5's Director General. Benedict drops a bombshell Top Secret file on Johnny and his colleague Jill Tankard (Judy Davis) regarding American Black Site prisons and torture of terror suspects. On page eight, a source says that Downing Street already has the information, implying not only that the Prime Minister knew about human rights violations but that he may have withheld vital security information from MI5. Benedict makes sure the key interested parties know what's in the file and waits to see the fallout. Then he dies, leaving Johnny holding the evidence that could bring down the PM's government.

Johnny is faced with a dilemma: Carry out Benedict's plan to hold someone accountable and lose his job and perhaps his freedom. Or trade the information in the report for some concessions from the PM on other issues. This while Johnny is navigating a strained relationship with his grown daughter (Felicity Jones) and getting to know his neighbor Nancy Pierpan (Rachel Weisz), a book editor whose brother was killed by Israeli forces while he was protesting the destruction of Palestinian homes on the West Bank. David Hare uses the story to draw attention to some current political issues. In fact, that seems to be its primary purpose. And that is probably why it is poorly written. Hare has created characters and a thin plot as an excuse to mention Black Site prisons and Israeli law-breaking. Both issues are stuck out there with no context or nuance, as if on display.

In a strong cast, Judy Davis is the stand-out as Johnny's ambitious, two-faced nemesis. But I didn't feel any real emotion from Johnny or from the potential impact of his quandary. The story is lazily crafted and doesn't make much sense. Why would someone wanting to spy on Johnny insinuate himself with a neighbor whom Johnny has never met? Why would a high-ranking intelligence officer hire a family member to do illicit surveillance, who could easily be traced back to her? Why would Johnny carry 60,000 around for days in a plastic grocery bag that everyone can see through? And would MI5 really employ a man who has been married 5 times and has a string of mistresses, including married women, in a top security position? I realize that British security services have, indeed, made this kind of mistake in the past, but Johnny is very blackmailable.

""Page Eight"" has just the right tone and pacing for a cerebral thriller -which makes me wish it were one. David Hare is a better director than a writer. Or perhaps he just had a good editor. I like the cast -except for Ralph Fiennes, who is thoroughly unconvincing as the Prime Minister. I usually like Fiennes, but I get the impression he rolled out of bed, briefly, to do one scene and was never fully engaged. The plot barely exists, and the film's raison d'tre, its politics, doesn't say anything. Two issues are waved in front of the audience basically without comment. I suppose they are supposed to invoke whatever the audience has already absorbed from the daily news, but that doesn't say much for the film. Here we have a political thriller with only facile political statements, no thrills, and scarcely a plot.",1320796800,6,3392,4.895652173913043
4660687,2,B005DJ7AYC,"Like Roman Polanski's ""The Ghost Writer,"" this British show is a spy-thriller railing against the U.S. ties to the British government.  ""Page Eight"" also has a sinister Tony Blair surrogate.  The similarity between the two films is so great that even most of the same locations were used - including a roadside diner (probably in Germany).  They were probably filmed by  the same people, at the same time, for the same political purposes.

Despite all of these cookie-cutter similarites, ""Page Eight"" is somewhat subtler, and therefore more tolerable.  The cast is also stronger; for example, Ralph Fiennes replaces Pierce Brosnan as the evil-Blair.

Besides the U.S., this British production also targets Israel; a sub-plot involves Israeli culpability for the cold-blooded murder of a Palestinian-British woman's brother.

The silliest aspect of both films is the British self-portrayal of duped innocence.  Battalions of British writers have made a good living by writing espionage novels about the moral compromises inherent in intelligence work (Le Carre inevitably comes to mind).  Here, we are supposed to believe that the British are dragged into a quagmire of American brutality, torture and mayhem, only to finally realize - when it is far too late - that perhaps they should have held back.

I knew something might be askew with the show when Michael Gambon exits early on. Also, Bill Nighy is asked to play a manniquin type character with utter and complete flatness for the entire show.  I disagree totally with the positive reviews. The writing is dull and the director (also the writer) fails to narrate a rather simple story. Finally Ralph Fiennes looks like a gangster and perhaps it is not his fault--he plays the role written for him--but he simply has no credibility as a prime minister, even the worst of them.

I almost rated only a 4 because of the subject matter of American torture and waterboarding and trying to create a crisis over those accusations.....meanwhile nothing is of concern about the radicals cutting off people's heads. But the reality is that the leftists have effectively used these accusations for their political end and it is honest to acknowledge that fact. It is more of a movie about political enemies and how far those enemies within a government will go to eliminate their political opponents...How can your opposition be politically eliminated...and the use of the media in doing so?. It is a low key movie without explosions, automatic weapon fire, car chases and wrecks....and I like that fact. It is more of a verbal movie about relationships and attitude. It is about trust and the lack of trust.
