Also there is a lot of useful information about making techniques, types of microphones, which Weckl's explains from the very beginning. Easy to understand for everybody, including beginners. I used this did for my student project in audio engineering about recording drums.",1439510400,,349,5.363636363636363
8122011,2,B000FG6ZGW,"Save your money.  This DVD is outdated (2000) given that it does not compare to the depth and diversity of information available on the internet.  There is lots of information on the web that is just as good or better, whether it be in video form or on discussion forums.  I gave it two stars because I did learn a little bit, but not enough to make it worth buying.  I thought it was much more in-depth than it turned out to be.  The main feature is less than 75 minutes long.",1260662400,3,477,4.141304347826087
