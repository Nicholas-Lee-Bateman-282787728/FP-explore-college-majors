7823844,4,6302246911,"RELEASED TO TV IN 1975 and written & directed by Jeremy Kagan, Katherine is a docudrama loosely based on Diana Oughton, who sprung from an affluent Illinois family and went off to university in the early 60s, but gave up graduate school to teach poor farm workers how to read & write in Guatemala for a couple of years in the mid-60s. Back at graduate school in the states in 1966, she eventually decided to work full time for the Children's Community School, an alternative means of education, where she met and fell in love with CCS teacher Bill Ayers. During these years she morphed from liberal to loony liberal radical, eventually joining the so-called Weather Underground. She died in 1970 at the premature age of 28 due to an accidental nail bomb explosion, which was intended for a dance of non-commissioned officers and their loved ones at Fort Dix, New Jersey.

Sissy Spacek effectively plays the fictitious title character (aka Oughton). She was 25 during filming and never looked better (speaking as someone who never thought she was particularly attractive, but she certainly has a nice figure). Sissy was a formidable rising star at the time after Badlands (1973), but she wouldnt truly break out until the year after Katherine with Carrie (1976). Henry Winkler plays the Ayers character while taking a break from Happy Days. Imagine The Fonz as a college liberal in the 60s and youll have a pretty good picture of his performance. Art Carney and Jane Wyatt are also on hand as Katherines parents.

When this movie debuted on television in October 75, Oughtons crest fall five years prior was still fairly fresh in the minds of North Americans; and the strange Patty Hearst saga of 1974-75 was only then winding down with Pattys arrest the previous month. The public was naturally wondering how intelligent young American women could give up wealthy socialite standing to embrace poverty and join nutty revolutionary groups. ""Katherine"" is a minor hidden gem that effectually shows how. The movie wisely takes the middle road between far left and far right. It helps us to sympathize with Katherines mindset while plainly showing that its a doomed path.

Forget its TV origins, this is a good realistic drama about life in America during the turbulent 60s & early 70s. The movie showcases the political and social craziness of those times and how it changed youths, for better or worse. It's akin to 1980s A Small Circle of Friends and 2000's underrated ""The 70s. The soundtrack features several hits from the 60s, but they're not the original songs by the original artists, obviously to save money and prevent licensing problems.

THE MOVIE RUNS 97 minutes and was shot in San Francisco, Los Angeles and Tucson & Old Tucson, Arizona. ADDITIONAL CAST: Julie Kavner and Jenny Sullivan appear as Katherines best friend and sister respectively. Catlin Adams is also on hand.

7823845,3,6302246911,"Sissy Spacek was already well on the road to a significant big screen career in 1975 when she opted to do this TV movie loosely based on the life of Weatherwoman Diana Oughton.  Spacek has always shown a leaning toward socially conscious films, so it's no surprise that she was intrigued by the socio-political angle as well as the dramatic possibilities of this script (penned by Jeremy Paul Kagan, whose directorial and writing credits also show a socially conscious bent).

In 1975 you could still expect network television to at least OCCASIONALLY undertake a film like KATHERINE.  The nation was still reeling from Vietnam, newly reeling from  Watergate, and despite what TIME Magazine called ""the cooling of America,"" we were still trying to come to terms with the social and generational rifts that the 60s had wrought.

As a portrait of a revolutionary, KATHERINE is pretty much paint-by-numbers.  Passionate, well meaning and socially conscious rich girl Katherine Alman gets caught up in the spirit of the times.  At first she's a non-violent undergraduate activist, volunteering to teach inner city teens basic literacy.  Upon graduation, she heads off to South America, despite her parents objections, and witnesses firsthand the oppressiveness of the oligarchical regimes there.  Back in this country, she takes a job as an instructor at an alternative school in the Deep South, where she is further radicalized by the Fonz, I mean, Henry Winkler as a more radically inclined teacher there.

After leaving the school (forced out not only by the local pols, but also by their angry black colleagues who opt for a strict ""black pride"" curriculum for their young students), the two young activists become itinerant organizers, and eventually hook up with the Weather Underground.  Katherine herself becomes increasingly strident, disavows her earlier non-violent stance and becomes increasingly alienated from her family and friends.

Utterly convinced of the rightness of her cause, she ultimately and tragically loses her life in its name.  Like the real-life Oughton, she is blown up by her own bomb.  Unlike Oughton, who died when a Greenwich Village bombmaking factory exploded  killing almost all the Weathermen and -women in the building, Katherine is killed on a solitary mission to blow up some unnamed government target.  That's cinematic license, and it works fairly well.  Although it's not clear if the man plainly following her at the time is a government agent or one of her wealthy family's private detectives. Also not clear is if she actually winds up taking some innocent bystanders along with her--which would seem likely on a busy San Francisco street.

All of this could have been better developed.  The film hits all the expected--and, in some sense necessary, notes--but like most TV movies, remains somewhat sketchy on the one hand and cliched on the other.  I mean I could be wrong here, but it seems pretty ludicrous that every stick of dynamite used in the bomb that ultimately becomes Kathrine's, uh, undoing, is labeled ""DYNAMITE"" in big black lettering.  OK, I haven't seen much dynamite up close, I admit, and maybe it is labeled nowadays (or even 30 years ago) for safety's sake, but the effect in the movie is still pretty absurd.  At least in didn't say ""ACME"" as well.

The historical value of the film makes it worth watching.  It would not be totally out of place on the syllabus of a history or poli-sci course today.  In other words, it's a fairly good introduction to the history of the late 60s and early 70s.  And it is well acted.  Spacek's character is a ""hothead"" throughout, as one previous reviewer noted, but she has her tender moments too, particularly with her boyfriend and her family.  Art Carney and Jane Wyatt are ideally cast as her wealthy parents.  And Winkler is actually very good as Katherine's fairweatherman boyfriend.  He appears to be a somewhat underrated actor.

Interestingly, the best scenes are the pseudo-documentary interviews with all the main characters.  It is here that the characters seem to break away most distinctly from stereotypes and begin to reveal themselves in all their complexity.  Odd in a way, since usually interviewees almost reflexively adopt a persona for the camera.  Here, one suspects that it is only in these scenes that the characters get the chance (or perhaps, more accurately, feel compelled) to reflect on their actions and beliefs.  It is only at the film's end that it becomes clear that Katherine herself is more apparition than interview subject.  That makes her stridency--apparently even after death--all the more striking.",1114905600,,4642,5.085865257595772
