3123640,5,B00147FVKW,I bought this video with two others for my son.  This one is by far his favorite. He loves the songs & they're not even that obnoxious for the grownups of the house to listen to over & over again. I'm seriously considering buying other videos from the Lots & lots series. Well worth the 15 dollars.,1283904000,3,298,4.228070175438597
3123641,5,B00147FVKW,"My almost 3-year old son picked this DVD out at the library and has watched it daily.  The DVD comprises of video clips of various trucks on the road.  Each truck group has it's own song - which is a catchy, rock kind of a song.  I personally cannot sit through the DVD because it cannot hold my attention - however it holds the attention of my son and my 5-year old daughter.  Great way for your little truck lover to get his or her fill of trucks!",1279670400,4,449,4.068181818181818

3123646,5,B00147FVKW,"My two boys are 1 and 4, they absolutely go crazy for this truck video.
The music, film footage and variety of trucks are great.  It gets them up at the crack of dawn asking to watch it, over and over again!  The length of the video is perfect- definitely worth it!

I also own most other DVD's in the lots and lots series and recommend the entire collection.  Fire Trucks, Trains, and even the penquins! I cant wait for the second in this set.  Thanks Tom, awesome job!

If you have a young child into trucks- this is the dvd for you.  One word of caution and advise- buy headphones.",1396915200,3,369,3.88

3123667,5,B00147FVKW,"My son loves anything with wheels. Before he could talk, he could make a number of realistic vehicle sounds. He would disappear in his room for an hour just to roll a truck back and forth. We got this DVD to occupy him on a road trip when he was 17 months old. He's about to turn 3 in a few weeks and it is still his favorite. He makes me sing the songs to him at bedtime. He hums the tunes while reading picture books about trucks. This DVD is fantastic! Worth every single penny!",1390694400,,481,4.020833333333333

3123671,5,B00147FVKW,"I have an 8 year old with autism and he absolutely loves these videos because they are real-life, not animated.  They are so realistic with all of the sights and sounds that he gets totally absorbed.  There is not a ridiculous amount of narration as in some others we own, so you really get to hear the sounds of life with those trucks.  Highly recommend!",1382486400,,355,4.430769230769231

Really unhappy, I bought another one from a different website and it works great.",1378771200,,276,4.326923076923077
3123674,4,B00147FVKW,"Lots and lots of trucks indeed... the picture quality's not good, and the songs are both insidiously inane and catchy, but by golly if it doesn't deliver trucks as promised!

3123676,3,B00147FVKW,"My twin 28 month boys love this DVD. If you've bought the Lots of Planes or Lots of Trains from the same company, it's much the same. I find the lyrics and music to be annoying(but very catchy) and most of the footage is recycled over and over again. But the kids love it and that's all that matters.",1368489600,,300,4.101694915254237

3123680,5,B00147FVKW,"This movie is super cheesy but our 2 year old LOVES it! I'm not sure what awards the music has won, but it's catchy and silly. I'd recommend it if you have a truck lover in your home!",1355961600,,183,3.8421052631578947
3123681,4,B00147FVKW,"The Amazon.com warehouse must have a basement.  In that basement, in a dark corner that no one goes except maybe a few times a year, is where they probably keep their supply of 'Lots and Lots of Trucks Vol. 1' dvd's.

We found and showed the YouTube promo of this dvd to our son and he got excited.  It was ordered for his 4th birthday, and he LOVES is.  Crying ensues when this 40 minute video is over.  I'm not sure what the appeal is, but this production has some magical hold on toddler boys.

From an adult's prospective, this truck video can be summarized as a compilation of stock early 1990's footage combined with some home movies all set to music.  There is no commentary in this video; it's just a ballad of hard working trucks.  It perhaps looks like something that could have been spliced together in someone's basement over a weekend.  Nonetheless, the kids love it!

The music, film footage and variety of trucks are great.  It gets them up at the crack of dawn asking to watch it, over and over again!  The length of the video is perfect- definitely worth it!

I also own most other DVD's in the lots and lots series and recommend the entire collection.  Fire Trucks, Trains, and even the penquins! I cant wait for the second in this set.  Thanks Tom, awesome job!

We found and showed the YouTube promo of this dvd to our son and he got excited.  It was ordered for his 4th birthday, and he LOVES is.  Crying ensues when this 40 minute video is over.  I'm not sure what the appeal is, but this production has some magical hold on toddler boys.

From an adult's prospective, this truck video can be summarized as a compilation of stock early 1990's footage combined with some home movies all set to music.  There is no commentary in this video; it's just a ballad of hard working trucks.  It perhaps looks like something that could have been spliced together in someone's basement over a weekend.
