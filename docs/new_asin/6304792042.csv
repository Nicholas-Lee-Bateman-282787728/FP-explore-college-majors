7877829,5,6304792042,"I just recently ordered the rated version of the video. I love Mitch and Neely's wedding scene on the Dawn Princess cruise ship. I think that it was so beautiful with the flowers around the Grand Plaza of the Dawn Princess  cruise ship. I think Gena Lee Nolin and David Hasselhoff did a terrfic job  when their characters ""Neely Capshaw and Mitch Buchannon"" got  married on the cruise ship. I love the video and would recommend to anyone  I know even my friends and family.",944524800,,473,4.529411764705882
7877830,5,6304792042,"I simply loved this movie. It was a great piece of writing, acting and a fantastic storyline. I thought the romance was so cute and subtle and being a David-fan I loved his acting. Everybody else was also great in this  movie. But the romance and the video clip at the end, made my heart melt  away. Congratulations David, you're still the best.",918777600,2,345,4.4603174603174605
