8245783,5,B0012FEC2Y,"Pros - This Level 1 DVD is way better than the Google free tutorials.  Planning and presentation by the authors, Tadros and Oliver, are very well done.  Following their outline on a TV or a computer is easy and understandable.  I highly recommend this DVD for all beginners and most intermediate users.  Intermediate users will receive a refresher of the basics and possibly learn a shortcut or two.

Cons - I guess the DVD series production costs were expensive. A well communicated teacher is worth more money; however, Level 1 and 2 DVDs for the current Level 1 price would be more appropriate.  I hope there is more intermediate and advanced content on the Level 2 DVD.",1273449600,,673,4.7094017094017095
8245784,5,B0012FEC2Y,"I love this tutorial, I played it on my old laptop, while working on my new one.  It was so much better than trying to learn from a book, you can stop the DVD when you get stuck on something and replay it or pause it to work on the example at your pace.  I am just finishing getting my Interior Design degree and after using this DVD was able to produce a fantastic 3-D image for a school project that looked really professional.  I have the 2nd in the series and am looking forward to going through it.  A great companion product for Sketch Up is a plug-in called ""Podium"" which gives you photo-real clarity to the 3-D images you created in Sketch Up...I agree with the other reviewer that I hope this series continues to the 3rd, they have a great format.",1231545600,6,757,4.236111111111111
8245785,5,B0012FEC2Y,"This is about as close to having a private Workshop/Seminar in your own home as you can get. Play the DVD on the TV, use Sketchup on your computer simultaneously. When it comes to TIME EFFECTIVENESS, this DVD destroys any workbook. I have Level One, Level Two, subscribe to the FREE Podcasts, and love them all. I hope they produce a Level 3 DVD.",1217721600,8,346,4.421875
