8035092,3,B0002Z1ORG,"The ""Perry Mason"" novels were a form of mystery stories where the detective is a lawyer and the solution occurs in a courtroom. A real life trial is not as dramatic. Erle Stanley Gardner often educated his readers with new technology or medical-legal facts, and often warned of swindles. The TV stories are the simplified and condensed versions of the original novel; many of these stories were created for TV. Some may criticize the tactics of Perry Mason but they represent life before the modern legal rules of the 1960s (""habeas corpus""). Dramatic events are rare in court. The prices and automobiles date these stories, so do the monetary figures. They record the styles and culture of the 1950s. Note the familiarity with firearms. The wealth of character actors enriches these stories. They portray their emotions by facial expressions. [Does anyone recognize the view from Perry Mason's office window?]

""The Case of the Lazy Lover"" begins when a man goes outside to move his car and finds a body in the driveway. Mrs. Allred takes Bob Fleetwood away. Perry Mason and Paul Drake go to the motel where Mrs. Allred registered. They are gone, but Mrs. Allred is home. Lt. Tragg arrives to question Mrs. Allred. Her car was found wrecked with a body in it. Mrs. Allred tells Perry she was planning a divorce from her husband. Bob Fleetwood tells his story about what happened. Mr. Overbrook tells his story about the tracks by his house. The conflict between two witnesses leads to freedom for Perry's client.

""The Case of the Jaded Joker"" shows comedian Danny Ross complaining about his material. He plans to return to television after a 3-year absence. A telephone brings bad news. We see the politics at a talent agency. Ross visits Perry Mason to seek advice. He had no written contract with Charley Goff. We learn how show business works. The next morning Goff's secretary finds his body under his desk; the police are called. Later Perry shows up to discuss the contract with Ross. [There are comments on current culture.] Freddy Green's fingerprints are on Danny Ross's pistol, the murder weapon. Paul Drake checks out various places, and finds a new fact. Who has a good alibi? The coroner testifies as to the wound to the head. Did a blow to the head precede the shot? The trendiness to this story, a typical 1950's script, makes it quite dated today. This was not taken from an Erle Stanley Gardner novel and it shows in the weak plot. Do the camera shots telegraph the identity of the murderer? [Was the relationship between Danny and Freddy underplayed?]",1219622400,,2571,4.8144796380090495
