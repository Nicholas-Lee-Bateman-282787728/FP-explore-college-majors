563296,5,6302994063,"One of the best movies I have seen of this type.  We have watched this movie at least twice a year since the beginning. Typical parent ""where did I go wrong"" to the corrupt head of the federation, everyone rings  true. This movie also has a Cinderella story built in with Fran as Cinder.  Enough pathos and hysterics for the whole crowd.  Many memorable lines too.
When will it be on DVD?????",921283200,2,392,4.402777777777778
563297,5,6302994063,"After watching Strictly Ballroom over 100 times, I tried to pinpoint exactly what made me love it.  The fact that it's set in Australia is fun and a twist.  Scott is attractive, and Fran blossoms throughout the movie.  The dancing is awesome.  The dialogue is witty.  The best thing about this  movie is it's magic.  It's a movie that sweeps me away, and makes me feel a  part of it.  See it.  You'll love it.",914976000,2,409,4.333333333333333

I fell so deeply in love with this film that I used it to teach my English classes for many years.  Even the students who weren't interested in anything got swept up and involved in this movie.  I used the film to teach the components of plot, static/dynamic characters, theme, conflict, etc.  I've lost count how many times I've watched this film.  I just ordered the DVD so I could watch it again. I had shown it to my classes on cassette - ha!  That really dates me!

The overriding message of inclusiveness culminating in one spectacular and stunning dances sequences that brings me up to my feet every time I see the movie.

564832,4,6302994063,"There have been a long line of feel good movies that have come out of Hollywood and now out of Australia with the effort under review, Strictly Ballroom, a film dealing with the rigors and stamina necessary to be a successful ballroom dancer, a discipline that from a look at the work ethic portrayed in this film rivals any more overtly recognized athletic endeavor like gymnastics or swimming. A feel good movie being one where some problem is overcome during the course of the film involving a struggling person who teams up with another struggling person to overcome some problem and then there is a little off-hand romance to keep the air light. Oh yeah and it helps if in the feel good film where a female is involved that the female turns from an unwanted ugly duckling into a fetching woman. Under that standard this effort qualifies in spades as a feel good movie.
Here is how it played out. Down Under in Australia Sandy, a second generation ballroom dancer whose star is rising in that rarified world, and who is the great hope of his dance teacher mother and his defeated (by his mother) father who as the film unfolded turned out to have been the great rising star of his generation-except he listened to his own drummer and wound up on cheap street. Sandy faces that same future, it might have been in the DNA, to listen to a different drummer. What was gnawing at Sandy was that he was confined to what had become the same old, same old of ballroom dancing. He wanted to take his dancing to a different level.
Alone comes ugly duckling and wannabe big-time dancer Fran who badgers Sandy, against his better judgment at first, to teach her to dance, dance what is in his head winning dance contests be damned. Naturally they click first at the dance level, then at the romantic level (as she gets better looking along the way). The key is the Latin beat that white bread Sandy has hidden in him which can be brought out by Latina immigrant Fran, or better her father a master as the Latin specialty -the paseo robles.
Needless to there have to be challenges along the way to feel good. Defeat at Frans inabilities at first, the demands of Sandys mother along with the edicts of the ballroom dancing establishment in Australia to toe the classic line.

He meets a female dance student (who starts out with acne and gigantic glasses) who encourages his dream.  There are the only two serious characters in the movie. The rest of the cast are buffoons made up and dressed like circus clowns with personalities to match.  This could have been a good move, instead it is a farce.",1435622400,2,589,4.36697247706422

Professional ballroom dancer wants to try new moves that may not necessarily be acceptable in the competition, so his partner quits on him.  He still wishes to compete so his mother (who owns the dance studio) has auditions for a new partner without success.  Winning is considered a place of status by judges and parents so the son is desperate.  A geeky girl with a love of dance but no skill challenges the son to have her as a partner, and together they embark on a learning journey of the how to be the best dancer, what secrets lie in his parents past, and what it means to love.  All the while, they deal with his mother working to arrange the best dance partner and encouraging her son to focus on winning and thus leave the 'geeky girl' behind.  Ultimately, at the ridicule of his ex-partner and the underhanded sabotage plans of the judge, the unconventional pair learn to work together, and listen to the rhythm of their hearts.",1425081600,5,979,4.47191011235955

STRICTLY BALLROOM: Them Aussies sure make some weird, wacky--and wonderful--films. This one is a mutant hybrid of ""Dirty Dancing"" and ""This Is Spinal Tap""; a terpsichorean satire with a singular style, an enormous heart and an extravagant sense of humor. The competitions, for example, are surreal spectacles of psychedelic lighting and costumes even Lady Gaga would reject as garish.

Much of the film consists of sly skewerings of the typical ""illicit lovers"" romance plot and the ""rebel without applause"" genre; the surprise lies not so much in clichs that are tweaked, flipped and twisted, but in how endearing the characters are, and how attached to them we become. Their coach tells them a dancer needs looks, charm and confidence; this film has all three.

Often hilarious, occasionally exhilarating, touchingly romantic and deeply sweet, ""Strictly Ballroom"" is a delightful reminder that you can find liberation and redemption in any form of artistic expression, if you just have the courage to follow your heart--and even if you dance to the beat of a different drummer.",1422403200,,1338,4.99103139013453

566085,5,6302994063,"Dancecentral.com.au has this to say about Antonio Vargas, who plays Fran's father: ""Antonio Vargas is recognized as one of the world's leading Flamenco dancers and choreographers. Ingenious, innovative and a perfectionist, he performs and teaches internationally, with works for theatre, cinema and television. He is known as a guardian of an esoteric art form that, despite its massive recent popularity, remains elusive to most of those who flock to see it. He is a master of the complex rhythmic syncopations that characterize much of the excitement of Flamenco.

Antonio Vargas won accolades for his performance as the gypsy father, Rico in the Australian box-office hit movie Strictly Ballroom, directed by Baz Luhrmann and the winner of the Golden Globe Award and of the Cannes Film Festival Golden Camera Award for Young Directors. More recently he choreographed and staged a Flamenco segment for Tom Cruise's Mission Impossible II directed by John Woo. He also played a cameo in this film. Other acting credits include Time Trax.

He was electrifying in all of his scenes in Strictly Ballroom.",1418947200,3,1101,5.25

566229,5,6302994063,"If you are a fan of Baz Luhrman films this is a good one--maybe his best. Baz produced this as a live show and, based upon audience reactions, re-fashioned it until audiences went crazy for it. Then he made the film. It is his most widely crowd pleasing film to date. Some may like or dislike any one of his films, but practically everyone falls for this one.

In essence, it is a modern day Australian Cinderella story. A young dancer, in line for the ballroom dancing competition crown, keeps adding new and crowd pleasing dance steps which are not approved by the dancing federation. He keeps being warned to stop and use only approved dance steps, but he simply can't limit himself to dance steps which could be learned and mastered by anyone who takes up dancing lessons (which is why the federation approves them--because anyone who takes up ballroom dancing CAN learn them).

He can do things ordinary dancers can't do and refuses to limit himself to the lowest common denominator of dancers who can't perform his steps. In frustration, his dance partner leaves him to dance in the competition with another, more conservative, champion who won't keep rocking the boat the way he always does.

Enter Fran: A plain looking, far less talented student being instructed at his mother's dance studio. She wants to dance in the competition with him and he agrees--to everyone's consternation.

As the two of them practice their hearts out, we learn of his mother and father's past--his father lost the same battle of wills with the federation in a competition years earlier, and gave up professional ballroom dancing because of it. We also learn of Fran's family history and what she has given up to dance.

As the two young dancers begin to look as though they might actually have a chance, they begin falling for each other and one federation judge starts stacking the deck against the two of them.

It's an underdog story, a Cinderella story, a musical (in it's way), a romance, a comedy and a heck of a feel-good movie in the end.

This was the breakthrough film that launched Baz Luhrman's filmaking career.",1411862400,6,2112,4.754098360655738

566978,5,6302994063,"Okay, I'm going to dust the cobwebs off this 1992 comic musical and encourage you to watch Scott Hastings do his ""crowd-pleasing steps!"" then thrill to the sound of one lone pair of trembling hands as it claps in that echoing ballroom. Goosebumps every time!

Australian Baz Luhrmann (""Australia"") launched his Red Curtain Trilogy with this sweet, goofy, romantic, cartoon of a musical. The other two in this trio are ""Romeo and Juliet"" (1996) and ""Moulin Rouge!"" (2001). All three are conceived and developed with only one thing in mind: The Audience. And that's US!

These wonderful actors make it happen:
  * Paul Mercurio (""Joseph"") is Scott Hastings, son of the proprietors of a struggling ballroom dance studio. His father is a hen-pecked sad sack, while his mother is an ambitious spark plug. They both agree that ""this is Scott's year to win the Australian Pan Pacific Championships"" and bring glory to their studio.
  * Barry Otto (""Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole"") is Scott's father, quietly melting into the woodwork, as his wife runs the show.
  * Pat Thomson (""Phar Lap"") is fearless as Shirley Hastings, Scott's mother who is tone deaf to everything but her own ambition. I'm sorry to say that she died the same year this film was completed and we lost a fine actress.
  * Tara Morice (""Razzle Dazzle"") is Fran, the poor student stuck in Beginners, who has aspirations... She does janitorial work to pay for her lessons. It is Scott who asks her, ""Do you think you could dance without those glasses?"" (I LOVE clichs!)
  * Bill Hunter (""Finding Nemo"") is Barry Fife, who disqualifies Scott for not using Federation-approved dance steps. Hunter, who died in 2011, was part of Australia's acting aristocracy.

As you can tell, the plot swirls around an upcoming Ballroom dance contest, with Scott in a frantic search for a new dance partner, as his has been stolen away by the reigning champ. Fran wants to audition, but she's a Beginner!

Be prepared to completely buy into this plot, root for the good guys, hiss at the bad ones, watch Fran's father do an amazing Paso Doble with his mother-in-law (Fran's grandmother), and thrill to some spectacular ball- room dancing with stunning costumes. (Luhrmann's parents danced in Ballroom competitions, so he knows whereof he speaks.)

The plot is relatively simple. The Australian Ballroom Federation wants things status quo and a dancer who wants to change things. The movie works on several levels. It is a love story, dance/musical, and drama all in one. And, if you can get into it, a feel good movie that might produce some tears as well.

I, for one, got into it and never tire of watching the movie. However, I do have a warning with this movie. The accents/language sometimes are heavy and tough to comprehend. But it doesn't take away from the overall experience. Enjoy...",1376265600,3,805,4.469387755102041

I am very dissapointed and almost about to throw out this Bluray right after i see the first two minutes.
It is even way worse then the DVD that I own for a long long time. The video quality is so so so bad that I cannot even compare to any other movies that I own in Bluray. ( I have over 1000 Bluray discs)
Most of the Lurman's Bluray Re-Release were all very good transfered ones so I believed this might be as good as others.
No sir. I just waste my money and time  waiting this disc to be arrived.

He finds a complimentary partner where least expected. He gives her the confidence to preform, she gives him, through the time he spends with her family, the sense of rhythm he lacks. Together they do a final Latin dance at the Grand Prix Pacific dance competition. The powers that be try to stop them by stopping the music, as new steps are not allowed. The beat of the music is provided by the audience, and then the dance finishes with a flourish and an invitation to the audience to join them.

567250,4,6302994063,"Scott Hastings, a young and talented Australian ballroom dancer, is wanting more than the usual steps that will win championships but doesn't challenge his ability or ambitions. Fran, a young woman with Spanish gypsy roots, has been secretly in love with Scott and suggests that he teach her his steps and get his shot at his life-long dream of winning the Pan-Pacific Grand Prix Dancing Championship: his way and on his terms.

Strictly Ballroom gives us a very familiar trope of a fairy tale with the method of direction and acting as counterbalances to what would easily have been a dull and forgettable film. It moves fast from the dance steps to the dialogue to the progression of the main leads, Scott and Fran. Its in-your-face cliches, chessiness and over the top performances by most of the cast throughout the whole of the movie, and at first, slightly off-putting but I stuck with it because there was something cheery and genuine about the performances and I liked the different, intriguing flavor on a story that is so very familiar. When I understood that the blatant stereotyping and gaudiness was on purpose, I began to appreciate the tongue-and-cheek-smartness of the script and the careful balance that Baz Luhrmann is so well known for. He really shoves it in your face, then backs off, giving us characters that aren't as cheesy or cliched as first presented but human and flawed, yearning for things lost and afraid of what could be. The most interesting and surprising part of this movie was the infusion of Spanish gypsy roots and dance that Scott eventually embraces, as well as the diverse musical score that kept the beat and liveliness that never waned.

Paul Mercurio (Scott Hastings) and Tara Morice (Fran) aptly executed their roles. They clearly understood Luhrman's vision and intent, offering us the Luhrmann style while giving us characters with depth; two people we wanted to cheer on and smile when they succeeded. They are equals in their partnership, both on and off the ballroom, and their romance is so cute and enjoyable to watch. Overall, I was glad to find this gem and won't mind watching it again.",1359676800,,2142,4.881868131868132

567253,5,6302994063,"""Strictly Ballroom"" is a fabulous film that I've loved for years, so much that I have owned it progressively on videotape, laser disc, and DVD.  I waited for so long for it to come out on blu-ray, but to my surprise, it is still only available imported from another region.  Coincidentally, my player started malfunctioning, so I bit the bullet and bought a new all region player, which wasn't that much more expensive than a regular one anyway.  I immediately ordered the import blu-ray, and it does not disappoint.

Everytime I've seen it I come away with something different, find myself enchanted by the characters all over again, with their quirks, their humanity, their ""bigger-than-lifeness"", and who can't love a movie where the main character unravels and embraces the super-macho bullfighter's dance, the Paso Doble, with a freight train suddenly taking over the screen - how Freudian can you get?

I cannot provide enough superlatives to attribute to this film, it's that good. Simple, sweet, lovely, and a sheer joy to watch.

Before I watched this movie I was lost and alone without anything to help inspire me to wake up the next day. I shuffled to and fro on my daily grind without much hope for the future. But then Strictly Ballroom entered my life! Through the magic of dance, bouffant hair, and the sweet musical stylings of Time After Time I've found that through dance and musical expression magic has once again entered my life. When I go to buy a sandwich from the store, dancing my way from my apartment to the grocery, small children dance along with me. Both women and men swoon and small birds complete my dance steps like feathered streamers from my hands and feet. Sometimes the clouds part and the sun itself shines a spotlight down on me.

I can't suggest this movie enough - both as entertainment and a life defining self help cinematic masterpiece that will change both who you are as a person as well as your feelings about dancing in front of giant coke signs.",1347580800,3,1035,4.362694300518135

If you're thinking, ""but it's about ballroom dancing!"" - well, don't! I watched this film many years ago before I'd even seen Baz's R&J, and to be honest I thought I'd hate it - I just couldn't be bothered to turn the TV off (sad but true). However, itt soon had me in its grasp and it's one of my favourite films, and more than worthy of comparison with Baz's later offerings, much as I love MR in particular.

The only reason I would give this film less than 5 stars (which I couldn't possibly bring myself to do anyway!!) would be the DVD extras. The behind the scenes documentary is informative, but unfortunately narrated by an unbearably cheesy American voice such as you get on the very worst tackiest film trailers - painful! And aside from that there's not a huge amount on offer. It's almost worth the cringe-worthy voice, though, to see Baz looking decidedly young and whipper-snapper-ish... any Baz fans will be amused! It's a shame that the film originally came out before DVDs and extras were a consideration - they seem to be cobbled together somewhat.

All in all - worth getting on DVD for the sound and picture quality, especially in this music-driven colourful film, but Baz should be ashamed to have let a film of his go out with less than excellent extras.",1346803200,,1525,4.538181818181818

567476,4,6302994063,"Just got the Special Edition DVD, and I have to say I was disappointed. It only has two new features, a 22 minute documentary outlining the journey from a drama student project in the early 80's to the Cannes Film Festival, which is mostly Baz Luhrman narrating. Plus there's a deleted scene. ONE deleted scene. (What the heck does ""dweezy"" mean? Google was no help). Why not put a video of the stage play on the DVD?

The commentary track is the same as the one on the 2002 DVD release. I would have loved a new commentary track from the cast (Luhrmann can talk your ear off which is great in a commentary, but he often talks over his two colleagues which gets annoying at times), and more deleted scenes would have been awesome. Or at least outtakes. I also noticed they corrected one of the gaffes:  the scene where Scott & Fran dance on the roof for the first time showed a crew member's head peeking over the roofline. This edition corrected that. Sloppily.

If you're an uber SB fan like me, yeah, you should probably pick this up if you have the original version on DVD. This is one of my top five movies of all time, right up there next to Raiders of the Lost Ark, Aliens, and Blade Runner. But the 2002 DVD is probably a lot cheaper, and has almost all of the features of this new edition.",1342483200,,1298,4.311475409836065

  There is the beginner 4-eyed ugly duckling who is enamored with the established dashing male.  Through abject contact learning new moves and practising in secret, the male begins to see beyond the exterior of the female and a love begins to stir.  This is a forbidden love as the male can only win the coveted Pan-Pacific competition by dancing with a 'known' partner, dancing only approved steps.

  In the end, true love prevails, but not until after the female blooms into a stunner and the show has ran through a most excellent soundtrack of favorites.  Many of the tunes will surprise you, not only for their selection, but also for the arrangements used.

567610,4,6302994063,"Strictly Ballroom has an intentionally predictable, familiar story: mix together a bit of the wayward underdog fighting the establishment, a bit of ""The Ugly Duckling,"" and a bit of Romeo and Juliet, and you can guess exactly what will happen. But the film isn't much the worse for that. It's still fun and cuttingly funny, making fun of its subject and characters while simultaneously showing honest respect for them--no small feat. The subject and setting (provincial amateur ballroom dancing in Australia) were certainly unusual for the time: remember this film was made way before the ballroom-dancing reality show craze.

This movie is also quintessential Baz Luhrmann. The first part of Luhrmann's ""Red Curtain Trilogy,"" Strictly Ballroom helps lay the groundwork for the self-consciously theatrical, artificial style that Luhrmann would perfect in William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet and Moulin Rouge! Here you see Lurhmann's exaggerated--at times almost surreal--visuals, his use of kaleidoscopic color set in hyperkinetic motion, his love for the garish and outlandish, his mixture of sentiment and sarcasm, as well as his love of pop tunes from the last few decades.

I found that Yes, the dancing was phenomenal and it was sorta romantic (though they could have built up the relationship a little more, the story line was not backed up enough with character history and how they all fit in. When you finally find out what has all been going on with the parents I felt like I was getting whip lash because I had already formed an opinion of the mom and dad and here I got all this new information that I had to reprocess).

As for the humor I totally didn't get. The Mom was ALWAYS screaming and yelling which really turned me off. I don't know if it's because I'm not used to Australian humor or if it just wasn't really there, but I found it a real bummer.
I had expected a lot more from the reviews that I had read.
So all in all, if you are buying this for the dancing then it's a great buy, but if you're getting it for the story line, forget it and get Shall we Dance (Japanese) instead.",1293408000,,1102,4.120930232558139

It's very tongue in cheek funny and the dance sequences are great fun to watch.  The story is pretty predictable - sort of an Ugly Duckling/Cinderella story done on the ballroom dance floor.  There are some sequences that are done quite seriously and I think are amazing.  The scene when Scott first meets Fran's family and learns how to truly dance the Paso Doble is one of my favorites.  Paul Mercurio is so sexy during those scenes - sort of like an Australian Patrick Swayze.  There's also a scene when Scott and Fran are dancing alone backstage at a dance competition that is so sweet and tender. The message of the movie is ""A life lived in fear is only half lived.""  Scott and Fran both want to live and dance without fear but they have family, friends and Australian Dance Federation President Barry Fife attempting to stand in their way.  Who will prevail in the end?  I'll bet you can guess.

Filmed with a marvelous Aussie cast, Luhrmann made up for a clearly limited budget with flashy lighting, dynamic color and a an eclectic mix of musical styles. Though referred to as musical, there is no on-camera singing and the songs are used as dance background for the most part. Doris Day's hit, ""Perhaps"" is referred to by Luhrmann as a ""pricey"" acquistion for the film but very much worth it.

Disney fans will want to listen for ""Os quindines de ya ya"" which serves as the key music for the father's dancing past. ""Ya ya"" was the big number in Walt Disney's The Three Caballeros in which the produce lady danced with Donald Duck, the townspeople and an animated dancing city. Another song, ""No Other Love,"" was a '50s pop tune adapted from Chopin which was a hit for Jo Stafford and was one of the handful of Disney songs that were not created for movies but just as pop hits, like ""Shrimp Boats"" and ""Mule Train.""

I never could quite cotton to the whiplash pace of Moulin Rouge, so even though Strictly Ballroom sometimes has a Howard Hawks rate of speed, it's not all in the editing but rather in the performances, which are uniformly excellent. The opening scenes were so raucously done that they reminded me, of all things, of an episode of The Monkees.

Parents should take note that, although this film has a PG rating and is not as gritty as it might have been, there is some strong language and one scene in which a dance judge and and a young woman are seen in bed, vigorously engaged what my dad used to call ""spoo-ja-doo.""

This special edition DVD includes an audio commentary from 2002 with Luhrmann, Choreographer John ""Cha Cha"" O'Connell and Production Designer Catherine Martin and a new half-hour chronicle of the story behind the film, which was a Cinderella story in itself, from a student musical to a plucky little film with a first-time director and star to a dubious opening with a negative review, all the way to a Cannes Film Festival award win. This film was quite a change of pace in its day, many years before the dawn of popular TV dance competition shows like Dancing with the Stars and So You Think You Can Dance.

Have to add, though, that the first time Antonio Vargas and Paul Mercurio begin the pivotal paso doble dance, it can't help now but conjure up an image of Buzz Lightyear's Spanish mode in Toy Story 3.",1291420800,,2753,4.6894409937888195
567669,5,6302994063,"Let's do the technical stuff first.  First DVD release was horrible.  Video was washed out and audio was not great.  Probably rushed out when film started to take off in the mid 90's.  It had a minor success when released in Australia in 1992.  People there knew of it and it developed a ""cult"" following...and launched Baz Luhrmann's directorial career.  Australian movies are light on sets and are mainly shot on location, so some of the ""inside"" angles, lighting and composition aren't Hollywood. Video quality in later releases was much better, the latest DVD relase has brilliant colors and the audio is digitized.  All in all a DVD of respectable quality. (Get the DVD in the case showing a red curtain)  I have not yet seen the blu-ray version.  Vendors are holding it hostage at about US$25.00..so I'll wait.  Now, the story & its production.  I worked with video in the TV news biz for 50 years so I know a little bit abut film techniques that might help you along in your understanding of how certain ""feelings"" are extracted from the audience.  Luhrmann starts off the movie with a musical flourish, swirling colors and good music (he's got your eye now)...then segues into a semi-documentary style with several of the actors talking in soundbites ala local TV to help set up the story(now you understand the story and its emotional base).  And its a story of the intense competition in amateur dance in Australia.  If you fear soccer moms and their intensity or Little League dads...well you get the idea.  The fact that young Scott is a rebellious lad who has tremendous talent, but no desire to dance the steps dictated by Australian Dance Federation rules...has his mother and partner upset to the point of tears.
Enter Fran, a rookie student at the same dance school where Scott's the number one male dancer.  Luhrmann is sneaky.  He and crew do some neat things to make their story move along and help you see that the two main characters are the core of the story...and help you figure out that there's more going on between Scott and Fran than a tango or two. Notice that all the other dance pairs are looking away from each other when they dance, while Scott and Fran are always looking at each other.  Tells you right away where their focus is.  Notice how, at the beginning, Fran really is an ugly duckling. (Morice played her role without makeup it seems for the first third of the movie--that takes guts). Then her hair settles down, the makeup goes on and she becomes a really nice looking girl...not sexy, but like many attractive girls....certainly someone any of us merely human males could find and get acquainted with at a high school dance.  And with that change, and her determination, the audience falls for Fran in her quest...first to dance with Scott, even though she's a rookie....and then her increasing infatuation with him.  Reviewers said the movie had Australian women crying and Australian men joining dance clubs.  You'll love the movie. It's now somehwerre in my top five all time, along with Casablanca, The third Man, Lawrence of Arabia and Bourne 3. And it needs a sequel.  Fran & Scott need to complete their relationship.  Other notes:  Paul Mercurio (Scott)is currently hosting a cooking show, and is a judge in the Australian version of Dancing with the Stars.  Tara Morice, Fran, is still an actress.  She has had minor parts in several Lurhmann productions and larger parts in a couple of other movies and on Australian TV.  Before Strictly Ballroom she had never danced professionally.  She also sings one of the songs on the soundtrack which is worth owning.  Mercurio is the son of an American-turned-Australian charactor actor you saw in Crocodile Dundee.  He is a dancer by trade who had never acted till Strictly Ballroom.  By the way, he finished the big ending scene on a badly sprained ankle.",1288396800,3,3855,4.7677224736048265
567670,5,6302994063,"Strictly Ballroom is an excellent film.  It is filled with comedy, drama, wonderful dancing, flashy costumes, and an engaging story.  Dancers will especially enjoy it.

567720,5,6302994063,"So Strictly Ballroom. I don't know exactly what I was expecting of this movie, but it was definitely different from what I expected. But that is not to say that I did not enjoy it a ton. I thought it was overall a good and really fun movie. The music and dance throughout the movie, as pretty much a method of story telling, worked very well for the movie and keep the story meaningful and engaging.  Some of the characters and lines were a bit outlandish, but all in all, it fit together remarkable well, and created an enjoyable experience.

Even thought there was nothing overly remarkable about the story's main love interest plot between Fran and Scott, I felt that it still worked out well. The discussion of dance as a act of creating a perceived love as part of the act was interesting and something I have thought about before so I found it nice to be brought up in the movie (even if only for a few lines). I thought that most of then characters, though maybe a bit simple, really came together to create a pretty good story. My personal favorite character was Doug though (even before finding out about his secret). I thought his overall fairly eccentric character was a lot of fun and in ways very relatable.

All in all, this was a fun movie. For anyone that is willing to give a bit of a different way to tell a story a chance I would recommend giving it a shot.",1276473600,,1376,4.346303501945525
567721,4,6302994063,"Baz Luhrmann made a splash with his sparkling musical ""Moulin Rouge,"" but before that film, he made a little splash with the colorful romantic dance film ""Strictly Ballroom."" It lacks the polish of his later works, but romantics will love the ugly-duckling love story.

Scott (Paul Mercurio) shatters a ballroom dancing contest when he suddenly breaks from routine and begins dancing his own exuberant steps. His mother (Pat Thompson) is shattered, and his diva dance partner (a very made-up Gia Carides) drops him for a champion. But Scott still wants to dance his own steps, not the rigidly prescribed ballroom dances -- even if it means he won't win.

As he's dancing, plain Fran (Tara Morice) appears in the dance studio and begs Scott to take her as his partner -- she loved his dancing, and she wants to dance with him, even if they won't win. At first he refuses, but then he starts teaching her to dance at night. And despite the interference of potential partners and irate families, the two begin to fall in love -- and dance to set the floor on fire.

The story is extremely simple, so much so that at times it starts repeating itself. Okay, we have the free-spirit-learns-to-be-true-to-himself, plus an ugly-duckling-falls-for-a-swan story. But it's the execution that is charming, full of color and fire and outstanding dancing. And its simplicity keeps it from feeling rushed, although the complications late in the film seem rather contrived.

Luhrmann is known for his use of color and textured scenery, and it doesn't fail him here -- though some scenes are relatively bland, he throws in splashes of red and flashing lights, such as the giant Coke sign that flashes behind the dance partners. The ballroom competition is a spectacular opener. And the choreography is outstanding -- the actors exude sensuality and sexiness, mingled with a sort of worldly innocence.

Paul Mercurio is an okay actor, but a spectacular dancer. It's impossible to see him dance (a mix of Latin dance, Riverdance, and breakdance) without feeling a thrill. Tara Morice, with less spectacular dancing, is excellent as the plain, awkward Fran. The secondary characters like diva dancer Liz and stage mother Shirley tend to be two-dimensional. The exception is Barry Otto as Scott's dad, who dances his own wild moves when no one is watching.

""Strictly Ballroom"" is a sweet, sensuous story about being true to oneself, about love, and about how ""a life lived in fear is a life half lived."" A rough-edged gem.",1264723200,,2502,4.945238095238095

It's a light-hearted fable about letting go of fear, living your own path regardless of what others think. To be honest, I think it's the best of his ""red curtain trilogy"" (Romeo and Juliet and Mulan Rouge).

Although the storyline is fantastic, the DVD is lacking. There are no extras. It would helped had there been an interview with Baz Luhrman about this movie, or with  members of the cast, etc;.

567727,1,6302994063,"I am a ballroom dancer and I think this was a horrible movie due to the following reasons ...

Storyline is clich:
- Dance protg is bored with accepted dance moves and wants to invent his own moves
- Ugly duckling with two left feet becomes prodigy's new partner and becomes a beautiful graceful dancer

Dancing was not spectacular:
- The ""new"" moves that the protagonist does come up with is not actually new, he's just incorporating modern dance into social dance
- What little social dancing footage there is is interrupted and so we never get to see a complete dance sequence
- The social dancing that is done is expertly done but nothing worth calling home about

Costume, makeup, and hairstyles were just painful to look at:
- Too much unwarranted skin exposure (are we at the beach or on the dance floor?)
- Too gaudy (colors are loud and dissonant)
- Mohawks do no look good on women

Baz Luhrmann was not at his best in making Strictly Ballroom. You do see one good shot of the two lovers in front of a sparkling red Coca-Cola billboard and another stunning shot of the two of then dancing in front of a white curtain with pink backlighting, but other than those two shots, the rest of the cinematography was mediocre.

For a better sample of amazing work by Baz Luhrmann try Moulin Rouge or Romeo & Juliet.

567761,5,6302994063,"Strictly Ballroom made me believe in film making as a true art form. It is a celebration of colour and movement set to music. The story seamlessly weaves in the timeless themes of `one man versus the world' and `the ugly duckling'. The romance across ethnic lines adds to the spice and vigour.

You don't have to love dancing to love the movie, but after viewing it you may gain a new appreciation of dance sport as competition or perhaps art, the movie entertains both lines of thinking.

However, those who have been brought up on slick, big budget, Hollywood films might find some scenes a bit crudely cut. The humour is quirky. But herein lies its charm. In the commentary, the film makers said that a lot of their limited budget went into just a few small things, namely: the scene with the train going past, the rights to the song where they slow danced behind the curtain, and the rights to use the Coca-Cola neon sign as dance prop. Whatever, every cent was spent to perfection.

567766,4,6302994063,"Once you get past the fact that this films plot is nothing more than regurgitated clich&eacute;s you can actually enjoy the film for what it isn't; generic.  Yes, the plot may be entirely unoriginal but there is nothing formulaic about the delivery.  Baz Luhrmann has a very distinct style; one that either repulses or engages the audience.  We've seen this style manifest in his infectious take on `Romeo + Juliet' and of course in his big hit `Moulin Rouge!' but his style is working overtime in his debut film `Strictly Ballroom'.  With sporadic bursts of flare and imagery, `Strictly Ballroom' dances around the audience like a flamenco dancer on speed, and this works wonders in making this film feel fresh and new despite the fact that, when stripped of its visionary delivery, its not new at all.

The film tells the story of Scott Hastings, a championship ballroom dancer who is bucking the system by insisting on dancing his own steps instead of the standard dance steps forced on him by the dance committee.  His mother Shirley is up in arms about what to do with him.  She at one time was a famous dancer herself and lost out on her shot at gold and just wants her son to have what she never had; but his arrogance is standing in the way of her dream.  When his dance partner leaves him because of his stubbornness he finds himself training Fran, the homely girl who is just a beginner at dance, to be his partner.

The film follows that same formula of boy meets girl, girl isn't too pretty but cleans up nice, girl learns moves, boy learns humility, boy and girl have rocky patch in relationship, boy and girl reconcile, boy and girl turn heads; but it's the getting there that is so unique and refreshing.

Baz incorporates his breed of storytelling (which is something I've found a lot of in Australian cinema, they are very bright and loud and all over the place) in `Strictly Ballroom' with dynamic results.  The dancing is not as flamboyant as I would have expected (and I was rather let down by the final dance scene) but each scene is infused with enough spontaneity to make up for any lack of flare in the dancing.

The acting is very good, hilarious and heartwarming.  Paul Mercurio is excellent as Scott and Tara Morice (who looks a lot like Samantha Morton and Emily Watson) is flawless as Fran; truly captivating and endearing.  Bill Hunter and Pat Thomson are hysterical as Scott's mother and coach who are determined to see him win gold, and Barry Otto is nicely used, if a bit out of place, as Doug, Scott's father.

The script really gives the actors a lot to work with and they all put their best foot forward in making `Strictly Ballroom' a memorable and entertaining experience.  It's loud and vivacious and totally in-your-face, and this works.  If you are a fan of Luhrmann's more famed work then this is one you will want to check out.  Luhrmann has a way of taking the familiar (face it, even `Moulin Rouge!' is quite unoriginal) and making it feel all his own, as if we've never seen it before.

To be honest, you've never seen this before, at least not done this way; of that you can be sure.",1221782400,,3130,4.547237076648841
567767,3,6302994063,"I recently watched the first film in the noted Red Curtain Trilogy by Australian filmmaker Baz Luhrmann, Strictly Ballroom. This 1993 indie classic preceded its more well known and more highly budgeted siblings, Romeo + Juliet, and Moulin Rouge. While I enjoyed the twists to modernize Shakespeare in the former and the non-stop rollercoaster of the latter- and I am notoriously averse to musicals, I believe that Strictly Ballroom is probably the best of the three films, followed by Moulin Rouge and Romeo + Juliet. They are all good films, mind you, and Luhrmann is one of the most innovative filmmakers around, but there is an emotional punch that this film packs that the two later films lack- as they are more style over substance, albeit wonderful style. This is not to argue that Strictly Ballroom is flawless- it's not, but it is a prime example of a film making use of a `classic' formula, yet avoiding clich by virtue of its innovation and excellence of execution in all areas.... Yet, the film is also a wonderfully filmed piece. There are two scenes that are just gorgeously composed. Early in the film Scott and Fran are practicing on the roof of the Les Kendall (Peter Whitford) dance studio, where his parents teach, under a Coca-Cola sign, as the sun sets. Alone, the composition is wonderful, but as a version of the Cyndi Lauper hit song Time After Time plays on it is a memorable shot. Then, there is the scene, set near Fran's parents' home at a railyard, that could have been right out of Dr. Zhivago- with a rich dark blue sky, a chain link fence, and just the two characters on a barren landscape. Just beautiful. It's no wonder Luhrmann's films are all visual marvels.
  In a sense this light-hearted comedy reminded me most of the later My Big, Fat Greek Wedding in how it approached odd situations and characters and humanized them by having them funneled through experiences that moviegoers have seen too many times before with people like themselves, and it's this very dissonance of the unexpected and the expected, as well as great acting and filmmaking, that allow films like those two to succeed, where lesser films and filmmakers fail.",1221696000,3,2169,4.781333333333333

Set in Australia and directed by Baz Luhrmann, it's all about winning the Pan Pacific Grand Prix ballroom dancing competition. Besides the extraordinary dancing by the two principal actors Paul Mercurio and Tara Morice, the story is one that most of us want to believe: that in the end-- after all that's what happens in romantic comedies-- boy gets girl, ugly duckling becomes suave swan, the older generation get a chance to try things again, or at least see their broken dreams achieved by their children, and good triumphs over the cynical, bad guys.

In addition to the fine performances by Mercurio and Morice, the other actors are quite wonderful, particularly the Hasting parents. Golden hair color not found in nature and toupees abound, as does delicious humor.

Having studied ballet and many other types of dance myself since childhood, I can recognize and appreciate outstanding dancing. I would have to say this is my favorite dance movie, not just for the dancing, which is outstanding, but the whole ""package"". And you don't have to be a dancer to enjoy this film, since it's so well done and entertaining (unlike ""The Company"", a movie about a ballet company that I found tedious to watch, even though I studied ballet many years and it had beautiful dancing). This film has really outstanding dancing from Paul Mercurio and Antonio Vargas, the 2 professional dancers in the film. Just to see Paul Mercurio dance is worth watching the movie for (and what a body!). I can tell that he was trained in classical ballet since no one can move like that who was not. But he also brings a wonderful, smoldering sensuality to the screen in the love story. The love story is very touching, the performance of Tara Morice in the ugly duckling to swan role is outstanding and she dances remarkably well for a non-dancer. And then there is the satire of the competitive ballroom dancing world throughout the movie--it reminds me of the movie Best in Show satirizing the dog show world--and it's just as hilarious. Somehow all these elements--dancing, fairy tale story, satire, got mixed together perfectly to make an outstanding movie. The only part I didn't like was the cartoon-y explanation of Scott's father's career, but as the director explains, they had to do it that way due to the low budget. The finale dance (with Paul Mercurio & Tara Morice) is so exciting and well done it just gives me chills and it's also hilarious because the comedy is interspersed throughout it (happening on the sidelines).

The director's commentary on the DVD is pretty crappy and there are few special features but it's still worth getting the DVD to get the outstanding picture, color and sound quality.",1124582400,,1988,4.795918367346939
568026,5,6302994063,"This first of Baz Luhrmann's ""red curtain movies"" tells it's story through classic ballroom dance.  Set in Australia, this modern fairy tale of a movie tells the story of Scott Hastings, a young dancer from a family of dancers who is tired of ""dancing somebody else's steps all the time.""  His favorite pastime is making up his OWN steps, but that doesn't win him competitions.  When his partner finally gets fed up and drops him, he has to find a new partner.

Enter Fran.  Frumpy, shy Fran who comes from a poor Spanish neighborhood and has only been dancing for two years --- with a GIRL!

When she approaches Scott to propose they dance together, Scott's initial reaction is arrogant disbelief.  But she convinces him to give her a tryout for just an hour.  As they continue to dance, Scott sees in her something that no one else has --- and he is somehow drawn to this ugly duckling creature.  Especially when she breaks out into a step he's never seen before and he wants to try it!

As the story unfolds, Scott and Fran learn more about each other, both as dancers and as people.  Fran comes out of her shell more and more, shedding the ugly duckling persona and slowly becoming the swan she was meant to be.

And Scott finds what he's been looking for, too.  One night at a party at Fran's house, he demonstrates a Paso Doble --- the traditional Spanish dance.  Full of his usual cockiness, knowing full well how good a dancer he is, he thinks he'll wow her family with his knowledge of this dance.  When they laugh at him, he becomes indignant --- and then Fran's father shows her what a REAL Paso Doble looks like.  And Scott knows that THIS is exactly what he's been trying to find in his own dancing.

Peppered with fun characters --- including Scott's best friend and his fiancee, the corrupt chairman of the dance council, Fran's spunky grandmother and severe father, Scott's nutty mother and quiet father with his mysterious past, Ken Railings the oozing-charm-from-every-arrogant-pore professional champion, and Tina Sparkle, who Scott's parents try to get him to dance with --- this film creates a delightful and hilarious atmosphere.  The story of his father's past comes out throughout the course of the movie.  Nasty politics run rampant in the dance council.  And Scott has difficulty balancing his dance life with the romance he begins to feel with Fran.

From the very start, when the red curtain opens to the strains of ""The Blue Danube,"" I adored this movie.  And it kept me charmed until the very end.  The romance was sweet, the dancing was fun to watch --- particularly Scott and Fran's Paso Doble at the end of the film --- the music was fabulous, and the story was clean and well-thought-out.  The entire film is spiced with Luhrmann's odd, kooky style.  It's sheer delight.  I'll always have a soft spot in my heart for this movie --- it was the first time I ever considered trying to do ballroom dancing myself, this movie started my obsession with the sport!  This light-hearted romp is the perfect way to relax and laugh.",1124150400,6,3055,4.640595903165735
568027,5,6302994063,"The plot of ""Strictly Ballroom"" isn't overly complicated, but somehow its director, Baz Luhrmann, managed to make the kind of movie that leaves you smiling, and wanting to watch it again. This film doesn't give you a lot of food for thought, but it is pure unadulterated fun, and that is a lot :)

The main character is Scott (Paul Mercurio), a ballroom dancer who is tired of the steps that others taught him, and wants to dance his own steps. Due to that, and to the fact that he starts to do exactly that in a championship without talking about it with his partner, Liz (Gia Carides), she leaves him. For Liz, the matter is simple: she wants to win, and Scott's new steps aren't the way to do so. The president of the Australian Dance Federation, Barry Fife (Bill Hunter), expresses the situation quite well when he says that ""Well, of course, you can dance any steps you like! But that doesn't mean you'll...win"".

It is after that chaotic and interesting beginning to the film that the try-outs for Scott's new couple begin, the ""judges"" being his extremely emotional mother (Pat Thompson) and his ballroom dancing professor (Peter Whitford), both professional ballroom dancers in the past. Unknown to them, though, Scott discovers in Fran (Tara Morice), a frequently overlooked woman who is merely a beginner with lots of spunk, the person who he wants to dance with, even if he has to teach her himself. After all, Fran's motto, ""A life lived in fear is a life half lived"", goes well with Scott's philosophy that is dancing that matters, not winning.

All in all, I can sincerely say that I loved this movie, and that I deeply regret missing it in 1992, when it was released... Truth to be told, ""Strictly ballroom"" isn't overly popular here in Argentina, and it is rather difficult to find a copy to rent. Fortunately, and thanks to the recommendation of a friend and a new videostore, I could watch it today. I enjoyed the story, the music and the great performances given by the actors, as well as the wonderful ending that allowed me to keep on smiling after a while even after finishing the movie. Of course, I highly recommend this movie to you!.

568029,5,6302994063,"This Australian gem is one of those rare films that entertains, thrills and pokes fun at an established activiity (in this case, a ballroom dance federation).

To take this film seriously is to miss out on one of the great moviegoing/ moviewatching experiences of the 1990s.

In a nutshell, an up-and-coming champion ballroom dancer gets bored dancing the same tired steps that everyone has danced in competition the past 50 years and wants to break out and do things his way.  Of course, his way is the better way, but that causes all the angst, high drama, dashed hopes and utter hilarity that ensues as forces clash to prevent the young man from taking the ballroom dancing world by storm and up to a new level.

Of course, it's what we've all, always, expected:  Things don't change in such events because those who judge and teach can only judge/teach that with which they are familiar.

The cast is perfect, from the dashing young lead embodied by Australian ballet principal Paul Mercurio to the shy, at-first clumsy female lead played by Tara Morice (who also lends her vocals to Cyndi Lauper's ""Time After Time"" in a stunning rooftop pas de deux as she starts learning how to dance with him).

Paul's mother -- beautifully and hysterically portrayed by Pat Thomson -- and his seemingly introverted, odd father -- a wonderfully giddy Barry Otto -- are perfectly realized, as are all the other roles, including Bill Hunter's terrifically change-resistant Barry Fife, president of the dance federation.

This is probably Baz Luhrmann's most mainstream movie, since it's more firmly grounded in the now than anything else he's done.

Be on the lookout for a stunning cinematic moment during an outdoor sequence at the girl's house with the lead learning from her father how to correctly dance the Paso Dobles.  When it's clear he's gotten the hang of it, the camera does a closeup on him turning and then cuts to an oncoming train, that parallels the house, sweeping down the lower right of the screen.  It's one of those Luhrmann touches that set him apart from most other working directors.

""Strictly Ballroom"" is a wonderful entertainment that flows along so quickly..and has dramatic highs...and even more thrilling dancing highs...that most of you will be very sorry when it's over.

But through the eyes of Baz Luhrmann, the most ordinary tale can be turned on its ear. The filming is wonderful, vivid, sumptuous. The characters are hardly real, but instead tongue-in-cheek characatures of ballroom dancing society. Its like watching a circus, a bit like ""Moulin Rouge,"" but with a more quirky, dry sense of humor that is unique to the Australians. Paul Mercurio may not be the best actor, but his dancing is divine, Tara Morice is a wonderfully endearing nerd, and Barry Otto as Scott's father is perfectly wonderful. I laughed so hard I cried.

568113,4,6302994063,"Baz Luhrmann made a splash with his sparkling musical ""Moulin Rouge,"" but before that film, he made a little splash with the colorful romantic dance film ""Strictly Ballroom."" It lacks the polish of his later works, but romantics will love the ugly-duckling love story.

Scott (Paul Mercurio) shatters a ballroom dancing contest when he suddenly breaks from routine and begins dancing his own exuberant steps. His mother (Pat Thompson) is shattered, and his diva dance partner (a very made-up Gia Carides) drops him for a champion. But Scott still wants to dance his own steps, not the rigidly prescribed ballroom dances -- even if it means he won't win.

As he's dancing, plain Fran (Tara Morice) appears in the dance studio and begs Scott to take her as his partner -- she loved his dancing, and she wants to dance with him, even if they won't win. At first he refuses, but then he starts teaching her to dance at night. And despite the interference of potential partners and irate families, the two begin to fall in love -- and dance to set the floor on fire.

The story is extremely simple, so much so that at times it starts repeating itself. Okay, we have the free-spirit-learns-to-be-true-to-himself, plus an ugly-duckling-falls-for-a-swan story. But it's the execution that is charming, full of color and fire and outstanding dancing. And its simplicity keeps it from feeling rushed, although the complications late in the film seem rather contrived.

Luhrmann is known for his use of color and textured scenery, and it doesn't fail him here -- though some scenes are relatively bland, he throws in splashes of red and flashing lights, such as the giant Coke sign that flashes behind the dance partners. The ballroom competition is a spectacular opener. And the choreography is outstanding -- the actors exude sensuality and sexiness, mingled with a sort of worldly innocence.

Paul Mercurio is an okay actor, but a spectacular dancer. It's impossible to see him dance (a mix of Latin dance, Riverdance, and breakdance) without feeling a thrill. Tara Morice, with less spectacular dancing, is excellent as the plain, awkward Fran. The secondary characters like diva dancer Liz and stage mother Shirley tend to be two-dimensional. The exception is Barry Otto as Scott's dad, who dances his own wild moves when no one is watching.

""Strictly Ballroom"" is a sweet, sensuous story about being true to oneself, about love, and about how ""a life lived in fear is a life half lived."" A rough-edged gem.",1093305600,8,2502,4.945238095238095
568114,3,6302994063,"I've never really been a great fan of Baz Luhrmann's. Moulin Rouge was also a 3 out of 5 rating, in my opinion. I think it must be his style of cinematography - its neither theatre nor film, its halfway in-between... but I'm like this : If I watch a film I want to see a film, and if I want to watch a musical, I go to the theatre. Still, I gave this a shot after reading lots of glimmering reviews about it here. What I can say is this : the dancing was spectacular, and I love dancing, so that was why I gave this movie 3 stars. Apart from that, its just a run-of-the-mill love story... The lush prop sets and costumes might be a main attraction for some who loved this film enough to give it 5 out of 5, but I tend to look for something original and a bit different in a movie, and this just wasn't it.",1085097600,2,805,3.9146341463414633
568115,5,6302994063,"When I started dance classes in 1992, I was probably one of the gawkiest, most unconfident little dancers you would have ever seen......chubby, shy, not very well-coordinated.  You know how tough it can be to be ten years old!  Anyway, the year was 1993, and I went to see a film called STRICTLY BALLROOM, that had just been released at a local art house movie house.  Not many people had even heard of it, let alone of the director, Baz Luhrmann.  It was a small film about ballroom dancing, of all things...and a comedy!  All I knew was I always enjoyed watching ballroom dancing on PBS, and dreamed about being slender, graceful and perfectly tan!  Just like all of those competitive dancers I saw.  This film was probably one of the best tonics I needed.  The storyline is about Scott Hastings (Paul Mercurio), a young man who has grown up with the dancing gene ever since he could remember.  He even started competing in ballroom (modern and latin) since the age of six.  He truly had the ultimate ""stage mother"" mum forcing him to stick to the moves (and the partners) that will get him the ultimate in coveted honors in the Ballroom dancing community--first prize at the PAN PACIFICS.  His partners are all the same: blonde, busty and bossy.  Also, divas with a capital ""D.""  Scott upsets and shocks the ballroom dance community with his ""crowd pleasing"" steps during one of the performances, which leads to an immediate and messy break-up between him and his current partner, Liz (Gia Carides).  Scott does not want to give up on his original footwork, and stubbornly practices his spins, jumps and twirls, completely unaware that Fran (Tara Morice), the beginning dancer and ultimate ""ugly duckling"" from his mother's dancing studio is watching him in admiration.  Fran longs to break free of the ""beginning dancers"" mold, and team up with someone like Scott who has the guts to challenge the authority of the traditional dance steps drilled into him through years of rigourous training.  She also has some spicy moves of her own--being of Spanish extraction, with a background in flamenco.
This film is a real confidence booster for anyone who felt awkward on the dance floor.  It is also great fun for people who need an attitude booster, and want to see a really wonderfully crafted, quirky, low-budget Aussie comedy.  This debut by Baz Luhrmann is delightfully unaffected, and beautifully done.  Guaranteed to have you dancing in the aisles...and, in spite of what you might think, this has the potential to be a great date film.  That's right, fellas....though it has ""chick flick"" written all over it in the title alone, you might find yourself having fun, too!

568156,5,6302994063,"Call it a ""chick flick"" if you want, but not within earshot of my dad or my husband. ""Strictly Ballroom"" is one of my father's top-ten favorite movies, and he's no pansy. He's a WWII vet, a retired commercial fisherman, a mechanical type who can fix anything -- pretty much a Man's Man in every way. My aviation-buff husband is another one who loves this movie, and he's a guy who'd rather get a root canal than watch a sappy romance.
We found the movie by accident. We'd planned to see an action flick, but it was unexpectedly sold out. Since we were already at the multi-plex, we figured we'd watch ""Strictly Ballroom"" because it was about to start (the sexy babe on the movie poster helped convince my husband that it might be worth a shot). This was in Burbank, California, where half the members of any given audience make a living in the film industry. As such, they're pretty jaded. Yet they nearly shrieked with laughter at the movie's maverick humor, and as ""Rumba del Burro"" played over the closing credits, the entire audience LITERALLY danced out of the theater after a long round of applause. It was the damndest thing we've ever seen.
Later, I bought the video and shared it with family and friends. Most of them raved about the movie so much that I ended up buying probably half a dozen copies for gifts. What's really amazing about the story is that it is 100 percent formula clich - yet it breaks all the molds. It's sexy and sensuous without being promiscuous. It's ribald without the use of profanity. It's the kind of movie you can watch with your little kids, teenagers, your parents, and your grandparents, all at the same time - there are plenty of laughs for every generation, including ""adult"" humor that gently soars over the heads of children.
The moral of my story: DO NOT believe those who tell you this is a just another ""woman's movie."" The argument could be made that it's actually a man's movie, since the fathers of the two main characters turn out to be the real heroes. In an era where pop culture makes men out to be buffoons, ""Strictly Ballroom"" is mighty refreshing. WATCH IT.",1077062400,15,2115,4.553805774278215

While this is not a 'masterpiece' as 'Moulin Rouge', it is definately VERY good. The acting was stupendous. The actors made me feel that the story was very real. In a very 'slight' way, I was reminicant of 'Dirty Dancing'.
Scott is this Awesome ballroom dancer who does not adhere to 'Strictly Ballroom' rules. He loses a major competition due to his unorthodox dance moves. His overly dramatic dance partner dumps him right before another major competition, and poor Scott is left partnerless. In appears an extremely 'ugly duckling' who wants to dance with him. What happens next is ..... well, I guess you should watch it to know the rest.

Stays with you well after the movie. Even as I type, ""Perhaps"" and ""Rhumba De Burros"" are fluttering thru my head.

568159,5,6302994063,"OK, there's been the athletic drama genre done before, right?  The one with the championship finals being the climactic scene?  American Anthem for gymnastics, American Flyers for cycling, and Cutting Edge for skating, to name a few.  Well, right on the one, down on the two, left on the three, up on the four, for Strictly Ballroom takes on the ballroom dancing, as popular in Australia as kangaroos and shrimps on the barbie.
Much admired by his peers, family, and members of the ballroom dancing establishment, Scott Hastings is seen as the next big champion of the prestigious Pan Pacific Championship.  His form is superlative, but he's driven by the need to do some crowd-pleasing steps that don't conform to the samba, rhumba, or whatever dance.  As Barry Fife, president of the Australian Dance Federation says, ""you can dance anything you like.  That doesn't mean you win.""  Which Scott doesn't, to the fury of his partner, Liz Holt, who ends their partnership.  Scott though, is ""sick of doing somebody else's steps all the time.""
His dance coach, Les Kendall, owner of the dance academy, his overcontrolling mother, and Barry Fife, i.e. the establishment, want him to toe the line.  His bespectacled and thin father, Doug, isn't that assertive about it, seeming inconspicuous and insignificant, but there are some things about him that don't meet the eye.
Fran, a not-too-pretty beginner in the dance class, boldly asks Scott to be his partner for the Pan Pacifics and to dance his way, gutsy as no beginner has the right to approach an open amateur like that.  Fran persists, and as she and Scott practice together, the time lapse shows Fran blossoming, wearing her hair down, her hair turning a lovely dark brown, and we learn she is Portuguese.  The lovely cover of Cyndi Lauper's ""Time After Time"" in these sequences is sung by Mark Williams and Tara Morice, who plays Fran.  This song really takes a nice romantic edge with its softer production.  The pair later get dancing instructions from Fran's father, who at first looks intimidating, but takes to Scott.
However, look at the title, strictly ballroom.  This means rigid conformity with the steps associated with the dance, no fancy steps, which can add life to any old dance.  And there's the cheesy glitz associated, as the corrupt president wants to fix Scott up with Tina Sparkle, a sizzling shallow blonde with a nice fruit costume motif.  After all, ""a Pan Pacific champion becomes a hero, a guiding light to all dancers, someone who'll set the right example.""  Translation:  a conformist.
Some of the characters who are louder and more garish are annoying, such as Scott's shrewish mother and Liz.  It's characters like Scott, Fran, and Doug who are winning characters, as is Les, who sees potential in Scott:  ""You've got a light in you boy.  Let it shine.""
When I first saw this in 1994, I had no idea it was directed by Baz Luhrman, known for the notoriously splashy and overdone Moulin Rouge.  As it is, Strictly Ballroom is glitzy but not overdone, with the dancing sequences and costumes topnotch.
It may take two to tango, but the tango isn't the only dance, people.  And if you don't want to tango, do the paso doble instead.",1069891200,18,3211,4.829981718464351

I was a recently divorced single parent of two, struggling with a house note and bills I couldn't pay. On this particular day, I was fighting a bad cold, and feeling generally tired and unhappy.  I took this movie out based only on the ""Two Thumbs Up"" recommendation of Siskel & Ebert at the bottom of the case.  After viewing this film, I felt energized and full of good humor.  I eventually bought it and have shared it with my mom, sister, kids, friends, and new husband.  They all loved it!  Where do I start? 1. The performances.  Everyone in this movie is wonderful.  They are believable and credible even though the material is completely over the top so much of the time.  I love these people.  2. Then there's the romance.  The main love story is very sweet, but all throughout the film, you feel like romance is literally in the air.  It's also amazing how much sensuality is conveyed without any overt sexuality.  3.  The dancing. I never gave ballroom dancing a thought until I saw this movie.  Now, I love watching it.  4.  The family relationships.  They may seem unbelievable, but that mother is all too familiar to me.  5.  Paul Mercurio--he's hot! Enough said.

568227,4,6302994063,"I was lured into 'Strictly Ballroom' by an 'indie-phile' friend of mine, and I was certain it was going to be one long boring Ingmar Bergman film of crane shots, brimming with double meaning and intellectual purpose. But the film opens documentary-style, with ballroom queen Pat Thompson so distraught over her son's improvisational dance steps she actually breaks down in sobs saying, ""I keep asking myself why? Where did I go wrong as a mother?!!"" I've never laughed so hard five minutes into a movie in my life. From that moment on the film is a marvelous, slightly over-the-top, ode to the art and serious business of professional ballroom dancing (a form of entertainment I admit I was only aware of from the biannual PBS specials hosted by Ron Montez and the late great Juliet Prowse). But director Baz Luhrmann (whom I think went a bit too MTV for the film 'Moulin Rouge') gets the balance of comedy and Hollywood musical spoof just right here. The film goes from mock-docudrama to a charming, hotheaded-boy-meets-shy-awkward-girl story flawlessly, and even though there are sizable cliches' throughout the film (awkward girl is ostracized by society for no apparent reason; all accomplished dancers seem to be sprayed with a layer of tanning lacquer and gunite), the film nips each one of them in the bud quickly, and you end up not minding the swan-like transformation of leading lady Tara Morice. (Her casting in the film is inspired as she is not a conventional Hollywood 'hottie,' but uniquely beautiful just the same.) The dancing is marvelous, especially the final 'paso doble' with Morice and Paul Mercurio (who seems to be channeling Jose Greco and Bob Fosse).

568228,5,6302994063,"Once in a blue moon, a crowd pleaser comes along that soars the spirit. ""Strictly Ballroom"" is one of those movies.
Directed in a delicious high-key style by Baz Luhrmann (WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE'S ROMEO + JULIET, MOULIN ROUGE) in his madcap debut (the first in what would be called the Red Curtain Trilogy), the film tells the story of a top ballroom dancer who pairs with a plain, left-footed ugly duckling, when his maverick style earns him the disdain of his more conventionally-minded colleagues. Together, they give it their all and aim to make dreams of the National Championship title come true.

To say this film is amazing would be an understatement. It is one of the most gloriously entertaining and awe-inducing films ever made. The cast is simply magnificant and Luhrmann introduces his clever, fast-paced directing and editing style here. He brilliantly uses a documentary style opening and ocassional interludes which help better understand the lovable characters. It works wonderfully!

This is definitely the feel-good movie of the decade. It's hypnotic, strange, and deeply heartfelt--a deliciously entertaining crowd-pleaser. A highly recommended must!",1050105600,11,1167,5.406593406593407
568229,5,6302994063,"One of my favorite films is STRICTLY BALLROOM.  The 1992 sleeper hit directed by Baz Luhrman is a gem. This was Luhrman's first feature film as director before going on to direct the hugely popular ""Romeo + Juliet"" and ""Moulin Rouge.""
Luhrmann cleverly uses a documentary style opening and interludes which pull you into the film and make you quickly form bonds with the loveable characters on the way. The storyline follows Scott Hastings (Paul Mercurio), one of Australia's great hopes in the competitive world of ballroom dancing. Surrounded by dance, Scott's parents own a small dancing school, those around him live for the dream that Scott will win the Pan Pacific Championship trophy with dancing partner Liz (Gia Carides.) Surely the most enthusiastic for Scott to achieve ballroom greatness is his mother Shirley, a former dance champion herself, who's iron determination and fraught ambition fills the air with tension, very much the antithesis of her husband Doug who is timid and all but mute.  The road to starlight stardom is rocky for Scott who's passion for dance and natural talent means he wants to escape the strict rigours of the ballroom rules. Scott wants to dance his own steps - Scott is a rumba rebel. As those around him panic that he will be too individual for the rule-bound ballroom world, his chances of success seem distant as his regular dance partner leaves. There only seems to be one person who believes in Scott's vision, Fran the ugly-duckling dance pupil.  Fran's own love of dancing is equally as perplexing to her family. From a traditional Spanish family with strong dancing bonds they will not accept that ballroom is anything more than mickey mouse dancing, a mutilated form of 'real' movement.
Ballroom dancing, a pastime that is ridiculed by many may not seem the obvious choice for a feature film, but ""Strictly Ballroom"" elevates it status to a new level.  One of humor and admiration. The film takes the sequins and dusts them with glitter. The dresses are flouncy, the hair is bleached and the tans are permaglow but it is done with such affection, such humor you know the director actually has the upmost respect for this dazzling community and takes that admiration and transforms the film into a small masterpiece.

Without doubt Paul Mercurio (Scott Hastings) has a wonderful and brooding presence throughout the film. Possibly not since John Travolta in Saturday Night Fever has a dancing man on screen set the heart fluttering as much.  Remarkably graceful, manly and sexy - here's a leading man you want to literally sweep you off your feet. He comes across with great passion. Tara Morice as Fran also turns in a superb performance. Thanks to careful direction and use of costume and make-up her transformation from ugly-duckling is not as crude as in so many other films, there's no stereotyped secretary with a bun and glasses scenario here. The whole character of Fran revolves around subtlety and growth with Morice brings across very well.  The supporting cast all deserve credit especially Scott's parents, Shirley played by Pat Thompson (Strictly Ballroom was her last film before her death) and Doug played by Barry Otto.  ntonio Vargas stars as Fran's father Rico and in reality is a well respected Flamenco dancer and actually worked as the dance trainer on the film.
Films rarely come more feelgood than this. It is as happy and loud as the dancers sequined dresses. It is pure glitter on a the screen and a film to lift the spirits.  Highly recommended!",1047600000,6,3522,4.915824915824916
568230,5,6302994063,"This is a wonderful, beautiful movie  it is a little mixed, but it all works, with the flat, cartoonish elements which Baz seems to prefer, conquered by the elements of actual drama and dance.
Paul Mercurio dances very well, and he carries off a variety of routines;  he manages the ballroom dancing fine, even though he is more a modern dancer by training;  of course, his solo which is interrupted by Frans approaching him, and steeling her nerves to ask him to dance with her;  the laughable pseudo-Paso Doble which excites such mirth;  and the flamenco-in-training with Antonio Vargas.  Tara Morice and Mercurio are a terrific couple, and she does so well with the dancing, few would ever suspect that she was not herself actually a dancer.  Vargas is fantastic.  And crucially for the movie, Mercurio, Morice, Vargas and Armonia Benedito form the emotional heart of the movie, and they carry it off brilliantly.  The unsung genius of the movie, for he serves as a crucial pivot between this, the human element of the story, and the cartoonish Baz element (the comic-book caricatures which are Barry Fife, Les Kendall and Mrs Hastings), is Barry Otto as Doug Hastings  within the confines of caricatureville he is an object of scorn and contempt, and meekly escapes into his own dreams in a number of shadowy solo dance scenes (and impressively plastic in his movements, too).  Otto comes close to stealing the scene when his insistence on bending Scotts ear dispels the fog of Barry Fifes manipulative deceptions, at the last instant, when Scott and Liz were just about to go out to the dance floor for the Latin Finals  and when his clapping conquers the Un-Music when Fife has pulled The Plug ....
This is a fabulous movie, with some exhilarating dancing, and a great deal of charm.  Indeed, it is a great movie, in spite of Baz Luhrmann.
The more we have seen of Bazs work since Strictly Ballroom, with his juvenile obsessions with breasts and sex, the color-blind dependence on gaudy extremes which we are invited to interpret as fresh vision, the low-budget high concept which The Blazoned Motto is supposed to represent  the wonder is, that Strictly Ballroom succeeds so marvelously well.  The answer to this puzzle must lie in the fact that Baz was but a co-writer, and but a co-director of SB  so that the other party must have been the artistically responsible half, who made sure that SB rose above Bazs conceptual limitations.  Whenever we see something more recent by Baz, and gag at its shallowness, we come back to SB, and we wonder that he managed to get THIS movie so perfectly right.
Five stars, though you won't need to bother with the Baz-ly commentary, which is about 2% genuinely interesting information about the making of the movie, and 98% empty, self-flattering Baz-chat.",1047254400,2,2801,4.826359832635983

What is SO liberating is how each character grows from their willingness to take a chance and how even the weak characters, terrified of change, find themselves redeemed and enlarged--beginning principally with Fran's courage enabling Scott to stop being a ""selfish"" dancer.

The film itself is full of dynamics and energy, with swift scene leaping, sometimes very casual camera work that gives you a documentary kind of feeling. Paul Mercurio, who plays the dancer Scott, is a brilliant dancer as well as a fiery actor, and Fran, Scott's dancing partner, is naturally acted by Tara Morice, who, with no short of passion in her dancing with Paul Mercurio, brings poetic beauty and realness to the character. There are wonderful songs and dances through out the film. It's entertaining, it's funny, and more or less, it makes you think about your own life. ""A life lived in fear is a life half lived"" is the essence of the movie, which I believe is also the motto that guides Baz Lurhmann in his artistic creation. For many years, one after another, he has brought out brilliant works - stage or screen - with freshness and creativity. As much as I respect the traditions, I admire the courage to challenge the traditions. Ballroom dancing can be dull without the occasionally-popped-out rule-breaker like Scott, and so is the realm of art without the genius like Baz Lurhmann.",1045612800,4,1411,4.858921161825726

The cover looked so racy that we just passed it by wanting to see it first, before wasting our money on another sleazy canned dancing movie. (Had we seen Romeo and Juliet or Moulin Rouge first, we probably would never have looked twice at it).
After renting a copy and seeing it, we were so thrilled that we raced down to the store to grab the copy for sale, but it was gone.
The very beginning of this movie is fresh, new, and brilliantly put together.  The humor in the movie has the zaniness of British humor with the hard edged Aussie flair.  From the very first few minutes, we found ourselves laughing, clapping, and feeling overall wonderful about the beautifully done story that many can relate to.
A struggling ""invisible girl"" rather ignored and looked down upon takes a risk and ends up with the self-confident hero.  The costuming is gorgeous, the dance scenes beautiful, and the characters are PERFECTLY done - very different and lots of fun.
This movie is certainly a family movie-despite the racy cover.  What we particularly loved about this movie was that FRAN, the lead character ended up on top, but did not have to become a sleaze to do it.  She keeps her modesty and class and still comes out ahead.  The movie is pretty wholesomely done (be warned that there are a few swear words and one implied scene with a few characters-however very tame).
Dance scenes are not like so many other dance movies which are rather annoying.  On the contrary, they make you feel like you are involved.  All kinds of people, with all kinds of abilities dance in the movie- not just the stars.
I watch this movie several times a year, as does my mom who hesitated to buy a copy when I told her about it.  It is reminiscent of quirky Hyacinth Bucket character types (from BBC'c KEEPING UP APPEARANCES) with many new originals added.
This Aussie film is not only a delight, but the characters are believable, and many who we know find themselves watching it over and over again- greatly brightens one's mood.  I'm purchasing the DVD soon to replace the video, now worn.
SIDE NOTE:  I find it rather interesting that Paul Mercurio, who is a definite delight as the male lead and extremely appealing, does not like this film and wants to distance himself from the whole dancing thing (although he danced for some time before his role in the movie).  It is too bad, because this movie is one of the best movies of all time.  A TRUE CLASSIC.",1041724800,,2563,4.531453362255966

But one night while channel surfing and nursing a broken heart, I saw an advertisement saying 'Strictly Ballroom' would be on next. I am also a person who disliked 'Moulin Rouge' and I knew that this was a Baz Luhrmann film. But I decided to watch it anyway. And from the minute it began I was captivated by its dazzling visuals, amazing dance sequences and sweet, if predictable, plot. Hey, I needed a nice romance. The story revolves around potential star ballroom dancer Scott Hastings, who ruins his chance at gold by dancing his own original steps during a performance. His extremely upset partner refuses to ever dance with him again, leaving Scott without a partner to dance at the big Pan Pacifics competition. But his chance comes in an unlikely package, an ugly duckling of sorts named Fran, a beginning dancer. Against all odds, they form a talented duo. I won't say what happens at the end, but it definately left this viewer happy. An Australian off-the-wall delight, this will definately please you if you like Baz Luhrmann or dancing movies (I see this as 'Dirty Dancing' without the annoying actors and convulted plot). And if you don't like either (I didn't), if you enjoy romances or Australian cinema,it's a must see. So get on your dancing shoes, sit back, and enjoy.",1034467200,7,1365,4.7154811715481175

568286,5,6302994063,"I was surprised that the editorial reviews of this film treat it like just another film, which it most definitely IS NOT. I would describe it in various ways: as the film John Waters would give his left HAND to make; as a terrific NEAR-sendup of intense, tear-drenched dramatic dance films like Red Shoes, that doffs its hat to the concept of ""camp"" without throwing the whole experience away just to stay consistent with the attitude; as a comedy that, if you get the joke, will knock you silly with laughter at times.
There are moments when I wasn't sure which film I was in, as the plot listed toward Flashdance and then Cinderella. But this is the kind of film it is; it embraces operatic emotion and high melodrama, and while it acknowledges the ordinary, it never becomes so. And it communicates beautifully the essential wackiness of all in-bred, inclusive subcultures. (The old guard's constant exhortations to the hero not to give himself over to ""crowd-pleasing moves"" is hilariously absurd, and at the same time wholly typical of such subcultures, where the most sensible question is always ""Who on earth made these up these rules?!"")
It is an odd and intense film, one that contantly keeps you off balance, and asking yourself whether to take it seriously or as an elaborate sort of filmed comedy dream (think of Rocky Horror Picture Show). The cool thing is, you never have to decide; you can enjoy new aspects of it on multiple viewings. See it.",1026259200,4,1459,4.748031496062992

There have been a couple of brilliant reviews that analyze why this movie works on several levels.  I am a simple viewer of off-beat films, and I admit to liking dance movies (one early favorite being CARMEN).
This particular film was not based on any particular myth or opera;  it was perhaps a slight send-up of the typical mass-market romance published by Harlequin or Mills & Boons some decades back (the ones where the plain Jane always got her man).  It was also a telling commentary on dance competitions, perhaps, conveying to me at least how frenetic the rivalries can be and how crazy the judging can be. [This is probably no surprise to most of us who follow ice-skating either!]
The story is a relatively simple one at the very basic level - a young dancer tries to dance the way he wants, and he finds that his partner has abandoned him.  In searching for a new partner, he finds a newcomer who wants to dance with him.  When push comes to shove (i.e. when he is offered a chance to dance with a seasoned competitor), he drops this new partner and then changes his mind again and again.  That's about it.
Except that that really doesn't do justice to the sly asides in this film, the sense of mystery about the heroine (and who she really is), and the power of the dances.  One of the highlights was the couple learning to dance together on the roof of the dance studio against a commercial billboard as a backdrop.  Another was the magnificent paso doble routine with the heroine's father where the hero is cut down to size.
Ah yes.  I forgot to mention that the hero is not only interested in trying out new steps and challenging the rules of the game, but he is also a rather selfish dancer.  He does not think about his partner.  This is a point made by his former dancer as well as his new partner and her family.  To dance really really well, he must learn to share the dance with his partner, to dance only those moves that enhance the whole experience visually and emotionally for them both.
There is the comic aspect that I have mentioned, although I would call it more tragi-comic.  The hero's parents have dedicated their lives to dance, but their shared passion has affected them negatively.  There are plenty of secrets, some sleazy and others simply pathetic.  There is one major villain, of course.  There is the hilarious send up of the dance competition world.
Everyone who has watched this movie seems to be charmed by it.  The director went on to bigger (and perhaps better things) but this is a movie worth picking up, rental or purchase.  I understand that the DVD extras are a slight disappointment, but don't let that stop you.",1024963200,,2835,4.457364341085271
568338,5,6302994063,"This is a real magical experience movie. A one of a kind experience! It is not just about dancing, but about personal growth and transformation through love. It is a love story most of all. In this high-energy movie, a young woman who looks rather homely helps the lead actor dance his own steps at the Grand Nationals. He wants to dance his own way and not follow the very tight rules of Ballroom dancing. Everyone thought he was crazy to dance his own steps, except this woman. When she approached him to offer her help at first he thought she was joking because he was a professional and she was merely a beginner. She told him he is afraid and that caught his attention. Her moto, and the moto of this film is: ""A life lived in fear is a life half lived."" It is a true metaphor for life and in breaking out of the mold setup for us by society and everyone else. With risk taking and following our hearts, we find something deeper and more beautiful then we ever imagined. She shows him some Latin movies he really likes and slowly they learned to dance their own way that was truly beautiful and much different then traditional Ballroom dancing.
As they danced together, little by little, the woman transformed into a true beauty. Her believing in him and herself caused her to become more then what she was. There was so much pressure on this young man to succeed and follow the rules that he almost gave in, but her love changed everything. The walls came down at the Grand Nationals and they danced their way- a beautiful elegant, simple Latin dance that had the audience jumping out of their seats in awe. In the end everyone joined in and it was an amazing thing to see! I find this movie to be a very good psychological lesson of following your heart, to stop living in fear even though everyone and everything seems to be against what you know in your heart to be right for you. And by breaking the rules, amazing things can happen for not just you, but the whole society as well. A truly amazing movie with a beautiful message.

568339,4,6302994063,"This is actually my favourite of Baz Luhrman's films, closely followed by Moulin Rouge and miles ahead of Romeo and Juliet.  The story is simple and predictable, but that only adds to its charm, rather than detracting from it.  The joy of this film comes from all the little moments, like Scott and Fran's father dancing beside the railway track, or flashback's to Scott's parents careers.  The sets and costumes are great, and in many ways this film is a kind of prequel, or companion piece to Moulin Rouge.  The performers are for the most part dancers before they are actors, but they are all perfectly competant.  The dance numbers really make the movie with wonderful music, slow motion, and slightly less frenetic editing than Luhrman's other movies.  The great, funny, romantic, sweet movie, to enjoy time and again.",1023062400,2,823,4.884892086330935
568340,5,6302994063,"The story is very simple.  It's about a champion ballroom dancer who has always wanted to dance his own unconventional steps.  Doing so, however, he might please the crowd, but not the judges.  Three weeks before the Pan Pacific competition, Scott Hastings (the protagonist) has a falling out with his partner for this reason.  Little does he know that by teaching a beginner to dance the way he wants to dance, his world would be turned upside down.  At the core, this is a lovestory between Scott and his ""ugly-duckling"" student Fran (short for Francesca).
The choreography is nothing short of stunning.  The dancing is an integral part of the movie.  It tells part of the story.  The protagonist ends up learning a new style of dancing called Para Dos (Spanish for ""for two"") as he reaches a point in the story where he realizes that his life is not to be lived alone anymore; when he finds love.
This film catapulted Baz Luhrmann's career.  He eventually followed up with films like Romeo and Juliet and Moulin Rouge, incorporating a similar style of audacious characters with love songs from the 80s.  Another reason why I like his films is for the humor.  You leave feeling cheerful.  I guess I'm still a kid at heart, and I like my stories to end ""... and they lived happily ever after.""

As is evident with three of his big films, Romeo and Juliet, Moulin Rouge, and this one, Strictly Ballroom, he has a true talent for making great films. I love to ballroom dance, and i could relate with much of what was in the film. also, the documentary included in the DVD, ""slow samba to foxtrot"" is excellent. it's great to see ballroom dancing appreciated by many people around the world. Also, for those who like ballroom dancing films, check out Shall We Dance?, a great ballroom dance film out of Japan. that one is also a classic!",1022025600,2,596,4.477064220183486
568342,5,6302994063,"The story is pretty conventional : since childhood Scott Hastings' parents have pointed him towards the Pan-Pacific Grand Prix Amateur
Championships.  But in direct contravention of the rules and traditions of ballroom dancing (which have as much to do with the teaching of dance to
willing customers as with dance itself), Scott has recently developed a dangerous desire to dance his own ""crowd-pleasing steps"".  When Scott's
partner leaves him, he's forced to audition new ones, none of whom are very satisfactory, until, improbably, the homely and awkward Fran, who
usually has to dance with another girl, demonstrates that she understands what he's aiming at.  As Scott's mother and teacher try to find a more
acceptable alternative, Scott and Fran practice in secret, eventually receiving assistance from Fran's aforementioned father and her loving
grandmother, who does a mean rumba herself.
What follows is largely predictable but still endearingly romantic and exciting.  Baz Luhrmann, who had directed a stage version of the story for some
ten years before turning it into a movie, brings a pulsing energy (which mixes soundtrack, color, and motion in fascinating ways) and an off-kilter
sense of humor to the film that make it quite distinctive.  If you liked Mr. Luhrmann's Moulin Rouge but thought it was a bit over-the-top, you'll like
this one much better.
The best aspect of the film though is the way in which Scott, who when we meet him is totally self-absorbed, has to learn that for all his desire to
express himself in dance, he must do so together with his partner.  He and Fran must communicate with one another, share themselves, and be able to
yield something of the personal in order to be true to their art.  They must respect the conventions of ballroom dance, with its basis in the couple,
even as they expand its possibilities and violate the self-serving diktats of the corrupt elders who run the competitions.  So much of modern art and
literature celebrates egotistical individualism unfettered by any restraint; it's unusual to find such a compelling story about the requirement of
submerging purely selfish concerns in order to achieve higher purposes.
One of the leitmotifs of the film is that ""A life lived in fear is a life half-lived"".  Much of the atomization of modern life is a function of fear, a fear of
being hurt by those we open up to.  Scott begins the film as only half of a couple, unable to share anything, even a dance, with his partner.  He is
living only a half-life.  But he becomes wholly human, begins to live a whole life, when he becomes a true partner with Fran.  It's rare enough to see
such profound truth portrayed in film, but that it's done here such a joyous and exuberant fashion makes this a remarkable movie.

While the storyline is predictable, the actors' performances are authentic and compelling, especially the relationship between Paul Mercurio and Tara Morice. They have real on-screen chemistry: there is a believable sense of romantic and sexual tension that fuels their desire to win the Pan-Pacific Dance Championship.
Obviously Baz Luhrmann loves using lots of saturated color and exaggerated but authentic costumes to bring the world of ballroom dancing to life for those of us unfamiliar with its rituals and triumphs. The dance sequences have to be seen: they are nothing less than incredible!
The interactions between the characters is often outright hilarious, and at times poignant. A very enjoyable and touching story--like a fairy tale infused with lots of energy and zest for living.

In 2001 I was bowled over by ""Moulin Rouge"", but when I saw it, though I knew both movies were directed by Baz Luhrmann, much of ""Strictly Ballroom"" had faded from memory. Recently, I saw it again, and realized how very much it foreshadows its big, bold cousin. It stands on its own merits, but now it also looks strikingly like the genesis of ""Moulin Rouge"". There is also an irony. The main character is denounced and ridiculed by some of the movie's characters for the excesses and the flamboyance he uses in his work. Nine years later, Luhrmann endured the same criticisms for his directing style in ""Moulin Rouge"".
This is a comedy about a young man [Paul Mercurio] who grows up in the bizarre, insular world of Australian ballroom dance competitions. He's a marvelous dancer with a tendency to introduce his own steps. He wants to break the strict rules that have grown up in the competitions over the years. Thought a twist of fate, he finds a partner [Tara Morice] who also has a spirited and rebellious nature. Their battle to free up their little dancing world makes for a sweet, eccentric and charming movie.
Don't expect to find the razzle dazzle of ""Moulin Rouge"" here, simply because this is a little movie. I imagine its budget was fifty times less. But that's fine. It has plenty style, finesse and quirky glamour. There's also plenty of great music and dancing. Though comparisons to ""Moulin Rouge"" are inevitable, ""Strictly Ballroom"" is perhaps more similar to two of my other favorite Aussie films - ""Muriel's Wedding"" and ""The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"", both released in 1994.",1019260800,2,1690,4.7322033898305085

He laughs at her at first but a few weeks later they`ve become the perfect rumba couple and he`s the one saying, ""I want to dance with you."" His family objects to this but Scott`s interests change and he concludes that he`s going to dance with Fran at the Championship and he doesn`t care about winning.

I was interested in seeing this movie after I fell in love with ""Moulin Rouge"" and saw the same director`s ingenious interpretation in ""Romeo and Juliet"" (even if that specific movie of his lacked in a few areas.) I didn`t expect too much of it, but even if I had I doubt I would have been at all dissapointed. The first thing I noticed was that this film wasn`t remarkably like Luhrman`s others. It resembles ""Moulin Rouge"" in only a few noteworthy ways and doesn`t resemble ""Romeo & Juliet"" at all. It doesn`t hold the usual Baz charm, but it has a lot of other charm as a satisfying substitution. I thought the whole movie was just very sensitive and heartfelt, and not too heavy or loud. I hesitate to say that`s it`s ""light-hearted"" - usually when people say that about movies they`re describing chick flicks that treat the viewer like an [imbasil]. But in comparison to Luhrman`s other movies which contain scene-after-scene doses of lots of drama, this specific movie is quite light-hearted. The only heavy drama here is in the dance choreography. I enjoyed this director`s other films splendidly, but I think I might have enjoyed this one for completely different reasons that don`t have much to do with the fact that the same director as ""Moulin Rouge"" did it.",1018137600,4,2180,4.621134020618556

568410,4,6302994063,"""Strictly Ballroom"" reminds me of a Hercules episode I saw once. I am sure ""Strictly Ballroom"" was part of the inspiration for the show. In Hercules there is a town where everything revolves around dancing, ballroom dancing to be specific. However, the judge demands that everyone uses only approved dance steps. A young girl refuses and wants to dance her own steps. She is banished from the studio and is without a partner for the big competition. Enter Hercules who agrees to dance with her. The awkward young girl becomes a graceful dancer and they win the competition and the love of the audience.
  Everything is virtually the same for ""Strictly Ballroom."" The town is crazy about ballroom dancing, improvisation is frowned upon, their is an awkward girl that becomes a graceful dancer, the loss of a partner and the moral of the story, be true to your heart. Here though the star of the show is Scott Hastings. His wild crowd pleasing dance steps have lost him a big dance title. His partner dumps him for someone else and he is without a partner with only three weeks to go till the big championship dance. Enter the awkward girl. Fran has only been dancing for two years, but believes in the importance of letting the music flow through you. They partner up and win or lose vow to show the dance world a thing a two. While bringing out the best in each other, they fall in love. They also uncover the surprising truth about Scott's Father as well as showing how cutthroat the dancing world can be.
  ""Strictly Ballroom"" is not as visually catching as ""Moulin Rouge"" The story is a bit clich&eacute;s, but the actors give the story such heart that you can over look it. Furthermore the actor portraying Scott's dad is hilariously tragic. The pacing keeps the audience involved with the stories. The only piece of criticism is that we don't learn much about Fran's heritage, her family or why dancing is so important to her. She simply wants to dance, and dance with Scott.

568411,4,6302994063,"There's more than love in the air in ""Strictly Ballroom,"" Australian director Baz Luhrmann's energetic and exciting tale of love among the dance steps that does everything but jump off the screen. The film is essentially a fashion show put to a beat, but it proves itself as more than just a glorious wallow in stylish excess with its love-conquers-all story and themes that, despite their familiarity, feel as good as new.
It's a simple tale of whimsy, focusing on young dancer Scott Hastings (Paul Mercurio), whose looks and talent have secured him a future as the world's most revered dancer. We see in the film's beginning, through a fanciful documentary-like series of interviews and dance events, that Scott dabbles in his own style, creating his own crowd-pleasing moves in spite of the disapproval of his mother and highly regarded judges, who consider his technique a threat to their ""strictly ballroom"" approach.
Everyone that surrounds him pleads with him to give up his boyish dreams; his teacher, Les Kendall (Peter Whitford), feels his apprentice has unrealized potential that would be squandered were he to continue his imaginative steps, while his mother, Shirley (Pat Thompson), wants to steer her son from the same mistakes she made years ago. Scott's father, Doug (Barry Otto), secretly harvests a similar passion for originality, that which will come into play as the movie progresses.
Despite this barrage of protestations, Scott knows better, and holds true to his own heart, continuing his private dancing in his teacher's studio when no one is looking. He is approached by Fran (Tara Morice), a simple girl with a plain demeanor and an equal longing to dance as she pleases. Scott, at first hesitant at her proposal that they dance together in preparation for a grand contest, agrees to teach her; as you may well know, they develop a deeper bond than love of dancing.
Sound familiar? Well, it is, actually. The plot reminded me numerous times of various films, such as ""Dirty Dancing,"" with its various characters denouncing Scott's dancing, and a pastiche of various fairy tale romances, as the two young lovers encounter obstacles in the way of their happiness. But, when filtered through Luhrmann's wondrous ability to make the old seem new and exquisite, such familiar plot characteristics are given new life, and possess the ability to move us, and excite us.
And speaking of exciting, when was the last time such energy and humor as this was seen? Luhrmann has quite the visionary eye, and puts it to incredible use, assaulting us with a visceral array of tightly-choreographed dance sequences, vibrant costumes, and a sense of humor and wit that stays with the film through its entire. Accompanying these attributes are young actors Mercurio and Morice, who sell us on the love story so well that its hard not to feel a sense of urgency when things look stormy for the two.
At various points in ""Strictly Ballroom,"" the audience is given two options: surrender to the film's pseudo-realistic central message (""A life lived in fear is a life half lived""), or flee. Luhrmann throws so much of this into the mix of song, dance, love and ribaldry, that some may find it distracting, but make no mistake: such elements span the gamut of past and present, achieving a universal feel that almost anyone can relate to. This is a truly remarkable film, a special piece of fancy that captures the heart and incites it to soar.",1017014400,3,3448,4.93631669535284
568412,5,6302994063,"Although this, the first of Baz Luhrmann's triptych of ""Red Curtain"" movies, lacks the flashy special effects of Moulin Rouge (the third), it is emotionally the most honest and engaging of the three. (The middle film, Romeo and Juliet, is the weakest, silliest, and downright boring.) But what's clear from Strictly Ballroom is that Luhrmann and his cohorts (the choreographer and production designer he badgers and constantly interrupts on the commentary track) love to dazzle and douse us in saturated colors. Theatrical artificiality dominates every decision they made. Ballroom succeeds (moreso than Moulin Rouge even) because the importance of this artificiality is challenged...by the love story, by the peasant earthiness of the leading woman's Spanish family, and by the earnestness of the hero's commitment to his own dream--to bring something new and truly his own to his own little world, the highly codified and insular world of ballroom dancing.
The only disappointment (and it's a minor one) is that the commentary track was apparently done at or around the same time as the commentary tracks of Romeo and Juliet and Moulin Rouge. More attention is given to production details (and kvetching about the things they couldn't do because of the limited budget) and less about the story itself.",1016928000,3,1303,5.269230769230769

Centering around Scott, a champion ballroom dancer with a domineering, ""stage"" mom and Fran, an average looking girl with a desire to dance, the movie delivers great music, romantic dancing and a nice love story.  Paul Mercurio is handsome and charming as the lead character (I'd like to see him in more films but not like ""An Exit to Eden"", the horrible flop he made later).  This movie is about fun, music and dancing.  Well worth the money---I'm glad its finally on dvd!!!",1016668800,3,512,4.719101123595506
568414,5,6302994063,"Next to ""Shall We Dance"", Strictly Ballroom is one of THE great dance movies.  It contains everything that makes dance movies so wonderful - an intimate romance, conflict between the powers-that-be and the pure & innocent, and stunning dance sequences obviously inspired by people who love dancing.  It is amazingly funny and touching, very emotional while still remaining light entertainment.  It doesn't have that ""cool"" thing that turns me off from so many other dance movies - you know, where the ""cool"" people can dance but the [others] can't...  Strictly Ballroom is stricly dancing, and its story is all about dancing, told through dancing, and simply wouldn't exist without dancing.  You'll want to learn dancing after you see it.
Lead character Scott is a young, profesional ballroom dancer who is favored to win the next major Pan-Pacific dancing championship.  His form and image are perfect, but his own deep inspiration moves Scott to dance in his own style, and this individuality sets him against the proffesional dancing leadership and threatens to derail his entire career.  The group of people trying to keep Scott in line is headed by his own mother, an obsessive woman who drives her family into a frenzy to become top figures in the dance world.  In the background we have Scott's friends and various partners and the organizers of the tournament, and despite the pressure Scott is still compelled to ""dance his own steps.""  Only one person seems to believe in him, a beginning dancer named Fran, and as she starts to train with Scott a romance blooms and their courage inspires others.  Still, the powers throw everything they can at Scott to knock him off course, and by the end you are on the edge of your seat. All I can really say is that the climax is wonderful filmmaking and very saticfying.
My favorite thing about this movie is all the mini-stories going on about each of its supporting characters, and how the film effortlessly floats between their flavors of comedy, lost dreams, hatred, corruption, and ruthless competition.  There is some spellbinding sequences about the Pasa-Double, in which Scott is taught the meaning of rythmn and the pure challenge and conflict of dance, almost like Yoda was there teaching Scott ""the Force"" of dancing. (haha)  This film is also very topical considering the recent Olympic figure skating scandels - you can actually see how something like that comes all about in this movie.",1016496000,5,2450,4.963325183374083

""Strictly Ballroom"" is an early gem of a film that established the auteur-director in the minds of critics as a force to be reckoned with, and it's easy to see why. The movie soars like ""Rocky"" in its underdog and come-from-behind sequences and then boogies like ""Dirty Dancing"" only with far superior storytelling and plot devices that keep it fresh after repeated viewings. The principals are uniformly fine, fresh faced and passionate dancers, and Luhrman paces his show with remarkable staidness and simplicity - certainly nothing like his later edit-a-second epics. ""Strictly Ballroom"" is a model of restraint but dares to tell its story with guts. Thoroughly enjoyable.",1015372800,,968,5.292207792207792

The film is wonderful and is way beyond anything that Hollywood could possibly dream of.  The actors are ALL great and know that acting is far more important than special effects can ever be in a movie.

568498,5,6302994063,"Strictly Ballroom is the story of a young ballroom dancer named Scott. He's from a well known family of dancers in Australia.  Scott's the upcoming star of the Pan Pacific World of Competition Dancing.  When the young man gets a little bored with the rules and regulations that are imposed on the dancers, he plans to try some new steps in his routines.  A shy and seemingly plain girl named Fran believes in Scott's dream and offers to be his dance partner.

Scott's family and their friends are scandalized that he willing to risk his chance of winning a major competition by not obeying the rules.  His choice of a partner doesn't help the situation because Fran is considered to be an amateur and a liability to their dance team.

The main characters are believable and the supporting characters bring in the wonderful comedy.  The exaggerated hairstyles and flashy costumes of many of the dancers are hilarious.  The dancing is a joy to watch and a little romance provides an added zest to the story.

This is a film that you won't forget.",1011398400,4,1044,4.66120218579235
568499,5,6302994063,"This film is as much about ballroom dancing as Gladiator is about gladiating. Dancing is the device that drives the film, but the story is about nonconformity, something Baz Luhrmann should know a lot about, and boy is it driven well. I thoroughly enjoyed this film mainly because its so much fun and ingeniously crafted with a very witty and richly detailed script.
Its not visually veracious like Moulin Rouge or even Romeo + Juliet, but its just as stimulating. The plot revolves around Scott, who is a very talented dancer who is currently training to go to the PanPacific Nationals (or something like that, I forget) which is the biggest dancing tournament in the area. To be in that torunament he has to dance like everyone else, but he wants to dance his way because he finds dancing in a manner of strictly ballroom dull, but to dance ""his way"" would be going against the wishes of his hyper controlling mother and instructor. He can find no partner to dance his way and eventually finds a completely untrained partner, Fran, who is willing to throw away standards and go wild. It escalates from there.
Luhrmann doesn't expect us to know anything about ballroom dancing restrictions, regulations, standards. He tells us what we need to know to make an incredibly liberating film.
The last time a story was told like this, that I can remember, was the Gary Cooper film ""Fountainhead"" which is a very dark and expressionistic film. This film tells the same story of fighting a system (inobscure, other than and small than legal, medical, social etc.). Here it's ballroom dancing, there it's the architecture circles. This film is fun, it's silly, and it's fresh. It's NOT a teenybopper film, it's high quality.
Some of the actors play ridiculous characters and do it with ease and grace and great comic agility. Like in Moulin Rouge, the cinematography utilizes odd angles to help us in forming our opinions of people. The choreography is fantastic, and it tells stories. The dance steps of everyone else seem silly and forced, yet Scot and Fran's makes sense and are exhilarating, they seem correct. Funny, considering most of us shouldn't really have an opinion on the correct function of ballroom steps. Yet that is where Luhrmann and Pearce (his co-writer) and the cast succeed. They, the creators and actors, make us care about characters and what they want to achieve. And this is done very unconvetionally. Most of all this film makes you feel like you can break free from whatever you are doing and just go...dance.",1011312000,8,2529,4.829493087557604

All three films are in my top 5 list and will be in yours as soon as you see them, but when you do, please see them in order!!

Being that this is a small movie, it really works--and that is probably why it is better than anything Hollywood has produced in some time. And charming extras to the movie-- Tara Morice sings the TIME AFTER TIME song that runs throughout some of the movie. Paul Mercurio did his own dancing--including adding additional choreography.

I think it's because there are so many small truths revealed about human nature, especially why we make the decisions we make and how we justify them to ourselves.  What makes people want to play it safe versus being different?  And these themes are examined with great humor and obvious affection for the characters, even the ""villains"".  Barry Fife's skewed toupee and Ken Railings romancing Liz in a floor model jacuzzi (right in the showroom!) make us laugh and show us that these people are hardly sinister, even though they take themselves very seriously in their insular little world.
Although you could describe the story as having a very typical ""ugly duckling turns into swan"" storyline, I like the fact that Fran is actually really homely when we first see her.  She isn't just an obviously drop-dead gorgeous woman wearing glasses.  So her transformation comes more from within.  As she gains confidence in herself and comes to be loved by Scott, the glow she exudes is totally believable.  The scene where her father looks into her eyes and compliments her dancing is very moving, because you get the sense that it is maybe the first time he's ever even noticed her as a person in her own right.

The dance contest plot of the movie  drags a lot of disparate stuff along in its wake. You have your extremely  winning ungainly-girl-whose-spirit-makes-her-lovely story, and your  immigrants-in-a-new-country side, and your redemption-after-many-years  moments... None of that is new material, but it all comes together with  total assurance in ways you wouldn't have been especially prepared for. All  the elements are snappily handled, lively and enjoyable, and in some cases  they're really pretty poignant too. Several of the minor characterizations  are surprising and memorable. That's always a good sign, isn't it?
Along  the way, too, you get a bunch of infectiously funny situations and some  wryly delightful direction. (The choreography doesn't stop on the dance  floor, but it's great there too.)

With it's wonderful direction, acting, and romantic storyline it is a must have for all movie watchers!  I  highly reccomend buying this movie from Amazon!",952473600,2,264,4.844444444444444
568656,5,6302994063,"In this film ballroom dancing is used as a metaphore for life.  This is a movie about thinking for yourself rather than following the crowd.  The phrase ""A life lived in fear is a life half lived."" plays  significantly in it.  Be aware that the first five or ten minutes of the  film are done as a documentary.  These scenes set up the story perfectly,  but I've had two people (who both loved the film) tell me that they would  have turned it off during the documentary scenes if I hadn't been watching  it with them.  This needs to be released on DVD!",951091200,3,553,4.281553398058253
568657,5,6302994063,"Baz Luhrmann at his finest.  This terrific film is really three movies in one.  First, there's the tremendous dance movie whcih centers on Scott Hastings (Paul Mecurio) and his struggles to introduce 'new steps' to the  sheltered world of Austrailian ballroom dancing.  For dance afficiandos,  despite the broad comedy that infuses the movie, the dancing is the real  thing.  Mecurio is a formally trained dancer and you simply can't fake,  edit, or body-double the moves he pulls off in this film.  Even if you're  not a dancer, Mecurio's athletiscism alone is worth seeing.
The second  movie is a Dirty Dancing-style, boy-meets-ugly-duckling tale. The story  allows you to peek behind the covers of a first generation Australian and  her awkward attempts to fit into a  new culture while maintaining her  European ties at home.
The third movie is what sets Strictly Ballroom  apart from the field - tremendously funny, broad caricatures squabbling  around the periphery of Scott and his struggle to bring his 'new steps' to  the Pan-Pacific Championships.  Pat Thompson is hysterical as Doug's mother  Shirley, and Bill Hunter is wonderfully over-the-top as dancing kingmaker  Barry Fife ('There are no new steps!').  But attention first-time viewers -  keep your eyes on Barry Otto as Scott's father, Doug Hastings.  This odd,  seemingly shell of a man is actually the  emotional core of the film.  He  provides the movies funniest moments (particularly - as other reviewers  have alluded to - a flashback sequence so over-the-top hilarious that it  defies description) and its most relevatory ones.
Play this film over and  over again and you will never be disappointed.",950486400,199,1674,5.180451127819549
568658,5,6302994063,I am not a dancer-not even close. But this movie makes me want to put down my Hostess Ding-Dong and get off the couch. The dancing is great to watch-but the love story is even better. You can almost feel the sweat  rolling off his neck when they dance. The dance scene at the end where he  kisses her gets me every time. This is a great movie.,947635200,4,343,4.029411764705882
568659,5,6302994063,"Ok, ok, I know... there have been a lot of dancing competition movies lately, but if you like romantic comedies mixed with exotic flaminco dancing as well as beautiful and elegant ballroom dancing, this movie is  for you.  Very similar to ""Shall We Dance"" and although probably  not as high budget, it is definately just as good as, if not better than  ""Shall We Dance.""  A really wonderful and inspiring movie for  lovers of professional dance.",946684800,2,445,4.7894736842105265
568660,5,6302994063,"This is a lively romp that is sure to take your cares away. The ""staged"" flashback concerning Scott's father is hilarious and adds a new dimension to the term ""flash-back"". The music is  top-rate, the editing is cutting, the dancing is flashy and the romance is  sweet. Excellent over-the-top performances all round.",944956800,2,316,5.0576923076923075

568662,5,6302994063,"As a theatreical costume designer, I found the whole movie fascinating, visually rich, fun.  It pokes fun at design obsessions I also hold dear and takes them to an etreme levelin costumes, setting, characters.  The sarcasm  and wit of the story are charming, charming, charming.  The characters of  Scott and Fran are people we 'know' in our own lives. . .heck,  maybe they  are US.  And who hasn't questioned their parents' wisdom at some time in  their lives?  Embarking on the 'road less travelled'  is a good risk, this  movie says.  And, of course, "" a life lived in fear is only half  lived"" encourages us all to take those good risks.  Did you know that  this movie's beginning were in a design class at the Royal Academy of the  Arts in Austalia?  Bravo to that risk-taking designer and to those who took  that project to this extreme, lovely level, too.  SEE THIS FILM, you will  love it.",934848000,,898,4.556962025316456
7838128,5,6302994063,"I can't be specific with a review because it's just my FAVORITE movie and I love every bit of it. As with most Baz Luhrman projects, this film is visually stunning. The romance is charming and sweet as the characters develop into better versions of themselves amid a slightly ridiculous world of competetive dancing. Um, I mean ""dance sport"". Nothing too heavy or angsty; good choice if you want something slightly offbeat but seriously sweet.",1524787200,,443,4.92
7838129,3,6302994063,"The movie alone is wonderful and one of my favorites; however, it's the quality of this dvd that was shipped to me.  It took forever to just get to the movie because there were so many 'Coming Attractions' before I could click on 'Play Movie'.  And once we played it the quality was very poor.  There was something off in the lighting and pixels.  Next time I would just fork out the money and buy a brand new dvd; no more 'USED' versions of movies.",1523318400,,449,4.247058823529412
