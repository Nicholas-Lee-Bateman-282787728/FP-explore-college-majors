3681383,4,B001L67A3W,"I highly recommend this movie.  This is an example of the type of films intelligent and talented African-American filmmakers can create when given the chance.  We all respect what Tyler Perry has done, but films like ""...Black and Sexy"", ""Medicine for Melancholy"" and ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/L-A-Proper/dp/B0032CF4RM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">L.A.

3681384,4,B001L67A3W,"I must say that I was pleasantly surprised by this film. The title of the film suggested gratuitous sex and graphic nudity, with perhaps very little substance. That title is deceptive, thank heavens. It consists of four vignettes about black relationships. However, the scenarios are so realistic, that they are cross ethnic and cultural and just ultimately reflect the human condition that we all share and that's simply trying to find reason in love, sex and relationships. The way it was shot and the direction and dialogue was so realistic that it almost felt as though it were a documentary at times. Great job by a new director. Loved it!",1261872000,4,644,4.863636363636363
3681385,1,B001L67A3W,"This movie did absolutely nothing for me.  I thought the premise of the movie was great, by showing different relationships good, and bad, but that's where my kudos end.  The stories were too long, and drawn out, and there was no resolution to any of them.  I don't know if this genre of black relationships movies (Indie) is the new way to go, but this is 1 of a few movies that I've seen the movie chopped up to tell different stories, and none of them work.

For the price Amazon is charging, I expected a little more bang for my buck. I'm all for supporting black writers, and directors, but this movie made me wish I'd broken one of my golden rules about buying bootleg (which I'm not endorsing) but I would suggest getting a used copy, that way you'll be just as disappointed as I was, but at a discounted rate.",1242604800,2,817,4.3202614379084965
3681386,3,B001L67A3W,"The opening part was weak but the 2nd story needs to be made into a movie by itself. Helena is on some other level and would love to see her in a full feature. Like the reviewer said earlier, the soundtrack is excellent. it really sets the mood for some scenes. Just a heads up about the soundtrack as well. It's solid but the song that is in tonite part 1 where the lady with the braids is in the car with the baby and the accountant is NOT on the soundtrack. I don't know if this is an oversite or they just didn't have the license to put this on the soundtrack. a real minus",1239667200,2,577,3.9827586206896552
3681387,2,B001L67A3W,"The title is an attention getter; don't waste your money.  I rented this for $3.99, I'm glad that I did not purchase it as I initially intended.  It really wasn't worth $3.99 but it really isn't worth $14.99 or more.",1239494400,,216,4.375
3681388,5,B001L67A3W,"As I sat in a packed auditorium at this film's opening at Sundance 2008, I listened and joined in with the audience's loud laughter. This film provides unique perspectives in each of the six vignettes, a lot of attitude, and has a well-chosen cast and exciting soundtrack. A Good Day to be Black and Sexy is an artful film with appeal to more than Black audiences. Dennis Dortch was nominated for Best Director 2008 and it is easy to watch this film and see why.",1238112000,2,462,4.447058823529412
3681389,5,B001L67A3W,"Having seen this crowd-pleasing film in theaters twice, I have to say that I felt both surprised and rewarded by the filmmaker's audacity and intelligence.  This film is a real breath of fresh air, particularly in the often predictable world of black cinema.  Told through a series of vignettes, the stories are both familiar and authentic (""Reciprocity's"" give, but no take scenario between boy and girl made me grimace at some of my own sexual misadventures).  However, their familiarity is part of the film's genius in that we so rarely see entertaining ""real"" depictions of black sexuality.  While the title implies explicit sexuality, the stories are frank but never gratuitous.  The filmmaker has the audacity to ""keep it real"" in ways that are both thought-provoking and to take bold chances to keep the film visually vibrant.  The soundtrack, which deserves its own glowing review, is unbelievably tight and takes the film to another level as it captures the film's soulful heart.  This is definitely one to watch!",1235779200,12,1022,5.083832335329341
3681390,1,B001L67A3W,"This movie did not make too much sense to me what so ever. The acting wasn't the greatest and the script was pretty vague. There were only like two chapters in this whole movie that made some bit of sense. Sorry, but this film did not do much for me at all. Glad i rented it first. So now I know I won't be buying it.",1234915200,2,317,3.8181818181818183
3681391,4,B001L67A3W,"I saw this film and I must say I was impressed, because of the realness of it.  The opening scene is surreal and will truly pull you into the film at once.  The soundtrack could not be better and was very much a part of the movie as if it was almost a character itself.  The film is basically divided into four parts with different vignettes on different people from interracial love (Black and Asian) to being caught up in the moment to the consequences that come along with adultery.  The film is like a collection of four short stories that are not related, but form a complete whole.  It reminded me of a modern day Blaxploitation movie.

This is definitely not a big budget blockbuster, but more of an Art House film that was nurtured with tender loving  care like other Sundance films.  Morally wise the film's characters can use some morals, but I guess when it comes down to it, it does reflect what goes on behind many closed doors.  I loved how the film ended, because I think it'll inspire anyone to be proud of who they are and who the love.  I think this is an excellent start for a young director.  Reminds me of Spike Lee's ""She's Gotta Have It"".  God is Love!",1228608000,20,1175,4.339449541284404

3681406,5,B001L67A3W,"Support indie filmmakers. Individual vignettes feel a story about different aspects of Black initmate and interpersonal interaction without gratuitous and ridiculous stereotypes. Told by us, for us...and them to understand

3681407,1,B001L67A3W,"Ugh...horrible.  Epitome of perpetuating stereotypes....or maybe I just can't relate to 'black sex' in LA....

Just horrible.

Don't waste your time.

Very little character development....Title and content are polar opposites.

Has a certain depressing je ne sais quoi...

PASS",1401062400,,277,5.9743589743589745
3681408,5,B001L67A3W,Excellent movie. A very accurate representation of black sexuality minus raunchiness and stereotypes.  Great acting and very relatable characters. This movie could easily be used for a university level course on sexuality and/or relationships.  Get this movie! You will not be disappointed!,1394323200,,290,5.880952380952381
3681409,5,B001L67A3W,Very Sexy and real... the vignettes in this film were great. I learned of this film though the Black and Sexy website. The have a lot of cool series on Youtube. I think anyone would enjoy this film.,1370736000,,198,4.2368421052631575

3681411,3,B001L67A3W,"Not quite porn but it does leave some to the imagination. Not really sure how to explain, but, I felt it was a look at different types of black love. Some very familiar some I have heard about but all entertaining. Good flix...no pun intended",1360454400,,242,4.4
3681422,3,B001L67A3W,"Interesting.  I think that sums up my conclusion as the credits rolled by.  The music in the opening sequence I thought took away from the experience.  I couldn't decide whether the music choice was deliberate or poor post production dubbing.  Other than weird sound effects, I enjoyed the movie.  I especially enjoyed the last sequence called the American Boyfriend. That was laugh out loud funny.",1355270400,,398,5.061538461538461
3681423,1,B001L67A3W,"Do buy this. It was horrible, I bearly got through the first 30 minutes then I just couldn't take it anymore. I kept waiting for it to get better, then I just couldn't take it anymore.",1345420800,,184,4.138888888888889
3681424,5,B001L67A3W,"I honestly wish that I could give this film 10 stars! We need more films like this...very tasteful and honest, truthful, moving, stirring, poignant, and just a really well-done script. It did not seem like acting. It seemed like I was peering into the lives of people in the neighborhood. I have to invest in this. It's something I want in my DVD collection.

3681426,5,B001L67A3W,"This film was found while searching for the director of another film on the ""Magnolia Entertainment"" site. The title was interesting and the site said the soundtrack was a major part of the film. Well, after watching the trailer I knew I needed to see more.

This is a set of short films about black people and their sexual relations and relationships. It is so real that it can make the timid person very uncomfortable. I love the fact that it addresses many of the things we all deal with at one time or another and it throws it at you, all gritty and straight up, no flowers and soft music.

This is my kind of movie! Be ready, you'll probably have to watch it twice!!",1299628800,8,671,4.317460317460317
3681427,5,B001L67A3W,"I saw this movie last week and I was very impressed.  It's rawness is a testament that we are all going through some form of drama when it comes to relationships. My favorite segment: ""Her Man.""  I didn't know whether to laugh or cry. The actors were excellent and really had the right chemistry.  The soundtrack is exceptional.  Patrice Rushen's ""When I Found You"" was so fitting.  And the story she told about her mom singing it, perfect. Definitely check this movie out.  Especially if you are black and sexy!!",1282867200,3,513,4.644444444444445
3681428,4,B001L67A3W,"Loved it...very well thought out and anyone who has had any kind of sexual encounter could relate to this movie. I recommend it, especially for African American moms and their teenage daughters to watch together.",1264636800,,212,5.085714285714285
3681429,3,B001L67A3W,It's a good movie. It seems to end a little too soon. The film is mostly comprised of five short stories about couples and their relationships/situations. I was left wanting a little more. Maybe there will be a sequel. The soundtrack is very good.,1264204800,2,247,4.636363636363637
3681430,5,B001L67A3W,"While in Target, came across this DVD. The 70's instantly came to mind but the mention of the Sundance festival definitely perked our interest and we purchased it. My spouse and I are lovers of indie flicks and this appeared to be something worth checking out. We were pleased, to say the least.

First, I need to share that we are listening to the soundtrack now that we purchased on iTunes. The soundtrack is on the level of the Love Jones CD that lovers of the movie purchased in droves. Rich with neo-soul and funk-driven organic hip-hop, the soundtrack is excellent. The movie, which could be described as a collection of short stories about one hot day in July, is also very enjoyable.

The stories are shot in close frame and the intimacy of each moment is easily felt by the dynamic framing and positioning of the camera and the appropriate lighting for each scene. The acting from the ensemble cast is above-average (when compared to other low-budget indie art films)and the dialogue is executed to really convey a feeling of ""being there"". While the characters don't easily fall into catergories of ""good"" or ""bad"", they are definitely dimensional and relatable. I look forward to whatever the writer/director of this film comes out with next and hopes he continues to create work that showcases diverse stories about African-American life.",1263081600,,1350,4.890829694323144
3681431,5,B001L67A3W,"I LOVED THIS FILM!  NOW THAT I'VE SEEN IT I CAN'T MAKE UP MY MIND ON WHICH IS MY FAVORITE MOVIE A GOOD DAY TO BE BLACK AND SEXY OR LOVE JONES.  THIS FILM HAD REAL AND TRUE RELATIONSHIP ISSUES.  THE IMAGES SHOWN IN THE FILM WERE BEAUTIFUL AND ARTISTIC.  EVEN THE SOUNDTRACK IS HOT!!!  THIS FILM GIVES TRUE INSIGHT ON THE REALITY OF WHAT GOES ON BEHIND CLOSED DOORS BETWEEN PEOPLE IN UNIQUE RELATIONSHIP SITUATIONS.  THIS FILM REPRESENTS BLACK SEX IN A FUN, REAL, AND TASTEFUL WAY.  I GIVE A STANDING OVATION TO ALL WHO WAS IN VOLVED IN MAKING THIS FILM AND NOW I'M HOPING THEY COME TOGETHER AGAIN SO I CAN SEE  A GOOD DAY TO BE BLACK AND SEXY PART TWO!

8317443,3,B001L67A3W,"Meh.  I give any aspiring filmmaker the first star just for effort.  The second star is because it was compelling enough that I made it to the end, but I couldn't stomach the chink crap.  The stories were basic.  I don't know why Black people keep labeling everyday stuff Black, like somehow it's different from what other people go through.  What race can't relate to cheating, masturbating, selfishness, statutory rape and forbidden ""love""?  It was unique that most of the shots were close up.  Ok, for his first major work, I'll add a star.  There you go Dennis.  You're welcome.  Thank God, Black & Sexy TV has come a long way.",1437004800,3,631,4.603603603603603
