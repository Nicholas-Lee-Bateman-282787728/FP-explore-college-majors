8741329,5,B018470I0C,this movie was the best. they told this story so well. it is sad that he died but at least the best thing this foundation did was to try to reunite him with his family. at least they were able to get him out of that stupid tank in mexico city and got him to rehabilitation at the oregon coast aquarium in newport. and then afterwards at least they took him to a seapen for more training in iceland and then released him. yeah he wound up in norway and craved for human attention which is not unnormal for whales. whales do that in the wild time to time. it's not like keiko was doing it often. but as long as they had protection out there to make sure he doesn't harm anyone then that is very important. but the point is this story was well told and this team did the best job in the world with him. they did a super job with him. really. i'm very proud of them. i recommend this video to everyone. please buy this movie.,1523059200,,921,4.065934065934066
8741330,5,B018470I0C,"There are absolutely no words regarding what whales and dolphins go through to be exploited in these pathetic tanks in these pathetic parks. It amazes me that so many people are all about the SPCA and how domesticated dogs are treated yet they have absolutely no heart for wild animals that belong in the wild and not some tiny tank in comparison to their vast ocean homes and their families. Wild animals weren't created by God to be exploited and made profit from and every time you pay to go to an aquarium, park, Sea World, etc. you are allowing whales, dolphins etc. to be killed in the process. This is a documentary that should be shown in schools so that way our children can see exactly what exploitation does and how exploitation hurts wild animals. If you want to see an Orca go to Canada, Oregon, Washington state, etc. and go see them in the wild where they are free and in their own environment. How would you like being taken from your family and put in a cage for the rest of your life so people could come look at you perform for your food??? Research ""Pavlov's Dogs"" as he was the first physiologist to develop the performance/feeding response also seen in ABA/VBA for children with autism. Stop allowing these parks to exploit and abuse these animals by boycotting such non-sense.",1513468800,,1299,4.579399141630901

8741333,5,B018470I0C,"I was born into the keiko era, right after the movie came out and all the kids were trying to helpfree Keiko. I watched these movies as a child religiously. Loving it just as much as the very first time I watched them. Then his real story came out. I cried when I watched it. Being able to see the fact that he made it back home but still knew who the ones were that helped him. Let his story, his real story, be the one that makes people realize orcas SHOULD NOT be in captivity.",1467676800,2,480,4.010416666666667

8741336,1,B018470I0C,"So hey everyone. Don't waste your money on this. You can watch it free on YouTube. But a word of caution. As you watch, make sure you try to wade through all the emotional bull crap. The narrator/movie producer is an obvious hypocrite who seems to make an emotional connection when this movie is trying to end all connections to animals. Not to mention that most of the people in the ""cast"" only had cursory involvement and the onsite team wasn't even consulted in the film.",1458691200,,474,4.523255813953488
