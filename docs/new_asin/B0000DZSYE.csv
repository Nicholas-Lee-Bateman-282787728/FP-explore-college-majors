1930471,5,B0000DZSYE,"This is a great series. I saw it first on KTEH years ago. I almost never caught all of the shows, but I loved them then and love them more now. I bought them all.

It's a nice story of a small town in Ireland. There is a little of everything. Anyone could watch this. I would think girls would like it better. My 12 neice loves and also has all of the series too.",1178496000,,363,3.84
1930472,5,B0000DZSYE,"Ballykissangel is just the kind of series I love to watch.  The characters are well developed and are interesting.  They could be in my little neighborhood, if we all had Irish accents.  I would like to get the rest of the seasons, when the price comes down!",1168819200,2,258,4.446808510638298
1930473,5,B0000DZSYE,"Excellent acting, dialogue, story line, lovable characters...

makes you want to move to Bally K!",1168473600,2,97,5.466666666666667
1930474,5,B0000DZSYE,"After watching BallyK Series Four, I realize just how good Series One and Two really are. The chemistry between Stephen Tompkinson and Dervla Kirwan is excellent. Indeed the entire cast play off eachother quite well creating a believeable rural Irish community that ironically probably existed only in one's imagination or romanticezed recollections of long ago.",1168300800,,362,5.6
1930475,4,B0000DZSYE,"A very good buy for sure.  Well produced, well-written, and well-acted the first two series are very good, and I highly recommend them.  Though after reading some online info concerning the third series and after, it seems the show's writing and plots go to pot.  Characters apparently die for no good reason and strange situations crop up.  The writers should have kept the show in its light-hearted setting of the first series instead of turning into a soap opera setting in later years.  It could have lasted several years.",1127347200,5,526,4.865168539325842
1930476,5,B0000DZSYE,"After several trips to the Vale of Avoca, it's easy to see how one could easily fall into line with the characters of Ballykissangel. From wily Brian Quiqley to quizzical Father Clifford and the highly changeable Niamh. The series truly portrays the idyllic countryside and the lifestyle that is so relaxed. Those who love Ireland and the Irish people will love Ballykissangel as they see the small town through the eyes of the local citizenry. Driving through the countryside, you can see images of Donal and Liam at almost every turn in the road, hoping they are not carring an electronic confessional!

For those who have been waiting, Series 3 will be available in March 2005, so enjoy Series 1 and 2 and be ready for more Irish laughter and fun in the new year. We'll be in Ireland when it makes it debut and we'll hoist a pint in Fitzgerald's in celebration!",1099785600,12,864,4.647058823529412
1930477,4,B0000DZSYE,"This drama set in a small town in Ireland is less significant for its substance than for the days-gone-by nostalgia feel of it. It is a wonderfully simple program; a sort of Andy Griffith Show foundation enlivened by modernity. We see an attractive barkeep who has vague qualms with the religion into which she was born begin to respect the new priest in town as he jockeys with his older generational priest-supervisor. Through this prism we can see what we want of Ireland's more recent development. The program encourages us to take sides between the traditionalist (sometimes selfish) church of the past, and a more lively (but less absolute) version of it, as evinced by this young priest from afar who stirs up this town a bit. It's not at all a religious program, mind you; just an overly unrepresentitive portrayal of idyllic Ireland in which you cannot fail to include religion. Full disclosure: I like this show, but I also have Irish blood. I say this because this really is a program which appeals to a particular sort of individual; to one who either has Irish blood and/or for those whom Ireland has some draw. Ireland has an inherent appeal to many such people from around the world. Even if you have never visited it, can you not right now visualize vast green fields and rolling hills bordered by stone walls, snugly cozy pubs filled with glasses of Guiness raised, and smiling faces? Of course, i'm exaggerating here, but you must grant that Ireland is a far more attractive place than many others, at least in a theorhetical quality-of-life sort of way. It's thought of as the sort of place where stress is not as prevalent as where one finds oneself; having a bygone character to it (notwithstanding this not to be as true in actuality, but like in many other things, imagination often persists over reality). If I am making any sense to you with this, Ballykissangel may be to your liking. If you are familiar with Garrison Keillor's pubic radio show, ""A Prairie Home Companion"" (saturdays 6pm across the USA), Ballykissangel is to Ireland what the fictional town of ""Lake Woebegone"" is to the American heartland. I recommend both. Both evince what a part of us long for (if you are a nostalgic sort of person, regardless of your age--even a 25 year old can long for previous eras) and even though such may not suit us, it does make us inclined to enjoy programs like ""A Prarie Home Companion"" and ""Ballykissangel"". I hope this review of sorts was of use to you. Cheers!  P.S. If you do give this program a try and find it to your liking I'd like to let you know that the ""set"" of Ballykissangel isn't one at all; but rather is an one-street town (called Avoca) that was occassionally commandeered for filming so that you can actually travel to it! To have a drink in its pub, visit its church (as I have) and so on is a somewhat surreal experience; as you walk into ""the program"", so to speak, that you have enjoyably watched from afar. Now, where else can you do something like that!",1091318400,35,3006,4.618691588785047
1930478,5,B0000DZSYE,"The wonderful thing about this DVD combo is that we BallyK fans are rewarded with neat little features such as a tour of Avoca (BallyK) and a really well made documentary on the success of the series featuring interviews with all of the past and more recent cast. If you love the series like I do, it's just wonderful to have series one and two available at any time and to be able to flip through to inspiring scenes or particularly touching moments.
I just wish they would release the other series...I actually love the show all the way to series 6 so let's keep our fingers crossed...
Marc",1084752000,9,592,4.440366972477064
1930479,5,B0000DZSYE,"I wish they would release Series 3 too. Ballykissangel can be broken down into three parts: Assumpta and Father Peter era (Series 1-3), Father Aidan era (Series 4 and 5) and the aussie priest era (Series 6) Now, the only ones in my opinion worth watching is the first three series and they are absolutely brilliant. They do not mock the Catholic religion but focuses on human relationships (especially in a small village)and interaction between the characters especially when an event rocks the boat e.g. loss of Niamh's baby. The audience see bonds of friendship strengthen and in most cases the villagers are one big family. Now the books A new arrival and A sense of place are series one and two respectively and are worth buying too. The only thing that spoils it for me is the fact Kieran Prendville did not write a sequel to these two books and that the BBC have not released Series 3 on DVD.",1075593600,27,898,4.583850931677019
1930480,5,B0000DZSYE,"This is a fantastic show which my mother hooked me on a few years ago.  If you've never caught an episode on PBS, now is your chance.  Unlike glitzy American prime-time soap operas, these characters have a great deal of depth and the status quo can change, dramatically, at any time.  If you liked the quirky characters and situations of ""Northern Exposure"", you will love this show!",1068768000,33,383,4.686567164179104
1930481,5,B0000DZSYE,"When I discovered the first season of Ballykissangel at my local library, I couldn't stop watching the show untill the end, especially the 3 first seasons. Then I was embarrased at keep barrowing the DVDs from them, so I decided to get my own.
No regrets, beautiful show, warm, funny, and good quality.",1226361600,,302,4.716981132075472
1930482,5,B0000DZSYE,"This product, ""Balleykissangel""(DVD), arrived in a timely manner and in good condition. It is part of a series of light comedy/dramas set in present day Ireland. The series lacks the worn out cliches about Erin. Instead, it portrays likeable and believeable characters in somewhat plauseable situations.  The show is like a trip to Ireland without the airfare.",1217203200,,360,5.315789473684211
1930483,5,B0000DZSYE,"And if you're an Irish family, all the better! I watched Series 1 last week and could not wait to get into the 2nd series. Our local library has copies and so we can rent them, but the series is so good you would be well-advised to purchase your own copies.

The picturesque village and it's environs are enchanting and alluring, and the pace of life would be very attractive to some of us who've about had it with the rat race. Do not expect to hear any foul language or witness acts of gratuitous violence; more likely, you will find gentle jibes, imaginative pranks, plenty of self-deprecation, and loads of good, clean fun.

Each episode has plenty of humor but you will also find pathos, bathos (not sure what the difference is between those two, but what the hey), angst, anger and conflict. In other words, just like life. We all have our foibles and frailties and all of them are on exhibition here. The young priest, Father Clifford, is such a straight shooter that he almost immediately makes a positive impact on the citizens of the town, many of whom are NOT devout churchgoers, but who regularly and enthusiastically partake of the ""sacraments"" served up by the local pub.

The series does not duck away from controversy and tough subjects. One of the simmering undercurrents in the early episodes is the undeniable attraction between the boyish and clean-cut Father Clifford and the vixenish pub owner Asumpta Fitzgerald; she's no fan of the church and what it stands for, but she finds herself to be more and more interested in the young priest. You get the idea that it's Father Clifford who is in control; if he wanted to renounce his commitment to celibacy--even temporarily--and fall in love with Asumpta, she would not resist.

You will grow to know and love the fascinating characters. If you can appreciate people with quirks and odd mannerisms and expressions, and you have a slightly dry and/or wicked sense of humor, you will enjoy ""BallyK"". A couple of similar series or films: the seemingly never-ending, gentle-humored British series The Last of the Summer Wine, James Herriot's All Creatures Great and Small, Monarch of the Glen, and finally, the wonderful Bill Forsythe film Local Hero, very similar, but with a Scottish setting, and chock full of interesting characters who do what they want to do and don't worry about what the neighbors will think. The sad thing is that all of these series are completely unlike anything you've ever seen on American television. Apparently the networks--for good reason--are convinced that American audiences will only watch sex, violence and inane reality programming. Can anyone ever recall a popular and long-running American TV series which did not contain any of those sensational elements? If we've ever had one, it did not last beyond the first season, due to low ratings, poor promotion, and consequently, lack of funds and good stories.

If you cannot actually move to BallyK, you will at least want to visit Avoca to see for yourself the beauty of this part of Ireland. If you cannot go, watch the series with everyone in your family; what a great way to spend some quality time!",1203465600,,3156,4.826247689463956

1930488,5,B0000DZSYE,"My husband and I both enjoyed this very much.  We actually bought season three also, which finished out the story of the priest and Assumpta.

8001583,1,B0000DZSYE,"The series itself is wonderful.  That's why we purchased the DVDs.  But fully one third of the entire set is unwatchable due to scratches on the discs.  There is nothing in the product description that says these are used so I assumed they were new and unwatched, as the packaging indicated.  Absolutely horrible viewing experience.
