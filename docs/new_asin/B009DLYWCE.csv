8540379,4,B009DLYWCE,"So I saw this movie yesterday and for some reason I just feel the need to review it, this movie is a little hard to explain, it's in 7 days and takes place in Havana and each day it's a different story with different people(for most of them), the first one was the one I was most looking forward to, cause it starred Josh Hutcherson. Now, the first few ones were pretty good but as the movie went on the script became a mess, Josh's was good, but I was disappointed, why didn't they make something more devastating happen to his character like maybe his character getting robbed, but I still liked it, however, Josh's was the weakest out of all the others. It seemed that the writers got lazy or just didn't want to do this anymore. Each day is only like about 16 minutes, sometimes less sometimes a little more. So I can kinda see how it's a little hard to fit things in such a small amount of time. And come up with 7 different stories. However we really don't know the characters if the writers maybe would had added things about their characters then maybe it would had been more devastating as to what happens to some of the characters, an example would be  Teddy (Josh Hutcherson) all we know about him is that he is from the US and is an actor, that's all we know about him. It was a pretty good start but it pales through. I saw what the writers were trying to do, they were trying to pull off what Pulp Friction did and maybe they would have gotten there if they would have spent more time on it. So overall I probably did like it a lot more then I'm letting on.",1364515200,,1571,4.201986754966887

I had never heard of the movie, and it certainly hasn't gotten publicity of any kind in the US, but the little info that I knew of it was enough for me to take a chance on this. Am I glad I did!

""7 Days in Havana"" (2012 Spanish/French/Cuban co-production; 129 min.) brings 7 seemingly independent short fims. brought by 7 different directors, each protraying a different day of the week. The first story, ""El Yuma"" is likely to get the most attention as it stars Josh Hutcherson (of The Hunger Games) and also marks the directorial debut of Benicio Del Toro, but honestly, as okay and superficially fun this story is, it pales with the rest of the movie and for me is probably the weakest of the entire bunch. ""Jam Session"" is what you think it might be: a story culminating into Cuban musicians jamming until the wee hours of the night, just great. ""La Tentation de Cecilia"" (The Temptation of Cecilia) is a cleaver story about a young female singer tempted to take an offer to sing in Europe. Cecilia is in fact the only character who returns later in the movie in another chapter (hence my reference to ""seemingly independent"" earlier). As the movie goes on, the stories becomes more and more left-of-center and somehow getting better and better. My favorite piece is the very last one ""La Fuente"" (The Source), which brings it all home: the people, the poverty, the cohesiveness, the music.

I enjoyed this movie a lot more than I expected to. There are many observations of the ordinary life in Havana which you can laugh or cry at, but will not leave you unmoved. And as mentioned before, the music is hugely important in this film, so if you are not a music fan, this probably isn't for you. If on the other hand you enjoyt a good foreign movie with intruiging characters and great music, then this is surely for you. ""7 Days in Havana"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1353974400,5,1953,4.529745042492918
