3031371,1,B000YKI4MM,"A someone looking for facts on climate change AND a conclusion as to what those facts actually mean, this documentary promised much more than it delivered.

The back cover teaser even asks potential viewers the question ""But is this vast, potentially catastrophic, climate change the result of human behavior? Or is it simply the Earth's natural cycle of warming and cooling since the planet was formed?"" An hour an half later, facts are presented PROVING that the earth has indeed had wild temperature swings in both directions, and that they were, indeed, natural in origin. MANY theories are presented that I hadn't heard before - but NONE of them can be attributed to human. NOTHING is presented or proven with facts that show humans are causing significant (if any) temperature increase. However, the ""conclusion"" of the documentary seems to rest on it's presentation of natural temperature swings that humans better change their ways before it's too late.

NOWHERE does this documentary acknowledge that the fossil (ice core, etc) record proves that CO2 levels FOLLOW temperature increases - not bring them about.

What the film DOES do is demonstrate that there are SO many naturally-occurring ways that CO2 and methane can be increased that for humans to radically change their ways based on this anthropogenic ""global warming"" junk science is senseless and will not only NOT improve the situation - but will stifle and further impoverish developing and third-world countries even as industrial superpowers play numbers games with their insane ""Cap and Trade"" schemes.

Does the History Channel have an ""agenda?"" Perhaps - but that may be too harsh. It is probably safe to say that they know which side of their bread is buttered - and by who - so it's best for them to appease the global-warming chicken littles - especially those with checkbooks.

Still, I was expecting better from the History Channel. Their stock just lost a little value in my book. I suppose one should remember that the History Channel is an ENTERTAINMENT company and that if they rub people the wrong way by refuting a popular (though completely incorrect) theory wouldn't win them any brownie points.

In conclusion, the documentary is interesting, but not valuable if one is looking for actual facts to help them decide about this ""global warming"" chatter the talking heads and Al Gore spout.",1280016000,9,2377,5.051020408163265
3031372,5,B000YKI4MM,"This is a great overview on the findings of past global climates, and how the past could be the tell-tale of future occurrences.  The great part of this movie is that it also delves into how the past climates are found... it scratches the surface on each technique, and only gives examples in one area of findings, but the amount of information in this movie makes it a necessity.  As a high school Earth science teacher, this is a staple for my classroom.  The information is invaluable, and the students are no longer bounced around the topic politically, like a ping pong ball.  Again, this is a lot of information, so i split it into two days... most movies require an accompanying worksheet front and back, this movie takes two front/back worksheets.",1275264000,5,755,4.696969696969697

If you want to understand why global warming is real and why we need to address the issue now, this is your documentary. It is substance, substance, substance. No grandstanding, no histrionics, no tear-jerking moments. Just a carefully made and compellingly presented factual case for global warming and the possible/probable outcomes from failing to address it.

This is what I thought I was going to get with ""An Inconvenient Truth"", which is riddled with Al Gore self-aggrandizement and self-pity.
