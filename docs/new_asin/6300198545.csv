7804702,4,6300198545,"I'm not super-familiar with this show, but I do know that it was originally in black-&-white and that this video version is colorized. It doesn't look great, but it doesn't look awful either. I mean, obviously it's watchable; but if you're looking to re-experience the program as it was originally broadcast, this is not the best option. (Of course, you could just turn down the color on your TV set...)

From what I can tell, this is three separate episodes edited together to create a 'feature' length program. They're all sort of related, in that they involve the little boy and Rin-Tin-Tin (""Rinny!"") dealing with the Native Americans (Indians here), who are generally sympathetic, as well as villainous white men (Leo Gordon, always memorable, plays an avaricious buffalo-hunting settler in the final portion of the program).

It's fun to watch old shows like this, to see what TV was like before I was born, and this is fare that is perfectly suited for younger viewers (obviously, as they were the original target audience). I have two young children and they found it surprisingly engaging (at least for the first half or so).

A pleasant trip down memory lane.",1412035200,,1169,4.893939393939394
