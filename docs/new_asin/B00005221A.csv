7929667,4,B00005221A,"The first Slayers OVA series was based on the Slayers Special prequal manga taking place before the first Slayers TV anime. It was 3-episodes long, which was first released in English through ADV Films as two separate VHS volumes(Dragon Slave and Explosion Array), and then later on in a collected DVD titled Slayers: The Book Of Spells.

Taking place sometime after Lina and Naga reunited from Slayers Excellent, their first adventure has Lina almost dying of the sheer shock of a crafty alchemist who created ten clones of Naga in order to subdue Lina to use her as part of a crazy looking giant chimera in order to take over the world. The real Naga eventually catches up to them and her clones bond to her like bees to a queen, and they go to rescue Lina. The next adventure sees our heroines being hired to help an aspiring wouldbe knight to join the royal guard, but continuously being confronted by his mother makes the situation nearly impossible. The final chapter has Lina and Naga hunting down a renegade sorcerer who plans to use a magic mirror to make reverse copies of any adversary he comes across, except that when he uses it on our girls it produces embarrassingly peaceful versions of them who do nothing but cry and plead for peace, leaving the world with yet another wandering Naga copy.

Slayers Special(as its originally called in Japan)works out as a good intro to the world of Lina Inverse in her travels, even though the OVAs and movies operate on a different tempo than the TV series, sometimes taking a little more time in drawing out the comedy instead of following along with a season-long story arc. The animation is just as good as the first few Slayers movies, although the third episode seems to suffer a little too much like being a promo for the OVA soundtrack with some AMV segments added in for padding. Worth a look on its own, or combined with the Slayers Excellent OVA collection.",1464480000,,1920,4.644117647058824

7929669,4,B00005221A,"I love this series. And I have a strange affinity for Naga....Hmmm.. I wonder what it could be. I love how Lina calls Naga the ""Bondage Queen of Darkness"". Also that outfit of hers....My god... The only thing I can't stand is that ridiculous laugh of hers. It drives me mad.. But still, it's a very funny anime. You really should see it if you enjoy animes, or comedy...or both",1073779200,3,377,4.4
7929670,4,B00005221A,"I enjoyed this DVD, especially the last episode entitled Mirror, Mirror.
If you are a Slayers fan, you might be a little put off by this series at first, and if you don't like Naga's laugh, then I warn you NOT to watch the first episode.
Still it was amusing, althought I did find Jefferies Knighthood to be comical, it was kind of cliche at times.",996364800,4,348,4.287878787878788
7929671,5,B00005221A,"These three episodes were from the novel Slayers Special, and were originally named Slayers Special 1,2,3. The plots is not related to the Slayers, Slayers Next and Slayers Try TV series (TV series were from the original Slayers novel, not the Slayers SP novel).
Compared to the TV series, episodes in this disk (and the movies) are more funny, short and have less of conspiracies. You'll see their funny acts all the time in this disk, and the castings are wonderful. It show you the full potential of what Lina and Naga are capable in their day-to-day works (what a life!)
If there is anything disatisfy me in these episodes, it's the length. If will certainly make you want to see more episodes like these, but this is all what have with Slayers Special (Books of Spells) now and they're short episodes - but they're good.
One more thing, they share the same ED song - but this song, by Hayashibara Megumi / Lina Inverse - is exceptionally good.",989020800,17,948,4.615384615384615
7929672,5,B00005221A,"Okay, I have to say as a die-hard Slayers fan I was a little disturbed when I saw this... but there are so many great inside jokes I couldn't stop laughing! The three-episode flashback series has a slightly different feel to it than Slayers, NEXT, and TRY but it comes through. Though I don't like the alternative to Lisa Ortiz for Lina's voice, it's okay.
Scary Chimera Plan is hilarious and we get to see 11 Naghas laugh for 10 mins straight, so plug your ears! There are so many slap-stick jokes I could've died.
Jeffrey's Knighthood was the scariest thing I've ever seen. Nothing like an overprotective mother who will smash you with a mallot from hammarspace if you so much as say a word against her ""talented, handsome"" boy.
Mirror, Mirror was hilarious. If you've ever wanted to know what a ""sniveling humanitarian"" Lina or a demure, blushing Nagha, here's your chance. I garuntee you won't be sorry!

7929673,4,B00005221A,"This DVD contains three OAV episodes from Slayers.  The episodes take place before the original Slayers TV series, so Lina is a bit younger in these episodes (although it does not appear to be so).
I am a huge fan of Slayers, but not so big on Naga.  She has the most annoying laugh known to man and the first episode ""The Scary Chimera Plan"" exploits that laugh beyond it's limits.  Other than that laugh, the DVD deserves five stars.
The company that put out this DVD, ADV, is notorius for their awful dubs (Evangelion is a prime example).  Unfortunately, ADV subjected the awesome Slayers to the reputation as well.  I highly suggest the original Japanese voices (Megumi Hayashibara does the best job, and personally, she is my favorite).
Overall, this DVD is highly recommended if you are a Slayers fan.  If not, you will be one very soon.",981244800,5,843,4.624161073825503
7929674,4,B00005221A,"This DVD is a real treat for those of you who liked the Slayers Movie and OAV's. This DVD is a collection of a few of the OAV's including Explosion Array, The Training of Jeffery, as well as a others. Pick this DVD as soon as you can, especially all you Naga fans out there.",975888000,6,274,4.0
