900450,5,6304570392,"My dad was at the Ice Bowl and speaks of his adventure often.  I was a very young and don't remember much about it.  I bought the video as a present for my Dad.  Together, we watched the video.  What a great time we had.  There were many game highlights.  We especially enjoyed all the player commentary and sidenotes about the game, the conditions, etc.  My dad never likes to watch movies twice, or especially sporting events twice.  He throughly enjoyed re-living this one!  If you know someone that was there, you have got to get this one for them.  Any Packer fan, even if they were not there, would love to see this.",1011571200,6,622,4.37719298245614
900451,5,6304570392,"The ice bowl is the first football game I have clear memory of. This tape,which is very well done, sets s up the game by showing what happened the year before in the championship game in Dallas,and how the Cowboys were ready to avenge that loss. Also, juxtaposed nicely, are the story of the 1967 packers, in the final year of their glory under Vince Lombardi. The tape brings the voice of Ray Scott,longtime voice of the packers and the NFL before the corporate suits took over the broadcast booth with ex jocks. The the game itself is shown virtually in its entirity, with clever voiceover by Scott sounding very much .like it did that day. With the temperature being -16 below zero, the players and fans literally were trying to survive as well as win. This is the best of the NFL tapes that I have seen,perhaps because of the seminal importance of the game,or simply for nostalgic reasons. Either way, this is an excellent tape and a good bargain,considering that you are likely to re-watch a sports tape. And, listening to the voice of the great Ray Scott is a distinct pleasure.",985219200,49,1084,4.592783505154639

900701,3,6304570392,"It's hard to review a video on your team loosing the championship but, I enjoyed watching the 58 Championship Game anyways. The positive thing was that the Giants came back to take a lead 17 to 14 lead in the 4rth quarter over comming Frank Giffords 3 Fumbles. The other fact I didn't know was that Baltimore was spying on the Giants practices and learned that the Giants were going to use the same 4-3 Defence that was used to beat Cleveland twice. Unitas to Berry seem to be unstopable during the game. After my 2nd attempt of ordering this tape I still think it was worth waiting for. You will enjoy the commentaries from both teams on this game.",1336262400,,649,4.416666666666667
900702,5,6304570392,"This series from NFL Films gives us an insight into much more than the game itself...it gives us a very thoughtful glimpse into our national character at the time.  One of the scenes which impressed me the most was an exchange between Coach Lombardi and QB Bart Starr.  This was long before the now sadly common practice of player superstars ""coping a 'tude"" with their coaches, the media, and the public.  The exchange between Lombardi and Starr sounded much more like a conversation between a commanding general and one of his field captains, with Starr responding with a respectful ""Yes, Sir!"" as Lombardi gave him instructions for the next series of plays.

Thoroughly fascinating.",1332633600,2,685,4.982456140350878
900703,5,6304570392,"i have waited years to get the ""ice bowl"", a game i consider the greatest ever played. okay, so i am a biased packers fan. i admit it. it's just that we suffered so many years of heartache until 1997. i was still pretty young when the packers were at their greatest in the 1960's. plus to get the complete history of the packers was a treat. any old packers games from that era i would most definitely consider buying. excellent disc, and received very promptly. keep up the good work!

900705,4,6304570392,"Seeing most of the plays from this iconic game is really a thrill. The video shows most of the plays, and the camera work back then was surprisingly good. In fact, in many ways, it was just as good as it is today.

My problem with this video is all of the talking heads. I really wish that the game was presented as if it were being played. Instead, there are too many players, coaches, and commentators waxing nostalgically almost continuously--and the way they do it, you often get an idea what's about to happen in the game, which kills a lot of the excitement. The plays are also too tightly edited, and so you lose the pacing of the game.

That said, if you're a Green Bay fan, or a Dallas fan--or just a fan of pro football, you really have to see this tape.

NFL Films, if you're listening (hah), there must be a market for full-length, historic games. Please leave the commentary for half time and post game, like a real football game.",1284768000,3,943,4.346590909090909
900706,5,6304570392,"That was why I bought this product and I loved it. The Ice Bowl was the coldest game in NFL history. Basically it was the original broadcast game, but with commentary by players. I was not disappointed! The other disc contained the history of the team, which I found very educational, I learned a lot about the team from this product.

The other dvd is a recreation of the famous ""Ice Bowl"". My husband loved it, I loved it! My husband has videos that show bits and pieces of the game but not in it's entirety like this one does.

900770,5,6304570392,"I ordered this video for my husband, who is a die-hard Packers fan (he can name evey player and their position on the Ice Bowl team), who had talked for years about how important the team, and this game in particular, was to him during his childhood. He was completely thrilled to have the video.",1179014400,,296,4.4
900771,2,6304570392,"NFL Films produces some good stuff, so I picked up this two disk set.  I was disappointed in nearly every aspect of this set.  First, the ""history"" is a typical NFL film with lots of game footage and the kind of music you would expect to hear on something like ""Inside the NFL.""  How could anyone possibly call this a ""complete history,"" when the main feature (covering a period of nearly 80 years) is just under 60 minutes!  Little to nothing is said on the years between Lambeau and Lombardi and between Lombardi and Holmgren.  Infante is not even mentioned.  Relatively little biographical information is presented on Lambeau, Lombardi, or anyone else, and there was surprisingly little shown of Lombardi other than him stalking the sidelines.  If you are a Green Bay Packer's fan, chances are you already know everything presented in the ""complete history,"" and have probably seen much of the footage in other contexts.

The special features on disk 1 are laughably week and not worth mentioning.  Given how little there really is on disk 1 (60 minutes for the feature and perhaps 25 minutes of extras) one wonders why there are two disks at all.  Disk 2 is a different story.  It's main feature is an approximately 75 minute feature (and a few extras) on the Ice Bowl, which is excellent in both quality and detail.  In my opinion, it puts the first disk to shame.

In the end, I cannot recommend buying this set.  The Green Bay Packers have a long, rich history that deserves far better than an incomplete and pitiful 60 minute NFL films treatment.  If you buy this set, but it for the Ice Bowl feature.",1177113600,7,1609,4.636042402826855
900772,5,6304570392,"Being a native Texan, I am actually a Cowboy fan. However, I am married to a die-hard Packers fan and have thus come to appreciate the team's history and tradition over the years.

The disc on the history of the team was interesting, especially the very early years from the team's founding in 1919 until the arrival of Vince Lombardi in the late 1950's. Given today's corporate mentality it is interesting to note that the Packers were founded and coached by the same man - Curly Lambeau, who also played the position of halfback for the Packers during the team's early years. The history did brush over the years from the late 1960's to the early 1990's, but then these were such disheartening years for the Packers that this is understandable. The history gets more in detail again with the arrival of Holmgren and Favre in Green Bay, and continues through to the Mike Sherman years and the building of the new stadium.

Of course, the real reason to own this set is for the reconstructed version of the Ice Bowl. Fortunately, although I am old enough to barely remember the Ice Bowl, I am not old enough to be as bitter about it as my parents are, so I could watch the segment on the Ice Bowl and appreciate it for the history and for the titan struggle between two great teams that it was. Overall, there are about 40 or so minutes of the 60 minute game shown, and NFL Films has done a good job of piecing the game together so that it doesn't appear to be a patched and spliced up job. It has a real feeling of continuity about it and the video quality is quite good for such old footage. The film conveys the mood of the players and what it was like to play on a field in such conditions through interviews with the players, officials, and some of the broadcasters that were there. Apparently, each time a player fell it was like landing on jagged concrete. Whistles had to be abandoned by the officials due to the cold, and the planned halftime show was also impossible. Also, the film finally confirmed an ""urban legend"" that I had heard about for years. There really was someone on the sidelines that poured themselves a cup of coffee, turned around to do something else, and when they went back to their coffee it had frozen solid with the spoon in it, forming a coffee-sickle. There is also footage of the post-game show featuring interviews with various Green Bay players including Bart Starr, and also footage of the post-game interview with the legendary Lombardi.

What really impressed me watching this film is how obvious it is that the level of remuneration in the league has escalated since the Ice Bowl was played forty years ago. This really shows in how the Packers choose to celebrate after the game. The segment on the Ice Bowl closes with Lombardi celebrating with family and friends in his wood-paneled rec room - it was nothing fancier than you would find in any middle class three-bedroom two-bath home. It was truly the end of an era ""when pride still mattered"". I'd highly recommend this set for any Packer fan.",1176336000,4,3041,4.545620437956204
900773,4,6304570392,"Overall, this DVD set is pretty good!  The only reason it's not 5 stars is that they completely gloss over the Infante years.  Sure, they weren't great years by any stretch of the imagination, but in order for it to be a ""complete"" history it should have been covered.",1111363200,2,268,4.448979591836735
900774,5,6304570392,"Was all I needed for this one. The aforementioned segment mentioned can be described succintly: LOMBARDI. After reading David Marniss' ""When Pride Still Mattered"" - A must read, purchasing the DVD was a no brainer, just for the Lombardi excerpt.

The ICE BOWL brings out all kinds of emotions. I am a Cowboy fan, so it kind of hurts to watch the 3rd-and-1 Starr sneak (Kramer moved;). Few people realize the psychological damged it did to Dallas, it took them four years to recover.  But those sentiments get tempered in viewing this classic contest. Though I was only one years of age at the time of this classic, the footage alone has me calling this the best game ever.",1110758400,7,672,4.638655462184874
900775,5,6304570392,"DVD #1 presents a terrific hour-long history of the franchise.  It hits both the high- and lowpoints, and indicates why the Packers are a national treasure and probably the greatest team in NFL history.  Lambeau, Hutson, Lombardi, Starr, Nitschke, the Ice Bowl, Favre, White, the nine NFL championships, the three Super Bowls they won (I, II, and XXXI), and the one they lost (XXXII).  The best fans in the league, the smallest venue, the most legendary stadium, and the team's miraculous survival over 80+ years, in no small part because they are the only pro team in any sport that is entirely owned by their fans.  The highpoint, of course, is the 15-minute section entitled ""Lombardi"" which encapsulates the Green Bay career of the NFL's greatest coach--but at the end of this DVD about the Packers' heroic ongoing history, you realize that as great as Lombardi was, the team is greater still.

DVD #2 was produced earlier in VHS format (I bought it at the Packer Pro Shop in GB) and portrays the greatest game in Packers history and one of the greatest in NFL history. Other reviewers have justly praised its play-by-play reconstruction and modern-day interviews with the participants.  Yes, Kramer was offside--but luck is a part of any game, and the Cowboys had a generous helping of it in the second quarter.  Like another reviewer, I love the postgame interviews, even the glimpses of Green Bay in 1967.  The muted colors of the frigid game (maybe Packer jerseys actually were that dark in the 60s--I see the same thing in footage of other games) and the elegaic tone of the final interviews give a haunting sense of a world that is now departed.",1106265600,31,1655,4.782456140350877

900777,4,6304570392,"Not much can be added to the other online reviews listed here. Two things that amaze me to this day are: 1. CBS Sports either never bothered to videotape the entire game, or else they erased and lost the broadcast videotape. 2. The fact the NFL Films 16mm camera equipment did not completely freeze up from the cold during the game.

7874502,5,6304570392,"After losing the NFL Championship game to the Eagles, Coach Lombardi told his players it would never happen again.  And it didn't.  Five Championships in 7 years, and 5 for 5 in the NFL Championship Game (7 for 7 when you include the first two inter-league championship games, not yet called the Super Bowl).  The Ice Bowl, IMHO, is the best documentary on ANY NFL game, and one could argue it was the best game ever, even if the final touchdown should have been disallowed for a ""False Start"" penalty.  The non-called penalty is clearly shown in stop action.  In fact, the entire Packer history, not just the wins, are detailed up to the date of the production, unlike many other ""History of"" NFL team productions.  This is the best of the ""History of"" series, and no football fan should be without it.  In the case of the Ice Bowl, it's better (less painful) than being there at the game.",1453939200,,890,4.525
