8436044,2,B004MGS6GS,"I have a number of Highball products and this is the only one I can truly say that I regret purchasing. The entire film seems like it was not professionally recorded -as if they had someone else do their recording for them. They spent way too much time with the camera looking out the back end of the train and not near enough time on anything else.

I truly was amazed at how much I disliked it!  I say this because Highball usually gives us such high quality filming, but none of it is found here.

I don't mean to be so negative, but I was really disappointed with this one.",1346803200,,577,4.18018018018018
8436045,5,B004MGS6GS,"What an amazing ride! I had always wanted to take that trip, but this is definitely the next best thing to it. This area is truly some of the most beautiful I've ever seen and some of it can't be seen any other way. This is rugged territory.

There is a choice between a narrated ride with music or just the sounds of the train. The train sounds were real and effectively made us feel we were really on board.

We started out slowly and I noticed we were much closer to the scenery than I had thought we would be.  As we passed by, we could see the grass and weeds in so much detail I thought I was going to start sneezing.  Then we were in the car helping shovel in more coal. The crew stayed pretty busy during the entire trip. They worked hard and apparently they had lots of work to do. They seemed like a friendly, good-natured group. I was just hoping they knew what they were doing once we started up those narrow, steep rocky slopes.

The scenery was magnificent! We followed the Animas River and from time to time crossed on bridges over it, sometimes much higher than I would have liked. It couldn't have been more beautiful. There were times when I thought, ""I believe I'll get out and walk now, please"" and other times when I thought I might prefer to get out and crawl down the mountains. This virtual train ride is terrifyingly realistic!

As we followed the rushing river and ride past clear mountain lakes, I could imagine that people who like to fish thought they had died and gone to Heaven! At some points we were up in the clouds, literally. I was still holding on for dear life, not quite ready to go to Heaven yet, as we traveled higher than I'm comfortable going, at times moving through areas where it appeared we just barely cleared some of the rocks, and I was hoping we didn't have any rock-slides.

The ""real"" passengers seemed to really be enjoying themselves and we could hear them talking and laughing at times. I kept remembering all those old movies with the runaway trains, which seemed perfectly likely to happen on some of those steep upgrades.

We stopped at one point while the crew did maintenance, adding oil, takes on water, etc., and off we went again. Toward the end one of the crew members who is on the ground yelled to our crew from the ground that we were going to the ""new mudslide."" We were MUCH closer to the ground at this point and it was a pleasant ride.

We passed beautiful waterfalls, more rushing streams and rivers,  most of them inviting enough to make a fisherman cry because he didn't have his fishing pole. There were all sorts of beautiful evergreen trees and snow-covered mountains, and we got to see a great deal of all of it as we traveled the winding tracks, the train whistle warning as we came around each bend. Then we were back up at the treeline before beginning our descent into a gorgeous canyon. Then we see town up ahead and we're back to civilization again, safe and sound.  Whew!  I can breathe again.

I then tried the ride again, with narration this time. The narrator has a pleasant voice and gives an introduction with detailed history and information. He's quiet most of the time, but lets us know what we are seeing as we pass certain points. Today I'm too exhausted to watch it all the way through again since it's a fairly long ride, but I think I'll do that tomorrow as I work out on my exercise equipment. It sounds like the narration is worth hearing. I would like to know more about some of the places we went.",1269129600,3,3500,4.382716049382716
