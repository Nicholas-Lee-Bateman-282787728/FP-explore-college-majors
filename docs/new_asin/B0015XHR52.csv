Gay themed short films can be so dull. Not here!
This compilation of gay shorts is actually quite impressive and offers a wide array of emotions from funny to sexy to touching to heart-breaking.
With talented filmmakers like this, our film genre has nothing to fear in the future!
Great selection, Wolfe!",1221782400,11,328,4.875
8260450,4,B0015XHR52,"In Wolfe Video's latest compilation of gay short films, we find an above-average assortment of seven international titles.  As usual, I'll rate each individually, with the overall review an average of all.

""Serene Hunter"" is a 2007 short film from France (subtitled in English), featuring the dilemma of a rather free-spirited man who enjoys chasing (and usually catching) attractive men for sex, but circumstances keep him from having the one young man he really loves.  Three stars out of five.

""Solace"" (US) shows an older and younger man who meet on the internet, and seem to get along well, until one reveals a secret that keeps them from what they both are seeking.  Four stars out of five.

A young man who was ""Scarred"" (UK) in a gaybashing attack has a problem bringing himself to date again.  A mutual friend introduces him to someone with whom he seems to have much in common.  Unfortunately, there is one connection neither one expected.  Four stars out of four.

You are only as old as you feel, but the outward ""Signage"" of middle age can be hidden somewhat with makeup and hair coloring, which encourages two best friends to plan a night out at a bar that caters to young men half their age.  One makes a strong connection with a young deaf guy, only to find out that there is more than one type of obstacle involved.  Four stars out of five.

First-date jitters in the age of internet dating is the subject of ""Mr_Right_22"" (Germany, 2007), but a kind waiter calms his fears and offers some encouragement to be open to life's opportunities. Cute.  Four stars out of four.

Two masculine friends take about ""41 Seconds"" (German w/subtitles, 2006) to compare notes on one of their dates, in which his girlfriend compared their respective skills as a kisser.  Only 4 minutes, but cute.  Five stars out of five.

Last but not least, ""Shahram & Abbas"" (Netherlands w/subtitles, 2006) are two Iranian refugees, a young student activist and an older journalist, who want to see political asylum in the Netherlands. Believing they have a better chance of being granted such if they claim to be a persecuted homosexual couple, they begin a charade that leads to complications they never imagined, especially when the younger Shahram falls for a woman also awaiting asylum. Powerful and positive depiction of a very sad and serious situation.  Five stars out of five.",1212883200,28,2375,4.805418719211823
8260451,5,B0015XHR52,"I'm impressed! This is the best compilation of gay short films I've seen to date. Fantastic job Wolfe Video. Not only is S for sexy - S is for shirtless, studly, specimens, (lots of) skin in seven, sensational stories. What more could we ask for?",1212537600,15,246,4.488888888888889
