3798566,5,B001UHO102,"Ten years since series 8 we finally get more smeggin' dwarf! This DVD is great because we actually get a widescreen 3-part special for the first time in superb high DVD quality. There's a lot of talk that there's a down side by not having a laugh track, and in some case that is right. I've only seen series SIX without the laugh track and thought that it wasn't that funny, but with the laugh track I enjoyed gags more. As with this special I also watched with and without an added laugh track..and I came to the conclusion that I really appreciated watching these great actors perform just as they did with out interruptions. Remember, that series SEVEN was also filmed without a live audience, but one was added in. I felt at first this project was rushed, but really found the team interesting in the behind the scenes action. Rumors I hear say this was made partly to help budget series NINE or that ""So-Called"" movie we've been hearing about for 20 years! lol! Just to keep up with my collection and for any support towards more future Red Dwarf series..this DVD is worth it!",1254009600,2,1081,4.49238578680203
3798567,5,B001UHO102,"The real triumph of ""Red Dwarf:  Back To Earth"":  They're BACK !!!!

Despite the 10-year hiatus since Series 8, Chris Barrie (Rimmer), Craig Charles (Lister), Danny John-Jules (Cat), and Robert Llewellyn (Kryten) have lost none of their old comic chemistry.  Congrats to all for returning in such fine comedic - and physical - form.

Individually and collectively the primary cast have grown even more skilled since we saw them last ... which they definitely needed here, because the BTE script gave them *little* to work with.  (Most complaints at the Amazon.co.uk website regarding BTE as broadcast, for instance, basically boil down to story/script problems.)

I shall spare you my own protracted diatribe about the weak BTE script.  Suffice it to say, my biggest frustration is how easily this script could have been better, both stronger and funnier.  The audience kept being offered seeds of potential genius ... but such `seeds' were never paid off by this script.  Just one example from many:  new character Katerina Bartikovsky - brilliantly brought to life by the refreshing and very talented Sophie Winkleman - was so delicious in all ways she presented a fantastic opportunity for wild, fun, and original new things, but she was given no character arc and sadly little to do.

The production values were refreshingly excellent despite next-to-no budget, kudos to D.P. Andy Martin and a worldwide VFX team led by Mike Seymour.  It is a pity, however, that as much attention was not paid to the story's substance, as its visual style.

So why, you may ask, am I still giving BTE a rating of 5 stars?

Reason #1 - Even with BTE's weak script, ""Red Dwarf"" is still funnier than anything else out there.

There are some bits in BTE which are absolutely ""classic `Dwarf' "".  Rimmer's unique solution to Katerina Bartikovsky, for instance, was so laugh-out-loud funny that our group of 40 Dwarf-ers new and old threatened to shake apart the building.  Or Cat, in the diving bell scene while all hell is breaking loose behind him.  Great, great stuff!  I, personally, laughed right out loud more than I had since ... well ... the last time I'd watched ""Red Dwarf""!

Reason #2 - The Cast.  This cast play off each other with such natural genius, just stand back and let `em rip!

The endlessly versatile Chris Barrie proves yet again that he's the funniest thing on two feet, deftly able to make something out of nothing (which he had to do a lot, in BTE).  Craig Charles has improved dramatic range, over years past.  Danny John-Jules impressed me with new layers of comic timing and subtlety.  Robert Llewellyn remains `Mr Nice Guy' personified.  Newcomer to the show Sophie Winkleman fit in so perfectly and brought so much to her role it was a real pleasure to watch her work and left the audience eager for more, and Jeremy Swift delighted with a small but `cherce' bit as a mad shop clerk.

Reason #3 - If all else fails, and BTE's story shortcomings still get you down, watch it with the DVD Cast Commentary.

Chris, Craig, Danny, and Robert know each other so well, and play off each other so perfectly, that they are frequently even more funny `unscripted' on the Commentary track than they are with dialogue written for the characters they play.  (I freely confess that watching with the Cast Commentary track ""on"" is the ONLY way - once beyond ""Tikka To Ride"" and the great ""Stoke Me A Clipper"", which gets my vote for Best Episode Ever - that I can get through Series 7 without falling asleep.)

Reason #4 - This DVD's extras/bonus features are especially varied, of general and specific interest, and well-done.

As we have come to expect from ""Red Dwarf"" releases, thanks to - Andrew Ellard, is it? - who assembles these consistently superior DVDs.  This DVD is surprisingly affordable and a great entertainment and educational value for its price.  I have so enjoyed the PAL version I bought in June upon initial UK release that I have pre-ordered the NTSC (Canada/US) version, too.  Here are some BTE extras I particularly recommend:

Cast Commentary (Disc One):  Episodes One, Two, and Three, exactly as broadcast, with the cast's own amusing commentary on what they did and what we see

Director's Commentary (Disc One):  ""Director's Cut"" omits intervening credits & titles, with a more technically-oriented commentary

""The Making of ..."" Documentary:  Part One is a short 24-minute version broadcast on Dave, of which a favourite highlight is Robert Llewellyn's description of how to cram four fully grown adult males into a Smart-For-Two car, otherwise known as Carbug - even the two big guys in the `back'!  Part Two (also on Disc Two) is 48 minutes, more good stuff on a different variety of topics.

Deleted Scenes, available with/without Director's Commentary.  (Includes a nice scene, sadly cut for time, between Rimmer and Katerina wherein we finally get an explanation ""why huge meteorites lying around Cargo Bays J, L, and K"" throughout all these years  ;-)

Featurettes on various subjects.  (The ""Carbug"" segment among the ""Behind the Scenes Web Videos"" is a definite Must See!)

Smeg Ups (Outtakes) - this contains my personal favourite moment on the whole DVD set.  All 4 of the `Boys From The Dwarf' are supposed to be running straight toward camera; the shot is blown on the first stride out when Kryten's leg falls off, Robert limps off to the side.  But pause at about 09:55, the look of sheer shared joy and laughter between Danny, Chris, and Craig - by all accounts three of the most differing personalities imaginable - it's a captured magic moment that reaffirms one's basic hope for humanity.

Now, perhaps more than ever, the world needs hope and laughter.  We need MORE DWARF!",1248566400,13,5723,4.853457172342622
3798568,4,B001UHO102,"--- possible spoilers! ---

This 3-part mini-series sort of ""wraps up"" (hah!  Well, maybe... :) ) the brilliant, long-running Red Dwarf TV series.  I like to think of it as a sort of a stop-gap (or maybe a fix for us fans) between the untimely end of the series and the still-struggling-to-be-born Red Dwarf Movie, on which I still have not given up hope!

By far, the best part was just seeing Lister, Rimmer, Kryten and Cat all back together again.  And, they all look just as good as they did twenty years ago.  You'd think Craig Charles hadn't aged a day, and Danny John-Jules has still got ALL the moves!  (Ladies, keep an eye out, in the ""making of"" special feature, for a shot of Cat from behind, wearing that pink spandex suit!!)  Even Starbug is still kicking around, well... sort of.  The scene showing the four striding toward us with ""starbug"" in the background literally chokes me up.  (Is that pathetic?  I don't care!  I'm a Dwarfer and I'm not ashamed! :) )

The plot still takes those kinds of wild, clever twists that always made the series so enjoyable.  Yes the boys do get back to earth but, as always happens with any of their endeavors, not quite the way they expect.  I got the biggest kick out of seeing their reaction to ""modern day"" culture.  Even in the regular series, their sidelong cracks on society were always the best, but seeing them make them while actually experiencing our culture was a twist on a twist!  The references to Coronation Street, Blade Runner, and (best of all!) Red Dwarf, are priceless and left me breathless!

I was really disappointed, however, not to see either Holly or Holly appear in the miniseries. *sigh*  His/her absence was accounted for adequately in the storyline, but it's just not the same without Holly.  Instead we get a Katerina Bartikovsky who I must admit did a really good job with her role, but somehow bringing in an ""expansion character"" at this juncture just didn't work for me.

One thing that seemed a little weird at first was the strange, airless quality of the sound of the miniseries.  The original series had many studio shots filmed in front of a live audience, and the location shots had a laugh track added into the background for continuity's sake.  But the miniseries had neither of these, so for the first half of the first segment I kept wondering why everything sounded so flat.  It just didn't have the same energy as the series.  Then I realized what was missing: the laughter!  Once I figured that out, it was less distracting.

I am always blown away at how this ""comedy"" which seems on the surface to be a cheap, slapstick space-opera, actually has so many profound things to say about the meaning of life etc.  This miniseries found subtle ways to make me go ""Hmm...."" even more often than some of the later episodes in the series did.  The final shot of Lister walking away from the car actually made me cry.  He may be disgusting, but sometimes he can be quite brave!

I do hope there will be a Series 10, or Red Dwarf The Movie... well, actually, I want both!",1247702400,3,3060,4.549450549450549
3798569,3,B001UHO102,"I'm a newcomer to the RED DWARF universe.  Utilizing Netflix (I usually buy almost everything I watch on DVD, but I thought these sets way overpriced) I started with Season One and worked my way all the way through Season Eight.  I then found a website that streamed these episodes.  Watching the episodes and then hitting some fan boards it became clear that while I enjoyed the show in its middle years (from Season Three when Kryten became a full time character to the end of Season Six), I was not the fan that many were.  Still, I even mildly enjoyed Seasons Seven and Eight and looked forward to what many are calling ""Season Nine.""  Heck, I'll even watch Season Ten if it materializes.

But being objective, this miniseries isn't very good.  First and foremost, there are a lot of dead moments, when either the pacing and timing isn't quite right, or the jokes just aren't working.  There are also some decent bits, but in the end it is more of a wash between the good and flat moments.  I suppose it is worth watching, especially if you are a fan of the series as a whole, but some fans might prefer to remember the show as it was.

I'm not quite sure why the miniseries was based on BLADE RUNNER.  None of the best bits of the show rely on its imitation of that film.  I mean, once you've caught on that they are imitating BLADE RUNNER, what else is there?  It just doesn't lead to anything.  It isn't good writing so much as a substitute for good writing.

Still, even if it isn't a terribly successful miniseries, it was great to see Lister, Kryten, Rimmer, and Cat all together again.  For me, at least, the group still works as an ensemble and I would welcome a continuance of the series.  I would just prefer stronger writing.",1246665600,5,1740,4.421383647798742

3798571,5,B001UHO102,"I'll freely admit that the original series got a bit stagnant from series 5 through 7, however I really felt that 8 shaped up to be a return to form.  Now, ten years later, we finally get more.  To be honest, it is best watched in one sitting as the first episode really introduces (or re-introduces) the characters we know and love and watching them individually does break up the flow a bit.  The story (and the funny) really picks up in the second ep and continues through the third.  In all, Back to Earth brings back much of what made the original series great and sets the stage for a new series nicely.  It left me wanting more without leaving me hanging.",1240876800,56,662,4.349593495934959
3798572,3,B001UHO102,"After waiting ten years for a Red Dwarf reunion, hearing rumours of another series or even a big-screen movie, fans' anticipation level for ""Back to Earth"" was VERY high.  I'm sure I'm not the only fan who, after viewing this 3-part episode, was left wondering if the wait was worth it.

(SPOILERS AHEAD)

While it is nice to have most of the cast back (including a too-late and too-brief turn by Chloe Annett), the magic that made Red Dwarf such fun is laregly missing.  It starts off promisingly enough, with Lister making Rimmer the butt of another in a series of practical jokes.  But when the main plot kicks in, a sinking feeling of deja vu sets in.  ""Back to Earth"" appropriates the plot from an earlier, better episode, ""Back to Reality.""  I won't give it all away, but if you've seen the earlier episode, the ""twist"" ending of this one won't come as a shock at all.

The other, only slightly lesser problem is that very little attempt is made to maintain the series' continuity.  It's been ten years (nine, according to an on-screen message) since the crew was left hanging at the end of ""Only the Good. . ."".  When ""Back to Earth"" begins, Rimmer is inexplicably a hologram again, Kochanski has been written out of the show, and the ship is back in deep space with the 4 lead players in place like nothing has changed.

So, you're thinking, this guy's given it 3 stars...is there ANYTHING good about it?  Well, yes.  For starters, everyone looks like they've barely aged, which is just short of miraculous considering the first episode of Red Dwarf aired 21 years ago.  And even though the script gives them little of note to work with, the actors slip back into their roles with ease.  Production values are generally high, although a CGI skutter in place of the old animatronic one will make long-time fans cringe.

As a long-time fan, I'd certainly be thrilled if this led to a revival of the series.  I just hope the writers can come up with some fresh and FUNNY ideas, or they should let Red Dwarf rest in peace.",1240012800,50,2026,4.537190082644628

At times their attempts to lard on the ironic funny were tooth-achingly twee.

Three episodes make for a short viewing experience too.

But that said, the cast do a bang up job with what they have to work with, and there are some genuinely side-splitting moments.

The extra features, behind the scenes stuff and featurettes, make it better value for money, but if you had to drop one RD product from your want list this would be the one in my opinion.

I doubt if we will ever see an 11th season.  The BBC cannot get it together and they do not seem to realize the killer hit they had when they had it.  The older the cast gets, the less likely there will ever be another season.
Sad if you think about it because it was great escape.  Fantastic writing, producing and acting.

Maybe it was the fact after following the exploits of the Red Dwarf crew for many many years, they turn out to be just fictional characters conjured up for a TV series.  Yes I know they are really only fictional characters, but to me they are people that I have come to love (though I don't know about Rimmer) as they meander through space and time.

I've watched a good deal of British humor and American humor, and while I seem to prefer the British humor, this seems like it would do extremely well with American viewers, if only it was more available.  The fact that this is a Sci-Fi makes it all the more rare.  They do a great job of blending top level humor with a Sci-Fi that doesn't leave you depressed after putting you through a serious fear of doom or some other horror that just about all Sci-Fi's do since the earlier Star Trek.days.

Personally, I believe that most Red Dwarf fans could have come up with a better script. ** Spoiler Alert ** Just off of the top of my head, when the crew is in the ""real"" world seeking out the actors who portray them, I would have like to have seen them meet (for example) Chris Barrie portraying himself as the ""Ace - Smoke me a kipper"" Rimmer persona and Danny John-Jules as Duane Dibbley.

But on subsequent viewings, I really liked this return to the Red Dwarf universe.  It holds together nicely as a story and, if seen more as an homage to Blade Runner and the Red Dwarf series, it's actually tightly written and fun with many references to enjoy.  There are some great gags and quite touching moments, as well as the more traditional sci-fi themed zaniness.

3798714,5,B001UHO102,"One of the many threads running through the entire Red Dwarf series is how totally clueless the characters are.  The least thing almost literally makes them forget who and where they are.  Were it not for that, the convoluted series of events in this movie simply wouldn't work.  They're faced with what seems like absolute proof that, not only are they not who they thought they were, but that they don't even exist!  The way they get through it is the way they've always managed to get through these little existential blips: they keep plodding on, just as if they were real entities and really existed. Of course, they are real; and in the past they have gotten themselves into a parallel universe situation.  But in this parallel universe they exist as nothing more than fictional characters whose existence depends entirely on the whim of their creator, who they must track down in order to retain both their identity and existence.

The movie is basically a series of events they go through and people they meet on their way to finding their creator.  There is an absolutely wonderful segment which has Dave Lister encounter two young kids on a bus - a boy and a girl; the boy fully understands Lister's heartbreak at losing Kochanski.  And, as you might expect, their final encounter with their creator is a no-holds-barred, pull-out-all-the-stops existential confrontation of epic proportions, after which they goof around a bit then go home to their own reality - aware at last that, yes, they really do exist and really do have their own place in their own universe.

I only watched the first episode of 'Back to Earth'; but that was enough. They may as well have put brand new actors in the roles, as at least they may have injected some new life into this travesty. When will comedy writers learn that VERY few shows have a shelf-life beyond about a dozen episodes (even the great Cleese realised that Fawlty Towers couldn't ride on the crest of a wave forever). I LOVE Red Dwarf, but honestly, after Rimmer left, the crucial momentum had been lost (much as I enjoyed Chloe Annett as eye-candy).

3798717,4,B001UHO102,"Had just received the boxed set of the complete Red Dwarf series I-VIII and watched the first series (for probably the eleventeenth time) when I decided to check out ""Back to Earth"" on Amazon Instant Video. The surprise? ""Back to Earth"" did not suffer at all by comparison to Series I. As for the continuity issues, I'd already been inoculated against any discombobulation by the glaring ones between the end of Series I and the beginning of Series II, not to mention those between the end of Series VI and the beginning of Series VII. (Yes, these were explained after a fashion, but in a deliberately quick and dirty way that made it quite clear that Grant/Naylor and Naylor were not about to be hamstrung by such things.) ""Back to Earth"" did seem like a scaled-down version of the feature film Naylor had hoped to make, and frankly I was glad to be able to see it play out in TV form. It was able to focus on the heart of the concept, the tragicomic situation of Lister, without it getting lost in a lot of cinematic froo-fraw. And Part Three gives one of Red Dwarf's main inspirations the thorough twitting it's long been asking for. If there's any downside, it's that Rimmer, Cat and Kryten are rather relegated to being Lister's spear carriers. And while an explanation is at hand for this--and proves to be the key to the whole business--the story does have Lister do something singularly shocking. (Maybe two somethings, depending on how you feel about what Lister also does to Rimmer--I mean, how much punishment does one incorrigibly smegheaded hard-light hologram deserve?)",1330041600,2,1583,4.739130434782608
3798718,3,B001UHO102,"The 2009 3-part special is a very mixed bag. The show starts strongly with some character orientated gags set on the small rouge one but, by the midpoint of episode 2, the plot starts to disintegrate and actually becomes too ambitious for its own good. It juggles far too many ideas, and ultimately fails to execute any of them to their full potential. But, if you keep your expectations down, there's plenty to like. The cast clearly relished the opportunity to get back in the Dwarf and do a fantastic job despite the absence of an audience to perform to. The CGI and special effects are very good for cable TV, especially on a minimal budget. However, I'm sorry to say the good is outweighed by what went wrong. The plot is full of holes, and when you find out (or as I did, guess) what is really going on, it leaves you deflated (it doesn't make sense, even by Red Dwarf standards). The Blade Runner homage is fine, but doesn't really generate any comedy and isn't particularly well handled, rendering it largely pointless. Back To Earth's constant self-referencing of the series is also a hinderance. The series has fallen into the trap of re-using material in the past with questionable results, leaving you wishing that something a little more original might have made the Dwarfers return a real triumph.",1329264000,,1311,4.7043478260869565

Comedy science fiction must be a difficult thing to write well because you rarely see it done and even more rarely find it written well but the television series was a hit on both accounts. The Back to Earth movie, however, was at best a lazy attempt at reproducing the magic that was Red Dwarf and at worst a malicious stab at the heart of everything that made people love the show. So many things I liked about the series are corrupted. Its other-worldliness is gone by having it on Earth; the relationship with Kochanski is over; the postulation about the future where Lister and the cat are all that is left and which is surprisingly hopeful, suddenly becomes farce when the Red Dwarf characters find the reason for their existence. Where is the laugh track? Where is the music?

Writing remains sharp and the acting is wonderful except for perhaps an overly emotional Dave Lister.

The latter half of the film is a hilarious and loving homage to Blade Runner.  I laughed many times at the wonderfully done Blade Runner scenes acted out by the Dwarfers.  Staging and sets were wonderful, especially all of the Blade Runner scenes which are perhaps even artier than Ridley Scott's.  They are amazing for their economy and beauty.  The scene in the creator's bedroom was basically three set elements plus beautiful lighting and filming.  It alone is a real work of art.  The writing and acting for that scene is wonderful too; a genuine science fiction thought experiment, as usual.

There are themes of existentialism, breaking down the fourth wall, self-reference, parallel universes, and other wonderful science and science fiction elements throughout.",1314316800,3,1051,5.093567251461988

So much of the movie makes fun of an incredible amount of Blade Runner that if don't like Blade Runner or aren't terribly familiar with it, much of the movie won't make a lot of sense.

3798728,4,B001UHO102,"I miss the Red Dwarf laugh track. Having it gone was almost like having the theme song missing. I really would never have thought I'd say that about a show, but without it Red Dwarf just didn't really feel like Red Dwarf. I put off watching this show for a long while, having heard so many bad opinions about this from various people on the internet. People were so mixed about it that I kind of hesitated to have my warm fuzzy feelings of the series impacted by this, but I finally sat down & watched it.

No worries, for the most part this was pretty good. It didn't follow the last season for some reason, but it kept the whole dark & serious atmosphere that the show seemed to have developed towards the end. The absence of the laugh track really seemed to hammer this home since there was no laughter to lighten the mood.

Anyway, story-wise this miniseries was pretty interesting. Our boys escape to an alternate earth in an attempt to stay alive but discover that in this reality they're just characters on a popular TV show & that the plot has them dying by the show's end. Unhappy with this, they decide to take charge & find the writer so they can beg for more life. It's an interesting enough premise & everyone looks like they were having quite a bit of fun with it. I have to say, Chris Barrie looked to be having the most fun out of all of them & looked quite at home here.

It's just that this didn't entirely capture the feeling of the previous seasons. I didn't mind that it didn't pick up after the last episode, but something just seemed to be missing here. It's got everything I'd want but this just seemed to be missing the spirit of Red Dwarf.

It's fair to say that series 7 & 8 had deteriorated in quality to the point of turning off many long term fans. The series 8 finale was a poor cliffhanger that promised more Dwarf, but none came. With BTE Doug Naylor has cleverly reset the series, brought it back to the screen and to people's attention and if just for that alone, BTE is a great addition to Red Dwarf. This 3 part series certainly differs from existing Red Dwarf - there's no audience, it's very cinematic and there's a more serious tone. It's the 2000's version of RD. Some hated the changes, some liked the. For me it's a special RD so I'm okay with them.

I hope that Grant/Naylor productions now go on to create an all new series, bringing back the audience, witty dialog and genius sci-fi writing. Remember Doug, story and sci-fi first, decent looking special effects second!",1288656000,,1124,4.478048780487805

It didn't really end the series, but left yet more questions unanswered.

Back to Earth seemed to lack the magic that made us fans of the series in the first place.  I couldn't help but feel that I wasted my time in watching it, because it didn't end anything.  If anything, it made it necessary to make yet more episodes of Red Dwarf to finish off the series in some meaningful way.  As it stands, Back to Earth just left us wondering about the future of the Dwarf Crew, instead of granting us a sense of finality that should come with a concluding series of episodes.  What the smeg happened?  is what I'm left saying after watching this series.

I'm about the last fan of Red Dwarf to find out about this existing and accidentally came across it on the flix. I didn't really know if it aired originally as a 3 part series or movie but it works better as a movie to be seen all at once.
That said, it is a great way to bring closure on the phenomenon that is Red Dwarf. I've been watching it since the early 1990s when I was a little boy in London. I came to the USA and vaguely recalled watching the final 2 seasons in the late 90s on PBS13/Channel 21 in NYC on friday nights. A few years back I got the DVD set for Xmas and watched all eight seasons as an adult marvelling how still entertained I was and how Red Dwarf was and still is one of the best Sci Fi series of all time. I was dissapointed with the way the series closed out, but the final seasons had the best episodes of the collection since season one. What ""Back To Earth"" does is not continue were we left off in 1998 or 1999 but create something new here. The slapstick comedy has indeed toned down a bit, but the sci fi is still exciting and drives the plot. In fact, Red Dwarf has two fan sets, those who love it for the comedy and those, like me, who find the actual science that the series uses so well to drive the plot to be the most entriguing part of the series. Imagine a show that takes Quantum Mechanics, Astro physics, Physiological Psychology, Engineering and grinds it all up to make a genuinely entertaining comedy whiles poking fun at Star Trek, Star Wars, Stargate and other generic Space operas.
That said, I sat down with Back To Earth not knowing what to expect and not seeing any previous Red Dwarf episodes since 2006 and I was very much entertained and glad the story went this way. It is a NEW story, NEW plot and uses all the old main characters well. I also loved the love story between Kochanski and Lister and although it was touched upon briefly I am happy with how that was sorted.
I actually LOVED the ending because I wasn't expecting that and for a 22 year old TV series to suprise me and catch me off guard with an incredible plot twist in 2010 (after the art of the plot twist has been beaten to death by shows like LOST, 24, etc...) I must give it 5 stars.

Besides the movie feeling like nothing more thatn a plug for itself. You lose alot of comidic timing without the live audiance, or laugh track, which ever they used in the show. but I don't want to seem all negative about it. There are still some classic one liners, some off the wall situations, and alot of ripping on rimmer. If your a fan of the red it's a must.

3798755,3,B001UHO102,"As a huge fan of the entire series, which is still funny 21 years after it started and a decade after it finished, I admit that I had rather high expectations of this mini-series.

Unfortunately, those expectations weren't even close to being fulfilled. Things start off well enough; the usual hijinks from the Boys from the Dwarf. Continuity? We don't need that. Just bring on the funny. As a previous review mentioned, everyone looks exactly like they have for the entire series. No small feat considered the time span involved. After the first 10 minutes or so, when the joy at seeing the characters back on the screen fades, you begin to notice that something is horribly, terribly wrong. The jokes just aren't funny. Not only are they not funny, they're stupid. They're forced, because the writing is dreadful. The plot twists are cliched and previously used in the series. CGI is much, much worse than animatronic or models.

The actors are trying, but they just don't have anything to work with. You can tell they're almost embarrassed to be doing this. At the end of the mini-series,
you're relieved it's over. I actually had to go back and rewatch the entire 8 seasons afterwards to remind myself what a fantastic show ""Red Dwarf"" was. In fact, I had to make my wife watch them all too, to prove to her that the show was good. After watching only ""Back to Earth"", she thought I was insane for liking the show.

It's that bad.

So why 3 stars? Because I can't bear to give the crew of the Short Rouge One any less than that.

Any fan of the show should watch the mini-series. I just would really, really suggest you refrain for actually paying for it. And don't say you weren't warned.",1259712000,5,1693,4.574257425742574
3798756,4,B001UHO102,"I'll admit I didn't know what to expect from Red Dwarf Back To Earth after so many years of no new productions for this show. I was pleasantly surprised at how entertaining this new 77 minute show really is. It's not a return to earlier glory days when creators Grant Naylor wrote the show together and it is more of a ""dramedy"" as we've come to expect from Naylor writing alone, but it's solidly written with many great comedic as well as poignant moments. I'll stop there because there are many great little twists in the story and I don't want to put any spoilers here.

The commentary tracks and other extra features are terrific. The cast haven't lost a thing and provided terrific performances as they stepped back into character after so many years. As usual, The Cat (Danny John-Jules) turns every tiny line or moment he gets into comedy gold. Craig Charles turns in quite the good dramatic performance at certain moments of the film. Kryten (Robert Llewellyn) and Rimmer (Chris Barrie) are hilariously zany and eccentric as ever. I actually enjoyed this more than many of the season 8 episodes of the show.

3798758,5,B001UHO102,"Originally saw episodes of this series on a PBS station here in the U.S.; had to see more, was a little disappointed when I found out they were discontinuing Red Dwarf.
  Had my hopes up for quite some time for either a movie or U.S. version. After seeing some of the proposals from U.S. broadcasting, I'm glad they didn't go that route. Although, I feel with a little work it would still be feasible and widely accepted especially with the amount of following series like Stargate and other SyFy shows get.
  With all that aside, I had received the complete box set as a Christmas present a year ago; have even watched them with my eight year old son who has definitely enjoyed watching them so much so, that I sometimes find the the disks in his room. When I found that they were making a movie length edition in line with the TV episodes I was thrilled. After watching it a couple of times with my son have truly felt this is a great addition to the collection. The only draw back that I noticed is the gap from the TV episodes going through series eight then you jump to ""Back to Earth""; the movie is setup as taking place after series 10 and, with only a few references in the movie there is a bit left unexplained; at least for what was released here in the U.S.

  In all this is a must have for those who are fans; it's ""smeggin"" great. And, if you like sci-fi and comedy and have not seen Red Dwarf I'd highly recommend it but, you would need to see most of the original broadcasts to really understand the whole of it.",1258156800,3,1528,4.26643598615917

3798761,4,B001UHO102,"For Red Dwarf fans, like any other addict, any Dwarf is better than no Dwarf. So I was excited to get a copy of the newly released BACK TO EARTH Directors cut. The first thing I noticed was lack of a laugh track. It's a bit neanderthal of me I guess but I MISS the laugh track! Somehow it seems lonely and sad when no-one laughs at the jokes. Sort of like watching a stand-up comic bomb in a club. I bet others secretly feel the same but won't admit it for being thought crude and declasse.

Second it was somehow not as madcap and zany as the series. A polished Hi-Def Red Dwarf without cheesy plastic sets just doesn't seem right to me. I think they even had better teeth!

But all said it was truly great to see the lads together again. Like a Beatles reunion, how could it not be an epic and memorable event? The plot was twisty enough to rate multiple viewings so worth the purchase. I did watch all the extra features which I thought were worth as much as the film to a hard-core Dwarfer. Let's face it, if you've never heard of Red Dwarf I don't know what you'd think, but if you are a serious Dwarfite then you have to own it. Not optional.",1257724800,2,1148,4.143497757847534

There was just enough of the timing and character conflicts to remind you of how funny this group was.

3798765,5,B001UHO102,"The humour, heart, and spirit that made the show a cult classic return in full form in Red Dwarf Back to Earth.  The depths of metaphysical humour are mined yet again for another mind bending adventure with the boys from the dwarf.  A more sentimental and placid tone can be felt but the writing and performances feel a little more matured in a good way.  The FX sound and visual are terrific in the stellar HD transfer that creates a better illusion  between the CG and sets, (not to mention viewer and movie.)  This is not the place to start for those new to the show, but those invested with these characters will be rewarded, even if the story doesn't quite book(end)? as poetically as it may have.

In the middle, it seemed so.  I almost turned it off thinking this goes in the Good Will box and than it dawned on me, the last episode was a near perfect spoof of Blade Runner.  I saw it coming, but I didn't know that the homage would be done with humorous yet complete respect for the source material.  I was satisfied.  If this is the Red Dwarf's swan song.

3798768,2,B001UHO102,"I love Red Dwarf, and I think that it's one of the best comedy shows around.  I was so excited to see the release of this DVD.  Unfortunately, the show was just awful.  It could have and should have been so much funnier.  The writers did a huge disservice to the characters and to the show, and as a consequence, to the viewers.  I thought that Robert Llewellyn, Chris Barrie and Danny John-Jules were great in their respective roles, but Craig Charles' Lister of today just did not strike me as the Lister of yesterday.  He wasn't bad, he just wasn't Lister-y enough for me!  Maybe as Lister would be if too mellowed by age?

I thought the laughs were few and far between, and again, the story itself was just miserable.  The main good thing that came out of it is it got me to pull out season one again, and that reminded me why I love Red Dwarf.",1255564800,5,848,4.25
3798769,4,B001UHO102,"three just don't seem to be quite enough.
Honestly I, as it seems many people, felt a little let down by Back To Earth.  Not to say it's, bad, but it cerainly fell short of the high expectations I had for it.
It suffers from many problems.
First, It really just feels like one episode on steroids and never really developes over the course of what's really three.  Second, someone seems to have hit the reset button on the characters and they seem like one-dimensional versions of themselves-- Lister, the heart-sick slob, Rimmer, the up-tight dweeb, Cat, the fasion-conscious narcisist, and Kryten, the festidious android.  There seems to be little or no memory of the growth they've undergone over the last eight seasons.
Another problem is it doesn't actually do anything to resolve the cliffhanger at the end of season eight.  It just opens with a shot of Lister walking through the ship with the caption, ""9 years later.""  There's no Holly--either of them, and Chloe Anette only makes a brief appearance.
Finally, and the biggest problem is, if this is really ment to be the final chapter in the saga it only leaves you wanting more.
 Now given what I've just said it's a wonder I didn't slap it with one star and just type ""It Sucks!"", but it's still Red Dwarf and there's still a great deal of the old mojo left in the ship.
Along with the laughs that are found here, the plot gets downright philosophical with the crew members meeting some of the series' fans when they go in search of their maker.  The whole Bladerunner tribute that runs through out is fairly well done; I particularly like the guy who ""just does noses.""
And most importantly the cast is still the cast and they've got enough in the talent department to pull through even the weakest moments in this one.
Overall, Yes I was disappointed, but half a dwarf is still better then none.  I think this would have worked far better if it had been developed over the course of a full 6 or 8 episode series and had been brought to a proper, satisfying end, but maybe the back door was left open for a reason and there's still more to be heard from Smeghead, Listy and the crew--at least one can hope.",1255219200,2,2168,4.5268542199488495

There was great potential here and unfortunately the writers squandered it.  Do not let this DVD be your last memory of Red Dwarf.

Well, it WAS great to see everybody again (sans Holly).  But it was basically a recycled old plotline.  The meat of the plot was more like tofu...the dialogue seemed forced, as if the actors were leaving intentional pauses after their strained jokes in which viewers could laugh (but there was no reason to laugh as the jokes weren't funny).  And overall the story was a lot of bizarre effort for very little payoff.  There was clearly a point (after they leave the video store) where we were convinced it all had to be a dream of some sort.

The only thing that made me laugh was what Rimmer did immediately after the discussion about the morality of ""killing"" a hologram.
