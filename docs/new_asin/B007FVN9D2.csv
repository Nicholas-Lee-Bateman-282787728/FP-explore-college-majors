5083851,3,B007FVN9D2,This is very low impact and a bit boring after a week or so.,1409961600,,60,3.357142857142857
5083852,5,B007FVN9D2,"Perfect for those of us with an above average Klutz Factor!
Perfect for those ""Jeeze, I worked out way too hard yesterday, and I don't know if I can MOVE"" days.
Perfect for those ""Haven't been able to work out for weeks--gotta get back into the routine"" days.
Enough queuing to get you through the first run-through but not so much that it becomes annoying after several sessions.
Really refreshing not be treated to brain numbing references to cookie baking and picking up grandkids toys.
I had to work really hard to get my heart rate up, but again this isn't for those top of your form, bubbling with energy days unless you are truly a first time/never before exerciser.",1406505600,2,673,4.616666666666666

5083854,5,B007FVN9D2,"Low impact as I have 2 prolapsed discs and did not want to jeorpadise my back with further injuries,
Enjoy the music, easy to follow steps and very enjoyable.",1399680000,5,158,4.482758620689655
5083855,5,B007FVN9D2,"I think this is one of the best DVD's I've ever bought for home exercising in front of the TV; she takes you step by step with a nice warm-up and by the time you finish you feel alive and all your pains and aches are gone.

I recommend it for seniors like me.",1390953600,16,259,3.7962962962962963
5083856,5,B007FVN9D2,"At close to 8o and feeling very well and being very active-- I attribute much of this to this DVD.
  I have been doing this for three years three times a week and I love it. No condescension, lovely
  music. I swear I feel an inch taller after each workout. Never an injury.. It' s not for everyone but for sensible
  people who like to move and enjoy it, it is great.",1390262400,15,368,4.041666666666667
5083857,5,B007FVN9D2,"I love all of Mirabai's exercise videos, and this one has been a godsend for me. I was doing Mirabai's Level 2 Fabulous Forever Cardio Dance and loved it, but then I had some back trouble and switched to the Easy Cardio. It's much easier on my back and still gives me a healthy workout. By the way, I'm in my early 60s and in great shape, thanks to Mirabai.",1357603200,15,357,4.114285714285714
5083858,2,B007FVN9D2,"If you are in your fifties and are just starting to exercise, this would be a nice video to  start with, but if you exercise a moderate amount it is not challenging. I'm not one who likes to continue to add on to a routine, for instance adding a knee up after the arm swings, leg kicks,  etc, and that's what this video does. This would be good for individuals in their 60's or70's.",1347148800,11,382,4.148648648648648

8515949,5,B007FVN9D2,"I am a 60 year old woman who is out of shape and struggling with sciatica.  I have tried many ""low-impact"" videos.  This one is the BEST!  I love it.  It's truly low impact with easy moves yet still gives me a good workout.  If you aren't familiar with aerobics it might take you a bit to get the moves down, but they are relatively easy.  LOVE IT!  My back is already starting to strengthen. Thank you! :)",1512691200,,406,4.128205128205129
8515950,1,B007FVN9D2,"If all you're interested in is a smiling face & a mountain view, then this dvd is for you. If you're actually wanting to SEE the EXERCISE then buy a different dvd. The entire routine about how to move your feet, but they hardly ever show her feet!! Very frustrating to not know what your supposed to be doing. They need to hire a producer who is actually interested in the exercise.",1497312000,3,382,4.319444444444445
8515951,5,B007FVN9D2,I love this video!  I get a good cardio work out and it fits with my age (and weak foot tendons)!  I do it every day.  It has helped me feel healthier.,1485216000,2,151,3.65625
8515952,4,B007FVN9D2,"I purchased this video because I wanted to have another video with a little more cardio intensity than the Ease-In video, also by Mirabai Holland.  The routines are easy to follow.  If you have taken aerobics classes in the past you will recognize the moves. If not, the moves are pretty basic. I agree with another reviewer is that Mirabai doesn't do a very good job with telling you when to change moves, that's the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars. However, after a few times through you shouldn't have any trouble. Remember, you aren't auditioning for A Chorus Line you just want to get moving. The video also includes a little talk about what you should expect in a cardio workout.  You can fast forward through that after the first time. She also explains about target heart rate and explains how heart rate relates to your age. There is also a warm up and cool down with stretching.
One of the best parts is that the workout can be done in 30 minutes",1468800000,2,961,4.448863636363637
8515953,3,B007FVN9D2,"Loved the presenter & moves were easy to pick up & effective. However, video's overall fuzziness was too distracting...donated",1467849600,,126,5.684210526315789
8515954,5,B007FVN9D2,Great low impact DVD.,1462492800,,21,4.5
8515955,5,B007FVN9D2,A fun workout.  Great music and easy to follow.  Mirabai Holland is a wonderful instructor and this is definitely an enjoyable 30 minutes.  Probably best suited to those of us in the over 50 crowd (in my opinion).,1459209600,2,213,4.552631578947368
8515956,5,B007FVN9D2,Purchased these videos to get back in shape. I am so pleased with this one cause it is easy enough to keep up with but also I can feel my heart going... love the way Mirabai Holland keeps me going. She is very calming & encouraging & pleasant. She isn't yelling at me. It's like working out with a friend. I am so glad I found these videos cause I have gone through many that I just couldn't keep up with & they are sitting on my shelves. This one is one I actually look forward to & I feel great! thank you Mirabai.,1456704000,,516,3.9711538461538463
8515957,3,B007FVN9D2,"This is a short little workout that I bought because I am re-starting an exercise routine after being away from cardio for a while. It's more effective than I thought it would be at getting my heartrate up, so kudos for that. However, the cueing is pretty bad - she's not good at telling you what's coming up next and expects you to remmeber a routine with little repetition. And what is up with Mirabel's weird outfit with the droopy crotch and cut-out shoulders???",1451260800,,466,4.559523809523809
