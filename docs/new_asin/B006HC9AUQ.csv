First about the music.  I was very munch in a Handel Water Music mood, this being the 300th anniversary of the premiere on the Thames (on July 17, 1717).  So I had a great representation of the music done on original instruments with the English Concert, combined with a fantastic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/documentary/dp/B001MVYV0G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">documentary</a>&nbsp;on how the original party came to be.  Then I also listened to the entire three suites on a 'modern' chamber orchestra, done in a reserved style which would be considered 'period correct' in 1959.  That was by Thurston Dart and the Philomusica of London.

And for the modern version ... I had always shied away from Hamilton Harty's arrangement.  But now that I hear it done by the Boston Symphony in 1960, I do have to admit, I enjoy it very munch.  It is absolutely nothing like Handel/Beecham, or Bach/Respighi, or really any Romantic re-imaginings I have heard.  It is just shorn of a few trills in the brass, and with a little counterpoint inserted.  In fact, it is quite conservative, even more conservative than what Mozart did with Handel's Messiah.

I have to qualify that by saying the 'Water Music Suite' here presented was only 10 minutes long.  Considering the original 'Water Music' tallies up to about an hour ... that's pretty short.  Did Harty arrange more of it and Munch only used the good parts?  That I don't know.

So we have an hour DVD, with 10 minutes of Handel/Harty, and 50 minutes of Mozart.  That's OK, I also like Munch's full-throated, while still clean and elegantly executed Mozart.  In fact, I like just about everything Munch ever did.  I'm trying to think of anything of his that I don't like.  I can't think of anything.  He's one of my all-time favorite conductors.

Interestingly also, this is the first time I've seen him conduct where he gives a simple beat, tiny in fact, easy to follow.  He does get excited in Mozart, but nothing like his crazy carrying on in most other videos.

Now, about the lower rating.  The sound is off the video a little.  It doesn't bother me near as much as it does with singers, or keyboard players.  But just for total visual comfort, it does have to be adjusted and you will need a sound delay box which is not cheap, but essential.  For the Handel portion, I have it set to 40 milliseconds, and for Mozart, 65 milliseconds.  Otherwise you are watching a video where audio track PRECEDES slightly what appears on video, which is crazy man.

One more very small item:  Amazon's specs state that it is in color.  Of course, that is not correct, it is B&W.",1501113600,,2752,4.866379310344827
8498274,5,B006HC9AUQ,"There was a time not so long ago that the Harty arrangement of Handel's Water Music was the standard performing edition. It comes as no surprise that Munch drew upon this version for this 1960 BSO broadcast and before that for an RCA recording (1950). What may come as a revelation for the uninitiated is just how attractively it is rendered here. This is the BSO at the top of its game: vibrant colors, confident rhythms, rock solid ensemble.

Turning to the two Mozart symphonies, Munch was certainly no interpretive slouch. Since he never recorded any of this repertoire with the BSO commercially, these performances have a special significance. Munch was obviously not in the least concerned with stylistic ""authenticity"". What emerges in his hands is intuitive music making of a bygone aesthetic no less valid and communicative than performances governed by recent scholarship. The restored video is perfectly acceptable. The sonics range from good (Mozart) to excellent (Handel).",1345075200,2,985,5.19496855345912
