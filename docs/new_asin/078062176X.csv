31078,4,078062176X,"I am not quite sure that I have seen the contents of this particular tape, although a film on FLlW was telecast here in Australia a while ago. However what I have to say has to do with some of the above comments, rather than the video itself. First I'll deal with a sentence  found in the piece by ""parallax442"". It says that Wright DESIGNED Falligwater in just under 3 hours. Actually  what he means is : he DREW  the presentation sketches. Not  Michelangelo, not  Palladio,  not  Sir Christopher Wren,  Phillip Johnson, nor Mies van der Roe can or could DESIGN a house in that time. Not even a god can, I don't think. The fact is that Wright began creating his masterpiece on the very minute he began SPEAKING with the Kaufmanns. Vieweing the intended site of  the  new house  simply kicked his genius in full gear and the rest is (or should be) well known. At the time of the carefully documented phone call, announcing his client's visit, Frank Lloyd Wright  COPIED the stuff that was in his head. Is as simple as that  (if  anyone can call any such thing SIMPLE). Another thing to which I take exception, is  the word ""scandalous"" used elsewhere with regards to his personal life. The guy married young an even younger and very beautiful girl, full of life. Sowed his  oats (wild or domesticated,as the case may be) prior to that, during and after. He found a beautiful and spirited mistress etc. etc. etc. Knew joys, sorrow, pleasure and tragedy. Lived his life to the full as he knew how. Scandalous? Does anyone ever divorce or get a lover in America?",1038614400,7,1559,4.514285714285714
31079,5,078062176X,"The show did well in covering the life of FLW. I felt that a lot of detail was left out, including the demise of his family. Also, a large number of works, including the only skyscraper that FLW ever designed (Price Tower)  were left out, probably due to time restrictions. A great series to watch  if you are a fan of architecture or FLW.",915408000,4,339,4.28125
31080,5,078062176X,"Been waiting a long time to purchase this and it's worth the wait. While I wished it would've delved into Wright's philosophies of Architecture a little more than it does, it does a fine job of documenting the man he was in total. This does not contain a lot of his interiors either but it does give a good look at Taliesin in Wisconsin while telling the life story of Frank so if your even curios about who the person was instead of the myth, this film can't be recommended enough.",1459209600,2,482,4.3076923076923075
31081,5,078062176X,If you are a fan of architecture then you owe it to yourself to see this movie. Frank Wright was one of the most influential architects in history. This documentary doesn't just go through his career it also goes through his family life. I bought this movie for my architect aunt and we all sat down to watch it as a family. I ended up buying another copy for myself. Ken Burns does an amazing job as always and the quality you expect from PBS is there. You have seen the Guggenheim Art Museum in NYC or Falling Water now see the story behind these beautiful buildings.,1436400000,3,569,4.327102803738318

31085,3,078062176X,"Imagine, if you can, a memorial service for someone you really loved: a parent, a sibling, a spouse, or a teacher. Imagine that during the service a loud recording of vigorous, loud  piano music drowned out whatever was being said by the person speaking. The narration of the first of these two FLW documentariesas it is delivered by sensitive, knowledgeable speakers, including Wrights blood relativesis overwhelmed by vigorous, loud, highly rhythmic piano music. Burns and Novik obviously believed that straightforward narration was could not convey the emotions appropriate for such a documentary film, and that the sound track needed to be jazzed up. The result has all the charm of what were forced to hear through the loudspeakers in Wal-Mart or the local fitness gym. Music is shoveled into the program like crushed rock or manure, and its distracting as hell. Wrights unquestioned genius doesnt require this to be appreciated. And, in fact, it detracts from his genius. If subtitles had been provided, I could have happily turned off the sound tract and read the narration. But they are not.

This problem completely vanishes in the second of the two documentaries. And oh, what a glorious difference that makes! I have a sense that someone told the filmmakers to balance the music and the narration the second time around, and the filmmakers heeded the advice.",1430265600,,1369,5.08

31088,5,078062176X,"Ken Burns is the Steven Spielberg of the Documentary Genre.  His thoughtful treatment of the life and work of Frank Lloyd Wright set this biographical work as the benchmark by which all others must be measured. Covers every period from the early days after the Great Chicago Fire and his marriage and subsequent infidelity that ultimately forced his relocation and the building of the first Taliesen. His European sojourn, the long battle to get a divorce from his first wife and his subsequent remarriage following the murder of his mistress and her children at Taliesen and the burning of that home are all covered in adequate detail.  The Taliesen West period in Arizona and the creation of Fallingwater are also covered.  For those who are familiar with Wright and his life and work, or for the newcomer to this iconic figure in American architecture, it's a film worth watching and it's a film worth owning.",1426204800,3,912,4.870967741935484

31095,4,078062176X,"All in all, a very good movie and well worth watching.  I started watching it rather late in the afternoon and had planned to watch the 2nd half the next day, but was so captivated I watched the 2nd half the same night and ended up staying up super late to do so.  No regrets on that.  I guess my one complaint would be that the movie focused on the man more than his creations.  I don't know that I would change anything about this movie, but maybe would ask that Burns revisit FLW one more time and this time give us walkthroughs of his works and go into some depth as to how the furniture designs he did for many of his works were designed in terms of size and aspect ratio to fit into his creations.  For me, the most fascinating aspect of his works has always been the way he used the space with 'compress and release' and all that beautiful symmetry married with organic colors and shapes.  Anyway, if you're interested in the MAN and who he was, this movie is 100% spot-on brilliant.  I'm greedy... I want a movie more focused on how his creations grew from the early stages to the point where he was turning out the more daring masterpieces we've come to canonize him for.",1405900800,8,1180,4.26457399103139

31099,5,078062176X,Saw this on PBS and had to have the DVD for re-viewing.  Wright was a genius with a huge ego to go with it.  To be able to see masterpieces and have the experts point out an explain the innovative features is a real treat.  He had great tragedy in his life as well as major successes and the film goes into all of that.  It's truly an incredible story.,1391904000,2,352,3.9857142857142858

Shows his struggles in life and some of his important works. As some people noticed, indeed, it's a bit unbalanced, his works get some attention, but his life and tragedies get most of the time. Yet time is short and the moviemakers dicided that, nice to known about his personal life, but his work could be more spotlighted.",1361750400,2,448,4.6125
31106,5,078062176X,This purchase was actually to replace a previous copy of this DVD. I lent it to a student who left and never returned it. This is BY FAR the best documentary on FLW.

31109,3,078062176X,"This is an excellent documentary, as Ken Burns is a top class film maker, but it is let down by trying to squeeze the film onto one dvd disc.
The program is in two parts, each which goes for over an hour.
Each should be on its own disc which would have reduced the rate of compression and raised the picture quality.
This lack of picture quality affects the well photographed film of the justifiably famous Wright buildings and houses we are shown, and that is a pity.
Hopefully this documentary will be available on blu-ray at some time in the future and then we will be able to see these great buildings in a quality that they deserve.",1322438400,2,637,4.361344537815126

31112,5,078062176X,"This is a great documentary on one of the greatest of all architects of modern times. I did not know a lot about Frank Lloyd Wright until I saw this show. I was indeed curious about the man and the Ken Burns expose of him is a delight to watch and become absorbed into as part of the process. Mixed with this Ken Burns approach to the subject matter is the wonderful inclusion of the music of Ludwig van Beethoven. The second movement of the fifth piano concerto adds a special poignancy plus the spacious interpretation adds to the spacious designs of Mr Wright, this is followed by the thunderous finale of the piece as we learn to appreciate all of the designs and what each heralded. The closing moments and credits bring Wright in all his glory coupled with the finale to the Beethoven Ninth Symphony, a marraige of music for humanity and architecture for humanity. This would be great for any young person studying architecture and any person who apprciates quality work for the sake of quality. Five Stars to Ken Burns and Lynn Kovick on this fine all warts and everything about Frank Lloyd Wright.",1306022400,3,1105,4.585858585858586

31114,5,078062176X,"I've seen this video about two times.  Burns does another outstanding job of bringing Wright's life unto a great story.

Drama seems to follow Wright throughout his life but never diminishes his passion for designing.  Personally for me there were three moving scenes.  First was when Wright left his family to be with his mistress, and later lost her and her children along with the home by a killer.  Next The story of his second rise to fame with the Johnson Family building, and third the story of Falling Water and how Wright completed the drawings just hours before the client came.....from scratch.

I think this is one of the best biographies on Wright ever.",1290211200,2,666,4.747826086956522

It would have been helpful if the synopsis in Amazon included that information. I was expecting the film to cover Wright's entire life. I didn't agree with one critic's comment that it detracted from the film to include scathing remarks by Wright's contemporaries/rivals. That only enhanced the viewer's appreciation of his work by emphasizing how much envy he aroused.",1210809600,3,501,5.048192771084337

31126,5,078062176X,"This is an excellent documetary.  I highly recommend it for anyone interested in learning more about architecture generally and Frank Lloyd Wright specifically.

The material covered is a well done overview of the architecture of the 20th century, as seen through the lens of FLW's life.  I found it an amazing tale.  There is much to learn about architecture here - the history and scenes are fantastic.  From the early days of the skyscraper, to his domestic work (Pairie Houses), to Falling Water (the transformative piece of domestic architecture), the ultimate masterpiece of the Guggenheim - it's all here and well told, and shown.  The commentary by Philip Johnson - a longtime FLW antagonist, but ultimately an admirer, is powerful and poignant.

On a personal note, I found the life of FLW inspiring - not in the details or setbacks, but taken for the whole.  How many individuals can say their most productive period was after their 70's?

Bravo to Burns - this is one of his finest works; on one of the best of subjects.

I hope others enjoy this DVD as much as I did.",1191283200,57,1079,4.721925133689839

I would recommend this film to anyone.  It is a sensitive and brilliantly made documentary, laced with beethoven's music throughout, and impeccably built together, frame by frame on film, as Mr. Wright's buildings were.
As the documentary progressed, ultimately  building to a tender yet impactful crescendo, this man's life's story brought tears to my eyes when it was over.  Mr. Wright was an incredible human being....despite devastating loses he had to endure,he had the courage and fearlessness to tread a path no one ever dreamed possible, yet he did.... and during at ime where it was almost impossible to be 'free.'
