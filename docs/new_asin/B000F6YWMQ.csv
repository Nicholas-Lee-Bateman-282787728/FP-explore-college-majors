8118029,5,B000F6YWMQ,"Definitely an asset to any DVD library.  The performances by both the male choir and the Sangerknaben are flawless and refreshing to watch and listen.  In addition, the biography of Mozart is interesting and to witness his musical talent is really a blessing. Sad that he died as a young man.
