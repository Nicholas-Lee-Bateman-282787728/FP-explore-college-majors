6283553,5,B00IO8PU3C,"A Gibson and other Libations come to mind.
Released in 1959, NORTH BY NORTHWEST is and remains a brilliant piece of filmmaking from Alfred Hitchcock. Bernard Herrmann's magnificent groundbreaking score truly stands out in this film and has become legendary in many ways as so many of the images are in the film. To watch it again and enjoy like never before is to realize just how entertaining this film is and how it has stood the test of time. They really do not make them like this anymore. Cary Grant inimitably is Roger Thornhill. I like his personal book of cigarette matches monogrammed with R.O.T. The O stands for nothing so he tells Eva Marie Saint on the dinning car of the 20th Century Limited. You know, I have been drinking Gibsons ever since Cary Grant ordered one in that scene. Just one of the libations you pick up watching this endearing film.
STRANGERS ON A TRAIN is yet another disturbing study in murder where a flamboyantly mentally imbalanced man, Bruno Antony played flawlessly and with much gusto by Robert Walker, suggests switching murders with a tennis pro, Guy Haines played by Farley Granger in one of his best roles, that he accidentally bumps into on a train. Honestly, I think this film may be the most shockingly bizarre of all Hitchcock's films and it is definitely one of his best and perhaps most underrated. The suspense in this film is unnerving. It is interesting how Hitchcock manipulates your loyalties between the two men. Robert Walker's performance is very unsettling, yet the viewer can almost sympathize with him at certain moments. Dimitri Tiomkin's score is haunting yet full of energy as good must outwit evil in the end and it is a constant reminder of how we often can become confused when emotions often take over reason.",1398211200,8,1775,4.766233766233766

6283579,5,B00IO8PU3C,"Great idea to sell these two movies together.  Having two Hitchcock films together, watching them at or very close to the same time, gives you an idea of how much of a creative film-maker the man was and how often his ground-breaking ideas have been used in so many films through the years, exhaustive camera angles, the tweak of details from the original story to make it more interesting/accessible to a wider and present day audience and how important his audience was to him - very revealing / very refreshing.",1455667200,6,514,4.711111111111111
