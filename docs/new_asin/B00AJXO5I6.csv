5444569,3,B00AJXO5I6,"Frankenstein Theory is a found footage/POV movie that follows a professor as he seeks to prove that the book Frankenstein was based on a real experiment conducted by his ancestor.

FT is pretty typical of found footage movies, as we are faced with a long build-up and about 20 minutes of action. The characters are not as stupid or annoying as in some found footage movies, and there are no glaringly obvious stupid decisions except the decision to journey beyond the Arctic Circle in the first place.

FT is tense and engaging, but I can't think of one legitimate scare. The creature is a snarling beast and displays very little of the intelligence the mad professor goes on and on about. The movie does not besmirch the great Victorian era work or delve too deep into the themes of the novel, so unclench. It is a well made and fairly engaging take on the idea of Frankenstein as opposed to the novel. Horror fans may find something to like even if literary snobs do not.",1362268800,6,973,4.554285714285714
5444570,5,B00AJXO5I6,"I highly recommend this movie!

I saw a rough cut awhile back and was so impressed by how deeply the filmmaker investigated the era and the book itself. In fact, there's much debate within the film about whether or not the creature is a ""monster"" at all.  The movie maintains the book's themes, questioning the ""monsters"" we ourselves create and set loose in the world.

The Frankenstein Theory doesn't pretend to be a retelling, but more like a modern day sequel.  It's funny, smart, beautiful looking, engaging, tense and scary.

I loved it.  It's not your average horror movie.  It really has it's own quirky personality.  And it's 100% worth seeing!",1360627200,4,653,4.81981981981982
5444571,1,B00AJXO5I6,"I'm sort of glad they remember the creature was off in the arctic but they clearly didn't read the novel.  The creature had long black hair, tightly drawn skin (Look up Luke Goss from the 2004 Frankenstein mini-series) and he could speak three languages fluently by the end of the novel.  Also he regretted killing.  He was not some mindless bigfoot type.

This is NOT what Mary Shelley intended and the creators of this film should be ashamed of themselves.

If you want to watch a Frankenstein film that actually follows Mary Shelley's story and it's purpose than I highly recommend the Frankenstein mini-series released through Hallmark in 2004 starring Luke Goss as the creature.

In all honesty I'm getting kind of kind of intelligent, Gothic Horror creatures being presented like mindless serial killers for Generation Xers.  Stop treating us like we're stupid and stop dumbing down the classics.  I'm also talking to you, Last Voyage of the Demeter.",1359763200,7,956,4.968553459119497

5444588,5,B00AJXO5I6,"Pretty enjoyable!  The snowy, desolate landscape they travel to while hunting the Frankenstein creature is very creepy.  You don't see a lot of the creature, but this is one of those movies that does a good job unsettling you with sounds, visual evidence, etc. as the characters begin to realize they are being stalked.

5444590,4,B00AJXO5I6,"While this does use a fairly original premise, all in all, this ends up being another of those ""Documentaries"" in which the movie itself is the ""found footage,"" although no disclaimer is made to that fact. It's at least filmed better than most with a steady hand at the cam and no rapid, eye-blurring pans to give the viewer vertigo. Most of it is shot in daylight with very little ""night-vision"" effects.  There are very few non-relevant scene, with the shooting sticking to simply the expedition and that's all.

Remarkably there's no violence shown onstage, so to speak, one hears the sound of mayhem but except for a few blood sprinkles and a body, nothing is shown. In fact most of the action consists of the film crew slogging through knee-deep snow looking for missing comrades.

In spite of all this, it's a fairly interesting and compelling story and in my opinion, the only thing ruining it is the inevitable and expected ending. Just once, how about a ""documentary"" that ends successfully and non-lethally? That's my excuse for the 4-stars. I saw this end coming before it happened.

It's well-acted within the limitations of the script. Beautiful scenery, the credits say this was filmed in Alaska, the dialogue identifies it as White Horse, Canada. Either way, it's beautiful, cold, and deadly. The snow gives the film a bright, crisp, isolated feel, the perfect setting.

Enjoy it but don't expected anything new.

5444592,2,B00AJXO5I6,"The Frankenstein Theory is a classic case of a great idea but with lousy execution.  The films premise is that Mary Shelleys Frankenstein was a fictionalized account of real events.  Professor Jonathan Venkenheim believes that the story was true and was based upon the accomplishments of his ancestor, Johann.  His theory got him suspended from his university and now, to prove his theory and to clear his family name, he goes on a quest to get evidence of the Frankenstein Monsters existence.

He heads to the northern most part of Canada with a documentary film crew in tow, recording every moment and giving the film a quasi-found footage quality.  They first meet a man who claims to have had an encounter with the creature.  They hire a guide named karl who leads them to an old, abandoned Yurt (think cabin) where at night they hear strange baying and growls outside.  Jonathan attributes it to the monster although the rest of the crew is skepticaldespite the fact that they seem to freak out over the slightest noise.

When one of their snowmobiles is vandalized overnight, Karl leaves to track down whoever did it which continues the horror genres long tradition of stupidity by supporting characters.  Raise your hand if you think we ever see Karl alive again.  The film continues in this tiresome fashion with the crew being freaked out and Jonathan insisting that the creature is feeling threatened by their presence so naturally he wants to pursue the creature.

The Frankenstein Theory reminds me of one of those old 1970s docudramas where they search for Big Foot but the only thing the audience searches for is the exits.  Theres no payoff, we never get to see the monster except for some vague, fleeting glimpses.  I mean come on, even a low-budget film can produce decent makeup effects if you try hard enough.  What we get is a big guy wrapped up in animal skins.  Oohhscary!  The Frankenstein Theory is painfully slow and boring.  The only character we care aboutthe monsteris one we never get to see.",1438387200,,2021,4.794797687861272

The acting was far better than your standard b-movie, especially the lead actor, who is exceptionally talented, as any review of his prior work will demonstrate.

5444596,4,B00AJXO5I6,"I recently watched The Frankenstein Theory on Netflix, and I was remarkably impressed. I would personally rank it amongst my top five found-footage films, alongside The Blair Witch Project, V/H/S, Grave Encounters, and Devil's Pass. I particularly loved the random interjection of quirky humor and personality flaws -- something which seems to be a rarity in this genre nowadays. It boosted the suspension of disbelief and the gave the movie some added smarts. I genuinely felt as if I was following ordinary people on an impromptu expedition rather than underpaid actors reading from a B-movie script. I also think the unusual choice of location was sufficiently compelling given the story's mythological basis (a la Devil's Pass and The Blair Witch Project). Although, the movie didn't pick up pace until the end, I enjoyed the character development. It added to the documentary's credibility and curiosity, rather than the typical detachment that I often experience with these types of films. My only disappointment was the final scene. It was almost too predictable. Maybe the director ran out of ideas? Still, that's a minor criticism given the overall production value. Highly recommended for anybody that is looking for a suspenseful late night sci-fi flick and is willing to tread off the beaten path of Paranormal Activity lookalikes.",1420675200,,1343,5.280373831775701

It fails as a found footage film, it fails as a mockumentary, it fails as a horror film, and it fails as a film with anything at all to do with Frankenstein. It contains an hour and fifteen minutes in which no progress is made  no character development, no sightings of the supposed creature, etc.  and ends with ten minutes in which people are killed, always off screen, and a camera is left blankly shooting out a door into the wilderness. Its not funny, its not engaging, it contains no good shots, music, dialogue or scares. A miserable attempt at making a movie. Also, if you're buying that from the creators of The Last Exorcism"" line on the poster  you shouldn't be. Its untrue.

5444601,4,B00AJXO5I6,"Okay, you either like the ""found footage"" genre or you don't. If you don't simply skip this movie and don't waste everyone else's time complaining about how you don't like FF movies. If you do, however, you might find this one somewhat enjoyable. Like many of these types of films, the movie hinges on the actors being about to tell the story through their dialogue and the writer having a good story to present in the first place. The ""theory"" here is sound enough for a good film, it is the acting that is really not quite up to par. Now, the lead actors were not bad, but the supporting cast were nothing more than cannon fodder from the get go.  they were only there because, well, you can't have a FF film without a camera guy and a sound guy and an ""extra"" camera guy to get those long shots of all the actors together. Okay, enough bagging on those minor details. the movie is actually pretty good if you are just willing to go along for the ride and follow what is actually a pretty interesting theory. This is a new and original take on the Frankenstein's monster mythos and I think it pays off well at the end. Folks need to keep in mind that this is not an action movie or a true ""horror"" film, it is a dramatic STORY set within the horror genre. Don't expect blood, guts, and effects, because they are not here. Rather the filmmakers expect you to use your mind and think things through. If you follow what the movie is presenting, you may find it an interesting ride. It is not fast paced, but at 90 minutes, does it really need to be? Overall, better than your average found footage film. I'd put it in the ballpark of The Bigfoot Tapes, which was surprisingly good as well. Now that one was a movie with a VERY unique twist at the end. This one is straight forward, start to finish.",1393632000,2,1797,4.300884955752212
5444612,1,B00AJXO5I6,"I'm writing this review to save as many people as I can from wasting their time or money on it. I have only just recently read Mary Shelley's  ""Frankenstein or The Modern Prometheus"". So, from that standpoint I had hoped for a lot out of this film. The writer evidently did actually read the novel and wasn't referring to the cinematic versions of Frankenstein. This is what compelled me to stick with it. I'm sorry I did. Although you feel as if you are going to get a great pay off in the end. Meet ""the creature"", the tormented soul from the novel that declares war on humanity for shunning him (spoiler alert) you don't. You get your hopes up, as the principle character continues to insist that the creature isn't a mindless animal, but a reasonable intelligent and sensitive being that is only misunderstood. And if you have read the book, you know this is true enough. However, the ending proves that he was wrong, the ""monster"" is nothing more than a savage, inarticulate beast that simply kills because it knows nothing better.

The combination of the score and the cinematography are wonderful.  This is certainly not a paint-by-numbers movie; the premise is pretty far-fetched and the approach is unique.

The Frankenstein Theory quenched my thirst in all 3 categories. As other reviewers have already said,a film crew goes on a search for Frankensteins monster at the Artic Rim,interviewing people who said they have seen the monster along the way. What they find doesn't let you down! Its not a cheesy found footage horror movie,its well done. You could do much,much worse at the video store trying to pick a horror movie.

5444616,4,B00AJXO5I6,"The Frankenstein Theory takes a very unique and original look at the Mary Shelley story of Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus under the pretext that a heir to the ""Frankenstein"" family has found notes and family memorabilia to suggest that the creature is indeed still alive in the Arctic north.
The film is shot from a documentary perspective as it follows a group of five film makers and Jonathan Venkenhein, the great, great, grandson of Johan Venkenhein which was the actual creator of the Frankenstein creature on their journey to discover the truth.
Timothy V Murphy (""The Lone Ranger"", ""Appaloosa"") gives a perfect performance as the guide Karl, as he tries to distill in the crew the dangers of heading out across the Arctic with nothing but snowmobiles and a childlike misunderstanding of what exactly they are getting themselves into.
Kris Lemche nails the furiously curious role of Jonathan Venkenhein, who is a young professor who has been so consumed by his families history and the possibilities, that he has been suspended from the University in which he teaches.
Directed by Andrew Weiner who co-wrote the story with Vlady Pildysh, the film is able to overcome the documentary tiredness that some films fall into and stand alone with good acting and great cinematic shots.
The creature, who is played by a very well seen but unknown actor and stunt man named Roger W. Morrisey (""The Lords of Salem"". ""Hellborn"") is perfectly placed and never over used. This is more of an imaginatively tense and scary fall through an unlit cave than it is a spotlight heavy horror movie where the creature is highlighted in detail and posed for each high definition shot.
Come take a look at the Adam of Venkenhein's labors, and see for yourself, just how wretched are the ways of men, both past, and present...",1379980800,3,1816,4.89935064935065

I admired the film's premise about the Mary Shelly story actually being a record of true events. It was pleasant, for once, not to be banged over the head with the silly ""gore club"".....which does not necessarily  equate fear and suspense on it's own sanguinary  merit! Loved that we only saw hints at the monsters appearance and heard it's voice. This allowed the mind's eye to custom fill-in the blanks.

He claims his great grandfathers great grandfather was part of a group of genius' in Europe in the 1800's who had something to do with Dr Frankinstein and he believes the monster is still alive and roaming around southern Canada. He takes a group of documentary film makers with him up into the southern wilderness of Canada in search of Bigfoot, I mean, Frankenstein, only to find him. Don't consider that a spoiler, the front cover of the video shows him... however, you never see a shot like that. Instead the movie mostly depends on noises and growls in the dark with a bunch of off screen kills. So will they, or at least someone from the group survive when the hunters become the hunted? Believe me, if you couldn't care less already, don't start now. You will never kick yourself for skipping this budgeted film passing itself off as a pretty low budget movie with no memorable scenes what-so-ever.

The first half of the movie is just a snore fest, the middle gets a bit more interesting, and then you get a Blair Witch Project ending where you sit there and think, ""That's it? It's finished?""

So I read other reviews both pro and con and decided, ""What the hell, it's only 4 bucks to watch it streaming,"" so I rented it. As it turns out, this is a scary ""found footage"" flick. I watched it with headphones on and got the full aural effect of desolation and wilderness that sets the mood in a film with hardly any background music. At times it felt like an episode of ""Finding Bigfoot"" with the way the Monster behaves, growling in the night, hitting trees with rocks and trudging through the snow in the distance, but it was done to great effect. There's a homage to ""Jaws"" as the guide of this expedition describes in detail what happened to his friend during a polar bear attack. For many people, they seem to be complaining that the Monster's reveal is too brief to really see anything, to which I say, just look at the DVD cover. That's it. This isn't Mary Shelley's chatty Monster and it isn't Boris Karloff's pitiful and sympathetic Monster, it's a pissed off Monster that eats caribou and snaps people's necks if they try to run away. He's been on his own for over 200 years and he doesn't like your company. I recommend this movie for all you ""found footage"" freaks who like their monsters treated realistically.

5444624,3,B00AJXO5I6,"I watched this film last night, and found it riveting.  Out of curiosity, this morning I scoured the Internet to get a sense of the general reaction to the film.  Most striking to me is the absence of discussion about the ending.  It is clearly not out of a concern for ""spoiler alerts,"" because many of the posts offer a plot synopsis.  Even Wikipedia offers a scene-by-scene summary, and then misreads the ending by stating that the monster carries off the woman's body.  This would imply a cadaver, yet another in a series of similar fates.  However, that is not how I understand the end of this film at all.  Throughout the movie, the academic hot on the monster's trail insists that it is a rational creature with whom one can converse, and that Frankenstein is looking for companionship.  Said academic meets his demise, indicating that conversation is not on the monster's agenda.  Then, as the only remaining crewmember cowers in the yurt -- and she is female, please note -- the monster barges in and knocks her unconscious.  While this occurs off camera, the sounds are not congruent with previous carnage.  Rather, the viewer hears two quick blows.  We then see Frankenstein throw her over his shoulder, grab the ratty doll that someone previously gathered up from the floor of the yurt, and walks off into the wilderness.  Frankenstein has found the ""companionship"" he desired, and the ending is far more disturbing as a result.",1369008000,2,1440,4.804878048780488
5444625,5,B00AJXO5I6,"I have to say that I loved this movie.  I am a bit of a FRANKENSTEIN conisseur (I think I spelled that wrong) since I teach Mary Shelley's work to my high school students, so I seek out FRANKENSTEIN stuff (I have a t-shirt bearing the slogan I LOVE VICTOR FRANKENSTEIN). So I am a bit of a junky about the monster.
I loved this movie because my students wanted a sequel to the terrific book; they loved the book, and this movie is just that... it's a sequel of sorts.  Since the monster doesn't really die in the book, and much is left to our imaginations per Mary Shelley, it does leave one wondering.  This movie operates from the premise of ""What if the monster didn't really die?""
Indeed... what if he did not?  What if he found a way to exist (Victor did cross so many lines in his search for the elixir of life from alchemy; what if he made the monster somehow immortal? What if he was alive 200 years later?) in such a way that he adapted to life in the Arctic (where he was last seen by Robert Walton and crew in the book)?  He'd be starved for human contact (and would become like an animal due to lack of socialization) and would be continuing to kill since he is alone (he agreed not to kill if Victor made him a woman monster, but Victor did not give the monster a mate in the book).  The movie is textual in that way!
The movie is a contemporary take on a sequel, and I loved it! I can't recommend it to my (or your) students since it is LOADED with f-bombs and other assorted vulgar language issues, but I thought it was sooooo interesting.
True, some parts of the movie aren't too textual.  The monster is all dressed in furs--- or else is it that he is just hairy? Hard to tell. That isn't textual to Mary Shelley's work.  Also, the actors primitively and erroneously call the monster *Frankenstein* several times, and this is amateurish. But those (and the F-bombs) were my only beefs with this movie.
I loved how the premise is that Shelley's book was actually non-fiction fictionalized.  Genius!
If you love FRANKENSTEIN, like really love it as I do, you'll be intrigued by this movie. I almost didn't buy it because of all the customers here's negative reviews, but I am so glad I did buy it!
Lastly, if you have seen the Hallmark Family Films version of FRANKENSTEIN (the one I show in class b/c it's like the only FRANKENSTEIN movie you could legitimize enough to show to students!)(and it's really awesome), THE FRANKENSTEIN THEORY movie ends JUST like the Hallmark Family Films movie entitled FRANKENSTEIN ends.  Holy cow!  So cool.
Thanks for reading. Enjoy the movie!

This is the premise of THE FRANKENSTEIN THEORT.  Despite the potentially intriguing premise, the film just falls flat on its face.
The biggest drawback is the Blair Witch Curse----the movie is another video account, complete with nausea-inducing shaky camera shots.  Another disappointment is we never see the ""monster"" except for a fuzzy quick glance at the end.

5444628,3,B00AJXO5I6,"The Frankenstein Theory follows John Venkenheim who leads a documentary team into the Arctic Circle to save his academic reputation; you see, John obsessively believes the ""Frankenstein"" novel is a work of nonfiction disguised as fantasy, and he's out to find proof. The Frankenstein Theory is an interesting film with an interesting concept, but fails to deliver the scares.

I liked the story in this film. It's a rare found-footage film that doesn't revolve around the supernatural, and I appreciate this. It uses its first hour, or so, to introduce the characters, explain the theory, show the evidence and their lengthy trip. There are a few creepy scenes, like Frankenstein watching/running from afar, strange noises outside of tents/cabins and... not much else, really. The film picks up the pace at the last 20 minutes, but still fails to deliver the frights and jolts; those looking forward to seeing the titular character from the DVD cover will likely be disappointed as he appears in full form for less than 15 seconds throughout the entire film. The acting was good - not spectacular, but not terrible, either. The music was also good, but I found it odd since it is a found-footage film, right? So, it shouldn't have music because it would affect its ""authenticity""? (it might be considered a faux-documentary, but it's debatable, I suppose.)

Overall, The Frankenstein Theory has a genuinely interesting concept, but it really shouldn't be considered a horror film as it lacks most horror elements; and, it's really hard to consider it anything else since it is never fully developed. As of 4/25/13, this film is available on Netflix Streaming, a rental is recommended.

5444642,2,B00AJXO5I6,"One day the found footage films may run their course. Let's hope that day is sooner rather than later. While it makes for an easy way for a film to be made for less money, it becomes rather annoying after a while. That being said some of these films still work, but not always.

THE FRANKENSTEIN THEORY is one that does work but perhaps not for everyone. This is a movie with a slow build to a crescendo that is short, sweet and to the point. Some will feel ripped off by that, others will enjoy the film for what it is.

Professor John Venkenheim has degrees in history and English language. While this may seem an odd coupling he explains it to a young female documentary maker he has hired named Vicky to film his latest excursion. Displaying some well preserved hand written pages, he tells her that the basis and opening of the story of Mary Shelly's FRANKENSTEIN was a series of letters sent to a woman whose brother was the captain of the ship Dr. Frankenstein took to the frozen north. Venkenheim claims that these are those letters and that they are real and not fiction.

Following news stories and information he has gathered, Venkenheim has hired a guide and intends to track down the creature from the story that he claims is still alive and roaming the vast North Country. While he seriously believes what he is about to do Vicky's crew is less than receptive to his ideas and ridicules him behind his back each chance they get. But they are being paid so off they go.

The film deals mostly with the journey that this group takes than with the actual creature. Their guide is a roughneck with plenty of character to go round. This is someone not to mess with or be taken lightly. When the group's snowmobiles are damaged in the night, it's this man who takes a rifle and sets out to find whoever is responsible. Is it the creature or someone else? The panic and fear in the group plays out well onscreen.

Don't let the cover of the DVD help you decide whether to watch or not. Don't expect a movie filled with the creature roaming the countryside with villagers in hot pursuit, torches raised. He actually has very little screen time. But the movie does offer some slow burn tension. If you like movies that are a little more in your face then skip this one. As for found footage films, this one isn't too bad.",1365897600,,2326,4.425233644859813
5444643,5,B00AJXO5I6,"This film is part of the resurgence of Found Footage films. So in short if you do not like found footage films pass it up. However, if you do give it a shot or, if you are interested in the story of The Frankenstein monster this goes into area no film or book has gone before. I won't go into the details of the film but I must give the concept. Basically, this film proposes the question what if Mary Shelly's Frankenstein was actually a true story and not just another piece of early horror fiction? What if the creation by Victor Frankenstein is not only real but is still alive roaming the earth after all these years? What would he be like? Would he be a gentle Giant unaware of his power or would he be like a monster the people have made him up to be? If found what would it do to the world of science? What kind of discoveries will they find? It is the creators answers to these questions that make this film very interesting and definitely worth 5 stars.

However, if viewed on par with other found footage films there are better ones out there like Grave Encounters 1 & 2, the blair witch project, paranormal entity 4 (100 ghost street:the return of Richard Speck)and I'm sure more. It would be ignorant to call this the best and it would be just as bad to call it the worst. All in all it will not be a waste of time and maybe it will get people to read the original story or even watch the amazing universal adaption of the novel. Did you read that? It might inspire people to read something other than texts or what their friends are doing on a social network!?!",1365552000,3,1575,4.232558139534884
5444644,2,B00AJXO5I6,"It is never a good thing when the cover art of a DVD - or any product for that matter - is way better than  the product itself.  As is the case - and ""case"" - here.  Spoiler Alerts:  On the cover of the DVD we have a graphic of the Monster wherein he looks truly gigantic (give the angle of the image) and wherein one clearly sees a stitched-on leg and the Creature is wearing some impressive duds.  Anyway, the guy in the graphic is not seen in the actual movie at all - and now I know why the DVD cover is, indeed, a graphic and not a screen-shot.

THE FRANKENSTEIN THEORY had the germ of a marvelous idea - but the movie remains a germ.  Nothing vis-a-vis Mary Shelley's masterpiece is really explored in this ultimately tiresome ""found footage"" flick.  We never learn how it is Mary Shelley got involved in turning a ""true"" story into her immortal novel. Back-story to Professor Venkenheim (who is to be the descendant of the actual maker of the Monster) is scarce. The preparations for the documentarians' actual expedition are also lacking in their believability. (They learn how to handle a snowmobile on site? Really?) There is, in short, no convincing build-up to the premise of the plot.  What there is in this minimal approach indirectly reveals that the makers of this movie didn't seem to really have the courage of their convictions.  And while the ""found footage"" approach can be justified in that the original novel is patched together (as was the Creature) from several ""authentic"" sources, the ""found footage"" approach as witnessed in all too many contemporary horror films has by now grown terribly tedious and trite.  It is also an easy way for today's filmmakers to promise much and show little. With such an approach it is also all too easy to make enormous profits with little outlay. I paid close to thirty bucks for this film because the cover was evocative, the premise sounded sound and I love all things Frankenstein.  But the payoff wasn't there for such an over-priced product.

And so many lost opportunities!  Apart from fleshing out the back-story, what about addressing the immense intelligence of the Creature as he is shown to have in the novel?  How great it would have been to show him as did Shelley - and in the film's climactic scene, wherein the Professor tries to talk to the Creature, how truly pulse-pounding it would have been to hear the Monster articulate!  Even if off-camera!  Instead the Professor is naught but Professor Carrington from THE THING FROM ANOTHER WORLD, attempting to communicate with that film's title character only to get savaged.  The Creature, in this movie, could have and should have been made sadly sublime and truly tragic.  Instead, the not-much-bigger-than-the-average-football player is nothing more than a big bad bear or a badass Bigfoot.

In short, a great idea that leads nowhere.",1365552000,2,2861,4.764705882352941
5444645,3,B00AJXO5I6,"When I saw the promotional material for ""The Frankenstein Theory,"" I admit rolling my eyes and thinking the movie sounded ridiculous. I couldn't help but have low expectations going into it with cover art exclaiming, ""From the creators of 'The Last Exorcism.'"" Whenever a movie carries a bi-line like that to promote it, you can bet it's going to be a disappointment. This indie found ""footage"" film is the perfect example of a concept that shouldn't work but did.

Desperately driven to prove himself to the world, Professor John Venkenheim leads a documentary film crew to the edge of the Arctic Circle. He intends to expose to the world his inconceivable theory. He believes that Mary Shelley's ""Frankenstein"" is a work of non-fiction disguised as fantasy and that the creature is alive and well. As they travel deeper into the desolate snow-covered plains, strange events and happenings unfold around them. Is someone or something stalking them? If so, is it human or is it the unnatural creature Venkenheim is searching for?

Writers Andrew Weiner and Vlady Pildysh found a compelling way to take some of the original ideas from Mary Shelley's ""Frankenstein"" novel and incorporate them into a modern day suspense thriller. It's a well-paced movie that gives viewers several opportunities to jump out of their seats and flinch at every loud sound they hear.

There is a humorous yet respectable nod to ""Jaws"" in ""The Frankenstein Theory."" The guide for their trip out into the wilds of the Arctic Circle is obviously fashioned after Quint in Steven Spielberg's hit film. His characteristics and the way he tells a story completely reminded me of when Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss, and Robert Shaw are sitting around drinking and telling stories on the boat. I couldn't help but smile every time he showed up on screen.

It's brilliant how elements of Shelley's classic novel are used in ""The Frankenstein Theory."" Writers Weiner and Pildysh tie them into the film in such a way that something many might consider hokey doesn't come off that way here.

I detest most ""found footage"" movies for two reasons. First, they make me sick with all their shaky camera work and bouncing around. Secondly, there's too many of the films being made and they're a lazy way for producers to push product out and make a quick buck. This being said, ""The Frankenstein Theory"" took the method and successfully ran with it. The cameraman is portrayed as ""professional"" and most of the footage is steadier than usual for these movies.

There are no special features included for the release of ""The Frankenstein Theory."" I was disappointed that we didn't get a ""Making of"" featurette which showed where they filmed the movie. It would've been nice to see what the monster really looked like up close as well.

""The Frankenstein Theory"" doesn't come to the ""found footage"" table with any new tricks up its sleeves. However, it does take all the good aspects of the filming style and fashion something fun, startling, and exciting. The atmosphere and setting of the movie gives viewers a sense of dread and isolation that, mixed with a ""less-is-more"" visual approach, delivers true scares.",1365465600,11,3173,4.96421845574388
5444646,3,B00AJXO5I6,"John Venkenheim (Kris Lemche) believes Frankenstein is alive and well and living in the Arctic. He hires a seasoned film crew who are skilled in the art of ""Wet Willies"" but know nothing about camping or Arctic survival. On the way up to the site, they stop to interview a paranoid meth head who claims to have seen the monster. For me this was the highlight of the film. They hire a guide (Timothy V. Murphy) and go off into the wilderness. If you want to see the monster feel free to fast forward until there is about 8 minutes left in the movie.

I loved the idea, but the found footage execution was a disaster. Kris Lemche was either wrong for the part or is role was poorly written. The rift with the wife? What was that about? There is an excessive amount of F-bombs in the film used as a substitute for decent dialogue. I think when the guide said, ""I ain't no actor or nothing"" he hit the nail on the head for this film. Not the worse found footage film out there. Nothing more than a cheap rental at best.

Alot of the movie is predicatable and maybe a scare here and there but thats just from the growling in the darkness effect.

5444649,4,B00AJXO5I6,"When I heard the premise for the film, I knew I had to see it.  Although I have never sat down and read the original ""Frankenstein"" by Mary Shelly, the concept behind it has enthralled me ever since I was a kid.  Something about a mad scientist and his quest to actually create life really reaches out to me.  In THE FRANKENSTEIN THEORY, director Andrew Weiner gives a new and unique twist to the story, and the result is a fun and chilling film.

From some of the other reviews I've seen around the Internet, it appears that this is one of those films that you either love or hate.  For me, I loved it.  It's not perfect, but very few films are.  And there's plenty about this one to enjoy it.

I think the originality behind THE FRANKENSTEIN THEORY is what entices me the most.  It's intelligent and unique, attributes that seem to be hard to find in the found-footage sub-genre of horror.

THE FRANKENSTEIN THEORY is shot well, especially when you consider it's `found-footage', which tends to be shaky and grainy.  The documentary crew used HD cameras and stabilizers for the most part, which makes for a much more enjoyable movie experience.  Add to this the stunning Alaskan scenery (the film was shot in Alaska for the most part), and you've got one vivid film.

The acting is not bad, although I doubt it will win any awards.  I enjoy seeing Kris Lemche on-screen and Timothy V. Murphy does an outstanding job as the guide.  But unfortunately, the rest of the cast isn't really that noteworthy.

Still, THE FRANKENSTEIN THEORY is an absolute blast for me and I recommend checking it out.  Whether you like it or hate it, chances are the last few scenes in the film might just haunt you for a bit after the credits roll.  And be sure to watch in surround-sound; the noises and ambient sounds are extremely powerful if you can do so.  Give this a look and let us know what you think.",1364774400,4,1889,4.470760233918129
5444650,4,B00AJXO5I6,"""The Frankenstein Theory"" harks back to Mary Shelley's 1818 novel, ""Frankenstein,"" by posing the question, ""What if the story of a man who dared to steal the secret of creation were true?""

When he is suspended from his university position for outlandish ideas, Prof. John Venkenheim (Kris Lemche) leads a documentary film crew to the rim of the Arctic Circle in a desperate effort to vindicate his theory that Shelley's literary classic is, in fact, a work of non-fiction disguised as fantasy and restore his academic reputation.  In the vast, frozen wilderness, Venkenheim and his team search for the legendary monster, a creature nearly three centuries old and still shrouded in mystery.

""The Frankenstein Theory"" makes a far-fetched idea palatable by establishing that Venkenheim's team are skeptical of his obsessive mission.  They wink, roll their eyes, smirk.  We pretty much feel the same way, yet we're drawn in by these doubters.  Director Andrew Weiner taps iconic source material, and his central character --- a variation in subtler form of the mad doctor -- is an appropriate ingredient in this unrated DVD release.

The movie is, at least, in the spirit of the book, which is more than you can say for other movies ""inspired"" by the story. The movie follows the same idea, the feeling of dread, the icy tundra and the guide that is hired tells an effectively creepy story to boot. I was really impressed. I was really hoping it would not be some lame-butt ending and I was not disappointed in the least.
Great for the surround sound. Like the aforementioned movies, the surround sound really comes into play. BEWARE! The filmmakers actually depend on the viewer to use a little imagination about what is out there in the dark. Like the wolves in ""The Grey"" and the children just on the other side of the tent material in ""Blair Witch"", just hearing them go around the room in the dark is unsettling. TURN IT UP!!!

And for good measure we have a little Trollhunter thrown in. So that's one, two, three concepts these fools cribbed from. Original? Not so much.

Jonathan Venkenheim, tired of being ridiculed, hires a documentary film crew (More originality!) to follow him to the wilds of Canada to look for Bigfoot, uh I mean Frankenstein. Along the way they stop to interview a witness who has actually seen the Frankenstein Monster! Alas, he's a meth head with an itchy trigger finger. After narrowly escaping that situation, the crew heads on to meet a wilderness guide that looks suspiciously similar to the guy from Trollhunter. They travel by snowmobile to a yurt in the middle of nowhere to look for the monster. Naturally, things go horribly wrong.

The film looks cheap especially considering the whole hand held camera/documentary thing. The actors are all pretty s*** except for Heather Stephens and Timothy Murphy, they do pretty well with what they have. The rest act like they are on The Office. There is tons of night vision nonsense and mugging for the camera. Basically every clich that is wrong with these kinds of films is trotted out here. But that's not to say that there are not some bright spots. The film picks up somewhat once we pick up the guide and there are actually a couple of pretty tense and effective moments. Unfortunately there is a lot of boring s*** to wade through to get to them. Everything, and I mean EVERYTHING, happens off screen. We do hear a lot of growling however. Yeah.

Plain and simple, this movie is easily forgotten.

Now, don't take that the wrong way.  I have seen many horror films in my day and FT is not the worst in the bunch, far from it.  It is a fairly decent way to spend an afternoon.  But, there is nothing memorable about it.  Heck, even after watching it... I couldn't think of a single ""scare"" moment worth mentioning in a review.  It is simply a click and forget film.

Amazon's rundown is basically all you need to know:  A professor, looking to redeem himself, takes a few young folks interested in filming, out to Alaska to investigate the theory that Frankenstein was a factual event.  Now, depending on how you want to look at the majority of the film, it is either ""slow and drawn out"" or ""suspenseful and engaging"".  Either way, the film eventually finds its way to the last 20 odd minutes, in which off-scene kills and sound effects happen.  If you have watched many ""found footage"" films, you have 3 guesses to figure out how the film ends.

Was it a great film?  No.
Do I regret watching it?  Also, no.
Does the cool DvD cover art appear anywhere in the film or does the star of the show even get some solid screen time?  Nope, not a chance buddy.

8552832,4,B00AJXO5I6,"I am a suckered for for found footage movies, and this one does not dissappoint. While it does have many of the standard tropes for this kind of film it stand up well. The acting is reasonably solid, and the location helps create a sense of isolation as well as a building tension as the situation becomes increasingly untenable. Give this one a shot especially on a cold winters night.",1499299200,,386,4.5285714285714285

With the budget they had to work with, they used every penny on all the right things. It's very professionally filmed, good sound, decent acting, and an original idea for the genre. It's not up there with the best nor is it at the bottom. I don't regret the rental.",1496880000,,415,4.32051282051282
