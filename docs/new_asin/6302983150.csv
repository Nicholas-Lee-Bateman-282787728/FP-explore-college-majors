7832804,5,6302983150,The Loretta Young Show Vol 3 is a fine tape. Loretta's show is a great anthology. In this tape the episodes are about a Japanese couple finding a pearl. The second episode is one about a woman being driven ionsane so her inlaws can snatch her money. Fans of Loretta Young will like this the most.,1464998400,,296,4.303571428571429

Episode 5-""Man's Crisis of Identity In The Latter Half of the Twentieth Century""
The opening Confuse-A-Cat sketch, where a squad of cat confusers, likened to a British army squad led by a general, put on a weird, illogical, loopy performance on stage, is a great start, helping out a cat undergoing ""suburban fin-de-siecle ennui, angst, welschmertz..."" or in a word, ""moping.""  Ditto for the customs sketch, of the nervous watch smuggler (Michael Palin) and the impassive customs officer who merely takes it in stride on as the smuggler (John Cleese) makes lie after lie.
One sketch in particular got scissored and unfortunately isn't restored here.  A police constable (Chapman) tries to frame a famous actor by throwing down a paper bag on the floor, implying it has illegal substances in it.  The actor looks inside and sees sandwiches.  The constable says, ""Blimey!  Whatever did I give the wife?""  The edited part had the wife, clearly high, saying, ""I dunno, but it sure wasn't sandwiches!""  Urgh!
The steamiest sketch are the two couple (Terry Jones, Carol Cleveland) making out, followed by a montage of suggestive films, only to discover that the guy's been showing the girls films all night instead of you-know-what.
The job interviewer (Cleese) who humiliates people, in this case totally upsetting Graham Chapman, ticking notes on a notepad and making disapproving noises and comments, may have been fun for some, but it demonstrates the power interviewers have over interviewees, plus how nerve-wracking job interviews can be.
Episode 6
The forgotten German composer with the longest name is priceless, as it takes a full minute to say it.  And there's some funny irreverence when the interviewer (Cleese) sent to his only surviving relative (Terry Jones), sends that aged man to a fatal heart attack upon repeating that name a few times.  He then throws down his microphone and takes a shovel.
The Whizzo Chocolates sketch is a classic, consisting of that all-time classic confectionary, crunchy frog, ""dew picked and flown from Iraq, cleansed in finest quality spring water, lightly killed, and then sealed in succulent Swiss quintuple smooth treble cream milk chocolate envelope and lovingly frosted with glucose.""  Which results in Superintendent Parrot (Chapman) making multiple trips to the bathroom praying to the porcelain god.
The Dull Life of a City Stockbroker (Palin) is simply amazing--a guy whose preoccupation with his job leaves him out-of-touch with everything, including an army shootout on a bus, colleagues who have been murdered.  Me, I would've leapt across the counter and done the horizontal twist with the topless newstand girl portrayed here, a pretty creature he's totally oblivious to.

Episode Five is one of the best episodes ever. The highlights of Episode Six include The Dull Life Of A City Stockbroker.
