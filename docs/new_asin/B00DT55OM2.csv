8597453,5,B00DT55OM2,"This collection of stories was such a great addition to my first grade classroom library. We used it after having Rob Scotton as an author of the month, and the owl story goes perfectly with my classroom theme. Snowflake Bentley was a brilliant non-fiction addition to the rest of the fiction stories.",1388448000,,301,4.8076923076923075
8597454,5,B00DT55OM2,"There's a good mix of stories in this collection. Some stories are full of such whimsy others a little more serious but quite enjoyable. The narration of those such as Sean Astin and even an author of one of the stories is a real treat!  The narrators aren't dull in the least and really keeps the viewers drawn into the story. The visuals are equally as good and I really liked how in the story Snowflake Bentley they go from storybook to real life visuals. It makes quite an impact on the viewer!

Children and adults alike can learn about the christmas holiday, winter Season, family, determination, and honor. I'll have to say the story Snowflake Bentley is my favorite and truly makes you look a little closer at world. All the stories support early reading skills with the read along feature.  Also the bonus  behind-the-Scenes look at Creating the Animation for Fletcher and the Snowflake Christmas I found fun and engaging!

I highly recommend checking out Merry Christmas Splat and more winter stories whether it be to enjoy at home with your children or in a classroom setting. There is much to be enjoyed and learned from the stories included. I know we'll be watching it again and looking for books by the authors stories included next time we are at the library!",1386028800,,1275,4.674107142857143
