8212806,5,B000IAZOHG,"This the latest in a series of rare and intimate videos showing the masks of this African community. It puts you up front and personal with the meaning, materials and performance of this body of masks that we generally know as static art objects. This is filmed with  honesty that is not present when tribal dances of this type are done as part of a tourist venue. Seen with sound, movement and at times humor this DVD adds depth to our knowledge of art of the masks of this family. I had my college library buy it for our collection and I show it every year in class.",1436832000,,568,4.2592592592592595
8212807,5,B000IAZOHG,"Dr. Christopher Roy's African Art as Theater: The Bwa Masks of the Gnoumou Family of the Village of Boni, filmed in 2006, provides amazingly current footage of mask performances of the Bwa people in Burkina Faso.  The first two and half minutes introduces geographic, cultural, and religious contextual information for the mask performances. The footage of the masks includes traditional Bwa plank masks, as well as masks of monkeys, a bush pig, a serpent, a chameleon, and a crazy man.  Roy, who has done extensive research of Bwa art, provides interesting cultural and anecdotal information making the film both educational and entertaining. The running time of just under thirty minutes makes it ideal for a classroom setting.",1213920000,4,729,5.222222222222222
