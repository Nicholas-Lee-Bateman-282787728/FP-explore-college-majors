7893143,2,6305701369,"This is neither the best version of the Mu Lan story nor the worst, nor is it the train wreck of _The Secret of Mulan_, but after a promising opening start of General Hua saiyng that horses are not stupid enough to start wars that we are barraged with dialogue that is constructed almost entirely from cliches.  If it relates to gender issues and is suitable for children, it's intere, probably five or six times.  The film manages some tug-at-the heartstrings moments all right, but the subhuman look of the enemy soldiers also knocks it down and seems to fly in the face of its points.  Physiognomy is common in animation, but in this film it is really overdone and inappropriate to the tone and themes of the film.  I give it two stars.  It's probably a decent enough film for children, but as animated version of Mulan go, the Disney version is the best one.  The best overall is Lady General Hua Mu Lan, but it is avaialble only in Region 3.

If you want to see one that is so-bad-it's good, check out _The Secret of Mulan_.  The reason it's a train wreck is because it tried to combine Disney's two big hits of 1998, _Mulan_ and _A Bug's Life_.  While that could be excellent material if you're Andy Warhol, it is as crass;y moneygrubbing as can be in the execution.

Aside from the diversion about _The Secret of Mulan_, this is a review of the Mu Lan (1998), directed by Susan and Geoff Beak form a script by Leonard Lee.  Originally issued by Madacy Entertainment and reissued by Timeless Entertainment.  The animation is by Burbank Studios of Australia.",1220659200,,1563,4.523131672597865
