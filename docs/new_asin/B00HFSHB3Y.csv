6161720,5,B00HFSHB3Y,"With 18 episodes of a great show for (currently) $17, the value/cost ratio of this disc set is already pretty huge, and the solid extras put it over the top. Season one has four commentaries, some small featurettes and a decent collection of outtakes. The second season unfortunately dropped the commentaries, but they replaced them with the Vandaveon & Mike webisodes, which are 3-minute sketches where two idiots (played by K&P) offer constructive criticism of the show.

As for the show itself, it's great -- best sketch comedy show currently running, if you ask me. The first season was solid and had a lot of good stuff in it, but the second was where the show really came into its own. Something Key and Peele really excel at is the short sketch. Whereas a lot of sketch comedy winds up running premises into the ground and stretching everything out to be four or five minutes long, a lot of Key and Peele's best scenes last two minutes or less, and very rarely does a sketch feel like it goes on too long. Their sketches are not only hilarious and clever, but also well-produced. The show's aesthetics are like none I've seen in any other sketch show, thanks to the masterful direction of Peter Atencio. Whether it's a Power Rangers spoof, an unearthed home video of a young Barack Obama, an even older video of a man at a civil rights rally trying to speak after Dr. King, a scene where an aging Rambo-type considers returning to active duty, or the famous ""football player names"" sketch; pretty much everything looks just like it should. But most importantly, it's just a really, really funny show.",1402531200,13,1607,4.678445229681979
6161721,5,B00HFSHB3Y,These dvd's are the FUNNIEST!!!!!!!! I love these guys!!!!! Thanks for making the dvd's everyone in my family laughed until they almost peed their pant,1402012800,2,151,5.08
6161722,4,B00HFSHB3Y,"i loved watching this show on tv and wanted the combo since i saw it on shelves at a wal-mart. love it so far!

one thing to note for all future buyers(it is already mentioned in the discussion below) but the set has is labeled as 4 discs, which is false it only comes with 2(1 per season). it is a little off putting because when you look at the season 2 disc it says ""season 2 disc 1"". it seems everything thing is there the only thing i am confused about on season 2 are some of the episodes don't seem to be the same on IMDB/wiki. for example it says season 2 episode 3 on the disc is ""country music"" but on wiki and imdb it says its ""Puppy Dog Ice-T"". maybe i am missing something but otherwise great set!",1401235200,9,710,4.0

6161725,4,B00HFSHB3Y,"Why is there not a season 2 separate from this? I already bought season 1 back when it came out and now what seems like ages later they put it out but WITH season 1? I don't need season 1 so am I suppose to buy this and basically admit I waste money when I bought season 1? All in all this is a rant but I love the show. I'd just prefer a separate season release. If anyone has heard of it or knows more, let me know.",1400803200,6,417,3.696629213483146
6161726,5,B00HFSHB3Y,"Hilarious and very clever. every sketch is funny and its fun to see these guys poke fun at current events, history, and pop culture. I hope they release season 3&4",1399075200,2,163,4.466666666666667
6161727,5,B00HFSHB3Y,"It's a little funny how some people are still offended by certain things. I think Key and Peele have taken satire to a new level, literally. Sure, we've had a lot of issues as a human race and the history is horrible, but if we cannot move on and see the light there's no point in daily life. I realize that not everyone thinks this show is funny, however, it sure can spark a laugh for myself at times! I think more less Key and Peele are taking these things and showing how absurd people still are even today. So, if you're offended and think they are mocking these issues, I think you may be missing the point. What they've done is essentially point out the racial and gender-based stereotypes and put them into a comedy skit for people to laugh about them and finally realize how low-level it is to still be stuck on these things. If you get offended easily or perhaps take certain things the wrong way then don't watch these shows. However, if you think you're beyond without question any racial or gender issues, then you'll probably think it's funny and laugh along with the rest of people and on into a better world.",1398729600,3,1124,4.408653846153846
6161728,1,B00HFSHB3Y,"If you like MAD TV, Family Guy, Kat Williams or Jeff Dunham you'll love these guys.

I on the other hand do not. Every sketch that they do, at some point, has to do with race for some reason. It is really annoying, at least when Chappelle did a sketch based on race (the blind KKK member who was black) it had a message behind it. They also do a lot of repetitive comedy, saying the same word over and over until it is 'funny', ala Family Guy. And they over act, as in nine off the sketches seem like a real situation with real people. Their improvisation skills lack a creative breadth of knowledge and timing. (See episode 177 of Comedy Bang Bang for example)",1397260800,3,661,4.246031746031746
6161729,5,B00HFSHB3Y,"If you do not watch Key and Peele then something is seriously wrong with you. I can say that this is a must see show. I wait all year just to see this show. This show is one of the best shows on comedy central. I laugh at every sketch that they do. Every sketch that they do has some relevance to the real world that makes us laugh. Keegan Micheal-Key and Jordan Peele are really great comedic actors. I started watching them when they both were on Madtv. They were the best even then One of the two best sketches that they have in my opinion are the Substitute Teacher and the President and his translator.

Buy This and Get ready to die of laughter.",1397088000,9,651,4.166666666666667
6161730,5,B00HFSHB3Y,"Key and Peele have created a show that is quite funny, with production values that are amazing for a sketch comedy show. Most of the sketches are downright hilarious, with only a few falling flat. I recommend this to anyone who was a fan of Chappelle's Show back in the day. It's a good time!",1470614400,,292,4.327272727272727

I got 2 discs... One disc for each season

Season 2's disc has ""Disc 1"" printed on it, to which I can only surmise that there WAS a disc 2 for season 2, but it has not been included in the case for some reason.

I feel like I was given one half of what I paid for. HOWEVER.

For each respective season, the apparent ""disc 2"" is included in disc 1 (bonus features).

So it's just the seller's inability to count that ruined my purchasing experience.",1456444800,4,499,4.26595744680851

6161767,5,B00HFSHB3Y,"Right here i am.writing a review for the second(2nd) season. I already reviewed the first and third season. This is a review for the second season. I got em all 1 season at a time,but all 3 seasons. I love the skits,highlights include the Prisone skit with the guy taking the wrap for a crime & he has to take out 7 inch. The skit with the mattress of solitude,their infamous President & Luther skits. The cop who is a magician. The crazy landlord,the Power Falcons,the skit with the father who won't accept his son til' he hears he has a tv show. Plus all there stand up skits to the crowd are hilarious. The Halloween episodes are the best to me. Carvel the whimpering gang leader,i think they call him Carvel because he is as soft as an ice cream cake.haha. This show will have you,like me dying laughing. I think the show is excellent every skit is even better cuz rhey are all uncensored. The Darius Rucker/Hootie& the Blowfish is hilarious wow man that has my cracking up every time. I'm a musician and let me tell you i'd be pissed in that situation would piss me off,we'd just cut em off and kick in. Bit the skits are great,the substitute teacher from the city mispronouncing things. The thing with the Underground Railroad with Jordan playing Harriet Tubman. The skit with.them.counting money after a drug deal and they get shorted them a 20$ that is ridiculous,but if you look at the guy with the moustache is the DEA agent from Breaking Bad(and 6kilos of H for 100grand is a steal,the dude should have collapsed from the pile full of ""pure""H) The skit is so stupid it is hilarious,the skit i didn't much like was the Miami Vice expmosions skit(tame for them) the guy in the park with the babies. The holiday song about not leaving is funny. The foreign guys standing around harassing and touching each other. You can't go wrong with this collection,if you do not already have the first season then pick up the double pack. Both seasons are hilarious. I suggest getting the 3rd season also that seems to be the best every skit is a 10 but there all good.",1421971200,,2065,4.49468085106383
