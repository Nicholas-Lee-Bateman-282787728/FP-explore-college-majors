8328916,2,B001O2SH8U,"This four-DVD set includes DVD-R copies of ""The Strange Love of Martha Ivers"" (1946), ""My Dear Secretary"" (1948), ""The Big Trees"" (1952) and ""Master Touch"" (1972, also known as ""A Man to Respect"" and ""Hearts and Minds"").  It is important to note that DVD-R videos are produced inexpensively by being burned on demand, rather than pressed like major studio releases available in retail stores. At any rate, the copyrights on each of these films expired long ago, allowing anyone - and everyone! - to issue them on home video. Over the years, as copies of copies of copies have been used as source prints, the audio and video quality of these films have diminished significantly, to the point that some companies' releases are virtually unwatchable.

In the case of the Douglas selections offered here, ""The Strange Love of Martha Ivers"", a gritty film noir in which Douglas made his feature film debut opposite Barbara Stanwyck and Van Heflin, was given a separate DVD release a few years ago by Paramount, the company who owns the original rights to the film. That DVD was remastered from elements in their vaults, and was the highest quality edition of the film we're ever likely to be offered. I strongly recommend you seek out a copy of that particular release if you wish to add this highly regarded film to your library.

The three remaining features are in this collection are not among Douglas' best efforts.  ""My Dear Secretary"" is an inconsequential romantic comedy co-starring Laraine Day and Keenan Wynn, and featuring Rudy Vallee and Irene Ryan.  ""The Big Trees"" (not to be confused with a better but similarly titled 1952 Kirk Douglas film, ""The Big Sky"") is a tepid drama about the preservation of giant sequoias most notable for its color photography.  And, finally, ""Master Touch"" is an Italian - West German coproduction from the mid-1970's that has been exhibited under several names and with running times varying from 95 to 112 minutes.

My recommendation is to seek out the Paramount Home Video release of ""The Strange Love of Martha Ivers"", and avoid this collection.  You'll be getting a higher quality print of the best film in the collection, and probably saving some money, too!",1255996800,6,2204,4.905913978494624
