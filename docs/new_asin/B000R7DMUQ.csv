8579244,5,B000R7DMUQ,"The Bravo family series of beginning ASL is a great way to learn from native signers and from signers who are hearing and/or hard of hearing.  The tapes are very entertaining and the skits take place in real-world settings. Cultural and grammatical notes by the ""host"" signer add to the value of these tapes. Vocabulary, sentences, stories and skits are used to instruct and reinforce signed concepts. The best thing about these tapes is that they can be stopped and rewound if something is missed during the first viewing. Or, the second; or, the third. I'm sure you get the point (smile);afterall, ASL is truly a foreign language to most hearing people.",1257897600,,655,4.848214285714286
