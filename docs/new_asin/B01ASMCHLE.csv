7607950,5,B01ASMCHLE,"The second disc is all filler episodes about the separation saga for all the Strawhat crewmates, but the first disc is AMAZING, the action scenes are blended so well with multiple prominent characters giving you a true sense of suspense and/or anticipation even when you already know the outcome.  Even the scenes without action are pure entertainment gold as they build on the characters to tremendous degrees.  I thoroughly enjoyed this segment (as with all of Season 7) and can't wait for the next season to start.",1462924800,,517,4.931034482758621

8748195,4,B01ASMCHLE,"This entire package was a great way to show how much Luffy has grown both as a character and ""force of nature"" in the World of One Piece""! Luffy definitely has his work cut out for him attempting to save his brother, Ace from being executed while at the same time trying not to end up ""six feet under"" himself! I recommend this collection to any One Piece fans or anyone in need of an ""anime action fix""!!",1468368000,,405,4.205128205128205
