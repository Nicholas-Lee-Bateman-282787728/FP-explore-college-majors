8423103,4,B004CJB09U,"This is a great DVD set because it contains my son's three favorite characters - Bob the Builder, Fireman Sam, and Thomas & Friends!  The set is all about non-stop action and includes some great episodes.  There are two Thomas & Friends episodes, one Bob the Builder and one Fireman Sam episode.  Now these are not new episodes but rather a collection of the characters action packed episodes.  So if you are buying this set, I would make sure you or the child you are buying it for doesn't already own the DVDs, we only had one of the episodes so the other three were great for us!  The set is great though overall because on Amazon it comes out to be only $4 a DVD, and at least for us I don't mind having a duplicate of DVDs my sons love because I can keep one in the car and one inside.  My sons love all four episodes and I find them wanting to watch each one equally.  The Thomas & Friends Track Stars is neat because it contains most of their favorite trains.",1296432000,,966,4.1891891891891895
