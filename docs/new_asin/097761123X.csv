7794825,5,097761123X,"Though still in its infancy as a social science, socionomics already has proven its worth by demonstrating that human social behavior is probabilisticly predictable.  This DVD brings together the key concepts in an entertaining, intellectually accessible format.

The totally uninitiated might find this lecture/slideshow a bit on the dry side, and long-time Elliott devotees might not find a lot of new material here.  However, for anyone just getting interested in socionomics, this is an outstanding addition to the available materials.  I hope and expect that as more colleges begin teaching socionomics courses, this video will be an integral part of the curriculum.",1278460800,2,671,5.549019607843137
