7972540,5,B00006RCL0,It was a really intense pyschological thriller. I loved  the movie when I first viewed it years ago. My viewpiont has not changed. I love the movie,1359936000,,147,4.444444444444445
7972541,5,B00006RCL0,Incredible movie. Tom Sizemore should have received an Oscar for his performance. The complete cast was great. Too bad they didn't collaborate on another film.,1346112000,,159,5.4
7972542,1,B00006RCL0,"Another movie i recently saw for the first time and let me just say IT SUCKS! was a total waste of time and lame, but i'm going to be honest here, i only saw it because of senor mcdermott and i'll also admit that i almost lost it when i saw the scene of him wet and fresh out of the shower and wearing nothing but a towel wrapped around his waist,(that scene was hot). ladies, if you want to see this flick, see it if you want to look at and drool over senor mcdermott. other than that, don't bother and waste your time with this unmenagated crap.",1345766400,,547,4.027522935779817
7972543,3,B00006RCL0,"I think Tom Sizemore holds the pinnacle of this flick.  I have seen him in other films, but he is my new favourite actor because of his performance in this movie.  He embodies this man Eddie.  I've seen better from Dylan McDermott, and I probably shouldn't even comment on Sharon Stone's 'acting' (you know, that character she does for e  v e r y - s i n g l e - o n e of her roles . . . herself, yawn).  Anyway, I was very drawn into the movie to watch more of Sizemore's acting.",1134432000,,480,3.9072164948453607
7972544,4,B00006RCL0,"Filled with suspense, this movie kept me entertained until the very end. Great story, not for those who want romance or car chases.",1105056000,4,131,4.739130434782608
7972545,2,B00006RCL0,"What a shame to have two excellent performances wasted on a script that doesn't go anywhere.  Dylan McDermott gives an excellent performance as a writer who isn't going anywhere.  Fate decrees he's to ""live"" in a house he's supposed to be selling, a house which was the scene of a brutal mass murder.  Enter Tom Sizemore, equally impressive, as a strange, neurotic young man who claims to be the manager of a local grocery store.  McDermott and Sizemore strike up a tenuous relationship, and as the movie unfolds, we're expecting some startling revelations...which never come to fruition.  Is Sizemore the killer?  Or is he just a lonely man looking for companionship?  Add an icily cold performance by a young Sharon Stone as McDermott's bitchy editor and you have the ingredients for a tidy little thriller.  But no souffle here folks. All the ingredients don't come together and you're left wondering just what you've spent 90 minutes with.
Recommended only for the two male performances.",1088208000,,991,5.0
