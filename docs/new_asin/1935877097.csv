7801985,5,1935877097,"Our family thoroughly enjoyed this DVD.  The young men did an outstanding job researching, recording, editing, and publishing this DVD.  They were able to teach us in a very interesting and witty way and had us laughing at times.  The careful observer will note a few surprises throughout.  We liked watching it as a family since one or the other of us would pick up on something that another one perhaps did not right away.  Very enjoyable and worth the purchase.",1344211200,6,464,4.679012345679013
