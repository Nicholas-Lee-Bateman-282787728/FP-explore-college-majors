I bet Victor would have really enjoyed living during this time. Back then it could have been unheard of to do most of the marketing, promotions, etc yourself. People always felt they needed other corporations. However, now we are in a society that got sick of being told no or you cannot because we want to use someone we feel is better than you. People got sick of hearing that. A lot of the outgoing ones have created their own images and pushed themselves, by going directly to the consumers.  Which seems like what the producer, Joel has done.  Interesting story. Nice item.",1202342400,,730,4.515151515151516
8158716,2,B000KQGNVY,"The CD is quite acceptable up to track 13. The man obviously had a very pleasant voice but just happened to be in the right place at the wrong time. The tracks on the CD after track 13 are very average and maybe Mr Marchese should have retired a lot earlier than he did.

As far as the DVD goes i have only played part of it and if the rest is as bad as what I played it is not worth the money.",1181174400,,394,3.6904761904761907
