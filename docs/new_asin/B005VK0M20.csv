8487503,5,B005VK0M20,"If you want to buy this ONLY buy the YA Entertainment DVD box set, even if you have to pay more. It's ALWAYS worth it to get the YA Entertainment box sets instead of questionable, most likely bootleg versions of Korean dramas. As for this drama, I have watched 80 K-dramas by now and Spring Waltz remains firmly in its number 3 position on my list, after I'm Sorry, I Love You and 49 Days. Don't cheat yourself with bad versions, only get the best. These shows deserve it and you deserve it.",1401148800,4,491,4.290322580645161
