However, the description was vague and I lost my gamble!  My husband has not even watched it and it was Christmas gift Dec 07.",1222128000,,262,4.117647058823529
8365068,4,B000TJ6OXY,I was surprised at the quality of the video footage on this DVD of live performances at the SXSW in 2007. IT's the highest video quality I've seen on a concert footage. The editing was done well also. Nothing more irratating than to have the guitarist break in to a lead and the camera still on the singer.  The interviews could have been better but my interest was on the live performance of the bands. The DVD is worth the money.,1189209600,,431,4.320987654320987
