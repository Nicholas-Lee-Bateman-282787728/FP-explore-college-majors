7892081,5,6305621780,"I'm a huge collector of anime. Tenchi in Tokyo was a collection that I started in the early 2000s, but I couldn't find many of the discs once they started doing box sets. Finally came on here and was able to find them used, at a relatively cheap price--probably paid less for these discs than if I had gone out to buy a new disc or box set of it (starting at $29.99/disc, probably closer to a little over $100 for the boxset...). Very pleased with it since it runs like a charm and isn't too beaten up (doesn't skip, unlike some other discs I've gotten from sellers).",1361318400,,567,4.2592592592592595
7892082,4,6305621780,"This isn't my favorite Tenchi series, but it's still pretty good. This show starts out with the girls already living at the Masaki home. Tenchi has decided to go to Tokyo to study under a priest and continue high school. The girls are not happy about this obviously. Washu invents a tunnel that can transport them back and forth from the house to Tenchi's apartment. When he arrive in Tokyo he meets a cute girl named Sakuya. She seems normal, and that's a nice change for Tenchi. After they spend more time together things get kind of ugly with the others.

In this DVD Mihoshi and Kiyone pursue Ryoko to arrest her. It's clear that their friendship is wavering. Back home Sasami learns that her friend Yugi is actually the evil force that is causing the rift between everyone. Tenchi also discovers some scary things about Sakuya's past. This is another dark chapter in a seemingly more depressing Tenchi series than we are all used to. It's still good though.

This is a different look at a very familiar series. The animation is different, and I like the new character, but overall it falls short of the original series, and Tenchi Universe.",1353024000,,1145,4.663366336633663
7892083,4,6305621780,"Yugi's plan is going perfectly.  Mihoshi and Kiyone have gone undercover to arrest Ryoko, everybody thinks Ayeka has gone nuts, Washu is nowhere to be found and Tenchi is too busy with his new love life to care.
But cracks are showing in Yugi's perfect little world.  Mihoshi and Kiyone seem to have doubts and may wish to reform Ryoko.  Ayeka seems to be exploring the old tomb found earlier, trying to find clues to what Yugi IS and even Washu's research seems to be focused on Yugi. It seems Washu is making progress, linking the Yugi Sasami knows as a friend and the Yugi that attacked the household.  Even Sakuya seems to be losing control over Tenchi and her own memories.  The problem being, of course, is that she HAS no memories.
Is it too late?  Will Yugi win even while the truth becomes known?  And which side does Sakuya TRULY belong on?",1087603200,,850,4.48051948051948
7892084,4,6305621780,"Of the different continuities in the Tenchi Muyo Anime this is the one I liked the least. Actually, I take that back; ""Pretty Sammy"" is the worst. I thought I should get the stuff I don't like out of the way. In ""Tenchi in Tokyo"" the animation is ghetto, and the subject matter seems less mature than the ""Tenchi Muyo"" and ""Tenchi Universe"" continuities but there is some stuff here that Toonami, in their cowardice of mature themes, cut from the OAV which you now get to see. Yeah, yeah the art isn't that great; this doesn't make it a bad seires to add to your collection however. In fact, in spite of the drawbacks I've singled out here it's still a great romantic comedy Anime.
All the girls still love Tenchi, and as is the norm in the other Tenchi shows, Ryoko and Ayeka can't stop fighting over him. Now they have even more competition, a cute girl named Sakuya works her way into Tenchi's heart, which makes for hillarious moments between all of the original Tenchi characters. We also get to enjoy more of Mihoshi's unerring ability to drive Kiyone nuts.
Without giving too much away, I just want to say that overall I forgot about the crummy animation in favor of the story which is classic Tenchi. It's emotionally involving, funny and very fun to watch and I reccomend this to anybody. Just be warned that you've proably already seen better artwork in the other timelines.
I gave it four stars becasue of the lesser-quality art. I should give it 5 just for not being ""Pretty Sammy"", but 4 is good.",1032912000,,1509,4.510948905109489
7892085,4,6305621780,"I'm sure that those who have been continuosly watching the series will find these episodes both fun, humourous and emotionally interesting.  The animation is somewhat disapointing from what Tenchi fans have seen in the OVA series and Tenchi Universe.  However the excellent plot and well thought out story lines of these episodes should keep you interested.  The first episode Old friends is a continuation of the struggle for the Tenchi Family to reunite after the huge battle caused by Yugi at the Masaki Shrine.  This episode shows Mihoshi and Kiyone antics and comedy and has mix of Ryoko's emotional ideas, which creates a great combination.  The last episode is exceptional because it shows us the secrets of Sakuya Kumishiro's past, Tenchi's current steady girlfriend, that gives a great lead off into the next dvd, this dvd requires more special features and thankfully includes a scene acess for each of the episodes.  If you truly are a Tenchi fan that i'm sure those of you who have been keeping up with the series will enjoy these episodes!",994464000,,1052,4.948863636363637
7892086,5,6305621780,These are three great episodes of a great series and I reccomend it for  all you Tenchi fans out there. It really has some great laughs for you.,964656000,,144,4.142857142857143
7892087,4,6305621780,"what can i say, one of the best shows to come out of japan, with many spinoffs and soon coming to cartoon network. i think it may get the kind of attention that dbz does and might even spark another craze with pretty  sammy i definately reccomend purchasing this",961372800,,262,4.346938775510204
