When last we saw the Lep he was in L.A. looking for a bride but this time he is in Vegas baby. Odds are someone has messed with his gold and he is out for revenge, of course that is what happens every time so it is a safe bet. This film is one of the most fun of the series and the Vegas setting just adds to that.

One night a man brings in a statue to a pawn shop and warns the broker not to take the gold chain off of the statue. Of course after he leaves the owner does just the opposite and takes it off, plus there is also the pot of gold. Of course the Leprechaun comes to life and while in the back with the store owner a guy comes in and sees one gold coin and takes it. It just so happens that the coin will grant one wish, he wishes for good luck at the tables.

That all sets off a chain of events in which the coin goes from one person to the next granting wishes, one at a time. This of course sets the Leprechaun off on a detective like story as he hunts and tracks it down. Without a doubt this is a fun flick and not to be taken seriously at all. Warwick Davis is excellent as always and even gets to play the Lep as some different type of characters. This film was directed by Brian Trenchard-Smith who also directed the next film in the series as well as Night of the Demons 2 and a personal favorite Arctic Blast. His style was perfect for this series and I was glad he returned for the forth film.

This flick was written by David DuBos and I thought he did a great job as this film was very funny. Now other than Warwick and the guy who played Fazio and the woman he conspires with the acting is all B level. Those mentioned above are excellent and I wish I could remember their names [will update later] but they were great, the leads not as much, one in particular. Still over all this is a very fun flick and one I would recommend.",1414713600,,1870,3.939153439153439

663646,3,6303460097,"The Leprechaun is back again from certain death to wreak havok on Las Vegas. A frantic, injured man brings a frozen Leprechaun into a pawn shop and insists that the shopkeeper not touch the medallion hanging around its neck. What's the very first thing he does? Tammy, all waist and hips, brings Scott into the casino where she works as a magician's assistant, for him to just look around. Yeah, right. Scott can't resist gambling - I call him Gamblor! - and cashes the $23,000 check his parents gave him for college. He runs across the street to the pawn shop to sell his watch for more gambling money, only to find a dead shopkeeper, along with a gold shilling belonging to the Leprechaun. Ah, the old one-short. The OCD Leprechaun has exactly 100 shillings to keep track of. New rules: The owner of a shilling gets a wish. Also, if all the coins are destroyed, so is the Leprechaun. The coin finds its way to Fazio, the gay disco magician, who has a Dennis DeYoung vibe. That's bad. Scott gets bit by the Leprechaun, and is infected like a zombie. He's suddenly really into potatoes and rhyming. This is easily the silliest of the first three Leprechaun movies, and that's saying a lot.",1365292800,,1189,4.5607476635514015

Plus a young hot Jennifer Aniston,didin't hurt much either(wink! wink!) ""Leprechaun 2"" was a fair sequel,although not as good as the first. But,this movie right here is an absolute joke. The acting is so incredibly horrid,that I could hardly stand to keep watching the stupid movie until the end. The plot is probally the dumbest I have ever seen in a ""horror movie"" before. Some unlucky chump goes to Las Vegas,meets a hot blonde,gets bit by Leprechaun then starts to turn into one himself??? What the hell?

663650,5,6303460097,"Released to video in 1995, ""Leprechaun 3"" is the second sequel in the series about a hideous little leprechaun (Warwick Davis) who likes to kill those who take from his pot of gold. This one's set in Las Vegas and features a young dude who gets infected with the Leprechaun's green blood and starts to morph into a (taller) leprechaun himself (John Gatins).

Although ""Leprechaun 3"" plays it pretty straight there's also quite a bit of camp. Regardless, it's nigh impossible to take seriously due to the cartooney leprechaun; consequently, the film is more comedy than horror. In fact, it's not horrifying at all. But it IS entertaining, and that's the name of the game.

As my title blurb would suggest, ""Leprechaun 3"" is well worth watching or owning for the character of Tammy alone, played by the magnificent Lee Armstrong. It's great to have a intelligent, winsome female protagonist with actual and natural curves, rather than the usual too-thin blondes with chicken legs and fake breasts. Lee blows them all out of the water and her outfit here only accentuates her appeal. Too bad she left acting behind the same year ""Leprechaun 3"" was released (1995), but at least we have this film to remember her awe-inspiring beauty.

The film runs 90 minutes and was shot in Las Vegas.

663762,2,6303460097,"I am a fan of the 'Leprechaun' series. I really enjoyed the magical slasher element along with the humor in parts 1, 4 and especially 5. After watching part 3, I was very disappointed though. Once again, we get a change in powers and myths and the beginning of this chapter has no connection with the end of the last one. The change of setting is fine, but we definitely don't get enough of the leprechaun in the first half of the film. Instead we get stuck with lots of gambling and magic acts. The acting, especially by the lead male is pretty bad and the only thing that stands out is how underrated Warwick Davis is as he outshines the rest of the cast in the acting department. You can get this movie in a couple of different 'Leprechaun' sets. I wouldn't recommend you buy this movie on it's own even if you are a fan of the series.",1306022400,,838,4.24375

The Leprechaun (Warwick Davis) has some very funny lines and rhymes and is the undisputed star of the show. There are a lot of special effects used for both comedy and for horror. This is the third of about four of these type of films, and the only one I thought worth keeping, mainly for the laughs. Eventually, the quality of the tape was so bad I canned it. I won't buy the DVD until they give us a widescreen version.

Lee Armstrong provided the female lead role and she was a pretty woman but obviously not much of an actress and few people have heard of her before or since.

663767,3,6303460097,"Leprechaun 3 was a last minute choice by your pal, Sid the Elf. The greatest reviewer of b since the great Joe Bob Briggs, Sid was all set to pop in a Norris flick. But, then we decided to embrace our elf brethern in honor of St. Patty's day. Actually, there are a few tie-ins here. It is an absolute certainty that this flick was shown on Joe Bob's drive-in theatre. Many times. And Irish Sid took a cue from the b legend Chuck Norris himself. This little guy was kicking butt at an obscene ammount. Sid was not exactly what you would call sharp during his viewing of Leprechaun 3, but we swore we heard Irish Sid say ""I don't need a weapon, I am one"" at one point.

This is in the all-time pantheon of late night cable movies because it had no plot at all. So, you could be watching the flick and flipping between like 3 other things at the same time and not miss a thing. You would catch Irish Sid doing something cool, like when he bit off the Indian pawn shop owner's ear then said, ""Mmm, I like Indian food. So spicy!"" Oh boy! That's genuine b. Then you could watch something else for 15 or 20 min, come back and not be confused because there was absolutely nothing going on except the leprechaun running around like a little nutcase. Perfect for what it is.

But, and we know this might seem strange coming from Sid, this one might have actually been a little too b for its own good. Just hear us out. They knew this movie was going to be terrible from the jump, that's when you start to see all those one-liners. Somehow though, it kind of works coming from an elf. He was actually the bright spot in the flick. They are God's little punchlines. And the chick was stacked so that's always good. Also, the main chacter, Scott was classic. He was the punniest, lamest, whimpiest geek! Anyone who got a ""Rowsdower!"" anytime he appeared on screen is going to get a baster up from Sid. That's all the good. Here's what killed the movie: there were no actors to hang your hat on. At least Jack Klompus was in 2. And Derrick Morris, Jennifer Aniston, and Larry were in the first one. There wasn't even anybody that could be pegged with the classic Dom Cruise, Sal Pachino type joke in Leprechaun 3. This is absolutely essential to a hillarious b viewing. The only candidate was the magician, who Sid commented might be Jimmy Baio. Only this guy wasn't funny. His acting was so bad that he couldn't be made fun of, it would have been too obvious. It was the acting equivilant of curling up in the fetal position to avoid being attacked by a grizzly bear. And the other reason this guy wasnt's funny? It turns out he actually was Jimmy Baio. Just sucked the enjoyment right out of the filck.

One last thing Sid didn't mention, this was supposed to be horror. Again it tried to be more funny than scary which is a cardinal sin for a horror flick. The only thing that inspires fear about Leprechaun 3 is that you know there's a Leprechaun 4. And the premise of that one? Leprechaun in space. Read that again. The possibilities are endless. Look for a Sid review on that one in the near future.",1206057600,2,3091,4.325862068965518
663768,5,6303460097,This dvd edition is ok but the german version by BMG is widescreen and has Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound but as far as I can see that edition is available nowhere,1140220800,,165,4.1875
663769,3,6303460097,"This review refers to the edition found in Trimark's ""Leprechaun: Pot of Gore Collection"" boxed set.

THE WHO'S WHO: Starring Warwick Davis, John Gatins, Lee Armstrong, Marcelo Tubert, John DeMita, Caroline Williams, Michael Callan. Score Composed By Dennis Michael Tenney. Directed By Brian Trenchard-Smith. (R) For Violence, Very Mild Gore, Profanity, Nudity and Sexual Content; 94m.; 1995.

WHAT'S GOING ON IN HERE?: They say the third time's the charm and this film tries its hardest to prove that theory correct. Our nasty little Leprechaun friend (Warwick Davis) has wound up in Las Vegas with his ever present pot of gold at his side. But when one of the shillings finds its way into the hands of college-bound Scott (John Gatins), the Leprechaun's infamous killing instincts surface once more. A new twist to the story this time dictates that the bearer of a Leprechaun's gold shilling will receive one wish. This comes into play often and, more often than not, backfires on the unsuspecting wish recipients. Director Brian Trenchard-Smith (best known prior to this for ""Night of the Demons 2"") brings a bit more humor and warmth to the series, infusing the slight story with charming characters and less bloodshed. Instead of being a drawback to the story, the minimal gore actually makes this film more enjoyable (Did I just say that? Who said that?) The personable cast also leaves their own unique impression on the viewer. John Gatins is a bright, more capable leading man than Charlie Heath could ever have dreamed of being but Lee Armstrong (as Tammy Larson) loses something in the translation of her character, making long-time Leprechaun fans ache for the better days of Shevonne Durkin and Jennifer Aniston. Armstrong may fill out a costume nicely, but her dry delivery alternates between being too gruff and too squeaky which doesn't fit well with the general feeling of the film. John DeMita (as The Great Fazio) is funny in his own way but the best support comes from Caroline Williams who turns in a marvelous performance as aging casino croupier Loretta. Michael Callan (as Mitch) is another first-rate supporting cast member who does his best to play off the stereotypical trappings of his casino owner role. The silly subplot between Tony (Roger Hewlett) and Arthur (Tom Dugan) trying to get money from Mitch could have easily been a distraction, but instead provides the film more opportunities for comic banter. As usual, Warwick Davis owns the film with his performance as the title monstrosity. The best moments come when the Leprechaun does his imitations. He first crosses paths with an Elvis impersonator (Terry Lee Crisp) and then he shows up on a television set as a lawyer, a preacher and a fortune teller. As an added bonus, the witticisms written for Davis are ten times better than the ones he had to work with in ""Leprechaun 2"". Behind the camera, Gabe Bartalos' wonderful make-up effects for the Leprechaun still have the power to startle, even though we've seen the creation twice before. Unfortunately, Dennis Michael Tenney's new score is only of marginal interest and doesn't properly measure up when compared to the previous two backdrops. Overall, there are far worse ways to kill an hour and a half than watching this film. You'll smile more often than you'll scream, but the point of a good movie is to be entertaining in whatever form it takes. By playing the audience for laughs instead of chills, this film succeeds in being an agreeable continuation of a minor masterpiece.

THEY SAY THEY'RE SPECIAL BUT...: The 1.33:1 full screen presentation for this film is relatively clear and free of grain. Considering the low budget status of the production, one wouldn't normally expect such clarity, especially for a film with as many grey and muted tones as this one. I'm always surprised by how rich and full Trimark's ultra stereo process sounds and this disc is no exception. Most of the sound effects are just as crisp as the visuals while all of the dialogue is well separated and even. There is also a Spanish language audio track for this movie as well as English, French and Spanish subtitles. Subtitles are lemon yellow and are fairly easy to read. The front cover for this DVD finds the devilish Leprechaun hovering in a stormy sky above Las Vegas. Lying on the road leading to the city is the Leprechaun's green hat. The back cover has all of the now traditional elements for this series including photographs, information about the film and the twenty-four chapter stops that divide this ninety-five minute movie. For the first time in the franchise, the DVD itself has been silver-topped. The title of the film has been imprinted on the top of the disc, along with a few extra tidbits of information. Once again, the exact same booklet from the previous two DVDs (""Trimark DVD: The Ultimate in Home Entertainment"") can be found opposite the disc. Special features for this disc are limited to the original trailer (1:04) which is a regrettable bare bones affair that will probably steer just as many viewers away from this film as it will attract.

THE YOLK'S ON YOU: It's not much of a hidden feature, but it'll have to do. On the main menu for this disc, highlight the Trimark symbol in the lower right hand corner. You'll have access to trailers for the films ""Leprechaun"" (2:01), ""Leprechaun 2"" (1:16), ""Leprechaun 4: In Space"" (1:35) and ""Leprechaun in the Hood"" (which proclaims itself to be ""Leprechaun 5"") (1:56).

THE LEWD AND NUDE ALERT: Tammy Larson (Lee Armstrong) does a small striptease for Mitch (Michael Callan) while under the power of Mitch's wish but she comes to her senses just before she reveals anything. On the plus side, she does look extraordinarily hot in her black bra. After Tammy leaves, the lucky libidinous viewer is treated to another striptease. This time it's from a woman (Heidi Staley) on Mitch's television who winds up baring her luscious boobs. She also shows a hint of her black thong when she exits the television and begins to seduce Mitch.

THE GORE REPORT: There's a tiny amount of gore when a pawn shop clerk has part of his ear and his left big toe bitten off by the Leprechaun. Another small occurence finds Scott (John Gatins) receiving a nasty bite on his left arm. One woman explodes but there's very little in the way of actual gore. There is some nice blood during the ""saw the man in half"" sequence, but that's as gory as this entry gets.

SAY AGAIN: ""So who do you work with, I mean, magician wise?"" - Scott (John Gatins). ""Right now, I'm assisting The Great Fazio."" - Tammy Larson (Lee Armstrong). ""What's a Fazio?"" - Scott (John Gatins). ""Well, Scott, a Fazio is a mediocre magician who couldn't pull a rabbit out of a pet store."" - Tammy Larson (Lee Armstrong).

THE FINAL SAY: Yes, I recommend buying this DVD. If you've gone the way of the boxed set, ""Leprechaun 3"" is certainly a welcome addition. If you're buying it separately, this film still has a wealth of entertainment to offer. By changing the style of the movie in their subtle comedic fashion, the filmmakers have crafted a gratifying experience that fans of the series will definitely want to own in their private collections.

663883,3,6303460097,"The first entry in the ""Leprechaun"" franchise arrived on the scene in 1993, with the second appearing as if by magic the following year. Why not keep the trend going and release ""Leprechaun 3"" in 1995? That is exactly what the movers and shakers behind the ""Leprechaun"" series did, probably thinking that striking a rapidly cooling griddle is better than striking one when it is ice cold. Once again calling on diminutive star Warwick Davis to play the wicked elf, the individuals responsible for ""Leprechaun 3"" decided to move the setting to Las Vegas where the lure of bright lights and the thrill of gambling could provide a suitable backdrop for the machinations of the leprechaun. Does this move work? Sort of, even though ""Leprechaun 3"" suffers from numerous problems that only get worse from this point on: atrocious acting, increasingly lame sight gags and jokes, cheaper budgets, annoying characters, and a failure to follow rules established in earlier films. Despite these glaring failings, ""Leprechaun 3"" is really the last film I am able to say I enjoyed in the franchise. Parts four and five simply collapse under the weight of the aforementioned problems.
In ""Leprechaun 3"" the little beastie appears in Las Vegas when a haggard looking fella stumbles into a pawnshop lugging a big bundle. It turns out that this package is our old friend the leprechaun, frozen into a little statue due to some jeweled necklace. The guy sells the statue to the pawnshop owner for chump change and as quick as you can say ""Begorrah,"" the greedy employee removes the necklace and unleashes the malevolent force that is Warwick Davis decked out in knickers and pepperoni faced makeup. The pot of gold appears as well, and since we all know by this time that the slimy sprite cannot stand to see humans pawing his precious coins, the pawnshop guy promptly incurs the wrath of the little devil. It is also during these opening sequences that we learn the rules of the game have changed once again: now the leprechaun cannot stand the presence of other leprechauns and his gold coins suddenly have the power to grant their possessor one wish. Obviously, this knowledge sets up the idea that another leprechaun will challenge Warwick Davis and that several people will find one of the coins and make wishes.
Enter Scott McCoy, an impressionable kid driving to Southern California so he can start school in a few weeks. He quickly meets local cutie Tammy Larsen, a young lady who works for a hack magician at the Shamrock, one of the cheaper looking casinos on the strip. Tammy agrees to sneak Scott into the casino so he can see what Las Vegas is all about, and it isn't too long before the inevitable happens. Scott gambles away the twenty thousand dollars his parents gave him for school and goes to the pawnshop where the leprechaun went on a bloody rampage. McCoy finds a coin, figures out how to make a wish, and wins big time at the tables. In the meantime, we follow Tammy's adventures with her unctuous boss Fazio and the lecherous owner of the casino named Mitch. Mitch owes some money to a couple of local goons (can't have a movie set in Las Vegas without a mafia reference, huh?), but really has an eye for Tammy's expansive cleavage. Rounding out the cast is casino employee Loretta, a big haired, screechy lady who spends way too much time lamenting the loss of her youthful figure. I won't spoil the unfolding hijinks for you, but most of the characters learn about the magic coin and make their greedy little wishes with often tragic, and gory, results. During the course of the movie, we see somebody swell up and explode, a body sawed in half, and a cheesy electrocution. It's all done in good fun and is occasionally entertaining.
I definitely appreciated a gorier, sleazier ""Leprechaun"" movie. What I didn't welcome was the acting, which certainly ranks as some of the poorest in the series (although not as bad as the Bridget character in the second film). The guy who plays Scott and the woman in the Tammy role are the worst offenders. Every time these two appeared on screen I could literally smell the sour odor of their performances wafting off of my television set. These two are so bad that even my DVD player belched derision over their ham handed antics. Fortunately, the other actors do slightly better, and Warwick Davis is great as always as the leprechaun. In fact, my favorite scene in the movie occurs when Davis is strolling down the streets of Las Vegas looking for his stolen coin. Here's this evil, ugly looking monster moving in and out of crowds of people and no one notices him! Moreover, he occasionally cackles loudly for no apparent reason during his jaunt. I laughed so hard over this scene that I watched it several more times just to get the full effect of the whole thing.
The DVD is the same as other Trimark ""Leprechaun"" discs. The picture transfer looks good and there are several trailers for this film and other installments in the series. After viewing all of the ""Leprechaun"" movies, I would like to see a commentary from Warwick Davis on at least one of these DVDs. I would like to hear what the man himself has to say about these films. Anyway, ""Leprechaun 3"" is worth watching if you have a couple of hours to spare and can't think of anything better to do. If nothing else, this movie is the only place you will ever see a flaming dwarf flying though the air, and that ought to be worth something.",1068854400,4,5450,4.689979123173278

7848582,4,6303460097,"Warwick Davis, Las Vegas, and infectious Leprechaunthropy.
MY CALL:  This sequel is just plain sillylike, even sillier than part 2which was even more ludicrous than part 1.  It's stupid and funny and it knows exactly what it is.  As long as you understand what you're about to watch, you'll probably enjoy this.

The writing quality is bottom shelf as always, as we find a double amputee in a Las Vegas pawn shop selling a life size Leprechaun statue so he can ""buy gas and get out of town.""  Such refined exposition, isn't it? Our desperate statue pawner warns to leave the ostentatious medallion on the statue, which of course the shop owner removes almost immediately.  The punishment for which is apparently that the Leprechaun (Warwick Davis) animates, rambles in rhyming limerick, and bites off his ear and toe before scrambling off with his gold.  And naturally, a single coin is left behind.
As laughable as this sounds, take note that in three years the world has witnessed as many Leprechaun movies!  So if the we the people disapprove, we're not exactly voting that opinion with our theater-going dollar.  But I, and much of the horror community, continue to delight in this movie series.

With sequels, the stakes tend to get bigger with each subsequent story.  Whereas part one had nothing of the sort, Leprechaun 2 (1994) boasted three wishes granted to a Leprechaun's captor.  But now in part 3, one wish per gold shilling is granted--which could mean 100 wishes!!!  We now have every reason to hope the Leprechaun wins because I'm simply not comfortable with someone wielding that kind of world-dominating power.  Moreover, these wishes are truly granted and not distorted as in Leprechaun 2 (1994), Wishmaster 1-4 (1997-2002) or The Monkey's Paw (2013).

Director Brian Trenchard-Smith (Night of the Demons 2, Leprechaun 4: In Space) has taken all of the already-shaky-at-best rules of evil Leprechauns and wishes and thrown them out the window.  Not only will a gold shilling grant you a wish, but when the coin changes hands each subsequent owner also gets a wish.  The only constant seems to be that Leprechauns are nearly immortal.

As our protagonists, Scott (John Gatins; Witchboard 2, Pumpkinhead II) and Tammy are pretty worthless characters.  But they offer up some campy comic relief.

After being bitten and exposed to the Leprechaun's magically toxic blood, Scott seems to be afflicted with Leprechaunthropy--which consists of an insatiable appetite for potatoes and impersonating Tom Cruise from Far and Away (1992) doing his impression of the Leprechaun.  Scott's transformation into a were-Leprechaun is slow and silly, he has a magical duel, and all the while Tammy is dressed in a slutty magician's assistant costume.

The real highlight for campy horror fans comes when Caroline Williams (The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2, Halloween II) wishes for beauty, then gets monkey pawed with grossly inflated boobs and butt by the Leprechaun--but it's nothing compared to what happened in Faust (2000). There's that, and of course the scene that somehow combined Frankenhooker (1990) and Deadly Friend (1986).

The director of one of these fine films once suggested that each Leprechaun movie was about a different Leprechaun, which is the only sensible notion in the entire series considering that we have seen three Leprechauns meet horrible deaths in three states (South Dakota, California and Nevada) in as many years.  But now with the inception of the communicable zombiechaun infection spread through bite, I'm shocked we have not yet seen a Leprechaunado or a Leprechaun Apocalypse.

All in all, this was extremely stupid but (with the right expectations) quite entertaining.  Warwick Davis has been unchained and permitted to go as over-the-top as he wishes, and it's pretty loony.",1463616000,,3814,5.131067961165049
