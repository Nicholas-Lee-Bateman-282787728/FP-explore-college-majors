1658724,5,B00005T30Y,"I teach both gender & communication and family communication and I have used this in my class.  Many of Gray's principles are based on solid communication theories, and can be easily put into practice.  Gray's premise is that indeed, men and women are different (most likely due to different socialization as children) and understanding and appreciating those differences are paramount to a good relationship.  The book asks for compromise on both sides, and a trust between partners in a relationship.  This DVD alone just gives a very brief overview of Gray's ideas, but alone, without actually reading his book, may leave some people with misconceptions about what he is suggesting.  I always follow up this program with a discussion that clarifies his principles.",1110499200,3,767,5.203252032520325
