3100801,2,B0012Z36DA,"I've been a fan of the BET Celebration of Gospel production's from their inception. But the for sale version of this one left me feeling cheated. They cut some very desirable performances by Yolanda Adams (featuring the ever-smooth Doc Powell) and Israel Houghton (featuring T-Bone, who burned it up that night) from the original taping. They also cut Steve Harvey's hosting spots. What's up BET? A disclaimer would have been appreciated.",1209945600,8,438,5.183098591549296

8248529,2,B0012Z36DA,I enjoyed Celebration of Gospel when it came on television. This DVD representation is not what showed on televison. There was so much cut out that I would have been better off recording off of television on a VHS tape even though I have a DVD recorder. They should have called this DVD Half of Celebration of Gospel because it sure was not the complete package.,1217548800,,362,4.5
8248530,5,B0012Z36DA,Love It Love It. This DVD has a lot of great gosple performances and artist. My favorite performances were Kirk Franklinn and of course Mr. Never Would Have Made It himself Marvin Sapp and Pastor Shirley Ceaser.,1215820800,,211,4.72972972972973
8248531,2,B0012Z36DA,"I was very excited when I heard this DVD came out because I enjoyed the TV version so much.  If you are looking for what you saw on TV, DO NOT PURCHASE this DVD.  They cut so much out of it, it's a shame.  Steve Harvey DOES NOT appear as the host -- you don't see anyone hosting, just SOME of the performers performing.  I did see him in one of the church choir scenes with BeBe Winnans, but they covered his face so you couldn't see him.  Maybe this has something to do with royalties and being paid, but I was very disappointed and will probably give the DVD away or let it collect dust on my shelf.",1211068800,5,601,4.016806722689076
8248532,1,B0012Z36DA,"When I saw Celebration of Gospel it was really good so i order it hoping too see all the performer's only to find some of the better performers cut, very sad day when I looked at this version.",1210377600,10,192,4.078947368421052
