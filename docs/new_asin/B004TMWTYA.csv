4465891,5,B004TMWTYA,"Una de las mejores si es que no la mejor serie de HBO, desafortunadamente muestra la cruda realidad de Mexico donde la corrupcion y la gente en el poder han echado a perder nuestro pais. Excelentes actuaciones de los protagonistas aunque se extrana en esta segunda parte a Alejandro Camacho.
Espermos con ansias la tercera temporada deseando este a la altura de las dos primeras.",1311379200,4,379,4.846153846153846

Outstanding. . . Story is strong. . . Production & Location really done well and the Cast is Outstanding !
I have traveled Mexico extensively along with all the Central American Countries and Colombia as well. This is a TRUE Representation of what life in  Mexico and it's Penal System would be like !

8440767,5,B004TMWTYA,"I purchased the original first Season of Capadocia, and was not disappointed with the Second or Third, though I must say that they were not as engaging as the first Season.  The actors are excellent, the plot unbeatable in exposing the corruption of government officials and others involved in the drug traffic.
