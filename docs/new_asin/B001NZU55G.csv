8328545,3,B001NZU55G,This is a typical kung-fu film from the 1970's.  Everything is here from the English dubbing to the non-stop fighting scenes.  The sound effects crew must have worked overtime on this film.  Bruce Li is good as the lead hero.,1508716800,,225,4.575
8328546,5,B001NZU55G,"Li is very good in this. Scott is also good. This film has nonstop action. The plot is a standard revenge theme. It's made more personal because you really care for the characters and really hate the bad guys. You really want the good guys to defeat the villain's who are cold blooded murderers. Very entertaining. I couldn't wait for the final showdown. Li delivers an exciting film. I have to watch all of his films now. Li pays respect to Bruce Lee in the film. I love Lee now I will watch all of Li's films. I think many people turned to Li because they missed Lee. However, Li is very talented in his own right. Recommended for fans of Kung Fu films.",1493942400,,655,4.290322580645161
8328547,4,B001NZU55G,"Another classic that brings old memories, I recall an interview I'd read about Carl Scott and being very impressed with his background and how he was able to really replicate the Chinese style fight techniques-he looked just as good as Bruce LI in this and as good as Billy Chong in their movies together. Good action here, especially with the Toad from '5 deadly venoms' involved.",1486166400,,381,4.787878787878788

8328549,5,B001NZU55G,"Great action, great fight scenes, skillful actors.  The plots tend to always be the same (avenging a murdered master, rescuing a kidnapped girl, challenging a drug lord, etc.).  But I watch them for the great choreographed fight scenes.",1402185600,,236,5.184210526315789
8328550,4,B001NZU55G,"Bruce Li (""Dynamo"") teams up with the great Lo Meng (""Kid With the Golden Arm"") and a young Carl Scott (""Sun Dragon"") to fight organized crime in 70s Hong Kong.  Let me say that this movie is unbelievably stupid, has TONS of fights, and is one of my favorite fu-flicks, ever!

We start with Bruce Li, Lo Meng, and their mutual romantic interest (lovely woman, never seen her before or since) coming to Hong Kong on a small boat, just about to give up hope when they see land.  Once there, the boys have no problem getting work, but get into trouble when they defend a young black man (Scott) being bullied by the rich, white employees.  They kick the crap out of everyone and all 3 lose their jobs.  Word of this fight gets around the city quickly as all future attempts at employment are met with obstacles from either the dudes they beat up or acquaintances of the dudes they beat up, particularly the city's big boss man, played with typical awesomeness by Ku Feng (""Avenging Eagle"").

Though this release is listed as ""uncut"", it is exactly the same as my old VHS copy, complete with the alternate ending, which is not a special feature, but plays after the film's ending.  As the back cover lists the things that were edited from other versions and I noticed nothing new, I'll have to assume that this is NOT uncut.  This copy is the only one I know of available in the U.S. on DVD and is a bootleg from Bonzai Media, making the price as silly as the film.  If you love cheesy 70s kung fu I would recommend this but not when it's this expensive.  English dubbed only, and poorly, which suits me just fine.

8328551,5,B001NZU55G,"I really love this film and don't care if this is uncut or not. I saw it so many times that I know every word they say.
I don't understand why there are so many people worldwide that think alike and the film is still almost unknown, but you can find it on youtube, amazon, so there must be some reason.
Of course its violent and sad, but I still like the way someone can recover from bad things that might happen to you.",1287619200,,420,4.011904761904762
8328552,4,B001NZU55G,"This is a verry good Bruceploitation movie, I like it alot, maybe because I saw it many times as a Kid BUT this release is so far away from ""UNCUT"" as it can be. I went verry dissapointed wen I saw this release because I really was looking foward to see this uncut as it suppose to be according the text on the cover, its really violent.
I hope one day someone will create a REAL UNCUT DVD of this one.

8328553,4,B001NZU55G,"this isn't a bad movie the fight choreography is very 70's style but with a heavyness to it, its still a good movie",1032825600,,115,4.043478260869565
8328554,5,B001NZU55G,"I saw this movie first time round back in 1983 and it was the first and best bruce lee imatation movie. As I come from the United Kingdom the version I saw came under the title THE TIGER STRIKES AGAIN(a.k.a. THE LAST STRIKE),and when it was re-released seven years later it was heavily cut (i.e. the nunchacku scenes,due to the stupid censorship laws in the uk,which are now more lenient,we were forbidden to see this amazing weapon in action.) so I decided buy it from amazon and boy was I glad I did so. It is really a simple plot involving freindship,love,betrayal,rape,murder and revenge but if you look beyond the awful dubbing and not so brilliant acting then you really can be pulled into it mainly because of of it's top notch martial arts coreography,which has to be li's finest hour. Okay I know he's no bruce Lee,and there will never be another Bruce Lee,but when it comes to seeing other imatations like Bruce Le,Dragon Lee,Bronson Lee and Bruce Liang he outshines them all and was a good martial arts performer in his own right. If your a hardcore kung fu fan and looking for a good leealike movie then your search has ended because this is the best of the BRUCEPLOITATION movies ever. You won't be disapointed.",1010707200,4,1224,4.6192660550458715
