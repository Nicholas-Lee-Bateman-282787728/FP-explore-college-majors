1373393,1,B00004YA6C,"Unfortunately I did, but only because it was $4.99 and reading thye description it sounded like a funny teen comedy.  I have always liked teen comedies, American pie, Road trip, Old school, 16 Candles, porky's, Last American virgin.  All of these I've enjoyed muliple times.  I understand these movies aren't cinematic masterpieces, but they are funny, and sometimes that is exactly what I want, brainless humor.  I thought Jailbait might be the same.

I don't care for MTV movies, with Election being the exception, and I didn't know this was an MTV movie.  That being said, I think you would need to be under 13 and mildly retarded to get anything from this film.

The story could be funny, but it isn't.  The characters (or caricatures) are mindless robots from the leads all the way down to the extras.  The movie is not sexy, it's almost anti-sex.  poorly written, poorly acted, poorly directed.  There is no one to root for or against and at 80 whatever minutes it is a snoozer.

Film is aimed at the road rules real world audience but I can't imagine them enjoying this either.",1108339200,5,1084,4.677248677248677
1373394,4,B00004YA6C,"ok, I just got this movie, and I liked it in the first place so it was nice to see it again in a lil better quality, my whole problem with this DVD is the lack of extras, or better yet the lack of having the semi-documentary of the actual Guy the movie was derived from, every time I saw this on MTV right afterwards they would tell the true story... what happened to that? other than that great flick, can see why people think its not so good, but those people are the ones that just won't get it in the first place.",1084924800,3,517,3.980769230769231
1373395,5,B00004YA6C,"Let me just say that I absolutely LOVED this movie.  And let me also say that have left my teen years some 20 years ago.  I am 33 and usually hate to have to suffer through any teen-oriented comedy like ""American Pie"" I saw recently which I found hopelessly unfunny, boring and stupid.  And most of the time, I don't even bother to try watching any other recent films dealing with young people's awakening about sex issues.
  This said, I happened to catch ""Jailbait"" on cable recently and was instantly sucked into the deeply effective editing and camera work involved, along with the very satirical directing and performances.  Even though the subject of statuary rape is a serious one, here it is treated in such a way that there is an awareness of the fact that this is high camp cinema and nothing depicted should be treated seriously.
  I was particularly impressed with the two young leads which have been brilliantly directed into delivering performances that are in total harmony with the whole tone of the movie.  This is a movie making fun of the whole ""teen-movies phenomenon"" all the while being totally aware of the fact that it is itself a ""teen movie"" but destined towards a more mature audience.
  Many potentially offensive objects subjects here treated as jokes but the director was brilliant enough to let us the audience see that this is a movie who doesn't take itself seriously.  Everything is so farfetched (with often hilarious results) that it tells us that the filmmaker expected nothing else than entertaining its audience with outrageous but finely tuned acting parodies and well-crafted camera work.
  I have seen many teen movies such as ""Scary Movie"" I and II, ""American Pie"" I and II and none of them compares to the wit and cleverness ""Jailbait"" displays.  A satire is probably the most difficult thing to achieve in cinema.  It has to contain a balance between outrageous stunts and self awareness.  Most teen movies pile up the gross factor, hoping to make audiences laugh.  But here, even though no joke clich is left unturned, it is done in a constant parody mode which I truly enjoyed.
  I don't know why the reviews here were so negative regarding this little jem.  Perhaps as I said before, this is probably a movie adult would enjoy more than teenagers.  I for one, who is a very harsh critic concerning movies, found this one able to do what most films can't:  entertain the hell out of me...",1012694400,4,2435,4.731591448931116
1373396,3,B00004YA6C,"The film is ok, but some of the acting is flat out bad. The woman running for mayor, the father, mother, the lawyer and the judge make their scenes nearly unbearable. The movie had potential to be good, so I gave it three stars. If you can get past some bad acting, and lame jokes from the older actors, then go ahead and buy it.",1006128000,,329,4.076923076923077
1373397,1,B00004YA6C,this movie blows. I really can't think of to many worse movies. It is flat out not funny. Really everything about it is bad. God I hate this movie.,1005177600,2,147,4.103448275862069
1373398,4,B00004YA6C,"This is a movie worth buying. It was not what I expected but it was also fairly amusing I would give it 3 1/2 stars. The movie discussed an important topic which is more often than not ignored in today's world. I have seen girls try to get back at ex-boyfriends by calling rape and later admitting to the lie. I thought it had a decent script but that the director tried to many silly shots to force the humor down your throat.
  I own this movie and do not regret spending $12 on it, when other dvd's are going for $30",978652800,2,519,4.078431372549019
1373399,4,B00004YA6C,"I very much enjoyed this movie when it was on MTV. It gave a good and humorous look at a very important and none humorous subject of statutory  rape which is not something one can generally laugh at. I felt that it the  movie did a good job of not necessarily showing the cold hard truth of it,  but more of what could happen, and what does happen in the movie isn't  always good. This movie also could be effective as a teaching tool in  school for students to help give them a better understanding of sex and  relationships.",969235200,4,526,4.262626262626263
1373400,1,B00004YA6C,"I saw 'Jailbait' when it was first on MTV.  I was looking foward to a stupid, funny entertaining teen sex comedy.  What I got was a stupid,  unfunny, offputting, offensive, teen pregnancy so-called 'comedy'.  I  happen to like MTV movies- I enjoyed '2gether', etc. but this was just  plain bad.

7927111,3,B00004YA6C,I liked this movie. It's funny and cheesy. I hate that the copy I got froze and skipped. Poor quality for a used DVD.,1381449600,,117,3.9166666666666665
7927112,4,B00004YA6C,This movie is funny. I like it. But I do not like the full nudity that is shown in the beginning. It was like I was watching a porno film! I watched this movie when it first came out on MTV and I was shocked when I now watched this movie on dvd to see what they could not show on TV. I was shocked this stuff was in there! I gave this movie 4 stars cause I would watch it again. It's not a bad movie as long as I just skip the beginning and watch the rest.,1381190400,,456,3.6161616161616164
