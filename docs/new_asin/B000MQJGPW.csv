2739229,4,B000MQJGPW,It's a good video and seems to work if you practice the tips presented. Give it to a friend when you're done!,1227398400,5,109,4.0
2739230,5,B000MQJGPW,"An excellent resource for both instructors and pet owners.  Leslie Nelson offers a clear and instructive guide to training a reliable emergency recall for all dogs, particularly for the 'difficult' dogs bred to work independently (terriers, hounds, northern breeds).  Easy to understand and use - a valuable addition to any dog lover's library.",1209686400,13,344,5.471698113207547
2739231,5,B000MQJGPW,"Whether you are a newbie or an instructor who teaches recall classes, as I do, this DVD belongs in your library.  Leslie is one of the trainers who has gotten this right!  And, unlike other methods that work with biddable dogs, this works on the ""not so Lassie"" dogs, too, so long as the reinforcer is something the dog is willing to work for.",1192924800,5,343,4.34375
2739232,5,B000MQJGPW,"Great DVD for the average pet owner to start working with their dog on an emergency recall. There is also a section for those who own hounds, terriers or northern breeds that are less inclined to come when called. Learn how to use the name game, rules of a really reliable recall and the three reasons why it may be failing.

The goal is a reliable emergency recall but the added bonus is that you are building a better relationship with your dog as well as a regular recall.

There's also a section if you are in instructor on how and when to incorporate it in your classes.

This really should be a 'must have' for every dog owner.

Leslie will be a guest author at CSDogBookReview in August 2007, come check her out!",1173830400,8,719,4.343283582089552
2739233,4,B000MQJGPW,"Very easy to understand & follow the simple step by step instructions for teaching a dog to come when called. I would have given it 5 stars if the DVD was actually ""new"" as described. The DVD does work as it's supposed to, but I did not appreciate the fact that it's obviously used & had a dirty case when I received it.",1396915200,,320,4.095238095238095
2739234,5,B000MQJGPW,I don't know why they require more words on reviews? So I am waisting your time reading this as I am my waisting time doing them a FAVOR!!!!,1376006400,,140,4.035714285714286
2739235,5,B000MQJGPW,"This is a clear, step by step video by a very good dog trainer on how to get your dog to come to you EVERY time, in ANY situation.  If there is one thing we want our dogs to do it is COME WHEN CALLED.  I have had my dogs ignore me when chasing game, chasing snow mobiles, chasing skiiers, etc.  These are dogs that always come when called EXCEPT...when something more exciting is going on.  This video specifically addresses the issue of teaching that EMERGENCY, ALWAYS COME NOW recall.  I am already working on the foundational steps with my puppy.

If you have ever had a dog that did the ""wait a minute"" recall, you need this video.  If your dog ever runs into traffic, or after a bull moose, or out onto a lake with bad ice, you'll wish you'd trained them to come to an emergency recall.  I am very excited to know this training technique.  All positive, no punishment.",1361318400,6,873,4.306748466257669
2739236,3,B000MQJGPW,"This is a useful tool if you are a proponent of treat based training, albeit an expensive book for the information presented.",1353974400,,125,4.7272727272727275
2739237,5,B000MQJGPW,"If you want to teach your dog to come when it really counts, Leslie Nelson's Really Reliable Recall - or some variation of it - is probably the most-used method by positive reinforcement dog trainers today. If coming when called is all you really want from your dog, then invest in the DVD and/or the booklet. In regard to coming when called, if I could only recommend one product, I would have to go with Leslie Nelson's Really Reliable Recall.",1338940800,3,445,4.575
2739238,5,B000MQJGPW,"This DVD is great.  I recommend it all the time.  My dog does agility, which requires him to be able to be off lead in open parks, so we needed a good recall.  The steps in the DVD helped so much in creating a reliable recall with my dog.  Before I got the DVD, he would come when called in my house, but that's about it.  Now he'll come running every single time I call, even at the dog park when there's 30 dogs around that he wants to play with.  It's awesome.  I highly recommend it if you're wanting to be able to let your dog off leash in unfenced areas.",1325376000,5,560,3.9464285714285716
2739239,5,B000MQJGPW,"This DVD is well organized, illustrated with videos and power point highlights and a super addition to your recall training.",1301270400,2,124,5.25
2739240,5,B000MQJGPW,"I have a Shiba Inu who thinks ""come"" means ""catch me if you can.""  It's a great game for him, but not for me.  I have used the reliable recall method and am finally getting him to understand to come means good stuff.  The video also referenced a dog camp for which I signed up and loved.  Excellent video.  Employ its techniques and you'll get results.",1287878400,3,352,4.2727272727272725
2739241,4,B000MQJGPW,This is a very good product. Easy to understand video. It is pretty good but I bought Pam Dennison's Whistle Recall and I like it better,1269820800,,136,4.269230769230769
2739242,5,B000MQJGPW,"This DVD isn't just about sit,heal and stay. It covers more then that like establishing a great relationship with your dog and how to do it. There are a number of actual demonstrations and training techniques that are fun for the owner and the dog like hide and go seek to train the dog to look for you when it's off leash. It shows that training doesn't have to be this serious and grinding effort to get the dog under control. Leslie is very light hearted but very knowledgeable. She makes training more fun!",1250380800,13,510,4.4361702127659575
8170948,4,B000MQJGPW,Good ideas for training.,1521244800,,24,5.25
8170949,2,B000MQJGPW,"This wasn't very much help.  I guess if you are new to training and have a puppy you''re starting out it might be helpful.  I found a lot of holes in the training though.  And although she says it's great for dog breeds that are resistant to recalls, it's not.  It was wasted money.",1516838400,,282,4.166666666666667

8170952,4,B000MQJGPW,Leslie Nelson was in the seminar and taught us about how to motivate dogs for recall. It is good but a little costly for a 90 mins DVD.,1502409600,2,135,3.857142857142857

8170956,3,B000MQJGPW,"Recommended by our trainer.  Standard advise, but our OCD Goldendoodle, too smart.  Burt has been and will always be our perpetual teenager personality dog.",1421971200,,156,5.458333333333333
