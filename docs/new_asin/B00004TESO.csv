7922469,5,B00004TESO,Just purchased. My wife and I are in the All Aboard For Eureka portion. We were on our honeymoon and dressed up for dinner in the dining car the night they were shooting for the video. We received a complimentary VHS but it's from 1993 and I'd be afraid to put it in the VCR. I took it to a video store but they wouldn't convert it since it was copyrighted. Would have liked to have gotten the one with the All Aboard For Eureka cover but it was out of stock.,1444262400,,459,4.0
7922470,4,B00004TESO,I bought this item to replace the VCR I originally purchased at Pike's Peak.  It was vacation time with my late wife.,1395273600,,117,4.318181818181818
7922471,5,B00004TESO,"This is the same DVD as All Aboard For Eureka but with a different package cover. Order the cover you like best (or whatever is in stock)
