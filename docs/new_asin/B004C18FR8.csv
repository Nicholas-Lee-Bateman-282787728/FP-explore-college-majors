8494763,4,B004C18FR8,"I gave this dated Brute Force VHS show, yes VHS, because it is the only program I have found on the Airland Battle doctrine of the US Army. It details the five major weapon systems needed to execute the Airland Battle strategy. It is narrated by George C. Scott and it well produced and the footage is mostly new to me. This is coming from someone who is interested and collects military dvds, so I have seen a lot of them. It also details the origins of Airland Battle in the German Blitzkreig of WWII. I didn't give it a five star rating because the footage, content and subject matter is dated. The military has already deployed more advanced technology and equipment. But that said it does go into the first Gulf War a little bit which validated this doctrine. This is more for the military enthusiast than someone with a general or passing interest in the Brute Force series of shows.",1372377600,,889,4.493827160493828
