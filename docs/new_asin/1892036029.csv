Finally!  A VIDEO series which explores and explains the ranges of human consciousness, as well as a future of human potential we can only imagine, and with some of the greatest thinkers of our time.  Brilliantly conceived and executed, this is an extraordinary piece of work, and one, in which I am looking forward to a sequel.
Illuminating, and powerful, this series is a ""must see"" for anyone delving into the questions we have all asked: Where are we going, what is our purpose in life, and what is the purpose of our planet?  As we are led deeply into unknown spheres, we are confronted, in this remarkable series, with the ""Black Hole"" of our own consciousness.  This is exciting!
Barbara Marx Hubbard is an affable and charming host -- brilliant and profound, yet accessible and earthy.",970444800,,822,4.85
