8116575,4,B000F2CALA,"Two films: Snake Girl is just Ok (that's why 4 stars), with some shocks, but it is THE WISH that scared me to death. The doll the boy creates is downright terrifying and makes Chucky seem like Shirley Temple. Truly, one of the most horrific images on a low budget. If remade witrh big bucks, THE WISH could scare the pants of you. This doll is scary.",1180915200,,350,4.2388059701492535
8116576,1,B000F2CALA,"Ok, vol 1 was better, but anything would be. This dvd series has a nice vocal theme that's very good.  This set has 2 unoriginal and forgetable stories that star mainly children, and were made for children ( actually most likely they weren't which would ask who were they made for ). The wish is the better of the two, but considering snake girl is plain awful that's not saying much. Some great visuals wasted here. Also the stories are too long. I am not really sure what Mr. Umezz's famous for, but this is a disaster. I'm afraid vol 3 which is on the way loses because of this effort. Buy or rent? Maybe neither.",1159488000,2,616,4.310344827586207
