8675450,5,B00MZ3X6E2,Hilarious if you're a metal fan :P and you can watch it in like.. 3 hours or something xD,1485043200,,89,3.736842105263158
8675451,5,B00MZ3X6E2,This is one of the best animes me or my wife (she's from Japan) have seen. It's hilarious and should be bought by everyone. The blu ray makes the video perfectly clear so it's better than the dvd which I also bought.,1478822400,,216,4.166666666666667
8675452,4,B00MZ3X6E2,"The series is short, fast-paced and hilarious, though I should say the East takes a different attitude than the west with MANY controversial topics, so if you're easily triggered by sexual-oriented content and language, I'd skip this one.  The price is DEFINITELY right, but this release is pretty bare-bones.  One menu for episode navigation (no play all option, though you can keep skipping to the next chapter when the episode's finished), one sub-menu for ads for other Sentai Works releases.  No language options, just Japanese audio with subtitles, but the dialogue's so frantically paced that dubbing it would probably be a nightmare.

Only complaint is that they took some liberties with the translation to make it more ""metal"" I suppose you could say; only slightly distracting if you know what you're hearing isn't the same as what you're reading.  Overall, pretty decent subtitle job.  Just a shame the series was so short!

Looks and sounds great on Bluray.  If you're into dark comedy and don't mind toilet humor, there's a lot of fun to be had with Detroit Metal City.  Just keep in mind, the pacing is FRANTIC, so you REALLY can't look away for long without missing something!",1446508800,2,1191,4.944723618090452

8675454,5,B00MZ3X6E2,Ignore the low star rating as it was written before this official release. Funny and awesome as hell all rolled into one.,1424304000,,121,4.545454545454546

This product's Hong Kong-made, but is ""C"", there is a possibility that you have complied with there is region code of mainland China.
Can not do anything at the moment anyway.",1409788800,2,342,4.532258064516129
