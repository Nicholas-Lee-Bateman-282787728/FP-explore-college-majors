6388332,5,B00JPJC8RK,"No loose ends after viewing the last season with Krister Henriksson. Pretty good adaptation of the last novel The Troubled Man, yet incorporating the feel-good, justice-is-served moral of the Swedish TV audience. Stunning cinematography, core ensemble delivering plot-anchoring performances of harsh and gritty at odds with sentimental. Delicious music throughout, but I got a little tired of the theme song ""Perfect Circle"" by the end, considering that the title character's entrance into that ""perfect"" circle was pretty darn depressing...",1403827200,,541,5.860759493670886
6388333,5,B00JPJC8RK,"Beyond awesome. Krister Henriksson is perfection portraying the slow decline of beloved detective Kurt Wallander. I cried at the end of the last episode, and that's saying something. As in all previous episodes, the acting, direction, lighting, shooting, props, everything is top notch. Well worth the money. I lent Season 3 to a friend, and when he's done with it, I'm going to watch it again ... and again.

If you have not watched seasons 1 and 2, do not start with 3. Wallander is a difficult character, and it takes time to understand, accept, and begin to love him. Only then will you get the full force of Kurt's gradual and heartrending decline into Alzheimer's disease. A tour de force from Henriksson.",1403740800,5,711,4.780487804878049
6388334,5,B00JPJC8RK,While they changed his illness around in the stories it was great.  Funny that we did not really notice they were speaking Swedish and we were looking at the sub titles.,1403136000,,169,4.451612903225806
6388335,5,B00JPJC8RK,The final season does not disappoint. Henriksson brilliantly depicts the final stage of the trajectory of the dogged police chief.,1401926400,4,130,5.55
6388336,5,B00JPJC8RK,"Let me start by saying that the total of 32 movies in the Henriksson Wallander series are without a doubt, one of my all-time favorites... and I have watched A LOT of tv/movies in my lifetime. Before getting to the 6 final episodes in series 3, I will say that series 1 is still my favorite, easily deserving of a full 5 star rating. Series 2 was also right up there... maybe something like 4.8 stars.  While this 3rd series is still excellent and continues to improve from a technical aspect, it is the third best of the 3 series IMO, rating around the 4.5-4.6 star range.

Henriksson is back in the title role as Kurt Wallander (it was thought for a long time that there would never be a 3rd series, esp staring him) and he is a amazing as ever. Truly an excellent actor that sadly, much of the world outside of Scandinavia doesn't really know. The stories are also really good... maybe not quite as strong overall as the first 2 series, but it is a bit difficult to come up with completely fresh ideas after already doing 26 90-minute movies. A lot of the regular supporting characters are back, including Svartman, Ebba, Martinsson & Nyberg.  Linda Wallander is also back, although played by a different actress than in series 1 due to the tragic death of Johanna Sllstrm in 2007. Charlotta Jonsson does a good job in the role, but it's just strange when you have someone else playing someone you got used as another face. There are a few new characters, including Linda's husband and daughter, as well as a new police chief and a love interest for Kurt.

As with the previous series, that almost mystical feel is still here. The producers make good use of music and other sound affects, as well as filming techniques to once again pull off the ambiance that has become well known and liked in the Swedish Crime Drama genre. There is also excellent acting across the main cast. However, where i think this series falls short (compared to the previous 2) is the lack of intrigue and interest in the new characters.  In series 1, you have Linda & Stefan, who were a very interesting side-topic to the main Wallander theme. Of course, the strong acting from both Johanna & Ola Rapace were a primary reason for this. Even with the letdown from neither of them being in series 2, you had the new characters Isabelle & Pontus (police rookies), who were both very compelling... especially Nina Zanjani (Isabelle)m, who is absolutely gorgeous btw:)  I just didn't connect with any of the new characters in series 3 the way I did with these couples from the first 2 series and that was kind of a let down.

I think the other 2 things that caused me to rate this slightly lower is the somewhat depressing subject matter of Kurt's illness, and of course, that this was only 6 episodes, and not the usual 13.  Still, this is an excellent piece of cinematic work that every fan of this genre should consider a must have. And the way I choose to look at it is, for a long time, we thought we would never see Henriksson as Wallander again... so these last 6 episodes should be considered a bonus:)",1401840000,16,3086,4.4884135472370765
6388337,5,B00JPJC8RK,"I have been waiting for the final six episodes for two years.  I watched Season 2 first, and fell in love.  Then I went back and watched Season 1, which was good, but not as good as Season 2.  It seems like it took forever to finally get Season 3.  I ordered it the day it was available.  All I can say is ""wow.""  I love this show.  I wish that there would be more.  The opening episode is a little slow, but still so good. It reminds us of Wallander's character flaws and how he constantly struggles.  There is a new ""Linda"" to replace his daughter from Series 1. The original Linda tragically died, so as a result, they replaced her, and I did not know how I would feel about the new actress, but she is very good and a good choice. The opening episode takes place quite a bit in Stockholm, so the scenery is fascinating as usual (one of the reasons I enjoy the series so much). In any event, if you are huge Wallander fan, as I am, you must watch.  If you have not seen the series, go back and watch 1 and 2, and then enjoy these final episodes.  Krister, you will be missed.",1401667200,12,1078,4.061611374407583
6388338,1,B00JPJC8RK,"Adored seasons 1 and 2 as the brightest stars by far in the genre firmament. I looked forward to season 3 with as though it was another Beatles or Bob Dylan album coming out in the 1960s--i.e., the best of the best staking out new artistic ground in a fabulously engaging manner.

Yet, to my sad dismay, Season 3 is substantially devoid of depictions of love and other life affirming plot elements, including the sharp humor, brilliant intuition and paternal love and leadership so brilliantly depicted in Seasons 1 & 2.

Perhaps Series 3 amounts to an artistic achievement in depicting the letting go and succumbing  of Wallander as his soul disintegrates. That unrelieved, sad, charmless decline, however, is painfully overdrawn and unremittingly pessimistic, with all  it remorselessness  is in actual life.

The inconceivable has occurred: I disliked viewing this final Season  of the incomparable Wallander.",1401408000,5,912,5.205479452054795
6388339,5,B00JPJC8RK,"I have been waiting since last year to obtain the English subtitled Swedish version of 'Wallander"" and am happy it is finally available for North American viewers.  For me, Swedish actor Krister Henriksson should win multiple awards for his fine, nuanced portrayal of the flawed, likeable protagonist Ystad police detective Kurt Wallander. It's a touching, ""less is more"", very terrific acting performance by Krister Henriksson. In addition, for fans of Jussi, Kurt Wallander's loveable, sidekick labrador retriever named after a 20th century, famous Swedish opera tenor, he's also back! This third (and final) season takes place a few years later than season 2 and Kurt has now redeemed himself with his daughter Linda with whom he had a fractured past; in season 3, he is a doting grandfather with a good father-daughter family and work relationship.  There's romance in store for him, he faces the challenges of aging, and there are criminal cases to solve!  Moreover, I like the season's theme song ""The Opening"" performed by Ane Brun & Fleshquartet; it has a mesmerizing, haunting quality and features thoughtful lyrics.  For serious fans of the original Swedish version of ""Wallander"", I would highly recommend that you purchase this new season made up of five discs containing 6 episodes and some bonus extras, such as an interview with Krister Henriksson about how he got into acting and a documentary about the history of  the ""Wallander"" productions from its novel beginnings, the contribution of actress Johanna Maria Ellinor Berglund-S&auml;llstr&ouml;m (who first portrayed Linda Wallander in season 1 and 2), and the tourism boom that's resulted from the international enjoyment of ""Wallander"" books and televised series.  Even if season 3 is billed as the final season of the gritty crime solving adventures of the savvy Kurt Wallander and his very capable team, super fans would agree that we would not object to twists and turns that suddenly allow season 4 to go into production in the near future! ""Hope springs eternal!""",1401321600,4,2040,5.204268292682927
6388340,2,B00JPJC8RK,"Among my favorite mystery series (Foyle's War, Midsomer Murders, Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries, George Gently), the Wallander series is perhaps the most complex and intriguing. That said, what gives with the price of this set? When iTunes gets up to $4 per episode, I consider it a bit excessive. Here one pays $60 for six 55-minute episodes on four discs! Ten dollars per show? That is more or less the same price as going to see five or six first-run movies at a theater. I cannot justify this purchase.",1401148800,6,506,4.696629213483146
6388341,5,B00JPJC8RK,"Often it happens with great characters in serials - they mature over the course of the story; they are changed by the experiences they go through and they suffer the things we go through as humans. They age. We come to know them as people with foibles and quirks...they're like friends. When a great character is portrayed in film we hope the actor will live up to the picture we see in our mind's eye. For me, Krister Henriksson becomes the character Henning Mankell has created, Kurt Wallander. Other actors have played Wallander but Henriksson inhabits Wallander, and never more so than in this third installment. Kurt Wallander has reached a certain point in his life that is agonizing to watch if you're rooting for him as you would a friend. Without spoiling it if you don't know the story, Krister Henriksson plays Kurt with sensitivity and feistiness. You are moved by the tension between his razor sharp mind and the difficult position he finds himself in. These stories are watchable over and over not only because of the cases Wallander and the team confront, but also because of the beauty of Kurt's dignity. Highly recommended if you enjoy a good plotline and emotional depth to the characters therein.",1401062400,30,1215,4.818181818181818

6388343,5,B00JPJC8RK,"Absolutely love Wallander.  It's a bit pricey, but I enjoyed every minute.  Great acting, great stories, great scenery.  My only complaint for both Season 2 and 3 is with casting and how they end up using female actors as love interest to Wallander who are clearly too young for him.  I'm 99.99% sure there are very lovely Swedish actors in their late 50s early 60s who could be cast in those roles. What the heck?  But this should not put anyone off the purchase, because I don't think you can go wrong with this season if you love this character.  I thought the writers were especially brave to take the story in the direction they did. You won't be disappointed, sad maybe.",1447718400,,676,4.5

6388350,5,B00JPJC8RK,"Kristen Henriksson is one of the finest dramatic actors you will ever see. Although it's sad to see the series end, these episodes are a fitting conclusion to the definitive film version of Wallander. Henriksson's portrayal of Kurt Wallander in these final episodes is a revelation. He owns the role and in this third season he mines the character for all its worth. As in the books, the series ends with Wallander's cascading struggles with Alzheimer's disease. Anyone who has seen a loved one cope with the onset of dementia will see the honesty and sincerity in the denial, frustration, and anger in Henriksson's performance. More than in the previous seasons, Henrisksson shows Wallander's humanity in these episodes, along with all the angst, love, and intellect that Mankell wrote into the character. Kenneth Branagh could learn some things from this man.",1418342400,,861,5.113475177304965

6388353,5,B00JPJC8RK,"There has been a lull in the Wallander filming, and when these last six episodes were finished, I was sad. Tears actually in my eyes. Once you have seen these episodes you will understand.

Wallander is now working with his daughter, Linda, who has married, and has a young daughter, Klara. Klara is the apple of Wallender's eye, and she loves her grandpoppa as well. Wallander and Linda now, side by side investigating cases in Ystad, Sweden. The rest of the team is there, Nyberg and Marrtson. Of the six episodes the first is far more realistic because it was taken from the book, 'The Troubled Man'. The other five well done, but some very obvious endings and some glaringly impossible.

The entire series stays fresh and superb because of Erik Henriksson,who plays Wallender.
Disheveled,even more so, full day's growth of beard, reddish blond hair, most of the time in a mess, but he is a detective with too much to do and too little time. Memory issues are apparent, we can see his mind whirling and his eyes looking vague at times. He has a romance with a nursery school attendant, but it does not seem right. The last two episodes are heartbreaking in a manner, as we know we are saying goodbye to an old friend. Brilliant acting, superb filming, if the storylines were a little off, so be it, we have Wallender at his finest.

This DVD set came with the final 6 episodes comprising Season 3 of Mankell's Wallander - the Swedish version, not the BBC English voice garbage knock-off.

I find the Season 3 plots and the Wallander character outstanding. He's nearing the end of his career, and he is not as ""excellent"" as he once was. I can relate to that. And, the ""decay"" adds to the honesty of his character portrayal.

Yes, Wallander's evincing evidence of problems he isn't handling well at all. He practices denial and deception. But, he still attacks his job.

Krister Henriksson is awesome. Much more empathetic than Kenneth Branagh's ""wooden"" Wallander, in my opinion.",1413072000,2,703,5.149122807017544

Every episode of series 1, 2 and 3 has given us an extra understanding of Kurt and the depth of the relationship he has with the people around him. Now we know as much as we can ever know about him.
The different actress portraying his daughter Linda makes the development of her character seamless: in some shots, especially in the first episode, she even looks the same.
We managed to pace ourselves to one episode per evening, with plenty of deep discussions in between.

6388368,5,B00JPJC8RK,"I'm a big fan of Scandinavian detective shows and particularly, Wallander. The Norwegian Varge Veum and the Swedish detective (Iris?) series are good too. Really enjoyed this entire series and the long awaited last installment does not disappoint. The final episode is spectacular and bittersweet. Series 3 introduced a new Linda, the actress fulfils this role very well given the delicate and sad circumstances surrounding the well regarded prior Linda.

Great acting and plots with lots of twists and turns and the usual snowy Swedish scenery and street scenes as well. I love euro flicks as the focus is on real, imperfect people in realistic surroundings. Absent are the special effects, perfect looks and amazing homes that are typically featured in US films which imo alienates the viewer and is a huge distraction although I appreciate the value of hedonistic escapism.

Spoiler alert. Episode 6 depicts a harsh story of how too often, older people are treated at work; similarly dispensed and forgotten when deemed no longer useful. Even in Sweden. Henriksson does an engaging portrayal of what it must be like to realize you're really losing your mind with the onset of Alzheimer's. Many new faces appear in this season; Jenny was very watchable, Mattson was easy to dislike and it was nice to see the trusty Nyberg make an appearance.

This dvd had trailers of the original episodes starring Rolf Lassgrd which look to be good as well.

Season 3 of the series is true to the writer's inevitable end of Wallendar.  It is very hard to watch as his analytical mind begins to fail him.

I didn't enjoy Wallaner's decline. I have loved this series and
I wanted a Disney happy  ending I know it parallels his family
History story line. Guess I have to ""buck up"" and ""get over it"".
Maybe you could continue the series and add Reincaration.",1404172800,,304,4.333333333333333
6388389,4,B00JPJC8RK,"Excellent.  An absolutely outstanding series.  Season 3 provides the final chapters in the career of Kurt Wallander.  Sometimes sad, always engaging, Kurt, despite the handicaps of increasing age and illness, still wields his uncanny intuition to solve crimes in southern Sweden.  If Krister Henriksson were an American actor, he would be in a class with Robert Deniro and Dustin Hoffman.",1404172800,2,388,5.416666666666667

8652855,5,B00JPJC8RK,"I think foreign films with subtitles are far better than Hollywood glamour!  All the Wallander films are superb compare to Hollywood nonsense, unbelievable stunts and smut.  These films are what story telling is all about.  They wear hardly any makeup, their teeth are not perfect, but the stories are so realistic, which is the way it used to be in America.  Subtitles are easy to read and keep up with the story line.  I like them so very much, I have all the Wallander films.  Krister's character is so seemingly real and I feel sad for him in certain episodes.  He's so quiet, yet a great thinking crime solver.  I can't really describe how good these films are.  See one, you'll want them all!",1516924800,,698,4.564516129032258

8652860,3,B00JPJC8RK,"The Wallender series, I watched on PBS.To my recollection, these versions were obviously dubbed in English. I ordered Season 3,and was disappointed that it had English sub-titles. We lost the flow of the film as we needed to readi the sub-titles, while missing portions of the film and the nuances.
There wasn't any indication by the seller, this DVD, was not in English and contained English sub-titles;which are distracting, unless the DVD is in English and you need CC, for an individual with hearing problems. This was a learning lesson. When purchasing foreign made films on DVD, I will contact seller first to ensure, the version is in English.",1472256000,,650,4.972477064220183

8652863,5,B00JPJC8RK,"I recently finished season 2 and season 3 in a span of 10 days and found myself more connected to the protagonist which was masterfully portrayed by Krister Henriksson than any of the series of the same genre. At least for me, the only reason I follow a murder mystery series is because the set up is extremely , as the Britons put it ""clever"" ,and the murderer and whatever his /her motive are entirely unexpected ( Such as Agatha Christie's ), the acting as well as the story line around the lead detective private life is not, while absolutely makes the series more worth watching, not essential.

However, season 3 completely changed my view. Seeing Wallander's personal struggles against losing memory and the prospects of leading a normal life to me is the highlight of the entire series. The actor  in the end embodies the fictional detective in such a profound way that you would rarely expect from a murder mystery series .As Jeremy Brett's Sherlock Holmes, Krister Henriksson will forever be the one and the only Wallander,",1462838400,,1033,4.76536312849162
