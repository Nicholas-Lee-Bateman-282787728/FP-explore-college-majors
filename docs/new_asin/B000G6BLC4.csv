2600264,5,B000G6BLC4,It's a fantastic children's series. I loved it as a child and I still love it today. Jim Henson was a genius and I hope these videos reach another generation of children and give them the same insight and worldview it gave to me. This series is a masterpiece and truly accomplishes the vision he had for Fraggle Rock which is talked about in the bonus material in the season 1 Fraggle Rock DVD collection.,1163030400,3,405,4.413333333333333
2600265,5,B000G6BLC4,"I've just spent a few days with the contents of this wonderful box and it's almost impossible to quantify the value of what's inside. In Fraggle Rock Season Two, you'll find a creative team growing in strength from a successful first year and learning to let their storytelling really fly. Character relationships within the fraggle five are stretched further as they learn new things about each other's individuality. The complex world of the Doozers is flung wide open and the audience starts to realise how each member of this seemingly uniform group has their own thoughts and feelings. More bridges are build toward harmony between the Fraggle, Doozer, Gorg and Human worlds, whilst some differences still seem impossible to fix.

Rather than rest on their laurels, the fraggle team make sure their own voices are woven further into the tapestry and any viewer of these 24 shows is rewarded with the gift of real humanity, wisdom and the type of laughter that only comes from knowing your best friends inside out.

The icing on the cake is a beautiful tribute to co-creator Jerry Juhl. Just as he made you feel like you knew his written creations personally, his friends and family in new interviews make you feel like you knew him personally too. So many of Jerry's writing practices and human subtleties are revealed here, and it's been a long time since I was so inspired by a single documentary.

Add to the mix illuminating cast reminiscing sessions about the new ground broken in the second season, puppeteer Steve Whitmire's behind the scenes home movies and footage from Uncle Travelling Matt's european adventures, and you have an irresistable time capsule of the show to enjoy yourself and pass onto future generations. The future of the remaining seasons being released does depend on strong early sales of this set, so please don't dawdle over this purchase and help insure that the fraggle legacy is completed and back in the hands of the public once more. We need this in our world.",1158883200,20,2001,4.879411764705883
2600266,5,B000G6BLC4,"I received this DVD set last week, and have been happily enjoying it ever since then.  The video and sound quality of the DVD's is excellent, and the episodes are amazing.  It's been many, many years since I have watched these episodes of Fraggle Rock, so I had forgotten the true depth of the shows during this season.  Season 2 offers extraordinary storylines and character development, and begins building complex relationships between characters from the different races, such as the friendship between Red Fraggle and Cotterpin Doozer.  If you enjoyed the first season of Fraggle Rock, you will be absolutely blown away by the stories in Season 2.",1158105600,4,652,5.0092592592592595
2600267,5,B000G6BLC4,"After the great success of Season One, Fraggle fans are extremely excited that HIT Entertainment is continuing with season box sets of this legendary show.

Like a previous reviewer said, the series really picks up steam and evolves more into the show everyone knows and loves during this second season.

Aside from all 24 fantastic episodes, bonus features will include new interviews with the cast and crew concerning Season Two (a very popular feature from Season One) and a tribute to the late Muppet writer Jerry Juhl (whose untimely passing occured just weeks after the first season was released on DVD in September 2005). The delightful packaging from the first set (a full colored, glossy, embossed ""book-style"" box with turning pages) should also continue for this set.

1. Wembley's Egg

3. The Trash Heap Doesn't Live Here Anymore

Mirkin; writers Sugith Varughese, David Young, Robert Sandler and Susan Juhl; performers Karen Prell, Steve Whitmire, Dave Goelz and Jerry Nelson; creative consultants Duncan Kenworthy and Jocelyn Stevenson; and composer Phillip Balsam.

You get what you'd expect from any TV season on DVD. All the episodes and a few extras. The focus is on the episodes though.

2600300,5,B000G6BLC4,"Growing up in Toronto Canada, I remember watching Fraggle Rock on CBC when I was just a kid.  Some kids shows you enjoy as a kid but when you grow up you look back and ask ""why did I watch this?"" but this isn't the case.  Fraggle Rock, like many Jim Henson Productions is both entertaining for young children but has enough humour and intelligence to appeal to an adult audience.  It also delivers great morals and lessons which unlike some other children's shows don't come across as (what TV tropes calls:  Anvilicious, morals and lessons so unsubtle you might as well engrave the message into an anvil and drop it on the viewer's head).

The special features are really good too.  I like the feature talking about the different ""Doc and Sprocket"" segments filmed for different countries.  It's an interesting look at how an international co-production works, especially in today's age where everyone seems to want the ""original version"" and is quick to scream, ""It's been re-edited/dubbed!  They've ruined it!"".  I also loved the ""All around the world"" music video for Travelling Matt, so much I put it on my itunes.",1367712000,,1119,4.786458333333333

2600302,5,B000G6BLC4,"This series is a wonderful blend of fantasy and reality, with Jim Henson's marvelous puppets gently mimicking and poking fun at reality while addressing personal issues we all face, from belonging to sadness to life purpose.  A Fraggle Rock episode is equivalent to a great bedtime story, and will leave you feeling better about life in general.  Recommended for kids from 4 to 95.",1361664000,,381,4.9375

After comparing the reviews on Amazon, we decided not to order the complete DVD set and instead purchased each season separately.  I read there were complaints by other customers with packaging and missing/differing content on the ""complete"" set.  I did not have any of these issues when the packages arrived.  The DVD's were in great condition with no signs of scratching or wear.  The content of the videos was what we expected.  Great show for kids.

In this case-- it isn't just that.  Saving set the ground rules for the series, Jerry Juhl and the other writers then set out to break a few of them.  The Gorgs no longer appear in almost every episode.  They're still around but they are a lot more episodes with entirely internal conflicts- either amongst where character or the Fraggle Community.  Second- there are episodes without Gobo or Uncle Matt.  Thirdly- at least from my perspective- there are a lot more episodes that focus on Boober.",1306022400,,669,4.756521739130434

2600325,5,B000G6BLC4,"Growing up Fraggle Rock was a show that my entire family crammed onto the sofa to see.  Since then we have scoured eBay and Garage sales for copies of the episodes to watch ourselves and share with friends.  The advent of the First Season's release (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fraggle-Rock-Complete-First-Season/dp/B0009RQSSW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fraggle Rock - Complete First Season</a>) was definitely a cause for celebration in our extended households, and watching the series as an adult I see so many things I missed as a child.

While some of the songs are not quite as musically ""phenomenal"" as I remember, for the most part the show is highly enjoyable for children and adults alike.  The characters are engaging, loyal, loving, imperfect, and always have a story to tell and a lesson to learn.  I would recommend these TV shows to any families; though exceptionally small children (0-3) may be mildly frightened by the Fraggles initially, since they are unlike anything on TV today.  In my opinion the show is *very* family friendly.  The Fraggles are in no way specifically religious or Christian, but are also not anti-religion or God, something I am a stickler on when deciding on ""family friendliness"".

Whether you have never seen the Fraggles, or are a long time friend, I recommend the DVD sets!  Enjoy!",1183852800,,1368,5.355140186915888

2600333,5,B000G6BLC4,"Watching this series of classic Fraggle Rock episodes made me realize the genius behind the Henson machine.  Who else can talk to kids about complex social issues in such a clear cut manner without dumbing things down?  No one.  The Muppet Master is truly missed in this cynical day and age.

Excellent viewing for the whole family.  Jim Henson's Muppets at their finest.",1167782400,,371,4.825396825396825
2600334,4,B000G6BLC4,"If you are a parent or grew up in the 80's this is a wonderful tv show that was fun and also taught life lessons.  Didn't really do much in the sense of education, but it did teach how to share, treat other's with respect and how to have friends.",1167782400,,246,3.92

2600336,5,B000G6BLC4,"Anyone who remembers watching this show will agree that this was a quality and entertaining program. Wonderful morals and topics. Dealt with issues we all come across in our daily life. Great stories, songs and puppetry. I believe my two daughters have grown up to be better adults because of watching Jim Henson's Fraggle Rock when they were growing up. Everyone should have these DVD set in their library.",1163116800,3,407,4.913043478260869

2600339,5,B000G6BLC4,"Fraggle Rock is the greatest and this collection arrived in good condition and on time. This collection is fun for the whole family . . . a delightful blast from the past for the adults, and new and exciting for the kids. Surely the special effects are not on par with what you would find today, however the enjoyable content and songs make up for that manyfold. I wish Jim Henson were still around to enjoy the newfound popularity with his older works. My thanks goes out to anyone who was affiliated with the production and creation of this funny, touching and endearing series. I haven't actually seen this second season collection yet because it is going to be a Christmas gift for our family, but after buying and enjoying the first season, I am looking forward to more fraggles!",1163030400,3,784,4.607142857142857

The last pair of shoes I ordered from Amazon were fine, but these are pretty rough for new shoes.

I guess I have to go through the hassle of returning them and reordering -- very inconvenient.",1476144000,,449,4.321428571428571

While it doesn't teach counting or numbers it does focus on the fact that while we look at how life is in our world there are others out there who have different perspectives. This show encourages the increase in ones EQ and the understanding that not everyone is the same but when it comes down to it, we are all worthy.. It is one of the very few tv shows I let my child watch.",1461801600,,497,4.242105263157895
