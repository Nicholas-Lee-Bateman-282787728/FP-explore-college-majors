when it says 'functional fitness, brain power', i expected that it was mental exercises for the brain, and i was excited with that prospect.

when i first put in the dvd i saw what i considered a 'cheesecake pose'.  it was cheesy, cheap, and amateur, with suzanne andrews wanting us to see her breast size rather than wanting us to improve our brains. this is followed by a 'morphed' image with what was apparently suzanne andrews 'in the old days' and then her after exercise.  this intro seemed like someone created it who was just learning video-making, certainly not someone professional.  this intro contributed nothing to the exercise video and should have been edited out. i actually took the dvd out in disgust.

a few days later i thought, 'well, i have to give it a fair chance', so i went through the whole thing.

calling the poorly made exercise video 'brain power' is just a gimmick of marketing.  i can get many better made exercise videos and have them work just as well for my brain since any physical exercise which gets my heart pumping, helps the brain.

in the introduction, suzanne andrews is giving us a 'pep talk'.  it appears that she has practiced this many times with a producer saying 'you've got to be more lively and enthusiastic':  so, she gives us lively and enthusiastic.  it doesn't ring true, it is just someone *trying to be* lively and enthusiastic.

the exercises are fine. i would rather take a walk. the whole thing kind of gave me the creeps.",1316476800,,1540,4.613970588235294
8344647,5,B001UPO26C,"Hi there everyone.  I am the host of Functional Fitness on PBS TV and produced Brain Power for those of you who have a loved one who may be more forgetful lately. That loved one may even be you. As an Occupational Therapy Practitioner, I was fortunate enough to have specialized training in patients with dimentia and witnessed the big difference these medically researched based exercises in Brain Power make to really increase cognitive funcioning. You don't have to have dimentia or alzheimers to benefit from this DVD as you can use it as a preventative measure. Prevention is the best medicine!
Healthiest Blessings,
Suzanne Andrews",1243209600,3,637,5.009433962264151
