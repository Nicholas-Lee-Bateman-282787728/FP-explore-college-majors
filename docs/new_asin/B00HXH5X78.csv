8637189,5,B00HXH5X78,"This is one of those old movies that is wonderful to watch as an artifact of the time in which it was made (heading into WWII) , for the general interest of its subject matter (Disraeli and the period leading up to the Congress of Berlin), and great performances of the actors.  Gielgud's take on Disraeli is well worth the price of admission by itself.  Great fun.",1409097600,4,365,4.432835820895522
