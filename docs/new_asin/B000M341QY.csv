2719469,1,B000M341QY,"Unbelievably bad on so many levels, but the main blame should fall on the director, who did such an incompetent job, it was excrutiating to watch.
It was also poorly cast -- the two main 'nerds' didn't come off as nerds at all, but normal actors dressed up to try and make them look like nerds.  The acting, if one could call it that, was atrocious all around.  Also, there were five writers on this film. FIVE. One would think with that many writers, there would be at least five laugh out loud moments, but no.  Not even a chuckle.

It's worth noting that with the exception of Ted McGinley, the rest of the stars who actually went on to bigger and better things, refused to take part in the 'extra' documentary, no doubt due to extreme embarrassment.  Even those who showed up talked about it with a glaring tone of embarrassment.

I hadn't seen this film in 30+ years, and it sure didn't hold up well at all.  Even if it weren't so horribly dated, it was so bad it's unlikely it would've even been produced today -- even for the direct to DVD market.  Just painful all around.",1505779200,,1080,4.365

2719556,5,B000M341QY,"The birth of the nerd, the rise and revenge against the socially worshipped jock, times certainly have changed. Now it is the nerds, the ""Mark Zuckerberg"" types who are worshipped around college campuses. Back in a time where movies like this started to blow up, of course lit by the fire that Animal House started, we saw some great (if not clich&eacute;d) college comedies, Real Genius, Back to School etc.

Something about the ""Snobs vs Slobs"" trope makes us helplessly root for the underdog every time, the caddies, the outcasts, the nerds. While this movie does spend a bit too much time at the end trying to preach, it delivers a hilariously good time with a perfectly dated 1980's setting and soundtrack, an early look at John Goodman and what ended up being Robert Carradine's most iconic role (he would go on to star in 3 less successful sequels).

Grab a couple buds, a couple brews and throw on Revenge of the Nerds for some old school 80's comedy fun.",1467763200,3,963,4.658823529411765

2719681,4,B000M341QY,"In 1984's ""Revenge of the Nerds"" a group of social outcasts at Adams College are persecuted by fraternities of jocks and popular girls. To defend themselves they form their own fraternity and use their brains to outwit their enemies.

""Revenge"" is over three decades old now and has formulated a decent reputation, as far as school/college comedies go. The film works because it's amusing enough and -- despite the youthful inanities and occasional raunch -- the viewer starts to care about the outcasts and their cause; we celebrate when they have a victory over the pompous crowd. There's some nudity so stay away if that turns you off.

The film runs 90 minutes and was shot in Tucson, Arizona.

2719704,1,B000M341QY,"I enjoyed this when I saw it back in the mid-80s as a young teenager.  It was crassly funny.  However, seeing this in 2014 with critical thinking lens, I consider it highly misogynistic.  For one thing, the characters brand of ""revenge"" for being humiliated is to...sexually humiliate.  Whether it is breaking into a female sorority, or illegally filming the ladies nude against their will, or ogling them on film between beer swigs;  this - like a number of other 80s films - states the message:  Combat bullying by being a bully yourself.  And a sexual bully is no less of a bully.  It is not too surprising, then, to see that eventually in the movie; the nerd hero wins out by raping the sorority queen, which in turn makes her fall in love with him.  He does this by impersonating her boyfriend, and when she finds out it is the nerd, she doesn't mind because of the high quality of his sexual performance, and so the message becomes ""if you rape someone, make sure you do it nice and hard, that way you'll get a free pass.""  Being bullied for being a ""nerd"" or for any other reason is oppressive.  However, the answer to being oppressed is not to oppress back, particularly not as a sexual bully.  This one belongs in the ashcan of history.",1418601600,4,1245,4.484444444444445

2719754,5,B000M341QY,"One of the greatest cult classics of all time, the studios didn't know what to do with it. Small early releases resulted in an amazing rash of critical acclaim, and a wider release and an unusual money maker for the studio. What does that tell you? It tells me that the studios don't really know what the hell the public wants. I like this film a lot, and nerds like myself aren't afraid to laugh at ourselves.

It's a sweet film, hilarious and sensitive at the same time. The Blu transfer doesn't really make a huge difference, but it's still a film I will watch again, often, for the feel-good sensation. Great cast, dedicated to the premise that nothing is more fun than little guys beating up the hierarchy (in this case, the jocks). We all know people like this.

2719810,5,B000M341QY,"The deluxe edition of the 1984 college comedy REVENGE OF THE NERDS comes equipped with a variety of special features that the film's cult fans will find essential.

First, a running audio commentary by director Jeff Kanew and actors Robert Carradine, Timothy Busfield and Curtis Armstrong proves a delight: warm and silly memories by some very likeable, middle-age guys about working, scene-by-scene, on a goofy, Animal House-like movie in their younger years.

The same four individuals, and others from the cast such as Ted McGinley (who played the villainous hunk Stan Gable), Julia Montgomery (Stans girlfriend, Betty Childs), and Andrew Cassese (Wormser), reminisce in the featurette documentary ""Im a Nerd and Im Pretty Proud of It"" about how they landed their respective jobs on the film (seems like everyone read for Carradines part) and how wild and crazy the actual shoot was in Tucson. What strikes one is how positive all those memories are. Even though some careers haven't exactly skyrocketed in the years since Revenge took off, the experience seems to have been very good for everyone at the time.

Also included in the special features section is the original, Orson Welles-narrated theatrical trailer; a trailer for Revenge of the Nerds II: Nerds In Paradise; and such deleted scenes as a romantic interlude between Gilbert (Anthony Edwards) and girlfriend Judy (Michelle Meyrink), and another starring Michael Lerner as Gilberts racist uncle. A real rarity: the pilot for a truly forgettable television version of REVENGE OF THE NERDS.

In this hilarious satire on college life, a group of misfits led by Lewis(Robert Carradine) and Gilbert(Anthony Edwards) decides to start their own fraternity after being rejected by every house on campus. Chaos results, with a brains vs. brawn battle.",1387497600,,1808,5.267361111111111

2719881,4,B000M341QY,"When this was in the theaters, several of my friends (nerds and nerdettes) suggested I should see it. But that was during the period of time when if nobody else was paying for it, I did not go to movies. So I added it to the list in the back of my head to see ""someday.""

Someday was today. This is a very funny, very satisfying movie.

The basic setup is jocks versus nerds, with the jocks being pushy and obnoxious, and the nerds being their victims for awhile. The jock fraternity was Alpha Beta (can't help thinking of a supermarket), and when their party at the beginning of the school year got a little too rowdy, they burned their house down. So the coach decides that he's going to bully the dean into giving them the freshman dorm (all male in those days), and the freshmen have to sleep on cots in the gym. But the fraternities make an exception and admit freshman, and soon only the ones the frat boys don't want are left in the gym. Among them are Lewis and Gilbert, who have built a robot and generally do very nerdie sorts of things.

They make an organized effort (pretty funny in itself) and eventually find a terribly run-down old house they can rent. They put a lot of effort into fixing it up, but when they have a complaint about the ABs, and go to the Greek Council about it, they are told that in order to have a voice at the Greek Council, they must form their own fraternity and they must have the sponsorship of a national fraternity. Eventually, after a discouraging search, they are given a chance by Lambda Lambda Lambda (Tri-Lambs), a basically black fraternity that does not yet have a house on their campus.

They throw a party to impress the head of the LLL, a rather stern black man named U.N. Jefferson, who seems unenthusiastic about admitting all these nerdie white boys to their fraternity. They do have one black member, but he's gay, so Jefferson is not impressed.

However, these boys have resources other frats don't, and I'm not going to spoil it by telling you how they make a great party of it, or how, when the ABs and their sister sorority continue to harass them, they finally get their real revenge.

You'll be cheering for them as much for their grit as for their imagination. And in the meantime, you'll be laughing yourself half sick.",1336953600,3,2285,4.441527446300716

Still, overall, this episode is good but not the original.",1326672000,3,379,4.236111111111111
2719903,5,B000M341QY,If you like a reminder of the 80's then this is the movie. Although cheezy and a bit risque - it is funny and that is the whole point. Fun and uplifting when the nerds win the day!,1321228800,,180,3.763157894736842
2719904,5,B000M341QY,"There were lots of movies from the 1980s that were oriented toward the younger male audience, some of them just okay (""Bachelor Party""), some of them awful (""Porkies""), and some of them great.
This fits into the latter category.
As anyone could guess without having seen it already, this is a story about how some of the ""uncool"" people on a college campus get back at all the ""beautiful people"" and triumph in the end.
The two main characters are Lewis (played by Robert Carradine) and Gilbert (played by Anthony Edwards, yes, THAT Anthony Edwards), two dorky kids just starting their freshman year at Adams College.
Once they arrive, they quickly learn that the jocks and cheerleaders aren't going to make their stay there anything but miserable, including a loud, jeering ""NERDS!"" from the muscle man of the jocks, ""Ogre"" (played by Donald Gibb).
The core actors of the movie are coke bottle glasses wearing Poindexter (Tim Busfield), flamboyantly gay Lamar (Larry B. Scott), elementary school aged Wormser (Andrew Cassese), Japanese Takashi (Brian Tochi), and ultra-slob Booger (Curtis Armstrong).
Insult after insult rains down on the nerds, until they decide to try and work within the system, seeking to start their own fraternity, but finding that the ""beautiful people"" in charge of the Greek Council reject them out of hand without a national sponsor.
The nerds then go on a search for a national sponsor, getting rejected by all but the one to which they forget to include a group photo in their application, that fraternity being Lambda Lambda Lambda.
They are accepted on a sixty day probationary status with the sponsor, contingent on satisfying the sponsor after that period.
Along the way, the nerds are faced with no choice but to retaliate, and retaliate HARD, against the jocks and cheerleaders.
I won't give away any more, since I don't like people spoiling good movies for others, but let me just say that my favorite scene is near the very end, when several NON-NERD members of Lambda Lambda Lambda show up to back up their nerd brothers.
The funny thing about this movie is that, yes, it's got lots of gross and sexual jokes, but not quite as excessive as in lots of movies of today, yet at the center of the story is a surprisingly worthwhile message about treating people who are different well.
It's hilarious, sometimes sophomoric, but in the end, it's just a great movie.
You get lots of nice extras with the movie, including a commentary track from director Jeff Kanew and actors Tim Busfield, Robert Carradine, and Curtis Armstrong.
You also get a nice featurette, ""I'm A Nerd, And I'm Pretty Proud Of It,"" that runs just over forty minutes.
You also get several deleted scenes, some of which are amusing, but watching them convinced me that the editors made the right choice by leaving them on the cutting room floor.
You also get the (sorry, but very forgettable) TV pilot for ""Revenge Of The Nerds.""
Lastly, you get the trailers for both ""ROTN"" and ""ROTN II (Nerds In Paradise).""
One word of caution for those of you with youngsters is that there is some strong language (occasional f-bombs, s-word, etc.) along with some sexual references.
More importantly, there is also some brief full frontal (both up and down) nudity, so approach with caution.",1310947200,,3282,4.872987477638641

2719909,4,B000M341QY,"Last night is quite possibly the first time I actually watched Revenge of the Nerds.  Why did I not watch it back in the 80's when I had the perfect opportunity?  Well... I don't know, haha.

This is probably considered a crude style of humor.  It's hilarious for the most part, but it's not for everyone.  Lots of nudity and cussing, and other offensive scenes that might not appeal to everyone.  I'm a bit shocked because I was under the impression this was more of a comedy film for kids mainly- how wrong I was.

Anyway, the reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because some of the writing is really sloppy, and not in an appealing kind of way either.  Much of the movie focuses on a gigantic party scene with lots of typical college humor which results in a lot of pointless nonsense filler.  In my opinion, the storyline SHOULD focus more on the actual nerds getting picked on.

I think that's the most disappointing thing- I went in expecting lots of bullying and the nerds planning a really huge and fantastic comeback after several days of constantly being picked on, but that's not really what happens at all.  Instead, the story is about a group of nerds becoming determined to be like the cool guys by spying on naked girls, getting drunk, and dancing to all the hit albums.

By the way, it's amazing watching this back when the Talking Heads were popular and Michael Jackson's solo career was taking off.  Ah, I remember those days.  Music was so good back then.  What happened?

Revenge of the Nerds has its share of spotty and pointless moments, but it's still a pretty fun movie regardless of that.",1279152000,,1613,4.510344827586207

2719924,3,B000M341QY,"The Bottom Line:

Another one of those ""comedy classics"" that's not actually a very funny or good movie, Revenge of the Nerds has occasional funny moments but it neither warrants its reputation as a memorable film nor your time and money; unless you're the type of person who finds the Police Academy series to be the zenith of modern comedy then stay away from this film.

One the first day, they are picked on and eventually forced all the nerds to live in the gym. They finally find a messy house and fix it up so they can live in it, but the Alpha Betas and Pi Delta Pis still do awful things to them, so the nerds try to take a stand a fight back!

Although these days the thin line between a 'nerd' and a 'tech head' is thining, this movie captures the stereotypes held in the 70's, 80's and 90's that most 'non nerds' felt at the time.

The highlight of the film is the payback time against those who gave a hard time to the nerds. The nerds sneak into the locker room, apply some sort of irritant substance to the jockstraps, and wait for the unsuspecting football players to put them on. Out in the field, the jocks suffer total humiliation: They itch, jump around, and engage in bizarre dances in their attempts to relieve the irritation.

2719932,3,B000M341QY,"Overall, the panty raid edition dvd is pretty good.  There are still a few gripes that I have with this dvd.  First off, the cover art is horrible! I would be ashamed to walk in my local Walmart and buy this product just for the cover art alone. I guess that's why I ordered it online to save the embarrassment.  Why don't they keep the original art work on these dvd's?  Upgraded features, downgraded cover art.  Secondly, this is my biggest gripe.  Has anyone noticed how the past couple of releases of this movie have cut the scene of the nerds walking up the street to the house that Lewis discovered with the ""for rent"" sign in his hand right before they fix it up?  I have seen this scene cut when it has been aired on HBO as well. Also, why in the world they put the t.v. pilot on this dvd, i'll never know.  It was awful! I wanted my 30 minutes back.  There were a few faces I recognized in it, like Sean Kanan from the Karate Kid 3.  Lastly, the deleted scenes were terrible too.  I can see why they cut them out.  They also did not include all of the deleted scenes though, because if you watch the trailer, you will notice some other scenes that weren't in the movie or the deleted scenes section.  The great things about this dvd are the documentary which was great and the commentary.",1178409600,9,1297,4.244897959183674
2719973,5,B000M341QY,"Once in a while, a film comes along which will be remembered for a long time after its original release.  ""Revenge of the Nerds"" is one such film, and this great DVD edition has finally done this great comedy justice.

Starring Robert Carradine, Anthony Edwards, Timothy Busfield, and a host of other fine actors, the viewer gets a first-hand look at college fraternity life.

Carradine stars as Lewis.  Along with his friend Gilbert (Edwards), the two head off to the mythical Adams College to begin their careers in computer science.  Upon arriving at campus, Lewis and Gilbert are ridiculed by the Alpha Betas, who are led by Stan Gable (Ted McGinley) and ""Ogre"" (Donald Gibb).  They call Gilbert and Lewis nerds, and the label sticks with them.  To make matters worse for Lewis and Gilbert, they are forced to move out of their dorm to make way for the Alpha Betas because they burned their own house down.  The nerds are forced to live in the college gym.  While in the gym, Lewis and Gilbert make some new friends, including Poindexter (Tim Busfield), ""Booger"" (Curtis Armstrong), Takashi (Brian Tochi), Wormser (Andrew Cassese), and Lamar (Larry B. Scott).

After failing to get accepted into any of the existing fraternities, the nerds decide to try to form their own, but Stan Gable vetoes their plans at the Greek Council.  In order to be a recognized fraternity, they must have a national sponsor.  So, the  guys begin searching for one and they finally come across Lambda Lambda Lambda, who agrees to take them on a trial basis.

After the Betas and the Pis sabotage the tri-lambs' party, the tri-lambs vow revenge.  A panty raid is planned for the pi house, while the jocks get a little something extra in their jocks.  The news comes through that the nerds have been fully accepted as a tri-lamb chapter, which infuriates the Alpha Betas even more, and Stan will still not recognize the tri-lamb chapter.  The nerds finally realize that the only way for them to get a fair shake is to win the homecoming carnival, so they could take over the presidency of the Greek council.  With a strong showing in all three areas of the carnival, the tri-lambs succeed at winning, and are poised to take over the Greek Council, but at what cost?  What will the Alpha Betas do now that they've lost control?  Even Stan's girlfriend Betty Childs (Julie Montgomery) has left him for Lewis.

I've seen this movie many times, and it gets better with each viewing.  Each scene in the movie is a classic, especially the panty raid on the pi's sorority house.  The liquid heat scene is funny, too.  The whole movie is loaded with scenes that will keep the viewer laughing throughout.

What makes this great DVD so special is the special features.  There are several scenes which were deleted from the original movie, as well as a half-hour long segment in which the cast and crew talks about their experiences during the making of the movie, and how the movie became such a cult classic.

I give this DVD my highest recommendation.  This movie was good before, but its gotten even better with the added features of this disc.  If you were a fan of ""Nerds"" before, you'll be an even bigger fan after watching this great disc.",1176422400,3,3217,4.684491978609626
2719974,5,B000M341QY,"Two nerdy bestfriends Gilbert (Anthony Edwards) and Lewis (Robert Carridine) have just attended the university of Adams, the campus's jocks especially Ogre (Donald Gibb), Coach Harris (John Goodman), Stan Gable (Ted McGinley) and Burke (Matt Salinger) become hard on them treating them like outcasts. So Lewis and Gilbert with a group of other nerds (Timothy Busfield, Brian Tochi,  Andrew Cassese. Curtis Armstrong, and Larry B. Scott) try to fit in with other fraternities on campus but get rejected until they decide to make their own fraternity to start a war with the jock infested Alpha Beta so they can prove that brains can win over brawn.

Hilarious comedy hit that gained a cult following since it's release, this is truly one of the 80's best comedies and rightfully so. The film is one of John Goodman's earliest roles before he was on ""Rosanne"", the movie also launched some cheap imitators and it's right up there with ""Animal House"" as the second best frat comedy ever! if you like a feel good comedy that is guaranteed to also make you laugh, then check out this one.

The special edition DVD has great remastered picture and sound with cool extras like audio commentary, ""I'm a Nerd and pretty proud of it"" featurette, a rare TV pilot for a ""Revenge of the Nerds"" TV show, deleted scenes, and the expected theatrical trailer.

Also recommended: ""Animal House"", ""Porky's"", ""American Pie Trilogy"", ""Tommy Boy"", ""Dumb and Dumber"", ""Black Sheep"", ""There's Something about Mary"", ""Office Space"" and ""Back to School"".",1175212800,3,1528,5.003937007874016
2719975,4,B000M341QY,"Regardless of how many times I have seen this movie, I always look forward to certain parts, and I am unable to resist seeing it just one more time.  I could never categorize this movie as great, or even a classic; it is just an enjoyable comedy.

As the title suggests, this movie is about a group of hyper-stereotypical nerds.  Leading the pack are Robert Carradine and Anthony Edwards.  In addition are a number of other strong supporting characters, including an alternative lifestyle African-American, an Asian, a pint-sized genius, a classic coke-bottle-glasses geek, and a character aptly named ""Booger.""  Each character is a caricature, and yet they have their basis in reality as I can attest.

This movie focuses on a band of college students frustrated with their inability to be recognized in a school where the football team seems to always have the best of everything.  In the real world, Nerds are rarely members of cliques or jocks.  You may almost guarantee that they do not hang out with the cool people.  The end result is that Nerds almost always make sacrifices.  However, the group of Nerds in this movie refuses to be continually kicked around.

After suffering multiple insults, the Tri-Lam's (Lambda-Lambda-Lambda) and the Omega-Mu's combine forces to attempt to take over the presidency of the Greek Council.  The contest between the Tri-Lam's and Omega-Mu's against the jock/cheerleader team of the Alpha-Beta's and Pi-Delta-Pi's yields multiple funny moments, and a surprise or two meant for the over-18 crowd.  One high point of this movie is the musical number by the Tri-Lam's and Omega-Mu's and another is the end of the movie when the Nerds finally make their point.

This movie is certainly over-the-top, but it does point out that nerds, geeks, or whatever they are called seem to be overlooked in college (and certainly in high school).  However, a subtle message in this movie is appropriately captured in a joke that has been making the rounds.  What do you call a nerd ten years after graduation?  Answer:  Boss.  If you have ever considered yourself put upon by anyone for whatever reason, or if you ever felt you were an outsider in high school or college, you'll find this movie full of some funny moments and you will definitely enjoy the ending.",1096243200,25,2289,4.929503916449086

2719978,5,B000M341QY,"It may not have had a lot of critical or box office success, but Revenge of the Nerds is a classic! It's about the guys the jocks around the world love to torment - nerds. In this movie, the jocks in the Alpha Betas rule Atoms college by way of the Greek council and make the nerds lives hell.  But, the nerds use their brains (along with some juvenille pranks) to get back at the Alpha Betas, win the Greek games and take control of the council. At the end, some of the jocks realize they are not so different from the nerds and feel left out at times as well.

The characters are stereotypical college students - the popular quarterback, his cheerleader girlfriend, the party animal and tons of geeks - but you know them that's what makes it so funny.

From the beginning to the last scene where the nerds finally get their revenge (along with the rival Fraternity they help found  Lambda Lambda Lambda), this is a movie that has bawdy humor that is guilty fun, as well as beautiful babes that you cant help but take a nice look at when they are in the buff.
