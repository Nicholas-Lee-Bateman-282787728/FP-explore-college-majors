8307368,5,B001GXMU6W,"I got this set of DVDs after reading Andrei's book, it is kind of pricey, but the value of information is great. As a yoga practitioner for 30 years and instructor for 20, I found this set amazingly informative on many subjects, what usually you have to study with serious teacher for years, like rasas, coshas, correct asana sequencing, etc. Very detailed explanations, demonstrations making understanding of those subjects easy. I can recommend those videos to any serious yoga practitioner, instructor or yoga teacher, together with the rest of Andrei's videos and book to elevate your practice on a new, higher quality level.",1403481600,2,629,5.116504854368932
