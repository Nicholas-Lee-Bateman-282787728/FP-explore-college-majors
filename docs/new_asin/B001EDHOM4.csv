8297882,2,B001EDHOM4,"Too slow of a practice for me. I personally like a more challenging flow. I did purchase this when I was beginning, but I couldn't really focus on the practice since I didn't know all the poses and I couldn't hear the woman, even with the volume up. Not the video for me.",1427241600,,271,4.132075471698113
8297883,5,B001EDHOM4,"I'm so glad I stumbled across this on a fitness site.  Yasmin is Canadian and doesn't have Gaiam behind her, the company that's made a star out of Rodney Yee and others.  I hope Gaiam picks Yasmin up so that she draws a bigger audience in the U.S.

This is a really nice one hour practice.  It also includes an additional 15 minute core section, a 10 minute meditation, and a 10 minute guided relaxation.  There's also a 20 minute segment pushing a vegetarian product.

Instructor:  The instructor is really good.  Her voice is soothing, and her instruction is very good.  It's done in a voice over, which I like, and her words and movements match.

Level:  I wouldn't say this for a  brand new yoga beginner, but beginners with a familiarity of yoga would be fine. The most advanced poses/asanas are dancer and wheel (backbend).

Music:  The music is beautiful without being too loud or too soft. Music is very important to me and can really make or break a yoga DVD for me.

Set:  The set is soothing and simple, with it being set inside on hardwood floors and soft light.  They have two screens with black and white yoga imagery flowing during instruction.

Language:  For those who speak French, know that you have the option to listen/watch in French or English.

Bonus:  There's a separate 60-minute CD with music and instruction that I listened to briefly. Really nice music. Clear instruction.

I don't know how often I'd do this DVD, but it's a nice choice when you're worn out but know you need to do something.  I'm definitely going to look at her other DVDs.",1370390400,2,1570,4.568345323741007
8297884,5,B001EDHOM4,"This is a vinyasa practice, I'd classify it as intermediate although the instructor does tell and sometimes show modifications for beginner students and more advanced.  It's beautifully filmed, the music is good (not invasive at all), and she has a soothing voice.  The only caution is you do not stay in savanasana very long, but one can easily just stay themselves which is what I did ;)",1317081600,2,389,4.791044776119403
