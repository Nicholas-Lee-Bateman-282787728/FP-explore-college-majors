2289216,5,B0009G3BEM,I thought Eddie Griffin played a wonderful role in this film. I am use to seeing him in mainly comedies but he stepped out of his norm and did a action comedy. He did not over play nor under play his role. It held my attention the entire movie and my family and I all enjoyed it. I look forward to seeing more roles played by Griffin.,1172966400,,334,4.0
2289217,2,B0009G3BEM,"The movie is quite mediocre, but not as bad as you may think.  The casting of Eddie Griffin as a tough action guy is ridiculous, to say the least.  But the reason I bought this dvd is because Nadine Velazquez is so hot!  She plays a villain, is incredibly flexible and does some great martial arts kicks.  I hope she will be in other movies as the baddie, but in a much bigger, sexier, and action packed role.  It's worth getting this movie if you love beautiful latino women, even though you don't see enough of her in the film.",1146009600,3,529,4.25
2289218,3,B0009G3BEM,"This straight to DVD action movie is as derivative as can be, but it's still entertaining enough to pass ninety minutes.  BLAST follows a tug boat captain (Eddie Griffin trying hard to be Wesley Snipes) who is tugging an oil rig on the California coast, much to the chagrin of environmentalists.  A group of these do gooders take over the oil rig and have something else up their sleeves, of course.  Vinnie Jones sneers and leers as Michael Kitteridge, the head of this well organized group, with lovely Nadine Valesquez as his head honchette.  Breckin Meyer is on board as a federal agent working undercover, and Vivica A. Fox is the sexy FBI agent trying to work out the hostage situation.  Director Anthony Hickox keeps the action moving and Griffin and Meyer have a good comic rapport.  Nothing new, but okay for a diversion.",1136592000,,830,4.729166666666667
2289219,2,B0009G3BEM,"This movie is so substandard! Lukewarm plot that is so  formula...I went to the bathroom, came back, and STILL didn't miss anything!

The acting is so wooden, you could tell the editor used the slateboard and `cut!' signals as edit points.

The ONLY redeeming factor is Eddie Griffin. His lines suck as much as Schwartzenegger one-liners, but the man did the best he had to work with.

So here's the plot....retired black firefighter (an ex-fireman with combat skills? Puhlease!) has custody of dead white partner's son (what? there was no family for this poor kid!!!). Terrorists disguised as Earthfirsters take over oil rig. Eddie saves the day.

Everything in between has been done over and over.

Leave this poor skunk on the shelf. Don't even rent it. Wait for it to come on cable so you can fall asleep using the sleep control on the tv.",1126396800,,843,4.739726027397261
2289220,4,B0009G3BEM,"Eddie Griffin (Lamont) played the action hero brilliantly without even losing his humour. He'll have u laughing silly with his jokes & I was surprised to see the stunts that he pulled off along with his sidecick Breckin Meyer (undercover hacker). My only letdown was Vivica Fox's role. She wasn't bad for an FBI agent, but the FBI presence had almost no purpose to the film, I'd rather she her going to oil rig herself.

For a low-budget movie, I'd say ""Blast"" was pretty well done. The storyline (though creatively laced with enough unexpected scenarios to keep u guessing what's happening next) had a few holes left to be desired. Watch this only when u have spare time. It's a good action thriller to watch. Oh! Look out for Shaggy (reggae recording artist)...not bad for a movie debut.",1123977600,4,789,4.717391304347826
2289221,3,B0009G3BEM,"First of all, Eddie Griffin does well as an action hero, if you have not heard of him before, but otherwise you wonder why the switch?  Second, the movie is obviously low budget, because you can see the ""green screen"" effects from a mile away (saves money).  Finally, it had some good action scenes with a lot of ""cheese"" thrown in for good measure.  I rate this movie a 3, but I do recommend it if you are looking to rent a basic action movie.",1122076800,,444,4.2
2289222,3,B0009G3BEM,"this movie was hilarious from beginning to end. this was obviously a low budget movie but it really didn't occur to me until this scene with a crane pushing a helicopter off the side of the oil rig did i realize how low budget it was. not to mention the close ups on eddie griffens face whenever it is supposed to dramatize the situation. this was close as it could get to undercover brother with those close ups as possible without making direct references to that movie.

i hope the actors in this movie didn't take it seriously and it was just one of those movies that was made as payback for something in the past. overall, i don't know who to recommend this to because it was quite obviously unintentionally funny for an action movie.",1121731200,,739,4.4338235294117645
8060141,5,B0009G3BEM,I enjoyed watching Eddie Griffin in an action movie. The movie was outstanding.,1441584000,,79,5.153846153846154
8060142,2,B0009G3BEM,Didn't like it that much. It has no moral to it.,1413244800,,48,3.4545454545454546
8060143,5,B0009G3BEM,Another great action movie for me. I am glad I found it. Especially glad you had it. Thank You Very Much.,1400630400,,105,4.0476190476190474
8060144,4,B0009G3BEM,"This is actually a pretty good movie.  I would have never ever imagined Eddie Griffin in such a serious action-packed, stunt-filled movie if I didn't watch see this with my own peepers.  He's such a funny comedian, who would've thought EG could do a 360 and play a different type of character.  The story line is decent and there are some touching moments here and there, some comedy and a lot of action and explosions. Personally, as an Eddie Griffin fan, I feel it's a movie worth adding to my collection.",1388620800,,507,4.549450549450549
8060145,5,B0009G3BEM,"I really enjoyed this movies
love makes determined
a feeling involved
no matter the risk

good cast, I think
warm hugs",1387238400,,118,4.619047619047619
8060146,2,B0009G3BEM,"Terrible, just terrible - but in a funny way, it was jaw droppingly poor, with fun performances by Eddie Griffin, Vivica Fox and that Australian dude who always plays an effective overblown psychopath and a surprisingly expensive supporting cast.  The sound track was terrific too, the whole thing didn't make any sense but in an easily digested, pat American blow em up shoot em down sort of way.  ""You did it Dix"" - inexplicably cast white kid, concludes in the flames of the dark oil platform before it is suddenly daylight on the surface of the oil platform as the FBI, Seals, EPA, run around the nonburning oil platform and everyone is offered jobs by the hot woman fed, then Eddie Griffin looks over his shoulder looking tough and the hard core music kicks in with kids singing.  I'm not joking - this actually happens, I almost thought this movie was a joke like Undercover Brother, and then I realized it was, but not in the way I thought.",1386720000,,947,4.591715976331361
8060147,5,B0009G3BEM,Went well with my Blast o Butter popcorn.  The package was easy to open the movie was great.  Keep up the good work.,1361750400,,116,4.0
8060148,3,B0009G3BEM,You know... terrorists/criminals take over a structure and there's one retired special ops type hero innocently on the inside. I will not waste your time describing the story any further as there's nothing new to tell. The action scenes are decent. The story moves along at a good pace. Character development is good for a pure action flick. Actors are all decent. Chemistry between the main protagonists threatens to ignite. It never quite does but it's entertaining enough to watch. Eddie Griffin pulls off the hero role well enough. He's not gonna be the best action hero but he's better than a lot of actors who try it. There's nothing special here but it's an entertaining movie for an otherwise boring evening.,1319760000,,716,4.877049180327869
8060149,3,B0009G3BEM,"Blast (2004) is an action/adventure set on a sea based oil rig, floating off the southern California coast.  Hardly a new idea, but it is still executed fairly well here.  Eddie Griffin is Lamont Dixon, and ex-fireman turned tugboat operator, hired to tow the rig out to the undersea well.  The task of connecting up to the well is interrupted when pseudo-protesters turn terrorist, board the rig, and take it over at gunpoint.  Led by renegade environmentalist Michael Kittredge (Vinnie Jones), the group is demanding that the oil company cease operations.  The FBI is called in, with Agent Lisa Reed (Vivica A. Fox) heading the negotiation team.

Dixon finds an unlikely ally in Jamaal (Breckin Meyer), one of the terrorists, who has a link to Agent Reed.  Jamaal is a tech, who has several run-ins with an acrobatic, backflipping terrorist named Lola (Nadine Velazquez).  The film features some decent action sequences, some of which could have benefitted from slightly improved special effects.

Blast is a bit offbeat, but holds together better than expected, for a film that features comedian Eddie Griffin in the lead role.  There are times where thing go too far, but balance is usually restored before long, preserving a certain level of credibility.  Vinnie Jones (The Condemned) has the crazed nutcase role down pat.  Directed by Anthony Hickox, the film is apparently a remake of a 1997 German production.  The presentation is widescreen, with no English subtitles, or extra features.",1255910400,4,1496,5.106995884773663
8060150,3,B0009G3BEM,Eddie proved that he can do a serious role.  I was impressed by his acting and the movie was ok.,1217635200,,96,3.8
