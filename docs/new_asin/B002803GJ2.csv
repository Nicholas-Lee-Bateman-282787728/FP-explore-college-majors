3870118,4,B002803GJ2,This is a good DVD. A lot of work went into the the overall concept and presentation by D. McCrary and Co. I wasn't disappointed. The musicians were impressive. I think one of the major highlights of the DVD was Albert Lee's performance. To me it stood out among the rest...and the rest were all very impressive. Albert just had the band in stitches with his pickin'. It made me laugh it was so good (and the band members too).,1354233600,5,427,4.35
3870119,5,B002803GJ2,"One of the best concerts/history lesson I've ever seen!!  If you're a guitar player, you have to see this show.  Doc Watson alone, made the show!!",1353888000,2,146,4.576923076923077
3870120,5,B002803GJ2,I first saw this DVD on PBS on television.  I was absolultely amazed.  This is the best guitar music dvd I have ever seen.  I purchased this DVD because of the program on PBS.  Anyone who watches this better be prepared to be astonished at the talent on this DVD.,1327363200,3,263,4.2
3870121,5,B002803GJ2,This has to be the best music DVD I have ever scene bar none. I couldn't find one thing I was unhappy about.,1313193600,4,108,3.739130434782609

8355294,5,B002803GJ2,"As a guitarist and educator, my first reaction was, ""Well, every student in the county needs to see this. Schools need to buy this and send it around to every classroom."" With music and arts program cuts, this helps fill a need by being educational and entertaining. Hats off to Dan Crary for pulling it off so well!",1461542400,,316,4.4655172413793105
8355295,5,B002803GJ2,In a word . . . fantastic!  Don't hesitate to buy for yourself or as a gift.,1404259200,,76,3.4705882352941178
8355296,2,B002803GJ2,"I know that it's probably impossible to get even two guitar fans to agree on the best players, but I think quite a few were not used on this DVD.",1390780800,,145,3.8666666666666667
8355297,3,B002803GJ2,"The guitarists featured were obscure, and I did not feel that the movie actually did what it was advertised to do, give a history of the guitar.",1390262400,,144,4.37037037037037
8355298,5,B002803GJ2,I have watched this dvd over and over and just keep enjoying it. The production is first rate and the bonus material is very interesting. The performances are stellar and are excellent examples of the various styles of music that can be played on a guitar. I would recommend it for anybody who is moved by the music a guitar makes. Great job by Dan Crary and crew!,1374537600,,364,4.367647058823529
8355299,4,B002803GJ2,Engaging narration and excellent musicianship which provide fascinating information about the guitar and its history.  Some tremendously talented guitarists highlighted.,1371859200,,169,7.45
8355300,5,B002803GJ2,"I was at one of these concerts, so I am in a unique position to say whether or not the DVD captures the essence of what went on at the show. It does a magnificent job of conveying not only the performances, but also the feel of what went on. Watching this onscreen is almost as good as being there. In some ways it's better because there are multiple angles that a seated spectator would not be able to see.  The sound and picture are crystal clear.  This is highly recommended for anyone who loves the guitar. It's a guided tour of the instrument's history and the music people have made with it through the years.",1369008000,3,615,4.293103448275862
8355301,4,B002803GJ2,"Really enjoyed the historical perspective.  I had never seen (or heard of) the Harp Guitar ... amazing sounds.
Dan tells a good story with the musical styles to back it up.  The Flamenco segment was awesome!
I recommended this to several of my friends who play, and they all enjoyed it.  The only reason it did not get 5 stars is because the DVD did not have the Doc Watson song ""Little Sadie"" that was part of the PBS presentation.",1364947200,,432,4.375
8355302,4,B002803GJ2,A really great video for anyone who loves the guitar. I just wish they'd spent more time on the instrument's ancient history.,1363737600,,125,4.7272727272727275
