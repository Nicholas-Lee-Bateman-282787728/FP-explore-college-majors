7984787,4,B00008K77X,Interesting.  Gives a virtual tour of the land and life of Jane Austen.,1431388800,,71,4.461538461538462
7984788,3,B00008K77X,"It is an hour long tour of all that is Austen. Where she was born, various places that she lived and then where she died. The in-between places consist of her life with her family, and all about her family.",1191110400,,206,4.175
7984789,3,B00008K77X,The video was fairly informative but the narrator had a tendancy to stray.  There were a few too many shots of flowers as well.,1189209600,2,127,4.291666666666667
7984790,2,B00008K77X,"While there is a wealth of facts and items of interest presented here they are given in such a dry manner as to cause one's mind to wander. In particular, the narrator has all the charm and charisma of Miss Austen's least desirable male characters -- I would prefer a Mr. Collins sermon to this dull and droning creature!

Perhaps A&E, the BBC or another organization will take the content of this  well intentioned but compromised shoestring production and do something that engages and entertains while it educates.

Jane Austen deserves better.",1173744000,9,547,4.923913043478261
7984791,4,B00008K77X,"This is a great Jane Austen documentary, that delves deeper into Austen's life; Informative and educational, as well as interesting, narrarated by a man with a fun British accent!
This DVD tours the countryside, showing places and things having to do with Jane and her life.  It offers some insight into Jane's views on things, what society and life was like for her at that time, and where she would have vacationed, what she would have done, etc.
I enjoyed this very much, and I'm sure you will too!  Highly recommended to any fan of Jane Austen!!",1082419200,54,549,4.649484536082475
