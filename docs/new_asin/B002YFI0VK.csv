And you get 5 of this best stories! This Movies are digitaly restored,which make their quality even better,than the time they were made. Enjoy them, as they are difficult to find.

8447298,1,B002YFI0VK,"I was really looking forward to watching these films but was rather disappointed. They seem to have been copied from a bootleg edition: five films squeezed into one DVD even though double-sided. On the website the cover looks like a box set but it is not. There is a lot of background noise throughout all the films. The films were not digitally remastered. Poor resolution and sound. Don't waste your money on this. Just not worth it.

As for the films themselves, they were equally a letdown. They badly aged. The storylines were quite naive. It is rather a disappointing experience to revisit some of the once admired films to discover that they did not pass the test of time.",1309219200,,679,4.658333333333333
