8501446,5,B006NOBZGA,"I remember watching this on TV back in the early nineties and being hooked by it.  I certainly never thought that I would ever see it again, let alone find it on DVD.  After devouring Volume 1 I knew right away that I wanted this product - volume 2.  The story line is full of suspense and mystery, and the final twist as to what happened to the little girl Becky Campbell is completely unexpected.  I won't go any further, as I don't wish to spoil it for others who are considering purchasing this DVD series.  Purchase it yourself to find out.",1412985600,,545,4.303921568627451
