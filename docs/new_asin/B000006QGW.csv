7904893,5,B000006QGW,"Benjamin Kubelsky was his real name. But we knew him as the lovable, penurious, and always-funny JACK BENNY!
Jack was 80 years old when he passed away in December 1974, but thanks to video tapes like this A&E ""Biography"", Jack will never be forgotten.
A&E's always-entertaining and thorough ""Biography"" series this time shines a loving and endearing spotlight on Jack Benny (quite naturally -- for how else *could* someone remember this man; I think he was one of the ""most liked"" performers ever).
Many insights into the life and long, long career of Mr. Benny are explored in this program, which is hosted and narrated by Peter Graves. A wealth of old film clips from Jack's TV shows and an occasional movie role are also shown during this ""Biography"" (which is subtitled ""Now Cut That Out!"").  And while his movies didn't win any ""Best Picture"" honors (to say the least), they still offered up a different medium for Jack to display his talents as one of the best comedians in the business.
Jack's ""age"" is also discussed (of course) on this VHS video.  Jack's long-running joke of always staying the same age (39) never seemed to grow old or tiresome.  He ""renewed"" it each year by just being himself on stage and on television.
If you want to know the *true* chronological facts regarding Mr. Benny's ""maturity"" status, then by no means ever watch his TV series!  He'll never tell!
Jack *actually* turned 39 years of age on February 14, 1933 (just one year after he began his radio show).  Hard to believe he was *still* 39 when his TV series ended in April of 1965. LOL!
Jack Benny was even funnier when he was poking fun at himself -- with the ""age"" and ""stingy"" gags just ripe for this kind of self-mockery. A very funny example of this was when Jack appeared as a guest on the game show ""Password"" on May 29, 1962. He was given the word ""miser"".  When Jack's first clue to his partner was ""Me"", the house came down in fits of laughter.  LOL!  :)
This VHS tape runs for approximately 50 minutes, with a Full Frame (1.33:1) video aspect ratio.  The audio is in Hi-Fi Stereo.
If you'd like to know some ""insider"" info on one of the greatest TV and Radio performers of all-time (known as a Mr. Jack Benny), then pick up this A&E video right away.  It's got the straight dope on this violin-playing, Maxwell-driving, toupee-wearing comedian.",1085356800,5,2345,4.615384615384615
