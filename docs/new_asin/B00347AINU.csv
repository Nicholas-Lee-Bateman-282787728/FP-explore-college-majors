4066472,5,B00347AINU,"...which is much more than that. It is a very good Myrna Loy movie, with great supporting casts.
The first 2 minutes, I feared it would turn out to be a comedy, but the film soon changed into a
complicated story, not avoiding difficult questions or dramatic twists, that may still be found disturbing.
All in all - the film is far better than earlier reviews I have read, and apart from being romantic and
beautiful - an echo from an era long gone - it has a lot of nerve, and includes brutal and schocking elements.
It is well worth seeing, and I am glad to have it in my collection.",1366502400,8,584,4.223214285714286
4066473,3,B00347AINU,"I love Myrna Loy and thought she was beautiful as the young English woman in this movie.  I didn't know anything about Ramon Navarro.  It was hard to accept him as a romantic lead, and a prince pursuing a woman after reading that his death was caused by two young men he'd hired for the evening. Many other gay actors have succeeded fabuously in heterosexual romantic roles, but Ramon Navarro just didn't in my opinion.  After raping the lady and bringing her to tears, he declares his love for her, so she leaves her groom at the altar to go off with Navarro.  Whose fantasy was that?  Most of the movie made me giggle. It didn't make sense to me in 2012.  The actress who plays Loy's maid was wonderfully funny.",1354147200,,713,4.404580152671755
8388252,5,B00347AINU,"Ten stars!  Very entertaining screen play, love the music. Didn't understand all the words in the song so we sent for the sheet music and was surprised to be able to get it. Myrna Loy and Ramon Novarro were really good together. Too bad they didn't make a sequel!  we play the DVD over and over again just to hear the music and see the acting. Ramon Novarro really did a beautiful job of singing Love Songs of The Nile. Wish I could find an old record of Mr Novarro singing that song somewhere.  Also heard some of the melody from Temptation in the background which is my favorite song. Had the sheet music for years. Still can't believe I was lucky to get a copy of this great video!  Thank you.",1487376000,,696,4.25
8388253,2,B00347AINU,"Very disappointing, mainly because of the character of the so-called hero.",1483401600,,74,5.818181818181818
8388254,4,B00347AINU,wish the video could have been clearer but the source material is probably to blame. good movie.,1447027200,,96,4.705882352941177
8388255,5,B00347AINU,I am very satisfied with this purchase.,1428192000,,39,4.714285714285714
8388256,3,B00347AINU,"This review is not on the quality of the movie itself which the other reviewers have covered, this is about the DVD's ability to only be used in a DVD player. I put the DVD in my PC, didn't play, put in a portable player/writer again didn't play. I checked the box it came in and  there near the bottom it states the DVD is expected to play back in DVD ""play only"" devices and may not play back in other DVD devices including recorders and PC Drives. Therefore anyone buying this DVD to play on their PC or with a player/writer on their tablets are out of luck, this should of been clearly stated on the item page. Thanks a lot, just what I need another coaster, maybe a friend will have a play only DVD player!",1426636800,2,711,4.1521739130434785
8388257,3,B00347AINU,"THE BARBARIAN (1933) starring Ramon Navarro and Myrna Loy is/was an agreeable, no-brainer ""B"" movie with ""A"" movie stars of talent, esp. Loy.

It's a desert romance story of which the 20's were packed (both Valentino SHIEK movies, THE DESERT SONG and others less famous).

None of the Arabs had dark skin, and all of the Oases had unpolluted water holes and half moons shining through the sweeping palm trees and all the sand looked like White Sands, New Mexico with huge (but firm, easy to walk on) sand dunes.

Hollywood's idea of the desert in ""Arabia.""

The movie is a ""girl's movie"" (called a ""Chick Flick"" nowadays) written by GENTLEMEN PREFER BLONDES author Anita Loos.

The movie is about a pushy (probably feminist), spoiled ""half Egyptian"" leading lady with an American accent about to marry an English aristocrat in Egypt (but who runs off with Ramon Navarro at the very end of the movie..... Ramon had told her when he abducted her in the middle of the movie and proposed marriage that she won't have to be part of a harem, but makes her wait for water at an Oasis waterhole until the horse drinks first, then he drinks.....she's last to drink.)

Girls buy movie tickets.

Young guys between ages 18 and 24 courting girls and trying to keep the girls happy ALSO buy movie tickets for girls!

""Keep the girls happy"" is what this movie is all about.

She's a pushy, spoiled USA feminista, and the guys (two of them!) both think she's wonderful!

It's just like WHEN HARRY MET SALLY (1988) starring Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal.

They guys never learn, the girls always win.

The guys always pension off the girls at an early age (which is why marriage is so popular with young girls) and kill themselves to do it, and the girls live 30 years longer than the guys, thanks to the good life the martyr husband earned for them before he died early!

Unpardonable cynicism, but I put to you and leave it with you.

Old story, and it still goes on!

The rising races of the world (Orientals, Latinos in the USA) ALL support the ladies, lots of children, and ""family values"" and the disappearing races (White people loyal to each other in the USA esp.) disappear because their numbers shrink and disappear, like a water hole during a drought.

So it goes, and THE BARBARIAN (1933) shows why!

Myrna's famous bathtub ""nude scene"" was dull and boring, (not as good as Maureen O'Sullivan's swim with Johnny Weismuller in TARZAN AND HIS MATE 1934).

Myrna was/is a true movie star, and was the best actor in the movie. A pleasure to watch her act.

Ramon Navarro wasn't terrible, but also wasn't convincing. His career didn't continue in the sound era, and this movie shows why.",1424995200,,2675,4.617336152219873
8388258,5,B00347AINU,A classic movie. Enjoying every second of watching over and over again!,1407456000,,71,5.0
8388259,5,B00347AINU,Everything about this movie is wonderful- starting with Navarro and Loy and all of the supporting cast- not to mention the Pyramids and the desert romp.,1394064000,2,152,4.884615384615385
8388260,5,B00347AINU,"Myrna Loy plays Myrna Loy pre-Nora Charles here, that is to say sexy but cool even strong, this time it is her leading man doing the vamping. Ramon Novarro, who was the most convincing gay guy playing straight in the 1930s is as usual convincing for us to believe that he CRAVES Myrna physically, of course what man, even a gay one, wouldn't? The subtle almost feminine masculinity of Novarro is evenly paired with the Loy's defensive yet strong nature. Not quite Garbo's androgyny, which worked best for Novarro and Melvyn Douglas in his comedic incarnations, but Myrna proves that she can stand her ground (no pun intended) here, she has a ""backbone of steel"" and it is needed to offset Novarro's character and personality. It comes off wonderfully, the acting, the setting, and the music.",1392768000,,791,4.823529411764706
8388261,4,B00347AINU,"What I liked most about this film was the look of the black and white photography.  You can't find this kind of lighting in color film anymore.  And it is beautiful, especially the nighttime scenes shot in desert locales.  The story is a good example of what women from that time period (20's and early 30's) thought was the height of romance, to be swept away by a desert prince into the wastes so he could have his way with them.  Rather incomprehensible to modern people.  But the film  is shot so beautifully and the dialogue and sets are clever and well written, you could almost be persuaded. Performances by Myrna Loy and Ramon Navarro are polished and entertaining. Worth seeing if just for the rather fascinating peek into a time period that no longer exists.",1392768000,7,768,4.610294117647059
