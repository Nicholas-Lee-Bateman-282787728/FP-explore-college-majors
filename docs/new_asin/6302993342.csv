528739,5,6302993342,"If this is the Oedipus Rex conducted by Ozawa, starring Jessye Norman, other opera greats and the most impressive chorus I have ever heard, then you MUST see and hear this production!  It's musically powerful, visually  stunning and acted with incredible dignity and life.  I have never been so  impressed with a video production of any opera... and I've seen and enjoyed  many.  This is a must have for any opera lover.

528740,5,6302993342,"If this is the live recording from the Japanese Saito Kinen festival 1993, it is the most stunning performance of Oedipus Rex that I know!  Norman's stately Jocaste, along with the enourmously powerful Japanese speaker (Kayoko Shiraishi's  monologues in Japanese lends much more patos than the original French), as well as  the amazing staging production turns this into an amazingly impressive performance!",939686400,9,407,5.532258064516129
528798,4,6302993342,The production was directed my Julie Taymor- the reason I selected it. She is amazing and the opera is stunningly theatrical. Definately worth a look!,1367452800,,150,5.04
528799,5,6302993342,The performance is outstanding.  From the music to the costumes and settings it was just stunning.,1272931200,,98,5.125
528800,3,6302993342,"The fake heads hovering over the real heads did not work for me --
especially when the camera zoomed onto a real head, partially made-up to
look like the costumed body below the fake head.  Creon in particular
was ludicrous.

In general, I felt that the staging fought for attention with the music
instead of supporting the music.

And here's a minor point.  Repeated phrases frequently went unsubtitled.
This was unsettling.

Overall, a nice try.  I was hoping for better from the director
of the Titus Andronicus movie.",1228521600,,521,4.863636363636363
528801,4,6302993342,"This is a stunning and daring production of a real jewel. Stravinsky's music for this opera-oratorio is compelling and beautiful. Julie Taymor succeeded in transforming what the composer saw as a static staging into a great experience with the right amount of movement without contradicting the composer's vision.
This was a staged production with some minimal additions to create a film. It was performed in 1992 (and filmed on super film) so, compared to today's films and technologies, it looks old. But, with a little imagination you can be transported into the theater. Being in that theater should have been an incredible experience!
The singers are exceptional including the young Bryan Terfel. The reconstructed sound is very good.
I strongly recommend this DVD to anyone interested in Stravinsky's work, and who longs for creative and daring production of operas that maintain the composer's vision.",1225497600,,908,5.3125
528802,5,6302993342,"Having been so totally pleased with Julie Taymor's presentations of Mozart's Magic Flute and Across the Universe, I decided to try her version of Stravinsky's opera Oedipus Rex.  I was not disappointed.  It was a riveting performance, such a satisfying and rich visual and musical experience.  If anyone has a hard time getting into the Greek classics, this is the way to overcome that obstacle.",1207785600,,395,5.046153846153846
528803,5,6302993342,"Stravinsky's masterwork ""Oedipus Rex"" ....a Greek play translated into Latin, set as a monumental-staged-oratorio, Igor's unique stylization of Verdi's idiom, add another layer of Japanese staging....Don't hesitate. Buy it. (One of Jessye's best ever roles)",1207612800,2,257,6.371428571428571
528804,5,6302993342,"Not much to say...I'm simply stunned and speechless, in agreement with the most extreme of all you enthusiasts. I just found this DVD up here in the Mexican High Sierra, and I can hardly express my delight with it. I'm in the classical music world, and really know what a valuable thing Julie Taynor has done for every creative soul: from Sophocles, Cocteau, e.e.cummings and Stravinsky, to all the people she's inspired in the concept of this ""oratorio"". As Jessye Norman says; she felt she was co-creating with Taynor, something that brought out the best in her. Already a goddess, that's saying something.

The DVD production is A-1, and as Julie and Jessye suggest: turn off the subtitles (you know the story) and just let the magic - the dancing, the sets, the costumes, the acting, and above all Stravinsky's powerful music, transport you back to a time when human beings were the playthings of the gods, and when the rational mind had not yet destroyed our imaginative capacities.

Buy this production NOW before it disappears. You just never know.",1180483200,2,1055,4.855555555555555
528805,5,6302993342,"Gifted director/designer Julie Taymor apparently secures one amazing success after another, and this arresting production is surely one of her supreme creations! Adapting the conventions of the seventeenth-century opera-oratorio, Stravinsky's 1927 score marks the beginning of his neoclassical period, with absolute command of both orchestral writing and dramatic intensity. It's interesting that Stravinsky's stated reason for choosing Latin for the score's libretto - '(it) had the great advantage of giving me a medium not dead but turned to stone, and so monumentalised as to have become immune from any risk of vulgarisation' - is precisely that offered by the Roman Church as the reason for her codification of Latin as its liturgical language (before the desacralisation of the Roman liturgy by neo-modernist barbarians). In fact, Cocteau's libretto was translated from French to Latin by the Jesuit (later Cardinal) Jean Danielou. The impersonality of the text/poem itself has the adroit effect of freezing dramatic consequence to the point of white heat, intuitively heightening the entire drama, something Stravinsky no doubt foresaw and is, interestingly, the key facet out of which Taymor vividly draws unerring pathos. The design of this production is like nothing else! That being said,  the singing is magnificent - Jessye Norman, Philip Landridge and Bryn Terfel all in rare and perfect form, Norman especially, with her leonine face and voice delivers a riveting Jocasta in the performance of a career, something all the more shocking given the princely Impersonal so deliberately embedded by Stravinsky in the score itself. Norman and Ozawa have often worked together to wonderful effect (their recording of Carmen comes to mind), and the elucidation of detail he draws from the Saito Kinen Orchestra is astonishing at every turn. This is a piece impossible to completely absorb in one read through, but repeated viewings easily yield its greatness, and the DVD bonus extras are a vital part of reaping every ounce of the greatness of this superb production. Highest recommendation.",1166832000,20,2100,5.461538461538462
528806,5,6302993342,"This is the best production of ANYTHING I have ever seen.
I could go on and on about this but I'd run out of superlatives in no time at all.
We've waited a long time for this to become available. I'm glad it's here at last.",1150416000,,223,3.869565217391304
528807,5,6302993342,"Oedipus Rex is probably my favorite of Stravinsky's works (which is obviously saying a lot), and Julie Taymor's production enriches the opera in every conceivable way.  On one hand, it may not be totally true to the distance and austerity Stravinsky originally had in mind, but Taymor strikes a perfect balance with her reserved yet extremely artistic staging.  She draws emotion from the work that is obviously present, no matter what Stravinsky may have maintained!

The cast is great, Ozawa and the musicians interpret the music well...I could go on and on.  Thank goodness they finally released this on DVD...I'm replacing my bootleg VHS version!",1130630400,8,650,5.161904761904762
528818,5,6302993342,"After the Lion King, is there any more famous or lauded director today than Julie Taymor, a status confirmed again by her magical production of Magic Flute for the Met this season?  Add in Euripides, Stravinsky, Jessye Norman, Seiji Ozawa and a young(er) Bryn Terfel - if this isn't this an all-star lineup made in heaven, what is?

What a sad commentary on the current state of marketing opera and classical music that it's taken over a decade to bring this incredible production to DVD (up to now it's been available only on VHS)

And incredible this production is.  The marriage of Euripides, with his implicit violence depicted only in the voice of the chorus, and the neo-classical Stravinsky - far from the death-dance of Le Sacre - would appear a perfect marriage of dramatic reserve, yet, as I once heard Pierre Boulez say in an open rehearsal (and this is a gross paraphrase - I was so stunned to hear such a thing from another so famous an ascetic that I was momentarily disoriented)  ""Stravinsky was well known for saying music - his music particularly - is capable only of expressing itself, and not any sort of underlying emotional content.  We all know better, of course.""

As always, Taymor takes big chances.  Oedipus is a man overlayed with symbol, a puppet head his crown and huge puppet hands at his sides, enough to send you into fits of giggles if the drama weren't so focused and riveting.

 The male chorus is like a tribe of mudmen, attired in the rags of starvation, caked in the dust of drought.  The imagery of a soaring vulture superimposed on the stage at the beggining of the opera, the way extras wrap Jocasta in the woven bounds of her hanging, the way the dissolution of Oedipus is evoked by the singer being doubled in a second Oedipus figure whose cast-like armour is dismembered to disgorge the disgraced king, to final scene of the chorus of mudmen, standing beneath the downpour that has broken the plague, as stoic and motionless as the field of terra cotta warriors unearthed in China, until their heads turn, ever-so-slightly, their eyes full of pity as they watch the naked, blinded Oedipus slowly walk between them on his road to exile and oblivion - one unforgettable image follows another.

Under Ozawa's direction, the cast, chorus and Saito Kinen orchestra are firing on all cylinders.  In the way she channels the underlying power of both Euripides' text and Stravinky's music, Taymor raises the opera to the level of ritual - not empty ritual as ritual most often becomes, but the raw ritual just hatched from primal experience.

This DVD is a ""must-have""",1117238400,54,2604,4.732300884955753
528819,5,6302993342,This production is a complete revelation. It was recently shown on Artsworld and it blew me away. Why it should only be available to people with over $100 to spare defeats me.,1114473600,2,175,4.5

if this is ever released again buy it immeidately.
now, would the accountants at philips please act like you care an iota for the very people who buy your product and release this on dvd for longer than 5 minutes? or would you at least re release it on vhs.

7833165,5,6302993342,"Rather you like Stravinsky or not, the stupendously ingenious staging of this oratorio/opera production is mind boggling.  Julie Taymor, the genius behind The Lion King, is equally original here.  The event was staged in Japan, so she uses a lot of Japanese tradition including a famous Japanese actress who brings incredible style to the spoken interludes with the blend of gravel and exactness of enunciation in her voice.  There is also Taymors' love of masks which adds another layer of mystery.  One could go on and on about this enthralling production but this is a true case of needing to see in order to believe.  For years I depended on a Laserdisc to dvd transfer so was delighted to find it had been reissued on dvd with some fascinating added material.  Very highest recommendation!!",1444262400,,795,4.895522388059701
7833166,5,6302993342,"Beautiful Jessye Norman's performance is superlative, as usual.  Julie Taymor's uniquely creative vision and direction are inspired by her deep knowledge of anthropology, history and the stage.  Oedipus Rex is one of the ancient stories most central to the experience of what it means to be human.  Stravinsky transports this story into a full-fidelity musical interpretation intended to inform the modern age.  This stage production of Stravinsky's musical ode to the myth is a multi-layered revelation that enchants.",1441497600,,518,5.602564102564102

This performance, only given twice in Japan, is probably the best I have ever seen.  I really did not like ""The Rake's Progress"", but Stravinsky has redeemed himself in my eyes and ears.  Be sure to watch the interviews.  What a treat!.  By the way, I had rented it, and after 10 minutes I decided I had to have it.",1436313600,,477,4.175824175824176
