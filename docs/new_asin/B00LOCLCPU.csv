6495645,5,B00LOCLCPU,I prefer the old movies. I love this one even though it is one. Saw it on TV the other day. Price is good too.,1416355200,6,110,3.44
6495646,5,B00LOCLCPU,"This DVD is the COLORIZED film version of A Christmas Carol (originally titled Scrooge), starring Alastair Sim in the title role.  While I haven't yet watched the movie in its entirety (since I want to save it for Christmas Eve viewing), I did put it in my DVD player to be sure I'd received the colorized version of the original black and white classic.  I've long considered this 1951 jewel to be THE very best film adaptation of Charles Dickens' ""A Christmas Carol"", and I first watched it in color on TCM a decade or two ago.  Since that time, I'd hoped to see it in color again (despite my also always enjoying the black & white version), but the unwarranted controversy over the colorization of classic movies prevented me from doing so (I say unwarranted because there's no reason why fans shouldn't be free to choose for themselves what style of movie they'd like to watch, as long as copyright holders have made both black & white and colorized versions available).  Now thanks to Amazon, I'll be looking forward to seeing this wonderful movie again in the festive Christmas hues that bring cozy warmth to a cold, gray, northern, holiday night.

The only extras included on the disc are a 1944 cartoon (Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer) and a handful of promos for additional nostalgic-oriented, old-time Christmas offerings that are available for purchase from VCI.

UPDATE:  My family and I did indeed watch the DVD on Christmas Eve and thoroughly enjoyed it.  We saw no problems with the colorization, the audio, the quality, or editing/splicing (as some other unfortunate recipients of their DVDs have reported they experienced).  I don't know if this was due to different copies of the DVD going out to them, but the one I received was fine.  All in all, this terrific colorized classic has now become a treasured addition to our holiday film library!",1415145600,43,1863,4.8119122257053295
6495647,1,B00LOCLCPU,I bought it thinking it was the Reginald Owen version as per the description. It is not. The Alistair Sim version is fine but I already have it. I am returning this one.,1413936000,,169,4.151515151515151
6495648,1,B00LOCLCPU,"Don't know which version of the movie this item is for.  The DVD cover is from the 1951 version starring Alastair Sim, but the actors names it shows the actors from the 1938 version starring Reginald Owen and Gene Lockhart.",1413417600,4,223,4.575

6495721,5,B00LOCLCPU,"This version of the famous story, with Alastair Sim, is by far the best one.  Two other version staring George C. Scott, and Patrick Stuart are also good, but this 'original"" telling cannot be improved upon.
And this colorized version has the best quality picture, and the sound has also been restored and cleaned up.  The foreword and summery by Patrick Macnee (who appeared in the film) is an added bonus.

For 36 years, watching the Christmas Carol during the holidays has been a family tradition.  In 1981 (before VCRs became affordable) we would borrow a 16mm film projector and the film from the public library.  In those days, watching a movie at home was a special event, and watching this film at Christmas quickly became a part of our celebration.

Establish your own Christmas traditions, and be sure that this version of A Christmas Carol is part of it.",1519948800,,865,4.733333333333333

6495815,5,B00LOCLCPU,In my opinion Alastair Sim gives the most impressive portrayal of Scrooge out of all the versions out there. From the very beginning when the people are collecting money for charity to feed the poor with his WHY? response to feeding the poor he just appears to be so uncaring and how at the end of the movie he is such a changed person that he doesnt even seem to be the same person that just a short time earlier you hated only to love at the end of the movie. This movie is up there with likes of It's a wonderful life with its ability to bring out a few tears of joy at the end.,1514332800,,581,3.9743589743589745

6495829,4,B00LOCLCPU,"It's a 5+ star movie and by far the definitive version of this great story. My rating really reflects the colorization. I firmly believe that the source of the films negative should always be identified for all sold DVDs as well as the DATE and SPECIFIC COLORIZATION PROCESS. As we could run the gamut from hand-painted negatives to computer-generated colorization from an original negative source to a washed out, chopped copy. As the movie has a large number of night scenes - great liberties (and shortcuts) can be used in the colorization process. So there are times that the colorization does not add any real significant value to the viewing experience (when Marley first appears on the door knock) while there are some scenes (when Scrooge goes to ho his nephew's party) where the colors are quite pleasing. However, a large portion of the film brings dull somewhat washed out colors. As I have both the B&W and colorized versions - I choose the version I'm in the mood for ... which in most cases in the B&W version as I just find it easier and more pleasant to watch.",1513900800,,1076,4.668421052631579
6495830,2,B00LOCLCPU,Great movie I've owned it before this one. The only problem is that the color version is very grainy can't watch.  Would like to swap out for the black & white version.... need help,1513814400,2,181,4.323529411764706

6495832,5,B00LOCLCPU,"Without a doubt the best and only version of 'A Christmas Carol's that one need own or watch. The movie was released when I was 2 years old and I have watched it every Xmas for the past 66 years and always become tearful at the end. Although black and white is my favorite, this colorized version is very well done and worth the money. Enjoy!",1513296000,,342,4.196969696969697
6495833,5,B00LOCLCPU,"Ebenezer Scrooge a tight fisted bitter and selfish miser in 19th century London, who despises all that brings joy and comfort and above all denies social responsibility for the less fortunate in society.

Of all the versions of A Christmas Carol/Scrooge this one is not only my favourite but also the most authentic to the Charles Dickens novel.
Sterling British cast , suitably scary haunting scenes with Marley and the arrival of the ghosts. Tear jerking moments like the death of Scrooge's sister and the feared death of Tiny Tim.
The most important part of this story is the powerful social message. Essentially the story revived the spirit and message of Christmas and contains a powerful social message about those members of the wealthier classes who shun responsibility for the less fortunate people in their country.

Such pearls as the following light up this story:
""Men's courses will foreshadow certain ends, which if persevered in, must lead, but if the courses be departed from, the ends will change"".",1513209600,2,1016,5.041666666666667

6495873,5,B00LOCLCPU,"Due to the circumstances and choices in the life of Ebenezer Scrooge, he has chosen money over mankind. His partner now seven years dead comes back to warn Ebenezer of his afterlife fate if he does not change his ways. To assist in this task are three spirits, Christmas past (his past), Christmas present, and Christmas of things to come. Can or will Ebenezer change his ways? Why should he?

There are many versions of this tale floating around out there including study books and animated movies. Of all these versions a few stand out. This is one of the versions that come to mind.
Made in the era of black and white, one can not help but shun any attempt to colorize it. The Alastair Sim version is a product of its day and he does a very good job of portraying Ebenezer Scrooge. He comes across as mean in his speech of ""are there no work houses?"" and stingy, displayed during his meal, upon hearing that more bread will cost he says, ""No more bread.""

On Christmas morning he goes overboard with the maniacal laughter. This is probably emphasized to show his change of heart and to allow him to scare the maid. However it does distract from the story. The story is modified a bit but unless you have been reading the book you will not notice this. To tie his childhood memories of his sister to his present day nephew, they play ""Barbra Allen"" in the back ground (nice touch.)

All in all this will make a nice addition to you Christmas collection",1497398400,,1454,4.438202247191011

6496071,4,B00LOCLCPU,"It is a movie that was made 65 years ago, one must not expect the quality of production to be as good as those made more recently. I am a collector of 'Scrooge' AKA, 'A Christmas Carol' videos. Alastair Sim is beyond a shadow of doubt the best actor to play the part. You also get important scenes not found in the others. Many prefer George Scott's portrayal, but only it's more modern quality of the production makes it better. The 1970 version starring Albert Finney is the most entertaining and my personal favorite because of the music and humor. In the 1951 version one has to get past the fact that Scrooge's 'love interest' is named 'Alice' instead of 'Belle' like the others. Which version one buys is going to depend on what he/she specifically is looking for.

6496074,5,B00LOCLCPU,"George C Scott's 1994 version has been relegated to second place after having seen this today on TCM. Filmed mostly on location, not on screen stage, in England and with an all English cast, this version is captivating, frightening and conveys the true economic and environmental depravity of the time. Alastair Sim brought a real life to the idea that Scrooge was a walled off coward who was reduced to rubble when all control was taken from him. When visited by the ghosts of Christmas past/present, his Scrooge persona was that of Darren McGavin in the nightstalker. He was a believable penitent soul after the ghost of Christmas future.

6496197,2,B00LOCLCPU,"The novel is not just a Christmas Fairy tale but a dark and rather bitter social commentary on the lives of the poor, in Victorian England.  Many versions try to pretty it up and don't deal with the larger context of the story.  The film is dark for a reason.  It shows the grinding poverty that Dickens intended. Many directors look for ways to add cutesy touches to the story.  What makes this version so special is the sense of authenticity.  We experience a view of the filth and hopelessness of Victorian London as the author knew it.  Giving it color, defeats the intentions of the director and the author.  We should feel the coldness and brutality of the age.  We should understand the mentality of the work-house, where poverty was a crime in itself.  How many were NOT reformed by the spirit of the season?  How many Tims died, without the intervention of a willing benefactor?  All too often, life is not made right and we continue to foster the coldness and inhumanity that Dickens railed against.  All too often, Scrooge is not reformed in the end but goes on as before.
Giving it a phony color palette, makes it easier on the eye and less stressful on our conscience.  Its not a pretty story and should be experienced as was intended.",1449446400,2,1248,4.542600896860987

6496251,5,B00LOCLCPU,"1951's British version of ""A Christmas Carol"" may be the best movie edition of the popular Charles Dickens classic. Delivered in crisp black and white, with its focus on the original story and not on special effects, it delivers the haunting message of Dickens' novella in a way that the many subsequent versions do not.

Alistair Sims is superb as Scrooge, easily and believably making the transition from grasping miser to a reformed man of Christmas spirit. We see Ebenezer rise from neglected schoolboy to poor but generous clerk to rich and ambitious businessman to stingy miser before confronting the three Christmas Spirits who change his life. His transformation is delivered with obvious physical joy, as he capers like a schoolboy and humbles himself to visit his disowned nephew.

Brian Hurst's direction is direct and brisk, as an excellent cast steps through the story in just 86 minutes, without missing a single key element. The Bob Crachitt family is especially well-cast, their sequences together fairly hum with genuine family feeling.

Unlike many of the later versions, this production makes the point that Ebenezer Scrooge must be frightened into good sense by the three ghosts, not entertained by them. At the same time, the ghosts are presented as the ultimately humane spirits they must be to give Scrooge hope for redemption.

This movie is highly recommended to fans of a great Christmas classic and those looking for a Christmas movie that imparts a real message.",1428278400,5,1490,5.094262295081967
