8535303,5,B005648SXG,"I loved this story of Ben's Chili Bowl. I am from VA and I have visited this landmark in DC. Hearing about the history of the owner and those who have visited was better than his chili and I tell you his chili was very tasty. The next time I get a chance to visit DC, I hope I can get another visit to the Chili Bowl. Thanks Stanley for a wonderful story!  Kathi Mills Amissville, VA",1308182400,,383,3.9740259740259742
