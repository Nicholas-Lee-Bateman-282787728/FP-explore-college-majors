8406725,5,B003VE9WZG,"I loved this documentary. It made me want to go out and help the next time I see an opportunity and not just sit around and watch the news. In the doc, Florida resident Dan Sheffer decides he's going to go and rescue people from the Astrodome. You'll feel the same emotions he feels as he gives a group of strangers a chance to rebuild their lives. Sure, it doesn't go as perfectly as he hoped, but that's what makes this story even more real and engaging.",1283385600,,456,4.252873563218391
8406726,4,B003VE9WZG,I like the film.  It shows another story of Katrina and the tragedy.  The human thread is really interesting and the results of helping strangers always have unintended consequences.  I saw it at a festival but am interested to see the special features on the DVD as it seems to have a lot.,1281398400,2,290,4.433962264150943
