8148580,5,B000J10HY4,A classic at the beginning of TV programming.  No high tech needed to make this story work. Mystery and TV history buffs should get this one.,1383782400,,141,4.423076923076923
8148581,2,B000J10HY4,"This CD of an ancient video is a fossil from the early days of primitive television in America. Production values were low. The series was originally shot live so all the scenes are genuinely sequential. Yet there is little evidence of the dramatic tension that supposedly accompanied live broadcasts of such ""classic television"" as Marty. Roscoe Karns as the eponymous Detective King obviously has a little trouble from time to time with his lines as written and instead paraphrases. The plots are as simple as you would expect give the restraints on numbers of characters and impossibility of exterior scenes. The series uses the even then hokey device of having King speak on the phone in every episode to his never-seen wife whose voice is nevertheless heard. There is novelty value here but not much else.",1315094400,,810,4.963235294117647

8148583,5,B000J10HY4,"THIS SHOW BRINGS BACK OLD MEMORIES OF GOOD DETECTIVE SHOWS.
WE WATCHED THESE IN THE 50'S.",1282089600,3,89,4.625
8148584,4,B000J10HY4,"I've been trying to collect all the various television detective shows from the early 50's.  This completed my little group, consisting of- Martin Kane, Man Against Crime, Ellery Queen and my personal favorite; Mark Saber, to name a few.  I like the fact that shows like Martin Kane, Private Eye and this one (Rocky King), was done live and therefore lends to a theater play feel, IE., anything can happen...and it does, for example, doors slam and pictures fall off the wall.  The stories aren't half bad either, considering they only have a half hour to present it.  All the P.I. shows were half hour then.  It wasn't until 77 Sunset Strip came along, that the a Detective Show was a full hour.  Unless, you consider Perry Mason a Detective Show.",1242604800,4,748,4.67175572519084
8148585,5,B000J10HY4,"This is pure nostalgia!  We watched it when it was on TV, and it was fun to see how much TV has changed.  Young people who are used to all kinds of special effects probably wouldn't take to it much, but anyone who remembers the '50s TV shows will really like to watch this DVD.",1241913600,,277,4.0181818181818185
8148586,5,B000J10HY4,"This is one of the first programs I ever watched on TV. I especially remember the raincoat (years before Colombo) and the inspector talking to his wife Mabel on the phone at the end of each show...'I'm coming home, Mabel'. The production was crude, but somehow more honest than today's efforts. Young people might buy these inexpensive episodes if they're at all curious as to what early TV was like.",1222819200,2,400,4.728571428571429
