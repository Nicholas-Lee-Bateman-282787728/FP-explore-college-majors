8033531,4,B0002W4SBS,"Living in the UK it is difficult to get good quality DVD's covering my favourite sport, that being basketball in the NBA.  This DVD gives the viewer a great insight into the mind set of the two young stars. It also shows the reality of the life they are stepping into by becoming an NBA player showing what happens behind the scenes not just game day.

It is a good watch made all the more interesting for me as not long after, my team the Knicks acquired Richardson as part of the 2005 draft.",1121817600,,493,4.23404255319149
8033532,5,B0002W4SBS,"NBA Basketball isn't my sport; I haven't ever seen a team or season that surpasses the Knicks of the late 60s when I was a kid.

But what's great about this movie is that it looks at two players more than the game or the teams, two youg guys on the threshold of stardom and money and fame.  That they handle it so well is surprising, even if any chump knows that NOT to leave college or highschool for the NBA doesn't make sense.

Still, in a time when some NBA players are going into the stands to  beat up fans, it's good to see two young men who were apparently so well loved and educated to this point, that they can slide into the NBA world with poise and aplomb.",1100995200,,668,4.076335877862595

Great music and you won't be bored at all watching it even if you don't like basketball.  You can even watch it with your girlfriend and you'll both enjoy it.  Also it gives you more of a glimpse of the actual life of young hot shot players in the nba than any special on espn or fox sports.  I definately recommend that you see this movie.
