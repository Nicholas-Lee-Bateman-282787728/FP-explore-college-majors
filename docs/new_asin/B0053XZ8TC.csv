8455882,5,B0053XZ8TC,"I have a few of the Jump force work outs with Anni.  As others indicated her voice and comments can be annoying, yet I enjoy the workouts.  She is  constantly changing using light weights and step aerobics giving you a good cardio work out. I like to combine Anni work outs with Jeri Love strength and cardio or other work outs.  I give this a 5 star as it may not be a favorite, but; I find I keep going back to it for a work out.  The one thing I do not like about Anni tapes is she does not give you a real warm up before you start to do plyometric moves which can cause you to get injured.  If I feel any stress, I stop and streach and than continue the work out.  For me the constant change in her work outs, makes it go by quick.  Sometimes I feel she could work a muscle group a little longer.  But; that is why I will trade off with Jeri Love, Karen Voight or Firm work outs.",1368230400,,883,3.888268156424581
8455883,5,B0053XZ8TC,I am a 45yr old advanced stepper (exercise 12hrs a week).  I didn't have 1lb weights so I used 2.5lbs. Very intense.  I recommend this workout for days when you want to combine cardio and strength.,1342915200,,197,4.444444444444445
8455884,5,B0053XZ8TC,I love this video.  It keeps your heat rate on a roller coaster ride throughout.  You will not be bored and time flies.  I totally recommend this to anyone who enjoys an intense step workout that's not too complicated.,1336521600,,218,4.538461538461538
8455885,5,B0053XZ8TC,"This is an outstanding workout!

There are 4 segments, 3 cardio and 1 abdominal toning, roughly 15 minutes each, followed by a cool down.  Each of the cardio segmets is broken down into individual minutes, with the first segment including a 3 minute warm-up.  A step and light handweights (1-2 lbs) are used in the DVD, but are not necessary for getting a good workout.

After the warmup, the one minute intervals begin.  A new move is introduced for each minute, meaning there is enough variety to avoid boredom.  The moves are pretty basic, so even though there is no demonstration for each move before it starts, after doing the workout a couple of times, the breif description given as it starts is enough to cue you in.  Now, I am not the most coordinated person, and most advanced cardio workouts generally involve complex choreography that I am unable to master.  That's what I love so much about this DVD - simple choreography!  I was able to do it pretty well by the third time I used it.  There are still a couple of moves that throw me off on bad days, but most of it is basic enough that I can follow along easily.

With that being said, let me stress, this is not an easy workout and defintely not for beginners!  The first time I attempted this workout was when my Fat Burning for Dummies no longer caused my heart rate to elevate, much less break a sweat.  I thought I could tackle an advanced workout, but I was unable to finish even one segment of this DVD.  Still, I stuck with it, and after several months of use I can now get through all three cardio sections, although I do modify it by not using a step.  It gets my heartrate up, and I sweat like a pig!  At some point, I suppose it will get easier.  When that happens, I'll start using the step.

The instructor, Anni Mairs, is a very no nonsense type of person, but pleasant and very encouraging.",1332374400,3,1870,4.371014492753623
