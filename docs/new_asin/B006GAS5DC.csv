8497461,5,B006GAS5DC,Great video with systematic approach so I never have to remember how to do a dovetail if it's been awhile.  It's very straightforward process with Chuck's video,1385164800,,160,4.925925925925926
8497462,5,B006GAS5DC,"I am fortunate enough to live within driving distance of the Acanthus Workshop and will be taking my 2nd class this spring. At my first class we were introduced to hand cutting dovetails, the class being the first time I had attempted them. By the end of the weekend I had cut several respectable joints. Within a month or so I was able to cut a  tight joint on a consistent level with a fair amount of practice. Now a year later my dovetails are very consistent with a mistake being much more uncommon than a tight, nice looking joint.
I purchased to video as a refresher and wasn't dissappointed. It starts with some very nice tips on sharpening and tool selection and soon goes into the dovetailing process. The process is deceptively simple and the instructor makes it look easy(as he should, he is one of the best).The whole process is broken down into easy steps and they do work, with practice. After watching the video I found my dovetails even tighter and looking better than ever.
Chuck Bender then goes into half-blind dovetails and also several helpful tips at the end. Again, if you follow the steps and practice them your joints will be good. The video is presented in a no nonsense yet easy going manner and it works quite well. I have seen quite a few instructional videos claim to be as good an ""in person"" class. This is one of the few videos that makes good on the claim.
If you are attempting hand cut dovetails, in particular for the first time, I can't think of a better way to get started, other than taking a class at the Acanthus Workshop. Highly recommended.",1326931200,,1584,4.5
