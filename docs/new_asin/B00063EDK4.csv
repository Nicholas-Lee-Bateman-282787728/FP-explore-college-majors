2163703,5,B00063EDK4,My 3 yr. old watches this video with the same level of excitement as the first time he saw it!  It covers all the fun things about being a cowboy in an entertaining way.,1230508800,2,169,3.9705882352941178
2163704,5,B00063EDK4,"This is a wonderful positive account of being a cowboy and riding along with a spirit of love for animals.  The young boy who narrates it is sweet and charming and the music is very good.  We enjoyed it immensely and keep playing it again and again, my 3 year old son who adores horses and cowboys and my 57 year old husband and myself (43 yo female).  It is great family entertainment and education about life with horses and cowboys.",1104105600,15,435,4.345679012345679

8037835,4,B00063EDK4,"Fun to watch and interesting just like Part Two, which we also recommend. I can't really put my finger on why 4 stars instead of 5, except that perhaps some aspects were a bit corny. That said, it is entertaining and educational, and we are glad we purchased.",1402185600,2,259,4.416666666666667
8037836,5,B00063EDK4,We checked this out of our local library to start with.  Our son enjoyed it so much we had to get it.  Lots of good information well made and enjoyable.  The narration is by a young cowboy so as a young person our son relates very well.,1382918400,,236,3.978723404255319
8037837,5,B00063EDK4,"Our 4 year old son loves playing cowboy!  He has watched this every day since we bought this and loves acting out what he sees.  He puts on his cowboy hat, boots and grabs his lasso and tries to do the rope tricks and also uses one of my real saddles thrown over a bar stool to do the horse tricks.  He LOVES this so much, that days after buying it, we bought the 2nd dvd too.  This is a great dvd!",1317340800,4,398,3.817073170731707
8037838,5,B00063EDK4,"I purchased this after previewing with a Netflix DVD to make sure it would be appropriate for my 3 year old grandson who just loves cowboys. He liked All About Cowboys so much that I just had to have it to keep. The music is very catchy. My grandson picked up the words quickly and sings along. No guns used, that's what I wanted! Characters are kids and act very naturally with their horses. We've watched this at least 50 times and it's still fun to see. I decided not to buy Part 2 because of the guns and shooting.",1297900800,,518,4.19
8037839,5,B00063EDK4,"My nephew, Declan, loves these videos (part one and part two).  He just asked me yesterday if there was a All About Cowboys Part Three!  He has loved cowboys and horses for two years and still is excited for these videos. If you have a little boy or girl who loves cowboys or shows an interest in them, these videos will be a great for birthday, Christmas, or anytime.  Great value, too.",1284249600,,387,4.347222222222222
8037840,5,B00063EDK4,"This movie has lots of songs, facts about the wild west and cowboys, lots of horses and cows and of course cowboys and cowgirls! My 3 year old is very into cowboys and my 19month old doesn't really care about cowboys but loves horses, they were both pleased and were jumping and dancing around the living room the whole time this video was on. This is definitely one of the better movies for kids about cowboys.",1274313600,,411,4.421052631578948
