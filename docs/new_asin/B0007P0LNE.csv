I am not a big opera fan, but i've heard CR on cd many times and i liked the music so much that a needed to SEE it since i don't speak any italian and can understand the words. I really liked the setting in the village and the filming out in the fields. You get better imression of the settings and the story.

I recomend this dvd very much!",1125014400,10,391,3.8271604938271606
2228154,4,B0007P0LNE,Enjoyed the film of these two operas very much.  The sets were very realistic and the principals and chorus all did a wonderful job with this beautiful and challenging music.  I give it 4 stars because of the poor quality of the 1982 film.  I am spoiled by today's High Definition film.  Placido Domingo was especially good in each of the opera's lead roles.,1473206400,,358,4.546875

2228157,4,B0007P0LNE,"Loved the operas.  The video of Cav was only ok.  The setting was  filmed outside, not on stage, and that affected the presentation a lot.  Additionally, the format of the DVD was not 16:9 but 4:3.  That disappointed me a bit.  Pagliacci was much better.  Thoroughly enjoyed it.  The music was exceptional as was the acting.  I would recommend this DVD for the music and overall quality of the film but would have preferred a staged setting.  I would suggest that you look at a DVD from the Metropolitan and try to preview/compare them both.",1430611200,,541,4.6
2228158,5,B0007P0LNE,"I saw the content of this DVD many decades ago as part of the PBS Great Performances series. I was resigned to the fact that these performances were gone forever along with the financial support that made them possible. It is a delight to see that some of them are slowly being released on DVD. They never were available on tape. The conversion to high definition and DTS surround sound is a real bonus.

Anyone who has ever watched much opera knows the plot of Pagliacci. The story of lost love and jealousy followed by grief-crazed revenge is as old as Euripides. The idea of having these most tragic of events happen to a clown is a brilliant use of irony as a play turns into life. I have always thought Placido Domingo was the greatest tenor of the twentieth century, with the possible exception of Richard Tucker, and his rich, sonorous voice is at its peak here. Teresa Stratas as Nedda makes a perfect foil for Domingo with her high, clear soprano and fragile appearance.  Possibly because of the direction of Franco Zeffirelli the acting of the singers is first rate and completely believable. This is a welcome change from the usual stiff, perfunctory acting usually seen with even the best singers. This performance of Pagliacci will hit you directly in the gut, and you will feel it long after La commedia e finita.

Cavalleria Rusticana is often performed with Pagliacci since both operas are by Pietro Mascagni and are relatively short with similar story lines. Cavalleria Rusticana has some beautiful music and a fine, long aria for Domingo at the start. However, even with an outstanding cast including Domingo, Cavalleria Rusticana never reaches the heights of Pagliacci. It is probably better than  it seems when the two are performed back to back.

Anyone who has the slightest interest in Italian opera and appreciates Placido Domingo should grab this DVD now before it disappears again.",1425513600,4,1907,4.837423312883436

2228175,5,B0007P0LNE,"I bought this DVD for Pagliacci. Cavalleria Rusticana is the first feature, but it suffers from a lack of video quality, but since I have never cared for Cavalleria Rusticana, I really did not mind. Pagliacci however is much higher quality, and easily the best performance I have ever seen. Domingo is the main performer, but to me Juan Pons steals the show. Teresa Stratas is simply first rate, and brings a multifaceted persona to Nedda. The multichannel sound is excellent with a lot of punch. This performance also delightfully restores Leoncavallo's original ending with Taddeo saying the famous ending line ""La Commedia  finita!"" instead of the ""honor"" going to Canio, The original ending has always worked better for me. If you want Pagliacci, this is the one to get. If you mainly want Cavalleria Rusticana, look for another recording since it does suffer from an unusual graininess.",1388361600,2,891,5.02027027027027
2228176,3,B0007P0LNE,I bought it for the only reason that Placido Domingo is the famous tenor but to tell the truth it isn't my favourit opera.,1387238400,,122,4.125
2228177,5,B0007P0LNE,"As for Cav:
 Cav has never been one of my favorite operas, because, on the traditional stage, you cant obtain the true flavor, sense and religious pageantry of a small, very Catholic, very religious, very parochial, Italian, peasant town, at the end of the 1800s.

 Some operas suffer, when taken outside the confines of an indoor stage. Others bloom. Cavalleria Rusticana is in the latter category.

 This is an old (late 1970s/early 1980s) rendition/recording, transferred to DVD, with Domingo as a very young man, still approaching his prime.

 The video suffers, from some fading and the audio is not up to todays standards. However, having said that, the quality of the singing and staging are magnificent. The acoustics of all that masonry, in a real, old, Italian villages plaza make create a sound which could never be achieved, on any stage. The extras are, obviously, real residents of that village or the surrounding areas.

 Obraztsova is outstanding, as Santuzza, in voice and appearance. Each of the singers looks like they belong in the small village.

 This is a definite keeper.

As for Pagliacci:
 This is not an easy opera to make believable or to perform and this is an old recording, with the inherent limitations of older A/V technology.

 Normally, since Im a traditionalist, I don't like seeing operas with changed venues or chronologies. In this case, it works to the advantage of the opera.

 In the main, we have a story within a story, each of which is, essentially, identical: a cruel, sometimes violent but deeply loving, husband, with an unhappy/unfaithful wife, on stage and in real life.

 There is only one consequential aria of note, in this opera and thats Canios/Pagliaccios lament of despair and woe, which, in this rendition is sung, excellently, by Domingo.

 The rest of the singing, while well performed, just doesnt have the reach or depth of drama of Canios/Pagliaccios broken heart.

 The first time I heard this opera sung, it was by Caruso. Afer that, I heard the Tito Gobbi rendition. I no longer have those old, 78rpm, vinyl recordings; so, I cant compare them but memory says the quality of the voices of Domingo, Gobbi and Caruso were very similar and each knew how to properly tug the heartstrings, to make that aria blossom.

 Another keeper.",1386806400,3,2295,4.9140625
2228178,5,B0007P0LNE,"I played and really enjoyed PAGLIACCI and CAVALLERIA RUSTICANA, and you can't do better than Placido Domingo as the anti-hero in both of these operas.",1385164800,,150,5.04
2228179,5,B0007P0LNE,These are the two most popular and most beautiful short operas ever written.  And these film productions of them starring the incredible dramatic tenor Placido Domingo are the best ever.  Maybe some great opera singer-actor has done it as well on stage somewhere in the past.

2228182,5,B0007P0LNE,"I first saw this ""Pagliacci"" played in a music appreciation class at community college. I was already familiar with the music, but seeing it come so vibrantly alive made it even better. It compelled me in all the ways a great opera ought to, and watching this production was a big reason for my further investigations into opera.

Domingo may seem a bit overwrought to the uninitiated, but I think it perfectly suits the hot-blooded nature of Canio. By the ending, his presence is downright terrifying, which is just as it should be. Stratas does a vocally fabulous ""Stridono Lassu"" and it pairs well with her sparkling face and spritely movements. This Nedda has a way of twitching around and playing coy at the same time when she is near Canio, and it's an interesting take on tense spousal situations. Pons is a strong supporting presence and was in as equally good vocal form as the other principles. Rinaldi should not be overlooked because he, too, vocally enriches this production. This opera is still captivating on multiple viewings and should be a must-see staple of opera DVD collections.

The ""Cavelleria"" was nice, but I have always enjoyed ""Pagliacci"" more. Domingo's singing is capable, but like another reviewer said, the detail of the on-location scenes did distract quite a lot from the music, as if the production was trying too hard to be a regular drama film instead of an opera. I don't have any real complaints about it, but I definitely bought this DVD for the ""Pagliacci."" Having said that, it's nice to know that I also now have a ""Cavalleria"" at the ready should the urge come to hear/watch it.",1372118400,,1621,4.765124555160142
2228183,5,B0007P0LNE,As I have said before I love classic music especially operas. These two operas are often presented together because they are short but full of incredibly beautiful music especially Cavalleria Rusticana.

2228194,5,B0007P0LNE,"First the disclaimer, I'm not expert.
I will beg pardon of other reviewers. Both movies are great and the pairing is perfect, but that is not controversial, as those two short operas have been going toguether forever. In my opinion the singing in ""Cavalleria"" is superior to the singing in ""Pagliaci"". This of course is not a filmed stage. ""Cavalleria"" is a masterpiece of cinema, frame after frame of stunning photography. Of course it is Placido Domingo, so everything is great, I see myself watching it several times.",1356912000,,520,4.920454545454546

2228197,5,B0007P0LNE,What a treat to have these 2 short operas on one disk and how appropriate. I had never seen these operas and in fact did not know the subject matter. These are like brilliant short stories. Domingo and Stratas when young --- how perfect. The amount of jealous passion in Domingo is worthy of an Oscar (yes he was scary!!) and my what a voice....perhaps better than Caruso. And Stratas --- absolutely adorable with a heavenly voice. I absolutely love opera movies.,1298937600,4,463,4.658536585365853
2228198,5,B0007P0LNE,"I have always been fascinated by the beautiful aria, 'Vesti La Giubba' from this opera since the last thirty five years. But today, I heard the complete opera for the first time on the DVD video of Deutsche Grammophon Gessellschaft. It is a combination coupling disc with Mascagni's Cavalleria Rusticana. The singing is superb from Placido Domingo and Teresa Stratas with the Orchestra e Coro del Teatro Alla Scala, Milan under Georges Pretre. This is a 1981 Unitel performance. Superb. The opera has been filmed by none other than Franco Zeffirelli who made masterpieces like 'Jesus of Nazareth' and 'Romeo and Juliet'. He filmed the opera in an empty theatre creating a vision that maintains the sense of a stage seen from an auditorium.
If you are hearing an opera for the first time and you like a tragedy  with a love triangle, then this is a perfect opera for you and a very good performance too on this disc. This is an opera consisting of a prologue and two acts written by Ruggero Leoncavallo. This opera remains one of the most popular works in the operatic repertoire.",1275523200,,1079,4.73936170212766
2228199,5,B0007P0LNE,"A first rank actress in her own right, Teresa Stratas has a voice that seems too good to be true.  I am still shaking my head after watching, once again, the pathetic and horrendous sounds coming from the mouths of those chosen to sing America the Beautiful and the Star Spangled Banner at this year's Super Bowl.  If by some miracle, a voice such as Stratas's could be let loose on the world in such a venue... oh well, thank God for this and other DVD's featuring this wonderful musical gift.  This added with her Der Zarewitsch, La Boheme and  Salome are a must for serious connoisseurs of coloratura sopranos. BTW, Placido Domingo is superb as always.  This is a great buy!",1265673600,2,677,4.516393442622951
2228200,5,B0007P0LNE,"Leoncavallo and Mascagni did not leave as many operatic works as did Puccini. Even so, their two works included in this DVD are so profoundly beautiful and moving that one tends to forget Puccini, or at least, leave Puccini behind for a good while as being melodramatic.
Both I Pagliacci and Cavaliar Rusticana are representative of the life style of Italy in that era. Nothing is more bound to evoke pathos in the viewers/listeners than music and scenary that are so idiomatic, and yet so universally affecting.
The story plots are not complicated, but very much in the real live. The social ethics of filial piety, fidelity, honour...that runs true in every civilised society ring out so eloquently and with such astounding power in these works that they leave the viewers truly in awe.
As for the performances, it could not really have been bettered.
Domingo was in his absolute prime in these two performances. In both, he was partnered with singers of the highest calibre, leaving absolutely no room for any sub-par performances that mar the works with any trace of unevenness.
Fedora Barbieri as the mother in Cavaliar Rusticana, though not having much to sing, commands an absolutely motherly figure with warmth and vulnerableness all in one. Obratsova was at her best in the role of Santuzza, nowhere an easy role to tackle.  Renato Bruson was also immaculate both vocally and dramatically as the husband of the culprit. The filming is absolutely stunning. Crowning all these is of course Placido Domingo's wonderful performance.
Domingo is never my favourite tenor for various reasons (I have other favourites, that's the main issue). But there is absolutely no denying that his portrayal of the 'prodigal son' is unrivalled.
He is similarly sublime in the other work by Leoncavallo - the famous I Pagliacci. Here, he is flanked by the equally unsurpassed Teresa Stratas as Nedda - the best Nedda ever, and most probably, forever. While at most points Strats stole the show from Domingo, she never upset the requisite balance of the score. Her Nedda is vulnerable, seductive, wild, tragic, and vocally, too, she delivered in totality the requirements of the role.
Again, stunningly beautiful filming, and wonderful direction by Zefirelli.
Classics. Absolute must haves.",1264550400,2,2278,5.090909090909091
2228201,5,B0007P0LNE,"The performance of both operas is superb. The critics raved in particular about ""I Pagliacci"", and there is no doubt Domingo and Stratus are magnificent. However, the acting and singing in Cavalleria Rustica, shot on location, is in a class all by itself. Never have I seen an opera with such great performances, and with such incredible presence. Zefferelli was a genius, and here it shows. There is unlikely to be anyone to match Zefferelli in staging of opera's, and this particular performance is unlikely to be equalled. Obtratsova's and Domingo's acting and singing are stupendous! If you buy this you'll not be disappointed! That's for sure!!",1260144000,6,649,5.074766355140187
2228202,5,B0007P0LNE,"Pure pleasure.  We watched Cav straight through twice in a row.  Couldn't resist it.  Ate it up, it was so lovely both musically and visually.  After watching it, we were going to revisit some specific scenes, but immediately were hooked back into re-watching the entire thing -- it was that compelling.

As much as I enjoy live opera, and I've seen this combo on stage a good handful of times, I kept thinking to myself how much fun Placido Domingo and the rest of the gang must have had, being able to play with the broader resources of film, outside of the limits of the stage.  Good, good acting -- Domingo proves himself to be a creative, expressive, and committed screen actor.  Beautiful, satisfying settings.  And wait 'til you see Teresa Stratas, the hottest Nedda you've ever been treated to.

This disc offers high-quality, compelling, involving entertainment.  High value.  Side note -- if you aren't familar with Zeffirelli's ""Taming of the Shrew"", and ""Romeo & Juliet"", particularly the first, then you have more treats in store.

This performance does justice to the hot-blooded score with magnificent singing by tenor, Placido Domingo and Teresa Stratas. Conductor Georges Pretre, not usually associated with this repertoire, yet, he squeezes every white-hot passion out of this smoldering score.

Now I only watch the second part of the dvd with I Pagliacci, because it is PHENOMENAL. I wish the staging would have been a little better (more believable when they are at their camp) but that blanches in comparison to the acting. Domingo is a little past his prime here, but his voice does not suffer. He plays this character with a brutal realism that makes you fear him but pity him at the same time. Of course, the famous aria ""Laugh, Clown"" is absolutely heart-wrenching and beautifully sung. I found myself just going back to listen/watch the aria for the emotions on Domingo's face. It's always nice to find great opera singers also be amazing actors and actresses, and Domingo does not disappoint.

2228221,4,B0007P0LNE,"Filming Cavalleria in Sicily where the action is supposed to take place is an asset. I do, however, have complaints about Zeffirelli's direction in the film's opening scene. The length of time devoted to Santuzza's spying on Turiddu as he visited Lola seemed more like stalking, and was unintentionally humorous because it was so ludicrous. The confrontation scene between Santuzza and Turiddu was staged in an uninteresting way. It seemed, to me, very static. Showing Turiddu's death is a plus. I found no fault with any of the singing. I give this presentation 3 stars. Pagliacci is a different story. The opera is staged realistically, making the action believable. Domingo's tormented Canio and Stratas' Nedda, trapped in a loveless marriage, touched me deeply. Pons', Tonio, was malevolent and well sung, as  were all the other characters.

This makes more difficult to enjoy the opera experience. But for this DVD gave me the joy of a live opera. I loved every second of these two works. Both are tragic tales of jealousy. In Pag, Domingo and Stratas portray their respective characters vividly and convincingly. Pag is a better written opera than Cav, but Cav is the one I'd watch repetitively many times with great enjoyment. The duet of Turiddu and Santuzza is so powerful and haunting. Many tenors tend to play Turiddu just angry and nasty when they sing the duet. But here Doming gives a nuance to the role by playing angry, yet exasperated and troubled. Plus, Obraztsova does a great job portraying jealous, miserable, and angry Santuzza. You just can't help but have compassion on her. Despite the fact that the picture is a little grainy, this DVD is great. In short, in both operas, the casting and performances were outstanding.",1178323200,24,1074,4.9010989010989015
2228223,3,B0007P0LNE,"I give this DVD three stars.  The Pag is brilliant, the Cav much less so.  A big part of the problem with Cav for me is that it is a much inferior opera in my view, but I was not much impressed with this particular production either.  On location shots in Sicily are nice, but they actually take me out of the opera.  Bruson looks right for the part, but it's a dull part.  Domingo looks like a lounge lizard--where were the gold chains (granted Turiddu is a drip)?  His ear-biting scene was not dramatically compelling at all, nor was the knife fight.  Domingo is far too much the gent, no matter how hard he tries to be sleazy.  And poor Santa wandering around in black and falling to the ground gets very tiresome. The grainy film makes it look like it came from the 1920s.  This one had me yawning all the way through.

Fortunately PAG makes it all worth it.  The staging is wonderful, more realistic looking than many operas, but still not taking us out of the fact that this is the world of an opera.  Domingo is alternately saddening and frightening--it's a great performance, particularly in his famous aria.  Stratas is unbelievably sexy as well as sympathetic. Pons is very strong too.  This one will have you at the edge of your seats.  Doesn't hurt that it's a better opera of course!  Too bad Pag doesn't get paired up more often with Il Tabarro, a superior opera to Cav.",1172707200,28,1384,4.41106719367589
2228244,4,B0007P0LNE,"This is a strange combination of short works fated to live together on the operatic stages of the world: one brilliant piece and one hardly above the level of a talented student.  Having known these works for better than a half century, I find that ""Cav"" sounds worse to me as time passes.  ""Pag"" is a brilliant piece of music theater and sounds better all the time.  The irony is that neither composer produced anything else of lasting value after these works.  Zeffirelli is a great director and film maker and the casts are excellent in all ways.  My problem is that I don't like to see films of opera.  I like to see the physical effort it takes to sing because that's where you see the real skill of the singers.  You can also truly see how the composer, with his sense of musical pacing, understood the theater. The faults of ""Cav"" can be masked by interesting camera work...in fact the first 15 minutes of this short work has virtually nothing contributing to the drama.  And before the final scene the composer throws in a sweet meditation which dilutes whatever tension he created in the previous scene.  One wonders if ""Cav"" would have held the stage as long as it has without ""Pag"" to lean upon.  The second half of the DVD is more impressive since the tension never lets up in Leoncavallo's work. ""Pag"" also features the ultra charismatic singing actress Stratas and Domingo whose work simply never falls below a level of artistic merit which most singers cannot even approach.  Frankly the best ""Pag"" I ever saw was a live broadcast from the Metropolitan also featuring Stratas and Domingo.  During the final scene Domingo took a fall and injured his leg causing cancellation of several subsequent performances.  Now that was an electric night!  I do not feel that this film, with all its dramatic touches, is up to that broadcast, But it appears to be the best that's currently available.  I am aware than many people love ""Cav"" but I know I will only watch the second half of this DVD.",1168387200,20,2000,4.610169491525424
2228245,5,B0007P0LNE,"Here are two classic operas with the 'bad relationship gone even worse' genre. For those of us who struggle to decide which of the many productions of these  well known and well loved operas to own...this one happens to be at the top of the heap. These two operas almost define what opera is, and thus are ""required"" in any self respecting opera collection.

Add to that, the simple fact that a lot of other reviewers here seem to agree. I personally like the 'filmed on location ' style of opera production. Both Franco Zeferrelli and Jean-Pierre Ponnelle are known for this - Ponnelle seeming to have the edge ; but that may be a toss up, actually.

Each of these combine elements of stage and exterior filming. Each of them feature Placido Domingo, and it becomes readily apparent why he is considered the finest tenor or this generation past, owing to his acting ability and of course his singing.

I think the first opera aria I remember was the well loved ""Vesti la Giubba"" from Pagliacci. The story, if one did not know, is based upon a real event. Leoncavallo's father was a court judge who had a case brought before him regarding a certain a member of a travelling troubador group... (typically in clownish garb, and who make fun of ""uppity folk""). This certain member of the troupe murdered his paramour during a ""comedy"" performance in a fit of jealous rage...pretty much of a ""downer"", n'est ce pas?

In the other, Placido plays a good looking fellow in love with another man's wife.  He neglects his own wife in order to pursue this ill fated love afair. Naturally the clandestine affair turns ""unclandestine"", as every single affair ultimately does. Any and everyone who engages in one, without fail,  always thinks that it will remain ""secret""....it never does. And the rage that follows it's discovery is something we hear about on the news almost every day to this day. Understanding this helps us to understand why these two operas will continue to enjoy being produced over and over.

All that ugliness now understood, what about the music?...Ah! Here too, one will soon realize why these are timeless operas with no danger of ever being neglected.

It begs the question, however....""Are there no librettists and composers today who can write a musical that even comes close? Are there no more Donizettis? Bellinis, Rossinis, or Bizet and his incomparable ""Carmen""?

Placido also does a gorgeous piece of work in the 80's version of Carmen, and another must have on the opera DVD shelf. But one of the beautiful things about Carmen is that rather than driving us all batty with long recitatives...some parts of the story line are spoken ( French )...saving the songs, melodies, arias back for full effect..and man, what glorious melodies. Is there really no one today who can compose music with voice and chorus?  Well...perhaps we should look at the hundreds of miles of townhouses, condos, and homes along the interstate, which all look identical, and are painted the same non descript grey....then it begins to sink in....this generation will be known as the lackluster, follow along with the swine as they head for the cliff by the sea at Geneseret.

This entire generation is good for little more than the fire...the flood, and the winds to carry away.....hmmm...sounds like a good theme for an opera.",1167004800,3,3325,4.824253075571177
2228246,5,B0007P0LNE,"Rarely is it more appropriate to put two works on the same DVD.
Pagliacci and Cavalleria Rusticana are two tales of the deadly results of jealousy.  In both of these, one spouse is manipulated into murdering the other spouse.

Both are not stage productions but instead are filmed by Franco Zeffirelli, in the incomparable style you would expect of him.  The ""Tuscan sunset glow"" and Italian countryside make this teatro verissmo even more real for us.

Placido Domingo (Canio) and Teresa Stratas (Nedda) give us an unforgettable pair of star-crossed lovers.  Their singing and acting are spectacular.  Besides what you would expect--that Placido's ""Vesti la giubba"" is gut-wrenchingly tearful, Zeffirelli has enhanced the production with insightful close-ups such as when Nedda is putting on her make-up, because ""the show must go on.""  It's a ghostly parallel to ""Vesti la giubba"" as she looks into her mirror, and sees a ghostly white reflection.

Please see this film.  Your spine will tingle even more than you already felt when you first heard Enrico Caruso sing ""Vesti la giubba.""  It's a scary yet beautiful, non-stop runaway ride towards disaster.",1160870400,66,1156,5.166666666666667

Zeffirelli brings his usual genius and flamboyance to the screen, adding another gem to his already impressive oeuvre.  Domingo, however, is the real treat.  Not only is he one of the best tenors alive, he can ACT!  I actually felt Canio's pain during ""Vesti la giubba.""  Right after viewing this movie, I watched Pavarotti and some other tenors sing the same aria, and there is no comparison.  Domingo IS Canio.  This is a must-buy, IMHO.",1153958400,8,513,4.761363636363637

What I most loved were Zeffirelli's wonderful landscapes, colors and settings that set off the singing. Placado Domingo, so familiar, just blends into his roles and his superb voice seems effortless. I found the young Stratas so sexy and vulnerable, Wow! ... and Obraztova solid and sour and pitiful, as called for. I could watch it again - that is what counts for me.",1151280000,32,492,4.732558139534884
2228249,4,B0007P0LNE,"I'd like to start by saying that 4 stars is an average rating, if I could rate them separately, I'd give 4 stars to Il Pagliacci and 3 stars to Cavalleria Rusticana.

Both productions were very good, with excellent singing, staging and filming.  The only thing I had a problem with was the woman playing Santuzza was a bit shrill and very overbearing.  She was crying out for direction I think.  And I blame Franco Zefferelli for not telling her to hold it in a bit until the No, No, Turridu scene.  For singers I'd also like to point out Lola from Cavalleria.  I thought she did a wonderful job.  She seemed sooo smug, just like she should.

As I'd said the singers were otherwise magnificent.

The filming and staging were great I love seeing operas which look like films.  I wish they did it for more of them (particularly the Ring Cycle which should be filled with computer graphics).  Il Pagliacci was updated to the thirties, but this too worked very well and the play within a play was quite inventively produced.  It is for the operas themselves that makes me really take away a star.  I'm not much of a fan of short opera.  In opera it takes a long time to get anywhere with the plot and when they are as short as these that just means there really isn't any plot and it's a shame that with music as great as the music in these that you don't really feel anything for the characters when you're through.  It's certainly not the ride of emotions you get from something like Tristan and Isolde.  But it's not just that they're short.  It's just that I feel that if they're short they need to spend less time singing songs and more time progressing the plot.  Strauss' Salome, for instance is short, but so much happens all the same that you really feel you met Salome, even if you don't have her completely understood.",1150588800,3,1825,4.413173652694611
2228250,5,B0007P0LNE,"Rigoletto and these 2 operas are to me the 3 most perfectly structured, compact little (Rigoletto's big) operas I have ever seen.  They remind me of Guys and Dolls for their artful precision.  In this rendition of these 2 operas, the music never sounded so beautiful.  Pagliacci is a brutal character study, well done and disturbing as hell.  Little details apt to be overlooked in a stage production (or else invented for the movie) add to the grim reality of the story.  Cavaleria wasn't so brutal, but (true verismo) was grim nonetheless.  I preferred Cavaleria, but loved them both.  They were directed to a gnat's whisker, acted to a fare thee well (unusual though unnecessary for an opera, I think) and I loved them both.  Even the chorus members did good jobs acting.  I dislike being told what to do, so I won't say buy or watch it.  But I for one was enchanted with this DVD.  Pagliacci was more a stage show with one set, necessitated by the strictures of the plot.  Cavaleria was a whole sung movie with lots of beautiful sets and scenery.  Zeffirelli outdid himself.  Only one flaw.  The picture was poor and grainy.  It was worth it",1138838400,21,1145,4.594059405940594
2228251,4,B0007P0LNE,"To me the fact of being a movie instead of a stage production is a handicap and not and advantage, mainly because you miss the tension of singing in front of public.

It is true that Domingo sings fantasticly in both operas,with a beautiful timbre and with pathos, and his acting is really a master class. Obraztsova has a powerful instrument, does sing with passion and acts as the best of actresses, but her heigth and volume are not adecuate for the role. The fact that she is a mezzo and not a soprano is an advantage because this tessitura can give much better the colour required for the role. I cannot forget the ""stupenda"" Fiorenza Cossotto singing the role in the Metropolitan with the also unforgetable Carlo Bergonzi. As a matter of fact, the Met could rescue that presentation and making so a great gift to this opera (Cavalleria) fondees in a DVD edition. Stratas acts exquisitely the it role of Nedda and sings very well too. It is touching to have oncemore the opportunity to see the great Fedora Barbieri. The baritones are magnificent, Pons in Tonio's role and Bruson in Alfio's. I would like to emphasise the extrordinary singing and acting of Bruson, that gives a memorable confrontation with Domingo's Turiddu. Conducting of Pretre is quite solid and orchestra and chorus do respond at a high level. I only do not give 5 stars, because I missed the afore mentioned stress of stage presentations.",1133222400,11,1415,4.728744939271255
2228252,5,B0007P0LNE,"On this unsurpassed 1982 film version of Mascagni's Cavelleria Rusticana and Leoncavallo's Pagliacci, Italian film director Franco Zefferelli whisks away to turn of the century Italy and brings the verisimo opera to breathtaking reality through the art of cinema. Placido Domingo appears in both films- as Turiddu in Cavelleria and as Canio the clown in Pagliacci. He is in terrific vocal shape and his acting is right-on-target as both men, in two entirely different portrayals. Domingo outshone all the tenors of his time, proving time and again how he was the true heir to Enrico Caruso's legacy. Here, we get to see his excellent verisimo style and it helps that he is handsome and that his surroundings are real and not an operatic stage. Both films were filmed in the Italian countryside, locales familiar to the native Italian Zefferelli. The Russian mezzo Elena Obrazstsova is Santuzza, and hers is a stunningly dramatic and moving performance. She is an older, mature Santuzza, middle-aged when compared to the elderly Mamma, and her mezzo voice is dark, deep and anguished. She can hit the high notes without difficulty and without annying vibrato. I don't favor a mezzo soprano in the role of Santuzza. If I had it my way, Santuzza should always be sung by a lyrico-spinto soprano, whose angelic voice would make her situation as the betrayed wife is even more touching. Obraztsova is not an attractive woman. She's big and her dramatic, big, almost manly voice does nothing to inspire pathos. I would prefer that the role of Lola (sung by soprano Alexe Galle in this film) be sung by a mezzo, for mezzos have traditionally enjoyed the reputation as the temptress. Lola (the perfect name for a woman who cheats on her own husband with another married man) is played very well by Galle and sung well. In the role of Mamma is veteran soprano Fedora Barbieri, with supreme vocal tone. Even if she is the stereotypical Italian mamma, I love her performance. The setting is an authentic Italian country village, and local color is everywhere, from the clothing, homes and even the Church scenes and Easter procession. A very cinematically dramatic moment comes at the end when a woman runs screaming ""They've killed Turrido!"" The betrayed husband Alfio is sung superbly by baritone Renato Bruson. As for Pagliacci, this is yet another superb film. The Prologue is well-sung, by a bass who connects with the audience in a direct way and who recounts the tragic tale of Canio. Domingo's Canio is by far the most realistic interpretation. His acting has never been greater than in this role. His Nedda is sung by the brilliant Canadian soprano Teresa Stratas, who at this time was also singing Traviata opposite Domingo in another Zefferelli film. Stratas' Nedda is exquisitely sung, with dramatic outbursts in the appropriate places and pathos in others. It is she who cheats in this opera, but we seem to understand why she would do such a thing. Silvio, her lover, is another moving performance. The Tonio of Juan Pons is appropriately lusty and nasty. The excessive make-up everyone has, the carnival atmosphere of the traveling circus is dizzying. During the final moments, when Canio kills Nedda on stage, we are indeed shocked to find out it was not staged but real! It is however, Domingo and Stratas' performances that move us. Cinematically, this Pagliacci is a lesser light than Cavalleria, but it's still breathtaking. I enjoyed such moments as when Nedda is singing to the group of children. These films are supreme works of cinema and Zefferelli found his niche adapting grand operas into film. Unfortunately, not all the operas he had dreamed of making into movies were realized. He had hoped to film Puccini's Tosca starring Maria Callas but that was never actualized. He never filmed Tosca, though he easily could have done so in Rome. It would have been terrific. He never made a movie version of Verdi's Aida as well, another favorite of his. Other than this Cav/Pag, he filmed La Traviata with Domingo and Stratas and Verdi's Otello with Domingo and Katia Ricciarelli.",1132185600,11,4091,4.939042089985486

- Individual performances by Domingo and Stratas are exceptional in Pagliacci. The three moments that stand out (the tent scene, Canio's aria, and the commedia) centrally stand on the strong acting of the lead characters. Incredible work captured on film.
- I enjoy the mixture of theatre sets and real locations; it's probably the best way to do an extended opera film concept rather than Ponnelle's search for all-real locations.
- In general, really well-sung performances in both productions, save some of the smaller roles in Pagliacci.

Less good aspects:
- Obraztsova is not particularly interesting as Santuzza, which was hurt by how the introduction was staged. She was routinely upstaged by the subtle and reserved Barbieri who pulled my attention during viewing.
- Chorus direction feels like a gimic rather than real people celebrating Easter or going to see a traveling show.  Feels like Zeffirelli demonstrating his mastery of crowd control rather than using the crowd to paint a clearer picture of complex village life.
