5311283,5,B009AVC9MC,"its a good show, i liked watching it, it also tries to portray the normal highschool environment to the fullest degree it can.",1379548800,,126,4.521739130434782
5311284,2,B009AVC9MC,"The back cover art makes it look like it shows panties a lot, but it's more for the plot. There's rarely any moments like that.

At least the artwork is good and the songs are okay. I'll be getting this later because I'm collecting animes that I've seen already, but this anime has a slow plot. The thing I like about it is that he actually chooses a girl officially at the end, showing that some animes have guys where the guy actually has a backbone and takes that next step instead of leading all the girls on until they all become sad.

Otherwise, this anime can only really be counted as ""okay"". I'd give it three stars, but I knocked it down one star because it's misleading. Don't buy this is you're looking for an ecchi-feast! You'll just feel starved.",1376524800,,760,4.382978723404255

5311286,5,B009AVC9MC,"I just finished watching this series a few nights ago, and I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it!

The title (which translates to 'Pure White Symphony: Love is pure white') centres around High School student Shingo Ury, who is kind and compassionate, and hates to see anyone hurting or left out, whose school, the co-ed Kagamidai Private Academy, in the fictional town of Kagamidai, is being forced (due to falling numbers) to merge with another local high school, the posh girls academy Yuihime Girls' Private Academy (which is also known by the nickname Yuijo). Shingo is chosen to be one of the 'test' class from Kagamidai, known as 2-T, whose task it is to see how the integration would work in real life. Needless to say, the girls of the Yuijo are not best pleased at having their all-girl world invaded by those disgusting creatures known as 'boys', and many, including the student body president Airi Sena, who hates all boys, are initially very much opposed. The other female characters are Sakuno Ury, Shingo's step-sister, who is cute, but has no sense of direction, and gets lost easily, even when just coming home from the shops! Then there is half-English 'stray-maid' Angelina Nanatsu Sewell, known to all as 'Ange', who dresses as a maid, and wants to be in service to a kind master (and of course, Shingo fits the bill nicely!); next is Miu Amaha, president of the Nuko Club, which looks after injured animals and returns them to the wild once recovered; she is cute and kind, and quickly begins to fall for Shingo too. Sana Inui, also from the Nuko Club, has a slightly more than healthy interest in Miu, and regularly batters Shingo for getting to close to her; she is insanely jealous of his growing affection for Miu, and does all she can to keep them apart. However, she eventually starts to feel differently about him, when he resolutely continues to be kind to her (and indeed all the others too) in spite of her best efforts to chase him off. The only other significant male character is Hayata Mukunashi, Shingo's friend and classmate; he is Kagamidai Academy's student council president too.

The story follows the girls growing affection for Shingo, and the daily shenanigans which go on in the school, and the various relationships that develop. Overall, it is a great story; heart-warming, affectionate, cute, funny, and even quite moving at times; it is a really good watch, and well worth the reasonable asking price. Picture and sound are fine, although Amazon have (yet again!) incorrectly marked the aspect ratio as 4:3; it is not, it is 16:9. There is also an 'extras' DVD included, which has various additional shorts, plus character songs, and a cute 15-minute piece in which a fully 3D-rendered version of Airi Sena (as opposed to the more normal 2D characters) talks to Shingo; that was really great!

I enjoyed this series more than a lot of other, more highly-regarded, animes I have seen lately; just get it - you won't be sorry! Highly recommended.",1367452800,,2994,4.809708737864078
5311287,5,B009AVC9MC,Exceeded my expectations and was exactly what I wanted.  Very satisfied with the product and shipped sooner than I expected.,1362787200,,124,5.2
5311288,5,B009AVC9MC,I absolutely loved this show the characters the story everything. Its a nice short anime although i must warn you the show has about 3-4 scences that may not be suitable for children. When i bought this i didn't expect it to be an ecchi show but to my surprise i was watching an episode and something happemed ( Fan Service ) . Thats one of the only drawbacks of the show but it doesn't hurt the story. Its minor fan service so it can easily be overlooked. So to sum everthing up its a really great show i highly recommend it.,1357948800,2,526,4.166666666666667
5311289,1,B009AVC9MC,"I've seen 8 episodes so far, and this series rarely ever even shows panties. They make it look like it does a lot, make it sound extra perverted, and make it sound like it takes a long time for the boys to be accepted, but it didn't. It starts out going in one direction, and then flips and changes to another girls for a long time. This ""flipping"" isn't a problem unless the anime is this short. I can barely classify this as an ecchi anime, and I am disappointed with it so far. I would buy this if it were twelve to fifteen dollars, but not for this price!",1357689600,2,559,4.090909090909091
5311290,5,B009AVC9MC,"When problems in a school district affects two schools, a plan is to put into action to integrate the Yuijio and Karabusa schools into one school.  However there is a small problem, Karbabusa is a co-ed school while Yuijio is an elite all girls school.  So to smooth things over a group of Karabusa students, both male and female, are send over to test the waters for integration.  However the girls of Yuijio are not exactly welcoming to the male portion of the group, especially the daughter of the director.  Shinjo and his sister are part of this group, and when he realizes that the fight will be hard, he starts to make friends with not only Airi (the daughter), but also the campus student maid, the man hater, and the third year president of the Neco Club (who help out hurt animals and releases them).  But as the year proceeds he not only helps integrate the student body, he does not realize that several girls will develop strong feelings for him .  Can he truly help make the plan work, and tell the girl he falls for how he feels for her (and survive the fall out that is sure to follow)?

This was an enjoyable series, it had everything you would expect from a romantic comedy, including love, a few real heart wrenching moments, and a lot of soul searching.  You will feel for those that fall for Shinjo, even if they did not realize at the time they had fallen for him.  While it is a TV-14 rating, this show does have a few short nude scenes and one kissing scene, but definately nothing adult.  In fact the nude moments add to the humor of the story.  The characters were well written and the story was amazing.  In short this is a must have for anyone.",1355270400,12,1672,4.375404530744337
5311291,5,B009AVC9MC,"Disregard the underwear art on the back or,if you got the other cover with a girl starting to hoist her skirt,be advised,this series has none of that;the cover and the large figures on the back of the case do not exist in that pose. There are three explicit nude scences,two involve the quirky sister. This series is not an ecchi/panty fest. In fact,I don't recall any panties except one of about two frames in length. This series is so delightful that any more ecchi/panties would probably sour it.
When the initial cadre' of boys arrive on the hereto all-girl academy,there are as many different reactions to them as there are girls,most of these girls simply have not been closley associated with members of the opposite sex that are also in thier same age group.
How or if they overcome the tensions of changes in thier comfort zones is what this series is about and it is one of the best drawn,acted and colorful series you are likely to find anywhere.
It is not a harem situation but serious relationships are formed and more than one heart is broken. This is such a delightful and touching series that the two short,and completley misguided scenes when the 16-year-old sister suddenly wants to take a bath with the 17 year-old brother are so far out of the plot that one has to wonder what someone was thinking putting that nonsense in. He wants no part of it and the whole scene is so far out of the character of the series as to be a possible distraction but,if you must be distracted,little sister ain't so little anymore. Just be aware of the suddeness of this bizare and out of step behavior so you will not be so distracted from the beauty of the rest of the series.
There is real heartbreak for one of the girls and it is so painful that you really have sympathy for her.
The highest of recommendations.",1352332800,5,1817,4.525835866261398

8538860,4,B009AVC9MC,"Very good series. Is a little boring at times but overall gives new definition to the harem genre. Also, this version is uncensored. I watched the series 3 times censored on Crunchyroll, so it being uncensored here makes it much better and definitely worth the buy, seeing how cheap it is. Definitely check this series out.",1441584000,,323,4.785714285714286

8538862,5,B009AVC9MC,"I watched this on Hulu & I have to say that it's the best harem style anime that I've seen in a long time. Probably ever. The story is about an all girls school that gets integrated with boys, at first the girls hate the idea & really dislike the boys but as the story go's on, they learn to like their new male counterparts. The story mainly revolves around one boy in particular, his sister & 4 other girls who are all part of an activity club that takes in stranded and abandoned animals, nurses them back to health and then releases them into the wild. As the story progresses, each of the girls, excluding his sister, develop feelings for our main male protagonist. That's all ill say about that. What separates this anime from the majority of harem style animes like it is the maturity of the characters. If you've seen enough animes of this kind then you know the male protagonist is usually either cocky & overly perverted, or he's clumsy & stupid filled with scenes of him tripping & falling on girls ending up in sexual positions & groping their breast. Hen they always have to have some other male friend who's bisexual or straight gay, I get so tired of seeing that over & over again. These characters in this series are real & full of emotion. This was the first anime that I could've cried a few of the scenes as they were pretty heartbreaking. Whoever the writer for this series was, he or she or they did an awesome job. I highly recommend this series if your tired of the same lame storyline & fan service that is crowded in most harems, check this one out. You will not be disappointed. It does have a mature rating for a few scenes of nudity but its really nothing serious...",1423958400,,1694,4.380952380952381
