7607878,5,B01APQ3IKC,The first sections will be enjoyed by any astronomy buff.  The last two sections are relevant for anybody who has an interest in the Big Bang theory's implications and relevance.  Spike's logic is going to be hard to refute.  Especially as he extensively quotes Big Bang proponents from their own literature and peer-reviewed journals.,1454976000,4,335,5.166666666666667

8747994,5,B01APQ3IKC,"Exceptionally well done. Gives the information the public never hears. I used to think that scientists were the most objective group of people. Over the years I have learned the opposite. I have determined they are ideologically biased, protecting their grant money, or just afraid to go against the accepted standard model and dogma.
This movie gives information you will not hear anywhere else.",1501372800,,396,5.203125
