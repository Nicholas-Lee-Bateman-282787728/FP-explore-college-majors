Here you will find some of the greatest musicians of all time performing together.  Where else would you find Paul McCartney, Eric Clapton, The Who, Elton John, Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, James Taylor, and so many other founding fathers of rock n' roll, all in one concert?  Just look at the bill and you will see why it is one of the greatest concerts ever performed.  Having it on DVD is a way to experience it all over again.",1013990400,2,540,4.37
1669359,5,B00005V1YF,"Amazing - forget about the fact that they edited out the boos for Hillary.  I think everyone knows she was booed - point taken.  Set it on ""play musical performances only,"" sit back, and enjoy a once in a lifetime concert.",1012780800,4,222,4.390243902439025
1669360,4,B00005V1YF,"This is a powerful DVD - it preserves a well a monumental evening in music history and in the history of New York City. It helps with healing from the attack on the city. It is a chance to laugh with Billy Chrystal, to celebrate the city's ""personality"" as seen in the 5 short films by 5 of our most talented residents, and to hear some great music by the WHO, the Rolling Stones, and others.
One black mark -- I was troubled that the boos that accompanied Senator Clinton were edited out, as much as I was troubled by the boos themselves, that night. There was no place that evening for such behaviour and I was jarred and saddened by that display. But, censorship is not for New York, either.
All in all, this DVD is a keeper. It is something to savor and treasure, especially for those who know and love this city, even if it reminds us of the reason for the concert and for the outpouring of all these good feelings for New York.",1012780800,6,933,4.247191011235955
1669361,5,B00005V1YF,"...Even though the DVD menu gives one the choice of just viewing the
musical performances, one should first watch the entire 2 discs.
To pass up the movie shorts by Martin Scorsese, Spike Lee and
Woody Allen would be just as bad as clicking past a group or song
that's not your cup of tea or not watching Meg Ryan with a tearful
family, who lost their hero, introduce The Back Street Boys.
One can only imagine what the worried parents of the 60's & 70's teens thought their kids would turn out to be listening to The Who and similar groups.
Well now they(and we)know they are the proud parents of the Hereos in the audience mouthing the words to ""Who Are You"".
With all the canned shows on the tube one can get a high watching
real talent as they performed live. Great production, both visually and sound wise(Dolby Digital 5.1). While not perfect, it is worth five stars plus considering the little time the production crews and performers had to rehearse.",1012694400,3,958,4.511494252873563
1669362,5,B00005V1YF,"I preordered my dvd in early january, i was not fortunate enough to see this event live. Why buy this? You could cop out and only say: Mc Cartney, jagger,keif, elton john, james taylor etc. etc..  You could buy this to feel the emotions of the firefighters and police who lost so many. Listen to politicians who represent the emotion that we felt at the time. Not fighting for a partisan but for the people. Toss in a few entertainers who can make us laugh and cry. Still you have not gotten to the point of why to buy.  This may be the most powerful dvd you can ever buy. You cannot watch washington cross the delaware or see lincoln give the gettysburg address. We have watched the towers be struck and tumble again and again. This concert is the beginning of the healing. We cry with our great servicemen and women We sing along to the songs that we have grown up with. We cannot, will not forget sept. 11th and if only one penny from each item purchased goes to help someone who lost a loved one. Then it is a penny well spent. GOD BLESS AMERICA and may god bless new york city.  Thank you for a great piece of history and an even better night of entertainment",1012262400,29,1164,4.257918552036199
1669363,1,B00005V1YF,"I watched this whole lousy show and the greatest part of the whole thing, reason enough to buy it, (and as a New Yorker who doesn't like Carpet baggers with husbands who cheat on their wives, I was actually looking forward to getting this DVD just to have the true NY feelings about the ""queen"" available to show my friends) was ALTERED.
What did the people who protect this woman from the truth do? ......they altered the history like they wanted to alter the Fire Fighter monument....hello 1984.
If for no other reason than this disservice to American history and freedom of speech, I would never buy this DVD or recommend it to anyone.
If you can't reproduce what happened, change the name to the censored concert for NY City, because this DVD is an insult to the Fire Fighters and Police men who's boos represented the larger portion of the audience that night.",1012176000,27,865,4.623376623376624
1669364,4,B00005V1YF,"This concert exemplified the magic of music as the background for Americans coming together to grieve collectively. Watching this concert will show you raw emotional energy rarely seen on television. It is a sad concert and there are many times where you can see individual instances of personal grief among the music of many different superstars. It is a long concert and well worth a viewing. Among other things, I thought Paul McCartney was cheesy and his song ""Freedom"" was a situation where you had an amazing song writer reacting to bad circumstances but with poor results. The Who in my opinion, stole the show and then some, they were amazing as always. I don't think Jay-Z was placed at the right time when he came out. Billy Joel was everything New York as he always has been.
  The ultimate point for you, is that you should own this DVD as it is a recorded reminder of music's response to an American tragedy with an audience showing us the rawest and most powerful of human emotions out for the world to see. Some may say it was convenient for superstars to show up and act really concerned and to use their fame as a pulpit to try and relate to everyday people; however, those people are uptight, why else do you go to concerts?, to be taken away from everyday routines and tragedies of life, so a concert of this magnitude after 9/11 was exactly what the country needed.",1012176000,13,1385,4.5582329317269075

In this case, the goal was reached. This concert is the last time THE WHO s' John Entwistle played in American soil...and what a performance the band and specially him, did. They simply rocked the house and took their music to the limit. The Who s' music became relevant one more time.

However,the concert itself it's uplifting and it's helped me deal with this immense tragedy. I watched the twin towers being built from my 16th fl apt and there was a great attachment,I'll never get over it. It's beautiful to see everyone pull together for the event,as we do in New York.

1669392,2,B00005V1YF,"While the music is first rate, the camera work is fine I find this nothing but a  political statement that cut a few things out not to show disapproval of said Senator's.

Obviously the editor/producer could not fit the entire six hours of performances on two dvds. However, they did a good job of capturing the essence of the show.",1361145600,,308,4.327586206896552
1669395,5,B00005V1YF,"It's quite amazing how absolutely spot-on every musical performance is here. There's usually a hit-and-miss element for spectators of such benefit shows because of the array of artists.  There is however not a single sour note in this concert.  Each artist chooses songs with strong personal meaning and performs them, often-times with beautiful rearrangement, with emotional intensity and authenticity.  That said, very little is over-wrought or sullen.  Make no mistake about it, this is no funeral.  Where America: A Tribute to Heroes, held ten days after the attack, was quiet and introspective, the Concert for New York City, held five weeks later, was raucous and celebratory.  Bowie's show opener is pitch perfect: an unaccompanied, reflective, and gentle rearrangement of Paul Simon's ""America"" followed by a steady and defiant ""Heroes,"" backed by Paul Shaffer and the very capable CBS Orchestra, and eliciting a quite palpable emotional response from the audience.  Destiny's Child, regaled in black evening gowns, sing a softly rearranged version of the Bee Gees' ""Emotion,"" then an unaccompanied medley of traditional gospel (""Walk With Me,"" ""Jesus Loves Me,"" ""Total Praise"").  Melissa Etheridge, by herself and armed only with a twelve string acoustic guitar, rouses an arena full of spectators with a gutsy ""Come To My Window"" and then brings the crowd to their feet with a fiery and unforgettable rendition of ""Born to Run.""  She puts it all on the line.  The Who's now legendary performance is empathic--transferring anger and resolve in the audience, encapsulating it, and channeling it musically, most especially with ""Won't Get Fooled Again.""  All who watch will find personal favorites.  The joy in the faces of the police-fire-rescue (PFR) and other folks in that arena on that evening says more about this concert than all the words on this webpage.  Nevertheless, there a few words on this site, by a police officer at the concert, that should be acknowledged.  He writes that PFR personnel at the show grew up on most of the music yet ""found new meaning"" in the lyrics.  And that the songs helped to create for him ""a new-found love for life.""  How often does one write something as powerful as that.  PFR personnel, family members, and supporters--each and every one of them--who appear between performances are outstanding.  Most celebrity speakers were fine as well.  Be warned though that a few celebrities were unfortunately thoughtless and even tasteless.  All had a difficult job to do though, so there is much room for forgiveness.  I would venture to guess that no-one watches this concert to relive the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks.  You watch it to enjoy the musicianship and the moment, and to re-experience--or experience for the first time--the national commiseration and emotional recovery in that aftermath.  For those worthy purposes, this concert is, in the words of another amazon reviewer, ""absolutely essential.""",1357776000,3,2957,5.231422505307855
1669396,5,B00005V1YF,"What a LEGENDARY concert, what a ROTTEN set of circumstances that led to its existence.

That said, I watched this on live TV when it happened. We were all still stunned, bruised but not broken...and we needed to blow out he hurt, anger, and frustration.

David Bowie's ""Heroes""...performed by a guy who lived blocks from ""Ground Zero""...is a career-best performance. If the sight of first responders in the front rows pumping their fists to this song doesn't break your heart, you might not have one.

That said...with all of the FINE performances in this show...the Who OWNED it.

The BEST Who shows required Pete Townshend to be fully present, fully engaged, and fully ****ed ff. You get all three here.

The Ox...John Entwistle...was still on board. Daltrey was in fine voice. And Zak Starkey took the Keith Moon thing and transformed it into something of his own.

They did a tight set of their power songs here...""Who Are You,"" ""Baba O'Riley,"" ""Behind Blue Eyes,"" and ""Won't Get Fooled Again."" Right before ""Fooled,"" Townshend cups the microphone, closes his eyes, and says ""Thank you...we are HONORED to be here."" He smiles and nods and there goes the windmill, SLAMMING into ""Fooled.""

Inspired and inspiring, exhilarating, absolutely essential.",1356652800,5,1253,5.053398058252427
1669397,5,B00005V1YF,"It's been eleven years since I saw this concert live on television so it was great to revisit it by getting the DVD.  Fortunately, there is also great option on the discs to play just the concert songs, so a lot of the emotional scenes which were appropriate for the time but hard to sit through now, are deleted.  David Bowie sets the scene with a great opening, hitting all the notes, but for mine, it was The Who that stole the show.  Absolutely outstanding.  Sad to say that their performance in the recent Sandy Relief concert compares rather badly so this DVD catches them in their prime, or at least not far past it!  Paul McCartney as usual ends the show in great style.  Great value and I'll be watching it again for sure.",1355616000,,731,4.377777777777778

As with any live concert event, some of the acts don't do their best.  I would have preferred to see Mick Jagger and Keith Richards do some more classic Stones hits (like Honky Tonk Woman, Brown Sugar, etc.) instead of ""Miss You"".  Likewise with some of the comedy sketches.  However, the performances from The Who, Billy Joel, David Bowie, James Taylor, and others redeem the whole event.  As for the negatives from some reviewers about the ""accuracy"" of how Hillary Clinton was welcomed by the crowd - the DVD is titled ""The Concert for New York City"", not ""The Historically Accurate Record of The Concert for New York City"".

1669419,5,B00005V1YF,"I will echo the praise of The WHO and the many other fine performances on this DVD set, as well as the missing pieces - U2, the Goo-Goo Dolls' ""Iris"", Clapton and McCartney deleted tunes.  And Jay-Zee was included in this show for the same reason Adam Ant was included in the Motown 25 show:  To get younger people to watch what was otherwise a pretty much classic Rock concert.  I was surprised by a couple of things.

Just before Mayor Rudy Giuliani is introduced by Michael J Fox and FDNY firefighter Michael Moran, Moran introduces himself as being from Rockaway Beach and tells Osama Bin Laden to ""Kiss my Irish ass!"" They left that part in, but cut out where he comes back a second later, takes his hat off and says ""And this is what I look like, BITCH!""  (The funniest part of which is Michael J Fox's reaction!)

Another thing that puzzled me is that during the original performance, Melissa Etheridge's microphone cut out for nearly half of ""Come to My Window.""  To her credit, she kept playing while the techs tried to fix it, but the amazing part is that the audience picked up the tune and sang it for her until the mike got fixed.  Somehow in the editing process they took out the part where her mike was off and subbed in audio to make up for it, leaving out one of the more poignant and spontaneous parts of the show!

Which is why I am still looking for my VHS version.  I hope I still have it!",1316131200,,1410,4.306818181818182

Every year we hold my daughter's birthday and two days later wade into the feelings of September 11th. I realized that this concert helps find a way through these personal moments. This year, ten years after, as she returns to Pasadena I'm left here alone watching the past, loving the music, saddened to understand the toll that 9-11 took, and still takes. I have to think harder about how tragedy robbed the present, filtered so much. My daughter dreads what happened to her birthday, but I like to think that a concert like this lifts a bit of the pain. She missed the best part so next year I'll order this as a present for her.
Totally off this DVD, last night I saw Paul McCartney in a documentary, ""The Love We Make"" about his part in this concert. It was remarkable, so I advise getting a hold of both these pieces. I'm going to.",1315699200,4,1071,4.441624365482234
1669421,5,B00005V1YF,"Unquestionably this is the best and longest Rock Video with so much meaning behind it.  If you never saw another rock video this would cover the entire era. From David Bowie, Adam Sandler (who I normally puke to,is incredible)to Elton John, to Eric Clapton with Buddy Guy and finally with the Who, this is the best you will ever see.  Most speakers boring (after you see once you will know which ones to click past) but when about 25 major athethes walk on stage one at a time and say the name of killed fireman (policeman too) it is heart wrenching. The music will blow you away.  If you are a hip hop fan I suggest you save your money. This is the best rock capturend live with every artist playing their heart out. The Who are mind bongling.

But, this concert was for all New York emergency response people and I give them all my gratitude and thanks for what they did and went through on 9/11.  And to them I have to say, ""Sorry for this concert.""  I saw that many heavy hitters in music and film were booked for this concert, but it's like they didn't show up!  It was painful to watch Billy Crystal do stand up comedy.  I know Saturday Night Live is ""New York"" but their appearances seemed awkward and inappropriate.  It looked like Billy Joel had something ""special"" in his cup.  Mick Jagger looked like a chicken flopping around on stage.  And, why are all these celebrities in the audience?  Wasn't this concert for the New York emergency response people?  Unfortunately, this seemed to be just another exploitation of media moguls cashing in on a horrendous event in America's history.

Since then I have bought as many live Who DVDs as I can get. None of them match what I witnessed in 2009 as much as The Concert for NYC 8 years earlier in 2001! This DVD is true reflection of this awesome band who seem to have improved over the years with their timeless music. My 20 year old daughter loves it! Every other performer on this DVD pales into insignificance (but still interesting to watch though). You only have to see how the crowd responds to their music.

A lot of people were killed on 911 and millions and millions throughout the world like me, simply had their hearts broken. This was a sigh of relief. A glimpse of hope. A public service with the significance of a ticker-tape parade for those directly involved, unlike any seen in my lifetime.

It would be an great understatement to say the the performances were good. Imagine if you will, some of the all-time biggest names in music feeling as if this was their most important performance. Not for money or fame but because they were needed. Then throw in the significance of the lyrics and the vulnerability of the audience. A more endearing screen-play has not been written.

I am not sure why the DVD was edited with performances eliminated,(I can assume why Hilary's segment was edited)  HOWEVER, the Robin Hood Foundation which was responsible for raising money, and to which proceeds from your purchase will go, was and I believe still is the only charity to give the money to families suffering losses from 9/11.  I wish I could remember where I had read about it, but so many charities failed to deliver funds they had raised.  Bottom line, your money is actually going to help people buy purchasing this.

The concert itself mesmerized me when I watched a rebroadcast on VH1 around Christmas 2001.  This concert was organized and put on less than two months from the tragedy, and if you watch it today, remembering that,  you can't help but tear up with the joy and sorrow experienced by the crowd when shots are displayed of them experiencing the show.

The Who was phenomenal and my favorite part.  I also want to credit Melissa Etheridge's solo accoustic version of Bruce Springsteen's Born To Run.

THE CONCERT FOR NEW YORK CITY is chock-full of remarkable performances and extraordinary emotion. Two moments in particular stand out for this reviewer and make this a must-have set.

The first came midway through the evening. Richard Gere mounted the stage and committed the single bravest act I'd ever witnessed. From the care taken with his wording, Gere must've had a good measure of the audience, caught as it was between two very strong emotions -- keening for its losses and raging for retribution -- so the crowd dissolving into a booing mob could've come as no surprise. (Me, I jumped to my feet, applauded and wept.) Still, Gere plainly hoped -- and I hoped along with him -- that some WOULD hear, that the events of 9/11 HADN'T robbed America (or the world) of rational thought, that the dream of our world at peace LIVED.

Since that night, I have longed to convey two words to Mr. Gere: THANK YOU.

America had one moment when the majority of the world stood by our side. We could've worked real miracles, but baser reactions stirred the country to seek blood-for-blood instead and the elect chose to betray rather than serve by debasing themselves before the mob. And now the bloodless battle for peace must begin anew. As Elton John once sung (""Seasons Reprise"", ASIN B000001DXH), ""For our world / the circle turns again."" We have fallen from immeasurable heights, but we can rise, too, with new or renewed understanding. And hope.

The second moment that makes this set memorable comes at the end. No bravery, but the moment made me weep as well, mournful tears, for when Macartney introduced his anthem for the evening, ""Freedom"", the emphasis sat squarely on the edict to ""FIGHT!"" and spill even more blood. The sentimental appendage, ""for freedom"", rang hollow, as no more than an afterthought, weak-voiced and wavering, audience participation dwindling fast. Sad, but then Paul never was the Beatles' political mastiff.

No, for what it's worth, I don't expect a single reader will click Yes to say this review was helpful to them. But I HOPE, even so.",1165104000,29,2236,4.840314136125654

1669460,5,B00005V1YF,"A CONCERT FOR NEW YORK is a remarkable DVD that could serve to define the concept of catharsis. It takes the viewer through a troubling experience, fully explores the sadness of loss and offers a ray of hope that we can survive.

A grab bag of musical performances, short films and a parade of politicians and appearances by actors and actresses that was hosted by Billy Crystal, A CONCERT FOR NEW YORK was filmed in Madison Square Garden at a tender time in New York City: a mere five or six weeks after the September 11, 2001 and only a few days after anthrax was first discovered in our mail boxes.

A CONCERT FOR NEW YORK features unforgettable musical performances by classic rock legends (The Who, Mick Jagger with Keith Richards, David Bowie), pop superstars (Elton John, Billy Joel, Jon Bon Jovi, John Mellencamp) and hip hop performers (Jay-Z, Destiny's Child).  It showcases short, perhaps 2 minute long films by New York City film directors (Martin Scorsese, Spike Lee, Ed Burns).  And it includes comedy routines by notable SNL cast members (Jimmy Fallon, Adam Sandler).

But the real stars of this DVD just may be the firefighters and policemen who comprise the audience.  Middle aged, wearing their uniforms and holding photos of their murdered colleagues and family members, this is not the youthful, glamorous audience one would expect to see at such a high profile event.

Crying, dancing, singing, looking confused by Jay-Z's performance and even laughing at a Billy Crystal joke about how because of the anthrax scare, all the rock stars back stage were for the first time in history running away from any white powder, the audience of first responders looked like for the first time in months they had a chance to let their hair down and enjoy life in a deeply troubled city.

While I completely understand the disappointment many viewers feel when they realize A CONCERT FOR NEW YORK was edited (some songs were deleted and the boos Hillary Clinton's appearance provoked were replaced by cheers), I still believe this is a valuable concert that anyone who was living in New York City on the morning of 9/11 will love.

Setting the tone for the evening, it begins with a solo David Bowie seated Indian-style on a stage playing a haunting rendition of Simon & Garfunkle's ""America"" on what looks like a children's miniature piano.

This performance, like so many you will see here, reveals how each of these songs takes on new meaning now that the horrors of terrorism have reached American shores.

Just try to listen to Bowie sing the following verse without remembering how we felt after we realized people who want to kill us are living next door to us:

""Laughing on the bus playing games with the faces

She said the man in the gabardine suit was a spy

I said be careful his bowtie is really a camera.""

As a long time fan of the Who and the Rolling Stones, I was most surprised by how much I loved the performances of artists who up until that point I thought were beneath me.  But still I walked away from watching A CONCERT FOR NEW YORK with a newfound appreciation for Elton John, Billy Joel and Jon Bon Jovi.

In light of how all of these performances take on new meaning in a post 9/11 age, I wasn't surprised that Roger Daltrey whaling out ""We won't be fooled again,"" would have a new significance.  But I was pleasantly amazed that I could find any way to appreciate Jon Bon Jovi strut across the stage singing ""It's my life.  It's now or never.  I ain't going to live forever.""

Likewise Elton John's ""Mona Lisa and Madhatters"" and Paul McCartney's ""Imagine"" are haunting performances.

Probably the first time after 9/11 that people in Manhattan gave themselves permission to laugh and feel real joy, A CONCERT FOR NEW YORK is a wonderful snapshot of an odd time in New York City.

I have friends who live in California who simply do not get why this is such a great concert.  On the evening I saw it when it was simulcast on VH-1 and virtually every broadcast TV station, I sobbed with profound sadness and cathartic joy.  Every time I have seen it since I have had a similar experience that reminds me of those times when we New Yorkers were stumbling through the events of the day in a walking coma and suffering from varying degrees of post traumatic stress syndrome.

I am however extremely dissapointed by the performances from all the SNL comedians, which were nothing but a very lame and absolutely boring attempt at trying to be funny.

After flicking through the TV channels until I came up to the first thing I saw on VH1, it was the Who doing Baba O' Riley at this concert.  This was pretty much my very first conscious exposure to rock and roll, and what an amazing revelation it was! The Who saved this young impresionable mind from the attractive grip of banal MTV culture.  I now have almost every Who CD and follow by my personal creed that the Who is the greatest rock and roll band in the world.  I'm greatly thankful that such a phenomenal band was there to lighten the spirits of all those New Yorkers during those tough times with the healing power of Rawk and Roll!  Oh yeah, and Bowie performs Heroes, one of the best songs he ever wrote, and it had an extra special impact on the audience that night.",1111968000,17,998,4.461538461538462
1669464,4,B00005V1YF,"Overall, 99% of this concert is very good.  David Bowie, the Who, Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Paul McCartney and Elton John all played fantastic sets here.  But I have a problem with some of the other music.  Eric Clapton plays ""I'm Your Hoochie Coochie Man,"" totally unreated to 9/11.  Jay-Z also had no business appearing at this show, especially if the only piece he can come up with is ""H to the Izzo.""  My other complaint is that this DVD is incomplete.  Two Paul McCartney songs, one Eric Clapton song, one Goo Goo Dolls' first song, and a good cover of ""With a Little Help From My Friends"" are all missing.  The entire 6-hour concert could've easily been released.  But what's here, for the most part, is very good.  So on the whole, this is a good buy.",1087171200,34,761,4.456521739130435
1669465,5,B00005V1YF,"It was a night of healing. It was a night of reconcilliation. It was a night for firefighters, policeman, paramedics, musicians, actors and ""Saturday Night Live"" alumni alike to join together and prove New york did not grow weak after 9/11. It grew stronger and this 5 - hour concert showed those shems in the Middle East right.
Disc 1 is chock full of memorable moments. For me, the highlights were Billy Joel doing ""New York State Of Mind"", Eric Clapton and Buddy Guy doing a scorching rendition of the blues standard ""I'm Your Hoochie Coochie Man"" and Adam Sandler reviving Operaman. But as just about every reviewer pointed out, The Who blew everyone away. I think it was ""Won't Get Fooled Again"" that stood out. It was also a spectacular swan song for the band's bassist, John Enthwistle. This was his last live appearance ever. He died suddenly in June 2002.
Disc 2 is even better. My favorite performer here is Elton John, who delivers a powerful version of ""Mona Lisas And Mad Hatters"". Mick Jagger and Keith Richards do great versions of ""Salt Of The Earth"" and ""Miss You"", though I would have liked it if all of The Rolling Stones were onstage. Jimmy Falon does an interesting medley of 1980s' hits that includes ""Who's Johnny"", ""Der Komisar"", and ""I Just Died In Your Arms Tonight"". Paul McCartney brings down the house at the end.

There are also many musical treasures in this concert -- the reunion of the Who, the youthful spirit of the Backstreet Boys, the appearance of two Rolling Stones, the humor of the Operaman and the beautiful soul of Destiny's Child.  First and formost, however, the greatest advantage of the Concert for NYC over Woodstock, is the presence of a Beatle.  I have the VHS of Woodstock too, and I' not saying it's bad, but it was a lot different.  This is people uniting to fight for peace.  This is the event that shows a strong country can beat a weak country.  This is our generation accomplishing the dream of America, and like McCartney, ""I wil fight for the right to live in freedom.""  So why only 4 stars?  Because of the crap -- Jay-Z's ""H to the Izzo"" (which, by the way, he shortened to keep the interest high) and John Fallon's ""'80's Medley.""  What the hell was that?  One more thing -- some songs on Woodstock would have worked very nicely on the Concert for NYC too (eg. Hendrix's ""Star Spangled Banner."")

David Bowie starts out playing his tune, ""America"" and then we move on to the heart-pumping sounds of Bon Jovi, Jay-Z, and the Goo-Goo Dolls. Next is one of New York's own, Billy Joel. He takes us through on a trip of New York, singing about his ""New York State of Mind."" Destiny's Child entertains us with a few light tunes, and then Eric Clapton with Buddy Guy, playing a nice-moving tune, ""I'm Your Hoochie Coochie Man."" Adam Sandler takes the stage next, eagerly displaying his grief over Guliani's departure and his confusion over how ""Tough Osama"" is ""exterminating"" in a cave.
Disc 2 starts off with Mike Moran offering some Irish Wisdom to his good friend, Mr. Bin Laden. The Who then delivers an absolutely amazing performance (almost half of the second disc), rocking out on three songs for over 30 minutes...a performance to go down as one of the greatest sets of all time. Disc 2 is not as jam-packed as the first, but finishes out with Paul McCartney singing several songs,including never-aging renditions of ""Yesterday"" and ""Let It Be"". The CD ends with Paul McCartney and most of the artists there that night (minus a Mick Jaggar) playing his new song ""Freedom"" with Eric Clapton taking numerous exhilerating solos.

The performances came from the heart and the faces in the audience were those of true New York hereos, and it was good to see them having a fantastic evening; one they truly deserved. The best performance, to me, was that of Daltrey, Towshend, Entwislte, and Starkey. The Who seemed to be the most enjoyed performance of the night and proved that the group still had their awe inspiring talent even while pushing sixty (except Zak Starkey, the new drummer, and son of Ringo Starr). The only reason I gave this DVD four stars instead of five, is the fact that it is edited from it's originally aired broadcast. On October 20, 2001, the fact that the show was put together in less than a month was evident. To me, it was also a testimony of the true dedication and love that the musicians showed to these great hereos; that they were willing to give whatever they could to show them a good time, even for only one night. A few moments of when the crowd got a little out of hand, or simply too rowdy for the taste of the producers, were also edited. Included were the moments when the crowd nearly booed Senator Hilary Clinton off the stage, and when they became rather upset with a comment made by Richard Gere on focusing the energy of the night not on revenge, but peace. The moment that got to me, however, was FDNY's Mike Moran and his views on what was to be done with that Osama Bin Laden. Let's just say, I can't really repeat was was said, and aparently, neither could Columbia Music Video, the production company. This DVD is almost exactly the same os the Christmas re-broadcast of the concert, which I caught on VHS (Bootleg, shh!). But, if you liked the concert at all, I recomend this DVD. It's better than no DVD at all, right? And, either way, you girls should be happy to here that Roger Daltrey hasn't lost his stunning good looks after all these years. After all, I think he's sexy and I'm at least 20 years too young! ;) Don't forget, proceeds go to the Robin Hood Relief Fund so, buy this DVD anyway!",1017705600,5,2312,4.455188679245283

It's two DVDs and they didn't leave anything out as far as I can tell, it's got all the short films, celebs on stage, bits by comedians and of course the music... very sad at some points and really uplifting at others, a time that we must never forget!  I don't know if it's b/c of my DVD player but I can't seem to move around the menu just to see different parts, I have to watch the whole thing to get to certain parts of the DVD but I can rewind, fast-forward and skip.
