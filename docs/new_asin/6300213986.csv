232539,5,6300213986,"Airplane! is amazing. It's hilarious from start to finish. I never realized how much Family Guy is like this film until I recently watched it again. It's basically just one random joke or flashback joke after another and it all works together. You have to have great joke writers to pull that off since there isn't much of a story to hinge the film on, and like Family Guy, Airplane! had some pretty excellent joke writing. The actors pull it off really well with mostly deadpan and straightman shticks. I highly recommend it if you're looking for some easy watching with a lot of laughs.",1511827200,2,588,4.609523809523809

This movie is completely off the wall and has a couple running jokes that have become iconic, even though the vast majority of people don't know they were in this movie.  It's a spoof of Airport, first and foremost, but also spoofed almost every blockbuster of the previous three years.  Just one warning - this is not exactly a PG movie.  However, compared to today's R's it's really tame.  If you're a movie buff of films from the late seventies and early eighties you will enjoy this film.",1468713600,,624,4.585585585585585

What it is not is sophisticated and I would say that it's not for children younger than 15 or without an
adult to give context.

What you should know, if you don't, is that
late 70's and 80's PG films would be more like R or PG17.  There are also sections that are racist, sexist
and generally not in the taste of our times.  Let's just sayno one comes out unscathed and the
shots are ""equal opportunity offensive"".

Be warned though,  this movie is loaded to the gills with adult ""XXX""  and kid friendly humor.
It's all basically Disney level up until a naked woman bares her breasts for a brief for seconds midway through the movie.
I'm all for woman's rights,  and believe that a womans body shouldn't be treated as an object or toy.
 But still,  if you feel this way,  and wish to keep your kid in the dark about the birds & the bees till they unknowingly consumate a child because they weren't taught about it by their parents.
If that's the case,  then this movie is NOT for you.

At the time, it was gut-wrenchingly funny and the style was very original. I believe this is when Leslie Nielsen experienced a sudden career shift from serious to comedic actor and it's interesting to see how low-key he plays it here (and as Frank Drebin in the original short-lived Police Squad! TV series) as opposed to the over-the-top version of Frank Drebin that he played in the Naked Gun series, and in all those horrible movies he made later.",1464307200,,609,4.5963302752293576

No denying that Zucker, Zucker and Abrams' original laugh-fest is still one of the funniest films of its kind ever made. It is a true classic, in every sense of the word. Watching this again on Amazon prime after not seeing it for a while, I was struck with the sheer genius of the writing - remembering aspects of characters and gags and then re-visiting them multiple times in the film, at seemingly perfect times in the rhythm of the piece is evidence for this. For example, in the opening reel Robert Hays pulls up to the infamous White Zone (is it for loading and unloading? Or for no parking?) and leaves a passenger in his cab to go inside and find his love, Elaine. Of course he never comes back, and the script keeps returning to the cab numerous times during the film, where its erstwhile passenger (played, if you can believe it, by California Property Tax crusader, Howard Jarvis!) awaits his return, with the meter running up to over $100. What makes Airplane perhaps truly important in this post-modern, pop-culture obsessed world is the remarkable number of timely references, both in the script, and in the casting: ""stewardess, I speak jive"" is soooo late 70s; casting Kareem Abdul-Jabbar as the co-pilot, and then having him shed his pilot uniform for his Lakers' uniform is so of the moment it is timeless. The central accomplishment of ZZ&A's film is how thoroughly it skewers not only the airport disaster movie, but every Irwin Allen...er, disaster movie made in the 1970s. And the team continued this so brilliantly with other genres, including the Police Procedural (Naked Gun), Testasterone-laced War movie (Hot Shots) and so on. They really rarely hit a sour note, and in some ways where the original Trey Parker and Matt Stone's of their day -- equal opportunity satire that basically nails everyone.

1 Buy ""Airplane"" and ""Zero Hour""
2 Get a bunch of your friends together for ""movie fun,"" and a bunch of food & drink.
3 Watch ""Airplane"" first.
4 Then watch ""Zero Hour"" so all your friends can laugh at the EXTREME DRAMA!

You must watch ""Airplane"" first, or you won't get how funny ""Zero Hour"" is.

Most of the ""gags"" in ""Airplane,"" are plays on the drama of ""Zero Hour."" ""Zero Hour"" was supposed to be a good dramatic movie. Well they screwed that up! Now we get to enjoy ""Zero Hour"" as a comedy, because it never qualified as a drama, well a ""good"" drama.

243963,4,6300213986,"""Airplane!"" was an influential film, one that is certainly important in and of itself (I mean, it's darned funny), but one that is also important for what it engendered, what films it encouraged over the following decades.  ""Airplane!"" was the brainchild of writers and directors Jim Abrahams, David Zucker, and Jerry Zucker.  In 1980 they made a spoof of disaster movies, and in the process they wound up poking fun at just about every Hollywood movie clich they could think of.  The result is a nonstop flurry of slapstick sight gags, puns, innuendoes, exaggerations, caricatures, you name it.  If one joke doesn't get you, expect another one a second later that probably will.  If you've never seen ""Airplane!,"" you'll either find it hilarious or the silliest thing you've ever watched. I lean toward hilarious.

The movie takes aim primarily at Arthur Hailey's ""Airport,"" but along the way it skewers as many disaster-movie stereotypes as time allows.  The plot is simple (or simpleminded):  The entire flight crew of a passenger plane bound from L.A. to Chicago is stricken with food poisoning, and only one other person on board can fly them to safety.

The hero is Ted Striker (Robert Hays), a former pilot who hasn't flown since a tragic accident during ""the War"" (presumably the Second World War, judging by the flashback war footage, which would make Striker a man in his sixties at least, yet he's played by a fellow clearly no more than thirty, one of the running jokes in the film).  Striker's love interest is a stewardess and former girlfriend, Elaine (Julie Hagerty), who ably assists him in his attempts to fly the plane and overcome his drinking problem (he can't find his mouth with a glass of water).  ""I guess the foot's on the other hand now.""

The biggest key to the movie's success is casting Hollywood tough guys, macho actors, in comic parts and then asking them to play it straight.  So, deadpanning their way through the shenanigans are Peter Graves as Capt. Oveur, Leslie Nielsen as Dr. Rumack, Robert Stack as Rex Kramer, Lloyd Bridges as McCroskey, and basketball star Kareem Abdul Jabaar as copilot Roger Murdock.  It was this role-reversal gimmick more than anything else that inspired the later proliferation of movies like ""The Naked Gun"" and ""Top Secret.""

Among the better moments:  A little girl who needs a heart transplant serenaded by a well-meaning stewardess who separates her from her life support; the Mayo Clinic filled with shelves of mayonnaise; a nun reading ""Boy's Life"" and a little boy reading ""Nun's Life""; a barroom brawl between two Girl Scouts; and not-quite-accurate subtitles for two African-Americans speaking jive.  Besides ""Airport,"" the film parodies things like ""Saturday Night Fever,"" ""From Here To Eternity,"" ""Knute Rockne, All American"" (although it's too bad the filmmakers didn't get Pat O'Brien to do the takeoff on his famous ""Win one for the Gipper"" speech), TV commercials, and Tupperware parties.

""Surely, you can't be serious?"" asks Striker.  ""I am serious,"" responds the doctor, ""and don't call me Shirley.""

It's all very reminiscent of ""Mad"" magazine, surely Abraham and the Zucker's inspiration, with every scene filled with background activity that's at least as funny as the foreground material.  Perhaps, though, the only gag that today's audiences might not get is one involving Howard Jarvis, the California tax-cutting advocate, sitting in a parked taxi with the meter running throughout the film, his fare going higher and higher.  Well, it was topical back then.  Look, too, for cameos by Ethel Merman, Jimmy Walker, Kenneth Tobey, and a more substantial performance by Stephen Stucker as Johnny, the wildly prissy wacko who practically steals the show.

Video:
Paramount have given what was already a good DVD picture an even better transfer in this high-definition Blu-ray edition, retaining the 1.85:1 ratio image with a dual-layer BD50 and an MPEG-4/AVC encode.  Paramount video engineers appear to have done a little more restoration on the film because the 1080p transfer is excellent:  clean, sharp, bright, vivid, well defined.  While there is a little natural print grain during the opening titles, which we might expect, there is almost no sign of age or noise anywhere else in the film, even in the darker scenes.  Skin tones look as perfect as one could want, with more-than-adequate black levels to set off the colors.  Impressive.

Audio:
The Blu-ray disc uses lossless DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 for the soundtrack, which may seem like overkill but does what is probably a near-perfect job in reproducing the remix.  The sound is quite clear and reasonably dynamic, if a tad hard edged at times.  A wide stereo spread makes up for any lack of surround activity, which is sparse.  Elmer Bernstein's B-movie inspired musical track gets a touch of ambient bloom in the side and rear speakers; otherwise, the front-center channel takes the brunt of the load, mostly dialogue, rendered smoothly and realistically.

Extras:
The extras derive from the previous ""Don't Call Me Shirley"" edition, and they're still worth pursuing.  There's a commentary from the writers and directors, Jerry Zucker, Jim Abrahams, and David Zucker, that includes not only a ton of information but a good deal of humor as well.  Then, there's a trivia track you can play that covers a lot of the same material.

If you choose, you can also watch the film in the ""Long Haul"" format, where you click on ""TA"" (Trans-World) icons every few minutes that take you to various comments from the writer/directors, producer, and stars, as well as to various deleted scenes.

The extras conclude with a widescreen theatrical trailer, not fully restored but presented in high def; twenty-six scene selections; bookmarks; a slipcover with a holographic picture on the cover; a flimsy Eco-case; English, French, Spanish, and Portuguese spoken languages and subtitles; and English captions for the hearing impaired.

Parting Thoughts:
Even though I've seen ""Airplane!"" probably a dozen or more times now, I never fail to laugh throughout the whole thing.  Sure, many of the gags have long since outlived their sell-by dates, and, as I say, I doubt that too many people anymore will recognize California consumer-rights activist Howard Jarvis (whose Proposition 13 in 1978 sharply cut property taxes in the state, for better or for worse).  But any minor shortcomings in the film are hardly worth mentioning.  ""Airplane!"" is a comedy classic that spawned a ton of sequels and imitators and made it to the American Film Institute's list of best comedies of all time.",1432857600,2,6619,5.079482439926063

243969,5,6300213986,"The genesis for Airplane! Came from the long list of 1970s airplane disaster flicks and helped to give us the spoof subgenre. This is a movie that has both timeless gagssuch as Barbara Billingsley speaking jive for example and hidden gags that one really has to watch the movie multiple times to capture all the jokes. It is a complete and utter spoof and unlike many of the modern movies in this subgenre it is actually funny. This is one of those rare movies that you can just pop in and I don't care if you have had the worst day of your life, I assure you that you will be laughing by the end of the film.",1431475200,,609,4.169491525423729
243970,2,6300213986,"Had I been old enough to review ""Airplane""  when it first came out, I know I would have raved on about how funny the film was. And, at that time and place (1980) it was funny to my then 14 year old mind. But, I'm commenting on the film now and I have to say it doesnt hold up well. Boring and stupid are the first words that come to mind. I realize that many people have a fondness for the film due to often spouted lines such as, ""and don't call me Shirley."" I tried to find it funny,  but not even a chuckle couldn't be mustered up. For me the only real humour in the film is Lloyd Bridges exclaiming, ""looks like I picked the wrong day to quite sniffing glue."" Comedy is a tricky business in films and some comedies produce seemingly never-ending laughs. This film is a nostalgic piece of 1970s comedy (since it came out in 80) that cements a unique approach to the genre onto celluloid , but without sustainability.",1431302400,,919,4.215909090909091
243971,5,6300213986,"Based largely on the 1957 film Zero Hour!; the script was enhanced by an amazingly strong cast - two members of which became pop culture icons. I saw this film when I was 12 or so - when it was first released - this film completely warped my fragile, impressionable little mind. What's amazing is that after all that time, I still find new stuff that I missed previously - even after all of these years. This film needs to be watched with it's cousins; the Hot Shots! pair. I'd also put this on the list next to Spinal Tap. Just watch it. If you have no sense of humor, don't bother. Actually, if you have no sens of humor, are so tight in the ass, or are just an old (expletive deleted), just go away.

It's the way satire's should be.  Now-a-days seems like most comedic scripts are written by the same kid... Thinking it's all about d**k and f to the no art jokes.  So sad...

246046,4,6300213986,"""Airplane!"" finds success with broad comedy. In many respects it is a parody of something particular, the disaster movies that were popular at the box office throughout the 1970s, especially 1970's ""Airport."" But it also grabs from a much larger bag of contemporary references: the movie opens with the ""Jaws"" theme, progresses to a ""Saturday Night Fever"" parody, and casts Kareem Abdul-Jabbar specifically to make jokes about his basketball career. Abdul- Jabbar's comedic timing is a little on the slow side, but it makes no difference because the joke is that he's playing himself playing someone else. ""Airplane!"" is still funny because of the kind of comedy it uses. When it goes for topical humor, it goes so bigthe biggest blockbusters, the biggest athletes, the biggest politiciansthat almost everyone is in on the jokes without explanation, even decades later. A few lines might send younger viewers to Wikipedia, but those lines are the exception rather than the rule. Mostly the movie eschews referential comedy in favor of basic puns and gags. As with all comedy bits, some work (the send-ups of epic movie speeches are all well-delivered), some get old (the gay jokes haven't aged great), and a lot just depends on taste (from what I understand, some people don't like puns!) Nothing pleases all of the people all of the time, but with wordplay, surrealism, and slapstick in its arsenal, ""Airplane!"" probably pleases all of the people some of the time. For a broad comedy that's the idea.",1423180800,,1501,5.032128514056225

I've always enjoyed Zucker, Abrahams, and Zucker comedy.  Other films that come to mind:  Kentucky Fried Movie (their first endeavor from their days at University of Wisconsin), Top Secret, and of course Police Squad!.

This film is a delightful, slapstick parody of airplane disaster movies (the plot line is actually based upon a 1957 move ""Zero Hour!"" and other disaster films, such as ""Airport 1975"").

The plot centers around a routine passenger flight in which crew and passengers find themselves succumbing to food poisoning, leaving no one but Robert Hays, a traumatized (supposedly World War II) fighter pilot who must overcome his fear and fly the craft.

The film sports a top notch cast including a singing Nun played by Maureen McGovern (who also sang the theme to ""The Towering Inferno"" and ""The Poseidon Adventure""), and was Leslie Nielsen's first comedic role.",1419897600,,1008,5.0

246690,5,6300213986,"Airplane! is a satirical comedy and it is a parody of the disaster film genre which was popular in the 1970's and it is known for its use of absurd and fast-paced slapstick comedy, including visual and verbal puns and gags.

It pulls out all the clichs as alcoholic pilot Ted Striker, who's developed a fear of flying due to wartime trauma, boards a jumbo jet in an attempt to woo back his stewardess girlfriend. Food poisoning decimates the passengers and crew, leaving it up to Striker to land the plane, with the help of a glue-sniffing air traffic controller and Striker's vengeful former captain, who must both talk him down. Along the way, we meet a clutch of stock disaster movie passengers like the guitar-strumming nun, a sick little girl, a frightened old lady, and two African-American travelers whose ""jive"" has to be subtitled.

Although the movie is dated,it can still be enjoyable and entertaining especially with its laughs and gags as it pokes fun on disaster films. It is one of the funniest and most inspired of the madcap genre spoofs that I have ever seen in cinema. Also,the presence of Julie Hagerty elevates the film to higher status. It is definitely a timeless film ever made.",1419292800,,1202,4.746411483253588

Drawing upon pop cultural items embedded in the public consciousness, spoofs are frequently lacking in originality, and are undoubtedly predisposed towards becoming dated.  ""Airplane!"" is, thus, a bit of an anomaly.  Although familiarity with the earlier disaster films enriches the viewing experience, I would contend that ""Airplane!"" can be enjoyed as a stand-alone feature (certainly to its credit as the source material is rather pass).  Replete with witty wordplay and joyously juvenile gags, the film is surpassed, in my estimation, only by Mel Brook's perennial ""Blazing Saddles"" and ""Young Frankenstein.""",1415491200,,704,5.730769230769231

249764,5,6300213986,"My comments are only about the ""I Love the 80's"" edition of Airplane.  The product description on Amazon is not entirely accurate.  I ordered the disk and am pleased to report that the aspect ratio stated on the DVD box is 1.78 (16:9) rather than what is stated in Amazon's description (I prefer the 1.78 aspect ratio to 2.35).  Also, this edition definitely DOES have two special features:  the theatrical trailer and a group commentary.  Amazon's product description states that it has NO special features.  Finally, Amazon's description says it has 2 disks, which led me to believe it might be a longer version of the movie.  It does contain two discs but only one of them is the Airplane DVD  the other is a music CD with four songs ostensibly from the 80s, none of which I'm familiar with.  The tracks are ""Lips Like Sugar"" by Echo & the Bunnymen, ""Chains Of Love"" by Erasure, ""Need You Tonight"" by INKS and ""Take On Me"" by a-ha.  I must have been just too busy during the 80s to have noticed any of these groups.  None are to die for, in my opinion.

As for the movie itself, it's one of my favorite comedies of all time.  And if my opinion isn't persuasive enough, it ranks #10 on the American Film Institute's list of the 100 best comedies (AFI's 100 Years . . . 100 Laughs).  If you like comedy check it out!",1393891200,4,1317,4.3884297520661155

However it was a turning point for him from leading man in ""Forbidden Planet"" (1956), to serious doctor in"" Airplane!"" (1980), to Field Guide in ""National Geographic's ""The Savage Garden"" with Leslie Nielsen (1997)

Airplane has a great cast including Robert Stack (playing himself), Lloyd Bridges (glub glub), and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (just as defensive as ever).

This movie is unique. It is the first; I have seen displaying one liners with serious intent. It was not just slapstick or Abbot and Costello. This particular film uses the ""Airport"" movies as the basis of most of its humor.

It worked well enough for sequels and other films to be made in the new genre. I keep it with the Leslie Nielsen Collection.

250050,5,6300213986,"Although originally intended as an in-house training film at LaGuardia, ""Airplane!"" is a wonderful overview of the ins and outs (particularly the outs) of operating large, commercial aircraft. The film includes tips for dealing with unruly passengers, how to make emergency use of beverage cart wheels during a landing gear failure, and how to deliver twins in a lavatory with a press photographer perched on the sink. The DVD ""extras"" are almost as fascinating. We get a behind-the-scenes look at the Hellfire 3100T, which at the time, was the defacto state-of-the-art luggage crushing machine. We also witness the precursor to today's rigorous passenger screening technology, which consists of 87-year-old airport employee Harry Blaumeister asking passengers, ""You got anything naughty on you?"" My only complaint, and it is minor, is that it appears they may have reused some old Apollo 11 DVDs by recording over them, as we occasionally hear what sounds like the voice of Neil Armstrong, cursing.

Now, let's get to the good stuff, and talk about the disc itself. It is made of a pleasing polycarbonate and measures 4-5/8"" across. It is, for all intents and purposes, round. The center sprocket hole is 1/2"" in size. If your DVD player sprocket is larger or smaller, you may need an adapter. (I have heard of some using chewing gum for this purpose.) The physical disc itself is the best thing about this package, because not only can it be played, but used as a pocket mirror as well.

If you are not dated, many of the jokes including right at the very beginning with Howard Jarvis, you will not get.  That being said, its still hilarious, and I suspect that younger viewers will be amazed, and possibly offended that in the 70's people could make jokes about stereotypes and everyone laughed.  Its complete slapstick, has tons of bit players doing things that were breakouts for them.

It's also great to watch it as an adult, LOL. Anyway, my only issue with this version of the DVD was the bonus features. Now of course it may have just been operator error, but let me explain what happened... I watched the original movie with no problem whatsoever. Then, I went to the special features and started the audio commentary. There was still no real problem other than it was a little boring for me. Then, I chose the other option, which was the ""long haul"" version which had deleted scenes and interviews with the directors anytime an icon came onto the screen. The very first time the icon appeared, it automatically goes to the interview. However, I was unable to hear any of the dialogue at all! So, I tried to go back to the original version of the movie and now none of the dialogue could be heard either. Only the background music. At first I thought maybe it was my DVD player, but I tried another DVD, and there is no issue at all. I may have to return it if I can't figure out what happened. So be very careful when ordering. It may be better just to have the original version with no fancy bells and whistles. Just my opinion",1380067200,,1296,4.381742738589212

I still crack up every time I see Leslie Nielsen say with a straight face, ""I am serious....and don't call me Shirley!"" The commentary track with producer Jon Davison, and the writers/directors Jerry and David Zucker and Jim Abrahams, add to the enjoyment with their ""backstage"" stories, and how the whole thing came about. They point out during the film small walk-on parts that were done by various family members and friends. Also they point out the different names that are used in the dialogue are actually friends from high school, people on their staff, etc. You can tell they are having a blast talking about making this hilarious film..  The disc also offers  ""pop-up trivia"" with anecdotes throughout the film, but most of these are covered in the spoken commentary. The Blu-ray disc is excellent. Dazzling clarity and terrific surround sound. I strongly suggest, AFTER watching ""Airplane!"" to watch the 1957 film ""Zero Hour!"", on which ""Airplane!"" is based.

Romantic comedies, then slapstick comedies.  This is more of the 'spoof' variety, but it is so sharply written, you wonder how they could've pulled off writing a gag-a-minute with such precision.  It's truly hysterical, and one of the best comedies I've ever seen.  I'm more of a drama/horror movie fan, but this one really got me.

250511,5,6300213986,"The Big Bus(1976) was the first comedy to poke fun of 1970's disaster movies, but Airplane!(1980) did it right. People still quote stuff from the movie such as ""Don't call me Shirley"" and the two black guys who speak jive(Bet babe, slide a piece of the Porter. Drinks, I'll run the java). The film is also an unofficial remake of the 1958 drama Zero Hour. Jim Abrahams, David Zucker, and Jerry Zucker worked on the TV show Police Squad(1982) while Paramount Pictures used their own resources to make Airplane II The Sequel(1982). The music score by the late Elmer Bernstein is good work. The love theme is quite tender and it's been used in TV commercials. Airplane is packed with humor and gags. Ted Striker dances to disco music, a plane flies behind clouds as the ""Jaws theme music"" plays in the music score, a boy and a girl act like refined adults, the auto pilot is an inflatable blow up doll called ""Otto"" and more. By 1980, people were sick of Hollywood disaster movies and a spoof like this was released at the right time. These were the kinds of melodramatic movies that made Irwin Allen famous. The ZAZ guys did experiment with dark comedies such as Ruthless People(1986). They also made the underrated rock & roll/spy movie spoof Top Secret(1984) starring Val Kilmer. In 1987, they made The Naked Gun, a feature film version of the failed Police Squad TV show. Airplane! is still one of the funniest movies ever made.",1367452800,,1429,4.6521739130434785

250846,5,6300213986,"Airplane! is the greatest comedy of all time. Instead of going to the terrible new Resident Evil film I pulled this DVD off my shelf. I know people will be angry with me for saying that about the new Resident Evil film even when I haven't seen it. Well my answer to those people there are some films you don't have to see to know they are crap. There are quite a few examples I can give Catwoman, Electra, Ghost Ship, Jason X, Showgirls and Texas Rangers to name a few. Certain bad films you can just smell the stench of crap off of, and I got that sense from Resident Evil: Retribution. Next week I'll probably see two films in Dredd and The Master, but I decided to save money and time and stay home and watch a classic comedy and in my opinion the best comedy of all time. People who've looked at my ratings know I'm not that big fan of comedies and certainly not the comedies that come out today. I prefer the comedies of the late 1970's, the 1980's and early 1990's. In my opinion those were the best years for comedy films like the Monty Python films, Spaceballs, Top Secret!, Clue, Caddyshack, History of the World Part I, Hot Shots, Robin Hood: Men in Tights and Major League to name just a few good ones, and perhaps the greatest of them all are is the 1980 film Airplaine!

Airplane! Is the brain child of Jim Abrahams and the Zucker Brothers who also brought us the Hot Shots! Films along with The Naked Gun movies and Top Secret! to name a few. The film is a parody of the airplane disaster films that were all over the place in the 1970's. The story follows Ted Striker (Robert Hays) an ex-fighter pilot who became a taxi driver and is traumatized by war and is afraid of flying. His longtime girlfriend Elaine Dickinson (Julie Hagerty) leaves him and heads to her job as a stewardess. Ted wants to win her back and briefly overcomes his fear, and boards the plane to win back his girlfriend. During the flight dinner is served the passengers and flight crew become sick, and Ted is looked upon to land the plane. What happens before and after is nothing but hilarity. The deadpan comedy is great. The actors deliver straight faced lines that hare hilarious. The comedy timing given by these dramatic actors is brilliant. It is simply a brilliant comedic film.

Speaking of the actors the majority of the actors in the film had never done comedy before. Leslie Nielsen (Dr. Barry Rumack) had never done a comedy before this. Before Airplane he had only done dramatic roles in such films like Forbidden Planet and The Poseidon Adventure. Yet this formally serious actor delivered his lines straight faced and brilliantly. Delivering lines like

Rumack: I won't deceive you, Mr. Striker. We're running out of time.

Ted Striker: Surely there must be something you can do.

Rumack: I'm doing everything I can... and stop calling me Shirley!

Before Airplane Nielsen was only known for his dramatic roles, but after he would only be known for his comedic roles in the Naked Gun Series and others. Then there is Peter Graves (Captain Clarence Oveur). He was a great dramatic actor and may be best known for his role in the Mission Impossible television series. He was brilliant as Captain Oveur and his lines with his flight crew Roger Murdock (Kareem Abdul-Jabbar) and Victor Basta (Frank Ashmore) was fantastic. Jeff Bridges father Lloyd Bridges played Steve McCroskey. Another great actor who is mainly known for his dramatic roles yet was great delivering lines like.

Steve McCroskey: Looks like I picked the wrong week to quit drinking.

Steve McCroskey: Looks like I picked the wrong week to quit smoking.

Steve McCroskey: Looks like I picked the wrong week to quit sniffing glue.

Steve McCroskey: Looks like I picked the wrong week to quit amphetamines.

He delivered them all with a straight face and was and are hilarious. If I remember right I don't think Paramount Pictures wanted serious actors for the film, but Zucker and his partners wanted dramatic actors for the lead roles, because he thought the lines would be so much funnier if delivered by dramatic actors who had never done comedy before, and it worked extremely well. I don't think it had ever been done before, and would lead to other dramatic actors like Robert DeNiro, Al Pacino and others to doing comedies.

Overall Airplane! is a brilliant film. It ushered in a new type of comedy into the world in a parody which I don't think it had been done before along with using dramatic actors for a comedy. The film has a great story, with an excellent cast and some of the best comedy you will ever see. Instead of wasting time with the crapfest that is comedy now a days check out Airplane! the best comedy of all time or check out Airplane! 2, Spaceballs, Caddyshack, Hot Shots! and the Naked Gun films.

250943,5,6300213986,"""Airplane!"" is not just A comedy movie, but one of THE comedy movies -- movies like ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail,"" ""Shaun of the Dead"" and ""Young Frankenstein.""

And honestly, it deserves to be in that august company. This is one of the funniest movies ever, with a constant barrage of gags, running jokes, spoofs and parodies of various movies (""Saturday Night Fever,"" to name one) -- it never stoops to pretending to have any dramatic weight, but simply buries you in hilarity. Surely you'll enjoy this!

Desperate to win back his ex-girlfriend Elaine (Julie Hagerty) , former pilot Ted Striker (Robert Hays) follows her on an outgoing plane. It's actually his postwar trauma about planes that has led to their breakup, and now he boards the plane -- along with nuns, Hare Krishnas, an ill child, jive guys, and many others -- to prove his love for her.

But as he tells stories of his romance to increasingly suicidal passengers, a REAL crisis arises: food poisoning! All the fish on the flight have gone bad, causing most of the passengers and the whole flight crew to become horribly ill. Only Ted has the chance to land the plane safely, with the guidance of the increasingly erratic people on the ground, and the advice of a kindly but not too helpful doctor (Leslie Nielson).

""Airplane!"" bombards you with jokes -- crude jokes (boobs!), pop culture references (Kareem Abdul-Jabbar), word puns (""... and don't call me Shirley""), parodies of other movies, characters being overly literal, random gags (Captain Oveur suffering the food poisoning symptoms) and running gags that they milk just long enough (""Looks like I picked the wrong week to stop..."").

In other words, it's packed with so many jokes that it nearly explodes. And yet it flows naturally from one ridiculous gag to the next, like a vast patchwork quilt of hilarity where everything fits. Directors Jim Abrahams, David Zucker and Jerry Zucker never let the humor go slack; the one sentimental moment in the movie is handled as a parody (""Win one for the Zipper!"") and the mortal peril they're in is played for laughs.

250944,5,6300213986,"""Airplane!"" is not just A comedy movie, but one of THE comedy movies -- movies like ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail,"" ""Shaun of the Dead"" and ""Young Frankenstein.""

And honestly, it deserves to be in that august company. This is one of the funniest movies ever, with a constant barrage of gags, running jokes, spoofs and parodies of various movies (""Saturday Night Fever,"" to name one) -- it never stoops to pretending to have any dramatic weight, but simply buries you in hilarity. Surely you'll enjoy this!

Desperate to win back his ex-girlfriend Elaine (Julie Hagerty) , former pilot Ted Striker (Robert Hays) follows her on an outgoing plane. It's actually his postwar trauma about planes that has led to their breakup, and now he boards the plane -- along with nuns, Hare Krishnas, an ill child, jive guys, and many others -- to prove his love for her.

But as he tells stories of his romance to increasingly suicidal passengers, a REAL crisis arises: food poisoning! All the fish on the flight have gone bad, causing most of the passengers and the whole flight crew to become horribly ill. Only Ted has the chance to land the plane safely, with the guidance of the increasingly erratic people on the ground, and the advice of a kindly but not too helpful doctor (Leslie Nielson).

""Airplane!"" bombards you with jokes -- crude jokes (boobs!), pop culture references (Kareem Abdul-Jabbar), word puns (""... and don't call me Shirley""), parodies of other movies, characters being overly literal, random gags (Captain Oveur suffering the food poisoning symptoms) and running gags that they milk just long enough (""Looks like I picked the wrong week to stop..."").

In other words, it's packed with so many jokes that it nearly explodes. And yet it flows naturally from one ridiculous gag to the next, like a vast patchwork quilt of hilarity where everything fits. Directors Jim Abrahams, David Zucker and Jerry Zucker never let the humor go slack; the one sentimental moment in the movie is handled as a parody (""Win one for the Zipper!"") and the mortal peril they're in is played for laughs.

Example: when the flight crew gets sick, Elaine has to activate the autopilot... which is a big inflatable faux-pilot. When he later deflates, she has to blow him back up in a very suggestive way.

And all the acting is spot-on -- everybody plays their roles with exaggerated seriousness, whether it's Hays' lethally boring tales of his life or Nielson providing ""uplifting"" encouragement at all the wrong times. Even the small roles are handled with deadly, hammy seriousness.

While the sets may be a bit dated, most of the comedy itself holds up well.

What is the plot? It's the main story of a movie... but that's not important right now. Robert Hays plays Ted Striker, a former military pilot who has been too afraid to fly since the war but is the only person who can land the plane after the pilot and co-pilot come down with food poisoning, along with half the passengers. Julie Hagerty plays Elaine, the stewardess who was in love with Striker but hates how he's stuck in the past. The cast is rather interesting, with a mix of comedic and serious actors all delivering the one-liners. My favorite is Lloyd Bridges as McCroskey, the supervisor in the air traffic control tower. There are some inspired choices here, such as Barbara Billingsley (the mother in ""Leave it to Beaver"") as a jive talker, and Peter Graves as Captain Oveur.

In addition to lots of great one-liners, the movie also has some really funny ongoing gags, such as McCroskey saying he picked the wrong week to quit smoking and then later that he picked the wrong week to quit amphetamines. There's no shortage of sight gags either, including an automatic pilot which is a blow-up dummy.

In my opinion, this is the funniest movie ever made. This is even more impressive considering that it was made very early in the careers of nearly everyone involved in both writing/directing and acting.
The whole thing is essentially a spoof of a 1957 movie called Zero Hour. Our hero Ted Striker follows his flight attendant girlfriend onto her plane in an attempt to salvage their struggling relationship. During the flight, both pilots are incapacitated by some unfortunately timed food poisoning, and Ted has to land the plane.
Stupid jokes abound, and there is something very wrong with you if you aren't laughing. You can tell that nobody erred on the side of caution here. Anything that was funny found its way into the film in one way or another. There are whole scenes that are built around a single joke that is totally unrelated to the plot of the film, but are still really funny. You forgive the movie for some technically bad storytelling techniques because it's so damned hilarious. This is a comedy in the truest sense. Nobody is taking anything seriously here, and neither should you.
There are jokes flying so fast you have to see it more than once because you will laugh through many of them on the first viewing. The best part is that even 30 years later, very few of the jokes feel dated.

251151,5,6300213986,"""Airplane"" is one of those movies that is almost embarrassing to admit that you like, much less that it is on your ""Top 10"". The humor ranges from slapstick sight gags to some really clever play on words that might be missed on the first viewing. I have watched this no less than 20 times or so, and still find little gems each viewing. Airplane is one of the most quotable movies ever since there are so many one-liners and plays on words.

The plot is a send up of the numerous airport/airplane disaster movies of the 1970s and features an all-star cast, including Peter Graves, Leslie Nielsen, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Frank Ashmore, Lloyd Bridges, Jonathan Banks, and Barbara Billingsley.

This movie has a lot of adult humor, racial stereotyping, substance abuse, and worse. None of it is presented in a serious way, but those that are easily offended should skip this movie.

This is one of my guilty pleasures, so Highly Recommended with the caveats above.

Thanks to the onslaught of gags and familiar jokes (granted, not all of them hit, but with this many thrown at you at rapid fire it doesn't really matter) this film rightfully become considered a classic, and will go down in history as one of the funniest films of the 80's.

I much prefer this to `Caddy Shack'.

The film tells of Ted Striker, a former pilot who no longer can work up the nerve to enter the cockpit due to an accident years prior.  He gets on a plane where his girlfriend Elaine is working as a stewardess in order to try and repair their fraying relationship.  While in flight the crew gets sick from food poisoning and so it is up to Elaine and Ted to save the day.

With an array of off color jokes, outlandish performances and a steady string of perfectly parodied blockbusters, `Airplane!' rarely strikes a sour note.  Julie Hagerty and Robert Hays are hilarious as the two leads, but it's the supporting cast that really stands out, all of them making the most of their limited screen time and delivering memorable caricatures.  Leslie Nielsen is probably the most recognizable face in the group, and he works wonderfully, but it was Peter Graves who really made me double over in laughter.  It takes talent to makes something as unfunny as propositioning a young boy funny, but he makes it work.

At times `Airplane!' goes over the top, but that is half the fun here.  The script is all over the place but it manages to have a handle on itself, making for a funny and crazy yet surprisingly cohesive film.  It's nice, because many parodies today completely throw any real script out the window and just deliver a series of unrelated spoofs.  At least `Airplane!' holds to a plot outline, and even if it goes off the page a bit it has the smarts to wheel it back in.

What's great about a film like `Airplane!' is that, even though it's been almost thirty years since its release it is still very, very funny today.  Sure, some of the jokes are out of date, and if you haven't seen some of the movies being spoofed the gags may go over your head in places, but if you are getting the complete experience then it is an experience you will not forget.  I, for one, have never even seen `Airport', the basis for this spoof, and yet I was in stitches throughout the films entirety.

With memorably hilarious scenes like the acoustic sing along (I was crying, it was so funny) and that risqu&eacute; blow up doll scene, `Airplane!' is a laugh riot and a sure fire crowd pleaser to any fan of genre it helped launch.  It's possibly the best of its breed.",1239235200,,2797,4.450980392156863

The audio commentary and trailer from the previous issue are retained, but because of the absence of any behind the scenes footage, rather than a new documentary there's a `long haul' option to view the film with cast and crew interviews. And it's a long haul indeed - barely 30 seconds, and sometimes less, seem to pass before you're taken to another interview, not always that relevant to what's going on onscreen. Indeed, on one occasion you're just taken to the directors clearing their throats. There are only three brief deleted scenes, but there's a fairly comprehensive number of surviving cast and crew, from the directors (who proffer such words of wisdom as ""These days it's so easy to get a nun on a surfboard.""), Leslie Nielson, Robert Hays, Peter Graves and various supporting players to the now grown-up little Joey (as in ""Joey, have you ever been in a Turkish prison?"") and the kid whose face appears on one memorable faked newspaper headline (the producer's grandson). Only Julie Haggerty seems conspicuous by her absence. The only annoyance is that it's not possible to access the interviews separately without watching the whole film. Among the highlights is a brief shot-by-shot comparison with Zero Hour!, the b-movie that inspired the film: not only is it every bit as inane as legend has it, including laughable dialogue reprised verbatim in Airplane!, but the directors even went to enormous efforts to match parts of it shot-for-shot! There is one tantalizing unanswered question - given John Travolta's enthusiasm for the film when it was in production, what did he make of Robert Stack beating up the Scientologists, Moonies and other cults soliciting donations in possibly the film's most memorable moment?",1232755200,,1852,5.035830618892508

251274,4,6300213986,"Comedies have a notoriously short shelf life because there are only so many times you can hear a joke before it stops being funny and you start to feel contempt for it.  That's why I'm really impressed when I see a comedy over 10 years old that still manages to entertain me and even so if it's able to get me to laugh more often than not at most of the jokes.

""Airplane"" is refreshing because I still found it funny although admittedly not nearly as funny as when I first saw it decades ago.  This film is important though because of its impact and influence on countless comedies to follow that fit this particular sub-genre.  I remember laughing until I cried when I watched films like ""Top Secret"" and the whole ""Naked Gun"", ""Hot Shots"" and similar comedies and even more recent films like ""Epic Movie"" and ""Scary Movie"" owe a great debt to this film.  This kind of comedy sub-genre though is admittedly not for everyone but if you like your comedy totally screwy, corny and just plain silly then you'll enjoy this film.

Hardly any comedy rewards repeated viewing for the reason I mentioned at the top of this review although this film does to some extent provided you view this no frequently than annually to give yourself a chance to rediscover it like an old friend.  I remember I also enjoyed the sequel with William Shatner in it too.

This dvd version is also pretty good in that the sound quality comes in a Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound option which is pretty good and although the picture quality isn't perfect, it's still pretty good for an almost 30 year film with very few imperfections such as white spots to complain about.  No special features worth mentioning but overall this is still a good standard dvd format version to own.  I can only wonder what a restored and remastered Blu-ray version would look like though.

This box-set that was released May of '08 could have been alot cooler. This is the first time (at least for Region 1) BOTH Airplane! movies have been released as one product in ONE case as far as I know. However, instead of 2-for-1 sets like Paramount's ""Wayne's World"" & ""Chris Farley"" groupings, that were two movies put on one DVD-9 (dual layer-single sided/one movie per layer), all they did with this one was put the original 2000 discs in one dual spindle keepcase with a new cover/slipcase. And it does NOT contain the extras-filled ""Don't Call Me Shirley!"" edition of the first movie either, just the original bare-bones first release. Extras here are just the original commentary track & trailer for the first film, ""Sequel"" is nothing but movie. I was hoping for a better presentation, but I bought it mainly for owning Part Two (as I already own the ""Shirley"" edition). As for picture/audio, it's what you'd expect from an eight year old digital transfer, not as good as ""Shirley""'s. So I guess if you don't have any version of Airplane!, this set under $10 is nice & quick, but look for the ""Shirley"" edition first for an outstanding copy of the original classic.

This film is actually a parody of 1970's disaster films (specifically airport disaster ones, and one in particular, Zero Hour), but I don't think of it as a parody when I watch it.  I just think it's a great comedy.  It has classic scene after classic scene, and people will argue over the rest of time which one is the best scene.  For me, my favorite scenes involved Johnny, the sarcastic assistant to Lloyd Bridges, Lorna Patterson's song, the jive guys (and Barbara Billingsley), the ""dialogue"" at the beginning of the film about the white zone and abortion, Peter Graves's dialogue, but a scene that makes me die laughing is a short one.  Rex Kramer (Robert Stack) is driving towards the airport, and he ""runs"" over a bicyclist (who is played by Jim Abrahams, one of the creators here).

251408,5,6300213986,"Airplane! deserves its place in motion picture history as of the funniest spoofs on film of seemingly just about everything and everyone under the sun--including disaster movies! The plot moves along at a good pace and the acting really holds your attention. The one liners and ridiculously silly scenarios are bound to make just about anyone laugh.

The action begins at an airport where people are boarding a plane to Chicago. Elaine (Julie Hagerty), a stewardess on the airplane, is leaving her lover Ted Striker (Robert Hays), a shell shocked pilot with tremendous issues about his mistakes during ""the war."" Ted races to the airport to catch up with Elaine and even winds up buying a ticket (which is literally giving off smoke, because Ted asks for what was then the ""smoking section"") to get on the flight with Elaine.

The plane fills with passengers--and some have problems designed to create hilarious scenarios throughout the film. There is a young girl who needs a heart transplant, two religious zealots, a young boy who almost gets propositioned (!!!) by the Captain Oveur (Peter Graves), the nuns on board, and many more.

The cameos are worth the price of admission alone. Look for Kareem Abdul-Jabaar to play himself masquerading as copilot Murdock; and Ethel Merman plays shell shocked Lieutenant Hurwitz in her final screen role. Barbara Billingsley (the mother from Leave It To Beaver) plays ""Jive Lady,"" a white older woman who understands black street language; and Jimmie Walker plays the man who wipes the windshields of the airplane before they take off. Two of the writers of the script who also directed the film, Jerry and David Zucker, play ground crewmen at the airport when the plane is getting ready to take off as well. Great!

Initially the flight goes well although Ted and Elaine can't quite see eye to eye about staying together--the flashbacks to the times they spent together as lovers include great spoofs of classic scenes in From Here To Eternity and Saturday Night Fever. However, when people onboard get sick because of poisoned fish, trouble quickly ensues. The flight crew becomes far too ill to fly the plane; and then Ted is called upon to rise to the occasion and guide the plane to a safe landing. Soon Ted and Elaine are the only ones able to stay in the cockpit as they try desperately to land the plane in Chicago.

The DVD sports the ""long haul"" version which integrates cast interviews, deleted scenes and more into the film. You even get a trivia track as well as the standard commentary track by producer Jon Davison and writer/directors Jerry Zucker, Jim Abrahams, and David Zucker. One reviewer writes that they were surprised and somewhat frustrated that quite a few of the ""long haul extras"" cannot be viewed separately from the movie. I can't blame them; but at least the producers of the DVD tried to be creative with a new way of presenting extras. This is only a minor disappointment for me.

Overall, Airplane! shows great forethought; and it amazes me that it was filmed in only about five weeks! The laughs never stop and the countless one liners pop out at you and make you laugh like you haven't laughed in years. Airplane also gently pokes fun at racial and social stereotypes; and the way the film goes about this makes it all the funnier.

After 9/11 and the tightening of airport and airline security it was nice to see a funny, lighter film aboard an airplane and it's perfect antidote to the ""United 93"" world we presently live in.  It's funny to think of food being the source of terror as opposed to the other disaster movies of the time where the plane itself was the danger (""Airport,"" ""Airport 75,"" etc.). That alone was so funny...when was the last time you had a meal served on an airplane?

Daresay we could use a film that pokes fun at the current situation with security although I don't know how many people would find that funny. Serious times tend to produce serious films (witness ""United 93"") and I don't know how well comedies like ""Airplane"" would do today.

In a lot of respects ""Airplane!"" is a time capsule that evoked laughs for me too. I chuckled at how lax the security was in the film compared to today's super-tight security...remember curbside parking?  Being able to meet people at the gates? Of course it was funny to see people being able to smoke in airports and on planes (no love lost there).

Unfortunately the fish meal on the flight is bad and causes the crew to go sick leaving the plane on automatic pilot. With Striker the only man on board who can land the plane can he overcome his fears of failure stemming from the war? This without a doubt one of the best comedies of cinema, it is far and away the best spoof ever made - and it was made when this type of humour was still fresh. From the opening moments right down to the closing credits this is hilarious. The plot is a straight spoof of 1970's Airport disaster movies, and is only an excuse for a range of jokes. However the plot is bang on - it's detailed enough that it could be a serious disaster movie and allows the film to poke fun directly at the disasters movies themselves. The cast are perfect. For Robert Hays and Julie Hagerty this represents the best things they've ever done. Both play the straight men for the majority and are relied upon to take it all seriously and drive the plot while jokes occur all round them, that said they deliver many themselves but always straight faced. Nielsen and Bridges are also spot on as stereotypical doctor and traffic control guy who ""chose the wrong day to give up drinking""! They are both so straight faced that they make the whole thing seem even more silly. Robert Stack is excellent as the man brought in to talk the plane down, playing the butch masculine figure ignoring all the madness around him. Also on the ground, Stephen Stucker is great as the camp controller who delivers many brilliant one liners as he walks through scenes. Peter Graves and Kareen Abdul Jabbar are great as two of the pilots that almost are in a different movie the things they say! The film is a spot on spoof of disaster movies, making fun of the many clichs of the genre - the nuns on board, the sick child, the ""only man who can land the plane"", the poisoned food etc. But it does more than just poke fun at these - it is hilarious in it's own right. All the cast deliver their lines brilliantly and the script! The script is excellent - I'm not going to start listing lines but they come so thick and fast that you usually miss something because you're laughing at the last joke.

This is the mould for all spoofs - this is the one to beat. While many spoofs are hit and miss this is almost a total hit. Decades on and many viewings later this is still as fresh and as funny as it ever was. A brilliant, brilliant comedy!

251600,5,6300213986,"PART BURLESQUE - PART VAUDEVILLE -- BUT FUNNY ALTOGETHER

LOOKING BACK --- A NEW KIND OF FILM IN 1980

When this film was first released I recall seeing the ads on TV, and the reviews with film clips. What I remember most is the scene of an hysterical woman on board the plane being shaken by the doctor [Leslie Neilsen] who was called away to the phone. Then another person took over the slapping while the cameras slowly panned toward the now forming line where people were carrying huge wrenches, pistols, baseball bats and crowbars - all oversized, to help aid this poor passenger in her moment of hysteria. This really sets the tone of what ""AIRPLANE"" is all about.

SIMPLY STATED -- TACKY, TAWDRY, VULGAR & CLICHE: YET HORRIBLY HYSTERICAL HUMOR

When ""Airplane"" was first released in 1980 it was unbelievably funny from beginning to end. Yes, funny enough to forgive the recurring bouts of poor taste that would have sunk a lesser comedy. One of the keys to ""Airplanes"" success is in using traditional dramatic actors like Robert Stack, Peter Graves, Lloyd Bridges and most of all Leslie Nielsen as the venerable Dr. Rumack who travels wearing his stethoscope, even when he is sleeping.

SO WHAT IS THE PLOT OF 'AIRPLANE'?

The tightest clump of comedy ever devised is here on DVD.

------ *- WARNING : PLOT SPOILERS BELOW: WARNING *--------------

--*

It goes something like this, but don't be surprised if my account doesn't sound funny at all!

Ted Striker [Robert Hays], is a disaster as a human being. He is an alcoholic former single-engine fighter pilot who now has a total phobia of flying because of his war-time trauma where most of his squadron died while under his ill-fated command. Nevertheless, Ted Striker boards a jet airliner in an attempt to plead his way back to the good graces of his stewardess girlfriend [Julie Hagerty] who states, ""I can't live with a man I don't respect"".

 -* THE FILM IS ALL ABOUT STRIKER REGAINING ELAINE'S RESPECT

Fortunately for Ted Striker fate intervenes, as food poisoning incapacitates the passengers, and crew that had fish for dinner. This includes the entire flight crew. Now only Striker is available to land the plane. Enter Mr. Striker!!! Striker's former commanding officer [Robert Stack], is given the impossible job of talking down Striker, the reluctant hero.

AS THE STORY IS TOLD: PRATFALLS - CLICHES & LAMPOONS OF RECENT DISASTER EPICS ABOUND

We meet a gaggle of disaster movie cliches, that we call passengers. They include the guitar-strumming nun, a sick little girl who needs a heart transplant, the frightened woman who gets it from a line of bat weilding passengers, and two African-American male passengers who speak ""jive"" and who have their words subtitled throughout. We also have Dr. Rumack [Leslie Nielsen] who takes everything literally and who states ""You can tell me -- I'm a doctor"" to equally straight Capt. Oveur [Peter Graves] the overtly pedophilic pilot.

AFTER IT IS ALL SAID & DONE: EVERY MOMENT OF AIRPLANE IS STEEPED IN OVERWHELMING SILLINESS!

To be sure, this is an excellent comedy. However, today, 26 years after its original theatrical release it does seem a little dated as it has been copied, and lampooned all too frequently. ""Airplane 2-The Sequel"" did nothing to strengthen the franchise as it sought and passed the limit of just how 'over-the-top' the limit of good humor was and still is. Having said all that, this is an adult comedy which is literally over all too soon. A single second is not allowed to elapse without the presence of overwhelming silliness which for the most part, works quite well to further the silly plot and to delight the audience.",1155686400,5,5012,5.0
251601,5,6300213986,"Great one-liners, puns and sight gags, all played with deadpan perfection. Don't let my simplistic description mislead you, though: this spoof of disaster films is no standup comedy routine. Rather, I find it quite simply the funniest movie I have ever seen. The comedy is innovative and, at the time it was made, unlike any other comedy. While some gags in the movie appear merely silly or sophomoric, to make humor this funny takes a good deal of intelligence. It is almost surreal to see Robert Stack, Leslie Nielsen and Peter Graves deliver such hysterical lines. Often imitated, never equaled.",1155686400,,598,4.99
251602,4,6300213986,"The movie is a classic, and the commentary by the directors is awesome, entertaining in it's own right.  But the DVD is another Paramount foul-up.  You have to fast forward through a bunch of stupid previews before you can get to the main menu like it's a video tape.  Paramount is desperate to force previews on the viewer, and will do anything to try and make you watch them.  Also, to see interviews and the very few deleted scenes, you have to watch the ""long-haul"" version, where you watch the movie and the interviews cut in at various points, some placed better than others.

Of course if you know and love this film, this DVD is essential viewing.  I just don't understand why the studio interns put the DVD together.",1155254400,5,725,4.538461538461538

The film itself seem's to have been cleaned up alot compared to the original DVD release. I actualy felt like I was watching a different movie I hadnt seen before in a few spots, could've also been the widescreen presentation!

I think the commentary by the Zucker Bros and Jim Abraham is new, and isn't the same one that was found on the last DVD (region 4 DVD anyway) tho don't qoute me on that, I didn't exactly listen to the original one more then the first time.

If you have already seen the movie a million times like myself, and you still wanted to see more so you went ahead and bought this edition, then let me tell you to start off by going to the special features and selecting the option to watch the movie with interviews and deleted scenes. I was kind of hoping for more deleted scenes rather then the 2 or 3 that are here, but some of the interviews filmed recent to the release of this DVD can be interesting. There are interviews with the Zuckers and Abraham, Leslie Nielson, Peter Graves, Robert Hays and a few other familuer faces along the way. What happens is now and then a TA icon appears on the screen and then it autmaticly goes into the interview about the previous scene or the scene about to play and they might just talk about it, or point out something you may not have noticed before or just rant about something.

The next feature you might wanna do is turn on the trivia track and the audio commentary at the same time to kill two birds with one stone... that is if you feel like watching it again or saving it for next time.

And thats about it as far as whats on the special edition! I was kind of disapointed there wernt more deleted scenes or outtakes, and I didn't feel there was enough extras for me to say it's a definite must have 5 star dvd bursting with extra goodies... but fot a fan of the film it's not a regretable purchase.

It would be cool to see a special edition of part 2 but I doubht it will happen, different directors and wasn't as popular... anyway, sit forward, put your head between your knees and give yourself some pleasure before crash landing and try to enjoy this special edition of Flying High.",1154563200,,2369,4.312359550561798

The movie is crammed with sight gags and one liners.  It was great to watch some of the ""old men"" of film, known for their serious acting, spoof themselves in outrageous scenes.  The movie is worth watching  if just to see Barbara Billingsly ( Leave it to Beaver's mom) do the ""I speak jive."" scene.  This is not high comedy, but a lot of belly laughs.

The movie succeeds in its rapid-fire delivery of humor. Some don't always land, but right behind it is one that does. I just watched it again after a few years and, although it did not have quite the same impact it had when I was younger, I still had a smile throughout the whole movie.

I still use several lines from the movie in my everyday life, such as ""Looks like I picked the wrong week to quit sniffing glue,"" and of course ""Dont call me Shirley."" Then there is ""You like movies about gladiators,"" but thats not important right now.

Kareem Abdul-Jabbar as a co-pilot is a cinematic triumph!

This film is so funny!

I wasn't sure what to expect, I knew it was a kinda spoof film, but as with spoof films, I normally don't get a lot of the jokes, or haven't seen the movies, a'la Scary Movie. There's a couple of very obvious spoofs included in this - Saturday Night Fever & From Here To Eternity. But most of the film is full of silly & funny moments, which are thrown thick & fast at the audience, but the problem I found was that I was still laughing or still thinking about the previous joke to get the next one, as they were that fast. And obviously people were laughing at stuff I didn't get.

The characters in this were also absolutely amazing, from the people who either hung themself or tried to set themself on fire cos they were so depressed/fed up, to the sheer over acting of everything, to the bit at the start with the people on the tannoy about the ""white zone"" (oh my God, you don't notice it at first!), to the random girl flashing her chest in the middle of a scene. Why?! It's just totally unexpected, and so not necessary.

The other thing to point out about Airplane is you really have to watch stuff that's going on in the background, as most of the funny bits are included in background stuff, or as I previously mentioned, the bit over the tannoy.

This film is a must see, particularly if you've got a cinema near you that starts showing old films, it's a definite to either get on DVD, or hopefully get a cinema screening. Well worth seeing.",1150243200,5,1720,4.137724550898204

1.  Perhaps there is an Easter egg that you can use in order to see the long haul ""extras"" w/o the movie.  Even though I was amazed at the amount of cast members (too bad no julie) it did get annoying after awhile.  I agree with others that it is also too bad you can integrate the new scenes back into the movie either like on Terminator 2.

The Print: Most rereleases that I've seen tend to have a newer transfer...at least one that outshines the previous and doesn't make us feel we're watching an 'OK' print. This one here has a liveable, but still noticeable amount of scratches and mystery objects that appear in the frame. I was expecting a bit better considering this is the day and age of restoration. Here, they didn't seem to do much of, if anything to the print, so we're left with one that is slightly better than a good TV quality picture. Hardly a 'special edition' copy of this film.

Features: I noticed immediately when I played the film alone, that it stopped or sputtered in the framerate at times. I'd stopped counting at about five, but still managed to finish the movie fine despite these annoyances. Well, I come to find out, as others have pointed out, the ballyhoo'd special features are chopped up and mixed into the movie (you enact this in the setup menu). Well, after looking at where these special features popped up when enacted, then going back to watching the same scene with them off....bingo....the sputtering I was seeing was exactly where these parts would normally come in. My point being....BEWARE......on some players this will cause a jittery film experiance at times if your just trying to watch it straight thru. My Apex & Koss Players refuse to play the film without these jittery spots, but my Playstation 2's both play the film normally. So just be informed, and keep this in yer back pocket. I'd took my first copy back for an exchange thinking it was defective, then got the replacement and it did the same. This is my first film of hundreds that I can only play on the PS2...lol....and the film.... what can I say that hasn't been said....unfortunately packed into a good intentioned, but rather lamely executed DVD Release.

251751,4,6300213986,"This movie perfected the rapid-fire machine gun style of comedy pioneered by comedians like the Marx brothers. The logic was that if one joke failed, you were too busy laughing at another joke that came along immediately afterwards to notice. This approach works beautifully because the number of jokes that work far outnumber the ones that don't. The Zucker Abrahams Zucker team created a dense structure of gags that fell into two different categories: ones that were visual in nature (Ted orders a plane ticket for the smoking section and he's handed a ticket that is literally smoking) or verbal (The doctor asks, ""What was it we had for dinner tonight?"" to which Elaine responds, ""We had a choice, steak or fish."" He replies, ""Yes, I remember. I had lasagna."").

Airplane! is a landmark comedy in that it spawned countless imitators - some by the original ZAZ team - and many more by other filmmakers. However, this film is the best of the bunch, followed closely by other ZAZ gems like Top Secret! and the first Naked Gun film. This comic team eventually split up to do their own films but none have come close to the low-brow brilliance of their initial collaborations.

Carried over from the previous DVD release is an audio commentary by producer Jon Davison and writer/directors Jerry Zucker, Jim Abrahams, and David Zucker. They take us through the genesis of the project and joke around like the old friends that they are. This is an amusing, informative track that fans of this movie will enjoy.

The ""Long Haul Version"" allows you to watch deleted scenes and new interviews with cast and crew as you're watching the movie. In a bafflingly inept move, you cannot watch this stuff on its own, you have to watch it as you're watching the movie. Some memorable cast members appear, including Hays, Graves and Nielsen, along with Davison and the ZAZ team. It's great to hear everyone reminisce about what it was like to make the movie and how they feel about it now.

If you are looking for even more factoids, than you can enable the ""Trivia Track"" feature that runs steady supply of information on the screen that pertains to the movie and the cast and crew.

251752,4,6300213986,"""Airplane"" is a manic parody of airplane disaster epics that alternates between the absolutely hilarious and the merely silly.  It features an all-star cast of manly men poking fun at themselves, including Lloyd Bridges, Robert Stack, Chuck Connors, Peter Graves and the inimitable Leslie Nielsen.  In fact, this film made Nielsen the Pope of Movie Silliness, leading to his ""Police Squad"" tv show and movies, plus various other comedy roles in films not nearly as inspired as this.

Oh, there's a story in there somewhere too.  Robert Hays plays a broken, shell of a pilot complete with a drinking problem who tries to rekindle his romance with flight attendant Julie Hagerty onboard an airliner where the crew (which includes Kareer Abdul-Jabbar!) comes down with food poisoning.  But who really cares about the story when all it does is serve as a springboard for frenetic comedic riffing on everything from Ethel Merman (playing herself) to classic films (""Casablanca,"" ""From Here to Eternity"") to tv commercials and beyond?

There's a little something for everyone here, and if you don't think one joke is funny wait a moment or two because another one will be along shortly.  My favorites involve Robert Stack as an uber-macho pilot who whips off a pair of sunglasses to reveal... another pair of sunglasses, and Beaver Cleaver's mom Barbara Billingsley as a woman who can translate jive.

Moment for moment one of the funniest movies ever made.  Director Jim Abrahams went on to direct the ""Hot Shots"" movies and ""Welcome Home, Roxy Carmichael"" (Oscar winner for Best Picture for the years 1986, 1987 and 1992) while co-writers David and Jerry Zucker (no relation) went on to craft such classics as ""BASEketball,"" ""First Knight"" and ""Ghost.""

251753,2,6300213986,"While this film is a true classic, this particular issue is not as good as I would have hoped for.

The story, you know it, it dosen't need rehashing. The special features on this disc is really what I'm disappointed with.

I like the ""follow the white rabbit"" features, but to basically chop a making-of featurette into 60-some parts and scatter them throughout a movie to where you have to constantly leave said movie... is just annoying.  There were only three deleted scenes presented (the Hijack scene, additions to the Kid Professionals conversation, and the water cooler with Kramer and McCroskey).  There were other deleted scenes that appeared in the TV version.  My biggest complaint is, where are these deleted scenes, and if you were going to include these, why not just put them on a menu in the special features like 95% of the other DVDs that are out there.

Now, to the positives. The picture and sound are excellent, although I can't tell much of a difference between this release and the first DVD release.

My recommendation: If you don't mind the annoying white rabbit every so often as the only way to access special features, then this is probably for you.

251754,5,6300213986,"Not a knock against the film but I'm kind of getting tired of Paramount labelling these editions after lines in the film. We have the ""Don't Call Me Shirley"" edition, ""Holy Schnike"" edition(Tommy Boy) and ""Bueller....Bueller Edition""(Ferris Bueller's Day Off). It may have a silly edition name but at least it's got a funny movie behind it.

Ted Striker is a war veteran who's rather scarred from his experience. Not only that, he can't shake off the relationship of his ex Elaine. He follows her onto a plane where she works as a flight attendant. Only bad food among many of the passengers and its crew forces Ted to land the plane. It's a conventional film idea but since it's a spoof movie there's many jokes and scene extensions.

The successful joke-to-not successful ratio is pretty slim. In fact there's probably not a single joke that somebody will not laugh at. Many of my favorite lines or situations are here including the ""don't call me Shirley"" line and even some risque humor. The plane panics and onscreen for maybe 3-4 seconds I kid you not is a pair of naked breasts. A character says the S word and there's even an oral sex joke. It's nothing that's going to offend(although cover your kiddies eyes if they're wathcing at the breasts).

One thing that's rather disappointing is the transfer. Normally Paramount is quite good with impressive transfers but I would say it's probably the exact same as the movie was released. There's some dirt and a couple of scratches on the image and although it's nothing you're going to complain about, this is the era of digital restoration and with a big corporation like Paramount you expect at least a better transfer.

The extra features are quite good although nothing that's going to make you say ""wow it's packed!"". A reliable extra is the trivia track where subtitles reveal insights about the film. (Example: the beach where they film an unintentional From Here to Eternity parody is the same beach as the classic ending from Planet of the Apes.)

It's a funny film with a rather lousy transfer. If you're into pristine prints, you'll be disappointed. But when you're laughing at Peter Graves asking a kid if he likes gladiator movies...who cares?",1134432000,6,2211,4.792650918635171

251793,5,6300213986,"A clever, funny parody of disaster movies (bad melodramas such as ""Zero Hour"" and ""The High and The Mighty"" along with ""Airport"" were the prime targets here), ""Airplane! The `Don't Call Me Shirley' Edition"" manages to combine silliness, puns and with topical humor in a style that recalls something out of an alternate off-kilter universe. Filled with melodramatic, over-the-top music, deliberately bad acting and every clich about plane disasters you can imagine, ""Airplane!"" aims wildly and accurately most of the time taking the wind out of the sails of bad (and some good ones, too such as ""Jaws"")movies everywhere. Evidently the writing/directing team of Zucker, Zucker and Abrahams (who wrote ""Kentucky Friend Movie"" for director John Landis and later went on to crate ""The Naked Gun"" films) caught ""Zero Hour"" on TV and realized that this overripe melodrama was just right to be plucked and served up as comedy (something it verged on anyway).

Robert Hays plays Ted Striker(the name of Dana Andrews' character in ""Zero Hour!"") a former fighter pilot who is now afraid to pilot planes since a disastrous mission years before. Striker books a seat on the flight of his girlfriend Elaine (Julie Hagerty) in hopes of working out their relationship. When the crew and passengers are brought down by food poisoning Ted has to overcome his fears to pilot the plane to safety.

While the film looks very good (and better than its previous edition), I was a bit disappointed by the amount of dirt and debris. I thought that a deluxe edition like this would have a nearly pristine print and that Paramount would have the film digitally cleaned up.  Overall the film looks good but could have been tweaked more for this special edition. The soundtrack sounds pretty good overall and is presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 and 2.0 with dialogue clear and little distortion.

The extras are where this edition truly shines.  ""Airplane! The `Don't Call Me Shirley Edition"" doesn't have any of the conventional special features you'd expect. There's no ""making-of"" documentary or featurettes on the film per se. The ""Long Haul Version"" allow you to watch the film with frequent detours into comments by the actors (Hays is present but Julie Hagerty curiously isn't), writers/directors and other production crew. We also get deleted scenes in the ""Long Haul"" section that are quite amusing in many instances as well. Included in the ""Long Haul"" version are clips from the movie that inspired the Zuckers/Abrahams ""Zero Hour"". We also get the theatrical trailer and a clever menu that presents some of the classic scenes from the film as if you're watching an animated version of those horrible safety/disaster cards they place on airplanes drawn in the same style. This is like watching the movie, deleted scenes and a documentary at the same time. It's a great conceit and works pretty well here. There is also a subtitle track that features trivia about the movie and points out visual mistakes, etc. throughout the movie.

There's a good commentary track featuring the directors sharing stories about the production of the movie. This sounds like the commentary track from the previous edition. The commentary track provides a lot of amusing stories, trivia and background about the movie. Many of the comments are also echoed in the extended branching edition of the movie so listening to the commentary track really can't compare to watching the seamlessly branching edition.

A classic comedy that still works amazingly well, this special edition of  ""Airplane!"" is well worth it for the fans of the movie. Although the image quality could have been cleaned up a little bit more for this presentation, it's a pretty minor issue really as the ""special features"" make this edition worthwhile for fans of this classic bit of madness.",1134172800,230,3823,5.037974683544304

The directors' commentary, one would hope, is improved-upon for this re-release: the original DVD (released October 24, 2000) commentary was sorely lacking. Long periods of silence interrupted by laughter, in addition to the paucity of insight from the directors, made that somewhat of a diasppointment.

251831,5,6300213986,"This review is for the 2000 Paramount Widescreen DVD release.

This was the first of many top-notch parody comedies created by Jim Abrahams, David Zucker, and Jerry Zucker.  This film essentially crucifies the ""Airport"" suspense movies made in the `70's.  As in all of the Abrahams, Zucker and Zucker comedies, they pour out a major dose of sight gags and hysterical dialogue plus lampoon many famous movie scenes, and create just flat out bizarre events for cheap laughs.  The comedy never stops from beginning to end.

Many of the actors used in Airplane! were in the twilight of their careers including Robert Stack, Lloyd Bridges and Leslie Neilson, although for Neilson, it launched a long string of starring roles in other Abrahams, Zucker and Zucker comedies.  Even Barbara Billingsly, who played June Cleaver on Leave It To Beaver makes a cameo appearance translating ""jive"" between two black men and a flight attendant.

I wouldn't qualify it as a family film since there are plenty of sexual overtones and even brief nudity and some profanity, but it's still pretty lightweight compared to a lot of the stuff that's being made today.

Long before The Naked Gun, Jim Abrahams and David Zucker teamed up to write this outrageous comedy hit which spoofs the airline disaster movies prevalent throughout the 1970s. Starring a diverse cast with a wide range of experience from Hollywood, Broadway, and the NBA, Airplane follows the exploits of a number of characters such as Ted Striker (Robert Hays), Roger Murdock (Kareem Abdul-Jabbar), and Otto The Inflatable Pilot (as himself) - all of whom will keep you laughing in the aisles for one hour plus...

When ex-fighter pilot Ted Striker is released from the hospital following the mental strain of his war experiences, he decides to go out and find the love of his life, Elaine Dickinson (Julie Hagerty), a woman who broke off their relationship due to Striker's various problems (among which is a ""drinking problem"" - Striker's inability to pour liquid into his mouth!) Now an airline stewardess, Elaine is emphatic in her assertion that she will not get back together with Ted when he tries to renew their romance. Unwilling to take no for an answer, and certain he can prove he's overcome the problems of his past, Ted follows Elaine onto her flight.

All goes well until several passengers begin to get sick. Victims of spoiled food, almost everyone on the plane stands on the brink of death as all of the pilots pass out as well. One of the few who is not ill, Ted is called upon to land the plane in the pilots' absence. But his war memories and fear of flying threaten to cause a disaster. With the help of Elaine, Dr. Rumack (Leslie Nielsen), and Otto The Inflatable Pilot, Ted faces his fears and attempts to bring the plane in for a safe landing.

251837,5,6300213986,"You can't really beat AIRPLANE! when it comes to the pure joke-per-minute ratio of a film.  The jokes just fly out of this film at an incredible rate.  This is one of those films that ""matures"" along with the age of the viewer.  When I was young, all I understood was the surface humor in the film.  But as I got older, more and more of the film's wordplay and innuendo came across.  I just watched it the other day and it still had me rolling around on the floor, as if it were the first time again.

AIRPLANE! became famous as ""THE"" parody movie of all time.  As some other reviewers have commented, this film performs beautifully as a response to the ""wonderful"" disaster movies of the 1970s.  There is not a single aspect of this film that has not received care or attention.  There are all sorts of gags tucked into the script and endless amounts of puns and parodies.  Visually, the background sets, while being ridiculous, are packed with all sorts of hilarious images and gags.  Every time that you sit down to watch this film you will catch something new that you missed before.  Even the sound effects are funny (poking fun at the budgets of other disaster films)!

If you haven't seen it, do yourself a favor and get this movie: you will not be disappointed.  You'll be laughing the entire time as the jokes hit you like a Robin Williams set.  You'll also be quoting this film for days.  In fact, I think I'm going to right now:  ""I picked the wrong week to quit smoking...I picked the wrong week to quit sniffing glue.""  If you like the brand of humor that this film spawned (think: THE NAKED GUN series), then you have to see the original.",1113696000,,1652,4.396039603960396
251838,5,6300213986,"""Surely you can't be serious.""

""I am serious, and don't call me 'Shirley'.""

One of the best lines of all time and one of the most recognmized as well.  That and the ""drinking problem"" are two of the best running jokes in the entire movie.  This is one of my favorite moview of all time, it's just so dumb that you have to laugh at the stupidity of the jokes and puns.  My movie collection wouldn't be complete if I didn't have this movie, especially this version.",1110240000,,465,4.2988505747126435
251839,5,6300213986,"Airplane! is the funniest of them all. What it has that other comedies don't have is consistent, non stop humour, as it just keeps coming, each laugh as strong as the next. There are numerous classic moments in this film. Instead of remembering one specific joke that was funny, you'll be able to remember 50. It's that funny.

To briefly describe the fairly simple plot, a group of people are on a plane, in which a man named Ted Striker(the lead actor) has also boarded. The majority of the passengers, including the entire flying crew fall violently ill from eating fish for dinner and it becomes up to Ted Striker to land the plane, something he hasn't done since the war where he had terrible memories of doing so.

What makes this movie so funny is the small jokes they put in it, seemingly stupid, but filled with hilarity. An enormous highlight to this film is Leslie Nielson's character as he plays the doctor. This performance led him to become a huge success in the field of comedy films, especially his thrilling Naked Gun series.

The only flaw I will make note of is the lack of extras. There is only one special feature outside of the Theatrical Trailer which is Commentary by 3 men involved in the film. Unfortunately, to hear this commentary, you have to watch the movie along with it as they talk over it and it can be distracting.

Despite that minor flaw, overall, this movie is a must for any comedy lover. In fact, Entertainment voted it as the Number 1 all time comedy on a list of 20 movies.

The laughs are non stop and the characters are precious. If you love comedies, or movies in general, Airplane! will not disappoint, I guarentee it.",1110153600,,1664,4.533333333333333

251861,4,6300213986,"Written, produced and directed by the zany team of brothers David and Jerry Zucker and their buddy Jim Abrahams (in 34 days' time, no less), their inspiration for ""Airplane!"" came after filming ""The Kentucky Fried Movie."" Ideas for that earlier movie came from late night television broadcasts the team would set their VCR to record in the middle of the night, when they knew the worst commercials and old movies would air on local channels. On one of those fateful nights, they discovered a presentation of the 1957 film ""Zero Hour!"", starring Dana Andrews. The disaster flick was filled with unintentionally funny lines, which were perfect for the Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker style of filmmaking.

Whereas most comedies use jokes to pad the plot, ""Airplane!"" uses the plot to pad the jokes. Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker wanted ""Airplane!"" to be a short film surrounded by dozens of fake commercial parodies, but Paramount wanted an actual full-length film. The basic plot from ""Zero Hour!"", that of an entire plane succumbing to food poisoning during its flight, was kept, but they added the love story of ex-war pilot Ted Striker (Robert Hays) and stewardess Elaine Dickinson (Julie Hagerty) to the story. Elaine has left Ted, due to his inability to get over the war. Ted chases after Elaine for a chance at patching things up, and becomes the one passenger who can land the plane after the flight crew falls ill.

Jokes pile on top of one another throughout the course of the film, with subjects ranging from hare krishnas, substance abuse, Ted's drinking problem, flashback film parodies, and an automatic pilot that runs on helium. The gags are fast and furious, and sometimes go unnoticed during single viewings. Leslie Nielsen, as deadpan-speaking Dr. Rumack, gets off many of the best one-liners, along with Stephen Stucker as the flamboyant control room operator Johnny Hinshaw. Of course, no Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker film would be complete without numerous references to themselves and their families. The two Zuckers show up early in the picture as members of the ground crew who cause the plane to crash through the terminal window, while Abrahams shows up as a religious zealot who gets roughly pushed aside by Robert Stack at the Chicago Airport terminal. Proud mom, Charlotte Zucker, appears as a woman struggling to apply make-up during the plane's crash landing, and sister Susan Breslau appears early on as a ticket agent.

Without a doubt one of the funniest movies of all time, ""Airplane"" is available in a sparse edition on DVD. There are only two bonus features included in this release, which is at least better treatment than most older comedy films receive in their trasnfer to DVD. Still, it would have been interesting - if available - to include David Letterman's screen test and the deleted scenes used as filler on the televised broadcasts.",1107820800,2,2859,5.078723404255319
251862,5,6300213986,"Airplane is one of the classic, definitive comedies of the 1970's. It does almost everything right, and hardly any of its jokes even seem dated at all.

251863,4,6300213986,"I was having a birthday party,a nd 3 of my friends and I had no idea what to watch, as it was midnight, and Adult Swim was some crazy All-metal Alchemist thing (o_O). Anyhow, my dad had rented all of his favorite movies from back when he was young. I could've sworn that he would've gotten us Lassie, or something crappy like that. However, out of the Blockbuster bag fell about eight Monty Python movies, and Airplane!. Only Mary and I found Monty Python to be absolutly hilarious. So, we put in Airplane!. We ahd no idea what to expect, what was so funny about airplanes? Anyhow, the main point is, we figured it would be boring.

The first scene opened up with a lady going into an airport, and two people arguing via loudspeaker. It seemed as funny as I Dream of Genie is now. Later, however, we were all rolling on the floor, choking on our tounges with laughter. In a few later scenes, though, we sat bolt upright, looks of disgust on our faces, and eyes wide as tennis balls.

Allow me to mention a few of those scenes. In one, close to the ebginning, the captain is talking to a young maybe 6 year old boy about naked men (??????). THEN, an elderly lady is talking to a guy about how lovely this one lady is. ""Why she's got a lovely figure, a pretty smile, firm thighs..."" and taht's when we just about barfed. THEN (I'm afraid my list must continue) there were some mild scenes of female nudity, quite scary indeed. Then there's a lady sleeping (and I mean like you adults do) with a horse. AND THEN (the list goes on and on, I'm just hitting on the ones I found and remembered) there's an incredibly nasty inflatable auto-pilot. Of course there's more.

However, as seventh graders, none of this really actually bothered us, except for the fact that ypu really don't want to have children younger thyan 13 in the room (there's this one SCENE, and my little sister who is 10 didn't understand it. As you all can guess, I was in no position to explain to my little sister what a blo-job was).

IN CONCLUSION: this film in nothing but hilaious. But do not be fooled by the PG rating. It deserves a PG-13 for female nudity, sex metaphors, and a bit of language. This only adds to the fact taht it has got to be the funniest, or at least one of, movies I've ever seen. Also, Monty Python is pure gold.",1103414400,3,2306,4.331018518518518

The film has a modern but still timeless feeling to it and the comic deadpan delivery by otherwise very dramatic actors is excellent. A winner.",1101254400,,308,4.618181818181818
251865,5,6300213986,"Anyone who has ever seen one of a host of abysmal 1970's disaster flicks could have predicted that they were ripe for a satire, but I doubt anyone could have predicted that ""Airplane"" would have set the gold standard for the spoof.  In addition, since it appears on TV so often, seeing it on DVD is almost a new experience because all of the scenes that were cut for content seem like new jokes.

I can't imagine anyone is unfamiliar with the plot (such as it is), but by way of a brief summary, a passenger jet is in trouble when the entire flight crew, and many of the passengers, fall ill from the in flight meal.  It's up to Ted Striker to bring down the plane safely; but there's just one problem, he hasn't been able to fly since his last abortive raid during ""the war"".  Oh, and his estranged girlfriend is one of the stewardesses.  However, where a disaster film would turn this into an overwrought melodrama, absolutely nothing, and I do mean nothing, is taken seriously in ""Airplane"".

In fact, it is almost remarkable how much is packed into this film.  Literally every scene contains a joke or a sight gag or a double entendre.  There's so much going on that in spite of dozens of viewings, I still find something new more often than not.  Eve the sound effects are a gag, as all of the exterior shots of the plane (which is a model that is so fake it's hilarious) feature the sound of a prop plane even though it is obviously a jet.

The DVD doesn't have much to recommend it other than the film, but that's to be expected from an older, relatively low budget movie; and those who have seen it would agree, there can't have been much left on the cutting room floor to make up extra features.  The image and sound are fine, if not spectacular, but then neither needs to be.  However, having the film in widescreen is nice because some of the wide angle shots now contain people that weren't visible in the fullscreen version familiar to TV viewers.

In the end, ""Airplane"" may very well be the king of movie satires.  From start to finish it is a non-stop joke reel, and the amazing thing is that they are all still funny years after the first viewing.  Fans of the movie will find this DVD to be adequate, as the transfer and sound are fine, but don't count on any new material or amazing extras.  However, as I said before, I don't think this is a movie that needs a lot of extras, and the film alone is well worth the very reasonable price.

251903,5,6300213986,"Since its release in 1980, AIRPLANE! has enjoyed a reputation as being something of a comedy classic. All by itself, it invented the genre of the laffaminit movie spoof, and it did so in brilliant style. I remember that the first time I saw this---as a young, immature teenager---I simply couldn't stop laughing. From its great takeoff of SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE to Leslie Nielsen's dead-on seriocomic turn as Dr. (""Shirley"") Rumack, this movie really made me laugh consistently from start to finish.

 It is on the basis of that first experience that I give this movie five stars. I would also add that this is a movie that does not stand repeated viewing very well. Watch it more than once, and perhaps you'll start wincing at the really stupid jokes a lot more than you did the first time, when the film's comic momentum carried you right past even its dumbest sight gags. This is really a movie to enjoy only once or twice, since a lot of the jokes have the potential to grow old after a while. (While I enjoy this kind of no-brainer movie spoof on occasion, there is no doubt that smarter, more incisive movie satires like SCREAM tend to last a lot longer.) That aside, AIRPLANE! is still a genuinely funny 88-minute slice of comic heaven, and as such is certainly worth a look for anyone looking to laugh, and laugh a lot.

251904,5,6300213986,"Airplane was released in theatres in 1980 and was in production in 1979. Evidently, ""Airplane"" was a spoof of the 70's disaster film ""Airport."" This movie was an original concept in comedy at the time that made way for future spoof movies as the Scary Movie series in recent years and the Naked Gun movies in the 90's. Stars Robert Hays, Julia Hagerty, Leslie Nielsen and Peter Graves with a special appearance by Lakers player Kareem Abdul Jabaar. Leslie Nielsen would move on to doing other such comic films, particularily at home with the Nake Gun series and Spy Hard.
The movie was a comic farewell to the 70's, a milieu which this movie holds on to visually- disco music, including a scene ripped off from Saturday Night Fever in which Robert Hays and Julia Hagerty dance while two women fight each other at a disco/bar. The comedy is non-stop and everything is a gag or joke, written into the script. Highlights include  an elderly white lady who can speak Jibe or black street slang, Ted and Elaine in an African village as part of a peace corps mission. Ted is teaching the native men how to play basketball while Elaine demonstrates Tupperware to the village women. The movie is cartoonish, over-the-top, silly but lots of fun.

A classic performance from Leslie Nielsen doesn't hurt, either.  Even though this movie spoofed some of the biggest movies of its time period, the fact that Airplane! is remembered just as fondly (if not ""fondlier"") is testament to how great this film is.

251906,5,6300213986,"I have always felt that even the best parodies (like most Mel Brooks' films) tend to run out of gas once the novelty wears off. The reason AIRPLANE does not run out of jet fuel is that it embraces so many different forms and films to sustain its energy and comedy. Obviously, there are parodies of the disaster films that proliferated in the 70s. But AIRPLANE also parodies love stories (""Casablanca"", ""From Here to Eternity"", ""Love Story"") and countless soap operas. Then there are parodies of individual movie scenes, especially the gut-splitting ""Saturday Night Fever"" parody.
And the cast is filled with So-called second-tier stars like Leslie Neilsen, Lloyd Bridges, and Robert Stack, all of whom do a great job, and are great sports to poke fun of their usual roles. Cameos abound, but nothing is funnier than Barbara Billingsley (yes, June Cleaver) as a jive-interpretor.

A totally implausible story strewn with punny lines, and shameless sideswiping of almost EVERY other disaster movie of the era finds, Robert Hayes, Julie Hagerty, and Leslie Nielsen (prior to his screen rebirth in a comic capacity) aboard flight 209 to Chicago, encumbered with just about every possible disaster from food poisoning to strung out air traffic controllers, they must somehow save the plane and passengers. Subplots a plenty ensue and look out for brilliant cameos from Lloyd Bridges, and Robert Stack playing such ridiculous characters with deadpan sincerity, it's all enough to make you laugh out loud. The sight gags come thick and fast and you will find yourself watching this movie over and over and seeing things you have missed in previous viewings, from the sublime to the ridiculous. Rightfully named in a recent poll of top comedy movies, this is perhaps one of the best offerings from the Abrahams / Zucker / Zucker team, who arguably peeked with this movie, albeit one of their first.

The movie does not have to be held together by bad running jokes, because there are so many new, good ones all the time.  Not only are the jokes timed so perfectly, but the humor itself is just plain witty, and, my favorite, literal.  I mean, the movie is about a sickness that debilitates the pilots and half, or at least whoever ate fish, of the passengers.  That is not funny, as it would normally stand, but if you throw in the creativity of the jokes then it is very funny, and should be to anybody.  Even the ones that, once we tap into the writer's literal comedic minds, seem obvious are still funny and fresh.  Now I admit, that I do not find it perfect in everyway, but that is probably an oversight on my part.  I honestly wanted even more laughs, but I maybe am just too hard to please.

251941,5,6300213986,"The collaborative comedy writing team of Jerry Zucker-Jim Abrahams-David Zucker (also known as Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker or, alternatively, ""The ZAZ Boys""), who had previously written the hilarious and irreverent THE KENTUCKY FRIED MOVIE (1977), made its directorial debut in 1980 with the even more hysterical AIRPLANE! (which they, of course, also wrote). To say that this team made the single biggest mark on feature comedy since the Marx brothers is no exaggeration. It was a new type of comedy whose only close approximations up to that point were the zany (and also incredibly funny) Mel Brooks films THE PRODUCERS (1968), BLAZING SADDLES (1974), YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN (also 1974), SILENT MOVIE (1976) and HIGH ANXIETY (1978). However, with AIRPLANE! the ZAZ boys delivered a comedy that was more rapid-fire, that had literally a gag or two per second (sometimes several), that not only did it make people's sides ache, but also made it impossible for everybody to catch all of the gags in one viewing, especially because they were too busy laughing out loud to notice much of the crazy stuff going on in the background!
What more can I really say about AIRPLANE!? It is the laughs, including the peripheral ones, that have kept comedy film fans coming back for more since 1980. Not only are there people who have seen AIRPLANE! literally hundreds of times on VHS and DVD (and claim to still find new things in it that they never before noticed), but this movie's immense popularity (the DVD is currently the 318th most popular item on Amazon; now, that's what I call staying power!) spawned a new wave of zany ""spoof comedies"" by the ZAZ team (TOP SECRET, 1984; THE NAKED GUN films in 1988, 1991 and 1994, respectively), Jim Abrahams solo (HOT SHOTS!, 1991; HOT SHOTS! PART DEUX, 1993; MAFIA!, 1998), Garry Marshall (YOUNG DOCTORS IN LOVE, 1982), the Wayans brothers (SCARY MOVIE, 2000; SCARY MOVIE 2, 2001) and many poor imitators. Some of these films are nearly as funny and inventive (see THE NAKED GUN series), while others are not (see YOUNG DOCTORS IN LOVE---or, better yet, don't see it); however, most of us will agree that the hits far outweigh the misses, and make us grateful that this type of comedy exists. It may be overdone sometimes, but that's Hollywood for you! (By the way, I'm not among those who have seen it hundreds of times; although I do find something new in AIRPLANE! every time I watch it, I've probably seen it on a total of only about ten occasions.)
Besides creating new, fertile breeding ground for the spoof sub-genre of comedy, AIRPLANE! provided a most plum starring role for the then-relatively-unknown Robert Hays (who had just come out of the failed 1979 Donna Pescow-starring TV sitcom ""Angie""), who completely shines here in his hilarious deadpan role of Ted Striker, an old fighter pilot with 'a drinking problem' who boards a big passenger airplane on which his ex-girlfriend Elaine (a wonderful Julie Hagerty) works as a flight attendant, and who has recurring nightmares of when he served under Captain Rex Kramer (a hilariously deadpan Robert Stack), and...I could go on and on, and I won't because it's beside any point. Let's just say that the extremely diverse cast (Lloyd Bridges, Leslie Nielsen, Peter Graves, basketball legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, June Cleaver legend Barbara Billingsley, etc.), who combine to spoof the AIRPORT and other airline-disaster films of the '70's out of existence, are used to such incredible effect that it makes me want to hug the ZAZ guys for all their brilliantly twisted filmmaking talents.
Unfortunately, this DVD version doesn't give us anything new. That's okay, though, as AIRPLANE! is one of those rare movies that doesn't actually ""need"" special features (although it still would have been nice). If you haven't seen this film in a long time, then I encourage you to revisit it. Feel free to show it to your kids (just keep in mind that this movie was a hard ""PG"" in its day and would have easily earned a PG-13 rating today, with its raunchy language and partial nudity, so it's not really for most kids under the age of 10).  As for you, it's bound to make you roll on the floor laughing again, and brighten up your day!

251942,5,6300213986,"Airplane! (1980) is the second collaboration of the Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker team (the first being Kentucky Fried Movie) that would later bring us such brilliant spoofery as Police Sqaud, Top Secret!, & the Naked Gun films.  ZAZ's Airplane (along with the master, Mel Brooks) is responsible for basically popularizing (if not starting) the spoof genre with it's joke a minute style.  It was the first film directed by the ZAZ team as well, because they served as writers on their first film, a series of sketches called the Kentucky Fried Movie.  Airplane also gave Leslie Nielsen (Dr. Rumack) a new identity as a comedian, which led to his starring role as Lt. Frank Drebin on the hilarious, but shortlived (only 6 episodes) 1982 series Police Squad and the later more successful Naked Gun trilogy.  Nielsen along with Peter Graves (Capt. Oveur), Llyod Bridges (McCrosky), and Robert Stack (Capt. Rex Cramer) are all scene stealers in Airplane because of the way they play it straight.  Meaning they recite the most hilarious stuff with a straight face.  I've always thought Leslie Nielsen especially was just perfect for this type of humor.  Robert Hays (Striker) & Julie Hagerty (Elaine) are also hilarious as the former couple who join together to save the plane and its passengers from almost certain disaster.  There's really too many characters to list, you just have to see it to appreciate them all.  Airplane is just a classic comedy.  The AFI calls it ""One of the top 10 funniest movies ever made!"" and I usually don't agree with most quotes, but that ranking is totally justified. Airplane begat one sequel, fittingly named Airplane II: The Sequel in 1982, but without the ZAZ team's contributions.  The sequel was directed by Ken Finkleman, who's only other work I'm familiar with being the writer of Grease 2!  Don't let that stop you from seeking out the sequel because honestly it feels like it was made by the same guys.  Plus William Shatner is in it so come on!
Some comments on the 2000 Paramount DVD:  One reviewer stated there are scenes missing from the DVD, but they're mistaken.  According to that review, the scene where the little girl tells the boy how she likes her coffee and the scenes where the woman who ""hasn't been with a man before"" have been removed, but I can tell you, having just purchased this DVD that the the boy and girl drinking coffee scene is there.  The other scenes with the woman telling every man that sits next to her ""I've never been with a man before."" are from Airplane II: The Sequel.  I haven't noticed anything missing from my original VHS version.
Other DVD notes:
The 2000 Paramount DVD has the Widescreen version (16:9) of the film, which is nice to see after the full screen VHS tapes for all these years.  You can also see things better like McCrosky standing next to the picture of himself on the wall.  The sound offered is Dolby Digital English 5.1 Surround and French Mono.  There are also English subtitles.  The main two features are the original trailer (which gives away plenty of good jokes) and a group commentary with Zucker, Abrahams, Zucker, and producer Jon Davison.  This isn't the most exciting commentary ever, but there are some interesting insights into the film and they're having fun talking about it.  I agree with other reviews that the film deserved a Special Edition (at least as good as the Up In Smoke DVD) with all the scenes filmed for the TV version and anything else from interviews and featurettes, but having this movie in widescreen DVD is enough to make me excited and with the commentary and original trailer it makes an above average release.  Bottom line:  No original theatrical scenes are missing from this DVD and it's inexpensive, so fans should pick it up.

(1980).  Made as a comedy and is a take-off from the film ZERO HOUR (1957). Also made for those who have seen the ""Airport"" films.

  There is an all-star cast with so many sight gags and jokes going on, you might have to see this film twice...maybe thrice.  All star cast includes: Robert Hays, Julie Hagerty, Lorna Patterson, with David Leisure, Peter Graves, Kareem Abdul-Jabar, Ann M. Nelson, Joyce Bulifant, Jill Whelan, Maureen McGovern, Ethel Merman, James Hong, Leslie Nielsen, Lloyd Bridges, Barbara Stuart, Robert Stack, James Emmett, Barbara Billingsly and many more.  Filmed in Metrocolor like Airport (1970) was.

This movie was chosen to be preserved and was added to the National Film  Registry in 2010 by the United States National Film Preservation Board.

251946,5,6300213986,"Airplane! is a film graced with such tremendous comic energy that it is likely to have even the sternest of audience members reaching for an air bag. Arriving in theaters in 1980, the movie is the ultimate parody of every ridiculous trend and fad of the previous decade, including religious activism, rampant drug use, disco and especially popular disaster films. Although it can't be said to be a technilogically or intellectually advanced film, or even one blessed with a great deal of coherence and tastefulness, directors Jim Abrahams, David Zucker and Jerry Zucker (the ZAZ team) have filled the screen with enough outrageous jokes, sight gags and offbeat set pieces to make such omissions reasonable, if not entirely forgivable.
The movie's skimpy story is stolen almost verbatim from the numerous disater epics of the 70's: when the entire crew of an airliner is incapacitated, ex-pilot Ted Stryker (Robert Hays) and his former girlfriend Elaine Dickinson (Julie Hagerty) are forced to overcome their differences in an effort to land the plane safely. The filmmakers deserve tremendous credit for taking such a tired and preposterous storyline and reinventing it through several brilliant satiric touches. The flight crew is incapacitated not by typical bombs or explosions, but by a severe case of food poisoning caused by rancid fish. One of the backup pilots called to take over in the pilot's absence is in fact an anthropomorphic blow-up toy with an insatiable appetite for women. And the passengers on board are not predictable screaming harpies, but perhaps the single quirkiest assortment of people ever brought together in one place: two jive talking black men who actually need subtitles to be understood by the audience (except Leave it Beavers Barbara Billingsley!), a nine year old girl who tells her young suitor that she prefers her coffee black, like my men, a stately old woman who snorts cocaine when no one is looking, and a woman so sick that eggs literally pop out of her mouth.
Several well-known dramatic actors play an assortment of oddballs and lunatics in this film, and their natural dignity makes the absurdity of their characters far more striking and humorous. Llyod Bridges is fantastic as a flight engineer so rattled by the madness in the air that he resorts to drinking, smoking, drug use and glue sniffing just to retain his composure, and Robert Stack shines as a domineering airforce captain who gleefully attacks a bothersome group of religious zealots that prevent him from reaching a control tower. And who could forget Leslie Nielsen launching his comedy career (after 25 years of playing dramatic roles) as the gloriously deadpan Dr. Rumack? My favorite supporting performance still remains Peter Graves fearless work as Clarence Oveur, a role that required him to barrage a small boy with the most uproarious pedophilic overtures in film history (Do you enjoy Gladiator movies?).
In addition to all previously mentioned hilarity, this film also contains clever parodies of Saturday Night Fever and From Here to Eternity, a creative interpretation of a ""drinking problem,"" and a cameo by Ethel Merman as a shell-shocked pilot! Ultimately, Airplane! stands as one of those rare motion picture where all the creative components come together to transform an infantile farce into a comedy classic. It is a movie to be enjoyed more than once, first for the sheer enjoyment of the material, and again to revel at the amount of humor and oddness the directors managed to squeeze into every frame.",1072224000,4,3539,5.1139896373057
251947,5,6300213986,"23 years later, this movie still maintains the frenetic pace, the countless sight gags, and the manicly sustained performances of actors you never thought could be so funny:  Lloyd Bridges, Robert Stack, Peter Graves, specifically.  This time around try and catch all the little sight gags:  the washing machine at the control boards; the endless control board on the plane that includes stereo equipment; there's so many.  And relish in the performances of Stephen Stucker as the manic Johnny; Lorna Patterson as Randy, the other flight attendant; Leslie Nielsen's Dr. Surely.

251979,5,6300213986,"'Airplane' is a classic of comedy. I first saw it in the theater as a teen, and have watched it every couple of years since. It's true that the gags are shopworn now, but they are assembled in such a fun and politically incorrect way, that they never cease to amuse. One reviewer sniffed that he had tired of them and made a point of complaining about people quoting lines from the film in everyday conversation, which I find difficult to believe: I'm an airline pilot and all of us know these lines, but only extremely rarely do we actually hear them. If this is really a problem for him, I suggest that maybe he not watch the film anymore since he apparently doesn't like it; as for those of us who do enjoy it, have at it.
I hope that there is an enhanced DVD offered in the future; I would be especially interested in hearing interviews with Robert Hays and Julie Hagerty. As it is, though, the disk isn't totally unrewarding. There is a copy of the original promotional trailer, and there is a wonderful option to have the Zuckers and Jim Abrahams voice over the film commenting on various issues. For instance, did you know that:
-David Letterman screen tested for the movie?
-It took only 34 days to make the entire film?
-Kareem Abdul-Jabbar did the movie for $30,000, which he invested in a new toupee?
-That Maureen McGovern was the nun?
-The Zucker's Mom was the notorious 'makeup lady' who had extreme mascara emergencies?
The list goes on and on. It was fascinating listening to the filmmakers discuss the making of the film. I can't believe that this much comic greatness cost under $3.5 million to make. Until the special edition comes out buy the DVD and watch it; it truly doesn't go out of style.",1068249600,,1714,4.514469453376206

This is a rare example of a comedy classic that grabs you from the beginning and holds you in stitches until the very end (and I mean the end, you have to read all the credits and wait for the final joke AFTER the credits are done!). If you've never seen this film, see it! If you have fond memories of it from almost 25 years ago, it will still tickle your funny bone.",1059523200,,638,3.877862595419847
251983,5,6300213986,"This is a great spoof style comedy that makes fun of both the 70s genre of disaster flicks as well as a few popular fads of this time (John Travolta's dance scene in Saturday Night Fever).  Even if this movie is ""before-your-time"", you can still get a lot of laughs. Among other things, this makes fun of the serious romantic situations that are plugged into many dramas (for instance, the girl with the long goodbye to the soldier leaving, the island scene where two individuals fall in love, the man telling his life story of love to everyone he meets, etc).
Robert Hays plays Ted Striker, a pilot in the army who is trying to regain love for Elaine (Julie Hagerty), a stewardess. There is actually a story to the movie, but there are so many funny jokes and bits added in that it almost becomes a secondary element.
Silliness reigns supreme. The three pilots names are Victor, Clearance and Roger (""That's a roger, Roger....What's our vector, Victor?...Do we have clearance?, etc). Deadpan-serious Leslie Neilson is also amoung the cast, playing a doctor on board (Surely, you can't be serious. Neilson's response: I am serious. And don't call me Shirley.). There is also a hilarious scene with Barbara Billingsley (Beaver's mom on Leave it to Beaver), in which she attempts to help a situation by offering to speak jive (""Oh stewardess, I speak jive.""). Robert Stack plays a former pilot that worked with Striker in the army, and tries to talk him down and build up his confidence to land the plane. Lloyd Bridges plays the man at control who barks orders at everyone, becomes stressed out, and has a running joke about all the things he shouldn't of given up this week (smoking, drinking, etc).
Overall, a hilarious spoof. This really was the first of its kind; many spoofs that have come out since have followed the same type of formula for making fun of movies and shows. I highly reccomend giving this one a try.",1058659200,3,1920,4.6973293768546
251984,5,6300213986,"Hard to add anything to what's been said about this classic.
I've seen this movie more times than I can remember.  It still holds up, having just watched the DVD again recently, some 20+ years after my first viewing.  I know this movie shot-by-shot, line-by-line, every nuance.  That's what happens after dozens of viewings over many years.  But I'd say that it would easily take 10 or so viewings to catch all the gags.  And the success rate of said gags is probably higher than in any movie I've ever seen.
The dvd itself is a pretty basic, though still worthy, release.  I didn't seen Airplane! in the theaters, so after countless videotape viewings it was most definitely a treat to see it presented widescreen.
I must say the commentary, featuring ZAZ and the film's producer, is one of - if not THE - funniest tracks I've listened to.  And for that reason, this DVD is essential even if you feel you've seen Airplane! enough times.  These guys have a great time during the commmentary, and their fun and laughter is contagious.  Usually, I find it annoying when the commentator(s) sit and laugh at their own jokes, but in this case it works-- because their jokes are extremely funny.
Downside:  Where are the deleted scenes featured in the network TV version?  I don't want them re-edited into the feature, but a 'deleted/alternate scenes' section would have been great.  All throughout the commentary track, the guys talk about the additional footage.  I know Paramount hasn't had a great track record for Special Edition materials (though they have gotten much better recently), but I think they really dropped the ball by not giving us this material that was apparently readily available.

251987,5,6300213986,"In the 1970's, Hollywood created an endless stream of disaster movies. Having found a ""winning formula"" they latched onto it and milked it for every penny producing disaster flick after disaster flick until it all became a joke onto itself. Enter Airplane. The result of a couple of guys who, seeing all these airplane disaster movies thought it had all gotten so ridiculous that the entire genre was a joke, a brilliant idea was born. Enter the era of the spoof.
Today we take spoofs for granted but back then the idea was brand new, and thats what makes Airplane such a brilliant masterpeice, it literally spawned a whole new genre of movies that is being copied this very day. Naked gun, or Scary movie would not exist today without Airplane, and yet, Airplane is funnier than every other spoof ever made even all these years later.
Put simply, this movie is non stop rapidfire comedy. It's saturday night live on qualudes. It's nonstop wisecracks and jokes and gags. If you like intelligent critical movies, run away...quickly. This is not your movie.
If however you enjoy pure slapstick a la three stooges, just pure bumbling humour. Totally idiotic side gags. This is your dream come true. This is more than likely the most hillarious movie ever made. It's become a classic like Gone with the wind or the godfather, but for Comedies, and with good reason. The jokes simply are nonstop beggining to end. Right from the opening scene with the Hare Krishna's at the airport until the autopilot waving goodbye in the end scene. The movie simply does not stop for even an instant. At certain points you literally have to stop laughing even if you think a joke is funny just to breath. Don't expect brilliant writting here, it's all slapstick but it REALLY is hillarious stuff. The guys who did this by the way have gone on to write many of hollywoods great comedic scenes and we can see their raw talent to great effect here, completely unrestrained.

1) You have to watch more than once to catch what you missed while laughing, and
2) Never gets old no matter how many times you watch it.
The story involves a former military pilot, Ted Stryker (Hays), who follows his lost love, Elaine (Hagerty) onto an airplane she works on as a stewardess.

The best momoments are stuffed with inspired slapstick, bad puns and enough bad taste to capture your attention. Without Mel Brooks, Airplane wouldn't exist. The film owes a big debt to Brooks' classics Blazing Saddles, Young Frankenstein and Silent Movie. Without Airplane and the Zucker-Abrahams collaboration, the Farrelly brothers wouldn't exist.

It's pretty much a parody of 1970s disaster movies (and the 1950s one ""Zero Hour""). Revealing any more of the plot would be irrelevant. It does have some interesting actors (Leslie Nielson, Peter Graves, Lloyd Bridges, Robert Stack).
The DVD generally looks a little soft and grainy, but it still looks better than previous video and TV editions. On the extras front, there is a very funny audio commentary by (hold your breath) John Davidson, Jerry Zucker, David Zucker, and Jim Abrahams, in which they pretty much act bored through. There is also a theatrical trailer (which actually reveals all the best gags). The big shame here is that some of the deleted scenes mentioned in the commentary (there are quite a few) aren't included.

252034,5,6300213986,"Over the years there have been a bunch of ""spoof"" films, characterised mostly by an incredible unevenness: zero plot, huge gag rate, low strike rate, designed mostly to cash in on lame send ups with no other point or broader picture...The result is that the genre - which can be done very well indeed (Peter Jackson's Forgotten Silver and Rob Reiner's Spinal Tap are standout examples) has largely now been trashed.
Airplane is, in some respects, the guilty party - without it, the Scary Movies of this world would never have been conceived, let alone made - but for all that it is an excellent movie, and in my book deserves a place alongside Duck Soup and Spinal Tap as one of the best comedies ever made.
It has all the trappings that go with the Zucker-Abrahams formula, only undiluted: for once, you don't have to sit through 20 minutes of lame script for the odd smile: the hit rate for the gags is pretty much 100%. And the best of the lines are simply priceless: Captain Oveur's dialogue with young Joey; the Jives and their elderly translator; Robert Stack's martial arts scene with the moonies in the airport terminal, and of course Lloyd Bridge's wrong week for giving everything up.
Where I think it also is superior is that it does actually have a plot and functions very well as a genuine disaster movie: it's a seemingly obvious point, but none of the imitators have managed this.
I suspect most people in the world have seen Airplane two or three times, and even for them I'd recommend the DVD - it's certainly a film which bears watching more than once - and for those of you who have never seen it, then boy are you in for a treat.",1046908800,4,1649,4.5
252035,5,6300213986,"There are very few movies that I have to watch multiple times just to hear the jokes I laughed too loud through the first time to catch them.  Airplane, like Ghostbusters, is such a film.  There are so many jokes, some stupid, some deep, some sly, some broad slapstick, some just downright dumb, that you cannot keep count of them all.
This is the movie that jumpstarted Lelie Nielsen's career, for good or for ill.  Moving away from his days as a two-bit heavy, Nielsen found whoopee cushions and never looked back.  It was the genius of ZAZ to realize what they had with him and with the rest of the cast -- many of these folks had played straight roles for so long that that was the only thing most people could imagine them playing.  And somehow each of them pulled up genius comic timing by playing themselves straight.
This is a parody, a parody of all the Big Disaster films of the 70s, but also with nods to war films, medical dramas, T&A films, and even singing nuns.  This is a film where there are subtitles for Jive.  This is a film that pulls out every bad situation ever put into a 70s hack drama, added in religious visions, air-headedness, poo-poo humuour, strange social commentary, and then turned the blender up to ""Annihilate"".
It is hard to write a clear review of a film that is essentially a string of shaggy dogs and one-liners.  What I can say is that this is a film that can be watched multiple times and you will still be able to find new jokes.  ""Hey, I didn't hear that one last time!""  This film may be compared favourably with Ghostbusters, Duck Soup, and This Is Spinal Tap.  If those are films that you liked, try this.

Airplane is a spoof of a disaster flick, and the main character is a man who was a pilot who is afraid to get into a plane.  When he gets on the plane, it is found out that the fish has been poisoned, and all of the pilots ate fish.
The main role is played by Robert Hays, who has a great performance as the World War 2 pilot, Ted Striker.  When all of the pilots die from food poisoning, he is looked to to take over as the pilot of the plane.  Ever since some nasty experiences in World War 2, Ted has been horrified of planes.  When he was in that war, his mistake led to seven pilots' deaths.  But, his girlfriend, Elaine Dickenson, is on that plane, and he would really like to be with her once again.  ""I can't tell you that.  Classified.""
The stewardess on the plane, Elaine Dickenson, is portrayed by Julie Hagerty.  She is a young woman who knew Ted and who had just broke up with him before he followed her onto the flight.  ""A hospital?  What is it?""
Leslie Nielsen acts out Dr. Rumack.  This movie was actually the start of Nielsen's comedy career, and his performance is simply outstanding.  He is a medicinal doctor, and he says that the passengers must be taken to a hospital.  Unfortunately, this is almost impossible when nobody is flying the plane.  ""I just want to wish you good luck.  We're all counting on you.""
The funniest role, Johnny, is performed by Stephen Stucker.  He works at the airplane station, and he has the most memorable lines by far.  If you don't laugh at him anytime in the whole movie, you don't have a sence of humor.  ""The tower?  Rapunzel! Rapunzel!"", ""It looks like a big Tylenol!""
There is a cameo in this movie, and it is the pilot ""Roger Murdock,"" played by Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.  Some kid comes up to the cockpit and keeps telling him that he has to play better, because his dad says so.  ""TO HELL I DON'T!""
My last honorary mention is a tie between Norman Alexander Gibbs and Al White.  They play the Jive dudes, and all they can speak is Jive.  The subtitles speak for them, but you should look somewhere online to find what they are actually saying, either that or put closed caption on while they're speaking.  They are very hard to understand, but that's what the part is, and they're perfect at it. ""See a broad, to get that booty yak 'em,  Leg 'er down 'n smack 'em yak 'em!""
This movie is rated PG for crude humor, language, sexual content, and nudity.  I would recommend this for ages 13 and up.
This was a great movie.",1045699200,3,2532,4.309322033898305

Airplane is what I've said in the title of this here review, but it is more than this. This is also the first comedy DVD I've seen. My favorite character had to be the pilot, played by Peter Graves, I do believe. He gave some of the best lines of the movie, especially when the little boy who comes into the cockpit, and the pilot says, ""Have you ever been in a cockpit before?"", and the little boy says, ""I've never been in a cockpit before"", and the pilot says, ""Have you ever seen a grown man naked""? Hilarious! I believe this was the first movie that the Zuckers and that other guy had ever worked on, with this kind of comedy, and whatnot, and I do believe the other ones such as Naked Gun, Hot Shots, and the other ones came later, so you prob don't know what to expect. If you have seen the others one, then you know what to expect. The final verdict: Buy. You won't be dissapointed. P.S.

252074,5,6300213986,"Airplane! was recently called ""One of the top ten funniest movies of all time."" This is very well deserved. Airplane is a film that keeps throwing gags at us and we all keep laughing so hard that by the time we've finished the movie we have to catch our breath. A absoloutley hilarious joke comes, we laugh, we start to stop laughing, and another one comes that's even funnier than the one before it and we laugh before we can catch our breath! It takes strong comic talent for a movie to keep us laughing like that! Let's explore this classic spoof film.
Flight 209 is heading to Chicago. It's March 5th and Elaine Dickenson (Julie Hagerty) has just run away from her ex-boyfriend Ted Striker (Robert Hays). However, Ted comes home early, finds her note, and speeds to the airport to stop her before she gets on the flight and intends to change her life in Chicago. His attempts to get her back fail, so he follows her on the plane, haunted by flashbacks of his expierience in the war, where he lost most of his squadron while on a foolish attack. Bad luck takes the day when all the pilots become very ill courtesy of food-poisoning in the fish. Even more bad luck comes when passengers start getting sick for the same reason and now it's up to Ted to land the plane with the help of his ex-girlfriend, a doctor (Leslie Nielson), stewardess Randy (Lorna Patterson), a loony air-port controller by the name of McCroskey (Lloyd Bridges), and and old friend (?) from the war, Rex Cramer (Robert Stack).
It may sound serious, but not one thing is meant to be taken seriously in this unbelievably hilarious film. Every shot (yes) has something funny in it, whether it is subtle (the air-plane makes a propellor blade noise) or some very out-in-the-open ones I will not give away. Let's just say, watching this movie may be the most hilarious expierience of your life.
All the actors are right on. Delighfully acting serious amidst all the slap-stick things going on, it's pitch perfect. Robert Hays is swell as paranoid Striker, and Hagerty is good as his ex, but those who deserve special recognition are surely Leslie Nielson (Don't call me Shirley!), Lloyd bridges (Look's like I picked the wrong week to quit smoking), Robert Stack (No, that's just what they'll be expecting us to do!) and Steven Stucker as the clueless Johnny (Oh, it's a big pretty white plane with red stripes and curtains in the windows and wheels, and it looks like a big tylenol). But this an excellent cast.
The directing is handled by the now famous Zucker brothers and Abraham, whose only previous film was The Kentucky Fried Movie. The directing is very Zucker, Abrahams, Zucker, which means HILARIOUS. Knowing what they're doing, they're the ones who wrote this beautiful script!
The DVD for the film is a cut above most Paramount features, but still seriously lacking, especially for such a classic film. There's a commentary by the director's that runs out of steam after about half an hour (it's one of those commentaries where they say they're gonna talk about a certain thing and never do). The commentary was a big dissipointment for me, because I expected info on how a lot of gags got thought up. Nothing like that here. A trailer is also included, but it's very long and ruins a lot of the funniest moments by putting them along with stupid music and making the movie look very unfunny.
The presentation quality of the film is actually very good, though. The picture is not bad at all, much brighter than the mushy presentations of previous video and TV incarnations of the film. The grain has been very reduced to a minimum and the quality is very good for a 22 year old movie. The sound is a new remastered 5.1 surround that gets the job done admirably. After videos that would go from LOUD LOUD LOUD to quiet quiet quiet, this new sound is great. Well-balanced and with the music well-placed and the voices clear, you'll love the new sound (why Paramount's Friday The 13th movies are getting treated with Mono soundtracks is beyond me).
However, a complaint I hold against this DVD the most is- where are those TV scenes? When the movie plays on TV, it includes some cool extra scenes that extend the running time and add some more laughs. They include more scenes with the little kids acting like adults and more scenes with Kareem Abdul Jabbar, Robert Hays and Julie Hagery, as well as Robert Stack and Lloyd Bridges. They are nowhere on this DVD. BIG dissipointment. I don't think Paramount quite get the point of DVD. They re supposed to be movies on disks with superior picture and sound quality as well as interesting behind the scenes features and DELETED SCENES. Anyway, that's the big thing missing on this DVD.
Airplane was followed by a sequel, Airplane 2 The Sequel which failed to keep the laughs the original had going and usually recycled stuff from the first film with new actors. Also, it missed a lot of great characters from th original. Leslie Nielson, Robert Stack, Lorna Patterson, a lot of people missing from the sequel. That movie is good fun, there are some good laughs, but the original will always be the best. Period.",1024876800,15,5137,4.652365236523653
252075,5,6300213986,"This movie is so many things:  unrepentantly dumb, excruciatingly silly, utterly without shame in doing absolutely anything to get a laugh.  No movie ever made has as many jokes as this one, and even if half of them fail, the other half cannot fail but delight all but the dullest and most serious of souls.  So many of the jokes in this film have become part of the odd vocabulary of my laugh.  If I meet someone named Clarence, I have to repress the desire to ask, ""Do we have clearance, Clarence?""  And though I am about the most drug free person in America, at frustrating moments I have often said, ""What a week to give up sniffing glue.""  And who can think of gladiator movies, blow up dolls, singing nuns, Hare Krishnas, sunglasses, red/white zones, anyone named Victor, war trauma, meters running on cabs, drinking problems, or, of course, anyone named Shirley in the same way after this movie?
The movie isn't perfect, but who the [heck] cares?  I have seen my fair share of ""art"" films and black and white films (my favs primarily tend to be 30s and 40s Hollywood comedies) and subtitled imports, but there is a lot to be said for a film that just wants to make us laugh like mad.

252076,5,6300213986,"Jim Abrahams and the Brothers Zucker, a/k/a the Unholy Trio, are responsible for this belly-laugh-a-minute film that is one of the funniest movies ever to come out of Hollywood.  It has the most fragile excuse for a plot and doesn't need much more.  From the wacky opening sequence (the theater audience where I first saw this movie fell into the aisles when the theme from ""Jaws"" started playing and the plane's tail see-sawed ominously through the clouds), to the hilarious credits (be sure to stick around for these), the movie goes from one laugh to the next and never lets up.  ""Airplane!"" spawned the spoof genre, and it's still the best of the pack.  The movie lambastes airline disaster films, TV commercials, Hollywood blockbusters, airline food (wouldn't you know the fish would go bad?), Tupperware parties, religious nuts, and about everything else you can think of.  The actors, most of them strangers to comedy, seem to be having the time of their lives.  There are a couple of scenes that gave this movie a PG rating (a topless lady in the mass hysteria scene when Julie Hagerty asks the passengers via the PA system if anybody on board knows how to fly a plane, and a priceless scene when Hagerty has to give emergency service to Otto, the plane's automatic pilot), but actually this film is nothing a 6th grader couldn't watch.  My son saw it when he was 11 and hit the floor laughing, along with everyone else in the theater.  The movie doesn't even pretend to take itself seriously; it's an hour and a half of pure unadulterated fun.  Grab the popcorn, sit back and enjoy the ride of your life.

The basic concept of this film is pure genius.

Hearing ""Joey, have you ever seen a grown man naked?"" or ""looks like I picked the wrong week to quit sniffing glue"" from someone like Bill Murray would have been good, but having it come from Peter Graves and Lloyd Bridges is what makes it great. It's about hilarious dialogue and ludicrous scenes all being played with a perfectly straight face. And add to that a terrific soundtrack, with corny sounding ""disaster movie"" music playing at all the appropriate moments and a host of ""minor"" characters (""Excuse me stewardess, but I speak jive"" coming from former ""Leave it to Beaver"" Mom, Barbara Billingsley) and Stephen Stucker as the gloriously goofy and clueless air traffic controller and what you have is comedy heaven.",1022457600,3,1286,4.745535714285714

My impression may be explained by the following : There is the
kind of movie that is only funny the first time you watch it.
Then there is the kind which makes you laugh more than once
(in most cases, you will watch it again and again). Well, Airplane seems to be in between those two categories. The film is bizarre on first sight (and partially funny).

Tough to answer because I do like all films the Zuckers put out and I think the Naked Gun was a bit over done. So back to Airplane! It just hit at the right time and is as funny now as it was back then. I think adding the comedy of the film to the nostalgia I feel when I watch it now makes it that much more special.
It is about a doomed airplane flight. Everyone who has eaten bad fish on the plane will die. This includes the pilots and passengers. That is not where the comedy begins. It starts during the credits.

I have not laughed so much during a movie before or since I first saw this film in the theater and my brother and I basically did half the movie for our parents at dinner the next day.

I have seen it on TV dozens of times since the 80's, and now that I don't see it as often on TV, I rent it about once or twice a year just to get a good laugh in. Even now that I've seen it MANY times, it NEVER fails to make me laugh.
SUPER FUNNY. I don't think there is 60 seconds in this movie where something isn't happening. If the people in the foreground are being serious, WATCH THE BACKGROUND.
There are so many killer one liners in here. I don't want to give away any scenes, but the automatic pilot getting blow up, the jive dudes talking (AND the subcaptions which are NOWHERE near what they are REALLY saying), Ted Stryker boring people into suicide with his flashbacks, the disco scene, the final approach with Stryker EXCESSIVELY sweating, the perverted pilot  (Joey, have you ever seen a grown man naked?), and the lady who has convulsions and the passengers who line up to beat her.
There are just SO MANY drop dead funny scenes in this. If you need to run to the bathroom, PAUSE THE MOVIE. Guaranteed you will miss some scenes. There is no possible you can pick up everything in one sitting. In fact, after MANY rentals, just recently I found something I had missed for 15 years of watching this movie. It has THAT much hidden in it.
If you haven't seen this, you must have lived in a cave.
For anyone who likes slapstick, literal, and even some basic adult humor (you will know what I mean by the automatic pilot and Elaine sitting on Teds face), this movie will have you rolling on the floor laughing.
Too bad movies aren't still made this way. How many movies can last 20 YEAR and still be raved about? This movie is also a great cure if you are depressed. Pop it in the player and just watch it. I have seen dozens upon dozens of comedies, and this is in the top 1% of ultimate funny movies.
Reporter: What kind of plane is it? Jacobs: Oh its a really neat plane. It's white with red stripes on it, wheels and curtains in the windows. It looks like a big tylenol.
Rumack: What was it we bad for dinner tonight? Elaine: Well we had a choice, steak or fish. Rumack: Yes, yes I remember. I had lasagne.

However, I purchased the DVD to hear the Zucker/Abrahams/Zucker team provide anecdotes that enhanced my appreciation for the characters in the movie. While they did provide some relevant insight, most of the time the commentary consisted of droning on about production stories and boring talk. Towards the end of the movie the directors seem like they could care less, and in fact there are long pauses where nobody says anything. This is fine, because I love Airplane!, but it was a major diappointment because the other DVD's I have seen provide insight and enhancement to movies.
If you are interested in seeing the trailer, that is certainly a bonus, as is the ability to cut to my favorite scenes. The commentary, however, was a letdown.",982108800,7,866,4.8979591836734695

It's easy to see why the Zuckers did several more of these type features (including the unbelievalby funny ""Police Squad"" Tv show).
This is a truly hilarious film, but it is nearly impossible to get all of the jokes, gags, puns, and silliness in 1 or even 2 viewings.  This is the staying power of this film, it always brings you back looking for more stuff, and finding it.  It is truly a comedic masterpiece.
Although several movies were spoofed in ""Airplane"", the first 2 ""Airport"" movies (1970 and 1975) were really hammered.  Beginning with the opening scene of the cars pulling up to the terminal (1970) to the guitar playing nun (1975), ther is little of either film that is spared (well maybe the part about the cockpit being smashed).
This is a must-own movie for anyone with even the smallest funny bone.",980812800,8,983,4.764705882352941
252207,5,6300213986,"Airplane! is one of those movies that can never be described properly in a single review. What we have here is one seriously deranged comedy, and though most of the jokes are cheap laughs, some show tremendous subtlety and depth. The running ""What is it?"" joke is an ingeniously funny play on words, and Ted's ""drinking problem"" (splash!) is something most of us would never have imagined. A lot of the jokes work together or are seen more than once; others appear briefly but in rapid fire, so there's never a dull moment. But there are subtler jokes as well: Every time you see a shot of the jet in flight, you hear the sound of a propeller. Even the little things were attended to.
As for the performances... well, Robert Stack and Lloyd Bridges really pack in the laughs with their dead-serious attitudes amid the chaos, their characters never realizing they're as goofy as everyone else around them.
In a lot of ways what's kept Airplane! great is that later comedies didn't know how to pack in the laughs. This movie stuffed between the jokes with puns and sight gags that are more endearing than the jokes themselves. And nothing makes better spoof material than an overserious '70s disaster flick.
The features on the DVD are a little disappointing; I at least would have hoped to see deleted scenes like the ""Hijack"" scene that appears only when the film is on TV. (I understand Airplane 2: The Sequel has a similar lack of features, which is unfortunate since my favorite scene in that movie is one of those deleted scenes only shown on television.)

Names like Robert Stack, Leslie Nielson, Lloyd Bridges, Peter Graves, and Barbara Billingsly weren't exactly known for their comedy chops when this film was released.  But the dry-as-a-bone delivery and commitment to the moment make this movie shine all the way through.
The characters unwittlingly play along with the absurdity of the whole situation, never laughing at anything.  Jive-talking buddies, a perverted inflatable pilot, and (gasp) Ethel Mermon take the hilarity to new heights.  I quote more lines from this movie than any.

Who can forget these classic scenes:
Robert Hayes' drinking problem
Julie Hagerty's attempt to ""fix"" the automatic pilot
Barbara Billingsly talking jive
Robert Stack assaulting everyone in the airport
Lloyd Bridges smoking, drinking, pill popping, and glue sniffing
Ask yourself here would Leslie Neilson be today without ""Airplane""? This is the movie that spawned the entire movie spoof genre, and without a doubt the best.

252213,5,6300213986,"Airplane is one of those rare movies where you are glad that your DVD player has the capability to pause the film, thus saving you from missing anything when you get up for any reason.  I originally saw this movie in the theater and laughed myself into a near coma, but it is the ability of video and DVD to allow the viewer to repeat the film infinitum that makes you appreciate its brilliance.
There always seems to be something happening in the foreground, background, or even over the loudspeaker in the airport.  It challenges you to pick up on all of the jokes.  This isn't as easy as it sounds.  You will find yourself concentrating on the blatant jokes, puns, and groaners, but missing the subtle jokes that go on in the peripheral areas of the screen.
The use of well known ""Dramatic"" actors in the film adds to the hillarity.  They deliver the jokes in a way that makes you believe that the absurdity is normal.  This film, of course, made Leslie Nielson's career.
I own this movie on VHS and DVD and I strongly recomend that everyone who owns a DVD player add this movie to your collection.  The enhanced sound quality will ensure that you will hear all of the subtle jokes.  I rank it as my number 5 favorite comedy of all time, and my top five are very close.

I lean towards the laugh riot side. Airplane, simply put, is the best parody ever made. Yes, the jokes are stupid, but not stupid enough to be unfunny. Leave it to Beaver's mom, the airplane prop sound, the blow-up pilot...there's a lot of classic moments. Lighten up, take this movie for what it is!
Also, the ""no acting"" argument is somewhat frivilous. You can't say that a parody movie has no acting, because parodies (by nature) do not exploit the talents of actors. I'd go as far as to say that acting is completely beside the point. Also, what about Leslie Nielsen? His amazing straight-laced demeanor was the springboard for his second career.

Honestly, this is a different kind of comedy than say, The Great Race or It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World. To really appreciate all of the humor (and there is a load of humor in it) in the story, you'd have  to have seen many of the other films it spoofs. Some of these include:  Jaws, Airport and Saturday Night Fever. Quite a bit of the humor is visual  and ties in with turns of phrase by the cast.
Perhaps not a film for the  younger audiences (they wouldn't understand some of the humor - and parts  of the picture are risque), but teen-agers and up will appreciate it. Its  sequel (Airplane II), though somewhat weaker, is also good.
