This fight card presents a fairly decent night of fights leading up to a rematch long-in-the-making between Chuck Liddell and Quinton Jackson.  It is a fight card populated mostly by good fighters who (in my opinion) have very little impact on their respective divisions.

Carmello Marrero vs. Wilson Gouveia:  This one is decent and mildly entertaining, although brief.

Din Thomas vs. Jeremy Stephens: Stephens has his debut fight against a seasoned veteran in Din Thomas.  Thomas again looks very good against the only level of competition he ever truly looks good against.  I do not see him as a legit contender and he has been around forever.  He is a very talented fighter, but he has proven not to be able to stack up against the best.  This fight has absolutely no impact on the division.  Oh well...

Alan Belcher vs. Sean Salmon:  Both fighters are coming off of losses and both have a lot to prove in the UFC.  Here, only one fighter seems to fight as though he is in such a predicament.

James Irvin vs. Thiago Silva:  James Irvin is luckily injured in this fight and potentially saved from a vicious beating...  Silva is the next beast coming out of the esteemed Chute Box Academy.  We will be seeing more of him soon.

Chris Leben vs. Kalib Starnes:  If someone was to ask me to concoct a matchup between the two UFC fighters who most annoy me, this would be the result.  This fight is a snoozer and again has no impact on the division.  Don't get me wrong, the fight is pretty competitive, but it simply isn't going to have you standing up and cheering.

Houston Alexander vs. Keith Jardine:  I am sure that if you watch any UFC at all, it would not be a spoiler for me to mention that this is the most shocking moment of the night.  This fight was supposed to be a showcase fight for The Dean of Mean.  All appears to be going to plan as Jardine stuns Alexander with a shot that sends him quickly to the canvas.  What happens after that is just beautiful to watch.... WOW!

Ivan Salaverry vs. Terry Martin:  Fans may remember Salaverry from back in the UFC 50s when he was fighting and defeating the likes of Tony Fryklund and Joe Riggs with excellent submissions.  This fight pits the handy and slick Salaverry against a bull named Terry Martin. Strength vs. Experience... Who will win?  Who cares?  Just kidding... This one is not too bad.

Karo Parisyan vs. Josh Burkman:  This is NOT one of the fights that will have no impact on the division.  In this case, we have a stalwart in the division, Karo Parisyan, against a rising talent in Burkman.  Both fighters are great contenders and both are very exciting fighters.  Simply based on my view of the fighters, I would place Karo a level above Burkman prior to seeing them go at it.  This fight is definitely worth watching, but don't expect anything spectacular.

Main Event - Chuck ""The Iceman"" Liddell vs. Quinton ""Rampage"" Jackson:

This is a special moment, as I watched this fight among a room of Chuck Liddell fans.  I watch Rampage like a proud father, haha.  After having followed Jackson from as far back as King of the Cage all the way through his days with Pride FC (through all ups and downs), I believed that he was simply a better fighter than Liddell in every aspect.  I knew he had Liddell's number and that he would beat him 9 times out of 10.

Both fighters come out looking calm and focused as Couture (on commentary) predicts that Jackson will wear Chuck down by the 3rd or 4th.  I would have said the same, but instead we are treated to a calculated, hitman style stoppage.  The winner gets Dan Henderson - what a treat.

This DVD release brings a far better DVD format than previous UFC DVDs.  As always, there is some solid bonus material.  Jackson highlights this portion of the DVD, as well.",1196812800,3,3859,4.516642547033285
8207461,5,B000T28C7C,"This is one of the best UFC events I have seen in a very long time. Granted, there are some really short fights, and some people may find that to be disappointing, but even those fights have really good finishes. The only exception is the bout between Irvin and Silva, since on paper this was one of the best match-ups of the night due to the careless aggressiveness of the contestants, but an early injury concluded it before we could get what we were hoping for.

All the bouts in the main card were excellent. The weakest one was probably Leben vs. Starren, but it was still a well-rounded and evenly-matched confrontation with plenty of exciting moments. Of course the anticipation surrounding the Liddell vs. Jackson fight made it one of the highlights of the night, and even though it is a short bout, the action is electrifying. Nevertheless, I have to say that the match-up that stole the night was Parisyan vs. Berkman, with two fighters that left everything they had inside the octagon, and who demonstrated an impressive set of skills. This fight had it all, guns-blazing stand-up action, judo, ju-jitsu, you name it.

The quick decision in many of the fights forced the producers to release a product that is about thirty minutes shorter than the norm, and that is after adding stuff, like an overview of the record of each player and their previous fights, even for the undercard bouts. However, unless you are somebody that likes longer fights instead of knockouts / submissions, the overall quality of the product is outstanding.",1194048000,,1544,4.8007518796992485
8207462,5,B000T28C7C,"UFC 71 is a pretty good card overall, it has some pretty entertaining bouts. This DVD is a must buy for one reason and one reason only, the fight between the LHW Champ Chuck Liddell and the number one contender Quinton ""Rampage"" Jackson. Jackson was already 1-0 against Chuck having beat him a few years back in the Pride 2003 Gran Prix. Would he go ahead and make it 2-0 or would the Champ keep his belt? I highly recommend purchasing this event. I will personaly buy this Dvd myself and that is saying something because I only buy the good ones.",1188777600,,547,4.372549019607843

Overall, UFC 71 was a pretty good fight card.  Two fights stand out in mind:

First, of course, is the main event.  Quinton ""Rampage"" Jackson makes it 2-0 against ""The Iceman"" Chuck Liddell, this time winning the UFC Light Heavyweight Crown in the process.  A shocking end, thanks to a devastating Rampage right hook, to Liddell's reign as king of the UFC's light heavyweight division, and the beginning of the Rampage Era.

As good as the Rampage-Liddell main event was, that wasn't even the biggest upset of the night.  That honor belongs to UFC newcomer Houston Alexander.  With a 6-1 MMA record going into the fight, many thought that he would be easy pickings for odds-on favorite Keith ""The Dean of Mean"" Jardine.  Nobody told ""The Assassin"" that, who shockingly demolished Jardine in a mere 48 seconds with a series of brutal punches and uppercuts.

As I said, overall it was a good card.",1186876800,,925,4.834394904458598
