7026917,4,B00U0NA94E,"Good, but not great, film. I suspect that much is lost in translation. I've heard it called a Norwegian ""Fargo."" It's not. It has snow and a couple of gags that might have been inspired by the Coen brothers, but it is its own film. It's worth seeing, but it kind of falls apart at the end instead of concluding in any kind of satisfactory manor.",1439337600,,345,4.242424242424242
7026918,5,B00U0NA94E,Great action movie with a dark sense of humor.,1428796800,,46,4.222222222222222
7026919,4,B00U0NA94E,"A fairly simple Norwegian vengeance film, probably could have done with a bit of editing though of some scenes in between the action that dragged a bit, as its nearly two hours duration does stretch the enjoyment factor a little.  Basic premise is Nils, a snow plough operator who also won citizen of the year in his local community should be celebrating his award, instead he and his wife have been summoned to the morgue to identify the body of their son.  Nils asks the policeman at the morgue what they are going to and doesn't like the dismissive answer of there's not much we can do for a junkie who overdoses.

Nils doesn't believe his son would do drugs, and when his son's friend confesses to him that the drug dealers killed his son because they thought he had stolen the drugs that he in fact did, Nil decides to avenge his son by killing everyone involved, starting at the bottom of the drug food chain and moving up with the name each player gives him, until he gets to the top.  But is this something a simple snow plougher can achieve?

The film is spoken in the Norwegian language with English subtitles.",1427241600,,1120,4.470588235294118
7026920,5,B00U0NA94E,"Stellan Skarsgard is great in this dark tale of revenge.  The local owner of the snow plow service (Skarsgard) is given an award by the community on the last happy day of his life for a long time.  The next day his son is found dead due to a drug overdose. Despite the fact that his son has no history of drug abuse,  the police drop the investigation. His wife drops into a state of depression and leaves him. When a friend of his son's comes by looking for help, he admits that the man's son was killed by drug dealers because he was trying to help his friend, a drug courier out after he had ripped them off. Getting the name of the killer from him, the father goes on murder spree, killing his way up the chain of command. It's a nice comment on the ease that modern technology can get you killed. Keeping pictures and names on your personal directory can really help a committed psycho. The writer adds a note of humor as the killings mount by displaying tombstone data after each death. By the end of the movie, two gangs of drug dealers and a few bystanders have been wiped out and the father's bloodlust has been sated. Very good revenge epic.

7026923,3,B00U0NA94E,"An exceedingly slick Norwegian gangster drama that disappears characterizations and dialogue in favour of stunning scenery and slow-build, stylized direction. The central conceit is lonely own its own, and could have used any number of cinematic conventions to buttress it. But the story of a father's methodical vengeance upon a couple dozen bad guys for killing his son quickly stultifies the audience's curiosity for story arc, as the routine of murder becomes repetitious within an overly long 2 hour drama. And the ending dissolves any hope of clarity, as it fades to black without resolve. Watch for the very deliberate directing prowess and the frozen Nordic landscape. Other than that, this film lumbers along like the protagonist's enormous state-of-the-art snowplow, that promises bloody shrapnel violence but never delivers.",1495843200,,835,5.53125

fantastic cast of supporting characters, stunning landscapes of the frozen North,
all deftly wrapped in an unforgettable tale by the director Hans Peter Moland.

7026935,4,B00U0NA94E,"I purchased this move on the strength of Stellan Skarsgard's name-he doesn't disappoint. This is a revenge-driven film noir, which means that everyone (or almost everyone) is going to end up dead or in a very bad place, and the noir convention also requires that the circle of characters has to be the engines of fate. A a rule, it's not fair to bring just desserts to someone using an outsider; although rules are always made to be broken and played with.  For the diminishing cast of characters to run across each other at times requires convenient coincidences and misunderstandings, while at the same time they have to be making reasonably believable decisions. Think of it as a Scandinavian Fargo, and just as in Fargo the place is its own character.  Not a perfect movie, but perfectly watchable and an enjoyable movie.",1485561600,,825,4.802816901408451

7026943,5,B00U0NA94E,"Stellan Skarsgard is one of my favorite Scandinavian actors. I last saw him in the series 'River'. In this surprisingly entertaining film, Skarsgard plays Nils a quiet husband and father who is a snow plow driver in a remote part of Norway. In fact before you start viewing this film, turn the heat up or put on a heavy jacket. What you are about to see is mountains of white snow all around you that needs to be plowed. In fact, there is so much snow I felt the cold all the time.
Nils and his wife discover their son is dead, and the verdict is drug overdose. Nils does not accept this, and he goes about finding the truth.

As Nils puts two and two together he finds a web of drug dealers, and Nils takes it upon himself to be the eliminator. The interesting part of this film is that each person who dies is given a Memoriam, in order of their disappearance. Many characters in this film, the one that sticks out is Pal Sverre Valheim Hagen, the psychopathic leader of the drug detail. He wears a ponytail, is vegan, and is prone to fits of  crying and madness. All if the characters have their own personality, and there is a little humor, here and there. A surprisingly good film

Probably should have bought instead of rented.  The trailer hardly does this one justice.  The pacing is taut, the criminals nonredeemable, and the violence played down  low -- the action packaged in the mundane.  No heroics, bullets mostly kill, no one dies pretty.  Knots were left untied, and the ending is existential.  Deal with it.  Rent again, future me, when you've forgotten the film.  Thanks past-self, I did just now view it again.

7026977,5,B00U0NA94E,"This is one of those winning movies which combines wry humor with character study's and gang leaders and their principles/moral compass.
What starts out as a kidnapping, quickly turns into a murder, and from there it just keeps on going.  This movie is in Norwegian with English sub-titles.  Don't let the sub-titles stop you from seeing this movie (if you're concerned about not keeping up), as they are quite good at making the subtitles keep up with the dialogue.  (Some foreign movies aren't that good at it.)  There are so many scenes that will have you cracking up laughing at things that are being said or done, and yet they are completely incongruous.  The comic timing is great, the acting superb, and it will leave you glad that you watched it.
Warning, if you don't like violence of any kind, then this movie is not for you.  If you are able to watch it in the context of what the movie is about and not let it bother you, we think you will be glad you watched it. Really great movie.

7026984,4,B00U0NA94E,"""In Order of Disappearance"" (2014 release from Norway; 115 min.) brings the story of Nils, a Swedish guy longtime resident of northern Norway. As the movie opens, Nils and his wife are getting ready to accept the ""Citizen of the Year"" award of the local chamber of commerce. Nils, who runs a snow removal equipment business, accepts the award with humility and dignity. In a parallel story line, we see a couple of young men getting kidnapped and one of them eventually dies. It turns out to be Nils' son, who was in the wrong place at the wrong time, getting mixed up in a local drug gang. Nils knows his son was not an addict and decides to look into the circumstances of the death of his son... At this point we are 15 min. into the movie, but to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from Norwegian director Hans Petter Moland in which he collaborates with Swedish actor Stellan Skarsgrd, who plays Nils. The movie was billed on Google Movie Times as a ""comedy"" and in a sense it might be one, but a very dark one, if that. I found the movie to be a so(m)ber crime drama, in which Skarsgrd plays ""Joe Sixpack"" who is out for revenge of his son's death. Sure there are chuckles here and there, but to me the film resonates a lot more on the level of how an average guy turns out to be a systematic and determined revenge-seeker. The setting of the film, somewhere in northern Norway, is gorgeous, and the use of the snow blowers and snow removal equipment is almost balletic.

This movie is two years old now, and for some reason just popped up in the theater. I saw it this past weekend at the E Street Landmark Theater in Washington, DC. The matinee screening where I saw this at was attended very nicely. No idea why it has taken this long to get into US theaters, but better late than never I suppose. In the meantime I read somewhere that this movie is going to be remade by Hollywood, but without Skarsgrd. Say it ain't so! If you are in the mood for a foreign language crime drama with undertones of a dark, if not black, comedy, you cannot go wrong with this. ""In Order of Disappearance"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1474416000,,2239,4.366906474820144

7026999,5,B00U0NA94E,"Swift, fleet-of-foot, and efficient, with clean lines and a sleek finish, the Norwegian black comedy In Order of Disappearance glides through the world like a perfectly engineered car or a gorgeous piece of modern furniture.

Set in the sparse, blindingly white snowfields of the Scandinavian winter, Hans Petter Moland's violent, satirical crime thriller is assembled with such formal rigor and visual poetry that it throws into high relief the messy, sweaty, almost repulsively human drama that unspools.

The film's knockout power is due in no small part to the contributions of cinematographer Philip gaard and leading man Stellan Skarsgrd, who have worked with the writer-director on two of his best-known features, A Somewhat Gentle Man (2010) and Aberdeen (2000).

Though he's backed by a strong ensemble cast that includes Peter Andersson (The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo), Danish star Birgitte Hjort Srensen (Borgen), and German-film star Bruno Ganz (The American Friend), Skarsgrd dominates the screen with his 6-foot, 4-inch frame, his outsize rage and grief, and the gigantic snowplow truck he drives.

Skarsgrd plays Nils, a successful small-town businessman. His world comes crashing down when his twentysomething son turns up dead in Oslo of a drug overdose. Convinced the boy wasn't a drug user, Nils digs deeper, only to find that the young man was murdered on orders from a local thug acting on behalf of Oslo's new drug kingpin, the Count (Pl Sverre Hagen), a spoiled rich kid who is heir to a chain of bakeries.

Uncovering this bit of information involves capturing, torturing, and killing a chain of bad guys, each higher up on the mobster totem pole than the last.

The killings are gruesome, often absurd events, but Moland's camera doesn't fetishize violence by lingering on the gore and the blood. Nils carefully rolls up each body in chicken wire and throws it off a cliff into a massive waterfall.

(Chicken wire? Nils is really proud of the idea: Unlike plastic or tarp, chicken wire lets fishes through from day one so they can eat up the body before it gets all bloated up and floats to the surface. What's more, he explains, chicken wire is heavier than plastic and won't decompose for years, so it'll keep the body in place.)

Like the Coen brothers' best flicks, In Order of Disappearance gets its gruesomely comic momentum from a domino effect of unintended consequences put into motion by the hero's actions.

The violent whirlwind Nils unleashes sucks in a colorful cast of characters, including a retired mobster known as Wingman (Andersson), a Japanese Danish hit man familiar to clients as the Chinaman (David Sakurai), and, eventually, Scandinavia's top Serbian drug lord, known to all as Papa (Ganz).

Operatic, absurdist, and scathing, Moland's story rages on with tremendous force and speed, never slowing down for extraneous junk like backstories, explanations, or tiresome exposition.

In Order of Disappearance will no doubt invite comparisons to similarly stylized, violent black comedies by Quentin Tarantino and the Coens.

Yet, like 2011's murder farce Headhunters by Moland's Norwegian compatriot Morten Tyldum, In Order of Disappearance has an utterly unique feel, a certain Scandinavian crispness that's impossible to duplicate.",1473379200,9,3282,5.24236641221374

If this were set in North America with the same caliber actors and production quality this movie would get no more than 3.5 stars.  Why do people automatically up-vote foreign films?  It's a stupid trend.  This is a revenge movie and as of today, 9/3/2016, this movie is receiving the same amount of stars as Man on Fire.  RIDICULOUS!!!  This movie is not on the same level as Man on Fire, or other legendary revenge films...Gladiator, Old Boy, V for Vendetta, Kill Bill, The Punisher (2004 version).

In Warm countries, sunny countries the family has to provide unlike countries like Norway where they have welfare.  Plenty of scenes that show Norwegian society is pretty screwed up.  But the best scene is one that hasn't been in a movie since maybe the early 1950's at the latest.  The Count, Ole Forsby, cold cocks his former wife. and she goes down like a stack of bricks. Damn!

7027015,4,B00U0NA94E,"I really enjoyed this movie and could tell it was influenced by Tarantino movies since it had that revenge vibe with some dark humor. I also know it also had influences from Fargo and you can really see that played out too, but I thought it was more Tarantino. While it was slow at times, it really had a great plot.

A father discovers that his son was killed and was not an overdose. He decides to get revenge on the people who killed him and starts a gang war. This simple plot gave the director lots of room to take have more room to add to the story.

I think even if you aren't a fan of foreign movies that this one is worth the rental price. The acting was superb and the dialogue played a big part in this movie. The characters were well developed and even though I knew they were the bad guys even I had to flinch at some of the things they did.",1472601600,,854,4.047337278106509

8703691,5,B00U0NA94E,"This film is amazing in many ways.  It does not follow a clich plot of revenge (although, technically it does).  In many ways this film is a blend of a very dark Scandinavian humor with a twist and turn of a complicated plot, based (oh, well) on revenge.  The violence is graphic.  The characters are extremely well defined.  Acting, sets, mood, directing  everything is top notch.  In this film there is based on a very subtle difference between Norwegian and Swedish cultures that *might* be appealing to the folks whove been to these countries, not as just tourists but rather exploring the underlying of the history, feuds, animosities and *very* slight language dialect differences.  How about a quote from the film: Sunshine or welfare? 
With that said, the American title of this film In Order of Disappearance is, indeed, very well suited for the plot.  However  The actual translation of the title from Norwegian (and/or Swedish) of Kraftidioten is meant to be Power Idiot  How is that for a Scandinavian sense of humor?  All in all, this film is EXCELLENT, worthy of an Amazon rental and *might* be not be well appreciated by an Anglo-Saxon audience who does not a difference between Norway, Sweden and Denmark.  Oh, I cant believe I have just written this  I *am* an American !!!!!!!  Also, I am a *huge* fan of Jo Nesbos novels.  Whats *your* opinion?",1506124800,3,1363,4.781115879828326

This is one of the better revenge movies I have seen in a very long time. My father in law said that it reminded him of Charles Bronson in Death Wish. The characters were fun, entertaining and the actors, especially Stellan Skarsgard, were fantastic. It was quirky in a way that reminded me of Tarantino films.  If you like pulp fiction, Django unchained and Kill Bill, this is the same type of movie you will like.  I pointed out the age range of the people watching to give you an idea of the appeal through a broad range of adults from young to old who really enjoyed it. The setting is a small town in Norway, with lots of snow. The villain was truly evil and crazy.  The hero was a good man and citizen, just how I like my heroes and villains. Oftentimes these days filmmakers make movies or TV series where you have no one to root for and there is no one you like or care about.  This is not the case here.  Really fun and highly recommended if you like the type of movie I have described above.",1504396800,2,1173,4.172566371681416
