I've seen the Getty's in concert and this dvd captures all the fun and excitement of their live performances.

7380842,5,B0141684C4,"I don't know about the DVD; I just saw them live.  What a show!  MANY multi-talented musicians, with each having multiple talents.  I saw Celtic Woman about 2 months ago, and this show may have been more lively and energetic.  They added the very special touch of a choir made up of several city church choir members.  I saw many faces I recognized from my own church - and the audience was asked to join in on several carols. An inspiring and worshipful experience.",1449100800,2,466,4.5

Keith and Kristin Getty's Irish Christmas Live immediately went to the very top of my favorites list.  The sound and picture are quite good.  The music and arrangements are excellent.
