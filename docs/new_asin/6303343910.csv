7844828,2,6303343910,"Weird, funky but funny B movie. The kind you watch on nights you just can't sleep or find anything else to do. There is a couple of corpse scenes and elements related to an adult party that people may find disturbing or offensive.",1455580800,,230,4.372093023255814

7844832,4,6303343910,"This is a fast-paced, hilarious film with an interesting history. I initially purchased it because kd lang had a role in it, and she is absolutely a scream as a pious, ""Born Again"" fervent Christian aunt who tries to give Teresa advice. Julie Cypher (Lee Diamond Phillips & Melissa Etheridge's Ex) directed this funny film that is very entertaining. Melissa Etheridge provides a great soundtrack with several original songs. Nancy McKeon is in a comical supporting role as Teresa's friend and sidekick. What starts off as Teresa and her friend going to an All-Girl party ends with car chases and meeting all kinds of characters along the way.

The acting was spot-on, and it appears the actors were having fun making this film.

A great film to watch over and over again.",1133827200,,771,4.833333333333333
7844833,4,6303343910,"Okay...so I bought this movie because of it's history. Yes, it is directed by Julie Cypher (ex lover/girlfriend of my favorite singer, Melissa Etheridge). Yes, it features Lou Diamond Phillips, Julie's ex husband, a few other noteable actors (kd lang, etc etc) and a cameo by Melissa herself including alot of her music...anyways...that is why I bought it. Buuuuut, it was very entertaining. It was obviously meant to be wacky and hard to follow...duh! It was very funny and just a good movie to watch. It's not deep or inspirational or heart-felt and it's not supposed to be! If you are a fan of any of these actors, give it a shot. I got my copy used through an amazon.com vendor and I'm very glad I did. $15 bucks for a rare piece of ME history is nothin...especially since I'm a huge movie fan anyways ;)

Cheerio..",1094256000,5,819,4.571428571428571
7844834,1,6303343910,"This movie is TERRIBLE. The plot is non existent, the acting is mediocre at best...what a complete waste of time. I'll never get those hours of my life back and I'm mad! The fact that anyone would pay $90+ for this is SCARY.

Save your money and buy ANYTHING but this.",1090627200,,268,4.254901960784314
