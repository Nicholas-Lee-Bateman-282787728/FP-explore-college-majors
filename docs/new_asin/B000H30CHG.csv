2625916,3,B000H30CHG,"Prior to watching this documentary about the New York art-music scene of the late 70s/early 80s, I didn't know much about the groups and musicians that are featured -- Lydia Lunch, Swans, Suicide, Teenage Jesus and the Jerks. Only the more familiar Sonic Youth floats in this churning sea like a comforting lifesaver.

Now having seen ""Kill Your Idols,"" I still can't say I know very much about the groups, but I do know their names and got a sample of their sounds.

The reason for that is because the film tends to put each band under a microscope, tightly sealed under a slide, and it doesn't really provide enough context about the scene itself.

But it almost doesn't matter because ""Kill Your Idols"" gives viewers a pretty good launching point to discover music most people haven't heard before. The segments that spotlight the early individual bands are all engaging in their own ways and although to say, ""I wanted more"" is a complaint, it's also a compliment.

Where the movie is less successful, however, is in trying to draw a connection between the previous scene and the current one.

The fusion doesn't really work because most of what you have is the older guys saying the new scene sucks/is contrived/doesn't break any new ground (although for the most part they refuse to name names other than the Strokes). The popular refrain of ""music today sucks"" is basically repeated through most of the second half of the film.

Meanwhile, the film also presents the younger guys and newer bands who are cast as either carrying or dropping the art-rock torch, and they seem to know what they're talking about, but they don't come off very well -- Karen O. from the Yeah Yeah Yeahs mostly seems smug and disingenuous, and the guys from A.R.E. Weapons dunderheadedly try too hard to be hip; for the most part, only the leader of Gogol Bordello really approaches some good points.

Handsomely shot and edited (although the stylish chapter cards last way too long), this is a good place for a newbie like me to start, but additional research will be required.",1166400000,5,2062,4.743016759776537

8136146,3,B000H30CHG,This unfocused documentary barely scratches the surface of the early punk scene.  I would have loved to have seen more early video clips and more interviews with the early players of the punk genre.  It just really left me wanting to learn so much more.  I could not tell if Lydia Lunch was trying to be funny and ironic or if she really is as bitter as she came across to me.,1442793600,,376,4.194444444444445
8136147,3,B000H30CHG,"Interesting documentary of the late 70's - 80's New York underground no wave experimental art post punk music scene. Includes mostly interviews and some music clips with Lydia Lunch. M Gira of the Swans, Sonic Youth. J G Thirwell aka Foetus/Clint Ruin and many others. I was disappointed that the interviews were all short and the music clips were only seconds long. Seemed like they had some great never before seen footage of the Swans, Lydia Lunch and Sonic Youth  performing live that fans would have loved to witness.",1425945600,,522,4.865168539325842
8136148,3,B000H30CHG,"Im not sure what the point of this movie is other than to compare the late seventies, early eighties NYC scene with whats happening now or 2002. The older guard essentially accuse the younger of having no originality and to some extent they're right. But then that isn't necessarily the younger musicians particular trip, so thematically this movie is somewhat weak. The older folks interviewed in what was jokingly called ""No Wave"" such as Glenn Branca, Lydia Lunch or Lee Renaldo were trying to make music that had no references other than to itself. They weren't creating another take on the blues in other words and in some cases dispensed with what could be considered rock all together. They were more concerned with making art. By comparison the younger NYC musicians, who don't consider themselves artists, are imitative rather than innovative and are often imitating the older musicians interviewed. Could anyone make the case that the Strokes are in any way original or that A.R.E. Weapons are more than derivative electroclash with attitude? But then again, so what? This movie doesnt work either as history or polemic. No point is made other than the scene has changed for better or worse and if you didn't know who these people were before you would be only a little less clueless at the movies end. What is made clear is that the older ""No Wave"" NYC musicians had different attitudes and indeed very different agendas from the contemporary musicians. So to my mind the comparison between the two camps is without much value.

One thing I can say that the older original No Wave musicians are a lot more articulate than the modern musicians. Karen O is truly annoying with all her ""like"", ""you know"" nonsense and she actually is one of the more intelligent folks interviewed. The A.R.E. Weapons guys are barely above monkey level, as is their music.",1369958400,,1862,4.855345911949685
8136149,3,B000H30CHG,"This is a highly personal and opinionated documentary that mostly focuses on art-punk/post-punk bands of the late 70s NYC scene, and some more modern bands influenced by them.  It has some nice ""lost"" live footage of some of the original ""No"" wave bands such as DNA, Teenage Jesus, and the Contortions.  Lydia Lunch is ridiculously smug in her interviews, dissing newer bands as poseurs, dissing L.A. as fashion oriented... Kind of hypocritical when you consider the degree to which she seemed to highlight her sex image moreso than her musicianship.  Really, which you you listen to more these days, Teenage Jesus or the first Gun Club record from fashion conscious LA? The Foetus guy came off somewhat bitter too, preferring to listen to 60s soundtracks over newer music.  Perhaps the film is saying more about getting older as a musician, but could have been a little more subtle in its heavy handed editing.

The no wave bands, at their best, sounded dangerous and outre.  As several of the interviewees alluded, it was a vent for anger and emotion moreso than musicality - though there is nothing really that new about that, just their atonal clanging (to some degree). A cynic could say the no wavers were art school poseurs and you could look back to the 60's ESP record catalog for large doses of genuine lunacy.  Lee Ranaldo (of Sonic Youth) and the Gogol Bordello guy had the most illuminating comments and both of those bands can play their instruments, too.  A little more on James Chance and the Contortions, and Mars would have been cool.  More footage from Flux Information Society!

Check out the documentary Blank City, too, for a glimpse of the more cinematic goings on the the late 70s.",1367884800,,1705,4.808219178082192
8136150,3,B000H30CHG,"There seems to be an interesting problem that exists with most music documentaries. While the subject matter may be admirable, and often worthy of closer examination, the sheer scope of material needed to be covered is usually so dense that the individual voices profiled are usually truncated into one or two clever sound bites. While this is an understandable restriction of time, it still leaves the viewer with what is essentially a mere sketch of the material reduced into a few colorful footnotes.

As an introductory expose to No Wave for the younger crowd this film does a decent job, but to the more long time fan's of the genre the brief glimpses of interviews with people like Alan Vega, and M.Gira may seem too fleeting.

To be fair S.A. Crary seems to realize this and the DVD comes with almost an hour of extended footage, but the problem really seems to be the nature of the subjects them selves. Ultimately Suicide, Lydia Lunch , and the Swans were all predicated on such remarkable stories that any one of them would make a remarkable 3 hour documentary all on their own. To be sure, M.Gira's anecdote of sending certain dna body fluids of his in a baggie to Robert Christgau after a particularly pejorative review is worth the price of the DVD alone. That being said, even with the additional footage I was still left with a desire for more exhaustive interviews with people like Lydia Lunch , while the cinema of transgression figures Nick Zedd and Richard Kern (an important part of  no wave ) didn't even make an on screen appearance at all. Again, I don't feel this is a fault of S.A. Cary's, it's just that the scope of the project has so many facets that even 3 hours seems too restrictive. This brings the other issue - The profile of the contemporary groups performing music.

With the current trend of pop music magazines tripping over themselves to serve up the latest expose of ground zero for cultural hip ness, many of the younger people in the film, by accident or by design, will no doubt be more familiar to most older viewers as the pin up stars staring back at them on the shelves of  Borders , and Barnes and Nobel in the magazine section, than the architects of memorable music someone has turned them on to.  With their affected hair and their romantic thrift store clothes askew, just so, it's almost too easy to take dismissive pot shots at these 20 something street kid millionaires.  The fact remains though, that good looks and white belts with brown pants alone don't garner a following.  As a bit of a jaded older person I was pleasantly surprised to find that in fact most of the younger people here like the Yeah  Yeah  Yeah's are actually very decent pop songwriters , and despite Lydia Lunch's venomous diatribe of that supposed  crime, I could respect and see why their following was so strong.  Quite simply they're just good musicians.

Black Dice , the Liars and Gogal Bordello respectively are all excellent and  compelling and if the film has any point to make, I'd say it's that the spirit that first brought the Velvet Underground together and carried on through other bands in the 70's and the 80's is as strong now as it's ever been. As for the proprietary pissing contest between the old guard bitching about how "" real "" they were and how phony and illegitimate the newer bands are, really, it's a waste of time. There's enough room in the world for Diamanda Galas and Lady tron.",1194307200,4,3441,4.610474631751227
8136151,5,B000H30CHG,This one is really good as documentaries go. I love the interviews especially Lydia Lunch just making fun of all the new kids in the New York music scene... thats the best part!!!,1181865600,5,179,4.454545454545454
8136152,5,B000H30CHG,"Enigmatic and deliberately hypocritical, this is not a typical documentary film.

Taking cues more from video art than journalism, the film is structured thematically and is more complex than a linear historical survey. The editing cleverly compiles interviews with the originators of No Wave, newer bands, and Sonic Youth (the bridge between) into a sort of a dialogue of confession and criticism. The director doesn't conceal the fact that the cuts in editing pervert time, which appropriately comments on the medium of documentary film itself.

Shot in NY homes and streets rather than studios, Kill Your Idols meditates on the notion of nostalgia, time, scene, and music history. The film is unique for the ability to display the intentions of art through the musicians' view whether they sound dignified or not. It's clever and cocky and insightful. There are connections and contradictions. There are no pre-chewed short cuts. The film won't tell you what to think, but it will make you do so.

(The hour+ of special features on the DVD are very worth mentioning and include a lengthy, great featurette.)",1169510400,9,1110,5.121546961325967
8136153,2,B000H30CHG,"I'll make this short and sweet; the editiing in this film really ruins its credibility. There are are a ton of awkward cuts during the interviews. The cuts become so frequent that you're not sure exactly who or what the artist is talking about or referring to. The first time I watched this movie, the edititng didn't bother me so much, but upon the second view, the director's bias towards certain musicians was clearly demonstrated through the copying and pasting of interview clips.

just because it is an indie film doesn't make it profound or even good. I probably could have made this movie in my highschool intro to film class.",1169251200,4,634,4.711711711711712
8136154,3,B000H30CHG,"It's hard to know exactly what the angle of the filmmaker exactly was in regards to Kill Your Idols. The theme is blurry in my opinion. What is offered is devoid of narrative and built around interviews with emblematic performers from the (brief) No Wave era. What was immediately satisfying is that I had never heard of No Wave before so I appreciated the education. The phrase itself is a great send up of New Wave and it appears that the artists were very much the antithesis of the lively, polished sounds which were presented to our ears on the radio during that era. The interviewees, Lydia Lunch, Michael Gira, etc. are not very encouraged by what they see today. The describe the contemporary New York sound as being commodified and contrived via the machinations of the studios and rock journalists. With Sonic Youth, Thurston Moore is consulted but the band really seems to have existed on the fringe of this fringe movement. Several current bands are covered and you can see the way in which they are an extension of the No Wave period. As to whether a band like the Yeah Yeah Yeahs fit in, I am not sure, and that's what I meant before when I said that the director's perspective was not easily apparent. The musical talent of the groups is also questionable. Many of the figures admit that their songs seemed to be more statement than an expression of talent. The one thing that's certain is that they are fairly negative about the bands making the scene today. Personally, I disagree with Eno's assessment of the Strokes but I understand the way in which the band was not a result of their having experienced authentic New York culture. Gira's memories of living on the street, picking up just enough work to survive, and turning to music from a sense of having no other choice are undoubtedly circumstances not shared by today's headliners. The age that these artists describe does appear to be long gone, but it did provide a stirring creative impulse that benefited those who followed. Kill Your Idols has merit because it illuminates an era of which many of us know nothing.

*Thanks for the correction. I looked over the cast list and don't know why I made the mistake with Eno.",1168732800,5,2197,4.647814910025707
