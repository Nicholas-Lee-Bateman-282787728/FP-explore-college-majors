8138024,4,B000HC2LJ4,"This 6-DVD collection contains all the previosly released Goodtimes DVD's except ""Three Stooges Festival"". ""Funniest Moments 1 and 2"" are combined onto one disc. If you don't have those already, this is worth picking up for the rare material, and for the fact that Goodtimes has been bought out and this will be the last release from them! It's a budget, but Goodtimes had the best quality budget Stooges DVD's on the market. The discs are (in no particular order):
FUNNIEST MOMENTS 1 AND 2: Live-action wrap-arounds from the 1965 ""New Three Stooges"" cartoon series
SIMPLY HILARIOUS: The four public-domain episodes
SWING PARADE/JERKS OF ALL TRADES: ""Swing.."": Full-length movie from 1946. ""Jerks..."": TV pilot from 1949. Pilot never aired, the series never happened.
LOST COMEDY TREASURES: Rare TV appearances and other footage
KINGS OF LAUGHTER: Highlights of non-Sony material (public domain and MGM)
THREE STOOGES STORY: A documentary of their whole career",1158537600,34,960,5.322368421052632
