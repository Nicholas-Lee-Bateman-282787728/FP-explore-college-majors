8264189,1,B0016STA38,"Its important to know while watching this film that the film maker has, in several instances, flat out misrepresented facts to force the viewer to draw his conclusion. He also passes himself off as a unbiased, yet curious, fact seeker. He is not. He is an activist against GM foods, and was at the time of this film. One (of many) instances of deception was the Monsanto v Schmieser scenes. What isn't mentioned is that Schmeiser harvested, retained, then replanted the seeds with Monsantos genetic material in them. This completely debunks Schmeisers proposition that Monsanto is taking over his fields. Schmeiser has dozens of neighbors, none of which have been sued; which logically follows if Bishop/Schmeiser's story is to be believed. Also, Schmeiser is trying to use Monsanto's seed. If you agree with this film maker than Schmeiser is part of the problem. Another isntance:  Jane Akre is, in no way, a credible source. Akre and Wilson tried to run a smear piece against Monsanto, which Monsanto has a right to prevent their reputation from being attacked (so do you). Akres report was determined to be without sufficient foundation to justify risking a lawsuit for product defamation. To put these people who have more than sufficient motivation to over-represent the 'evil' presented by GM foods shows a gross lack of integrity. This film is little more than a scare piece. After years of research into this subject, and those surrounding it, I find this outright misrepresentation disgusting. He fails to mention that GM foods have cut rates of starvation significantly, increased food production, decreased human labor in fields (try it for a few years), and that the people he cites as 'good' either have zero expertise or are 100% biased. His 'menus' are absurd. As another review pointed out, he uses crap when he cooks ""GM"" food (and lists it as ""GM whatever"") but then uses fresh good looking ingredients for ""organic"" food. Overall, this is a horrible film.",1302998400,,1974,5.0
8264190,5,B0016STA38,"I rented the DVD on Netflix.

The interviewees: Canadian and Indian farmers, industry scientists, food journalists...

The GM proponents: biotech behemoths such as Monsanto,  etc. - their interest is world economic domination. The goal is to patent plant types and soon have the whole world buying seeds only from Monsanto.

There is virtually no testing for safety or nutritional value, or assuring food diversity, or avoiding monocultures.

Documentary does a good job of entertaining too - the interviewees are all passionate about the subject and as informed as they could be.",1297900800,4,580,5.329670329670329
8264191,1,B0016STA38,"I will have to question some of the biases in this movie citing three scenes. Two scenes in particular that echo this point.  Both in which he cooks a dinner the first he uses Organic foods and the second he uses GMO foods.  What struck me was the fact that all the Organic products he used were fresh while, all the GMO foods he used were canned or preserved.  Now which is more appetizing a meal that has all fresh ingredients or one that comes out of cans?

Another idea I question is one that sprung from his trip to India the implication that no one is starving in the world so science is not necessary in agriculture.

Overall don't base your opinions on something as important as food on this one movie.  Read up on other sources as well.",1294790400,3,745,4.285714285714286
