8237395,4,B00108ALNC,"Amazon has the complete wrong description of this movie above, so be warned, it has nothing to do with anyone named Heidi or Berlin. It's a Danish film (does have English and other subtitles, however).

The film is good and worth seeing if you're into foreign film or at least Danish films. Kind of predictable (okay, entirely so) but most films like this generally are. Not a draw back of any kind, just putting it out there in case you assumed it was a suspenseful thriller that left you guessing till the end (it absolutely doesn't).

Still, a good film and worth seeing. Would give more detail, but I have my doubts about how many people are actually going to read this.",1220745600,8,674,4.516393442622951
