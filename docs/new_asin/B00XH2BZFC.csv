8715885,5,B00XH2BZFC,"Our heroine Jung Yoo Mi's acting is superb as always and paired with Oh Ji Ho 's outstanding acting and good looks, the protagonists just shine.  The story is set during the early Korean Joseon Dynasty.  It focuses on In Yub, an arrogant aristocratic young woman whose father is wrongfully accused of treason. She is subsequently stripped of rank and fortune and forced into slavery as punishment.  Her change of fortune, and exposure to the injustices of the cast sytem in place during the period transform the arrogant young woman into a compassionate and empathic person.  It also serves to fuel her will and determination to prove her father's innocence and restore his honor.  The outstanding casting, acting, plot, costumes and sets render a fascinating tale full of action, romance and court intrigue.
Video quality is excellent as so are the English subtitles.  The series is a great addition to any video library.  Five stars in my book.",1448755200,,946,4.949367088607595
