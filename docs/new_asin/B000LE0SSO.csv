8161633,5,B000LE0SSO,Yes it was....helped me to improve my approach to the game and mental challenges the game has,1493596800,,93,4.529411764705882
8161634,2,B000LE0SSO,The content of this DVD is okay by the first one I received had a glitch between section 3 and 4.  So I sent it back and got another copy.  The second copy did the same thing.,1423612800,,175,3.7027027027027026
8161635,5,B000LE0SSO,"Sorry to say my scores haven't improved but it takes practice.  I learned a lot about bowling styles, hand positions, and lane conditions.  Lane conditions have always been a mystery to me and I am now learning to adapt to changes.  I just need more practice.  Found the book informative and helpful, as well as easy to understand.",1369440000,,331,4.655172413793103
8161636,3,B000LE0SSO,"The dvd was fun to watch, however as for being any help on tips for being a better bowler it was ok. Walter ray bowled five different bowlers and there really wasn't any great tips for bowling on this dvd. for most part it was just walter ray and another bowler competeing against each other. if your going to pick this dvd up just to watch the bowling, then it is a interesting dvd. but I wouldn't purchase it if your looking for alot of bowling tips.",1297814400,,452,4.206896551724138
8161637,1,B000LE0SSO,"What a disappointment!  Very simply, this video is virtually useless, providing nothing for either the beginner, intermediate, or expert.  The format was simply to have Walter Ray bowl against six of the best local bowlers (Phoenix, I think?), which was recorded here in its virtually-unedited entirety.  No re-takes, no video analysis, no nothing.

The shortcomings were many:
* Discussion of how to adjust for changing lane conditions was limited to Walter Ray occasionally stating ""I just move a little bit to the left as the lanes change.""
* No diagrams to speak of - I think in Game 3 they finally showed one, which was a diagram of how to throw a straight ball at a 4-pin spare -- not exactly the most earth-shattering revelation, frankly...
* No discussions of equipment or oiling patterns, nor how to choose a ball to either match your style or to be appropriate for the lane conditions.
* Pre-, mid-, and post-game discussions were virtually non-existent, and generally what was discussed did not shed any light on how to either prepare for your next game, or to learn from the one you just threw.
* Even the camera work was primitive, with a single camera set way back, so you really can't see much detail of what the ball is doing on the lanes.  And only a couple of slow-motion instant replays (I know, you can do that yourself with your DVD remote, but still...).

Tellingly, Walter Ray missed some easy spares, and a couple of times he stated that normally he would have a plastic ball for spares, but ""didn't have all of his equipment today"".  Well, why not?  Were they so pressed for time to make this DVD that he couldn't first have asked the pro shop to punch one out for him, to be able to SHOW us how a pro makes his spares?  And for people who might not know, perhaps explain WHY he would normally use a plastic ball, and whether that's something that all skill levels should consider?

The title ""Bowling Lessons from the Pros"" is, in short, completely misleading - there are really no lessons in here to speak of.  Stick with Parker Bohn's ""Beyond the Bowling Basics"", which is everything an instructional bowling DVD should be.",1203292800,10,2151,4.63421052631579
8161638,2,B000LE0SSO,"Very disappointed in this video, hurt my arm last year and have been trying to get back to bowling better, thought this might help, but when you have some guy on the lane and not sure just what he was doing watch Walter Ray bowl against six regular guys and beat all but one and really not give someone anything other than what a high average bowler already knows, which still doesn't help anyone, I was sorry I spent the money on this title..Oh well live and learn..",1203033600,8,467,4.318181818181818
