5767347,5,B00D25MJ8G,"This show is wildly funny, darkly serious, and believably gritty. I'm a 23 yo medical student who normally goes for romantic comedy, so this show is outside my usual lineup. I was surprised by how much I loved it. If you are at all thinking about watching this, don't pass it up! The acting excellent, and I promise you'll laugh.",1383264000,8,329,4.5
5767348,5,B00D25MJ8G,"Hamm and Radcliffe are brilliant in their joint role. Despite a striking difference in height, the actors believably portray the same doctor, as he was when first leaving med school and as a seasoned, addicted middle aged man. I was especially impressed with their gifts for slapstick. They were ably assisted by a cast of very good supporting actors. All aspects of the production were first rate, from the costumes, to the sets, to the cinematography. All in all, the production believably recreated a doctor's practice in the backwoods of Russia in 1917.",1381622400,16,557,5.0
5767349,4,B00D25MJ8G,"Very enjoyable as the mature version of the doctor remembers his first day as a very young doctor at a country hospital. Daniel Radcliffe and Jon Hamm are just great as the young and mature versions of the doctor. I'd love to hear Jon's comments on working with Daniel Radcliffe and Daniel's on working with Jon. Funny, sad and scarey, too. I'm looking forward to the next episode.",1381363200,4,381,4.617647058823529

5767351,4,B00D25MJ8G,"I really enjoyed this series.  John Hamm is the narrator reading his old journal while Dan Radcliffe plays the young doctor in this tale about a young doctor fresh out of medical school.  Watch as he copes with the struggles in this isolated country hospital.  The tone goes from being quite silly as the young doctor and the older one interact to very dramatic as the doctor deals with some very serious medical conditions.

I'm aware this is not for everyone as the humor is very dark and it is a bit quirky, but I truly enjoyed every minute of it.",1379376000,33,550,4.415841584158416

5767355,4,B00D25MJ8G,"Video: Although 1080 HD, the picture quality of the Blu-ray isn't as crisp as you'd probably like (it doesn't help that the series uses somber color grading to set the mood).

Audio: As is usually the case with these German Blu-ray releases, the default audio track is dubbed German, but the English track is still available by selection. The cover of the copy I received was very slightly different from the picture listed here on Amazon for the Blu-ray, so I've scanned the dust jacket [below] to show a version that will surely have the option of English audio (notice the ""Staffel 1"", meaning Season 1).

Extras: There's a Behind the Scenes featurette worth watching. As one of the executive producers, Hamm discusses rather proudly how the project (season 1, anyway) was born and completed in less than a year... which isn't all *that* great of a feat when you consider the season is only four 23-minute episodes. The featurette is nearly as long as an episode: Along with the usual (Hamm complimenting Radcliffe, and vice-versa), it's fairly engaging. Radcliffe comments how he hopes he'll be as handsome as Hamm is when he grows up (they both play the same person at different ages, in case you didn't know).

Final thoughts: As for the show, I didn't warm up to it until the second ep. The humor is forced, but you will become acclimated to it... and then all of a sudden the season is over. Not in a million years would you think a scene about a young girl having her leg amputated by a dull saw could be comedy, but Radcliffe had me in stitches during this scene. Yes, an appreciation of black humor is a prerequisite.",1453248000,,1628,4.626297577854671

5767357,5,B00D25MJ8G,"One of the giants of 20th-century European literature, Russian novelist Mikhail Bulgakov (1891-1940) achieved in his stories an intoxicating blend of comedy, drama, and social satire. His particular brand of magic realism also featured blistering critiques of the Soviet political system, making much of his work unpublishable during his lifetime. His masterpiece, The Master and Margarita, was written in the 1920s, but not released until 1967.

Bulgakov, who was a physician, had more luck during his lifetime with a series of autobiographical short stories he published in medical journals during the 1920s, surreal yarns about a know-nothing youngster fresh out of medical school stuck in the middle of nowhere who is responsible for the health of an entire town.

The stories follow the young doctor's life, but also feature magical appearances by his older, jaded self, a morphine-addicted misanthrope who makes sarcastic comments on his younger self's life choices.

Thanks to the efforts of two very different actors - Mad Men's Jon Hamm and Harry Potter's Daniel Radcliffe - A Young Doctor's Notebook has been adapted into a brilliant four-part mini-series starring Radcliffe as the young doctor and Hamm as the older man. The series has a unique mix of comedy - physical comedy, puns, wordplay, sight gags - and terrifying Kafka-esque social horror that's unmatched by anything else on TV",1449014400,,1398,5.316742081447964

5767359,4,B00D25MJ8G,Weirdly good. It was and is not a story for everyone but I enjoyed the actors performances and the dry humor. If you are someone who doesn't like dry humor or campy kind of performances this may not be for you. I like these types of off beat kind of things however my husband couldn't even sit though an episode..... The performances by both lead actors made this well worth the watch for me they are hardly recognizable (in a good way) from the roles they are both most known for. Has quiet a bit of gore as well so if you can't handle that stay away from this. Ii quiet enjoy watching it and wished it was longer.....,1443744000,,619,4.2100840336134455

5767369,3,B00D25MJ8G,"Some people might enjoy this four episode season of a British TV series, but I did not enjoy it. I watched all four episodes, and while it had its interesting moments, it also had weird and different moments.

This takes place mostly in 1917 Russia where Daniel, playing the younger doctor, has to deal with ignorance, prejudice, and more. His older self shows up as imagined conversations with himself help him survive.

I doubt that I will give season two a try. It's okay, but I won't be checking this out from the library again.",1428364800,,532,4.589473684210526

5767371,2,B00D25MJ8G,"Admittedly, I only made it through half the shows before I shut it off.  I was expecting dark comedy and I normally enjoy dark comedy, but I was still waiting for the comedy when I gave it up.  Certainly, it was dark and gruesome at times, with odd turns such as the doctor running around with half his face shaved, and I could see an attempt to be funny, but I just never found it amusing.

The premise is that a young doctor fresh from medical school goes off to some hospital in the middle of the frozen, ever-snowing Russian countryside back in the early 1900s where he meets nurses who look down at him (favoring his dead predecessor at every chance), and other medical professionals (if you pardon the term) who don't seem to have a clue half the time.  Supposedly, this young doctor got top marks in school, but he runs back to check his books every time a patient presents just about and is haunted by his older self, which is not explained and didn't seem to add much to the story.

The acting was great and the idea seemed good, so Im not sure who to blame for the lack of humor.  Too bad.",1426032000,2,1099,4.259615384615385
5767372,4,B00D25MJ8G,"Many years ago, in high school, the teacher repeated the theory that the personality of the Russian people is as  dark and controlling as it is due to the fact that as infants they are tightly swaddled against the Russian winter. How much of this was Cold War psychology and how much is science I have no way of knowing. I do know that there is something about Russian literature that tends to focus on despair, depression and the assumption of dire fate. These are the thoughts that come to me as I consider the miniseries A Young Doctors Notebook. This is not light viewing. Upon reflection the humor is not so much black humor as gallows humor.

I had originally bought this series for the chance to watch Daniel Radcliffe not only star with John Hamm but to watch them share the same role. That Hamm is probably 18 inches taller than Radcliffe would suggest the impossibility of this pairing. For me it worked. Daniel Radcliffe is the young doctor of the title. We meet him as he arrives fresh from medical school in Moscow into a continuously snowing dark extremely remote Russian backwoods hospital. This will be the last time we see him fresh. John Hamm is the nearly 20-year-old older version of the young doctor. And while it appears his situation in life is improved he is under criminal investigation by the NKVD.

I think it is intended that we are initially sympathetic to the older doctor. After all the NKVD was a political arm and we are left to assume that he is been unfairly singled out for political persecution. As his office is being searched he thinks back to his earlier days as a younger and very swiftly not so innocent country doctor. Point of fact the young doctor will lose his innocence in more ways than one by the second episode.

Part of the disorientation achieved by the miniseries is trying to keep track of how much time is moving forward from the arrival of Daniel Radcliffe and how much time is being seen in flashback. The younger and older Dr. interact in such a way that you can almost see this as magical reality where in the older man is literally seen by the younger man. Time in other words is seriously out of joint. The key to these interactions is that these two actors for all their difference in stature do have a natural similarity in facial structure and being good actors the pickup small habits from each other to make it seem like they are two views of the same man. Between the two actors I much prefer John Hamm's performance. He seems effortless at switching between the older more mature worldly wise man of medicine and a man on the edge of collapse from the ruin he has brought upon himself. Radcliffe's acting while good never quite conveys the degree to which he tells us he is suffering.

Possibly due to editing or directing we get the almost clich&eacute; young frustrated doctor proclaiming himself a murderer and a butcher. To the viewer it is clear that he is doing the best he can under adverse conditions. As no one else is blaming him or expects much more from him,some of this suffering does not ring true. A better actor might have made this more believable I like Radcliffe but he does not fully achieve this aspect of this role

Playing his support staff at the hospital we have: Adam Godley, Vicki Pepperdine, and Rosie Cavaliero. Between them we get to see what I've come to believe is a minimum standard in British acting that there are no small parts. Each of the three presents unique characters who have responded to the same stimuli or rather lack of stimuli that is their effective exile. The nurse with the keys to the pharmacy learns to be indifferent on a cosmic scale. The head nurse perhaps the most integrated personality in the hospital has enshrined the recently deceased doctor. She believes herself to be the real commanding figure in the facility. The Feldsher ( A term meaning Health care Professional, in this case the anesthesiologist, dentist and generally the doctors right-hand man) may be homosexual, socially awkward or just a tad crazy. These five people become the core of the episodes and ensure that no matter how dark the events they will be performed with great skill.

It is fair to call this miniseries macabre. The apparent ignorance of and indifference about specifically syphilis is difficult to understand. A soldier arrives with the unmistakable evidence of advanced syphilis refuses to hear his diagnosis. From him we will get our first indication that country medicine is believed to be a matter of drops or salve. Later the young doctor will face-off against a mother with three young children all infected with syphilis who again cannot comprehend that syphilis is more than just a minor throat irritation. The young doctor, frustrated (again that word) finding no way to get through the peasant woman's placid ignorance replies to her request for ""some drops"" by telling her he will give her a shovel with which she can dig three small graves.

The fourth episode of which ends this season and this set struck me as rather abrupt. Much of the story was missing. I had enjoyed this series and  once I found out there was a second season I felt strongly that I wanted to see. So far I have not made that buying decision. Ultimately this is a program about a young man on the road to
self-destruction the humor such that it is,  is more of self-depreciating humor that signals this self-destruction. My hesitation is based on the still balanced interest in watching a well told and acted story come to its conclusion against the fact that this story however well told has so far been relentlessly despairing.",1423267200,2,5627,4.657603222557905
5767373,2,B00D25MJ8G,"I have read the original story more than a few times and loved it. I was thrilled to see this movie come out. It started out not too bad. Setting was dark and glum as it is in the book and the dark humor was shown well enough. I didn't like the nurses' attitude though - was completely exaggerated. But most importantly, NOWHERE in the book does the doctor abuse opium or hump the nurse. Disgusting! Bulgakov must be turning in his grave. Why is it necessary to insert some cheap/profane twist to make something appear more interesting?! Well, fix the tempo then - the story in the book is not as slow and neither is it as repetitive.. Also, there is no 1934 and there are no Soviet soldiers questioning the doctor - was it really necessary to insert the vicious Soviets? Can no movie about Russian do without them?
In a nutshell: read the book, skip the show.",1421971200,8,860,4.38125
5767374,3,B00D25MJ8G,"This is right up my alley, and I should have liked it more than I did. But after everything gets set up in the wonderful, darkly funny first episode, which I'd give 4 stars on its own, it feels like the writers had no idea of where to take it from there. The other 3 episodes basically just repeat the first, with little development or sense that the narrative is taking us anywhere. I've never read the original Bulgakov stories; maybe they do the same. There are still good, funny, outrageous moments, and the entire cast (even Hamm, though he's the weakest link) is great. If you like Russian fabulist lit and really black comedy definitely check it out. I just think it's not all it could have been.",1421884800,,703,4.457364341085271

5767386,4,B00D25MJ8G,"Really liked this series. Would've given it 5 stars, but I feel my critique is biased by the fact that I'm in love with both leading men. Bias aside, Daniel Radcliffe was very funny (he is really a great comic actor) but he was also able to pull off the serious parts, especially at the end.

John Hamm was great too: comically morose (or perhaps, morosely comic), but with enough abject seriousness to make you believe he was really trying to go back and prevent his life from becoming the hell it is at the present.

Without giving too much away: the Young Doctor becomes a morphine addict, and it leads to ruin. Hamm tries to warn his young self, but it does no good. Of course. There are a million things I'd like to tell my younger self, but I doubt she'd listen.

The only thing that really jarred me about this series is the height difference between Hamm and Radcliffe. OK, Radcliffe graduates from medical school at what, 25 years old, absolute minimum. Yet his 17-years-older self (John Hamm) is a whole head taller than Radcliffe.

WHO THE HELL GROWS LIKE, 8 INCHES, BETWEEN AGES 25 AND 45? People stop growing by age 21, at MOST. There is no freaking way Dan Radcliffe could've grown like, 8 inches, after already reaching his adult height.

And oh yeah...he really does bang a super-ugly chick. Twice.",1413158400,,1314,4.5508474576271185

5767401,5,B00D25MJ8G,I just discovered this British show and it is amazingly good. A lot of humor mixed with the sadness of a young Russian doctor who becomes an addict when he is sent from Moscow after graduating to a hospital literally in the middle of nowhere. Through out each episode the young doctor is carrying on a conversation with his older self who has ruined his life with drugs. Daniel Radcliffe and Jon Hamm (playing the older version of the doctor) are both marvelous in their roles. I know this description doesn't sound humorous but it really is a darkly funny show. Highly recommended.,1408665600,3,582,4.660194174757281

But this past Friday I decided to buy it on my kindle since it wasn't available to watch through demand on my tv. As soon as I finished the first episode I was instantly hooked. I loved the humor and also the seriousness of the show. Daniel and Jon were great. They have a good connection and you can see why Jon chose Daniel to play the Young Doctor.  You truly feel for both the young and old doctor how they struggle with their health along coping with a serious addiction. I'm so pumped to see the second season, it really is a great show. The only thing that bothered me was some of the gore but that's going to happen when you watch a medical show. Congrats to BBC America for another fantastic show.",1407715200,4,1004,4.070707070707071

5767408,2,B00D25MJ8G,"If you are a fan of the book, don't worry about bumping this to the top of your must-see list. In and of itself, it's alright, but they made a lot of little changes that significantly changed all of the characters, the entire point of the stories, the likelihood of anyone actually surviving this young doctor's ministrations... What I had seen in trailers, etc., had led me to expect a greater attention to detail than normal, but in the end, there seemed to be very little.
As a show, it started out hilarious, but it rapidly grew less fun and more, not so much dark or depressing, as just repugnant. Though, I have to admit that I am not usually a fan of ""dark comedy,"" so, if that is your cup of tea, take my opinion for what it's worth. The show was also pretty wanting in the character development and inter-character relationships departments, which I found a bit surprising.

5767411,2,B00D25MJ8G,"On the strength of the actors I kept watching all the way through all 4 episodes of this Season One of a British TV series (strangely set in what appears to be Siberia, in 1917).  Side-note: BBC TV seems to have many shows of much higher quality than American TV; perhaps because they have less competition and better funding?  On the other hand, often a ""season"" has much fewer shows than the American audience is used to.  Back to this series: I wasn't able to suspend disbelief.  Even for fiction, there has to be some credibility.  Here, from the outset the young doctor fresh from graduation beginning actual practice, is constantly confronted by an older, much more jaded version of himself.  How is that supposed to be happening?  The show makes no effort at explanation.  By the end of season one there's even a suggestion he's no longer quite the green doctor and may be also confronting an even greener version of himself already...
Yes there is some dark and understated humor, primarily through the expressions, the dialog and the actions of the staff surrounding this doctor in a very small and remote hospital/clinic setting.  If you are not looking for typical American slapstick humor and you can suspend disbelief, you may enjoy this season one.",1405555200,2,1262,4.805555555555555

They do exceedingly well with the weirdness with which they have to work. Story is just a little too far to the left of peculiar for my taste, although I did stick with it and view all four episodes. Different is perhaps another descriptor I would use. Would not recommend this to the squeamish as although the medical situations depicted are entirely unrealistic, they take that line into unsympathetically gruesomely satyric. Perhaps that is what the writers and producers were going for?  Also, wish I had realized the episodes were only 1/2 hour as I would not have bought it at that price as was thinking it was hour-long episodes. In hindsight, now quite frankly glad it was only a total of two hours as don't think I would have enough mind bleach for something longer.",1404432000,3,912,4.560975609756097

5767424,5,B00D25MJ8G,"This exceptional BBC series ran for just four episodes in its debut season...barely enough to satisfy, but sufficient to show us how good a television show can be.  The series is based on Mikhail Bulgakov's short story collection of the same name, and is almost alarmingly true to the book's character and content. Americans probably know Bulgakov best for his masterpiece, ""The Master and Marguerita.""  This short story collection, however, is more personal to the author, being based on his own early life, and presents readers with some of the best Russian writing of the post-revolution era, along with an excellent and always entertaining ethnography of Russian village life...and a Stalin era history lesson. The stories outline the experiences of a young doctor who practiced in Smolesnk, a Russian backwater, from 1916 to 1920.

John Hamm, known to U.S. audiences from his Emmy Award winning role in ""Mad Men"" and Daniel Radcliff of the ""Harry Potter"" franchise, share star billing and a single role. Both play the same doctor, Radcliffe taking on the fresh-out-of medical school lad with no practical experience, and Hamm playing him as a cynical adult.  The series uses the gimmick of having the older Doctor interact with his younger self, advising, criticizing, provoking. It's a conceit we've seen before, but rarely done this well.  Both Radcliffe and Hamm are excellent, and the material gives them plenty to work with.

The young doctor is sent to replace the late and imposing Leopold Leopoldovitch, a physician of imposing whiskers and reputation (and an extensive library of Turkish erotica, illustrated and in color.  When Leopold Leopoldovitch (always referred to by both names and in the most reverent terms) shuffles off the mortal coil, the young man must step into his shoes, not to mention oversized surgical gown.  And the poor kid only shaves every week or so.  But the lad is redeemed by two things:  The appearance of his older-self when his nerve fails, and his skill, albeit untried.  He graduated at the top of his class. ""Five in all 15,"" he brags. ""It was unprecedented!""  Not that this does any good when he has to saw both legs off of a dreadfully maimed 8 year old.

The series is dark, the humor bitter, it's not always funny, people die, even young ones and nice ones. The first episode shows us the fear and optimism of the nave young practitioner; the fourth gives us the same young man already succumbing to depression and burn out.  The writers have captured that special bleakness that inhabits the Russian soul. The most mundane of things can have a saturnine twist; behind the loudest laughter there's awareness of death. It's a Russian thing. Maybe Eastern European, because the Scandinavians have it too. And the Poles. But if the humor reflects this spiritual black hole, it still manages to be funny.  And the parts that are meant to be serious? Well, it's fair to say they are sobering and unforgettable.  We deal with the doctor's own devils as he deals with his sick and injured.  And things can get bloody. Those operations don't pull any punches when it comes to showing us what it was like back in the day. Even the yanking of a rotten tooth can result in the accidental removal of a hunk of a jawbone and some truly impressive hemorrhaging.  The injuries may be gruesome, but they're just about right, given they way most peasants lived and worked.  And no staff of hotty interns to help the good doctor out. Would Doctor House have gotten as far with only the burned out hulk of his former self to advise him? Probably not, but the good doctors do have at least one thing in common, as we see in the enfolding episodes. You'll have to watch. I'm not going to spoil things if I can help it.

(Just an aside: Do Americans know that Hugh Laurie, our haunted Dr. House, is one of England's best known comics and a skilled musician and singer?  ""A Bit of Fry and Laurie"" was a hilarious sketch show. His partner, Stephen Fry, also took a dark turn, going on to star in ""Kingdom."" Fry played the somewhat troubled Peter Kingdom, a not-terribly successful solicitor who juggled family secrets and the legal problems of some eccentric villagers in his small Norwich town.  The sketch show and Fry's series are both worth seeing. And so is ""Jeeves and Wooster,"" the pair's other TV series. Fry is the sensible butler, but Laurie steals the show as the nave Bertie. Whenever he was deep in his Dr. House miseries, I kept waiting for him to break into a rousing rendition of ""47 Ginger Headed Sailors."")

""A Young Doctor's Notebook"" originally aired in the UK last year and pulled in tremendous ratings. Ovation picked it up here in the U.S.  For those who aren't familiar with it, Ovation is a U.S. cable network that's devoted to 'artistic' content.  Mostly good stuff.  Season 1 is now available on Amazon and Netflix.  The producers have promised us Season 2.  The problem, of course, is pulling the stars away from their lucrative day jobs.

You want to see this. It's excellent television, fine acting, good production values, and not the usual predigested television fare.  And you could read the book too.  Five stars for both.",1393804800,5,5183,4.776905829596412
5767425,5,B00D25MJ8G,"Wow. It's rare that I come across a work this original and delightful. Apparently, this series is based on Mikhail Bulgakov's [ The Master and Margarita] short lived medical career.

From the sketches  contained within Bulgakov's A Young Doctor's Notebook, which this series is based on, it's hard to imagine a man less suited to the practice of medicine. Thankfully Bulgakov abandoned his first career for literature.  However, he created an absolutely hilarious world in the Notebook.

I'm not sure it's easy for contemporary viewers to imagine what it was like for an urbane and modern man to be sent to serve in a remote and backward hospital  [circa 1917] in Russia, where the inhabitants of the nearest  village have an almost a medieval view of life. But when the young, academically gifted doctor arrives in the countryside, he not only faces isolation, self doubt and anxiety but also must deal with the  peasants and their incredible limitations. Along the way, we see a syphilis epidemic, an amputation and all sorts of infections, as  he slowly loses his idealism and begins to cope with life on its own terms.

Though this series does not show it, Bulgakov was severely injured during the first world war, and because of the pain, became a morphine addict. Here he succumbs because of  an unknown aliment coupled with the mind numbing isolation he experiences in that remote and isolated region.

The story begins with the doctor as a mature man looking back on his time in the countryside. I was absolutely floored by the casting. Neither  actor  is the sort one would ever imagine as a Russian- but  both  Hamm and Radcliffe were superb. [ Ham actually has a physical resemblance to Bulgakov] . The supporting cast, particularly the nurse and her assistant are a riot, since they look upon the new doctor as a mere child -  a weird one at that - and behave accordingly.

Kudos to the Brits for making this series. It's non-commercial in the best way imaginable.  I read there was a second season in the works--hope Amazon acquires it--and soon!",1392595200,5,2059,4.801136363636363

Instead, to me, it felt more like a satire-border-line-mockery. Please, please, please go and read the short stories instead. I often found myself  chcukling or laughing outloud on the metro on the way to work, while reading them, to which I often got strange looks. But seriously, read the stories.
