7947982,1,B00005NX25,This is the most amateur production that I have seen regarding Organized Crime and the era of prohibition. It is historically inaccurate and poorly produced.,1318982400,,157,5.32
7947983,4,B00005NX25,"This documentary DVD is a very informative expose of the times of prohibition and what Elliot Ness was up aginst during those times.  The details of the lives of the men it examines is worth the price of the video.  This is not an exhaustive documentary of either side, but what it does cover is an education of what the federal government and in particular not one (Ness), but other dedicated crime fighters did to stop a real insideous infestation of crime in America.  Check it out!",1268006400,,485,4.551724137931035
7947984,3,B00005NX25,"People need to know the real facts about the untouchables. If your like me you want to watch a truthful movie. Truth is Elliot Ness did nothing to stop Al Capone or the Chicago outfit. A mafia historian said that Elliot Ness couldn't find cheese in Wisconcin and that's a fact. He did nothin to bring the Chicago out fit down. Tom Dewey is the real untouchable, and even he was unable to bring the mafia to a full hault. Over all the movie gets a sympathetic 3 stars, mostly for insleading info.",1152144000,,495,4.333333333333333
