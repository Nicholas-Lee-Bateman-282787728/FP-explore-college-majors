8313569,2,B001JQQ2EC,"I teach nutrition to middle school students in my life skills class - since this film featured teens, I thought it could be a good way to have a relatable film on food and how the choices made impact our day to day.

Unfortunately, within the first 20 minutes a few swear words were dropped.  Additionally, without warning, I found myself looking at horrible images from slaughter houses and unethical/unkind treatment of animals.  I was so upset I turned the movie off at only the 30 minute mark.

I do believe that the treatment of animals is a huge issue, and is important for people to understand and change.  I didn't like how it was handled in this film.  I also watched ""Food Inc"" and ""Vegucated"" - I was upset by what I saw here as well, but these films handled the delivery of the message much better.",1379376000,,810,4.4391891891891895
8313570,5,B001JQQ2EC,"This remains one of the best food documentaries I have seen. Well organized and executed, it neither shies away from the difficult questions nor oversimplifies the problems and solutions. I highly recommend this to all viewers.",1291766400,3,227,5.333333333333333
8313571,5,B001JQQ2EC,"We all know, or should know, the horrors revolving around the current food industry. With documentaries like ""Fast Food Nation"" and ""Supersize Me,"" we are introduced to the horrors of the junk of fast food restaurants.

""All Jacked Up"" explores this entire industry, from the soda industry to meat processing to the meals fed to children in schools. The film goes further, though, by looking at four teens and their current struggles with food. One struggles with bulimia, another is addicted to sport drinks, another addicted to fast food (particularly McDonald's), and the fourth is dealing with the stress of an on-the-go lifestyle common among many teens today.

This documentary, narrated by actor Bobby Rice, delves into the problems, both health and mental, of children today. Discussions are held with various professionals, including pediatricians, nutritionists, psychologists, those in the 'organic' food industry, and other teens who are taking control of their own diet.

The camerawork is, at times, a little shaky, but it doesn't distract from the overall mission of the film. It encourages progress unlike anything else that I've seen. It shows what could be, and contrasts it against what is. It shows the remarkable change four teens can make by simply taking control of their own lives. It speaks to teens of all ages, and encourages change even in the hectic world we live in today.

I highly recommend this movie to anyone willing to change their mind about food, even if it just means abstaining from eating a hot dog or a bologna sandwich.

And just as a side note, the film was made green. All the food supplied to cast and crew was organic, the production vehicle was a Toyota Prius hybrid, and no fuel burning power generators were used.",1270425600,4,1763,4.982993197278912
8313572,5,B001JQQ2EC,"While this is a very informative and well done film, it should ultimately be shown to kids.  If your a teacher, parent, or someone who just wants another wake up call, watch this movie.  I personally don't waste my money on films that lack substance.  This is one of those films that everyone should have in their library.",1254873600,3,322,4.517241379310345
