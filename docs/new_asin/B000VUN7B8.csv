8220127,3,B000VUN7B8,I have been trying to get hold of this version for ages as I am stuck with the crappy region 2 chopped to pieces version with not great picture quality so I kept looking for better and I finally got it or did I not really made my mind up on this one yet yes there is scenes in it that were cut from british version but actually it doesn't really improve the film at all I don't know if this film is uncut but it does have more footage and in terms of that you can say it is better to have more of the film than less but it doesn't improve the scenes that were missing were not really any more explicit than what had previously been in film so I don't know why they decided to cut them probably because they could so I was a bit disappointed as this film was quite expensive to get hold of picture quality better than region 2 british version but not by much not by much at all if you unlike me can get this film really cheap then get it but I wouldn't unlike me go out of your way to get it extra footage is not worth it,1395446400,,1020,3.861904761904762
