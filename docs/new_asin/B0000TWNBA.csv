8002982,5,B0000TWNBA,LOVED this movie...watched it on tv when it became available...reviews on DVDs say the recording is poor quality...otherwise I would buy a copy...  I seldom buy movies or ever watch them again...this one I would!,1499385600,,212,5.057142857142857
8002983,4,B0000TWNBA,Always loved this movie. Wish it was adapted for wide screen but it's just too old and not popular enough I guess but I love how it reminds me a bit of my 60's childhood.,1465257600,,170,3.8857142857142857

8002985,3,B0000TWNBA,"I was totally disappointed by the storyline in this DVD.  I own it, but I seriously doubt I'll watch it again.",1401580800,,110,4.238095238095238
8002986,3,B0000TWNBA,"I didn't realize I was ordering a children's movie - I thought it was Simon Baker of ""Something New"" in the cast of this show. Wrong. Entirely my own carelessness at fault.",1368662400,,172,4.40625
8002987,5,B0000TWNBA,this is an older movie that most people never even heard of.  the movie came in good time and in great condition.  great family movie,1360368000,,133,4.28
8002988,4,B0000TWNBA,"Very hard to find this movie. Very grateful for the DVD. The quality is ok, it's watchable, it's just a bit grainy and looks like it came off of some old VHS, but if you can get past that then you'll still enjoy the movie with no problems.",1359849600,,239,4.0
8002989,5,B0000TWNBA,"This is a charming story about 2 boys (about 10 years old) having fanciful dreams about defeating older bullies, being accepted for who they are, and attempting to build a rocket ship to fly to the moon. They succeed in all but the last plan, although it does help make the first two a success. Loved the performance by the kids, especially Sam (Simon R. Baker, a Native American). Also loved the older deaf girl, who had a good message about having confidence in one's self. Very well done, not in a smarmy overly sentimental way, just natural. Favorite scene: the school lunchroom food fight with the kids' ""secret weapon"" kept in a locked box. Hilarious!",1330214400,,657,4.672413793103448
8002990,4,B0000TWNBA,"The first time I watched this movie was about 13 years ago with my children, now Im watching it with my grandchildren. Wonderful movie, very imaginative. The kids love it. Timeless",1204761600,,180,4.838709677419355
8002991,4,B0000TWNBA,"...you will really enjoy this movie.  There is magic in this movie, and I mean the kind that moves you, not the kind that pulls rabbits from a hat.  The performances are all wondefully rendered.  Philip Spink has a propensity to cross the line of tolerable absurdity at times (the kid whose family owns the junkyard for example) but all in all, this film is great lesson in imagination.

The only bad thing is that the quality of the DVD is really bad.  I taped this movie off of Starz! a couple years ago and the quality is actually better.  The extras were nice (Spink and cast commenting on the movie).  It seems to have been mastered from VHS and not from the original masters.

Still, this digital format is better than none.",1109548800,,730,4.43609022556391
