2058542,1,B00023BM4S,"This is living proof that crap needs a million dollar budget. This movie was bland. It had no style, no original elements, and overall, nothing good about it. Well, I take that back, the main character's husband had the best mullet. But other than that, nada. Unlike the original Howling, which had awesome and unique looking werewolves, this one the werewolves are, well, wolves. No make up required. They turned into the average, everyday wolf. Didn't put a whole lot a work into that did they? This movie was a B-movie, but didn't have a lot of the GOOD B-movie elements.

What I learned from Howling 4: Howling 3 is way better as a B-movie.

If you liked this movie, I recomend: Banging your head against a brick wall, because for as much pain as your going to go through watching this movie, you might as well inflict it on yourself.",1091836800,4,838,4.543046357615894

2058544,3,B00023BM4S,"It is here that we see the initial involvement of Clive Turner in this series (look for my review of Howling: New Moon Rising). Although this is better, by far, then the childish part 3, by no means is it wonderful.  Personally, I liked this film. The director has been a genre staple for  quite some time (you may be surprised that he also directed Legend of Hell  House). It is this choice that lends primarily to the redeeming value of  this film... at least I saw what the director was trying to accomplish. It  has been well published (in horror mag Fangoria) that it is indeed the  fault of Clive Turner for the disasterous handling of this film. He  re-edited it, fired the director, and turned it into what we see today. His  attempts to destroy the film did not entirely work, however, because I did  like it. The werewolves were cool... especialy the grand-daddy at the end  and the actors did all they could to heighten the fare. So the film  suffers, not because of Mr. Hough (the director) or Romy Winsor or Michael  T. Weiss (the stars), but because of the unredeeming Clive Turner. An  example of Mr. Turners work can be viewed in the pathetic Howling: New Moon  Rising. I for one, say check this one out, Howling 4 is not nearly all that  bad. I do hope that, one day (anyone reading?) that a special edition DVD  of this film is made and John Hough is brought in to supervise the editing  of his original vision.",952560000,13,1429,4.413793103448276

2058658,1,B00023BM4S,"Pretty much complete crap from start to finish. Not enough Wolf for a werewolf movie. The melting transformation is well, stupid. It doesn't fit. While the melting transformation is happening you see other wolves in mid-transformation (why are they not melting too?) then you will see a wolf transform from mid to full out wolf in a matter of seconds. Again, no melting.

Despite the horrible effects what sealed the ""this movie is utter"" crap deal for me was the acting. I didn't like any of the characters because their dialogue was horrid. Especially during the end.

Save your time and  money. Avoid The Howling IV

There is all kinds of howling and her husband and others aren't even concerned.  The film does not have very good special effects and seems to drag and tends to diminish the story.

There are some genuinely good elements in this film.  It balances mystery and suspense with a few ""jump scares"" and shocking transformations. Its a murder mystery that manages to tie all the events together by the end of the film. The pace is a bit slow, but there's enough eye candy for both women and men to help move through the slow parts. The film was made in the late 1980's, so it feels quite dated.  But as a whole its not unwatchable.",1402358400,,618,4.318965517241379
2058686,1,B00023BM4S,Very cheesy sequel. Amazon Prime needs to add the original Howling starring Dee Wallace! That is a true horror flick!,1397260800,,117,4.9
2058687,2,B00023BM4S,"The fourth entry in the werewolf series is also based on the novel ""The Howling"". According to those who have read it (me excluded) , this is a more faithful adaptation than Dante's 1981 original although the quality is much, much lower and by much lower I mean... think ""The Howling - MADTV Version"" complete with a horrible, dated period pop piece with incredibly cheesy lyric (""something evil ... something dangerous""...oooh yeah) that opens and closes the film.

The story begins with our pretty protagonist, Marie Adams (Romy Windsor), a successful writer who steps into an elevator on her way to see her agent and good friend, Tom, played by the chiseled Antony Hamilton. During her meeting, Marie begins to experience bizarre visions of a mysterious nut .. I mean, nun, that ultimately leads to an epic breakdown. Upon the insistence of her doctor, Marie's husband, Richard (played by Kenny Loggins. Oh wait... sorry, I think it's Michael T Weiss with a mullet) takes her to an isolated cabin in the woods in the small town of Drago for some much needed quiet time and relaxation. Unfortunately, her serene surroundings do nothing to ease her discomfort as unpleasant visions that hint at violence continue to plague her and the eerie sounds of a wolf's howl keeps her nerves on edge. When a fan and former nun, Janice (Susanne Severeid), who is in Drago investigating the disappearance of her friend, Sister Ruth, meets up with Marie, they soon discover the town has a sinister past and Marie's visions may have been a warning to stay away.

Directed by John Hough, ""Howling IV: The Original Nightmare"" lacks everything that made the original a classic. What makes this sequel so frustrating is that despite having a pretty good story, a good location and some good actors, none are utilized to their full potential and this entry sadly never raises above mediocrity. Even with the film's obvious low budget, with creative minds and a good director, this still could have been a good sequel or at least a memorable one. Let's remember that the 2 sequels before it were so sub-standard that it would be nearly impossible to make a movie that rivalled that level of awfulness and it has been proven time after time, especially in the horror genre, that a good, quality film is possible despite budget restraints, ""Halloween"" anyone? Unfortunately with this offering, the skills and creativity that have turned sub-standard material into memorable horror movies is sadly not present and this entry will remain forever buried deep within the depths of B-horror film obscurity.

I will admit that this sequel is not as awful as I remembered. Maybe it's because my standards have been lowered or maybe it's because unlike the first time I saw this over 2 decades ago, I knew what to expect or maybe it's because when viewing this objectively, you realize there is some good buried deep within the narrative as it is desperately trying to tell a story. There are elements to this tale that would have made a fascinating horror piece such as the dark history of Drago; the origins of its townspeople and the mysterious bell tower; the bizarre nun, her sinister ramblings and the use of satanic possession being the source of werewolves is an interesting take on the folk-lore (at least on film) but unfortunately all this was left under developed. The end result is a life-less, slow moving, utterly dull sequel and the director must take the fall. The directing is haphazard, amateurish and at times, downright awful. The editing is even worse. It has been stated that no one creates a bad movie on purpose, this film may have you questioning that as scene after scene displays nothing more than sloppy and shoddy film work.

The actors are also frustrating. They are photogenic but they move awkwardly from scene to scene giving passable to laughable performances. Our protagonist, Romy Windsor is fairly cute but emotionally, she is a hit and a miss throughout. I am a bit sympathetic towards her as she pretty much has to carry the entire picture and she did try her best with the material that was thrown her way. Her awkwardness is evident during the scenes where she has to emit fear and paranoia. Where she is at her best is during her more candid moments or when paired with the film's other male actor, Antony Hamilton. Michael T Weiss does not get a pass either as his performance is not all that great and at times is downright dull. It also doesn't help that his character is not the least bit likable but great actors are able to make even some of the sleaziest characters enduring. Other members of the cast fair a bit better. The late Antony Hamilton is likable enough and his character is at least less flat than Weiss' but he does not receive much screen time while Severeid, who plays the tormented former nun, is good and delivers the best performance here.

There are some great location shots and some effective atmosphere- creepy forests enveloped in crawling mist, a quaint, underdeveloped town with unpaved roads. The bell tower, which is at the centre of the story is also a noteworthy addition to the setting. This movie was filmed in South Africa (masquerading as the US) and although this is a plus for the location shots, it is a negative in regards to several of the actors performances since it appears they have been (annoyingly) dubbed over.

The make-up effects range from passable to poor however there is a transformation scene here that needs to be seen to be believed. I am assuming it is due to the film's budget restraint that a proper werewolf transformation scene could not be accomplished however the melting man sequence, despite not making a whole lot of sense, is quite a spectacular sight and many characters are seen during the last quarter of the movie in mid-transformation, sporting some facial hair and elongated fangs. There are two instances where you see an actual werewolf in full transformation. The first time is a close-up of the creature where you can appreciate for a few short seconds its glowing eyes, angry snarl and slime oozing mouth. In another scene, towards the finale, you finally get to see the main beast materialize, .. well, sort of, this transformation scene is utterly lack-luster but when the beast is fully transformed it is impressive yet, like the first creature we see, it is severely under-utilized. It does nothing more than sway about its surroundings, showing us it's tonsils, fangs and massive under-bite. Despite the work that went into the creation of this man-beast, we only see seconds of it on screen.

This is a bare-bones DVD. There are no extra's and the picture quality and sound are okay. No better or worse than the previous VHS release. The DVD case and cover art though, left me scratching my head. I like the front cover art, although the three men in the graveyard makes no sense at all as it has no relation to this film, but the screen captures in the back are all from the second sequel ""Howling III: The Marsupials"". Really? I understand this film is no masterpiece, but mindless, sloppy work such as this is grating. It serves absolutely no purpose in having a DVD back cover showcase several scenes from another motion picture. Fail.

Overall, ""Howling IV: The Original Nightmare"" had a lot of potential but unfortunately, it fell into the wrong hands. The end result is a below average, forgettable werewolf movie marred with lame dialogue, horrible editing, wooden performances and lacking in thrills and actual scares. With that said, it is not the worst sequel in the long series, that honor goes to the atrocious ""Howling 7: New Moon Rising"" followed closely by ""Howling II""; it is definitely not the best either, that honor goes to ""Howling V: the Rebirth"". It is worth the watch if you are a horror nut, like myself, and have a soft spot for old school, low budget horror films but don't expect much. Be warned, repeated viewings will have you humming its awful theme song repeatedly to yourself.",1392076800,,8011,4.795800144822592

A few weeks ago I came across the book of the ""The Howling"" and became interested in the movie series. Since this movie seemed the closest to the original novel I decided to rent it at Netflix. What a let down! The production values of this film are in par with the average porn flick. Where did they find these actors? (actors? hahaha, I guess I do have a sense of humor after all). These puppets acted worse that the average porn star. I felt absolutely no compassion for any of them. The acting is actually so bad that it becomes offensive. How do losers like those find work even in a cheap rip off like this? The acting really felt like a terrible mix of the lowest of low quality soap opera and a porn flick. Sad. All in all an absolute mess. The best part of the movie is seeing that loser Richard melting away (to transform into a werewolf?).

2058720,2,B00023BM4S,"This is a perfect example of a ""Werewolf FAIL.""  There's a lot of soap operatic relationship drama, hardly a werewolf in sight and a lot of lying and anxiety; basically, this is a Lifetime Network movie about werewolves with a VERY LOW budget.

FRANCHISE/SEQUEL NOTE:  Other than a lot of parallels with the original (a remake really), I find no story-based connection between this, The Howling (1981; the best of the series), Howling II: Your Sister is a Werewolf (1985; random and hilarious) or Howling 3: The Marsupials (1987; still a lot of weird fun).  Based on quality, it's awful that the destitute part IV even tried to remake the excellence of part one!  These movies get better as you work your way back to the original.

Marie (Romy Windsor) keeps seeing a vanishing nun, frightening reflections, and visions of claw marks.  She needs to clear her mind.  So, along with their hideous his and hers 80s mullets, Marie and her husband Richard (Michael T. Weiss) leave to spend three weeks in some secluded place called Drago which bathes in the accents of the locals' shallow gene pool.

As they get settled in they meet a local shopkeeper Eleanor (Lamya Derval) who, like Elisabeth Brooks from the original, is a sultry minx with street walker make-up and an occult rat bone necklace who makes eyes at other women's husbands.  [Also, just like in the original, Marie's husband and the local cultette will eventually do it.]  Between this mild flirtation, some dreams about wolves and losing her pet dog in the woods, Marie's stress builds right back up.  The director really shoehorns these scenes, along with more visions of this random nun and the ghosts (or visions?) of some disturbed and confused elderly couple, into a rather short period of time.  However, I fail to appreciate it as this movie just drags on with no sign of satisfaction in sight.  POV shots, slow-motion running and scenes of misty forest all dreadfully fail to contribute to the mood.

Another vacationer, Janice, comes to Drago.  Janice used to be a nun and knew the nun from Marie's visions.  This dream nun died after a being plagued by the sound of howling and had nervous breakdown.  This ""revelation"" was no more exciting to me than sipping from a two-day old glass of flat Diet Coke.  Halfway through this movie you'd think it's about visions of a nutty nun and not about werewolves at all--really, AT ALL!

Later Richard meets up for a tryst with Eleanor.  She makes an instant transformation into a werewolf, bites him, then instantly transforms into a wolf (off camera, of course) and runs off.

Richard's transformation is the opener to the only gory sequence in the whole movie--but it's long.  It's deliciously revolting, but it doesn't make up for the rest of this awful film. It starts with Richard literally melting to death into a puddle of...well...himself. Then he emerges as a slimy, slowly expanding werewolf--it's certainly original.  At this time, the other townspeople are transforming and the creature quality is all over the place.  Some look lame, like trolls or orcs or something, many are simply red-eyed dogs, and one looked REALLY cool with a neat abomination of an intermediate transformation phase. Were it not for this sequence and some nudity, this film would have fit in perfectly on the Lifetime Network.

The acting is something painful.  But don't worry, it's complemented by VERY bad editing--day to night to day transitions between cuts in one scene, seeing things on screen waaay to briefly, some of the dialogue is off or dubbed, and other misdeeds of post-production filmmaking.

This ""sequel"" is called The Original Nightmare--I can't help but to wonder why.  Perhaps an attempt to make us think this is a prequel even though it relies on the premise of the original as it is really a remake.  The husband meets a local culty slut in the boondock town, kills a rabbit and cheats on his wife with a chick who turns into a werewolf during the act and bites him--making this the third of four Howling movies with a mid-coitus transformation, four if you count the subtlety of the sex scene ""change"" in part 3.",1358553600,,4136,4.817280453257791

The plot kickoff is basically the same as the 1981 original: woman and husband head off to a forest cabin to help said woman recover from a breakdown/traumatic incident.  The woman meets the slightly ""off"" locals and hears strange howling at night, and so the horror begins...

The main, glaring difference between ""The Howling"" and ""The Howling IV"" is BUDGET.  I'm not sure what possessed them to want to remake the original, but it certainly wasn't to improve on the former's special effects.  In the end, this film resembles nothing so much as a Lifetime made-for-TV movie...plus a tiny bit of nudity, a little bit of gore and a whole bunch of ""werewolves"" towards the end.

I happen to love werewolf movies, and I also happen to really like Lifetime movies, so I actually enjoyed this one!  It has all the prerequisites of a good Lifetime flick.  We have our pretty, spunky heroine, Marie (Romy Windsor), as the traumatized writer; the ridiculously SEXY husband Richard (played by the ridiculously SEXY Michael T. Weiss); the also-sexy Australian co-worker/friend pining after our heroine (Antony Hamilton); the beautiful femme fatale werewolf (Lamya Derval); the amateur sleuth/best friend who also happens to be a gorgeous blonde ex-nun (Susanne Severeid); and a whole cast of creepy townsfolk, including a sheriff with a stereotypical Southern, backwoods accent...except that this is set in California!!

There are some glitches in this movie, however, literally and figuratively.  The literal glitches:  The editing is really choppy in some spots.  At times it seems as if the actors' voices are dubbed, not as badly as a Godzilla movie but apparent nonetheless.  There are also times when something will be shown for way too short a time - literally a fraction of second - and you're like, ""What the hell was that?!""  Or there will be a scene set at night, and for a quick nanosecond, there is a day scene, and then back to night!  Hmm... The acting is also kinda choppy.  Some actors are strong in their ability, while a couple are worse than I would be, which is really saying something!

The werewolves themselves pretty much remain unseen until the final 20 minutes or so of the film. Then, suddenly, it's Werewolf-palooza!  :-)  The werewolf effects in this film are inconsistent, though.  Sometimes they're pretty damn good (we see a pretty scary one way too briefly about halfway into the film, and there are 2 near the end that are done pretty well).  All other times, however, they're either non-existent (black dogs with red eyes are used frequently) or very poor (some of the local werewolves look like comical, low-budget 1930s versions of werewolves: people with glued on facial hair, fake fangs and claws).  But this movie also boasts what I think is one of the goriest, most original transformation scenes in a werewolf movie.  Hideous and gross, in a fun, campy horror movie way!

Also, what the heck is up with the DVD cover??  I actually like the front design...even though the people in the cemetery have nothing to do with this movie.  And the back cover!!  I kept waiting for some of the scenes depicted on the back to show up in the movie and they never did!  It turns out that the movie stills shown on the back cover are from ""The Howling III: The Marsupials,"" a completely different movie!  What the heck...who DOES that??

Despite this being far, far, FAR from a perfect film, I enjoyed it, flaws and all.  It's soo 80s, from the awesome, smooth jazz opening theme song (""Something evil, something dangerous..."" LOL!) to the big shoulder pads and the tight, tight jeans (on men).  I loved watching Marie and her newfound best friend run around to solve the mystery of the demented, missing nun and the strange howling in the woods.  The ending seemed rushed and inconclusive, but then we get to hear that theme song again!  :-)

All in all, I think this movie is fun and enjoyable for a little cheap diversion.  If you are a borderline obsessive fan of werewolves or Lifetime movies, give this one a go, but know what you're getting here!  (And hey, if you're just a casual horror fan, you gotta check out the transformation scene though, if nothing else!  Ha, it's definitely unique!  And thanks to the magic powers of the internet, you can find just that part pretty easily, and for free!)

RECOMMENDATION:  Best enjoyed with good company and plenty of alcohol.  :-)",1352332800,,4534,4.804909560723514
2058724,2,B00023BM4S,"Okay here's the premise -- what would The Howling have been like if it was made by somebody without the talent or good sense of Joe Dante? Well, thanks to the fourth of the dire sequels, now we know.

Before I completely blow both barrels of silver shot into this one, there are a few good things to say, so I will get that out of the way first.  1. It serves as a lesson how not to adapt a book to the big screen (even though Howling IV went straight to video - little wonder). 2. It shows how much of a great piece of work The Howling is, simply by comparison.

As it's another version of the same novel, you already pretty much know the plot ... a disturbed woman goes to a retreat of some kind in order to put her troubled mind at ease, and decides to investigate a mysterious howling she hears in the woods. The only positive thing I'll say about the adaptation is that it retains the strong religious element from the book, which was neglected in the Joe Dante version. This movie is a lot closer to Gary Brandner's novel, but it lacks any of the flavour, metaphor or subtext.

First off, you won't care about the characters; they are so poorly developed, or should I say underdeveloped, that you can't help but feel nothing for them or their respective situations. Sadly, for a werewolf movie it just isn't scary. Director John Hough may manage to stay faithful to the book like some kind of a literary parrot, but apparently he hasn't heard of those things we call mood, pace or style ... in no way does this feel like a horror movie.

It's not even a particularly well-made film, as I caught several errors in continuity. The acting isn't great - it's not even good, as all of the cast seem to belong on a soap opera, but by no means is that the worst thing about this movie. For some odd reason all the dialogue is dubbed - Badly. And there's no excuse for it ... it just distracts you from the rest of the scene (or was that the intention?). The special effects are not very good, but fortunately you don't see any of them until the last ten minutes of the movie when they're all thrown together in a chaotic hodge podge of half-wolves, dogs with glowing red eyes, and very puppet looking monstrosities.

So, why do we need this movie? It sure beats me. There's absolutely no reason to watch it, unless you're curious about the original novel but can't be bothered to read it. Joe Dante's The Howling is superior in every single way, and will thankfully be remembered in the history of horror films long after this one has faded into obscurity.",1350259200,,2555,4.345911949685535
2058745,3,B00023BM4S,"Unlike the previous films in the series, Howling IV: The Original Nightmare was released to direct-to-video (aka VHS) in 1988, originally released by Warner Bros., but Echo Bridge Home Entertainment now owns the rights to it.

I've only seen a handful of the Howling movies out of the eight movies that have been made so far, the last one,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Howling-Reborn/dp/B005CA4SEC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Howling Reborn</a>, came out last year. I recall seeing this movie advertise on a local channel in the early 90s and of course my mom let me watch it probably just so I would stop pestering her about it. The movie had commercials, so naturally it would be edited for broadcast television. For the actually movie, I only remember bits and pieces of it until I finally bought the DVD a few months ago for only five dollars.

For anyone who has actually read&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gary-Brandner-s-The-Howling/dp/1927112001/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gary Brandner's The Howling</a>&nbsp;novel, you'll know that the first movie barely went by it, but Howling IV: The Original Nightmare is the only movie that almost completely goes by the book except that the names have been changed and there is no rapist in it. The film was made for fewer than two-million dollars. It won the 1988 Golden Chainsaw award for Best Direct-to-Video Feature from Fangoria, but it received mostly negative reviews from fans due to the small amount of time the werewolves appeared.

The movie opens up with author Marie Adams (played by Romy Windsor) meeting up with her agent, but right there and then she has strange visions about a nun and a werewolf. She screams like a madwoman and ends up in the hospital. The doctors recommend to her husband Richard (played by Michael T. Weiss) that she should take a break from her writing and get away from the city.

Soon enough, Richard and Marie are leaving Los Angeles and they go to a small town called Drago, where they rent a small cabin. On the very first night, Marie hears a peculiar wolf's howl coming from the woods.

They go into town the next day and explore and antique shop owned by the strange Eleanor (played by Lamya Derval), whom happens to take a liking to Richard. Later when they return to the cabin, Marie goes for a walk with her small dog. The dog gets loose and runs further into the woods. She later finds what looks like the remains of her dog, but when Richard goes to find it, he only finds a toy.

Marie visits, Mrs. Ormstead, a neighbor and the owner of a local store, and she informs Marie that the previous couple who stayed in their cabin had mysteriously disappeared. While walking back to the cabin, Marie once again has visions of a nun and for a brief moment she thought the nun was before her, but it turned out to be only Eleanor in a cape. When she finally returns to the cabin, she has more strange visions this time of a man and a woman, possibly the previous couple who stayed in the cabin. She tries to tell Richard, but he doesn't believe and storms out to spend time with his new ""friend"" Eleanor.

A woman, Janice Hatch, shows up at the cabin claiming to be a fan of Marie's writings, but she turns out to be an ex-nun searching for her friend, Sister Ruth, who disappeared the previous year, but later returned talking about the devil and hearing the howls of wolves. Ruth later died for unknown reasons and Janice has come to find out what happened to her. The two women work together to uncover the startling truth about Drago's residents.

The majority of low-budget horror movies, especially the ones that go direct-to-video or now of days go straight to the DVD five-dollar-bin, have bad acting, but in the Howling IV the acting is decent. I'm aware that some of the die hard Howling fans don't care for the lack of werewolves, but it didn't bother me one bit. I like the Gothic atmosphere throughout the movie. Yes, there a few slow moments, but it helps build up the mystery of what is going on with the town of Drago, even though we all know that there has to be some kind of werewolf involved. There is not a lot of violence in the movie compared to today's horror flicks. If it wasn't for the brief nudity and language, the movie could easily pass as PG-13! Howling IV is not the greatest werewolf move, but it is one of the better Howling sequels.",1347494400,,4459,4.81201044386423

It falls short of the original in some ways, but still holds the ""who is it"" theme.  It also fits in with the fnial movies of the series as they often fall back to this one as the start.

The DVD is very nice and the movie is also better than some other 80s cheap movies.  The actors may not be well known today, but they were there when this was filmed.  It holds much better to the original than the hammy acting in the second movie.  For the price paid, this was a steal.

2058774,3,B00023BM4S,"""Howling IV: The original nightmare"" is one of those sequels to a revered horror film that is almost universally trashed by people who see it and even people who don't, which is something that can be understood to an extent. The film can't compare to the polished nature of the original film, nor can it compete with that film's revolutionary and downright groundbreaking make-up effects. Add to that that ""Howling IV"" has been butchered by its producer in post-production to create more of a contemporary and commercial horror film on its original release. But that's not the whole story. The truth is that for all the film's short comings there are some merits to it and they are not as few as many people think. The film is much truer to the atmospheric and suspensful storyline of the original book than any other film in ""The Howling"" series (much more so than the classic, but tongue-in cheek original film) and is also directed with much style and a good amount of atmosphere and suspense by John Hough (who directed the excellent ghost stoty ""The Legend of hell house"") whose style still shows and gives the film an unnerving, eerie feel to it even after the producer's tinkering. Add to that that the film has a very good story, effective if not stellar make-up effects and manages to end on an extremely eerie note and you get a very good B-movie that should be viewed with its low-budget in mind. This is a film that will please fans of the original book more than anyone else, but will also please fans who like good, intriguing horror stories that are presented on screen with a minimum of flash.

8021323,3,B00023BM4S,"Released in 1988, Howling IV: The Original Nightmare chronicles events in the Southern Cal desert town of Drago, where a writer (Romy Windsor) goes to heal after a mental breakdown, which is hard to do when she gets caught up in a mystery about demons and werewolves. Michael T. Weiss plays her husband while Antony Hamilton plays her hunky friend from Los Angeles. Susanne Severeid appears as a fan of the writer who becomes her assistant sleuth while Norman Anstey in on hand as the aloof sheriff. Lamya Derval plays a shop-owner with cat-like eyes and torpedo breasts (sorry).

The movies subtitled The Original Nightmare because its more faithful to Gary Brandners original novel, which doesnt mean its better, not even close. The low-budget prevents it from being anything more than a decent sequel with a rushed, awkward ending. Unlike the classic The Howling (1981), werewolves are scarce, but its superior to Howling II (1985) and Howling III (1987) in that it throws out Phillippe Moras goofy camp and general eccentricities.

I like the slow-build mystery and the cast. Theres some quality full moon ambiance as well and Windsor & Severeid make for an effective female team. Moreover, Weiss is one of the few actors who could get away with a mullet. While the bulk of the movie was shot in the sticks of South Africa, and you can tell, its not THAT bad of a substitute for the desert wilderness of Southern Cal. Actually, it makes for an interesting change of pace for the barely-connected series of stand-alone werewolf flicks.

The film runs 94 minutes and was shot in South Africa with some parts in Fresno & Los Angeles, California. It was directed by John Hough from a script by Clive Turner and Freddie Rowe. Clive would continue serious work with the franchise on 1989s Howling V: The Rebirth and 1995s Howling: New Moon Rising.
