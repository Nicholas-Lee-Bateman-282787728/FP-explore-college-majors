4230989,4,B003YLKFJS,"A nice, lighthearted story to watch with the family.  Once I got over the discrepancies from the original legend, I quite enjoyed it.",1376352000,3,133,4.782608695652174
4230990,4,B003YLKFJS,Great show. Good entertainment without all the trash you get on tv anymore. I recommend it for all ages above 10,1376006400,3,112,4.380952380952381
4230991,5,B003YLKFJS,Have done a couple of reviews on Merlin already but if you have not watched it yet I think you should if you like fantasy adventure  - it is a great family show but very entertaining for adults too and how many shows are there that you can enjoy watching with your kids?  It's funny and emotional and full of exciting action.  The characters grow on you very quickly and it's well acted with lots of great guest actors. Special effects are very good (considering it is made for tv) - guys who worked on this worked on Harry Potter films so that gives you an idea - if you loved Harry Potter you will love Merlin too!  Warning - it is addictive!!  You must start with season one of course and watch them all in sequence.,1375142400,3,719,4.218978102189781
4230992,5,B003YLKFJS,"I can't help but have a good review...Merlin is the best TV series there. It is a family oriented ""fluffy"" remake of the Arthurian legend but with Merlin being a young man who isn't aware of his destiny yet because Prince Arthur's hate-filled father bans magic in his kingdom upon death. It has sorrow, drama and the best part...the humor. The bonding and loyalty of the two main characters are what makes the show. Merlin's faith in and loyalty to Prince/King Arthur is resolute, constant and unshakable. The acting is superb..",1373328000,3,528,4.813186813186813
4230993,5,B003YLKFJS,THIS SHOW IS VERY ENTERTAINING ANY I CAN STILL WATCH WITH MY CHILD. WE HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING THE WHOLE SEREIS. STILL OK FOR FAMILY.,1371427200,,129,4.416666666666667
4230994,5,B003YLKFJS,I really enjoyed catching up on the episodes I missed - I loved this show and am so sorry it has ended.,1370044800,,103,3.727272727272727
4230995,5,B003YLKFJS,I love this series. The characters are all well matched and some are lovable. The story is not the Camelot we've known before and in that way we don't know what is coming next. The acting is great.,1361664000,2,197,4.2105263157894735
4230996,5,B003YLKFJS,"The second series is even better than the first, bringing more depth to the characters. You have Merlin falling in love for the first time with the Lady of the Lake, an Arthur/Guinevere/Lancelot love triangle, Uther marrying a Troll! Arthur meeting his dead Mother, The Witchfinder accusing Merlin, Morgana & Gaius of using magic. Morgana realises that she really does have the power of magic & starts using it for 'The Dark Arts', the reappearence of the mysterious Mordred & Morgause & The Great Dragon demanding even more & more of Merlin! In the series finale Merlin finally gets to meet his Father whom he assumes is dead after what his Mother has previously told him & finds out that he is 'The Last Dragon Lord' only then to have him cruelly taken away from him. Merlin inherits the title of Dragon Lord which develops more in season 3 when he can command the Great Dragon to do his bidding.

I have bought both music CD's that accompany the series they are dramatic, haunting & include a touch of romance all at the same time.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Merlin-Series-Two-Original-Television-Soundtrack/dp/B002YEGYYG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Merlin: Series Two - Original Television Soundtrack</a>

4230997,5,B003YLKFJS,"One of my favorite TV service, would have liked to see a season 6",1437955200,,65,3.7142857142857144
4230998,5,B003YLKFJS,Great Series! Wish there were more seasons.  Acting and Writing is excellent!,1431907200,,77,5.416666666666667
4230999,5,B003YLKFJS,"Really enjoy this show.  Have all the kids and grand kids involved with it, too.  If you are a hard core Arthurian, you might find yourself mumbling quite a bit about how it doesn't follow the story.  Merlin is a young man probably just a little younger than Arthur.  Gwen is black and a serving girl.  Merlin can't use his magic openly because of the ban on magic.
If you want just a fun show with magic and funny scenarios and can enjoy it for what it is, then you've got it.",1424476800,2,477,4.141304347826087
4231000,5,B003YLKFJS,Even better than Season 1. What a blast! So much fun with lots of laughs and adventures.,1417824000,,88,4.235294117647059
4231001,5,B003YLKFJS,"great family show, we need more shows like this",1405296000,,47,4.333333333333333
4231002,1,B003YLKFJS,"I had watched part 1 under IMOB but when I tried to watch part 2 I was told that I needed Silverlight which I could open.  When I tried to delete this video from my account I could not do that.  So, I am very displeased with the whole thing.  I did not mind the $1.99 plus tax, but I would have liked to get what I paid for.

4231003,5,B003YLKFJS,"I can't say enough about how great this series is.  I totally love this genre and haven't found very many movies or TV shows that are as good as this one.

The acting, episode stories, and FX were much better than I initially expected, but after having watched season 1, I knew season 2 was going to be awesome.  It was!",1394668800,,320,4.213114754098361
4231004,5,B003YLKFJS,Great character development. Generally follows much of the legend. Merlin is becoming more purposeful. Abd the main characters are perfect.,1393372800,,139,6.0
4231005,4,B003YLKFJS,I have bought the first two seasons of Merlin and he is a remarkable person.  Many people with his powers wouldn't have the patience to serve the sometimes slow-witted Arthur but time after Merlin perseveres.  I'll probably buy the third season in the near future.,1376956800,2,264,4.844444444444444
4231006,2,B003YLKFJS,"The conflict (basis for all plots) is always the same:
* Arthur Pendragon is conflicted with his father Uthur Pendragon over loyalty vs. what his feels is right.
* Uthur Pendragon is a static character (almost comically) who demands loyalty, hates/abhores  magic.
* Gaias (Merlin's mentor) evolves very rapidly into becoming Merlin's-father figure but then stays the same.
* Morgana (Uthur's charge/ward) evolves over time but almost never shows any internal conflict over those changes (which any real person would exhibit).
* Guenevere changes and starts off as obsequious mouse to a woman with mettle, but again, her evolution is sporadic and inconsistent.
* Merlin is the only interesting character. Very sympathetic to the viewer, he gains attention and captivates the audience throughout the seasons. He adapts, changes, grows with each new episode. That doesn't seem intuitive to the viewer. We all like to see people improve from hour to hour, from month to month. But, that never happens in the real world. How authors handle that is to place a ""pause"" in the narrative: ""months pass...""

The plots nearly follow the same tedious pattern:
1) Main characters of the episode are introduced and the secondary plot is laid out.
2) Some alarm or catastrophe moves some into action (primary plot).
3) People move into position.
4) People gather information report their findings. Inevitably it's magic.
5) Others have to be convinced (typically Uthur)
6a) If Uthur acts the castle erupts.
6b) If Arthur learns that his father is once again unwilling to do what is right, he goes with Merlin at his side
7) They fight an unconquerable enemy with the help of subtle magic.
8) Arthur gets the credit, is honored, and Merlin is more or less fine with it.

Basic mythos/anomalies are:
1) Magic must be avoided on pain of death.
2) Merlin is always in conflict to tell Arthur his ""suicidal secret.""
3) Their landscape has snow-capped mountains.
4) A horse can gallop nonstop for hours.
5) Travel from one end of the kingdom can be made by horseback in one day often without any indication that they (or their horses) need rest, food, or... you know what I mean.
6) No matter how many of their knights are wounded or killed, there's always more for cannon fodder, seemingly hanging around in the wings.",1376611200,3,2298,4.917525773195877
8409626,5,B003YLKFJS,"i give very few things 5 stars. in fact, most things i watch i'm disgusted with & wish there were negative ratings, for a 1 star isn't low enough.  but this is actually enjoyable, for the most part .

One thing that continues to annoy me though is how unrealistic it is for the time period.  for example, Jousting....i'm pretty sure back then it wasn't wood.  when somebody lost, it meant they  died with a spear made of metal impaling them.  if you want to glorify Arthur to keep to the original tall-tale stories, that's fine with me.  but you'd think to make the rest somewhat believable.  At least this time they dressed him up in some more protective armor, whereas last season they forgot which side the heart was on, and how low it sat inside the chest.",1515715200,,760,4.41726618705036
