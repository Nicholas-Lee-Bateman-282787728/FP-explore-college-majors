Having been employed by Columbia Pictures in the 1970's, I had the pleasure of attending a showing of the Original feature ""EMMANUELLE"", starring the beautiful Sylvia Kristel.  I like so many others, fell in lust with this woman.  I remember when ""Emmanuelle"" came out on VHS, I started looking for whatever I could find starring Ms Kristel.  When I heard that Ms Kristel had appeared in a European TV Movie, I had to have it.  Also, my 2nd favorite JAMES BOND actor, George Lazenby is in this film.
So, yes, I am glad I bought this DVD. And anyone who is a Sylvia Kristel fan, I suggest picking up this movie.",1428883200,,654,4.46218487394958
