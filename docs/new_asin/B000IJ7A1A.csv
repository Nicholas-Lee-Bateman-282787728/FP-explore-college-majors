""Breaking Silence: The Case That Changed the Face of Human Rights (Advancing Human Rights) by Richard Alan White, September, 2004.",1416787200,,153,5.16
8145657,3,B000IJ7A1A,"Arrived on time, but being a Anthony Hopkins fan the movie is very good. The story has a very good point, worth watching",1406246400,,120,4.260869565217392
8145658,1,B000IJ7A1A,"It is almost unbelievable: the leading character lives under a dictatorship,and is warned by everyone that while he travels in the States me must NOT write anything against the regime:the can put his family and himself at great risk...
First pearl: Hopkins makes very serious accusations againt the government, and inmediately his son is murdered....But he really does not seem to realize what has happened....
Second pearl: he looks for help all over, but of course he never thinks it might be useful to get in contact with US authorities...
Other... well that is enough. Intelligent audiences please abstain",1399420800,,609,5.161616161616162
8145659,2,B000IJ7A1A,This movie was extremely disappointing.  I expected much better from Anthony Hopkins.  We discontinued watching after approximately a half-hour of total boredom.  A tedious movie and certainly not one I would recommend to others.,1328400000,2,229,5.676470588235294
8145660,5,B000IJ7A1A,"I was very impressed with this movie the first time I saw it and couldn't understand why I had never heard anything about it. I think the acting is very good, the subject very important and I'm glad I now have it on DVD. The service was very good and I look forward to being able to watch it whenever I want to. I think it's a winner.",1223164800,25,334,3.926470588235294
