7839650,5,6303142184,great movie not for children,1415059200,,28,4.8
7839651,5,6303142184,Totally Awesome Movie! The story line was great and well acted. I have wanted to see her body for many years!,1401408000,,109,4.238095238095238
7839652,3,6303142184,This movie crawls along and turns out to be a love story rather than a thriller which the cover suggests. There is no real action except in the very beginning when a store clerk is murdered.  It`s down hill the rest of the way.,1371686400,,227,4.159090909090909
7839653,4,6303142184,This an older movie but one that is interesting from the beginning.  Jack Scalia is sort of a Dirty Harry type cop and he gets the job done.  Stepfanie Kramer certainly isn't hard on the eyes.  But I don't care for her boots.,1328659200,,225,4.186046511627907
7839654,5,6303142184,"The movie is great and Jack makes this show interesting to watch fantastic acting with the cast. I have seen other thrillers but this one takes the cake. Different a must to see expect plenty of suspicion and suspence connected to the story lines. Not what you expect but very interesting to watch. I don't want to spoil it and disclose to much, I class it as a marvel and 10 out of 10.  Robyn",1313798400,,393,4.24
