2262420,5,B00094AS9A,"Frankie, a young deaf boy keeps traveling around the country with his Mom and Grandma. They seem to be on the run. He doesn't know his dad, but writes to him and has a relationship with him through letters. What he doesn't know is that it's his Mom who has been writing to him, because she doesn't want him to know the truth about his dad. But the ship that the dad is supposed to be on turns up in their city...and now she has to produce a dad. In comes Gerard Butler, who agrees to pose as the dad for a day. Wonderful movie, which shows the importance of a Mothers love and protection for her child...but also the importance of a dad in a boy's life. Told with dignity, humor, and absolutely wonderful acting. Yes, you will cry...but it will take you up also...buy it!",1112745600,,771,4.2517006802721085
2262421,5,B00094AS9A,"Dear Frankie is one of the sweetest films I've seen in many years.  The story is not all that original, but the way it was handled avoided the usual cliches.  All of the actors' performances were excellent, especially that of Gerard Butler as ""the Stranger.""  He conveyed more with his expressions that any words could do.  See this movie, it will make you feel good.",1112745600,10,367,4.6

2262454,4,B00094AS9A,"I loved this movie although I used subtitles to help with some parts that the heavy accents made it hard for me to hear certain words.
Everyone including Gerard Butler as the ""stranger"" was great and the story, although simple was well done. My friend who is from Scotland also loved seeing some home spots and although weather is always a little dreary, it's home. : )",1514332800,,369,4.522388059701493

2262476,4,B00094AS9A,"I truly liked this story, in part because it looks at the reality of a hearing-impaired boy's particular situation. There is no sugar-coating, and the film allows for the leads to get to know each. As I saw these changes I warmed to the characters. There were some surprises along the way that added to my enjoyment of the film. I give it a strong recommendation",1494115200,,362,4.5
2262477,5,B00094AS9A,"Both Emily Mortimer and Gerard Butler embraced their roles as the single mother and the ""Stranger."" I would love to see more movies with Emily and Gerard together because the chemistry between them is explosive. Be sure to get a copy of the dvd with sub-titles and Special Features. The Special Features include ""Deleted Scenes"", ""The Story of Dear Frankie"". and an ""Interview with the Director."" The deleted scenes include an extended dance scene that is amazing.  I am buying this movie for the fifth time since I have gifted my last four copies to friends. This is a movie that I watch every couple of months just to remind me the importance of a ""real"" father.",1489968000,,664,4.6752136752136755

SPOILER: the ending is left kind of open. The Stranger leaves but I'm pretty sure he'll be back because he got along well with Frankie as well as his mom, and it turns out that he's Marie's brother.

2262523,5,B00094AS9A,"I'm glad I stumbled upon this gem of a movie.  Although the Scottish accent was hard to get used to, I turned on the English subtitles to get used to the accent; by the end of the movie I turned them off.  The ocean scenes around Glasgow are stunning, but more stunning was the plot and acting.  Everyone's character carried the story, from the grandma Nell's constant smoking (or eating), to mother Lizzie's determination to protect her son both physically and emotionally from any more pain, and Frankie's own persistence to someday have a dad again.  Lizzie keeps Frankie in a make-believe world of hope and love, until one day she realizes that her fantasy story turns out to have some reality in it.  In comes a new man to play Frankie's dad, a man who grows attached to the boy after a long day visit.

The pace at times is slow, because it's not quite clear why Lizzie left her husband and why she is refusing to ever see him again.  That comes out halfway through this story, when Lizzie reveals the truth to this man (who doesn't have a name).  Her husband had been controlling and physically abusive and is so through his dying days.  But this nameless new man shows her that there are tender and loving men out there.  She simply needs to believe that, too.

The music, the landscape, the fine acting, the believeability of this story make this a heartwarming and original plot.  The beauty of Scotland add fascination to this film, as there are many coastline and foggy scenes that add some mystery.

This is a film that should not be missed.  I'm glad I caught it!",1483228800,8,1577,4.507042253521127
2262524,2,B00094AS9A,"Although this was, at times, well acted, there were a few scenes where the acting was horrible (hospital).  The storyline was very boring.  This film could provoke a good nap, but I will stick to the cooking channel for that.",1483056000,,225,4.6

2262554,4,B00094AS9A,"I don't think the movie synopsis does the movie much justice, nor the trailer but nevertheless it's a good watch. The plot involves way more than just your average hallmark, feel-good single parent makeover. Gerard Butler's role is relatively small but it's nice to seem him try on something different from the loud, boisterous, charming Irishman we usually recognize him as.  Still charming though, but more endearing.

Without spoiling anything, I will say that the film is definitely underrated and is wonderfully touching to watch.",1482364800,,535,5.2823529411764705

Lizzie told Frankie that his father is a sail man in the  ship Accra, without knowing that a ship named Accra actually exists.  Lizzie's mother asks Lizzie to tell Frankie the truth, but she insists that she writes Frankie letters to hear his voice.

Frankie's classmates bully him because he is deaf.  When Frankie discovers that the Accra ship is actually docking in the port  he assumes that his father is coming to see him, and one of his classmates bets Frankie that his father doesn't care about him.  Then  Lizzie hires an stranger ""with no past"" to pretend to be Frankie's dad for one day.

The characters are likeable and as the story unfolds, you begin to see the reason for the choices the mother has made to protect her young son. I thought it was a sweet story and one that is appropriate for family viewing, keeping in mind the accents.

Very touching story but I had only wished there was a sequel. If going by my imagination alone, Louis would return from wherever he took off to and marry Lizzie.
Jack McElhone, who portrayed Frankie, was awesome! The entire cast was fantastic!

That scene where The stranger (Louis) takes Lizzie and Frankie to the beach, Frankie goes off (intentionally) and both Lizzie and Louis are looking out in to the ocean (I think it was the ocean) and then he glances at her, and she, miss shy butterfly, glances back, and it was all I could do but melt into the sand! The looks between them was so powerful -- no dialogue just looks! So magnetic! My only gripe is the ending. Damn writers!

You know the one, boy meets girl, boy and girl can't stand each other, girl has another boyfriend, other boyfriend is shallow and the boy and girl finally realize they should be together after all. it's also got plenty of humor and the character that Gerard plays and the character of Frankie play off each other beautifully.

The bad words were not, in the slightest, gratuitous, but pivotal to cementing Lizzy's decision to NOT let the abusive father see the son she has been raising.  Given the rubbish that is on TV and passes for movies these days, the ""bad words"" were, indeed, necessary.  It was a stark and strident contrast to an otherwise peaceful movie.

2263617,3,B00094AS9A,"It is slowly paced, but the acting is fantastic and will draw you in - so much so, in the way that you care for the characters, well at least Frankie - & the stranger/father. The mother's creative way of dealing with the not-so-great real life father and the great lengths she went to protect her son and the reason, the necessity of bolstering her son's confidence weren't clearly stated, & apparently although the points were made it may have been too subtle for many to see. Overall it was poignant, although I must agree with another reviewer (but not with their rating) ""a great idea but the end....did they forget a chapter?"" Although that 1-star reviewer failed to catch the (again subtle) ending which leaves all the positive fairy tale potential endings free to pursue, because so many did not understand that it really could have used a little more clarity, and a BIG part of this is because IT SEEMS SOMETHING HUGE in the PLOT development IS missing! Somehow the boy infers/knows/uncovers the hidden ""truth"", and he's just so wise and sage, that he handles it stoically, without complaint or confrontation? He is a very accepting, adaptable character but really, I think he'd not be such a great actor in real life to be able to hide such a discovery & not disclose, let alone confront mom?  So... so many here were confused or lost along the way, and I'm grateful for the subtleties I hope that I've pointed out here, that are to me clearly displayed by the brilliant acting and the dialogue;  yes, the accent's are a challenge to many but other than a few words I couldn't quite catch it really is understandable, and the intent is clear and portrays feeling in the physical content. Overall it is a thoughtful provocative poignant piece but I really don't understand why such a big revelation is glossed over in the end, which makes it rather unbelievable; kind of like a plot twist in a whodunnit that suddenly reveals some great clue that was missing. THAT to me is what made the ending less enjoyable, for I too felt 'I must have missed something' and I think indeed we did, & it would have been 5 stars had they explained the ending, which would have made it more believable and made the potential futures and all the positivity more clear to so many who missed it.",1457136000,3,2283,4.5931372549019605

2263645,5,B00094AS9A,"I really liked this movie---what I could understand. I had a hard time, especially at first, understanding what was being said. Though everyone was speaking English, their Scottish accent made it hard to follow at times. Even so I kept watching it and got the sense of where it was going even when I didn't understand some things when it was said.

This was a very touching story about a little boy who was deaf. Even though he was deaf, he was very smart--at the end of the movie you will see just how smart he really was. I felt more sorry for the mother than I did for the son because she suffered a lot more than the little boy did--she was always looking over her shoulder and trying to protect her son. The man who played the little boy's ""substitute Daddy"" played a good part. At first he seemed awkward as if he didn't know how to act as a father--but as time went on, he felt more and more for the little boy and you could tell it by the way he treated him. It bothered him just as much to say good-bye to the little boy as it was hard for the child to say good-bye to him.

I had no idea how this movie could possibly end on a good note and was greatly surprised by the end--it ended a lot better than I thought it would! If you are use to watching Scottish movies you probably won't have as hard a time following along with this story as I did, but like I said, I still enjoyed it because it was a good movie.",1456704000,,1420,4.067857142857143

Emily Mortimer plays mother to Jack McElhone, whom we presume to have been born  deaf but our suspicions arise when it is clear the two have spent time on the run. The events of their lives, while though small, create a realistic portrait of their family life that is not over-sentimentalized. The boy dreams of his father's return and follows his supposed journeys across the seas on a merchant ship  via a series of letters which play an important role in the story. The arrival of Gerard Butler's character as the stand-in father creates a realistic love interest, one in which a boy learns to accept a reality that might lead to a true father's presence in his life..",1454544000,,811,4.5793103448275865

Other reviewers have given the more detailed notes, so I will skip that. If you are looking for a light drama (-more upbeat than not), give this movie a try. Someone could criticize it by saying the mother lies to her son and carries out a big charade, so she is setting a bad example, etc.  But I think most would easily overlook this angle and buy into the intent of the movie - the mom doing what she can to rear her son with a positive self image, etc.",1448409600,,588,4.060344827586207

It's an old story, mother and son escape abusive husband/father, but in this story the mother has spent the child's life lying about the father and making  him out to be hard working and caring.  She even goes so far as to write letters to her son and have them posted to the boy so that it appears he is on a merchant freighter working and unable to come home (for several years).  Eventually the day comes when she has to tell the truth, or maybe not.  The end is heartwarming and surprising so is saved from being too sweet.

2264672,5,B00094AS9A,"Wow!  What a good story; different from ones I have seen lately.  Actors were great, but the story was amazing.  A deaf child choosing to be mute writes to his father who is at sea, and in return the father writes back.  The two shares a bond that is only shared through the letters.  The mother is well aware of this letter-writing relationship even though she is no longer with her husband, or ex-husband in this case.  The grandmother lives with the mother and they share a secret that the kid does not know.  The grandmother wants the truth to be told, but the mother does everything to keep the secret.  Her son is teased/bullied at school by another kid who makes a bet with the deaf kid that he will never see his father.  The mother, played by Emily Mortimer, now must face the challenge, does she let her son meet his father, or does she run away with her family as she has always done in the past.  You will be surprised by the decisions each character makes and the outcome of what you learn as a viewer.",1445472000,,1015,4.294736842105263

2264789,4,B00094AS9A,"Clean, sweet drama. About a mother and a deaf son, obviously running away, always moving around. The son is very bright but something of a loner and He hero worships his absent  father. He has been told his father is a petty officer on board a ship and they have, supposedly, been writing letters to one another, hence the title. But the mother is the author of the ""father's"" letters. She secretly pens them and has not told her son what has happened to his father. When the ""fictitious"" ship turns into a real one coming into their port, she hires a stranger to portray Frankie' s father so that he is not let down.

I am a Christian and I look for clean, family friendly films. I was a bit surprised, therefore, to find this film. I may be wrong, but I didn't think I remembered Mr. Butler, the actor playing the hired ""dad"", to usually play in clean films. He does a wonderful job, as does the actress playing his mom and many of the supporting cast are well acted. There are a few heavy themes, especially at the end, where we learn more of what happened to the real father, and there is a non-married couple who are obviously together (""partners""), and I believe I heard Christ's name taken in vain once. The heavy English/Scottish accents made it hard for this American to hear everything on-screen clearly so I am not sure if there was any other objectionable language. I think there was one other but it seemed mild. Sexual content: none. (Parents who wouldn't want their children seeing the ""partner"" couple kissing should watch first, these 2 scenes are mild and do not affect the primary plotline).

All in all a decent, clean film. It's not the best film I have seen and the message of the mother lying to her child is not challenged morally. While the film's message gives her Grace, I.e. she just wants him to feel loved, I feel it was not addressed well. That is the only objection I have and she does admit to other characters in the film she is not clear she is handling it well. The child's deafness is a simple part of the plot, not overdone.",1444521600,,2062,4.421052631578948

I won't go into detail about the plot and story line because I hate spoilers, but it was just a beautiful story about a mother's love for her son and the lengths she will go to in order to shelter him from pain and disappointment. Gerard Butler and Emily Mortimer are so perfect for their roles, and Jack McElhone as the son, is adorable and sweet.

To be perfectly honest, some of the tear jerkers we watch together I end up falling asleep somewhere in the middle (beginning more like it ).The scenery, story and acting are all very good. Accents at times are a little hard to understand. I had to replay a scene at the end to make sure we heard correctly what was said. A heartwarming story I wasn't sorry I watched. However, I kept thinking through out the movie a little tweak here or a little more depth there and this could have been a great movie. The storyline: mother moves constantly to hide from abusive exhusband\father, mother writes letters to deaf son in the name of his father, son believes dad is on a ship, ship coming in, mom hires stranger to be dad for a day, also a new school for the boy, I'll let you see the rest for yourself.",1444176000,,878,4.220238095238095

No highs, no lows, no laughter, no tears, I just kinda waited the whole time for a ""moment"" to happen, but it never did. That's just my opinion however. If you collect Gerard butler movies, then you could give it a go at a nice LOW price...but ya really don't get to see him all that much, and though his character has huge potential... the script simply doesn't give him the material to bring it home, ya know?",1442793600,,586,4.149122807017544

When it seems life can only get darker, a great blessing comes into their lives, despite Grandma's inability to hold onto hope for the future.

I've watched it several times and see more each time.  I'm considering ordering DVDs for my grown children and grandchildren for Christmas.  There are so many emotions without loud gunfire or ridiculous superheros and violence.  There is so much kindness and love from all the characters minus one.

I won't spoil any of the plot for you. I can't imagine anyone regretting the time one spends to watch it. I was sad to see it come to an end.",1440892800,,310,4.098360655737705
2265216,5,B00094AS9A,"Some good movies occasionally get by me and ""Dear Frankie"" (2004) is one of those films. This is one of those quiet films that gently eases itself into one's soul and remains there for a while. Emily Mortimer, Gerard Butler, and a young actor named Shona Auerbach deliver compelling performances that elevates this above a typical tearjerker.

Emily Mortimer plays Lizzie Morrison, a single mother who at the beginning of the film is moving her family, which includes her mother and Lizzie's hearing-impaired 9-year-old son, Frankie (Shona Auerbach). Apparently, the family is always moving and the reasons are revealed earlier on in the film, though not with any specifics provided. Frankie settles into a routine at school - he is the target of nasty comments by some of his peers, but manages to make a good friend. Frankie loves geography and looks forward to receiving letters from his Da, a man Frankie has never met but who sends Frankie letters, describing travels on a ship named Accra.

Early on in the film it is revealed that these letters are actually penned by Lizzie, who does not want Frankie to know the real truth about his Da. When the Accra is revealed to be docking at their seaside town, the school bully insists that Frankie show his Da off to the kids at school and Emily scrambles to find a total stranger who will step into the role. The man who picks up this assignment is none other than Gerard Butler, who plays a stranger who agrees to be Frankie's Da for a day or two.

The film moves languidly against the backdrop of a bucolic coastal town. Yet there is also the undertone of menace simmering just below the surface - this is well-portrayed by the facial expressions and furtive body language of Emily Mortimer's Lizzie. Why is she hell bent on keeping up with the deception, and why is she so afraid of her past catching up with her? These questions are answered late into the film, but definitely worth the wait. There is a sense of the bittersweet here with an ending that left me feeling contemplative about the vagaries of human existence.",1440806400,5,2077,4.684931506849315

2265239,3,B00094AS9A,"This wasn't a bad film, but I am still slack-jawed at the description of this movie stating it as ""Heartwarming"" (slightly?) and ""HILARIOUS"" - there was not ONE single instance of hilarity throughout the entire movie.  It is more of a despondent film.  You wonder about the characters, but don't really come to care or identify with any of them. (Once, for a moment, a child makes a face at his mom - was that the aforementioned hilarity?)
The movie is sweet, but very bleak and understated.  Think 'British Movie' multiplied 5-fold for (Scottish) austerity of acting and add to it a depressing background, and storyline.  I am actually curious to watch another Scottish movie now and see if this really IS hilarious and entertaining by their standards.  And if so...how morbidly depressing.

2265445,4,B00094AS9A,"I liked a lot of things about this film.  First, the setting--it was refreshing to see a seaside area of Scotland, new to my American eyes.  I like the local dialect, (""wee"") and the homeyness of the locals, especially Marie in the fish-and-chips shop.

The story is interesting, Lizzie, a young mother who's running away from an abusive husband has devised a way to provide some sort of a positive ""father"" for her son.  She writes, as the ""dad"" who is presumably on a merchant ship, sailing around the world.  The boy writes back via a system Lizzie has worked out with a post office box..  This fictional relationship works well until a real ship, which oddly bears the name of the ship Lizzie has made up is due to come to their port. Of course, the boy is dying to see Dad whom he has not seen since he was a baby..  Yikes...what is she going to do?

The answer comes with the help of Marie who finds a man who will, for a price, act as the Dad for a day.  Enter Gerard Butler, who perks things up considerably..  Up until this point the mood  was mostly drab and sad. .Frankie is deaf although he manages very well to make friends in the new community.  Scotland does seem like a nice place as portrayed here.  Butler, who is nameless in the story, proves to be more than was bargained for. He is not only  big and strong, a dad any kid would be happy to show off to his friends but he has a heart. takes a real interest in the boy, as well as in the mom.  I won't tell the rest.

My only complaint is that the ending doesn't really work well. Still it's a sweet story, worth watching.  Maybe you can make up your own, better ending.",1440288000,,1639,4.201923076923077

life, the reason Frankie's mother has had to constantly move from place to place, and the cause of Frankie's hearing problem.  A ray of
happiness is a man, who he really is was at first unknown, who comes in to Frankie's life for a couple of days...........you will want the man

2265736,4,B00094AS9A,"I really enjoyed this movie. It takes place in Scotland and either my American ears grew accustom to the accents, or they changed their speech pattern slightly after the first scene.

It is the story of a single mom who goes to great length to make her son feel loved. I don't always agree with her choices, but everything worked out in the end.  The mother/child relationship is the focus of the story.  I like to think the changes that happened continued and everyone, not just the little boy, ended up happy and in love, but we don't get to see that far ahead.

There are no action scenes, shoot-em-ups or car chases for which I am eternally grateful. This is a story about people.",1439683200,,684,4.448

The accents and background noises, the rapidity of speech, often made passages unintelligible.  I really wish there was a way to get subtitles on movies like this, but can't see a way Amazon could provide those.  The acting and the story were great, and the ending excellent, especially the knowledge this little kid held back from the grownups. The temporary dad was better than most kids expect to have in a real one, caring and insightful, and paying attention to what the child actually said, did, and liked.",1439596800,,671,4.661016949152542

The young actor who plays Frankie was outstanding, so believable in his role. Emily Mortimer really shines as a soft-spoken but steely-willed woman who goes to great lengths to protect her son and to create a content life for him. This could have turned sappy at a number of moments, but the sparse dialogue and silent pauses between the characters transport you into Frankie's world and keep the story from falling into something predictable.",1439596800,,567,4.785714285714286

This is not one of those feel good movies that neatly wraps things up with a happy ever after ending, but you're left feeling good about people and the impact of simple acts of kindness. Without giving the story away, the movie focuses on a transition point in the lives of a mother and son, and the support they get from the people around them.",1439596800,,365,4.382352941176471

The story is a bit awkward at times, her deaf son going through life somewhat easily, all made possible by the sacrifices of his mom, who lives with her mother, and they're all rather broke.  The mood is bleak, but not depressing, and the story is touching but not what I would describe as ""loved by audiences everywhere"" or whatever the quick blurb is on the captioned summary.  Yes, it's a ""darling"" movie, and a good one for families; but it's more of a 3.5 rating rather than a 4.5...see what you think.",1439424000,,706,4.415384615384616

This is more an exercise in how to perpetuate abuse, with the kind stranger masquerading as the child's real father instead of just being a good man, a right role model, in contrast to the abusive one. The final letter with which the movie ends, written by the child, acknowledging that he knew it was all a ruse, made him the wise one, but this facile explanation at the end of the movie was too easy an add on and just isn't enough to give the film the depth it's missing.",1438214400,2,663,4.2204724409448815

2266502,4,B00094AS9A,"Frankie is 28 year old Lizzie's almost 10 year old deaf but very well-adjusted and smart son.  At the film's opening, Lizzie and Frankie are packing for a move.  Viewers learn very quickly that Lizzie and Frankie have been moving a lot, for a reason that Lizzie has been trying to keep Frankie from knowing for as long as she can.

Lizzie encourages Frankie to write letters to his absentee father, who's supposedly a sailor traveling around the world.  Frankie doesn't know that Lizzie intercepts those letters so she can write back to him posing as his father.

The fiction that Lizzie's been trying to keep alive runs into a problem when Frankie learns that a Navy ship is stopping over at his town and Frankie can't stop wishing his father would be in it so father and son can finally meet.  Not wanting to let Frankie feel unloved by his father, Lizzie decides to hire someone to pose as Frankie's father for a day, over the objection of Frankie's grandmother, who's been urging Lizzie to come ""clean.""

How well would Lizzie's latest plan work? What is she really trying to hide from Frankie and does it really justify the ""lies"" she has had to tell Frankie?  Would she ever come ""clean"" to Frankie?

The only thing I would venture to say is that this film / story does have a good ending. The acting is very good and Lizzie's and Frankie's responses to their plights will make many viewers tear up a little bit, but in a good way.",1437523200,,1437,4.496153846153846

2266551,4,B00094AS9A,"It's not a spoiler to say that this film has one of the very best endings of any I've ever seen, including ""Casablanca"".  A happy ending?  Dearie, stop asking questions and just watch the damn thing.

The plot does not seem promising.  A young single mother of a 9 year old deaf boy, who can but generally doesn't speak, has lived a life  of a transient, always staying one step ahead of her husband (and the boy's father), taking her son and mother with her.  Her son writes to his dad---who, his mother has told him, is a merchant seaman.  It's a lie, of course, and wouldn't you know it, the ship she's told him he's crewing aboard, comes to their little Scottish port.  So she goes out and finds a man to pretend to be his dad...

You can imagine how this works out, in the best of ways.  In the worst of ways.  And then there's Real Dad...  Yep.

Life is full of surprises, and every now and then Hollywood and its extended family produces a good one like this.

Now how much do you want to bet someone is going to turn this into an idiotic stage musical, like ""Billy Elliot"", which was also such a good film (but I think this one is even better!).",1437436800,,1153,4.205479452054795

I like Gerard Butler and was surprised to see him in such a low-key, but really good movie.  A single mother (Emily Mortimer) has kept the secret of her son's father from him for years, having made up an elaborate ruse that he was a sailor on a merchant ship and sailing the world, communicating to his son through letters and stamps from his ports-of-call.  When the family moves to Glasgow, a notice in the paper says that the ship he is supposedly on is docking soon.  The boy is hopeful that he will met his father at long last.  What happens is the continuation of the ruse to keep the boy from being hurt.  She hires a stranger (Gerard Butler) to pretend he is the father for one day.  In the course of this story, we find out about the boy's real father and what has shaped the Mother, her relationship to her own mother, her beloved son and men, in general.  I really recommend this to anyone looking for a good story that is not typical ""Hollywood"" with strong acting--the Scottish accents are not overwhelming, either--no subtitles needed!",1437004800,,1179,4.47196261682243

It's not about a whirlwind of emotion and suddenly a steamy night with sheet scorching sex. Finally a mother who is smart and looking out for herself and her child. To make it better the stranger is kind and respectful. Makes you want to see good things happen for them instead of feeling like he was a scum that just wanted sex.,1424822400,,460,4.2988505747126435

2266703,5,B00094AS9A,"My husband and I enjoyed this movie.  Very touching story about a mother who goes to great lengths to protect her son.  In a world where divorce runs rampant and parents work diligently to turn children against one parent, this selfless mother put her son before her own hurt and went the extra mile to let her son believe that he had a father who cared about him, when in fact, he did not. It would have been far more damaging to the child to have known what kind of man his father was and to realize his father did not care for him.  Yes, the mother was deceptive to her son but he wanted so much to believe his father cared.  Imagine how a child must feel to think/know a parent cares nothing about him.

I'd never heard of it before because apparently, it wasn't marketed very much in the US. At first, I thought, ""Oh, dear! I hope it isn't too bleak."" It wasn't at all but neither did it turn out to be overly saccharine.

I liked that it didn't end up wrapped in a pretty little bow but that it left open possibilities.

Gerard Butler, Emily Mortimer, and young Jack McElhone were superb. They all had an incredible ability to convey so much emotion with just a look, as did the rest of the cast.

It seems to be a chick flick (so it's obvious why my wife loves it). Even though it's a very affecting story of a single mother and her son, it never strays into the treacly schlock so common in this sort of movie (which is why I probably love it). These are ordinary people struggling with difficult circumstances, but it's all very common. There is understated romance, honest and raw emotions, personal hurts, and absolutely NONE of the exaggerated crap so common in this sort of story. The son is not a snot or super talent, just a kid. The adults are responsible and hardworking, not gibbering idiots.

This a beautiful story, perfectly acted, shot, and directed. An absolute gem.",1397952000,5,898,4.469512195121951

THE KID IS SO WONDERFUL, MATURE AND SENSITIVE THAT HE IS LOVELY TO WATCH.  HAVING HAD MY DAD DIE WHEN I WAS AN EARLY AGE, THIS STORY CAPTURES THE SENSE OF WHAT IT'S LIKE IN A WARM AND LOVING WAY.  I'VE WATCHED IT 3 TIMES AND SENT COPIES TO RELATIVES AS GIFTS.  THE MALE PROTAGONIST IS A GREAT ACTOR AND THE FEMALE LEAD IS WONDERFUL AND TENDER AND VULNERABLE.

2266791,5,B00094AS9A,"A friend recommended this movie to me. It is a beautiful story about a little boy who has been abandoned by his father, and what his mother does to make him believe that his father is still involved in his life. The only problem I had was the constant buffering, then completely stopping and trying to get it to start up again. Because I rented it, I knew I only had a certain amount of time to get through it, so I had to fast forward it to the end. Then I backed it up, and went through the frustrating start and stop craziness until I finally got to the end of the movie. I promisd myself I was never going to rent a movie on my iPad again, because this is not the first time this has happened. The Amazon team (or whatever team) noticed that I had so much trouble, so they emailed me that they were going to refund my $2.99. They have done this in the past for me, without me even contacting them. This movie is definitely worth seeing (especially if you like Gerard Butler).

When the son hears of his ""Fathers"" ship coming to port where they live the Mother hires a stand in Dad (Gerard Butler) who does a remarkable job as a loving Father with restraint and compassion.

I won't ruin the plot as that is one of my cardinal rules as to never reveal the specifics of a film, but I will say that this may be one of Butler's best films other than Coriolanus.

I have all Gerry Butler's movies and find him to be an under-rated actor.  As an action hero, he is believable in all his roles but as a serious actor, he excells.  He can bring emotion to his characters like no other actor nowadays.  In this role as the stranger, he has us becoming part of this family as we watch him reach out to this boy whom he learns to love in a short time. You can see the love and hurt on his face as he sees the need in the child along with the lonliness of not having a father. At the same time, the boy and his mother meet an emotional need of the stranger. I just cannot give my opinion of the movie without giving Butler his due in this movie.

As far communication, Frankie and his mother don't seem to use much sign language and he seemed to rely on reading lips which is possible but I found it a bit unbelievable that at that young an age he would be such an outstanding lip reader.

Although I don't condone the lengths she went to and the lies that were perpetuated, I certainly understand the reasons behind why she did it....reasons that were totally borne from her love for her boy. The acting and direction are superb, the story sublime. This type of movie, one that tells a story so touching and deep that we can all identify with it, is cinema at its best.

Obviously this isn't a great idea but for reasons you will have to watch the movie to see, she is short on time and under pressure. A new friend comes through with a connection that will work. Bonds form, decisions need to be made and the past demands recognition and rights. What will happen? Watch and find out. This movie is not your typical feel good movie but it will touch you in a such away that the ""feel good"" sticks a little more.

The actors and actresses do have Scottish accents in the film (as it takes place in Scotland) so it may be hard to understand at first if your ear isn't trained... but listen closely. It's worth it.",1347062400,,1029,4.304123711340206

I especially loved Gerard Butler's part in the movie, but had to wait quite a while to get to see him. :) I loved him as the Phantom and actually didn't recognize him at first in Dear Frankie. I knew nothing about the movie when I set down to watch it the first time and didn't know he was in it. Now, I rediscovered the film years later in my mother-in-law's cabinet and was thrilled to get to watch it again, this time with my husband. Both of us, yes, were in tears at one point which we kind of laughed at ourselves because we're not quick to cry at movies. Anyway, it is a must see and doesn't disappoint. My only (sort of) complaint is that I would have liked to see more closure at the end because it seemed the ending came out of nowhere and we were sad to see the credits come.

2267032,4,B00094AS9A,"""Akamai"" is a Hawaiian word meaning smart and intelligent... a good head on the shoulders.  That describes Frankie in this endearing film, Dear Frankie.

Lizzie (Emily Mortimer) has escaped an abusive husband, and her life now revolves around keeping her nine-year-old deaf son, Frankie (Jack McElhone), under the radar.  They move frequently throughout Scotland, and thus Frankie doesn't get the opportunity to develop friendships as children do.

However, Lizzie has never shared the true reason for her frequent moves.  Instead, she tells Frankie that his father is a sailor, always away on an oceanic voyage.  Frankie writes to him regularly, and Lizzie secretly writes back, describing the wonders of the voyage.  It is a cruel irony when, in truth, a ship of the same name docks in town.  Frankie is thrilled at this opportunity to meet his father.

Resourceful Lizzie actually hires another sailor ((Gerard Butler)) to ""be"" Frankie's dad for a few days, knowing that he will then disappear on another voyage.

But, as you might expect, things get complicated, then even more complicated. How can Lizzie protect Frankie from the pain of discovery?

Great acting by all.  A gentle, caring film to be shared with others.  And don't worry... you'll get used to the accents.",1298160000,5,1276,5.106280193236715

Mom and son now learned their REAL dad died from illness, son forgave mom for not telling him in a long running. WHAT a sweet movie!",1295913600,2,505,3.8095238095238093
2267034,4,B00094AS9A,"For a film that appears on the outset to be ridiculously predictable, I was genuinely surprised with how few clich&eacute;s really abounded here.  Yes, there are some (you can never escape them all) but they and few and, thankfully, far in between.

Get your hankies out; you'll need them.

The film tells the story of a young mother named Lizzie who is constantly uprooting her young son Frankie and her mother in order to stay away from her ex-husband.  Her ex was an abusive man who did some serious damage when Frankie was young.  Because of that `damage', Frankie is now deaf.  Frankie is a very smart and inquisitive boy who remembers nothing of his father.  In order to protect her son from a past she wishes he had never had, Lizzie lies to him and tells him that his father loves him very much, but that he is a seaman who is away at sea and thus unable to really be a part of Frankie's life.  So, Frankie writes to him, and Lizzie collects the letters and then writes back, filling her son's head with the image of a loving, caring, devoted father.  Her lie starts to unravel when word gets to Frankie that the ship his father is supposed to be on is actually going to be docking in town.  Lizzie doesn't want to tell him the truth, but she seemingly has no other options.  Then she is introduced to a handsome stranger who agrees to pretend to be Frankie's father for a small sum of money.

What happens next is just plain beautiful.

If you are expecting the usual (man falls in love with mother and son and then son finds out he is not his father and gets mad and then they make up and live happily ever after) then you are going to be in for a treat, because `Dear Frankie' goes a route that is far more believable, far more touching and far more memorable.

With moving performances by the entire cast, including a heartfelt Gerard Butler (he's more than good looks) and a beautifully fleshed out Emily Mortimer (stunning performance); `Dear Frankie' is a refreshing piece of filmmaking that the whole family will enjoy.  Be forewarned, I'm serious about the hankies; this movie is primed and ready to evoke serious waterworks.  My wife and I were bawling, but sometimes you need a good cry, and the sadness that is found in this film is beautifully replaced by a sincere happiness.

UGH, and that final letter!",1295308800,6,2326,4.4739336492890995
2267043,5,B00094AS9A,"This is our go-to movie to share with friends who aren't into indie movies.  It's a wonderful story with amazing acting.  The plot moves slower than most blockbuster movies, but it's refreshing in it's simplicity.",1292371200,3,213,5.057142857142857
2267044,5,B00094AS9A,"The acting pleased me, and the shape of the story, and the look and feel of the film. Good work!

The first time I saw the film, I needed more help to notice the right things and ask the right questions.  For instance, I wanted more time to watch Frankie as he met with clues to his Mother's Lie.

[spoilers] Later it struck me that there is an interesting parallel between Lizzie's Stranger and another Stranger who also (1) came as if from nowhere, (2) won the heart of a needy girl,  (3) showed what a ""real"" Father is like, and then (4) left -- but he is coming back.  What he did was a gift. We don't know when he will return, so we wait.  He is even a hero on a white horse.  There may be a hundred literary parallels, but you will have guessed that I'm talking about Jesus (see the writings of John and Paul in the Bible).

Of course I don't mean that the parallel is perfect.  Lizzie's Stranger has his own needs; he is a pale reflection in a troubled pool.  And I don't mean to say that the writer and the director/cinematographer had the other Stranger in mind.  He was off camera; suddenly we realize he is there.

Only the surface of this movie is what some people call ""realistic.""  (That's rather like our lives, isn't it?)

The problem posed at the outset is Lizzie's Big Lie, and the movie never deals with it to the satisfaction of some people.  Maybe they are right.  But I see the silent mercy of God releasing Lizzie from the spider's web she has woven, the sticky web that protects and ensnares.  God, unrecognized, still cares for Lizzie and Frankie.

His mercy is also for a Stranger closed in on himself.  It is even for the man who was Frankie's physical father, when the last of his capacity for self-giving love has died.

A few things are done poorly, or are in poor taste.  And, sad to say, ""Dear  Frankie"" shows signs of spiritual emptiness.  Well, so do I.  Let's notice the symptoms, but let's enjoy the film for the good that is in it.

Even at the end, Lizzie has something still to learn:  no one has to deserve to be forgiven.

The Scottish accent was not too hard to handle, and there are subtitles.  Anyway, for some of us the accent is like music.  So is a good story well told.",1291939200,,2217,4.262019230769231

2267063,5,B00094AS9A,"Lizzie Morrison (Emily Mortimer) is a woman who's been writing letters to her 9-year-old deaf son (Jack McElhone) for years as if she were his missing father (Cal Macaninch). The father has been out of the picture so long that the boy has no idea what his father looks like. Living with Mom and the boy is Grandma (Mary Riggans), who has a habit of looking in the paper on a daily basis to see if a very specific ad is there as usual: a missing person's ad looking for Mom. On one occasion after seeing this ad the grandmother makes a call telling the person on the other end of the line to just leave them alone. It is at this point that we suspect that the father was a wife-beater and that the two women had to pack up the kid to escape from the abuse.

Unfortunately for Mom, she randomly picked, from a postage stamp, the name of the ship Dad was supposed to have been on all these years. And that ship is coming into port. Now, after learning about the ship from a classmate, the kid expects a surprise visit from his father.

What's the mother to do? The grandmother implores her to just tell the kid the truth. But Mom decides to find a man that she can pay to pretend to be the boy's father for just one day. That man is Gerard Butler.

Now the dad's ship will soon be docking and Frankie expects a visit from his dad.

The kid who plays Frankie in this movie gives an extraordinary performance. He successfully conveys Frankie's tough-minded sweetness and intelligence without saying a word. The other performances are also good. We meet a mother trying to bring up her kid alone and a collection of other working-class characters who teach us what it means to be community.

Dear Frankie is the kind of film where less is definitely more.  It's the story of a single Scottish mom Lizzie (Emily Mortimer) and her deaf son Frankie(ably played by Jack McElhone.) Lizzie, her Mum, Nell (Mary Riggans), and Frankie
frequently move to keep one step ahead of Lizzie's abusive ex-husband and his family. Now, newly relocated in the Scottish seaside town of Greenock, she accepts a job at the local fish and chips shop owned by Marie (Sharon Small) and enrolls the boy in school.

Lizzie goes to great lengths to protect her son from the reality of what kind of man his father is, even to renting a post office box and gathering the letters Frankie writes to his father, then answering them elaborately as if Frankie's dad is sailing around the world.

Things get difficult when Frankie learns his dad's ship, the Accra, will be docking in Greenock.  What's a mum to do?  With a little help from Marie, Lizzie hires a stranger (Gerard Butler) to pretend he's Frankie's dad for a day.

Lizzie is devoted to her son, and this shows so beautifully in the film. It's also charming to see how the stranger softens toward Frankie, asking to spend another day with him.

The film is well directed by Shona Auerbach with excellent photography and a wondrous soundtrack.

This is not a slice of real life type of film, but it is one that will keep you remembering it for a long time.

This is a feel-good movie about finding happiness in a seemingly desparate situation in blue-collar Scotland.
Enjoy - I refer it to people all the time!

Liz flees with Frankie to Scotland to escape the bonds of an abusive man and pretends Frankie's father is aboard a ship called the HMS Accra.  After setting the story for Frankie and pretending for years, which include fake letters detailing adventures and destinations, the make-believe story comes to a crashing end when Frankie learns that the ship has docked near their new home and Liz must find a man who is willing to pretend he is Frankie's dad.  What could be comical is bittersweet and a deaf little boy is left with magical memories.",1203379200,4,791,4.549295774647887

2267138,5,B00094AS9A,"I came upon this small-scale 2004 British film simply because it was recommended within a professional review of the recent romantic dramedy about grieving,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/P-S-I-Love-You/dp/B000YAA6AU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">P.S., I Love You</a>. Both movies deal with how a woman insulates herself from pain by creating a fantasy which merely delays moving on from the tragedy causing her pain. They also share the presence of the charismatic Gerard Butler (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/300/dp/B00005JPLW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">300</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Phantom-of-the-Opera/dp/B0007TKNL0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Phantom of the Opera</a>) as the object of the woman's fantasy. The difference is that&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/P-S-I-Love-You/dp/B000YAA6AU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">P.S., I Love You</a>&nbsp;is an execrable, episodic mess, whereas this film is a quiet, underappreciated gem well worth discovering on DVD. Free of the Hollywood-manufactured cynicism that would have made this movie seem predictably trite, first-time director Shona Auerbach also handles the painterly camerawork here, and she shows a true affinity for the power of still images and thoughtful scene composition throughout. The pacing is leisurely reflecting Auerbach's skill in harnessing the emotional power of silence and lingering stares, which she does to great effect here.

Written by Andrea Gibb, the plot focuses on Frankie, classroom geography whiz and a true old soul in the body of a nine-year old. He has just moved to Scotland's chilly Clyde Coast with his devoted but extremely cautious mother Lizzie and his no-nonsense grandmother. As it turns out, Lizzie is on the run from Frankie's father, a fearsome situation that has caused her to create a fantasy to protect her son. She writes letters to Frankie pretending to be his father, a seafarer sailing the globe on a tanker randomly named the Accra, and he writes back with pride and enthusiasm. Lizzie's reason to continue the charade is poignant - it's the only way he can ""hear"" Frankie's voice since he is deaf. However, complications occur when the real Accra is scheduled to dock, and Lizzie scrambles to find a man willing to play Frankie's father for a day to keep the fantasy alive. Even though the set-up sounds fraught with sentimental contrivances, Auerbach and Gibb manage to avoid most of the pitfalls with their clear-eyed but consistently involving approach.

The child-centric perspective immediately reminds me of two other masterful films of this genre, Jan Svrk's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kolya/dp/B000065V3D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kolya</a>&nbsp;and Takeshi Kitano's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kikujiro/dp/B00004Z1FE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kikujiro</a>. All three gain a deep emotional resonance from the connection between a child and an unintended father figure. There is a palpable bond between Butler and Jack McElhone, who plays Frankie with an honest expressiveness. Their simple scenes together are heartbreaking for the seemingly ephemeral nature of their true relationship. Known more for his action roles, Butler brings a surprisingly doleful, enigmatic quality to the merchant seaman who comes to Lizzie's rescue initially for the financial reward but begins to realize how empty his transitory existence has been. Although he doesn't show up until forty minutes into the film, his subtle performance leaves the lasting impression necessary to make the ruse work. Holding the story together is Emily Mortimer (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lars-and-the-Real-Girl/dp/B0014D5RBE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lars and the Real Girl</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Match-Point/dp/B000EQHXNW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Match Point</a>), who pierces the heart as Lizzie with her fierce determination and increasing vulnerability. She and Butler share an audaciously lengthy shot where they simply stare at each other at the doorway before kissing.

Supporting roles are filled expertly by Mary Riggans as Frankie's protective grandmother and especially Sharon Small as Lizzie's tart-tongued shop-owner friend Marie. The ending has a parable-like quality that will likely be dismissed by the more cynically minded. Personally, I find it the ideal blend of hopeful and heartbreaking. Actually, the entire movie plays out that way, and Auerbach and Gibb deserve credit for maintaining the delicacy of this balance with such unerring aplomb. The extras on the 2005 DVD include an informative commentary track from Auerbach, who is obviously quite vested in the film from her lucid explanations of each scene. There is a brief making-of featurette made up of film clips and on-set video alternating with quick interviews with Auerbach, producer Caroline Wood and the principal cast. Rounding out the extras are a longer interview with Auerbach, repetitive if you have heard the commentary, and eight deleted scenes, some just seconds long. The best is the extended dance sequence which employs black-and-white slow motion to bring an otherworldly sense to what is going on. This is a splendid, life-affirming picture, and hopefully the DVD will bring a broader audience to this hidden gem.",1201737600,9,5566,6.518918918918919

2267140,5,B00094AS9A,"Frankie (Jack McElhone) is a 10 year old Scottish kid being raised by his Mother (Emily Mortimer) and Grandmother Nell (Mary Riggins). They move around quite a lot, but somehow letters from his sailor father keep up with them.

Frankie's penpal Dad really cares a lot about him, writing him surprisingly descriptive letters of his travels and sending him stamps to add to his collection. Frankie writes back with tales about his school, etc.

As a matter of fact, those letters to his Dad are about as expressive as Frankie gets.  He's deaf and does not speak. But he's a sharp cookie, and a champion lip reader and he knows more of what's going on than people think.

When the ship Frankie's Dad is on is going to dock in Glasgow's harbor, Frankie believes his father will come to visit him.  He's so convinced, he risks his prized stamp collection to a fellow classmate in a bet.

That's not going to happen.  Frankie's Mom has a secret.  She's been renting a post office box and writing the letters to Frankie herself.  When she realizes how broken hearted her son will be, she opts to hire a man to play Dad for a Day.

She's looking for a man with no past, no future--and who won't ask questions for the money she pays him.  She gets Gerard Butler, also a sailor, with a melancholy air that speaks of sorrows of his own.

What moved both my husband and I about this story was the sheer emotion between the cast. There's obviously a bond between Jack McElhone and the two women playing his kindred.  Gerard Butler can convey more with just a glance or a gesture than most actors can get across with an entire soliloquy.

The soundtrack and scenery of this film is also amazing. Music very eloquently portrays the moment without overwhelming it. In the 'making of' sequence on the DVD, the director states they'd used old paintings as their guide to reproducing the Scottish landscape and I believe that was an excellent choice. The area around Glasgow is much as I remembered it, somewhat softened by a gray haze cloaking a harsh, rocky landscape.

Billed at the time as that years Billy Elliot this movie was shot in various places around Scotland. A portion of the movie is filmed in Glasgow including the Fish And Chip shop but contrary to most reviews here the film owes all its beautiful scenery to the towns of Greenock and Port Glasgow in the area of Inverclyde which is situated 21 miles from Glasgow. The river views and Mountains where shot in Greenock overlooking the River Clyde and the Beach scene in my home town of Port Glasgow. I couldn't let Glasgow get all the credit. Infact the writer of the film is a Greenockian and has a cameo role in the movie.

The boy who plays Frankie does a good job of playing a mute boys and is believable. Also The accents are quite tame compared to some parts of Scotland. There are plenty of emotional moments that may have you wanting to reach for your hankie. But also fun moments too. The newspaper is based on the local Greenock Telegraph and there is one joke about it that probably only a local would get and understand. Also people have fell in love with the locations and movie so much that the have travelled from America to Inverclyde to see them. If your looking for a movie with lots of action then look elsewhere.

When the Mum discovers her creation is part fact, shortly after her Son's detection, she has to think quickly to keep the fantasy alive and the reality of his violent Father under wraps (his violence had in reality culmianted in the only thing he ever gave the child, his deafness) The hiring of an intially surly and brooding stranger to play the role for a day has unexpected consequences for both the child and Mother and the bleakness of their existance seems on the brink of blossoming anew.

2267162,5,B00094AS9A,"This story of a single mother and her deaf son pulls at the heart strings while avoiding the cliches that would have turned it into a standard Hollywood-style romance. Lizzie (Emily Mortimer), on the run from an abusive husband, keeps alive her nine-year-old son's wish for a loving father by writing him letters from what he's led to believe is his sailor father, aboard a cargo ship sailing the high seas. Complications arise when a ship by the same name docks in the town where they are living, and she hires a sailor to impersonate the boy's father for a day.

The cast is just fine, with Sharon Small from TV's Inspector Lynley series as a supportive friend to Lizzie, who helps her find a man to play Frankie's father. Meanwhile, Jack McElhone as Frankie provides an intelligent and affecting portrayal of a boy dealing manfully with his disability and life's obstacles, while protecting his mother and her illusions. Intended chiefly as a story about a mother and son, the film also touches (perhaps unwittingly, given the director's comments) on the often unsatisfied need among men for fathers who were emotionally - if not physically - more available in their young lives. In that respect, the sailor, played wonderfully by Gerard Butler, takes on an almost mythic quality. Set in Scotland and shot in and around Glasgow, the film has a coolly northern feel at times, which is appropriate for the bittersweetness of what it has to say about people and what is in their hearts. The DVD includes interviews with the cast and filmmakers, and a director's commentary.",1188172800,2,1573,4.847583643122676

2267165,5,B00094AS9A,This movie has lots of different types a love.  Love from a mother for her child.  Love from a son for his father.  First love when you just discover the opposite sex.  Love for a friend despite flaws and failures.  The first spark of love you fell for someone who has taught you something about yourself. Even love that has become possessive and dominant.  It is a really sweet story with a happy ending that treads a narrow walkway between touching and sappy.  I think if the performances of the lead characters weren't so strong the movie would fall into melodrama.  Emily Mortimer is great as a woman who knows how to sacrifice everything and yet is so strong she could conquer the world.  Gerard Butler aside from being gorgeous does a lovely and subtle job of a going from a cynical loner to a man who suddenly discovers the possibility of life.  Jack McElhone is quietly wonderful and a boy who knows more than he is saying and an old soul.  Watch with a friend and some Kleenex.,1186531200,5,986,4.4525139664804465

This little gem of a movie was both humorous and touching, full of actors who realistically played normal people.

Rather than the three act Aristotelean paradigm used in typical movie making, ""Dear Frankie"" introduces us to hardship from the beginning.

The inciting incident comes after the shaping of character, as it should. I consider movies, that depend on early plot points, inferior regardless of the casting. In ""Dear Frankie"", you have no need to hold up an average to inferior screen play by introducing immediate intrigue. The characters provide enough interest to keep the audience engaged.

Shot in Glasgow, Scotland by Director Shona Auerbach with her husband operating as a cameraman, this movie's strong characters will tug at heartstrings in a very positive way.

The story is that of Frankie (Jack McElhone) and his mother Lizzie (Emily Mortimer, MATCH POINT). Recently relocating to yet another new city, Frankie immediately begins writing letters to his father again as soon as he's able. He's been doing this for years and years, never having met his father and only knowing -- via his mum -- that his dad is on a boat at sea named the Accra. Frankie's dad writes back often and Frankie keeps track of his father's movements around the world via a large map posted above his bed. In addition to lacking an active father, Frankie also can't hear, being deaf (supposedly) since birth. This is an additional challenge for him since he has to re-orient people to his handicap every time they move to a new town. Classmates, store owners, librarians, all of them have varying degrees of pity, anxiety, and teasing that easily bounce off of Frankie's prominent mental armor. He's a smart kid, and a ""champion lip reader.""

But Frankie's world is about to change once he learns that his father's ship is scheduled to port at the local docks of their new hometown! Frankie is beside himself with joy, but his mother is strangely downcast. And for good reason. Frankie's father is NOT on a ship at sea and never has been. Lizzie (him mum) has been writing those letters back to Frankie, pretending to be his seafaring father. She had no idea that a ship called the Accra even existed, and now she must deal with its impending arrival and the unveiling of her lies to her son.

Not willing to give-in that easily, Lizzie concocts a plan to have a ""Stranger"" pose as Frankie's father. She meets up with this dark but handsome man that we come to know only as The Stranger (Gerard Butler, BEOWULF & GRENDEL) and promises him an amount of money if he'll pose, for a day, as her son's father. The Stranger agrees, thus setting up circumstances that will lead to a love that Frankie, Lizzie, or even The Stranger thought impossible.

Young Jack McElhone gives a silent yet powerful performance as Frankie, the boy who knows more than he ever lets on. His sweet role is a marvel. Emily Mortimer gives a good performance as Lizzie, Frankie's mum, but is anchored even stronger in her character thanks to the handsome Gerard Butler. Butler's distant but involved portrayal of The Stranger is pulled off exceptionally well, especially since, as the audience, we know nothing about him before, during, or after his visit with Frankie and Lizzie. We suspect several things, though (he may have had an absent father, too, or had a bad relationship that ended in divorce like Lizzie's ...although we're never given any information as such).

The only downer is the side-story relating to Frankie's ""real"" father who is dying of cancer. Perhaps it would have been best to keep any firm father-figure (be it paternal or otherwise) distant from Frankie's life, or fleeting (as in The Stranger). The hospital scenes with Frankie's biological father felt forced and unnecessary.

Otherwise, this is a gem of a film that'll make you smile, shed a few tears, and be grateful there are Strangers among us who can fill the ample shoes of fathers.",1174176000,5,3447,4.746243739565943

One of four films showcased at this month's Portland International Film Festival, Dear Frankie had already created quite a buzz at Cannes, where it elicited a 15-minute standing ovation. Showings at the Sedona, AZ and Cleveland, OH Festivals in March will round out the pre-release schedule for this film fest favorite. This quiet little film from Scotland is impossible not to like, as it observes without judging the interplay between a struggling single mom and her deaf son, and the stranger she has drawn in to support a lie she has perpetrated in order to protect him.

Much to the chagrin of her more practical mother, Lizzie has concocted a full-blown fantasy of a romantic sailor and maritime adventures to explain the physical lack of a father in Frankie's life. She took the name ACCRA from a stamp and has the boy track this imaginary ship and write letters to a PO Box, which she then collects herself and answers in the absent father's name. Predictably, a ship by that name comes into port one day, and Lizzie, rather than dash her son's carefully-protected beliefs, chooses a stranger to stand in for the prodigal dad for 24 hours.

Emily Mortimer portrays the selfless mom with a matter-of-factness that precludes any semblance of cloying sentimentality. Her all-too-familiar plight does not pigeon-hole her as a victim, but rather allows her to be the hero of her own story. And Jack MacElhone plays her 9-year-old son with such guileless directness and humor that there is simply no feeling sorry for him.

The heart of the movie, however, is in the developing relationship between Frankie and the Stranger, aptly played by Gerard Butler, last seen emoting spectacularly as the Phantom of the Opera in a tour de force of song and angst. Here, in a very restrained and nuanced performance, Mr. Butler manages to establish such a strong presence that it is literally palpable even when his character is off-screen. Frankie blossoms at the inclusion of a tangible father figure in his life, and he and the Stranger manage to convey a depth of emotion without resorting to dialogue. This is a subtle form of acting by implication.

This is Shona Auerbach's directorial debut, and it is an auspicious one. Her background in still photography is evident in the gorgeous cinematography, but it is the simple story-telling and the characters that drive the film. Dear Frankie avoids the platitudes and pitfalls of a potentially overwrought theme and provides fresh insights in an almost casual manner. We can only hope that Ms. Auerbach will continue to shed her clear and sympathetic light on other social issues in future films.",1173225600,5,2652,4.950561797752809

2267205,4,B00094AS9A,"I saw this film in 2006, although I've wanted to see it since it was first reviewed on television. I remember thinking, ""yes, I think this is a kind of movie I'd enjoy. Gentle and full of real people, with a dash of romance.""

It took me a while to find it on DVD. I'd forgotten the name. I only remembered ""The Stranger"" and that a kid was involved.

So, I finally get it, watch it, and I think, ""Oh, my. That was wonderful.""

Here's why:

1. Gerard Butler is a revelation. I'd seen him prior on a DVD I own, Tomb Raider: CRADLE OF LIFE, and thought he was very hot and charismatic, holding his own amazingly well against the also charismatic and physically stunning Angelina Jolie. But in DEAR FRANKIE, he delivers a lower key and layered performance. He's not just the hunk or the bad boy or the muscle-bound hero. He's the unnamed man who comes out of the blue to help a woman who needs him to pretend he's a young boy's daddy. He needs to play his part then leave. For money. But we can see something else: He's a man with secrets, and secret hurts, and deep needs that the film never reveals. No, you see it in Butler's eyes, in his body language, in his reactions. Lovely.

2. Emily Mortimer. She is absolutely wonderful as the protective mom who has had a very hard time due to an abusive husband from which she flees. She portrays both determination and vulnerability and neediness and a waifishness that makes you root for her. She's believably desperate.

The woman who plays Emily's mother also adds something special to the film, as does the somewhat strange air of the boy Frankie. He's deaf in the film, and he doesn't get much dialogue, so he has to make it work with gestures and expressions. He does fine. A bit wooden in spots, but for the context, it's fine.

As the story unfolds and we learn things--why Frankie is deaf, who the Stranger is--and we see a believable chemistry erupt between Butler and Mortimer, all we can do is surrender to the gently-paced, emotional stroll through these wounded people's lives. And that kiss...that kiss. It's so perfectly done, mixing apprehension and desire and all the holding back and baggage and tenderness. Oh, that kiss.

A lovely, lovely little film. I recommend it.",1171497600,2,2232,4.521091811414392
2267206,5,B00094AS9A,"I was more than satisfied with the quality of this film. The locale, the accent and  the characters were very real and believable.  Touching story about a mother's protective love for her young son, to maintain an idyllic image of the father who had actually abandoned them. Even the ending was bitter-sweet, yet realistically had to be the way it was.

I enjoyed the director's edition, going through the film again, scene by scene, describing her motives and intentions for choosing the actors, locations, angles and lighting.  The director herself was so personable, I wanted to know everything she shared. This kind of movie is worth seeing again and again.",1171152000,2,661,4.9818181818181815
2267207,5,B00094AS9A,"A Scottish mom tries to maintain a relationship via post between her nine-year-old deaf son and a made-up father, while on the run from his real, abusive father. This won Best Picture at the Los Angeles Film Festival, awards at Heartland and Seattle International Film Festivals, two thumbs up from Ebert & Roper, and a rave review from Leonard Maltin. Independent director Shona Auerbach's brings a rare sensitivity to this her debut film.

Working mom Lizzie (Emily Mortimer - Two Brothers & A Bride, Disney's The Kid) is faced with the moral dilemma of either telling her son the truth: that his absent father was abusive to him, and that is why he is now deaf; or, propagating a lie - that his father is a sailor away at sea, who writes to him regularly, expressing his love for and interest in the boy - letters which she herself writes. And Frankie, her son (Jack McElhone - Young Adam), answers them, as he tracks the path of his dad's ship on a world map hanging by his bed. Lizzie keeps telling herself that she is going to stop writing the letters and tell him the truth; but she continues. When asked why, she says, ""It's the only way I can hear his voice."" You see, Frankie has never spoken, except through his letters.

This is an incredibly poignant film, which pulls on your heartstrings throughout. A crisis occurs one day when the ship that she told Frankie his father was stationed on actually shows up in port. One of the boy's friends makes a bet that his dad won't come see him; but Frankie accepts his bet, saying that he'll bring him to their next soccer match. Lizzie decides she can't let Frankie down, and that she will have to find someone to play the part of Frankie's dad for a day. After a failed attempt at finding someone in a sailors' bar, and a night of desperate depression, her friend Marie (Sharon Small - Inspector Lynley Mysteries) offers to help by giving her the name of a Stranger. The Stranger (Gerard Butler - Phantom Of The Opera, Attila) turns out to be more than Lizzie bargained for: not only is he the perfect ""father"" for Frankie, but she finds herself being drawn to him emotionally as well. There is a definite chemistry between Lizzie and the Stranger, and between the Stranger and Frankie.

Now she really does face a dilemma. She has spent years building walls around her heart and life to protect herself and her son from his abusive father, as well as trying to put miles between them and him. They are literally on the run as he continues to pursue them. Now, here is a Stranger asking her to let her walls down. What should she do? And what should she tell Frankie about his father?

There are no easy answers. She's going to have to give up some things in order to have certain other things. She's going to have to decide what's most important. That's not so simple in relationships where you're afraid of hurting the ones you love, and when you've been hurt and are afraid of being hurt again. I love these types of stories because they are like life: you have to give up something or someone you want for something or someone else you need or want more. Life is about choices. Will Lizzie make the right ones? It's a great dilemma, and a great film.

This is an honest story that unfolds naturally and leaves you wanting more. The performances are top-notch all the way around. Production values are high, as Auerbach realizes her vision perfectly. This is a little film with a big heart that will leave men longing for their fathers and women longing for Gerard Butler, the current heartthrob, as well as an excellent actor with a promising future.

2267208,5,B00094AS9A,"I have to admit that the only reason I added this DVD to my Netflix queue was because Gerard Butler was in it.  Having watched this film, however, I have to say that Butler is by far not the only thing that makes this wonderful story a must-see.  Set in Scotland, Dear Frankie tells the story of Lizzie (Emily Mortimer) and her struggles to keep her son Frankie (Jack McElhone) away from his father. While she does that, she wants her son, who is deaf, to think he has a loving father who is always at sea and sends him letters, though she's the one who writes the letters.  But the charade comes to an end when Frankie makes a bet with a classmate and Lizzie has to present a father to Frankie.  So she hires a stranger (Gerard Butler) to pass as his dad.  There are some twists and turns throughout the film.

This is a very thought-provoking, poignant film that shows the depths of a young woman's love for her son and how far she'd go to make her child happy.  The scenes with Frankie and his pretend dad bonding are wonderful.  Again, like in The Phantom of the Opera, Gerard Butler has impressed me with his acting, with his facial expressions and ability to transmit thoughts and emotions without saying a single word.  I loved his facial expressions and the emotions he conveyed when Lizzie told him about Frankie's father and what he'd done to the kid.  He has a very expressive (and very handsome) face and I couldn't keep my eyes off him. His nameless character remains an enigma from beginning to end.  The one thing that is obvious is The Stranger's growing fondness and admiration for both Frankie and Lizzie. I was disappointed with the fact that his character doesn't enter the story until forty-five minutes into the film, but the rest of the storyline is wonderful and I was engaged throughout.  Mortimer is also wonderful and she looked familiar to me.  I finally remember where I'd seen her -- she had small roles in the movies Notting Hill and Scream 3.  Jack McElhone is very talented for his young age and he transmitted his emotions beautifully.  Overall, I loved this film and its twists at the end.  I highly recommend this film.  (I also recommend that, if you have trouble understanding the thick Scottish brogue, you read the subtitles.)  Hollywood, take note, for this wonderful flick shows that you don't need cliche and formulaic scenes to make a movie work. This DVD is worth owning and I will definitely add it to my DVD collection.",1170547200,3,2466,4.553287981859411
2267209,5,B00094AS9A,"There's nothing that I can say here that others haven't already said about this film.  I tend to like the ""Irish"" type of movies where things are more bleak, and aren't wrapped up as neatly as in American films, leaving them a bit more realistic.

It is by far one the best films I have ever seen.  It had its heart-warming moments and its funny moments.  It very is real, and not like the many blockbuster hits you have seen in theaters. It felt like something that can happen in real life.  It does not have its happy ending like other films but still a worth to see.  Trust me when I say that this will film will not bore you at all.

The actors also did a lovely job in this movie. I loved so much I lent my movie to others and they also enjoyed it as well.

This movie has been the best movie I have seen in about a year. And I am one who has seen many films in my lifetime.

 This story is about a single mother, Lizzie (Emily Mortimer), and her deaf son Frankie (Jack McElhone). Lizzie fled from an abusive marriage, taking Frankie and her mother to make sure she never went back. As Frankie gets older Lizzie is unable to tell him what a terrible man his father was, but she knows that as he gets older he is going to start asking questions about his dad. Lizzie decides to begin writing Frankie letters authored by his father telling him about life as a sailor aboard the ACCRA. Lizzie continues to write Frankie for a few years and is able to arrange a deal with the post office for Frankie to write letters back. As Frankie nears his 10th birthday the real ACCRA is due to dock in Glasgow, Scotland where they live. Lizzie has to make a decision... tell Frankie the truth, or find a man to be Frankie's dad for just one day! Lizzie's mother encourages her to tell Frankie the truth but deep down Lizzie does not want to stop the letters because reading Frankie's letters is ""the only way she can hear his voice"".

My only complaint comes with an unexpected twist at the end that doesn't seem to be justified.  But DEAR FRANKIE is still quite an emotionally evocative film.",1142380800,,976,4.808383233532934

What makes this movie so well done is the restraint all of the actors display when portraying such deep emotions.  I was brought to tears near the end of the movie, yet felt happy and optimistic at the very end.  I recommend this movie for anyone age six and up, as people of all ages can relate to the characters and the story.  I do recommend that English subtitles be displayed for American or hearing-impaired viewers as the Scottish dialect can be difficult to understand if one is not used to hearing it.",1141689600,2,608,4.644859813084112

It's quietly funny, sweet without being saccharine, and the actors do an excellent job conveying emotions that go deeper than their dialogue. The story is original and unexpected: a mother corresponding with her deaf son, but writing the letters as if they were from his da (his dad), whom she has told him is away at sea as a merchant seaman on the ACCRA.

When it turns out, though, that the ship is real and is soon to arrive in their port, she hires a perfect stranger to pretend to be ""Da."" She doesn't want to know anything about the stranger, not his name or where he's sailing next, but her son has plans of his own. He knows the stranger is not Da, but he maneuvers to spend more time with him -- and to make sure his mom spend time with the stranger, too!

The ending is open, leaving some threads of the story untied, but it's perfect and filled with hope.

The boy Frankie was played well with his special needs  combined into his personality.  All in all a interesting drama with heavy tones throughout the film.,1140480000,5,460,4.7974683544303796

2267277,5,B00094AS9A,"DEAR FRANKIE has all the elements of a film that will tug at heartstrings: lovable characters, pluck and determination, and a story that is both moving and believable. It tells the story of Frankie, a hearing impaired boy living in working class Glasgow, Scotland being raised by Lizzie, his single mother and a loving and protecting grandmother. Lizzie does not want Frankie to know the truth about his father, and leads Frankie to believe that his father is a member of the merchant marine traveling the world. Frankie writes letters to his father, and his mother answers them, signing them from the father and enclosing stamps. The boat that Frankie's father is supposed to be sailing on is called the ACCRA and when a ship docks with the same name, Frankie gets his hopes up about meeting his father. To solve the problem, Lizzie hires a man to pose as his father ""Davey."" Frankie spends a magical two days with his pseudo-father and Lizzie finds his wonderful too.

The film could easily become a clich, which would still be an enjoyable film, but the film remains charming throughout and original to keep the viewers engaged. There is a back-story involving Frankie's true father and the ways in which Lizzie has to come to terms with all that ahs happened in her past. We get glimpses of pain and loneliness in both Lizzie's life and Davey, the man who pretends to be Frankie's father. We also see that Frankie has both strength and wisdom no one realizes. We also see glimpses of the innocence of childhood, particularly when a young girl catches the young Frankie's eyes and the rivalry and friendship Frankie has with his sometimes nemesis and sometimes best friend Ricky Monroe. The film ends leaving the viewer thinking because instead of tidying up loose ends, we wonder what will happen next, but also believe that things will turn out better for Frankie, his mother, and Davey.

A wonderful script, and authentic setting, and convincing performances by Gerard Butler as Davey, Emily Mortimer as Lizzie and bets of all, young Jack Mc Elhone as Frankie make this a film that will be loved by viewers and enjoyed for years to come.",1138924800,9,2143,4.773584905660377

I heard it reviewed by Roger Ebert when it first came out but forgot about it then saw it on my Netflix recommendations and knew I needed to see this right away.

I read somewhere this movie was described as ""wise and wondrous"".  That is an understatement.  This tender, poignant, sweet movie is so perfect I can't for the life of me understand why it hasn't been talked about more or why it didn't win all sorts of awards.  The scene with Gerard Butler and Emily Mortimer walking along the quay after the dance had me in tears as Frankie's Mom opens up to the stranger she has hired to be Frankie's ""Dad"".

2267282,5,B00094AS9A,"Glasgow, where this movie is set, is a tough, industrial town.  The handful of characters in this minor masterpiece are just making it, each one trying to endure the injustices life has dished out.  Lizzie (played by the irresistible Emily Mortimer) and son Frankie, are engaged in a sophisticated ritual that insulates them both from the pain initiated by Frankie's father.  We are never quite sure how completely Frankie believes the mythology about the letters, although it is certain that he desperately wants to believe.

With the arrival of the actual ship his father has allegedly been working on comes the inevitable end of the masquerade, and with it, some long overdue growth. The stranger, (Gerard Butler), who Lizzie has hired to impersonate Frankie's father, brings tremendous quiet dignity to the role, and his interactions with Lizzie have an understated power that electrifies the screen.

Beautifully shot, brilliantly acted, this is one of those truly rare movies worth owning and watching more than once.  Dear Frankie is not remotely sentimental, but it does enrich your soul. These are real, three-dimensional people doing their best. You will care about all of them and hope desperately that things work out.

2267299,5,B00094AS9A,"Don't watch this little film without the English subtitles. The Scottish accents are like a foreign language; by the time you're accustomed, the movie's over. And after a few minutes, you won't want to miss a word of its heartfelt story and script. There's more to ""Dear Frankie"" than meets the eye, although what meets the eye is lovingly photographed in a small seacoast town. Mother love is so rarely the sole subject of a movie that when it is done properly, as it is here, we're surprised. Why haven't other filmmakers revisited this theme?

A mother (Emily Mortimer) fools her small deaf son (Jack McElhone) into believing the absent but abusive father he's never seen is away at sea. She writes letters to him from ""Da,"" and he writes back, allowing her to see into her son's heart. When the boy learns his Da's ship is in port, the mother hires a stranger (Gerard Butler) to pose as his father. What could possibly go wrong? You think you know but, like the twist in ""Million Dollar Baby,"" you really don't. All the performances are so natural that although you want to cry, you can't.

She makes the mistake of using a real ship that comes to port where they live. For some reason she decides the only way out is to hire someone to play her son's father for a day.

I loved all the characters. The supportive grandmother, the deaf boy, the man without a past and the protective mother. I was expecting Gerard Butler's character to have more of a pivotal role (only because I adore him). Despite being the replacement father he is not the main focus and is only in a few scenes. The focus is the relationship between the boy and his mother. Trust, love, communication, abuse, friendship, deception and forgiveness are all issues highlighted in the film.

The movie sagged a bit in the middle but overall it was enjoyable and had a satisfying ending. I left thinking it would be a good book. I would definitely watch it again. Written by M. E. Wood",1130284800,3,1072,4.520618556701031
2267301,5,B00094AS9A,"I will not start with the usual plot synopsis, as other reviewers have already done that. I will just say that this is a beautiful and touching film, brought to us by a very talented cast. The nine year old boy playing Frankie, Jack McElhone, is just amazing. As the director, Shona Auerbach points out, since this is a silent part (Frankie is deaf), all of Frankie's acting has to be done through body language and facial expression. And Jack does this superbly. You hardly realize he does not speak throughout the movie, since his face and his gestures speak so much and convey so many emotions.
The relationship between Frankie and the stranger who is hired by his mother to play his father for one day is very believable and very moving. The stranger, a sceptic at the outset, becomes emotionally involved and while at first he does not think much of Frankie's mother for doing this, ends up respecting her and so do we, the audience. Personally, I felt I did not like Frankie's mother at first, as her motives seem unclear. We learn about her motives with the stranger, and that's when sympathy shifts.

I was also particularly impressed by the stranger's emotion in the scene where he meets Frankie: he needs to be believable, and he is very tense wondering if he has done well. I felt the tension with him. Gerald Butler is wonderful, looking handsome, tall, and reassuring, the father figure Frankie really needs.

There are so many touching moments I will let you discover for yourselves, as I don't want to spoil it for you. I will just say that the entire movie is full of twists and turns, much more than you'd expect. In the second half a surprise awaits in virtually every scene to the very end , and I also cried at virtually every one of these scenes.

""Dear Frankie"" is filmed in Scotland, and features some beautiful scenery. I also enjoyed listening to the Scottish accent used throughout the film.

The additional material includes the director's commentary, an interview with the director, which I found quite interesting, and some deleted scenes, one of which at least actually reveals some insight into one of the minor characters. I'm thinking it's particularly clever to cut such a scene in the official release, and then add it to the deleted scenes section on the DVD, although I'm not sure this was intentional.

I enjoyed the movie, and I'll certainly want to rewatch it. Even though I now know about all the twists and turns in the plot, it will actually be interesting to follow the range of emotion displayed by this talented cast with all this pre-knowledge in mind.",1129161600,20,2599,4.678336980306346

If you are in doubt whether to see this film or not, please take my advice and don't miss it. ""Dear Frankie"" is entertaining, touching, and has remarkably good actors. Also, the Scottish scenery where the story develops is extremely beautiful, probably even more so for someone that isn't familiar with it, like me. What is more, the film has a great ending, that with leave you with a smile on your face and wishing for a sequel. Finally, and as an extra bonus for all the women reading this, it has Gerard Butler as part of the cast. Butler is an excellent actor who happens to be extremely handsome and my new favourite leading man  :)

I believe that Shona Auerbach, the director of this film, deserves congratulations on a wonderful movie, that is part drama and part comedy at times. The whole cast consists of wonderful actors that really become the characters they are playing, conveying what they are supposed to be feeling so clearly that it impossible not to be trapped by the story after the first few minutes.

The plot of this film isn't overly complicated. Lizzie Morrison (Emily Mortimer) abandoned her abusive husband years ago, taking her little son with her. Lizzie lives with her son Frankie (Jack McElhone) and her mother (Mary Riggans) in a Scottish city near the sea. Frankie is deaf, and as he grows up, he wants to know more about the father he doesn't remember. As a result, his mother makes up a whole new personality for Frankie's father, and tells her son that his father is a sailor, visiting exotic places in the ship Accra. Frankie begins to write letters to his ""father"", and his mother answers them, trying to protect Frankie from the truth of what and who his father really is.

But one day, when Frankie is nine, another kid tells him that the Accra is going to visit the city, and bets Frankie that his father won't drop by to visit him. When Lizzie finds out about that, she has no better idea that to hire someone, a stranger ""with no past and no future"", to play Frankie's dad. Thanks to the help of her friend Marie (Sharon Small), she finds someone that seems good enough, a stranger (Gerard Butler) that will only be in town for two days. What will happen? Well, if you are really interested, watch this film.

All in all, I highly recommend ""Dear Frankie"" to you, unless who hate films that aren't full of action, or cannot stand the melodious Scottish accent. Personally, I don't mind the lack of fast-paced action if the story is good enough (and in this case it is), and I find the Scottish brogue enchanting. I sincerely think that most of you will not only like, but love this movie. Enjoy it!

2267316,5,B00094AS9A,"Like many people, I heard of ""Dear Frankie"" by word of mouth, otherwise I would have missed this deeply satisfying experience.  Try finding a theater or movie rental store that carried it, and you'll see how frustrating it was for many of us to see it.

Shona Auerbach, the cast, and the crew are to be commended on their top-notch work on this production.

I can't recall another movie I've watched in the last 10 years that made me feel so many emotions by the time the credits rolled.  This movie has it all - a talented cast, good script, evocative music, and scenery of Scotland that - when all put together - make for a tremendous movie experience.

Emily Mortimer, Jack McElhone, Gerry Butler, Sharon Small and Mary Riggans give their all.  ""Acting"" has never seemed so effortless before when you watch these people interact with each other.  The boy is especially good, considering his age and the fact that he isn't deaf in real life.  Emily Mortimer has a ethereal fragility about her that's necessary for this role.  Sharon Small, who I already admire from the Inspector Lyndley mystery series, has a smaller supporting role but does it justice.  Riggans is perfectly cast as Nell, mother to Lizzie and grandmother to Frankie.  My favorite scene with her involves fingernail polish, whiskey and Barbara Stanwyck (watch it, you'll see what I mean!).

And then there's Gerry Butler...the mysterious Stranger with a stoic personality that oh-so-gradually warms up over the course of his involvement with Frankie and Lizzie.  Mr. Butler is the most under-rated actor going right now.  He consistantly gives tremendous performances and his ability to use his entire face and body are what make him a cut above.

There may be a slight difficulty for American viewers in following the dialogue due to the Scottish dialect, but in my opinion this enhances rather than detracts from my enjoyment of the film.  Since to my ears it is ""different"", the movie further takes on a dreamy, surreal feeling that is only enhanced by the music and the Scottish setting.

No one with a heart in their chest should walk away disappointed in ""Dear Frankie"".  In fact, I urge you to rent it, borrow it, or buy it and see for yourself right now.

Finally the past catches up with her again just as the boy stands to risk all if the real father doesn't finally show up.  Her friend appoints a 'stranger' to stand in as the real father and this is truly where the film becomes so wonderful with such tension and subtle beauty.  It's a deeply moving film but no melodrama, everything is understated which gives it far more power.  I'd have liked to have seen the mother do more signing.  That's my only criticism.  The stand-in father was awesome as he warms to his position.  By contrast with American film which often does the father-son scenario with such predictable sugar-coated schmalz this is how it should be done so that it rings true, not hollow, and touches us in ways that the more glossy versions can't.

2267318,5,B00094AS9A,"Maybe I'm getting soft, but I was quite touched by this movie.  I don't naturally gravitate toward heartwarming dramas, but the premise of this film sounded quite interesting and, after seeing Phantom of the Opera, I've become a Gerard Butler fan.  Dear Frankie really is the kind of film we need in this increasingly cynical world.  It's all about love of the strongest kind.

Frankie (Jack McElhone) is a deaf, nine-year-old boy who lives with his mother and grandmother, and the little family moves around fairly often.  Frankie's dad is a sailor; the child has no actual memories of his father, but the two exchange letters every week or two.  Actually, though, his mother Lizzie (Emily Mortimer) is the one writing the letters to Frankie, making up all the stuff his ""father"" tells him about life at sea.  She feels guilty about lying to her son this way, but she has her reasons - for one thing, she doesn't want Frankie to know that his father is no good and that the reason they move so often is to keep his father from finding out where they are; equally important, though, is the fact that she really only hears her son's ""voice"" in the letters he writes to his father.  Frankie reads lips very well, and he and his mother certainly do communicate, but he really opens up only in the letters he writes.  It looks like these letters back and forth will continue indefinitely - but then Frankie learns that his father's ship is set to dock right there in Glasgow.  His mother sort of freaks out when she learns about this (she didn't even know a ship with that name existed).  Rather than tell Frankie the truth, she finds a stranger (Gerard Butler) to be Frankie's dad for a day.  It's all rather awkward at first, as ""Davey"" clearly isn't used to interacting with a ""son,"" but he warms up to Frankie - and to Lizzie - rather quickly.

The big question is, of course, how the movie will end.  Things get even more complicated as things go along, with Lizzie ultimately facing a really tough decision related to Frankie's real father.  I must say I was very happy with the conclusion, as things played out quite differently than I expected - and an already poignant film became even more emotionally compelling in the process.  It really is a wonderful ending.

I would go so far as to call this a truly precious movie.  I had a little trouble with the accents, especially at first, but once my ears tuned to the thick Scottish brogue, things became a lot easier.  The acting is really so superb, though, that you could easily get swept up in the story even if you didn't understand a word anyone was saying.  Great acting does not need dialogue, and this movie offers weighty proof to that statement.  If you like a lot of action in your movies, this one isn't going to satisfy you, but for those who enjoy a well-made, heartwarming drama, Dear Frankie is far too good to be missed.",1128038400,10,2891,4.531791907514451

It is sensitive, as near to real life as you can get and well acted. The film is slow to start but when you are into it it's like a book you can't put down. The ending is up to your imagination which can be irritating - most people however would plump for just one ending.

2267324,3,B00094AS9A,"DEAR FRANKIE is a slow-paced, meandering tale in which the ""hero"" of the film doesn't make an appeareance until the film is halfway over, which leaves you waiting for the appearance of the ""hired"" father for about 40 minutes of getting to know LIZZIE, FRANKIE and Lizzie's mom (we could have done this in about 15 minutes tops). The story is original and interesting, but Mortimer has only one expression throughout the film. Her character isn't very nice, either, and the ex-husband seemed just thrown into the film. A flashback to his violent tendancies or something could have helped you really sympathize with Lizzie, whom I thought was a real cardboard character.

I admit that I went to see it because of Gerard Butler, but he wasn't enough for me to recommend this movie at anything over 10 dollars. Rent it or go to the library, but don't fork over 20 dollars to see this film. It's good, but it could have been better starting with the writing for this film. The backer for this film has put out much better material. If you want a scottish film try Millions.

2267327,5,B00094AS9A,"A romance, but a gritty one.  The plot is quite plausible and the setting---I think, in Glasgow---adds to the grit.  Our heroine is flawed, as is our hero but these flaws make them believable.  A very gun-shy Emily Mortimer (as Lizzie) has been on the run for years, making her world revolve around her son and her mother---both of whom are as untrusting as she is.  Jack McElhone does an extraordinary job as Lizzie's deaf son, Frankie, who has been writing to his absent father (a merchant sailor) for some time---and these letters read as backdrop by Jack McElhone add a poignant touch.

The plot complicates when a fellow student of Frankie's jibes at him that his dad's ship is to dock soon---not believing the father will show.  See the movie to see how Gerard Butler enters the scene.  He is winsome in his gruff affection and wariness, striking just the right note as the heretofore unseen correspondent.

2267355,5,B00094AS9A,"The movie is a heart warming tale about a mother, Lizzie, so determined to protect her nine year old deaf but almost nymphishly intelligent son Frankie that she a Stranger to pretend to be his father.

After almost constantly moving Lizzie finally moves Frankie and her mother to a port city in Scotland. Lizzie has been writing to Frankie for years pretending to be his father and telling Frankie that his father is a Petti Officer on a ship. She vividly describes far off destinations and even goes as far as to purchase foreign stamps for Frankie to collect. But this plan goes awry when the ship that Frankie believes his dad is on comes into their port.

Frankie makes a bet with a kid in his class that his father will come to see him and Lizzie is forced to find someone to pretend to be his father or face the prospect of telling her som the that she is the one writing the letters. She confides this to her mom and friend Marie. She tells Marie that she wants to find a Stranger with no past and no future to give Frankie one day of happiness. Marie finds a handsome Stranger and Lizzie pays him to spend a day with her son, with her following them of course. One day becomes two as the Stranger comes to see how remarkable Frankie and his mother are.

This creates an interesting conundrum when Lizzie and the Stranger are romanticly drawn to each other. The Stranger allows Lizzie to let her guard down for one evening as bith Lizzie and her son conquor the Stranger's rugged heart.

Gerald Butler, the Stranger, looks good in anything he touches, but the rapport he establishes with his younger star,Frankie- Jack McElhone, is incredible. Emily Mortimer, Lizzie, is wonderful as the protective and yet gentle mother. Mary Riggins, Nell, provides comic relief as the eccentric grandmother of Frankie and Sharon Small, Marie, is wonderful as Lizzie's friend.

2267390,4,B00094AS9A,"Emily Mortimer and Gerard Butler are fantastic in this small film set in Scotland.  Though some say the story is simple (at first sight, yes), I strongly recommend that you watch the film without knowing the plot, even the situations of the characters.  Trust me, there are surely some flaws and plot holes, but if you need a good-hearted, sincerely-made drama, 'Dear Frankie' is the one for you.

[MINOR SPOILERS INCLUDED] The film is about Lizzie and Frankie, mother and son who just moved to another city in Scotland with the grandmother.  Lizzie, she thinks, is protecting her deaf son from the painful past, which has something to do with their ever-moving lifestyle.  These secrets are not surprising, as you see, but a more important thing is to be revealed.

That is the letters Frankie keeps on writing to his father, who he thinks is a sailor, always on the ship ACCRA, someday coming back to him.  The fact is, you know, the real father is not someone Frankie imagines, but for the understandable reasons Lizzie keeps on lying to her son.

But what if the ship named ACCRA is really coming to the port of the city?  What if Frankie wants to meet his ""real"" father?  That's when Gerard Butler's stranger steps in, acting as Frankie's father.  What follows after that, you must see for yourself.

[GOOD LOCATION AND CHARACTERS] Shona Auerbach (her feature debut), doing photography too, is successful in presenting the feeling of the Scottish city and the people, with a great help from the well-chosen locations and the talented actors.  Emily Mortimer (seen in 'Disney's 'The Kid' and others) is effective as Lizzie, but more impressive is Gerard Butler, who becomes a perfectly credible 'stranger' with a lillte bit of mystery.  As you know, he was in 'Attila' 'Dracula 2000' and yes, 'Phantom of the Opera.'  In 'Dear Frankie' he proves that he can be a good-natured, ordinary male human without losing the charisma he showed in the past.

Though I disagree with the director's decision to include some characters (especially the role of Davey), and the ending could be shorter and tighter, the film is very good as it is, in not only presenting the unique story, but showing the details of the life of these people, without which the impact from the final letter would be a false one.  As it is, despite some implausible situations, 'Dear Frankie' is a small but very touching film.",1124323200,,2396,4.790754257907542
2267391,5,B00094AS9A,"This is a beautiful, touching film of love in its various forms. This is a story of a mother's love for her deaf son and her efforts to protect him from the knowledge of an abusive father.  It is also a story of a son's love for a father he has never known. Frankie looks forward to receiving letters from his father filled with stories of adventure. However, it is his mother, Lizzie, who actually writes the letters. She faces a dilemma when Frankie's father's ship is due to dock in their town. You can feel her anxiety as she tries to bring about a solution by finding a man to substitute for Frankie's father, all to no avail.  She ends up with ""the stranger"", Gerard Butler. He takes on the job and accepts the pay. However, as the story unfolds, you can see the change in him, when he starts to care not only for Frankie, but also for Lizzie. The one drawback to this film is the fact that it is Scottish and the dialogue can be difficult to follow at times. However, it is worth the effort to watch it and listen carefully.  You can also use the English subtitles to assist you. It is a wonderful movie that does make you feel good.

And I found myself caring about him. What I liked most about Frankie was that he did not feel sorry for himself, so I sometimes forgot that Frankie could not actually hear.  During the club scene when Sharon Small's character asks the Stranger about his choice of cigarettes, I found my heart pounding, thinking that Frankie must have ""heard"" the comment and all was lost. And then there is Gerard Butler. I originally bought the movie mostly to see his performance. He has incredible presence and can easily steal the scene so to speak, and yet his subdued take on the Stranger was perfect. He was indeed mysterious, insipiring in me a wariness and a curiosity to know more about this man. Gerard Butler has the most expressive eyes; the look he gives Emily Mortimer's character on the boardwalk when she tells him about Frankie's father was priceless. That look shows the compassion he feels for her and Frankie and it made me cry. Dear Frankie is a great movie and I definitely recommend it.",1123804800,2,1309,4.732456140350878

2267420,4,B00094AS9A,"To avoid her ex-husband, Lizzie Morrison (Emily Mortimer) moves her family often, this time settling in Glasgow, Scotland. Lizzie hadn't the heart to tell her young son Frankie (Jack McElhone) about his real father, so she told him that his dad is a petty officer on the HMS Accra, sailing around the globe. Frankie recounts his life in expressive letters to his ""father"", which his mother answers with creative stories about faraway ports and life at sea. The ruse is threatened when the HMS Accra, which Lizzie had no idea existed, is scheduled to dock in Glasgow. Frankie expects to see his father in person now. In spite of her mother's (Mary Riggans) admonitions and advice to tell Frankie the truth, Lizzie is determined to find someone to pose as Frankie's father for a day.

Director Shona Auerbach makes an impressive feature film debut with ""Dear Frankie"". At first it seems as if Lizzie was wrong in lying to her son, concerned more with the image she would like Frankie to have of his family than with his needs or well-being. As the film progresses, we understand more about her motives and her decision takes on at least a little moral ambiguity. This is a character drama, so the cast has to carry this obviously contrived story into the realm of believability. And they do a fantastic job. Emily Mortimer expresses Lizzie's love for her son, fear of her past, and reluctance to form relationships without being the least bit melodramatic. Mary Riggans is blunt and endearing as Lizzie's somewhat disapproving but always caring mother Nell.  Gerard Butler plays the stranger whom Lizzie finds to pose as Frankie's father. He brings his masculine, handsome, leading man qualities to bear, but also expresses an empathy toward Lizzie and Frankie that is touching.

Shona Auerbach was the cinematographer on the film as well as its director, and her husband Graeme Dunn was the camera operator. Meticulous attention to color and camera work is evident, and ""Dear Frankie"" is visually pleasant and consistent in its earthy tones. We learn about Frankie through his letters, which he narrates in voice-over. This is an interesting technique, because Frankie is deaf and does not speak in the film. The letters he writes to his father give his thoughts a voice. ""Dear Frankie"" is an engaging family drama with an attractive and talented cast that manages to avoid most of the clichs you might expect of such an improbable story.

The DVD (Walt Disney 2005): Bonus features include 2 featurettes, 8 deleted scenes with optional commentary, and an audio commentary.

2267423,5,B00094AS9A,"I can't say when I last watched such a lovely, quietly heartfelt, heartbreaking but uplifting film.

The truly wonderful thing about it was how underplayed it was. Everything happens and you know it happens, and yet it's hardly ever externalised. It's all inside the characters. The basic plot could have been really pat and melodramatic -- deaf boy's mother invents a story that his dad is at sea, the ship comes in, she has to find dad for the day -- but instead of being melodramatic, it comes across as human and profound.

Emily Mortimer, who plays the boy's mother, is fantastic. Somewhere along the way you realise that this story is about her fantasy as much as about the boy's (or more so), and the way she manages to convey her own life history without ever really giving it away is amazing.

The same is actually true of Gerard Butler's character, though we find out even less about him. His character development happens entirely on the inside, practically without dialogue and yet you're there for it all, and you catch all the little changes.

And of course, the little boy is superb -- it's such a great character, too. A clever, sly but thoughtful and loving boy, who doesn't feel sorry for himself. He seems to be straightforward at first, but in light of what we find out at at the end of the movie, you begin to reassess his actions and realise that he's just as ""internalised"" and deep as the adults.

Anyway, if you haven't yet seen this movie, you really must!",1122940800,2,1482,4.577358490566038
2267424,5,B00094AS9A,"Now, honestly, when I heard the premise of this movie, I thought ""hokey!"" It just sounded a little too corny and cliched for my cynical little tastes.

But I was seriously bowled over by how good this movie was, and the acting is what makes it so touching. The boy playing Frankie was amazing-he had this face that conveyed so much without ever speaking. His mother, played by Emily Mortimer, was heartbreaking-her slightest actions illustrated what a wounded soul she was, and yet a survivor as well. And ""the stranger""-played by Gerard Butler-really does just up the emotional ante like 10 knots. As the imposter Dad, he really does figure into the most powerful scenes of the movie with his mixed feelings of wanting to distance himself and yet connect with the loveable Frankie-as well as the mother.....

This movie is a keeper-I'm buying it on amazon.com tonight cause it's one of those movies you'll easily watch more than once. While the premise sounds sorta like a lame romantic comedy set up, this isn't a romantic comedy. It's more like a very touching movie about the lengths we will go for others we love-or even have just met, like in the stranger's case. And extra points for the great chemistry between Gerard Butler and Emily M.-they really do light up the screen together and there's one scene in particular that will just make you sigh between the two of them.",1122768000,5,1379,4.741666666666666

This is a film not to be missed, and I think it has Oscar written all over it for Best Actress and Best Screen Writing.  Emily Mortimer is amazing in this role, and Gerard Butler made for the perfect ""stranger"".

The dialogue is simple but packed with emotion.  You are captured from the first moment of the film to the very end. A young deaf boy, Frankie Morrison, living with his mother and grandmother writes to a father he has never seen. What he doesn't know is that his mother answers his letters and has never revealed to him the truth about his dad.  By sheer coincidence, a ship happens to dock in town carrying the same name as the one his father supposedly works on.  Frankie's mother now has to produce a father and hires a stranger to spend the day with him.

I found the originality of the story very compelling.  This one can be a tear jerker, but in a very sweet and endearing way.  I rank this right up there with Good Will Hunting.  This is worth every dollar at the video rental.",1122681600,5,1065,4.415384615384616

2267440,5,B00094AS9A,"Dear Frankie was an endearing movie.  It was simply a lump in your throat kind of a story from beginning to end.  The boy that played Frankie was equally as good as the boy cast as Peter in ""Finding Neverland"".  I loved the charaters (all of them, even Mom (except for her language).  The story was beautiful, sad and sweet with a couple of wonderfully surprising twists.  I really didn't know that Frankie had caught on.  The acting was so good that it made the movie.  We all know the story and the acting go hand in hand.

I've shown it to several people who had never heard of it and so far I haven't sat through it with anyone who didn't need a kleenex before it was over.  I did see room for a sequel and I would be thrilled if they would do one.

It's so refreshing to see movies like this.  Can never understand why it wasn't a bigger hit in the U.S.  I'm always amazed at how the film industry can put so much junk in movie houses just because somebody famous is in a bad movie.

If you haven't seen this movie - you will miss joining the rest of us for some ""warm gingerbread and cinnamon tea"".

I know Gerard Butler and Emily Mortimer both said they were proud of this movie as they certainly should be.  I was too!!!!",1121817600,7,1229,4.148305084745763
2267441,5,B00094AS9A,"When I first heard about this movie, I didn't really know much about it and thus, didn't expect much. All I knew was that my favorite actor, Gerard Butler, was in it, so why not watch? After two long months following it's limited release, I finally found a theater nearby (really 2 hours away) that was playing this film. By that time, I had heard so many things about it that I just HAD to go and check it out for myself.

This movie was such a beautiful gem of one on so many different levels. The fact that the film itself was shot in such a simple way brought out the beauty of it. It didn't need to be glamorous to be loved. The storyline was so unique and had a fairytale-like quality to it. However, some of the harsh reality it provided was enough, so as to constantly pluck at your heartstrings, in different ways. At one moment, I was filled with joy. The next, my heart was shattering into a million pieces.

A main reason as to why was due to the superb acting of everyone involved in this film. Emily Mortimer, who played Lizzie, did a phenomenal job as Frankie's mother. She brought so much life, sorrow, pain, and love to the character, and you could just see it in her face the entire time. She worked so hard to portray how far a parent would go for her child and for the unconditional love that she holds for him. Gerard Butler as the Stranger was just perfect. At first, not much was known about the character, and so the part was written in such a way as to show him as somewhat distant. But as this beautiful story unfolded, Gerard truly kept up and stole my heart. With every glance, every look in his eyes, you can see the real and raw emotion that his character was supposed to have. He truly let himself go in this role and WAS the Stranger, because he knew exactly what was going through his head. Jack McElhone, who played Frankie, was cast excellently. For such a young boy who played mostly a silent role in the film, he delivered such a heartfelt performance and seemed to do it with ease. He also evoked so much emotion from the audience, just with his facial expressions and body language, and he did it all so well. I truly hope that he gets all of the recognition he deserves, now and in the future, because he did a fantastic job. The supporting cast, including Mary Riggans as Lizzie's mother and Sharon Small as Marie, was also brilliantly chosen. They brought such warmth and humor to the film, as well as true emotion and feeling.

Overall, this film was such a heartbreaking, but delightful pleasure to watch. Upon finishing it the first time, the feelings built up during the course of it left the theater with me, which rarely occurs. I felt happy and sad, hope and doubt, all at once and couldn't decide where to stay! This was such a touching yet simple story, and has quickly become an all-time favorite of mine. I wouldn't change one thing about it and would strongly recommend it to anyone!",1121472000,10,2937,4.375457875457876
2267442,5,B00094AS9A,"One thing that writers like to do from time to time is to really pour on the irony.  No good deed, especially if it is an act of deception in a good cause, goes unpunished.  So while we are watching everything come together in ""Dear Frankie,"" we are waiting for the other shoe to drop.  Of course it does, but not in a predictable way, which is one of the reasons this 2004 film from writer Andrea Gibb and director Shona Auerbach works as well as it does.

I checked out this film because the trailer appeared on a couple of DVDs I was watching last week and I have to applaud whoever put together the trailer for ""Dear Frankie"" because there was a key detail about Frankie (Jack McElhone) that they did not reveal.  I appreciate that, so you may find out about it elsewhere on these pages but I will follow suit in setting up the situation.

The situation is that Lizzie (Emily Mortimer) has been raising Frankie with the help of her mother, Nell (Mary Riggans).  All we really know about Frankie's father is that he is not on a cargo ship named the Accra, and we know this because while Frankie has been getting letters from his father, supposedly posted from ports of call from around the world (and with the appropriate stamps from other lands), it is Lizzie who has been writing the letters.  Of course Fate steps in and it turns out that there really is a ship named the Accra, and, you guessed it, it is coming to Glascow, Scotland, where Frankie lives.  A desperate Lizzie decides to hire a guy to play Frankie's dad, and the Stranger (Gerald Butler), applies for the job and takes it.

Now, at this point you know enough to have reasonable expectations as to what is going to happen in the rest of this movie, and for the most part you will find you are correct.  But there are some surprises along the way and you end up caring about the characters so you are rooting for the predictable things to happen, at least, for the good ones.  However, when the inevitable bad things start happening Gibb's script keeps doing some smart things and avoids the painful predictability that often sinks stories like this one.

Mortimer and McElhone invest their characters and their relationship with the requisite believability that really makes this movie work as far as I am concerned.  There is a strategic use of silences in this film as well, which is not only effective but also appropriate.  Butler went on to star in ""The Phantom of the Opera"" after doing this film, and as much as I thought he was wrong for that role (because he sings as more of a baritone than a tenor), he was perfect for this part and you can see why he is referred to as ""The Stranger.""  But beyond crediting the casting I go back to the script by Gibb or whoever was responsible for the decision to end ""Dear Frankie"" on the quiet moment that brings the film to a satisfactory and heartfelt conclusion.",1121299200,5,2884,4.444022770398482

The musical score is wonderful and the movie is short on dialogue so the visuals and music have a lot of impact.  A movie for the whole family.",1121299200,4,499,4.287234042553192
2267444,5,B00094AS9A,"I rented Dear Frankie because I thought the story was original and interesting. I have to admit that at first the heavy Scottish accents were somewhat overwhelming, but once I got into the flow of the film by mid-point I didn't even notice anymore. Now this says a lot about how engrossing this film is. Previous reviewers have written wonderfully detailed story outlines, so I'm not going to repeat what this film is all about...but I still felt the need to express what a pleasure it was to see Dear Frankie. The acting is beyond exceptional...Mortimer as the mom and McElhone as Frankie were extremely expressive and moving...I for one loved Gerard Butler as ""The Stranger"". There is one scene where they are walking on a dock and he and Lizzie (the mother) are having a conversation and Butler reacts to a very poignant statement...(one that had my hand over my mouth) and his reactions is priceless, it's perfect because it's not over the top. Moments such as this are what make seeing this film an unique experience. The quiet undertone of this film fit the story beautifully because it is about a deaf boy who is ultimately trying to have his voice heard, initially we hear his voice though his letters to his father, this is his mothers one form of communication with him, what she learns in the end is that if she would listen close enough she could hear his voice through those that he touches around him as well. This is why ""The Strangers"" role is played so understated, he's not meant to take over the situation, but to simply show Lizzie a new way of getting to know her son.",1121126400,11,1589,4.578947368421052

I can't help but burst into tears when she was sitting in the dark at the beach all alone, wondering how can she protect her little son's dream...Emily showed a great combination of vulnerability and strength, as a single monther and a domestic violence victim.

2267448,5,B00094AS9A,"I was glad that this film finally came out in DVD, because I couldn't see it dued to it's limited release. I really wanted to see Gerard Butler in this film, because I loved his portrayal of The Phantom in The Phantom of the Opera. I am a little disappointed that while his role is so touching and wonderful, he's not the lead. This movie belongs to Emily Mortimer and Jack McElhone. They played struggling mother and son, and their performances are so ""tearjerking""!

Lizzie(Mortimer) lives with her mother Nell(Mary Riggans) and a 9 year old son Frankie(McElhone) who became deaf many years earlier as a result of physical abuse by her no-good ex-husband. Frankie doesn't know the truth about his absent father, and his mother pretends to be the father writing letters to Frankie from other countries. Frankie gets bullied at school, and he's hoping that his Da would come home soon. Then Lizzie starts to go out to bars in hoping to find an ideal man to pretend to be Frankie's father for a day. She meets the handsome sailor(Butler) who reluctantly agreed to help her, and he had to read some of the letters so he could be convincing when he meets Frankie.

Frankie was so happy to see his ""father"" for the first time, and they spend a day on the beach and had a great time. The sailor was so moved by the affection of Frankie and insisted on playing the role for a few extra days. Lizzie and the sailor also connected to each romantically, even though he had to make his departure soon. Just when Lizzie thought she was making her life better, her bed-ridden ailing ex-husband wants to be involved in Frankie's life again. Can Frankie face the secrets and lies kept by her mother?

Emily Mortimer was mesmerizing in numerous scenes, especially when she reveal the truth about Frankie's life to the sailor, and then breaking down emotionally. I also enjoyed the moments shared between Frankie and the sailor. I found that the accent spoken in this movie is very authentic and strong that I had to turn on the subtitles in order to know all the lines being delivered.

Gerard Butler and Emily Mortimer both do a tremendous job in this film, both deserving of an Oscar nomination at the very least.

2267480,5,B00094AS9A,"DEAR FRANKIE is one of those rare films that tell a story (by Andrea Gibb) with such minimal extraneous effects, keeping the line of the tale clear and unfettered by bathos, and results in an emotional experience for the viewer that creates a sense of empowerment and utter commitment.  While much of this effect is due to the extraordinary talent of director Shona Auerbach (who also is the film's magical cinematographer!) and by the glorious musical score by Alex Heffes, this film boasts one of the finest casts assembled for a small movie.

Lizzie (Emily Mortimer) is an itinerant resident of various towns in Scotland, living with her 9 year old deaf ('he's a gifted lip reader!') son Frankie (Jack McElhone) and her cranky, endlessly smoking mother Nell (Mary Riggans): they travel to short-time stays to escape discovery by Lizzie's abusive husband Davey (Cal Macaninch).  Out of love for Frankie, Lizzie has 'created' a father who is a sailor and always at sea and corresponds with Frankie through letters Lizzie herself writes and mails. Though Lizzie feels a bit guilty at carrying on this beneficent deceit and Nell is angered at her daughter's game, Frankie is happy knowing his father is a brave seaman who writes to him constantly.

One of Frankie's new schoolmates Ricky (Sean Brown) hears that Frankie's dad's ship is soon to anchor in their town and, supposing that Frankie doesn't have a real father,  makes a wager with Frankie that his father won't show.  Frankie accepts, tells his mother, and Lizzie panics, deciding to find a stranger to pose for pay as Frankie's dad for a day.  Lizzie's friend Marie (Sharon Small) finds a man to fit the need for a stranger 'with no past, present, or future' (Gerard Butler) and the stranger consents to aid Lizzie's plight.  On the day of the ship's arrival, Lizzie arranges for the stranger to come to her flat to surprise Frankie. The intial meeting is quiet and phenomenally and subtlely touching.  Frankie and his 'Da' walk the streets, the seaside, the docks, attend Frankie's soccer game where Frankie is able to win the wager with Ricky, etc: slowly the stranger bonds with Frankie as sincerely as Frankie does with the stranger.  Lizzie softens, allows the stranger one more day posing as Frankie's dad, and in one of the most poetic doorway encounters ever produced on film, heals her emotional instability with the stranger.

The ending holds surprises and other luminous encounters, each of which allow us to see the transformation in each of the characters, all due to the power of love.  No Hollywood ending here, just an understated bit of reality that pulls strongly on the heartstrings - and few viewers can resist the pull.  The performance by Jack McElhone is astonishingly fine as is the work of Emily Mortimer and Gerard Butler.  The entire cast is committed to the vision of the director and the result is simply unforgettable.  Highly recommended for all audiences.  Grady Harp, July 05",1120694400,14,2969,4.896207584830339

2267482,5,B00094AS9A,"In a time of email, chatting, and text messaging, director Shona Auerbach transcends the power of written words on paper into an affectionate and poignant tale of a single parent's love for an only child.  The altruistic affection of Lizzie (Emily Mortimer) tries to accommodate a normal childhood for her deaf son, Frankie (Jack McElhone), while trying to provide a safe and nourishing upbringing for him.  Through this process she has created a father image for Frankie who always travels on the seven seas onboard the Accra.  The only means of communication between Frankie and his fictionalized father is through letters, which his mother secretively writes.

What Frankie does not know is who his real father is, as Lizzie constantly tries with the help of her mother (Mary Riggans) to keep the secret alive through the made up sailor who provides Frankie with fatherly comfort.  The film opens with Frankie and Lizzie preparing for a move to a Glasgow.  In Glasgow, Frankie gets into trouble with a kid called Ricky (Sean Brown), who first tries to pick on him for being deaf, but Frankie is way too smart for a bully such as Ricky.  However, Ricky continues to pester him and reveals that Accra is coming to town.  This leaves Frankie slightly confused, as he does not understand why his father would not have told him.  Ricky tries to capitalize on his confusion by making a bet that his father is not coming to Glasgow.

It is with much agony and pain that the mother tries to find a way to save the day for Frankie, as she knows about the bet and how it would make him feel on his upcoming birthday as well.  Nonetheless, Lizzie comes up with a clever solution to hire a man to pretend to be Frankie's father, which would save Frankie's face and make him very happy.  Meanwhile, Frankie's real father's family has located them, and also desire to see Frankie.  This puts Lizzie under a very stressful situation, as she cannot run due to Frankie's pretend father's arrival while trying to hide the truth for him.

Initially Dear Frankie seems like a melodramatic story, but through Auerbach's attention to details and the minimal in each scene he raises the film far above average.  The success rests completely within simplicity where the appearance and action of the characters reveals far more than just a presence.  Every single character comes with words, but also actions consistent to their character.  Auerbach brings the audience's attention to the actions of the characters and not the words.  Furthermore, Frankie's deafness provides an analogy that suggests that what one see is more important than what one hears.  In the scene where Lizzie visits the real father the audience can also see his actions, see him speak for himself, and see why Lizzie left him in the first place.

The many symbols within the film that come into play such as the letters, ship, deafness, and several others trigger reflexively thoughts that help driving the story in the right direction.  In addition, one cannot forget to mention the cast's wonderful performances, as they brought out the necessary elements of human interaction and affection.  Together these two are incorporated through clever scene framing that implement the mise-en-scene with a simplistic, yet inspiring intentions to provide a comprehensive view of a mother's zealousness to offer her son nurturing and affectionate care.",1120348800,14,3398,4.934973637961336

I particularly loved the supporting characters and the remarkable locations.  As Americans, we rarely get such a telling glimpse into Scottish life and I was mesmerized.

Gerard Butler was perfectly cast as The Stranger.  It is an extremely restrained role compared to the romantic heroes he has played and will be playing in the future (The Phantom, Attila, romantic lead in Tomb Raider2 and the upcoming Beowulf and Burns) but he brings it off superbly.  He is an exceptionally fine natural actor, completely fresh and unspoiled, and I cannot wait to see him reach global stardom.

The ending is surprising and leaves one hoping that a brief revelation near the ending will open the door for the future. I think the big distributors really flubbed up by not picking up this movie.

2267488,5,B00094AS9A,"I first heard of this film when I rented another video, and Dear Frankie was in the previews. I looked in my local newspaper to see when it would be coming out but after a few months, I gave up. Then the day of my birthday as I was skimming through the Today section of my newspaper, I saw an add for it. So I went to go see it with my mother. I can honestly say, it is one of the best movies that I've seen. The characters are down to earth and can easily be related to. The set was not distorted by any Hollywood gimics, rather, it looked like any small town in Scotland. The storyline was not overly sappy. It had exactly the right amount of all of the elements which make a good movie.  The acting was superb.

2267489,5,B00094AS9A,"It may sound like a biased opinion for a single mother to write a review about a movie that portrays the life struggles for a single mother with the goal to find a father figure worthy of her child's affections.  However, I feel that anyone with a heart could relate to this movie.  It was a touching movie, one that had the ability to leave a lasting impression on the viewer long after they saw the movie.  Gerard (Gerry) Butler played the amazing portrayal of ""The Stranger"".  One cannot help but fall in love with his character.  And Emily Mortimer, who played ""Lizzie"" did a bang-up job as a single mother who wants to protect her child from heartache.

I feel that this movie is one that Hollywood needs to embrace... especially since most major motion pictures seem to focus on sex, violence and graphic dark images to bring in 'box office bucks'.  This is a movie that will pull at your heart strings, but give you a warm fuzzy feeling and a sense of renewal once you leave the theater or turn off your DVD player.

Watch this movie if you are sick of the demoralized motion pictures that are all hyped-up by Hollywood's Daddy Warbucks of motion pictures... because Dear Frankie will renew your faith in the ""little"" independant film industry's ability to tell a meaningful story.",1117324800,10,1288,4.593886462882096
2267508,5,B00094AS9A,"Many people have figured out that some low-budget films are as good as any expensively advertised films--even better. Well, Dear Frankie is one of them.

  Starring a hugely talented Emily Mortimer as Frankie's mom, Lizzie, the film follows a family around that constanly has to move, because of the fear that Frankie's estranged father will show up and take him away. As Lizzie puts it in the movie, ""Frankie wasn't born deaf. It was a gift from his daddy."" However, Lizzie wants to protect her son from his disturbing past, and tells him his dad is on a boat. She has him write letters to his ""dad"", and then reads and answers them herself. This is not, however, a sob story for a unfortunate deaf boy. Frankie is perfectly fine being the way he is, and others are at ease around him, because he is happy.

  Anyway, one day, Frankie reads that the boat that his father is supposedly on is coming to a dock very near to his house. His friend bets him his father will not visit, and Lizzie decides to do something about it. She meets a Stranger (Gerard Butler) and he agrees to be Frankie's father. The story unfolds from there beautifully, but I won't spoil it; you have to see the movie!!

  I admit, the reason I wanted to see this movie was because the spectacular Gerry Butler was in it! And fans of his, you will be very pleased if you see him in this movie. But everyone and everything about this movie is what really kept it in my memory. It is easy to tell that it truly came from all the actor's hearts, and this really pays off. So, instead of seeing a high budget movie, please, do a favor for yourself and find Dear Frankie. You won't be disappointed.",1117152000,11,1665,4.37987012987013

Performances were top shelf and everything, including the music, worked well with the scenery, the climax and the ending of this film.

Suitable for children who would enjoy and understand the yound child's compelling drive to know his father.

From the wonderful, haunting piano music at the beginning to the final credits, it was a thoroughly enjoyable movie.  The story has been described elsewhere.  I will just say that all the actors gave phenomenal performances.  I had never seen Emily Mortimer before, but she was great.  Gerard Butler has to be one of the most underrated actors today.  He can express more with facial expressions and his eyes than most actors can with their whole bodies and loads of dialogue.  The young actors were all good.  I especially like Frankie's little girl friend.  The Scottish locations were  picturesque and evocative.

2267513,4,B00094AS9A,"Dear Frankie is the kind of family drama that keeps you in suspense.  Young Frankie doesn't know his estranged father at all, but he receives letters he believes from his father on a ship, and sends replies.  His mother has been secretly sending the letters and intercepting the replies, thinking it's better for Frankie to believe he has a loving but absent dad, than to know the truth about his abusive real father.  Her intentions are good, but the ship name she made up leads Frankie to believe he will soon see his father when the ship is in port.  Instead of  finding a way to level with him gently, before he finds out by surprise, she tries to find a way to continue the deception.  So far it sounds like the plot for a sitcom episode, but the acting, writing, and what ever else it takes, are done so well we really don't want to see Frankie's heart broken, and start to root for the mom to pull it off.  The phony dad she hires turns out to hit it off with Frankie, but she learns his real father is dying in the hospital while Frankie and the phony dad are having a good time.  She now has a bit of a moral dilemma - is it ethical and / or kind to let Frankie be happy with the deception, even if that means it will be too late for him to ever see his real dad?

I don't want to give away the end but unfortunately (?) they don't thoroughly explore the possible negative consequences; on the other hand the result is an overall uplifting film that will touch your heart.",1115510400,4,1481,4.204946996466431
2267514,5,B00094AS9A,"I was hooked from the piano melody under the opening credits.  Lovely, and as the film progresses, the  music makes a quiet statement about what we are experiencing on the screen.

Emily Mortimer as the Mother who will do almost anything to protect and nurture her child; and Gerard Burtler, as the Stranger she hires to pretend to be her sons father 'for just one day' are outstanding.  With their eyes, body language, understated gestures, they portray more meaning and emotion than 9 out of 10 actors working today.

The story is of a mother who has been writing letters pretending to be her sons sailor father on a journey to far off ports on a ship called the Accra, a name she made up.  Now, the real Accra is to arrive in the seaside village they live in and she must find a man to pretend to be the father 'for just one day.'  The interview between Mortimer and Butler is outstanding.  Very few words, but we understand the desperation of the woman, and the disinterest but decency of the man.

The boy is played to perfection by Jack McElhone.

This is a quiet, heartfelt, gem of a film and I am glad I went across town to see it after hearing about it for months.  The DVD will be in my collection.  9/10",1114041600,38,1214,4.346666666666667

2267516,4,B00094AS9A,"Lizzie (Emily Mortimer), the single mother of a 9 year old deaf mute boy, Frankie (Jack McElhone), moves her family to a tiny family in Glasgow. Her mother, Nell (Mary Riggans) announces that if they move again, it will be the last time for her. As Frankie acclimates to his new school, his mom continues about her routine. She travels by bus to a post office box and retrieves the letters that Frankie writes to his dad,  a sailor that has been traveling around the world for years. She writes the letters back to her son, pretending to be the long missing father, purchasing stamps from around the world, concocting fictional travels and making up the name of his father's boat. One day, Frankie learns that his father's boat is due to dock at the Port of Glasgow. Immediately, he has doubts that his father will even want to see him. Lizzie decides to try to hire someone to play his father. Her friend, and boss, Marie (Sharon Small) helps her find ""Davey"" (Gerard Butler, he also played the Phantom in ""The Phantom of the Opera""). Davey is hired to spend one day with Frankie, `before he has to ship out again'. Growing attached to the boy, he offers to spend another day with mother and son.

""Dear Frankie"", a new Scottish film directed by Shona Auerbach, is a really great little gem that you should definitely seek out. Playing at a handful of independent theaters, it will slowly roll out to the rest of the country. If you are unable to find it at a theater, catch the DVD when that is released.

The beauty of ""Frankie"" is that every character seems real, like someone you might meet on the streets of Glasgow. Emily Mortimer plays Lizzie as a young, single mom who has had a hard life. Her one joy is her son, who is very intelligent, but a deaf mute. Because of the circumstances or her life, which we slowly learn as we watch the film, Lizzie has become withdrawn and feels she can only rely on her mom and son. When she meets Marie, she is reluctant to begin a friendship. But Marie realizes that Lizzie needs the friendship and offers her a part time job at the local chip shop and helps her in other ways. Her mother is a woman that has had her equal share of hard times, but she is trying to get her daughter out of the funk she is living in while protecting them at the same time. Little Frankie is also played in a very natural way by Jack McElhone. In films, children tend to be too precocious or too `adult'. Frankie is neither. As we learn more about him, we see that he is intelligent, shy, interested in a girl in his class and easy to bait into bets by another young boy in his class. His very existence and the letter writing have ensured that he will have an active imagination. But his mother has also helped him develop a strong interest in sea life and all other aquatic areas. Naturally, a little boy who has never met his father but receives regular letters from him will do whatever he can to learn more about his father's world. The walls of Frankie's room are lined with hand drawn pictures of sea life, a map of the world with pins marking the locations of each of his father's letters and more.

The part of `Davey' is a difficult one to pull off. Butler brings an air of desperation to the character in the beginning. I mean, why else would a grown man agree to portray a kid's dad for a day, for probably 20 pounds, except that he is desperate for cash. As he spends time with Frankie, he realizes what a great kid he is. Thankfully, the emotions aren't `big' like they might be in a Hollywood film. He comes to this realization slowly. At the end of the day, when he asks Frankie and his mom to spend the next day with him, it makes sense. We believe that `Davey' has actually grown fond of Frankie.

The key to this film is that everything is believable and natural. Nothing is played for theatrics or over the top emotion.

As the film winds to it's natural climax, we begin to feel the emotion that the characters are feeling and this makes the story all the more powerful and moving.",1113264000,165,4029,4.351063829787234
2267517,5,B00094AS9A,"I loved this movie!  The story behind Dear Frankie unfolds beautifully.  Lizzie (the mother), Frankie (the deaf boy) and The Stranger (hired to be Frankie's father) are the three main characters in this heartwarming tale of unselfish love.  Emily Mortimer is perfectly cast as a mother trying to protect her son.  I found Gerard Butler's portrayal of The Stranger most interesting.  What begins as a business deal for this lonely seaman develops into a relationship with the boy, and then, through the boy, a relationship with his mother.  All of the characters in this movie are well-developed.  There is a surprise ending.  It may bring a tear to your eye - but it is not sad or maudlin.  As I said at the outset, I loved this movie.",1113004800,6,735,4.6796875
2267528,5,B00094AS9A,"Because DEAR FRANKIE is a limited release, many of us have to drive a while to find a theater that is showing it. The 25 mile drive I took was completely worth it.

Emily Mortimer plays Lizzie, who has been writing letters under the guise of her estranged husband to her deaf son, Frankie, for years. In writing the letters many things are accomplished. Frankie gets to feel like he has some contact with his dad and Lizzie gets to hear the innermost thoughts and wishes of her son through the letters she reads and answers.

When Lizzie, Frankie, and grandma Nell arrive in a new town, they befriend Marie. They also learn that the Accra--the ship on which Frankie thinks his dad lives--is docking near their town. With Marie's help, Lizzie encounters ""The Stranger"" and pays him to pretend to be Frankie's dad for one day.

Now I have seen a couple of critics find fault in casting Gerard Butler as The Stranger, thinking him too cold and gruff for the role. If these critics had watched the movie closer, they would've seen that the role called for gruffness at the beginning. However, Frankie has the same affect on The Stranger as he has on everyone else--making people want to be better and thawing out their chilly dispositions.

By the end of the movie everyone has learned something. Frankie has learned some truths through his mother and discovered others on his own. Lizzie learns to open up to others a little more. We learn who The Stranger actually is and, though we don't know anything about his past, we know that he has probably been emotionally shut down for a long time.

Like many, I went to see it because I wanted to see Gerard Butler, but I can honestly say that once the movie started (and he doesn't appear until about 45 minutes into the film) I was so engrossed in the story that the original reason didn't even exist anymore.

I have never seen Emily Mortimer in a film before (except her tiny part in Notting Hill,) but I was very impressed with the heart and realism that she brought to her role, as well as the actress who played her mother. Young Jack McElhone was especially impressive. You could see why his mother wanted to protect him so much and you could understand why The Stranger wanted to extend the time he spent with him.

Critic Roger Ebert mentioned a scene in a doorway with Lizzie and The Stranger. He talked about the way a powerful scene does not need a lot of dialogue. I watched especially for that scene and completely agreed with his comments on its profundity. This was a beautiful film and I'm so glad that I saw it. It was sweet, simple, real, and powerful in many ways. It was the kind of film that will stay with you for several days.

2267530,5,B00094AS9A,"This is one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen. The acting is brillant, location is awesome and the story is truly one of a kind.

As the film begins your mind goes into many different levels of wonders. Like why does Mother move her son to different places, why a son writes to a Father he has never met and what is the connection. As in real life, many parents can hurt a child, but never knows the true damage of what they have done.

Lizzie (Emily Mortimer) protects her child the only way she knows how, by running. Vowing to never let his Father see him again. Frankie (Jack McElhone) who is deaf, not only misses his Dad, but writes to him often. Hoping one day that his Dad will come home. When a friend at school shows him an articles of the exact ship coming into port in the same city that Frankie lives. When Lizzie finds out this information, she must decide what to do to cover all the steps she has taken to protect her son. She decides to hire a Dad for the day by a ""stranger"" (Gerard Butler). As stranger comes with no past, no present and no future, he begins to befriend Frankie as a true Father, he becomes attached not just to Frankie, but to Lizzie as well.

This story will pull at your most emotional heart strings, you will laugh and cry. I believe this is for everyone who have had difficult situation like this or not. It is a true joy and should be watch more than once.",1112832000,9,1409,4.191881918819188

In a film where words are practically unnecesssary I find it almost impossible to think of the proper words to describe it.  The director,Shona Auerbach, who is also the director of photography, displays a subtle touch throughout -  from the colorscape of the Scottish seaside, to the development of the characters, to the way that the 3 main characters interact and ultimately transform one another's lives.  Emily Mortimer is lovely and believable as Lizzie, the young mother desperate to protect her deaf son from the truth of his father, and equally desperate to ""hear his voice"" through the letters he writes to the seaman father she's created for him.  Jack McElhone as Frankie is far from a maudlin child with a disability.  He is filled with curiousity and intelligence and humor despite his vagabond existence with his mom and grandmother.  Gerard Butler as the unnamed Stranger hired by Lizzie to play dad-for-a-day is incredible in what he is able to convey just through small gestures and his amazing eyes.  My favorite scene in the film is of The Stranger's face as seen through a fish tank as he watches young Frankie.  The transformation that comes over the character in this quiet moment says more than 10 pages of dialogue could ever have done.  The beautiful music is well-suited to the whole mood of the movie - bringing to mind a gently moving river that takes you on a family's journey from fear of the past to hope for the future.",1112745600,7,1521,4.752851711026616

2267536,5,B00094AS9A,"The people who made this gem of a film have every right to be proud of it.  It's a beautiful story, told in a very restrained and effective way. It's wonderfully crafted artistically, and the performances are all just excellent.

Much of the story is not told through the dialogue, but rather through visual images, bits of Scottish scenery that only someone who lived there would know, and through the expressions that flow across the faces of the actors. Although Shona Auerbach didn't get gimmicky about it at all, I had a sense that she wanted us to get a little feel for just how much Frankie (the title character is a deaf boy) could know what was going on, just by seeing the expressions of the people around him.

For example, there's a lovely moment where, just by the way the characters chew on bits of candy, you can read volumes about what they are thinking and feeling.  In a later scene, Lizzie (the mom) reveals something shocking and painful about Frankie's history (I won't say what). There is a very long moment where the stranger doesn't say a word, but in that long moment there is this incredibly complex parade of emotions that comes across his face, from shock, to pity, to sorrow, to anger, and then to a profound respect. It's a powerful, pivotal moment in the film, and Auerbach and her cast handle it brilliantly.

Emily Mortimer (Lizzie) easily sidestepped all the cliches that could have come into her role, playing this mom who has been deeply wounded, who has a HARD time trusting anyone or anything, but who is despite herself wearing her heart on her sleeve. You care about this woman and you champion her cause, even though even she knows that she's doing all the wrong things.

Jack McElhone (Frankie) takes a kid who could be just a little TOO perfect, and makes him believable and real. He is a remarkable find and I look forward to seeing what he does next.

As for Gerard Butler (the stranger), I think this is the best work he's done to date. He's already demonstrated uncanny versatility in other roles, and I had been thinking that he has the stuff to become a top-notch actor, given some better opportunities and the right challenges. His work here proves that he already IS a remarkable actor - not only one of the most talented working at this time, but also one of the most SKILLED.

The story itself is very simple, and in less skilled hands, it could have been overly sentimental.  As handled here, it is memorable and very, very dear.  And for the record, I studied and worked in theatre for several years, so I know a little about the level of artistry that is showcased here.

I ran into this film by accident, looking for something new, as I had seen most everything of worth ever made (yes, I am that old).It was a recommendation on someone's list, which also included some low budget romances I also recommend.

My first viewing caught me by surprise, for just like Othello, the audience soon realizes that the first act is at the end, and the reason we are there is told in the ensuing acts. This is a slow and deliberate presentation, and if any criticism can be leveled, it is because the three people opening the play are so ordinary, just like us. It is only in the development that we see how extraordinary the common person can be.

Should you continue watching the film to the end, which a number of one-star givers did not do, you are in for a subtle and endearing surprise, full of tenderness and the possibility of real romance.",1517529600,,1289,4.543103448275862
