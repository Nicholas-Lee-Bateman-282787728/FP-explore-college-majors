So what about the film? Made in 1962 it was the first essentially Slovak film that took full advantage of the Communist relaxation on censorship. As such it was not only groundbreaking but also highly inspirational, but to see why that is this has to be viewed in context of when it came out.

The plot involves a photography obsessed student Fayolo, he lives in a grim apartment block in Bratislava. One of his neighbours is fifteen year old Bela. They spend time on the roof where their neighbours continue to grow a forest of aerials for the new television sets that are accumulating. Bela has to share the caring of her blind mother with her younger brother and deal with her belligerent father. Meanwhile Fayolo's dad wants him to do the `voluntary' summer work to enhance his own reputation with the Party. So after a teenage tiff with Bela he does just that and trundles off on the back of a tractor.

Once in the liberating mood of the less than `model' collective farm, he feels free to see another alluring young girl. Deep down he is still drawn to Bela whom he writes to, but she has started seeing someone else. So what will the future be on his return?

This is actually a hard story to sum up in a synopsis without giving the plot away. The whole point was that this was the `new wave' of Slovak cinema and that means the themes were the stars. Whether  the extra marital relations or the criticism of the harvest system. It is also filmed beautifully in black and white and has a sound track that is never in the background. The repetition of a door slamming and the constant recorder music can be grating, but they are there for a purpose and it all becomes clear.

This is as the layers of secrecy are slowly pulled away to reveal the web of ties and lies that link all the main players together and when it ends you are left wit the feeling of knowing you have seen something really rather good and very different. This will not be for everyone, but fans of new wave sixties cinema and history fans will find a rich vein to mine here, highly recommended.",1379635200,,2299,4.423167848699763
