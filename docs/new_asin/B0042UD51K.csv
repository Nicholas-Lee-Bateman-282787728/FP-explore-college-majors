8413968,5,B0042UD51K,"These performances offer some of the best music written by Friedemann Bach, magnificently played and also beautifully filmed. These were premiere performances and the artists rose to the challenge in making great music with them as well as history.

Perhaps the composer would not be nearly as obscure today if music of such quality had been available decades ago. Although this will most likely be heard by those who are W.F. Bach fans already, these four cantatas will convert many more who never heard the man's music before. The father's pride in the first son was well founded. In this disc we have proof of how very, very good Friedemann was.",1424995200,2,648,4.837837837837838
8413969,5,B0042UD51K,"I highly recommend this DVD as a visual, auditory and aesthetically pleasing delight.  Wilhelm Friedmann Bach, the little -performed son of J.S. Bach, deserves more hearing and there could be no better introduction than this performance.  A friend who recommended it to me said, ""It will knock your socks off"" and he was so right!",1407110400,,330,4.9818181818181815

Thanks to Bachchor Mainz, to L'arpa festante Munich, and especially to conductor Ralf Otto, for assembling and preparing this magnificent tribute to Bach's eldest son and his long-forgotten music.  With this outstanding production, every participant has brought us closer to one inventive, brilliant, and uniquely gifted musical genius.  I shed tears of joy to hear these sounds come alive again, after they were first conceived in the 1750s.
vielen Dank!",1404345600,,471,5.424657534246576
8413971,4,B0042UD51K,"This is so well performed on the musical side, and so well executed by video and audio recording engineers, it staggers the mind that record producers just keep churning out lifeless Verdi Requiems, Rigolettos (Rigoletti?), and other warhorses that have been overglutted on the shelves for 50 years already.  There are thousands of other composers and compositions that need to be heard, and can be (presumably) be done as well as this.

Now, that all said, this was obviously a ""spared no expense"" concert and recording.  So why o why do they cheap us out with zero subtitles?  Aren't subtitles an industry standard by now?  And please don't tell me the text and translation is included in the little booklet.  Who the heck wants to read a booklet while this gorgeous video is playing?  And they didn't even put the German and English text together in the booklet, they are several pages apart.  Sheesh!",1401494400,2,904,4.824675324675325
8413972,3,B0042UD51K,"How hard is it for the producers of this dvd to include subtitles on it? The performances are fine, but having to read the booklet and memorize the meaning of the words in order to fully enjoy them is a pain. The other option is to learn German...

8413973,5,B0042UD51K,"This DVD is a revelation; that W.F. Bach was a talented (if not very prolific) composer is not new, but the quality of these cantatas is, in my opinion, right up there with the best of his father's.  Add to this the fine singing, both choral and solo, the excellent instrumental playing, the beautiful church setting and acoustics, and top-notch camera work, and I would not hesitate to deem this one of the best DVDs of church cantatas I know of.  W.F. Bach's music is filled with thrilling counterpoint in the choral movements, and some of the arias, especially the slower ones, are truly beautiful.  W.F.'s difficult instrumental writing is handled with aplomb, with dangerous horn and trumpet parts (on baroque instruments) played with verve.  These cantatas also feature lovely flute and violin obbligato parts, and the bass player is especially put to the test (and passes with flying colors).  Highly recommended!",1296518400,9,920,5.026315789473684
