1) you are a big enough Superman that you simply must own it all, in which case, I'd recommend getting these in one of the larger collector's sets.
2) you want these for your collection along with ""Plan 9 From Outer Space,"" ""Manos: The Hands of Fate"" and more along those lines.

You can study these movies to see how they went wrong.  ""Superman III"" failed because people who don't understand Superman were allowed to make the exact movie they wanted to make.  ""Superman IV: The Quest For Peace"" failed because last minute budget cuts prevented people who truly did understand the character from making the movie they wanted to make.  Director Sidney J. Fury turned in a 135 minute cut of IV, and the studio recut the film and released one just under 90 minutes. If you are going to pay for ""Superman IV"" at all, pay for a version that includes the surviving deleted scenes so that you can have enough material for the story to actually make sense.",1385251200,,1035,4.543010752688172

Everybody knows that these are the worst movies in the Superman franchise, even people like me who have never seen the movie. So what the heck is up with the $11.67 pre-order price? The official Warner Bros. shop has their pre-order price as $6.59. Amazon should have their price at a lower amount. The only reason I would buy this DVD set would be to complete a collection, not because these are good movies that I need to own. I will wait for this to go under $5 before I even consider giving up my money for this.",1384646400,,683,4.253846153846154
