6965085,4,B00S91DMF2,"This is a great Adventure Time DVD if you don't own any others and are looking for something short amd sweet. It only has 8 episodes, which are repeats of other AT dvds. I ordered this not knowing what was on it, and sadly I already have  most of the episodes on other dvds, but this will make a nice addition to our ""car videos"" collection. To help others not make the same mistake I'm including a list of episodes:

The enchiridion
Card wars
What was missing
Mystery train
Slumber party panic
Too young
Trouble in lumpy space
Wizard battle",1458777600,2,541,4.4

6965128,5,B00S91DMF2,"This is a great little mini series within season 8.  My son and I watched this together and really enjoyed it.  The Islands mini series is a self contained story so packaging it this way makes sense and if you aren't planning on buying the full season at some point it's a good purchase. In my opinion these are the stronger episodes of the season anyway.  The extras are a little skimpy, but it definitely is cool to see the storyboard and concept art stuff.  If you love Adventure Time and you aren't planning on buying the full season, I highly recommend this.",1489190400,2,563,4.436893203883495

6965142,1,B00S91DMF2,It's my fault not Amazons's. I did not understand that it contained reproduction restrictions only for USA and Canada. So I bought a DVD that I could not reproduce. But Amazons's deal has been excelent.,1487980800,,202,4.8

8697785,5,B00S91DMF2,"If you're a fan of Adventure Time, this is a good addition to your collection. I love the collections DVDs the show makes because it has a storyline/ consistency whereas watching the shows episodes in order kind of makes no sense at times...Bargain price, great quality, and Prime shipping availability.",1509321600,,303,5.08

8697790,4,B00S91DMF2,Bizarre even for AdventureTime but fun.,1497657600,,39,5.666666666666667
8697791,4,B00S91DMF2,"...before you make any decisions. SPOILER CITY! The first time through, the first few episodes seemed like filler. Not much happened and there weren't many laughs (although this series has grown dour of late). The ""...and possibly BMO"" joke from the title song doesn't make much sense as he's in every episode. The back of the case promises ""robo-dolphins,"" but they are literally just on screen for two seconds and have nothing to do with anything. And the ""ocean size"" of special features, like most Adventure Time disc special features, are underwhelming, there aren't very many, and they are not really worth watching. The first episode sets up the journey and is okay. The second is them on the journey and getting to the islands  nothing too interesting happens. The third one they get to the islands and kind of wander around and the same with the fourth, but on another island. Throughout this time, Finn is learning a little about humans but nothing interesting or worth the trip. He even meets real humans, but they're weird and they bail. Episode five is where it gets good! You learn all about Susan Strong. In six you learn all about Finn's parents. In seven he meets his mom and real humans. And the eighth is a real tear-jerker they all leave a little wiser. Well, not Jake and BMO.

Now rewatch it. You see little inklings of what is to come. And there are small jokes and Easter eggs that you'll notice as well. Then you'll sit back and be like, ""you know what? Not too shabby. I'd watch it a third time.""",1496534400,,1522,4.591911764705882
