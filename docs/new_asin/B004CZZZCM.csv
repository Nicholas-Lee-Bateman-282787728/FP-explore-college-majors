In other words, if THE GODFATHER skipped, they'll give the movie one star, but... Here goes... This DVD is blank. That's right... Blank. As in, Amazon is selling a movie with no movie on it. IT comes up as saying, on my computer, You Have Inserted A Blank DVD. So alas I wasn't able to see a movie with THE NEPHEW FROM UNCLE (MAN younger) and Merry Anders, whom I just turned onto after having watched AIR PATROL where she falls in love with my friend Bob Dix and also HYPNOTIC EYE. Anyhow, yeah, this movie's blankola, and I reported it and it should be off the market soon and what a bummer, I really wanted to see a young Merry Anders, she's a fox.",1468540800,,748,4.2377622377622375

8424626,5,B004CZZZCM,"This movie is actually quite entertaining. As the trailer says, it is a story of the ""Get Lost"" Generation.  Robert Vaughn stars, doing his best impression of James Dean. It is basically a tale of three young men, none of whom are very likable.  They eventually decide that all their problems can be solved by robbing a supermarket.  The female characters, played by Dorothy Green, Merry Anders, Kathy Nolan, and Sara Selby, all innocently provide the motivation for the  three ""rebellious youth"" to commit their desperate acts.  Dorothy Green is quite beautiful and sexy as the college professor having an affair with her former student, Vaughn. ""No Time to be Young"" will keep you interested right up to the exciting climax.

Also, this remastered DVD provides an excellent quality picture.

I recommend this movie, as long as it is taken only as an example of how Hollywood portrayed rebellious young people in the 1950s.",1324771200,5,924,4.961038961038961
