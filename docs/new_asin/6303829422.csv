731243,5,6303829422,"This is one of the odder films of the 70's.  Odd, in that it seems a pre-curser to the execrable eighties.  For some reason, Carrie Nye's brief appearance is memorable, perhaps because she wasn't acting. Burton and Taylor have far greater performances on film yet this one reduces them to what they may have been like when the cameras were off.  Drama queens, a tad tired, but none the less, fascinating to watch.",1190678400,,413,4.63013698630137
731244,2,6303829422,"I remember seeing this on TV waaay back in 1973.  I was a senior in

high school and it bored me to death!  I recently found it for $1. in my

local Target store and thought ""Hey, I'm older and wiser now, maybe I'll

enjoy it more.  And it IS Burton and Taylor, so how bad could it be?""

Well, watching it for a second time was no better.  Liz and Dick both

look fantastic, and each has some fine moments.  But this garbage is so

dated and melodramatic it should have been called ""The Burtons' Tribute

To Bad Daytime Television"".  Seriously, this is one of the worst-written

things I've ever seen.  A total bore, and not even ""So bad it's good"".

Liz spews lines like ""Beat me black and blue...but don't LEAVE me!"" and

""If I slit my throat, would you pay ATTENTION to me?"" Burton, on the

other hand endures (and forces us to endure) endless dull scenes with his

business partners.  Who cares?  Seriously, I'm sure they were aiming for

something different than the average TV movie, but this thing STINKS. I'm

giving it two stars because it was fun seeing the Dynamic Duo at the

height of their star power.  Don't waste your time!",1173657600,4,1139,4.360576923076923

731246,2,6303829422,"The real-life first marriage of the two stars is nearing its own point of divorce during the creation of this torpid film, the last wherein Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor are teamed, and this provides probably the only reason for watching what is at best an exercise in costly kitsch. Produced by the Welsh National Network, HTV Harlech, the work scripted by John Hopkins was made for television to be seen on consecutive evenings, ostensibly presenting first the standpoint of Burton's character Martin Reynolds and latterly that of Taylor's part -his wife Jane - as their 18 year marriage decomposes. As presented, the two seem to have agreed upon the general causes of the passage of events, as there is little variance between any of the scenes supposedly contemplated separately by the married pair and a lack of posture from the scriptor becomes a fatal flaw for the narrative. A large portion of the picture involves Martin's relationship with his employer, and since this requires continual global travel, marital strain ensues, with this intended ancillary plot regarding his career choice becoming the trunk of the scenario, in stead of the union between Martin and Jane. Director Waris Hussein has a less than marvelous assignment in eliciting meaningful performances from Burton and Taylor, disastrously failing at it although Burton's innate intensity gives some life to most of his scenes despite the too often fatuous dialogue around which he seems too weary to ad lib. The excellent Italian actor Gabriele Ferzetti smoothly deals with a pallid part as Jane's latest lover, Carrie Nye emotes outrageously as the ""other woman"" and Barry Foster does well as Martin's sturdy adjutant, but we are never really shown why the couple's marriage is ending, a point not adequately addressed by scattershot plotting.",1127952000,2,1826,5.172297297297297
731247,4,6303829422,"Much like the dialogue in so many bad marriages, the script for this 1973 TV mini-series does not flow well, and is often strained, with awkward passages; it is nevertheless fascinating to watch Burton and Taylor battle each other, these fabulous on and off screen lovers, both experts in the chaos of divorce, having done so twice with each other, not to mention a few  others.

Burton plays a businessman who is uncommunicative and aloof, and Taylor is his wife who will do anything to get his attention, until the relationship becomes almost sado-masochistic, with its manipulative games...as she tells him at one point, ""it's no fun behaving badly if you're not going to punish me"".

The story fluctuates between the present to flashback memories, with occasional fuzzy continuity, but since there is little plot, and this is a tale of emotions gone wrong, it doesn't affect the film.

The beauty of Taylor's face is breathtaking, but not all of Edith Head's gowns are flattering, which I found rather peculiar, as some actually accentuate certain out-of-shape elements in Taylor's figure that could have been easy to disguise.

Burton looks very dapper and immensely attractive, with his powerful, gorgeous voice.

Both give terrific performances, though by no means on the level of the '66 ""Whose Afraid of Virginia Woolf ?"".  Others in the cast include Carrie Nye, and Barry Foster, and it also stars the city of Rome, with some beautiful vistas of the Eternal City.

It is interesting that in one scene, there is a newspaper with the headline ""London Arab Terror Alert"", which was a top story just a few weeks ago, proving that headlines, like the games played in dreadful relationships, go 'round and 'round, as if caught in a web of madness.

Total playing time of this Part 1 (taken from the man's perspective) of the mini-series is 75 minutes (Part 2 is from the woman's perspective); this film is now in public domain, and there are some cheap versions available, which are a little washed out in color.",1112140800,17,2016,4.871345029239766
731248,4,6303829422,"""Divorce His; Divorce Hers"" would be a much better film if it were trimmed from three to two hours.  In this effort, T.V. producers attempt to milk the then world shaking coup of nabbing the Burton's for a two-night event (Their first Movie made for television). But the cow ran dry at two hours.
 The story of a crumbling marriage is told first from the husband's point of view and then in the second half is told from the wife's. Much of the same ground is covered twice and much more interestingly in the second half.
  Jane and Martin Reynolds live La Dolce Vita in Rome in the early 70's and after 18 years come to the slow and painful end of their marriage. Rome looks wonderful in the location shots in the Borghese Gardens, along the Via Condotti at night, and Piazza Navona. And attendant with the glamour of Rome the aura of the Burtons is well served in making the Reynolds seem impossibly rich. Notice that Elizabeth wears her Krupp diamond and the famous La Peregrina Peal necklace. No successful business tycoon of Burton's character's income could have afforded such lux baubles for his wife. Still in the early 70's the Liz and Dick glamour machine must be well oiled and the public at the time expected it.  Some degree of disbelief would be suspend in anticipation of the Burtons because we somehow felt that what we were seeing less a drama than a simi-documentary about Elizabeth and Richard. And perhaps in some ways those films were just that.
  Richard Burton's performance is somewhat stiff and cool with flashes of Welsh temper to pepper his scenes. But, over all, he seems rather distant and not too interested in the proceedings.
  But on the other hand Elizabeth's excellent training in film acting over the years by the masters at M.G.M. comes to her aid in creating a warm fully developed and wonderful lady in Jane.  She shines in particular in her scenes with the children and in her scene with Carrie Nye when she learns of Miss Nye's relationship with her husband.  She is missed when she is not on hand to bring a little life to Mr. Burton's scenes. Miss Taylor shimmers in her own inimitable way and once again shows new comers and old pro's what real screen acting is about.
  The film is by no means great but not nearly as bad as some reviewers would lead you to believe. ""Divorce His: Divorce Hers"" is worth seeing for Elizabeth's solid work.",1071619200,31,2382,4.576470588235294
731249,3,6303829422,"This little-known film was Burton and Taylor's first (and only) foray into the ""made for TV"" genre. Originally airing in 1973 on two successive nights on ABC, the movie is actually rather interesting and not especially dated. Burton achieves the rare feat of *not* overacting, and in fact, sleepwalks throughout most of the movie. Still, this is one of his better performances, devoid of his usual theatrical screaming, ranting and raving. Elizabeth Taylor is bloated and overweight (and clearly unhappy), but is still amazingly beautiful, at the age of 41.
The movie is divided into two separate movies, with the ""Divorce His"" section infinitely superior to the Liz section, which is boring beyond belief. The Liz segment also repeats many sequences already aired in the Burton first hlf of the movie, though filmed with a different camera. Interesting technique, but one knows why it was only utlized on this one movie!
Burton looks magnificent here, thin, relatively sober and quite striking. No doubt he and Liz made a fabulous-looking couple. This was filmed just a year before their first divorce and remains an interesting piece.",1056412800,13,1136,5.145945945945946

The Divorce His part contains numerous flashback scenes from the husband's viewpoint. Before a flashback, Burton's character goes into a zone, then the flashback begins. I found the flashbacks to be disruptive, like someone cutting into a conversation.

Divorce Hers(just like His) contains plenty of long, drawn-out(and overly dramatic) conversations. Liz Taylor's character spends plenty of time 'yelping' about her troubles.

7855620,1,6303829422,"Review of Divorce His, Divorce Hers
Hot Toasty Rag, July 19, 2017

At the time, it was fun to watch every Liz and Dick movie they made together, but knowing they were divorced in 1974, its not enjoyable to watch a movie in 1973 in which they play a couple in the midst of a terrible divorce. Id skip Divorce His  Divorce Hers if I were you.

This is one of those movies that pretty much takes place over the course of a few days, but constantly flashes back in time. Usually, I find that kind of story annoying, and this movie is no exception. Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton play a bickering, tired, estranged couple who are getting ready to finalize their divorce. Liz has custody of their three children, and each of them are in different stages in anger towards their father. But, none of the kids are particularly likable, so my heart was not tugged in their direction. Liz acts like an understudy; if this was the first movie of hers you saw youd think she was a lousy actress. Dick is plain cranky, like theyve filmed too many takes and he just wants to go home. The script is boring. The so-called surprises are hardly worth the build-ups, and the arguments lack fire, punch, and interest. The pace is slow, and its not even enjoyable for fans who wish an inside view of what went wrong with the famous couples marriages. The characters are obviously dissimilar to their offscreen personas. Just skip it. Watch Whos Afraid of Virginia Woolf? instead.",1500422400,,1462,4.53030303030303
