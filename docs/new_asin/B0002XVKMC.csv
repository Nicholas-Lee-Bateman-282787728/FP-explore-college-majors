2137235,1,B0002XVKMC,"Godawful tripe.

If Season 6 of Buffy did not convince you that Joss Whedon is past his prime, then this will convince you that he is already a has-been.

Once good actors are reduced to phoning in their parts.  SMG and AH look like they would rather be anywhere else.  And since when did show become all about Spike?

This was the lowest rated, most critically panned of all the seasons.  Easy to see why, the writing is inept, and too much focus is placed on nobodies like Spike and Andrew, not to mention a house full of redshirt potentials that Whedon seems to enjoy killing with the glee of  school boy around an ant hill.

Save you money. Save your time.",1093478400,19,660,4.352459016393443
2137236,5,B0002XVKMC,"I started watching Buffy when it first aired so many years ago and when I watched the finale episodes it was the end of a part of my life that I charished.

I grew up with Buffy.  We were the same age and both had problems with the difficult years of High School and College.  This show was not about Vampires or demons, it was about growing up and dealing with all the difficulties growing up brings.

If you had asked me three years ago if I thought that season 4 and on would ever be as good as the earlier seasons I would have told you that you were nuts.  But watching them now, after having lived a little more, and experienced some of the same problems, they are my favorites.

The final episodes were an amazing end to this show that touched so many young women and inspired them to be stronger woman, and individuals.  It didn't end with tragedy, but it didn't end in a fiary tale manner either.  It ended with a message to all woman, we are all strong, we are all slayers with the power to control our own destinies and to make our own paths and to effect change in the world that sometimes seems so insane and cruel.

I own all the other seasons and have looked forward to completing my collection.  This is it, unless there is a miracle and there is a Buffy movie of some kind.  All we can do is hope.

The Hardest thing in this world, is to live in it! - Buffy: season 5 finale, Dawn: Once more with feeling",1093392000,9,1420,4.142335766423358
2137237,5,B0002XVKMC,"Buffy the Vampire slayer Season Seven was one of the best seasons of it's whole run.  The show really went out with a bang, and not to mention the great timing.  Season seven has alot of key episodes and that's what makes it a very great season.  'Conversations with dead people' and 'Never leave me', are one of the many highlight eppies.  Although I thought the series ending should have been a 2 hour episode, it proves that there still maybe another spin-off, and with Angel's end it leaves a new light of what can happen in the near future.  A Andrew Spin-off or maybe even a Willow Spin-off.  I loved this season, and it sure makes us Buffy fans happy to know the show we've grown to love is still growing strong every moment of the day.

""So here's the part where you make a choice: What if you could have that power...now? In evry generation, one slayer is born... because a bunch of men who died thousands of years ago made up that rule. They were powerful men. This woman (points to Willow) is more powerful than all of the combined. So I say we change the rule. I say my power should be our power. Tomarrow Willow will use the essence of the sythe to change our destiny. From now on, every girls in the world who might be a slayer will be a slayer.  Every girl who could have the power will have the power... can stand up, will stand up.  Slayer... every one of us. Make your choice. Are you ready to be strong?""~ Buffy to the Potentials (Chosen)",1093392000,8,1457,4.288321167883212
2137238,5,B0002XVKMC,"Although I'm not one to write reviews of something not yet released, I couldn't help myself when it came to this particular dvd.  While not quite the shows best season, the final 22 episodes of Buffy the Vampire Slayer were none the less meant to become instant classics for the fans of the show.  We saw the high school rebuilt, Giles' return (on a more permanent basis), a final reunion between Buffy and Angel among other things.  Sure, we had to put up with the annoying potentials and some unresolved plot stuff, but it's Buffy!  This will probably be a bittersweet purchase for many since it heralds the end of a show that's been with us for so long, that has given us characters with whom we've grown up alongside with.  Well, better stop myself before I venture into sappy-land.  Enjoy this wonderful DVD!

The First: ""Ow, mommy, this mortal wound's all itchy.  Well, you came pretty close to smacking me down.  What more do you want?""

Buffy: ""I want you...to get out of my face.""",1093392000,12,989,4.568181818181818

2137240,3,B0002XVKMC,"Not my favorite season.

~*~SPOILERS!~*~

I didn't like how Spike went to all the trouble to get his soul back just to start killing again, even if he was under an evil influence.
The First (evil) wasn't all that scary or threatening.
Hardly any Giles. :-(

2137245,2,B0002XVKMC,"Cemented my hate for Dawn. Did she embody anything positive? Certainly not enough to balance all the negatives. Buffy has always been very annoying, but Dawn is repellent. I only preserve through the season when I get the urge to marathon all of them. While on the topic of negatives, Spike being crazy isn't so convincing, but better than mooning Spike of previous seasons. Otherwise, there's some good stuff in here. Very cool that Anya's troll boyfriend returned in a flashback  (though, oddly out of place in the episode, they got the original actor), and there is a refreshing lot of references to previous seasons and lots of new characters to fill oit the world - they're mostly disposable,  but it's nice, nonetheless.",1489968000,,726,4.894308943089431

2137279,4,B0002XVKMC,"This will be a different kind of review. I watched all of the seasons at a steady rate of two or three shows every evening. I can remember enjoying watching a few shows when they originally ran. So I decided to watch them all. It is a decent storyline with a Chosen One, a Slayer, who keeps the world safe from vampires and demons. Of course, one has to wonder about vampires and demons who don't live (live?) in California.

I believe the right place to end the tale was at the end of the season where Buffy sacrifices herself and dies. The next season, where Willow brings her back from death, was depressing. But eventually the Buffy I had come to know and like returned. The Buffy in Season Seven was a different Buffy for the last half of the season. The reasons for the negative changes were not obvious. Her fall from grace was contrived and unconvincing. Bringing Angelis in for a kissing cameo detracted from the Spike heroic sacrifice at the end.

I expected Buffy, Willow and Giles to die along with Spike. In retrospect my favorite characters were Willow, Zander, and Anya.

I rank the entire seven seasons highly and recommend them to anyone who likes a good story and has the time and patience to watch all seven seasons.",1455062400,2,1235,4.504464285714286

2137281,5,B0002XVKMC,"I didn't watch Buffy when it was originally on TV.  I caught an episode here or there, but I must have seen episodes from Season 1 or 2 because they weren't very good.  But this show got better and better as it went along, and Season 7 was terrific.  I've seen a lot of series finales, and most of them are bad.  Let's face it, it's not easy to end a 5+ season show in one episode.  The X-Files were great, but the finale was not.  Same with True Blood and many, many others.  But the finale to Buffy was about as good as one could hope for...great show, great season, great ending.",1454976000,4,582,4.097345132743363

2137347,5,B0002XVKMC,"Slowly rewatching the entire ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" series after last seeing it during the original run just reinforces what a great show this was.  It's heart-felt, poignant, thrilling, and full of characters that one wants to spend time with. Except for somewhat dated special effects in the earlier seasons, the show holds up remarkably well and the fantastic writing and acting makes most TV shows since look like a pretender to the throne. The season 6 ""Once More with Feeling"" episode is one of the best hours of television ever created, and many more episodes come close to that standard.

This show is on both Amazon Prime and Netflix, but the Amazon presentation is significantly better -- widescreen for the later seasons (although still 480p as far as I can tell). Netflix inexplicably only offers a 480p 4x3 presentation. So Amazon is a better choice for streaming.",1444953600,,881,4.945945945945946

2137423,4,B0002XVKMC,"Why are people fleeing from Sunnydale if the apocalypse is nigh? It's hard to understand exactly why this season's nemesis, the First root of all earthly evil, takes so long to level Buffy and the gang. The plot is totally 'out there' because it makes absolutely no sense that it would take an entire season for the First to get it in gear. Commence the evil all ready! It is fun to see all of the potential slayers come together as one dumb group of hormonal teen-aged girls. Although I felt like skipping a few episodes, this season compelled me to watch, longing for resolution and for the potentials to wise up.

I liked Spikes actions and was bawling at the end when he died. I did like that everyone came back even Faith (and I thought I would never say that!!) It brought everything in full circle.
And Willow WOW!! She gets more and more confidence and at the end she gets to goddess level! When they made all the girls in the world potential slayers I was smiling and yes crying. :S
The whole uproar about the whole Xander thing about his last sentence about Anya. I liked it I could see that he would say that, it's not like they are by her graveside and it wasn't a eulogy and yes she WAS stupid and careless.

2137464,5,B0002XVKMC,"Many Buffy fans dislike this seventh and final season. I know this firsthand, since I used to be one of them :) Somehow, though, it crept into my Buffy-loving heart, and the older I get, the more I find myself appreciating and enjoying this season. It's not as ""dark"" as season 6 or large stretches of season 5, yet it's arguably a little 'deeper' and more ambitious than the understandably beloved early seasons of the series. I can't claim that season 7 has the same amount of sparkle and charm as those earlier seasons, but I was so happily surprised to find that it really is wittier, more poignant and loaded with more interesting and thought-provoking themes than I had given it credit for. A lot of the main characters find some measure of healing and redemption in this final season, and a few of the new minor characters are surprisingly worthy additions. Oh, and for those Firefly fans who are first discovering Buffy, you might be interested to know that this is the season where Nathan Fillion appears as a chillingly misogynistic preacher.

There are a few clunkers this season but, honestly, that's true of every Buffy season for me. Overall, I find this more uplifting than the prior two seasons and loaded with some ideas and themes that age even better than some of what we get in earlier seasons. Is this the 'best' season of Buffy? No, but it's far, far more awesome than I'd initially thought!",1425427200,7,1413,4.652

The episodes of season seven are characterized by scenes that involve that kind of marginally insane dialogue that characterized seasons 1, 2, 3, 5, & 6. That is,  the characters can still carry on lengthy discussions of, say,  the significance of dismemberment with about the same passion that goes into talking about buttering toast or driving a car. Contributing greatly are the development of the relationships between Buffy and Spike, and Willow and Kennedy.  Sarah Michele Geller and Alyson Hannigan as Buffy and Willow are solid characters who still manage to carry the series.

but it truly was not that good of a final season.
The writing seemed at times too stretched to be able to keep the plot going and had to resort to all the little extra bits of avant garde writing to try to hold on to viewership until the end.
sorry but Buffy should have died,(as well as most of the others) but her ""mortal wound"" miraculously healed, and  and now there be slayers abounding.
um, so with increased slayers wouldn't that mean an increase of big bads also?
This season was worse than season six because, I expected better out of a final season.

2137503,4,B0002XVKMC,"It's been nearly a month since I have finished this season finale and it has taken me so long to review this because I just didn't know what to say, I had to let it sink in, I mean, it's a season that REALLY gave me more mixed feelings than any of the previous seasons, and there was another season that took me a couple of week's to review due to mixed feelings and just needing to think about it, that's what the case was here, being a season finale I expected SO much more and wanted SO much more, and what I got what a WHOLE LOT less than what this could have been, not only that but I think it was the first disk that did not have a single bad episode, in fact, I believe I liked them all, however, somewhere after that there were a LOT of ok, mediocre, forgettable, and genuinely uninteresting and forgettable episode's, and then it picked back up, however, the episode Storyteller which is COMPLETELY dedicated to an unlikable character when given 99% of the screen time made this the SECOND WORST episode I have seen, even worse than Bad Beer, thankfully there were only three episodes I hated throughout all seven seasons, this negativity aside, there was a lot of really, really good episodes, but I felt so underwhelmed considering this should have been completely strong from beginning to end like seasons 1,2,3, and 6. but unfortunately it doesn't deliver like it should have. It is however a respectable finale, not perfect, but sufficient, a whole lot of surprises and we lose some great character's which is hard, just emotionally we have become so attached to these people and that's what they were like to me, people, not just some actor's playing a part, I was so incredibly invested in this show and while I was sad that this was the end, it really was perfect to end it sooner as apposed to later, I just wish that it was better, but for what we got, it was altogether worth it, and of coarse I highly recommend it, if you're a fan of the show like me, and if you've never seen this show, then after you read this go buy all freaking seven yourself and have a good time! This is a great show, but not perfect and at times rather dated, but it has truly held up better than it honestly should have and more than almost any show from the decades before and after. It truly is one of a kind and could NEVER be remade, rebooted, or reborn into anything better than it was and is.

My favorite episodes of season 7 are:

Selfless
Same Time, Same Place
First Date
Chosen
Sleeper
Lies My Parents Told Me
Empty Places

Buffy didn't get the credit it deserved because it took a younger generation to appreciate not only the imagination of Joss W  but a bunch of unknown actors that worked hard to please their followers and think outside the box.",1404518400,,347,4.655737704918033

Now I have watched the series in order from start to finish and am amazed at the story telling that Joss Whedon and the writers wove throughout the seven years.

It matches perfectly with the Angel series and at times crosses over (loved that!). It also explained a great deal since the Buffy series contains all of the background for Angel. Definitely recommend if you like the supernatural.",1399852800,,482,4.682352941176471

2137609,5,B0002XVKMC,"As stated this is not the 2006 re-release slim box set. This the 2008 slimmer, clear dvd case set. The picture shown is for the original 2004 box set that folds out. The way you can tell the difference is that the original release says on the box: Season 1 (etc) On DVD. The 2006 re-release only says: Season 1 (etc). The 2008 clear dvd case re-re-release says: The Complete First (etc) Season 6 - DISC SET. I found this out the hard way after many returns from ebay and Amazon who use stock photos. The only place I found selling the 2006 versions was Best Buy. They have both Angel and Buffy but they charge thirty bucks for Buffy 2006 slims. Hopes this helps some peeps.

Rarely, shows have an ending. Let alone a good one. This series plays out like a long movie or comic series with an ending to end all endings. The final season tends to have much darker tones than the previous ones, but then again, the ultimate apocalypse is coming. The ending is so exhilarating, I get chills and choked up every time I watch it and I've watched the entire series 8 times.",1392076800,,1065,4.325

His should be the name for that seemingly pleasant and affable toxic element that strives for upward mobility while appearing to be down to earth and accommodating.  Fortunately, Buffy in her experience and innate sense of justice has no problem seeing through him.  This is in contrast to the Parker Abrams episode where Buffy does not see through that type of glib predator hunting in a game preserve.

The Jonathan Woodward performances in the Whedonverse should be collected and watched in chronological order.",1387497600,,604,5.01

2137632,4,B0002XVKMC,"Does Buffy the Vampire Slayer get too much criticism for their seventh season? It does seem like the show got a lot of slack for season four and six, two seasons that I really enjoyed despite their drawbacks. Sadly, season seven does deserve some of the negativity it draws. It is not a horrible season, I actually liked a lot of it and feel like deserves the four stars, but it is easily my least favorite season of the show.

I feel like it had a lot of missed potential. It's main villain, The First, is basically satan. He can transform to look like anyone and taunt them. It is effectively frightening in the episode called Conversations with Dead People. But for the rest of the show? It falls completely flat and is definitely not convincing or scary. Also, this season consisted of the addition of many new characters that just feel rushed and unlikeable. I feel like in this season, there was little time to wrap the show up. Maybe the writers panicked.

On the bright side, it is still Buffy. Andrew was a wonderful and funny addition to the cast and I absolutely loved how the relationship between Spike and Buffy was ended. Spike was the hero all along, beautiful. While I did enjoy the season final, it would have been nice to see it as a hour long special. Shame it was the normal 40 minutes. So, watch the season and come to your own conclusions.",1381881600,,1361,4.461847389558233

If I were a strict parent, which I'm not, I wouldn't let my child watch it until they were 15, especially the girls.  Alot of sex and violence.

2137696,4,B0002XVKMC,"This season was fun to watch. Unfortunately I was left a bit puzzled as to why the script writers did not think a bit more before they wrote a few things. The main one was, why is it that the next Slayer is supposed to be called when Buffy dies? This unfortunately makes no sense to me, as at the end of season 5 she does die and yet no Slayer is called. When she does die in the earlier season a Slayer is Kendra is called and when she dies Faith is called. So why is it that they totally forget about Faith and continue to say that Buffy is they only one, where as it very clear that the next Slayer has to be called only when Faith dies. But that is just my opinion, and as the series is old it does not really count anymore.

2137698,1,B0002XVKMC,"I enjoyed the previous seasons of Buffy, but not so much when Dawn came along (I found her too whiny and needy). Season 6 had ups and downs. Season 7 just lost me completely. The actors themselves seemed bored and looked like they didn't want to be there, especially Willow. The episodes were padded and slow-moving, and characters became less and less likeable. The Big Bad was not at all interesting. Bringing in old characters (Faith, Angel) added nothing, and new ones like Caleb seemed like desperate attempts to pump life into a blase story. One good thing about this season is that it didn't leave me disappointed that it wasn't renewed.

There were some bright spots: ""Help,"" ""Selfless,"" ""Conversations with Dead People,"" and ""Storyteller."" But that's how many episodes out of 22 total?",1368489600,2,794,4.925373134328358

2137719,5,B0002XVKMC,"In the earlier seasons the villain for the season was introduced in the early episodes. In season seven there are too many stand alone episodes, which are great if you are a fan of various short story lines. I for one like them but when it comes to The First who is suppose to be this big evil; I think more episodes are needed to set up the series finally. The series finally is very good. I won't say anything because if you are a fan you would want to see it for yourself. I have seen Buffy the Vampire Slayer on television with some episodes out of context. I have also seen the entire series in order. You will get a different perspective if you watch them in order. You have to watch the earlier seasons before you watch season seven. The experience will be better. Season seven is not the best season but it wraps up the series well.",1364169600,,840,4.22360248447205

I don't mean to be harsh this is just my opinion.",1332374400,,400,3.925925925925926
2137770,4,B0002XVKMC,"Another paradoxical season. While this season has fewer lows than Season 6, and those lows tend to be not *as* low as the previous year, there also is a surprising dearth of really strong episodes as well. Very few of these would end up on any fan's top 10 list.

It's not a great ending to the series - it had gotten a bit long in the tooth - but it is a *good* ending.

Best episodes: Lessons; Selfless; Conversations with Dead People (probably the best ep of the season); Storyteller; and Chosen (the final episode - again, not great, but worth seeing).",1331424000,,556,4.388349514563107

Because in the middle of the season pretty much nothing seems to happen, and it gets you (me at least) bored from the season. It continues very slowly, and there's nothing happening that is important for the storyline. Other than that, I have another problem, potentials: they enter, they stay and they never leave. They become a block to the main four core character whose' energy and connection we love about the show.
 So, these are big reason the final season gets bad reputation. The season has stand-out episodes, some of them are one of the best episodes of the show. My favorite episodes chronologically are: Selfless, Conversations with Dead People, Storyteller, Lies My Parents Told Me and Chosen. My vote is 7.8/10.",1329696000,,879,4.745098039215686
2137772,5,B0002XVKMC,"**SPOILER ALERT**

It was obvious that Joss Whedon was going to make sure that Buffy the Vampire Slayer went out with a bang.  And it did.  One of the tragedies of television shows is when a series has started to run out of steam, and instead of a series ending things on its own while it is still on top, it waits until there isn't much left, and it falls victim to low-ratings scenario.

I can't think of many television series that went out when it was still a high-quality show.  Typically the strength of a show rests with its writers.  As long as the stories are still strong, the show thrives.

While I still feel that Season 2 was arguably the best season for the show, no one can deny the strength of the show's climactic season.

So, the season's storyline this time isn't just about Buffy fighting demons and vampires.  It's about her fighting the reason that they exist at all: evil.  First Evil, to be exact.  We were given a glimpse of the First (as it is referred to by the characters) back in Season 3.

In many ways, and as the first episode alludes to, the show comes full circle.  We're back at the high school, even though it has been rebuilt after it was more or less obliterated back at the end of Season 3.

Joss Whedon is one of the most talented writers in the business.  As a producer and creator, he is exceptional with great tongue-and-cheek dialogue and characterization.  Each character in the Buffy universe has many layers, and perhaps that is a reason that many of them are some of the most memorable characters in recent television history.  While Whedon can utilize humor and action, he can also tap into the hearts of the viewers with some touching and very poignant moments.  I think that in the episode ""Touched"" the scene where Spike shares his true feelings of how he perceives Buffy is absolutely beautiful.  I don't know of many women who wouldn't want to be on the receiving end of those words.  But, in many ways, Spike sums up what we also feel and hold for Buffy, which is probably why the truth of which he speaks strikes such a powerful chord.

The Season is about so many things:

Willow has to learn how to deal with the consequences of what she did in the last season.  How is she able to balance her power with control?  Because she now understands what she is capable of, and it scares her.  At the beginning of the season, even the viewer isn't entirely sure of what to make of her.

Xander has ever been the character to provide wit and humor during tough times.  But, he has also always been the character who ""sees"" everything.  He has the luxury of being outside the circle to a degree, which gives him the ability to see into the hearts of the other characters.  And because he never shys away from speaking his mind, he invariably passes off some incredible wisdom and insight to his friends.

Spike embodies what it means to be a true hero; to resurrect himself to become a better man.  At one point, Buffy ""crowns"" him her champion.  I don't know any other character that epitomizes that more than Spike.  As we know, Angel already reclaimed his soul when he encounters Buffy at the beginning of the series. Spike undergoes the radical transformation and undertakes the incredible task of rebuilding the bridge of trust with Buffy that he destroys in the last season.

The other characters round out the cast nicely.  Anya undergoes her own transformation when she realizes that she cannot go back to her old life.  Dawn finds ways to contribute, and in many ways like Xander, she is among the most selfless of the characters.

Andrew, wonderfully played by Tom Lenk, provides some great humorous moments.  In nearly every scene he's in, there is something to laugh at.  He takes ""geekdom"" to its ulimate level, and Andrew has to find a way to tap into his own courage.

Much of what occurs in this season is referenced back to all of the other seasons throughout the run of the show.  Season 7 transcends the six before it, as our beloved characters finally cross over from teenagers into adults.

Overall, this is one of the best television series.  It has everything...action, drama, comedy, memorable characters, great stories, and it never takes itself too seriously, even though there are plenty of serious and even touching moments.  The  final battle scenes from ""Chosen"" the last episode, are fantastic, especially along with the incredible musical score that seems to sum up everything that the show is, which is why it is truly epic.

Perhaps, with all of this, Whedon perfectly closes out the series with a question from Willow.  ""Well, Buffy, what should we do now?""

There is no answer, because one isn't needed.",1312934400,,4688,4.584837545126354

(buffy the vampire slayer) and claiming season seven didn't center in on the three main charactors enough or that there was not enough nastalga. This, pontential buyers, is wrong. As we learned from season four on: Things change, Peolple change (Buffy, Willow, Anya and Dawn, for a start) and lives change. Sometimes for the better and sometimes for the worse. The piont of the season is to watch the charactors grow and change, take charge, become who they will be forever. Dawn is a over emotional teen in an identity crisis, but in this season she finds her place in her family and becomes a mature young women. Willow meets Kennedy, one of the potenial slayers and they form a romantic relationship. Now many fans were upset that Willow forgot Tarra so easily but as you can see from the episode ""Conversations with Dead People"" she did not. But as we also know many people enter into toxic or bad relationships, like Buffy and Spikes thing back in season six. Not healthy for either of them. But they grew from it. And so mabye Kennedy isn't the best partneer for Willow but, everyone enters into bad relationships and yes she grows from it. This season is touching, innovative, and nastaligic. It is everything you could ask for, for a final season. truly a new chapter for each charactor and something everyone can enjoy. New characotrs, Old chactors, flashbacks, and boundries breaking are just some of the things you can except from season seven and is definitly worth your hard earned cash.

The first episode opens with a bang that can only be beaten by the shocking ending (apparently, I live near the other hellmouth, so the ending lines were very funny to me).

Spike uses and amulet that Angel gave buffy to destory the hellmouth. Anya dies and Andrew returns and works with the scobbies to get rid of the first.

alot of people didn't agree with that, thought it was weak and not as good as previous seasons but I really enjoyed it. yes, it was dark, but going from six, it would have to be. I thought that season seven was the season that buffy had become the slayer..she no longer needed giles' help or even willow for that matter. she had her own army and she was in command. and yes, she made mistakes. that's what I liked about the season and I really enjoyed the ending to what could've been the ending. if they would've just ended it like in five, I think it would've been predictable. but they did such a great job with the ending. it was such a good sendoff season.",1268956800,,756,4.293706293706293

And the last frame will have you smiling and satisfied that you invested all this time to a great show few shows can say they have as great as an end as Buffy but they don't so definitely get this one!",1260662400,3,474,3.8969072164948453
2137807,5,B0002XVKMC,"So it all comes to end, and boy does it ever! Season 7, the final season of Buffy goes out with a real bang, though not on the level of perfection that Whedon achieved at the end of Season 5, but close enough. Season 5 was supposed to be the end. Seasons 6 and 7 were spared by UPN, and Joss Whedon and crew were given the green light. So this is essentially the second ending of the series. And As always, there seems to be that one episode that knocks your socks off and creates an instant classic, this one being ""Conversations with Dead People"" This one ranks with Hush, Once more with Feeling, and other classic episodes, abliet more subtley. Overall for the first half of the season you do not get a villain more terrifying then Kaleb being controlled by the first. It looks real bad for the scooby gang, and it gets worse. He treats them like rag dolls for a good part of the series. Ultimatley however, there are two vital connections that make this final season so important, The First, or the first evil. Willow and Buffy in and of themselves have thrown the balance out of life and death out of sync, and the first wants to teach everyone but, especially Buffy, a lesson about messing with the balance. Overall and exciting, sobering season that will leave you breathless, excited, but maybe, depending, not all together satisfied. But Joss does it better then anyone, and in the link of all seven seasons, your eyes will be glued to the screen. Great TV. ""Chosen"" rocked!!!! The DVD package is solid, and packed with great extras, including easter eggs, and the commentaries and documentaries are spot on.  This is a wondeful DVD, and a wonderful tribute to this series. For Many of us, this is where the series ended before it became a comic book for season 8, I prefere to remember it the way it was.

 Season 7, Episode 22: Chosen
Original Air Date--20 May 2003
After killing Caleb and returning home, Buffy is struck with an ingenious idea using a powerful scythe that she acquired at the vineyard. Willow will use the scythe to channel its power into all the Potential Slayer's making every single one around the world into a full-blown slayer. Using this new power, the gang launch an all-out war on The First and the army of Uber-Vampires beneath Sunnydale High.",1259971200,,10711,5.792993630573249

2137809,3,B0002XVKMC,"OK... First let me say I'm a die hard Buffy fan. Every other season was amazing and had me literally jumping outa my seat with excitement, but season seven was just terrible for its usual fun and fresh seasons. I think the best way to voice my opinion is to list the things I disliked about the season 7:

The ""Big Bad"" of the season wasn't so big or bad at all. For the first evil and sole reason for sin on earth, this villian absolutely sucked. He could not take corporial form therefore couldn't touch or be touched. Because of this, Buffy never physically fought the ""First"". He had to call upon other bad guys to do his dirty work. The only breath of fresh air ""The First"" brought to the season was taking the form of some of the dead characters from previous seasons, but once the shock of it wore off it left you asking yourself, ""Is that it? Is that all he can do?""

Anya and Zander seemed to be in a lull throughout. They would make love now and again but nothing would come of it, and once they killed her off Zander and Anya's story never seemed to wrap up. In fact Zander didn't even seem to care that his girlfriend was dead.

Season 7 didn't introduce anything new. The episodes seemed to repeat themselves from previous years and dragged on borishly, especially during the middle where the season started to lose my interest. I found some of the episodes so terrible I wanted to fast forward to the end, such as ""Storyteller"", ""Same Time Same Place"",and ""Empty Places"". Yet there were few great episodes too like, ""Conversations with Dead People"", ""Him"", and ""Dirty Girls"".

Spike and Buffy's relationship I found to be totally bizarre and it took me out of the story. Spike used to be so bad ass but now seems so ""Buffy-whipped"" its pathetic. She doesnt want spike but doesnt want anyone else to have him.

The story line about the potential slayers was so off putting. You didn't even get to know half of there names let alone feel for them if they were killed. For most of the season they were totally useless and whinny, and a majority of time was focused on training them to become more powerful Slayers. The introduction of a completely new cast was overwhelming.

The last episode got so ridiculous I found myself cringing at times. In the begining of the season the Uber-Vampires were nealry impossible to kill, yet the last episode turns into a ""Lord of the Rings"" type battle where the Potential slayers (after Willow puts a spell on them to make them stronger) kill thousands of them easy as pie. Just when they start losing the battle Spike randomly glows really bright, turns all the other vamps to dust and dies himself, right before the entire town of Sunnydale collapses into the ground. It was way over-the-top.

I did enjoy the return of Faith, my absolute favorite character in the series, and the introduction of the evil preacher, Caleb. He was the only formidable villian of the season, yet the final battle between him and Buffy was pathetic. He was killed so easily and fast it left me wanting to see more of him. In my opinion, I think he should have been the ""Big Bad"" of the season.

Seven was the absolute worst season of all the seasons. It felt as if the writers were tired of working on the show and half-assed it, but if your a die hard Buffy fan its worth a watch for the few good episodes and closure, just don't expect the classic edge of your seat, laugh-fest, thrill coaster kinda Buffy.",1258588800,,3440,4.4665605095541405

2137811,1,B0002XVKMC,"And that's about all I have to say about this season.  It was just a piece of garbage.  The plot, the characters, the villians, Buffy's long-winded uninspiring speeches, the annoying slayers-in-training, the horrible looking CGI-fueled action scenes, and the crappy end to a once-great series.  I don't even think I want to do an in-depth review of season 7, like I did for the other seasons.  However, there a few key points I want to address.
 After I watched the cliffhanger ending of season 6, I had to watch season 7.  I mean, Spike with a soul?  How could it not be awesome.  Here's how.  Spike doesn't act any different.  He's a little nutty when he first gets back to Sunnydale, but it didn't really make any sense.  Angel didn't act like that when he got his soul back.  He was very remorseful, but he didn't  just sit around spouting gibberish.  And once Spike gets over himself, he's no different from the Spike we knew in the last 3 seasons.  I never really thought of Spike as evil, necessarily.  Maybe a little bit in the first half of Season 2, but he had already pretty much turned good before he got his soul back.  He was still kind of a jerk, and that should have changed with him getting his soul back.  I mean, look at Angel.  He did a complete 180 when he got a soul.  Spike has pretty much the same personality with and without a soul.
 Now, the main villian of this season, The First.  Remember them?  Those ghost guys who started tormenting Angel around Christmas in season 3?  Well, the writers decided to make them the big bad of this season.  They suddenly show up and decide to destroy the world.  So where were they for the last 4 years?  And who are they?  How did they create the vampires-on-steroids if they can't physically manifest themselves?  What happened to them at the end?  Did they get blown up along with the hellmouth?  Are they somehow linked to the hellmouth?  WHAT THE HECK IS GOING ON?!?
 I want to bring up one more point.  The character Dawn.  She turned into an excellent character in this season.  I mean, she finally grows up and stops being such a brat.  That is, until the end.  That thing where she and the other slayers kick Buffy out of the house was the stupidest, most contrived, pointless plot line I've ever seen.  It makes no sense, it makes you want to kill Dawn even more, and Buffy is back with them at the end of the next episode.  What did you do guys do that for?!  I want to point out all the annoying characters in the later half of this series.  Riley.  They removed him when there was a fan outcry for it.  Tara.  Her bland character was finally killed off.  Anya.  She finally dies at the end of this season.  But Dawn?  She stays on for the rest of the series.  She's even in the season 8 comics.  I want to compare Dawn to Connor on Angel.  Both of them are easily the worst, most hated characters on their respective shows.  The difference?  On Angel, they had the good sense to remove Connor after one season.  Why not on Buffy?  I mean, Joss Whedon was overseeing both shows.  In fact, I want to ask another question.  If Joss Whedon was the creator of both shows, and he oversaw both shows, then why was Angel so good, and Buffy seasons 4, 5, and 7 so awful?",1256860800,9,3238,4.337248322147651
2137812,5,B0002XVKMC,"The final season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer was pretty good considering most series end without warning or preparation. Story lines were wrapped up pretty neatly, but with the ability to continue on (in Season 8 - the comic book). It was sad to see some characters go, but the series had a great run, and left fans eager to get more from Joss Whedon.

My only gripe is with the DVD production itself. There is a special features featurette on the third or fourth disc that gives away the end of the series (it literally shows the final scene). Be warned. If you are a first time Buffy watcher, skip the special features until you've completed the series.",1242345600,,655,4.504201680672269

I was stoked that Spike got his soul back, I was interested to see what would happen with all the characters ... and what happened?  A big fat zippo.  I mean, primary problem: you can't kill the first evil, which is the big bad, so the entire plot line was pointless.  And then all the episodes were just insipid.  Spike had that awesome monologue where Buffy learns he has a soul and I thought ""yay, this season's going to get better!"" and then it never did.  And Andrew was just annoying as HELL which says nothing of how annoying all the little potential slayers are ... or how annoying Buffy is with her weekly big speeches.  That's triple annoying throughout the entire season.

Every year I watched, I felt I grew along with these exceptionally complex characters. I think the erudite Joss Whedon did justice to his beloved heroine's adventures.

I mean, don't you think this should have been brought up AGES ago, if it was going to be this significant in the final season?  Urgh.  It's like the final season is a whole new show, one I don't really care for.  Nothing happens.  Everyone's character is twisted, and nothing like themselves.  Everything was just done wrong.

For one, Buffy and Spike worked so well together, it was refreshing to see.

The dissention in the group was painful to watch, only because of how I felt about the characters. I think Joss Whedon did a good job with making me feel Buffy's pain when she was betrayed.

My only complaint is, I think the characters should say what needs to be said a bit more. Like when Buffy reminded Xander of his words to her when she had to kill Angel in S2. At that point, Xander was being his usual hypocritical self and I loved how Buffy told him off. More of that needed to happen.

But over all, fantastic ending, great humor and lotsa action and fun.

2137846,4,B0002XVKMC,"SPOILERS TOO!

As with other reviewers,  I consider Buffy to be among the best television ever (one need only compare it to Angel  to see how hard it is to really carry this stuff off).  Season 7 is also not the best of them all, except for the fact that the last episode is really the most brilliant coup.  One can forgive almost anything with such an ending, even the not very interesting setup (Caleb is a caricature, and, as others have said, the First is the Last).

There is a sense in this Season that the writers were writing character shifts in order to set up great scenes, rather than the other way around -- e.g.

(1) It may be that the series ended a bit too soon for the writers.  It is really set up that Robin Wood and Buffy would get together, not the Faith detour.  He is certainly in a different league than, say, Riley (yawn).

(2) The Willow/Kennedy scene about betraying Tara was quite moving, but I also didn't believe in the romance.  It was as if the writers needed the romance so they could get to that scene.

(3) The bringing back of dead characters was a waste (again, written so that there could be scenes, not characters)

There is also something weird about the Potentials, as if they were from some porn sex army/Charlie's Angels episode (as ever, Whedon inserts his own critique, cf. the girls' pillow fight).

Nevertheless -- and in spite of the earlier long-winded Buffy speeches, the last speech and the rising up of the women was amazing and powerful.  It was beautifully set up and edited,  and the last fifteen minutes just have this astonishing rhythm, and it is clear that it was where Whedon was going -- even if he didn't exactly have the ending -- all along.  A long gestation period, but the end certainly justified it.",1208563200,,1765,4.465625

Every other season I have, I have watched multiple times, this one I have not been very tempted. The only reason I am tempted to watch it again, is in hopes of finding something decent, after reconsidering, even if you are a huge buffy fan, this season is really not worth buying. I heard an interview with Sarah Michelle Gellar, saying one of the reasons she quit the show, was because she wanted to quit after a strong season, my thought is, she must be delusional.

2137868,4,B0002XVKMC,"BUFFY's seventh season wasn't just the final bow of a great series, it was an out-and-out comeback. A lot of fans were unsure if it could recover from the relative low point that was the sixth season, but with its legacy more-or-less on the line, the cast, writers and producers of BtVS joined together and delivered the goods when it mattered most. Whereas the troubled S6 made me wonder if ""the name outlived the man"", the seventh followed the oldest rule in show biz: ""Always leave `em wanting more.""

Things I liked:

* The blasts from the past. It was great fun to see, however briefly, Buffy's Big Bads parade across the screen; this is just the sort of thing diehard fans love. I always wanted to see Mark Metcalf (the Master) do a scene with Spike (""It's going to be an interesting couple of months and I think we're all going to learn a lot. You're going to learn that you're a pathetic shmuck."")

* The Nikki/Robin Wood/Spike sub-plot. I was expecting something like this for years (actually I was expecting Kendra's watcher to show up) and I think it was nicely handled except for the way it was resolved - or rather, not resolved.

* Sunnydale High. Nice to ""go home"" again even if it was a different set.

* I truly enjoyed the all-too-brief fight between Spike and Faith. Buffy beat up Spike so many times in Seasons 2, 4, 5, 6 and 7 it was easy to forget that before he met his match in her, he was a Slayer slayer (he gave Kendra a beating in Season 2, as I recall).

* The return of vamps as primary villain. For a show with VAMPIRE in the title there was not much focus on the bumpy-forehead set after about Season Four. The ubervamps were a nice touch.

* Nathan Fillion's ""preacher"" was not by any means my favorite Big Bad, but he was by far the most hateful. Previous Bads were so entertaining it was hard to have any real animosity toward them; not so with him. He was loathsome, sadistic, arrogant, vicious and just nasty.

* Slayer army...very innovative and well done.

* The overall story arc was very strong; the sub-plots weaved well into the main thread of story; everybody had a part to play and played it well. Tony Head did an especially good job of showing Giles' seldom displayed ruthless side.

* All Buffy seasons have a ""crisis point"" where you think things can't get worse and then they do. Season Seven has a brilliant one with Buffy getting ousted as the leader. E tu, Scoobies?

* Xander's ""seven years"" speech to Dawn. I thought this was brilliantly written and brilliantly acted. I often wondered how X. felt about being ""standing just outside the spotlight.""

Things I didn't like:

* A really gutsy move would have been to have Robin kill Spike, or Spike kill Robin. It would have been as jaw-dropping as a certain murder that occurs in the last season of ANGEL.

* The political agenda. Sorry to sound like Agent Mulder having a paranoid moment, but it seemed to me like Joss W. was trying to shovel in as many social-political messages in this season as he possibly could; (explicit gay sex, interracial sex, a bad guy wearing a priest's collar vs. good guy pagans, Buffy emasculating the villain with an axe, etc.) I thought it was preachy and crass.

* Kennedy. I hated, hated, hated this chatacter and think she was the worst ever introduced in the series. The idea that she and Willow would end up together just because they are both lesbians was insulting. It was easy to see why Willow could fall for Tara, who was charming, sweet, and pure of heart; Kennedy, on the other hand, was an obnoxious slut. I also had issues with the way their sex was handled. Tara & Willow's scenes were done metaphorically (casting spells as a metaphor for lovemaking) and were classy and beautiful. Willow and Kennedy's romps to cheesy rock music looked like Skinimax at 3 AM. Was this really the same character of the first three seasons?

* I would have loved it if Xander and Buffy had gotten together. It is my understanding the actors themselves wanted this to happen, but JW torpedoed it. Too bad. I believe it was a logical outcome to their friendship, which intensified greatly in the Sixth Season; also to the fact that Xander had become a man and no longer carried a torch for Buffy, which is of course the surest way to get her interest.

* The thing with the Guardians was silly and lame. It wasn't necessary to the plot and should have been eliminated. I could have done without the excessive use of the nerds from the sixth season, Joss seems to be nearly obsessed with these characters, who are tolerable only in smallish doses as comic relief. And the nerd in me was a bit disturbed by the fact that the graves of Joyce Summers and Jenny Calendar were among the parts of Sunnydale which dissapeared into the abyss. Kind of callous.

* While I was glad to see so many familiar faces from past seasons, including David Boreanaz, I really wanted to see others, including Eric Balfour (who played Jesse in the pilot; he was the ""first soldier down"" and it would have been great to have him do a scene opposite Xander, who killed him); Robia LaMorte (Jenny), Oz (one suspects this character was not brought back for ""political"" i.e. sexual correctness reasons; it wasn't correct to make Willow bisexual, she had to be full-on gay!); Ethan Rayne, Riley Finn and Willy the Snitch. I also would have loved to see the First assume the Master's shape and then have one of the ubervamps do a double take as if to say, ""Daddy?""

(OK, most of this is the nerdly nit-picking you would expect from oh, say, Comic Book Guy, but hey, what's the use of being a fan if you can't be unrealistic and difficult?) As a rule, I thought the season was very good, respectful of the show's history and mythology, and that it produced some episodes as good as anything from the ""golden age"" of Seasons 1 - 3. The finale was appropriately operatic in scope, beautifully scored, with great performances all around, and had a beautiful full-circle moment just at the climax between Buffy, Giles, Xander and Willow (""The earth is doomed."") To sum it up: BUFFY was one of the greatest television shows ever, and it was very important for it to exit the stage the same way it appeared. Mission accomplished.",1190937600,7,6225,4.522241992882562

Anyway, Joss Whedon being Joss whedon he would not release below-stantard products and Buffy 7 is a good season, whilst being clearly inferior to other six seasons, IMHO. What are the reasons that I think so?

1) The Potentials - annoying, taking the focus out of the Scoobie Gang;
2) Kennedy - The Annoyer One.
3) Makng Xander half-blind, when he already had too little screen time;
4) Giles - almost gone;
5) The death of Anya - it seems they simply did not care about i;
6) The First Evil = lame

2137871,4,B0002XVKMC,"""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" was a rare thing: a five-star TV series.  The seventh season was still good, but was not the best of the series.

The theme of the potential slayers contradicted one of the great qualities of the show: this series turned around very interesting, well-defined characters, whether they were likable or not.  By adding the large number of potential slayers to the mix, the writers made it impossible to define those characters.  They were just ""there"" -- it was impossible to care about them.  With the show wrapping up, Joss Whedon and the other writers could have limited the number of new characters, so that they had time to define those characters.  But they did not, to the detriment of the show.

Secondly, obvious feminist theme introduced at the end -- that the uniqueness of the slayer was a plot by men who lived long ago, and through Willow's magic, all potential slayers could be empowered as actual slayers -- is ridiculous.  If the empowerment of women is symbolized by the notion that a tiny fraction of them have magical power, then most women remain powerless.  Seriously, ""Buffy"" is very close thematically to the ""magical girl"" genre of Japanese cartoons (think Sailor Moon and so forth), where the super-powered girl heroine excites the girls by being super and the boys by being a sex symbol.  The overt feminism introduced during Buffy's seventh season is preachy and offensive.

Thirdly, the seventh season makes the evil enemy overly physical.  ""Buffy"" is fantasy, and fantasy works by making ""spiritual"" things like good and evil objective and physical, so that they can be confronted.  But in this season, evil is too physical.  Apparently, the apocalypse that is going to overwhelm the world is an invasion of a massive number of ""uber-vamps"" who are armed with... swords?  And disintegrate when exposed to sunlight?  At the end the heroes enter the ""hellmouth"" and see the thousands of these evil creatures down in a pit.  So, at great cost, they fight them with swords.  Jack Bauer (""24"") would simply toss a suitcase nuke down in the hole, incinerate the lot of them, and be done with it all.  The overall greatest weakness of the ""Buffy"" series is that in general the bad guy had to be defeated physically by Buffy.  (The only exception to this was the year Willow went bad, and had to be ""conquered"" by Xander's friendship.)  In other words, even as fantasy, the ending of this seventh season was too far beyond belief.

Given all that, the old characters that pre-existed the seventh season still were a lot of fun, and bringing back characters like Faith added much to the show.  There were several good episodes, especially in the first part of the season.  And making the heroes pay a real price for their victory -- one is half-blinded, another is killed, and several of the potential slayers die also -- makes the whole thing very serious fantasy.  ""Buffy"" was a five-star series, but this season, while good, does not come up to the quality of some of the others.  Four stars.",1188864000,2,3040,4.786948176583493

2137887,4,B0002XVKMC,"One of the original appeals of the Buffy the Vampire Slayer TV series--aside from the fantasy and girl power--was the quick wit of the dialogue amongst the characters. While it's always hard to place that dialogue in real life, you can accept the witty reparte when your main character is a supernaturally powered teenage girl who fights vampires and other evil monsters.

However, about halfway through season 7 (at about the same point that the gaggle of potential slayers start to show up), the show loses the wit and humor that made it great. Too many speeches from Buffy made her less lovable and harder to empathize with. Instead she seemed arrogant and was rightfully thought holier than thou by everyone who was supposed to be on her side. Also Spike's resouling seems like a broken record when we've already lived through Angel's torment in previous seasons. Yet another vampire with a soul to serve as the First Evil's plaything.

Good Things About Season 7:
-Dawn's character development. After being a whiny brat for the majority of  her previous two seasons, Dawn has finally matured leaps and bounds over what anyone could've expected of her.
-Conversations With Dead People. Probably the best episode of the entire season. It could prove disappointing for the action lovers, but the scenes with Willow alone made my skin crawl. Also Jonathan Woodward is golden as a vampire that Buffy ends up having a nice chat with.
-The first half of the season has some great episodes including the very humorous Him, the excellent Anya-centric Selfless, and the very creepy Same Time, Same Place. Other enjoyable episodes include The Killer In Me and Storyteller.
-Nathan Fillion as the evil preacher, Caleb, is superb.

Bad Things About Season 7:
-When Giles finally returns to Sunnydale, he's a cardboard cut-out of the character we used to know and love. With the exception of a few good lines here and there, Giles is cold, detached, and hardly the father-figure Buffy has always held so dear.
-Buffy's speechifying got rather tiresome and repetitive.
-The Potential Slayers were pretty useless for a majority of the season and it got to a point when I kind of wished the Bringers would kill them all.
-Regardless of whether or not I'm a Willow/Tara fan or not, Kennedy was not the kind of woman for Willow to move on with. While The Killer In Me was a shining moment for Alyson Hannigan, her scenes with Kennedy were almost painful as Iyari and Aly had nowhere near the kind of chemistry that Aly had with both Amber Benson and Seth Green in the character's past romantic relationships.

Obviously this is a must have for die-hard fans of Buffy, but compared the rest of the series, season 7 is truly lacking.

It's better to leave the audience wanting more then wishing you'd stopped. There are a lot of good episodes and the acting and writing are excellent. Overall this was my fav. season.

2137892,5,B0002XVKMC,"From 1997 to 2003, Joss Whedon gave his audience some of the best episodes aired on television. BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER showcased an empowered young girl saddled with the unintimidating name of Buffy Summers, who, with the help of her high school friends and her stuffy mentor Giles, faced sundry monsters and saved the world - a lot. Along the way, she managed to leave an indelible impact on our pop cultural consciousness.

Before its series debut, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, based on its promotional push on TV, seemed slated to be a straight-out horror series starring an erstwhile typical high schooler who battles vampires and demons. But, fairly quickly on, this unassuming little show, thanks to Whedon's intense and witty, pop-culture savvy yet very literate writing, met and surpassed the viewer's expectations. Whedon created compelling stories and characters who grew on the viewers; for seven years, we watched them strive to maintain a normal life as they navigated thru high school, college life, and then to adulthood, all the while frequently facing down supernatural threats. Which brings us to Season 7.

Possible SPOILERS follow: Here in the bittersweet and melancholy finale season, Joss Whedon attempts to provide closure to the show and also to bring it full circle to its origins. The opening episode ""Lessons"" has Buffy escorting Dawn, for her inaugural school day, back to good, ol' Sunnydale High, which has just been rebuilt on top of the old one. This, by the way, means that the Hellmouth is very much alive and again active. Somehow, Buffy is offered a job as a school counselor at Sunnydale High by the enigmatic principal, Robin Wood (24's D.B. Woodside). Back in England, Willow, under the tutelage of Giles and a benevolent coven of witches, has been recovering from her turn to the dark side (Season Six) and receives a horrifying glimpse of the future for Sunnydale. Meanwhile, Spike is found dwelling in the Sunnydale High School basement in a bonkers state of mind, influenced by his new soul and possibly also by...something else. Lessee, who's left? Anya is again a Vengeance Demon, though her heart isn't really in it. And Xander is still fixing windows...

The season's major story arc involves the return of the First Evil, the original and the source of all evil. The First's return is made possible by the instability caused by Buffy's having died and consequently being resurrected (again, Season 6). Very early on, we get a hint of the season's Big Bad as various Sunnydale denizens spout the ominous warning: ""From beneath you, it devours."" This season also increases the scope of Buffy's world even more as most of the Watcher Council are annihilated and Giles is forced to seek out Potential Slayers (who are also being killed off one by one by Bringers, no-eyed, murdering servants of Caleb and the First) and bring them to Sunnydale for protection. Now, more than ever, Buffy's leadership skills and methods are tested and even questioned as several of the Potentials prove to be uncowed and contentious free thinkers. Buffy has never been forced to deliver as many bracing, rallying speeches as she has been this season, which attests to her foe's overwhelming level of menace.

Because the First cannot enter our world in a corporeal form and can only assume the identities of dead people, this is an opportunity for a callback of Buffy's past uber-foes. For one last time, we get to enjoy cameos of the Master, Drusilla, the Mayor, Adam, Glory, and two of the Nerd Trio. Pretty neat. Besides the First, Buffy faces two despicable and truly hard-to-kill villains, who are themselves minions of the First: the Turok-Han, an early caveman type of vampire (thus, even more sturdy than contemporary vampires) and Caleb, the frightening, mysoginistic preacher who convincingly beats Buffy senseless in several encounters.

As ever, the writers do an amazing job. The episodes are obviously action-packed. But, underneath the surface, the show is laden with metaphors and symbolisms. Themes of isolation, the isolation of a leader, female empowerment, sacrifice, friendship, and humanity are touched on in great depth. This season is also about the quest for redemption. Most of the members of Buffy's Scooby gang, ironically, at one point or another, were evil or have turned evil in the past: Willow, Spike, Anya, Faith, Andrew...All these characters are trying to find their way back to atonement; it won't be easy.

This season has to be the one with the most recurring characters in it. Principal Wood and the Potentials are introduced. Season 7 also marks the return of Andrew, Faith, and, in one episode, Angel. With the glut of additional characters, the core Scoobies are given short thrift here, although Dawn does shine in ""Potential"" and Xander proves his worth in ""Potential"" and ""Dirty Girls."" One episode, ""Selfless,"" really focuses on Anya and paves the way for her eventual return to the fold. Only Spike seems to maintain copious screen time throughout the series. The camera, of course, is ever on Buffy Summers.

The arrival of the Potentials does usher in a freshness to the series as it simultaneously takes the spotlight away from the Scoobies. The take-charge Kennedy (Iyari Limon), the feisty Rona (Indigo), and Amanda (Sarah Hagan) prove to be welcome additions to the cast, while the non-English speaking Asian Potential drops some instant funnies. ""Conversations with Dead People"" reintroduces Andrew (the very good, very funny Tom Lenk) as a possible good guy, while ""Dirty Girls"" marks the welcome return of sexy Faith (Eliza Dushku) as her encounters with Spike provide some of the high points of the season. The awesome Nathan Fillion, by the way, is scary good as Caleb.

The Special Features provide episode commentaries by various cast and crew members on ""Lessons,"" ""Selfless,"" ""Conversations with Dead People,"" ""The Killer In Me,"" ""Lies My Parents Told Me,"" ""Dirty Girls,"" and ""Chosen."" Disc 3 has the featurette ""It's Always Been About the Fans."" Disc 6 offers up four more featurettes (the 36-minute long ""Season 7 Overview - Buffy: Full Circle""; ""Buffy 101- Studying the Slayer"" - various television critics talk about the show's influence; ""Generation S"" - interviews with the Potentials actresses; ""The Last Sundown"" - a look at Joss Whedon's top 10 favorite Buffy episodes and some of his thoughts about the series); an outtakes reel (not that funny); ""Buffy Wraps"" (the wrap party with cast and crew, but where was Sarah Michelle Gellar?); and for those who care, a DVD-ROM Willow Demon Guide.

Years ago, Joss Whedon wanted to shake things up by turning topsy-turvy the cliche of the hapless, little blonde damsel needing a hero to come to her rescue. Seven years of quality television has proven that audiences will accept a tiny girl being capable of slaying monsters while remaining quintessentially feminine. So, above all else, BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER is meant to be a feminist allegory. But, for those who aren't into that, there's still so much that this season has to offer: an us against the world mentality, superlative action sequences, shivery horror/fantasy elements, witty repartees, heartfelt dialogue, gripping, dramatic stories, and great acting. And, of course, great, iconic heroes in Buffy Summers, Spike, Faith, and crew. Five stars for one of my all-time favorite shows EVER.

2137905,3,B0002XVKMC,"Buffy may be one of the funniest TV series ever made, but it's also the most depressing.  How does a series maintain coherence when it ranges from screwball comedy to episodes that are artsier and darker than anything ever shown on HBO?  By focusing on it's main characters - Buffy, Willow, Xander, and Giles - through all the comedy, tragedy, and action.  These characters share the same traits that made Tony Soprano so famous: they are the most charming people you'll ever see, and yet can do truly despicable things.  It feels like the writers became bored of the main characters in the last season, which should be a year that reinforces what makes the series great, not deviate from it.

Xander's role in this season is a joke compared to the previous six.  Buffy spends most of the year giving incredibly annoying lectures.  Giles completely contradicts his growth over the previous six seasons: while he learned to let Buffy stand on her own over the past few years, now he's stabbing her in the back.  As for Willow... while the exploration of her guilt about season 6 is interesting, her new girlfriend is so annoying that I didn't enjoy many of her scenes.

The reason for Xander (and Anya's, and Dawn's) reduced screen time, and Buffy's annoyingness, is a group of potential slayers that take over Buffy's house.  None of them establish real personalities, not even Kennedy, the one who becomes Willow's girlfriend.  Nonetheless, a huge amount of time is spent either on the Potentials whining, or Buffy lecturing them, neither of which provides humor, or character development, or anything else you might be watching Buffy for.

So who DOES have a good character arc?  Andrew is absolutely fantastic.  He's hilarious, and he grows as a person over the year, just like the main characters used to on Buffy.  The problem is... Andrew is not who Buffy is about.  There are great seasons of Buffy without Andrew, but none without Buffy, Willow, or Xander.

Spike's character arc is also worth watching, except for a short period where he is brainwashed into being evil again.  The entire point of Spike's character is that he does everything for the women he loves, whether it's writing bad poetry, trying to destroy the world, or trying to save it.  A brainwashed Spike isn't Spike.

The good thing about season 7 is that the worst episodes are all strung together in the middle of the season.  If you skip everything after ""Conversations with Dead People"" and before ""Storyteller"" you end up with a decent half season of Buffy.  While Buffy's own actions are mostly uninteresting this season, a vampire's analysis of her in ""Conversations"" is hilarious and yet shockingly deep.

The last few episodes feature the return of Faith, who finally learns relationships can be about more than sex, a few funny scenes with a jealous Angel, and the appearance of Caleb, a neat villain played by Nathan Fillion.  This definitely rejuvenated my interest in the season, but other than showing that Buffy can pimp two vampires at the same time, it hardly made this an important year for the main characters.

Some people lump this season in with 6, which I strongly disagree with.  They're both a little rough around the edges - Joss Whedon only directed one episode of each, the amazing Buffy composer Chris Beck didn't do the music for either, and Anthony Stewart Head wanted Giles to be only a recurring character for both.  But there's one huge, glaring difference between 6 and 7: 6 is the most Buffy-Willow-Xander focused of all the seasons of Buffy, while 7 is the least.  6 introduced fewer new characters than any other season of Buffy, 7 introduced the most.  6 wasn't funny because it was telling a tragic story, while 7 wasn't funny because the writers weren't giving jokes to anyone but Andrew.",1164844800,11,3805,4.810769230769231

Absolutely loved the musical event that I was sure that I would disdain. It's a pretty great package, at last, tied up nice & neat, and if you are a believer who can suspend your disbelief, it leaves the Buff-head with pride and hope that though the struggle of good against evil will continue, we now all have a fighting chance...thanks to Willow's final and best ever world-wide spell, and our own untapped natural abilites to fight & win the good fight.

2137907,5,B0002XVKMC,"With this set of DVDs, The Seven year adventure of 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer' finally comes to an end.  Coming off the most fan-hated season to date, Joss Whedon went back to the beginning with this series, planning the story-arcs almost a year an advance, and deciding to return to the roots of the series, presenting a mixture of drama and comedy, filler episodes and arc episodes, themes and happyness, etc.  Not long after the season premier on UPN, Sarah Michelle Gellar gave Entertainment Weekly an exclusive interview titled: ""Buffy in its current incarnation, is over"" and within the week her, along with Joss Whedon and the President of UPN made a joint announcement that the series would come to a close the following May.

The producers/writers where given approx. 16 episodes and 6 months to wrap up the seven years of storylines, and for the most part they do an amazing job.  Whedon takes the series back to the beginning and finally takes Buffy from the innocent and naive school-girl (where the series started) to a loving mother/menter for others.  Also, he brings in 'the original evil' as this year's badguy - bringing back a bunch of old cahracters in the process.

Obviously, after seven-years as well as a spin-off and countless comic books, novels, and other media it was going to be next to impossible to provide an adequate and unique ending to a show that somehow became an icon of its generation (I personally do not know a single human around my age that hasn't seen atleast a couple of episodes...), but somehow Joss Whedon provided his loyal viewers with a fitting ending to the series... The final 5 episode arc sums up the entire series with returning characters, new characters, and final decisions that lead up to the final scene of the show which is nothing short of heartbreaking, empowering, and awestrucking!",1161820800,20,1846,4.825949367088608

2137909,3,B0002XVKMC,"This long review contains numerous spoilers.

Various other reviewers have said much of what I'd like to say. The only part I don't understand is why so many people will cheerfully acknowledge the many flaws in season seven yet still give it five stars. I get that they may think that even in an off year it was still one of the better shows around, but if you give this season four or five stars, what do you give to season two? Eleven stars?

I'll start with the negatives so I can finish on a positive note. My main problem with this season is the way that Dawn, Xander, Anya, and Giles got shunted to the back burner in favor of newcomers Principal Wood and the Potentials. Robin Wood was boring, his only interesting point coming when Spike brutally smacked him down. I also took against Wood when he hired a young girl barely out of high school, who had no qualifications to be a counselor, whose little sister was actually a current student, and then proceeded to put the moves on her. I know he didn't at first hire Buffy so that he could date her, but that whole set-up still pretty much defines sexual harassment. And a guy his age shouldn't be sniffing around 20 year-olds anyway (I know, he's centuries younger than Spike or Angel, but at least they weren't Buffy's employer or Dawn's principal).

I agree with those reviewers who mostly resented the Potentials for robbing Dawn, Xander, etc. of screen time. I'm sitting there watching one episode's climactic scene between Kennedy and Warren (okay, it was supposed to be Willow in Warren's body, but obviously it was just Adam Busch as Warren), and I'm thinking, we put in seven years for this? No Anya or Xander, but plenty of Kennedy and Amanda? It wasn't even necessary. The real Buffy actors were there, they were just being shamefully underused.

All except Alyson Hannigan as Willow, who as in Season Six is grossly overused this year. By far the weakest actor of the regulars, she portrays a character way too powerful for the show's good. With someone that much stronger than a Slayer around, there's really nothing special in being the Slayer anymore. You'd might as well brag about being the specially Chosen Xander. It figured that the final struggle would have little to do with Buffy but would instead consist of Willow performing a huge spell to help Spike's sacrifice win the day. Okay, that's a great magical finish for the show Willow the Too-Strong Witch Who Sometimes Tries to Kill Her Friends, but what does it have to do with Buffy the Vampire Slayer?

The one bright spot among the new additions was Tom Lenk as Andrew. He had played third fiddle to Warren and Jonathan in season six, but with them dead, he came into his own in the last season. His character didn't belong there at all (and if the writers had still been writing sensibly, he just would have been returned to the jail he had broken out of), but that just made him all the more hilarious. Even when he's conning the First Evil, he's keeping up this dopey act of pretending to think the First really just wants to see Buffy's underwear (you have to see this to appreciate how ridiculous it is).

As for the First Evil, it was indeed a poor ""Big Bad."" Not being able to touch things directly makes its menace fall rather flat. Though as some have noted, its supposed intangible nature doesn't quite square with the violent poltergeist antics it performed on Dawn and the house in its first appearance. The First could have been more threatening. I actually thought its revealing itself to Willow in the season's seventh episode, Conversations with Dead People, had some potential. When the First revealed that it was not in fact the dead Cassie, whom it had been impersonating, it did a really stomach-turning dissolve where Cassie seemed to turn inside out. But in its future appearances, the First simply faded to a bright line and winked out.

But either way, this could have been a dramatic moment if the First had been impersonating Willow's dead lover Tara as the show's producers had wanted. But Amber Benson wouldn't appear, so they had to settle for Azura Skye as Cassie. This was a poor choice, as Cassie had just been a one-shot character whom Willow had never even met. If they had to use Cassie, they should have had her reveal herself to Buffy or Dawn, who actually knew the character. Or they should have used someone else to confront Willow, someone she actually knew in life (Jenny Calendar, for instance).

As for the Dawn / Joyce storyline in that episode, it was never really followed up on. Supposedly the First as Joyce was warning Dawn that when the time came, Buffy wouldn't choose Dawn, whatever that meant. Well, if all that really portended was that as the apocalypse neared, Buffy would ask Xander to take Dawn to a safe place, big deal. Dawn resented being protected a little, but it's not like she regarded her big sister looking out for her as some huge betrayal.

This was one of a number of strange false moves in this season, where the writers seemed to lose track of continuity with past seasons and even within the season itself. They rewrote Spike's recent history to have him traveling to Africa in search of his soul in season six, when that season had made it clear that he was actually looking for a way to get the mind-control chip out of his head.

Now that Spike has been both ensouled and dechipped, he's a lot nicer and unfortunately, a lot less interesting. He's helpful without being violent, which isn't what Buffy needs right now. Only late in the season does he regain his form. One thing that is completely lacking in season seven is the former entertaining byplay between Spike and the various Scoobies. Giles barely notices he's there. There's no more big brother / little sister interaction between Spike and Dawn. He doesn't call Willow ""Red"" or even really deal with her on her own. He basically connects only to Buffy (and occasionally to Andrew). This is part of the larger problem of season seven, that the previous complex web of personal relationships that had made the show so strong is mostly nonexistent now. Most of the characters connect to Buffy on some level, but only rarely to each other. Where is the relationship between former business partners Anya and Giles? Where is Dawn's affection for Xander and Willow? (It's absent except for one scene with Xander).

Spike being a mindless tool of the First, brainwashed and controlled by a song, rankles with some viewers. Spike as evil is interesting. Spike as a hapless sleepwalking murderer is not.

Anya provides some of the most off-putting moments of the season. The character almost vanishes in the latter part of the season, though she does have a strong comeback in the final episode, with some great callously harsh lines directed toward the young Potentials. But early in the year, she lets her lingering resentment over being jilted by Xander lead her back into her vengeance demon days and she orchestrates a dozen brutal murders. Yes, these are magically undone by her former demon boss, T'Hoffran, but IMO that doesn't exactly let her off the hook morally. But as far as her friends are concerned, the whole thing might as well never have happened.

There are a variety of inconsistent double standards involving how the Scoobies and others who have killed are treated. Andrew does not receive the same compassionate treatment that Willow does, and Willow skinned a man alive, tried to destroy the world, and repeatedly tried to hurt Dawn. Anya and Spike have both murdered repeatedly, yet it seems that Xander comes in for more criticism for his immature handling of the Anya situation than either of the former demons does. Killer Faith breaks out of prison and returns and all is forgiven, but Andrew is still treated like a leper.

For someone so eager to protect her little sister, Buffy has an astounding blind spot regarding Willow. It is Willow, not Spike or the trio or the First, who has repeatedly tried to kill or hurt Dawn over the past two years. At some point even to your best friend you just have to say, I'll do whatever I can to help you get over your addiction to black magic,  but I can't have you living in my house anymore as long as you keep trying to kill my little sister. But after every one of Willow's screw-ups, there she is, installed back in the Summers' master bedroom, lording it over Buffy and Dawn. Why? Can't she get a job or an apartment or something? She's not in school anymore. It seems like Buffy's the only person in the whole group who ever works, besides Xander.

Other reviewers have pointed out the weirdness of the group's communal living arrangements, which were strange and cramped enough already before Andrew and dozens of Potentials joined the village. Can't Giles get some hotel rooms for himself and his charges when he comes to town? We know the Watchers' Council has some funding, even if many of its members were blown up. Can't Willow crash at her mom's? Can't Xander take Andrew off their hands? Does Spike still have to sleep in the basement once he's cured? If nothing else, this would be a heck of an atmosphere for Dawn to try to base going to high school on. When you contrast the normalcy of Buffy's own high school environment with what she provides for her little sister, her guardianship skills don't impress you.

Giles was really weak all season long, and I'm not sure why he was even there. He probably shouldn't have left early in season six when Buffy and Dawn still needed him. But when he returns, he doesn't seem to do so wholeheartedly. He isn't much help and in facts gets in Buffy's way. He doesn't even help Dawn with research or Willow with magic, and he basically just dumps the Potentials in Buffy's lap instead of training them as he once trained her. I don't know if Anthony Stewart Head was ambivalent about continuing with the role, but it was strange to see him listed as a guest star each and every week. If he was back, he should have been 100% back and been added to the opening credits again. Or he shouldn't have returned at all.

The most unbelievable moment of the season came when Kennedy, Willow, Giles, Xander, Dawn, and the Potentials staged a coup on Faith's behalf and not only ousted Buffy from the Slayer leadership position, but actually kicked her out of her own house! Not even Dawn has the right to do that, and certainly Kennedy doesn't. And I just don't think the Dawn, Xander, or Giles we've met before would have even tried this. It isn't as if Buffy had really gone off the rails insanely or had started acted like Captain Bligh. But there are no long-term effects of this coup. Faith and the Potentials quickly find that not all their troubles can be traced to Buffy. Buffy is basically rehabilitated without anyone ever saying anything specific. So why even put us through the whole ordeal in the first place?

And then right afterwards Buffy entrusts Dawn to Xander, telling him she can count on him. Well, as Spike put it, they were all ungrateful traitors, including Xander. How can Buffy count on anyone other than Spike, once they've all stabbed her in the back?

The ending was rather feeble, especially when contrasted with the season five finale, The Gift. Then, to save her sister, Buffy had to sacrifice herself. Now, to save the whole world, Buffy had to sacrifice...Anya. Plus one of Xander's eyes. Spike was lost, but that was a victory rather than a defeat as he gained redemption. Buffy came out the big winner, as she no longer bears the burden of being the solitary Chosen One. Not much of a price to pay for saving the world, when you come out considerably better off than you were before.

Nathan Fillion had been great as Captain Mal Reynolds on Joss Whedon's show Firefly, but his turn here as the fanatical preacher Caleb was poor. A hillbilly ex-reverend just doesn't mesh with the First. He was more a physical threat to Buffy and the gang than anything else, so why complicate things with poorly depicted religious details anyway? The season seven ""minions,"" the blind Bringers, were uninteresting and not very fearful. There was an ubervamp (which probably should have been called an ur-vamp), and then an army of them, but the one had proved much harder to kill than an entire army of them did.

Having Angel show up and offer to fight was fitting. Having Buffy reject his help out of pride was just silly. No one's going to turn anyone helpful away when the world is at stake, and in fact no one has the moral right to. It's not about Buffy, and the Buffy of seasons past would have realized this. Indeed, the Buffy of this season makes a lot of tiresome speeches about how it's all about the job, but then she herself sends Angel back to L.A. because she thinks it's all about her proving herself without his help! Absurd and un-Buffy like. And the ""cookie dough"" speech was both pompous and silly. Of course the writers had to deal with the known fact that Buffy's show was ending while Angel's was continuing with him and without her, but still. The whole thing could have been approached differently.

So what were the season's strong points, besides Andrew? Well, Emma Caulfield as Anya was entertaining as always. I don't like all of what the writers had Anya do, but Caulfield herself was superb. ""These girls are all going to die horribly,"" etc. Not the best nurse for scared, injured Potentials, but a great comedic talent besides being very attractive. Xander has really matured (other than in his role in the coup), and his brave acceptance of losing an eye was commendable. James Marsters as Spike as usual steals every scene he's in, though as I said, the ensouled Spike comes across as a bit of a wuss at first. At the series' end, the writers made it clear that Spike knew and accepted that Buffy didn't love him romantically (in an echo of an earlier scene with Riley), thus clearing the way for an eventual Angel-Buffy reunion.

As in season six, Michelle Trachtenberg as Dawn wasn't on screen nearly enough, but she excelled with what material she was allowed. Particularly good was the episode where she first found out she was likely a Potential, only to have her hopes of being special like Buffy be dashed. Without skipping a beat, she went back to the thankless but necessary task of research, and only Xander realized that for her something monumental had occurred. The scene where Xander expresses his admiration for her was great, although he starts out talking about himself a little too much. Dawn is far more mature and self-guided than Buffy and the Scoobies were at her age.

IMO, season seven is one of the poorer ones, exceeded only by season four in lack of interest. I put it behind season one despite that half-year's many flaws involving uneven writing and camera work. At least season one has youthful energy (and young actors), plus Angel and Cordelia. By season seven, everyone seems jaded by the whole thing. Maybe the show should have ended have season five after all, though there were indeed a number of great moments in season six and some in season seven that we then would never have been able to enjoy.",1153180800,12,15174,4.650876538604998
2137910,5,B0002XVKMC,"One of my all time favourite shows, my favourite seasons were 3 & 5 but all were great to watch. The character development was superb and Sarah Michelle Gellar is amazing.",1152921600,,171,4.548387096774194
2137911,4,B0002XVKMC,"Like most reviewers here, I love this show, but not necessarily this season.  For me it probably had a lot to do with very high expectations following the two previous amazing seasons.  I will say that 7 is still superior to 1 and 4.

I agree with what a lot of the reviewers are citing as this seasons weaknesses. The potentials were unlikable and stole valuable time away from the characters that we had grown to love.  Kennedy was especially lame and ruined Willow's final season for me.  The 'Big Bad' wasn't.  And even Faith, so visceral and thrilling in season 3, was oddly unaffecting. But most surprising was the cold-heartedness of the scoobies. Xander's flippant ""thats my girl"" comment following Anya's death.  Willow's ability to get over Tara with such a deadbeat as Kennedy.  Giles' overall grumpiness.  And how could Dawn turn her back on her own sister during the mutiny?  Maybe all that killing over the previous six seasons hardened their hearts.

I also found it a little sad to have so many newcomers getting so much face time in what should have been a season devoted to the main characters who had endured so much together.  I also feel the final episode should have been a 2 hour show.  This amazing series earned that right and it seems like JW just didn't have the necessary time needed to do right by his core characters.

But as always, sub-par Buffy is still better than most anything ever produced on television.  I especially thank Joss Whedon and Sarah Michelle Gellar (and the person(s) who invented DVD)for the endless hours of laughs, tears and  excitement that this show has given me and will continue to give me for years to come.",1152662400,6,1666,4.673539518900344
2137912,4,B0002XVKMC,"I always found the earlier 3 seasons stronger than 4, 5, 6 and 7. Although 4 has some fun and unforgettable episodes. Season 5 introduced Dawn, had Buffy's mom die of natural causes, had her lose Riley and eventually even die, so yeah that was depressing. Dawn was at least cute and a good addition to the show though. Season 6 was mostly silly and decided to be violent and serious in the last episodes of it's season. Season 7 is the last season since Sarah Michelle Gellar wanted to move on to do other parts ""laughs"".

  I forgot she played Daffney in Scooby Doo already and oh yeah wasn't she in that bad Grudge movie ? She needs to beg Joss to write and direct a Buffy movie because she needs face it that Buffy is what she does best. Anyway this isn't a 100% worthy last season but it's way better than season 6 at least. After Firefly was canceled Nathan Fillion jumped over to Buffy as some episodes as a slimy ""not literly slimy"" invinceable evil priest guy. He makes you hate him and want to see him get what's coming to him. He man handles potential slayers and kills them violently. Oh he also pokes out Xander's eye. This guy is pure evil and a worthy villian to the show. I'm still not sure where he got his powers from though, I guess the First just gave them to him or maybe it's the church wine lol. It's funny how Adam Baldwin from Firefly also was on the last season of Angel as an unstoppable agent. It also wasn't explained how he got his powers as well.

  The First by the way is the first evil ever and make itself look like anyone that is dead. It made an appearnce in season 3 and tried to get Angel to kill himself in the Christmas episode. Here it mostly trys to drive Spike mad by appearing to be Buffy ""since Buffy died once or twice if you count season 1 when she died for a minute or 2"". There's also a tougher breed of vampires that even Buffy has trouble with at first. So the last season at least has worthy villians.

  It's also nice seeing Faith ""the sexy Eliza Dushku"" back. She finally makes up with Buffy and helps train the potential Slayers. The potentials at first decide they rather have her as their leader than Buffy. Angel also appears in the last episode of the series and Spike gets jealous when the two kiss. While Angel is jealous that Spike now also has a soul and that he's closer to Buffy. Sarah could've at least repaid David by appearing in the last episode to help out instead of Angel just ending with him getting ready to have a big battle. Instead Angel just ended with it appearing that him and all his friends will die. While Buffy at least has a somewhat happy ending. Eventhough just like with Angel it left me wanting more.",1152144000,6,2690,4.269155206286837
2137913,5,B0002XVKMC,"""Buffy"" is my favorite TV show of all time and I was not disappointed by this final season. I loved the concept of  gathering the Potential Slayers from all around the world and the brilliant and final 'big bad'. What other show would think of taking a villian seen briefly in one episode of season 3 and making them the ultimate big bad for the show's last season? If you're a fan of the show, you realize that the final villian really couldn't have been anything else. In my opinion, this was one of the more thrilling and heart wrenching seasons of the show's run. There are some very shocking moments and the return of many of the fans' favorite characters. This season also features the fabulous Nathan Fillion from Joss Whedon's other show ""Firefly"" and the movie ""Serenity"". Some of the standout episodes are ""Conversations w/ Dead People"", ""First Date"", the hilarious ""Storyteller"", ""Lies My Parents Told Me"" and of course, the series finale. I wouldn't change much about this season as it and the series finale were a very satisfying ending to a wonderful show.",1149811200,3,1070,4.721925133689839
2137923,5,B0002XVKMC,"Buffy throughout the years has always give us entertainment and with this last season she proves to us that she's going out with a blast. This dvd pack comes with all the season 7 episodes that are truly great such as the first episode ""lessons"" which talk about the remaking of the hellmouth highschool that buffy had to destroy. Other episodes are with spike dealing with himself now that he has a soul. Then we still have the annoying dawn who doesn't seem to adjust to her crazy life with buffy this season also has the return of faith to help buffy with the hardest mission she'll ever face. I love this season because it reflects the first season which make it one of the best shows EVER.",1148083200,3,694,4.4296875
2137924,3,B0002XVKMC,"Buffy season seven is the weakest season of the series, but it is still above average television. The strength of the season lies not in the season's story arcs, but in some of the individual episodes. For example, ""Selfless"" artfully examines Anya's past and present life and reveals that she feels like she has never quite fit in as a human, but she no longer has the killer instinct to continue on in her second incarnation as a vengeance demon either. ""Conversations With Dead People"" ranks right up there with ""Hush"" in its scariness. The only way that this episode could have been improved upon is if Tara was the face of the ghost speaking to Willow, but with actress Amber Benson unwilling to reprise her role that season, it was really beyond the show's control. ""Storyteller"" is hilarious as Andrew narrates a film about the Scoobies, and ""Lies Your Parents Told You"" is another fine showcase of James Marsters' acting talent as we finally learn the source of the ""trigger"" that the First Evil has been using to control Spike.

Now for what is not good about this season... The series strong point- the growth and interaction of the main characters- is crowded out by the arrival of the potential slayers in episode ten. Giles return, which should have been a boost to the series, just muddled matters even more since he in no way resembles the character we have come to know in previous seasons. Other reviewers have referred to him as ""Pod Giles"", and I have to agree this moniker fits his season seven persona to a tee. Once the mystery of the season's ""big bad"" is revealed- an evil force that can take on the form of any dead person but cannot interact with the world around it- there is really no place else to go with this storyline as we do not have in the ""First Evil"" a villain worthy of reflection such as season three's Mayor or season two's Angelus. Kennedy, Willow's new love interest, is not a convincing actress, and the two's relationship falls flat. Although I would expect Willow to eventually get over Tara's death and move on with a new love interest, I could not figure out why THIS is the person she would choose to move on with. The two have absolutely no chemistry. Spike's big decision to regain his soul and his success at doing so is apparently explained by Buffy to the other main characters offscreen, and we viewers are denied the depth of treatment that revelation should have received. By episode eighteen, when the final story arc is launched, it seems that the writers and actors are phoning in their performances as they know the show will not be renewed for another season.

Then there are all of the plot holes and inconsistency in the writing. For example, according to Giles, after visiting the oracle of Beljoxa's Eye, the First Evil has appeared on the scene because of the slayer herself - because she has died and returned. But Buffy died the first time at the end of season one. So why has the First Evil waited all of this time to appear? In ""Showtime"" the ubervamps appear almost impossible to kill, so why by the finale are even the potentials slicing through them like butter? At first we are told that the seal over the Hellmouth is not opened by Jonathan's death because there is not enough blood. Then why are only a few drops of Spike's blood sufficient to do the job? Why does D'hoffryn decline to kill Anya at the conclusion of ""Selfless"", even at her request, but in later episodes has his minions trying to kill her? And the list goes on. Gross inconsistencies in the storyline such as this just didn't occur in previous seasons.

Finally, ""Chosen"", Joss Whedon's series finale, is mediocre when compared to shows from other seasons that he has written that did not have the importance that this final episode should have had, with a couple of exceptions. I did think that Whedon found a clever way to set Buffy free to live a normal life without her having to abandon her duties. I also liked the scene the day of the final battle with Buffy, Willow, and Xander, the original scoobies, having a conversation reminiscent of the closing scene of ""The Harvest"", which was the second part of the two-part premiere from season one. As they carry on their superficial banter about shopping, Giles repeats the same line that he said in this same situation in ""The Harvest"" - ""The world is doomed."" This was a real treat for long-time viewers and did indeed bring us ""back to the beginning"" - which was the theme of season seven.",1147305600,24,4489,4.601747815230961
2137925,5,B0002XVKMC,This ending season of Buffy was well worth it. They have worked hard to keep their status of being a popular pop culture show. I liked how they brought back sunnydale high and the hellmouth and the first it completes the full circle to finish what started. When they brought all those potential slayers into the hellmouth city I knew that it was gonna be the last ride. But when willow changed them all into slays instead of just 2 slayers so that they could prepare to fight the war between the uber vamps and slayers that had awaken everywhere. And when the fight was over sunnydale is sunnydale no more cuz the hellmoth collasped along with sunnydale. Buffy could retire now cuz she had completed her destiny.

2137928,5,B0002XVKMC,"Warning: this review contains spoilers! On the whole, a very good season. It was exciting and moving. The only real problem I had with it was that I thought character was sacrificed  in order to make things more ""dramatic"". A few examples that stick out to me as just Wrong: Giles conspiring with Robin Wood to kill Spike behind Buffy's back. I know Giles wasn't crazy about Spike, and he wondered if Spike could be completely trusted. Still, to lure Buffy away and stall her while he believed Spike was being killed by Wood was way too underhanded for Giles. He also knew that emotionally, Buffy relied on Spike. She would have been devastated by his murder at the hands of her""friends"". Also, Giles was way too fine a person to do such a thing. I know Giles was capable of being a little ruthless(he killed Ben when he was helpless and injured. But he knew Ben would soon morph into Glory and the whole thing would start again. There was no doubt about that. Someone had to kill Ben, and Giles did it himself in part to spare the others that decision.) He knew Ben was dangerous and would destroy them all. There was no doubt, so he took care of it himself. He only suspected Spike might me. He wasn't sure. And if he had made up his mind to kill Spike, I think he would have tried to do it himself, without conspiring and manipulating. Giles didn't like killing, and I don't think he would ever have been so cavalier about killing a man who he knew had a soul and had fought beside him more than once. Also,Giles, Willow, Xander, and Dawn kicking Buffy out of her own house and putting Faith in charge. That would never have happened, no matter how upset they were with her. It was such a betrayal. As developed, the characters loved her too much to ever do that. Maybe the writers did that to make Buffy and Spike closer, since he turned out to be the only one who stuck by her. But it wasn't believable. Finally, the climactic ""I Love You"". Buffy finally tells Spike, right before she knows he will die, sacrificing himself to save them all. Spike replied""No, you don't. But thanks for saying it.""  Wrong! Buffy did love Spike, it was so obvious. So much of season 7 was spent developing their trust and faith in each other. I'm not saying that the characters would have ended up together if the series had continued, maybe she ultimately would have picked Angel. But did she love Spike? Absolutely. her feelings for him were profound and strong. She loved him, relied on him, trusted him. And on some level, he had to know that. I almost think Joss Whedon just didn't want to give the viewers what we were expecting, which was ""Thank you. I love you too."" In this case however, what we expected would have been the right response. I think Joss was trying to have his cake and eat it too. You know, the big emotional moment, and the twist ending at the same time. It didn't work.

2137930,4,B0002XVKMC,"As a huge ""Buffy"" fan, I was both nervous and excited when I received the Seventh Season DVDs in the mail: nervous, because it was the final season - what if it wasn't good? And excited, because it WAS the final season, and traditionally, much happens during the final year of a TV show. I'd read reviews claiming that the season was terrible, so I began the season expecting to be a little disappointed.

But I wasn't. The first five episodes were terrific. They made me feel like I was back in the good ol' days of ""Buffy"", in the early seasons. ""Lessons"", the season opener, was great and filled with Joss Whedon's trademark wit (although he wrote the episode, he didn't direct it). ""Him"", while not the most brilliant episode, was very enjoyable (particularly a sequence towards the end of the episode, with some terrific music and editing). ""Conversations with Dead People"" was a great episode, thanks to numerous intriguing storylines and a fine script (not to mention a great performance by Jonathan Woodward as a talkative undead college student).

From there, it all went downhill.

Out of nowhere, the show's footing disappeared. The ""Potential Slayers"" were introduced, a group of whiney girls whom do nearly nothing for the storyline. For something like seven or eight episodes, we're forced to endure the training of the Potentials. Those eight or so episodes are some of the worst - and by far the hokiest - that the show has produced. The show's major comeback was the seventeenth episode, ""Lies My Parents Told Me"". It was a very interesting, cool, well-written episode, in which Principal Wood attempts to murder Spike for a crime he committed long ago. From there on, the show improved, but it still wasn't like it used to be.

The finale - ""Chosen"" - was one of the greatest episodes of the show. Written and directed by Joss Whedon, it's filled with great Whedon dialog, humor, and action. Whedon gives the show the dramatic, explosive, and very fitting ending the show so rightly deserved.

The two finer characters introduced in the season - Principal Robin Wood, and Caleb, the Evil Preacher - really improved the episodes (although Wood seemed to disappear in some of the later episodes). As I love Joss Whedon's sci-fi/western show ""Firefly"", I thought it was fantastic to see Nathan Fillion (the star of that show) appear on ""Buffy"" as Caleb.

Willow never really shines in this season until the final episode (you can tell Whedon loves her). Sarah Michelle Gellar does her best to work with the weak material she's given, as do the rest of the cast members.

The really horrible thing about this season is that there's a point where you just stop caring. You watch the episodes because you have to to complete the series. But the season is worth purchasing, if only for the first seven episodes and the last five episodes.

2137931,5,B0002XVKMC,"Hi

I bought this one because I couldn't watch this last season when it was broadcasted in Latinamerica. I have to admit that I found this season GOOD but not as good as the previous seasons. I think the story was kinda slow, I don't know, the very end was very good, the whole season is full of surprises and all that stuff, you definitely will get LOTS of surprises and a LOT of quality on this set.

The aspect ratio is the same of the tv broadcasting (4:3 full screen) and the quality of the picture is just excellent. The audio in Dolby Digital 2.1 is cool, you get surrounded in the fights (specially the series finale). The extras are MEGA cool.

I don't say too much about it cause i don't like to say ""spoilers"" to all that people who haven't seen this DVDs, Buy the set, you won't be disappointed.",1140307200,,807,4.261437908496732
2137932,5,B0002XVKMC,"This series started from a movie entitled ""Buffy-The Vampire Slayer"". The movie was wonderful and one that could measure up in cult status to ""Night of the Living Dead"" or ""Rocky Horror"".  This movie, however, was adapted to the small screen and it couldn't have been better written, acted or produced any better.  From season 1 thru season 7 each character was developed and their story lines entwined seamlessly. As a fan of the movie, I didn't think it possible to bring that same fun to TV, but is was.  I didn't even want to start watching it because I knew that it wouldn't measure up.  Well, guess I was wrong.  After catching some episodes while channel surfing, I started paying attention to the times it aired. It all went up hill from there.  My husband even became addicted to it.  We would plan our days around ""Buffy-The Vampire Slayer"".  We watched it on the WB for 3 full airings from season 1 to season 4-which takes months in TV time. The the WB started showing season 5, 6 and 7. Now the time has come to buy each season to have at home.  Not to watch everyday mind you, but to have when we need a break and want to immerse ourselves in the lives of Buffy, Willow, Zander and Giles. There was even a spinoff with ""Angel"" that is just a addictive.",1140220800,3,1265,4.371794871794871
2137952,5,B0002XVKMC,The Buffy episodes in this and in all of the seasons are both entertaining and learning experiences. I recommend them for everyone except the very young.,1138665600,,153,4.923076923076923
2137953,3,B0002XVKMC,"I was a fan of the show when the first 3 seasons initially aired on cable, and rediscovered it on DVD recently. While all of the later seasons were somewhat disappointing, season 7 was downright awful compared to what the show was at its inception.

The great thing about Buffy initially was the strong character development, the combination of comedy, drama and horror, quirky language, and, most importantly, the ways that the sci-fi aspects of the show could be understood as metaphors of the trials and tribulations of adolescence. The show was grounded in the characters, their relationships and their environment. By season 7, however, that environment completely disappears. None of the main characters seem to do anything anymore. Buffy and Willow are no longer in school, Giles has no occupation, even Xander is barely seen working. They all live in some weird communal arrangement in Buffy's house. We barely ever see them at the Bronze anymore. Whereas many of the high-school-era episodes had stand-alone stories involving other kids from high school, there doesn't seem to be anybody outside of the main Scooby circle anymore. It is as if the world no longer exists outside of the inner circle, and this development culminates in the mass exodus from Sunnydale towards the end. During the high school years, as well as season 4, Buffy and Co. had to struggle with the demons, while maintaining a 'normal' existence - dealing with other people, classes, curfews, etc. The fantastic aspects of the show were firmly grounded in the real. In season 7 there is only fantasy, and there is no reference to the real world anymore.

Anyway, I could go on here, but I'll just list some things that really drive me crazy about season 7 (some of them can be traced back to seasons 5 and 6, too): Willow, who was my all-time favourite TV character, is forced completely out of character through a series of transformations that are as no more necessary than they are plausible; the Buffy-whipped Spike is just lame (and the old Spike was as cool as it gets); Buffy is no longer sweet, no longer funny, no longer vulnerable (she's gone from a complex and compelling character to a one-dimensional one - a real waste of SMG's abilities); the First is, by far and away, the most boring of all Buffy Big Bads - it barely even qualifies as a 'character'; Principal Wood is horrible character; don't even get me started on the Potentials (what was that all about - I have no idea); after ending season 6 with Buffy's ""oh Dawn, all I wanna do is show you the world and watch you become a woman"", Dawn gets completely marginalized in season 7; etc.

Season 7 is only worth buying if you are, like myself, a devoted fan of the show, and want to complete your collection. There are, of course, a few episodes that are fun to watch. Andrew is phenomenal, Caleb is really great (wish he appeared earlier), Anya rocks as much as ever.",1135987200,12,2921,4.723529411764706
2137954,5,B0002XVKMC,"I loved Season 7.  The only season I possibly loved more would be Season 6, but the two really work in tandem.  In Season 6, everything it torn apart.  Relationships self-destruct, characters lose their footing, and it breaks your heart to watch.  Season 7 is all about rebuilding.  Buffy and Spike make their peace with each other and it's one of the most beautiful stories of forgiveness and love from two characters who hurt each other deeply in the past.  Buffy and Dawn rediscover their sisterly bonds.  Dawn stops whining and becomes a productive member of the team.  Xander grows up, learns to stop judging Buffy so harshly, and comes to terms with his messy relationship with Anya.  Anya comes full circle, making the decision to truly be human, and to learn to live life with her own sense of self.  Willow recovers from her downfall in Season 6 and finally learns to use all of her powers in order to help save the world instead of end it.

It's a fabulous, moving season.  And a wonderful end for one of the greatest television shows of all-time.",1134259200,4,1057,4.593582887700535
2137955,4,B0002XVKMC,"I disagree with other reviewers. Season 6 was Buffy's worst season with meandering story lines and unconvincing villians. An evil Willow was a step too far in my opinion. Season 5 had been a bit indifferent as well, the low point in Australia was when the Season 5 episodes were too slow (around the time of Joyce's death) that they screened Hush from Season 4.

This season is very dark, like Season 5 and the siege-feeling pervades.  But it has better storylines and a more convincing villain. It was good to see Buffy come back to form before it ended.  The show really peaked in Season 3 and never quite recaptured the humour of seasons 1 and 2, but they certainly produced some good episodes in the later years.",1134086400,,716,4.534883720930233
2137956,5,B0002XVKMC,"I have read an absolute ton of criticism on this product, and I can't really argue with it, because hey, to each his own. But in order to argue over the worth of a television show (or any work of art, really), you have to set aside personal preferences and look at how the show suceeded with what it wanted to do.

The point of this season was twofold. Joss Whedon is, of course, famous for using each season as a metaphor to explore various parts of human existence; this season is no different. Not only did he bring the entire Slayer mythology and Buffy's story full circle, but he also showed just how much Buffy and her friends had grown in the past seven years.

We're told what the season will be like in the first episode, when the First Evil informs a tortured Spike that ""that's where we're going...right back to the beginning"". The decision to bring to mind the old high school days of ""Buffy"" is an oft-criticized one; many people claim that the 7th season was too unfocused. Others say it didn't have as much humor. I disagree.

The 7th season had an amazing amount to tackle in a short period of time. This season didn't focus on the Big Bad--it focused on the reasons behind the Big Bad. Why do we have evil--why is the Slayer there to fight it? Can Buffy ever overcome her destiny? What is good, anyway, and what is evil? These questions are answered by the characters and their interactions, as well as such superb episodes as ""Get It Done"".

Speaking of which...why is that such an underrated episode? It's one of the only ones that ever confronts the inherent darkness of the show, and it also shows two of the shows central characters--Spike and Buffy--learning to accept their own darkness.

Anyway...

There's a similar arguement for people who say the show didn't have enough humor. Buffy grew up, guys. She's not quipping as much any more because she's an adult. In the place of flippant jokes and shallow interaction, we get more dynamic relationships and deeper characterization. Apparently, that didn't sit too well with a lot of fans; personally, I enjoyed it.

Basically, by going full circle, ""Buffy"" departed from anything it had ever done before, on to bigger--and in my opinion, better--things. If you enjoy shows that will take you for a ride on the emotional roller coaster while also giving you some excellent fight scenes and humor, then buy this DVD. You won't be disappointed.",1133568000,4,2415,4.6416861826697895

2137958,4,B0002XVKMC,"As a huge ""Buffy"" fan, I was both nervous and excited when I received the Seventh Season DVDs in the mail: nervous, because it was the final season - what if it wasn't good?  And excited, because it WAS the final season, and traditionally, much happens during the final year of a TV show.  I'd read reviews claiming that the season was terrible, so I began the season expecting to be a little disappointed.

But I wasn't.  The first five episodes were terrific.  They made me feel like I was back in the good ol' days of ""Buffy"", in the early seasons.  ""Lessons"", the season opener, was great and filled with Joss Whedon's trademark wit (although he wrote the episode, he didn't direct it).

2137960,5,B0002XVKMC,"I think the problem with Buufy season seven was change. The people didn't want change but it had to happen. We see Buffy try to act as a leader and the other characters start to step up to be adults in this season as well. Willow was still in denial of what she had done the previous season and it was hard for her to cope with the loss of Tara but she came through. Even Xander started to act like a leader and really provided motivation for the potentials.

Season 7 is mainly about the end of the world as Buffy, Willow, Xander, Dawn, Spike, Giles, and Anya begin to learn how to fight the First that has come to Sunnydale. Perhaps the biggest change is that Spike gets his soul back and he continues in his quest to win Buffy's love. Along the way they pick up Andrew who spends most of the time as a hostage, and the potential slayers who get trained to take on evil that awaits them. Faith also comes back to aid the Scoobies for their final fight.

What I really think was the problem about season 7 was that people didn't want to see their show change but it went out with a purpose rather than going out with some stupid plot that originated for the final three episodes. I think it was a great way to end the show and I hope all of you that have seen the first six season give this one a chance because it is a great ending to a great show.",1128988800,3,1350,4.071428571428571

True, the potentials were annoying, but the thing that drives me nuts through this season is the character of Kennedy, Willow's new girlfriend. In my opinion, Willow fell in love with both Oz and Tara because of their personalities, not because of what gender they belonged to. Both of those relationships, while hard in places, were extremely special, warm and kind.

I don't believe for one second Willow would have gotten together with Kennedy, or that Kennedy was so trained right from the start that she was allowed to train the new potentials. I think if anyone should have been, it should have been Xander (because of his mental military training).

I wish the creators would have been able to bring both Tara and Oz back for the final season so that Willow could be happy and relaize she did not need to be in a relationship to be happy or be complete, she, like everyone else in the show, has her friends and her own heart to keep her warm.

The ending was brilliant though. I didn't know how they could end the show without killing Buffy off since technically she would have to keep fighting long after the show, but the ending they chose felt right and made the series feel complete.",1125619200,2,1400,4.5
2137972,3,B0002XVKMC,"Buffy season seven is the weakest season of the series, but it is still above average television. The strength of the season lies not in the season's story arcs, but in some of the individual episodes. For example, ""Selfless"" artfully examines Anya's past and present life and reveals that she feels like she has never quite fit in as a human, but she no longer has the killer instinct to continue on in her second incarnation as a vengeance demon either. ""Conversations With Dead People"" ranks right up there with ""Hush"" in its scariness. The only way that this episode could have been improved upon is if Tara was the face of the ghost speaking to Willow, but with actress Amber Benson unwilling to reprise her role that season, it was really beyond the show's control. ""Storyteller"" is hilarious as Andrew narrates a film about the Scoobies, and ""Lies Your Parents Told You"" is another fine showcase of James Marsters' acting talent as we finally learn the source of the ""trigger"" that the First Evil has been using to control Spike.

Now for what is not good about this season... The series strong point- the growth and interaction of the main characters- is crowded out by the arrival of the potential slayers in episode ten. Giles return, which should have been a boost to the series, just muddled matters even more since he in no way resembles the character we have come to know in previous seasons. Other reviewers have referred to him as ""Pod Giles"", and I have to agree this moniker fits his season seven persona to a tee. Once the mystery of the season's ""big bad"" is revealed- an evil force that can take on the form of any dead person but cannot interact with the world around it- there is really no place else to go with this storyline as we do not have in the ""First Evil"" a villain worthy of reflection such as season three's Mayor or season two's Angelus. Kennedy, Willow's new love interest, is not a convincing actress, and the two's relationship falls flat. Although I would expect Willow to eventually get over Tara's death and move on with a new love interest, I could not figure out why THIS is the person she would choose to move on with. The two have absolutely no chemistry. Spike's big decision to regain his soul and his success at doing so is apparently explained by Buffy to the other main characters offscreen, and we viewers are denied the depth of treatment that revelation should have received. By episode eighteen, when the final story arc is launched, it seems that the writers and actors are phoning in their performances as they know the show will not be renewed for another season.

Then there are all of the plot holes and inconsistency in the writing. For example, according to Giles, after visiting the oracle of Beljoxa's Eye, the First Evil has appeared on the scene because of the slayer herself - because she has died and returned. But Buffy died the first time at the end of season one. So why has the First Evil waited all of this time to appear? In ""Showtime"" the ubervamps appear almost impossible to kill, so why by the finale are even the potentials slicing through them like butter? At first we are told that the seal over the Hellmouth is not opened by Jonathan's death because there is not enough blood. Then why are only a few drops of Spike's blood sufficient to do the job? Why does D'hoffryn decline to kill Anya at the conclusion of ""Selfless"", even at her request, but in later episodes has his minions trying to kill her? And the list goes on. Gross inconsistencies in the storyline such as this just didn't occur in previous seasons.

Finally, ""Chosen"", Joss Whedon's series finale, is mediocre when compared to shows from other seasons that he has written that did not have the importance that this final episode should have had, with a couple of exceptions. I did think that Whedon found a clever way to set Buffy free to live a normal life without her having to abandon her duties. I also liked the scene the day of the final battle with Buffy, Willow, and Xander, the original scoobies, having a conversation reminiscent of the closing scene of ""The Harvest"", which was the second part of the two-part premiere from season one. As they carry on their superficial banter about shopping, Giles repeats the same line that he said in this same situation in ""The Harvest"" - ""The world is doomed."" This was a real treat for long-time viewers and did indeed bring us ""back to the beginning"" - which was the theme of season seven.",1124755200,,4489,4.601747815230961
2137973,5,B0002XVKMC,"Season 7 was a dark mix with Faith returning to the show and the welcome influx of characters like the preacher played by Nathan Fillion. The idea of ""THE FIRST"" taking on the physical appearance of people who have already died is sheer brilliance. Spike is central to many a great episode and comes full circle when in the series finale he saves Buffy, the scoobies, the new slayers, and the world from an evil greater than we could imagine. Buffy is tougher than ever as the general to the slayer army. But she shows her warm side too as she recognizes Spike's willingness to fight and die to help her. She offers up her love in an unforgettable scene where he thanks her and realizes his world is ending. Kudos to writer Joss Whedon in one of the most unforgettable of series endings . .  coming in second only to his other series Angel which ended in blazing glory at the end of season 5. A Buffy or Angel movie would be a blessing . . . stories so marvelously written don't come along often enough . . . let's hope that someone with the power to, pushes Joss to keep these stories alive.

So sad that this was the final season but at least it can live on forever on DVD and syndicated TV reruns!",1123027200,2,528,4.29
2137975,3,B0002XVKMC,"But even an average season of Buffy is better than most of the shows on television ever. So, I think there are so factors that made me give it only three stars:

1) First of all, Kennedy is annoying. Unbearable. One of the worst characters ever to feature in the show. She can't even come close to Tara. Each line, each second on screen with her made me want to turn off the TV / DVD;

2) Ok, with that out of my chest, I can go on. Knowing that show would end, maybe the producers thought it would be a good idea to make the fans dislike Buffy's character, so they would not miss her once the show was over! Because Buffy becomes sometimes very, VERY annoying in Season 7.

3) I don't know what was Nicolas Brendon's reaction when he began reading the scripts for season 7. He must have tought: ""Where the hell am I?"". Yes, because Xander is practically erased from the history, along with Dawn, Anya, Giles and even Willow in the first episodes. Our beloved Scoobie Gang is given a less than just treatment in the last season. Their screen time was virtually eradicated due to that infinite number of Potentials. Ok, the POtentials were the plausible reason to explain that Buffy would not need to be the Chosen One forever (or until she died), but the Potentials were lame, lame, lame. I never cared for any one of them, even for the ones who died.

4) The death of Anya. My God, Emma Caulfied must have done something wrong to the producers. How can such a charismatic and sweet character be killed in such a brief way, with no drama,no tears being drawn by her friends, nothing? By the way, as someone below wrote, by season's end it seems all Scoobie Gang had became worse people, instead of better people!! As if it was possible, sometime along the season some of the magic empathy and love the audience had learned to share with these characters seemed to vanish!!

5) Plot holes and suspense of credulity were always fundamental characteristics of the show, so I was used to it. But this season reached an all time low in this category.... How can a city be evacuated, and no authority says anything? Where is the media? Where is State police, Federal police, the Army, where is anyone who would check why the entire population of a city is leaving it?!!!

6)Good points: the return of Faith; Spike (as always); Principal Wood. It's amazing (even due to forces beyond his control) how Spike in a frenzied access of carnage killed more than a dozen people in small Sunnydale!! It seems Joss made that things on purpose, justo to annoy us. Once we began to feel ""relieved"" that Spike had a soul, that he would once and for all be a faithful member of the Scoobies, he made him kill (I repeat) dozen of people, and bury them, acting like the most insane and sadistic serial killer! And Buffy doesn't care the leat for the victims, the families of the victims or whatever. All she cares about is Spike. This brings me a funny question: all these murders would be classified as ""NOT SOLVED"" forever in the Police files?

All in all, I think this is one of the greatest shows ever, but I think Joss Whedon's arrogance won at the end and, guyided by the need to ""innovate"" always, he made stupid decisions a lot of times, to the point that I felt happy that the show ended before my dissapointment grew...",1121731200,4,3307,4.447194719471947
2137976,5,B0002XVKMC,"Since Buffy first began i watched every single episode, and i mean all of them! And this without a doubt was the best ending anyone could possibly ever think of. Well done Joss!! The Whole season has you crying (lots), laughing and guessing. I adore the moments between Buffy and Spike in this season, they're so moving. Especially when Buffy tells him she loves him. The idea about the potentials was pure genius. And I loved the episode when Buffy found out how the first slayer was made. The very last episod was so strong and moving, I was so happy when angel came back to ask Buffy if she wanted help. It was great!! but be warned you will need a box of tissues handy. This episode when the first sends his army of uber vampires after the gang has wonderful special effects and it keeps you guessing as to whats going to happen next. It's the perfect cliffhanger. Buy it!! Its so good.",1120953600,5,890,4.4
2137977,4,B0002XVKMC,"The first time I really got into Buffy The Vampire Slayer was during the summer of 2000 when I had just moved house. In those five years it has gone on to easily become my favourite television show all time. Nothing will ever take its place, because Buffy is clever and different on a number of levels. I was sad when the news broke that Season Seven was to be the final series, but I think in many ways I - like many other millions of fans - knew it was time to end it before it went stale. Therefore, we all had high expectations for Season Seven, so what went wrong?

In my opinion, this season of Buffy is very good and in contrast to many other television shows, it is truly stellar. However, there was something about Season Seven that didn't make as interesting or gripping as previous seasons. I have to say that even though there are many good episodes in this season, this is the worst season of all seven. I loved Season Six, so to go from that to this was slightly disappointing for me. I believe Joss Whedon's vision remained clear until the very end, but something went wrong in this season which I believe is due to the fact that the writers and producers were too pre-occupied with creating something so epic that they forgot the core of the show: the strength between Buffy and her circle of friends in times of crisis.

The Big Bad of this season is The First. It can't take corporal form which means no one can fight it, but only its minions. Compared to other Big Bads, The First is very poor. We had Evil Willow and Glory in previous series who were both amazing, while The First has to employ The Bringers to attack the Slayer. The Bringers are so boring it's unbelievable, and I think the producers and writers were hoping that The First would keep viewers interested because it can take the form of Buffy. However, after the fifth time it becomes very boring knowing that The First can manipulate others to its own advantage. In previous seasons, we had a mixture of episodes that involved the personal stories of the Scooby Gang and also the build up to the big finale. One such example is Season 5 where Buffy's mom dies in ""The Body."" This is a personal tragedy totally unrelated to Glory's determination to find The Key, but subsequent episodes return to the drama of the season's main theme. Every single episode after ""Conversations"" in this season is about The First, and no offence, but it becomes quite boring. Buffy's grandiose speeches, Andrew's tired jokes and Willow's forced 'relationship' with Kennedy become mediocre. Characters such as Anya and Xander don't have a place anymore, and only serve to fill up episode time.

Part of the season's strength lies in Spike, whose new soul causes him torment at the hands of The First. This story plays a big part in the first ten episodes of the season, but it isn't overdone or drawn out. More importantly, I felt compelled to keep watching to find out how things worked out for him. I also like the development between Buffy and Spike. From seething hatred in Season 2, through to his crush on her in Season 5, and their sexual escapades in Season 6, the two characters have come full circle. They both have mutual respect for one another, and what is interesting is how Buffy has changed such a powerful vampire. There is always a thick line if irony running through the show, which is seen in Season 2 as Buffy falls in love with Angel. As Giles puts it, ""A vampire in love with a Slayer. It's rather poetic.""

The aim of Season Seven was to inject ""much-needed comic relief"" after the harshness of Season Six, and for the most part it works. ""Lessons,"" ""Beneath You,"" ""Same Time Same Place,"" ""Help"" and ""Him"" are five really great episodes that deal with a number of issues such as Spike's return, his subsequent insanity, Willow's return to Sunnydale, the rebuilding of Sunnydale High School, and the trouble that is brewing in the Hellmouth. These episodes aren't too heavy and are quite light, and work very well in my opinion. ""Selfless"" is one of the season's best episodes, and has stellar acting performances from Sarah Michelle Gellar, Alyson Hannigan and Emma Caulfield. ""Conversations With Dead People"" is incredible as many fans will tell you.

From here on the episodes become more generic and boring. The arrival of The Potential Slayers really doesn't help, because there's too many of them. With Buffy being such an intimate and emotional show, the fans are content and happy with the main characters (Buffy, Willow, Xander, Spike, Dawn, Giles, Anya) but the addition of all these young women is just too much. I can't really remember any of their names (apart from Kennedy, who is very boring) and this is because I don't care for them. I'm too focused on the main characters, and I think it was a big mistake for the writers to add all these potential Slayers half way through the season. There are still some good episodes such as ""Lies My Parents Told Me,"" ""Storyteller"" and ""Get It Done."" The arrival of the Turok-Han is pitiful and incredibly dull. We have to endure two full episodes, ""Bring On The Night"" and ""Showtime,"" where Buffy and all her friends struggle to fight just one of these original vampires. How come they pick them off in seconds in the final episode then? Yeah, we're told it's because of the scythe that Buffy removes from Caleb's lair and that the Slayers have become 'imbued' with the power of all would-be Slayers around the world. Hmmm, how convenient that this happens just as the Hellmouth opens. Plus, how come the whole of Sunnydale evacuates town just a few episodes before the final episode? To me it seems highly unlikely that everyone would just leave when demons and vampires are kept secret from the public.

I also have a bit of trouble in one of the final episodes where every character seems to be having sex, and why we have to endure about 10 minutes of it. Anya and Xander have sex, but for me that's not enough. They should have got back together so that we could have at least been left with the illusion that they would get married at some point in the future. However, I guess this was pointless as Anya died in the final episode in such a poor way. Faith's return seemed rather forced too, and her sexcapades with Principal Wood were uncalled for. I was also annoyed at Willow making love to Kennedy because Tara 'would want her to move on.' Tara and Willow were one of the show's best ever couples and I think messing with that was a bad thing. Kennedy is flat and boring, whereas Tara was sensitive and caring. Maybe I'm just bitter, I don't know. Also to the reviewer who was disgusted by two women kissing, I suggest you switch Buffy off and go back to your fanatical religious beliefs about how women should be with men and no one else and stop trying to force them onto us more open-minded citizens.

All in all I think this season was good in parts but pretty bad in others. ""Chosen"" is a great episode on its own, but stacked against previous season finales like ""The Gift,"" ""Becoming Part II"" and ""Restless,"" it pales in comparison. Buffy was an incredible show and for seven seasons it gripped me like nothing else. I'm glad the show ended at Season Seven because it was the right time to go. The legacy is preserved now and this show should rightfully be hailed as one of the Top 10 TV Shows in history.",1120953600,5,7369,4.548605877920121
2137978,3,B0002XVKMC,"Season 7 stands as the season when Joss Whedon and Company appeared to be afraid to do anything, in their efforts to try to appease everyone... while simultaneously denying everyone anything of worth.  The result is a season that is far less than it could have been.

Buffy as a ""feminist"" figure is a joke.  She's emotionally stunted, probably emotionally crippled.  She's an impersonal leader who throws pencils idly at the ceiling while those close to her are tortured, and when someone she's supposed to mentor kills herself, she treats the memory of the poor dead girl with less respect than one gives the burial of a dead pet hamster.

Willow's crimes in Season 6 are completely swept under the carpet.  Xander has no story at all.  And Giles has been taken over by a pod person.

The only real highlights of the season continue to be the character of Spike as Marsters turns in an amazing performance in the final minutes of the episode ""Beneath You.""  His ""Can we rest now?""  resonates sadly, and perhaps voices Whedon and companies own feelings for the season.

The highlights of Season 7 are basically the waning minutes/the church scene with Spike in the episode ""Beneath You"" and the funny Viking stuff in the episode ""Selfless"" (which ends a sad scene with Anya and Xander).  The subplot of Wood and Spike has some merit in that at least it IS a comprehensible story given to two of the few actors not phoning in performances for the season.  And there's some humor to be found in Andrew's twisted observations in the episode highlighting his character.

Overall, though, the season is meandering and mostly pointless.  The First Evil is a disappointing villain who does little more than talk.  Caleb as a villain is a walking BAD cliche.  And the final episode is quite simply infuriating.  Buffy's plan is tactically ridiculous.  The ""feminist"" metaphor they were going for is contradictory.  Buffy's flitting between Angel and Spike just makes her appear sonewhat vapid and insincere.  The truly sad thing is, if Buffy was a series about growing up, then Buffy's pronouncement that she's just unbaked cookie dough shows that she never grew up at all.

Insult is added to injury when after leading many potentials to their deaths and leaving long time allies Anya and Spike to die, Buffy and friends end up mourning the MALL, leaving Buffy and her friends to appear to have lost their souls somewhere along the way.  I liked Buffy and the Scoobs better in the early years.  By the end of Season 7 I found myself half-heartedly wishing that the Scoobs had died and the far more lively and moving Anya and Spike had lived.

All in all, love Spike, love Anya.  Occasionally amused by Andrew.  Tolerate Xander.  Wonder what in the HECK happened to the Giles I once loved because this wasn't him.  And wish never to lay eyes on Buffy again as she turned out to be a disappointing 'heroine.'",1120521600,14,2900,4.73253493013972
2137979,4,B0002XVKMC,"BTVS is a great series, and I own all seven seasons on DVD.  With that said, I have to add that Season Seven was the weakest season of the series, or at least the weakest complete season.  Here are the problems I see in Season Seven (SPOILER ALERT! Also some peppery language):

1) Residual Season One lameness.  For some reason, ME took Season One as the model for at least the first part of Season Seven, sending us back into monster-of-the-week, cheesy-teenage-angst hell.  The writing seemed to have returned to Season One standards also, especially notable in ""Lessons"" and ""Him.""  ""Him"" would be my pick for worst episode ever (supplanting ""The Puppet Show"") if not for Michelle Trachtenberg's performance.  Compare the humor and plot-logic to the episode it ripped off, ""Bewitched, Bothered, and Bewildered,"" - but no, don't get me started on that.  And Gnarl of ""Same Time, Same Place"" has to get the award for all-time most plot-convenient villain - immune to magic, kills his victims by skinning them, does this very slowly so the heroes can catch up, and even talks to himself so we have something to listen to while Willow lies there paralyzed.

2) Residual Season One themes.  The central theme of Season Seven is, ""Can Buffy Win?""  Well, hello, we've watched the series for six seasons and we know damned well that Buffy's going to win.  There may have been some suspense in that theme in Season One, but there's none in Season Seven.  Starting with ""Bring On the Night,"" we get the same cycle over and over.  Bad guy is too tough for Buffy to fight - Buffy figures out a way to defeat bad guy - look out, here comes a new too-tough bad guy.  Which naturally leads to,

3) Villain lameness.  The First is fun, especially because so many of our favorite characters, old and current, can play him (it?).  But like the Mayor, he (it?) can't fight his (oh, I give up) own battles.  And the secondary villains are from hunger.  Caleb is way too on-the-nose as a misogynist redneck religious fanatic.  The Bringers are as interesting as cold oatmeal.  And the Turok-Han, OMG.  Accompanying the complete lack of motive and personality is a howling gap in the logic.  Neanderthal vampires that predated vampires and are/were vastly more powerful?  Where did they all go, then?  Did the less powerful vampires who are supposed to be terrified of them kill them all off?  When?  How?  And where did The First find an army of them standing around waiting for a good apocalypse?  Neanderthal humans were killed off by Cro Magnon humans who were smarter and more vicious, but that parallel seems not to apply.  The sad thing is that the whole dilemma could have been solved by saying that the Turok Han were the demon species that created vampires in the first place (remember, vampires were originally a crossbreed between demons and humans), after which they went back to their home demon dimension.  It still wouldn't make them interesting.

4) The one-note mood of doom and gloom, especially after ""Conversations With Dead People.""  Previous reviewers have noted this, so I won't elaborate further, except to note that this mood seems to be a direct result of ME's decision to try to persuade us that maybe Buffy won't win this time (again, ""Can Buffy Win?"" possibly not the best possible theme for Season Seven).

5) Forced and too-convenient changes in characters and their motives, apparently to steer the individual character arcs to where ME wanted them for the big wrap-up.  The main exhibit here is the huge zonking lie about Spike's soul - that he went to the cave demon in the first place in order to get it.  But those of us who watched the last four episodes of Season Six know good and well that he went to get his chip removed or deactivated and that the demon played bait-and-switch with him because it didn't like his attitude.  Somebody must have thought that Spike would be more sympathetic and acceptable as a hero if he got his soul on purpose, but there is absolutely nothing in his mood, manner, or motives at the end of Season Six to suggest any such thing.  Simple mind experiment - imagine that Spike had announced in ""Seeing Red"" that he was off to Africa to get a soul so that he could be worthy of Buffy.  Would any of us have believed this for a second?  Would it not have seemed utterly contrived and hopelessly lame in that context?  And yet that's the context in which it is supposed to have happened.  Joss Whedon can talk about misleads all he wants - the obvious fact is that they wrote themselves into a corner and tried to prevaricate their way out.

 That said, there are some bright spots, as one would have to expect (even substandard Buffy is pretty darned good television).  I liked all of ""Conversations With Dead People"" except the Dawn story.  There was never any explanation of that sequence - it wasn't The First, who can't touch or affect anything in the material world.  ""Selfless"" was no ""Fool For Love,"" but it was pretty good anyway.  ""Get It Done"" told us something I had always suspected - that the Slayer power was something dark and evil, that Buffy was heroic in spite of it and not because of it.  My take on ""The Gift"" is that Buffy got it wrong - ""Death is your gift"" was meant by the First Slayer exactly the way Buffy understood it the first time - but by getting it wrong she heroically transcended the Slayer's fate of kill and kill and die trying to kill (the series is full of other examples of Buffy making it better by getting it wrong).

 I like the ending itself.  It neatly cut the Gordian knot of Buffy's central dilemma throughout the series - how to be The Slayer and be human at the same time (now she's just a Slayer).  And the beauty of it is that, far from assuring a future of rainbows and roses, it actually creates a huge mess with the potential for many movie and spinoff plot lines.  A thousand slayers and only one Watcher!  Imagine several dozen Faiths (a la Season Three) and you'll see what I'm talking about, plus the damage someone like Ethan Rayne could do pretending to be a Watcher.  I felt bad for Xander - he suffered the most and gained the least of anybody.  Anya died, by the way, because Emma Caulfield didn't want to play her any more and didn't want anyone else to play her.  Kennedy is a better match for Willow than Tara - though I loved Tara, her relationship with Willow was always too one-sided.  Excepting Anya and Spike, all the characters were brought to a point where we could happily imagine their futures (or happily contemplate future BTVS projects) without tying them up in a final bow like, oh, say, Angel The Series did.",1120089600,12,6639,4.581000848176421
2137980,4,B0002XVKMC,"This season is a very dark and serious season. It aint romantic, it isn't funny, and sure is depressing; i cried alot. Its the end, what can be expected when you end a series after seven great years.

In this season you get the feel of what one slayer; Buffy that is is really worth. What she has done to save the world. What a great leader she is. Even when she is lonely, and weak she sure only think of the mindkind.

Along with Buffy we have the other charactesrs. Willow is a good witch again. They all fight the First. There are some surprises and some loses of souls.

There are many new characters and new kinds of evils introduced.

All in all, you can always cound on Buffy to save the world. again",1118966400,3,708,4.1838235294117645
2137981,4,B0002XVKMC,"The final season of Buffy parallels the 5th season in that both seemed to have been mapped out pretty well to tell one continuous story in most of the episodes (with a few exceptions).

The basic premise of the last season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer was that ""the First Evil"" was prepared to bring about an apocalypse (in the Buffy universe, the apocalypse isn't something that comes only once). The premise was good, the build-up was good, and the pay-off in the end was fine. The only major problem was that too much was crammed in too quickly and the last season felt rushed. Also, the one-off episodes (what few there were), were not very good, particularly ""Him"".

Compared to previous seasons, many of the characters experienced reasonable emotional growth (particularly Buffy, Faith, Spike, and Xander). There were a few character-based blunders though which seemed to be excuses for extra love scenes. The relationship between Willow and Kennedy was forced and seemed merely an excuse to show two women kissing as much as possible. It isn't that Willow should have become a nun after her former lover died but rather that there was not enough chemistry between the actresses/characters to believe in instant passion and no exploration of a personality-based link. This was a storyline that the show should simply have not pursued and it would have allowed for more time for other stories and made the season feel less rushed.

A lot of fans hated the final season compared to other seasons but a lot of that was because of the viewers' individual idiosyncracies based on their emotional identification with and projection upon various characters That is to say, they were upset when the characters didn't do, say, and have happen to them what they wanted to have happen to them. A viewer who lacks these sorts of expectations of the characters and who is focussing on the storylines, dialog (which is quite well-written), and characters who you feel for (rather than feel about), will find the entire season quite entertaining.",1118620800,4,2036,4.930029154518951

She is STRONG actress who deserved better !

3. Potentials -- annoying -- scattered -- not convincing - who casted these misfits?

4. Buffy/Spike  or Buffy/Angel --- PICK ONE !

5. The First --- Caleb --- oh my god ... could he have been

more BORING ... unconvincing as a Big Bad ...my granmom could have taken him!!!  They should have resurrected the Master's Bones as a more believable series ending !!

Everything you ever wanted to know about Buffy, cast, The Brilliant creator, Joss Whedon and other staff members. I not only highly recommend this Season disk set, but the other six seasons as well. Quite a bit of quality work went into the making of all seven seasons. They are a necessary buy for any Buffy fan! It's completely impossible to be anything but extremely pleased with this purchase as well as the rest of the series. The writing, acting, directing, etc... are extraordinary. This is feature film quality at it's finest, instead of the plain old TV quality that most people expect. Each episode is like watching a movie. The last five episodes build to a finale that is as amazing as any feature film that I have never before seen on television. The final episode was extraordinary, the writing, the premise was ingenious. The acting was the usual above average talent. I believe that the music that Rob Duncan provided was the icing on the cake and made the episode EPIC. It was brilliant music. Of all seven seasons this is truly my favorite.

and now watching these back to back without a week or sometimes several in between, I've gotta say that like S6, I'm much more into them the 2nd time around. Since I know where it's going and all of the major twists, I'm just appreciating the execution and not stressing on where I would have wanted the story, characters to go. Just enjoying the ride. Basically my take is it's the jazz version of Buffy. They have changed up the rythyms, and the structure that we have been accustomed to. Whether 1 likes it or not, it IS something a bit different. So far I'm liking it. And it is VERY unpredictable IMHO. And several eps. are downright eerie. Except for ""Hush"", Buffy never really gave me the Willies (save for a well placed jolt here and there) but some of these eps. like ""conversations"" are genuinely freaky. The fact that everyone is a bit different character-wise adds to this. 7 seasons of the same characters acting the exact same can get kinda dull. Like David Lynch got his hands on a Buffy treatment. And there is actually a sense of danger. Like ALL of the Scoobies can get their asses handed to them and even die. The fact that the First can mess with your head so much and you never know if a character is REAL or not is a bit unnerving IMHO. Spike is pretty menacing in these first few, like he can actually do some damage again. The scene where he grabs Anya's arm while she's going through his clothes is great, but then plays out TOTALLY differently than you'd think. Now I do seem to recall by the last 2 eps. it's kinda back to normal, saddle up, face off, Faith back but SMG in charge again... and that's all good, like the end of S5, But for the 1st 1/2, I'm into the fact that it's out there. I know there's a dull, talky patch ahead prior to the last few, but with these actors now as good as they are, SMG simply a marvel to behold and Marsters doing exemplary work, I think I can handle it. And I have missed a few, so there will be a few surprises in store..... I personally find the ""dark, broody"" Buffy eps. far more interesting than the peppy, goofy all is good by the end types that dominated S1 and part of S2.... Now, I'm not saying it's the best, (either S3 or S5 is IMHO... S2 I've always felt was a bit overrated...) but it's certainly the weirdest and in many ways perhaps the most intruiging Season.

So, let the arrows fly, I know I'm in the minority.

But if one can watch these like I'm doing back to back, it might be better or more interesting than the way we were forced to by the broadcast year. Certainly was revelatory to me...

All this is of course, just my opinion....

2137987,1,B0002XVKMC,"People are giving this season way too high a rating, based on how much they liked the previous seasons. Hey, I'm a Buffy fan too. I wouldn't have watched the first six seaons if I wasn't a fan.

But this season plain out sucks. And it doesn't just suck in comparison to previous seasons. It sucks as a TV show.

Every previous season of Buffy is based around a core group of characters (Buffy, Giles, Xander, Willow and depending on the season you're watching Cordelia, Oz, Anya, Dawn, etc). There are several story arcs taking place with each character, and although they fight evil, in between fighting evil there are other stories happening. And of course there is also the campy humor which was quite enjoyable throughout the first six seasons (although the sixth season slacked a bit).

But come the 7th season, and the show is now nothing but lousy serial pulp fiction involving humourless characters who have no lives outside the main storyline. The acting is horrible, as if they all just gave up when they saw how bad the scripts were.",1115424000,20,1044,4.663043478260869
2137988,5,B0002XVKMC,"As a huge Buffy fan, this season did not disappoint. I love Spike and I think James Marsters did a bang up job adding more depth to a great character already. I hate to see the show go off the air, but with my 7 seasons of DVD's I'll never be for want. Adults that think this is just a teen trend should watch it some.

It was a retread of The First Evil (the seasons big bad) trying to make a vampire with a soul go crazy. Why were they trying to copy the season 3 episode ""Amends"" and turn it into a seasonal story?So many damned plotholes that makes you say ""what the (...)"" Let me explain. In the previous season (which to me was the worse season EVER!) Willow goes all veiny and evil because Warren killed her true love Tara. She nearly destroys the world for her. Come 15 episodes later she's falling in love with Potential Slayer/Slayer Kennedy. I'm like ""What the (...)?""If you remember in the first season 1, last episode ""Prophecy Girl"" The Master was trying to open the Hellmouth, well Giles says NOBODY would want that to happen because if it does gigantic evil beings will come out starting with that tentacled creature and it was huge and compared to the other monsters it was the smallest. Now cut to the finale episode of the series ""Chosen"" Buffy opens the Hellmouth only to fight the UberVampires/Turok Han. Where are the monsters? ""What the (...)!""Now apparently during the early part of season 7 Buffy ""Bring on the Night"" encounters the first of the ubervamps, the thing nearly kills Buffy. Buffy is no match for the first vampire. Imagie if there was an army of those things running around? If Buffy can't barely kill one without dying herself how can she take on an army? That was The First Evils plan. Even the Shaman who created the First Slayer were willing to give her more Slayer strength but Buffy refused.  Cut to the last episode Anya, Dawn, Giles, Woods (he's hot by the way) are all able to kill the ubervamps without breaking much of a sweat! ""What the (...)?!""Spike, with-a-soul (please) who's chip is NOT working now is under the First Evils control. Spike goes on a killing spree without realizing it. Buffy finds out Spike is killing again so what is the Slayer to do? Slay it right? WRONG! She decides to chain him up and find out why he is killing again. To make things worse the chip which was working as a harness so Spike couldn't kill humans happens to be malfunctioning and is killing him. Enter The Initiative, telling Buffy she has a choice to make they can fix the chip or remove. Stupid Slayer opts for the latter. Saying it was wrong to put a muzzle on him. Without even knowing if Spike really changed at ALL! Cause even with a soul it doesn't seem that Spike regretted killing any of his victims including Robin Woods mother who happened to be the NYC Slayer Nikki Woods. And Spike continues to use that leather coat that she wore! Is that balls or what???  But 4 episodes prior Anya was killing again but Buffy, being the hypocrite she is wants to kill her because it's her duty! ""What the (...)?!"" First it seemed The First Evil needed Spike's blood to open The Seal of Danthazar that opens the Hellmouth thus using Spike as their puppet. Because their initial attempt at using human blood (Jonathan's. They made Andrew kill him using Warren's form. Andrew was in love with Warren. I just know it. That's why they used his form) didn't work. So The First Evil thought that Spike was the key which is why it sent it's Bringers to attack Buffy's house and capture the newly soulled vampire. And presto the seal opened. But after that it seemed anyone's blood could open or close the seal. INCLUDING Xander's! (...) I really hate Buffy this season! This by all means is not a disrespect at Sarah Michelle Gellar. She's a great actress and I recenty foun out she had problems with the direction her character and the show was going. So she quit. Thankfully! A woman of morales. Kudos to you girl!  Why do I have season 7 on dvd? Because I love Faith!",1114387200,8,3779,4.505830903790088
2137990,5,B0002XVKMC,"The brainchild of writer Joss Whedon, Buffy The Vampire Slayer originally entered American pop culture as a full-length feature film, starring Kristy Swanson, in 1992. But creator Whedon felt that the project never quite did justice to the full scope of his vision, so he managed turn the film into a television series in 1997. The result of Whedon's increased artistic freedom is a series that has enjoyed both critical acclaim and audience notoriety. Nominated for 14 Emmy's during its seven year run, the show managed to win only two (both in 1998 for Outstanding Makeup and Outstanding Music Composition in a television series). Yet, the true success for Buffy The Vampire Slayer is indicated by the massive success of the show's long run, strong DVD sales, and the overwhelming success of the series spin-off Angel...

Sarah Michelle Gellar plays the title role of Buffy Anne Summers, a teenage girl who stands alone among her generation as the ""chosen one"" able to ""stand against vampires, demons, and the forces of darkness. She is the Slayer..."" But Buffy is not alone in fulfilling her destiny as a slayer of vampires. She also receives help from the high school librarian, Rupert Giles (Anthony Stewart Head), who is a Watcher - the one chosen to train and guide slayers on their developmental path. In addition, new friends Willow Rosenberg (Alyson Hannigan - of American Pie fame) and Xander Harris (Nicholas Brendon) quickly uncover the truth of Buffy's destiny, and they often aid her in defending the world against evil forces...

The Buffy the Vampire Slayer (Season 7) DVD offers a number of exciting episodes including the season premiere ""Lessons"" in which the re-opening of Sunnydale high school is tempered by the resurrection of several students and faculty who place the blame on Buffy for not properly protecting them. Buffy and Dawn join together to defeat the forces of evil, while Spike's soul traverses the labyrinth depths of the school's new basement... Other notable episodes from Season 7 include ""Selfless"" in which Anya's guilt in the aftermath of granting a woman's wish compels her to reverse the spell and face the remainder of her life as a Vengeance Demon, and ""Potential"" in which Buffy and Spike train potential Slayers while Willow uses a locator to discover that Dawn's friend Amanda is the Chosen One...

2137991,3,B0002XVKMC,"Like most reviewers, I was a BvTS fanatic and am disappointed that the series has ended, but I really wish it had ended on a bit of a higher note.  When the series first started, there was always a major battle due at the end, but it didn't overshadow every episode leading up to it.  That's what made the first and second seasons so much better than the later ones.  Season seven was about 50% ""heartfelt"" confessions, observations and other heavy emotional situations guaranteed to bring tears to the viewer's eyes and trick them into thinking it was more than it was.  I hate that kind of trickery.  Most reviewers say they hated the ""potentials"", but I thought that was more like the earlier days of the series, the dialogues were witty, the reactions honest.  The Xander part (the eye) was just wrong - Giles was annoying and almost seemed like a ""bad guy"" most of the time - Spike was weak - Anya turned wimpy and Willow was sad and scared all the time.  Big disappointment, but I guess there aren't any real great ways to end a series that no one wants to end.  I wish the ending had happened while they were resettled somewhere so that you at least had a sense that life might work out for them.",1112832000,4,1203,4.387387387387387
2137992,5,B0002XVKMC,"My heart is as broken as Spike's.  I wish SMG had been willing to go on for a few more years.  I know she thinks she's going to be a big movie star, but she's wrong. Her acting is good on the small screen, but what made this show was the ensemble, Willow, Xander, Giles, Angel and Spike.  Get over yourself Mrs. Prinze",1112227200,,318,4.015873015873016
2137993,5,B0002XVKMC,"I agree with the other reviewers - it's the weakest of the seasons so far, but come on - 7 seasons and it's still the smartest, hippest show out there.  Buy this DVD, you won't be disappointed.",1112140800,5,193,4.216216216216216
2137994,4,B0002XVKMC,"I have never been so torn apart at the ending of anything in my life, I think I broke up with past guys and took it better then the end of Buffy.  It wasn't my favorite season, But who the hell cares, its the end!!!! I've tried to replace it with Angel, but its not the same.  come on Joss, get off your butt and supply your forlorn scooby watchers with a new fix.  Thanks for letting me vent.",1112140800,4,393,3.949367088607595
2137995,5,B0002XVKMC,"First off, I'd advise the reader to beware of any review that states something like, ""There is no doubt that this season is the ______ season of all,"" or similar.  Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.  This season--and every season, really--elicits a range of emotions from viewers.  If you haven't seen it, I advise you to keep an open mind and form your own opinion.  I don't want to spoil too much, and I don't want to tell people what to think, but I will say that if you're a fan of ""BtVS,"" this season is a must to watch.

Season seven is the last one for Buffy; this seems fairly clear from the first episode, which features a surprise ending (I won't spoil it) that offers a payoff for longtime viewers.  With this being the last season, fans naturally held extremely high expectations, hoping that Joss and Co. could deliver 22 knockout episodes to cap the series off perfectly.  Of course, the tricky thing is that, to keep the show edgy and unpredictable, the writers have to come up with twists and gut-wrenchers, like the deaths of popular characters, and this naturally is going to rub some fans the wrong way.  This season is arguably the most violent of all, with probably more characters' deaths than any other.  One of your favorite characters might not be alive by the end of ""Chosen,"" the series finale.  But before you hurl your remote at the TV in protest, remember that it's scenes like that that reach out and grab at our heartstrings.  We don't remember the battles where everything goes right; we remember the soulless Angel brutally killing Jenny Calendar, Buffy being forced to stab Angel, Oz telling Willow he has to leave town, and so on. If every character were to have things fare perfectly well for him/her, it would be boring.  Similarly, there are those who wanted a lighthearted season after the fairly dark Season 6, those who wanted it to get darker still, those who wanted more horror, etc.  The show's writers faced the difficult task of coming up with a season that had to satisfy a very diverse range of opinion. In the end, they came up with a season that I feel resists categorization; it covers a lot of stylistic bases.  A good amount of attention is given to maintaining continuity from prior seasons; there are unexpected references to events that occurred as far back as the first season.  One new character turns out to have a connection to a person we saw earlier in the series; this leads to some particularly dramatic moments down the line.

This season promises to go ""back to the beginning,"" and indeed, we are revisited by many characters and themes we enjoyed earlier in the run of the series.  We learn more about the Slayer line -- who they are, where they come from, how it all began.  Meanwhile, we see a host of new characters enter the mix, on both sides of the fight, to freshen things up and cause the traditional Scoobies to take on new roles.  With more characters than ever, at times an old favorite may seem to get less screen time than before -- that was probably inevitable.  But the writers work pretty hard to give everyone his or her moment in the sun before it's over.  On the whole, I feel that it is a season well worth watching for any fan of the series.",1111622400,4,3233,4.5111492281303605
2137996,4,B0002XVKMC,"If you have watched Buffy from the begining, or if you have just caught a few of the reruns, you will love this season. Past lovers will find that there is quite a bit of humor about past seasons. New comers will find the humor of the show just as funny as it has been over the years.  Those writers are amazing!

2137997,5,B0002XVKMC,"For seven years, I have idolized Joss Whedon and his out-of-this-world cast of actors. There will never be anything quite like ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer."" The seventh season sees the Scoobies going up against the First Evil, a malevolent force that has been on Earth since the beginning of time. Sarah Michelle Gellar, Eliza Dushku, Alyson Hannigan, and surprisingly, Michelle Trachtenberg gave stupendous performances that knocked my socks off. One only has to see Trachtenberg's performance in ""Potential"" and Gellar's performance in ""Showtime"" to know what I'm talking about. The best episodes this season were

""Lessons"" were Dawn forms her own little Scoobie gang with Carlos and Kit,

""Same Time, Same Place"" wow, Alyson Hannigan is surreal in this one

""Help""- I really loved the character of Cassie Newton. Azure Skye is a phenomenal actress and the writing in this episode is some of the best.

""Selfless"", ""Him"", and ""Conversations With Dead People""- the writers over a Mutant Enemy hit us with this trio of mindblowing proportions. My other favorites are ""Never Leave Me"", ""Bring On the Night"", ""Potential"", ""Storyteller"", and ""Empty Places."" Over all, this is one of the best seasons of television period. ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" was always more than a television show. It is a phenomenon.",1111190400,2,1304,5.195238095238095
2137998,5,B0002XVKMC,"There is no show in this world I can watch it over again and again. BTVS is the only one that has the magic. This season can be categorised into 2 parts. Pre potential and Potential.

For the Pre-potential episodes, BVTS has the usual kicks, fun and quirky that makes it so lovable to fans like me. Whether is the slightly scary 'Lesson', or the melanchonlic 'Selfless' to the slightly off-centred but truly hilarious 'Him'. It is the familiar, comfortable and we-the-fans-know-it-but-still-love-it episodes.

Things start to change once 'Conversation with the Dead' shows up. It is scary and funny at the same time. The only flaw it has is that Tara wasn't in it. It will definitely be a lot creepy if it is Tara who speaks to Willow. So I hv to imagine that this is how it is playing.

There are certain episodes in the 'Potential' series I did not like or just don't get it.
1. How did Kennedy knows Williow is gay? It is not like the word 'lesbian' was written on her forehead. She knew it on the first day of their meeting. I don't care how sharp her Lesbdar was, it is just not possible.
2. Why show so much of Wood - the character when there are not enough time for the regular scoobies gang. Anya, Xander, Giles and Dawn almost cease to exist. It is like a new story whereby it is all about Buf, Will, Faith, Spike and a bit of Wood or a bit too much of wood in this case.
3. Why not play more on the First to make it really creepy instead of making the First looking like a loser popping in and out doing nothing but talk people to death. In Chloe's case, that will be literal. The First should be able to possess or exhibit certain evil power since it is the origin of evil.
4. Dawn should be a lot more useful than sending Buffy away in the episode 'Empty Places'. I guess this is a deliberate attempt by the writer to continue make her a constant fixture in the series.

Other than those nagging tibits, I am totally thrill with this season, esp the final 5 episodes with Faith in the picture, some lesbian loving, Buffy with the axe thingy and the final battle scene. It was really great and entertaining. And I have to specially mention Tom Lenk. He is terrific as a geek. Always light up the screen. Xander has become too old to do a Lenk. Also thank God for Anya who indeed brought in the much needed sarcasms to the show while Willow just brooded and whined over her use of magic. [...]",1110931200,2,2403,4.286343612334802
2137999,5,B0002XVKMC,"So here it is, the last season of Buffy. A brief overview of the season, but not too much ( I hate reviews who tell every ounce of the season! Leave something to find out! :)

Alright, the place is Sunnydale, the usual Big Bad Evil is coming, but its really the Ultimate Big Bad. Its called The First with a catchy jingle of ""From Beneath You It Devours""...yummy. Anyways, all this means the end of the world. So the Scooby Gang plus Andrew (yes the Trekie) and some potential slayers are struggling to find out more about The First. It doesnt help that it can imitate dead people (makes for some bad mojo with some of the characters) Spike has a soul now, which kinda makes you love him alittle more. Before he was evil, now hes Spike with a soul and can actually communicate and express himself, and get this He's sincere (go figure!) So a flock of potential slayers are coming to Buffy because all their watchers died and have to be trained. So heres some evil people that get involved; The First, The Bringers, Caleb (this guy I wanted to CHOKE). Newflash, new school, Sunnydale High is back in business, and whos on the hellmouth now? The principle! Dun Dun Dun....

Ok enough with the joking. This season is alot of fun. I found it really humorous actually. I loved the fact that they had Andrew back and gave Willow a new love toy. You see Buffy stop with all the dramatics and actually figure herself out (with the help of a special Vamp) So its not so mundane boo hoo my life sucks Buffy. It has depths humor romance, all that good stuff. It includes the final episode of Buffy. So sad... But hey this was a great last season, it comes highly recommended. Lots of surprises, and keeps you on your toes. :) Enjoy!",1110931200,2,1721,4.375

It was HARD to watch how the writers were ending these characters. It didn't seem like I was watching buffy anymore.  Nothing was the same this time. I am the biggest fan of Buffy. I fell in love with season one. I was hooked from the start.  By the time i purchased seasons 2 and 3 i thought the writing and acting was far surperior than most shows around. I LOVED seasons 5 * 6 -- no compliants.  Where oh WHERE in the HECK did the writers send these characters too in season 7?  IT was all over the board in season 7.  There was NO CORE group at all....BAD story lines .. BORING BORING episodes...so hard to watch at times. I am APPAULED at Willow's handling of TARA'S death/memory.  In retro spect it was the MOST INCONSISTANT storyline of season 7.  Here is why .. season six ended with DARK WILLOW .. why was she DARK --- because TARA died.  So wouldn't it stand to reason she really loved tara and was in soo much pain she almost destroyed the world. How then in season 7 can she just jump so fast into a new relationship and act so ANTI WILLOW----it was like watching a different show. Willow was my favorite character .. but NOT in season 7. Here is another TERRIBLE story ending....Anya Dies ..and all Zander says is ""that's my girl"" .. with a smile on his face??? PLEASE !!! PLEASE !!!  GARBAGE.  I would liked to have seen more of the CORE characters have more scenes and episodes pulling them together .. since this was the LAST season. They brought FAITH back .. which was the highlight .. and I feel it was wasted. There wasn't that spark there as in Season Three.  I feel at no fault to the actors.  They are awesome ..it's the HORRIBLE writing!  And those STUPID ""slayer girls"" ...BUFFY had more conversations with random girls .. then she did with Willow or zander ect.  *~~* oh well ~* buffy is STILL the BEST TV show ever.  It did have an awesome battle scene at the end ~* and the musical score was HOT!!!! ~*~* I give every other season 5 stars .. but Season 7 was a let down for a fan like me!  I hope you can watch and enjoy it though!!  Maybe I am just sentimental and wantd to see more closeness between main characters !! xoxo",1110844800,23,2310,4.256880733944954
2138001,4,B0002XVKMC,"I'm going to miss Buffy, now that it's gone. Seven years (6&1/2 actually)of great fight scenes, generally good writing and characters, lots of good plotlines, just plain better than most anything else out there.

I found the start of the seventh season confusing,(the killings of the young potentials), but that made sense later on. Never did really understand Spike's madness or why he was in Sunnydale High's basement, but I liked the way so many past evil types made cameos as the big evil ""The First"" appeared to him, great casting in those people.

Perhaps my least favorite episode was #16 ""Storyteller"" in which Andrew goes around making a video record of the gangs work for the future, even here in this episode there were good moments, how many series have good moments even in bad episodes?, Buffy was one of them.

I actually thought they managed a pretty good variety of storylines through the season. Anya dropping her demon role,most of the Willow line,even a lot of the potential's story bits were good.

It always surprised me how the writers could keep coming up with some of the lines and scenes that they did. I think it was in #20 ""Touched"" in which Buffy meets the old priestess(?) in some crypt- I think that's where she got the scythe- tells the woman her name and the lady obviously doesn't take her seriously. I also liked the way the woman said something like ""let's just say I look good for my age"". Later she tells Angel (Boreanaz was pretty much wasted here as a way of giving James Marsters a way into going on ""Angel"")that Reverend Caleb ""had to split"", she'd cut him in half with the scythe. In #22 ""Chosen"", on being told that the mall was destroyed Dawn says, ""I knew I fought for the wrong side"". That episode had a lot of other strange lines/ scenes such as the one where some of the gang, the night before the final battle,look like they're planning the battle but it's some silly board game. The day of the battle in the school where Willow and the others discuss shopping afterwards is also typical of the odd but good writing this show had (look closely in the background of one of the darkened hallways and you'll see someone movinig in the background who shouldn't be there).

I never really had a problem with the introductions of the potentials during the course of the season (one of them actually was in a few episodes before she was revealed to be one), or the way some of them were killed in the course of events. An ancient super type of Vampire killed one of the potentials and almost beat Buffy to death, she inspires the others by killing him, that was one of Ms. Gellar's best scenes that season.

The final battle in the Hellmouth made everyone look good, one of the best battles of the season.

The introduction of the new principal, Mr. Wood, was generally well done- and I especially liked the part about how he was the son of Nikki, the Slayer Spike killed in New York back in the '70's.

Much more good than bad in this one, I'm going to miss it.",1109635200,5,3005,4.5009174311926605
2138002,3,B0002XVKMC,"Sadly, my favorite TV show was starting to show some wear and tear by this point. It was still brilliant and great and all that other stuff, but it lacked in a few areas. Mainly, Spike just wasn't as believable as he had been and I never bought his thing with Buffy.

And the writing was a little weird in places.",1109462400,5,313,4.131147540983607
2138003,3,B0002XVKMC,"I have not seen all of this season yet...but I plan on buying it and watching all of it. From what I have seen of this season so far I am pretty disappointed.

  For the most part Willow falling for Kennedy(I did not like this character she reminded me too much of Faith). I would have rather had Tara brought back in some way or better yet towards to end of the season OZ come back...after all before OZ left maybe he said now wasn't the time...but after Tara died they could have brought back OZ towards the end and have her hook back up with him rather then Kennedy.

  I liked the Buffy/Spike relationship and what Spike was willing to go through for her during this time.

  I was disappointed that they concentrated more on the many potentials rather then on the main characters and friends that kept Buffy being Buffy. They were her friends and they barely showed any character development for what I have seen so far its like they fade into the background and are no longer important. From the impression I got so far the writers did not think things through completely before throwing it on the screen.",1109289600,2,1111,4.433497536945813
2138004,4,B0002XVKMC,"Buffy Season 7 marked the conclusion of the Buffy story, and wrapped up many of the story lines that had been left from before (though not all).

'The First', as a big bad, was probably not a scary as it could have been.  While the idea that something that can take on any form and influence someone to do evil is nice in theory, in some respects the lack of personality detracts from how scary it actually is.

The actual character of Buffy seemed a bit messed, and since the character of Buffy is the linchpin of the whole show I feel it made season 7 weaker than it should have been.  Buffy seemed to have changed from being bright, funny, irreverant, and self-aware to being more isolated, authoritarian and serious.

A lot of the humour that made Buffy in earlier seasons just isn't there - neither is her trust and reliance on her friends that she had learned made her stronger.  Her speaches are, possibly by design, overbearing and on some occasions crass.  The mutiny of her 'troops' and friends seems almost justifiable in the face of her behaviour towards them - the expression tin plated dictator certainly springs to mind.

Giles is rendered almost impotent throughout the season, that is when he doesn't simply disappear.  His famed knowledge and skill is reduced to indifferent wimpering at most of the decisions Buffy makes.  Also, Buffy's almost absolute rejection of Giles seems to seal his fate.

Xander and Willow are there, with Xander having a nice speech about how difficult it is just to be the one who is normal when everyone else has powers (though this is made to seem a cheesy plot device by Calib poking his eye out later).

One of the few redeeming features about this season is the fascinating character of Spike.  He is even more twisted and wrong in the head than before; though this doesn't seem to prevent a masterful performance.

The geek crew obviously are no more, but Andrew provides light relief from the dark mood.  The episode ""Storyteller"" is very funny (they even manage to get a Vulcan in!).  Also, the character of Andrew is interesting in that Buffy and co will not allow him to do basically anything, but he still tries to help in his own small way.  In some respects it is a shame he could not be allowed more opportunity to redeem himself.

Having Angel back for even five minutes should have added to the finale, but somehow even this was tainted.  The swaggering John Wayne type entrance is possibly forgivable seeing that it was only a cameo.

However, the fact Angel just so happened to bring along an amulet that essential clinched the whole final battle without any other work than just wearing it was horrible.  It flew in the face of everything the whole show was about for me - it meant that the final victory in battle was nothing to do with Buffy's brilliant plan or fighting skills, nothing to do with Willow's witchcraft, Xander's heart or Giles' knowledge, but down to a free ticket thrown in at the last minute.

Ultimately this is the conclusion to the whole Buffy story so it has to have a high rating.  Despite the many problems it is still a strong finish.  Joss Whedon did the right thing and rewarded the viewers by allowing Buffy and her friends to live, and probably live happily ever after...  However, for the reasons highlighted about I could only ever give it four.

Finally, I would add that Sarah Michelle Gellar probably deserves a medal for making the best of a bad job in terms of scripts, speeches and plot devices for season seven.  Considering that some of the earlier seasons allowed her to give some inspired performances the gradual degredation in quality over season six and seven must have been as dissapointing for her as it was for the viewers.",1108944000,2,3737,4.622727272727273
2138005,5,B0002XVKMC,"On one hand - Buffy was always one of the best shows out there. Not only was it well made TV, but also had some very positive messages. On the other hand - I found season 7 to be the weakest season yet. I'm sad to say that as much as I loved BtVS - after watching season 7 I understood why it was time for it to get off the air.

So what didn't I like about this season?

Let's start with the 'Big Bad': the First Evil (to which we were introduced in season 3). Even though it had the potential to become the scariest baddie of them all (an evil that resides in all of us, and it can hurt us because it knows our psychological weaknesses & can use them against us) - it just wasn't scary. Yes, we've heard that Buffy & the gang were constantly afraid that this one can't be beaten. Yes, we've heard that students in the New & Improved Sunnydale High are fighting more than ever. Yes, we've seen people leave Sunnydale because they're scared because even they could feel the evil in the air (which is a biggie considering this is Sunnydale, where evil is constantly there). But seeing the potential evil with our own eyes? Only in very few episodes (such as 'Conversations with Dead People'). The evil is mostly talked about.

Also added this season were the Potentials - the girls who are potential slayers that may be activated one day. On one hand - I liked the idea of seeing 'The Next Generation', reminding us of the basic charm of discovering the slaying world, where every random vampire was a challange. On the other hand - there were so many of them that it was hard to tell mosto of them apart from each other. Standing out were Rona, and Kennedy - which eventually because Willow's new girlfriend.

Another problem was Spike. The character he had played was good, no doubt, and was exactly what Buffy needed at this point in her life. And even with a soul, he had managed to become as far removed as he could from Angel. The problem was that this isn't the Spike we've rown to know & love!! Spike was always his own man, who took care of his own interests without and regard or remorse about loyalty & friends. Having him give up his life willingly to save everyone else is completely out of character. Also - if he was such an evil vampire, he seems to be feeling very guilty about raping Buffy, but not moved by the people he killed?

Buffy, which is usually the best written character in the show - was also weak at some points of this season. Let's begin with her blind & unwavering trust of Spike. As bpth Spike & Angel had demonstrated before - having a soul doesn't make a vampire good or unaffected by the First. Even the cip hadn't helped control Spike when the First possesed him. So why does Buffy trust him so blindly, when she refuses to give Anya the same benefit of the doubt?

Even though the 'mutiny' of the potentials was supposed to enhance our sympathy for Buffy - I felt more sympathetic towards the rest of the gang...

And as for the ending - why the assumption that Buffy can now become a 'regular' person? Through the series' 7 year run, it tried to show that Buffy can have a try at a regular life even though she was the slayer. The slayer Nikkie Wood even managed to have a baby! The last minute or so of he series somehow denies all that.

The estra features (though very few) were mostly good.",1108684800,3,3334,4.297770700636943
2138006,5,B0002XVKMC,"For so many people I know, Buffy is a guilty pleasure. I mean, what else can you say about a show about a girl named Buffy who kills vampires?

And yet, this show was so much more than that. This is a show that didn't dumb itself down to make ratings. This is a show that made ratings by simply being good.

I watched Season 7 on DVD with a heavy heart. Having already been spoiled by well-meaning friends, I knew what was to come. That beloved characters would die, that the show would be over, that I would have nothing new in the Buffyverse to watch.

I sat down with my DVDs and my box of tissues. I sobbed, I ranted, I laughed. And I fell in love all over again.

We watched the characters grow and mature. They stumble along the way, but when they regain their footing, they are somehow stronger for it. And they do it without losing their memory of where they came from.

Putting aside the analogies of demons and monsters and ultimate evil, this is a show about growing up in the 90's. The themes they deal with are real - death, love, loss, change. The fans identify with those moments because they are moments that we share.

Joss and company didn't pull any punches at times. People in this show die - and they don't always come back. They certainly don't come back the same. But they also remind you that in the depths of the worst moments, sometimes there is still levity - watch ""Dirty Girls"" and ""End of Days"" for proof of that.

So long old friends... it was hard to see you go, but I enjoyed the journey with you.",1108598400,7,1530,4.237113402061856
2138007,4,B0002XVKMC,"Being a huge Buffy fan, I found myself sad when I walked in the door with my Season 7 set, so sad that it was over.

Now on to my review. As many have said before, it felt rushed, main characters were basically ignored, and the character I loved the most was killed off.  I hated the potentials, they were irritating, the relationship between Willow and Kennedy was irrelevant, grose and showed disrespect seeing that her ""lover"" died so recently before.

I am reluctant to criticize someone's appearance, but I have to here. SMG is a beautiful woman, but for some reason, the glamour department threw her hair in a unattractive ponytail through most of the season, and her makeup was underrated. I didn't get that at all. Plus, they used pictures from Season 6 Box set for the Season 7 Box set. Buffy and Spike are wearing the same clothes in both sets.  Cheesy.

I will say this though, it made me so happy to finally see Buffy acknowledge her true feelings for Spike in the end. However it was bittersweet because he didn't believe her. He was so guilt ridden, he couldn't possibly believe someone that he tried to rape could actually love him.

I hope and pray that the story continues between these two as there have been rumors of a spinoff or movie.  I will even go so far as to say that I would take a different actress playing Buffy, if it meant Buffyverse could continue.",1107993600,,1381,4.47808764940239
2138008,4,B0002XVKMC,"Obviously, any Buffy fan will buy this collection, and they should- great picture and sound and hey, it's the final season. My disappointment stems from the extras and commentaries- they are sorely lacking. The outtakes are brief and lame, and the commentaries add next to nothing to the series. Emma Caulfield (Anya) was supposed to do commentary on her spotlight episode, but she was a no-show. It would have been wonderful if there had been more behind the scenes footage of the last episode, but nothing. And Joss Whedon's commentary is just boring. It probably would have been better if a fan or critic had interviewed him during the commentary, in order to get him to talk about things that would have been interesting to the viewers. Maybe some insight as to why Sarah Michelle Gellar didn't do any commentaries, what their working relationship was like, why did he give Dawn the last line instead of Buffy, anything like that. Otherwise, who cares what we think about this particular season? A Buffy fan will buy this set no matter what.",1107820800,2,1045,4.811111111111111
2138009,5,B0002XVKMC,"I am a fairly critical person, and after some of the nearly pornographic episodes of season 6 that were dry as the Sahara, I can understand any wariness of season 7.  There were a few episodes that were not up to par with the true nature of Buffy as determined in seasons 1-3, I still thoroughly enjoyed most of season 7, and any true Buffy fan must own this season, if only for the last episode that Joss managed to create as a true memorial to end the legacy of Buffy.  I give this a 5 star because every season has a few duds, but overall, it so deserves a 5!",1107561600,2,562,4.054054054054054
2138010,3,B0002XVKMC,"Buffy,Buffy,Buffy. The writers turned Buffy into a bitch. She gave a speech everytime someone asked her something. By the time seven came on first run,everyone involved acted like they were going through the motions. The average BTVS fan could tell Joss Whedon,Marti Noxon and David Fury wasn't giving this season 100%.Despite being a substandard Buffy season,season 7 had it's moments.""Him"" is pretty funny.""Same Time,Same Place"" is textbook BTVS.If the whole season could be as good as that episode.
In a nutshell,this is a brief summary of S7:

Buffy gives speeches for close to 22 episodes. The new principal,Robin Wood,has a vendetta towards vampires because one killed his mother. Spike is just...here. Dawn is reacting to high school life. Xander loses an eye,Giles is training a bunch of ""potential"" new girls to be slayers,Andrew is comic relief and Anya is Anya. Faith comes back towards the end of the season. Angel makes an apperance.
The season starts out and ends strong,but falls somewhat flat in the middle.

I'd still recommend this one because subpar BTVS is still better  than most of the TV (including cable) out there.",1107561600,,1139,5.112903225806452
2138011,5,B0002XVKMC,"An excellent end for the best series on television. Although the soon-to-be removed crutch that we still had Angel to hang on to made it easier to let go, its passing was nevertheless difficult to bear. The most imaginative series on television marked and highlighted real issues in demon form throughout high school, into college and beyond. Certainly not without missteps along the way it still always braved ahead and we were able to take courage as our own person fears took evil shape and were slayed. If it had to leave us alone in the dark it went out as a show worth remembering.",1107475200,3,587,4.6
2138012,1,B0002XVKMC,"Buffy was one of best and most original series on television, but sadly, petered out in the end.  The series took it's first hit after season three, ending the high school years, and creator Joss Wheden having to work on Angel more than he expected.  Still, while not as good, it gamely strode on with some good episodes, until Buffy was killed at the end of Season Five.  In many ways, the series should have ended here, inspite of the wonderful Season Six episode ""Once More With Feeling,"" one of the best episodes of the series.  However, one episode isn't enough to make up for the bad Season Six and Seven Episodes.

In Season Seven, after a promising start, the series faltered through poor writing and plotting.  New regular Principal Wood had real chemistry with Buffy, but the addition of Nathon Fillon from Wheden's Firefly bombed.  The characters were no longer the people they were once before, having to have their personalities changed for the banal stories to work.  Death looses it's meaning.  When Anya dies, and Zander is told at the end of the finale, he just says ""That's my girl.""  Hardly the reaction one would suspect from her former fiance, but then, when Buffy the series died, I just said, ""well, it was overdue to end.""

Where does the blame lie?  Executive Producer Marti Noxon seems to use here writing chores as a way to release her own emotional issues (which we don't care about, Marti).  David Fury is a master of the padding department, taking an hour to tell a story other writers can tell in 20 minutes.  But ultimately, it must be laid at Joss Wheden's feet.  He was the creator and producer in charge all along, and he should have had the knowledge and strength to fire the dead weight he had accumulated in the production offices.  But he didn', he let them ruin his show, and thus must bear the ultimate blame.  He's an extremely gifted writer and director, but by season seven, he showed he doesn't have what it takes to be a series producer.",1107388800,26,1983,4.588068181818182
2138013,5,B0002XVKMC,"Many people seem to feel let down by the final season of Buffy.  When a show is so good, you come to expect a lot from it.  However, season 7 has some very good points: 1. They covered new ground.  While on the surface the season seems a re-hash (the worst of the worst, death, apocalypse) they took a previous baddie, and explored the idea of the ""Potentials""  The concept of Buffy being unable to fight her status as the ""Chosen One""  has been a central theme to the show.  The writers therefore explored where these girls come from. Answer: everywhere.  The central theme of empowerment to women is key here:  these girls are all different, but they all have something in common.  2. The further development of Spike's character.  From the glimpses provided over the past seasons, who he was and where he came from, the writing for his character was perfect, completely in line with previous seasons.  AND dramatic and fun to watch. This is also true of most of the Scoobies. 3.  It was spooky.  Conversations with Dead People is actually one of the scariest episodes in any of the seasons, as is Same Place Same Time.  As Buffy progressed, vampires and other baddies become so common place that they are no longer frightening.  Its amazing that after seven years writers can still scare us.  4. The return of Faith.  5. The ending.  Some didn't like it.  However, it was creative, it changed the Buffyverse, and I didn't see it coming.
Not that it was a perfect season.  Some complaints:  Giles returns to his complete stick-in-the-mud position, and is grouchy most of the season. True, living with ever growing numbers of teenage girls is probably his nightmare after dealing with Buffy as a teen.  But he becomes a total contrast to the season's humor.  Yeah the world may end.  Not like its the first time.  Also, Jonathan gets killed.  I know, it was essential to the plot, but I loved Jonathan, as did many others.  Also, Xander and Anya go into a holding pattern.  Anya realizes she can no longer inflict torment the way she once did, but then what?  And Xander has finally matured: he has a job, he does well at it, he's more confident, he's working on getting over Anya, and he goes back to being the show's punching bag and comic relief.  What are the show's writers trying to tell us: there really is no life for an adult?
Still, those are all minor complaints.  This was a really strong season, more cohesive than season 6, and more fun than season 5.  Season 4 remains the worst season, saved by a few good episodes.",1106870400,,2532,4.545454545454546
2138014,3,B0002XVKMC,"THis is a good season, but as is already well doccumented, tensions were arising between Sarah Michelle and the show producers, regarding the darkness of the stories, and you feel that in some ways Sarah, even very professional as always, is going on auto-pilot, just waiting for the show to end and she goes to another phase of her career. By the way, by buying this set I bought all seven seasons of Buffy, and I should ask: why does Sarah Michelle does not appear in ON SINGLE INTERVIEW along the seven sets?! I found it a huge dissapointment. (the only exception is an interview included in Season SIX , but which had already been aired elesewhere - it was not an interview made for the DVD).

The season was great, but the Potentials were not. I know the show is all about female empowerment, but you could not even recognize the girls properly, since there were so many of them! But I think it was a clever history to make it clear that there was not only one Chosen One anymore, and that Buffy could try to lead a normal life from then on.

""Conversations With Dead People"" is the great episode here. The last one, written by Joss himself, is not bad, but I felt something was missing... I think a much more clear ending for the scoobie gang would be welcome: what would they do afterwards, how would Xander reacts about life without Anya, how would WIllos hbehave like a goddess, all this stuff... I think the Scooby Gang (mainly Dawn - man, she was almost entirely forgotten in Season 7) had much less romm than they should. And Spike simply continued to grow and grow, both in charisma and in relevance.

A good season. Hey, this is Buffy, even if Joss Whedon was not around too much since Season Six.",1106870400,,1711,4.442675159235669
2138015,3,B0002XVKMC,"I give this season three stars with my heart bleeding.... Why? Because I must agree this was not a great season. But, like someone before said, even a mediocre season of Buffy is good to watch.

For the first time since I began buying the DVD sets, I found myself wanting some episodes to END as soon as possible (while inother seasons all I wanted was for them to never end, so good they were!)This was a shock. The episode ""HIM"" is one of the worst ever.

AS for The POtentials. When they were three or four, you could stand them. When they became dozens of people, it was awful. So awgul that I became to dislike all of them, even the first ones to take shelter in Buffy's house: Kennedy, Amanda, the black girl, everybody! It simply left no room for the scoobies. Michelle Tratchenberg suffered the most. COmpare her with her screen time in season Six: almost gone. Anya, except for the episode that she kills a dozen students, is also absent.

Nothing against gay relations, but... maybe it was securing the show some points in the audience ratings, but it was absurd the amount of times that they showed Kennedy and Willow kissing each other. It was annoying. By the way, it seems six months it's all that you need to forget the love of your life! (Tara).

The introduction of Andrew as the comic relief was good in my humble opinion. It worked fine. James MAsters's Spike is top notch as always. The return of Faith was welcome, but say what you want, I think Eliza is simply not a good actress. She delivers her lines in an unnatural manner, it always seems forced.

The ending... well the ending was much less climatic thatn I had anticipated...",1106784000,3,1654,4.48172757475083

We needed something symbolic and standing for all time and what we got was a simple man behind it all and a hole in the ground.  It was a deflated balloon because he strove for so much and failed.  Should have shot lower.  I will say this though that nothing can be worse than season four with the boring human regular boyfriend.  I did miss the not many non-related to the theme shows in this season since they all seemed to be building and again toward not much but I was glad to see that Buffy cracked that start of a smile at the end and that made it all worth it to me to know she rose above it all and was finally going to have a life to look forward to.

It is the worst, including the first season in which the show had not truly yet found its voice. (And fellow Buffy fans, before you blast me, keep in mind that *some* season has to be the worst one. ;)

And yet, I still rate it (and with no qualms) 5 Stars, for that is what it deserves. That should give you some idea of the quality of the show, entire.

Specifically as regards the Seventh Season, it has a few great episodes (Selfless, Conversations with Dead People, Storyteller and the grand finale, Chosen) and a few which go awry (though Him is way underrated). The problems of the Seventh Season mainly occur in the last quarter, and they seem to stem from the fact that the production team learned of the series' impending end a little too late to prepare for it adequately. And so, we have some too-convenient plot devices (like the 'Scythe' and Guardian) and some elements ignored all-together (Buffy won't choose Dawn, huh?). Some of the later episodes, like Empty Places, seem to be just killing time.

And yet the show never loses its wonderful characters, acting, writing, directing or dialogue. And the ending does truly befit a show that has been 5 Star all the way. It is majestic, sweeping, fitting, touching, triumphant, heroic.

Buffy the Vampire Slayer is the greatest television show of all time. Read my reviews of each season, if you'd like. Read the reviews of others. But most importantly see the shows. They are funny and depressing and scary and exciting and erotic and deep and just plain cool.

I understand what Joss and Co. were trying to do with this season, and of course, I have to respect that since Joss is a GENIUS, but this season for me was pretty dull up until the final 2 episodes. I thought it moved slowly, and that there was a lot of unnessecary repetition as far as establishing what The First is, slayer mythology, etc.

HOWEVER, I gave this season on DVD a 5 star rating because of the content. The commentaries are great, and I love that they included wrap footage as well as a tribute to Buffy fans. I did, however, think they should have tried harder to get an interview or at least one commentary with SMG, since she has not been in any Buffy-related press since back when Season 1 was airing.

We see Spike crazy in the rebuilt Sunnydale High basement after regaining his soul. We see the introduction of Principal Robin Wood, a man with a dark past and a grudge against the bleach blonde William The Bloody. We continue the story arch of Willow's apprehension with her magics. Also new to this season are the Potential Slayers who arrive in droves trying to escape a villain not seen since the 3rd season, The First Evil. We can revel in the return of many of our favorite Buffy villains from seasons past. Even Jonathon who had a much smaller role in the beginning of the series comes full circle and is killed by Andrew. Willow gets a new love in Potential Slayer, Kennedy(Iyari Limon)and the couple of Xander and Anya come to the realization of where their love truly is. We lose two main characters in the series finale, Spike(who goes over to Angel) and Anya. We stare in awe as Angel makes his final cameo appearance in a Buffy episode. We react with caution as the rouge Slayer known as Faith returns to help Buffy and the Scoobies defeat The First and it's lap dog, a renegade preacher named Caleb. And fans of the series will notice that one of Chosen's scenes resembles the end of The Harvest from season 1. Now the series in it's entirety can be owned on DVD so buy seasons 1-7 and be there as Buffy The Vampire Slayer, Xander Harris, Rupert Giles, Willow Rosenberg, Dawn Summers, Spike, Anya, and yes even the nerd Jonathon come full circle in this truly spectacular series we've come to love.

2138023,5,B0002XVKMC,"This is it. The end is here.

If you're new:

Buffy is a girl who's chosen to stand between the forces of evil. She's fast, strong, has prophetic dreams and the combat instincts of all her predecessors. When one slayer is killed, another is called. It has been this way since immemorial times. Watch the first seasons (but NOT the movie, for crying out loud) to get a better idea.

If you're a familiar with the show:

When I first watched it on TV there were several things that I didn't like. Giles betrayal, the gang turning on Buffy, her failure to protect the potentials, the dark turn the season took after episode 7... But watching it again in my DVD player, it all made sense and this season became my second favorite (Season 2 is still the best). It has it all. The snappy dialogue, the cool demons, the great plot twists and the acute fashion sense of Buffy. It was the end, and it was played that way. The extras are good, with several commentaries, featuretes, outtakes, gags and more. The only thing missing in the extras is the star. There's no Sarah Michelle Gellar anywhere, and she's missed. But this season has more extras than any of  the others.

And, while there were bright points of greatness (""Conversations with Dead People"" and ""Chosen"" are well-paced and nicely done), this final season should have had better, more cohesive character arcs. Instead, all we got were somewhat disjointed stories, inconsistent character-writing and never-realised ideas.

Don't get me wrong, though, a bad episode of Buffy is still higher quality than standard television fare.

While watching this DVD set, though, it seems the episodic nature of the season-long arc doesn't feel as drawn out as it did when it was aired, probably because there would conceivably be no long gaps between episodes.",1105401600,,746,5.313559322033898
2138025,5,B0002XVKMC,"Season seven of BTVS was a fitting ending to, at least in my opinion, the finest show on television.  The 'big bad' was a perfect final foe, the season's arc was fantastic, and the final battle was awesome.  And Tom Lenk was a brilliant addition to the cast.  Not to mention the very final shot of the series was a perfect one to go out on.

The only major qualm I have with this season is that the cast was so large it unfortunately didn't allow for many of the intimate moments between the main characters that were so prevalent during the first six years.  I would've liked to have seen a lot more about:  Xander and Anya's relationship and where it was going. More with Dawn learning to fight and becoming a sort of pseudo-slayer.  And more with Willow and her ability to cope with using magic again, how she was dealing with the loss of Tara, and her getting into a new relationship with one of the potentials.  And of course, more about Buffy and her relationship with Spike, and then again with Angel when he shows up towards the end of the season.  The only other thing that bothered me was the absence of a stand alone episode or two, something along the lines of 'Once Again With Feeling'.  It seemed as if just about every season had one of these episodes, but number seven didn't.

Though it sounds as if I'm complaining, the season was great.  The show was great.  Its too bad it couldn't have gone a few more years.  But hopefully one day there will be another series set in the Buffy universe now that 'Angel' has also unfortunately been canceled as well.

Just because David is a better actor then Sarah, no offense, but she got annoying at points in this season, like in Lies My Parents Told Me, or how about, Never Leave Me? Spike was right, she should have killed him, but instead came up with this list of good things he did, which doesn't even compare to the amount of bad he has done. And, enough of that, here's my review, including everything except the commentaries which are always good in the Buffyverse, and even on Dark Angel, surprisingly:

Lessons- 4.5/5 Buffy goes down into the basement of the new high school, to find weird ghost things haunting the place, and to save her sister who has been trapped down there, also with a more then insane, Spike.

Beneath You- 5/5 One of my favourites on the season. Anya has turned a girl's ex-boyfriend into a slaugh demon, which is like a gigantic worm. After Xander convinces Anya to turn him back, Spike accidentally kills the man and takes off back into the basement, where he hides, and talks to the first. Buffy finds out he got a soul.

Same Time, Same Place- 4.5/5 A Willow episode, which is good, she wasn't in this season nearly as much as the last, and I kinda missed her. She was the only character in the season that I really liked in every episode! Props on Willow, the best character the ever created. And Alyson even more, the girl in the pilot was just dreadful!

Help- 4/5 Casey is a girl, just with the instinct that she will die this Friday, but Buffy will do everything she can to make sure she lives. I didn't really care that much for Casey, but it was cool seeing Zachary Ty Bryan again, I used to love Home Improvement.

Selfless- 5/5 Anya's big episode, personally, I think she should have died here, she was never really needed for the rest of the season, but I still like her, she was just never useful to the gang, except in the Gift, and for her much needed sarcasm.

Him- 3.5/5 Dawn gets back to whine mode in this one, but only over a spell, then it gets funny, love the ending. Also, the flashback to Xander's love spell in season 2.

Conversations with Dead People- 4.5/5 A lot of people consider this to be the best of the season, or the highlight, and I can't argue, this is amazing, but not the best.

Sleeper- 5/5 Spike is killing again, only he has no memmory of doing so, and is being used as the puppet of the first.

Never Leave Me- 4.5/5 Buffy helps Spike remember about all the people he has killed, and Spike wants Buffy to kill him before he escapes again. And of course, Buffy's just more then annoying here, have to hand it to her, I never thought she would be the most annoying character, but she was.

Bring on the Night- 5/5 Welcome back Giles, and Buffy finally gets what's coming to her, an Uber Vamp, or as the call it, Turok-Han. Drusilla returns as the First.

Showtime- 5/5 Buffy wants to rescue Spike, but knows she has to defeat the Turok-Han which has been giving her more then a hard time. She, Willow and Xander make a plan that helps her in defeating the Turok-Han. Lalaine(Miranda on Lizzie Mcguire) plays Chloe.

Potential- 4/5 Willow gets in contact with one of the witches at the college, who said the have located a new potential, here in Sunnydale... Dawn, or is it?

The Killer in Me- 5/5 I loved this episode, but only because it's Willow based. And the line, ""It was Warren"" was beyond corny. The whole Buffy/Spike in the Iniative was kinda dull, plus the fight, you couldn't see anything, wasn't exciting at all. But is Giles the First? We don't know, but if you watch carefully at the beginning of the episode, you can see Giles clean his glasses, but they just sneak that in. Alyson gets the best performance here, she rules!! And I hate Amy, Willow should burn that girl, like she did to Warren.

First Date- 4/5 Ashanti guest stars, and she wasn't great, she wasn't bad, she was just ok. Buffy goes on a date with Principal Wood, and she finds out a little more about him. Meanwhile, Spike interrupts their date to tell them that Xander is in trouble, and on date with yet, another demon.

Get It Done- 4.5/5 Buffy goes back a couple of hundred years and discovers more about the slayer.

Storyteller- 3.5/5 Andrew was getting annoying, it's about time they made Buffy the annoying one and put Andrew in the spotlight where he can be likeable again.

Lies My Parents Told Me- 5/5 Wood found out that Spike killed Wood's mother, who was a slayer, and he decides to take his revenge after convincing Giles that Spike is still a threat. Only, things don't go so well, and if it wasn't for Buffy, Wood would be dead. By far one of the best of the season.

Dirty Girls- 5/5 Bring in Faith, Caleb, who is a nasty bad guy, and after Buffy makes a reckless decision, risks Xander's life and more potentials are killed by Caleb, you have to thank the man, potentials=annoying, though I didn't mind Kennedy before the whole Willow romance thing and she did have a few good lines, but other then that, she was irritating.

Empty Places- 5/5 Finally, Buffy gets the so long after trying to make an even more reckless decision then what happened in the last episode. Everyone teams up against her, except Spike and Andrew who are out discovering more about what Caleb is protecting at the Viniard. Faith becomes the new boss!! Just one question, why didn't they just put Willow against Caleb? I mean, she could take him, she took out Buffy with no problems. Hopefully magic works on the guy.

Touched- 4/5 Pretty boring episode, with the only noteable performance going to Harry Groener, who returns as the Mayor/The First.

End of Days- 4.5/5 After a big explosion, killing even more potentials, Buffy is put back in charge and escapes with a scythe(hope's dagger).

Chosen- 5/5 Willow uses the dagger and makes every potential slayer into a slayer, after Angel returns and Buffy kills Caleb. Buffy tells Angel to go work on a second front, as she decides to go into the hellmouth and finish this, at last.

 Overall, I'd say this is probably the second worst season in terms of development, character, and episode by episode basis. I would say it would go like this: 3, 6, 5, 2, 4, 7, 1. Season 6, a lot of people thought that was bad, but look at all the highlight episodes: Bargaining, Life Serial, Once More, with Feeling, Tabula Rasa, Normal Again, Seeing Red and of course, Villains-Grave. Season 3 had so many good episode, no wonder it's the best, though Angel season 2 takes it all. Season 5 of Bts, the whole Glory thing, the tragic episodes like the Gift and The Body, the funny ones such as Buffy vs. Dracula, the Real Me and Triangle. A great season. Season 2 had the best storyarc, but just too many weak episodes like: Some Assembly Required, Bad Eggs and Go Fish(where the only notable performance is David's as Angelus). Season 4 had so many fantastic episodes that stood out, like Hush, Who Are You?, This Year's Girl, Restless, Harsh Light of day & Something Blue. But it did have its weak episode, I won't go into that. Season 1 was a great story arc season, but it just wasn't nearly as good as the rest of the seasons.

2138027,3,B0002XVKMC,"Not nearly as good as season's 1-4.  Beats 5-6 in a heart beat though.

It stands alone though.

I gotta give prop's to Calib.  That man was a [...], and I loved to hate him every second.  He was up there with Angelus and the Mayor for bad-assness!  To bad he wasn't in more till the last 6 episodes or so...

I have mixed feeling about the end.  Yeah, it's cool Willow was successful w/ the whole ""everyone's a Slayer bit"" but those Vamp's shouldn't have been so easy to beat at the end...  The first primordial vamp the First summoned kicked her ass, and Buffy beat after a long brutal fight..  The end fight seemed lame.

I have to give prop's to Sara though for the last line in the show, where she mearly smiles at the end.  Pricless.  She's not alone anymore.",1104883200,2,765,4.229166666666667
2138028,3,B0002XVKMC,"The strength of Buffy has always been that it has had the best writing on television.  About halfway through season seven, the writers go for an extended cigarette break and the characters are left to wander around like they're on an electric vibrating football game.  The occasional character collisions elicit dialogue that sounds as if it could be ad libbed by a walk-on who has caught a few episodes over the years.  Even worse, we have been trained by the show to expect cliched writing to have a purpose, setting up a new plot twist, and in the beginning of the writers' abandonment, we look around in vain for evidence that daddy is coming back.  There is some salvation in the finale, but it falls so short of what it could have been that it still leaves a bitter taste.  The only positive is that season seven lets us let go of Buffy gently, muttering compassionately . . . It was just her time to go.",1104883200,2,910,4.457831325301205
2138029,4,B0002XVKMC,"Ill get to season seven. First off Buffy is the best show of this decade so far (cause seasons 4 and 5 fell in 2000 and 2001). And I think it was the best show of the nineties and its nice to see alot of tv critics acknowledge this on the dvd extras. So thoughts on the final season? Somehow it made me like season six a little more which i didn't think possible, but repeated viewings always make seasons go over a little better. I started having issues with believabilty of character motivations on Buffy way back in season three when Giles drugged Buffy. I just didn't buy that. Didnt like it. But Ive come to deal with the drastic shifts in character behavior on the show so they don't bother me anymore. But there were plenty of problems with this season. While the potentials were important to keep the storyline going did we need so dang many? Too much time with them though they serve their purpose in the last episode. Too many storylines too, though i liked the one with Principal Wood and I thought it was going to play out longer than it did. Too many characters seemed to be wrapped up too quickly like Dawn and especially Willow. And Kennedy? What the heck? She wasn't needed for Willow to deal with her issues. There could have been more time for more important characters without Kennedy. The Big Bad had good and bad points but mostly i felt the ""character"" was too vague and not threatening enough but Caleb was good. Also Giles was CRIMINALLY, CRIMINALLY underused. At least season six had the excuse of him being off in England. Giles was always one of my top three favorites characters on the show. Watching all the features and listening to Joss Whedon do the commentary for ""Chosen"" made me a little less hard on season seven cause, hey, im sentimental, but even he aluded to the what i suspected and that is that the show was supposed to have ended with season five. I still feel it should have. Season five was incredibly good and maybe the second best season tied with season three. But that wasn't how things worked out and we got two more troubled seasons and I think part of that is because Whedon was less involved in the show. Watching ""Chosen"", the last episode ever, showed how much Whedon was missing from the series. It literally was like watching another tv series, it was so funny and well written. There was so little humor in this last season. Too many characters, too much plot, too much seriousness. Maybe thats the problem. The episodes were too heavy. His musical episode in season six even felt out of place. I guess it doesnt do any good to pretend seasons six and seven don't exist. It was good to have some folks back like Faith, though she was much more awesome on Angel. I wish Harmony coulda come back once more cause she was so darn funny. But there will always be ""wants"". I have to say that Ive never appreciated Sarah Michelle Gellar on the show as much as i did this season. As I look back she was never my favorite character but she really has sold the whole thing from the beginning and she did a brillant job making the whole series work. Im going to miss this show and looking foward to seeing what happens next. They left the end open and its up to everyone;s imaginations to continue the show. Ill always have the episodes on dvd to go to again to feel happy or sad or intense...its that good a show. Even though it started in the late nineties it went until 2003 so i can honestly say that this is the best show of this decade.

Top 10 favorite Buffy episodes with seasons noted in ( ):

No order..

1. ""The Body"" (5)- Definitely the best directed episode of the series, and the most goose bumpy. Very moving, very sad without any cliches.

2. ""When She Was Bad"" (2)- This was the first episode of the second season and right away the character conflicts and drama of the series were really brought up a notch. i really liked the dramatic tension in this episode. It cleared the way for the rest of the series to have really great drama in the midst of the horror stuff.

3. ""Passion"" (2)- I think cause the series kinda showed with this episode that it wasn't afraid to kill off main characters so you knew the risk was always there. Plus its always awesome to see Giles in full bad-ass mode.

4. ""The Zeppo"" (3)- Xander's finest hour. Great concept for an episode. Really funny.

5. ""Buffy vs. Dracula"" (5)- Again Xander gets the best lines. Why aint that fool been on one of the boxes yet?! Okay he finally is.

6. ""Dopplegangland"" (3)- favorite willow episode. she gets to play more of her evil doppleganger to hilarious effect. This is possibly the funniest episode of Buffy.

7. ""The Prom"" (3)- Chosen only for the last five minutes..very touching scene with her and angel and ""wild horses"" on the soundtrack..sigh.

8. ""The Freshman"" (4)- This one cause i thought Sunday was an awesome villian and joss gave her some hilarious lines. he shouldnt have killed her off so quick.

9. ""Fool For Love"" (5)- I think just about the ultimate Spike episode. really well directed. he has some good lines here, but doesnt he always? Spike rules.

10. ""The Gift"" (5) - Fitting that this is last on my list since originally this was supposed to be the last episode ever of buffy. Its an amazing finish: it brings all the storylines of the season together brilliantly and the ending is so moving it gives me goosebumps galore.

What a show. The series gets five stars. Thanks to everyone that worked on Buffy!",1104796800,2,5463,4.445554445554445
2138030,5,B0002XVKMC,"i couldn't believe my eyes when i read some of the reviews and i thought i would take it into my own hands to actually tell a full account (hopefully not too long). this season went back to the early days(not literally) with their fresh jokes which weren't played over and over like in the sixth, fifth, and fourth seasons, with their same old boring jokes. no, this season was pretty much a huge 22 episode finaly and as such is awesome in drama, comedy, and yes, horror. there were a couple episodes which struck the scared side of me as well as my funny bone and most of it was an intricate web of storytellin like that of a good book you read over and over again. there was the relationship with spike and buffy without all the sex but with more feelings which reached its final peak. many potential slayers around the world to go buffy's house to prepare for the final battle. it is said to be the downfall of the show but it does add more variety and feelin too it. also, the weepy willow's tara-death-issue came to a close w/ a new, and might i say, hot, love. and all the old players come back in the game (except cordelia --bummer). there are also very interesting scenes with Giles which are done w/ supurb camera editing as well as some funny ones. Faith arrives and isn't all bad as last seasons. as most of these features seems to be a downfall if you havn't watched the show, the excellent script writers make you feel what is supposed to be felt in each scene. have u wondered what else could be the Big Bad after ""dark willow"" and a goddess from another world? well, the answer is on here. the first and original evil. something that makes spike kill again without him knowing it (done with VERY good acting) and manipulates people's emotions even though it cannot touch it's surroundings. also, the first vampires come into play and kick some serious slayer a$$. then there is the finalie to concider. the graphics and action are that of Lord of the Rings especially when the last famous (wink wink) buffy vampire disintegrates from sunlight. people say this season was rushed but the only rushed thing about it was me rushing to the remote to change episode. (well, mainly cuz i was grounded n i had to finish it before school started again.)",1104796800,2,2260,4.448192771084337
2138031,4,B0002XVKMC,"I just wanted to add my thoughts about Buffy the Vampire Slayer over all. I think that the fans of this show all have their on view on the show. the one thing that I think we can all agree with is that this show was very well written for the most part and it was a much better show than the title would lead those who did not watch it, to believe. The only thing that I would say I did not like was the way some of the charactors changed namely Willow making her gay, that was like a cheap trick to make it interesting. (which it did not) adding Dawn was another cheap way to add something that just did not need to be. I am more of a fan of the earlier shows when everyone was more carefree,fun loving and witty but over all this was a very good, if not one of the Best shows ever to be on TV and that says a lot.",1104624000,,814,3.7941176470588234
2138032,1,B0002XVKMC,"Season 7 of Buffy is pretty crappy.  Even the season closer, ""Chosen"", pales in comparison to the ending for season 5 (IMHO).  Seasons 1-5 of Buffy are THE best t.v. I've ever seen.  The funny thing is... the show actually ended at the end of season 5.  It had a great ending too.  Why did they bring it back?  Even Buffy was mad she was brought back to life, as part of the plot in season 6.  I couldn't blame here; I was mad too.

Season 6 is worth purchasing just for the excellent ""Once more with feeling"".  There is nothing to recommend about season 7.",1104451200,18,557,4.179245283018868
2138033,5,B0002XVKMC,"I first watched Buffy towards the end of the now classic second season. I was struck by how well written and exciting it was. There really was nothing else like it on television. However, the station that carried Buffy all of a sudden stopped carrying it and it wasn't until the first season was released on DVD that I really got into the show. I now own all seasons of Buffy and I can say that it is by far the best show I have ever watched. No show, or movie for that matter, mixes several genres together so seamlessly and perfectly. The villains, the heroes, all of them were terrific. Now that the show is over and I have no more new episodes to look forward to, I realize how much I am going to miss this show.

I prefer not to focus on the few faults this season had. Yes, it was not ""perfect"", but I would rather focus on the many things the series did right this season. The First was a great villain because it could be any dead person it wanted to be. This brought back all of the Big Bads of seasons past and also gave SMG a chance to show off her villainous side in the scenes where the First was Buffy. Caleb was also a great villain. He brought something extra to the last few episodes. The returns of Faith and Andrew were highlights. Those two are two of my favorite characters and it was great to see them utilized in the final season. Amy's brief return was great as well. I think the motto of the season was to see how horribly things could go wrong and how many people could be killed off, since this season has a VERY high body count. This season was the perfect showcase for SMG. Her acting was pitch-perfect and spot-on the entire season. Anyone who says she cannot act is a damn fool and this season proves it, hell every season of Buffy proves it. Every person on this show can act and if there is any justice they will still be working even though the show is over.

Now on the final episode, Chosen. This is, in my opinion, the best Buffy episode ever. It's mix of drama, action, comedy, romance, and heartbreak is everything Buffy stands for. I have never cried so much as I did in the last quarter of this episode. I don't want to give away the most surprising death for people like me who relied on the DVD sets to watch the show, but this person was my favorite character and it was a shock to see them go so quickly and suddenly. I wish they could have survived but that is what I love about this show: any character can go, no matter how popular they are. The final twist with the scythe was excellent, and the last shot of Buffy is just spectacular. Simply put, this is the best series finale I have ever watched. It left me wanting more, and that is how one of the best shows ever created should leave--with a bang, not a whimper (although if you don't do some whimpering during this episode you are made of stronger stuff than I).

I highly recommend this DVD collection. Buffy is an excellent show and there will never be another show like it. Even though Buffy is over, the show will live on through these DVDs, because most of the episodes are highly rewatchable and entertaining all over again. Do yourself a favor and get this set, you will not regret it.",1104105600,6,3197,4.246305418719212
2138034,4,B0002XVKMC,"I am actually sad that there are no more Buffy episodes to watch. I discovered the show on DVD, and have made my way through the seven stellar box sets.

It's now over, and I can honestly say I'm gonna miss these guys.

That said...there were a few things that bugged me this season.

The ""potentials"" business is pretty painful to watch all year long. It pays off in the final episode, in a big and unexpectedly fulfilling way, but for the most part, it kinda sucked.

Andrew's geeky humor worked most of the time, but not all of the time.

Some people did very little this year, like Anya, Giles and Dawn, although they each were given a token moment or two. I wanted Giles to be ""there"" more.

And did anyone else notice a few too many references to the amazing musical episode of the previous year?

And were there, like, SEVEN too many ""Henry V"" speeches by Buffy? (Which is hilariously pointed out by Andrew in one episode, by the way...)

There. I'm done carping. As to what Whedon and company did right?

Oh, pretty much everything else.

Sarah Michelle Gellar is still the anchor...the foundation of the cast. She's just that good. I hope she finds something as epic as this to show off her talents to the world at large. I once dismissed her as an actress (as I did the show) for no real reason.

My huge mistake. Big oops there, huh?

I enjoyed the return to the high school arena, and thought DB Woodside did a fine job as the new principal.

Xander's humble nobility was an unexpected delight, and James Marsters' Spike...well...there's one for the ages, isn't it?

What an arc...from the impossibly evil, imposing swagger of his first years, through his comedic middle period to his very real love for Buffy.

We need to develop a retro-Emmy for these folks, don't we? Yes we do.

Anyways, the set design, special effects, music and sound are far and above anything else on TV, as usual, and the writing rebounds from an off-(but still really good) year.

It is an inarguable fact: Buffy will go down as one of the best shows ever on television.

It's operatic sweep, technical wizardry, impossibly good dialogue, obsessive attention to detail, explosive humor, dizzying romance and plain old great passionate storytelling I think will prove to be unique.

This show had more soul than anything I've experienced in a long, long time.",1103328000,20,2347,4.612048192771084
2138035,5,B0002XVKMC,"Season 7 was not the best season, but it still was an incredible season in one of the best shows on television. It starts off with a bang, but then slows down in the middle, but then picks right back up to the heartbreaking ending. This season is much darker than the other seasons, and it kept it's dark tone throughout, which is how I like Buffy. Dark and intense. Season 7 has some amazing episodes, starting with ""Same Time Same Place"" which was the creepiest episode since ""Hush"", ""Selfless"" where we finally get to see Anyas past. ""Conversations With Dead People"" which is exactly what it is. It's a frightening episode, one of the shows scariest. ""Lies My Parents Told Me"" where we learn more about Spikes past, and the finale ""Chosen"" where Buffy and the gang go up against their final battle. Season 7 saw the addition of the ""potential"" which at times was very distracting. There were too many to keep track of, and I didn't care about any of them, not even Kennedy, Willows new love interest. This storyline bothered me because I thought it was too soon for Willow to start dating after Tara. The addition of Andrew to this season was a nice touch. He is hilarious, and often made me laugh in even the darkest episodes. The entire cast is back and just as good as always, even Eliza Dushku comes back for the final 5 episodes, and she amazing as always. While not the best season, it's better than season 4 and maybe 6. It was a strong season to end the show, although I wish it could have gone on forever.",1103155200,3,1517,4.421428571428572
2138036,5,B0002XVKMC,"Joss Whedon masterfully wound up the Buffy series. As his viewers have come to expect, Whedon introduced some new characters and expanded on the old ones. I was a little weary of the 'potentials' at first, but ultimately appreciated the manner in which Whedon incorporated them into the story. I've always enjoyed the humor in BTVS. Season 7 was no exception. Particulary entertaining was Andrew and his going from evil to good. Now with Angel over and Firefly only having lasted a season, there's a big void in the Whedon universe. I really hope that he comes up with something new, especially something tied to the Buffy/Angel world.",1103155200,2,635,4.888888888888889
2138037,4,B0002XVKMC,"The last season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer was a bittersweet affair. Sarah Michelle Gellar made it known that she had grown tired of playing Buffy and wanted to move on-presumably to motion pictures (which is exactly what she did with Scooby Doo 2 and The Grudge). And so, all bets were off as season seven began. Joss Whedon and company prepared to have Buffy and the Scooby gang face their biggest threat yet.

The First is an interesting twist on the traditional Buffy bad guy in that it is not a physical threat per se (that comes later with Caleb) but a powerful psychological one as it appears to our heroes as friends or deceased loved ones to instill them with fear and self-doubt. As Giles puts it so well, it is ""the thing that created evil."" Of course, this shape-shifting entity gives Joss an opportunity to bring many of the show's significant characters back for one more go round (i.e. Joyce, Drusilla, etc.).

Disc One features an audio commentary on ""Lessons"" by Joss Whedon and director David Solomon. Joss' trademark dry, sarcastic wit is evident as he and Solomon playfully make fun of each other.

Disc Two includes an audio commentary on ""Selfless"" by director David Solomon and writer Drew Goddard. They talk about how this episode's emphasis was on Anya (Caulfield) and explores how she became a vengeance demon.

There is also an audio commentary on ""Conversations with Dead People"" by director Nick Marck, writers Jane Epenson and Drew Goddard and actors Danny Strong and Tom Lenk. This is an entertaining track that fans will enjoy.

Disc Three contains a featurette entitled, ""Buffy: It's Always Been About the Fans"" that examines the show's loyal fan base and how one site, in particular, hosts an annual, six-hour party for the cast and crew to celebrate the show.

Disc Four contains an audio commentary on ""The Killer in Me"" with director David Solomon and writer Drew Z. Greenberg. This is kind of a dry, boring track as they joke and try to think of interesting things to say but end up narrating much of what we are seeing.

Disc Five features an audio commentary on ""Lies My Parents Told Me"" by director David Fury, writer Drew Goddard and actors James Marsters and D.B. Woodside. This is a solid track thanks mostly to the presence of the actors who talk about their experiences working on the show and dealing with this Buffy mythology-rich episode.

There is also an audio commentary on ""Dirty Girls"" by writer Drew Goddard and actor Nicholas Brendon. This isn't as entertaining a track as you would think but it is fairly decent.

Disc Six contains the rest of the extra material, starting off with a fantastic audio commentary on the last episode, ""Chosen,"" by Joss Whedon. He talks about how exhausted he was by the time they made this episode. This is an oddly bittersweet track as Joss criticizes his own work with his amusing self-deprecating humour. It is also a very thoughtful commentary from the show's creator. A must-listen.

""Season 7 Overview-Buffy: Full Circle"" takes a look at the season in general as cast and crew members talk about overriding themes. Not surprisingly, Joss says that this final season was about closure and bringing everything back to the beginning.

""Buffy 101: Studying the Slayer"" features critics and scholars talking about the show's enduring legacy and ""the genius of the central concept,"" as one critic points out.

""Generation S"" focuses on the young, potential slayers that Buffy trains to battle the First. The actors talk briefly about their characters and their experiences on the show.

One of the strongest and most interesting extras in the set is ""The Last Sundown"" where Joss picks his ten favourite episodes from the show's entire run and why. This is a nice look back at the show's entire run with its creator.

There is the obligatory ""Outtakes Reel"" of blown lines, pratfalls and general goofing around.

Finally, there is ""Buffy Wraps,"" a look at the wrap party for the end of the show. You really get the impression that this show changed the lives of everyone who worked on it (and a lot of its fans too) and this is a fitting tribute to this fine program.",1103155200,13,4156,4.776847977684798
2138038,5,B0002XVKMC,"This is a must own for all die hard Buffy fans. As for the rest of you, I'd spend a bit of time considering it before you buy. Though I gave it 5 stars, just because I find Buffy superior to most shows (as simply a matter of opinion) this could be, by far, my least favorite season.

However, it is the end of a Buffy era and so in that aspect it deserves some respect. But I won't lie. Most fans will say the same thing, too much time was taken away from the focus on the main characters, too many 'heart felt' motivation speeches that had you sitting on the couch thinking ""Yeah Buffy, let's go kick some vampire[...]!"" only to realize she wasn't talking to you, and of course the humor we miss so much from our good old Scoobie gang. (and a bunch of whiney teenagers, a dozen or so plots left opened, an unrealistic season finale, and the fact that I was basically numb the entire season out of sheer boredom).

This season is recommended to the following
-Spuffy fans
-Tara haters (*gasp shock*, I know, it's a sin isn't it? But when she first came on she actually received quite a bit of negative attention post-Oz...I say this only because any true Tara fan will never except season 7 and Willow's hasty transition into Kennedyville)
-Riley fans
-Serious Buffy role players (though this was a weak season, it somehow managed to spin off more Role Plays then the ever popular 3rd season. Imagine that.)

Deserves 5 stars? Well, maybe not on Buffy standards. But it's a classic, it's the end, it's BUFFY! Buy it anyways! You know you want to!",1103068800,,1546,4.398601398601398
2138039,5,B0002XVKMC,"With this release, the Buffy series finally comes to an end... comes full circle, as Joss Whedon says in several ocasions. The season opens with Buffy teaching Dawn how to fight a vampire (after a teaser in which a girl gets killed): very interesting way to start the season. The new Sunnydale high opens for the first time since the scooby gang blew it up in the end of season 3... school Dawn is to attend, much for the dislike of Buffy. By the end of the first episode (""Lessons""), the new principal (Robin Wood) hires Buffy as help for the students, and Spike, who has lost his mind and lives now in the basement of the school, is being haunted by something capable to take the form of dead people.  As the season advances we understand the nature of the new big bad and how the potential slayers are in danger and need now, not only to be protected by Buffy, but to be taught on fight and war. This is not a bad season at all, as many people have said. If season 6 seemed a bit unorganized (as the characters were - I loved season 6: it is one of my favorites)season 7 has clearly each step leading to the next one. The big turning point is the excellent episode called ""Conversations with dead people"", in which the big bad makes its first attack on the gang and the remaining duo from the trio comes back: Andrew and Jonathan. The season moves in a very specific direction from that point on: Buffy begins to receive slayers in her house, and Andrew becomes slowly a part of the group. The arc for the characters is also very clear: Buffy begins to face what it means to have the power she has in a moment like that: her solitude is now cearly stated in connection to her superiority or inferiority. This leading to the desintegration of the group near the end of the season, in which one of the main characters gets seriously injured. Willow takes the path to restart her love life (with a potential) as well as to embrace her power beyond her fears. Xander's importance in the scoobies is finally said: his ability to see what the others do, and to maintain the unity of the group... of course, by the end of the season he will be key in the crisis of the group. Spike's journey will be to understand what it meand to have a soul. Then there are those who return like Faith and Giles... and those new: principal Wood (whose alliance with Buffy will be somewhat unstable because of Spike). The season builds on a steady pace, which can really be cherished by watching as many episodes as you can, one after the other... the structure of the season really gets one hooked. Appart from the quality of the episodes (I do not think there is a single one that I didn't like, which usually happens with every season -As you were in season 6; I was made to love you in 5, etc) the extras are quite good: the bloopers are funny and the documentaries are clear and interesting. The audio-commentaries are sometimes somewhat boring (for my surprise, the commentary for Lessons by Joss Whedon is not so good)... but then there is the commentary to Dirty Girls in which the writer really gives interesting insights to the way he structured the episode around the way men objectivize women... and the one for Chosen by J. Whedon is excelent.

The finale is really big, cinematic and dinamic... the battle with supervamps is exciting and there is not a single moment of boredom in Chosen (appart from the return of Angel, character I never liked, but that is personal, so forget it).

Buffy really goes out with a bang... and then a collpasing of the ground... and then a big crater-like hole in the earth.",1102982400,3,3600,4.42684766214178

2138042,3,B0002XVKMC,"Prior to the seventh and last season of BtVS, the writers made a point of telling us, repeatedly, that they were ""going back to the beginning.""  There was a great deal of fan speculation, at the time, as to what that meant.  Unfortunately, once the season was over, we still didn't know what it meant.  It's a good thing some of the DVD features finally explain it.

In my opinion, season seven was the weakest season of Buffy.  There were some stellar moments--""Selfless,"" the Hugo award-winning ""Conversations With Dead People,"" and ""Storyteller"" stand out among the series' best episdoes--but overall the season did not hang together the way the rest did.  It was far too cluttered with supernumerary characters and half-baked subplots. The First as a villain was too amorphous to be scary;  the introduction of Caleb in the last five episiodes (with his strident misogyny) was just annoying;  Buffy's speech-making was more yawnsome than rousing.  And the Potentials really irritated me.

That being said, this season views better the 2nd and 3rd time around, and improves from the ability to see the episodes back to back over the course of a week or so, rather than spread out over a season.  The overall arc is easier to follow and the themes make more sense.  The presence of the Potentials is less irksome and even Kennedy doesn't irritate the way she initially did.  I still didn't like the arc and it didn't say to me what the writers thought they were saying.  So I would have to conclude it didn't work as well as other seasons.  However, for what it is, it's done well.  And Buffy is still exceptional TV in any form.

AS for the DVD set itself, I found it also less satisfying than any of the others.  The featurettes are really, really uninteresting, short and pretty much lifeless. All of them show the same footage form season seven over and over again, with not much different interview segments behind them.  The outtakes reel was pointless.  And, except for the one on ""Chosen,"" the commentaries were super-dull.  Except for Drew Goddard, who provides commentary for virtually every episode that has it, and who was still new enough to BUffy to avoid the exhaustion everyone else seems to be suffering, no one has a thing to say.  I wish, also, that the DVD could have included some of the deleted scenes that kept getting mentioned.  That would have been interesting.

If you're a fan of BtVS, you need to own this, of course. But it's not as good as some of the others.",1102723200,7,2492,4.688940092165899

What you have is a season about empowerment, about being the leader, having strength. Buffy discovers her role as leader but has trouble being the ""general"" because she loses touch with those around her, Willow can't use her power because she loses herself in it. By the end both are able to find the medium, to be empowered and still be true to who they are and those around them. And to some extent this is paralleled in the other characters.

There are so many layers of conflict in the story that it reads like a play. Act 1, Act 2, and so on. I thought it was intelligent how, they represented evil as a reflection of the charecters past and present. It dealt with the issues revoloving around every main charecter including the desintigration of trust and friendship, and they even gave the hero one of the most altruistic roles by Clark Kenting her into a role of a school counselor. If you like the show enough to buy the previous seasons, get this one. it's worth the price Amazon is hawking it for. I don't want to reveal too much, because most other reviews do, but this season has a lot of closure for all the charecters we love and in the drama we see themm grow into roles far beyond their original conception.

2138049,5,B0002XVKMC,"Buffy's seventh season is much better viewing on dvd than when it was originally broadcast.  As with season four of Angel, most of the action this season happens over a very short period of time, in terms of the show's chronology.  The original broadcast was difficult to watch because action on the show that occurred on consecutive days was often separated by weeks of waiting for the next episode to be broadcast.  The dvds solve that problem by allowing you to view the episodes over a short period of time, as they are meant to be shown.  When viewed this way, many of what some people see as inconsistencies in the story disappear.  Indeed, with the exception of one episode that doesn't fit in so well (which I won't name - you can figure it out yourself - although it makes a great comedy stand-alone episode), this season plays like a very exciting 22 hour movie.  However, besides that, it also brilliantly incorporates and concludes the overarching story of the whole series.  This season has some of the best in-jokes of the entire seven season run of the show, including some very obscure references that really make you think.  One of the most hilarious is in a later episode where Giles (who claims not to be trying to get Spike killed) sends Spike to a Mission in Gilroy, California.  If you don't understand the joke, just look Gilroy up on the internet and see what the town is most well known for.  The whole season is full of imaginative material like that.  The finale, ""Chosen"", completely blew me away.  For seven years it was drilled into our heads - ""... one girl in all the world.  She alone can fight the vampires...""  Anyone who says they were expecting the ending that Joss gave us is lying.  Joss, as always, gave us something completely shocking and unexpected to end the show.  The great thing is that he got to end it the way he wanted, unlike Angel and Firefly (which really had barely gotten started) - a great ending to the best show ever.  Granted, Firefly might have ended up being even better, but the idiots at FOX tv never gave it a chance.  So get all seven seasons of Buffy, the only COMPLETE(d) show by Joss Whedon.",1101945600,5,2159,4.534883720930233
2138050,1,B0002XVKMC,"Although the last season of one of tv's most groundbreaking original shows, Buffy the Vampire Slayer's seventh season was such an utter disappointment one wishes the show would

have ended with Willow crying in Xander's arms and Spike regaining his soul. With this being the final season, Joss Whedon and the writers should have sent this series off with an

impact. But all the viewer feels is boredom with such a dull and anti-climatic season, with an even duller finally.

There were plenty of great opportunities to send this season out with a bang. And from the start, it looked promising. With the reopening of Sunnydale High, Spike regaining his soul,

Anya a vengeance demon, and Willow back dealing with some major grief, fans were expecting better. Instead, the Sunnydale High storyline involving Dawn was written out quicker than it

began, Spike's tortured little soul turned him into the focal point of the entire season (this show is called BUFFY the Vampire Slayer, not Spike the Vampire, right?), Willow's

whimpering attitude toward magic all season (although she had no problem restoring Angel's soul in the spin-off's season four crossover), and Anya wondering around the house doing

much of nothing until her gruesome death. The entire season was rehased of old episodes and storylines. I, as a fan for seven years, expected so much

more.

I can't exactly name what was worse. Buffy's mightier than thou speeches that seemed to bore even the Dungeons and Dragons obsessed Buffy fans, Principle Wood's unsuprising storyline

(his mother was killed by Spike - what to do?), Kennedy (do I need to say more?), or one of the most unthreatening villains of all time: The First Evil. More like The First Snooze. I'm

sorry, just reminiscing about this season is making me yawn.

I know I may sound harsh. It kills me as a devoted Buffy fan to write about what a piece of dog poo this season is. There were so many mess-ups and great opportunities just thrown away, it makes me unbelievably sad to call it the end. Not even the return of Faith and Angel or an evil women-hating preacher (how cheesy is that?) could save this series from its dull demise.

There are several reasons this season just seemed stale and out of place with the series. For some it was Spike getting his soul back. For others it was the absence of fan fave Tara. For many it was those annoying little slayer's-in-training running around the house, getting killed, and eating all the food. For me it was all of the above...and more.

I see nothing redeeming about this season. Save yourself some money, and just pretend the series ended at the end of the season six. Thats what I do.",1101772800,15,2671,4.765726681127982

Now, there are some who balk at the ""Spike getting a soul"" storyline...don't listen to them.  This is one of my favorite plot lines in BTVS.  Marsters is a fine actor who made Spike the best character on the show.  Just watch the end of ""Beneath You"" to see how great he is in the role.  Spike resting on the cross as he burns is one of most moving moments I have seen in Buffy.  He is soooo much better than Angel.  He chose to gain his soul, while Angel was forced to have a soul.  And his relationship with Buffy was also had some great moments - ""Touched"" is a great example of this wonderful relationship.

And finally, ""Chosen"" was a outstanding way to end the series.  The cutaways to all the young women as Buffy gives them her ""gift"" were so uplifting - perfect for Whedon's universe.  Chris Carter should study ""Chosen"" over and over to see what a real series ender to should be like (poor, poor X-Files).

Well, to borrow from Camus, there was more to admire about this season than to despise.  The good points:  Spike finally came off the bench and once more became a character of substance, instead of the paper tiger he had degenerated into over the past two seasons; Anya's character was given way more depth and angst this season, (Selfless was one of the standout episodes); Faith was back in the game-any episode with her has consistently been one of the season's best (see her return in Season 4 Angel, the two-parter in Season 4 Buffy); the new edition of principal Wood brought some nice ambiguity to many episodes; Caleb the preacher rocked-his nonchalant misogyny was truly spooky to behold; the many priceless moments-Anya's speech to Andrew about why she isn't running away this time (End of Days), the split-screen scene of everyone's obsessions of a nobody quarterback (Him), Spike's madness in the earlier episodes, and WillowWarren's supplication to Tara's spirit for forgiveness .  There were also some obvious shortcomings:  Andrew was a poor choice addition to the core group-he murdered in cold blood and for some reason the couple of tears he jerks passes for redemption in the Whedonverse and makes him a character to be cherished (Tom Lenk never came across as very funny to me, don't know what Whedon saw in him....); Dawn goes from being tolerable in Season 5 and snotty in Season 6 to making you wish for that medusa episode that never happened....; The First never lived up to its potential-I thought it was a brilliant idea to have it manifest itself into Buffy's previous villains, but aside from the first episode teaser, where were they?  Aside from one scene of the great Harry Groener interacting with Faith, all we got were Buffy, Spike and Druscilla; and what of the ubervamps?-how is it one of them can almost destroy Buffy and Spike, but by the series end it is almost like a bizarre musical the way everyone is casually dusting them?  To get the most from this season, take it on an episode-by-episode basis.  Standouts for me were:  Same Time, Same Place-the demon villain's voice in this episode is a true freak-out experience, as is the moment he manifests and goes to work on Willow; Selfless-the everything you ever wanted to know about Anya, but were too concerned with other things to ask episode with its own very unsettling resolution; Storyteller-this is the gimmick episode that has been a feature of the series since Season 4 (Hush, The Body, Once More With Feeling).

2138056,4,B0002XVKMC,"I agree with many who say that Season 7 wasn't on par with the great seasons of Buffy (seasons 2, 3 and 5), but it did rebound from the dismal Season 6 and ended with everyone mostly satisfied (except Anya who was killed and then not even Xander seemed to care).

My only problem with Season 7 was mainly with the complete character 180s and the whole ""Spuffy"" issue.  I'll tackle these two separately.

1: First off, the episode (I'm not that hardcore of a fan so I don't know the title) in which Buffy is kicked out of HER OWN HOME by the Potentials and the Scoobies.  What?  Buffy has always led the gang into big battles with somewhat risky plans (are we forgetting how she armed the whole senior class with flame throwers and axes to take on the mayor and an army of vampires during graduation?) yet all of a sudden now it's reason for mutiny and kicking her out of her own house?  Come on.  At least give us a better reason for that than just Faith getting hurt.  I mean, it's Faith.  No one there even likes Faith and all of a sudden ""she's part of the unit"" (to quote some ""Riley-speak"" from Season 5).  Not that I'm complaining about the Faith addition which I thought was one of the highlights of the season.  But the characters, relationships (Buffy getting mad at Giles over Spike?  Xander making a joke after learning that Anya died?) and actions throughout Season 7 were just out of character and seemed to have been written by people who had never watched the show before and pulling stuff out of their bums.

2)Okay.  Seasons 2-4: Buffy hates Spike.  Season 5: Spike falls in love with Buffy, Buffy still dislikes Spike but now respects him as a fellow warrior because of his devotion to her and her sister.  Season 6: Buffy uses Spike for sex, dumps him and then Spike tries to rape Buffy.  Season 7: Buffy learns Spike has a soul and they have this unspoken strong bond based on love and loyalty.

Um...huh?  Did I miss a special episode between seaons 6 and 7 where they explained how exactly this happened and why we were supposed to buy into the whole Spike and Buffy, real love, bit?  Spike (played by the amazing James Marsters) was a great character who was spayed (kinda literally) by the chip in his head and (figuratively) his love for Buffy.  Someone who was once an enjoyable character to watch became an Angel rip-off (I distinctly remember Joss Whedon saying Spike's re-ensoulment would be nothing like Angel's yet they turned Spike into Angel and even more whiny) who became nothing more than Buffy's panting lap dog.  What a shame.  I never bought the ""love"" between Buffy and Spike and it was almost an uneven relationship.  Buffy and Angel, for that matter, were never really that great until Angel left for his own show and then you could see their mature, understanding bond in the brief times when they crossed over on each other's show (Buffy coming on Angel during Angel Season 1, Angel showing up at Buffy's mom's funeral, etc.).  It wasn't until the last episode where Buffy plants a kiss on Angel as soon as she sees him and says ""Let me just bask"" that I realized that Spike doesn't hold a bloody candle to him.  Though I'm glad he came back on Angel's show where he was put to more good use other than Buffy's nancy-boy puppy dog.

Oh, just some tidbits.

1. Andrew was a great late addition to the Scoobies.  His episode made me laugh the whole way through and his scenes with Anya were always satisfying.

2. Dawn really didn't need to be there which is sad because I like Michelle Tractenberg(?) (Nona on ""Pete and Pete"" for all those who can remember way back when) but in the Whedonverse, if you don't have superpowers or you're not funny, you're dead weight.  Sorry Dawnie.  and Riley too I guess.

3. I wish Giles had been utilized more because he was sorely missed in Season 6.

4. Wasn't a fan of Kennedy, can't really say why.

5. Sorry that we didn't get to see Tara or Oz again.

6. What was up with Ashanti being on the show?  Or rather, how much did Ashanti pay to be on the show? because I can't possibly imagine them actually asking her to do it.  Geez that was a bad special guest star.  She sure as hell isn't John Ritter.",1101340800,16,4185,4.420915032679739

The main point of the season is to provide character redemption (in the form of Anya, Willow, and Spike), along with discovering what it means to be a hero, and realizing that you don't have to be alone in the fight (which means Buffy can share her burden with all the other awakened slayers.) I also loved the fact that the season was completely planned from the beginning, and there are numerous foreshadowings and hints along the way to keep you guessing.

In all, however, the potentials shifted the focus of the season away from the main characters such as Xander, Willow, Anya, and Dawn.  I wanted to see more of these characters, and the potentials were often taking their screen time.  (Though they were pretty necessary to the story line).

I think my favorite thing about season 7 is the relationship between Spike and Buffy.  They have both changed and come to a place of forgiveness and mutual trust, and their relationship blossoms in a beautiful way.  They always have each other's backs, they defend each other, and they are the most important people in each other's lives in many ways.  The chemistry between them is off the charts!

Some stand out episodes of the season were:

Beneath you: This episode has James Marster's most dramatic and powerful performances as Spike, not to mention heart-wrenching

Selfless: This was an excellent episode, and I'm glad Anya was able to get the spotlight for once.  Seeing her character development was great.

Conversations with Dead People: A truly frightening episode that provides countless eerie foreshadowings along with some great character insights

Storyteller:  Funny and refreshing to hear things from Andrew's point of view

Chosen:  seeing how it all wraps up",1101254400,4,1980,4.790560471976401
2138058,3,B0002XVKMC,"As a Buffy fan from it's first series airing, and now owning the set of DVD's, I am mostly disappointed with what is promised in this DVD set and how it fails to deliver.

Most people buy DVD's for the extra features that are available - and after buying the Xena DVD's, I was expecting much along the same lines from the Buffy outtakes reel as I had gained from Xena.  However, this is not the case.  The outtakes reel is 3 minutes long and mostly just has the cast laughing (note: no SMG bloopers or Eliza Dushku to be found).

The wrap feature lasts 14minutes or so, and once again does not feature SMG or Eliza Dushku.  While I can, to a degree, understand the absense of ED, I find it *very* disappointing that SMG could not make an appearance in any of the features of any of the DVD seasons - considering she was the star of the show.

Although the season itself is jam packed with action - the extras that are available on this DVD set are a major disappointment.

If the extremely small amount of outtakes footage from either 7 years of filming (or simply just the 22 episodes of season 7) and the entire lack of Sarah Michelle Gellar and Eliza Dushku in *any* of the extra footage is not a concern, then it's well worth it.. but in my humble opinion, I was looking forward to at least seeing one of the two in there with a longer outtakes reel and was bitterly disappointed that this was not the case.",1101254400,6,1411,4.262172284644195
2138059,5,B0002XVKMC,"Though not the best season of the series, season 7 is still worth watching and definitely worth the money. Sarah Michelle Gellar, once again, plays her part brilliantly and I love how they brought back Eliza Dushku (Faith). The final episode was fantastic and a little sad, but it ended the series nicely.",1101168000,,305,4.773584905660377
2138060,3,B0002XVKMC,"I have loved every season of Buffy.  I even loved the sixth season as I thought it was a natural progression of the characters, and I was happy to see them dealing with the consequences of their own behavior.  Season Seven had so much promise, but if felt very much to me like they had a general outline of what was supposed to happen and it was filled in poorly.

I think the biggest mistake was the First.  There is nothing scary about a villian who can't even lift up a paper clip.  All of the secrecy surrounding its great plan was for nothing,and so was all of the build up.  I mean the uber-vamps were totally uninteresting (hell Adam was scarier.  Since it was obvious that it was the last season very early on, so much more should have been explored and revisited.  Why didn't they make the goal of the first to become a corporeal entity, and then bring back some of the best villians from the show?  There were so many avenues they could have taken, but they didn't.  It seemed to me like the writers were almost asleep for half of the episodes.

But none the less, the acting was superb (except for Kennedy, she should have stayed in the background), and I did love the finale (eventhough it was rushed and should have been two hours).  The cast and the fans deserved more from Joss Whedon.  He had basically divorced himself from the show at the beginning of season six, and it showed.  Still it will always be one of my favorite tv shows.  And at least it didn't go down the crapper like the X-Files.",1101168000,7,1512,4.330960854092527
2138061,5,B0002XVKMC,"I find this season to be one of the most disturbingly psychological of all seasons. I got a true sense of buffy's isolation being the slayer, which painfully grows as the episodes progress. And, as any leader knows, making difficult decisions will lead to resentment and isolation. More importantly, for the first time, she was chased by the biggest baddie -- her own fear. Buffy feared that she didn't have the answers needed to fight The First and that fear lead to continued isolation from her friends and the potentials and at times reckless behavior. Internal fear, to me, was the enemy she had to fight this season.

Many reviewers did not think The First -- which was noncorporal -- was an effective villian (then again, many reviewers didn't feel Glory was effective -- which is an entirely different conversation). I disagree (on both counts) -- The First struck at the heart of their psyche -- all of their unconscious fears, insecurities and doubts --  to produce at times chilling effects. The demons we see are far easier to slay then those we cannot.

Epic, sweeping, and brilliant.",1101168000,11,1096,4.819148936170213

2138063,5,B0002XVKMC,"I think that the final season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer was brilliant and well done, as Giles would say. Even though Joss Whedon said they kind of had to rush through it since they found out it was the last season while filming it, it still came out great. I enjoyed the storyline in which the First Evil came back with a vengenance and was raising an army of Turok Hans(ubervamps). I mean, it's the First, the biggest evil and I think it's great at how it tried to take it's world back. I mean, The First was the original evil so it would make sense to have it return and tried to take over the world. What I really enjoyed this season was The First's strongest minion, Caleb. I think Caleb was the best, and humorous villian the show ever had. Nathan Fillion did an excellent job in portraying the sick and evil Caleb. I enjoyed Caleb because he was tough, he was a wise ass, he knows he can win, and he actually made Buffy and the entire cast afraid. Besides Glory, Caleb was the only other enemy who actually made Buffy and the others afraid. I also enjoyed Caleb's dialogue when he talks with the First in Buffy's form. Caleb was actually the only person who could kill Buffy in a fight and anybody else for that matter. If it weren't for Angel's help in the second to the last episode ""End of Days"", Buffy would be dead. I don't even think Angel could've taken Caleb. I really enjoyed this season because it portrayed enemies far more powerful than Buffy herself. Not even the Slayer could go up aganist the First and it's minions. This season showed alot of power, leadership, and courage, especially love. Spike's dialogue to Buffy in the episode ""Touched"", made Buffy realize that she is the Slayer, the chosen one. It caused her to ease her anxiety and go up aganist Caleb to steal the scythe. But,overall, that's what I really enjoyed about Season 7. Don't give it bad ratings until you really watch it throughly and really understand the theme of the final season.",1101081600,3,1978,4.451790633608815
2138064,5,B0002XVKMC,"Lets get things nice and sparkling clear- from a number of reviews written on Amazon, I was fully prepared for a lesser Buffy season, one which was subpar but ""better than just about anything else on television."" This is simply balderdash.

I have purchased every season of Buffy on DVD and, accordingly, the reviews for any given season say that that particular season is one that is a ""universally agreed upon lesser season"" though still ""better than just about blah blah ti dah.""

There is nothing lesser about this season and it is just as fantastic as every other season and, with the possible exception of the very first season, I would argue that there is no single BEST season. It would be absolutly impossible to quantify such as thing for every season has masterful episodes.

Here are some of the most common complaints and complainers spanning the various seasons:

Season 1- Too monster of the week with intsy tinsy seasonal arc.
The master was a Big Bad Minus. The characters are all stereotypish and thinly portrayed.

Season 2- Starts out abit too much like season 1. There are the Why can't Willow and Xander get togethers, Why can't Angel be gooders, and why can't Buffy and Angel get togetherers?

Season 3- There are the They brought Angel back to life Come on now Cheap cheapers. Faith is a hosebagers. Xander and Cordillia hookin up pinheads.

Season 4- Most people complained about the initiative and hate Riley. Then there are the Oz lamentors and Tara seethers. Angels missers. Spike chip freakers.

Season 5- Dawn despisers. Major plot hole mania pointer outers (A mystical key, to a portal, which opened up the dimensions, with blood, but when it stopped it would shut, but Buffy had the same blood...hmm, ahh huh wha?). Giles is a capitalist pig  anticapitalists.

Season 6- Oh boo hoo too depressing. Buffy and Spike sexcapade hating Angel puritans. Giles is gone crybabies. The nerds were weak ass villans expounders. Buffy should have stayed dead psychopaths. Whats this crap about heaven atheists. Xander and Anya should have tied it depth charges. Evil Willow cognisent dissonances.

Season 7- The ""The potentials were all winy [...]. Tara didn't rise from the deaders. Why did the main characters have to die ers. The ending suckers. Kennedy mashers. The excess phlabatinum wretchers. The Why are the Ubervampires so varying in kill quality pointer outers and so on.

For every conceivable development in the story, for every nook and every cranny, there are people that complain and rant and rave and yack and scribble.

In every season of Buffy there were some episodes that were sublime, and then some that were fantiastic, and then some that were just great.

In every season of Buffy there were developments that were pleasing, some that were heartbreaking, or some that were just plain necessary. Like the song says, ""You can't always get what you want...you get what you need.""

For every season of Buffy, there were plot holes and then there was masterful narrative arcs, self reflexivity and the odd abandoned story thread.

What are my gripes and complaints about the final season of Buffy? Who cares. This is fantastic voyage brought to a truly satisfying conclusion. Any fan of Buffy should know that these artists could be trusted to guide this ship. All one hundred and fourty four episodes combine into one giant epic narrative about love, hate, dead, life, redemption, forgiveness, growth, loyalty, leadership, loss, meaning, defeat, and dimensions without shrimp to create one of the greatest stories of empowerment of the (post)modern age. And did I mention its fun too, and funny, and weepy, and romantic and action packed.

Buffy rules. Enjoy the final season and make up your own mind about its quality. I, for one, would say that it was shiny!

Oh, I do have one complaint about Buffy. O.K. 2. One, in season one, after Xander turned into a hyena, he said he was going vegitarian. So for six seasons, he was a vegitarian in my mind (I am a vegan), then during Double Meat Palace (Season 6) Xander ate a hamburger. I was pissed- but they later had Prinicpal Wood as vegi so they barely squeezed in a representin'. And 2, they never had Anya watch the killer giant bunny rabbit movie ""Night of the Lepus."" What a missed opportunity!

But besides that, Buffy was probably the best television show ever.",1101081600,10,4355,4.852901484480432
2138065,5,B0002XVKMC,"Just finished watching the season 7 DVD set.  From other reviews, I was prepared for a disappointment.  What a surprise - season 7 was great!  A lot of the trouble may be that one can't just jump in to season 7.  Much of the humor and storyline comes from continuity and previously developed themes.

Each episode had enough sharp dialog, plot and humor to keep me riveted and amused, and the action and special effects were very good.  The sequence when Buffy was working at the school and counseling the girl who had a difficult sister had me rolling on the floor laughing.  Also several characters were extremely well treated this season - Andrew, Robin Wood, Willow, Xander and Spike.  The monsters were great.  Nathan Fillion was excellent as the evil preacher Caleb, far better cast here than he was in Firefly.

My only negative comment about season 7 is that the DVDs loose tracking at the beginnings of Episodes 4 and 9.  These seemed to be production defects not scratches.  Nevertheless I was able to enjoy most of these two episodes, and will still give this set a rating of 5 stars.

(If I do jump in anywhere it is with the episode ""Hush"" in season 5.  I've shown ""Hush"" to friends who had never seen Buffy, and they then had to go and watch every episode :)",1100995200,4,1272,4.497816593886463
2138066,5,B0002XVKMC,"We Buffy fans are a curious bunch.  Yes, we do debate which season was the best or which villian was the scariest (or, for that matter, lamest).  All these obsessive fanboy categorizations might drive an outside observer to compare us to Trekkies (only, you know, better-looking).  Whenever you hear Buffy fans say this or that about a particular season, you should remember that these are family members talking about the rest of their family (like when you were 15 and said you ""hated"" your parents but didn't mean it...I hope).  All seasons of Buffy have their virtues.  The cast and crew have not really changed in its seven year tenure as TV's best show.  If anything, the technical aspects of the show have gotten better.  We just all remember watching Angel lose his soul.  And we cried.  Alot.  We remember Oz and Will make love.  Watching Willow fall in love with Tara or Buffy with Riley or Spike become a Disney-esque wacky sidekick, we couldn't handle it.  We still loved it, but we resorted to meaningless rankings to soothe our ""been there from the beginning"" pain.  Everyone who ""hates"" Season 4 would still watch ""Beer Bad"" over most anything else, just like all the Season 6 haters would still opt to watch ""Doublemeat Palace"" over CSI: New Jersey (or whatever it is).  We love all the seasons, even when we say we hate them.  So, potential (you'll get that later), let me be the first of the extended scooby gang to tell you that Season 7 is great.  Now, you do have to plunk down some cash for the other seasons before you get here, but it's well worth it.  Season 7 had so much going on.  Like Season 6, it was really for the fans (much to UPN's dismay).  All the name-dropping, guest stars, in-jokes, everything.  It was all tailored towards us.  And the drama was just brilliant, really paying off all the events of Season 6.  Eps like ""Selfess,"" ""The Killer In Me"" and ""Lies My Parents Told Me"" are dense and rich.  The action hit its peak this year, and all the fighting is a handy palette cleanser, but you know that's not why you watch.  You watch to see Willow turn into the man who killed the love of her life.  You watch Anya dying, except not really.  You watch for Xander to not appear at all in one episode and then deliver a beautiful speech the next.  This is also the scariest season.  They really made it a point to make things jumpier.  Technically, and I don't know if this is just me, this season looks very different.  The colors are a little less saturated, a bit grainer and the frame seems to be longer.  It fits though.  Season 7 was great, trust me.  Just like all the other seasons.  And, here's a handy litmus test for you.  If you encounter a ""fan"" who honestly can rank the seasons and mean it, well then they're not a fan.",1100995200,7,2772,4.443339960238569
2138067,5,B0002XVKMC,"""I'm sorry, I missed that last part on account of her neck snapping and all.  Did she say the end is near or here?""  This line, said by the mysoginistic Caleb (Firefly's Nathan Filion) in the second to last episode, not only applied to the events in the series, but to the series itself.  Buffy the Vampire Slayer's seventh season was its last, and while there would be one more season of its spin-off Angel, there was no doubt that the end of the Buffyverse was nearing.
This show had a rare and important luxury; the writers and producers knew going into the season that this would be the last (a luxury not shared by Angel or Firefly, unfortunately).  So this season was kind of a big ""Thank You"" to the fans, a sort of ""Best Of"", according to Joss Whedon in one of the commentaries (I think it was for the episode Lessons).  Here's the plot: three months after Xander (Nicholas Brendon) saved the world from Dark Willow (Alyson Hannigan), things have gotten a little better in Sunnydale, but not by much and not for long.  Buffy (Sarah Michelle Gellar), Xander, and Dawn (Michelle Trachetenberg) are the only remaining Scoobies in Sunnydale.  Willow and Giles (Anthony Stewart Head) are in England, where Willow is getting treatment, Anya (Emma Caufield), while still being in Sunnydale, is once again a vengeance demon, and Spike (James Marsters) is nowhere to be found, although, after his attempted rape of Buffy last year, Buffy, Xander, and Dawn aren't in a hurry to find him.  Buffy has been training Dawn to fight while Xander is now a big-shot in the construction world.  We soon learn that he recently completed a project that sends chills down the spines of our heroes.  Sunnydale High has been rebuilt on the exact same grounds it stood on before.  Only now, the principal's office is situated right above the Hellmouth.  If that wasn't forboding enough, the new principal, Robin Wood (D.B. Woodside), is very shifty, and on Dawn's first day of school, she is attacked by some strange spirits.  While Buffy searches for her in the school basement, she discovers the now ensoulled Spike living in the basement and completely insane.  Turns out, Spike has been seeing things ever since he got back.  In one of the series' most powerful scenes, we see Warren (Adam Busch), Glory (Claire Kramer), Adam (George Hertzberg), Mayor Wilkins (Harry Groener), Drusilla (Juliet Landau), The Master (Mark Metcalf), and Buffy taunting Spike.  Keep in mind that six of those people are not only dead, they are former big bads from each of the various years.  Elsewhere around the world, strange men in black cloaks are killing innocent girls for no apparent reason.  Back in Sunnydale, one chaotic night, Willow is visited by the ghost of girl claiming she has a message from Tara (Amber Benson) while Dawn sees a vision of her mother, Joyce (Kristine Sutherland).  Meanwhile, Jonathon (Danny Strong) and Andrew (Tom Lenk) return from Mexico, seemingly to try to help Buffy.  Although, it turns out that Andrew has been seeing the ghost of Warren, and, on the ghost's orders, he stabs Jonathon over a very bizzare seal in the high school's basement.  All the while, the gang is haunted by the message, ""From beneath you, it devours"" (or ""It eats you, starting with your bottom"", based on the translation).
It turns out that The First Evil, or The First for short, is responsible for these hauntings and killings.  For those of you who have seen the show before, you know that, in Season 3, The First was introduced and tried to get Angel (David Boreanaz) to either kill Buffy or kill himself.  The girls are potential slayers, or girls who could be ""called"" if the current slayer dies (although they always say that someone would be called if Buffy were to die, when she died the second time, no one new was called, so I've come to the conclusion that Faith (Eliza Dushku) would have to die in order for someone new to be called).  The First also has one of its agents detonate a bomb inside the Watcher's Council.  Soon, Giles returns to Sunnydale with a few potential slayers, claiming that more will be coming.  After being defeated by an ancient and very powerful vampire, which comes to be called the Ubervamp, Buffy decides that she's tired of waiting for the bad guys to come to her, and she begins training the potentials as an army to take on The First, the Bringers (the priests of The First), and the Ubervamp.
The First Evil is exactly what its name states; it is the original evil thought.  It is sin, it is hatred, it is malice.  While it doesn't have a physical body (and therefore cannot physically hurt anyone directly), it can be channeled, and it can appear in the form of anyone who has ever passed away.  Furthermore, it is omnicient (all-knowing), and can therefore be very persuasive, whether it is lying or telling the truth.
If Season 6 was the (relatively) worst year, then this one was definitely the most polarizing.  Personally, I thought that this season was very good (though not as good as 3, 5, or 2), and I know many people who agree.  However, there are just as many people who thought that this year was poor, unfocused, and had a lousy villain.  I myself really liked The First.  Yeah, some people are put off, because, how do you fight the concept of evil?  But I think the writers handled things very well, and even though we know that there will always be evil (and therefore, The First is pretty much unkillable), they still found a way for Buffy and the gang to deal it a serious blow.
I will admit that they could have done a little more with it, but I'm sure that many of the ideas that I have were thought of by the writers as well.  Sadly, due to contract problems and time constraints, not everyone they wanted could show up.  For example, in Conversations With Dead People, the crew wanted Amber Benson to play The First impersonating Tara, but she didn't want her last performance on the show to be as a bad guy.  Furthermore, many people would have liked to see Xander and Willow's friend Jesse (Eric Balfour) from the first season make an appearance (I know I would have liked to have seen it).
One of my favorite things about this season was Andrew.  He is probably one of the funniest characters in the show's history!  The episode Storyteller was made because they were thinking of doing another spin-off, and they wanted to see if fans would be interested in a show about Andrew (I know I would have watched it).  On the subject of spin-offs and great characters, I was so happy to see Faith back in the mix, and I STILL can't believe she chose to do Tru Calling over a spin-off about Faith.  Another character who I thought was a good addition (I didn't ""like"" the character, but he was interesting to watch, and it was appropriate for him to be in the season about female empowerment) was Caleb, the ex-preacher.  He had, um, interesting dialogue (I'll never figure out how they got away with those lines about the white wine at the last supper), and he was a formidable foe for Buffy.
On the subject of the potentials, I liked the idea a lot more than a lot of fans did.  I didn't like all of them (I hated Kennedy (Iyari Limon), but not cause she was Tara's replacement, but because she was a bad character).  Although they did take time away from some of the principle characters.  I was fine with Dawn losing screen time, but, while Xander didn't get as shafted as some people complain, he did get pushed into the background a bit, which was a little sad.
Ok, so nothing's perfect; there were a few things I didn't like about this season.  The big one was the mutiny near the end.  Yeah, I could see why most of the people were a little upset with Buffy, but I felt they went a little far.  I thought that Buffy cut Spike a little too much slack, and the fact that she turned on Giles and Wood in favor of Spike (sort of) never felt right to me.  And while I liked the whole female empowerment aspect, sometimes I felt they got a little too anti-male.  Oh well, what're you gonna do?
Another polarizing aspect of the season is the series finale Chosen.  While a lot of people like it, others claimed that it was a bit of a letdown, and that The Gift would have made a better ending.  I disagree. The Gift was an amazing episode, don't get me wrong, and while I don't like one of the episodes over the other (they are each good for different reasons), I feel that Chosen was the more appropriate ending.  I forget whether Joss said this, if I merely came to this conclusion myself, or some combination (I'm guessing its the last one), but I've always believed that while writing The Gift, Joss knew he wanted Buffy to die, but it wouldn't be the end because he had at least two more seasons to do; ""the next one"" and ""the last one"".  This gets a little confusing, but, had he wanted to, he could have done more than two, it just worked out that way.  But he needed to do the ""next season"", where Buffy came back and was bored with life, and he needed to do the ""last season"" with the First Evil.  If he had the energy, he could have done any number of seasons in between, it just worked out so that he got these last two seasons.  Anyway, going back to Chosen, I thought it nicely wrapped things up.  It was everything a series finale should be; exciting, a little sad, it mirrored some of the earlier episodes, funny, hopeful, tied up loose ends, and yet it left us wanting more.
Finally, this set has some of the best special features on any of the Buffy sets (although the panel discussion on Season 6 was pretty awesome).  The season overview (which was also a bit of a series overview) was probably the best of all the overviews, and they finally got an interview with Alyson Hannigan (sadly, SMG still didn't take the time to put in her two cents).  The Final Sundown was an interview with Joss Whedon about his Top 10 episodes, the outtakes were hilarious (pretty much anything Tom Lenk did was awesome), and there is a hidden feature that allows you to see the ""Previously..."" montage from the episode The Gift (which basically is clips from the entire first five seasons).
Overall, this is a great season, but as I've said before, in my opinion, none of the seasons are bad, some are just better than others though.  If I were to rank them, it would probably go 3, 5, 2, 4, 7, 1, 6.  This is a fitting end to a great series.  Some episodes I reccomend are Lessons, Help, Selfless, Him, Conversations With Dead People (probably one of the scariest episodes), Never Leave Me, Bring On The Night, Showtime, Potential, Get It Done, Storyteller, Lies My Parents Told Me, Dirty Girls, Touched, End of Days, Chosen.  Enjoy the end of the Buffyverse, and hope that sometime in the future, we get to return.",1100908800,6,10767,4.52607124419205
2138068,5,B0002XVKMC,"Buffy the Vampire Slayer's final season was a sucsess. The storylines in the season went real well with the whole, ""The Slayers End"" deal. In the first few episodes we see the retun of spike and his new attitude. We also se the return of willow in episode 3 ""Same Time, Same Place"", this episode deals with the subject of forgiving, and forgeting the past and how bad it was. Another critical episode called ""Conversations With Dead People"", is an episode where the vieweres gets to figure out the darkest evil that is arriving in Sunnydale, appearances by Joice, Holden, and Kathy, are examples of the strangnes that has, and that has yet to come to plauge Sunnydale, believing spike is his old self again, Buffy takes certain percautions in an episode called Sleeper. Season seven also has those lovable comedy episodes, episodes like ""Him"" is an example of one dealing with lust, how much you love that person, and what you would do for that person, the old fasion episodes like that are what bring the season closer. In later episodes we now have the expirience of relizing that there are not just Slayers, but there are ""Potential"" Slayers, in one episode Giles returns to Sunnydale with some BIG news for Buffy and the others. As the season progresed, Buffy was maturing in a way, were she needs to beside with other people now, towards the end of season, some familiar characters return, and some existing characters disguises are revealed, we see in an episode were Buffy has strange doubts after the princapal of the new Sunnydale High asked her out for Valentines. We then come to find out that he is more than Buffys boss, but is critical help to her and the potentials seeing is how we find out that in the 80's her mom was to the ""Chosen One"" ""Niki"". Some exsisting character that had returned was the nerdy Andrew, and Johnathin, killed in a later episode, Andrew was now a ""hostage"" in the Summers house-hold In a later episod called ""Dirty Girls"" a new enemy arives and a alli\enemy arives. Working for the first evil, ""Calib"" is the critical figure that Buffy must defete. Faith the Slayer also returns, with some needed assistants for Buffy and the others, as the season wound down, Sunnydale became nothing but a ghost town with only Buffy, the Potentials and allis. The big day has arrived in the final episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, ""Chosen"" was the final episode wich contained the very last fight verses good and evil. With the help of Willow using the escents of the ""Scythe"", a powerfull weapon wich was about the only thing that killed the Uber Vamps, some crucial characters of Buffy has died in battle, Anya the widdy (ex)girlfriend of Xander had died when she got sliced on the sholder by a ""Bringer"". Spike had also (kinda died) seeing as he stoped the Uber Vamps and ended up in L.A. where he became a ""helper"" with Angel. The whole town of Sunnydale was now gone, nothing left but (what used to have)a ""Sunnydale"" sign, all confussed about what they were gonna plan on doing now, Buffy smiles in the last scene that we call ""Buffy the Vampier Slayer"".",1100908800,4,3089,4.638686131386861
2138069,4,B0002XVKMC,"Seven seasons.  Sarah Michelle Gellar had been 19 when she did the first season.  Alyson Hannigan was just shy of 30 years old in Season 7, and Nicholas Brendon was well past that.

After this long, you have to give Joss Whedon and his team of writers a lot of credit that there are so many good bits in Season 7 of this show.  At the same time, problems which have nagged at the series since Season 3 once again show up to the party.

When I began to watch this season, I was blown away by the first several episodes.  The invisibility conceit of ""Same Time, Same Place"" has been used a couple of times, but its exploration of Willow's post-witchcraft character -- and Michelle Trachtenberg's hilarious ""paralyzed Dawn"" turn -- are new.  ""Help"" has appealing performances from Sarah Michelle Gellar and Azura Skye (so much that they brought Skye's character back later), ""Selfless"" gives the great Emma Caulfield a chance to strut her stuff, and James Marsters brilliantly burns through punk-vampire Spike's shift from insanity to sensitivity.  DB Woodside also offers some great diversity -- both emotional and ethnic -- as the calm, dryly humorous Principal Wood, whose allegiance is a mystery for half the season.

Too bad that as the season progressed and the central narrative arc started kicking in, the pacing began to drag.  This has always happened with the show since Season 4, and the show Angel was also prone to this.  At a certain point, the main villain of the first half of Act 2 has to bow out, leaving the writers struggling to kick the show into low gear and raise it back up.  The ""Potentials"" are a marvellous idea, spearheaded by the lovably feisty Iyari Limon as firebrand Kennedy and adorable weirdo Sarah Hagan (Freaks and Geeks) as mousy girl-genius Amanda, but there are so many new ""Potentials"" that at a certain point the main staging area became a cacophony of voices, lines and characters.  And for a show that's always done quite well on racial diversity, I was grossly disappointed that they would include an Asian stereotype, Chao-Ahn (played by an actress whose Cantonese is utterly mangled), that verges on Charlie Chan territory.  The character of Andrew also gets a lot of attention, but he's the same joke played over and over far too many times, and serves mostly to bog down the action; actor Tom Lenk seems to copy some of Alyson Hannigan's mannerisms and verbal rhythms, but without the perfect comic timing and naturalistic quirkiness.

The roles of Willow and Xander have diminished, possibly because of the huge number of new and supporting characters.  And final villain Caleb, a misogynistic southern preacher, is one of the most insufferably long-winded characters in the show's history.  Also, at this point, I was disappointed in the lack of creativity in the character.  How many ""superhuman strength, invulnerable"" villains have we had already?  Just off the top of my head we have Luke (Season 1), Kakistos (Season 3), Adam (Season 4), Glory (Season 5), powered-up Willow (Season 6), the Uebervampire (Season 7, Act 2), and now Caleb.  Clare Kramer's way with comical dialogue elevated Glory, but when Caleb did the ol' ""punch Buffy through the air"", I felt like I was watching something I'd seen a hundred times on this show.  Wish they'd come up with more villains like The Judge or Gwendolen Post, who don't rely on brute force and immunity to punches.  For the role of the final villain, this is especially tired, after we've already seen Glory in action.

The final third of the season picks back up with the re-emergence of Faith.  Eliza Dushku is never less than great, and the character's party-hearty bravura helps lift the overly heavy tone that this show always falls into near the end of a season.  Faith's character worked even better in Season 4 of Angel, but she remains electrifying.  Buffy's character once again drifts into self-righteousness and an overdose of malaise midway through, and for a long time I've considered her the least interesting member of the main cast.  Too much crying and lamenting, not enough comedy and eccentricity.  In keeping with the heavy tone, the level of violence in this season is a bit much.  For once I have to agree with the parent groups:  Since when have characters hacked in half (however brief, during the final swordfight) and thumbs in eye sockets been TV material?  On one hand, you could call it pushing the envelope; on the other, you could ask why they had to resort to blood and guts.

I won't agree with people who say this show fizzled out.  The finale is quite spectacular, with not one but two losses in the core group, and the ""mutiny"" which preceeds the ending is exactly what the show needed, splintering the main characters and progressing their relationships right before the end.  I don't consider this the weakest season (for me, Seasons 4 and 6 are pretty problematic as well); I'd say that if you're new to the show, this isn't the place to start, but if you've been watching for awhile, this season will be mostly satisfying, and a longtime fan is going to forgive the shortcomings, more likely than not.",1100822400,5,5138,4.794551645856981
2138070,4,B0002XVKMC,"Season 7 was better than season 6, which is hardly watchable. (Doublemeat Palace for example, a lot of the shows sponsors pulled out after watching that one) I'm a huge Buffy fan and I was pretty much happy with the way it ended. Except for Anya's death which was really quick. Like oops she's dead, let's move on. In conclusion, season six blows goats,

Thank you.",1100822400,2,365,4.53030303030303
2138071,4,B0002XVKMC,"Finally, here it is: the end of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"", taking our plotlines and characters full circle after seven wonderful, deep, sometimes flawed, but always watchable seasons. And though some may disagree, and although things may have been done better, I believe that Joss Whedon, the cast and crew successfully completed what they originally set out to do.

Season Seven promises to `take us back to the beginning', and with the reopening of Sunnydale High School, the origins of the Slayer finally revealed, and the return of several past cast members, it certainly comes through on this promise. I'm certain there wasn't a fan out there that didn't have a geeky ""OMG, that's so cool!"" moment when we see a run-down of the past villains in the season premiere - it sent shivers down my spine.

Soon we rejoin the Scooby gang as they come up against their first round of problems: Willow is back after recuperating in England over the summer, Spike is tormented by the presence of his newly-restored soul, Anya is grappling with her conscious after being remade a vengeance demon (and we finally see her origins in the earliest chronological flashback the show has ever had) and Buffy has eagerly accepted a job as a guidance councillor at the school, offered to her by the suave new Principal Robin Wood (who is, as you can probably guess, more than what he seems).

But with the return of Giles, things begin to get stickier. Something is killing young girls all around the world, who turn out to be `Potential Slayers' - those who are next in line to gain Slayer-power should the present Slayer be killed. An elusive phrase floats around `from beneath you it devours'; as does a mysterious spectre that seems to know just which buttons to press in order to get the Scooby gang on the defensive. With a house full of young girls to babysit and train, as well as monstrous vampires, eyeless assassins, and a seemingly invincible preacher, Buffy assumes a tougher and more rigid standpoint than ever before - which hardly makes her very popular with the troops.

Once again the old camaraderie between Xander/Buffy/Willow is back, as they cheerfully chatter and joke in the midst of doom and gloom (it's no coincidence that the worst seasons are the ones that have this friendship falter). The deep and abiding relationship between these three friends has always been the heart and soul of the show, and I defy anyone not to get a little teary when they say their goodbyes (cleverly disguised as casual banter) in the final episode, before their last fight.

The First Evil genuinely comes across as a sinister and problematic villain, for how do you defeat an evil that is not only incorporeal, that can not only appear as any deceased loved one, but one who knows you intimately? It will help if you've seen ""Amends"" of Season Three, when this being first reared its head, but things sort itself out well enough if you haven't. The writers make the most of Its elusive shape-shifting powers, though right until the end I was holding out for Snyder, Jesse, Angelus, Ben (the intern that Giles killed), Darla, Tara and especially Jenny Calendar - can you imagine the potency of a scene between her and Giles? Unfortunately many of these actors were unavailable or had lost since moved on - but hey, a girl can dream can't she?

Most importantly is the completion of the two major themes of the show: feminine empowerment and Buffy's incurable loneliness. The first is rather straightforward, but the second is something that has been the spirit of the show since the very beginning - no matter where Buffy turned she was trapped completely by her role as Slayer and her ongoing quest for a normal life. The problem seemed unsolvable and her dream unachievable - yet the genius of Joss Wheden finds a solution and brings our beloved heroine full circle. Her blissful, hopeful, joyful smile says it all.

It was not perfect, as towards the end, things began to unravel a bit, with people, places and objects being introduced out of the blue without any real background, meaning, or wrap-up, such as a mystical Slayer-scythe, a female Guardian (who did what, exactly?), Amy the witch turns up again as a potential follower of the First but only appears in one episode, and several statements are made that aren't elaborated (mostly concerning the First's plans and the end of the Slayer line). Other major characters are shunted to the side (Dawn, Xander and Giles are given hardly anything to do) and by the end I was heartily sick and tired of the Spike/Buffy melodrama. Kennedy was a good, strong female character, but unfortunately was deemed unpopular due to her role as a Tara-replacement, and I was disappointed the father/daughter relationship between Buffy/Giles wasn't explicitly acknowledged between them.

But for all of this, the good shone through: a range of allies (some of them rather surprising) turn up to help Buffy in her last battle, specifically Andrew and Faith who finally find redemption, some beautiful scenes of love and poignancy and the highest death rate of regular and re-occurring characters ever on the show. And we finally find out what happened to Miss Kitty Fantastico.

Thanks Joss for seven amazing seasons, thank you for remembering what made this show special and honouring it, and thank you for Buffy, Giles, Xander and Willow - what truly amazing characters, and what a fantastic show.",1100822400,4,5435,4.848060344827586
2138072,4,B0002XVKMC,"It is fair to say that the finale season of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" was going to end up being an anti-climax.  For me the high point of the series was always going to be ""Becoming, Part 2,"" at the end of the second season, and it was always rather impressive that Joss Whedon could come close in the seasons that followed.  The ending was never quite as operatic, but more importantly the weakest episodes each year were a lot stronger and we came to expect that very best stories might pop up in the middle of the season, as with ""Hush,"" ""The Body,"" and ""Once More With Feeling.""

One of the advantages of watching a season from start to finish on DVD is that you can see how the ending is set up.  That was especially true for the sixth season, where knowing that Darth Rosenberg was going to be the Big Bad at the end makes you reconsider what is happening from the very start.  There is a clue as to the conclusion of the series in the very first scene of ""Lessons,"" where a girl runs for her life in Istanbul only to be killed by men in black robes.  She is the first of the Potential Slayers to be killed, but nowhere near the last to fall at the hands of the minions of the First (Evil).

There is an effort to get back to the beginning with Dawn now a student in the new Sunnydale High School and Buffy a guidance counselor of sorts, while Principal Wood becomes the first new adult non-undead member of the inner circle since Jenny Calendar works to good effect.  However, I think that it was a lot harder to accept Kennedy following after Tara as Willow's lover than it was to accept Riley after Angel left, and now that we know Whedon had a story idea in which Buffy is granted one wish and uses it to bring back Tara (instead of getting a pair of really great shoes).  I know I am supposed to want to have Willow be happy and that the idea of her not being the dominant person in the relationship was worth pursuing but it never really clicked for me.

Spike getting his soul also proved to be more problematic than I would have thought.  If you look at Spike on season six of ""BtVS"" and season five of ""Angel"" you cannot really tell there was ever a season of ""BtVS"" in between.  For that matter the idea that the First, having been introduced in season three (""Amends"") has waited all this time to become the final Big Bad seems to be flawed.  Ultimate Evil does not usually wait three years to finally decide the time has come to kill the Slayer, even if Buffy's second return from the grave upsets the cosmic calculus.  However, given the initial premise of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" as a decidedly feminist twist on the stereotype of the blonde girl being attacked by the monster, the end point of the series being the actualization of female empowerment on the grand scale of all the Potentials becoming Slayers is certainly fitting.  This also completely justifies the return of Faith for the final five episodes, which should have been and was more important than Angel's cameo.

The lighter side is relatively limited in the final season, but having the Summers sisters fighting for the same high school jock in ""Him"" was fun, we get to see Anya's past in ""Selfless,""  and Andrew's documentary on ""Buffy, a Slayer of the Vaympyrs"" in ""Storyteller"" has its moment (but laughing at the fate of Kitty Fantastico revealed in ""End of Days"" is just wrong).  But the predominant tone is decidedly dark, underscored by what happens to Xander (""Dirty Girls""), but certainly set up by the growing body count of Potentials at the hands of the Bringers, the Ubervamp, and Caleb.  The fact that the First can take whatever pleasing form its desires, which makes for a brisk walk down memory lane at the end of ""Lessons,"" but necessarily means this Big Bad is never really personified.  Given that the empowerment of women is the final lesson of the series, I am now wondering if the final Big Bad should not have represented more of the impulse towards the subservience of women, not that I especially know how that would be personified, but there are some definite possibilities (Caleb being such a misogynist indicates as much).

Ultimately, what makes the seventh season the least satisfying is that so many of the episodes are dedicated to the main story arc, that we really do not have a first rate classic episode among the final twenty two.  I am defining ""classic"" here as one of those favorite episodes you keep rewatching.  ""Chosen"" is the closest, but it is not a stand alone episode by any means.  This become ironic because one of the strengths of Whedon's show was how the first half story arc would combine with the second half story arc, and so this was really more of the same, but different enough that it did not reach the heights we had become accustomed to in previous seasons.  However, none of this detracts from what Whedon hath wrought in seven glorious seasons.  Nobody who bought the first six is going to miss out on this last one.

The DVD extras have steadily approved from the first season collection.  In the better late than never department more of the actors are showing up on the seven commentary tracks (Danny Strong, Tom Lenk, James Marsters, D.B. Woodside, and Nicholas Brendon), but Joss Whedon still sets the standard and provides the benediction for ""BtVS"" with his commentary on ""Chosen.""  For featurettes there is the overview of Season Seven ""Buffy: Full Circle,"" and pieces on ""Buffy: It's Always Been About the Fans,"" ""Buffy 101: Studying the Slayer,"" ""Generation S,"" and ""The Last Sundown.""  Be sure to actually check out the ""Willow Demon Guide"" on the DVD-ROM, which is a lot better than the outtake reel (which are never as funny as I think they are going to be, which is okay, because who wants a gag reel that is funnier than the actual show?).

Final Note: Once again with the new opening credits the final shot of Buffy is still not Buffy.  The previous one ended with a shot of the Buffy-bot from ""The Gift"" and this one ends with the First appearing as Buffy from ""Lessons.""  Is this a pointed master metaphor or simply a mistake made twice?  You decide.",1100736000,3,6123,4.526315789473684
2138073,2,B0002XVKMC,"They both started out great and ended up sinking midway, after season 6 of Buffy which turned our hero into a S&M loving, I lost heaven and depressed Buffy, even Gellar hated that season, Mutant Enemy promised fans that season 7 would go back to basics, and give everyone the Buffy kicks bad guy butt and makes funny puns of old, and it seemed they were going to do just that, Buffy got a new job, seemed to have a I love my friends and family vibe going with Xander and Dawn in the first episode of season 7, came out of her depression, and we got a old enemy back,that could take the form of the dead, and was apparentaly wiping out potential slayers around the world.

Spike looked like he might fall back into the cocky Master Vamp of old as well, under the power of The First Evil, which Spike before they turned him into the ""I Love Buffy"" wussy, and I would have loved to have the old Spike back, he was a villian ranked up there with the Mayor as funny and evil at the same time, and who could forget The First's act of doing Buffy's Rogue Gallery, chilling, looked like season 7, which was speculated as the last, would go out with a bang.

Then something happened, as if all of the sudden the writers gave a  we don't care anymore style of writing, they packed the show with tons of potential slayers and other last minute characters that did nothing but eat up screen time from the original cast who should have had this season be full of screen time for them, as it was pretty much the last season, some things that disappointed me on season 7.

1. Total lack of screen time for the original characters, everyone one should have gotten a lot more than what was given to them, even Xander was totally written out of Converstations with Dead People, a golden opportunity for a Xander gets a guilt trip from Jesse moment,and also I think that whole return of Giles was totally mishandled, is he the first? was laughable.

2. Dropped plotpoints, storylines that went nowhere, most of the episodes seem to be just written on the cuff, and what seemed like a important fact, was totally lost by the next episode, like the writers had no outline and were just writing anything.

3. Did they bring back Buffy and forget her brain moments in episodes regarding Spike, Buffy after finding out Spike might be under the control of The First let him run free unchecked, kept going on ""But he has a soullllllll now"" many times I thought, yeah so did Hitler what is your point? I laughed at this every episode, and thought a drinking game is soon to be born,it was almost like the writers wanted us to loathe Buffy for some reason for putting everyone in danger.

4. OH MY GOD!!! they turned on Buffy MUTINY!! the payoff from the gee is Buffy really that stupid? Episodes, but by next episode it's all ok friends again, god talk about the worst build up for nothing ever..had to be one of the WORST plotlines that went nowhere the whole season, it seemed it was all for a stupid Spuffy moment just a total waste of episodes.

These are just my views,some people loved both season 6 and 7, though it your a old school Buffy fan, and love the scooby gang of Buffy,Xander,Giles and Willow you will be disappointed and probably sad that this last season gave little to them, the characters that started it all..",1100649600,13,3304,4.396072013093289
2138074,4,B0002XVKMC,"While many devote Buffy fans claim that the seventh and final season of the cult-hit ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" was not as strong as other seasons in the past, it is the final installment in a chapter of television history, therefore is worth the buy if only for that!

Joss Whedon and his team create incredible memories in these 22 final episodes coming around ""full circle"" to where it all began. Joss himself penned the finale ""Chosen"" which even after multiple viewings provides new surprises and throwbacks to important moments of the past with these characters and this story. The weak spot of this season for myself is the introduction of too many secondary characters that seemed to have little interesting purpose until the last minute and distracted the story from our main ""Scooby Gang"".

Favorite Episodes:

Same Time, Same Place - quite possibly the creepiest villain since The Gentlemen.

Selfless - laugh out loud episode telling the story of Anyanka.

Potential - an episode featuring Dawn in a way we have never seen her before!

Storyteller - hilarious and touching episode from the viewpoint of our helpless 'villain' Andrew.

Chosen - Joss Whedon's own finale to the Buffyverse.

That is not all, there are more great moments throughout many of the other episodes in good ol' fashion Buffy style!

2138075,4,B0002XVKMC,"Throughout the course of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, amazing things have happened with logical progression.  For instance, Willow's descent into evil and murder was completely logical if you follow her typical reactions when confronted with pain and loss.

So comes season 7, the most illogical and badly planned season ever.

It's not so much that the course of events doesn't make sense, it's that the course of events could have turned out differently, but it seems like the writers decided to change their plans half-way through.  This makes things very jolted.

The season starts slowly, but the future is sort of outlined.  You have the vision of the dying girl, and Spike being spooked in the school basement by apparitions of all the Big Bads, then Buffy herself.  First question:  Who left the charm that made the spirits come back and seek vengeance?

As more girls die, we begin to understand that potential slayers are being knocked off, but why?  We also learn that The First (read: Amends, season 3) is back to cause havoc.  We then learn that The First is able to cause havoc because Buffy died and is no longer dead.  Second question:  What exactly does that mean?  Simply being able to take her form is all that it needs?  This really isn't clear.

Then Willow undergoes a bit of personal vindication as she finds herself looking like Warren, and then beginning to reenact his final crime.  It turns out Amy (the rat) has cast a spell on her, and understands that Kennedy is her ""potential slayer bodyguard"".  Third question:  How does Amy know this?  Who informed her of all of this?

And that's off the top of my head.

Now don't get me wrong, this season was, as all Buffy is, amazing.  It just had it's holes, and being the series ender, that's not cool.

This season had some great episodes though, specifically Showtime.  Andrew, former badguy, new goodguy, decides to record the actions of Buffy and her crew, for all to see should she save the world.  He interviews everyone, even asks Xander about his heartbreaking choice to leave Anya at the altar.  However, throughout watching the episode, we realize that Andrew lives in a fantasy world, where he alone deflected evil Willow's power, and led the Trio to victory.  Buffy takes him, and forces him to deal with reality.  He *killed* Johnathon, he did bad and illegal things, and he deserves to die.  He breaks down, and accepts reality.  No other episode has so adequately shown how wonderful Tom Lenk is, and this one does it perfectly.

It did have the continuation of the Spike story line and the return of Faith, both very good things.  But there are only a few stand out episodes, like ""Conversations With Dead People"", that were better than average.  This set is a must have to complete your Buffy DVD collection, but is not a great place for new fans or the curious to start (Try season 2 instead).  The reason I gave this set a 2 is because I am rating this product and not necessarily the season itself, which is more subjective.  Fox needs to change their packaging, and their production methods in general, for producing DVDs.  Anytime you but a set, whether it's Buffy or Lord of the Rings, it will have DVDs that are scratched in it.  I have bought all of the Buffy and Angel sets, that's 11 sets.  Of those, only 3 did not have scratched discs.  Which meant returning them numerous times until I could put together a workable set.

That said, if you made it through seasons 4-5 (which had the worst story arcs), you'll probably enjoy watching this.  The primary story arc is strong (read other reviews for details).  Spike is still a great character.  Riley is finally gone.

But the wittiness is gone--I know, I know--the characters matured.  Spare me--it was the cadence of the conversations that made Buffy what it is.  The show thrived because of the peculiar relationships between the ancillary characters like Cordelia, Oz, Angel, Drusilla, Faith, the Mayor and Ethan Rayne.

2138082,5,B0002XVKMC,"I am shocked to find that so many of the reviewers here have branded this season as ""weak"" or ""disappointing"". As a buffy fan from the beginning I have to say that this season has got to be one of the best. The whole season plays like a movie, it is very intense and got viewers at the edge of their seats week after week excited to find out how the season unfolds and now, you get to own it on DVD loaded with tones of extras that would keep you busy for hours.

It is obvious that the writers have had this season planned out right from the start. The flow of episodes is very smooth and not one episode has the feeling that it is out of place. Apart from being an excellent season story-wise, this season also provided a respectable ending to such an incredible show. Through the course of the season, the show went back to the basics and gave the past seven years a good sum up, this is of course highlighted in the first episode `Lessons', with the writers bringing back the infamous sunnydale high school and the big bads of each season.

However, this season does not just focus on the ultimate battle between good and evil, it also took time out to concentrate on the characters and dealt with the events that was left open in the earlier seasons. An example of which was demonstrated in the episode ""selfless"" when the `kick his ass' speech was brought up again. You must have thought they had forgotten about that already.

The actors were also at their best this season. Each of them was given an opportunity to shine. There were some very funny moments (episode 6 ""Him"") as well as heart breaking ones (episode 4 ""Help""). This season would do any fan of the show proud.",1100563200,4,1681,4.364217252396166
2138083,5,B0002XVKMC,"Granted the final season of Buffy wasn't the best of the seven seasons of Buffy.  It was still better than 97.2 percent of what else was on TV in 2002-03.

Three of my favorite all-time episodes come from season seven.  Conversations With Dead People, Storyteller and Chosen are all super episodes.  C w/ Dead People is the scariest Buffy episode ever.  The only thing close is Hush with those creepy Gentlemen.  Storyteller is so funny, Andrew at his absolute best.  And then Chosen is the fitting end for a spectacular run of 144 shows (even though it should have been two hours instead of one).

OK, so why isn't it the best year you ask?  Xander is pushed to the background, Dawn with the exception of the brief dalliance of her being a ""potential"" is made pretty minor.  Anya isn't allowed to be as funny as prior seasons, Giles is minimized (he was in season six as well).  Willow's still there but not as fun as she was before Tara died.  Tara is gone (obviously).  The show became almost too Buffy-centric with Spike being the main support character.

Boy that sounds bad.  The show is still very good and I still love it but a lot of what made you love the show at first faded in the last two seasons as the main characters headed into full-fledged adulthood.

The other main issue with the season are the potential Slayers themselves.  They are just in the way.  It was a cool concept but they just brought way too many of them into the house and with the exception of Kennedy none of them were all that memorable.

Like I said, if you love the show you are probably going to get this (like me).  If you are interested in the show and maybe have seen some episodes and want more, go get the DVDs from the beginning and go from there.  Seasons Two and Three are the best in my opinion with Season Five being third.  Four, Six and Seven are kinda in a group behind those three.  Season One is kind of a separate entity in my mind because it is only 12 episodes.

Still, this season of Buffy had some brilliant episodes, some great moments for individual characters and most importantly a great ending to one of the best series in television history.",1100476800,3,2157,4.402531645569621
2138084,4,B0002XVKMC,"MAN WAS ANDREW ANNOYING! But anyways, this season was a HUGE redemption for me. Seasons 1-4 were the best of the show, then when season 5 came I was so let down by how ridiculously stupid Glory and the whole concept was that I just stopped watching. Season 6 was a lot better than it's predecessor but it was still lacking. The ""villians"" were completely unrealistic in that Buffy has faced evils that are 20 times as bad in less time. But season 7 went to the show's roots. Well, as far as it could go. Sure, it didn't have that ""new-monster-every-episode"" style, but it had that interesting ""what-the-hell-is-going-to-happen"" mentality leaking from it that kept me watching. I loved this season and the way information leaked, the way things were brought, and the preparation for the war with the first (although I believe the devil was the first evil).

There were some things that got me wondering if Joss made blatant errors, or there was more to the story than what was said. Like in the first episode of the season, the first is going through all the villians of past seasons when speaking to Spike and changes to Druscilla. Isn't Dru still alive? Or is the fact that she is ""undead"" passible as ""dead""?

Anyways, not much was left unquestioned, but this season was definitely a great one and ""must have"" for me to own. I recommend it HIGHLY.",1100476800,2,1349,4.616666666666666
2138085,4,B0002XVKMC,"Since many other reviewers have covered each individual episode and the complete plot arch I will not attempt to do a better job. Let me just say that I had been getting increasingly disappointed as each episode of seasons six and seven aired and despaired of them finding a way to ""make it all better"" in the series finale. I love Buffy and that was the problem. As several people had commented the characters were losing that wit and humor that made them such fun. Now I understand that with the themes of maturity and surviving adversity that were emerging it would have been out of place to have snappy one-liners at every turn, but I thought it didn't have to be so darn dark all the time. Every set, every image was in shades of blue and black.

There were, of course, highlights and exceptions but for the most part by the middle of season 7 I was watching the show out of loyalty, morbid curiousity, and a love of the whole Spike/Buffy thing. ;^) But the one thing I really did appreciate about the season was the way everything was tied back up without being gratuitous. With most series when people break up or things go wrong or someone gets addicted, you don't see the character again. Or if you do, it's kind of a ""Oh, I got over that and here's where I am five years later"" kind of thing. [u]The characters in Buffy were true to life.[/u] As with the rest of this excellent show, while the specific addictions and trials were otherworldly the PEOPLE were as real as it gets. Kudos to Joss Whedon for taking on the tough task of tackling ""the day after"" with dignity and doing an excellent job with a difficult subject.

The final capper on this season for me was the finale. I was positively depressed as it approached because I didn't see any way to end the show with the flair and emotional impact I felt it deserved and I hated the thought of it going out with a dark and underpowered whimper. I WAS BLOWN AWAY. Every character was treated with respect, all the major players had an ending (often filled with new beginnings), real life was incorporated, and the wit and humor I so loved were there. I reveled in the connections back to the first season (for example, the scene with the three original characters [Buffy, Willow and Xander] standing in the high school where it all started and talking once again about what they would do after they saved the world. Also Giles' repeat comment about ""The world is doomed."" There were many others.) I loved that the non-special people were just as important and powerful in their way as the superheroes, I loved the female empowerment without male-bashing, and I loved that the real truimph came from strength of heart and conviction and not arms. The paradigm shift presented in the finale was something I would never have thought of and yet it was the perfect, indeed the only, way to end the show. It was like seeing the dawn after a long, dark night and it was obvious from the set that it was intended to be that way for the characters as well.

Dark though it may be, Season 7 is worth the purchase because without it the Buffy story is missing an integral and uplifting aspect. Life goes through cycles; part of living is going on until things get better. Buffy, both as a person and a series, does that.",1100476800,5,3274,4.462437395659433
2138086,5,B0002XVKMC,"Buffy ends her long run as ""The Chosen One"" with the last season of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"". The series managed to touch a nerve with teens, college students and, yes, older folks. Joss Whedon admits that he wanted to reclaim the past with the last season; it's a look back more than a look forward at what will happen to the characters now that they've served their time in high school and moved on. Buffy becomes a guidance counselor at her rebuilt high school, Willow returns uncertain of herself, Spike nearly loses his mind after regaining his soul and there's a sense of closure that one might not expect with most TV series.

 A very nice transfer from Fox is a highlight of the final season. It seems as time has moved on, the series has improved on DVD in terms of the picture and sound quality. Colors are bright and vibrant although some of the episodes still suffer from some digital blemishes. A very nice sound mix here as well with nice presence.

A number of really good featurettes including ""Buffy: Full Circle"" where most of the cast (sans Sara Michelle Geller), the producers and writers discuss the changes over the previous seasons and how (in Joss Whedon's words), it was time to revisit the way the series started at the very end but with Buffy in more of a mentor role this time around. ""Generation S"" discusses the characters of the ""potentials"" that could conceivably replace Buffy. The various chararcters that made the cut including the characters of Rona, Kennedy  and Amanda are highlighted and interviewed in this featurette. They discuss the rigors of the physical activity, the changes to the characters during their brief run on the last season. ""The Last Sundown"" has creator/producer/writer Joss Whedon looking back at his favorite ten episodes throughout the seven season run of the series. It's primarily a ""clip"" featurette with brief comments from Whedon. ""Buffy 101: Studying the Slayer"" features Matt Roush TV Guide critic, Robert Bianco TV critic for USA Today, the Associate Dean of UCLA's Theater Arts Department gushing about how the series broke new ground and tackled a number of interesting themes. Amazon lists a featurette on the fans but I sure didn't see it unless it isn't on the specail features disc (or if its an Easter Egg)We also get the outtakes reel.

 Seven commentary tracks for seven of the best episodes from the seventh season allows fans to generously glance at the creativity at the center of the series. The best of the lot is Joss Whedon's for ""Chosen"" and ""Help"" (along with commentary by director David Solomon) but there's also two very good commentaries featuring the director, writer and key actors from ""Lies my parents Told Me"".  Fox has put together a very generous package with plenty of background on the creation of various episodes that will help keep the series fresh for the second or third viewing.

While the seven season of ""Buffy"" wasn't its best, part of that was due to the amount of change introduced during the last season. The last season was still very strong for the show. That's a pretty darning thing to do for any season during its run much less the last. ""Buffy"" continued to be idiosyncratic, unique, funny and groundbreaking to the very end. That's not something that can be said for every TV series.",1100390400,5,3305,4.7859649122807015
2138087,4,B0002XVKMC,"this is a weak season for a few reasons.  the writers brought in too many new characters that did not resonate (Robin Wood, Kennedy, most of the potentials) and they took up screen time from our beloved characters.  while i appreciate that the main characters needed to evolve as they aged, Buffy and Willow especially, lost the quirks and sarcastic humor that made us tune in.  also, the ""big bad"" of the season was supposed to be the most formidable enemy, but i found ""the First"" to be the weakest of all other seasons.

HOWEVER, every episode has shining moments that remind you why you love this show.  one of my favorite scenes: Faith returns and in true Buffyverse comedic form, she has to figure out who is good and who is evil now.  it's still the witty show unlike no other.  and finally, the theme of female-empowerment that drove the entire series gets front-and-center treatment in the finale.

2138089,5,B0002XVKMC,"If you would have told me that I...a guy in his mid 30's at the time would have become such a huge fan of a show that looked like a teen show, I would have laughed in your face.  With the previous 6 season on DVD sitting on my shelf at home, I gues I'm the one who is nuts now.

But this really did become the one show that I made sure to watch every week and it became quite a passion.  The seventh season is bittersweet as we know it's the last one and it's tough to say goodbye.

I won't cover every episode but here are some of the best from the final season:

Lessons"" Sunnydayle high is re-built and re-opened and Buffy returns as a school guidance counselor.

""Selfless""  Anya grants a young woman's wish, but the violent and deadly act of vengeance leaves Anya completely guilt-ridden. In order to fix her mistake, she asks that the spell be undone. Knowing the price of the reversal is the life of a Vengeance Demon, she's willing to make the sacrifice.

""Bring On The Night""  Giles arrives with three potential slayers and he reveals that the 'First Evil' is killing off the line of slayers in an attempt to rid the world of good, leaving The Hellmouth free to open. He tells Buffy that there are more potential slayers on their way to Sunnydale. Buffy and Giles search the christmas tree lot where they last discovered the Bringers, Buffy goes underground and is challenged by a very strong vampire who is luckily scared off by the sunrise. Giles confirms that he was a Turok-Han, a vampire which vampires fear.

""First Date""  Buffy goes on a dinner date with Principal Wood to try and find out what is really going on with him. After they are attacked and he shows off some fighting skill in dusting a few vamps, he explains that he is the son of a Slayer that was killed in New York by Spike.

""Dirty Girls""  Faith's arrival brings a lot of tension to Buffy's house. All the potentials ask questions, but Faith is only interested in talking with Buffy. And the Mysterious ""priest"" Caleb appears.

""Empty Places""  Following Caleb's attack, Xander is now blind in one eye. Buffy takes all the guilt and again encounters Caleb at the abandoned school. Faith presses her fun-loving nature on the potentials and takes them all to the Bronze, which leads to an argument between Faith and Buffy, culminating in forcing the potentials to choose between their two leaders, but because of Buffy's recent decisions and behavior, they all side with Faith.

""End of Days""  Buffy battles Caleb and finds a weapon needed to kill The First.  Angel Returns!!!

""The Chose""  The last Episode!

in all seasons Gellar has acted really good, but the ending i'll never forget. blood, pain, vampires, demons, it was like great.

Man-kind VS The VaMps.

it was great and Dromatic, Actionness, and Bloody.

Although the romance from Buffy&Spike, took the most of my Attention.

Season 7 tied up all the loose ends(well accept for what really happened when Angel and Buffy met after her return to life) that had been left danggling throughout each of the seasons. I truly felt the actors did an amazing job.  There was such a gammet of emotions.  When it was all said and done, I felt as though one long journey shared with friends, who became family, had reached its destination leaving all stronger, wiser, and with a feeling of having come full circle.

All good things must come to an end, at least this one was done up right.  IF you missed the season when it aired, you DON'T want to miss the opportunity to see it now!",1099526400,6,725,4.340740740740741
2138092,3,B0002XVKMC,"...but still enjoyable!  The gang throwing Buffy out, epsiodes that seemed to star Andrew and Dawn's whining, and an incorporeal villain, all make this season less than stellar.  However, there were redeeming parts such as the return of Faith.  Definitely recommended for rabid fans and completists, but others may not feel the need.

If you're craving more vampires since Angel and Buffy went off the air--try FOREVER KNIGHT, starring a vampire cop searching for redemption--yes, they did it first!",1099353600,2,499,5.2784810126582276
2138093,5,B0002XVKMC,"I enjoyed this season of Buffy alot. I feel like it made up for season six, which I thought could have been better. I enjoyed the whole Spike story line. Since season two I thought we should see more of this DEVIL. Thank God my wish was granted. Willow impressed me so much in season six, but this season brought our loving Willow back to us. Her acting was awesome. The deamons in this season were awesome. Those vampires were like no other vampires Buffy has every faced. And the principal of the new Sunnydale school pissed me off. Until you find out his motive for being in Sunnydale. I also enjoyed seeing the other slayers from around the world join Buffy to fight the evil known as THE FIRST. I also liked that we got to know more of the first. He is the ultimate evil. Overall this season kicked a**. It is a must have for all buffy fans. Buffy will always be the # 1 show. And the series finale proved it. Rock on all Buffy fans.

The death of Anya was senseless and served no purpose.  Remember Tara died?  And yes that was sad but it served a purpose.  It brought Willow eventually out of her magic dilemna.  They should have killed Andrew, no not because he is annoying.  They should've had Andrew save Anya but die doing it, that way he redeems himself and Xander still gets to marry her.

The season is entertaining, but otherwise not great.  Three stars.",1098662400,9,592,4.615384615384615
2138095,4,B0002XVKMC,"The final season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer is not the best but compared to most things on TV deserves to be at the top of most best of lists.  The season opens with Buffy teaching Dawn the nuances of being a Slayer.  After the battle, Buffy gets down to the next task of preparing for the newly re-built Sunnydale High.  It was re-built in the exact same spot right over the Hellmouth.  After saving Dawn and some friends from ghosts in the school Buffy starts to receive some disturbing warnings.  ""From Beneath You It Devours.""  This also seems to correspond with the strange dreams Buffy's been having.  This sets the season up for Buffy to square off against the First Evil.  You may remember it from the Season Three ep ""Amends"" when it tried to make Angel kill himself.  Season 7 may not be as good as Season 3 but there are still some amazing episodes.  ""Selfless"" where we get to see some background into Anya's vengeance demon days.  ""Conversations with Dead People"" where we learn that Spike even with his soul is murdering humans and burying them in the basement of one of the victims houses.  Then Giles returns with girls.  Potential slayers that the First is after.  Michelle Trachtenberg who plays Buffy's sister Dawn is finally given something to do besides whine in the excellent episode ""Potential"".  Xander's speech to her at the end is one of the best in Buffy history.  ""Storyteller"" the episode where Andrew finally faces all the terrible he thing's he's done is also excellent.  The final five episodes of the series starting with ""Dirty Girls"" and ending with ""Chosen"" I think do a great job of wrapping up the series.  It brings back Faith after her stint in LA with Angel.  Gives us a terrible villain twisted and powerful preacher Caleb, an ex-pat from Buffy creator Joss Whedon's cancelled FOX series Firefly.  The final episode while it could be longer was one of the best series finales I've ever seen.  It gave a sense of closure and new beginning for Buffy all the while giving her what she always wanted.  For those of you who haven't seen it I won't spoil it for you.

2138096,4,B0002XVKMC,"OK, first of all, an average season of Buffy is still pretty much better than most tv shows. While Buffy never managed to regain the heights of seasons two and three- and hit rock bottom with the fifth season which really had few redeeming episodes- this was the closest they managed. Season seven has it's downpoints- the 'potentials' being the main ones; a group of 'nearly slayers' that have little characterisation to distinguish themselevs from each other. That apart, it's a solid season with some real standout moments that I won't spoil. Gellar and Marsters are great, as is the criminally underused Brendon.

2138099,5,B0002XVKMC,"The last two or three seasons of BtVS came in for more than a bit of fan criticism, primarily because some fans refused to grow with the characters and the series. It's not that the show *always* made the best decisions, but for television, they did extraordinarily well and they generally stuck to the primary themes which made the show great. The show continued to create new characters and plot lines that expanded and enhanced the original vision. This season and the 6th were an overt challenge to viewers and in the 7th, the producers had to decide to wrap things up. As the show developed over the years, boogey-man physical villians became the villiany of power, the challenge of simply living, and the existence of evil itself. On each occasion, the writers were true to the show's roots and in this final season, it leads to a finale which left me crying and cheering, and asking one of the questions the show has always been asking in different ways: ""Are you ready to be strong?""",1098057600,14,991,4.636363636363637

You just cant please some people I guess. If we would have gotten more of the same, there would be complaints of it getting stale. Something different, people  complain it is going away from what made it great. I loved Spikes development. I liked the fact that Xanders eye gouging was quick/pointless, as are most tragedies in life. Many just didn't get it. They thought Xanders eye gouging had to have purpose.

This season had more inspiration in it and you know what? that is why Buffy is used in many psychology classes because of the message it sends, sure humour is a nice thing to add but definatly not essential when the story line is as serious as this. Life isn't all about fun and games and humour, you have to look at the messages behind the episodes and I know everyone will have a different opinion on this but mine stands firm that season seven was one of the best seasons. That and season six was the best for me. I would recommend buying this because it is such a great season and if you don't, you are missing out on a lot. If you don't buy it and they stop selling it in stores and stop showing it on t.v and you just can't seem to find it anywhere, you will regret not buying it in the first place.

2138102,1,B0002XVKMC,"As a HUGE Buffy fan who never missed an episode from the first night the show aired, it pained me to sit through the last season.  It lacked focus, it lacked humor, it lacked action, it lacked a serious villian (so the First's big power was psychological mindplay?  Oh, soooo not scarey), and it lacked the creativity that had made it such a good show in earlier seasons. Joss simply checked out on this season to focus instead on that awful Firefly cowboys-in-space fiasco. Principal Wood was just plain annoying and brought nothing to the show as a new character--oh why couldn't he have been eaten like all the previous principals?  Faith came back and...did nothing.  In fact, the very last few episodes are little more than talk, talk, talk with the potentials and Scoobies being nothing but whiney and taking it out on a Buffy who never seemed to be able to find her own backbone. The only bright spots are the Conversations with the Dead episode and the final episode (which I still have problems with because they killed off Anya yet kept that horribly simpering character of Andrew alive) in which Joss finally brought back his old magic.  I can't recommend buying this DVD because I can't imagine actually wanting to sit through any of these episodes again when I can watch Joss's brilliance from seasons 1 - 5. Save your money -- watch the re-runs on cable if you must, and buy seasons 1 - 5 of Buffy or any of the Angel seasons instead.",1097971200,27,1448,4.575289575289576
2138103,5,B0002XVKMC,"The strength of Buffy over the years was its ability to grow and evolve, to take what it accomplished and build off of it.  I identified so strongly with Buffy's characters because of what they experienced and how they grew from it over the years, and season 7 is the show's most adult season because it returns to the foundation of every character from a wiser, earned perspective.  In that, this season takes a knowledge of Buffy history, and for those of us who's been with it all the way, it does not disappoint - Anya's history in ""Selfless,"" the return to the initiative in ""The Killer in Me,"" or the quick trip through various season 1-2 traumas in ""Storyteller"" all remind us of the complex, powerful mythology around these vivid characters.  And at its roots, this is a season of all of Buffy's undercurrents come to the surface - what it means to have power and to choose the rules of your life.  In that, ""Chosen"" was arguably the most powerful episode the series ever produced because it took seven years to get to it.",1097625600,10,1030,4.521505376344086
2138104,4,B0002XVKMC,"Even on a bad day (er, episode) Buffy the Vampire Slayer has always proven to be a show superior to the drivel network television routinely produces. Point in fact - seasons 2, 3 and 5 - were so jaw-droppingly spectacular that it seems hardly possible the brilliant people behind the show (Mr. Whedon and company) could come up with better. And they couldn't. Season 6 was a valiant effort at maintaining the show's momentum and indeed had episodes (eg. Normal Again and the three part finale) worthy of being among the series' best. The same goes with Season 7. Like the previous season, the overall concept itself was good but the actual results were uneven. Inconsistencies abound and the series finale lacked the emotional gravitas of previous efforts (eg. sacrificing Angel at the end of season 2 and Buffy's suicide leap at the end of season 5). That being said, we all have our personal preferences (myself - Xander should've displayed a bit more grief at Anya's death, Kennedy is such a pitifully inadequate substitute for Tara, and Buffy's relationship with Spike is nothing short of the kind of self-destructive stupidity that lands people on the Jerry Springer show - and Buffy deserves better than that). But ultimately - even the most mundane episode that comes out of Buffy is far and above more intelligent and moving, scarier and knee-slapping funnier than most anything else out there. It will be sorely missed.",1097539200,6,1428,4.904958677685951
2138109,5,B0002XVKMC,"Seasons 6 and 7 took a lot of fans aghast, it seems. The show went to UPN and grew up; both seasons deal with the life people hit around 25-old: bills, job, leadership, self-worth, separation of sex and love ... Naturally, some of the younger crowd fell behind. ;)

Any rate, it's not at all bad; Buffy's never gone as far as ""bad"". It's not, however, of consistent quality; neither, for that matter, was Season 4 of ""Angel"", which ran concurrently - both took on the most ambitious story arcs they had ever undertaken, and both just did not do quite that stellar a job of 'em. The reason seems to be found in ""Firefly"", yet another TV show Joss Whedon, the g*d of Buffyverse, began producing that year. He had managed two series quite fine up to that point; three proved a touch too much. Alas, Firefly got cancelled mid- first season, and we got Nathan Fillion and the lovely character of Caleb for Season 7 of Buffy out of it.

As atmosphere goes, Season 7 is definetely THE darkest one of them all - lots of night, distressed and abandoned characters wondering alone in it. Not so for content - the First Evil claims to be the thing that evil fears, but restrains itself to petty mindgames and scrambled plotting. Also, several episodes are obvious filler (as opposed to quality filler). Now, you have to have non story-arc episodes in the series, or your network will it you alive, but it don't have to be quite deliberate.

Lowdown: the Season here is not any less enjoyable than any other. The same great quality storytelling from everyone on cast and crew is still there, honed by 5.5 years on the jobs, but unlike the classical Seasons 3 or 5, number 7 does not paint a granite-solid coherent picture; some pieces of the puzzle just might have some ridgy edges here and there.

No need to re-tell the entire story arc here, but we all know that this season was the last, and the show had to spend some time tying up loose ends. The did quite well, considering that their hands were tied by actor availability for non-regulars (in fact, it's quite pleasent that David Boreanaz was able to visit at all).

So, is it bad? Now, it's really not, so just buy the damn thing.",1097452800,19,2177,4.473551637279597

Then again, the season six DVDs helped me like that season when I hadn't before. Let's hope that happens again. This season started off strong, and then swerved from good to bad during the middle, and then just kinda took a nosedive towards the end.

2138112,5,B0002XVKMC,"Season Seven of Buffy the Vampire Slayer was the final climax to what had become a seven year Televison epic.  Though many Buffy fans, including myself at times, were left wanting more of this or that from the show throughout this last season, let's be honest, Buffy fans: This season had some truly outstanding episodes, many remarkable performances, and finished the series on an extremely high note and in an artistically elegant and classy style.

While some Buffy fans believe the series' first five years were stronger than the last two seasons, I don't necessarily agree.  I believe that the series simply grew up. The teen angst issues and sometimes almost cartoon monsters our beloved characters battled in highschool (The Mantis Woman? The Mummy Girl? The Fish Team? The Giant Snake?) during the first three seasons shifted to more complex issues in seasons four and five as the Buffy gang faced that transitory period for young adults known as ""college"". Not surprisingly then, seasons six and seven explored issues correspondingly more adult, complex, and disturbing as our favorite characters matured.  I salute the series and all of the creative talent on Buffy for creating a living series, and in particular I salute Season Seven for supplying a strong, necessarily adult, and artistic finish to a truly unique and ground-breaking series.

So what more can be said of Season Seven? Let's just say this - the season story was good, the writing was great, and the acting was inspired.  Not any one of us got everything we wanted from Season Seven...but then, wasn't that the point?",1097280000,7,1595,5.0
2138113,4,B0002XVKMC,"I have been an avid Buffy watcher from early in the series. (first ep. i ever saw was ""Incan Mummy Girl"") I was So blown away. It is my favorite TV show of all time, which brings me to some of the dissapointment i felt from the last season. I think they may have tried to hard to make it OVER-ly epic. I know the storys of buffy haven't always had happy endings, but this season really fell into bitter despair, so much so, that the climactic ending couldn't raise my spirits. Speaking of endings... I felt that for a season that had built the storyline so arduously through from the beginning, that the last episode was rushed and felt like it was missing something. I'm particulary disturbed at the ""throw-away"" death of Anya. At least Tara's death had a point and meaning in the series and the death of Joyce was covered over 3-4 episodes. The death of Westly in Angel was much better handled... there should have been at least some meaningful dialogue between Anya and Xander. That being said, the main reason I didn't get ""into"" the final season has nothing to do with the story, or the writers. This beef has solely to do with the UPN. I couldn't believe how sporadically the new episodes were shown. They aired the first 3 shows, then.... the first 3 shows again, then they had some stupid beauty contest show on in its time slot for a few weeks. Shows like Buffy have a certain rythm that must be maintained and this on again, off again method of showing new ep.s was very damaging to the flow of the story. So... I'm hoping that watching it (within the span of a weekend :P) in it's entirety at a regular pace will help me catch the more subtle parts. All said, it is not the worst season of all (none are REALLY bad) that honor belongs to season 4, IMHO.(techno-frankenstein... come on.) Anywhoo, the worst episode of Buffy is better than the Best episode of any other show... except for angel :).",1097193600,5,1907,4.420454545454546

This season takes a full circle and brings back most of the crucial characters from the past six seasons.  But, they did miss one important person.  All through the season the villian morphs into past and present characters that have died, but they never mentioned or showed a version of Kendra, the first slayer to replace Buffy.  All in all, this was a good way to end the series.  There were just a few things that could have been done better, or at least different.",1097020800,,543,4.5
2138116,4,B0002XVKMC,"Some say, it should have been better if the series had ended two seasons ago. They are so wrong. I won't go into detail about why season six was so precious and probably the best thing we will ever get see on T.V--even if some of us don't really apreciate that-- 'cause this is a review for season 7. Obviously.

I was one of those people who started watching buffy, only months ago on DVD. I am a schmoe in comparison, yet i look back and i remember the good and the bad moments and finally we 're here in the final chapter. Most of us buffy fans, know this feeling of loss that one gets as he realizes, that he is witnessing the end of a masterpiece. It was a blast really, the hellmouth closing once and for all, some of our beloved characters, forever lost into oblivion, yet we all must have half-smiled(like she did), since we now knew at last what was that all about.

Season 7, was all about moving forward, by finishing off with the past that was haunting the future. The usual wit, campy fun and wisdom of the Jossverse, was here clear and present. The Big Bad, was indeed... BIG and yeah, there was no other way to diminish it but to go to hand to hand and epic.

This one, might have let some people down--but what the heck where they expecting, slaying ""doesn't usually lead to hugs and puppies""! Buffy ain't no european art-house flick nor your usual hollywood blockbuster, this one had to be down, dirty and hillariously funny with all it's characters and indeed it was. We  laughed at them, hated them, we understood them and in the end we loved them, all over again.

So what if the story arc was kind of over long, it still had some excellent individual episodes and it contained some of the most roaringly funny moments, not to mention NAthan Fillion as one of the most memorable baddies in the Buffyverse!

Plus, we got to see Michelle Trachtenberg being a real hottie... i'd buy that for a dollar! Eliza Dushku, was even hotter than Michelle, even mrs. Gellar, which was kind of a drag really but what the heck... Boreanaz was child-like funny, Anthony Head was once again the librarian we knew and loved and had the quotes that he only desrves ""The world is doomed"", Hannigan...a godess?!, Marsters with a soul(!)...what else could anyone hope for?

Anyway, Buffy, the vampire slayer was brought into a definite closure and  whatever you think on that matter, you could at least aknowledge this, Joss Whedon deserves major kudos for his work all these years.

Obviously, if you have the resources and you are a collector, you should tottally buy this one, it's a very worthy package for every buffy fan.",1096848000,12,2625,4.4978991596638656
2138117,4,B0002XVKMC,"Though certainly not anywhere near the best season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, this was a very good season, at least when we analyze it from the point of view of stand-alone episodes.
""Conversations with Dead People"" won a Hugo award (a very prestigious, international award for Science-fiction and Fantasy -- as an example, Robert Heinlein won four Hugo awards during his time as a science-fiction writer), and is one of the series' most hilarious episodes.  There are several outstanding episodes, some of them in the funny category, some in the drama/action/macabre categories.
The overall story of the season, however, I found pretty boring, and the second half went downhill.  There was still some interesting stuff in the mix, but compared to the storyarcs that we enjoyed during the last half of season 2, or the first half of season 5, for instance, the storyarc of season 7 is boring at best.
Still, a MUST HAVE for anyone that has seen the other seasons of this, arguably the best TV show ever  (yes, I AM serious!)",1096848000,5,1026,4.818181818181818

There were definitely high points, such as ""Lies my Parents Told Me.""  I look forward to seeing this show in a much higher quality than the poor broadcast signal I got on CBS (they played UPN programming in the afternoons).  The special features, no doubt, will offer the most complete summary of the series so far.  I look forward to Joss' commentary on this season that saw Buffy emerging as a strong individual who at once needs her friends but stands alone.  I couldn't stand the ""slayers in training,"" but maybe they appealed to the younger set.  All in all, it's a worthy buy, and a steal at Amazon.com.",1096675200,8,754,4.45985401459854

Bringing in DB Woodside from the woodwork was a great idea as the ""guy you don't like"", and the whole B/S storyline makes tears brim viewers eyes in almost every last 5 eps (especially in End of Days and Chosen). Storyteller is most probably the funniest ep of all time, and you also have the drama you might itch in such eps (Beneath you, Lies my parents told me, etc...).

Not the best season, but it does have its moments.  There are a lot of very cool scenes that help to tie the series together.  Bringing most (though sadly not all) of the characters back for the final season was a huge plus.

My only regret is the fate of Dawn, I really thought she should have been included with the potentials.

Also, and im not saying this is necessarily bad, is it just me, or does Xander really get a raw deal?  It seems like, of all the characters, he ends up with the least to live for at the end of it all.

The things they did and said, and the way that they acted were just so retarded and aggravating. They really didn't ""stand up"" to the slayer quota. The one other thing I didn't like is how, in the end, the surviving Potentials became slayers. Isn't the slayer supposed to be THE CHOSEN ONE, the ONE girl in all the world to possess great strength and power to protect the world from the forces of darkness? Well, that's what I thought.

2138125,5,B0002XVKMC,"I really enjoyed this last season of Buffy. Sure, I was kind of annoyed by the potentials. Not because they were there, just because they took time away from other characters (where the hell was Xander this season?) The Big Bad was a great last villian because if you're going to go out on top, you should have the first original evil to battle, right? I loved Buffy and Spike's relationship this season. It was built on trust, not on lust. I actually liked the character of Kennedy. Sure, she's no Tara, but Willow needed her and she was great for her in that aspect. I kind of wished they would have focused some more on Xander and Anya's relationship. We had 'Selfless' which was wonderful, and then we see them as buddies. Later on, their relationship seems built on sex, not love. It was nice to have Giles back for a good portion of the season. I loved how Buffy no longer needed a watcher, and they spent most of their time on different pages. This season was really about power. Buffy's got it and still isn't respected for it. After she is kicked out of the house, they realize just how much they need her. Caleb was an interesting villian. I liked how this season was all about girl power so it was appropriate to have a female hating villian. Well, Buffy sure showed him, huh? It was great to see some familiar faces. Faith returns for the final few episodes after helping out Angel in L.A. We see the Mayor, Drusilla, Warren, Glory, and the Master all in the form on the First. What can I say about the last episode? It was truly amazing. I remember when it first aired, I cried so hard during the second half I couldn't even hear what was happening. Thank God for VCR's and recording. There was so much to wrap up in that final episode. We got a visit from Angel and an explosive battle down in the Hellmouth. The best part of the episode is the throw-back to the first season, when Buffy, Willow, Xander, and Giles were the original gang. Friendship has always been a huge theme in this show and it's amazing to see everyone's transformation from season one to seven. The twist ending was amazing as well: using the power of the scythe to make every potential a slayer... Brilliant. The last shot of the entire series is just perfect. What a great finish to the best series television has ever seen.",1095897600,23,2313,4.4192037470726
2138126,4,B0002XVKMC,"Season 7 of Buffy wasn't quite as good as season 5 (or 3) but it did make for a great end to the story.  This season's 'big bad' was introduced in the first episode (unlike most other seasons) but it is only in retrospect that you will understand it.

After the poor reviews of the ""darkness"" of season 6 (more along the lines of a 20-something rut) the show's executives made the decision to make this season a bit more cheery.  Very few of the characters want to die, and getting through the day is no longer arduous.  It wasn't all candy canes and puppy dogs though, there was quite a bit of melancholy and the struggle to define yourself...a natural progression into adulthood that those of us about the same age as the characters will understand better than younger viewers.  Buffy learns to stand alone, without her safety nets, and realizes that she can do so...but she's prefer to have her friends around.

Character development in season 7: Buffy basically grows up.  Instead of pouting and kvetching about her lousy lot in life, she decides to take a more active role in determining events around her, even when her friends & family disagree...and eventually decides she's had enough of being the one-and-only chosen one.  Willow begins the season basically curled up in the fetal position, afraid of what she'd become at the end of season 6.  By the end of the series, she's much more confident in her own power.  Xander and Anya both settle down quite a bit, reconcile themselves to their position in life (which is somewhat depressing, actually.)  Giles, like many parent-figures, has trouble letting go of his authority.  Dawn is growing up, making decisions and taking responsibility.  Spike is this season's anomaly, since he regained his soul at the end of season 6.  At first he's nearly insane, then suffers from a split personality, only to finally emerge at the end as a true champion of good.  Faith also made a return to Sunnydale, by which she finally found some peace & redemption within herself.  A lot of new characters were introduced, including Robin Wood who, while allied with Buffy, managed to make some waves and opened up the children-of-slayers plot line.  Caleb, the insane priest of evil, was one of the most interesting villans since Angelus of season 2, because he was just so wicked (and had a lot of fun in the process.)

The worst part of the season were the potential slayers.  I realize that they had to be there in order to facilitate the end of the story, but good lord they were annoying.  Particularly Kennedy got on my nerves.  The character was bad, but the actress was worse, and a lot of Tara fans (myself included) were flabbergasted to think that Willow could go from one extreme to the other.  Granted, there's not a large Lesbian population on the show to choose from, but still... The other potentials were even worse, I'm just glad they didn't get too much screen time.  The best one was Chao-Ahn, because it was so funny to watch everyone misunderstand her.  Another low point was the Spike-Buffy relationship (or lack thereof,) I really wanted to see them knockin' the boots again.  But I suppose that was the point (love -vs- sex) and I can overlook that.

All in all, I liked season 7.  I'd advise true fans of the series to purchase it.  My favorite episodes were ""Conversations with Dead People,"" ""Lies My Parents Told Me,"" ""Dirty Girls,"" and ""Chosen.""",1095811200,15,3416,4.695798319327731

Secondly, EVERYONE else affiliated with Buffy the Vampire Slayer are great people, they're geniouses and gods/goddesses in my mind.

And last but not least, season 7 is awesome.  All of the episodes are wonderful and the extras that are on the DVD are cool.

and, since obviously spike was in the 7th season, I loved it.

his story aside, I liked how the potentials' purpose and danger folded out. PLus the addition of a previously-unheard-of uber-vamp. Plus the return of Faith and Giles.

the only thing I was disappointed with was Willow and Kennedy and their emotional connections. Althoguht I really liked how the did the willow/warren thing adn the convos they had were good dialogue, but I never felt that they really liked each other.

2138149,5,B0002XVKMC,"Buffy finnally got back on track this year, the show was amazing its first 3 years on the air, and then fell into sort of a tiny slump halfway through fourth season.  Now, don't get me wrong 4-6th seasons were great. I would give them 5 stars as well it's just that the show was different, angel was gone, oz leaves, buffys done with high school, giles is out of a job, and etc.  Now i understand they need to change the show. You cant have the same thing over and over again, but it just didn't seem quite as classic as buffys first 3 seasons.  One thing that really let me down was that after forth season they changed the stunt doubles and stunt coreographer and the fight scenes weren't as cool anymore. Anyway, while seasons 4-6 had amazingly shocking and heartfelt moments and great episodes i just didn't quite feel they matched the finesse of seasons one through 3. Buffys seventh season seems to be much more in the direction of seasons 1-3.  The storeis were riveting and the arch was intense.  Buffy ended with a bang and it was a great seaon to go out in.  while i love every seaon of buffy every season also has a few minor low points, but they don't take away from the whole at all.  This seasons low points in my opinion was not doing enough with faith, turning buffy into a bit of a B**** towards the end of the year, and the too short appearance of angel.  but these are just minor things and don't really even matter on the buffy season 7 scale.  This season was the best in a long time and i have watched buffy sence day 1 so all you people who came in at season 4 and think that this season wasn't the same as seasons 4-6 should check out seasons 1-3 if you want the true essence of BUFFY.  Oh yeah, and if anyone from buffy reads this please make a buffy movie already!!",1095638400,4,1791,4.2105263157894735
2138150,2,B0002XVKMC,"I would never believe that anyone could absolutely destroy the Buffyverse like the writers in Season 7 did.  Let me list the ways in which this season sucked.  First of all, my absolute favorite character, Willow, started off in a direction that was pleasing to me, but the writers decided that they HAD to have her in a relationship, so they stuck her with Kennedy, who was by the way, one of the worst characters and actresses put on this series.

Bringing back Faith was a brilliant idea, yet it was poorly executed (unlike in the 4th season of Angel where she excelled).  The actress had nothing to work with, and I felt she was left ""in limbo""....never really making a dent in the storyline.

Xander became a shadow of his former self, not to mention how boring Giles was!  When Xander's eye got squashed, I shrugged my shoulders, not really caring for him at this point.  What a whiney queen he became!  A little too self-righteous for my tastes.

Anya character became the one person in this season who I liked, especially in the episode where she decimated the entire frat house.  Unfortunately, her redemption was muted by the fact that she was sliced in half.  They never really did explain TO MY SATISFACTION, why Xander broke up with her.  It never made any sense given how close they were to begin with (remember episode where he comments to her how she ""makes him feel like something no one else has made him feel.....like a man"".

and now to the mythology portion of my dislike.  The Big Bad started off pretty good, but was killed so conveniently by a scythe out of NOWHERE in the last couple episodes.  And although Angel was finally brought back into the series, his part was nothing more than window dressing.  He may as well have been a mannequin.

There were only a few good episodes in this, but nothing to justify 22 episodes worth of storyline.  What a shame.  As much as I loved Season 6, I think they were better off to end the series at 5.",1095638400,18,1966,4.487323943661972
2138151,4,B0002XVKMC,"This wasn't the best season by far of Buffy, but it was a lot better than many other shows of a similar genre.  In the final season they did a lot to try to take you back to the beginning.

It tried to incorporate a lot of previous characters from the show.  Going as far as bringing back Angel, which is impressive since his show is on a different channel.  They return to the newly constructed Sunnydale High. Buffy returns to Sunnydale, only now as a counselor hired by the principal.  Dawn is attending her first day of school in Sunnydale High much like Buffy.  She also meets two friends through meetings with the undead.  They were intended to be Dawns sidekicks if there was to be a spinoff show starring her character.

The Big Bad this season was from a season three episode ""Amends"". It is known as the first, claims that it was the first evil consciousness ever.  It is able to take the form of anyone that has died, and has many minions.  The most visible are the Bringers, a group of cultists that worship the first and all have no eyes.  It attempted to torment Angel into turning back into Angelus out of hopelessness and vanishes after it fails.

This season has a feeling of desperation right from the beginning.  You see people running from strange robed figures and being killed with wicked looking knives throughout the early part of the season with no explanation.  The gang is being attacked from the start and seeing the dead speaking to them as the first.  The Scoobies themselves are in chaos;  No one really trusts Willow when she returns.  Xander is still dealing with the loss of Anya, and focusing on work, and still falling in love with demons.  Spike is dealing with his newfound soul, and being tormented by the First.  Anya is settling back in as a vengeance demon.

All in all this was a decent season, not as good as some of previous seasons, but not the worse.  They had a lot of good stand alone episodes and some good story arcs.  As well as getting into some other ideas they never really explored early in the series.  The main one being the potential slayers, the first slayer, and the only slayer to have a child.

Season Highlights include

Lessons:  The gang is back at the newly constructed Sunnydale High, Buffy as a counselor, and Xander as the head of construction.  But strange things are going on, someone was causing the dead to rise, and a group is chasing down young girls all over the world and killing them.

Beneath You:  Anya is back to her old tricks and Buffy finds out that Spike now has a soul.

Same Time Same Place:  Willow returns from England to return to the gang, but is nervous.  No one seems to see her, and people are ending up dead and skinned.

Help: Buffy has her first day as a counselor where she encounters a young girl who claims to see her death in the near future.  Buffy makes every effort to find out how and save this girl.

Selfless:  Anya's character is finally explored after she causes the grisly death of an entire frat house due to a vengeance contract.  You get to see her history with Olaf the troll and some of her famous periods of time as a vengeance demon.

Him:  Hilarious episode; a boy seems to have a strange hold on any who see him.  They will obsess about him and do anything possible to win his favor, sometimes with dangerous results.  First Dawn falls under his spell, then other members of the gang do with disastrous results.

Conversations with Dead People:  Several stories are going on at once in this episode.  Buffy encounters a former classmate turned vampire that does psychoanalysis on her when they recognize each other.  Willow is talks with Cassie who says she is back from the dead with a message from Tara.  Dawn has a strange encounter with a poltergeist.  The remnants of the nerd trio, Jonathon and Andrew, return from Mexico, and seem to know something is going on.

Never Leave Me:  Spike has been brainwashed somehow, and the gang has him tied up at the house.  They capture Andrew and hold him at the house to answer some questions.  But the Bringers attack and make off with Spike in the melee, for use in a dangerous ritual over the hell mouth.

Bring on the Night:  Buffy tries to return to where she originally encountered the first, and finds a scary vampire called a Turok-Han, a vampire that vampires fear and is nearly killed.  Giles arrives at Sunnydale as the last survivor of the Watcher Council with some of the potential slayers.

Showtime:  More potentials arrive at the house in Sunnydale.  A girl that seems to be a potential turns out to be the First, and it gives a cryptic warning.  Buffy shows that the Turok-Han can be harmed for the potentials.

First Date:  Buffy finds that principal Wood was the son of a slayer.  Andrew decides to join the slayers.

Get It Done:  Wood gives Buffy a bag of some of his mother's belongings.  They have some items that pull Buffy to meet the Aboriginals that created the first slayer, and they offer her power for a price.

Storyteller:  Andrew decides to keep a documentary to show future generations, or to keep a record in case they fail.  Outbreaks are occurring all over, and apparently Andrew is responsible due to his actions at the Hell mouth.  They think that his blood is needed and he has to face his actions.  Funny episode.

Lies My Parents Told Me:  The gang is looking for the trigger to Spikes brainwashing.  They have to go into his history and really explore him as a character.

Dirty Girls:  The first unveils his new weapon, the insanely powerful Caleb.  The gang faces its first taste of defeat at the hands of its enemy, Xander is badly wounded. Faith returns to Sunnydale

Touched:  The gang decides that Buffy is irrational, and places Faith in charge.  Buffy decides to attack Caleb directly and finds that he has uncovered a powerful weapon.  Faith and the gang stumble into a trap laid for them by the First.

Chosen:  The final battle, you'll have to see it.",1095379200,17,5970,4.51498127340824
2138152,4,B0002XVKMC,"If I had to make a list of my top five favorite shows of all time, Buffy the Vampire Slayer would definately be on it. I have been a loyal fan of the show since the first season and it has continued to amaze me with the fantastic writing, acting, humor, and action. Both seasons five and six were amazing and that is why I got my hopes up, especially considering the fact that this was going to be the show's last season. Unfortunately, season seven took a step back from the stellar fifth and sixth seasons. While season seven was definately watchable and a good season overall, it suffered from the same weakness as season four did. Both seasons four and seven had Buffy become a part of something much larger than working together with the ""Scooby gang"". Season four had Buffy working with the Iniative, and season seven had Buffy training potential slayers to fight the upcoming battle. The best aspect of the show is the interaction between the main characters, and when you stray away from that aspect of the show, the season will suffer.

However, even watching Buffy the Vampire Slayer at its weakest, is still better than most of the other shows on television. While the overall storyline for season seven was the worst one since the fourth season, there was some very good stand alone episodes, and this season also featured one of the best villans to ever come out of the show in Caleb. Not to mention the brief but satisfying return of Angel near the end of the season, despite the fact that Buffy left the WB to go to UPN. Season seven also reopens Sunnydale High, which introduces a cool new character in Principal Wood who is the son of one of the slayers that Spike killed. This was perhaps my favorite aspect of season seven because even though Spike now has a soul, Principal Wood secretly plots to gain vengenance on Spike. Also, the one good thing to remain from season six was Andrew who serves as comic relief. He is tired of being evil, and struggles over the course of the whole season to try and become one of the group and prove himself. The funniest thing about it, is the fact that Buffy and the gang take him hostage at the beginning of the season to extract information, and then cannot get the guy to leave afterwards. Season seven also does a good job with the relationship between Spike and Buffy as well. A few episodes worth mentioning are ""Selfless"" which gives flashbacks into Anya's life as a vengenance demon, ""Conversations with Dead People"" which offers five seperate stories that has the gang encountering a paranormal force which spells future doom, ""Storyteller"" which focuses on Andrew creating a documentary on Buffy's life as a slayer, and the last two episodes of the season in ""End of Days"" and ""Chosen"" which offer a very fitting end to the show.

Unfortunately all good things must come to an end, and I was sad to see the show wrap up. Although I was somewhat dissapointed with this season overall, it is still worth owning for fans of the show because of some fantastic episodes, the relationship between Spike and Buffy, and the introduction of two cool new characters in Principal Wood and Caleb. This is also perhaps the one time where the DVD extras are more of a reason to buy the set than the episodes themselves. You get four featurettes, a gag reel, commentary on seven different episodes, and more.

In S7 we see the show retreating back into its childhood, returning to Sunnydale High and trying to recapture past glories but it's far too late. What we get are unrecognizable characters, not grown up or matured, simply utterly changed. The same goes for the writing. The trademark humour is in short supply and what we get instead makes me think that they must have had 'Prozac' as a sponsor.

2138155,5,B0002XVKMC,"In the first 5 seasons of Buffy, you saw Buffy being her normal self: cheerful, sarcastic, and endearing.  At the very end, she is faced with the death of her mother, becoming the guardian of her ""sister"" & having to run a household, and trying to defeat the undefeatable: a mad god trying to destroy the world. In this last season of BtVS, she is pushed to the edge.  ""The First"" evil is back with a plan to kill all the potential slayers and also Buffy to be able to take over the world.  Not only does she endure having to train potential slayers with absolutely no powers, facing off with Caleb (who is much more powerful than her), the betrayal of her Watcher, she also the the ultimate weight of the world on her shoulders: this might, for once, be a losing war.  Don't expect Buffy to be cheerful, sarcastic, and endearing in the last season.  She died in Season 5, brought back from heaven and detached from the world because of it in Season 6,  so who wouldn't be disgruntled and un-peppy.  This season gives Buffy a more, tough ""this is how slayers"" should be persona.

2138178,3,B0002XVKMC,"""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" had, overall, a brilliant run on television, however, in the seventh, and final year of BtVS, the show slipped painfully into mediocrity. The plot holes were glaringly obvious and the people we had watched for years: Buffy, Xander, Willow, Giles, etc., were written badly, making them scarcely recognizable from their former-selves. They were all suddenly behaving, and doing things completely out of character, and sometimes just plain illogical. Some, such as Buffy herself, became cold, distant, humorless, and unlikable, even to die-hard fans. And all of them became almost unbearble to watch. Add that to the introduction of a host of new, poorly-developed, and just plain annoying characters and you have a show that was once something great, loose all of its creativity, humor, wit, originality, and sparkling brilliance - everything that made it such a huge cult phenomenom. This was a bitterly disappointing season for most fans, who expected, and had always before gotten a remarkable television show from creator Joss Whedon. What makes the direction the show took even worse is that this was the last season, and one that should have left viewers wanting more. I am sad to say that I am glad the show ended so that we would not have to endure more seasons like this one. If you are a loyal fan of ""Buffy,"" buy this DVD set to complete your collection. After all, there are still moments worthy of watching, with wonderful episodes such as ""Conversations With Dead People,"" ""Selfless,"" snd, of course, ""Chosen."" If you are only vaguely interested in BtVS, do not waste your money. Watch this season in syndication before you make the decision to buy this DVD set.

What a waste of a once great show...though they never were able to recover after graduating high school and losing Angel & Cordelia. What's remarkable about this season is how unremarkable it truely is. They practically never leave that house and the plot is so filled with holes that you could drive Giles's Citroen right through it.

2138181,4,B0002XVKMC,"""Buffy..."" is with out a doubt a Cult Classic Television Show, and it was really good programming in general. The show based on Vampire and Demon slaying had a strong cast of individuals that really connected. The story lines sometimes riveting and other times not so much. The question everyone was asking is why is the show ending. Well as a mere fan i have my opinion. After Season Six, which i believe to be one of the few where certain characters grow up fast, our Slayer and Scoobies just seem to be hanging around in that house. I mean sure they have the Big Bad that happens to be the First ( The original Evil on Earth) which they have to slay. But... take a look at Anya, Dawn, Xander, and Spike. These four characters just seem to be floating. There is no solid perpose for them throughout the season. Giles too. Everyone seems to be there, but really should be moving on, almost as thought something else needs to be done. These characters reached a point where they needed to move on. Their stories have been told and it was a satisfying finale. I believe this season to be one of the darkest ones. What i mean is that its a lot more hit and run scare tactics in the dark of night Dark, not like Season 5 Dark where life was dealing our friends a nasty deck of tarot cards that made life seem almost not worth living. All in all if you've bought all the seasons like i have, you cant leave this one behind. its really Good!",1094601600,13,1436,4.283088235294118
2138182,5,B0002XVKMC,"Love or hate the final season of Buffy - one important fact cannot be overlooked, the complete circle the series and characters took while at the same time growing into a more evolved and mature show.  I highly recommend you view this season, but only after viewing the previous 6.  The show did take a different direction and focused in on the First and the Slayer, but this is not a negative, just a completion.

I agree with many that the series finale should have been a bit longer.  There were so many details and points made in this episode that to a casual viewer, it would be overlooked.  To those true fans of BTVS you will see how far the show has come.  If unsure yourself, it is best to view season 1 again, especially the final episode of season 1.  You see Buffy mature from being told she is the ""chosen one"", the only one, into a cunning fighter with her new-found scooby friends, then dependant upon them, and finally into an individual who learns to at once take on responsibility, and share responsibility.  You see the other characters mature into heroes of their own and for all their weaknesses, the strenth the gang has is in its unity.  That was the one thing that made Buffy more powerful than previous slayers and this is touched upon as well.

The sacrifices made by the scoobies is also noted, although little attention is given to the brave death of Anya, and the final episode gives a tribute to a great scene from the final episode of season one in which the Fab Three are walking away from Giles and his utterance of ""the earth is doomed"" is as sharp and funny now as it was then.  The final episode of season 7 ends in the only way that the series can - answering all the questions the show asked with hope and bravery.

2138183,5,B0002XVKMC,"i don't fully understand the negative buzz surrounding 6 and 7.  the reason there not like 1 2 and 3 is because they arent.  people grow up sometimes its inevitable.

ive watched season six a quite a few times and im still looking for the so called ""darkness"".  the sixth season had lots of funny little gems.  i guess some of us figured willow was perfect.  bad things happen in life and the season pointed it out.  the reason the show is good because its not beat up a monster and see ya next week.  they attack the life issues.  maybe some of us never had sex with someone we wish we didnt.  maybe some of us have never took something a little to far.  i guess what im saying is give it a chance.

season 7 had some of the best eps ever.  conversations with dead people can compete with any episode they have.  ive actually heard people complain that willow was to wimpy in this season.  contradict much?  first its to hard to watch her be evil now its to hard to watch her try hard to be nice and more like herself.  i think we all need to turn of the siskel and ebert sides and see the show for what it is.  the best show that wasn't and never will be long enough otherwise why we would be here posting.  in closing there was two negatives to this season.  one the finale should have been 2 hours. two there didn't seem to be enough caring about anyas death.

2138184,3,B0002XVKMC,"The season started out with great potential like Season six but went down hill with very little to stand out as repeat viewing. This is the second season Joss Whedon was not fully invloved with the show and it's obvious. ""The first"" is the Big bad this season and he is bad when the story calls for it and then chucnks of episodes are just filler until he resurfaces again. Instead we get Main cast members with nothing to do and The Slayers getting much more screen time. This is unfair to the longtime viewers and the actors. We also get the wishy washy Buffy/Spike relationship which never should have taken place but did(yawn). Faith comes back but has little to do unlike her turn on Angel the same season and an ending that seems rushed. With all the lackluster episodes leading up to the finale, couldn't they  have done more to resolve the story, finish and then after the events that occur to save everyone in Sunnyvale, had an episode where we get a conclusion to everyone's story? Some character interaction instead of 10 minutes at the end of this episode.

This is an improvement after Season 6  but these last two seasons of Buffy were nowhere near the quality of the last two of Angel and I keep thinking Joss should have ended it after Season 5.

I'll add this to my collection only because I have all other seasons and because there are a handful of decent episodes that were good I partially reccomend it for the die hards but let's hope we get a Big screen followup with the reuniting of Buffy and Angel like it should have been.",1094428800,12,1548,4.459363957597173
2138185,5,B0002XVKMC,"I'm just clearing up a few misconceptions about this season and its finale.

First of all, if you'd watch the Season 4 finale of Angel, you'd know that Angel didn't return to Sunnydale out of romantic interest towards Buffy. Wolfram & Hart gave him an amulet they said Buffy would need to fight the First. That's why he went to Sunnydale. Buffy & Angel's conversations after Season 2 have always gravitated toward they're want/but can't have of each other.

With that in mind, a good Series Finale isn't about closing out the Season, its about closing out the totality of show. Angel was a huge part of Series, Faith was too. Joss Whedon had to close out those left over storylines. I'm actually disappointed because I would have liked to see Cordelia return to Sunnydale with her newfound maturity and fighting skills. Alas, she was in a coma.

End Scene - Xander shortly recognized and was visibly hurt by Anya's death. Buffy never publicly showed affection for Spike.

In the End Joss Whedon went for a happy ending, who would want to leave this great series with all the characters crying.

Final Note - The way I see it there were only two ways to end this series. Killing Buffy, making Faith the only Slayer, or by making ""being the Slayer"" mean a little less. Joss Whedon made the right decision. With ""Angel"" canceled and a TV movie supposedly in the works its good know that one day we might see Buffy again, Sarah Michelle Gellar willing of course.",1094428800,8,1458,4.613899613899614
2138186,5,B0002XVKMC,"Season seven, in my opinion was the most brillant season yet. It brought Buffy back to a place that season four had taken her out of. Everyone was their old self again, with the exception of Willow dealing with almost destroying the world. Extramly well written and directed, especially ""conversations with dead people"", everyone was at the top of their game. And I believe Joss Whedon wrapped the whole thing up wonderfully (their ain't nothing like watching the hellmouth imploding in on itself). I am sad to see the show leave, and the optimist in me is hoping Joss is working on some kind of other spin-off (do something already!), but if it had to go I'm glad it went like this. If you are a buffy fan this is a must own, and if you're not a buffy fan...why are you reading this?

Just, alot of mistakes and contradictions. For instance in the first chapter, buffy says to dawn,""That's okay, I missed the heart my first time too."" then she thinks,""Just a little white lie"".....SHE Did miss the heart.

2138198,4,B0002XVKMC,"Not as strong as previous seasons but good. One of the strengths of the show has always been the excellent balance of humor and drama and season 7 has this too.

My main complaint is that the writing is kind of wishy-washy and cowardly. There seems to be a romance developing between Buffy and Spike but the writers appear unwilling to completely commit to the story. However, I give the writers credit for managing to redeem Spike after season 6. That was a very tough task but they did a great job.

Season 7 has several interesting storylines: the redemption of Spike; Buffy coming to terms with the romantic feelings for him that she's always tried to deny; Anya and Xander sorting out their relationship post-jilting at the altar; Faith's return and reconciliation with Buffy; Willow overcoming her reluctance to use magic and moving on after the tragic death of Tara.

The Potentials are not that interesting and in fact, I found them annoying when I first watched this season. However, after seeing the whole season and reviewing the episodes in reruns, I grew to like some of them, especially Vi and Amanda.

There are a number of great episodes including Lessons, Selfless, Conversations with Dead People, Sleeper, Never Leave Me, Lies My Parents Told Me, and Dirty Girls. However, the finale, Chosen, is a huge let-down. Angel's appearance is odd and just eats up time. Buffy and Angel had previously agreed that their relationship is going nowhere and hadn't even talked to each other in well over a year. I don't understand why he suddenly decides to try to rekindle their relationship. It's interesting that this time it's Buffy's choice to not be with Angel but this should have been covered in another ep. The only characters who belonged in the series finale were those who were there for most of the season, not someone who hadn't appeared on the show in years.

My other complaint is the end scene. I guess I'm supposed to feel happy that a certain group survives but I can't because their behaviour in the final scene is self-absorbed and disrespectful. They're smiling and joking moments after several people who fought by their side just died. It would have been appropriate for them to mourn a bit for the people who sacrificed their lives.

I have to disagree with the recommendation by an earlier reviewer to buy the Chosen novelization. The novel is esentially episode quotes mixed in with a lot of Nancy Holder's personal opinions. She obviously did not consult with series creator Joss Whedon before writing it because it contradicts his statements on the Buffy/Spike relationship and does not reflect his views on the final episode at all (see Whedon's Chosen commentary on the season 7 DVD). Besides, it contains many spelling and grammatical errors.",1094256000,29,2779,4.864693446088795

The writing was terrible, the plot was terrible, the whole thing was just a mess and nowhere near the quality the preceding ones.  My advice is to just pretend it didn't happen and that the series ended with season 6's Grave.

First of all, whose brilliant idea was it to waste screen time on the unbelievably irritating potential slayers?  Their lines weren't even remotely funny, and all they did was distract from the core group who we know and love and who should've made this season worth watching.  Unfortunately it just didn't seem like any of the actors' hearts were in it, and I can't really blame them for their lack of enthusiasm over their material.  James Marsters (Spike) had to act insane, Alyson Hannigan (Willow) had to feign interest in the extremely unconvincing Kennedy, Nicholas Brendon (Xander) was practically replaced by Andrew and had an eye gouged out, and Anthony Head (Giles) was unnecessarily dragged back onto the cast.  Worst of all, Sarah Michelle Gellar (Buffy) was saddled with ridiculous speeches about power and heroism, and had to fawn over Spike continuously as part of a relationship which was painfully forced in order to pander to a group of fans.

Even without the glaring misjudgments in plot and character development, the overall writing, pacing and tone of the season were severely flawed.  I just couldn't bring myself to care about the group's problems with Spike's behavior or the first evil (which was basically a failed attempt to force some dramatic or emotional intensity by bringing back older characters) - they simply didn't approach the rollercoaster ride of events that was seasons 5 or 6.  The writers also thought for some reason that fans enjoy unoriginality, and repeatedly reused lines from earlier in the series; the quick wit and cleverness of earlier seasons is completely gone here.  If they were aiming for a light tone, they failed miserably, and if they wanted it to be dark, they didn't do it as well as seasons 5 or 6.  All pretense of making  Buffy normal and possible to relate to was also abandoned, in favor of excessive and contrived slayer mythology.

The only positive aspects of this season are the final episode, Chosen, which still doesn't approach the series' high points, and the slight improvement in Dawn's character.  I anticipate special features involving the cast (finally) in order to get fans to buy this set, but the material just isn't worth it - 6 seasons of this amazing show will have to be enough to be satisfied with.  If you've convinced yourself that because this is Buffy, it must be good, then go for it, but otherwise stay well away.",1094256000,20,2766,4.791578947368421
2138201,5,B0002XVKMC,"It's hard to say much about this without seeing the bonus features, which are always good.  Of course there will be some nice easter eggs that I'll be too dumb to find, but even if the DVD set was bare-bones, it would still be a worthwhile purchase.

Seventh season...so much went on. From the beginning, it was good. Dawn became more than just the little sister/ball of energy in human form. She started to become part of the Scooby Gang. Unfortunately for Dawn, the really being a part of the group fell apart later, but it was nice to see that she could play a meaningful part.

Also in the beginning of the seventh season, we see good ""Ol' Reliable"" Willow making the transition back from evil, ""black-eyed baddy."" When the only ones who can see her upon her return are the members of the group that aren't really trusted, the demon contingent, things start to go terribly wrong.

Later in the season, a foe from season 3 returns, and this time it's the Big Bad. All hell breaks loose, Xander even gets noticeably hurt, Willow finds a new love (yeah, that's Kennedy... something wasn't right there, but hey, good for Willow, right?)... even with all the gore, and all the apocalypse-style demons, this season maintains the human feeling that the show has always had, which is nice, because that means Buffy never really ""jumped the shark"". Some people didn't like the sixth season for being dark, but whether you liked that season or not, this one is a nice conclusion...though the fact that it's the conclusion is kind of a sad fact, but Buffy the Vampire Slayer ends with a powerful, powerful, Whedon-directed episode that reminds us all why we love Buffy, or why we should.

This season feels to me like the first season to really pay attention to early Buffy, which is what got most of us hooked, I'm sure.

Speaking of getting hooked, if you aren't already, and you clicked on this product by accident, or you thought ""heh. I'll make fun of some stuuuupid Buffy fans"" you're a lot like I used to be.  I was at summer camp when I really started to hear about Buffy, since I'd never gotten the WB or UPN, and my friends kept singing the Buffy songs and quoting it at me. I made fun of them, said, ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer? That is so lame!"" until I got home, when I was bored to death one day, and saw that FX was showing Buffy. I decided to watch it, but the episode was half-over so I had to watch another one to come to a full conclusion...and I couldn't stop. The music, the quotes...so good. And that's just on the surface. After a while, you really start to love the characters, more than any of the ones on Friends or anything like that.

I truly believe that although it may sound lame at first, Buffy is not just some silly teenage monster show. The monsters are just a different way of looking at everything, and by the end of the series, the way these creatures have developed is actually frightening.

I recommend that you buy the book ""Chosen"" by Nancy Holder which is an almost exact novelization of the seventh season, down to the characters' lines. It can help you figure out some things that may not have made sense at first. Even if you read ahead, it doesn't ruin anything if you read ahead, as long as you don't read the chapter devoted to the finale, Chosen, because there are so many surprises in that episode that really enhance the emotion.

I hope I haven't gotten too emotional, but this is really a worthwhile buy if you've already seen/bought the other seasons.",1094256000,5,3497,4.492913385826772
2138202,5,B0002XVKMC,"This simply put is the best show that ever was. if you already have the other six seasons then its a no brainer-get this set. its the seventh and final season. it was great on every level, it gave us true buffy fans a little bit of everything-old friends-new friends-old enimies-new enimies- redemtion-love and closure-(ihate that word) it strung us through seven years of continuity-  perfect just perfect-the only other thing i wish to say is own it",1094256000,2,451,4.782051282051282
2138203,5,B0002XVKMC,"Season 7 was by far the most touching of seasons for me. This is where all the years of love, hate, experience, betrayals, forgiveness, friendships, enemies & redemption culminate. Buffy has finally become an adult and she doesn't even realize it.  Giles has pretty much used up all of his ""watcher & father figure"" knowledge and skills. Xander has become a true fighter and not just the ""loyal"" one.  Willow has found redemption and embraces her power, Dawn has become older and does have a mind of her own, Spike has bounced back from the brink of evil insanity to prove to ALL he is worthy of redemption and trust. Anya, although still a little ""out there"" from season 6 proves her love of the human race.  Andrew finds redemption and an adoration for Anya and the rest of the gang.  Kennedy, though whiney, bossy and boring adds an element of real life with those qualities since most of us know people just like her.  And Faith, awww Faith, Good Ol Faith. She along with Spike, prove they are worthy of still being on the earth. The appearance of Angel leaves some of us feeling a little nostalgic for the old days, but not feeling too bad since the series Angel helped to calm the desire to see old Mr. Broody.  Robin Wood was a much needed character to help pull in some of the long distance past.  Caleb, to me, was one of the most eery ""creatures of the night"" I saw on Buffy. It was his outward appearance of a ""normal"" human, mixed with the ""evil buffy"" made my spine tingle. There's nothing more creepy than an evil, all powerful, black-eyed, twisted-Bible-quoting-deep-south-accented preacher. YUCK.  Thats not to say that the See'ers and the Ubervamps were nice and pretty.  When you get a good look in those crazed blue eyes of the Ubervamps it makes your average everyday blood suckers seem childlike. Haha.....Overall, I think the series was nicely summed up and I have to say, regardless of certain seasons that were weaker than others, the entire Buffy series is my very favorite out of all other shows on television.",1094169600,12,2036,4.617728531855955
2138204,5,B0002XVKMC,"This season of Buffy was a welcome improvement on Season 6, with all its depressing Willowness. During 7 Spike, Anya, Andrew and most important of all Buffy get much better treatment and chances to show all their sides. Kennedy was a waste of space, but the less said about her the better. Caleb also was rather dull as a henchman to The First. SMG was brilliant when playing the ultimate evil, The First in its Buffy incarnation. As much as I am a huge Spike fan, he sometimes shows limitations in his ability to convey subtle things with his appearance, but he delivers his lines perfectly. Xander's character was largely played out by this point, but he is played perfectly. I think Dawn often gets a bad rap. Michelle T. did the best that can be done with the character, but the idea that she would turn on her sister in favor of a bunch of strangers frankly was not believable. As many others have noted in the past, it's hard to understand how important Giles was to moving story lines along until he was gone. I don't think its an accident that his presence improved Season 7. Robin Wood's character was explained efficiently and believably thanks to a single conversation with Giles.

But did the ending satisfy....sort of ...

Season 7 ended the series in a reasonable way, but fans can hope the talk of made for TV movies following Spike and some of the other Angel characters will open the door for a return by some of our favorites from Buffy. Especially Andrew, the Inspector Clouseau of the Slayer Sidekicks. And surely Joss can find a way to revive Anya to play opposite him.",1094169600,11,1590,4.555944055944056
2138205,5,B0002XVKMC,"This was a wonderful season of Buffy, the perfect follow-up to the dark and depressing season six. On the plus side you have the evolution of the Buffy-Spike relationship from icy mistrust to genuine friendship (Spuffy fans like myself will be very pleased), the redemptions of the ever-hilarious Anya (no more vengeance for you, sweetie) and Andrew, an odd sort of healing of the Xander-Anya relationship, the introduction of Andrew into the Scoobies for some much-needed comic relief, the odd yet touching chemistry between Andrew and Anya, no more whiny Dawn (she actually kills stuff in this season!), Giles in over half the season, some cameos by the old Buffy villains via The First, no Riley Finn appearances, Robin Wood and his intriguing but murderous grudge against Spike, the new villain Caleb, the return of a reformed Faith (redemption is contagious in the Buffyverse), the Slayer Scythe, and a finale that returns to and drives home the show's original message of female empowerment. It's also interesting to see Buffy go from student to mentor, and make some of the same mistakes with her slayers-in-training that Giles made with her in the earlier seasons.

On the down side you have Kennedy. Kennedy is to season seven what Dawn was to season six, only more annoying (yes, it's possible) and bossy to boot. Not to mention the horrendous acting on the part of the girl who plays her. The last thing I wanted to see was this little brat of a teenager and her tongue ring boinking Willow.

This was still a great season of Buffy though, and I can't imagine a better ending for the show. If you're going to buy only one season... get season four or five. But if you're going to buy two, make sure to add season seven to your collection.",1093996800,19,1749,4.75

Xander and Anya, work things out in a funny way, and Giles comes back to help the Scoobys one more time.

This season is full of surprises, and even in the darkers moments we can find that great humor in all the characters.

Some of the best episodes of the entire series came out of season 7, like 'Conversations with Dead People', 'Lies My Parents Told Me' and the hilarious 'Storyteller'. This season explores the Slayer lore in much greater depth than any of the past seasons and the actors' performances are even more outstanding than usual.

2138219,5,B0002XVKMC,"THE FINAL SEASON OF BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER

Although it's not the best season it was sure a kick ass season, to say the least and a kick ass finale to a fine show. The season starts off with Buffy becoming a school counseler, Spike returns with a soul, Dawn goes into the new high school, Willow returns from England and too many slayers to keep count. The first like 6 episodes are alright, but not that great and from then on it gets pretty good, with the story line of Andrew and Jonathan coming back into town, Spike's little trigger in his brain, the potentials, those blind guys, the first, those uber vamps, Giles' return, the secret life of Principal Robin Wood and his past, the return of Faith and the ever so prescense of that a-hole priest Caleb and the end of Sunnydale California. Sarah Michelle Gellar is still cute but doesnt it just seem like she doesnt care now. Tom Lenk spourts some of the best moments in this season with his geeky, motor mouthed Andrew, and I especially likes the episode Storyteller..fun stuff. Once again this season pays its dues to the talented acting of my main man James Marsters who still knows how to play Spike to the ends of the world. Nicholas Brendon and Alyson Hannigan bring Willow and Xander to the final days of Sunnydale and as does Michelle Trachtenberg with Dawn. Didnt Anya's death seemed forced and I bet Emma Caulfield was thrilled to be killed off. Anthony Stewart Head or as I like to call him Head Boy, brings Giles into his final days as well but it looks like Giles is getting to old for that S**t, don't you think. D.B. Woodside as Robin Wood...man, the brother brings in a nicely done role and with the sexual chemistry bewtween him and Eliza Dushku's Faith, man it's good writing. ah, returning again for this season is Adam Busch as Warren,Elizabeth Anne Allen as Amy, Juliet Landau as Drusilla and surprising guest appearances at the beginning by all the major bad asses. Lastly folks, we get down to the evil son of a preacher man known as Caleb, played with brass ones by Nathan Fillion. I seem to like Caleb better then Adam and the rest, though who can forget the hot and spicy Clare Kramer...hmm. This unravels a bunch of the past and a big smile for the future (hence Angel Season Five=best season) anyway, I guess Joss Whedon will live on in all of us when we purchase this DVD and all the rest at extremely high prices and remember the words of Spike so long ago "" I may be loves bitch but at least I'm man enough to say it"". So farewell far listeners and I hope you enjoy this DVD, which I will as well.",1093824000,3,2585,4.407949790794979
2138220,5,B0002XVKMC,"And so comes the end of an era. No show in the genre in recent memory has delivered the kind of fan hysteria and praise like Buffy. Joss Whedon is a god, and he delivers more goods for the seventh and final season of a show that has given nothing but top of the line product for 7 seasons. Coming off the controversial sixth season, season 7 went back to basics and felt more like it's old self. ""Lessons"" is a classic and wonderful premiere, showing that Sunnydale High has been re-built, and Dawn now attends the new buildind. Spike has gotten his sould back and is a blabbering idiot in the basement. Willow is is England with Giles recovering from ""Dark Willow"", and Buffy gets a job offer as the new school councelor. Plus, it has a very welcome return for some old familiar foes in a brillaint scene. ""Same Time, Same Palce"" has Willow finally coming home, but with results no one expected. The main big bad here is The First. The first evil that has no real shape itself, except for the forms of dead people it takes to manipulate our heroes. Aiding The first is the vampire The Turok-Han, or UberVamp. And finally, evil comes in the form of evil southern preacher Caleb, played by Nathan Fillion. Potentials from all over the world are being brought in to Sunnydale to train and fight the biggest evil once and for all. There are numerous highlights here. The return and welcome addition of Andrew to the Scooby Gang being one. ""Conversations With Dead People"" is a brilliant episode and one of the highlights of the season. ""Storyteller"" lets Andrew shine in a fun and entertaining way. ""Lies My Parents Told Me"" is a strong flashback episode dealing with Spike and his mother, and with the present day story of Principal Wood's own agenda towards Spike for his own mother reasons. The great Faith returns in one of the season's top highlights, ""Dirty Girls"", and remains for the last 4 episodes after that. There is good to be had with ""Selfless"" and ""Him"" as well. Season 7 isn't without it's flaws. It slows and gets real bogged down in the middle and late in the run with too many episode relying on dialogue and the training of the potentials. Still, there is enough goodness here to make up for it. The season is back to 'Girl Power', and the sentiment is driven home. The season really goes back to beginning and takes the show to a logical place that can only be the end. There was nowhere else to go. Once again, the writing is superb and the cast proves, one final time, that they were one of the best and most underrated ensembles on TV. The Emmy's should be ashamed. Sarah Michelle Geller carried this show with grace, elegance, heartbreak, strength, and humor. One of the finest leading performances on TV for the last seven years. The finale, ""Chosen"", is a rip snortin' conclusion with heartbreak, hope, and a feeling of new and wonderful beginnings. The final scene, while not splashy, speaks volumes in just that one frame. It is a beautiful and logistical swan song for our favorite heroine and her team of friends and fammily, and for a groundbreaking show that can never be, or ever will be, topped. It's an interesting and final journey, and I thank Joss and the cast and crew for giving this special little world of theirs to us every week. Buffy, you will be missed.",1093737600,22,3298,4.54453781512605

It was obviously decided after the some episodes were shot. That is the only way to explain the plot points that were dropped. We begin the season like Dawn at the rebuilt Sunnydale High is going to be integral only to never see much of her again after a certain point in the series.

Spike still carries the show but instead of going down the path of originality they recycle Angel's storyline in season 7. James Marsters is still a great actor and carries his part while doing his duty.

A very interesting villian and sidekick help give the season some good moments but overall it feels rushed.

2138222,2,B0002XVKMC,"With Sarah Michelle Gellar's growing disatisfaction over her role, it came as no surprise that she didn't extend her contract; thus making season seven of Buffy the Vampire Slayer the final season.  Beginning with a poor season primere written by series creator Joss Whedon, Buffy and her crew are thrown into conflict with an entity called the First (you'll remember it from the season three episode opposing Angel) who is gathering a massive army to destroy the world.  In the meantime, new characters are introduced including Principal Wood (D.B. Woodside), a new villain named Caleb (Firefly's Nathan Fillion), Andrew (Tom Lenk) becomes an unlikely ally, and rogue slayer Faith (Eliza Dushku) returns for the final battle.  For the most part however, season seven is erratic at best.  An early episode examining Anya's (Emma Caulfield) past is excellent, and ""Conversations With Dead People"" is great as well, but such storyline elements as Willow's (Alyson Hannigan) redemption and Spike (James Marsters) gaining a soul appear to build up steam but go nowhere fast.  The final episode ""Chosen"" is a solid piece of television on it's own, but even hardcore fans will find some kind of disappointment out of it as Buffy and crew fight the final battle to close the Hellmouth.  Season seven is undoubtadly the worst season of Buffy, and as a fan it's just sad that the show went out with a whimper instead of the proverbial bang.",1093651200,31,1431,4.991596638655462
2138223,4,B0002XVKMC,"In my mind, season seven was the second weakest of the Buffy seasons, the first of which belongs to the erratic season four.  With that said, it still maintains a high level of quality and polish, although it has considerable flaws.

""Potential"" is an ongoing theme throughout the season, and it describes the quality of the season also.  Season seven had the potential to be the greatest of the Buffy seasons.  The First was an amazing villain conceptually, and it had the opportunity to really get under the skin of the Scoobies.  With death such an important part of the show (""death is your gift"" anyone?) the First could have taken the guise of so many prominent characters that didn't appear; Jenny Calendar, Angel (well, not as the First anyway), Tara, Jesse, Kendra, etc.  But contract negotiations are a tricky business, so many of the dead people Joss wanted were unavailable, really weakening the First's execution.

The preacher Caleb was an attempt to touch on the hypocrisy of religiosity just as the Mayor was an attempt to touch on the hypocrisy of politics.  The latter worked, the former really didn't, although he wasn't ""terrible"".  Introducing a character like that so late in the game is setting yourself up for trouble.

But anyway, this season did have some of the best episodes of the series, including the anya-centric Selfless, the philosophical Conversations with Dead People, and the series-ending Chosen.  The reintroduction of the series with Lessons was also great, as were the profoundly funny Him and Storyteller.  Other standouts include Drew Goddard's Dirrty Girls (yes two r's) and the moving Spike reintroduction of Beneath You.

More than anything I wish Buffy would have received her reality-altering wish to bring Tara back, as Joss had said, (although it does sort of undermine her death, it still would be such an incredible moment, for Buffy to choose Willow's love instead of her own mother.)

But the season left few questions, and it resolved the series in a way that certainly left other possibilites open while still giving closer after 144 episodes.  It's a must-purchase for any Buffy fan.",1093651200,12,2140,4.988732394366197

I can't understand why so many fans don't like the season, this season bring back all that made Buffy so great in the first place: Action, comedy, horror, drama and an excellent story arc that had me at the edge of my seat wanting to know what was going to happen next.

This is the most focused season of all introducing the Big Bad at the season premire. I think that the First evil worked for the show, it was like no other monster, The First worked the characters weakneses and hurt them the most powerfull way possible. The season  never slows down giving us outstanding episodes in the way: Selfless, Conversations with dead people, Storyteller, Dirty Girls and Chosen all are some of the best episodes on the entire series. The rest of the season still excellent, Beneath You, Never leave me, Lies my parent told me and I can go on because the 22 episodes are great, for me the best season.",1093564800,5,996,4.437158469945355

Willow returns from England after Giles has been trying to help her after she went off of the deep end in magic. Then comes the potential slayers, which was a pretty interesting storyline in it's own.

2138246,5,B0002XVKMC,"Unlike other seasons of BUFFY, one needs to defend either a low or high rating for this season.  One can take either of two tacks with Season Seven.  One could give it a low rating based on comparison with other seasons of BUFFY, because there is virtually no debate that this is the weakest season in the show's seven.  On this criterion, I would probably give the set a three-star rating.  On the other hand, one could base the rating not in comparison to BUFFY's other seasons, but to other shows, and on this basis I don't see how you can give the season anything less than a five.  Yes, it is BUFFY's weakest season; yes, there are some serious errors made during the season; yes, the writing isn't as sharp or as consistent.  Nonetheless, it was during the 2002-2003 television season, along with ANGEL (which had its own problems in its Season Four), FARSCAPE (which while superb was not as nearly sharp as Season Three), and ALIAS, among the finest shows on TV.  It is my least favorite season of BUFFY, but given the option of watching either it or any season of LAW AND ORDER or FRIENDS or CSI, I would choose Season Seven of BUFFY in a nanosecond.

Warning:  Spoilers ahead.

So why do BUFFY fans find Season Seven to be so disappointing.  I think there are a variety of reasons.  Here are a few:  1)  Although there is some very sharp humor during the season (e.g., a conversation about fast food delicacies between Spike and Andrew on a motorcycle, after which Spike warns that he will kill Andrew if he ever tells anyone about it; Anya's asking Andrew why he doesn't use the bathroom for the same purpose everyone else does [not the purpose one might first imagine]; and a phenomenal first encounter between Faith and Spike, when she doesn't know that he now fights on the side of the good guys, and tries to slay him, with the two of them debating on who has reformed and who did so first), the humor isn't as consistent.  But the tone of the series changed.  Even in Season Six, the show maintained a humorous tone most of the time.  In Season Seven, there is a constant attempt to inject a sense of impending doom, which unfortunately alters the show's mood in unpleasant fashion.  Buffy almost completely ceased her quipping.  2)  Although Sarah Michelle has gained a number of detractors since the end of the series (I think mainly for her lack of interaction with fans), I always think she did a marvelous job in the only crucial role on the show.  Unfortunately, in Season Seven she was asked to do something that her character wasn't well equipped to do:  more or less be a great leader.  Buffy in the first six seasons was always more of her own person, not quite a loner, but although the central figure in the Scoobies as the Slayer, not a leader either.  But in Season Seven after the Potentials arrive, she is asked to be a leader.  What is worse, she is asked to lead not merely by example but by giving morale-boosting speeches in every other episode.  Unfortunately, the speeches were horribly written and awkwardly inserted into the episodes.  I was more put off by her General Patton speeches more than I was by the notorious ""cookie dough"" speech she gives Angel in the final episode.  3) Worse of all, the Potentials completely altered the structure of the show.  I know many people simply didn't like the individual actresses portraying the Potentials, but to me that wasn't what was so bad about them.  Because there were so many of them, they gradually started eroding the screen time left to deal with the stories of the main Scoobies.  Actually, Season Seven is very good up to the episode when the Potential start arriving.  The episode where Anya slaughters as vengeance demon all the members of a fraternity, only to repent after failing to convince both others and herself that this was what she really wanted to be doing, and then walks off by herself at the end of the story is quite as good as what we had seen in the previous two or three seasons.  But once the Potentials arrived, there simply wasn't room or time to deals with individual characters any longer.  Xander, Anya, Dawn, and Giles more or less get squeezed out of the story.  Only Buffy, Willow, and Spike, and later in the year Faith, get to have their stories told at all.  In Seasons One through Six, four or five or six or seven was company, but twenty proved to be a crowd.  4) The lameness of The First as the Big Bad.  Cementing this was the terrible use of the great use of Nathan Fillion (who was spectacular as Mal Reynolds in FIREFLY) as Caleb.

One other thing to lament about Season Seven was recently revealed by Joss Whedon, when he explained that they hoped to bring Tara back in Season Seven before contract negotiations broke down.  In an early episode, Buffy would somehow manage to gain the ability to make a single reality-altering wish.  Several alternatives are instantly imaginable:  wishing her mother back, lifting Angel's curse, perhaps not even being the Slayer.  Whedon imagined Buffy going to Willow and showing her new shoes, as if they were what she had used her wish for, Willow's incredulous reaction, and then Buffy telling her to look behind her, where Tara would have been standing.  Now that is an episode I would have liked to see.

But sometimes the negatives seem to mask the large number of extremely good things in Season Seven.  For instance:  1) Except for ""Him"" (where Buffy and Dawn fight over the attentions of the same high school student) there were no out and out from beginning to end bad episodes.  The bad stuff largely took place within a show that features some good things.  2) A few absolutely stunning individual episodes, especially ""Conversations with Dead People,"" the hysterical ""The Storyteller"" (centering on Andrew, who provided many of the funniest moments of Season Seven, and who is one of the odds on favorites to be in any BUFFY/ANGEL spin off), and the great episode where Spike deals with unresolved conflicts concerning his mother.  3) The struggles of both Willow and Spike in dealing with their respective inner demons, Willow with having killed in Season Six and Spike with his having a soul.  4) The return of Faith, which while BUFFY did not provide her with as many great moments as ANGEL did for three episodes preceding her return to Sunnydale, were great.  The tremendous chemistry (more as kindred spirits than sexual) between Spike and Faith, especially in a long conversation they have in Buffy's basement, one of the highpoints of the season, has many people hoping for the demise of TRU CALLING (Eliza Dushku's current and lightly regarded show) so that Faith and Spike can head a spin off.

Then there is the ending.  Many hate it.  Many love it.  Personally, I think it was a perfect end to the series.  BUFFY was always a fictional representation about the empowerment of women.  In the climax of the season-and indeed, the climax of the entire series-Buffy with Willow's help discovers a way to empower not merely the Chosen One, the lone Slayer, but all potential slayers, all over the world.  Best of all, the show managed to resolve Buffy's central dilemma that was established in Season One and continued through to the end:  How could she, whom fate had selected to be The Chosen One, ever manage to live the kind of life she dreamed of having?  By empowering all potentials, and in effect creating dozens and perhaps hundreds of Slayers, Buffy ceased to be The Chose One.  In the final seconds of the show, Faith says to Buffy ""Yeah, you're not the one and only chosen anymore. Just gotta live like a person. How's that feel?""  It seems to take a second before the question hits her, but when it does, you can almost feel Buffy's relief, and her face lights up with an extraordinarily happy smile.  You can feel her relief at having triumphed over her fate.

I can't imagine a more perfect ending to what I honestly feel is the finest television series in the history of television.",1093564800,367,7990,4.633262260127932
2138247,2,B0002XVKMC,"I cannot review the DVD, since it hasn't been released yet, but I can evaluate this season's story.  In short, this is the second-worst season of Buffy, after the not entirely funny first season.  After the spectacular sixth season, this season was planned from the start as the show's final one, but, oddly enough, felt incredibly ill-planned and nonsensical right up to the final moment.  The finale, in particular, seemed so rushed, as to not fully live up to the spirit of the show or give the characters their due.  The main characters, aside from Buffy and Spike, seemed to receive an undeserved lack of attention, especially Anya, Xander, and Giles.

The execution of the plot about the potential slayers -- about which I won't go into detail for those who haven't seen the season -- was very poorly done, especially with regard to dialogue.  Far too much significance was given and focus directed toward characters who were introduced this season -- even more than toward those regular characters who appear in the main credits.  This was a huge loss.  Chacters like Xander, Giles and Anya were what made me interested in the show, and their downright misuse and superficial involvement seems foolish and lacking in consideration for the fans, who invested so much emotional interest in them.

There are exceptions to this silly main plot.  The beginning of the season is quite strong with an episode focussed on Anya that is one of the best of the season.  ""Conversations with Dead People"" is strong, and ""Potential"" provides some interesting final moments between Dawn and Xander that make you forget how irritating Dawn can be, but only highlight how wonderful and underexplored Xander was this year.

Overall, if you are interested in the Angel series, which had a fantastic final year and excellent finale, this season is essential to understanding Spike, as so much of the story focusses on him.  I am even going to buy this DVD set.  However, understand that the show has lost much of what made it special:  the fun and brilliant interlacing of humor and drama that made overrated shows like ""Friends"" look, well, severely overrated.  Instead of forging into the show's swan song with a formula that worked, the writers mistakenly believed that the show's dull action scenes and foreboding were its strongest suits, and that, in X-Files-ian fashion, realism meant that our beloved characters wouldn't joke in serious times.  While this might be alright for a few episodes, it becomes intensely draining and even boring by midway through the season.  Suspense and heavily-serious drama were never Buffy's stronger aspects.  What made it more fun than so many paranormal or sci-fi shows was its willingness to make light of situations.  The writers had lost their ability or desire to do this, and the show suffered.  More importantly, unlike the fascinating drama between Buffy and Angel in Season 2, Faith and Buffy in Season 3, and essentially everyone in seasons 2 through 6, this -- the final season of Buffy -- simply lacked an interesting set of tensions and character arcs.  When Joss Whedon's plotting lost the essential wit and humor that made the show so amusing, and then left viewers with just plain cheesy and bad drama, how can he have thought his efforts would amount to more than 2.5 stars, especially when Season 5 was worth 5 stars.",1093564800,17,3364,4.916814159292035
2138248,4,B0002XVKMC,"I absolutely loved this season except that Xander and Anya were under used.  I would have preferred to see less of the Potentials and more of Xander and Anya.

Other than that, I loved the season.  The Potentials were annoying, but I loved the message that Buffy was no longer alone.

I loved the relationship of Buffy and Spike in Season 7.  They learned to trust each other completely and they were both there when the other needed them the most.  It was a very beautiful and adult relationship about 2 people learning to trust and depend on each other.  In the end, Buffy finally accepts and acknowledges her true feelings for Spike.

Willow's struggle with her fear of magic was handled very well.  Andrew provided much needed comic relief.  Robin Wood was a very welcome addition to the cast.  Faith's return was handled with a lot of conflict.  In the end, they all fought side-by-side.  The only part I really hated was the very ending when the Scoobies showed no grief over the deaths of their fellow warriors.  That scene made them look cold and heartless.  I hate that that was our last memory of them.

I bought this set when it first came out in the U.K.  The commentaries are excellent.  I especially loved Joss Whedon's ""Chosen"" commentary and the commentary for ""Conversations With Dead People"" with Danny Strong and Tom Lenk.",1093564800,7,1341,4.6581196581196584
2138249,5,B0002XVKMC,"I am a HUGE Buffy fan, and I could not have been more happy with this ending to the great show! The Acting was great and some great outstanding episodes such as ""Help"", ""Conversations With Dead People"" and ""CHOSEN""! These are all such great shows, During the season you see that everything starts to wrap up! Also (because I already have this dvd, it came out in England first so I know that) the secial features are great!!! some really interesting commentarys! They EVEN have a Gag Rell, seeing them go wrong is sooo funny, the feturettes are great so definetly buy it!!!  For any Buffy Fan or even not a fan.

2138250,1,B0002XVKMC,"I thought that Buffy, the Vampire Slayer was once the best show on television, it was eclipsed by it's spin-off Angel, but still maintated enough intelligence to put it apart from the rest of the crap that fills the networks these days.

Season Seven of Buffy was a departure from every season before, gone was the intelligence which once made it so great, gone was the once brilliant developement of character, gone was it's originality, gone was anything resembling what the show had once been before - it remains as pure popcorn crap.

It's entertaining, sure, but this show used to be so much more. It's disappointing that a show can fall so far from grace. Only Lessons, Help and Selfess are examples of what this show was able to achieve, and they are episodes 1, 4 and 5 respectively. It's downhill from there.

Showtime remains as the most dreadful piece of television that has ever been created. It is hypocritical, regressive, annoying and generally incoherent. The finale is not any better. It's a betrayal to what the series once used to stand for... and having heard Joss' commentary on the final episode, his unenthusiasm sums up exactly what is seen on the screen.",1093564800,20,1179,4.769607843137255
2138251,5,B0002XVKMC,"Buffy has always rewarded repeated viewing, and this is very much the case with Season 7.  Once you see the context and direction Joss was going, some of the apparently annoying plot developments fall into place (yep, including those irritating ""potentials"").  This season showcases one of the great ensembles of television history, comfortable in their craft and characters. As ever with Buffy the show is able to deliver humor and tragedy in a heartbeat, usually understated, often very clever.

The season repays fans with quite a lot of self-referential material.  As stated by others, it lifts from the darkness of season 6, which was also a strong season IMO, for other reasons.  SMG brings us back to a Buffy dealing fully with her role as a slayer, very strongly supported by Allyson, Eliza and a powerful role for future captain brownpants, Nathon Fillon. Andrew, whilst again irritating at first, becomes a comic highlight as the season goes on, his scenes with Spike and Anya are classic comedy, nicely balancing the darker developments elsewhere.

Yes, Spike features a lot, so perhaps the anti-Spike crowd (?) are going to have less to cheer about.  But even those incomprehensible types should appreciate what Joss is doing with the Buffy-Spike relationship.  It's no longer about lust, it was never about love, but it just might be about trust.

Hey, it's a great finish to a series so many of us wish had gone on even longer.  But I have to admit, if you have to end the best series on TV, then this is a pretty darn good way to do it.",1093478400,16,1551,4.753731343283582
2138252,5,B0002XVKMC,"The News came from an issue of Entertainment Weekly in March of 2003.  Sarah Michelle Gellar was on the cover like so many times before, but somthing was wronge, way wrong.  On the cover a quote from the article displade a messange that not only angred millions around the world, but changed their lives as well: ""Buffy, in this Concpetion is Over"" - Sarah Michelle Gellar.

I am unlike most fans.  That is because I not only like this season, but I love this season.

Must critize this year because is has the misfortune of three key factors... 1) it came after the very powerful and very dark sixth season which made it feel a little to light-hearted 2) Nothing could ever top the emotional impact of the fifth season finale, not even a ""series"" finale and 3) it was the third season, and you can tell that everything was winding down.

I have watched Buffy since the beginning (I even saw ""welcome to the hellmouth"" on the original airing)... and there are some times that I love the show (Seasons 2&3&7), there are times that the show is okay (Seasons 1&5), and times where I almost stoped watching (Seasons 4&6), but I always stuck with it, and Im glad I did.

The Seventh Season does start out a little light and fluffy with such episodes as ""Lessons"" & ""Him"" and if you don't count the teasers, all these episodes were almost standalones (except the Anya centric episode)... But then things changed with ""Conversations with Dead People"" where Buffy and Gang learn that not only do they have a new big-bad to face, but this big-bad is the father of all evil.  Now as d-day draws closer Buffy and Company try to figure out how to save the day... again.  They bring in old family: Giles, Old Friends: Faith & Angel, and a group of teenagers that one day will be the slayer.

I personally enjoyed this seaosn and can't wait for the DVD's, but at the same time, I don't want the DVD's because then the show will be officially over.",1093478400,7,1933,4.465909090909091
2138253,5,B0002XVKMC,"I have been a faithful fan of the series since the pilot and have anxiously awaited the availability of season seven on DVD.  Although this final season did veer a little off-course (Willow's unlikely relationship with Kennedy was ridiculous), it was still a terrific one.

The addition of Nathan Fillian to the cast was brilliant and his portrayal of Caleb was chilling. I love how James Marsters' Spike was front and center for the entire season, and how he had such a pivotal role in the finale.  Worth mentioning is the return of Faith, Giles and Angel.  It would have been disappointing to have the series end without Buffy and Angel meet one last time, and Joss was smart to to leave that door open.

If the series had to end, Joss could not have done a better job with the finale.  It gave some semblance of closure without having the picture-perfect ending that would have been a cheat  (i.e. Spike's ultimate sacrifice and the demise of Anya).  It also left the door open for a movie-of-the-week or, even better, a feature film.  The music score played during the final fight scenes is one of the best throughout the entire series. If I had to make a negative comment about the finale, it would be a wish for it to be two hours instead of just one.  I definitely recommend adding this season to your collection.",1093478400,7,1320,4.555084745762712

I am a huge fan of Spike and would rather him go souless and retain his character's great, quirkey and sexy personality.  Besides, Buffy never knew she had it so good with Spike.  Who needs Angel.  Season 7 was a huge disappointment with the actors walking through their parts.  Josh really let his loyal watcher's (no pun intended) down.",1093478400,10,512,4.633333333333334
