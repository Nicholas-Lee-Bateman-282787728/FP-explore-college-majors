3727003,4,B001O4DOQI,"The episode was cute, but I hoped there would be more on the dvd for the price. There are no other episodes or bonus features. I did not read the description and thought it was a full length movies. However, I got it for my mom for her birthday (she loves loves Goofy) and she loved. She remembered watching it as a kid.",1425081600,,320,4.095238095238095
3727004,5,B001O4DOQI,"My little girl loved it. It is just adorable. There is so much crap on tv these days and even with shows like Sponge Bob, the characters make fun of each and that is one reason I think kids bully so much. This is what kids should be watching.",1422144000,,242,3.9591836734693877
3727005,5,B001O4DOQI,Grew up watching this TV show. Fan of Disney Afternoon TV shows. For this review. 5 Stars for the show but 1 star for the price. At least they could have added Darkwing Duck Christmas episode or at least a $5-$6 price since it's only a 24 minute episode.,1421193600,2,254,4.204081632653061
3727006,5,B001O4DOQI,I saw this movie last night and it was vary funny. I wish they would have added darkwing duck along with this Dvd because they are together on the VHS verson.,1421193600,,158,4.129032258064516
3727007,5,B001O4DOQI,"Have Yourself a Goofy Little Christmas is a half-hour Christmas special spin off from the Disney Afternoon animated series Goof Troop. It was originally broadcast as part of a one-hour special in syndication, which also included two classic Disney animated shorts and a behind-the-scenes look at the animated feature film Aladdin.

 It aired on TV on December 5, 1992, The special was released on home video for the first time as part of the Happy Holidays with Darkwing Duck and Goofy VHS, in which it was paired with the Darkwing Duck Christmas episode, ""It's a Wonderful Leaf"". The episode was later released as a stand-alone DVD sold exclusively through the Disney Movie Club on October 21, 2008.

 Take home this all-time classic Disney fun for the holidays! Big-hearted Goofy pulls out all the stops for his son Max on Christmas. The problem is, he also shorts out the neighborhood electricity and almost blows up his house inn the process! When neighbor Pete gets tired of the Goof's shortcomings, he takes his family to Asperin Colorado, seeking a ""silent"" night of his own. Unfortunately, that leaves poor Max alone to make the most of his dad's hapless holiday mess-ups! This hilarious and heartwarming tale is a holiday favorite filled with love, family values and laughter for all ages, Goofy style!",1419638400,,1311,4.972602739726027

3727009,5,B001O4DOQI,Awesome!!!:) I remember seeing this as a child and when I taped it the sound didn't come out good.

Glad I was able to find this older Christmas cartoon",1385337600,4,117,4.318181818181818
3727012,4,B001O4DOQI,"I first saw this in the nineties, when it aired on television as A Goof Troop Christmas, paired with a collection of winter themed cartoons from the Disney vault. Goofy, well meaning but clueless, tries desperately to bond with son Max, as the boy, a typical teenager, seems ashamed of his dad's eccentricities. Themes of family love and loyalty, the true meaning of Christmas, and a lot of slapstick comedy come together to form a funny and sometimes touching holiday entertainment. A favorite with our family is the Reindeer Rhumba, performed by Goofy and a very reluctant Max. If you enjoyed A Goofy Movie, try this out. Highly recommended.",1360886400,10,643,4.908256880733945

3727039,5,B001O4DOQI,"As far as I know, Have Yourself A Goofy Little Christmas isn't in Goof Troop's volume 1 OR volume 2 sets, and I don't know if it'll ever be in the 3rd and last volume set, if Disney ever gets around to it. This was originally a Disney Movie Club exclusive in 2008, but became available at Walmart in 2014, and everywhere else in JANUARY of 2015. In fact, this new disc is a reissue of the 2008 release, in new eco-made packaging and an all-new cover. Goofy tries all he can to make Max's Christmas merry, even in spite of greatly-overdoing his decorations. And leave it to Goofy to make an unintentional mess of things on Pete and his family's Christmas vacation to Aspirin, Colorado; while attracting a not-so-happy bear from his hibernation. You can also leave it to Goofy to make an old Christmas tradition (The Reindeer Mamba) become new all over again, and a big hit as well. It's a wonder Disney didn't pair this special with Darkwing Duck's own Christmas special, It's A Wonderful Leaf, on 1 DVD, like they already did many years ago for 1 videotape, sans theme songs for both shows. Have Yourself A Goofy Little Christmas with this beloved classic from a widely-renowned classic Disneytoon series, and try and make it one of your Christmas traditions, if you want to!",1440028800,6,1275,4.5964912280701755
