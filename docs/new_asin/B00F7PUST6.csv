5969429,5,B00F7PUST6,Excellent compilation of the master detective Poirot. If you are a Poirot fan this set is a good addition to your dvd library. David Suchet is Poirot and this series will be greatly missed.,1412553600,,189,4.588235294117647

5969431,5,B00F7PUST6,Still need to watch the rest of films.  David Suchet would sure be a joy to have for dinner.,1410998400,,92,3.8421052631578947
5969432,5,B00F7PUST6,"Wonderful  that Acorn has released this nice roundup of faves handy on three discs. Of course Orient Express is the classic, but Poirot's Christmas is enjoyable any time of year, the Affair at Styles brings Hastings to the fore, and The Egyptian Tomb offers a different view of Poirot's sleuthing skills. David Suchet is brilliant, warm, droll and perfect--no one else could portray our Belgian detective as well. Treat yourself to a welcome return to some of his most memorable cases and most clever investigation!",1408320000,8,515,5.0588235294117645

8612894,5,B00F7PUST6,"I'll be sixty-nine years old, next year... Great priced, nice idea.
I bought this ''' FAN FAVORITES COLLECTION ''', along with
Agatha Christie's ""MRS MARPLE"".
One of these, two, series had something like 14 seasons.
Maybe one of these samplers will convince me to buy MORE.
Believe it or not, I've NOT seen either of these BBC programs.
At this price, I'll be able to see what I've been missing...",1499212800,2,397,4.685714285714286
