8127599,1,B000FWHVHI,"The  sound and picture quality of these films is very poor. The background noise is so loud and distracting, it is sometimes  hard to  hear the dialogue. Blood on the Sun is particulary bad. I would recommend that you seek out better versions of these films. I would not recommend you buy from this company, you might regret it. This is simply not a good product. Please take my advice, and look elsewhere for purchasing copies of these films.",1193443200,2,443,4.582278481012659
