8669073,4,B001O4GDAM,"This is a collection of interviews with youths in Las Angles and their parents with the topic being fund$, how they are acquired, handled, and thought about. Mostly sad to see how name brands determine a person's value. Can only wonder what happens to these children upon reaching adulthood and at some point not being able to flash a name brand and have a mechanic/doctor/boss shrug their should and say, ""So, can you actually DO anything. Some insight. Some of this material appears in the book 'Generation Wealth'.",1526428800,,517,4.886363636363637
8669074,5,B001O4GDAM,Another spectacular documentary.  Parents need to see this and consider whether or not they are enabling their children to become consumers instead of creators.  I think there was only one instance of these kids thinking about college.,1446076800,3,235,5.324324324324325
8669075,5,B001O4GDAM,"Really. Her documentaries are incredible.

I appreciated that this one in particular didn't have any academic commentary (or any commentary whatsoever) because it allows the viewer to form her own perspective, without being influenced by dr-whoever, from whatever-university.

Fabulous.",1387756800,2,286,6.3076923076923075
8669076,5,B001O4GDAM,This is one of the more disturbing documentaries I've ever seen.  But Greenfield is a genius.  She's highlighting an aspect of our society that not a lot of people are talking about:  children's attitude toward money here in the US.,1383004800,2,232,4.75
8669077,5,B001O4GDAM,The documentary was candid about what motivations drive young teenagers in the United States of America to begin in the activities of strong consumerism.  It examines what buying patterns start in youth and continue throughout adulthood.,1358294400,2,237,5.583333333333333
8669078,4,B001O4GDAM,"I watched Lauren Greenfield's Kids + Money on my laptop on an afternoon.  The mini-doc is only a half hour, and I wish it was double the size.  In a time of economic recession and financial uncertainty for many middle class Americans, this should be mandatory viewing for kids and their parents.

I've seen other documentaries portraying money and youth in America: Jamie Johnson's Born Rich is an excellent example of growing up as an East Coast elite, but Greenfield's doc differs by portraying average families trying to attain the American Dream through consumption.  The one thirteen year-old girl speaks and acts like an eighteen year-old woman and dresses accordingly.  It's amazing to see the responses of their parents who do nothing to deter the behavior of their kids.  Also watch the guilt in another girl's eyes when her friend explains not being able to afford going to a dance because her Mom doesn't have enough money.

I think the combined influence of indifferent parents mixed with a mass media machine that pumps out dreams, images, and a ""want"" for labels and brands is to blame.  It all brings to mind Bret Easton Ellis's ""too fast, too soon"" youth in Less Than Zero and the lyrics of The Decemberist's ""Los Angeles, I'm Yours."" Greenfield's Kids + Money is a quick glance at discontented American youth.  Recommended for those interested in what lies beneath the hollow glimmer and glitz of consumerism.",1337212800,3,1426,4.908333333333333
8669079,5,B001O4GDAM,Just stumbled upon this film after seeing Lauren Greenfield's other film- Thin- and thought this was phenomenal! great perspectives are offered and this movie should be seen by Americans of all ages to help realize some of the fundamental problems in modern society.,1323216000,3,266,5.209302325581396

This documentary examines American youths' relationship with money.
By MARY McNAMARA, Television Critic (November 28, 2008)

Social corruption is never quite as startling as when it's illustrated by children. In the one-hour documentary ""Kids + Money,"" photographer and filmmaker Lauren Greenfield, (""Thin"") interviews 13 Los Angeles children about their relationship with money, and as you would imagine, it is not particularly healthy. Here's 17-year old Emmanuel, who, with financial assistance, attends Harvard-Westlake and obsessively dreams of being part of the wealth he sees every day. Here's 12-year-old Annika, who badgers her mother constantly for a wardrobe that can pass muster in any of her school's cliques, and 17-year-old Sean Michael, who had to get a job when his folks refused to support his Nike habit.

""In L.A.,"" explains Phoebe, 16, in a bored voice, ""the money is on the surface level. When you meet someone, it's like, 'Hi. I'm this person. I'm rich,' or 'Hi, I'm this person. I wish I was rich.' ""

This ""whatever"" acceptance of life defined by possessions is balanced by a few more sensible voices -- Luis, 14, knows what it's like to go without food, and Zoie, 17, lives in such a tiny apartment that she shares a bedroom with her parents. But the point is clear: Many children are part of a status infrastructure so rooted in wealth it makes Edith Wharton's New York look like a socialist utopia.

It is easy to dismiss these kids, with their credit cards and spa birthday parties, as simply spoiled rotten. Tempting too -- especially when one young diva gives her mother, who is in the next room, the finger, or the almost finger, before looking at the camera with a hackle-raising mixture of guilt and defiance.

But to view ""Kids + Money"" as merely a disturbing portrait of modern youth, or, for that matter, Los Angeles, would be a mistake. Yes, most of these kids are horrifying, but they're only giving voice to learned behavior. And although Greenfield, disturbingly, chooses to include only mothers in the interviews, the larger questions raised are not so much about parenting as they are about our values as a nation.

Obviously, a shoe collection like Sean Michael's is excessive even by L.A. standards, but there is no denying that American children consume in amounts and ways that they did not even a generation ago. And why wouldn't they? They are marketed to by every company from the Gap to Nokia to Burke-Williams. Rich kids have always had their baby designer duds, but now it's the middle class that companies court, convincing 12-year-olds from Calabasas that they need to shop at Abercrombie, get their eyebrows waxed, have $200 sneakers and pedicures weekly.

As tempting as it is to feel smug while watching ""Kids + Money"" -- What is that mother thinking? What's wrong with kids today? -- these children are only spitting out the words we've put in their mouths. If Wall Street wizards can crash the economy by overspending, if thousands of adults can buy houses they couldn't afford, why shouldn't little Megan expect to get a paraffin dip every week? Why shouldn't Emmanuel think it is totally unfair that although he gets to go to posh Harvard-Westlake, he isn't as rich as his friends?

Money has become the sum of the American dream, and these kids are exactly what that looks like.",1268438400,2,3363,4.898066783831283
