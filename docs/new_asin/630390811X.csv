732979,4,630390811X,"Yeah, this movie ain't exactly great art, but who cares?  This flick is a lot of fun, with fast-pacing, action, comedy, and great special effects. The dialogue, while often trivial, is loaded with great zingers.  Seagal is  joined by a colorful cast, including Eric Begosian, and Playmate/actress  Sandra Taylor.
Granted, the script is somewhat lacking at times, but the  overall concept is clever, and it provides for great escapism.",957398400,2,434,5.231884057971015

732981,5,630390811X,"And this is a rare thing . . . a sequel that's just as superb as the original. Steven Segal is the cook again, and he boards the Grand Continental luxury express train with his niece. But trouble brews . . . a  group of terrorists led by a disgruntled ex-CIA operative hijack the train  to take control of a covert space satellite weapons platform, holding the  passengers hostage and blackmailing the Pentagon and others into paying a  huge ransom. And, of course, ex-Navy SEAL Casey Ryback(SEGAL) goes into  action to stop the terrorists from causing a nuclear attack on the Pentagon  with the space weapon. OK, the plot is mind candy, but this movie delivers  some stunning action scenes and speeds along with a great sense of urgency  as it thrills! The DVD enhances the enjoyment big style as the action comes  across as more explosive, the sound effects will rock your living room! The  cinematography is also nice to look at - great scenery and train footage  for any railroad buffs(like me) watching. Also, if one looks at the film's  climax, one could say it was inspired by a brilliant 1976 movie called THE  CASSANDRA CROSSING, which I would also strongly recommend. But as far as  UNDER SIEGE 2 goes, nobody beats Steven Segal in the kitchen!",945907200,28,1254,4.666666666666667

Yes, I'm as  mystified with the rest of you film connoisseurs as to why Segal has not  won multiple Oscars for his very fine performances in past movies. Hey, if  Titanic can win Best Picture, anything goes, right?

You get what you'd expect in this second time around for Casey Ryback and there's no real surprises just a good action flick that satisfies. There should have been more films in this franchise, it's a good formula for a recurring action hero and Ryback is a character you can easily like and the villains are as easily hateable.

733275,3,630390811X,"This 1995 Under Siege sequel remains one of Steven Seagal's better films but it's not without serious issues.  The most obvious is that Eric Bogosian might well be the lamest action movie villain of all time.  Bogosian is a monologist rather than an actor and his villain Travis Dane ends up coming across much closer to a standup-comic or Howard Stern than to Alan Rickman in Die Hard.  Steven Seagal also remains stubbornly unlikable for a big-screen movie lead which is one of the reasons his career crashed so hard and fast.  The other is that he was pretty much a prick to anyone who worked with him so Hollywood was practically in a state of euphoria when Steven Seagal had a couple of flops in a row and nobody was obligated to take crap from him anymore.

Want an example of how deeply Steven Seagal was hated?  When he costarred in 2001's Exit Wounds which was actually a hit the producers released a press statement downplaying Steven Seagal as the reason for the movie's box-office success--that's the kind of thing you don't see everyday.

The plot of Under Siege 2: Dark Territory is basically Die Hard on a train like Under Siege was Die Hard on a ship.  The specifics don't matter much but terrorists capture a passenger train and use it to take control of an experimental satellite weapon that can cause earthquakes from space.  The evil genius who created the weapon system (Eric Bogosian) and was fired for being too crazy even for the CIA--he faked his death and is the man behind everything.  He plans to destroy the Pentagon as payback and for some reason terrorists are stupid enough to pay him a billion dollars even though he would have actually blown the thing up for free anyway.  There is also one glaring plot hole--both of the people Travis needs to carry out his plan are on the train--unless you are willing to accept this as an amazing stroke of good luck one of those two should have been in league with the villain.

Katherine Heigl plays Steven Seagal's niece but still had a ways to go to develop into a solid actress.  Still, she's a lot better here than in My Father the Hero the year before and she's good enough for a Steven Seagal movie.  Australian director Geoff Murphy had an undistinguished career (Young Guns 2?  Freejack?) but he's actually pretty good at staging action and does a more capable than expected job behind the camera--but he was directing TV movies just a year later so apparently Hollywood wasn't impressed.

Steven Seagal movies are never at the top of my list when I'm in the mood to watch an action movie--Bruce Willis, Jean Claude Van Damme, Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger are all far more likable action stars from the same period and I also prefer 1970's action stars Clint Eastwood and Charles Bronson.  Still, Under Siege 2 holds up pretty well compared with Seagal's other movies.  The only one that's indisputably better is the original Under Siege but with Tommy Lee Jones as the villain and Andrew Davis (The Fugitive) directing that one is actually a lot better than this sequel--which may why there was never an Under Siege 3.",1435968000,,3116,4.6654478976234

In this follow-up to ""Under Siege,"" Steven Seagal again played a chef (yes, a chef) but this time he was on a vacation train trip with his pretty young niece. Well, wouldn't you know it? The train was taken over by about 20 really nasty guys who had gained control over an ultra-top-secret satellite and were managing it from the moving train. They were asking a billion dollars be placed in a secret account or they'd start blowing up localities that could trigger WWIII. I know, I know, the story line is totally unbelievable, but who watches these things for a good authentic, believable story? You watch for the action, the stunts, the gore and the killing and, yes, for the high speed, head-on train wreck at the end. It was an exciting and fun movie. The acting was quite good and the bad guys were despicable.

One thing the bad guys hadn't counted on was that ex-Navy Seal Seagal was on board. Well, Seagal became a one-man pain in the rear for the bad guys and almost single-handedly retook the train. The movie was filled with stunts of him getting around on, in and on top of a moving train and they were well done, not to mention exciting. A lot of people died in this train trip and in some rather creative ways.

I, personally, got a totally unexpected bonus which made this movie doubly fun to watch. In the summer of 1959, I worked for the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad and was stationed in Eagle and Gypsum, Colorado. We were working on electric lines associated with signals and our territory ranged from roughly Leadville to Dotsero, Colorado. We weren't on the trains, but worked with one-cylinder motor cars and traveled the same rails in the absence of trains.. Well, this is  where most of the movie was shot and the filming must have taken place in September as all the Aspens (at about 11,000 feet altitude) were in their changing colors. It was just great seeing this wonderful scenery all over again, but from a completely different perspective.

The ex-Navy SEAL with the singular expression, wispy voice and one-dimensional thinking is back: CASEY RYBACK. And he's ready to do it all over again. Never has so much hairspray (Schwarzkopf, Extra Firm Hold, natch) been put on standby.

Actually, I like this film. I like it because it's impossible to take seriously, despite STEVEN SEAGAL's best efforts to convince us that he's right up there with the gurning-means-gravitas Bruce Willis and Sylvester Stallone. No, this is strictly B-Movie territory, albeit with a decent budget and plenty of action. Even if you allow for the lame dialogue, Seagal still can't act his way out of a paper cup, BUT - and this is crucial to his popularity - He Can Move. (Looking at his post-millennium work, however, the sad fact is that the big guy loses even that plus to the unavoidable effects of age and an ever-expanding waistline. Not his fault, but it's where the untinentional laughs start to creep in and render every movie following EXIT WOUNDS pretty much a waste of time. The ORANGE cinema ad - the one where he's chasing the CEO asking for more comedy roles - is probably as close to the truth as it gets. Ouch.)

UNDER SEIGE 2: DARK TERRITORY is big, loud and full of dumb spectacle. A bullet-type train is hijacked by terrorists intent on using it as a platform to control military satellites capable of destroying any target on Earth. Thus it's Ryback's 'job' to take out the bad guys, one of whom is the brains behind the scheme, a vengeful computer nerd with an ego problem and a psychotic finger on the button (by-the-numbers in almost every other respect, ERIC BOGOSIAN'S Rod Serling/Twilight Zone impression is a very funny moment, however). It doesn't help matters that our hero's teenage niece is onboard the train as well; a contrivance that provides a few cute moments of exposition and peril, but they're almost completely overshadowed by all the violence and bloodshed - the one thing Seagal does best. Snapping necks, wrists and legs, he's a great choreographer and knows how to get the most from his well-practised moves. The climactic fight between him and the lead terrorist is pure and sustained brutality, back-breaking you might even say (but you'll have to import the US version to see it all, as the UK print has been heavily cut, so beware).

Good model effects of the train exploding and substantial set-pieces using real pyrotechnics create an unusually large sense of scale for an otherwise ridiculous but entertaining 100+ minutes.

And that's why I like this film. It can't ever disappoint on the grounds that it's best appreciated in one way only: by switching off the brain.

The blu ray audio quality is fantastic on this film: A for audio quality.
The blu ray picture quality is certainly an improvement over the 15-year old DVD version, but lacking in richness in color, but like I said, at 15 years old it is hard to quibble too much about it: B for picture quality.
The blu ray extras are really non-existent. Just some trailers of other blu ray Seagal films. Of course the original DVD didn't have any extras either, so I wasn't expecting much there, but still disappointed a little: D for blu ray extras.

If you are a fan of the film, it certainly is worth the $10 to add this one to your collection. You will definitely see a big improvement in sound quality over the original DVD, and a noticeable difference in picture quality & clarity.

733784,3,630390811X,"Reprising his role as ex-navy SEAL Casey Ryback, Steven Seagal stars in Under Siege 2: Dark Territory (1995).  While the original Under Siege took place on the battleship USS Missouri, the setting this time is on a train, the Grand Continental, where Ryback is travelling with his niece Sarah (Katherine Heigl), from Denver to Los Angeles.  Winding through the Colorado mountains, terrorists take over the train, led by Travis Drane (Eric Bogosian) a computer whiz, with a superiority complex, mixed with a streak of drama queen, who developed a top secret satellite weapon called Grazer One, for the US government.  After securing some passwords from a pair of officers aboard the train, Drane takes control of the satellite, and offers its destructive services for sale to the highest bidder, while planning the destruction of the Pentagon.

Ruthless Marcus Penn (Everett McGill) commands the mercenaries, who's numbers start to diminish as an undiscovered Ryback begins to strike.  When eventually discovered, Ryback winds up clinging to the side of a cliff.  It takes some daring moves, but the resourceful Ryback is soon back aboard the train.  In general, the stunts and action sequences are executed pretty well, though realism and logic are not critical factors.  A shootout in a passenger car instigated by Ryback, is pure madness.  A significant effort was put into special effects.  Although some of the effects are dated, most hold up pretty well, including the finale, a head on collision between two trains on a bridge.

Morris Chestnut plays a porter pressed into doing more than just handling luggage.  Chestnut and Seagal, would later team up in Half Past Dead (2002).  Katherine Heigl (Grey's Anatomy) does pretty well, in an early film appearance.  Eric Bogosian (Law and Order: Criminal Intent), does a serviceable job, as your typical irritating, egomaniacal villain.  More a convenience then a necessity, Nick Mancuso as Tom Breaker, and Andy Romano as Admiral Bates, reprise their roles from Under Siege.

While lacking the tension and 'realism' of the original, Under Siege 2 is still a very passable action adventure.  The cast is not as strong, and the story not as solid, but Casey Ryback is a fairly likeable character, that only occasionally comes across as a jerk.  Seagal displays the kind of physical prowess, largely absent from his more recent efforts.  It is somewhat surprising that he has not yet resurrected the character for another sequel, but who knows the future may bring.",1260230400,,2515,5.120098039215686

Other than the satellite gimmick, one can almost believe the rest of the plot.  The cast, for the most part, turn in a professional job.  Seagal almost smiles enough that you can be almost sure they don't have a mannequin doing the role.  Not a bad piece of mental candy, if the price is right.",1257984000,2,572,4.390476190476191

Anyway, Eric Bogosian (yea, that creepy dude who's now on ""Law Ander Order: Criminal Intent"") is the villain in this sequel. Hell, I would have preferred someone like Denzel Washington or an A-list actor as the baddie. But that probably would have upstaged Seagal, who's the focus of the movie. I give this sequel five stars because of Ms. Hiegl, the rest of the eye candy and the action sequences.

Where the movie falls down compared to the first film is the lack of a stand-out actor. Tommy Lee-Jones and Gary Busey may not be A list stars like Matt Damon and Tom Cruise but you can bank on them to deliver fine performances, which they did in the first film. This film doesn't have an equivalent.

I'm happy to accept this as a piece of comic strip fluff, but I do have a problem with films where believeability is stretched beyond the limit. Occassionally the film had some lighter moments, but I never got the impression that this film took itself anything other than entirely seriously.

733863,5,630390811X,"For several months we have been searching every video store in hopes of finding Under Siege 2: Dark Territory, only to come up short time and time again. We even checked every $5 bin with exhaustion. The only thing we could come across was Under Siege which we have already watched/reviewed/loved but never it's b counterpart #2. So this past Sunday after a nice day of NFL action half of Sid was poking around his local blockbuster when something magnificent happend. Looking through some videos for sale revealed a copy of Under Siege 2 for the glorious price of $3.99. Just looking at the cover gives you the feeling that you're in for some of the finest action b you will ever grace your eyes upon. You have Seagal who is hanging from a moving train with one hand, his piece in the other, and all the rear cars on fire from a sweet explosion. The only thing that could have made the cover better was if you had a zombie Busey (since he died in the first one) hanging on behind Seagal. But since we didn't have a horror-action here that wasn't in the cards.

Our story picks up with now retired Navy chef Casey Ryback working as a cook at the Mile High Cafe in Denver Colorado ($100 says Seagal begged the producers to call it the Mile High Club). Ryback has decided he wants to take his niece Sarah (Katherine Heigl) on a little vacation to LA which she doesn't seem happy about at all. Instead of being happy to spend some time with uncle Seagal she's pissed because he and her father hadn't talked in years. He gives her some song and dance and all of a sudden she loves him again. Within a 2 minute span she goes from hating him to hugging him saying how happy she is to see him. Typical woman. Now that all is well in the Ryback family they hop aboard the train to meet their uncle Tom porter Bobby Zachs (Morris Chestnut) who has the hots for Sarah. That however soon changed when he tries to make a move on her and she grabs his hand flipping him over in quite the hilarious scene. She says she learned her sweet ninja moves from her uncle as the movie takes b to new heights. From the non stop corny dialogue within the first 20 minutes the film was already up to 2 stars.

Once the train gets moving we see a couple shady characters that you knew would be the hijackers. Travis Dane and his crew stand up with their guns and alert everyone they are taking control of the train. Who hijackes a train? We're pretty sure the last time a train was hijacked or robbed was in the 1920's, but Dane must be a man of tradition. We soon find out that 2 of the passengers on the train hold the secret passwords to control a top-secret government weapon of mass destruction. He makes them cough up the codes by nearly burning their eyes out with some device, which Santa told us all about when he burst in half way through the film. Anyway, once he gets the codes he throws both of them off the moving train down the side of a mountain. Fantastic! Now Dane hacks into the government database taking conrtol of the weapon. He starts going nuts blowing up various building all over the world. In fact the scene of the destroyed industrial facility in China recycles unused footage from On Deadly Ground (1994). In On Deadly Ground, it's the burning Aegis Oil facility. Another star for reused footage.

As the choas continues they find out the universally feared Casey Ryback is on the train. They find his niece and take her hostage to lure Ryback into their clutches. Unfortunate for them Ryback is already on his way killing any of their crew in his path with help from the porter. Ryback is able to unattach part of the cart with a lot of the hostages so they won't have to witness Rybacks sureal ninja moves rendering them speechless. We have some crazy fights scenes in which Seagal hangs off the side of a mountain with 1 hand yet manages to kill 2 guys. Don't ask. And he winds up taking out every villian, saving the pentagon, and his niece. Good thing the government left the fate of the world in Seagals hands by saying ""Rybacks on that train? Leave it to him.""

Under Siege 2 was well worth the wait. We would give it more then 5 stars if we could. It has everything you will ever need in an action movie. Expect explosions, hilarious sped up martial arts, neck snapping, arm breakings, train jumping, borat looking villan, non stop one liners, rock scailing, knife fighting, and a ton of casualties by the hands of a semi slender pre ponytailed Seagal. If you haven't seen this one and you enjoy our reviews go and pick it up. Do it Now! You'll even get to hear Seagal say ""Nobody beats me in the kitchen!""",1222905600,11,4617,4.365116279069768

Sure the movie is a little cheesier in some areas, but the plot and action is to me better than its predecessor. The fight scenes in the first film are in the dark and majorly censored. The fight scene with Tommy Lee Jones and Steven Seagal wasn't that great, really short. In this sequel there is plenty of more action, and the violence is not censored at all. This movie also marks the first out of 3 times that Morris Chestnut worked with Steven Seagal.

The movie commences with a new satellite being launched into space. This satellite it seems is no ordinary satellite. Aside from viewing anyone, anywhere; it can be used as a potential nuclear weapon....Very original, right? This plot has been seen hundreds of times, particularly in 007 movies. Aside from its unoriginal ""satellite"" idea (that of course obviously falls into the wrong hands) it manages to be fresh and entertaining.

Anyhow back to the plot of the movie, Segal once again plays Casey Rayback, now retired and out of the Navy is planning to get some quality time with his niece(Katherine Heighl) of course as all action movies go its impossible for our hero to have a nice time. Instead he has a nice bone crushing time. A cuckoo computer hacker and a group of mercenaries overtake a train and passengers, along with Rayback and his niece. The hacker it seems is the designer of this satelite...And guess what? That's right he is taking the control of El Satelite. his plan, to threaten the U.S. of possible areas where he may attack, this way he can get ransom and everyone lives happily ever after. Seriously though the movie is a worthy sequel that even though it may not be original it surely knows how to entertain in its guilty pleasure sense. Worth owning all the way.

733867,3,630390811X,"There's no denying one thing: ""Under Siege 2"", directed by Geoff Murphy (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Young-Guns-II/dp/B0000399WE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Young Guns II</a>), is one of Seagal's biggest movies.

It's not, however, his best. Reportedly part of a trade-off offered by Warner Bros. so Seagal could direct&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/On-Deadly-Ground/dp/0790740826/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">On Deadly Ground</a>, it doesn't feel as fun as Steven's previous pictures and is, in my opinion, the first wrong step in a career riddled by them.

The storyline: now retired from the Navy, Ryback (Seagal) joins his niece (Katherine Heigl,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Grey-s-Anatomy/dp/B00005JO9J/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Grey's Anatomy</a>) on a train ride to Los Angeles to visit the grave of her father. However, when the same train is hijacked by mercenaries headed by a computer genius (Eric Bogosian,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Law-and-Order/dp/B00005JLFV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Law and Order</a>) who gains control of a military satellite with destructive capabilities and the passengers are taken hostage, Ryback must race against time to disarm the terrorists and stop an automated attack on the Pentagon.

Though the film still falls under the label of Seagal's ""good"" movies, I was disappointed by it as a whole: the edge is off the excitement experienced in the prequel, and when comparing it to his earlier titles, this one seems more superficial and reliant on special effects than physical talent. Seeing Seagal beginning to put on weight also isn't cool. The aikido master had never been much of a bodybuilder, but up until this point in time, he had been pretty trim; perhaps it's age, but by now, Seagal's face is pretty chubby and his build is a bit heavier. The villains also sort of disappoint: after seeing Tommy Lee Jones and Gary Busey in the original film, Bogosian and his giant cohort Everett McGill (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Quest-for-Fire/dp/B00003CXAF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Quest for Fire</a>) just don't seem fun, crazy, or even particularly competent enough.

Luckily, the film still includes plenty of Seagalian violence: lots of arm-breaking, wrist-snapping, and gunshots to the head, culminating in a scene where our hero slices a villain's fingers off with a sliding door. Stunts include Seagal hanging by a rope over a canyon and jumping between train cars - it's obviously a double doing that stuff, but scenes like that help show off the impressive scope and budget of the film. The supporting cast pulls its weight well, with the villains remaining deplorable-yet-intriguing and Katherine Heigl showing she was a capable actress even at age 17. A fairly young Morris Chestnut (later promoted to top villain status in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Half-Past-Dead/dp/B0000844MD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Half Past Dead</a>) plays the stereotypical black sidekick and kind of gets on your nerves after a while, but Andy Romano and Nick Mancuso reprise their government roles from the first flick to give it a greater feeling of continuity. These things weigh in for the film's favour, but all in all, the movie really doesn't live up to its predecessor. The train setting gives the film a much smaller scale than the prequel and the plot offers no innovation of scenarios, action, or Seagal's character.

In the end, fans seem to be nicely divided between which of the two ""Under Siege"" films they prefer, but as a legitimate enthusiast of Seagal's, this blockbuster represents a step down the ladder. Nonetheless, the film should be right at home in the collections of other fans.

733945,3,630390811X,"I've always put off watching Steven Seagal movies, due to the fact that they've never really appealed to me. But after a lot of persuasion (arm being twisted up behind your back, you know, the usual), and being told to wait outside until the menus etc had passed, the start credits of the movie was met with a big ""oh no!""

It doesn't really make that much sense to watch a sequel, when you haven't seen the original, so lets not go there.

The first thing I thought about this movie was that it had similarities to True Lies. In True Lies, it was Arnie-baby trying to rescue his daughter (Eliza Dushku) from the hands of an evil tyrant. In Under Seige 2, it's Steven Seagal trying to rescue his niece (Katharine Heigl). But apparently, it's just a coincidence that these two films are similar.

Eric Bogosian didn't really come across as your typical bad guy, which I thought was quite good. He looks like a wimp, one of those guys who sits staring at his computer, day in, day out. And the mop-top of curly hair just added to the whole effect.

Steven Seagal doesn't seem your typical action hero either. He doesn't seem to have the muscles that Arnie flexes constantly, nor does he have the drop dead gorgeous looks. (I'm not saying that Arnie's drop dead gorgeous, I'm just - oh never mind) Thankfully he's got that damn ponytail cut off, that really irritated me in some of his other movies. And he's so deadpan! Imagine someone Botoxed up to the eyeballs, and you'll have Steven Seagal. He shows no emotion either in any of his scenes, and manages to break guys necks left, right and centre quite convincingly. In that way, he's good as the good guy. He gets rid of the bad guys, each time in a different way - although he does break three guys necks. He does set a couple of people on fire.

What I also noticed is that at the end, like True Lies, when the girl originally hated her dad/uncle, she's now all over him like a rash.

It's a shame that Peter Greene - aptly named ""Mercenary #1"" - has to die in this movie (one of the three who gets their neck broken). He always seems to play the bad guy, and whereas he is quite nice looking, it must be his looks that make him bad guy material.

Overall, it was an OK film, if not a little long between action scenes. Thankfully, none of it follows on from the first, so it's not like you're watching a sequel that you have to have seen the first, to understand the second. But unlike some people, I won't be going all out, and buying the Steven Seagal doll (sorry, it's NOT an action figure). When a film get released, it can sometimes have ""action figures"" to accompany the movie. So why was there never one to accompany The Matrix? I want to play with Keanu :) Shame it's all plastic, au naturel is so much better.",1086048000,8,2772,4.33976833976834

733947,3,630390811X,"There are action movies (Schwartzenneger) and then there are Steven Seagal movies.  Seagal's movies are nothing fancy.  They aren't really there to make you think (although Seagal occasionally explores some right on themes like the problems facing Native Americans and the environment)in a way he's a modern day Billy Jack you might say.  But one thing you can always count on with a Steven Seagal movie is even when its bad its kind of good.  Generally he has great actors in his films and this one isn't an exception to that rule (i.e. Morris Chestnut, Eric Bogosian) and he always throws in some very likeable characters.  And then of course there is his martial arts skills which are pretty top notch considering.  This is the sequel to the very successful and superior Under Siege.  But this film ain't half bad.  I love the train setting.  And the shootouts are pretty tight.  The only really weak link to this film is the complete implausibility of the plotline.  Even for most action films this one is way out there in terms of something that could possibly happen in real life.  Watch the film if you're a die hard action film fan.  Don't watch it if you're looking for high action art like say Terminator, Robocop, True Lies or anything remotely like that.  As I said before there are Schwartzenneger films and there are Steven Seagal movies.",1070928000,,1352,4.722222222222222
733948,4,630390811X,"Go figure: Under Siege 2 was driven purely by contractual obligation.  It's also superior to Seagal's previous effort, On Deadly Ground, an abomination he also directed and produced.
Being the most successful Seagal film at the time (and subsequently, ever) Under Siege could not get away without a sequel.  The producers follow a tried and true method: they just make the same exact movie all over again.  Once again, Seagal dispatches a team of highly trained yet bumbling terrorists.  Instead of a battleship it's a massive train that gets taken over by terrorists with a master plan to kill a lot of people and make a lot of money.  In other words, Die Hard on a train.  Eric Bogossian plays yet another insane former CIA resource running amok, having stolen a top-secret satellite thingee that can fire laser beams from space and cause earthquakes.  Or something like that.
It's up to Seagal, as Casey Ryback (former Navy SEAL who, according to the niece/hostage whom with he's travelling, has 'medals so secret he can't show to them anybody') to bump off the terrorists one by one.  Dressed entirely in black in order to hide his expanding waistline, Seagal does it all: shoots, stabs, blows up, punches, kicks and maims a team of bad guys led by Everitt McGill, another arch bad guy who actually wants to fight Seagal because 'he scares me'.  Seagal himself gets shot, falls off a train, falls off a cliff, and outruns a speeding train.  He even gets in a plug for the first PDA, the Apple Newton, which saves the day while Seagal breaks necks and shoots ears off.
I enjoyed this one immensely.  Eric Bogossian is perfect as the loony toons leader of the pack, another guy who plans to blow up half of America for a lot of money (not wondering what his money would be worth after that).
Seagal utters about 100 words in this film, another direct correlation to the quality of the film.  The less Seagal says, the better.  The more bones he's breaking, baddies he's shooting, and bombs he's making out of the contents of a wet bar, the better.  No preaching, no Zen philosophy.  At one point he tells his sidekick, a scared porter hiding in the luggage car, ""I'm gonna get through my bag of tricks, and we are going to rescue those hostages.""  Then he stares into the distance, doing that crazy eyebrow thing in what is supposed to represent grim determination in the face of grave danger.
Whatever.  The movie is brisk at under 100 minutes, the direction is sharp and economical.  The bad guys are evil.  They die violently, including a female assasin who gets dropped out of a helicoptor and bounces off the side of a train with a loud, satisfying *thunk*.  Fingers get chopped off, necks are broken, people get thrown off moving trains, and Seagal makes a constipated face as he settles into a martial arts stance that suggests he's going to rip his pants.  Plot holes?  Sure, like who's driving the train after Seagal shoots everyone in the locomotive?  Seagal even takes a sniper bullet but ignores it, as if he only deals with serious wounds.  ('This ain't being shot.')  His black blazer is in great shape at the end despite the fact that he's been dangling off the side of cliffs, crawling on top of trains, getting shot, etc.
It's completely acceptable on a slow night.  Incidentally, Basil Pouledouris' score is not bad.
Also note that Morris Chestnut, playing Seagal's 'sidekick', would go on to play the villain in a later and much worse Seagal outing (Half Past Dead) which is a high or low, depending on your pov.",1062460800,3,3533,4.667205169628433

Ex-Navy Seal Casey Ryback (Steven Seagall)  -  as in the first Under Siege  -  happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time...in this case, aboard a train hijacked in mid-journey by terrorists.  His estranged niece (Katherine Heigl) is aboard, trying to manage a little quality time with Uncle Casey.  Unfortunately for them, military defense contractor Eric Bogosian  -  supposedly dead in a car accident, but actually alive and well and in full cahoots with the white supremacist terrorists  -  is using the train as a mobile platform to elude government detection, while computer-hacking into his own creation: an orbiting Star Wars particle-beam satellite.  Bogosian's aim is simple  -  global blackmail.  He and his renegade paramilitary pals want money  -  a lot of money  -  or cities around the world are going to start burning.  With his country (and the world) at stake  -  not to mention a trainload of hostages, including his own adorable niece  -  what's a good, ol' fashioned, red-blooded, patriotic American ex-Navy Seal to do?  Why, go to war, of course  -  regain control of the train, put Bogosian's satellite link out of commission, and kick a little terrorist tail.
Yes, Seagall is a terribly wooden actor, but that strangely seems to work in his favor.  The character of Casey Ryback is likeable precisely because he's wooden  -  somehow, it simply adds to his charm.  Katherine Heigl can't help but be adorable, and is appealing in everything she does.  Bogosian is as slimy, cold-blooded, and despicable a cad as ever slinked his way smarmily through a red-hot action-melodrama suspenser.  The rest of the cast are simply terrific, and the production and action sequences are stellar.  The suspense remains steady throughout, which is no small feat for a formula melodrama.  There simply isn't a dull moment.  This is a beautifully unified and realized production, from Frame One to Frame Last.  It's compulsively watchable, and re-watchable.
If the plot sounds vaguely familiar, you're remembering the 1971 James Bond entry Diamonds Are Forever, which ranks on about the same par as this movie.

But there was a time in the 90s when his name guaranteed you an hour and a half of broken bones, severed limbs, bad guys in agonizing pain and a showdown with a head villain who stands no chance against the awesome hurricane force that is Steven Seagal.

I never really like the first&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Under-Siege-Blu-ray/dp/B000JLPMPI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Under Siege [Blu-ray</a>]. I found it to be too low key and slow and after enjoying such brain-free fare as Marked for Death and Hard to Kill in my youth I had come to expect a tougher movie than the what we were given (though the tyrannical BBFC cut the film to shreds and denied me what I wanted to see). I was dismayed at the lousy 15-rating and not even Erika Eleniak's boobs could cheer me up (she's blonde-not my thing).

Flash forward to July 1995 and the awesome poster for Under Siege 2 started showing up in cinema lobbies. It featured the impassive one clinging to the side of a burning train hurtling through the countryside and featured, quite frankly, the best subtitle of any sequel ever 'Dark Territory'. This time it was rated 18 which meant I could look forward to all the blood and gore that the first Under Siege lacked. Obviously I couldn't see this film in the cinema, being only 15 and all, so I had to wait until the video came out in early 1996. By that point the BBFC (those people from the dark-ages again) had censored every last bit of red stuff to the point where it could be shown on the friggin' Disney Channel if it weren't for the swearing.

I would have to wait until 1999, when I bought the uncut US version on DVD, to see the film in it's entirety. And when I did it was like watching a brand new movie.

Casey Ryback, now the head chef of the Mile High Cafe in Denver, had retired from the Navy but still works for the government doing the odd secret mission here and there. When his brother is killed in a plane crash he takes his niece Sarah (the lurvley Katherine Hiegl) on a trip to LA on the Grand Continental, but that particular train just so happens to be hijacked by crazed computer genius Travis Dane and his band of menacing mercenaries featuring dead-eyed Everett McGill and the sleazy Peter Greene. He has a beef with the government and is only too happy to use his skills to blow the Pentagon off the face of the Earth and collect a nice paycheck from the Saudis.

Luckily for Ryback, he was momentarily absent when the hostages were rounded up as he nipped into the kitchen to bake a cake. He teams up with naive porter Bobby Zachs (Morris Chestnut, bringing life to an otherwise ordinary sidekick role) and begins his skulking, lurking mission through the shadows and voids of the train to pull the brake and free the hostages. Do these nasty people really think that they stand a chance against Ryback's awesome power and apparent invincibility? Sit back and watch them get annihilated with a variety of improvised mle weapons and other gruesome tools.

The train is a better setting than the boat. This time instead of a plain black backdrop we've got lots of pretty scenery and the constant forward motion of the loco gives the movie a nice momentum. Basil Poledouris' score soars miles above Gary Chang's bland notes of the first one and it honestly ends up being one of the best scores ever and a perfect example of how action music ought to be. And don't worry about this one being slow as the first. Under Siege 2 is edited so quickly that coherence is almost lost. You have to pay quick attention and perhaps watch the film a few times just to catch everything.

The comic-book nature of the plot, the cliffhanger feel of the ever-escalating mayhem and cartoonish villains might normally result in a campy movie but Under Siege 2 is as hardcore and sadistic and mean-spirited as the come. That's probably the reason the BBFC chose to cut it, claiming that it featured 'gloating and pervasive violence'. Well, I never found it to be that evil, just entertaining. Which is why I don't like narrow-minded institutions telling me what I can and cannot watch.

No one could possibly have a bad time watching this film (unless it's the UK version) and if you've had enough of Shane Meadows doing pretentious black and white stuff or Keira Knightely in a frock to last you a lifetime then the brainless and breathtaking action of Under Siege 2 is just what you need.

734064,4,630390811X,"After watching the first, I figured the second cant be a total letdown. And it wasnt, actually. I love Seagal..Maybe it's just the terrible acting, I don't know, I just love the guy, and he does a worthwhile job portraying the Casey character. Heigl was pretty bad, however. I'm happy they didn't make her a huge part of the movie, and ""Penn"" did a pretty poor job of living up to Tommy Lee as the insane bad guy. The Dane character was pretty good, however. And the action is constant, and actually impressive throughout the movie. The only dissapointment would be the very end, which was indeed a bit of a let down. But the movie's worth it just because it does keep you attached, and it had some nice visuals, not to mention some pretty bad ones. It's still worth it, and the DVD wasn't that bad either, set at a good price and the transfer was done fairly well. It doesnt let down on the extras, either, so what's to loose?",970704000,2,927,4.364161849710983
734065,2,630390811X,this movie is just bad. all sequels are dumber the the first for example look at scream it went down hill from there. its the same this with this movie the first one was decent and this one as just bad. of course thats my opinion i may be wrong,969408000,,244,3.9
7855905,3,630390811X,This is a pretty good action movie.  I think it is better then the original Under Seige.  It's on a train this time.  There is plenty of action.  And good villains.  And you get a pretty good idea about the way things are going to end.  But it still is suspensful.  This and Hard To Kill I think are the best two movies Steven Seagal ever did.,1526083200,,343,4.029850746268656

Four and a half PERILOUS Stars. Under Siege 2: Dark Territory is a fun 1995 action, adventure film, made 3 years after the highly successful original Under Siege. In this plot the writers up the ante, as ex-Navy Seal and cook Casey Ryback is back, this time taking a train and he runs into even more wide ranging, unexpected danger, with much deception afoot. As before in the first movie, once the action starts, it is pretty much non-stop with lots of explosions and gore, as the bad guys encounter an unforeseen force in Ryback, portrayed by action star and aikido martial artist Steven Seagal who was in his prime and in the midst of releasing a number of similar action films. Eric Bogosian and a young, brunette Katherine Heigl are outstanding as are Everett McGill, Morris Chestnut, Brenda Bakke, and Peter Greene, with Andy Romano and Nick Mancuso reprising their roles, plus Jonathan Banks, Royce D. Applegate, and Kurtwood Smith. An Arnon Milchan, Seagal, and Steve Perry production. Directed by Geoff Murphy. Highly Recommended. Four and a half COVERT Stars. (Warner Bros. Pictures. Regency Enterprises. Rated-R. Color. HD. CC. X-Ray is not functional. Time-1:39:41. The two films made $156 Million and $104 Million, respectively.)",1506556800,,1268,5.07177033492823
7855912,5,630390811X,"Enjoyed this.  Watched on a Saturday night.  Had seen it before but it was worth the new view.  Segal is smooth, fast, and deadly in martial arts.  Full of suspense, tension, and heart pounding moments.  If you need a rush, this one delivers.",1506470400,,242,4.534883720930233
7855913,3,630390811X,"Under Siege 2 is the quintessential prototype of the 1980s/1990s action film.  It's not great.  Steven Seagal manages to avoid almost every bullet that's shot at him.  The villain is laughably stupid yet he's suppose to be some super genius.  The entire premise of the film rips off Die Hard. With all of these flaws, I still found myself entertained.

There are 2 types of bad movies: type one is when you question the logic and the reality of every scene.  If you do this too often and too early in the movie, chances are you hate the movie.  The second type is when something so ridiculous happens, something unfathomably stupid happens that you acknowledge it but continue to watch and enjoy it til the end.  This is what happened at the end when the train collision happened and Seagal was able to run to the back of the train and escape without being knocked off his feet.  A head-on collision with 2 trains and this man was still able to run at a slow pace before escaping with his life.  IT WAS LUDICRIOUS!!! But everything leading up to the finale was good enough to make me overlook this brief moment of stupidity.  I guess that means I actually liked the film.

I think the Under Siege films are the only Steven Seagal films I've enjoyed.  He had a brief run of success in the late 80s early 90s and Under Siege 2 was probably his last big studio release.  It's a good movie to watch on a Saturday afternoon.",1504310400,,1419,4.407692307692308
