340885,3,6301646096,"CAGED FURY is a cheeeze-o-tronic fiesta about a woman named Kat, who leaves home to seek her fortune as an actress in Hollywood. After picking up a woman named Rhonda on the road, the two hook up w/ a photographer named Buck. The next thing Kat knows, she's being attacked by a horny biker gang behind a sleazy saloon. Enter Erik Estrada as her savior extraordinaire. Meanwhile, the world's most POISON-esque rock band plays on! Erik puts on a kung fu master class for the bikers, and whisks Kat away on his motorcycle. Simultaneously, Rhonda finds love in the saloon's bathroom w/ Buck. Oh, but can this dream-like state last forever? In a word, Nuh-oh! Buck introduces Kat to a pig of a movie director named Vinnie. Mayhem ensues, and the next thing Kat knows, she's under arrest! After a 30 second trial, Kat is off to the big house! Now, stripped of her street clothes and her dignity, Kat must learn to survive in the slammer! Of course, the inmates all wear skimpy uniforms -when they're wearing anything- and the guards are all graduates of the Marquis de Sade School of Intense Charm (Dear god! one of them is Ron Jeremy)! Kat's situation worsens after she meets the warden, a demonic dominatrix w/ an eye for the ladies! Can Kat's sister, Erik Estrada, and a Carlos Santana look-alike locate Kat before it's too late? Yep, this is why cinema was invented...",1388448000,2,1366,4.648760330578512
340886,2,6301646096,I was a little disappointed with this movie and only watched a couple of minutes of it. Lots of soft porn that was a distraction for me. Some might enjoy it.,1386547200,,157,4.096774193548387
340887,3,6301646096,"it was okay for a women in prison flick. The plot was corny, but okay. The acting was substandard. The nudity was okay. The warden had an extremely weak personality as did the guards.",1380067200,,183,4.411764705882353
340888,3,6301646096,"Softcore exploitation with nary a shred of realism, Caged Fury (1989) is entertaining in a lurid way, as innocent young women, wind up in prison as victims of a white slavery ring.

Kathie Collins (Roxanna Michaels) leaves her dad (Michael Parks) and her sister Tracy (Elena Sahagun) home on the farm in Utah, and strikes out for Los Angeles to become an actress.  After picking up a girl named Rhonda (April Dawn Dollarhide), the pair reach LA and crash at the pad of a Buck (Blake Bahner) a sleazy photographer that Rhonda knows.

Old Buck is a shill for a white slavery ring, and directs the girls to an audition, where they are setup for a phony arrest and trial.  Unbelievably, the women are convicted, and are sentenced to a prison that is a front for the operation.  The prisoners are terrorized and abused by warden Sybil Thorn (Ty Randolph) a sadistic lesbian, the head guard (Paul Smith), and others on the staff.

Kathie's new friends Victor (Erik Estrada) and Dirk (Richie Barathy) are concerned by her disappearance, and begin to investigate.  Worried, Tracy comes to LA to search for her sister, and soon joins Kathie in the same phony prison.  Dirk, an expert in martial arts, enters the facility to rescue the women.  Violence soon follows, as the desperate prison staff attempt to exterminate the prisoners.

Erik Estrada (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/CHiPs/dp/B00005JO3Z/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">CHiPs</a>) is suave as Kathie's love interest, but he's not involved in her rescue.  Instead it is Richie Barathy who steps up somewhat clumsily into the spotlight, displaying his martial arts skills in some pretty cheesy fight scenes with the guards.  The cast features some other familiar names, including James Hong, Jack Carter, and porn star Ron Jeremy.

With a completely ridiculous story, airheaded characters, sadistic abuse, nudity, and some pretty awful acting by many, Caged Fury fits well in the women in prison genre.  The violence is mostly implied, until things turn into a massacre at the finish.  Fans of the genre, should find this kind of storytelling familiar, and may enjoy this 2.5 star effort.",1351382400,8,2173,5.186246418338109
340889,3,6301646096,"This review is for the Amazon VOD rental of this film.  This is a not
too bad women in prison movie. Comes with all the nudity and bloody
mayhem you would expect in a low budget straight to video flick. A
young girl travels to Hollywood to find stardom and instead finds herself
a prisoner in a fake prison for women and about to be sold as a sex slave.
Erik Estrada is listed as the star of this film but it is the hot girls
who rule this feature. Michael Parks is featured as the girl's father and
he is much too good of an actor for a film such as this.",1287705600,5,556,3.920353982300885
340890,5,6301646096,"After a very long 3 month layover the Bothers Sid reunited in glorious fashion as we always do. The day started off with a nice game of 13 holes (there's a lot of holes in the dessert), followed by some nice munchies with a heavy dose of M Collins, a quickly polished off 6 pack, and one of the absolute finest B action masterpieces eve witnessed by the ultimate enthusiasts. Even after Blockbuster jerked us around when they decided to blacklist us from Forrest Warrior we managed to uncover a heavy dose Estrada. When On-Demand offered us some washed up Mexicano justice we simply couldn't refuse, especially with the perfect day upon us. This is honestly a film that was put on the earth just for us to watch and place in the classic bin of Sid favorites.

We got our fist star within the fist minute thanks to some gratuities female jailbird nudity. It was an instant flashback to our lives back in 94 inspiring us to give our undivided attention all the way though. So after a fantastic opening scene we are immediately introduced to a red turtle neck sporting Estrada and his partner, the ultimate machismo with a DMF of 764, Dirk Rourke. As they take down an entire bike gang of 15 we come to realize the man called Dirk is nothing short of action hero perfection. As he tears the opposition limb from limb with roundhouse kicks and throat chops, you will find yourself spellbound by this performance. Seeing his uber mullet glisten in the light as he kicks through prison walls is something everyone should get to witness at least once in their lives. The action is something that will remain in Sid discussion for many years to come in the upper echelon with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Death-Ring/dp/B00069QD74/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Death Ring</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ninja-Vengeance-VHS/dp/6302765137/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ninja Vengeance [VHS</a>].

The story is so all over the place that your mind, baked or unbaked, will fight so hard to make sense of whats being viewed with no success. It's almost as if common sense and logic were drop kicked into extinction by the size 13 honchos worn by Dirk ""you're so money and you don't even know it, but you do"" Rourke. What we could sum up in our state of glorious disillusionment is Caged Fury is about a sex prison with all female inmates in lingerie. It appears Dirk is on a mission to shut the place down one fractured ribcage at a time while Estrada cruises the streets on his knock off Harley. Besides that we can't explain what the F was going on but assure you plenty of laughs and one of the finest B's we've witnessed to date. So good in fact it gets closed out with the drive in totals:

Talk about conspiracy theories.  This takes the theme of ""Macon Country Jail"" to the BiG City level.  Arrested, tried, sentenced, and shipped off to prison.  There they are ""'GRAPHICALLY'"" Strip-searched, mistreated, and coerced into prostitution for the profit of the elaborate C0N.
If a woman happens to figure out it's a con, they disappear - - painfully and permanently as we are shown.
So, here you have another ""women in prison"" movie with some new twists and plenty of the tried and true elements like nudity, humiliation, and catfights.
If that is your brand of entertainment, then this flick delivers.

340892,4,6301646096,"This adaptation of an original Ed Wood script not only titillates but challenges your senses as well.  Two of them at least. I was a bit sceptical about Senor Estrada's acting abilities but he proved to be pretty good despite his almost distracting latino good looks. Sadly, many opportunities were missed in the making of this movie. To whit, the character, Woman escapee in thong, was never fully developed and her bosom heaving was labored at best. Further, it would have been nice if the didn't make Estrada wear his old CHiP's uniform- he just wasn't in the same shape he was in when he was called one of the sexiest men alive. Also, they never did get the stain out from the chilidog he slow-mo dropped on his shirt during the closing credits for the ""Median Shrubbery Robber"" episode. I can't complain though. This movie rocked!  END",896400000,6,840,4.668918918918919
