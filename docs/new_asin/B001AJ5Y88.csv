3454102,4,B001AJ5Y88,"This DVD was very informative and Mark breaks down what he is actually doing so you can understand why things in music are the way they are! Many instructors just show you and you perform them without a clue as to why things in music are structured the way they are. I was turned onto this author by a freak accident, I was in the local guitar store looking for a guitar DVD when his lick by lick Metallica jumped out at me. So I bought it, yeah I was amazed how he broke all the material down and it was easy to understand and learn. I still have the DVD and will not part with it.",1360368000,,582,3.982905982905983
3454103,5,B001AJ5Y88,"Bought this for a 9 year old, and when he uses it, you can hear the improvements he is making.",1357603200,,94,3.75
3454104,5,B001AJ5Y88,"I got this DVD figuring it was going to be a bit complicated (you know, theory and all), but it wasn't.  It really helped to clarify things in a simple and straight forward way.  Being self taught with guitar; over the years I've gotten somewhat hesitant on the whole theory bit.  However, this DVD was of some good value to me.  I actually learned a thing or two.  So if your self taught like me, grab this learning aid.  It's easy to understand without getting too complicated, if you know what I mean.  The price is right and the learning is not just for guitar theory gurus!  Hey, even the simple at heart can comprehend this, and yes, even benefit from it too.  I did!",1348617600,,673,4.32
3454105,5,B001AJ5Y88,Outstanding dvd and order was very quickly processed by Amazon.  The dvd is really ideal for me.  I'm basically a hobbyist but always seek to learn more about the guitar and how to play.  This dvd and the lessons therein provide me a great opportunity to expand my knowledge and skill.,1219622400,,285,4.549019607843137
8277779,4,B001AJ5Y88,"Overall, I like the presentation. Since I'm an advanced player, it represents a nice review for me, especially since it goes over every major key and major scale. Of course, you can also see the minor keys and scales, as well, within the majors. The reason I don't give it 5 stars is because I believe its too fast paced for the beginner, and since the the title of the DVD is ""Easy Guitar Chords"", it might be construed as something a very new beginner can handle without any problems. This may not be the case AND I think that is noted in the DVD, as well. Again, OVERALL, I like it and believe it can be very helpful.",1508371200,,620,4.218487394957983

8277782,2,B001AJ5Y88,I found the pacing of this DVD to be very poor for learning.  Chords and notes are rapidly put together with no pauses for the viewer to actually play or even mentally retain any of the material.  I'm a veteran player who just likes to revisit the basics every now and then which will often break up a writing rut.  I don't see how a beginner could benefit from this instruction at all.  A progression is named and then played and before you can even blink another is being played.  Pacing is key to learning and this fails.,1420848000,,524,4.3061224489795915

8277786,2,B001AJ5Y88,"Guitar chord instruction seems accurate and complete, but there are no chord exercises on the DVD.",1407456000,,98,5.1875
8277787,2,B001AJ5Y88,This video is touted as a good training aide but I found otherwise. Not too clear on instruction and video is of poor quality copy. Would rather have my money back to spend on something worthwhile. I have been playing other instruments for over thirty years and can learn on my own better than this video.,1399766400,,305,4.464285714285714
8277788,4,B001AJ5Y88,"I have purchased so many ""HOW TO"" dvd's and the like with the hope of somebody really explaining the basics and how it all fits together and I thought this is cheap and worth a try ..to my surprise it was really educational and the instructor walked me through the basics to a good understanding. ..I was so pleased with the material that I purchased his other 2 DVD's on Theory, and Scales which were even better. I always use them as ref material now for refresher courses. Thanks John",1383782400,,487,4.4222222222222225
