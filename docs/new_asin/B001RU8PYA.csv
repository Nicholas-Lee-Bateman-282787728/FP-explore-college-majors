8338881,5,B001RU8PYA,This DVD features Johnny Tapia the former Five time world cahmpion. He passed away on may 27 of this year at the young age of 45. I guess he had demons he couldn't battle any longer but in the ring he would battle a wild cat. I remember his fight with Danny Romero as a classic. In this dvd he takes on Paulie Ayala the tough and tricky southpaw. It is an action packed fight with alot of emotion typical of any Tapia fight. Felix Trinidad fights former Kronk gym star Oba Carr in a great fight that shows talent from both men from the hottest division in the 90s the welterweights. to round off this dvd is the great Julio Cesar Chavez taking on Rocky Lockridge in a fight that shows why Chavez was on top of the boxing world for almost 2 decades. In this fight he showed footwork and counterpunching that you rarely saw in any other fights. Most of his fights he came at you untill you're will and determination would crumble. In this one he picked Rocky apart for 12 rounds showing great boxing ability. A great find for fight fans!,1341964800,,1035,4.285714285714286
