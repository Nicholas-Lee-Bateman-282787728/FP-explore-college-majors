8400298,4,B003M9ZABK,"I bought this book for my Kindle because it's a selection for my book club.  There is no way I would have chosen to read it, but it's turning out to be very interesting and a fairly easy read especially considering the subject.  There is a lot more gossip than I expected.  Seems like most of the diplomats were all sleeping around.  I would recommend this if you have any interest in Churchill, Roosevelt or the workings behind the scenes to get American to aid Britain.  The ""Citizens of London"" are 3 Americans, Avrill Harriman, Edward R. Morrow and Ambassador Gilbert Winet.  All very interesting characters.",1363046400,,612,4.726415094339623
