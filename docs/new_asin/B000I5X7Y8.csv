8144058,5,B000I5X7Y8,"The beginning part is quite slow but afterwards I couldn't stop watching. It's a really beautiful, deep and touching story. I can totally feel the fear, love and all kinds of emotions of the characters. The story of how Virginia lost her son is heartbreaking. The chemistry between the lead actresses are very touching and realistic. This is one of the best movies I've watched ever. I was watching it free via my Amazon Prime unlimited account but after I've finished it I decided I would buy it just because I like it so much and because this type of movies is rarely written so well like this, despite the low budget. This movie shows us how people can be so brave and unselfish when their loved ones are in danger. This movie is about pure love; if you're looking for raw sex scenes or violence, this movie is not for you, otherwise, I highly recommend this movie.",1385596800,,868,4.5
8144059,1,B000I5X7Y8,This movie has a good concept but I think I could have made a better movie t home myself. This movie is not worth renting much less buying. I was very disappointed!,1325808000,,164,4.15625
8144060,1,B000I5X7Y8,"I bought this DVD because it was shot in Selma, Alabama. But this movie looked like a bad drama on one of the lesser networks to me or possibly a home movie of some amatuer. I understand the budget was low, but it would had been better to save the interesting story for a good make someday. I suffered through watching this and it seems all the scenes took place in one field and one house. It could have been much better with more camera shots, multiple viewpoints, Changing scenery, camera zooms, etc.",1313539200,,503,4.419354838709677
8144061,3,B000I5X7Y8,This movie offers an interesting story and engaging actors but it let down by the lack of film making techniques.  I guess the producers didn't have enough resources  to realise their visual. A shame because this could have been a great movie.  I was disappointed and I wouldn't recommend it for the price.,1301961600,,306,4.735849056603773
