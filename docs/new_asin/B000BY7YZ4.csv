2445418,5,B000BY7YZ4,"Having most of my money in 401k's and in my company stocks I have accumulated over the years, I have found much value in options to protect myself.  Until I saw this I knew the meanings of options but did not understand the concepts of time decay and the types of spreads available for simple investors like me. This has opened up a whole new chapter in my style of investing and I can now sleep better knowing I have hedges protecting my major assets.  Thank you Mr. Frey!!",1138320000,7,474,4.314606741573034

8093890,5,B000BY7YZ4,"This is a good beginning to stock option trading.  It turns on the light since it is clearly organized and presented.  It explains what is a put and a call and the strategy for why you would buy or sell each....in other words is your strategy for the particular underlying stock a bearish or bullish strategy.  It does a decent job of explaining the time sensitivity of an option and the leverage feature vs. stock. The next step in the process would be to gain an explaination of the more advanced strategies such as chokes, straddles, diagonal spreads, etc.",1262822400,4,559,4.626262626262626
8093891,4,B000BY7YZ4,"If I had spent the $65 listed on the cover for this I would've been highly POed.  It seems like they just videoed one of those seminars put on around the country by the Options Industry Council.  That said, this video is a BARGAIN at $13.

Contrary to the title, I would not recommend this as a person's first introduction to options. He glosses over the intro stuff more like a refresher.  I do a little retail option buying now and then so I know the basics and I ended up taking several pages of notes while watching this.  It is a good intro to the Greeks.

I found his coverage of bull call spreads very interesting.  I knew about them but didn't know that time decay can be a benefit with them.  I also got a solid understanding of Gamma and was surprised to hear that, unlike Delta, it decreases as an option gets further in the money.

The way I see it, you invest a chunk of change trading options and if you learn one thing from this video it'll probably save you many times the $13.",1251590400,,993,4.211640211640212
8093892,1,B000BY7YZ4,"The title of this DVD completely misrepresents the contents.  First, it is titled as a ""complete course"".  It is not comprehensive, it is an overview of options trading strategies with a section on volatility.  Second it is titled as ""fundamentals"".  It is not fundamentals.  It is an overview of options trading strategies using advanced terms that you are assumed to already know.  If you don't understand the technical terms of trading options, you will be lost when you view this DVD.  This DVD is simply the author setting up a video camera at one of his seminars and taping it.  There is supposed to be a manual that goes with this, but to get it you have to download it from the author's website after providing all your contact information.  The real videos are sold for $99 on his website.  The $15 version is just a taste.  If you want to buy a brochure, or a sample, then this DVD is for you.",1231977600,7,903,4.478527607361963
8093893,3,B000BY7YZ4,"The title is a little misleading.  It offers a nice general overview of option trading strategies, but don't think that you can watch this DVD and start making money.

A better title would have been , ""Highlights of Options Fundamentals"".  Buy the DVD along with other books and hunker down and learn for a few months before you start investing with real money.",1224892800,2,361,4.698412698412699

8093895,1,B000BY7YZ4,I have been frustrated with the books I have been looking at that I have purchased on Amazon but this video and some others have shed new light on the subject and now I am making wiser trades with a higher chance of success than before watching this. Material was relevant for my needs and it taught me some for an hour and a half presantation.,1141257600,6,344,4.2272727272727275
