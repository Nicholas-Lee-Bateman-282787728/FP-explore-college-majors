508471,5,6302768837,I ordered this because I have been reading G.K. Chesterton's Father Brown Stories. I received the video in good condition and very quickly. I recommend this seller.,1309392000,,164,5.111111111111111
508472,5,6302768837,"I really wanted this film, being a huge fan of British films of the 1950s (Eiling Studios and such) and also of the Father Brown stories (both in book form and the Kenneth More TV miniseries).  The Detective is not available on DVD - a big disappointment - but I did get a used VHS that was in really good condition.

The film itself stars Alec Guinness (as Father Brown) and Peter Finch (as Flambeau) and is a prequel to the stories.  It shows how Brown and Flambeau met and eventually became unlikely sidekicks in solving murders and crimes (though I have to admit Flambeau never did much of the solving, and like Dr. Watson was mostly useless except as a sounding board).  Joan Greenwood is another welcome member of the cast as is Cecil Parker.  Locations, particularly the Paris Catacombs, were scenic and sometimes thrilling.  The story is very much a typical Father Brown case.

Anyone want to sign a petition to have this released on DVD (though the VHS is NOT copy protected)?",1293148800,3,985,4.594285714285714
508473,5,6302768837,"I first watched THE DETECTIVE a few years ago after having thoroughly enjoyed G. K. Chesterton's stories about the English detective-priest Father Brown.  At first I was put off by it because, although some of the characters were Chesterton's and the plot line was loosely based on one of the short stories, the movie wasn't close enough to the originals to suit me.

However, separated from the tales, I find that this film stands quite well on its own, and is true enough to give an accurate picture of the delightful, very comic and very serious character of Father Brown.  Alec Guinness, of course, was one of the best actors of the last century, and he brings the Father to life.  His authenticity validates this film, to my thinking.  Flambeau, the sophisticated thief (played by Peter Finch) who underestimates his quirky adversary's worldly wisdom, is equally well drawn.  The movie should also be honored for a quality you will rarely find in films today: respect for religion.

My only bone to pick is that THE DETECTIVE is not available on DVD!  How long, O, how long will it be?  I hope it'll be before my VHS player wears out!",1276473600,2,1139,4.683417085427136
508474,5,6302768837,"G. K. Chesterton's clerical sleuth Father Brown is one of the great creations of British detective fiction. The Father Brown stories are a delightful mixture of wit, intrigue, and
philosophical reflection. In 1954, Father Brown came to the silver screen in the person of the versatile Alec Guiness in Robert Hamer's classy adaptation. Although Chesterton's stories are set in the Edwardian era, the film updates the action (very stylishly, I think) to the 1950's. The screenplay, basically an expanded version of the story ""The Blue Cross"", has Father Brown chasing after stolen art treasures and trying to convert the thief, the flamboyant Flambeau. The movie does a nice job of distilling Father Brown's world; we even get to see him preaching a sermon at Mass and visiting his bishop, things which are only referred to in the stories. Though (I think) little of the dialogue comes directly from Chesterton, the writers have managed to come up with some very Chestertonian lines (some examples: ""The first thing you noticed when you came in the room was what was not there"", ""It's all so nonsensical, it must make sense"", and ""The only visible door leads nowhere...perhaps there is an invisible door leading somewhere""). Alec Guiness is truly a marvel, miraculously transforming himself into this bespectacled, round-faced priest whose foolish countenace conceals a keen detective mind. (Guiness, incidentally, became a Catholic shortly after making this film.) The musical score is by Georges Auric, a noted French composer who also wrote the score for Coctueau's LA BELLE ET LA BETE. This is altogether a delightful British comedy-mystery.",1101945600,11,1643,5.250950570342205
508475,4,6302768837,"In some ways, this is a charming but minor British comedy, most memorable for yet another in a seemingly infinite collection of excellent
comedic performances by Alec Guinness and for the opportunity to see a couple of great character actors in unusual roles : Bernard Lee (M in
the Bond Movies), as a police inspector and Peter Finch (of Network fame) as the debonair thief, Flambeau.  You can take it for just that and
enjoy the film thoroughly.
But, on another level, the movie offers a relatively rare instance of cinema taking religious ideas seriously.  The more obvious concept that
plays out here is that of redemption.  Father Brown (Guinness) is not just another in the long line of British amateur sleuths who solves crimes
as a hobby, he's also a priest, concerned with saving the malefactors' souls.  For those of us raised on Dirty Harry movies, the very notion that
criminals have souls is disturbing enough.  But there's an even grander idea at play here; for Father Brown believes--quite rightly--that his life
as a priest, rather than insulating him from the rough and tumble of the ""real"" world makes him uniquely qualified to understand it and to
comprehend the darkest parts of the human heart.  He explains to Flambeau that he hears things in the confessional that reveal all our faults and
failings and :
  The more you learn about other people, the more you understand yourself;
  and the more you understand yourself, the more you understand other people.
In fact, part of Father Brown's technique is a kind of early form of profiling; time and again he places himself in the criminal's mind and works
out how he might be thinking.  And this is fitting because it is the signal insight of Judeo-Christianity, specifically, and, thereby, of
conservatism generally, that lurking within even the best of us (like a Father Brown) is all of the capacity and desire for sin that defines the
worst of us.  The film has great fun with this as Father Brown enacts or reenacts the very crimes he's supposed to be investigating, and as it
does we see the thin line that separates him, or any of us, from the heinous.
As always, Alec Guinness inhabits his role to almost supernatural perfection--he's every bit the pudgy, too clever, cleric, managing to be both
endearingly sweet and scampishly wise in the ways of the world.  Watching him perform one of these trademark screen transformations, I'm
always reminded of the line from Leonard Maltin's review of The Ladykillers ""even his teeth are funny!""  Unfortunately the story meanders a
little bit--G. K. Chesterton's original Father Brown adventures are just short stories, perhaps for good reason--and certain actions of the good
Father are difficult to reconcile with his character (like fooling the police into arresting an innocent man).  Still and all, it's a good deal of fun
and the moral issues it addresses give it an unexpected, but welcome, gravity.

508476,5,6302768837,"Alec Guinness gives a wonderful performance as the priest-turned-sleuth in 'The Detective', called 'Father Brown' in the UK. Guinness is fairly young in this film, and it is wonderful for any fan of his other work ('Kind Hearts and Coronets' and 'Captain's Paradise' come to mind as earlier examples, or later work when he had become more well-known here in America,) to see him as a younger man. He is also accompanied by a marvellous cast, with Joan Greenwood and Peter Finch. The plot line is not complex, it is a classic sleuth sort of film, with an art thief (played by Finch) whom Father Brown is determined to catch, not only to bring justice, but also to, in his priest's duty, save the man's soul. It is admittedly not full of high drama twists and turns, but it is a mystery in the classic sense, and Guinness makes it more than worth it. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves mysteries, old movies, Alec Guinness, or all of the above!",979948800,21,957,4.53757225433526

7830703,2,6302768837,"Although I found this movie almost unwatchable in spite of the great
Alex Guiness and Peter Finch. Beautiful scenes of France. The problem for me is the very troubling lack of ethics and morality in the character of Father Brown. Really quite alarming. At the very beginning, he is talking to a thief he knows. He scolds him for not being good enough at his work-thievery. He says he will get him a legitimate job as a chauffeur. He refers him to a female practitioner without telling her
The man's history. WTH!!! From there Father Brown goes on to lie to the police, to his church superiors. He steals. He gets in violent alterations and in the end, he takes it upon himself to absolve  a major art thief of his crimes, again deceiving the police and his church. This does seem to be the justice under which our present society operates.

I think it is one of the most immoral films I have ever seen. A man above the law because God has special things for him to do.",1438128000,,968,4.372222222222222

7830707,5,6302768837,"Sir Alec and GK Chesterton were the reasons i decided to purchase this video--never having seen it.  I was NOT disappointed.  As a Catholic, it is right on point.  What was MOST delightful was the insistence of ""Fr. Brown"" (Sir Alec) in his living out a life of God's Providence.  He could be completely wrong in any part of the story, but is craftier and has the ""Hand of God"" directing him by virtue of his faith.  I have not purchased any of the other ""Fr. Brown"" DETECTIVE vhs's because no one can live up to the humility, humanity and faith as portrayed by Sir Alec.  But that is just my opinion.  To see another ""Fr. Brown"" would be like watching anyone but Peter Sellers play in the Pink Panther movies---if you find otherwise--please let me know.  THE DETECTIVE IS accurate, funny, wry,  and to the point every step of the way.  LOVE THIS FILM.  love, maureen",1366243200,2,867,4.45859872611465

The Bishop summons Father Brown to safeguard the famous Blue Cross that will be sent to Rome for the Eucharistic Congress. Father Brown has a plan to hide the cross among the hundreds of priests traveling to the same destination. The bishop rejects this plan, he wants a police escort. Father Brown entrains to the Channel to sail to France. Many passengers view the sea from the railings. He talks to a motor car salesman on the ship. Other passengers enter the cabin of the train. Father Brown talks about what he learned from some of his parishioners. Another priest joins him on the train. Two detectives watch Father Brown and follow him. ""Want to see a French postcard?""

The Catacombs of Paris are a former stone quarry which was filled with the bones of millions from the cemeteries of Paris. Father Brown talks to Flambeau in private and learns what he does. ""I don't care about other people."" The police detectives search for them. Did Father Brown outsmart Flambeau? Were the packages switched again? What punishment will follow? Can Father Brown recover the stolen cross? Can he think like the criminal to solve the crime? Will he set a trap to catch Flambeau? People show up for the auction of the Cellini chess set. Will a clever thief try to steal it? Would he return it to the lady? Can a clever Flambeau escape in a milkman's truck? Father Brown explains how he pierced the disguise of Flambeau. Flambeau explains his life. Can the Blue Cross be recovered? The hounds have been unleashed.

Father Brown returns to Paris to search the records of heraldry of French aristocrats. A heavy book falls on his glasses to introduce comic scenes. He gets a clue from a wine bottle! Fleurency is in Burgundy. The train rolls on. The police follow Father Brown. A candy wrapper is a clue. People celebrate the wine harvest with a traditional dance. ""He's gone!"" But Father Brown follows Flambeau like a hound after a hare. He visits the nursery and sees the toys. They talk about philosophy and Flambeau's collection. Father Brown preaches about salvation. The police followed him and recovered the stolen goods. Father Brown will not be prosecuted. Will Flambeau change his ways? Will there be a happy ending.

This is an adaption of G. K. Chesterton's short story ""The Blue Cross"" which introduced ""Father Brown"". There was a television series of the ""Father Brown"" stories in British TV in the late 1950s. None have been made available in video recordings.",1329782400,,2491,4.786046511627907
