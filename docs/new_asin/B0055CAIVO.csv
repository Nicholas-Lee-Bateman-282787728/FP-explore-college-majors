4573822,5,B0055CAIVO,"If you love horror and comedy you'll simply go nutz for this film. It is hilarious from beginning to end! All the characters are crazy (especially ""Old Lady Blume"". Not only is this great entertainment that you will howl over but it even has a ""twist"". Guaranteed to entertain anyone who is a fan of the ""Godfather of Gore"", Herschell Gordon Lewis.",1314576000,5,348,4.629032258064516

8458014,1,B0055CAIVO,"Other than the fact that this was Herschell Gordon Lewis's last attempt at directing, this movie holds no surprises.  It is just fake looking gore with bad acting.  I only bought it to complete my ""HGL"" library.",1494892800,,211,4.675675675675675
8458015,4,B0055CAIVO,"Pretty much exactly what I'd expect from a modern HGL flick. Right now I don't remember anything that stands out aside from the standard gore, poor acting, and sense of humor we've all come to love from Lewis. Nothing that will blow your mind, and nothing that is going to be as weird as the first time you saw the Gruesome Twosome.",1446249600,,332,4.370967741935484
8458016,4,B0055CAIVO,"Herschell Gordon Lewis actually made a good movie here. And, I don't mean 'so bad it's good' like his other movies. This one is actually good, funny, and most importantly...bloody as hell! You can tell he had a lot of fun making it. Highly recommended.",1445990400,,252,4.622222222222222
8458017,5,B0055CAIVO,Crazy and fun! this is HG Lewis at his best! this is such a silly and fun movie it's hard not to love it,1384560000,,104,3.375
8458018,4,B0055CAIVO,"Mr. Lewis returns with his newest gorefest, and while entertaining, it's also a bit disappointing....to me anyway.  I realize how silly it is to criticize a Lewis film, and it seriously pains me to say anything negative about his stuff, but I just wasn't feelin' it the same way I did with some of his other gore films.  I guess I was more intrigued by it than anything.
As you probably already know, it's about a reality/gameshow where the contestants are dismembered if they answer incorrectly.  The public thinks it's just a gory put-on, but a news reporter is determined to bring to the public the fact that the contestants are being killed for real.  Meanwhile, the network execs are striking while the iron is hot and pitching a new television show that's a kind of gory, Tales From The Crypt-esque rendition of Grimm's Fairy Tales.
The Uh-Oh Show continues the zany comedy of Lewis' previous film, Blood Feast 2, but to me it wasn't as funny as that movie.  There's certainly gore here, but less that I would have expected from Lewis.  This is probably the most story oriented of his gore films.  This is one of those films where characters don't seem to feel the pain of the dismemberment.  You know, they continue to laugh and talk even after being disemboweled and even decapitated.  That joke has always wore pretty thin with me.  I can buy that in a Troma film or something, but as zany as some of Lewis' gore has been, the victims were never having a good time with it.  Though comical at times, it was still kinda disturbing in it's own way, like in The Gore Gore Girls.
Lewis himself pops in and out of the film as a kind of storyteller/narrator, and actually has some of the funnier lines.  Years ago Lewis had said that he had wanted to make a full length film based on the whole Grimm Fairy Tale thing, which makes sense why it's so prevalent in this movie.  At least it was partially realized.
I seriously don't want to be too critical of this movie because I have nothing but respect for Lewis, and I think it is so cool that a guy his age(he's like 85 I believe), who's a millionaire from his marketing job, still cranks out this crazy stuff once in awhile.  He obviously isn't doing it for the money.  He may say that he does films purely for the money, but it's obviously more than that.  This does come across as a labor of love.
Don't get me wrong, I did enjoy aspects of this movie, and if Lewis makes another, you can bet I'll be first in line to see it.  You can't hit it out of the park every time, and I suppose that Blood Feast 2 set the bar kinda high for me.
Still, if you're a Lewis fan, you must see it!",1338076800,6,2638,4.340122199592668
8458019,5,B0055CAIVO,what can i say its so a much watch for any fan of one herschel gordon lewis. lots of gore loads of comedy and a cameo by another legend of the indie film biz troma's lloyd kaufman makes an appearance as a pimp lol,1320364800,3,213,3.8636363636363638
8458020,5,B0055CAIVO,"From the Godfather of gore himself,H.G.Lewis comes one of the best horrorcomedys in a long time. This film is not for someone with a weak stomach. The movie delivers cheesy gore and plenty of laughs. If you are a fan of HG lewis then you must see The uh-oh show.",1317859200,5,262,4.26
8458021,5,B0055CAIVO,"If you like gore comedies, Uh-Oh Show is probably the best of the year (at least until Cesar & Otto's Summer Camp Massacre comes out next month). It doesn't top Lewis' last film, Blood Feast 2: All U Can Eat, but it still delivers the gore and laughs. The funniest scene had to be Lloyd Kaufman playing a pimp. For those who don't know, Kaufman is the president of Troma Studios and has directed many Troma movies, and acted in a whole lot of movies as well. He is absolutely hilarious, and H.G. Lewis should direct a spin-off with Kaufman's pimp. Uh-Oh Show is pretty uneven, but the entertainment value makes up for it. I was never bored while watching, and that's something that doesn't happen much these days. Fans of indie horror and comedy should definately pick this up, but it helps if your a fan of Lewis' past films.",1314921600,4,826,4.47682119205298
8458022,5,B0055CAIVO,"Just aaaaamazing!! You have to see it for yourself to understand how amazing this flick is! If you're a Herschell Gordon Lewis fan or exploitation cinema fan, you won't be disappointed!! It's bloody hilarious... Literally!",1314748800,5,222,5.371428571428571
