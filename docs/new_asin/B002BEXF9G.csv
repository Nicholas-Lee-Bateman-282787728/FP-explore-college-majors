3893636,5,B002BEXF9G,"I have seen the Zombies live several times and this DVD captures them perfectly.  Finally having a live document of ""Odessey and Oracle"" is a treasure that was worth the wait.  The production quality of both sound and video is amazing.  This is without a doubt the best concert video I have ever seen.",1265760000,11,301,4.537037037037037
3893637,5,B002BEXF9G,"Picked this up after a lifetime (32 years, in my case) of having passing familiarity with the Zombies. I'd heard Time of the Season and She's Not There, but nothing else. After going through their catalogue more extensively, I realized just how underrated the band was. The original album is, in my mind, a masterpiece. I was happy to see they still tour, so picked up this DVD in preparation for an upcoming show. All I can say is, ""Holy. Bloody. Hell.""

There are very few bands left who can replicate the sounds of an album with the accuracy done here. Besides the technical proficiency, the joy that came off every single person on that stage was contagious! It's clear they all love what they do. I was especially amazed at Hugh Grundy's skill after all these years out of music. Paul Atkinson's absence was especially poignant, but Keith Airey did a wonderful job in his stead. He didn't replace Paul, but he sure did him proud! I found myself tearing up a lot while watching, it just made me so happy to see them doing what they do best.

As for the merits of the DVD itself, I really think this is another example of how short-changed these guys continue to be. The video/audio footage is pretty well done. It's pretty typical to use multiple shows in one cut, if they exist. Minor sync issues here and there, but no biggie. My quibble is with the DVD menus and the editing on the bonus feature. It looks like something a high school kid cobbled together on iDVD or something. The bonus footage floating around on the screen randomly made me nauseous and I had to watch it multiple times to fully grasp the stories being told. Which is a shame, as the fellas sure tell their story well.

None of this puts me off from continuing to watch this when the fancy strikes. I also had no hesitation ordering it for my mother-in-law, who is also a big Zombies fan. It's a great addition to the collection if you're a fan. A big thanks to Darien Sahanaja, who I understand was one of the driving forces that made this happen!",1377043200,,2024,4.450134770889488
3893638,4,B002BEXF9G,"It's amazing how the album ""Odessey & Oracle"" has aged.  The band's live performance of this classic album made it sound refreshing and new all over again (even after 40 years).  Where have they been all these years?",1370736000,,216,4.657894736842105

3893640,5,B002BEXF9G,"The Zombies were one of the greatest bands of the sixties but they were very unappreciated.  They only had three ""hits"" but every record they released was a masterpiece.  The Odessey & Oracle album, in my opinion, is one of the twenty best recordings every made.  This DVD brings the surviving members of the band to recreate this masterpiece in concert.  They do it magnificently!!!!!!!!!!  Do yourself a favor and get this before it's out of print.",1362528000,,450,4.792207792207792
3893641,5,B002BEXF9G,This concert is as good as all the other 5 star reviewers stated. Fine performance by all. Bought as a gift for husband and he loves it.,1359331200,,136,4.074074074074074
3893642,3,B002BEXF9G,"First of all:
I am a huge Zombies fan and as I discovered that the 40th anniversary concert of ""Odessey and Oracle"" is available on DVD, I just had to have it.
At Germany's amazon.de there was not a single review, but sixteen reviews (and all of them with five stars) on amazon.com convinced me....

Knowing the audio part I knew it would be great...and it is!
It is a performance on an absolutely top level, with relaxed players who just want to make good music, everything was described here before in earlier posts.
There is no doubt, that the performance would gain more that five stars in here.

So why only three stars from my side (""Jehova, Jehova ..."")?

Because the whole DVD production is not even of some average quality.

Why is there only a 5.1 Dolby Digital Soundtrack? Why did they not produce a DVD-9 instead of a single-layer DVD-5 and put there at least a DTS track or much better: An uncomprerssed stereo PCM track? I know how good the CD sounds, that DD5.1 is washing everything out.

But the video...The first time watching I wondered, why the drummer is often out of sync with the picture, but sometimes he is not! I am a drummer myself, so I maybe more sensitive for that.
But at the second watch I had a closer look:

THEY USED FOOTAGE FROM ALL THREE CONCERTS!

Because the band played without any ""click"", it sure was hard to get those tree unique recordings together...and because of that, the picture often looks like it does not fit to the sound.

Because it really does not fit....

This may be O.K for some sterile Pink Floyd recording and worked perfectly well on ""Stop Making Sense"", but it does not fit here. You can feel the band making you goose skin at some parts because one can almost touch them  and suddenly the feeling changes to ""what the hell is going on, it looks like they are wrapped in cellophane"".
Because suddenly the picture is footage from a different night....ouch!

The fast cutting is disturbing as well as the multi-picture-views with footage from different nights shown simultaneously...ouch again!

If the concert would not be THAT great, I might have stopped the DVD....but I am glad I didn't.

Ah, forgot, there are excerpts of an interview with the band members as bonus, but why, for God's sake, they are showing them on small, moving picture frames floating round in space with stars flying around them and making a permanent mumbling background noise! Ouch again.....

So: A great concert DVD with absolutely unprofessional editing....",1357430400,3,2498,4.67351598173516
3893643,5,B002BEXF9G,"Wow!  This concert is super fantastic!  We have watched it several times already, and ordered 2 more copies for gifts.  The Zombies remain a wonder!",1355184000,,148,4.84
3893644,5,B002BEXF9G,"Eventually, someone will write a negative review of the Zombies 40th Anniversary Odessey & Oracle DVD; give it two stars and complain about the editing or the audio mixing or the color saturation.

But it sure ain't gonna be me.

Some of the other reviews may sound hyperbolic, but be assured, they aren't exaggerating.  For anyone who has sat, stunned, listening to the original album for the first time, be it in 1969 or 1999, the very idea that the Zombies would reunite in 2008 to film a live rendition of the whole album would seem to be a fantasy beyond any possibility of fulfillment.  This DVD has no right to exist here; it belongs in some much better world than ours.  It has no right to be this perfect.  But it is.

The absolute authority with which they perform is astounding.  This is their masterpiece. They own it. They nail it. And they know it.  Their faces show the joy of transcending themselves and time itself.  Colin Blunstone reaches somewhere beyond his slender frame to produce ""that voice"" as if it were his final performance. Rod Argent's keyboards and vocals are note-perfect and inspired.  He's clearly the leader of the band. The songs segue effortlessly. The first time I watched it, it was so magical that I was afraid to press the pause button. It might never start again.  I might wake up.

Darian Sahanaja of The Wondermints and Brian Wilson's band seems to have had some svengali-like involvement in the project.  Based on this DVD and his work with Brian, I believe he should be put in charge of the Mid-East peace talks. He can use his mellotron to interrupt arguments.

Do yourself a major favor.  Buy this DVD.  Give yourself joy.",1325808000,4,1671,4.629251700680272
3893645,5,B002BEXF9G,"The original LP has been one of my all-time favourites since I bought it in 1969.
A glorious album full of lush melodies, inventive arrangements and fabulous songs covering a multitude of topics [horrors of war,friendship, prison, death], highlighted the talent of this five-man group as musicians and Rod Argent and Chris White as songwriters.
ODESSEY & ORACLE is the REAL 'lost classic'.
The band had already broken up after several years trying to follow-up their hits She's Not There and Tell Her No. Something had gone wrong despite many fine singles and lots of raves.
To my ears, Time of the Season is one of the weaker tracks, though a massive hit!
Beechwood Park, Brief Candles, the joyous Friends Of Mine and the fabulous gem Hung Up On A Dream are the high points of a stunning album. Since I've had it on CD,I never play the album without repeating some of the tracks!
OK, the DVD?
This contains a 40th Anniversary run-through of the complete album live , and more, by the surviving members - sadly lead guitarist Paul Atkinson had passed away several years previously. From the opening bars, I couldn't stop smiling at the wonder of seeing this album performed live [it had never been done before] and so brilliantly!
Sure, they look older, but Colin Bluntstone on lead vocals is superb and the instrumentation and arrangements are spot on. Shut your eyes and you're transported back in time. Rod Argent does a great leader's job on organ, Hugh Grundy's drums replicated the original version with ease and Chris White looked every bit an accountant or whatever on bass.  All superbly done.
There are other features such as additional live material and interviews, but, enjoyable and informative though they are, I went straight to ODESSEY AND ORACLE LIVE. Such a terrific treat.
Buy a copy for yourself and invite several friends around. Great pictures, great sound , great music. You'll be smiling too.",1309305600,11,1916,4.859327217125382
3893646,5,B002BEXF9G,"I purchased this with some hesitation...I was not very happy with the Zombie's first dvd, Live at the Bloomsbury theatre.  I had heard about The Bloomsbury dvd and looked it up on amazon...I thought I was purchasing the dvd when it was actually the double cd, which by the way, is far superior to the dvd...If you have been fortunate enough to see the revamped Zombies, in the states, you quickly discover that Rod Argent feels the need to play all of the familiar tunes and give historical background to those that you might not be familiar with...NOT NECESSARY ROD!!!  WE KNOW AND LOVE ALL OF THE OBSCURE TUNES AND WISH YOU WOULD PLAY MORE!!! If you hear me Rod, when you come here in September, I would like to hear whenever you're ready and I'll call you mine....So, that dvd was heavy on the familiar and light on the more obscure...Now let us turn our attention to the Odessey and Oracle dvd...Something I notice when older artists put out a new product is that the critics tend to be overly kind in their assessments, excusing them for the erosion of former skills...So, I held my breath and then it was taken away after the first viewing... No erosion!!! If there is one voice on earth, that transcends all others, it is that of Colin Blunstone!!! Clearly, God kissed him on the lips at birth!!  He does not disappoint in any way...Does he sound twenty years old? No, but he is in extremely good voice and everything here works...As for Rod Argent, I defy anyone to present a more nimble, exuberant 60 year old on any instrument...I have seen him live three times with this outfit and never does he disappoint...I have always loved his voice and now it has a bit of a rasp...Frankly, I can't tell whether I like the new voice or the old voice better...HE IS THAT GOOD!!!  As for the songs, if Odessey and Oracle is not the greatest record ever recorded, someone please present the competition...I have gone through Rolling Stones, Beatles and Kinks phases where I didn't think that anyone could touch them...From the first notes of this record, you are drawn in and I only have one complaint about records from this period, THEY WERE TOO FRICKING SHORT!!!  As the years have gone by, this record has become my most treasured...I often find myself getting bogged down in the emotional climate of the period when many of the older records from my collection were released...As the years have passed, I have found that one of the few records that allows me to transcend time and space is Odessey and Oracle...My experience seems to run counter to the critics who continually minimize the Zombies contributions referring to their songs as minor key classics, as if only one in a somber mood could fully appreciate their music...Songs in minor keys have always been tagged as sad or melancholy.  Minor chords add color!!!  Without the minor chord, you have no color....The Zombies have color to spare... I find their music joyful and worthy of celebration..If you love Odessey and Oracle the record, you will love the dvd and Thank God some money was invested in the video production...(The Bloomsbury dvd looks positively homemade)!!!  If you have the original record, and let me add that this record was impossible to find in the states when it first came out--I found it in a bargain bin about 3 years after its initial release (which only goes to show what an enduring classic it is because every song sounded fresh and new three years later), I need not remind you of what a joy it is from start to finish...The same can be said for this performance which is exceptional, old band and revamped band...Having seen the band live, I was not prepared for how full and rich Steve Rodford's drums sounded....I am sure some expense was spared but it is not evident in the quality of the product...There is one holy grail when it comes to music dvds and it is John Martyn's The man upstairs...Perhaps only because he was at the height of his powers and we all know the sad ending to his story...As far as I know, from different articles I have read, the Zombies steered away from the substances that have claimed many great artists...Because of this, they soldier on and are in a league above all others....People talk about royalty...THIS IS ROYALTY....As far as the holy grail goes, this dvd is only one breath away from The man upstairs....Thing is, when it is Colin's breath, how far away can that really be???",1308355200,4,4414,4.65
3893647,5,B002BEXF9G,"There is a good reason every single reviewer gives this DVD 5 stars. To me, watching the Zombies play their masterpiece Odessey and Oracle on this DVD is the musical equivalent of seeing the Beatles rise from dead and play the Stg. Pepper album for you (of course maybe that's why they are called the ""Zombies""). It's hard to believe this concert really happened and its hard to believe the Zombies still sound so good! I've watched the Odessey and Oracle segment and the Tell Her No/She's Not There part over and over and over again and it's so beautiful and melodic it often makes me cry. Lead singer Colin Blunstone can still sing.  Rod Argent is still an amazing keyboard player with a great touch.  Bass player and songwriter Chris White reminds me of Brian Wilson in the Beach Boys, the big guy in the middle who holds everything together.  Seeing him sing Butcher's Tale is stunning. So is Brief Candles when Rod, Chris and Colin each sing a verse. It's absolutely amazing to see original drummer Hugh Grundy play these songs.  He still holds his drumsticks the same way and plays exactly like he did on Shindig in 1965.  Brian Wilson's own musical historian and fact checker, Darian Sahanaja, helped put this together and he is great on the Mellotron parts, the harmony vocals and just making sure everything is played correctly.  I'm not lying to you when I say this DVD is one of the high points of Western Music.",1298937600,10,1423,4.604743083003952
3893648,5,B002BEXF9G,"I'd always been a Zombies fan - but they were gone from the scene way to early to appreciate them fully. This DVD is proof they were an essential element of the British Invasion. They perform all their hits - AND the entire Odyssey and Oracle album. The sound and film quality are fantastic. What a great keepsake - I've seen it several times and still can't believe how masterful they performed - must have been quite the night in London.
Five Stars all the way!",1294185600,5,463,4.395348837209302
3893649,5,B002BEXF9G,"Want to be impressed by some 60s veteran rockers?  Here's exactly where to come.  I bought the Zombies' Zombie Heaven box set back in the spring of this past writing, and have become involved in most anything by the group or its individual members since.

What a shame that they had such a hard go at it in the 60s, because Odessey and Oracle was and still remains one of the most magical and underrated albums of its time.  What a pleasure to see that, 4 decades on, these incredible musicians haven't lost their touch. This live performance is full of magic and intimacy, plus they also perform various songs from early Zombies years, some from Colin Blunstone's solo albums, and some from Rod Argent's self titled group.  Excellent performances that make you feel like you're right there, and a great bonus interview feature on the making of an incredibly underrated album.  Great for long-time fans and newcomers alike, this is one classic rock DVD you have to add to your collection.",1290124800,5,988,4.715116279069767
3893650,5,B002BEXF9G,"I love watching this concert! Colin Blunstone, probably best known for ""Time of The Season"" by the Zombies sings flawlessly and the collection of songs is the best! It's amazing that after all these years these guys still have it! I'm a big fan of Colin Blunstone as his vocals are so unique and can also be heard on many Alan Parsons Project albums. It's a total joy to watch Colin and Rod Argent breathe new life into these classic songs from their past including a fantastic live version of Rod's ""Hold Your Head Up""!!! This DVD is a great buy! A MUST for anyone who loves the classic rock genre!",1289174400,3,599,4.405405405405405
3893651,5,B002BEXF9G,"if you're fan of the Zombies, this is a dvd you have to buy. the 1st half features the touring band, the 2nd half of concert brings together the original band minus the original guitarist who passed away a few years ago. the band sounds great with top notch vocals. you won't be disappointed....ITS AWESOME !!!!",1275696000,3,311,4.571428571428571
3893652,5,B002BEXF9G,"I stumbled across this DVD quite by accident and I must say that this is an incredible DVD.  Kudos to the rest of the reviewers here for they have put into words the exact same thoughts I would convey.

However, for those who think this will surpass the original album; I would beg to differ.  If you are an absolute purist, you will hear the faults but this is forgivable since this is 40 years transfixed and a studio recording can do take after take and create layer upon layer until total perfection is reached.

If you are the type of person who likes the live performance with it's natural spontaneous energy and the flaws only add to a one of a kind event, then this is the best DVD you will ever hear of The Zombies.

The performances are true to the original recording; lovingly put together and performed and Colin Blunstone's voice is still a beautiful and delicate instrument.  He has been far and away, my all time favorite singer.  On record, his natural breathy and wispy voice comes through better than in live performance.  This can only be because it doesn't translate as well in live performance.  It does however; come through enough so that you won't be disappointed if this is what you like most about him.

As a singer overall, in a live performance, he shows much more range than in recordings and not to leave out the band, for a bunch of 60 something rockers, they still bring the goods.  Rod Argent can hold his own with any of the keyboard players of today.

The album 40 years later still holds up extremely well in live performance.  It is one of my top 5 all time favorites and although I may be a little bias, you won't be disappointed in the purchase of this DVD!!!!!",1275523200,5,1700,4.427652733118971

Rod Argent is a phenominal keyboard player and Colin Blunstone's vocals have gotten better with age while most vocalists ""lose"" their voices. This DVD is worth every penny without a doubt. I have about 400 music DVD's and this one is without equal and my very favorite. The one is an absolute MUST BUY for anyone who treasures the Zombies. They perform ""Odyessey & Oracle"" absolutely perfectly and do not miss a single note. It is hard to believe that 40 years have passed since the Odyessey & Oracle release. This is a perfect music DVD !! I only wish I could rate it HIGHER than 5 out of 5 stars !! Incredibly great in all respects . The photography , sound and music are ALL as good as possible !!

To hear that album performed live from beginning to end was breathtaking.  Colin Blunstone did 3 numbers backed by only a string quintet (in the first set), and that was mesmerizing as well.  Even if you're only slightly familiar with the album, get this DVD and prepare yourself for the musical treat of a lifetime.",1269820800,3,476,4.9
3893656,5,B002BEXF9G,"When I was young in the mid 60's and in a ""band"" there were three great bands that gave my friends music to inspire.  The first was the beatles for starting it all, the second was the Byrds for combining folk and rock, and the third was the Zombies for thier fusion of jazz and rock in a very minor key.  Chris White and his group, most notably colin Blundstone on wisper vocals had two monster hits for themselves in Tell Her No and She's Not There.  The rest of their work never reached the public notice it deserved and so in '68 they produced one last album, Odessey and Oracle.  That was their masterpiece!  They even had one more hit from it - Time of the Season.  Amazing becasue it broke after the band had given up, broken up and moved on to other things.  Now forty years latter the surving members have reformed and recreated the album, along with several of the best of their body of songs for this DVD.  Featuring a well played string group to ""add"" to the note perfect recreation we can enjoy this wondeful work again as now ""well aged"" creators again ply their trade.

Seeing Chris White, who wrote more than half of this album, and drummer Hugh Grundy perform with former band mates Colin Blunstone and Rod Argent was just an intense joy.

8361139,4,B002BEXF9G,"Part 2: the performance of the reunited four (plus) was blissfully entertaining for me.  Hearing the live O&O plus their two biggest hits was a absolute joy, and as others have stated, their chops are tops. (5/5 stars)

Part 1: again, terrific performance, great music (really liked Colin's string-accompanied performance) but the material covered simply doesn't hold up to the high bar of part 2. (4/5 stars)

Bonus material: While I appreciate that they included anything at all, I REALLY wish that there wasn't only portions of a documentary, but rather the whole thing.  A full length documentary on the band would have made a fantastic bonus addition.  That said, I would NOT count that against my review of the DVD overall, since I really purchased the concert, not the documentary.  I mention it, that's all.

The real complaint is one that's very similar to that of ""imploder"", who gave the DVD 3 stars: the video's direction is annoying and misleading.  There's no shortage of camera angles, and it seemed that the director used them all to the point that you couldn't simply watch Colin sing, but that you had to see him through cycling camera shots every 3 seconds or so, then through multiple angles at once on a ""split screen"".  I can understand the theory behind this.  Split screens in cases where you want to see Rod's face and his hands play the keys, or Rod, Colin and Chris in a split screen close up, was great; however, there were a number of unnecessary editing decisions that brought down the viewing experience slightly.

Also worth mentioning that it's stated on the DVD packaging that this is one night, a single performance, March 8, from a three-night engagement (3/7-3/9/2008) but it becomes apparent that other performances were edited in, which is also distracting.  Some brief shots show the band slightly out of sync with the performance, and band members changing their position/expression from edit to edit.  So independent of the band performance and/or music, the video production is somewhat disappointing.  (2.5/5 stars)

Video production notwithstanding, this is far from a deal breaker!  On performance and musical selections alone, 4-1/2 stars.",1379721600,,2186,5.013850415512465
