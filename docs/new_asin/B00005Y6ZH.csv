7956680,5,B00005Y6ZH,"Miro - Theatre of Dreams is an original documentary that interviews and talks with Joan himself. I personally favour many of the expressive artist documentaries that came out of the 1970s such as ""Salvador Dali: A Soft Self Portrait"" (with Orson Welles Narrating) and ""The Challenge: A Tribute to Modern Art"" (also Welles narration) (and both equally difficult to find).
Theatre of Dreams follows that same level of expressive presentation that suits an artist's sensibilities and imagination. The music choices may not suit everyone (just like the other two documentaries mentioned previous) and the questions and facts are not all encompassing of Miro, but the video is a great introduction and/or overall look at the essence of his character (even though it's of him at 85). If you are looking for an in-depth examination of his famous works or an extensive look at his catalog or life timeline, I recommend books versus DVD study.

The costumes Miro designed for the Claca are also prominently featured on here. A rare look at his moving art work.

The DVD has subtitles encoded but you must turn them on. I cannot speak for the VHS version, but I imagine that higher-end televisions with closed captions would equally display subtitles in the VHS version (a previous reviewer voiced frustration over the lack of subtitles on VHS - the review was from 2000).

The version on this DVD is unretouched and has a grainy look to it. I favour this look as it is strongly associative with the time period (1970s).",1391990400,,1510,4.890625
7956681,5,B00005Y6ZH,"This is a sensitive delving into the works, and mind, of Joan Miro.  He is captured by the camera exactly as one can imagine.  He looks and sounds like the creative genius he is.  He looks and sounds like a classic Catalan or Frenchman, like my father, grandfather, and great-grandfather: He speaks from a depth that seems genetic!

His world view grows from early days of starvation as an unknown artist, to the fame he received when Hemmingway bought his THE FARM.  That set the fires going, and he created amazing creatures of art.  He eventually is involved with theatre, set design, costuming, character (monsters) creation, and how he moves from the 2 dimensionality of painting to the 3 dimensionality of ""on stage"" and ""creative consultant"" is a model for any young artist, designer, or painter to view and be inspired.

I've bought many copies of this DVD for I believe it is important to share with young artists, fashion designers, and theatre and drama students.

I feel I have been taken by hand and walked from his poor youth to his dream of a BIG STUDIO coming to realization.

Most of the DVD is in his studio, a grand place, inhabited by his many friends!

It is like watching some foreign culture unfold...like watching Lamas chant and open the universe to everyday viewing!",1223078400,3,1292,4.727678571428571
