8590062,5,B00D6I7GM8,"Really funny and entertaining. Like everybody else, I love GC's perspective on life and the little things he often picks out to analyze with his comic mind. It's so sad that he's gone because I can't think of any other comedian like him. Anyway, this was a really good show.",1413763200,,274,4.5
8590063,5,B00D6I7GM8,"This show was his penultimate for HBO and it was blistering.... from his classic ""Modern Man"" opening (worth the price alone) to his still relevant take on our obese consumer society and reality TV culture.... this rocks from start to finish and I give it my highest of all recommendations.  Should you upgrade from DVD to BR?  You don't get any extra content, just a bit crisper image of old George. Genius commentary doesn't date and just seems more prophetic and profound given the time passing and this is a perfect example.",1391644800,,528,4.728260869565218
