8369040,3,B002FGYJEA,"This DVD is the copy of ""Dance Vision"" DVD `Anyone Can Dance"" with Donald Johnson and Kasia Kozak. I own the original copy of that DVD about 10 years and would never buy it would the seller place a brief description of contest. I was misled by the photo on the cover of the DVD  (the couple is not D. Jonhson and Kasia Kozak) and the country of the seller -Germany.
I would recommend this DVD for beginners for following reasons only: 1 )the original Dance Vision DVD is more expensive ($14.99) that this copy and 2)the instructors are Donald Johnson and Kasia Kozak.
But at the same time I would advise: numerous YouTube presentations might teach beginners the same patterns as demonstrated by Donald and Kasia, and much more - free of charge.",1377475200,,744,4.552238805970149
