5036996,5,B006YEQ7EO,This is a fantastic document. Anyone with any interest in the art of improvisational theatre needs to see this film.,1288310400,,116,4.85
5036997,5,B006YEQ7EO,"This documentary is awe-inspiring for any actor who has dabbled with improvising. Even for a 5-year ""veteran"" like myself, I found this DVD to be not only entertaining, but also extremely educational. It's especially helpful for those actors who have been only exposed to short-form improv (like what is seen on ""Whose Line Is It Anyway?""). So if you're an actor who has been improvising for years or just getting started, this is a MUST-SEE!

Also, I think it will be entertaining for non-actors, and would recommend even the casual observer to pick this up. You will not be disappointed.",1275436800,2,589,4.89
5036998,5,B006YEQ7EO,"If you're a fan of TJ and Dave, then you'll appreciate the skillful way Trust Us... captures the genius of their completely improvised show on film.

If you're not familiar with TJ and Dave, I guarantee you'll be awestruck after watching them in action.

The duo are masters of improvisation - but not just because they are funny. It's because they are so real in their performances. In fact, it is the trust they have with one another (so evident in the film), which makes their one-of-a-kind show possible.

Both men are seasoned improvisers, but not seen on film as often as some of their contemporaries (Dave played Stew in Strangers With Candy, and TJ can be seen in Stranger Than Fiction and Sonic commercials, among other things). It's a delight therefore, to see them getting the respect they deserve for their craft.",1270944000,3,825,4.755244755244755
5036999,5,B006YEQ7EO,"I saw this film in a screening.  I've been a TJ and Dave fan for a long time, so my primary concern was that the film would faithfully capture the magic of this remarkable team.  It does.

Without prior consultation, the guys (both Second City alumni) start a dialogue as soon as the lights go up.  As they play, they discover who they are and what the story is.  For those who know improvisation, this is work on a high level.  The swiftness and subtlety of their agreement is breathtaking, and the observations of human behavior are unclouded by improv cliche.  While nothing can replace the thrill of seeing these guys live, being able to go back and watch how they build this particular performance step-by-step offers lessons in craftsmanship that students of acting and writing will profit from.  Combine this with Scott Silberstein's SECOND TO NONE, and you have the best representation of improvisation on video that I know of.",1261267200,6,935,4.763975155279503
5037000,4,B006YEQ7EO,"Amazing talent for doing this show raw with no scripts or teleprompter.  They defiantly know how to keep the audience in ""laugh mode"" and work their material straight from the gut.  I found a couple of very short sections that kind of lagged, but that is my opinion and is probably fine with several others, that is the reason I voted a #4, but I highly recommend this video. It is not only great for adult enjoyment, but for those up and coming folks that want to be involved with stand up improv (like me).",1384732800,,508,4.336842105263158
5037001,5,B006YEQ7EO,Sheer genius! Intelligent and thoughtful comedy which provokes thought and laughter in equal measures of insight and silliness. Makes one believe in ESP,1384473600,,152,5.6521739130434785
5037002,5,B006YEQ7EO,"I have seen T.J. And Dave perform several times at the Barrow Street Theater in NYC. One thing about improv is you can't explain the show you just saw to someone, you have to see the magic live. I was hoping that this recording would be a good representation of the magic I had seen, so I can show it to my friends. Bottom line: it is!",1381708800,,335,4.014925373134329
5037003,5,B006YEQ7EO,A great DVD to have at home to get to know how TJ and Dave work together and to watch one of their shows.,1375315200,,105,3.4166666666666665
5037004,5,B006YEQ7EO,"Although, I'd recommend to anyone as it's just amazing to watch them perform together.  I would really like to see more dvds being released of these two because getting to Chicago mid-week to see them perform in person is challenging!",1374192000,,234,4.85
5037005,5,B006YEQ7EO,"I wish this was still streamable for everybody, but purchasing this video is pretty much worth the entire Prime membership; Trust Us, This Is All Made Up is as beyond describing succinctly as improv itself, but to be brief, if you know anything at all about comedic improvisation, or, better yet, like good improv, then you cannot possibly get away with not having seen this movie.  Not watching this movie is akin to comparing someone to Hitler on usenet: It just shan't be done.",1363996800,,480,4.714285714285714
5037006,4,B006YEQ7EO,"A tour de force of acting improvisation. The particular performance is worth many viewings. These guys are clearly at the top of their game together. The director's commentary is okay, occasionally offering useful insights.",1356480000,,223,5.588235294117647
5037007,5,B006YEQ7EO,"This should be required viewing for anyone interested in pursuing improv. These two are Goliaths of the art form. In this documentary you get a very rare inside glimpse into their process and the thoughts that go into making good, patient, hilarious work.",1330387200,2,255,4.953488372093023
5037008,5,B006YEQ7EO,I am a new improviser and I thought this was just awesome to watch. I loved the way they were able to stick to character's even when they were switching them with each other. Just a great tool for learning how to Improv. I love the last few lines of the movie as well and it just gives a whole new insight into the process and mindset that improvisers take. Awesome!!!,1301184000,2,368,4.197183098591549
5037009,5,B006YEQ7EO,"I have seen their improv show live in Chicago and it's awesome. The DVD really showed background about Dave and TJ. And the performance was so funny, it's amazing its all improvised!",1294790400,2,182,4.71875
8506430,5,B006YEQ7EO,"When it comes to patient, slow-burn, connected improv, there are no substitutes for TJ and Dave, two of the greatest improvisors of all time. I've seen them live and in this movie, and they are the sort of performers who can engage and entertain even the greatest detractor of improv. A far cry from the rapid-fire, punchline-driven improv seen on TV's ""Whose Line is it Anyway?"" and in LA and NY clubs, TJ and Dave begin with nothing - and ""everything"" if you read their excellent book on improv, Improvisation at the Speed of Life - and craft multilayered stories packed with rich characters, who slowly come to life before your eyes. Not aiming for funny, they aim for honesty, which is ultimately where so much humor lives.

This film successfully captures their shared energy, a tight, engaging show, and their post-performance decompression, with no wasted screen time. If you want to understand what the best improv looks like, or you're simply interested in seeing two artists at the top of their game, this is a must view.",1509840000,,1031,4.792134831460674
8506431,5,B006YEQ7EO,"I really enjoyed this.  The core of it was one of the 'trademark' one-hour two-man shows, which was fun and hilarious as always.  The introductory materials (mostly for those unfamiliar with these guys or the format) set it up nicely.  This wouldn't seem quite as amazing if you didn't know (er, ""Trust"") that they do make it up on the spot, new every time.",1456099200,,357,4.546875
8506432,5,B006YEQ7EO,"I enjoyed the DVD very much. I would consider it a ""must see"" for anyone seriously interested in improv, especially longform.  In addition to showing a full length TJ and Dave show, there is a commentary track, which I found to be extremely insightful and helpful as a student of improv. I only wish I had seen it along time ago!",1445385600,,329,4.39344262295082
8506433,5,B006YEQ7EO,"TJ and Dave are amazing performers, with unmatched imagination and intelligence in their improv. I had the pleasure of seeing them perform in New York 8 years ago and in all that time the memory of that one night never faded. I've been doing improv professionally for 15 years now, venturing into this long and unforgiving form since October. Watching this documentary has taught me a lot and inspired me even more. I hope to measure up to their brilliance some day, so someone will order my DVD from across an ocean 8 years after they watched me perform.
In short, buy this.",1444262400,,575,4.592233009708738
8506434,5,B006YEQ7EO,Soo perfect if you are looking at discovering scenes and just be present.  I've given it away 3 times already because I need to find someone who wants to do improv this way.  #makessomuchsense totally joyfilled advice from masters still seeking perfection.,1435536000,,256,5.071428571428571
8506435,5,B006YEQ7EO,"I don't particularly like ""Whose Line Is It, Anyway?""too silly and obviously effortful, for my taste.

I loved watching these two guys, though. They're really good actors who aren't afraid to let a scene take some meaningful or serious turns. Consequently, there seems to be a depth to their work that other improvisers may not allow themselves to exhibit onstage.

I eat the stuff right up, thoughprobably because I take my own serious side even more seriously than I take my funny side. (Yes, I meant to write that. It's deep. Trust me. ;-)

If you relate to any of what I've written, you'll probably love this documentary, too.",1416528000,,630,4.761467889908257
8506436,5,B006YEQ7EO,These men are geniuses.,1408320000,,23,5.0
8506437,5,B006YEQ7EO,"This is one of my favorite improv shows. Not only do you get to laugh for the entire time they are on stage, you get a window into who these people are. The way they work together on stage comes from the time they spend off stage.  Great watch!",1390262400,,244,3.979591836734694
8506438,5,B006YEQ7EO,This is the best recorded version of longform improv I know of. Not surprising since TJ and Dave are two of the best improvisors around. It's a great intro to the art form for folks new to improv or who can't travel to Chicago or New York. And it's inspiring for those of us who practice the art. I love this DVD so much that I've given four or five copies to friends as gifts. Please support these masters of improv. Buy your copy today. You'll be glad you did.,1387929600,,462,4.144444444444445
8506439,5,B006YEQ7EO,"Trust Us allows you to get a closer look at some of the best Improv artists on Earth--T.J. Jagodowski, David Pasquesi
This doc captures the live show and TJ & Dave as good as you can get for not being there live.  Alex Karpovsky (Red Flag, Girls..etc) is as good of a director as he is an actor;  Alex knows understands Improv, the life of the stage, Tj & Dave...etc.  If you don't feel anything after watching Trust Us you may be a serial killer, so get medical help;  moreover, if you have have a chance to see these artists live (Tj & Dave) take the time and go see them.  Watch them close they are masters of emotions and words.  I wish the local libraries all over the world would purchase this dvd.  If you are an actor study this and learn from the best!  Trust me, Trust Us is worth your time!",1385337600,,801,4.1558441558441555
