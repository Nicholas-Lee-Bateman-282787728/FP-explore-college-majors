8742800,5,B018RRS6NK,"It was fantastic. Characters were very well developed and interesting. Colin Farrell in particular was nearly unrecognizable as Detective Ray Velcorro. Not trading on his leading man good looks, his demeanor was that of a down and out, worn out lawman. His performance is first rate !!! Vince Vaughn, did a very good job also. This series ended with an nail biting flourish of action. Well worth watching a 2nd and 3rd time.",1492128000,2,424,4.821917808219178
