8363612,3,B002C8BQOM,"For the uninitiated, this is not a bad introduction to Bernstein, ego and all.  The film alternates between close-up interviews with him and excepts from performances.  Included also is a full performance of Milhaud's La Boeuf sur le toit -- Ballet, op. 58, conducted by Bernstein.  The film is divided into sections featuring perspective on his teaching, mentors, and his impact and work abroad -- as well as thoughts on composing, tonality and American music.  Due credit is given to his truly inspired Children's Concerts, which were and remain wonderfully engaging introductions to classical music.

The problem is that this is a very one-dimensional portrait.  It is Bernstein on Bernstein.  For whatever reason (perhaps project budget or by design, or both) the filmmaker misses many opportunities to bring perspective to (and sometimes relief from!) his subject. Bernstein had an unfortunately pompous and pedantic affectation in his manner; and this trait in him is on major display here as he describes his work and thoughts about music.

Still, the film does capture the real Bernstein and gives the viewer a taste of his sometimes great work and influence.",1260835200,33,1167,5.2032085561497325
