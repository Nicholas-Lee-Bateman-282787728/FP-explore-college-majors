movie 1
this movie was about some made up gangbangers going around terrorizing everybody and sticking it to the white man how unbealieveable you name me one gangbanger that doesnt run when they see the police but yet in this this movie they're killing police officers oh and the blatant disrespect they were showing to women black and white oh and lets not forget white men was dusgusting.this movie was a black criminals fantasy(i know that last line sounds bad but if you watch the movie you'll know what im talking about)lastly you tell me what smart criminal goes around recording their crimes

movie 2
this movie is from the 70s and its about some men coming back from the veitnam war to rid their town of the klan as interesting as it sounds it really wasnt

movie 3
this is also from the 70s and it was about people getting together and getting rid of the criminals in their neghborhood

movie 4
i don't remember thats how good it was

i don't know why they would but 3 movies from the 70s with one movie from today the only thing they have in common is that they suck. save your $4 and thats with shipping and handling",1290384000,,1262,4.2635983263598325
