What a movie!
It took its time to tell a story well.
Somewhat disturbing for all the right reasons.
It's a good idea to be who you are.",1522195200,,145,3.8666666666666667

8601465,2,B00E5MIM4A,I simply didn't feel empathy for the characters. I thought the movie was either badly edited and seemed too long. It was difficult to watch it until the end.,1437004800,,157,4.448275862068965
8601466,5,B00E5MIM4A,"I watched this film after a week of working with the wonderful filmmaker Marcal Fores who was extraordinarily patient, kind, and instructive in teaching my students  in the South Bronx the various aspects of filmmaking. My rating is as much for the man behind this film as for the film itself.  Well done sir!",1424649600,,309,4.703703703703703
8601467,4,B00E5MIM4A,"This was good, weird, but good. The music was superb, I'll be looking all of it up, there literally wasn't one bad song, and the lead can even sing :) the acting was great, martin freeman was a fox, all in all, great movie, I'll probably watch it again.",1410307200,2,253,4.183673469387755

8601469,5,B00E5MIM4A,I loved this movie for the originality.  I would think twice before showing to high-school kids--school scenes and all. Extremely creative piece of work. This movie really can pull you in. It reminded me of some many things from my youth.,1386460800,6,238,4.804878048780488
