8360428,1,B002AUI3D4,"I hate this assissinated DVD version!  It is not the complete story!  It's been abridged/mangled/mutilated so badly the story's messed up.  The scenes jump from one to the other disjointedly, I don't know what's going on!  I would not recommend this DVD version to anyone else.  Don't waste your money!&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Legend-of-Hero/dp/B001AII4N6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Legend of Hero</a>",1268697600,,460,7.142857142857143
