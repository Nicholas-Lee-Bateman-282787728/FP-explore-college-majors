8590086,5,B00005LAF0,"This is a real find for people who are looking for good, common-sense workout advice. The Mr. Trainer videos -- and the web site that goes with them --  offer the same great, hands-on advice you'd get from having your own personal trainer, along with examples of what NOT to do. I would highly recommend this video for people who want to get started on a workout regimen and can't afford a trainer, or people who travel a lot and want a ""trainer"" who can travel with them. Very easy to follow instructions, and a great value for the price.",997056000,7,539,4.39
