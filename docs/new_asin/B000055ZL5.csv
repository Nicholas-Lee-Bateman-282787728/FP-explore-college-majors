7931430,5,B000055ZL5,"I bought the series on a whim as I was intrigued by the body armor.  I was pleasently surprised that this one snags you much in the way Evangelion does.  Slapstick comedy at the beginning and then once snared.. the storyline reveals the true line involved.  A must see, and with a very good opening theme song... I recommend this to all.  It has elements of GUYVER, EVANGELION and the same humor as NADESICO.",994809600,,408,4.472972972972973
7931431,4,B000055ZL5,"Generator Gawl has all the makings of a great series.  It is a perfect blend of  comedy, drama, romence, action, and intrigue.  Most of all though you began to care more and more about the characters involved. In Generator Gawl Vol. 3 Secrets and Lies, the viewer learns more and more about Gawl and his friends, plus there is some great forshadowing.  Overall this volume got me looking forward to the fourth and finall Generator Gawl, Out of Time.  My only complaint is if your an avid animation fan you need to buy the DVD because the diffenrence between the dubbed version and subtitle version is vast.  Instead of changing a line here and there, the people who did the dubbed version pretty much changed all the dialogue.  One can watch both the dubbed and the subtitle and feel like its totally 2 diffent movies.",986688000,3,818,4.6
