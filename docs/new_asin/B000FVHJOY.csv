2591864,5,B000FVHJOY,"Delivery was quick. Product was as expected. The lessons left a lot of unanswered question because they didn't explain the ""whys"" of the techniques as well as I would have liked.",1325548800,,178,4.774193548387097
2591865,4,B000FVHJOY,I have been playing guitar a while and bought this not knowing what to expect.  A very thorough hands on presentation. I got a lot of good ideas from this. I thought it was pretty challenging and a worthwhile purchase.,1315699200,2,218,4.45
2591866,2,B000FVHJOY,"I'll start by telling you I have been playing guitar for 30+ years. Why do I buy begining instruction books/DVDs. Well I am humble enough to realize that there is always more to learn. Every guitar player has there own individual style and I almost always find something new in these books/dvds. Not so in this book. It is virtually void of any style at all. The instructor shows a minimum of scales and tries to build around them (as all begining books/DVDs), and only this. It never gets into cord progressions, turn arounds or the such. At least I didn't see any of these. I admit I was so bored after the first half hour of skimming each section I gave up on it. I will say this DVD is only for a absolute complete beginner. If you can play anything at all Stay Clear.

O.K.  24 hours later:  I worked my way through the whole DVD and now I need to give Charles Sedlak the credit he deserves. This is a well layed out instructional DVD for the beginner. The 12 bar blues and licks at the end are a good start for any begining guitar student. I still feel that to much time is aloted to some rather simple and boring techniques that you could learn in a jam session in 2 seconds. For a absolute novice though it is very good instruction. There is alot to be learned here if you are just starting out and he does a good job presenting it. I apologize if I was to harsh at first. It was just more basic than I expected. However very good for the starting guitarist.  :)",1315440000,12,1470,4.202127659574468
2591867,5,B000FVHJOY,I have been having so much fun playing along with this DVD. Every lesson is slowed down so you can really get your fingers around it and understand what is going on. It's great to learn several different blues rhythm patterns and then go through and ad a ton of lead licks and phrases to spice things up. The lead licks are definitely my favorite. This has been the most enjoyable instructional DVD I have used so far. If you are interested in learning how to play some cool blues guitar I can't think of a better place to start. Have fun~,1194220800,25,539,4.294117647058823
8127172,3,B000FVHJOY,"Being a brand new beginning guitar student, I found the dvd to be a little too fast. Maybe if he had a chart to show finger positions with the dvd it would really help.",1506556800,,168,3.9705882352941178

8127174,5,B000FVHJOY,"I'm happy.  Started with ""Honky Tonk"" good song, easy to learn.  Good for a beginner like me and I can build from there.  Great classic that motivates to learn more.",1482537600,,165,4.433333333333334

8127176,5,B000FVHJOY,As a almost day one beginner I'm liking the instruction better than I hoped. I'm already playing the 1st lesson at full speed. This is a perfect beginner class for new players. Very clear instruction with gradual speed up until you're playing along. Lots of extras with the supplied password for the web site like tab charts and multiple instrument audio files for play along practice. I've tried two books and one other DVD and this is the best so far imo. It gets you playing riffs you can recognize as blues right away rather than just chords and fretting practice.,1473811200,,568,4.633663366336633
