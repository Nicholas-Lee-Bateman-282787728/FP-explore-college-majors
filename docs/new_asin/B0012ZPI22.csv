3101215,3,B0012ZPI22,"Most importantly, I'm a huge - huge fan of Mark Lenard (aka Sarek of Star Trek fame).  So, to find a movie where Mark Lenard is the leading star...well...I thought I'd struck gold.  While the script was fair, the director was either non-existent or extremely incapable of drawing out even mediocre efforts from the actors.  I had the feeling that Mr. Lenard was told to ""act cool"" when he's much better at acting ""strong"".  They underplayed him terribly.  The visual images on the film are far from crisp...probably a copy of a copy of a copy?  Out of respect for Mr. Lenard, I'm giving this 3 stars - most of you would probably give it fewer stars.",1400025600,2,649,4.504273504273504
3101216,3,B0012ZPI22,Enjoyed watching familiar landscapes I grew up from.  Story line and acting is so okay for the time it was made.  Dramatic and action movies have gone a long way these days.,1396569600,,173,4.375
3101217,3,B0012ZPI22,"It took me back to the 70's.  It was predictable.  Some of the acting was over the top, but I am a John Russell fan so I liked seeing him in an action film.  Don't expect too much.",1372291200,2,180,3.6842105263157894

8248641,2,B0012ZPI22,"I really wanted to like this. I just visited the submarine USS Razorback, which is now a museum ship on permanent display in Little Rock, Arkansas (sidenote: it was one of the dozen submarines that sailed into Tokyo Harbor for the signing of the papers that ended WW II). It was used in the filming of the submarine exterior scenes in the film just before it was sold to the Turkish navy. It was later purchased by the City of North Little Rock and relocated to the Arkansas River, even though ""Razorback"" was a kind of fish and did not refer to the University of Arkansas football team. But Robert Johnson's famous blues anthem ""Sweet Home Chicago"" was not about the Windy City, but about Port Chicago, California, where his brother was stationed in US Navy, hence the line, ""I'm going back to California, to Sweet Home Chicago,"" a line that has generated much confusion in the city that I lived for 32 years.

All the things that I just wrote in that paragraph, which are at best perhaps a tiny bit interesting when lined up one after another like that, are more interesting than anything that happens in this movie. Yes, it it that bad. In fact, the only interesting bit in the movie, for me, is the presence of our local submarine. So unless you really feel the need to see a Balao Class submarine that still very much exists, pass on this one. I would  bet that none of the actors were paid.",1489190400,,1396,4.44921875

8248644,2,B0012ZPI22,"I wanted to like this movie, the first feature film made on Guam.  I was in basic training with one of Guam's game wardens (just two at that time) and always wished I had the money and time to visit the island.  The scenery was very nice but the movie offers little else.",1448755200,2,271,4.09433962264151
8248645,4,B0012ZPI22,"If you like old war movies and the actors you'll like NOON SUNDAY.  Keep in mind this was filmed in 1970 on a $25,000 budget.  It doesn't compare to the quality and budgets in films made by  today's standard. However, you'll be entrained by the predictable lines and the beautiful raw scenery Guam has to offer. If you're  familiar with the island you'll enjoy recognizing familiar sights.",1445472000,2,389,4.7611940298507465
