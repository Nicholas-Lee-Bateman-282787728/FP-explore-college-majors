8161033,3,B000LC4Y5Y,"Standard B martial arts film.  Dean Cain, who plays the villain, is the best part of the movie.  Max Havoc, played by Mickey Hardt, is a former kick boxer who is now a high caliber photographer who has arrived at a top of the line resort to do a photo shot of a world class tennis player.
Christina Cox is the tennis player who had quit a few years ago but is making a big comeback and is really popular.  The storyline is weak and the photography is too dark in a lot of the scenes.  Martial arts fans might like this.  I would probably have given this a two star, but Dean Cain does a very good bad guy and blond too!",1410998400,,619,4.0
8161034,2,B000LC4Y5Y,"I am a huge Dean Cain fan and even I have to say that this movie was terrible. Dean is the only shining light in this movie and they don't use him in enough scenes to save it. The love story between Christina Cox and Max Havoc is totally unbelievable and happens way too quickly. The acting by Mickey Hardt as Max Havoc is bad and his range of emotions is non-existent. The setting for most of the movie is very dark and they made poor Rae Dawn Chong look horrible as a nun who heads the mission in town. The best scenes involve Dean Cain, but he probably should have been cast as the hero, then maybe it would have been better. He is the only reason I'm giving this movie 2 stars. It's not his fault, he didn't write the movie, and he did the best he could with his part. One of his best scenes to look out for is the big fight scene at the end.",1364601600,,846,3.9823529411764707

Dean Cain is an amazing handsome man, and a great actor! Dean and Teri- best TV couple!",1302739200,,217,4.166666666666667
