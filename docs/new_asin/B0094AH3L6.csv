8535702,1,B0094AH3L6,Don't waste your money. It's a modern production. Trash.,1492646400,,56,5.333333333333333
8535703,5,B0094AH3L6,"Great music, complicated story. A nice production with a lot of drama into it. Praises go to the stage director, Marina Bianchi, and to Bruno Ciuli, who created the sets and costumes. The singers are very good. Leo Nucci, who sings the title role, has a long experience, and is very convincing. At times though, I find his voice to be a little worn (he was 68 the year the recording took place). Tamar Iveri (Amelia) is a powerful soprano, well suited to the role, but sometimes her vibrato is too prominent. These are small complaints, however. Altogether this is a strong performance which deserves no less than five stars. As usual though in this series the sound is a bit ""thin"", lacking in bass and ambience.",1442793600,,713,4.622047244094488
8535704,2,B0094AH3L6,"For C Major's 2010 Simon Boccanegra in the Tutto Verdi collection, Parma imported the stage set used in the 2007 Bologna production, giving that abstract but functional mise-en-sc&egrave;ne a two-thirds share of the three Boccanegras currently on Blu-ray. What worked so well in Bologna, however, doesn't have the same results in Parma.

In its technical aspects, the Tutto Verdi Blu-ray is inferior to Arthaus Musik's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Verdi-Simon-Boccanegra-Blu-ray/dp/B003T68VDK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Verdi: Simon Boccanegra [Blu-ray</a>] of the Bologna Boccanegra. The Parma video image doesn't look much, if any, better than a good DVD, and the camera work is inferior to that in Bologna. Plus, the sound is not as rich, partly because of poorer recording and partly because conductor Daniele Callegari doesn't elicit playing from his orchestra to match that of Michele Mariotti in Bologna. Although Giogio Gallione, the Bologna director, is credited with having designed the set, he has no involvement in the Parma production and is noticeable by his absence. This ""performance"" looks more like a rehearsal. In fact, too few rehearsals might have been the cause of the unfinished, occasionally sloppy look. When the mob breaks in on the Council Chamber, for example, the chorus members stand around as though they don't have a clue what they're supposed to be doing. Moreover, the Parma lighting -- used so well in Bologna to make the best advantage of the minimal props -- is weak, amateurish by comparison.

As for the singers, the one bright and shining star is tenor Francesco Meli, who outstrips Giuseppe Gipali in Bologna as Gabriele in the least important of the five principal roles. Also, soprano Tamar Iveri sings with sweetness and light and is better than merely adequate. Even if she's not as eye-catchingly voluptuous as Bologna's Carmen Giannattasio, Iveri's performance can't be faulted.

It's the men in the crucial heavyweight roles who disappoint. Veteran Leo Nucci, in his seventh Tutto Verdi appearance, scored a triumph as the Doge of Venice in I due Foscari but seems tired as the Doge of Genoa in Boccanegra. He falls back on stock gestures to get him through, and often the strain in his voice reveals he is forcing it, particularly in the big Council Scene. He lacks Roberto Frontali's stature in the Bologna production, and in this case, Frontali sings the role better. As but one example, in Act I's tender duet in which Boccanegra and Amelia realize they are father and daughter, Nucci maintains a forte level on his final high A of ""O, figlia,"" without scaling down to piano as written. That's not a deal breaker in itself; it just typifies the lack of attention to detail that runs through this whole show. Nucci has a lifetime of high-quality performances to his credit. This doesn't happen to be one of them.

Even with the same stage set, the two productions conclude with an entirely different feel. Although he knows he is dying from having been poisoned by Paolo, Nucci's reconciliation with Fiesco in Act III is routine. When he says he wants to breathe the blissful air of the open sky, the backdrop is raised to reveal a dark, black sea -- not the gentle light blue sea as it is in Bologna. Nucci stumbles around rather embarrassingly as he's failing, faces away from the audience -- instead of toward the audience, as Frontali does -- and dies with an expression of despair on his face, not with Frontali's radiant smile. It's a depressing ending, rather than an uplifting one.

Neither Roberto Scandiuzzi as Fiesco nor Simone Piazzola as the villain Paolo are the equals of their counterparts -- Giacomo Prestia and Marco Vratogna -- in Bologna. I don't see much about this Blu-ray to recommend, and I don't understand all the five-star reviews posted here. It's worth noting that for its 2013 Verdi Bicentennial Festival, Parma invited Frontali and Prestia from the Bologna production -- not Nucci and Scandiuzzi from this Boccanegra filmed in Parma -- to reprise their roles.

Although the Bologna Blu-ray is superior to Tutto Verdi's and is easy to recommend, an even better Boccanegra is the July 2010 DVD set from the Royal Opera House&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Verdi-Simon-Boccanegra/dp/B0043GN6XU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Verdi: Simon Boccanegra</a>&nbsp;with Placido Domingo as Boccanegra, Ferruccio Furlanetto as Fiesco, soprano Marina Poplavskaya, and tenor Joseph Calleja, conducted by Antonio Poppano. On two DVDs, its video and audio quality approach that of Blu-ray -- and might even outdo this one from Parma. The ROH performance certainly does.",1422835200,2,4721,5.347240915208614
8535705,5,B0094AH3L6,"LaScala and Rome generate most of the headlines, but the backbone, heart-and-soul and nervous system of opera in Italy is in the regional houses like Teatro Regio di Parma. This is an altogether brilliant performance of Verdi's umber masterpiece, led by the great Leo Nucci as the title character. Conductor Daniele Callegari calls to mind a young Tullio Serafin as he leads an accomplished, on point orchestra. All the singing actors are first-rate, the production by Giorgio Gallioni is authentic and devoid of mannerisms, and the video production by Tiziano Mancini is wonderful. I will make it my business to collect the ""Tutto Verdi"" collection as my preferred vehicles for Verdi's works.",1421107200,,693,5.196428571428571
8535706,5,B0094AH3L6,"I have over 150 classical DVD/BRs that I watch on a 106"" screen and listen through a 7.1 loudspeaker setup where the front speakers are about 9' 6"" apart and the surround speakers are on my sides. The room has sound treatments so I hear what's on the disc, not distorting reflections from the walls. My reviews concentrate on the surround audio, as you can pretty much judge the video and stereo for yourself on youtube and similar sites.

My collection includes the1995 Met performance with Domingo and Te Kanawa. It is a 4:3 DVD and although it has a DTS 5.1 sound track, I thought it was time to replace it with a Blu-ray.

Picture is fine.

Sound is DTS-HD MA 5.1 (or PCM stereo). The sound stage is not as wide as in some other recordings, about halfway to the surrounds. Orchestra is quite detailed and well recorded.
Balance with chorus is very good, it favors the principals a tad. If you like to hear the singing as clear as possible, this is it. Voices are recorded with body mics and come through the center only, my only complaint.
As soon as the music started, I was sold on that recording. Beautiful sound. All voices clear as a bell. Beautifully done.
As usual, I had started listening with my eyes closed, but once I opened them, it became immediately clear what contributed to this beautiful sound: The staging!
The floor is at a slight angle raised from the stage itself and looks like a cobblestone mosaic. It probably is not stone, but either way, the reflections will just peter out on that floor. The walls behind are all broken up with angles and gaps, nothing will give a bad reflection. The stage microphones are raised a bit more than usual of the ground and pointed towards where the singers stand most of the time.
I would like to think that the staging was done with the desire to achieve good sound and not just accidental and the science of good sound will be incorporated in every staging. This is the opposite of  Mose in Egitto, where the staging is so detrimental to the sound.
While I wished for a bit wider sound stage and the voices not just from the center, I'll still give it 5 stars for the overall very good sound.

As for the performance, it is a bit static, but it is well sung by all principals with voices that are pleasing to my ear. It certainly is a good replacement for that 1995 Met performance.",1390262400,2,2346,4.433874709976799
8535707,5,B0094AH3L6,"l still have my cd recording of ""Simon Boccanegra"" with the golden-voiced Piero Cappuccilli as the Doge and the equally golden-voiced Jose van Dam as Paolo; Claudio Abbado conducts expertly, pacing the action so that the big scenes like the great Council scene can flourish. When I ordered this version, I did not think it could possibly match the older recording. But I have been pleasantly surprised and very gratified that this version from the Tutto Verdi series is a moving and powerful experience. First, Leo Nucci as a singer and actor deserves much of the credit for the impact of the performance. He plays Simon as a very old and weary Doge, worn down by his responsibilities and probably the many compromises his position has forced him to make. His sadness is palpable in scene after scene, and the mystique of power has long ago evaporated. This makes his joy at finding his daughter so rapturous; we feel he deserves this happiness, he has earned it as a just and generous ruler. This also makes his death unbearably poignant in the opera's closing moments. Leo Nucci makes you feel this . . . The other members of the cast are an amazing revelation of great singing! The tenor Francesco Meli fully deserves the swelling applause he receives at his curtain call: what a beautiful and controlled voice, he sings with passion and youthful energy and never produces anything but rich, mellow tones. What a career he has before him! I assumed that Mirella Freni from the Abbado recording would forever be my Amelia.  But I am stunned by the young soprano Tamar Iveri; her voice is so flexible she can sing every scene with exactly the tone, coloring and volume it requires. Her expressions reveal the pure soul within and she moves gracefully, with just the right gestures showing her emotions. And her voice is truly that of a Verdian soprano. I first heard Mirella Freni as Zerlina in ""Don Giovanni"" and was amazed how she grew in stature as Tosca, Madama Butterfly, Tatyana in ""Eugene Onegin"" as well as Verdi roles. I am confident that Tamar Iveri will have an equally illustrious career based on this peerless performance. As Jacopo Roberto Scandiuzzi underwhelmed me in the first act, but by the last act he was fully in character and voice. And what powerful, full-voiced singing he produced as he appears first as Simon's assassin and then, when he learns the truth about Simon and Amelia, his sudden friend and comforter. I have always considered ""Simon Boccanegra"" one of Verdi's masterpieces since hearing another great singer, Sherill Milnes, sing the role in Metropolitan performances. That means I have been exhilarated, moved and drained by this powerful tragedy for over forty years. If this opera is also one of your favorites, you have a wonderful new version to savor.",1387152000,3,2796,4.837160751565762
8535708,5,B0094AH3L6,"Simon Boccanegra is a dark drama of low male voices with only a few rays of lighter tenor and soprano. It originated in 1857 and was substantially revised in 1881. The music is profound and deep. But it can be jarring as it swirls along with mature Verdi artistry and suddenly there is a passage from the 1850s. What a difference! It is still a favorite and I have followed it for more than sixty years. My first Simon was Leonard Warren and Leo Nucci is the latest. I've heard some great performances e.g. Vladimir Chernov with the Met in 1995(with the greatest Fiesco of all time and time to come - Robert Lloyd).  I've also heard some pretty bad ones. But even in those there is something to be gained just from listening to Verdi's extraordinary music. Yes you can hear the waves and smell the Ligurian Sea or define what the characters are thinking in that extraordinary music.
As an overall effort I think this present disc is an excellent production. The singing on the whole is absolutely top rate. The amazing Leo Nucci has done it again. From his first run-in with Fiesco in the prologue to his final gasp at the end of Act 3 he is the center of attention. His voice is still respondant to the demands of the drama. Another great job of singing was that of Simone Piazzola as Paolo. His big resonant voice has graced several recordings as of late and he gets better and better; he even acted well in this one. The Amelia/Maria of Tomar Iveri was almost ideal. She looked the part of a noble waif of elegant demeanor and she has a big, lush, well rounded voice that can float a note when needed or fill an auditoriun whe aroused. Another one that looked the part was Francesco Meli He has a nice, well controlled, pleasing tenor voice and he is young and handsome. So many singers that try this part a barrel-chested, badly overweight, past prime has beens (remind you of anyone?). Another excellent deep voiced basso, beautiful to listen to, was that of Robert Scandiuzzi. What a pleasure to revel in that beautiful sound. I only he could learn to act.
The costumes were beautiful. The sets initially were interesting; certainly better than the Wiener Staatsoper's bare scaffolding and nothingness in their 2002 release with Thomas Hampson. But I'm old fashioned; from the '40s to the '90s when you went to the opera there was something magical in being transported back in time and place to the setting as the composer visualized it. The grand hall of the council chamber was a replica of that hall in the time of the 14th century when the drama took place in the recording done in 1995 Met production under James Levine with Chernov and R. Lloyd. Wow! It was great. There is no magic in a raked slab on stage and a meaningles pile of painted boxes. Eurotrash!
n.b As Simon Boccanegra is based on an historical incident, some years ago I went to Genoa to see If I could find any places of the settings. I could find no trace of the Boccanegra palace but I did find a bronze plaque indicating the place of the Fieschi. It is now aprking lot for a department store. The local museum has reconstructed the Grand Council Chamber and it's paintings. Beautiful!",1384214400,2,3166,4.525305410122164
8535709,5,B0094AH3L6,"This is a magnificent Boccanegra. One of the best I've ever heard. Mainly because it's Italian through and through and they understand this drama perfectly. Many muddled productions I have seen and this is where to story comes out best and most authentic.

Leo Nucci is the perfect incarnation of the hero. The voice... the persona... the authority....(witness the council Chamber scene, it will nail you to your seat.) .. the emotion..... the pathos. Tamar Iveri grows stature in the role, maturing as the work progresses. Francesco Meli a glorious tenor, young, powerful, sensitive. Paolo Pecchioli as Albiani is much younger than in many former interpretations and his character is more three dimensional and easier to understand. I find Fiesco of Roberto Scianduzzi the least successful here, but he grows with the drama and his voice becomes very powerful by the 2nd and 3rd acts. Daniele Calligari is certainly one of the top conductors in this series. He finds much added richness in the score, his pacing is impeccable and so are his tempi. Overall effect is cumulative and overwhelming.

I feel sorry for a certain reviewer who thinks it is ""underwhelming"", if I may be permitted to argue with someone who pictures himself as prime reviewer, but his credibility has been compromised before. If you follow his advice and ignore this set you are making a mistake.",1375747200,6,1370,5.004385964912281
8535710,5,B0094AH3L6,"Good show, great singers and nice performance.
Nucci good singer and good actor.
Iveri one of the best Amelia.
Meli and Scandiuzzi at the best",1369440000,2,142,4.72
8535711,4,B0094AH3L6,"The cast is great, the staging and costumes traditional, yet for some reason this production doesn't take off.

Francesco Meli scores the biggest success with the audience as Gabriele Adorno - sweet timbre, passion and ardor tempered with grace, ringing top, reserves of power - very impressive. Nucci as Simon Boccanegra is his usual self. I initially experienced some Nucci fatigue (this is Tutto Verdi or Tutto Nucci?). He forces a lot and it doesn't help to watch on video the physical efforts of this forcing, but the beauty of his style, phrasing, finesse and variety of shading win you over.  Tamar Iveri is among the best I've heard in the role of Amelia and Simone Piazzola's Paolo is incisive, with a clean and secure delivery.  Roberto Scandiuzzi as Paolo is noble enough but he doesn't have the goods for ""Il lacerato spirito"". It's interesting that in the disc's introduction it is mentioned that Verdi commented that the singer needs a voice of steel for this Romanza, exactly what Scandiuzzi lacks. I heard him a few years earlier in Vienna and he was no better. All singers articulate and project clearly. The conductor is adequate, not bad enough to explain why this doesn't work as well as it should.

It's not easy to point out why this production does not have an impact. I think the staging stands in the way of the drama. It opened in Genoa in 2007 without any great success. There is a blu-ray from that (same) production with Frontali and it's the same story there - good cast, yet it doesn't add up. The staging is not intrusive, but the stage is cluttered and devoid of any grandeur. This opera does not work without grandeur. Video and sound are excellent. This was taped in 2010.",1363824000,2,1707,4.68
