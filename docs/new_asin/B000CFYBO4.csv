8477999,2,B000CFYBO4,"An updated, superior version of this classic educational video is available on Amazon, renamed for schools as THE TRUTH ABOUT TOBACCO. The later edition has new film, graphics and current statistics added, but most important, images of e-cigarettes, which increased by 500% among teens between 2011 and 2015.

The powerful talking sections by Patrick Reynolds overlap in both videos, and are the heart of this DVD, but the newer edition is the one to buy, and will be more effective with your kids. This older version has three outdated TV spots which may make your kids laugh. These are replaced in the new edition with three slick, powerful PSA's that your kids will connect with.

That and the other updates are why THE TRUTH ABOUT TOBACCO is the version of this classic video to get. It's also licensed for showing in schools, while this older version is labeled, ""For Home Use Only. Not for showing in schools.""

8478000,5,B000CFYBO4,This video really helped kids see the harmful effects of smoking.  It was however a little out-dated for 2010.  More pictures of waht smokers can look like would have been nice.  Overall the material was helpful and a message that ALL kids need to here.,1264982400,4,253,4.5777777777777775
