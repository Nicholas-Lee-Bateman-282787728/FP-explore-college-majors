8594315,4,B0000AKCKZ,"Max and Dave Fleischer started their cartoon studios on Broadway, in NYC, in 1921. In their 21 year run, the Fleischers created Koko the Clown, Popeye the Sailor and Betty Boop. They were also the first to animate the Superman comic book character. These Superman shorts are widely considered the brothers' most intricate work.

The innovative Max Fleischer invented rotoscope, which was a method of animating live action figures. Fleischer Studios issued cartoons with synchronized sound in 1924, a full three years before Warner Bros. and Vitaphone released the first ""talking picture,"" ""The Jazz Singer.""

The Fleischers' long-standing distribution deal with Paramount turned out to be costly. Following financial difficulties after their relocation to Miami, the brothers were eventually forced to turn over studio operations to Paramount. At that time, the cartoon division was renamed Famous Studios.

BETTY BOOP, originally a supporting player in the Bimbo cartoons, proved so popular she was given her own series. Mae Questal's vocal characterization of Betty was based on Helen Kane, a singer known as ""The Boop-oop-a-doop Girl.""

GABBY first appeared in Fleischer's full-length feature, ""Gulliver's Travels,"" as the nosy, noisy,  know-it-all town crier. This character's voice was supplied by Pinto Colvig, who also portrayed Goofy in Disney 'toons. Eight Gabby cartoons were made in 1940 and '41. In these, he continued his interfering ways, which often led to disastrous results.
