3774591,5,B001RCTJ0C,"I met Helge Pedersen shortly after his ""10 years on 2 wheels"" stint and whilst doing the book tour. This stands up to his calm demeanor and gives the viewer an excellent and honest perspective of the trip.

  Cheers.",1368921600,,216,4.487179487179487
3774592,5,B001RCTJ0C,These Globeriders videos are a treat to watch if you are a true motorcycle tourer or at least a sincere wannabee. Good fun especially if you dream of world traveling on a motorcycle or paying for one of the many organized Travel expeditions.,1363478400,,241,4.627906976744186
3774593,3,B001RCTJ0C,I love motorcycle rides so this is good but does not have the riding in as much detailed as i would have expected.,1360454400,,114,4.0
3774594,5,B001RCTJ0C,Globe Riders in Iceland .I wish I could find more Videos . I am a bike rider and I feel like I am right there with them,1358121600,,119,3.4444444444444446
3774595,4,B001RCTJ0C,"Interesting video featuring travel information about Iceland and tips on riding the rough roads and tracks on two wheels. These are combined into a program that shows how much fun the Iceland tour can be. Watch as the guys cross rivers up to their BMW motorcycle gas tanks, and later relax in natural hot tubs at their campsites by the road.",1349913600,,341,4.60655737704918
3774596,4,B001RCTJ0C,.. well done travelogue ... great scenery .... beautiful wildness ... wish i were there!,1444176000,,88,4.933333333333334

3774598,4,B001RCTJ0C,"As good as the motorcycling is here the ultimate highlight is the stunning country of Iceland. Unlike some other GlobeRiders docs this one features a perfect balance of time spent focusing on being motorcycle riders and being tourists. I also appreciated that there were only two riders (well, three with cameraman Noren but like most of these docs he is only shown infrequently), because we didn't have to endure the camera frantically giving time to each of a large group of riders (this is my main complain on some subsequent GlobeRiders docs). Both Pederson and Poland are mellow guys, certainly guys I'd want to ride with.",1431734400,,627,4.9245283018867925
3774599,5,B001RCTJ0C,Wish I'd have seen this before I spent 10 days riding Iceland in 2013.  A well done video!,1429833600,,90,4.0
3774600,2,B001RCTJ0C,A very amateurish endeavor,1429315200,,26,5.75
3774601,5,B001RCTJ0C,Mr. Pedersen provides a rare glimpse into a beautiful often overlooked country which can only be appreciated by motorcycle.,1427673600,,123,5.526315789473684
3774602,3,B001RCTJ0C,"Interesting ride and beautiful scenery, but the guy who narrates this is difficult to understand at times and I had to enable subtitles.  I didn't enjoy this one as much as the Indochina expedition.",1420329600,,198,4.823529411764706
3774603,4,B001RCTJ0C,Great video.  Enjoyed seeing a different country and points of view on a hobby I enjoy greatly.,1419984000,,95,4.588235294117647
3774604,5,B001RCTJ0C,I really loved this video of a motorcycle trip around Iceland. I would love to go back to iceland and do what these guys did.,1418342400,,125,4.04
3774605,5,B001RCTJ0C,"This movie ROCKED!  Motorcycling was a big part of my life for many years until I realized that I needed to drop weight so I reverted back to another past time: cycling.  This movie captures everything I loved about riding a BMW GS: Adventure!  You go places you never thought you would go, you meet all sorts of really cool people, and your learn significant history all in a motorcycle ride.  Man, this movie captures the love of adventure riding.  It made me want to go out and buy another motorcycle..... :-D",1417219200,,512,4.521739130434782
3774606,3,B001RCTJ0C,The scenery was better than the acting.,1408060800,,39,4.714285714285714
3774607,5,B001RCTJ0C,Great motorcycle road trip movie,1405296000,,32,5.6
3774608,4,B001RCTJ0C,Nice trip around Iceland with some well known adventurers.  Good exposure of scenery and what to expect on the back roads.  A good documentary.,1402012800,,143,4.916666666666667
3774609,5,B001RCTJ0C,"this is NOT the typical ""stick a GoPro camera on your helmet and your a video producer like I see a lot now.
These two guys had a cameraman with them who took the video for their adventure.  It's the only way to get real shots and edit out the garbage.  This was professionally done, realistic, and a joy to watch. The scenery was fully described, and in their professional manner, it seemed like you were along for the trip.  I've watched some of their other videos, and it's evident that they took a lot of time and effort in shooting them. If your not a poser and dare to take the road unknown for the adventure rather then worrying if you'll scratch your paint, then this is an adventure you'll enjoy and wish you had gone along. They defiantly got adventure in their blood.  I loved it.",1400716800,2,791,4.324324324324325
3774610,5,B001RCTJ0C,"This was a great surprise! Not sure what to expect, I wasn't sure if I really wanted to watch it. I am really glad I did. Beautiful photography and interesting dialog. After watching it I found 3 other GlobeRiders videos that I added to my watch list.",1397865600,,251,4.361702127659575
3774611,4,B001RCTJ0C,Enjoyed the scenes and photography very much.  I Wish I could have tagged along.  Beautiful country in the summer months.,1397088000,,121,5.0
3774612,5,B001RCTJ0C,I had just planned on taking a quick look and ended up sitting through the whole hour without really realizing it.  What an engaging and FUN little video - I'll be looking for more from GlobeRiders - awesome!,1396742400,,208,4.473684210526316
3774613,4,B001RCTJ0C,"So while I really liked the adventure, IMO, it didn't live up to the standard set by other videos in the GlobeRiders series.",1389657600,,124,4.434782608695652
3774614,5,B001RCTJ0C,"This documentary involves motorcycling, a sport I enjoy. Along with that I got to see a beautiful country and scenes that made the film most enjoyable.",1385164800,,151,4.846153846153846
3774615,5,B001RCTJ0C,This vid shows the ups and downs of traveling tthrough a forigen country on a motorcycle. No one is cracking dumb jokes all the time and most important the riders didn't get their bikes and gear for free because they are movie stars! Plus you get a free lesson on how to straighten bent handlebars in the middle of nowhere.,1380412800,,323,4.4

8337687,4,B001RCTJ0C,"Having spent two years in Iceland, i know what these guys experienced. Not that I did what they did, but I know the environment.  Nice footage and informative, but it lacked somewhere but I can't say where. I think there needed to be more of something.  I'd watch it again.",1486166400,,273,4.44
8337688,5,B001RCTJ0C,"Great documentary!  I lived in Iceland for two years back in the 80's when I was in the military.  Brought back lots of good memories about this beautiful country, people and natural terrain.  Wish I had a Beamer back then.  I would have loved to have seen the remote part of the island.  Who knows maybe this will inspire me to return some day.  Kind of difficult since I live on the island of Hawaii now (Hilo).",1474934400,,413,4.298701298701299
