I was laughing when Fritz's Old Lday was bitching him out. Both DVDs are Animated. The Graphic are pretty good.",1395100800,,277,3.9642857142857144

8195191,5,B000Q920G2,The DVD got here well wrapped and shipped in a timely fashion. One issue I have was one of the DVDs had a three dollar price sticker and I payed $27.00. If someone is going sell something at such a mark up they should take the cheaper price tag..... So we don't feel dumb for paying such a high mark up,1347580800,,302,3.9672131147540983
8195192,5,B000Q920G2,It had been years since I had seen these movies. Once my friend and I sat down and watch it; we started laughing at it again..A true animated classic for adults.,1247529600,5,161,4.225806451612903
8195193,4,B000Q920G2,"I bought this duo because I was curious about Mr. Bakshi's newest feature. I was disappointed with the second feature. Its workmanship was cheesey and it was made without the feeling put into the original film. It reminds me of the magic in the first Tim Allen ""Santa Clause"" film and the crap that the second and third movie produced. We live in a greedy society and true art often is the victim of greed. Buy this for the first movie if you do not already own it. If not, wait for the blu-ray version. The first movie is a masterpiece, the second is just plain crap.",1207440000,8,568,4.317757009345795
