7000583,4,B00T5DYTSC,I enjoyed this film. It's a film about relationships. The themes of fidelity and forgiveness are explored. This is a good date movie. It will promote discussion about love and marriage. This film would be rated PG. It's a clean family film.,1425513600,,240,4.738095238095238

7000587,5,B00T5DYTSC,"In a time when the failures of marriages are being used to fuel the agenda of some...
It is refreshing to see expressed so wonderfully, that there has never been anything wrong with marriage.
Which is by its eternal definition, ""A sacred union between a man and a woman, instituted and honored by GOD.
It's just people, and the expectations that were built on a fantasy, the assumed healing of their childhood disappointments
and ""Bad advice."" Some advice we gave ourselves.
  Great Job... Great Movie...",1455062400,,504,4.91764705882353

7000591,5,B00T5DYTSC,Starts a little slow but builds to a really good storyline. The two main characters play well off of each other and the finale is great!! Excellent look at marriage and work related conflicts of interest.,1439856000,,204,4.694444444444445

7000596,5,B00T5DYTSC,Simply an amazing story of TRUE LOVE and FORGIVENESS.  I am always looking at movies to see what message GOD is showing and it was clear in this movie.  Reminds me of the scripture 1 Corinthians chapter 13.  Loving the Meet the Browns reunion.,1437004800,,243,4.4772727272727275

7000601,2,B00T5DYTSC,"This is another film coming out of Atlanta, the African-American Hollywood. This film is about ""the relationship"" and just the relationship to the point of squeezing out any entertainment value. Sebastian (Lamman Rucker) and Ryan (Denise Boutte) are marriage councilors with their own TV show and book deal. They are making big money, although I don't see where they spend it. Sebastian had an affair 2 years ago and Ryan hasn't forgiven him, in spite of what she says. They are living separate under the same roof, pretending to be America's happiest couple. Both have their own confidants to talk to and seek advice.

The film also looks at the relationships and problems of at least a half dozen other couples, so if relationships are your thing, this is your film. I needed something more than 90 minutes dedicated to a rocky marriage that I know how it ends.

Guide: Made for TV production. No swearing, sex, or nudity.",1431820800,,924,4.80503144654088

8700356,3,B00T5DYTSC,"Almost a 4 star, but not really, so I gave it a 3. Reason is because, it could've been deeper, and more meaningful. I am an actual marriage counselor.  The two things mentioned, but stressed too little were prayer - an seemingly random point made one day after the show was brought up, but only two simple sceens about  inconspicuous prayer. Seemed too shallow. If more of the need for God in marriage to weather the storms I would've given a higher rating. This movie will have all over the board ratings, because it needed more thought through and powerful meaning.  Overall, great to watch gorgeous, quality african american actors - the leads were great - included actress who played the sister and producer. Acting was good, and the film was quality. I paid for this movie to rent, but won't watch again. I wanted more information sooner than it was delivered in the movie - like what happened between them fully.",1504483200,2,918,4.654320987654321
