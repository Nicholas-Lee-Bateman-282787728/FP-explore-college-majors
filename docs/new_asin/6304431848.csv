While the acting was good, the story was terrible. I don't mind violence in a movie, but this was ridiculous, gratuitous violence that added little.",1514505600,,291,4.615384615384615

882328,5,6304431848,"This is both one of my most loved and hated films.
I love it because of the uncompromising nature of the depiction - it's raw, and ultra violent and very,very real. Russell Crowe showed he is a fine and gifted actor in this movie. Hando is smart, utterly evil, a manipulator and a power hungry monster without boundaries. Crow's portrayal shocks and draws you in.
I also hate it because what is shows - it shows the ugliest side of human nature, and the way the neo-Nazi movement preys on the young and vulnerable, in much of the same way that gang affiliation does. The film is supposed to show how poverty breeds movements like neo-Nazism, and that our youth must be protected against these ideologies.
 However, Amazon has released this film at a very unfortunate time, when there is a surge in Neo-Nazism and white nationalists and alt-right will no doubt make a fictional hero out of Hando, and lionize him within their sick culture.
This is a great film, but I don't think it is the right time to promote it.",1514160000,,1014,4.540983606557377

It's about philosophy. Hando (Russell Crowe) wanted to live in the past by adhering to the Nazi mantra of the Master race. Davey (Daniel Pollock) had a dream. One with a very different future. A future of hope, happiness and unrealized ambitions that were cultivated by the inception of Gabe (Jacqueline McKenzie). Her presence created a conflicting wedge that helped divide Hando and Davey. It's this conflict which fuels the film to it's climactic ending. Brilliant screenplay, casting, cinematography, editing and music score. A totally underrated film.

882961,5,6304431848,"Romper Stomper is actually a fairly new addition to my ""absolute favorites"" in film.  I got interested in this movie when I saw the trailer for it on one of the public computers in college, and after watching it, quickly bought a copy on the internet just because it looked so gritty and uncompromising.  As the title says above, it shows you don't need super confusing storylines and multimillion dollar special effects to make a great movie.  All you need is believable characters living believable lives and acting out believable situations.

STORY

Romper Stomper focuses on a gang of neo-Nazis in Footscray, a suburb of Melbourne, Australia. Leading the gang is Hando (Russell Crowe) and his right-hand man is Davey (Daniel Pollock), where they lead brutal street attacks against the growing Vietnamese immigrants in their community, seeking to preserve the ""racial integrity"" of their community.  However, things start to change when a troubled, seizure-prone girl named Gabrielle (Jacqueline McKenzie) comes between Hando and Davey, and their friendship begins to splinter as the love triangle is formed.

CHARACTERS

This is one of Romper Stomper's best traits since the characters feel very real.  Since this movie focuses on a group of neo-Nazis, you see them as vile people, but not in a one-sided way that the politically correct folks in Hollywood would want you to see them as.  Even the characters that are there to ""push the story along,"" don't detriment the quality of the film since their believable personalities add to the quality of the film.  Of course, Hando and Davey are the stars in this arena.  Hando is the leader of the neo-Nazi gang and to me, is the most menacing neo-Nazi I've ever seen on film.  He's really maniacal when in street combat and has a grip over his subordinates as to where they not dare defy him.  Within the first several minutes, Hando and his cronies ambush a group of Vietnamese immigrants and Hando grabs one of them, and tells him ""I'm gonna tell you something, and I want you to listen to me.  This is NOT your country.""  Then proceeds to ruthlessly beat the helpless fellow.  Hando's appearance adds to his menacing personality since he's covered with Nazi tattoos and on his left arm, has the skeletal structure of his arm tattooed in black ink and it makes him look like he has claws on his hand as well. However, Hando isn't a one-sided maniac.  After the first night he spends with Gabrielle, he explains to her why he believes what he believes for pretty understandable reasons, particularly with how the Vietnamese immigrants are ""cheap labor,"" and renders a chunk of the white populace unemployed (though this doesn't justify his awful actions).  Davey is also an interesting character because while he believes in the Nazi ideology, he feels ostracized within Hando's gang and starts to feel that Gabrielle is his key out of that type of life.  A good example of Davey's doubts about the gang are shown in a party scene where all of his pals are getting drunk and beating each other while listening to racist punk rock; Davey breaks away from the mosh pit and pummels a punching bag.  Gabrielle shows some complexity because while she's a troubled ""sex kitten,"" she's had a troubled life with her mother's death and implications that her father has sexually abused her in the past.  Also, since these people aren't exactly ""good people,"" I'm glad that there's no quest for these people to redeem their morality because in reality, these people don't conveniently ""find the light"" towards the end of reality, adding another layer of realism to the experience.

LACK OF POLITICAL CORRECTNESS

Writer and director Geoffrey Wright did a bold move by taking a neutral stance to the characters' Nazi ideology.  Instead, Wright makes a gritty drama focusing on the decay of a group of violent hooligans who happen to be neo-Nazis.  I'm really glad that Wright didn't bash the audience over the head with a ""OMG!!  Racism is evil!!"" message like in American History X because I think most people old enough to watch this type of movie have enough cognitive capacity to make that decision for themselves.  Another aspect to the lack of political correctness is that Wright immerses the audience into the neo-Nazis' world, which I find pretty refreshing since not many films did that prior to Romper Stomper's release in 1992 (with an exception being Made in Britain, which came out in 1982), and that it's not common that you get to see why they think the way they do.  Partial spoilers ahead, what I love about this movie is that none of the characters break away from their racist beliefs at the end because in real life, hate-filled goons don't quickly change their ideology like in films such as Crash and the previously mentioned American History X.

APPEARANCE

It's pretty obvious that Romper Stomper is a low-budget film given how it looks.  The film was shot with that was probably either a small or standard low quality camera, which causes the picture quality to look pretty grainy and hazy.  I LOVE the picture quality in this movie because the visual grittiness adds a layer of uneasiness that's already present within the ultra-violent lives of the neo-Nazis.  Since many of the locations take place in abandoned car shops and warehouses, it adds another layer of uneasiness to the viewing experience by showing how rough these troublemakers have to live.

SOUNDTRACK

John Clifford White did a fantastic job writing the music for RS because it further immerses the viewer into the neo-Nazis' world.  The soundtrack itself is a mixture of racist punk rock and simplistic instrumentals.  The racist punk songs do a great job in really making you feel like you're in Hando's gang because not only for their racist messages, but also for the fact that they really sound like music played by a bunch of racists in someone's garage, though I think the instrumentals are the best part of the music.  Towards the psychotic end of the movie, there's a really creepy and psychedelic track with only the words ""Fourth Reich Fighting Men"" (taken from a racist punk song with the same title) being screamed in the background as the madness in the movie unravels.  The ending theme ""Dead Nazi March"" is a simple and dark instrumental tune that perfectly complements the movie.

ACTION SCENES

Romper Stomper isn't by any stretch an action film, but it has probably one of the most intense street fights I've ever seen in a movie.  After the Vietnamese immigrants get fed up with the neo-Nazis' ruthless actions, they retaliate.  When Hando and his cronies assault the sons of a Vietnamese businessmen who just bought the local bar (which was the skinheads' hangout area), dozens and dozens of Vietnamese people swarm the skinheads and raging battle ensues.  You see the skinheads and Vietnamese people stab, punch, and kick the snot out of each other.  A really intense part of the fight is when a skinhead downs and proceeds to repeatedly kicking a Vietnamese guy in the belly, two Vietnamese people on a motorbike knock the skinhead down and a bunch of others swarm the skinhead and beat him to death.  This makes the sparse street fights in Akira look like shorts from Sesame Street.

MATURE CONTENT

This is not a movie for the kids.  The previously stated street fights are really violent and this movie has some pretty intense (for not being x-rated) sex scenes between Hando and Gabrielle and later on, between Davey and Gabrielle.  However, the violence and sexual content aren't at all gratuitous because they add to the grittiness of the main characters' lives.

FINAL WORD

Romper Stomper really is an intense film and if you want THE skinhead movie, don't hesitate to watch RS one bit.  If you want more after this, check out Made in Britain as well.",1279670400,12,7818,4.855957767722473
882962,5,6304431848,"1990's skinhead movies vs. 2000+ skin films.
There aren't that many neo - nazi skinhead movies out as of present , and we need desperately a skinhead movie which takes on the modern Russian skinhead situation. The story revolves around a failed skinhead 'leader'who has no real leadership talents whatsoever - and who seeks to cover that up as desperately as possible , and winds out in the end being caught up in a serious fear of the police and the federal powers and the very forces of those he hates - Asian immigrants who have decided to flee from their homelands in search of homes in Australia , as a result of problem - reaction techniques generated by illuminists. The official explanation for most skinhead movements is that they are seperate movements which are in almost no way connected to the police or government operations or even freemasonry lodges. Truth be known , many of those movements have been created so that a 'something has to be done'call would be heard and people would in turn aggree upon limitations of rights and personal freedoms such as the freedom to decide where to walk and when and even how to walk. The way I look at Romper Stomper , it is actually two films - Romper Stomper I stars Russel Crowe and the other actors in the Romper Stomper movie who decide to express the phenomenon of 1990's skinhead culture as realistically and as brutally as they possibly can , succeeding at every effort to portray a non - politically correct , non - mainstream film which becomes one of Russel Crowe's all time greats and perhaps his greatest success on the screen. What I term 'the sequel', to Russel Crowe's Romper Stomper , is a very little known skinhead movement which has barely begun to grow today - and which is set to become known , quite simply , as Sinister Skins. It may perhaps be very probable that perhaps Russel Crowe ought to consider the possibility of creating a sequel to Romper Stomper which will focus heavily upon Sinister Skins and 2000's plus skinhead gangs , especially skinhead gangs in Russia and perhaps even Iceland , because it's only a matter of time before skinhead groups be formed in Iceland to combat the consequences of the banking collapse which will not be perceived to be immigrants.
A 21st century skinhead movie will also have to deal with the current discussion of an immigration phenomenon which has become very much talked about at so - called 'exopolitical summits'- extraterrestrial immigrants because future skinheads movements will very likely turn away from focusing on earthly immigrants and will go more into the bussiness of the much talked about extraterrestrial immigrants of today's exopolitical litterature (provided there is truth to most of the stories about extraterrestrials attempting to infiltrate our societies). Thus , unlike any other skinhead movie ever made , Romper Stomper is actually two films - it's own chronological 1990's version , and it's horrifying sequel - that of 2000+'s skinhead movements and the way of life and philosophy they will adapt into their cultures. Imagine what was to take place if tens of thousands of skinhead movements would arise suddenly out of nowhere with hardly any political background or special interest connection whatsoever , whose leaders will be far more capable and will be seriously determined to succeed at their aims towards successful leadership among their ranks and who will have learnt from such films as Romper Stomper on how to create highly spirited , highly numinous as opposed to highly racial skinhead movements. And not all skinhead groups are neo - nazi , of course. I seriously urge that a sequel be made of Romper Stomper which does not necessarily have to focus on any of the speculations that I have raised above. For example , such a sequel could instead be about skinheads who focus on Australian banksters or perhaps an altogether new skinhead story which may focus again on asian immigrants. My friend also saw this film two days ago and says that he felt mesmerized by the scene involving the Asian majority group who attacked the skinheads. He said he supported the Asians in the movie. I said that whereas the film as a fictious portrayal of skinhead violence was concerned , I supported the Australian skins. As of present it is perhaps possible to create skinhead movements which have both Australian , Asian and so on members to increase diversity within their ranks and to increase number. Being a skinhead is not a decision to be taken lightly.",1278547200,,4515,4.834625322997416

That is to say: scratch the surface of Russell Crowe's 'Romper Stomper' character, Hando - a deeply rotten, misguided Australian fascist - and you'll find another deeply rotten, misguided Australian fascist waiting for his turn with the knuckleduster.

Oh but Hando is a man of letters; a man for our time.
Only he and his cretinous, sheep mentality cohorts can see the end of the world - and it's approaching with slanty eyes, a wok full of money and the ignoble intention of de-Aryanising their blatantly bogus pure-blood world.

They respond magnificently: this is Rourke's Drift or the Bastille all over again. Restaged in dismal 90's Melbourne and played out with pool-cues, rice-flails, bottles and knives.
You can't help cheering. The violence (and let's be straight here; that alone is 'Romper Stomper's nub) doesn't half get that blood pumping. Better than a chemical jump-lead any time...

We begin with the brutal beating of 3 Vietnamese kids riding skateboards at a Lynchian hissing and steam-obscured railway station. A camera-eye view of their euphoric last ride - straight into Hando and his club (literally) of fine men and women who proceed to punch and kick them 'til they can't move anymore.
The bravery epitomised here is worthy of honours: those skateboarding Asian children appear an appalling threat to Aussie culture - particularly the sobbing girl - who gets held down by two gallant upholders of Melbourne's heritage, and punched in the face by another.
From here on in, most of the rest of 'Romper Stomper' is a running battle between the electrifying Crowe's skinhead platoon of the free, and the overwhelming, fierce, all-conquering Vietnamese invaders.

They skirmish with other insurgents along the way: a couple of gay hippies find the sharing of social airs-and-graces with Hando painfully futile; and inevitably the police, who simply love skinheads and start shooting them straight away.
The razors-edge climax sees Hando and his not-so-trusty fight-lieutenant Davy fight a sea-side showdown over a scatty, highly dangerous sex-kitten who's been playing them off against each other throughout the film.
By this time Hando is off the deep end. Killing indiscriminately; eyes bulging; ranting all over the place.
Insultingly stereotypical - but brilliant fun all the same.

'Romper Stomper' is a highly contentious movie but I won't see why. It glamorizes violence, a tried and tested ratings winner, and something I approve of whole-heartedly. It presents as noble and intellectual, bone-headed fascists bent on social self-destruction and the preservation of a way of life that doesn't exist anyway. There's profanity, explicit sex, callous humour, and a roaring Nazi-punk soundtrack.
So the problem is...?

Crowe is splendid as the charismatic but declining Hando - sanity steadily ebbing away - holding on to his twisted ideals to the last.
He reads from 'Mein Kampf' and it turns your blood to ice.
I'm sure I'm not alone taking his side in the final battle with boring, conscientious Davey - and like hey - all it takes is a blue-tinted sex-session with a hot nymphette to drive all that nasty Nazism to the hills.
I really think so.

The point:
'Romper Stomper' is a gripping action thriller about amusingly sarcastic mad-men wearing shaven heads and Crombie overcoats, hitting on minorities and getting wasted. If you can find deep political issue or even satire here - you're doing well.
It is NOT 'A Clockwork Orange' - it IS all about counterfeit sensationalism and cynical controversialism.  (!)

882968,5,6304431848,"When `Romper Stomper' opens one is immediately drawn into the sick and twisted mind of Hando, leader of a group of Skinheads residing in Melbourne, Australia.  This first scene depicts a harsh and spontaneous burst of violence towards a small group of Asians and is unsettling and disturbing and perfectly sets the tone for this brutal film.

`Romper Stomper' tells the story of this racist clan as they embark on a war against the Vietnamese community that is infesting their homeland.  The raw and gritty depictions of violence and hatred are gut wrenching and fearless in that they don't beg to be justified or understood but clearly just want to be recognized.  Director and screenwriter Geoffrey Wright manages to create a world so dark and scary that one feels almost compelled to investigate.  I remember when I first witnessed this film I was appalled at its apparent lack of moral center.  None of these characters are even given a sympathetic bone.  I had just come down from the high that was `American History X', a film that manages to creep inside the disease of racism from an angle of understanding, and so when I saw the way their hatred was calloused and without remote justification I was taken aback.  Then I realized just how brilliant this technique was.

`Romper Stomper' decides to target the senselessness of racism and it does so masterfully.  As Hando and his clan fall apart from the inside out, their personalities breeding controversy and segregation from within their own ranks, you can see that this breed of human can't even coexist with their own kind.  Then ending is brutally savage yet justified in its delivery.  It wouldn't feel right any other way.

Russell Crowe gives what might be his finest screen performance ever, and what truly serves to be one of the finest performances by any actor; period.  As Hando he is savage and ruthless, donning a cold and often unsettling exterior that breathes a life of superiority.  You recognize his power; you understand he owns you and you are ready to devote yourself to him.  There is a scene where he is explaining to Gabe, a young runaway who joins his clan, Hitler's words in Mein Kampf, and it's in that scene that you see who this man really is; how sick and demented and unholy his soul is.  Crowe gives such a rich and powerful portrayal of a man convinsed his own imperfections are godlike.

The rest of the cast delivers as well.  Jacqueline McKenzie manages to capture a sensual attraction that makes her `chink in the clan chain' all the more understandable, and Daniel Pollock, who plays Hando's right hand man Davey, delivers a knockout performances, channeling the misplaced loyalty and the confliction this man faces as the film draws to a close.  His untimely death only makes this film in general all the more tragic.

In the end I will say that `Romper Stomper' is not a film for everyone to enjoy.  There are many aspects of this film that are disturbing, and the fact that it desires no sympathy and really exacts no justice (not at least in an ultimate sense) can put some people off.  When we as a society consider the acts of racism and hatred we like to be put at ease by either witnessing a change in a person (as in `American History X') or finding a balance in understanding (as in `Crash'...sort of) or finding the ultimate act of justice in punishment.  `Romper Stomper' somewhat goes for the later, but not in a way you would expect.  This may leave some viewers cold as the film never really condemns these Skinheads for their actions.  Maybe that is the point though.  Maybe, just maybe, we are not supposed to condemn as much as observe; and observe we do.",1208476800,4,3672,4.68798751950078

Other reviewers have pointed out many of the film's good points: characterizations, the story line and the fighting back of the Vietnamese, Crowe's performance. Yes, there were weak spots, but the overall result was amazing.

Australia has been going through some degree of soul-searching, trying to answer the question: what does it mean to be Australian. Around the time this film was released, Pauline Hansen's fortunately short-lived party burst on the Australian political scene, full of racism and other bigotry. I don't think that the events were related, but the parallels between the attitudes of the neo-Nazis in the film and those of Hansen and her associates were rather obvious.

A significant part of this film is taking an aspect of a culture and bringing it out for examination and discussion in the cold, hard light of day. It is not a pretty part of the culture, whether Australian or anywhere else, but it is part of the process that a culture needs to go through as part of its development. That's why it's important, and when you add the way that the subject is examined, in the context of the times (which are not just the early 1990s), it turns into a stunning film. The characters are very human and believable, the situations all too possible. Crowe's performance is a great start to a great career.

There is a lot of sex and violence, and not particularly nice or sanitized. But beyond that, watch the film as a discussion of issues of bigotry. It's not just racism; that's the surface layer.

This is nothing but 90 minutes or so of mind-numbing graphic violence and a one-dimensional depiction of thoroughly hateful and unredeemable characters: there is no attempt to explain their motivations or to make them seem at all human.  There is no purpose to it, no emotional depth, and in the final analysis no point in sitting through it unless you enjoy violence for its own sake (I don't).  Was it the filmmakers' intention to show the miserable existence of the skinheads and the miserable fates in store for them and their victims?  If so, the filmmakers succeeded.  Otherwise I see no reason why this film was ever made.

It pales in comparison with the brilliant ""The Believer"" and even the more conventional, Hollywood-ized ""American History X"".  With those films there was much more than just skinheads spewing rage and hate and inflicting violence on hapless minorities, with a who-cares romantic sublot tacked on.

This film deserves to be watched only by Russell Crowe completists.  It's not even one of his better performances.

883111,4,6304431848,"Romper Stomper (Geoffrey Wright, 1992)

In the decade and a bit since Romper Stomper was released, Geoffrey Wright has gone on to direct the cheesy but clever Cherry Falls, while Russell Crowe has become a household name. Romper Stomper, which finally became available in North America following the critical and popular success of American History X a few years back, was an excellent showcase for both young artists.

Hando (Crowe) and Davey (Daniel Pollock) are two Australian skinheads leading a ragged group of mates who are somewhat unhappy with a sudden influx of Vietnamese immigrants into their neighborhood. When the owner of the pub where they normally hang out sells to a Vietnamese family, tensions come to a boiling point. Along the way, Hando picks up a new girlfriend, Gabrielle (Jacqueline MacKenzie, recently seen on this side of the pond in the TV series The 4400), who takes to their lifestyle with great relish, but who also attracts Davey's eye.

That Wright was already a fine filmmaker by this, his second film, is shown in many different ways here. (The party Hando throws early in the film from some out-of-town friends is both a fine example of the filmmaker's art and an excellent setup for a later scene to come, the revelation of the contents of which would be a major spoiler; watch it closely, then look for parallels towards the end of the film.) Crowe, too, already displays the raw charisma that's led him to three Academy Award nominations (in fact, his role as Hando won Best Actor from a number of Australian awards types). MacKenzie takes on the rather difficult job of playing a sick young girl (the nature of her sickness is not disclosed until well over halfway into the film, but is alluded to from the first time we see her) who's both nave and enthusiastic while still questioning all around her; she handles it with great aplomb. But it is Daniel Pollock who makes this film truly shine. Davey, in the first half of the film, is nothing more than a strongarm for Hando (and this is the film's weakest point), but as the film progresses, we gradually see Davey revealed as a working-class thug, shamelessly manipulated by his ""best mate,"" as he calls Hando, looking for a way out of the life in which he was raised and meeting frustration at every turn. Pollock's portrayal of Davey is made even more impressive when one realizes he was both battling a heroin addiction and in the throes of a love affair with MacKenzie that was rapidly going sour; Pollock committed suicide between the film's completion and its release. Romper Stomper stands as a testament to what might have been, had he survived.

Romper Stomper could well have been a perfect film. More attention to Davey at the beginning of the film, and more attention paid the developing the characters of minor players in the film, would likely have made it so. Still, the product as released is an excellent piece of work, emotionally jarring, morally ambiguous, and never without an attitude of confrontation. Highly recommended. ****",1105488000,5,3041,4.8310940499040305

883113,4,6304431848,"Filmed in gut-wrenching 16mm with a hand held, this is a courageously unsparing film of a neo-Nazi skinhead gang in Melbourne (Australia) obsessed with the danger they perceive in the growing population of Vietnamese immigrants.
Although it has been criticized for ""glorifying"" skinheads and not taking a moral position against them, neither criticism is really well-founded.
It is clear that the director and the actors made a great effort to get inside the characters, to make them human beings -- however repulsive -- and not simply caricatures. Still, the skinhead lifestyle depicted is mean, mindless, unromantic and, ultimately, pointless. Which becomes clear at the end when the leader (brilliantly played by Crowe) commits one final act of brutal bullying. What was their message really?
Also, for all their posturing, they are mindless bullies, ganging up on isolated victims, and they are completely undone when faced with victims who join forces and fight back with the same intensity. By the end, all but one of the gang members is in jail or dead, which seems to me to be a pretty powerful moral statement.
It is surely not perfect but it features genuinely terrifying performances of men totally twisted and misshapen by hatred, frustration and fear, yet capable of genuine affection and tenderness towards their best friends.
I recommend renting this out if you have some appetite for gore and unflinching visuals.",1086825600,17,1429,5.190476190476191
883114,4,6304431848,"If there is one thing that ticks me off, it's rascism and fascism. Early Skinheads were definately like this. However over the years, less and less rascist skinheads have been surfacing. Anyway, this movie is a very accurate portrayal of the skinheads, but it also has more than one plot going at once. The epic struggle of the skinheads v.s. the japanese, a skinhead restling with ""what am I doing?"" question, a girl who has been sexually used by her father, and how that same girl has split two former friend skinheads. It portrays they old lifestyle of drinking, premiscuous sex, drugs, fascism, and the brutal hate crimes they commit. In today's world, where movies are entertainment before anything else, there are fewer and fewer directors who dare to tackle unpleasant subjects. However, the real test of filmmaker's courage comes when unpleasant issues are
approached from even less pleasant perspectives. Such efforts, especially in the climate of ""political correctness"", can often create public misunderstanding and controversies. Romper Stomper on the other hand is definately an accurate portrayal and does go after the unpleasant topics. The plot begins in Melbourne, town towards which flow the endless river of Asian, mostly Vietnamese, immigrants who gradually take over entire neighbourhoods. For many impoverished and unemployed white youths Asians are convenient explanation for their own misery, so some accepted the most extreme form of xenophobic racism and
became skinheads. The small group led by charismatic Hando(played by Russell Crowe) is just one of many that fight a war for racial purity by mercilessly beating any Asian unfortunate to be in their proximity. After a while, Vietnamese decide that they had enough so they organise and start fighting back. Hando's group is suddenly faced with superior numbers and starts to fall apart. Hando and his lieutenant Davey (played by John Pollock) are forced to run from Melbourne in order to save their lives. The only assistance comes in the form of Gabe (played by Jacqueline Mackenzie), epileptic young woman from well-to-do family, but her presence would turn out to be the reason of Hando's final downfall. One of the most disturbing things of the film is the fact that a 12 year old skin head is shot in the head, in full view of the camera! Wright takes the hard route and shows skinheads through their own eyes. In the process the viewer is not only in position to be acquainted with very authentic-looking subculture of skinheads and their way of life. I recommend this film.",1084147200,5,2560,5.0831353919239906
883115,4,6304431848,"First and foremost, let me note to the reader that I would fit in with what many other reviewers have called ""the subculture"" (that is, essentially, neo-Nazi) depicted in the film, so if you want to pre-judge the objectivity of this review, do so now.
Well, to begin, I give the movie four stars because, although it may appear at first glance to be shoddily put together or rough around the edges, both in story and in cinematography, I believe that all these things lend themselves to the portrait being painted by this film, whether consciously or unconsciously. The jerkiness of the camera, the over-crispness of the sound and the very contrasting colours and levels of light in the movie help to psychologically reinforce the atmosphere being created for the film. The silence contrasted by the crisp yet quiet dialogue, the very colourless frames and the bland environments of a rundown Melbourne industrial give the feeling of cold, hard and dark. In my opinion, the rough-edge photography and sound, as well as the grungy sounding musical score may upon initial inspection give the impression of being second rate (even by the standards of the day) or unpolished, when in reality, to ""fix up"" any such aspect of the movie would be ruining it. The film depicts neo-Nazi Skinheads living in a slum old car shop, eating fast food and drinking away their lack of jobs and purposes in life; if anything, fancy camera angles and well done-over sound with a sophisticated musical score would detract from this vital image.
Personally, I do not believe, as some viewers believe, that the violence, the unfulfullment, the ruination and the utter hopelessness of the whole film from beginning to end is (or should be construed as) an attempt to demonstrate the alleged fallacy of the particular philosophy depicted in this movie. I believe that it is simply to depict the fallacy of living life as these particular Skinheads choose to live it. I for one know (and should rightly be in a position to, I might add), that the group depicted in Romper Stomper is not in the slightest characteristic of even close to half of any given population of Skinheads, although some countries seem to be havens for more antisocial misfits than others.
The single fact that, regardless of any other considerations, the characters lacked any faith in their ""convictions"" made their situation all the more hopeless. Any good philosophy, in the hands of any good people, regardless of the specifics, will incite those people to rise up and be the best they can be, and in this I believe that not even propaganda spouting Hando can claim to be truly ""enthused"" by what he reads to himself out of his little brown Mein Kampf every day. Without conviction to a cause, rhetoric is useless in face of the fact that, perhaps, you don't have a job, or a home, or you have a drinking problem. This aspect more than any made Hando's character and the character of his Crew all the more believable. They were social rejects who were just looking for a cause to feel big about, they needed to be preached to and Hando needed somebody to listen as he repeated over and over something he picked up in his little brown book.
Whether you are on my side or against it, or just not sure, I think everybody can relate to that in some way. Many Christians, although financially much better off than poor Hando and his Crew, are not much better spiritually. They read their Bible, act interested, but do not see the real wisdom which they believe is there.
I believe, ultimately, that this is a morality tale, and should be taken in whatever way the viewer wishes to take it. This is the beauty of the film as-is, as opposed to, for instance, American History X or The Believer. Some people may be (somehow) offended by a lack of any ""moral stand"" taken against the violence or rhetoric of this movie, but I believe that this is a good thing also. I believe any movie which will tell you in the end what you must think about a particular issue or lifestyle, such as American History X, is wrong in doing so, and thus, it would be wrong for me to tell you what you must take out of this movie.
Accept it as you may, in the end it is a story of how to lose everything quickly. As I said, whether you are racist or anti-racist or neutral, a sure way to send your life down the tubes is to follow the example set by Hando and his Crew, and this is universal truth, so regardless of what else you may take away from it, you should take this. If you do, regardless of whether you liked it, loved it or even hated it, then I believe the movie has done what it was supposed to do.",1083974400,9,4632,4.55515587529976
883156,3,6304431848,"Even though billed as a highly controversial portrayal of skinheads, this film really just uses skinhead subculture/violence as a backdrop; midway through it gets lost in a love triangle between the skinhead gang's leader (Russel Crowe) and his lieutenant/best-friend and a random blonde Crowe picks up in a bar.  Crowe does a pretty good job in his breakthrough film, spouts neo-Nazi propaganda fairly convincingly every once in a while, but not quite the acting virtuosity of his later work.
The violence is actually not all that atrocious---this is after all an Aussie production, and the Aussies just don't do celluloid violence anywhere as well as Hollywood does.  (Bone-crunching, blood-splattering, in your face quasi 3-D violence on film is one of the few things America still does better than anybody else in the world.)  You especially see this in the scene where the skinheads get overrun by a huge contingent of Vietnamese immigrants out to avenge their friends who were beaten up by the skins...the facial expressions, stunts, grunts, sound effects and fake combat often borders on comic cartoonish farce.
Again, the main problem with this movie is it just doesn't stick to any one particular theme or conflict, but stumbles along from violence to sex to romance to drama and back to a little bit of violence.  The last 10 minutes is more like a road movie than anything else.  There is no consistent theme, tone, or focus.
Overall it's a fairly entertaining 2 hours, but leaves you wanting.  The director apparently lived with some actual skinheads for a couple of months prior to filming so he does try to capture much of their lingo, music, parties, etc. authentically...too bad the film as a whole just seems so staged and unreal.",1078012800,8,1747,4.986254295532646
883157,5,6304431848,"Let me start out by saying that I am a skinhead.  I am not racist in the slightest(though I'm not a SHARP).  Romper Stomper is a very accurate portrayal of skinheads and the lifestyle(particularly that of racist skins).  The music, the fashion, the attitudes are all very authentic.  This is a far better researched movie when compared to American History X.  It is true that Romper Stomper only portrays skinheads as racists, but that is the story it is telling.  American History X explicitly states that skinheads are all racist and that Oi! is a racist style of music(whatever that means).  American History X's major flaw is its generalization of the lifestyle.  Romper Stomper doesn't refute that nonracist skins exist, it just doesn't show that side.  In fact, I believe that in the extras it even mentions that there are organizations such as SHARP(Skinheads Against Racial Prejudice).  The skinhead lifestyle(racist or nonracist) has not changed much since 1969.  Skinheads still wear Fred Perry shirts, bomber jackets, 501 Levis, steel-toe Doc boots, and thin braces(suspenders).  They still shave their heads.  Skinheads love their Oi! music just as much as they did in the 70's and 80's.  So, for me, once you peel away the backdrop of racism and the skinhead lifestyle, the skeleton of the story is a very Shakespeare-esque tale of two friends being torn apart by a common love to the point of tragedy.",1076976000,6,1415,4.965957446808511
883158,3,6304431848,"Wow.
Four days after I viewed by copy of Romper Stomper for the first time, and thats all I can get out.  Wow.
This film dared to do what American History X was afraid to, even though the latter truly was the latter.
A harsh and almost documentary film style, very typical of the dirty grime look all too common in early 90's films, the film style lends a somewhat artistic flare to the film, by keeping it so rooted in reality, you often stop feeling for the characters and begin thinking ""do people honestly live like this?  ignoring all but hate?""
Crowe.  THIS is what made people stand up and notice him, not playing a loveable schizoid (trust me, schizos are ANYTHING but loveable).  I honestly felt he believed what he was saying.  when he quoted mein kampf in the film, it was as if he really had those words pouring from his own mouth like it was a scripture...  scary stuff, especially since i still like russell.

883160,5,6304431848,"Romper Stomper begins as a movie about racism.  The Australian white people feel as though the Asian immigrants are encroaching on their homeland, so violence quickly ensues.  After a mass retaliation by the immigrants, the neo-nazis are forced to flee their home.  Their numbers plummet as members are killed in run-ins with both the immigrants and the police.  The movie ends with a love triangle between the two male leads and best friends, Hando and Davey, and the female lead, Gabe.  So, the question rises: Did American History X rip Romper Stomper off?  No, it did not.  American History X focuses solely on racism, whereas Romper Stomper seems to deal with a woman ruining a friendship between two men, with the backdrop of racism.  This point explains why Romper Stomper takes a sharp turn for its second half in dealing strictly with the love triangle and why the scenes of violence involving the immigrants seem so neutral, as previously pointed out by other viewers.  So, if you are looking for a movie that has a lesson on racism, this may not be what you are looking for.

ROMPER STOMPER is the story of Hando (Crowe) and his gang of Mein Kamf spouting, violent, thug, neo-nazi skinheads, including his best mate Davey (Pollock). The gang lives in deep poverty in an abandoned warehouse, eating pathetic meals and drinking like sailors (not to mention swearing like them as well). Hando soon becomes involved with a young drug addicted ecliptic girl, Gabe (McKenzie). When the gangs secondary hangout, a local bar, is purchased by a Vietnamese immigrant and his sons, the gang starts an intense turf war resulting in the most violent, realistic 20 minutes fight scene in cinematic history. Once the cops come onto the gangs tail Hando leads them in a quest for money and guns, to get revenge on the Vietnamese community. During this sequence of events, Davey and Gabe become friends and soon more then friends resulting in a distorted love triangle. Rated NC-17 when first released this is one of the most provocative, intense, powerful films of the 90's. A stunning directional debut from Wright and an equally stunning acting job by Crowe.
The DVD's bonus feature's were so myriad that it took 2 discs to hold them all. Included is a talking track by Geoffrey Wright, in which he discusses about the filming of ROMPER STOMPER and interesting tid-bits about particular scenes as they appear on screen. Also included on the first disc is a music track where the nazi punk rock songs, excellently composed by Clifford White, can be heard alone.
On the second disc their is the theatrical trailer for the film, which is in my humblest oppinion the best trailer I've seen (it actually made me want to see the film again that night). There are the written reviews of major publications promoting the film and discussing how amazing and powerful it is. Biographies of all involved with project are included as well as over 60 minutes of interviews from 1992 when the film was first released and over 30 minutes of interviews with Geoffrey Wright from 2000, reflecting on the film and it's impact on society. As well as all those features a demonstration of how the film was restored from the first American edition of the film, which had 1/4 of the film cut of from sight and had the look of a 1940's television program. Finally there is a track of photographs from the film displayed accompanied by interesting facts about the film, it's battle with censorship, and about the stars of the film.

Before ""AHX"" was released, I compared this film most often with ""A Clockwork Orange,"" but ""AHX"" seems like the best comparison...though there are still very definite elements of ""ACO"" packed in this cinematic miracle.  As with most of the better independent films I've seen, I caught this on IFC and was mesmerized by its depictions of neo-nazi skinhead life in Australia.  In later years, when I first saw ""LA Confidential"" and ""The Insider,"" it took a while to put two and two together and realize that this Russell Crowe person who was so fabulous in both films was the actor who'd portrayed Hando so magnetically in ""Romper Stomper,"" which I'd seen years before.  I still believe that this is his best performance to date, and the film itself will inspire awe in many viewers, though it is not suited to all tastes.  My comparisons to ""AHX"" and ""ACO"" should not only give you an indication of my devotion to this film (I don't just throw around comparisons to two such movies which I hold in the highest regard)...it should also let you know what kind of film you're in for when you rent or buy ""Romper Stomper.""

I do not seek violent movies (I hated ""A Clockwork Orange"") but I am not afraid of violence (I love ""Braveheart"", ""Gladiator). But I am also a film student of long ago, and recently I've become mesmerized by Russell Crowe and have sought out his work. If you know anything about Russell Crowe, you have to know that this film is considered by many to be the film that launched him on the career path that ultimately led to Maximus and the Academy Award. So, what did a good Crowe ""student"" like me do? I finally bought this DVD. And to my great surprise, I do not regret it for one moment. I actually like this film and as a student of film, was challenged and excited watching how Geoffrey Wright put this film together.
This film is, quite frankly, compelling to watch. The music has a great ""urban"" quality that stands out and is perfect for this film. The performances are good and once again, I am floored by Russell Crowe's ability to command the screen, bring you into his character, and make you want to know him. His talent at finding the way to convey someone's inner soul -- a turn of the head, a stare, a small movement, and the eyes -- there's always something behind those eyes that just compells me to watch him even when someone else is on the screen. I should have hated Hando, and instead I pitied him. And isn't that what Geoffrey Wright wanted? Many have mentioned a lack of a ""moral center"" when in fact every member of Hando's group suffers a justified fate -- WHAT COULD BE MORE MORAL THAN THAT? Geoffrey Wright PUSHES us into Hando's (Crowe) violent, hate-filled world, but he also shows us the loneliness and the stupidity of that world. His characters are given to us, to think about as we will, and when he merely shows us what their hatred breeds, we're allowed to look down on them from the hills above and watch them as they die on the beach. No speeches, just their fate.
If I had to criticize anyone, unfortunately, it would have to be Davey's character (not the actor). I thought Wright made him a little too sympathetic and he seems so opposite of Hando.
I am still surprised at my reaction to this film (just so you know, I don't like EVERY Russell Crowe movie...). I will watch this movie again, and the violence of this film, while disturbing to watch, is not repulsive.

883307,4,6304431848,"If Romper Stomper was intended to be a warning about the bourgeoning Nazi skinhead movement, it fails miserably, primarily due to the over-the-top silliness that pervades the latter half of the film.  That notwithstanding, there's a certain eerie rawness to the story and to the cinematography that prevents one from taking one's eyes off the screen.
Romper Stomper translates excellently to DVD.  The frenetic camera work, sound, and lives of the characters, are all well suited to the digital medium.  Stylistically, the film might be described as a mixture between A Clockwork Orange and Fight Club, if perhaps more nihilistic than either.  However, I suspect that the same person who fancied those two films will appreciate this one as well.
If you like your films visceral and ugly, definitely check this one out.  If, however, you are easily disgusted by violence and graphic sexual images, or if you would simply prefer a more realistic depiction of the Nazi skinhead movement, I would advise you to look elsewhere.",992736000,4,1022,5.095808383233533

883309,3,6304431848,"This movie is loaded with kilos of negative energy: scenes of fights and brawls between Skins and Chinese are really scary because it's real violence, not the cranberry juice sprinkled violence of action movies. All three main characters (Hando, his buddy Davey and doll-faced brat Gabriela) are hard to sympathize with: they are what they are and that's it. Speaking of ""love triangle"" seriously would be wrong in this film - yes, something like that is present here to move the film along, although what characters express can hardly be called love. And maybe something is wrong with my VCR, but I haven't noticed any ""blue haze"" the movie is supposed to be shot in, simply that's how the movies looked in 1993.
Go search for charismatic Crowe somewhere else - in Romper Stomper he is as attractive as a rabid dog, although his character is sound of body and (relatively) of mind, he's brutal and haughty, but leader in him you can sense from afar (the saunter, the squint, the voice). Funny though, when Hando says, ""I want revenge"", you'll see Maximus Decimus raising his head in defiance, ""I'll have my revenge in this life or next"". That only proves Crowe not to be some Aussie upstart, but a person whose talent has remained integral for 10 years.
In general, it's a movie to watch for those curious how R Crowe was starting his career, as well as to find out that such far and peaceful country as Australia has its racial problems. Otherwise, it's not an entertaining spectacle: leaves you with unpleasant aftertaste and your faith in human beings and their ability to live in peace strongly undermined.",987465600,4,1611,4.757142857142857
883310,4,6304431848,"Romper Stomper is a dangerous film. Dangerous, because it requires its viewer to think.
You can watch the film, about a group of nazi skinheads and their ventures, and treat it like any other action film: Enjoy the action scenes, and sympathize with the leading characters. However, if you start thinking about what you're looking at, you'll find that you're watching a film about the illnesses of society, and what happens when these illnesses are taken to their extreme. The director leaves nothing but hidden hints to guide the viewer, and unlike the common American film (American History X is the obvious example), leaves the entire burden of interpretation on the viewer.
Which is pretty much why I think Romper Stomper is a brilliant film.
The DVD's technical qualities are far from top notch, leaving an overall ""manufactured"" feeling. I suspect, though, that this is the director's original intention.",986947200,4,910,5.114093959731544
883311,5,6304431848,"I remember the first time I encountered ROMPER STOMPER in high school. My friends and I spent many a weekend night shuttling between each others houses and watching kung-fu, blaxploitation and the occasional copy of EQUUS, often while stoned out of our minds. Eventually, someone found this skinhead movie at the local video store and we put it in for some laughs. Well, we got the laughs (I watched the film sober and found that it is indeed possible to make a funny movie about hate crimes) and so much more. The film has enough style, wit and fine performances for ten of the Hollywood vehicles Crowe has been in lately and actually does a good job of humanizing these thugs so that our identification with them calls into question our own views on racism and violence. Now, I don't think kids (i.e. me at the age I first saw it) should be exposed to this kind of filmmaking. This is an ADULT film dealing with its subjects in an ADULT way. It doesn't condone the acts of its characters but it could be misunderstood in the wrong context by a less than mature viewer. I didn't run out and shave my head after I saw this (well, actually I did-but only because I dug the hairstyle [or lack thereof]) but it did get me a bit hyped up in the mosh pit as a kid, if you take my meaning.  Look, this is great filmmaking which offers no easy answers and doesn't give its audience a ""message"" to take home and for that reason it ain't for everyone. But if you feel brave enough to take the dive-do it. The rewards are many. This DVD package is great because it offers you a comprehensive look at the varied reactions to the film by the media and the director's and actors' takes on the influence of the film. The documentaries are good and the transfer makes a world of difference for the ""look"" of the film. Actually, it made me kinda miss my grainy old bootleg copy of the uncut version that's on this disc. But the restoration feature offers a little trip down memory lane for the film's fans. In the end if you want to see the best of a really crummy subgenre (the skinhead flick, epitomized by the shot on video masterpiece SKINHEADS:THE SECOND COMING OF HATE) then check out ROMPER STOMPER.

While Russell's character, Hando, isn't going to win citizenship awards, Russell does bring him dividly to life. The female characters are rather annoyingly sterotypical. Gabe is simply, unusual, with her traumatic childhood and endless chatter. One of the best, and most controversial, movies Russell's made. Since it was filmed in Australia, he speaks with his native accent throughout. Highly recommended for those who can overlook the fact his character is highly unlikeable.

No documentaries.  No lie.
Well, that's unless you're talking about Fox, it's producer.
It's sad when a sale closing device, like the DVD special feature is either abused or badly mishandled.  While the movie is well-worth the price of the disc, it is a letdown when the cool stuff you've been looking forward to actually turns out to be bogus.",974937600,25,964,4.647058823529412

883386,4,6304431848,"The new double DVD from FOX of ""ROMPER STOMPER"" is a welcome presentation of this 1992 skinhead flick.  The film has never looked better in this anamorphic 1.85:1 UNRATED version.  The Pan and Scan VHS releases were really quite bad and washed out (and this DVD lets you compare the old prints to this newly mastered WS version and it's a revelation!).  Even if you didn't care too much for the film previously, there's no denying that the DVD offers a whole new viewing experience.  The movie itself is a somewhat hit & miss, but the parts that work are very effective.  The harrowing assault on the skinheads' retreat  by the seemingly endless Vietnamese attackers is high suspense at it's most extreme.  Other moments seem more fabricated such as the love triangle and the somewhat calculated and inevitable ending.  Still, it's an interesting indy film that's definitely worth a look.
The double DVD features the movie on disc 1 with a commentary track by director Wright.  Disc 2 is the ""Extras"" disc and it's a mixed bag... first off, the DVD touts a ""Documentary called 'Skinheads - Reality and Fiction'"" --- There is no such ""documentary"" on this DVD.  It's just a 10 minute segment of director Wright discussing skinhead culture, etc. to an interviewer -- that's it!  Amazingly DECEPTIVE advertising on Fox's part, I must say.  There are also other Wright interview segments labeled subjects such as ""Making the movie"" which is also listed on the DVD case to make it seem as if it's a featurette --- but NOPE, it's just more talking by Wright as he sits there for 30 minutes.  Why not just listen to the commentary track instead???  Maybe the most interesting extra is where you can compare clips from the newly mastered film side by side with the old VHS version.  Besides that, there are some 1992 interviews of Wright and Crowe upon the film's release and some production notes, etc., but it's really kind of a letdown as far as ""extra discs"" go, especially since the case makes it seem like there will be lots of cool stuff on it.

Enter an almost documentary approach of an aussie bunch of wild skinheads and forget about the romance plot; not relevant. Russell Crowe is an astonishing Hando, and there's in this part so much of the intensity and violence he gave us his following parts in either LA Confidential and The Insider.  The whole film is just wandering along with these certainly dreadful guys, but no judgement, just the facts. Don't fail to get it in your video collection.",972777600,2,649,4.794642857142857
883388,2,6304431848,"First things first, this movie invites obvious comparison with ""American History X"", so let's have it.  ""X"" used all it's powers of rhetoric to portray interesting characters in tough situations, with the intent of giving us one central message: skinheads are bad.  Okay, fair enough.  ""Romper Stomper"" doesn't even go that far.  Sure, its skinheads are pretty bad too, but so are its immigrants, its tourists, its pill-poppers, and even its parents.  Now that I think about it, those are the only kinds of people we meet.  Kind of a bleak worldview, I'd say.  The skinheads just get caught up in all the anarchy, I guess (the whole thing made me think of The Road Warrior in that way; it had that same post-nuclear holocaust vibe to it).  Sometimes I think filmmakers should leave objectivity to journalists, and let us know what they really think.  Give us a chance to at least disagree.  Here, even though all the characters are quite disagreeable, the movie makes no real moral stance to disagree with.  It was quite frustrating.
It also had the most romantic Nazi-love triangle since Casablanca.  Kidding, obviously.  Hando picks up Gabe (Gabriella) in a white-supremacist watering hole, has some fun with her, and loses her to his ""best mate"" Davey.  Davey's a real sensitive racist, he is.  He's moody -- you can tell by looking at his furrowed brow.
The rest of the skinheads are so two-dimensional, they'd have a tough time battling a deck of cards to see which had more depth.  They are no more than a collection of drunken knuckleheads.  It got quite boring after a while.  Needless to say, I wasn't too shaken up with grief when they started dying off.
Most of the acting was fairly homogeneous, i.e., uniformly loud yelling and intense faces.  I will say that Jacqueline McKenzie as 'Gabe' does a credible job, which is rather appropriate since she has the most material to work with.  She is playing an actual character!  I wonder how that one slipped by...
Russell Crowe.  What to say about him?  Well, in my opinion he doesn't deliver an incredible acting performance, as most have said.  Rather, he gets by on oodles and oodles of charisma.  It's just off the chart, his star power.  Maybe I'm working with the benefit of hindsight, but when he's on screen, you just can't take your eyes off him.  He is the one actor who displays the most repressed brute rage (see the chair cracking scene in 'L.A. Confidential' for more of this).  He's always ready to pounce, and knock someone's head off.
Now, you may think that this scathing review is affected by the subject matter.  Not so.  I can watch a movie about kittens being tortured, if the story was engrossing and the acting was interesting.  So that's not an issue.  This is just a weak effort all around, only made watchable by the presence of Mr. Crowe.",970790400,9,2824,4.7

Not to mention he looks so very sexy in his whites  briefs in one scene, displaying his very masculine body in a rare shot. His  supporting cast are equally intense in their roles. I love the turn of  events midway through the story. This fim is not for the faint of heart.  But if your a Russell Crowe, this is definetly for you.

883390,4,6304431848,"This film has a documentary-like feel about it, almost as if hidden  cameras are monitoring all of the sordid actions of Hando's merry band of  immigrant thrashing thugs through the streets of Melbourne. There is little  plot and the moral of the story is never blatantly plugged anywhere in the  film. This is a story about how one man's frustrations and rage can ruin the lives of those around him,  many of whom admire and love him in their own sad ways. Davey and Gabe flock to Hando's band for the acceptence and affection that the rest of the  world has denied them, while Hando himself relishes his leadership role because it's really all that he has to live for. Of course, the young skinheads are embittered and calloused...they are unwilling or unable to secure employment or lead normal lives, so they naturally turn to bashing  Vietnamese immigrants whom they blame for the deterioration of their  society and the stark conditions of their own wasted lives. There is no  happy ending: right when Davey and Gabe begin to rediscover their humanity  (they fall in love) and attempt to break away from Hando's malevolent  influence, the leader of the ruined skinhead band attempts to murder Gabe  and is himself killed by Davey...and then the movie ends, with the two  remaining members of the group facing almost certain prison sentences for  their dirty deeds (which include a couple of murders by the film's end).  This is not light entertainment...make sure you are already in a rotten  mood before you watch Romper Stomper. Although very dark and depressing, RS  is well worth a viewing for Russell Crowe fans: the contrast of his  benevolent and noble Maximus character in Gladiator to his performance as  the murderous Hando is a very powerful testimony to his talent as an actor.",965001600,,1795,4.845394736842105

They affect skinhead trappings and bemoan  the decline of White Power; the film opens with a horrific gang war scene,  as Hando (Crowe) takes his cronies to stomp a group of young Vietnamese in  a subway station. The shots just make me wince at how rotten and vile the  skinheads act. To the skinheads their violence is its own reward, getting  it as gratifying as giving it. With the introduction of a 'poor little  rich' girl into the group, and especially her impact on the relationship  between Hando and his best pal Davey, occupies much of the later storyline.  This film will either make you want to take a judo class and become a  masked avenger against nasty skinheads, curl up and cry, or it may just  make you shiver at how gross and vile people can become.

Shot in a kind of artsy blue haze, the movie revolves around a group of Neo-Nazi skinheads who are attempting to fight off a flood of Vietnamese immigration into  Melbourne, Australia. The group is lead by 'Hando' - A strong and  charismatic leader played by Russell Crowe. Crowe is amazing as he manages  to convey a sence vulnerability beneath his uncompromising anger. A scene  in which Crowe qoutes parts of Adolf Hitler's 'Mein Kampf' is mesmerizing.  Things begin to disolve, however, when a love triangle begins between  Hando, his girlfriend Gabe (Jaqueline McKenzie) and Hando's best friend  Davey who is portrayed very low-key by Daniel Pollock. The situation is  compounded when an attack on some Vietnamese immigrants back fires and the  Skins are forced to defend themselves against a raging mob of immigrants  resulting in the loss of their home.
Writer/Director Geoffry Wright came  under attack by Leftist critics for not hitting everyone over the head,  like American History X, with an anti-racist civics lesson - His position  comes across as neutral. Indeed, one can almost sympathize with the group  as they are convinced Australia's future depends on its racial and cultural  purity.

Now, don't get me wrong, I love the acting by  Crowe, but the plot is overdone and empty. This 88-minute flash of a film  leaves a few distorted images of violence and a few worthwhile scenes of  structure. One interesting surprise about Gabrielle (which I'll leave to  you to find out) is about all the intrigue this film has. The characters  are flat. Crowe commands and leads this film. The other co-star, his best  friend Davey (sorry, don't know the actors name) has about as much emotion  as a cardboard box, and is as empty as one, too. The girl in the film,  Gabrielle, is played a bit better, but Crowe nor any other forgotten  performances can make this more than a 'What went wrong?' kind of film. I  expected more than a fight-and-chase film. I expected something worthwhile.  Things like character development, dialogue, or even mystery alude this  mess. You're able to see what is going to happen minutes (and sometimes an  hour) before it does. Alas, I was disappointed.
The transfer from  film-to-television is horrible. I'm not sure if it was 35mm, but it looks  it. To boot it's pan-and-scan (which I, as a film purist DESPISE, God bless  DVD) with lackluster sound, making you rewind and replay the scratchy  dialogue to understand what was said.

Whilst his character (Hando), is a  complete hard-case, we do get to see his softer side on occassion, this is  a good thing because other-wise Hando isn't a very likable  character.

883482,5,6304431848,"So much has been said about Romper Stomper (even on these pages) and it seems a little pointless to say more - but what is so offensive about it is the mis-infomation that seems to pop up all the time. People's personal  ideas about Daniel's death, comments like 'I think the film is racist',  talk of 'Real Skins' not being racist (well they are in my town), 'why is  it blue?' (Shot on Super-16mm in 1991, when the film stocks were not  perfected - a bit like asking why Charlie Chaplin made his films in Black  and White), all seem to show up people who have not the open mind to sit  down and deal with what is possibly one of the greatest films in  Australia's history. And be sure that Mr. Crowe considers this one of his  greatest works. This film really deserves to be released on DVD to take  full advantage of the stunning sound design.
If you liked it - try  getting hold of Geoffrey Wright's next film ""Metal Skin"". Along  with his short film ""Loverboy"", these three form a trilogy of  life in Melbourne's Western suburbs.",952819200,4,1034,4.38421052631579
883483,5,6304431848,"I highly recommend this film. The film does not bow to PC. It doesn't condem or condon racism. It just shows you the subject.  As for the actions of hando's gang going unpunished, this is not altogether true. By the end  of the film you could hardly say they all get off lightly. Hando seems to  dominate most of his gang, much like hitler did with the whole of germany,  dragging in the young, reluctant and the sheep. I think Russell Crowe  should not be ashamed of his role in this film (if he is at all) as he  portrays a charasmatic violent leader extremely well. This got the film in  trouble to which the director answers ""Wasn't hitler also  charasmatic?"". A good anti-racism film even if it doesn't blatantly  tell you this over and over again.  As for this skinhead issue, I shave my  hair down extremely short as I am losing my hair anyway. So maybe that was  a little unfair, but it does add well to the menacing appearance of hando  and his gang.",948844800,,959,4.350282485875706

883485,1,6304431848,"As an Australian I am deeply embarrassed to see this cow of a movie being offered for sale in the US and Canada.  Not to put too fine a point on it, this movie stinks.  Deeply disturbing, overblown to the point of  self-parody this movie virtually endorses the sick rantings of extreme  racists and homophobes.  There is no sign of condemnation of their  activities, this movie shows a happy community oblivious to society's  disapproval.  The fact that one of the lead actors committed suicide one  month after the movie's release in Australia probably says it all.  Russell  Crowe is still trying to live this down.  A year after RS (oh, how  appropriate!) came out he played an openly gay man in The Sum of Us and  went on TV in Australia to try and soften his image.  Thankfully he has  gone on to bigger and better things (Virtuosity, LA Confidential, etc).  Take my advice and give Romper Stomper a big miss.",946857600,6,914,4.577639751552795

7871811,2,6304431848,"I watched this movie because I heard this was the movie that made Russell Crowe a star.  I would disagree with that statement.  This movie is terrible, it certainly isn't in the category of American History X or Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.  It was as if the director said, ""That's not dumb enough, you are portraying skinheads in too great a light, do it again!""  However, there was a tender scene.  Russell Crowe is reading Mein Kampf to the rich, sexually-abused girl with a seizure disorder that sets up her father for a robbery that goes wrong because the stupid skinheads wanted to vandalize a Nissan Sentra instead of stealing the expensive stuff.  They could have stolen the Rolls Royce on the other side of the garage, but noooooooooo.  They steal the Nissan that they vandalized.  The ""star"" with the most action was the seizure woman.  She had sex with Russell and his best friend, Joe.  She had 3 seizures on camera, 2 full body nudity sex scenes, and is part of a love triangle between two men that did not have one intelligent conversation in the movie.  Russell just bosses Joe around while Joe plays the strong, yet sensitive hate monger.  Now, Joe is a German that lives in a shed behind his mom's house.  He doesn't tell her that he is a neo-Nazi because he doesn't want to upset her.  His mom was a sweetheart.  She tells Joe, in German, that the seizure girl looks like a tramp and asks if she is gone because she isn't running a brothel.  Joe has great composure for skinhead that beats people up, is beaten with clubs, never has a mark on him, and is conscientious enough not want to upset his mom that called the woman he loves a tramp and prostitute.  This movie is just awful on every conceivable level.  I'm a big Russell Crowe fan.  Gladiator and A Beautiful Mind are 2 of my all-time favorite movies.  Russell Crowe is a fantastic actor, but this one is a stinker for the ages. A must watch to develop perseverance and hope that life can get much better.",1520208000,,1983,4.4860335195530725

7871815,3,6304431848,"An Australian film about skinheads that declare war on the local Vietnamese immigrants. They fight, get chased, fight more, then some kind of weird love story develops. The main character Hando (Russel Crowe) is so full of hate and jealousy that he cannot let the most minor of slights escape his wrath. After the characters get lost or die off(?) ala 'And then there were none' style, we are left with Hando and his pal Davey (Pollack), who seems to be mellowing a bit and backing away from the militant lifestyle they once shared.

If you want to see better movies about introspection into skinhead/neo-nazi subculture, check out Gosling in 'The Believer' (American), or the much better 'Combat Girls' (Germany).",1516147200,,714,4.95

If you gave it less then 3 stars you should watch it again and pay extra attention. I guess the majority think they can write a story and produce a movie as good or better.
 I found the opening scene hard for me to watch because I don't believe in that type of violence. My race has nothing to do with that belief. I have absolutely no oriental blood in me and by the way the oriental race behaves, I have grown to my wise old age with no respect for that race, same as the terrorist and mafia, all power thugs. But I can understand why a gang of homeboys would see them outlanders as a threat. The orientals in the movie moved into the town without respect or regard for the folks that had lived there for decades. They weren't invited or welcome but still they arrived without even saying Hello. A little communication could prevent a war you know. This movie is true to that fact.",1516060800,,1002,4.2460732984293195
