3936009,1,B002IAPWGC,"My memory of this film, seen only once and nearly 40 years ago at that, is entirely unmatched with my present viewing. I thought the Pink Floyd track, ""Echos,"" was on this! Anyway, I found this to be a fine HOME movie, a nostalgic novelty, but in the main pretty boring. Yawn.",1266364800,,276,4.326923076923077

8370771,5,B002IAPWGC,"I thoroughly enjoyed watching this movie. It's a time capsule that contributes both historical facts about the evolution of shortboards and also the get back to nature push that was very significant during the same era. The ordering and delivery process could not have been easier. Finally, George Greenough was very ahead of his time. In terms of design, photojournalism, practising financial independence and simply being a really likeable bloke.",1406160000,,448,5.414285714285715

8370773,5,B002IAPWGC,"Saw this when it was first toured around all the small town cinemas.
Still as good or better today.
Quality of the DVD was excellent",1402617600,,132,4.32
8370774,5,B002IAPWGC,"This film is an absolute must for anyone interested in the history of surfing and especially the late 60's and early 70's.  Hmmm, short-board surfing, empty waves, secret breaks, total immersion.  George takes us into the tube, into it, with him. You might need to shift consciousness to enjoy this film at the level George experienced it.  But then you might be delighted by what you can see and hear when you slow down, lay back, and go for it.",1395619200,,446,4.55
8370775,4,B002IAPWGC,"Greenough was a pioneer with water shots.  What we all can now do with a go pro, he helped start.  Great movie with some great surf shots, and some amazing water shots.",1376179200,,168,4.21875
8370776,5,B002IAPWGC,I remember seeing this film in '69 in a small theater in San Diego and I was so glad to see its still available.  Are there any other Greenough films out there from those good days?,1372204800,,181,4.027777777777778
8370777,5,B002IAPWGC,"Genius. Just surfing and good tunes.  No corny comentary or staged stunts that is so common in surf flics
Guessing that most of the surfing was done 68-69.  Greenough's camera points of view GreenoughVison!) are stunning and i
found my self in some scenes to be moving in my chair as if i was on the wave.  The boards definitely represent
this period of transistion well.  The actual surfing is smooth and flowing with beautiful lines as theses Aussie's trim out.

Turned out to be two movies: 'TILOPF' and Greenoughs 'Coming Of The Dawn', a trippy, mesmerizing short film.",1357776000,,573,4.747474747474747
