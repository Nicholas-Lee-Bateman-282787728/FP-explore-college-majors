8545554,5,B009Z4AEXU,I saw Malice in 1994. Nicole Kidman has been my favorite actress since.  Alec Baldwin is amazing and Sexy as hell in this movie. The whole cast is perfect.  So glad I finally own it on DVD,1452816000,,188,4.054054054054054

8545557,4,B009Z4AEXU,"The actors did a very well job of portraying the seriousness of the situation. I would have like a little more background information on each individual in the fight, but otherwise well done.",1390176000,,191,4.818181818181818
8545558,3,B009Z4AEXU,"Let's say you've waited for years for something to come out on DVD and it finally becomes available.....what's more, it's shown as being the full program.  So, you naturally order it, right?  Then - you play it and it's edited - say what?  Obviously, your next step is to warn others so they don't spend money on something that isn't complete.  The VHS set for ""Thirteen Days To Glory"" is 3 hours long.  The package this set comes in says it's 180 minutes - the full mini-series.  I suppose that's why when it gets played, it checks in at 148 minutes which the last time I checked isn't 3 hours, but 2 hours and 28 minutes, somewhat shorter than the original.  You do have to give credit to those who edited out the 32 missing minutes - they did do a decent job - but sadly, it's not the full program.  If you're like me, you've been looking for this and are excited it's on DVD.  Perhaps the missing 32 minutes won't bother you.  After all, an edited version is better than no version.  There does appear to be several other versions available - you might check out one of those - this one definitely is not complete.  That's why 3 stars for this product is being generous and it only gets that because the transfer is decent.  Back to the drawing board - time to try and find a complete version!  Old saying:  Let the buyer beware. I have no idea what another reviewer purchased to make them say it's the complete 180-minute version, but it certainly wasn't this one!!",1355616000,4,1470,4.372693726937269
8545559,5,B009Z4AEXU,"Truly Great Bargain with the suspense filled thriller Malice1993 thrown in almost for free
The Alamo:13 Days to Glory was one the the very best Alamo flicks in recent years. It is in between the 1960 John Wayne Grand Spectacular and the more recent Thornton/Quaid 1996 outing. The filming was done on John Wayne's reconstructed San Antonio village (of the time) at nearby Brackettville, Texas. This outstanding movie is a great bargain in itself, running a full 3 hours with outstanding acting from James Arness, Loren Green,and Alec Baldwin. The portrayal of Santa Ana, by Raul Julio, is near Oscar Caliber. It very closely follows the award winning book I read as a youngster: 13 days to Glory by Lon Tinkle.
The movie is long ""out of print"" and barely obtainable on inferior VHS, but thanks to Amazon Here it is for all to once again enjoy in a bargain price ""twofers"" pairing. A Huge Thank You Amazon!
