8598362,5,B004P3ENHE,"I have never had the pleasure of seeing an Opera when I was invited to
watch the documentary of Figaro: Living in the moment of a character.
This documentary about 15 singers, two countries accompanied with the
music of Mozart. The viewer travels along as the character takes an
incredible journey between two music schools.

This documentary had such an impact on me that, I have personally add
seeing a Opera to my list of things to be accomplished. If this
documentary can have such a profound effect on a person who didn't know
anything about Opera, makes one only imagine what a treat this
documentary is for a person who enjoys the Opera.

The producer and director did a great job!",1325894400,,688,4.631147540983607

of the opera and of documentary films, this was certainly a treat for
me. Great filmmaking, great film very insightful. I have passed it
along to some of my other friends and they all have loved it. Kudos to
the filmmakers.",1307750400,2,294,4.175438596491228
