7904582,5,6300147266,"Probably the last good theatrical film Lana Turner starred in before doing her last theatrical film.  Great story with wonderful actors in a style no longer seen in theatrical films today.  Yes, it's a soap opera, but a good one with one of the brightest and most glamorous stars from the golden age of Hollywood (Yes, she wears her fur coat with a scarf in this film).  Do not miss it, even though if it is hard to find on any TV or cable channel.  If you are a Lana Turner fan, you must see it!  Please put this film on DVD.",1511395200,,526,4.117647058823529

7904584,5,6300147266,Proving she still had her starpower in the 1970's Lana Turner starred in this fine film. I remember seeing this in the theatre. Soap opera to be sure but of the good kind.,1361145600,,171,4.212121212121212
