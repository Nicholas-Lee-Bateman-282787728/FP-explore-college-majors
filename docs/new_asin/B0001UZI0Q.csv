8016425,5,B0001UZI0Q,I am always intruiged by the depth of the Civil War.  There are so many stories that you could learn for days.  These two DVD's are filled with just some of those stories.  After watching them I found myself rethinking some of the things I heard.,1211155200,,246,4.304347826086956
8016426,5,B0001UZI0Q,"All I can say is, that if you 'think' you know about heros--you haven't seen this DVD. The Civil War will no doubt have many heros, so many stories of heroism will never be known, told and --known only to God now.
I was extremely moved by the stories by lesser known participants in The Great Civil War.

I appreciate history.  I have even more appreciation to the living historians--best known as re-enactors.  They are dedicated in never letting anybody forget the blood and lives lost for what we enjoy as Americans have today.  Unknown is that after this Great Civil War--the Blue and the Grey made peace and became Americans once this Civil War was concluded.  Each side had deep respect for the other.",1203724800,,707,4.624
8016427,4,B0001UZI0Q,"I thought this was a very well done documentary..I would of given it 5 stars, perhaps, but I've just finished Ken Burns again and that is the gold standard in my opinion. This set was well done and very educational and informative, the images are outstanding as is the content. A welcome addition to any Civil War collection.",1151193600,,325,4.620689655172414
8016428,3,B0001UZI0Q,"Interesting and informative.  Almost a little too thorough as it lost me a few times.  Very long; both my husband and I fell asleep while watching it.  Aided in our visit to Gettysburg, but not exactly entertaining.",1125619200,3,215,4.756756756756757
8016429,5,B0001UZI0Q,This DVD box set shows what can be done when you take the time to get the history right! I found the first DVD to be chock full of interesting episodes based around the Battle of Gettysburg. The 2nd DVD rounds out the set with stories of valor from throughout the Civil War - some of the episodes feature things this Civil War buff did not know! Be sure to check out the commentary tracks for added insight!,1096848000,12,407,4.230769230769231
8016430,4,B0001UZI0Q,"Many thanks are owed to Bussler, Neville, Kraus, and everyone else who clearly worked very hard to bring this documentary to life. The most professional of the series so far, they are palpably coming into their own as filmmakers while retaining the love and care of amateurs (meant in the best, noble sense). Also very nice for the more educated Gettysburg scholar is the focus on some of the not-as-prominent people and places of interest, i.e. Col. Strong Vincent and Culp's Hill.

The only drawback is one that one hates to mention, but nonetheless it is what kept this from being a 5-star review. Acknowledging that Carradine is a history buff and an accomplished actor, his narration at times drives one to distraction. Emphasizing the last word or syllable, in the same way, of every sentence in the film makes it seem like work after a while. It's not so much that it's monotone, but more like tri-tone. But maybe it was just my mood or something else. It might be the kind of thing that would go unnoticed by most people, and I hope it is.

On the other hand, the alternate commentary is great. With the exception of the bawdy and juvenile ha-ha regarding John Burn's statue, and uncomfortable silence that follows it, the track is packed with still more information than the actual documentary. It lends credence to the filmmakers' assertion that hundreds of documentaries could be made about stories from this auspicious battle. Don't pass this feature up.",1094688000,16,1466,4.813492063492063
8016431,5,B0001UZI0Q,"The best part about this film is that it offers both an overall recounting of the events of Gettysburg while going into detail about the lives and experiences of the people who lived it. It can be difficult to find a balance between the two, but Bussler has done it, and done it well. Highlights for me include the segments on prison life and the history of medicine and surgery. Many books and films about the period focus on the battles, but prison life and medicine certainly played an important role at the time and cannot be overlooked, as many films and books often do. The telling of the story of the Allegheny Arsenal explosion was also well-done, providing insight into an event that is not widely known. Keith Carradine's narration adds color and depth to the documentary and, as with all of Bussler's films, the sound is amazing.",1092787200,17,840,4.644295302013423
