382470,1,6301948262,I'm not sure how this film ever got edited and released.  Low budget and horrible acting.  The main guy ( Dean Cameron) for section 8 is probably the worst actor I have ever seen.  Do not waste your time watching this! It's so far from Aspen Extreme!,1442793600,,250,4.276595744680851

382510,5,6301948262,My buddies and I just about melted my VHS version watching it in the barracks over and over and over again.  Some of us even used the air high five - have to watch to understand.  Too many people forget movies were made to entertain.  This is one of those films.  You can't criticize anything about it.  Just sit back and... be entertained.,1370390400,3,340,4.333333333333333

382513,5,6301948262,"Finally after years of waiting....the DVD is here.  I will order it as soon as I can.  My 15 year old VHS copy is almost destroyed because I've watched it so many times.  Those of you who are JAG fans will recognize Patrick Laboryteaux as Ed.  Great performance, but the funniest are given by Dean Cameron and Tom Bresnahan.  Dave Marshak assures the evil yuppy skipro Reid Janssen in the first scene, ""You're too late Reid.  I've already put into action a devious and elaborate plan to rid this mountain of you and your satanic presence forever."" and it gets better from there.  Whose Under Is It? will have you in stitches.  The movie was done at Whistler so the scenes are pretty good with the exception of the final one.  Madcap party antics and a visit from a Playboy playmate make this movie great.",1266969600,3,804,4.489655172413793

382566,5,6301948262,"If you're looking at this page, you probably have a good idea of what this movie is about already. Its your basic buddy film in the snow, where the wacky off beat type guys beat the evil ski nazis at their own game. This movie had that balance between funny and over the top and stupid, which was lost in the sequel. This film has the charm that the makers of the sequel lost by, as per usual, trying to go farther and going too far. If you're into '80s and '90s style B movies, this is one you should have.",1200700800,,507,4.02970297029703
382567,4,6301948262,"Great fun, I had waited a long time to see this on DVD but unfortunately just like when Hot Dog came out a few years ago it is only on bloody full screen. Oh well, still a fun movie.

382569,5,6301948262,"Hands down, one of the best films of it's kind, you know what that means, right? It's true, this DVD isn't in widescreen as advertised on the box. But in all honesty, I hardly think it matters with a movie like this. Ski School is a classic T&A cheesefest in the truest sense. Minimal plot, great skiing scenes, lame jokes and often whitty dialogue and lots of naked ladies. Dean Cameron is a funny guy though, and this film has a certain charm that makes it irresistable. I do actually prefer the sequel, Ski School 2, over this one because of Toddorbert. But over all it's a pleasant film worthy of your time if you're into this sort of insanity. So...check your brain at the door, have some fun And learn the history of the Lambada!

Now someone needs to put Ski School 1+2 out on Blu-ray as a double feature with some friggin' special features; like the commentary Dean, Bil and Will did for SS2 which is hilarious. A trailer, original music, widescreen, ANYTHING!",1188604800,2,968,4.531428571428571

382572,5,6301948262,"Dean Cameron in his finest hour.  I have watched this on vhs 50 times and always pick up something funny.  Mr. Cameron was kind enough to answer my emailed questions regarding some aspects of the plot, something that says a great deal for his regard to his fans and his courtesy.  Admirable at the least.

I am tempted to buy 2 and keep one pristine for my children when they come of age. Of course my wife may not share my views....  I even took a ski vacation to whister/blackcomb to see that place.

I must have for anyone of anyage who enjoys ""juvenile hall antics""

382573,5,6301948262,"Ski School may be the best Dean Cameron movie ever.  It has good versus evil, Playboy playmates and snow.  What else is needed for top notch entertainment.

Did Citizen Kane have any of the above?

I think not!

I just wish I knew how to pronounce Patrick Labyorteaux's name.",1184889600,8,275,4.530612244897959

382618,5,6301948262,Ski School has to be one of the greatest films of all time.  But where is the DVD release?,1054425600,,90,3.736842105263158
382619,3,6301948262,"Ski School, released in 1991, is unfortunately one of the last in the now seemingly dead genre of good time, titilating, silly 80's comedies, with no political agenda whatsoever.  I for one miss these types of movies very much, having been a child of the 80's myself.
The plot is similar to the plot of just about any comedy aimed at the teenage crowd during the 1980's.  The Animal House storyline was the blueprint for practically everything during this decade, and more specifically, Ski School copied the Hot Dog: The Movie blueprint almost to the letter.  It's a copy of a copy.  Nevertheless, I can't imagine anybody thinking of buying a movie called Ski School is looking for oscar worthy performances.  This is pure unadulterated fun, and they do it quite well in this flick.
In comparison to other ski films, this one stands up.  I rate Hot Dog a little higher, for being a little more original and a little funnier, and Hot Dog also had slightly better skiing sequences, but Ski School is the ultimate king in the area of T&A.  (Besides, it's a hundred times better than Ski Patrol.)  This film might just have the greatest number of beautiful breasts seen in a Rated R film since 1984's Hardbodies, and as Dave Marshack would say ""Has anybody got a problem with that?""  ""NO!""  I certainly don't.
Skiing action in this film is still quite good and Dean Cameron, who plays Dave and was in such films as Summer School and Men At Work, is a hilarious, underappreciated comic actor, but most of the acting talent in this film is subpar, especially the guy who plays Johnny.  I'm not sure I've ever seen a less inspired performance on film than this guy gave.  But Dean Cameron is the heartbeat of this film and the villians who play Reed and Derek are pretty funny as well.
In summary, the ski action is good, although slightly lower than Hot Dog or Aspen Extreme.  The acting performances are adequate, except for Cameron, who excels.  And the screenwriter just mailed this one in with little effort, probably after a drunken night of watching Hot Dog!  But, the unadulterated good times are in abundence in this film.  A lot (and I mean a LOT) of hot girls, many of whom show us what they're made of, and a lot of beer drinking, dancing, and rowdy behavior, make this film worth watching for those looking for stupid 80's fun!  As Dave tells his new Section 8 cronies at the beginning of the film: ""Ski School is NOT about learning how to ski!""  A fun movie!",1050537600,12,2466,4.553287981859411
382620,5,6301948262,"Clearly this film has not received the praise worthy of such fine cinema.  Marshack -- a genius, Fritz -- a babe magnet, and of course, Johnny -- a true American Hero.  The similarities to films such as Out of Africa, Gone with the Wind, and Steele Magnolias only prove the staying power of such potent film making.",1042243200,,315,4.508771929824562

382622,5,6301948262,"Ski School is a great movie, one of my all-time sports/comedy favorites.

There are so many that if I typed them all I would run out of the thousand word space amazon provides for you.  So let me just say this, Ski School is the man's movie for drinking.

First of all, if a guy doesn't like  this movie, than he is gay. So much nudity. The ski scenes are great also.

It was on an old tape I made from cable back in the 1990's and I decided to watch it again. I really did like it I must say. The girls in that film are incredibly beautiful. Ava Fabian was incredible! I also loved how the pretty girls distracted the guy as he was skiing down the mountain--with their mountains!

Buy this DVD for laughs. I also recommend Hot Dog if you like this sort of film genre. I'm the 71st person to review this film.
