These events were not far from my home and the friend who was my best man 34 years ago and sold me my 1st dirt bike lives where the course for the Hopetown race was. I raced against some of the Hopetown racers later on. Well put together video productions considering when they were done. While the image quality wasn't as good as what is put out now, the production is still quite good. Lots of cameras used.",1464998400,,423,4.3

Some of the footage in this DVD is also in On Any Sunday.
Like a friends home movie with the friend telling you about it.",1443312000,,142,3.9310344827586206
8173251,3,B000A2UBK2,"Bruce Brown's videography of the racing at Ascot Park and Bob Hope's property in Simi Valley is a historical look at dirt track racing and the origins of motocross in America. SoCal was home for many future World Champions of all disciplines of motorcycle racing. This video has Wide World of Sports footage, as well as Bruce's own film stock.
  The production quality isn't the best. It ain't On Any Sunday or The Endless Summer. It is a fun look back at some of the greats and how important racing was to people like me who grew up in that magical time and place.",1351123200,3,565,4.423076923076923
