Adults found themselves smiling and somewhat surprised by how entertaining the Osmonds really were, and my three year old nephew became an instantaneous fan.  He asked several times if we could watch ""the snow video"" again -- and he seems to like Donny's rendition of ""Three Times a Lady"" the best. (!?!)",1164326400,11,360,5.084745762711864

2647879,5,B000HXDQMY,"Christmas with the Osmonds was always a fun event, growing up in the 70s.  All these new talk about bringing back the family unit, from Oprah to Jamie Oliver, The Osmond Family unbashfully serves their interpretation of the family to millions around the world, and influenced a whole generation.  This episode is a fun participatory program with the entire Osmond family, wives, kids, even Grandmothers.  A segment, featuring the Osmond Kitchen was deleted by many stations in Asia, to make room for more advertising.  So this show was an ""extended"" version that fans in Asia saw.  This show was significant to Asian fans because it was the first time we saw Donny's wife, Debbie onscreen, and a few months later, some were able to meet her in person as she toured with the family throughout South East Asia.  Brings back great memories.........",1163116800,14,845,4.915492957746479
2647880,5,B000HXDQMY,"This show was excellent in every aspect. I was captivated from the opening number and stayed glued to my TV until the closing credits. It was so fun to see the entire Osmond Clan decked out in their holiday finest having such a wholesome and lighthearted good time. I especially enjoyed seeing Debbie, Donny's wife sing a duet with Donny. And the other wives put on a musical extravaganza as well. There was even a guest appearance by the Osmond grandparents. I would recommend this DVD to anyone who wants to really enjoy an old fashioned Christmas special. There is a mixture of traditional Christmas songs, some uptempo numbers, and even some spiritual songs included. A particularly poignant segment included little brother Jimmy singing a song out in the snow. I'd never seen the two lesser-known older brothers before but they were in the middle of everything on this particular show. One of the best Christmas specials I've seen in a long time. It made me wish that I was part of their family. After watching this I'm more convinced than ever that I am the fat Osmond who Mother Osmond abandoned in the hospital only to be adopted by some nice folks here in the Pacific Northwest!",1162425600,37,1187,4.711538461538462

It was like seeing it the first time all over again being it had been 35 years since I'd seen it.  Thank you!  It gives me a way of sharing Christmas memories from the year I graduated high school with the kids whom I love now around me.,1386720000,,355,3.835616438356164

2647892,5,B000HXDQMY,"I really enjoyed taking this trip back to the 70's with the Osmond Family. It was a time of happiness and togetherness for all of them that they so generously shared with us. I especially loved seeing the Osmond parents singing together
(they both had beautiful melodic voices). It was nice, and a little sad sharing their fun times. I remember watching this Special on TV when my daughter was a baby and it brought me back to yesteryear when times were simple and happy.
Yet I know I will watch it again with tears in my eyes for many years to come. So have the Kleenex ready loll",1354665600,2,581,4.339449541284404

I just saw the Donny & Marie show here in Vegas; talk about all grown up!! The talent then is as it is now. Donny & Marie play off each other as geniune friends. I really enjoyed the DVD. Some of the songs were not Christmas; but the songs were enjoyable. You will get to see all NINE children, their parents, grandparents, wives, their children, etc, etc, etc. I really enjoyed it. (I wish they would do a NEW Christmas DVD.  The talent is all still there.) Enjoy",1270252800,,590,4.221238938053097
2647894,5,B000HXDQMY,"Why don't they make Christmas specials anymore?  They are fun to watch.  I have to disagree with one of the previous reviews a little.  I think the Christmas spirit died in the entertainment industry in the 90s.  That's when everything turned bitter and sarcastic.  Nowadays, they'd rather make cheap, unwatchable reality shows than a good production.  Oh well, we DO have dvds to enjoy, thankfully!

I like Christmas programs and this one has music, dancing, and humor in it.  I think people who put down this kind of show are either jealous or just don't know what good clean fun is all about.  It makes you feel good.

Recommended if you like watching something that has no foul language, no tasteless jokes, no bitter sarcasm, just corny humor at times.  Safe for family viewing.  You won't find this kind of thing on tv today.  At least we can play our DVDs over and over.",1259539200,2,877,4.616883116883117
2647895,5,B000HXDQMY,"Overall: Fabulous.

This is Donny & Marie's third Christmas special. This is not the one that features the outdoor concert, that's 1977.

It's almost wall to wall music. There are no non-musical comedy segments, no guest stars, and a minimum of talking, impressive. Sadly it does not feature any live performance.

Only one segment falls a little flat - the rooftop segment. The dancing and production is good, but the song isn't very good. Marie over acts in a style of performance that's really gone out of style now. As Donny relates in some interviews, he had to unlearn much of his performing style since it now seems pass&eacute;. The constant smiling and overt playing to the audience. It's interesting to see Marie performing this way and inasmuch as it seems old fashioned that gives you some insight into your own evolution of taste.

The final two songs are sensational. An arrangement of ""Silent Night"" set against another tune and a final climax number with the entire family. Several other songs in the show are great.

Donny & wife Debbie sing ""Three Times a Lady"" to each other to very good results. Debbie sings in a slight Osmond style and way better than I expected, actually very good. Donny is electrifying in this piece and the saccharine level may move you, it did me.

The Osmond brothers appear throughout but do not get prominently featured. Jimmy gets a solo song and featured in a few other segments, he comes off well.

The concert segment is a relative disappointment, it isn't as ambitious as other concert productions from Donny & Marie had been. It doesn't feature any live performance at all and does not feature any instrumental sections. It's not that long. That said, it still delivers an electrifying Donny & Marie duet up front and when the duet adds in Jimmy for a third voice the voltage is just that much higher.

Even at this early stage (1978) the size of the Osmond clan is impressive with 2 parents, 9 children (most with associated wives), and a gaggle of grandkids.

The Osmond wives sing a number in the talent show segment and it's ok. It ups the saccharin content but for historical purposes it would have been better to see an ambitious Osmonds production.

The Osmond men sing through a comedy cooking segment production number. It's ok.

George & Olive sing a duet by themselves - yet another saccharine over music moment. It's not great singing but it's a nice moment.

There is an Osmond band segment during the talent show segment that comes off a little weak. It's painfully obvious that none of the instruments are actually being played. Merrill repeats yet again his banjo playing. Dad Osmond gets a bass solo which is just throwing it in our faces that we're watching air guitar. I don't know how good Donny is at piano but I'm pretty sure he's nowhere near as good as what we hear him play - we don't get to see his hands. Even so, it's good.

The religious content is not in your face - just standard Christmas fare from people that actually believe in it.

The overall effect, outside of the musical content, is pretty much as intended. The Osmonds come across as a tight, happy extended family with wholesome values and fun. There's some extra saccharin there but it's not so overdone that it's distracting.

Overall: A, but I was hoping for A++++",1249689600,2,3312,4.676419965576592

I actually think the spirit of Christmas was lost by the 80's and if you want to get it back, then you have to work at it a little harder. The first step is to surround yourself with the people and things that take you back to your happiest Christmas memories. Yes, you can actually go back if you try hard enough. Come on people, you only have one life! This dvd has plenty of old fashioned cheese and 70's fashion. You KNOW you wish your family was this tight and had this much fun!

Christmas with the Osmonds. Can it get any better than this? Christmas has always been about being with family sharing the holidays and remembering christmas's past. I truly enjoyed the skit where the osmonds were going to welcome the newest member to the family, Debbie, Donny's new wife. Then an Osmond brother says wait, Debbie's not the newest osmond, my son is, then another osmond steps in and says, no wait, your baby isn't the newest member, my baby is, then another osmond steps in claiming his baby is newest member. then yet a 4th osmond steps in with the youngest baby.

2647938,4,B000HXDQMY,"This 1978 special is fun to watch if you're a true Osmond fan. I believe it only aired on ABC-TV once. It was Donny and Marie Osmond's third Christmas special that not only features the famed brother and sister duo, but their entire extended familes too, their brothers Alan, Wayne, Jimmy and Merrill along with all their wives and kids, Donny's new wife Debbie, and of course their parents George and Olive Osmond too.
The show resembles a set of their winter cottege in the mountains of Ogden, Utah. There are sketches where the brothers happilly sing even when they try to make Christmas meals, but things go apart very silly. Another sketch features Donny and Marie singing on stage at their own home-bulit stage studios in Utah with a live audience, and Santa too, of course. You just can't find these rare specials on TV nowadays, not even on the TV Land cable channel. The magic of DVD's, like this one, are the ones to find if you love 1970's nostalgia.",1202601600,4,961,4.593023255813954

Everyone sports those caricatured trademark 'big teeth', and as corny as it gets, I had a smile on my face the entire DVD.  My wife loved it even more. Gets you in the spirit, although, as usual, it showcased the Osmonds and went a little over the top with this.

Thirty years have passed since this program, and it is a prime example to show exactly how political correctness has given us a sterilized 'Holiday' season, and how the networks have removed all mention of what Christmas is supposed to be.  Most kids growing up today have no concept of the reason for the season, and I was so fortunate to not have that taken away. Such a program with many of those those song selections would be unlikely to be produced today.

So if you recall 'Donny and Marie', curl up in front of the fire, and even sing along....and if you don't recall...step into another era and see what real fun was like.",1196467200,2,974,4.388888888888889
