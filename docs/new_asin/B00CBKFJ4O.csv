8579915,5,B00CBKFJ4O,"Based on Amazon's description, I bought this TV series from Vecosell in Italy.  Ordered July 5th, received July 18th.  According to the description, there should be Italian subtitles.  There are none.  Fortunately I have read the book and my Italian is good enough so I can enjoy watching the movie.

Scenes with dialogue alternate with a narration, which I assume is taken from the book (I have not checked yet).  So far, I have watched only episode 1; if I post this review now, it is just to warn others about the lack of subtitles.",1377043200,3,535,4.578947368421052
