8603198,1,B00EALQOSC,Ive seen this movie and ordered it to show my parents. But it won't play. Tried on other machines and the DVD itself is simply defective. I ordered a lot of stuff and am home only rarely so didn't get around to sending it back and don't want to bother my parents into doing it for me. Last time I order a DVD from Amazon.,1529193600,,321,3.953846153846154
8603199,5,B00EALQOSC,"This Spanish film was released as Que se mueran los feos and is a love story of two ugly people. We meet Eliseo played with effusive energy by Javier Camaras (Im so excited and Chefs Special) he is ugly, lame and single and lives at home on the farm. He is musically minded and inclined and still regrets not getting a break when he was invited to attend the conservatoire  oh and he has thee most fab comb over, ever.  Then a woman finally turns up who he thinks might actually have more than the time of day for him. This is Nati (Carmen Machi  -The skin I live in and Im so excited) who is one of lifes optimists  her glass is always half full, despite being a tad accident prone.

Nati is also already married and it just happens to be to Eliseos brother. Throw in his friends form the band an endearing lesbian who wants to get impregnated a super, cool village priest and a cow beauty contest and you have all the ingredients for a very warm and quite often funny comedy.

This is from Director Nacho G. Vellila famous for the aforementioned Chefs Special  which is ruddy excellent- and he has taken a beautifully contrived and original plot and made a very engaging film. I like it when people who are not matinee idol, good looking, type stars get to have the limelight as it is a better refection of real life. Beauty can be only skin deep, but true beauty is always on the inside and this great little film shows  all of that just in just the right way. Yes there is over acting, yes it is in Spanish, yes it has a predictable ending  but it put a smile on my face, made me laugh and left me wanting more  highly recommended.",1388016000,2,1635,4.245161290322581
