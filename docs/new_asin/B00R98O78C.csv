6925218,2,B00R98O78C,"I wasn't going to buy this but I got curious.
I read a fairly wide range of opinions on this and wanted to see for myself.
This is fairly early Verdi so it has a lot of potential, but right from the beginning it was clear that the conductor, Nicola Luisotti was glossing over many of the nuances that are so rewarding in this work. There is not the level of tension, pulse and mystery that we are used to.
The recorded sound didn't bring out the textures, the orchestra was clumped together, as was true for the chorus as well. Even the best chorus and orchestra can sound like this when they are not given proper leadership, and recording. Pity. The sound also tended to sound overloaded because the elements weren't balanced. And the ""sung-to-death"" chorus got loud way too quickly and was missing nuance.
It is true that Domingo doesn't display the vocal volume that this role needs (especially in such a large house,) but his tone and pitch were steady and quite good, and it was clear that he and Robert Lloyd were the singers who knew how to inhabit a role on the stage. They moved appropriately and looked at the other characters.
As far as the other singers were concerned, this might have been a concert presentation - they moved little, did not interact often with each other and tended to just face the audience and sing. I questioned whether they knew what they were singing, or had learned it phonetically.
The Abigaille does have a large and suitable voice, but she does not inhabit the role. Abigaille is one of the great dramatic soprano roles, and it benefits from some chewing of scenery. Not here.
Same is true for the other roles here. No bad voices, but it really wasn't ""sold"" which early Verdi needs.

The costumes were drab 1930s thrift store for no good reason.
The stage was a sand floor with plain beige square stucco columns. How evocative of ancient Jerusalem and Babylon!
It reinforced the feeling that this was a last-minute semi-staged production. It was directed by Daniele Abbado.

I have recently seen two other strong productions of Nabucco, one on C Major (Tutto Verdi) with Nucci, Theodossiou and Zannellato (Mariotti) that easily surpasses this one, and my favorite production on Dynamic with Gazale, Neves and Anastassov (Frizza). Abigaille is one of the few Verdi roles that Susan Neves recorded and it is most enjoyable. All the major singers are great, as is the production, top to bottom.
It's also available in a bargain collection from Dynamic of 6 Verdi operas.
Every time I try to play Neves sing Abigaille's big aria I wind up playing the video to the end. And then I have to go back to see the first part...",1434240000,15,2657,4.627118644067797
6925219,5,B00R98O78C,"Director Daniele Abbado, son of the great conductor, was tasked with creating a new NABUCCO for the Royal Opera House's celebration of Verdi's bicentenary in 2013. Alison Chitty's designs tend toward minimalism. During the overture, the video release cuts away from the pit to give us our first glimpse of the set that will dominate the first half of the opera, an ambiguous cluster of rectangular polystyrene blocks that at first suggests a modern city skyline. When the action begins, soloists and choristers position themselves around, between, and in front of these, and they become clearer as monuments or totems, the representation of the temple. The blocks are upended when the temple is ransacked. The opera's second half introduces mesh sculptures erected in worship of Baal, and these too are (symmetrically) destroyed in the final scene. Abbado's production is not true Regietheater. It does not rethink NABUCCO and is quite conventional in action, theme, and character, but it is cosmetically updated to the 1940s, surely to make one think of the persecutions of Jewish resettlement and extermination. Ms. Chitty also designed the costumes, which are dressy suits, frocks, and hats in blacks, grays, whites, earth tones. I believe we are supposed to read them as ""drab,"" but they are conspicuously new-looking, not bespeaking oppression and suffering so much as churchgoing. Abbado imbues the scenes with urgency, and the choristers and supernumeraries are expressive. We are signaled that things are at stake, that we are watching drama rather than pageantry. The director also shows compassion for the character of Abigaille, who is not a leering villainess. She is not shunned in the final scene, but forgiven by Ismaele, Fenena, and Nabucco, the latter two attending to her, as if easing her final moments by welcoming her back into the family -- she was misguided and corrupted rather than evil. Some low-budget-looking projections throughout (depicting, for example, the advance of Nabucco and his army in Act I) add little to what the words and the live action are telling us, and are the production's biggest miscalculation.

Maestro Nicola Luisotti draws from the Royal Opera House's orchestra playing that is vigorous and taut, with details of shimmering beauty (e.g., the harp arpeggios with the chorus in Act One). He is collaborative in enabling the singers to be their best. With a decidedly senior divo in the title role, he takes the cabaletta of Act IV at a conservative pace, while super-charging the solos of a fire-breathing lead soprano in her prime. None of his soloists is less than good. Liudmyla Monastyrska's Abigaille is even better than her very fine Lady Macbeth for the same house (available on an Opus Arte DVD). There is nothing in the music of this perilous role that intimidates her -- she has the heft, the cut, the range, the agility -- and Abbado softens the character just enough that when she professes love for Ismaele, or claims to have often shed tears for others, it rings less hollow than it sometimes has in other productions. Not a natural actress, Monastyrska brings to her dramatic responsibilities the care that should come with a new production, and she is as three-dimensional an Abigaille as anyone would want. Mezzo Marianna Pizzolato is a more stolid presence and makes less of an impression with Fenena early on than she might have, but does her best work where it counts most, in the aria and the ensemble of the final act. Andrea Car brings to Ismaele a glorious sound, magnetism and machismo, and the old-school italianit in regrettably short supply today (he was a late Pavarotti pupil). His exciting performance, the best surprise on the disc, makes the listener want to seek him out in a larger role. Vitalij Kowaljow is a mild-mannered Zaccaria. The voice sits in the right place for the often-high-lying writing, but he has less star power than some of the singers around him, and so the character recedes. Robert Lloyd, who sang the High Priest of Baal as a young bass on the celebrated Muti/EMI recording, reprises the role 35 years later as an old bass.

Of course, this performance probably was given a cinema broadcast and a DVD release because of the participation of Plcido Domingo, now in his seventies and several years into a tour of major Verdi baritone roles. This chapter of his career has been controversial and uneven, and I was left without much good to say of his recent attempts at the Count di Luna (Berlin and Salzburg) and the ERNANI Don Carlo (Met). Nabucco, happily, is a better fit. To go along with this casting, we must be willing to accept the sound of a dark-toned tenor whose range has shrunk with age, rather than a true baritone. But the part has often been filled on recordings and in live performances by renowned baritones well past their best -- Gobbi, Cappuccilli, Nucci --  and Domingo here still makes a compelling sound and has the indefinable divo quality. When he struts on stage in the first act, he takes possession of it. We have heard good singing until then, *great* singing where Monastyrska and Car are concerned, but now the star has arrived. Domingo understands every word of what he sings, in arias, duets, and ensembles and in expressively inflected recitative, and his enactments of the king's hubris, undoing, madness, and remorse are vivid and ultimately inspiring of empathy. In Domingo's lesser quasi-baritone performances of recent years, I have sometimes wondered for how long a singer who has been at the top of his profession for so long can content himself with giving performances that make listeners say the singing is impressive ""for a man of his age."" Here, he supplies enough to give a valid center to a strong production.

There are two short supplements. In the first, Luisotti and chorus director Renato Balsadonna discuss the opera's cultural significance and the supremacy of the chorus's role in it. Balsadonna describes this youthful work as ""Verdi's first masterpiece"" (too generous?). Luisotti is animated and likable, enthusiastically demonstrating the attack he wants in a passage for the chorus, and singing a bit of ""Va, pensiero"" himself (rather well) for the camera. In the second feature, Domingo and Monastyrska rehearse their third-act duet with piano and talk about the challenges of their roles. For a performance with a true baritone as Nabucco, my alternative would be the 1986 Muti/Scala (on Kultur) starring Renato Bruson and Ghena Dimitrova, its uninteresting stage production and dated technical properties notwithstanding. The ROH's new disc is, on the whole, an attractive and worthy entry to the field.",1429833600,19,6673,5.025293586269196

8694633,1,B00R98O78C,"As many others have noted, this is one of the most visually ugly productions ever committed to Blu-ray, possibly THE most.

One would think, if Domingo has been doing what he's doing 60 years now, or maybe only 49 years if you only want to count 'big-time' (1968 is when he made his Met debut) ... by now he would know what works and what doesn't work with an opera.  He would know what the expectations are, what the consumers like, etc.  And, one would think somewhere along the way, he would have learned to say 'no', occasionally.  But I don't think he has learned.  Whatever they lay in front of him, he doesn't hesitate, he just gobbles it up.

Well, that's his right, of course.  But today is the day the Met is doing their 'summer encore' of Nabucco with Domingo, in movie theaters around the country.  And that is a beautiful, traditional production.  And I think there will be armies of fans who will (rightly) be enthralled, and go rush out to Amazon to grab this one as a souvenir.

8694636,5,B00R98O78C,Domingo was so convincing as a stooped old man that after the opera when I turned to the extras it came as a shock to see Domingo transformed into a virile young man of 74 with white hair.  And it was wonderful to see the great Robert Lloyd at 75.  It's true the costumes and sets were a disappointment but the production as a whole was powerful and deeply disturbing.  A performance not to be missed.  ~ Celeste Downey,1468108800,,419,4.265822784810126
8694637,1,B00R98O78C,"I would give 100 stars to Pl&aacute;cido's moving performance of Nabucco but I am furious for him to have done it in this horrible and dirty production. One can not tell who is hebrew and who is babylonian since they are alll dressed alike. The opera loses its meaning and magnificence and one can not
even appreciate the fabulous voice of Abigaille because she also looks so ugly as everybody else. This is the worst DVD opera of all the thousands that I have bought and seen.",1461110400,5,477,4.494252873563219
8694638,4,B00R98O78C,"This is my second DVD with Domingo in a baritone range and I am pleased to say the difference is negligible
the inimitable Domingo sound is intact,  Abigaille,  Ludmyla Mostyrska, practically steals the show, and so does the Fenena, Marianna Pizzolato.  Musically, it cannot get any better.  Unfortunately the production is a mess.  Everyone is wearing 40's dark costumes and hairdos,
not a shred of color anyway.  I did get that the onstage action meant to suggest  the persecutions during the Holocaust.  But when the Assyrians attack they look exactly like their victims, which makes for some really messy confusion.  Poor Domingo, in a business suit, looks like a traveling salesman.  Ths opera NEEDS the pomp of royalty, but the production is bereft of it.  An interesting aside:  everyone knows Verdi wanted to write a ""King Lear"" but never did.  WELL, I THINK THIS IS IT!  Besotted old man with two daughters! On the other hand, I came to see Abigaille as the embodiment  of  class resentment, go figure.",1442534400,7,1011,4.893491124260355
8694639,5,B00R98O78C,This is a very moving opera with wonderful music all throughout.  Definitely a 5 star !,1440460800,2,87,4.4375
8694640,5,B00R98O78C,"NABUCCO may be Verdi's first masterpiece, and not just because of that amazing Chorus of Hebrews which is justly beloved by everyone who hears it. Dramatically, this opera is tightly constructed, with believable characters in an intense conflict over values and beliefs. And Verdi's music, however early in his career, however distant from triumphs like LA FORSA DEL DESTINO or AIDA, is highly animated, revealing inner turmoil and outer passions with beauty and economy. The ensembles are especially impressive, building to satisfying heights of emotional release for the singers and the audience. And Placido Domingo is a wonder to behold and hear. Even though his original voice was baritone, which he managed to transform into a tenor voice, he doesn't SOUND like a baritone to me. B-U-T his performance is so committed, so deeply interfused with Verdi's music, so generously integrated to the younger singers around him, that the waters part.  I know and love other recordings of this opera, but this version will henceforth be my chosen vehicle. The staging and directing do justice to the tragic seriousness of the plot. Like Verdi's music, it is economical but impressive. The costumes seem to evoke the 1930s or 1940s, which provides a sense of subsequent history that enhances the events in the libretto. For a life-long lover of Verdi like myself, this production was a revelation of wonders and two hours plus of operatic splendor and bliss.",1438387200,9,1453,5.1308016877637135
