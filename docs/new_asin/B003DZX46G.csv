4112433,5,B003DZX46G,"Family Guy Volume 8
15 Episodes on 3 Discs being released June 15, 2010

""Family Guy"" continues with Volume 8 which is a collection of fifteen episodes including the infamous ""Road to the Multiverse"" Brian and Stewie special that kicked off that run taking the Family Guy cast through a series of different worlds and different types of animation like Hanna Barbara ""The Flintstones"" style, ""Robot Chicken"" clamation style, block people, the family as dogs, and the graceful Disney style with the song, ""It's a Wonderful Day for Pie"" that gets stuck in my head with regularity.

The uncensored version allows for swearing and shockingly Peter's exposed private parts in the episode with the Kathy Ireland cardboard stand-up, ""Family Goy."" Other gems in this bunch are the story of Peter's past life as a founder of the Quahog colony, the condensed re-telling of Stephen King stories: ""Stand By Me"", ""Misery"", and ""The Shawshank Redemption"", Quagmire as a dad, the Star Trek: The Next Generation cast hanging out with Stewie, and a ""Spies Like Us"" spin-off featuring the actual voices of Chevy Chase and Dan Dan Aykroyd.

In this set, the evolution of ""Family Guy"" has led to an increase in live-action style camera angles over the shoulder while characters are talking, digital animation, and more fancy computer sequences. The comedic timing is as sharp as ever, the cut-aways more random and hilarious, and the songs are very catchy.

Bonus Features:

There is commentary on almost every episode by Seth MacFarlane, writers, directors, producers, and other cast members. There are also a bunch of deleted scenes and a full script for the episode ""Road to the Multiverse"" featuring pencil sketches of some of the characters!

The Road to Road to the Multiverse featurette talks about the episode being another ""Road To"" Brian and Stewie adventure and how the premise was like the sci-fi television show ""Sliders"" where the characters would ""slide"" to different dimensions all the time. They talk about how they grabbed Disney animators to gain authenticity for the ""Wonderful Day for Pie"" scene.

One of my favorite bonus features is Family Guy karaoke where you can literally follow the bouncing ball to the lyrics of Family Guy songs: ""Gotta Give Up the Toad"", ""Left Foot, Right Foot"", ""Road to Rhode Island"", ""Hic-A-Doo-La"", ""You've Got A Lot To See"", ""My Fat Baby Loves To Eat"", ""You Do!"", ""You And I Are So Awfully Different"", ""Buy Me A Rainbow"", ""You Have AIDS"", ""The FCC Song"", ""When We Swing"", ""Shipoopi"", ""Noble Indian Chief"", ""(In God's Eyes) Everybody's Hot"", ""This Is One Fine Day To Be Nude"", ""Evil Monkey Song"", ""My Black Son"", ""Drunken Irish Dad"", ""Prom Night Dumpster Baby"", ""Sodomy"", ""Me & Jesus"", ""I Like Farts"", ""G-Chord"", ""The Handi-Quacks Theme Song"", ""The Pot Song"", ""The Friendship Song"", and finally ""It's a Wonderful Day for Pie."" I highly recommend hitting Play All.",1277078400,,2893,5.0271398747390394
4112434,4,B003DZX46G,"I have been a fan of the show since it's ORIGINAL debut after the Super Bowl in 1999.

Course, how they have done the DVD releases it is NOT right that you can NOT get a complete season in 1 DVD package.

The episodes in this DVD are NOT up to normal ""Family Guy"" standards.  No stand out episodes.  Only a couple of episodes ""Fox-y Lady"" & ""Brian's Got A Brand New Bag"" have jokes I want to rewind to see again.

Uncensored.  Unlike when they just slapped curse words in ""The Empire Strikes Back"" straight to video release where most of the curse words were just there because they could get away with it but they did NOT work.  In Volume 8 they do work & go along with the story script.

Of these episodes notable for me ""Three Kings"" with the ""Star Wars"" figurine bit & of course Richard Dreyfess & the late Roy Scheider together again for the ""Jaws"" references.  This episode aired of course after Roy's death in 2008. ""Family Goy"" episode has 2 ""Star Wars"" saga references & also an ""Indiana Jones"" reference.  The ""Spies Like Us"" episode ""Spies Reminiscent Of Us"" good idea for an episode & good to see Dan & Chevy were used.

Now, we can complain again the DVD makers went cheap with the horrible plastic cases.  You have an episode list but not like in the older DVD releases you get NO information on that episode.  Cheap plastic disc holders.

Normal extras on the DVD package.",1276992000,6,1387,4.3671875
4112435,4,B003DZX46G,"There are two different ""special"" edition packages that I'm aware of. There is the Target version with a bonus disc of Seth at some convention talking and there's the Best Buy version that has a bonus disc of 4 Stewie-Only shows. While there's nothing new with the Stewie-only shows, the Best Buy version does offer their disc which includes digital versions of the episodes. Even though the episodes are just older episodes (nothing new unfortunately), I find the Best Buy version with their bonus disc a little more useful than the Target version with a bonus commentary disc.

As for the episodes, the shows aren't quite what they used to be. I'm a die hard fan of Family Guy so I was going to get this set one way or the other regardless of the reviews about the set. While the set does offer some funny episodes, they don't quite capture the zing that the first 2-3 seasons had. This is expected since you can't be fresh ALL the time. Just look at The Simpsons for example.

Overall though, I enjoyed this set just like all the other sets before it so no real complaints. Only issue is with Fox trying to nickel and dime fans by releasing half seasons on DVD for over the top prices.",1276819200,,1188,4.470046082949309
4112436,4,B003DZX46G,"I highly recommend purchasing Family Guy Volume 8 from Target so you get the Target exclusive bonus disc. That have it at the store and online just make sure it is the Target exclusive because they sell both. The bonus disc features the ""Seth MacFarlane & Friends"" panel discussion from the 2010 PaleyFest. Its a great set, and all though it may not be the best season it isn't bad. If your a fan of Family guy, I recommend picking it up.",1276732800,5,438,4.353658536585366
4112437,3,B003DZX46G,"Look at this point if you're still going to complain how the show is not funny since the earlier seasons I can't blame you, in fact I agree with you. I think Family Guy has gone a little downhill yes but I still like it for what it is. Besides I think most customers visiting this page are actually interested in this volume DVD, the episodes it contains and they should know what to expect out of those 3 discs. If you're just here to complain well beat it, it's just a television show right? Maybe it's not as funny to you but I still get a good laugh out of watching the show and think it's still more entertaining than most of what is on television right now. Vol 8 has the seven remaining episodes of season 7 and the first eight of season 8 for a total of 15 episodes.

Here are all of the episodes on Vol. 8:
1. FOX-y Lady
2. Not All Dogs Go To Heaven
3. 420
4. Stew-Roids
5. We Love You, Conrad
6. Three Kings
7. Peter's Progress
8. Road To The Multiverse
9. Family Goy
10. Spies Reminiscent of Us
11. Brian's Got a Brand New Bag
12. Hannah Banana
13. Quagmire's Baby
14. Jerome is the New Black
15. Dog Gone

It seems that even if some fans of the show didn't enjoy this season as much as the others ones they generally agree that there are a few great episodes on Vol 8 such as ""Road To The Multiverse"" and ""Stew-Roids"".  I also liked ""Quagmire's Baby"" and ""Three Kings"". I don't think Family Guy is done just yet but if they don't do something soon then it could be the end of the show. Fans brought the show out of cancellation and could very well put it back to that status. I don't think vol 9 will be that much better as I've seen most of those episodes ( ""Brian & Stewie"" was just a painful one to watch).

And yes they still haven't done anything about the ""volumes"" DVD and you don't get a full season here, it's disappointing but that's what they've been doing since season 4 when they decided to split a season in two DVD's boxed set and I guess it's what Fox will continue to do so for future DVD releases. Yes I've bought this DVD even if I'd like actual season sets to be released because I enjoy Family Guy. I just wish they wouldn't charge as much for only 15 episodes in a cheap package, basically the same as season 7's, I also hope they don't discontinue the DVD version with the cover on it like they did for season 7 after a while that was just disappointing. There are still some good episodes on this Volume DVD, the show is not what it once was but it's still decent. 3 stars.",1276732800,55,2509,4.114285714285714
4112438,3,B003DZX46G,"Most long-time viewers are aware that FAMILY GUY is not what it once was.  It used to be irreverent, hilarious, off-color; it still is all those things, but now the humor is forced and self-aware.  I direct your attention to the scrolling text of SOMETHING, SOMETHING DARK SIDE for proof (and the fact that this hour-long episode, available on DVD for months, was used as the finale for the most recent season).

Still, all is not lost, as this collection shows.  ""Road to the Multiverse"" is clever, with some classic FAMILY GUY moments.  ""Three Kings"" is one of my personal favorite episodes, not merely because I'm a Stephen King fan, but because the first segment (""Stand By Me"") is reminiscent of everything that once made FAMILY GUY great.  Other episodes included here are great, though some--I'm looking at you, ""420""--merely showcase Seth MacFarlane's ever-increasing ego.  Ultimately, the show is still a strong point, and one of the few reasons to turn on your television.  It's still going downhill, of course, and fans will probably discard it in the next season or two.  But this collection still contains some genuinely funny episodes, and even a few thoughtful moments (though not as many as there used to be).",1276646400,,1225,4.907766990291262
4112439,2,B003DZX46G,"I like the early Family Guy seasons. They had a certain 'edge' to them that was refreshing and funny. The show got cancelled and then it came back worse than it was. I think Family Guy has run it's course. Like another reviewer stated, all that's left of the show it seems are a series of pop culture references and bawdy humor that more often than not, isn't funny. There doesn't seem to be much of a story to any of the episodes anymore. It's usually a thin premise to have stupid jokes and offensive physical 'humor.' There are a couple of episodes that are enjoyable in this set, but most are just the same old, tired formula.

And I think Matt Groening needs to watch a few because some of the storylines and jokes seem lifted right out of past Simpson's episodes. I enjoy watching reruns of the earliest Family Guy seasons, but the newest ones just do nothing for me. My advice is to check out 'American Dad' where there are actual stories to be had and laughs abound.",1276646400,10,974,4.3812154696132595
4112440,2,B003DZX46G,"Family Guy is clearly on its last legs. While previous seasons were somewhat clever, this season goes all out on mindless pop culture references, toilet humor, and just plain offensive ""humor"" if you can call it that. By that I mean in many episodes, it seems as if the writers are trying to be blatantly offensive, sometimes without a joke attached. This is not saying that humor can't be offensive. Some of my favorite shows are The Boondocks, American Dad, South Park, and formally Family Guy.

The reason I didn't give this 1 star is because of a few episodes that are still pretty funny, such as Road to Multiverse, Stew-Roids, Quagmire's Baby, and Brian's Got a Brand New Bag. These have the funniest moments on the DVD with humor that is not just offensive or a reference to something, but combine everything Family Guy is famous for, and doing it well!

However,I have almost no hope left for this show, as the parts of Season 8 left out of the DVD for Volume 9, are even worse than these. Whereas in some of the episodes in Seasons 7 and 8, I plain just got bored, the episode Brain and Stewie just pissed me off. I know I'm know the only one that hopes that FOX and Seth MacFarlane can lay this dead horse to rest, instead of repeatedly beating it.",1276128000,13,1258,4.441558441558442
4112441,4,B003DZX46G,"I have loved Family Guy since it first came out.  It kind of dulled out a little in the 4th and 5th season, but came back with a vengence (along with South Park).  Looking forward to this release, but I still can't understand why they didn't/can't release this as seasons...much less in consistent number of disc's and episode's.

Now I understand that season 3 had a lot of episodes...but that should be where volumes come in (which is standard with most other releases, i.e. 'Season 3, vol. 1, Season 3, vol. 2...or even Season 2.1 and 2.5 or something).

Glad to see American Dad is back as well.  Keep it comming Seth!",1275609600,3,622,4.517857142857143

4112505,4,B003DZX46G,"I guess it's par for the course, being the show that Family Guy is. I'm one of those people who sees enough violence on the news, and hears a lot of profanity in real life, that I prefer to watch the show in its televised format, which thankfully, is still available on the discs. I know, I sound like one of those few oddball fans, and you're probably thinking, ""Well, why do you watch the show, then?"" Because I do enjoy a lot of the sight gags and the humor. I love Seth MacFarlane's 80's references and Star Wars parodies, too. It's just that sometimes he goes a bit too far with the subject matter, so I either just look away, or like I said, watch the televised versions. I still enjoy the show, I just feel that he's taken a lot of liberties with the franchise now, and what he can do with it. Here's a sample of the episodes listed on the discs: Fox-y Lady, Lois gets a job newscasting for FOX, We Love You Conrad, Brian dates Lauren Conrad, Family Goy, Peter discovers that Lois is Jewish, and Hannah Banana, Stewie and Brian find out that Miley Cyrus is not all that she appears to be. I do like the show, I just wish that the violence wasn't so extreme sometimes. There's even an episode that I'm surprised there wasn't a PETA uprising because of it. Yes, it's THAT bad. I don't watch that one anymore. In case you're wondering, it's Episode 420. It's one scene, but still....",1367366400,,1387,4.318007662835249

The show needs more of that.

4112549,5,B003DZX46G,"I've read far too many reviews of ""Family Guy volume 8"" that claim to it be everything from ""the sad cousin"" to a ""severe dissapointment."". I can't agree and I say this after three viewings- a different mood and different room for each viewing.

Now I've always enjoyed the brilliance of Seth McFarland and ""Family Guy"" but it never really rose above the status of Saturday Night Live in regard to social commentary and humor. Now keep in mind that I am 49 years old so that SNL to me is the Hey Day when Lorne Michaels had the clout to tell NBC execs to shut up and they all ignored the smell of pot coming off the 14th floor of 30 Rock. But ""Family Guy 8"" Is indeed different than it's previous works. It isn't that it is of lower quality however - far from it - it is that it is of a much higher quality than has ever been achieved before. There are many, many inside jokes, but plenty for everyone. Certainly the better informed you are the more you will laugh at these jokes. The characters remain REAL Characters because we continue to love them. Not one of you hasn't formed deep opinions of Brian, Stewie, Peter Lois and even poor Chris and Meg.

But Family Guy is, at last, not just taking pot shots at the problems within our socio-political climate, but they're pointing out ways in which things could be better. Little Stewie, requiring a diaper change has more common sense than King George did during his entire presidency. And Stewie's anger is really what ours SHOULD be. This volume pokes fun at everyone, including ""Family Guy"" and Seth McFarland himself. But if you failed to notice that it was also poking light fun at YOU, then you're likely to give this a medicore review. And you have missed the best part of this DVD set.

Me? Well I can take it. I can laugh at myself aznd I have no qualms about learning about myself and self-improvement. I think it's healthy to re-think about socio-political events and when a cartoon character can do this for me, well they damn well blow""The FLintstones"" or ""the Simpsons"" out of the water.

This one's the best so far, folks. Trust me. And for those of you who reviewed it so quickly, go back and watch it again and again. You'll grow wiser each time and you will laugh every time; laughter is the best way to learn. No expense has been spared, from the hiring of the beswt Hollywood starss, to the copyrights to classic Broadway Melodies for re-writing. Whomever does the sindie lyric writing there could give a run to Steve Sondheim. When Brian presents a very smart and logical reason to legalize pot, McFarland counters it with enough to think about as to why ity's illegal. (Not that Brian doesn't return to his drinking problem.)

Thank you, Mr. McFarland and the folks at Fuzzy Door.",1300579200,,2754,4.489021956087824

4112564,4,B003DZX46G,"Family Guy is one of those shows famous for randomly flipping your lid. Always the unexpected is discussed and said on everything from ""prom night dumpster babies"" to matricide (on the part of Stewie of course). Now this eigth volume of Family Guy does contain many episodes such as the Miley Cyrus send up ""Hannah Banana"". But possibly because series creator Seth MacFarlane was at this point preparing to launch the first major Family Guy spinoff&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Cleveland-Show/dp/B002JVWQYG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Cleveland Show</a>(the first season of which ran almost paralell to this) he decided it was time to change some of the focus of this show. With episodes such as ""Fox-Y Lady"",""Episode 420"" and ""Family Goy"" there is a concerted attempt to steer this show from less comic satire towards more impassioned social commentary. Where the subjects of Fox News,legalized marjuana and religion would've been the object of tremendous random comedy in the past the treatments of them in this season tend to be more serious to the point of being even mildly preachy. The episodes are all very well written and done but it's a different approch to Family Guy. Of course the concept that Michael Moore and Rush Limbaugh are both characters portrayed by Fred Savage is CLASSIC Seth MacFarlane!

  Also of note in this season is the large amount of ""Brian having romantic issues"" episodes there are. In this season he's portrayed far more in a dysfunctional manner than he was in previous seasons;as a severe alcohalic with shallow views on women and it all culminates in one very compelling scene where Quagmire,a character only portrayed as a one dimentional sex fiend until this point,actually explains VERY intelligently and with intense detail the reasons for his dislike of Brian,of which we all knew nothing about until this time. Quagmire is another character changed during this season. With the  absent Cleavland the ensamble dynamic among Peter's friends and wild antics aren't as evident and Quagmire's character is altered to show what a dysfunctional and tormented character he actually is underneath his sexually devient behavior. Of course this also has one of the series most inventive and hilarious moments in ""Road To The Multiverse"" episode,which is a sure fire highlite of the season as well and also a reminder of the things we liked about Family Guy to start with.

  Being this all is fairly recent in terms of age it's unclear even now where Family Guy is going. Starting here there seems to be attempts to turn the show toward a more ""dramedy"" direction,giving characters this very weighty sense of depth and dimension that may tend to take a bit away from the shows comic irreverence and wildness. Sort of reminds me of one time in an earlier season where Peter speaks of MASH ""before Alan Alda took over and the show got all dramatic and preachy"". I don't think Family Guy has gotton that way yet exactly and those elements could be mere growing pains while the writers of the show try to deal with the departure of a major character but we'll have to see from here on where the series goes.",1295222400,,3189,5.074427480916031

4112566,3,B003DZX46G,"The episodes on volume 8 are funny, but for me the show really started going downhill at volume five.  That said, I do still like it, but I don't see the show lasting too much longer, at least being watchable.  I also agree with what was said in an earlier review, Gay Stewie is NOT funny anymore, I miss when Stewie was all about trying to kill Lois and world domination. Somehow the writers manage to keep the show just funny enough to make me keep buying, but I don't laugh out loud as much as I used to and lots of the jokes are just not funny or just in bad taste. Its kinda sad that some of the funniest recent FAMILY GUY moments were when they were on the CLEVELAND SHOW (which completely sucks by the way).

Love the show and will continue to watch, but I'll skip actualy paying for it.",1290988800,,349,4.0
4112568,4,B003DZX46G,"I'm rating this product 5 stars, because it is home to some of Family Guy's greatest moments, such as ROAD TO THE MULTIVERSE. This very clever episode centers around Brian and Stewie traveling through a series of parallel universes. The Disney universe is my favorite, especially the twist at the end... All in all, this episode is the best in the set.

That is not to say that the set is bad. Most people complaining are ignorant enough to complain about only getting 13 episodes, and really say nothing about the material you're getting when you buy. All in all, think about this- A movie is roughly an hour and a half, which rounds up to four episodes. By volume, when you do the math, you're paying less for a lot more entertaiment than you would be if you bought a few movies.

Some of the episodes aren't even worth watching, though. I hate to admit that Family Guy isn't what it used to be, but then again, they've surpassed the 150 episode mark. They're holding up pretty well given the circumstances.

Okay, now onto the review.
THE PRODUCT: Since Volume 7, they've dropped the idea of the fat boxes with three or four slim cases in them. Now, it's one box, and NO DESCRIPTION OF THE EPISODE, the names of the episodes are printed on the inner side of the cover page, visible through the clear case. This is kind of an annoyance given that most episode titles are vague. However, you can just google the scene that you remembered, and there are many sites that have the full-on script of the episode available to help you find the right one.

The theme of the disc and box are from the episode PETER'S PROGRESS, where Cleveland's cousin is a fortune-teller and tells the story of Peter's past, where he was 'Griffin Peterson' and so on. Great episode, by the way. However, the theme of the actual programming and display of the series on disc is that of the ROAD TO THE MULTIVERSE.

The third disc contains a lot of extras, such as Deleted Scenes (which are just as good, if not better, than some of the bits in the episode.)

The set comes with a mock script from ROAD TO THE MULTIVERSE, which is cool to have.

THE EPISODES:
I won't touch down on every episode, but I'll give you the general idea of the set.

If you want descriptions of each episode, go to Wikipedia. There are also several Family Guy fan sites that can give you the full synopsis.

THE GOOD:
These are worth the buy. Hands down.
ROAD TO THE MULTIVERSE
QUAGMIRE'S BABY
JEROME IS THE NEW BLACK
420
PETER'S PROGRESS

THE MIDDLE:
These are good time wasters, but not really all that funny.
THREE KINGS
BRIAN'S GOT A BRAND NEW BAG
HANNAH BANANA
DOG GONE
NOT ALL DOGS GO TO HEAVEN
WE LOVE YOU, CONRAD
FOX-Y LADY

THE BAD:
Not even worth the watch.
SPIES REMNICIENT OF US
FAMILY GOY
STEW-ROIDS

If I've forgotten any, they probably belong in the middle section.

Anyway, I hope this helps.
Try to buy it at a discounted price, but also realize that you may not get the script in the box, which is very cool to have.

4112572,2,B003DZX46G,"After watching volume 8, I think I'm done with buying Family Guy sets. I may still rent them from Netflix or something, but I'm glad I waited until the price came down into the mid-twenties on this one before buying it.

Family Guy has gone downhill, and badly. What used to be a show that made me burst out laughing in most of its episodes has degenerated into something where the most I'll get out of it is a chuckle and a sense of anger about what these guys have started thinking is funny. To the writers: graphic violence isn't funny. Why is there so much of it? For the record, I liked the graphically violent movie Hot Fuzz, so it isn't the gore per se that bothers me. It's that they try to play it for laughs, and I can't think of a single time that it hasn't been way more gross than funny (incidentally, this is one of the reasons I don't enjoy South Park as much as I could). Even bits that I thought were funny, like the guy who eats the Peppermint Pattie and has to make an arduous journey back home from the frozen mountain top, include this garbage for no reason. When that one ended with the guy engaging in graphic cannibalism, I think I might have even said out loud, ""And we're back to this s@#! again.""

Evil Stewie was much funnier than Gay Stewie. Goofy Jerk Peter was much funnier than Completely Stupid Peter. When I watch some of the older episodes, I still laugh out loud, often. Even some of the jokes that I didn't think were all that great back then seem like comedy gold compared to most of the junk in this series.

To top it off, the show has become almost unbearably preachy. The episodes about legalizing pot and where Meg finds religion didn't even seem like they were *trying* to be funny. They just felt like somebody on a soapbox ranting. At least when South Park gets preachy (one of the other big reasons I don't like that show), they keep the jokes going. It's telling and sad that one of my favorite moments of this DVD series was when Quagmire lays into Brian and enumerates the many ways that he's a complete jerk.

I'm giving this two stars instead of one because there are still some sparks of funny left in the show. But if they can't do better than this, then maybe it's time to hang it up and move on.",1287014400,27,2251,4.276995305164319

Yes, Family Guy has changed over the years, just like any show must in order to survive, but it is still very funny... much funnier than anything else on TV. The show continues to take on current topics and controversial topics. Like others have said here i wish that they would sell the seasons as a single season not half seasons.

My only real complaint about the set is in the ""Family Goy"" episode there is a VERY uncensored moment... you get to see ALL of Peter... including his peter. I have no problem with the scene... I just wish I had know it was comming... My kids (who are all teenagers) were watching it with me and i wish that i had warning, but I expect nothing safe from FG.

I hope the show continues on... I love it and can't wait for the next dvd set to come out.",1282089600,,827,4.19496855345912
4112586,5,B003DZX46G,This set has all the best episodes from Stewie roiding it up to Quagmire becoming a father for an episode.  All in all it ranges from decent in a couple episodes to rofl in a few.  Definitely one to get for the collection.  And I have them all.,1281744000,,244,4.041666666666667
4112587,5,B003DZX46G,We love this Volume and HIGHLY recommend it to any FG fan. The unedited edition shows you the way the episode was meant to be seen.  Lots of extras are included.,1281398400,,161,4.193548387096774

4112589,5,B003DZX46G,"I bought this for my boyfriend for his 34th Birthday. Of course, this is NOT for kids, but the adults in my household LOVE Family Guy. Volume 8 did not dissapoint. We have collected each volume and love sitting up after the kids have gone to bed and having a good laugh. Family Guy is not to be taken seriously and not to be watched by the easily-offended. It is hilarious, smart, witty, raunchy fun.",1280707200,,400,4.346666666666667

4112593,3,B003DZX46G,"This volume is slightly better than 7, but it is still a far cry from what Family Guy used to be.  The few clever lines and gags are buried in ridiculous segments and storylines.  The Star Trek actors segment is just silly.  There is nothing clever or funny about it.  They have a 50 year old woman talking and acting like someone who would've been dead for most likely the last 20 years.  Decent episodes like ""Not All Dogs Go To Heaven,"" ""Peter's Progress,"" and ""Hannah Banana"" are ruined by crummy endings.  One episode that is very clever and original is ""Road to the Multiverse.""  ""We Love You Conrad"" is another good one mainly because I like the air-headed Jillian character.  ""Three Kings"" is a fun change of pace and ""Dog Gone"" has its moments (good ones as well as head-scratching ones).  ""Stew-roid"" and ""Jerome Is the New Black"" are the better ones from the mediocre rest.  When a clip showing the Flintmobile on the World's Wildest Police Chases is the highlight of a volume, that is pretty bad.

Disc 1
1. ""Fox-y Lady""--Lois becomes news anchor for Fox News and is put on an assignment to investigate Michael Moore.  Meanwhile, Peter and Chris collaborate on an animated show ""Handi-Quacks.""  When Lois was running with her Fox contract, I thought she was going to fall and hurt her knee, but it didn't quite go that way.
2. ""Not All Dogs Go To Heaven""--Peter: ""That's right folks, it's going to be a Meg episode.  Stick around for the fun...here's the clicker, no one would blame you.""  Meg is bedridden with the mumps and finds religion from Kirk Cameron's televangelist show.  Brian admits to being an atheist, so in the hopes to cure him, Meg blabs it on the news making Brian Quahog's enemy #1.  The ending where Meg and Brian patch things up is a bit too easy, I think, and the ending is stupid.  It might actually have worked with Bob Newhart and the wife from his first television show in bed ala the last episode of ""Newhart.""  Meanwhile, Stewie kidnaps the Star Trek cast.  That part is lame.  The actors act like kids (note: The actor who played Capt. Picard is the voice of Avery Bullock on American Dad, so the characters are the same).  This episode had potential with the atheist theme, but fell completely flat.
3. ""Episode 420""--Brian campaigns for the legalization of pot.  When Lois's father promises the publication of Brian's novel in exchange for him switching sides, will he sell out?
4. ""Stew-roid""--Joe's baby girl beats up Stewie so Peter pumps him up with steroids. Stewie: ""It doesn't matter how you find the pot of gold, all that matters is that you beat the leprechauns.""  Connie, the most popular girl in school, goes out with Chris as a challenge.  when he disses her and becomes a jerk like the popular guys, Connie and Meg concoct revenge.
5. ""We Love You Conrad""--I like the non-praying mantis (maybe he's an atheist).  Jillian is engaged to a great guy who speaks French (Jillian: ""He also speaks Orange!"" Derek: ""Mandarin, honey."" Jillian: ""Mandolin!"") and Brian is jealous even when he starts dating Lauren Conrad.

Disc 2
6. ""Three Kings""--The Family Guy characters parody Stephen King novels ""Stand By Me"" (with Meg as the dead body), ""Misery"" and ""The Shawshank Redemption."" Joe's character is crippled in each segment.  An OK change of pace but the ending to ""Misery"" was a bit weak.
7. ""Peter's Progress""--Madame Claude tells Peter and the gang who they were in a past life.  She tells the story of 17th or 18th century England when Peter was the founder of Quahog.  Lois's character is called Lady Redbush (ha!).  King Stewart the Turd exiles Griffin Peterson to America so he could marry Lois Redbush.  The ending was stupid.
8. ""Road to the Multiverse""--Clever episode where Brian and Stewie visit parallel universes that show Family Guy in such styles as The Flintstones, Robot Chicken, and Disney.
9. ""Family Goy""--Lois finds out her mother is Jewish.  At first Peter embraces Judaism until the spirit of his strict Catholic father tells him he will BURN!!! I n this uncensored episode, you get to see Peter's...um...peter.
10. ""Spies Reminiscent of Us""--Dan Aykroyd and Chevy Chase move into Cleveland's old house and Brian and Stewie find out they're actually spies.  Meanwhile, to prove he's funny, Peter and the gang start an improv act.  This episode is lame.
11. ""Brian Has a Brand New Bag""--This episode is embarrassingly bad.  Brian dates a 50 year old and his family gives him grief about it.  It makes no sense.  She was 50 in 2009 when the show aired, so she was born in 1959.  She spent her adolescence probably watching the Brady Bunch and her late teens at the discos.  She wouldn't use old fashioned words like ""chesterfield.""  They make her character as though she was born in the 1910s.  Ridiculous!

Disc 3
12. ""Hannah Banana""--Stewie has to see Miley Cyrus in concert and threatens Brian's brothers and sisters to get him in (that was pretty funny).  Chris captures the evil monkey and he becomes a father figure.  The end of the Miley Cyrus thing was a bit much.
13. ""Quagmire's Baby""--The Flintstone police chase clip might be the highlight of this entire volume.  Quagmire's baby girl is left on his doorstep and she is cramping his style.  Meanwhile, Stewie experiments with cloning.  The Quagmire/baby thing was unoriginal.
14. ""Jerome is the New Black""--The gang thinks they've found a replacement for Cleveland until Peter finds out he once slept with Lois. Also, Quagmire lets Brian have it!  Dang!
15. ""Dog Gone""--Brian is excited about being honored by the Rhode Island Society for Special Literary Excellence until he finds out the ""Special"" is for ""special ed.""  He gets drunk and hits and kills a dog.  He buries the carcass but is racked with guilt.  When he confesses, he is alarmed that no one cares and starts a movement for animal rights.  The meeting is lame.  They end up wanting to eat Brian, whatever!  Anyway, it is up to Stewie to make Brian see he has value to his family.  Meanwhile, Consuela (""need more lemon pledge"") becomes the Griffin's maid and drives Peter nuts.",1279411200,15,6076,4.750716332378223
4112594,1,B003DZX46G,"I've been watching the show since it premiered, and it was great in the beggining. I have the first 6 volumes, which are great. Volume 7 was ehh, but this is appaling. The show is not funny anymore, and it's basically all flashbacks. It's hard to even focus on the plot theres so many! Plus, I hate the way the characters have changed. Everybody hates meg, stewie is gay, brian is a pothead who can't keep a steady relationship, chris is just dumb as hell, peter is dumber than ever and not even funny, and lois in a nutcase. I never thought this show would jump the shark, but it sure has.",1279324800,10,590,4.276785714285714
4112595,3,B003DZX46G,"Family Guy, when on form, is the funniest show on television. However, this season is more inconsistent. Episodes like Road to the Multiverse and Quagmire's Baby are absolutely fantastic, but when the show manages to make the Buzzkillington joke (a joke about a man who kills a mood with bad jokes) old, the message is clear: the show is starting to run out of ideas.

Worth seeing for it's best moments, but there is a lot that pales in comparison.",1279238400,4,449,4.6125
4112596,1,B003DZX46G,"Content-wise, no complaints.

But I just received my 2nd replacement set yesterday, (3rd set overall).  On each set, Disc 2 has consistently caused a very-noticeable vibration from all players I tried, including Denon & Sony Blu-Ray players, and the DVD readers on 2 Lenovo laptops.  On one set, Discs 1 and 3 also caused a vibration, though not as bad as Disc 2.

I would love to watch this set as it has some incredibly funny episodes.  But until Fox gets this defect worked out, I'll do without.  I cannot subject my players to these defective discs.  Sooner or later, all that vibration would inevitably cause damage to the players, or at best, shorten their lifespans.",1279152000,6,673,4.75
4112597,4,B003DZX46G,"Family Guy has been one of my personal favorite shows of all time, I wish it could go on forever but I know one of these days it will end TV will become unbareable again. This new release contains the more recent episodes of family guy, primarily the 8th season. The show is still funny and the stories are becoming a bit better compared to a lot of the other new episodes. The improvement is in the writing and creativeness with some of the episodes. A good example would be the episode ""Road to Multiverse"" which is one of the greatest Family Guy episodes in recent years. I have noticed that the cursing in this show has become more relevant. Every episode on this set drops the F-Bomb at least once in every episode and its kinda weird that they think its become necessary now. I still think its a great buy if your a Family Guy fan (like me) but the price is a little ridiculous.",1278806400,6,884,4.299401197604791

But I am not writing about their quality, I am writing about how I am not to pleased that I purchased this DVD and got a Full-Screen Presentation. I have read that Seth MacFarlane doesn't believe that 16:9 is needed for his or any other show, but come on. At least make an attempt to stretch this. I would rather have a slightly, not as impressive picture, than to waste about 5 inches each side of my TV. (I know about the scan option, but it cuts off most of the picture on my television). I think Fox should at least try to explore added a widescreen version of Family Guy DVDs. I get this same thing on XBOX Live and it's just disappointing. If South Park can do it, I am sure Family Guy can make the attempt.

With that being said, I do like a lot of episodes on this Volume.",1277164800,2,974,3.9642857142857144
