8186459,1,B000OS3QZE,I don't know if it's good or not because it's VHS and I don't have a VCR. The one star rating has nothing to do with the actual video.,1371686400,,134,3.6551724137931036

8186462,4,B000OS3QZE,"I like that this exercise routine is well thought out and works different muscle groups each day - allowing some muscles to rest, while working others.  It is so great that it only takes less than 10  minutes per day for six days each week, so this can be a part of your larger workout routine, or it can be a stand alone exercise routine, and you will hit all your muscle groups each week.  Or you can double up and do it for 20 minutes per day, three days per week, alternating it with other types of exercise.

The negatives that you should be aware of are that it is designed to work with a HIGH END Total Gym.  Some of the exercises cannot be done on one of the cheap machines, and others can be done, but are extremely clumsey unless you have the Total Gym that retails for $1500.00 - $2000.00 and up.  If you have one of those Total Gyms that sell at Costco for around $300.00, be aware that you will either have to leave out some of the exercises, or you will have to alter them considerably, or you will have to buy one of the larger, more expensive Total Gym machines to get the most from this tape.

Overall, I love it!  It gets the job done with a minimum of time spent.  The expensive machine wasn't a problem for me because I scored a used, top of the line Total Gym on Craigslist for only $250.00 - and it had only been used 5 times.  So many people buy Total Gym machines, and don't really use them.  After the machines gather dust for around two years, they end up selling them for pennies on the dollar - and with a little patience, you could end up with a top notch machine for less than the cheap Costco price!",1302134400,3,1630,4.1265822784810124
8186463,4,B000OS3QZE,"When I purchased a Total Gym a few years ago, it included this video along with a flip chart, and the standard Total Gym video.  Since the standard program had plenty of exercises, including a beginning, intermediate, and advanced program, as well as supplemental exercises for special areas, I did not see a need to try yet another program.

As time went on, I found that performing the same exercises three times a week was not rewarding.  Adding new exercises added more benefit, but increased the program to the point that I did not stick with it.

Carleo's approach is different.  He has you exercise six days a week, and each day has a different program.  That way, the muscles still get a chance to rest as you switch areas each day, the length of the workout stays short, but you make far more progress than you expect.

As you do the different exercises, you realize that sticking with a single exercise for any muscle group does not prepare you well when using the same muscles in a different way.  This program is well rounded, and is short enough that you can stick with it.

The biggest problem with most exercise programs is that people bite off more than they can chew.  They have a sincere desire to stick with things, until at some point they miss a day.  A day turns into a week, and into a month.  They expect to get back to it, but never do.  A six minute workout is a lot easier to keep in your schedule.  And if you miss a day, you can pick up where you left off and the missed day becomes your rest day.

Carleo's approach is to start off at a moderate level of resistance, and add a single repetition each week until the program has you set the machine to a higher level.  Although it's easy to think that you are starting off too low, don't let the program fool you. If you stick with it, after a few months, you will have worked your way up to a challenging workout, but you will feel the difference in a matter of weeks or days.  I've been sticking with the program for the past year, and am generally as bad as sticking to these types of programs as everybody else.

If you think that 6-8 minutes a day could not be helpful, keep in mind that Carleo became a drug free world power lifting champion using the Total Gym and this program as his only means of training.

I can't guarantee it will work for you, because honestly, most people don't stick with exercise programs.  But I think you have a better shot with this one because it's easier to stick with. If you do stick with it, you will get excellent results.

Since this video came out, Carleo introduced an updated version, with separate versions for men and women, as well as 20 minute, three times a week versions.  He also has ""no equipment"" versions that are good for travel, and for people without access to a Total Gym.

My original VHS tape never played clearly, but the new versions are also on DVD.  Although this tape offers a good workout, I would recommend looking into the newer editions that are explained on John Carleo's web site.",1156204800,67,3031,4.381037567084078
