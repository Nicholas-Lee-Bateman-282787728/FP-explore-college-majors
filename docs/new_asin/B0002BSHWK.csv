8090000,2,B0002BSHWK,"So who doesn't buy a movie that has the F word in the title? I know...............someone who knows better. Yes thinking I would at this to my collection of bizarre movies, watching it was like trying to cut your wrists with a butter knife. It felt like forever with no good results. I would recommend this movie for someone who wants to punish their kids for being bad. Or maybe for a sick form of torture this one's for you. Poor quality filming, terrible acting, and extremely low budget. Save your money.",1264809600,4,508,4.532608695652174
8090001,5,B0002BSHWK,"This is a truly uncompromised movie that delivers the cinematic goods. A combination of arthouse flick/cult/teen movie, MOD F*** EXPLOSION is hands-down one of my fav pictures. Also has a totally right-on sense of leftfield humour!",1134259200,6,231,5.444444444444445
