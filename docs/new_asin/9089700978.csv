1172934,5,9089700978,"World Nature Video Presents Fireplace TV & Tropical Aquarium
 The Ambient Collection from World Nature Video brings peaceful serenity to any location. Two visually spectacular new DVDs are available: Fireplace TV Jukebox 2 & Fireplace & Tropical Aquarium.
 Fireplace TV offers 9 separate tracks. Ideal for settings where a traditional fireplace is unwelcome, one gets all the sights & sounds of an actual fireplace. Parents who need to have date night at home due to child care issues or weather can create a romantic setting. Play your favorite fire track on automatic repeat & avoid having to continuously adjust a stereo or the DVD player.
 Gift a copy to your local Lamaze class to aid in mom-to-be relaxation. If you are a doctor or dentist, consider purchasing a copy for your waiting room. Fire has a tendency to relax people & will make your office more inviting.
 Utilize the Fireplace/Aquarium DVD to create relaxation while rocking a colicky baby. Play as background during a toddler play date or doing homeschool craft time. You'll get all the benefits of a tropical aquarium without all the upkeep & food to buy. Plus, there's no danger of little hands in the tank.
 On this DVD, choose from 2 music tracks or natural sounds of the fireplace or aquarium. Fireplace TV has a run time of 90 straight through while the Aquarium DVD is at 79 minutes. Both are filmed in HD.

1172936,5,9089700978,"The fire place and aquarium dvd was very peaceful and relaxing. They both put on a good background atmosphere for time to reflect or entertainment for guests and friends. I have recieved several different dvds from worldnaturevideo.com and they are all proffesionally made. There is alot of beautiful and fantasticly spectacular video from around the world. From oceans to deserts, wildflowers and trees to mountains with babbling streams and brooks. Even iceburgs, sunsets, clouds and so much more that words alone cant describe the visual ecstasy you get from being a viewer, and you can also choose dvds with music or natural sounds while you are taking a gorgeously breathtaking ride by the awesome videoography. Im very glad there is a product like these dvds on the market available to old and young alike. You can go to different places all over the world without having to leave the comfort of your own living room if you have a T.V. and dvd player and ofcourse a dvd from worldnaturevideo.com  Thankyou",1299628800,4,1011,4.947058823529412
