913680,5,6304697988,"Just as much as New York City is a major character in Rosemary's Baby (1968), a tale also conceived by Ira Levin, the elegant suburban village of Stepford (completely fictional, though it feels oh-so-real!) is also a  major character in the story of the undoing of Joanna Eberhart [Katharine  Ross - The Graduate], loving mother, avid photographer and horrified  housewife.
As Paula Prentiss's astonishing performance as kooky and  lovable Bobbie Markowe gives colour and fun to the story, you can see  something even more sinister underlying the serene tree-lined streets and  gracious homes that are the setting of this nightmaresque movie, as seen by  Bryan Forbes, who made a craft of creating serenely unnerving and haunting  films.

If you never saw Stepford Wives to begin with, forget I said that bit about what kinda vibe it has, ok? Good.
For those of you, young or old, who just like the era that this was made in, that much will keep you entertained by itself. If you're prepared for the darker take, then that helps too.

This movie, however, was not trying to be funny. I love the relationship between Joanna and Bobbie, and most of their scenes together were hilarious, but the one where Joanna stabs her and she pretty much malfunctions made me laugh so hard. Basically, A man moves his family to a town called stepford where all the wives are perfect and they stay at home to do housework and have no aspirations for careers. The women do whatever the men say, and Joanne and Bobbie pick up on this right away. These women spend their time trying to figure out what's going on, but will they do it in time? Honestly, I find this movie hilarious. I love when the one wife keeps saying she'll die if she doesn't get that recipe. I'm sure they didn't intend for it to be funny (just like they didn't tend for hospital massacre to be hilarious) but this movie was just that.

What was happening in Stepford CT was more sinister than that, as we gradually discover that Stepford women are being replaced by vacuous robots who live only to cook, clean and have sex with their husbands.

913912,5,6304697988,"This little 1970's time piece takes place in Stepford, Connecticut and based on Ira Levin's novel.  (Spoiler Alerts *Pretty sure everyone that is going to watch movie would have watched it by now or knows enough about it to not to have a few spoilers ruin the movie for them).  The atmosphere and acting in this movie is superb.  Very moody film with convincing acting and beautiful scenery throughout.  Great quotes and memorable moments throughout.  The ending.... ahhhhh, that ending -pure, utter WICKED!  The film has a darker tone and murky at times creating the eerie atmosphere through shadowy hues.

(SYNOPSIS and SPOILERS) Katherine Ross is divine and her acting is sublime.  Joanna (played by Katherine Ross) moves to Stepford, Connecticut with her husband and gradually realizes things are not what they seem to be in this small community.  The men have their gatherings (almost cultish) and their evil plot of the ""perfect wife/mother... woman"" by having them replaced with a more robotic counterpart taking over their lives.

Joanna and her new, quirky friend Bobbie (Paula Prentiss) notice the women change.  Their friend and fellow community lady Charmaine (Tina Louise -Ginger Grant from Gilligan's Island) has her very own Tennis Court in her yard.  Out of the blue Charmaine changes!  One day, driving by her home they notice the tennis court being completely demolished.  While visiting with Charmaine she is cleaning and scrubbing and very nonchalant about her tennis court being demolished.  She's very mono-toned in her dialogue with the ladies.  Bobbie suspects something is happening to the women in the community ...perhaps it's in the water.

They visit a lab technician and verify the water is safe and nothing is in the water.  Bobbie, a fun loving gal that hates housework fears of becoming one of these women.  One day, Joanna is babysitting her friend, Bobbie's children and when she sees her good friend again nothing is as it seems.  Bobbie is scrubbing her home top to bottom and the worse part -she was enjoying it!

Bobbie and Joanna discuss how the ladies change after four months of living in Stepford -they all become housecleaning fools that can't get enough cleaning and scrubbing.  They are beyond submissive and have no hobbies of their own anymore.

Joanna realizes after a few incidents in the kitchen with Bobbie -she is no longer human... no longer her friend, Bobbie.  Joanna begs her husband to leave Stepford but her husband has other plans for Joanna.  Cat and mouse games ensue and while searching for her children she ends up in the worse place possible.  The situation is more horrifying than just being 'transformed' in to something or someone different.... the ending gets me each time.  Just how horrific and evil someone would have to be to do this to someone they ""love"" or care about.

One of my all-time favorite (books) and movie!!  Highly recommend.  Make sure you get this 1975 KATHRINE ROSS edition and not the newer release.  Enjoy!!",1436227200,6,2999,4.9738430583501

913952,3,6304697988,"THE STEPFORD WIVES is a one hour and 55 minute film from 1975.  The film takes place in a rural community Connecticut, populated by wealthy commuters who work in New York City.  The main characters are Katherine Ross (wife) and Peter Masterson (husband lawyer) who recently moved from New York City to the wealthy suburb known as ""Stepford.""  Peter Masterson is bald, and one of his children in this film is his real life daughter, actress Mary Stuart Masterson.  The following summarizes my opinion.  Although this film does have a very good surprise ending, everything that this movie has to say could easily have been packaged into a 30 minute TWILIGHT ZONE episode.  Many viewers will likely enjoy the fact that much of this film is like a pleasant chick flick movie, where the female characters discuss certain issues, such as Women's Liberation, or their failure to pursue any career of their own.

FEMALE CHARACTERS.  Most of the film is slow moving, without much of a plot, but there is plenty of character development.  For most of the movie, it appears that the film is a ""chick flick.""  Typically, the female characters (wives) are shown dressed perfectly, doing low impact housework, tending to their children, or engaging in chit chat sessions with each other.  In their chit chat sessions, they discuss the possible implications of the ""men's club"" and wonder if it is unethical for the club to have gender based exclusionary criteria.  The overriding theme throughout this movie is the fact that Katherine Ross is experiencing escalating boredom, in view of the fact that Stepford does not possess the pizzazz of downtown Manhattan, with its tooting taxi cabs, art galleries, and cafes that are drenching ethnicity.  In a word, the problem with Stepford is that it is too sterile, too clean, and too safe.

MALE CHARACTERS.  Typically, the male characters are shown at home, busy with their work from the office, or busy supervising the installment of a swimming pool, or busy socializing with each other in a ""men's club.""  One of the men is played by actor Patrick O'Neal.  I remembered him from the TWILIGHT ZONE episode, A SHORT DRINK FROM A CERTAIN FOUNTAIN.  Patrick O'Neal is prominently featured in the surprise ending of this movie, taking place in the final 15 minutes.

STRANGE BEHAVIORS.  As the plot slowly unfolds, the film discloses some slightly strange behaviors of the female characters, mostly taking the form of complacent delight in performing household chores.  The only really strange behavior is that of Nanette Newman, who is one of the wives.  She is an alcoholic, and in one scene taking place at a backyard party by the swimming pool, she moves from guest to guest, saying the same thing, ""I'll just die if I don't get this recipe.""  It was because of this odd scene, and because of a couple of odd scenes, that I was hoping that something really weird would happen in this movie.  Unfortunately, nothing really weird happens until the final 15 minutes of THE STEPFORD WIVES.

THE CHEMIST.  Most of this film is a slow moving chick flick.  However, at the 1 hour and 10 minute point in the film, Katherine Ross visits a chemist.  Before this visit, Katherine Ross has noticed that her female friends seemed to be unusually docile and complacent with their domestic existence.  The film shows some scenes in a commercial district, where there are computer companies and engineering companies.  Katherine Ross suspects that these companies are dumping chemical waste into the water supply, where specific chemicals cause the women to be docile. (Of course, the very best movie with this theme is A CIVIL ACTION (1998) starring John Travolta, where a company W.R.Grace dumps toxic waste into the water supply, causing brain damage to children.)  The chemist happens to be the first boyfriend of the character played by Katherine Ross.  ""I thought there might be something in the water,"" she tells the chemist, providing a water sample to him.  The chemist replies, ""The final gas chromatogram readings will be coming in a few minutes.""  The movie shows the chemist looking over the readings, and he says, ""I can say right off the bat that you've got water in your water.""  Then he further explains the nature of the type of chemical analysis that is needed, and he explains, ""I've got to know specifically what I'm trying to find.""  And so, for the Katherine Ross character, her attempts to explore her theory of a toxic chemical causing docility in women have failed to lead anywhere.

THE ART GALLERY.  At 1 hour and 20 minutes into the film, Katherine Ross makes an attempt to connect with her inner self, and she is bold enough to bring her family photographs to an art gallery.  The photographs are fine, and the Katherine Ross character is shown developing the prints in her home darkroom.  However, just because a person can print black and white photos at home, does not mean that a gallery will want to represent your work.  This scene is skillfully acted.  The photos have nothing much to communicate, and the curator only says polite things.  ""These are, uh, they are quite good . . . these are nice . . . the results are lovely, but what fascinates me, is what is it you want from it all.""  Katherine Ross replies, ""I guess I want to be remembered,"" referring to her hope that she will eventually become a household word in the art world.  This scene comes to a graceful conclusion and, as one might guess, nothing further comes from Katherine Ross' attempts to be recognized as a photographer.

SUBURBAN BOREDOM IN ANOTHER MOVIE.  Another movie that discloses a suburban boredom is NEVER CRY WOLF (1983), with Brian Dennehy.  In an early scene in NEVER CRY WOLF, Brian Dennehy speaks this monologue:  ""We're all of us prospectors up here, eh, Tyler?  Scratching for that one crack in the ground. Never have to scratch again. I'll let you in on a little secret, Tyler: the gold's not in the ground. The gold's not anywhere up here.  The real gold is south of 60  sitting in living rooms, stuck facing the boob tube, bored to death.  Bored to death, Tyler.""

THE FINAL FIFTEEN MINUTES.  It is not until the final 15 minutes of this film that something definitive happens.  The viewer learns that this is really a science fiction movie, with a theme that could have been easily and capably presented by a 30 minute episode on THE TWILIGHT ZONE.  THE STEPFORD WIVES contains only enough material for a 30 minute story, and hence might test the patience of many viewers.  The main reason I was able to sit through the entire movie, is because the actresses are all abundantly easy on the eye, and I was hoping to see some concupiscence.  I liked the surprise ending.  The final couple of minutes was absolutely perfect, in terms of the costumes and acting, and was typical of the irony of THE TWILIGHT ZONE episodes.  However, I don't think that may viewers will want to sit through two hours of this slow moving film just to see the surprise ending.",1416873600,2,6998,4.772046589018303

It was a popular movie, I think, during the Women's Lib' era, where the libbers were so adamant about the subjugation of married women, and how husbands in general treated their wives, sometimes solely blaming the husbands... but also blamed the wives who perpetuated their stressing housekeeping almost above child-rearing as being the most important thing in the world; whereas the husband of that time ...at least in this story, seemed to stress good sex partners; good cooks; and being catered to in every way.",1412899200,,892,4.816993464052287

For those youngsters who have not seen this one- you need to watch it!",1395792000,,451,4.317647058823529
914078,4,6304697988,"Ira Levin's novel was a crystalized satire about the control factor between male and female relationships and marriages--it is no secret that this is a 70's product in every way, concerning as it does the breakaway of liberated females from their controlling and brutalizing husbands who (naively) expect them to play the subservient feminine role faithfully forever. This very 70's reaction of the male dominating class was to keep their wives in their cages by actively setting up traps for them--in effect, tightening their grip upon society's woman before she gets too far ""out of her place."" In the novel, this demented premise acts as a nice follow-up to ""Rosemary's Baby"", which furthers the male control factor in humorous and chillingly ironic ways. In the film version, produced during the early days of ""Saturday Night Live,"" we see how very 70's that it remains in terms of its humor. There are a FEW chilling scenes to be found here, but mostly the film takes itself too seriously without really catching the ebullient satire of Levin's source material. Not to say that this film is less noble than the travesty that remains the 2004 remake, which replaced subtle satirical jibes with outright comedy which, obviously, defeats the point, and is an insult beyond words to women everywhere. One has to question why Levin did not take an offer to work on a Hollywood film--as the opportunity must have been offered to him many times--but I personally respect him more for remaining intellectually honest and not trying to repeat what he already said in his novels (even though he might have gotten richer, he instead managed to preserve his self-respect).
The DVD has a nice 'making of' piece which is not terribly revealing, but is quite fun to look at. It is a nice piece to own. The cast in the film is interested in the history of the production and that helps. The picture and sound transfers are all good.
With a good cast, a reasonably subtle script, and a nice 70's movie flavor, ""The Stepford Wives"" film translation offers a more approachable entrance into the realm of the horror film, if you are interested. Not an essential movie, but interesting, and creepy for the concept that it represents. B-",1395619200,,2220,4.860158311345646

From the book by Ira Levin (who also wrote ""Rosemary's Baby), it tells the story of an idyllic suburban community in Connecticut whose men have a secret club that is (to put it mildly) dangerous to the women in town.  After arriving with husband and children, Joanna Eberhart, independent minded freelance photographer, soon discovers all the women who have been there at least 4 months are compliant, dutiful housewives - and there seems to be no explanation.  The horrible truth slowly begins to leak out, and the final climactic scene will leave you stunned.  The book and movie came out during a period in which the women's movement was in its prime, and of course there were many at the time who held strong views on this subject, some who agreed and some who disagreed with its purpose.  So the movie, while excellent as a suspenseful horror film, doubles as a societal commentary regarding this period in our history.",1339718400,2,1006,4.791907514450867

Even the controversial and thorny issue of brainwashing were discussed during the sixties and seventies in three films ""Manchurian Candidate"" (1962), Westland (1973) and ""Network"" (1976)

That disturbing utopia to silence the various positions and thus achieve the ideal human being, submissive and obedient has been the dream of the great totalitarian regimes around the globe.

Today, in 2011, we see with some benevolence, this process of human robot to achieve so the end of the diaspora subtle. But there are some indications that seem to point in that direction (Brazil, How to get an advertising and Consuming Passions).

By the time this film was made, still persisted in the environment evident tensions of all kinds (emotional, psychic and existential) in the social body, and this movie was another hat thrown into the arena of the risk of crushing the will as one of the most important manifestations of freedom as an ethical value.

I originally watched this back in the late 70's and just re-watched it. Though clearly written when women's lib and burning bras were at the forefront of American culture, the theme of a woman trying to fulfill her roles of mother and wife, and still find professional fulfillment remain relevant. Beyond that, this is just a great classic thriller.

SHORT SUMMARY: Joanna's the city girl, with two kids and a burning desire to be a great photographer. Her husband is a lawyer that moves them all out to the suburbs for a quieter life.  Joanna hates it, but finds one friend that isn't into the other wives priorities of creating the perfect suburban house and family.  Together, they try to understand - is it just that their odd, or is there something more sinister going on? And, if so, will it destroy who they are?

Katherine Ross does such a great job of acting the role that every woman who has ever questioned aspects of suburban life will still be able to relate. And, the movie itself continues to ratchet up the suspense right to its surprising ending.

914263,5,6304697988,"Written by William Goldman and Ira Levin, based on the latter's original manuscript, this low-key, underplayed film, still holds its own as part of a permanent collection of worthwhile productions. It is just this air of constraint that makes it work, providing a despicable reality beneath a  cloak of extreme normality. In fact, about the only really jarring moments, are two, in which violence is allowed to break through the surface. These authors know what they are doing and, undoubtedly, saw the contradiction in terms manifested thereby, but, presumably, a conscious decision was based on a different reading about the need than I made. I'm willing to believe they knew better than I do.  At any rate, this is still a very watchable and affecting movie, well worth seeing, whether you have never seen it before or, like I, saw it only when it came out some 35 years ago.
Aside from a sound script, the acting talent, particularly the featured wife and husband, and the wife's best friend (played by
Katherine Ross,  Peter Masterson and Paula Prentiss),  all do a fine job, ably assisted, in supporting roles, by an excellent cast.
Of course, the underlying premises, owe much to the distorted views of the 1950's held in intellectual and artistic circles, then, and through the 1970's. How these views match with the social views of the 21st century, I cannot say.",1282780800,,1372,4.900862068965517

The movie is richer in detail and the actors enrich the characters' personalities.  Each scenario in the film is timely and ultimately leads to the chilling last few scenes.  I've watched it at least six (6) times and am amazed at how much detail I pick up with each viewing.  This version does not compare to any of those later released.",1280707200,2,525,4.484210526315789
914350,5,6304697988,"Katharine Ross plays Joanna Eberhart, a young wife who moves with her husband Walter and their two children to the idyllic community of Stepford, Connecticut. But not long after the move, Joanna begins to notice how strange the local women are; obsessed with cleaning and keeping their husbands satisfied in every way, and responding bizarrely to simple questions and personal injuries. She is somewhat comforted when she makes friends with an even less organized and submissive female than herself, Bobbie Markowe (Paula Prentiss), and the pair soon begin playing detective to try and figure out what is going on with the local women and what is up with the mysterious and creepy men's club that Walter has recently joined. What they eventually discover is too terrible to be believed.

Now, if you haven't seen or heard about Stepford Wives and the truth about what is happening in Stepford is something you wish to keep a surprise, you may want to check this fantastic movie out for yourself and not read on.

For those of you who sorta know what the movie is about but haven't seen it yet, it is well worth your time. From 1975 and directed by Bryan Forbes (based on the novel by Ira Levin), this film wasn't all that well received largely because feminist groups didn't ""get it"" and the fact that it is actually a film with a feminist message (just, thankfully, not so bluntly in your face). Many people completely failed to read between the lines, which seems amazing to me, as it probably would to most modern viewers. There is no doubt that the men in this film were not being represented as ""good guys"" or ""in the right"". And, in fact, while this movie is fascinating, exciting, creepy, etc..., what they were doing in all honesty really didn't even make sense. I mean, why kill your wife (which is essentially what they were doing) and replace her with a robot when you could just leave her and THEN marry a robot if that's what you want? Perhaps they needed their bodies in some way, but that point wasn't really made. Even more baffling is that I hear there is a sequel where the men start doing the same thing to their kids, too? What's the point of robot kids at all? I just don't get it.

Nevertheless, this film is highly entertaining and great fun as horror films go! A great example of how excellent a horror film can be without CGI or gore. A couple of the creepiest scenes are simply unforgettable. I so wish I could find a way to see the three sequels made to this film, though they're probably weak copies. I even greatly enjoyed the comedic remake starring Nicole Kidman from a few years back, though that one was even more confusing on the issue of robots vs. brain implants or whatever. They revealed a robot body in that one, and yet it seemed through the course of the film that they didn't actually use them... Puzzling, but still fun and entertaining, just like this one, the original cult classic!

The DVD has some nice interviews, the theatrical trailer, radio spots, bios, and a nice enhanced widescreen presentation. It's a must have for a respectable horror film collection, and if you like this one, I also recommend checking out the remake and other classic film with similar themes, ""Westworld"", ""Futureworld"", and ""Deadly Friend"". You might also enjoy these other exercises in justified paranoia, ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"", ""The Orphan"",  and ""The Faculty"" as well. And for something lighter, there's Disney's ""Not Quite Human"" film series, if you can find it. As for the made for TV sequels, which I have yet to see, they are ""Revenge of the Stepford Wives"", ""The Stepford Children"", and ""The Stepford Husbands"". Perhaps by the end of the series everyone was a robot?",1273968000,3,3714,4.690184049079755

914353,5,6304697988,"I remembered that the original ""Stepford Wives"" movie had been a great and fairly scary picture, so I bought the newer version on DVD a few years ago -- and was very disappointed. The newer version just didn't capture the mood or tone of the original. That DVD went went into a cardboard box filled with other of my ""lesser"" DVDs.
A few weeks ago, I was going through that box to determine which DVDs I would keep and which ones I would give or trade away.
When I came across my copy of the newer ""Stepford Wives."" I put into my discard box. Then, for some reason, I decided to keep it -- and order a DVD of my beloved original ""The Stepford Wives"" and some other DVDs.
When my order was delivered I watched the original for the first time in many years. It was just as I remembered, It was still the great movie even if it didn't seem as scary as I remembered. The acting, lighting and mood was wonderful, especially since it was in black and white It was thrilling -- and without the gore every few minutes that seem to be required by
so many modern movies to create thrills and chills.
A few days later I decided to watch the newer ""Stepford Wives."" As I watched the DVD I realized I was watching the same movie and, while the mood was so different from the original, it was a delightful movie. The colors added the tone of the movie and I realized I was watching an almost-satire of the original. It was an inspired version of the original without a fault, especially with the casting. The light touch was perfect.

914354,5,6304697988,"I love this film. This is film-making at its American Classic best. There is so much depth to this film. And the subtleties are amazing. I've seen it more than once and it really does have a lot of layers. Maybe, as a previous review indicated, it seems slow-paced compared to the movies we're accustomed to seeing now. However, if you watch closely there are a lot of things that are revealed but not underscored in a heavy-handed fashion. Joanna insists her husband finish doing the dishes as she does other kitchen chores. Joanna is asked if she's ever made it in front of a fireplace by her husband and she replies ""Not with you."" Joanna was a strong and opinionated woman, and that obviously grated on her weak-willed husband. The reasons he loved her to being with are also the reasons he plots to replace her.

I also really enjoyed the documentary that sheds some light on the behind-the-scenes casting and writing issues, such as learning Diane Keaton was originally to play Joanna but dropped out, and master-screenwriter William Goldman wrote a draft of the script and fought with producers and was fired.

To me, the plot's seemingly slow pace actually furthers the central theme - one way or another, moving to Stepford is going to envelop Joanna either like quicksand or the more horrifying ultimate truth. Joanna even unwittingly contributes to her own demise, allowing herself to be studied by the guys from the Mens' Association. By the time Joanna realizes what is happening, it is too late.

I tend to think of this film as more of a European film in some ways, rather than 1970's style filmmaking, because they don't do blatant exposition. They allow the viewer to see the clues and arrive at their own conclusion. It is a matter of treating the audience's intelligence with respect.",1219795200,,1803,4.772435897435898
914355,4,6304697988,"This film certainly deserves to be rated a classic for the imprint it has left on popular culture alone.  Everybody knows what a Stepford Wife is even if most people haven't seen the film.  And as a straightforward suspense horror it belongs in the premier league. Perhaps a little slow in the first half but more than making up for it in the second.

In terms of its message, I found it wasn't so easy to interpret.  Is it simply, as others here suggest, an allegory parodying the resentment felt by men after the first feminist revolutions of the 60's?  Of course we are supposed to identify with the women in the story and especially the lead heroine, the suspense and drama of the film wouldn't work at all otherwise.  But perhaps we are entitled to feel a little bit of empathy with the menfolk of Stepford and their motivations. In particular the poor Walter, stressed to the hilt through working non-stop to provide for his children only for his self-indulgent wife to pursue her egotistical and vain dreams of becoming a famous photographer.  Is the allegory more subtle - are we really looking at the disorientation of men, and are the Stepford wives merely experiencing what it feels like to have your identity, expectations and certainties overturned almost over night?

Actually, I'm inclined to see the film as merely a well made satirical portent of the possible dangers of a vengeful male backlash against the recently won gains of feminism.  It must be remembered that in the 1970's it wasn't clear at all what the eventual outcome of the great gender war would be.  Most of the men in the film are cold, calculating and evil.  The only sympathetic male character is Walter and he comes across as much of a manipulated victim to the 'Men's Association' as the women do.  Any feminist should delight in the carefully charicatured mysogny on display, from the mens' 'objectifying' picture drawing to the dismissal of the lead character's conspiracy paranoia as merely an over emotional hissy fit.

We now know that womenkind decisively won the 20th century sex war, unless or until Islam one day re-takes the west for the forces of patriarchy.  The ending of the film, where all the women parade contentedly around the supermarket aisles with their trolleys, so dutiful and robotic that they do not even get sexually distracted at the sight of a black man, must strike most 21st century viewers as both unbelivable and kitschy.

But perhaps the dream of having women who once again accept their natural place in society (without having to resort to a neolithic religion) is not so fanciful after all.  Feminism arrived late in Japan - it's first devasting effects (breakdown of the family, spiralling youth delinquency, horrendous abortion rates, the progressive retardation of the arts and sciences etc) are only just being felt and the first anti-feminist backlash only just beginning.  But whilst Japan is behind the west in the social effects of feminism, it is years ahead of the west in terms of robotics.  The most advaced and life like androids in the world were recently unveiled at a science fair in Tokyo - they can talk - very politely. They will do whatever their male inventors and programmers tell them to do. They are beautiful...and they are female...",1211673600,,3282,4.830357142857143
914356,2,6304697988,"Another twisted tale from the late Ira Levin, who also gave us ""Rosemary's Baby"" and ""Deathtrap."" The film is quite effective in its use of creepy foreshadowing. Just before she moves with her husband and kids from Manhattan to tranquil Stepford, photographer Joanne (Katharine Ross) snaps a photo of a man carrying a mannequin across the street-- terribly symbolic of the environment she will soon find herself trapped in.
Once settled in Stepford, we see her husband (Peter Masterson) wearing a shirt with the word ""PAPA"" on it. He soon joins the Stepford Men's Association. The wives are much too tranquil-- they are vapidly ""blank."" They sound like TV commercials-- prattling on endlessly about the joys of ironing, baking, cleaning, etc. Everybody remembers the party scene where one ""wife"" keeps repeating ""I'll just die if I don't get this receipe."" Perky Paula Prentiss as Bobbie gives the only lively performance in the film; that is, before she is ""changed."" Katharine Ross is not particularly good; although her peformance grows much stronger (by ""stronger"", I mean ""emotionally overwrought"") by the time she visits the psychiatrist until the end.  Perhaps Ross, like the doomed character she portrays, realized she was trapped in a mess!!
  I wish I could have ""enjoyed"" this film as a satire of surburban assimilation, but I just can't. I don't find any humor, either black or camp, in the plot, either. At first, I thought it was all sickeningly misogynistic but, after reading another review, I realized the film is neither anti-women or pro-men. The men are all evil, and the women are all victims. I believe the basic premise was recycled for TV movies like ""Stepford Children,"" (Parents kill their difficult children and replace them with perfect robot duplicats!), ""Stepford Husbands,"" ""Return To Stepford"", ""Revenge Of The Stepford Wives"" or some such titles, equally inane and unnecessary. The original film accomplishes its  disturbing chores in competent enough fashion. At the end, the evil president of the Men's Association tells Ross they do what they do ""because we can."" The implications therein are so horrid I can not, I did not, laugh at this film or ""enjoy"" any of it.",1208649600,,2201,5.071823204419889

I had read the novel and loved it, and as soon as I signed up for a mail order rental service, it went to the top of the list. I was not disapointed. I thought Katherine Ross was amazing! Yes, the pacing was slow at parts, and it didn't quite portray the growing dread as scary as I had imagined it, but those were my only real issues with it. This is a really frightening movie for me, that these men would be so heartless and selfish and hate their wives so much that they would turn them into ""Stepford Wives."" Destroying someone you claimed to love so they can cater to you every need and never complain or take time or think for themselves. Wow! That kind of stuff beats most recent horror hands down!",1208044800,2,782,4.117647058823529
914358,4,6304697988,"This 1975 film is based on the novel of the same name by Ira Levin, who also wrote ""Rosemary's Baby"", ""A Kiss Before Dying"", and ""This Perfect Day"" (and why the latter hasn't been made into a film yet is beyond my comprehension).  The excellent script is by William Goldman.

The premise of the story (a group of men in a wealthy Connecticut suburb figure out a way to knock off their wives and replace them with compliant, eternally young, robotic replacements so lifelike that the rest of the world can't detect the physical difference) would have been utterly unfilmable were it not so obviously meant to be allegorical.  The tenor of the times must be taken into consideration, as well, for the film's timeliness in 1975 was its satirical response to the backlash against the first wave of feminism that had taken place.

The 2004 remake is so awful as not to deserve even one viewing, but the original, although it doesn't really answer some of the very questions it begs about the nature of intimate relationships, still makes for suspenseful viewing just by posing the questions.  The premise works because there is just enough suspicion buried in most women's hearts that most men, in THEIR hearts, would prefer an eternally beautiful, utterly pliant, sexually undemanding, brainless robot to the complexities of intimacy with a living, breathing, intelligent, three-dimensional, adult woman with distinct needs and ideas.

Walter and Joanna Eberhart live in a crowded Manhattan apartment with their two children and a dog.  Joanna is a talented photographer who has been home with the children for some years and is beginning to get restless.  She adores the gritty and intellectually stimulating city life, but Walter, a high-earning corporate lawyer, hates the crime, the dirt, and the cramped quarters, and thinks it's time to move to a a big house with a lawn in a manicured suburb filled with white Republicans.  He is less than enthused about Joanna's wish to step outside homemaking and see if she can make something of her photography.

When Walter suggests a move to the suburbs to Joanna, she is not happy, and even less so when she finds out that Walter has already found the town and the house he thinks they should all live in, and bought the house.  Joanna is presented with a fait accompli - something Walter apparently has a habit of doing.  Of course, why a brainy, accomplished woman like Joanna has ended up married to a narcissistic d*** like Walter is never explained.

Joanna grudgingly agrees to give suburban life a try, and in no time, we see the family driving up to Connecticut, to the town of Stepford, where Walter has purchased a large, beautiful colonial-style white house with hardwood floors and bay windows and crown moldings and fireplaces and all those details that make people rush out to buy homes like that, situated on a country road lined with big trees.  Everything is clean and bright and Anglo-Saxon.  Their new next-door neighbor, Carol Van Sant (Nanette Newman), who exhibits a somewhat fey affect and is wearing an outfit reminiscent of ""Little House on the Prairie"", brings over a homemade casserole to tide the family through Moving Day.  After supper, we see Walter and Ted Van Sant (Josef Somer) nodding conspiratorially together as Walter whispers, ""She looks as good as she cooks, Ted!"".

It does't take long for Stepford to pall on Joanna.  For one thing, there is that Men's Club that Walter tells her he's thinking of joining, whose meetings take place in a large house of Gothic aspect that could serve as a site for a Hawthorne story.  Walter follows his habit of asking her opinion on it when, as she knows perfectly well, he has already joined.  He brings the Men's Club home for coffee one evening, and as she entertains them, one of their members, who turns out to be a professional advertising artist, begins to sketch Joanna from various angles (he is actually meant to be the man who did all those idealized Breck Girl portraits - remember them?!). Another asks if she will help him with a regional accent recognition project he's doing, and provide him with an exhaustive recording of common words from A-Z.  Walter looks on unconcerned as all this takes place.

And then Joanna meets The Wives, who are an oddly mixed group.  There's Bobbie (Paula Prentiss) and Charmaine (Tina Louise), who clearly aren't happy with their lives in Stepford, either - but the rest are all women who live to shop, iron, cook, and clean.  You can spot these women a mile off by their clothes: long, frilly dresses and big hats, and by their kitchens: always spotlessly clean.  At their very first community social event, a barbecue, the feckless Carol van Sant has a minor ""breakdown"" and walks around the pool with an hor d'oeuvre in her hand repeating, ""I'll just die if I don't get this recipe!"".  Ted takes his wife home, blaming the little scene on her inability to tolerate alcohol, but Joanna and Bobbie are horrified when, the next day, Carol shows up to apologize for her behavior, and lets it slip that the Men's Club is sending her around to apologize to everyone who was at the barbecue.

Well, it's just a matter of time before Joanna begins to be not just bored in Stepford, but suspicious.  She and Bobbie become close friends, partners in their mutual suburban misery.  One day, they knock on Charmaine's door, only to back away in shock when the feisty tennis player opens the door in a long dress, murmuring happily about all the pretty new clothes her husband has given her, now that she's letting him turn her beloved tennis court into a swimming pool.  Bobbie and Joanna are so alarmed by Charmaine's ""conversion"" that they have the town water analyzed, but no mysterious drug is found in it.

The increasingly nervous Joanna begins to see a therapist to air her fears, and tells Walter that she wants to move away from Stepford as soon as possible.  To her surprise, Walter is very understanding and promises to put the house up for sale right away.

Alas, if only it were the water!  On a rainy night when Joanna can no longer live with her mounting fears, she comes home from her therapy session, planning to grab the children, pile them into the car, and run for it, but the house is dark and the children are gone.  She goes to Bobbie's house to ask if they are there, and is stunned when her friend opens the door in a ruffled blouse and long flowered skirt, and takes her into a sparkling kitchen that used to look as if a tornado had gone through it.  When Joanna tries to convey her terror to Bobbie, and her suspicion that the word lists and the Men's Club are somehow all mixed up in these extraordinary personality changes, Bobbie will only reply that what she needs is a good cup of coffee.  In her frustrated terror, Joanna picks up a kitchen knife and thrusts it into Bobbie's pelvis - and sees that the truth is far more terrible than her worst suspicions about doctored water, hypnosis, mind control, etc.  Joanna cuts a few wires as she stabs Bobbie, who starts to move erratically and hilariously around the kitchen, dumping cups of coffee on the floor and repeating indignantly, ""I thought we were friends; I thought we were friends; I thought. . .""

Joanna rushes to the Men's Club, where she thinks her children are being held, and is at last confronted with the full horror of what has been going on in Stepford.  There, upstairs, is the not quite finished robotic replica of herself, in a replica of Joanna's own bedroom, sitting at a replica of her own vanity, dressed in a beautiful negligee - through which shows a noticeably larger bosom than Joanna's own. The family dog, who disappeared inexplicably shortly after the Eberharts moved to Stepford, is ensconced on the bed - obviously there to get used to the new model of his mistress and not give her away when she takes over Joanna's life.  Nearly complete, the only thing the New Improved Joanna is missing are her eyes, which are still dark pools of emptiness, although she smiles sweetly as she gets up and moves gracefully toward Joanna, twisting a chiffon scarf tightly in her hands.

The fabled last scene of the movie takes place in a supermarket almost as immaculate as the homes it serves, as the Stepford Wives glide along its aisles in long dresses, white gloves, and picture hats, greeting each other placidly as they fill up their carts with oven cleaner, Ajax, laundry detergent, and Pledge.

However, over in another aisle, we see what is probably filmdom's first black yuppie couple, quarreling, as the husband hisses that the wife should at least give the place a chance, look how nice and clean it is here, while the wife complains bitterly she doesn't know why he brought her here, this is the whitest place she has ever seen . . .they are still bickering ominously as the fadeout begins on Joanna's empty, smiling face.

""The Stepford Wives"" makes ""Aliens"" look like a scholarly paper in The Scientific American.  But allegories make their point in broad and oversimplified brushstrokes. This particular allegory illuminates a less admirable corner of the male id, but it works because of the suspicion, not exactly allayed by a review of gender history, that that corner still exists, and that given immunity from punishment or the disapproval of the larger social order, it would reactivate.  If this were not the case, this would be a comedy, and would never have worked as a suspense film.

Stylishly done and well-performed by all hands, the film manages to draw the viewer in to its illogical allegorical world, despite the logical questions that arise almost immediately.  Katharine Ross is excellent, and Paula Prentiss oddly touching as the exuberant, funny Bobbie - they makes us hope desperately that both will somehow escape the fate of the other Stepford Wives.  That we are devastated when they do not is evidence of how seriously we still take the allegory's point.",1207267200,3,9959,4.755516840882694
914447,4,6304697988,"I saw the first STEPFORD WIVES in 1975 and really liked the film. Although it wasn't a five star film experience I rated it at four stars and thought the plot was original even though ridiculous. In a very lose sense it was a sci-fi drama and conspiracy film all in one, and the novelty of the plot had me scratching my head until almost the end of the movie.

I think the plot was just plane silly. What person who wished a robot for a companion would first permit the parent of their child to be killed and replaced by a machine? Simply divorce the spouse and live with whoever (or whatever) you wish. The other story element which is sadly ridiculous is finding a satisfactory life partner in 20th century (or even 21st century) hardware. You can't share life with a souped up computer no matter how good it may be in bed. Disney Animatronics are only good for amusement park characters and I don't think any man or woman will be turning in their spouse for a mechanical simulation for at least the next couple of centuries.  I remember my date agreeing and commenting that she could only understand being interested in robotic relations on some kind of kinky whim.

While Ira Levine may have cheated a bit with timing, the plot was so new that it had many guessing until the end of the film and for that we must credit good film and sci-fi. I did care about what happened to Joanna Eberhart and her children all the way through the film, and grant this movie four well earned stars.

Ira Levin appreciates a well spun plot involving a lone helpless woman against a dark conspiracy strong in numbers. Levin also had the target of this plot questioning her own sanity as the story unfolds, wasting her time testing her town water at a lab, and visiting a shrink as the conspiracy only gathers strength around her. As we all know Levin used a similar situation very convincingly in ROSEMARY'S BABY in 1968.",1205280000,,1907,4.471264367816092
914448,4,6304697988,"It's hard to believe that a movie like The Stepford Wives has been with us for over 30 years now, creating a new catch phrase of ""Stepford Wife"".  While the remake with Nicole Kidman was panned by critics and audiences, it's best to go back and see the original.  Chances are they are based on each other, but not the same movie in the slightest.  This was certainly the case with the original and the remake.

Katherine Ross plays Joanna, a city woman who has just moved with her husband to a small, picturesque suburban town in the hopes of leaving their hectic life behind and restarting.  What she finds instead is a town full of perfect, glassy eyed, Barbie doll women.  Her new friend Bobbie shares her distain for the oddities of the town, and over time they see that there is just far more than meets the eye about this town full of Betty Crockers.

While this movie was quite long and could have trimmed the fat in a few places, it had several salient points of old school horror.  There are no blood and guts and explosions, there is a constant sense of dread.  A creeping, mounting paranoia feeling that they are coming to get her, knowing that when she discovers the truth about what is in store for her it's already too late.

Paula Prentiss is her wonderful self, and Miss Ross is fine.  there are wonderful campy scenes that any lover of camp must see.  as another reviewer said, some of these scenes are truly unforgettable.  i wish the two fact finding expeditions they took had been melded into one--would have helped with pacing.

It's ironic, in that Joanna's downfall is what in a biological way would make her the most excellent of mates--she wants to protect her children.  but to a narcissist husband, that doesn't matter at all.  if you think about it--how devastating would it be to see your replacement....

along those lines, comparison's to bodysnatchers are specious--no one had a choice in that story.  here, narcisisstic husbands are the driving force.  Misogynistic?  Only if you feel that some would feel the men were right in their anxiety about women claiming their power.  I feel it is truly a feminist movie--in that feminism is a critique of traditional gender / power relationships and the lengths to which those in power will go to preserve their dominance.  but for the pacing, i feel that there are themes worthy of study in this film (but as a friend of mine said, that's because i look at everything archetypally).

While I was watching the movie, there were several places where I would say ""Well, why are you doing that?"" But right after the movie, I read one of the movie reviews on the back of the box that said ""it is wonderfully ridiculous black humor satire."" Then I realized that when you view this movie not so much as a story where ALL men are evil and ALL women are good but as social commentary but especially as symbolic, (especially I.F. Homemaker) everything makes perfect sense and the movie was just wonderful.

One needs to look at this movie as a commentary on how we each lose our individuality by a group of controlling men at the top of our power structure in which there is an incredibly strong pressure to conform, hence the fake smiling people who go around saying and believing that everything would be just wonderful in our consumer society if (in this case) women would just conform as noted in the final scene.",1175126400,2,1157,4.5095238095238095

This 1975 chiller features Katherine Ross as Joanna Eberhart, a New York City wife, mother, and budding photographer who moves with her husband and kids to Stepford, a beautiful, seemingly perfect suburb.  I say ""seemingly perfect"" because while Stepford IS beautiful, there's something peculiar going on, particularly with the women.  They are beautiful, polite, soft-spoken, and seem to live only for being Betty Crockers.  It doesn't take long for Joanna and her new friend, spirited, lively Bobbi Markowe (Paula Prentiss), to notice that something is a little off about these women.  As it turns out, something IS a little off--they're not human, they're robots.  That is, robots who live only to cook, clean, and please their husbands 24/7.  Were they always like this?  No.  Once upon a time, they were actually human beings, with minds, personalities, opinions, feelings, and talents all their own.  So what happened?  It seems that they've been turned into robots by husbands who decided that they needed quiet, smiling, and submissive wives who would do whatever--and I do mean WHATEVER, including have sex--they were told to do.  Joanna and Bobbi--and a third woman named Charmaine (Tina Louise)--are the only women who still have a sense of themselves.  But not for long, for soon thereafter, Charmaine becomes one of them, and eventually, even Bobbi, and sadly, Joanna, become Stepford wives, too.

Some of the reviewers have said that the ending--where the wives are seen strolling through supermarket aisles in their dresses and hats--was shocking.  I didn't see it that way.  To me, the ending was more sad than shocking--sad in that Joanna and the other wives were no longer themselves, no longer possessed the qualities that made them who they were.  During the movie, Joanna talks to her husband about surviving--that is, surviving to stay true to herself even when the other women around her have literally become clones.  When Joanna is turned into one of them, she has been killed--in more ways than one.  That's what happened to the Stepford wives--in the end, none of them survived.",1165881600,4,2266,5.105978260869565

Well, this 70's gem is a well made, scary film (in a rather subtle way). I can't imagine a suprerior version. The film starts off as a slow, upbeat film about a family leaving the big city to buy a big house in the suburbs. The plot slowly unfolds as the lead lady along with her friend suspect something is wrong with the Stepford housewives. Is it something in the water? Is there some type of conspiracy which causes them to love their chores and slave for their husbands?

The scariest part is that while I was watching the film I reflected on how much I love my wife.

914526,3,6304697988,"I had never seen or read any version of the Stepford Wives until the remake a few years ago. At that time, I saw the movie and was somewhat entertained. It was a male chauvinist fantasy gone wrong with plenty of elements of comedy. It was not a great movie but it was fun while it lasted. Now I have seen the original and they have almost nothing in common except the premise of men replacing their wives with alternates who would do their every bidding. As a recently married man, I can see the attraction but it is only a wistful view.

The story is deceptively simple. A couple from NYC move to the suburb of Stepford Village. The wife, played by Kathryn Harris, is not thrilled with the move but agrees to it for the sake of the children. When the family gets there, they find an apparently nice place, to all appearances. The houses are nice, the kids have plenty to do in a safe place and the women are...strange.

All of the women keep their appearance wonderfully. Each is a good cook and each positively LIVES for housework. It is not something that would appeal to a professional woman and the heroine finds it a lonely place until she finds a kindred spirit who has also recently arrived. They try to put together a women's support group which quickly degenerates into a group which discusses the best ways to deal with a tough stain or make cookies. Also worrying is the way that all of the newly arrived men seem to be fascinated with the local men's club.

As time goes on, the women get scared. The local women act more and more like male fantasy robots. When Harris's newfound best friend suddenly changes and also turns into a male fantasy, Harris gets frightened. She has good reason.

This production has none of the comedic elements of the remake. It has none of the light moments either. It does, however, have a gripping fascination all its own. It is dark and frightening look at the beast that lurks in the hearts of some men.",1162944000,5,1950,4.43854748603352
914527,5,6304697988,"I didn't see this 1975 film until about 20 years after its release. Even though I knew the basic plot I was quite captivated by the events of the story. Well, I've seen it three more times since then and each time I'm taken in by the storyline, not to mention well entertained.

THE PLOT: Katharine Ross and her husband move to Stepford, CT, where many of the wives of the village seem to be oblivious to the current women's liberation movement; they seem wholly dedicated to their husbands, home & garden and keeping themselves well-groomed and primed for sex. Meanwhile Katharine's husband joins a mysterious all-male organization which seems to be up to something fishy. When two of Katharine's friends strangely morph into the typical Stepford housewife Katharine realizes something diabolical is going on and, to her horror, that she's next in line.

Paula Prentiss and Tina Louise (Ginger from Giligan's Island) are on hand as Katharine's friends.

The story is not campy at all (like the 2004 version). This is serious and creepy sci-fi of the highest order. ""The Stepford Wives"" powerfully succeeds where the similar-themed ""Westworld"" only passably gets by.",1158883200,10,1166,5.0310880829015545

The message of mens desire for a perfect life gone astray is as compelling today as it was the day the movie was released.

Okay, so if you're gonna remake this film, couldn't you at least make it more interesting.  The Nicole Kidman update was just god awful.  I am basing my 5 star review on the DVD extras and just because I really like this movie.  It  is so memorable and funny in many ways.  The DVD extra was neat.  Apparently there was rancor between the English director, Bryan Forbes, screenwriter William Goldman and lead actor Peter Masterson.  Forbes altered Goldman's script which Masterson didn't appreciate because he is a close friend of Goldman's.  Excutive producer Edgar Shcerick wanted Brian DePalma  to direct but Goldman refused.  Also, Diane Keaton was the first choice to play Joanna Eberhart but backed out at the end.  And as a footnote, Mary Stuart Masterson appeared as the Eberharts' seven year old daughter in her film debut.  Overall everyone got  along enough to make a real neat film.  There's also interviews with Katharine Ross and Paula Prentiss on their prespective in making the movie.  I like the DVD extra as much as the film itself.  I did not read the book, but now interested in doing so just to see the comparisson.  I think a reviewer based his opinion on the translation of the book to film, which I think is unfair because the book is always better.  The movie itself is a hoot.  There were loads of funny lines..  Like the exchange between the Ross and Prentiss characters ""I dabbled in Women's Lib back in New York""  ""Yeah didn't we alll.""  (at least in college, anyway.)  And the husbands are kinda pathetic because they all seem like a bunch of jeeks and nerds who grew up to be old professional bores scheming to build a super wife who will always be in the mood and will keep a clean house.  They should have been replacing themselves.  I didn't really see it as a feminist's movie even though it was made during 1975 when the ERA movement was gaining momentum.  This movie holds up in many aspect because it is well made and the suspense build up was well paced and got real scary toward the climactic end.  I am glad Ross ended up playing Joanna.  She projected an innocent frailty just by her mere appearance.  She has the most melancholic pair of camel eyes on screen, almost haunting.

The politics of the 1970's equal-rights movement are really perplexing viewed through a post-feminist lens.  The women in this movie all whine because their husbands want them to actually stay home, cook, clean, and raise the children.  Horrors!

Frankly, with such selfish, self-absorbed, whiny creatures as depicted in that movie, I found myself rooting for the husbands for turning them into robots.  Thankfully, the Battle of the Sexes is fading into the shadows of pop-culture history, and I think (hope) men and women are re-learning to value and respect each other and the complementary roles we play.",1147478400,6,799,4.838235294117647
914531,4,6304697988,"Writer Ira Levin sure has a thing for secret societies...just look at the some of the films based off his novels...Rosemary's Baby (1968), The Boys from Brazil (1978), and this one, titled The Stepford Wives (1975), all featuring some sort of shrouded community within the community, ones with chilling agendas.  Adapted by William Goldman (Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, All the President's Men, Marathon Man), and directed by Bryan Forbes (The Raging Moon, International Velvet), the film stars Katharine Ross (Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, Voyage of the Damned, The Swarm).  Also appearing is Paula Prentiss (Where the Boys Are, Catch-22), Peter Masterson (The Exorcist), Nanette Newman (International Velvet), Patrick O'Neal (Silent Night, Bloody Night), Josef Sommer (Close Encounters of the Third Kind), Franklin Cover (""The Jeffersons""), Tina Louise (""Gilligan's Island""), William Prince (Kiss Me Goodbye), along with some early appearances by Mary Stuart Masterson (At Close Range, Some Kind of Wonderful) and Dee Wallace-Stone (The Howling, Cujo).

It's moving day for the Eberharts, as Walter (Masterson), Joanna (Ross), their two, young daughters (don't forget Fred the dog) pack up and leave the dirty, noisy, dangerous city for the quiet, picturesque town of Stepford, as depicted through a traveling montage.  As the family begins to settle in to their new surroundings, Walter seems to take to the town like a fish to water (he even joins the local men's association), but Joanna, a semi-professional photographer, is having a bit more difficulty (we quickly get the sense moving wasn't her idea), exacerbated by the fact that a majority of the men in town seem like awful bores, while their wives are all stifled, bubble headed, prairie dress wearing housefraus, obsessed with all things domestic.  Eventually Joanna finds a kindred spirit in Bobbie Markowe (Prentiss), a recent ex-Gothamite who's quite an outspoken character in her own right, and the pair embarks on a (fruitless) venture to raise consciousness among the women in the town.  The duo eventually learns there was a woman's organization within the town at one point, but it has since disbanded due to a lack of interest.  This, along with a variety other events, add up to Joanna and Bobbi believing the drone-like mentality among the housewives of Stepford may be the result of some sort of plot, perpetrated by the men in the community.  The women both agree perhaps its time to move (both their husbands are surprisingly receptive to the idea), but soon Joanna finds herself alone as Bobbi has since `gotten with the program', after a weekend retreat with her husband.  Fearing she's losing her mind, Joanna seeks outside, professional help, finally deciding on taking the children and leaving, but it may be too late as she realizes her time draws near...her time for what?  You'll have to watch the film to find out...

I did enjoy this film a lot, and while the pacing is fairly slow (at some points it virtually crawls), the characters and story were both generally interesting enough to keep my attention during the nearly two-hour running time.  Katharine Ross seemed an excellent choice for the lead, as I think she's a strong actress who really seemed to embody an individualist quality that made her perfect for the role...not only that, but she's really beautiful to boot.  As the story progressed I could actually feel her fear in terms of having that which made her who she, her creativity, spirit, and individuality, taken away from her by some unknown force bent on a sense of domestic conformity not seen since the late 1950s television show ""Leave it to Beaver', a fear that changed from an amorphous apprehensiveness to a concrete nightmare once Bobbi was `turned'.  I mean think about it...imagine all the things about you that make you who you are, your essence, and then imagine all those things, good and bad, drained away, replaced with only a sense of unquestioning servility to another, an unwavering desire to please.  Some may be critical of the obvious, misogynist sentiment within the story, but I felt it was purely superficial as the idea of having a non-questioning, mindless, drone-like automaton catering to my every desire, no mater how filthy, may sound desirable on some primitive, socially retarded level, but eventually such obedience from my significant other would reveal itself for the drag it is, and ultimately force me to blow my brains out if only to provide an escape from the mind numbing tedium.  I mean seriously, what reasonably intelligent individual knowingly wants to spend his, or her, life with a soulless husk of a human being?  I really liked the ominous tone that permeated the story, although I felt the revelation of a prior occupation of the leader of the men's association, played by Patrick O'Neal, a little clumsy, as it give away a lot early on and in a short amount of time.  The only thing left after this was the question of the fate of the women when it came to be their `time'.  This aspect wasn't revealed until the end, and was handled perfectly, in my opinion (sometimes less is more).  I thought Prentiss' character a bit over the top, but then I think this was purposeful if only to highlight the differences after the change, and to drive home the fact to Joanna that she's not going crazy, but that there is truly sinister forces at work within the town.  While the female characters were definitely the strongest elements in this feature, the male characters, on the other hand, were relatively weak.  I guess that's to be expected given what they were into, but I felt there could have been more involving Walter, as, at times, he seemed to struggle with his choice to commit Joanna to the process, eventually acquiescing to the group mentality.  I thought director Bryan Forbes did very well presenting this story to the screen, keeping things low key and generally eerie (the ending was immensely creepy and effective), but the inclusion of his wife, Nanette Newman, in the cast smacked of a certain amount of nepotism.  She seemed a capable actress, and attractive on an Earthy level, but hardly the trophy-type wife coveted by the men in the community, one that included Tina Louise.  My favorite sequence in the film was when Joanna and Bobbi managed to get the wives in the community together in order to start a consciousness raising dialogue with regards to issues shared by women in the community, and it ends up breaking down into discussion about floor waxing and brands of coffee.

The DVD I own was released by Anchor Bay Entertainment, and states it's the Silver Anniversary Edition.  The picture, presented in widescreen (1.85:1), enhanced for 16X9 TVs, looks decent, although I thought the Dolby Digital mono audio could have been better (it seemed soft at times, and the loudness level varied from time to time).  As far as extras, there are interviews with the director Bryan Forbes, producer Edgar J. Scherick, and stars Katharine Ross, Paula Prentiss, Peter Masterson, and Nanette Newman.  Also included are a theatrical trailer, two radio spots, a Bryan Forbes biography, and an insert booklet with liner notes by someone named Jay Marks.

2004 saw the release of a remake featuring Nicole Kidman, Matthew Broderick, and Christopher Walken, which I have yet to see, but the reviews seem to indicate mixed feelings towards the production.  Hey, at least we'll always have the original.",1143504000,7,7494,4.9991961414791

Forgot the horrid recent remake with Nicole Kidman, stick with the 1975 version, which scared me to death (and made me laugh at the same time) when I saw it as a young kid in the theaters - those were the days, and this is still a scary, mature little gem of a horror movie that doesn't rely on today's CGI effects to get under your skin. Chock full of priceless dialogue and pitch-perfect performances (especially Paula Prentiss as the coffee-serviing Bobbie!), STEPFORD takes it time to rachet up suspense and deliberately build to a disturbing, ironic conclusion that will stick with you for days.  Katherine Ross' climactic confrontation with her black-eyed drone is terrifying, while the final supermarket sequence is all about what becomes a legend most. Def worth a rental or purchase.",1135900800,5,917,4.9480519480519485
914533,5,6304697988,"First, despite the passing of 30 years this well made film is still a very good suspense thriller with excellent acting and pacing. The climatic scene is still a major creep-out, and the resolution scene is still a hoot-and-a-half.

The Stepford Wives touches on many issues popular in America in the early and mid 1970s and even today: the battle of the sexes (Katherine Ross's husband wants her to give up the career she had in New York City before they moved to Stepford), the feminist movement (The heroines don't wear bras but put them on after they've been ""turned""), the sexual revolution (""My only tennis partners are two teenage boys with permanent erections."" ""Oh, really? Send them over to my place.""), liberal versus conservative lifestyles, environmentalism (""Maybe these companies are polluting the water and tranquilizing the women in this town.""), man's innate desire to create life without the help of women (The president of Stepford's Men's Association--Peter Lawford--is called 'Diz because he used to work for Disneyland where they build humanoid robots.), and the blandness or sameness of American suburbs (Everyone in Stepford drives a big station wagon. For you younger readers, the station wagon was the mini-van of the 1950s, 60s and 70s.)

The premise of this movie isn't silly but serious, and here's why: True, life-like androids aren't the stuff of science fiction but of pure fantasy. However, there are real methods of turning people into automatons involving surgery, drugs and social conditioning which should allow us to cut the makers of the film a little slack, although a story using these methods might have made for a more horrific and serious movie....I haven't read the book.

Since this movie was originally released in 1975 most people seem to agree that the male characters are portrayed as evil (although the men don't give up their wives lightly they do all go through with it in the end.) Feminist activists, leaders, etc. didn't and still don't like the film because the men do prevail and the women are powerless to stop them. They see the movie as more of a male fantasy full of negative stereotypes of women. However, when you see the film it's clear that these sterotypes were played for laughs.

Now, is this movie every man's fantasy? Well, yes, it is. But if you take a moment to think about it, isn't it true that when we realize our fantasies we often discover that the reality doesn't measure up? We men often fantasize about what life would be like if our wives didn't have ""issues"" or PMS, didn't gain weight or grow old, and never said no in the bedroom because we drove them wild with lust. But the fact is that a quiet, subserviant wife would sadden and disappoint most American men. We don't just want a lover, housekeeper or nanny; we want a partner and best friend. And that's what I came away with from The Stepford Wives. The film is an entertaining examination of American society and some of its more controversial issues, but more importantly it contains themes that left this viewer with a greater respect for the yin & yang relationship of men and women and the very American desire for freedom and the free will to take full advantage of it.",1130457600,8,3216,4.820652173913044
914534,3,6304697988,"I saw the re-make with Faith Hill, Nicole Kidman before seeing this version. But my thoughts were this: the original kept to one plot that Stepford was going to turn all of the wives into robots. I found myself beleiving the store in the original, the new one feels like they couldn't make up their minds, and it was too 'girl power' weirdness.

It was nice to see Joanna and Bobbie really become friends. I felt in the new version the they weren't as good of friends so when she become's 'Stepford' it didn't matter. When I watched the original it was really horrible when Bobbie changed.

Overall, I think that if you watch them both you will get a great movie alone.. I am really not sure which was better. Both had their faults. (Although - my husband will tell you the original is better because it was the 70's and the girls were wearing SHORT SHORT shorts...)",1123113600,4,866,4.440251572327044

A lot of the early feminist rhetoric was scary in it's anger and it shows thru Joanna and Bobbi.  The movie also reveals that Stepford was once a big NOW town but has since become housefrau heaven.  Joanna and Bobbi set out to find out why and are doomed.

The disturbing aspect, that noone ever mentions, in this film is that the Stepford men don't want new wives they want their old wives.  I could never understand why Walter needed to change his beautiful wife.  But now with a few years under my belt, I can see that the Eberhardt's marriage is on the rocks.  Joanna is on the verge of becoming a professional photographer and it is a real, unspoken threat that she will take the kids, blow out of Stepford back to the big city. In fact, I would bet that 90% of the Stepford men were in marriages heading into divorce.  The men's club program was a last ditch effort to keep broken marriages intact, to freeze their pretty wives at the height of their beauty and to never be bothered with feminine independence again.  The end of the film is still spooky.

Stay away from the remake.  It just focused on the campy aspects of the original and got it all wrong.  Also, this is 70's film.  Don't expect a lot of action but do expect a lot of great acting.

Quite frankly, IMO, both movies suck on different levels. This one set's up a womens fight to liberate herself and be strong, setting up various things along the way, only to fail and become what is expected of her. So, women are weak and won't win in the end is the moral of this film I take it?. That's why I did not like it, it's typical 60's crap where men are always the ones who come out on top.

The flow was boring, the story left things un-answered or just added for no other reason then to kill time, and the whole thing is not a comedy, not a thriller, it's a boring drama with a small twist of robotics sci-fi.

I dunno what any one see's in this, the end result does not pay off and quite frankly it is just boring. In-fact it was so boring, I think the remake was better and that's saying something shocking.",1118361600,3,1016,4.173469387755102

914571,5,6304697988,"This is a remarkable film. Some say it is dated. Maybe so, but there is nothing wrong with being dated if you are making a valid point in a fresh, eye-opening style, about the time and place in history, as this film director and screenwriter do with The Stepford Wives by Ira Levin.

The early 1970s were the height of the Women's Movement. Like other movements before it, there was a strong current of ideological militance on the part of some at the time, (and incidentally began to include men as well as women) enough so that a film of this artistic power and validity appearing in the movement's aftermath would by definition be incredibly frightening.

 Unusually enough, Ira Levin's brilliance includes his uncanny ability to write from the point-of-view of his heroines. Director Bryan Forbes and the screenwriter who adapted the work, rose to this task as well when they created this excellent movie.

Additionally, the casting of Katharine Ross as the heroine was an excellent choice--Ross was the epitomy of the 70s female with the combination of her strength of character, down-to-earth feminity and  warmth, as well as her subtle, natural beauty. It is genuinely horrifying because women of the 70s identified so much with Ross and her character Joanna, as well as her feisty, wise-cracking friend Bobbi. What happens to these women happens to us all as we watch the film.

 Those who did not live through the heydey of feminist consciousness-raising will also identify with this film, because of Joanna's human qualities that are universal, and because malevolence and abuse of power can be based anywhere, at any point in history where there are human beings who no longer feel connected to humanity, as happened when the men of Stepford betrayed their own wives and children in this finely crafted and horrifying movie.

Anyone who wants to see a fascinating and horrific tale that is short on blood-and-guts but long on genuine, horrifying intrigue that includes entertaining the impossible, would absolutely love this film.",1115769600,5,2041,5.017751479289941

914573,4,6304697988,"The Stepford Wives (1975) is a creepy and terrifying thriller. It is based on a novel by Ira Levin, author of Rosemary's Baby. Is there anyone out there who does not yet know the premise of this film?  If so, I will not spoil it for you.  The story is about young, beautiful Joanna Eberhart (Katherine Ross) who leaves New York City with her husband Walter (Peter Masterson) and their two children for a quiet life in the suburban (fictional) town of Stepford, Connecticut.  The town is lovely, but the women of Stepford are downright strange.  They always look glamourous.  They are softspoken, and seem to dote on cleaning, cooking, and grocery shopping.

Walter joins the Stepford Men's Association.  Joanna and her lively friend Bobbi (Paula Prentiss) set out to try and set up a Stepford Women's Club.  But the passive women only want to talk about spray starch.  Bobbi and Joanna try to solve the mystery of the domestic Stepford wives and the role of the men.

The movie, directed by British director Bryan Forbes, builds at a slow, steady pace, building mood and setting the scene.  On the downside, for a picture that won an award for sci-fi, there are few special effects.  Still, the psychological grip of the film is inescapable, as are its disturbing implications of the baseness of men in their expectations of perfect wives.

Many cultures such as Japan feature feminine, docile women who pride themselves in domestic arts and are proud to keep a tranquil home for their husbands and families.  Western culture, especially America during the Women's Lib movement, tends to downplay such women as backwards.  The United States really is the perfect setting for this film, which provides a unique and jarring look at gender roles in American society.

The DVD, released in 1997, has a few extras, such as the original movie trailer, and interviews with the director, producer, Katherine Ross, Paula Prentiss, and another actress.  It is interesting to see these women when they are older.  You can still see the film's impact remains with them, as it will with all who see it.",1113091200,3,2089,4.836619718309859
914574,5,6304697988,"This movie has usually been reviewed as an effective thriller--which it is. And slow-moving--which it is, too, but in terms of this Pre-Rambo era, this was normal. Many features of the time were slow moving--The Conversation, The Parallax View, Soylent Green, and most notably, Picnic at Hanging Rock, were all excellent movies that took quite a while to get moving. You're supposed to absorb everything that's going on.

The Stepford Wives, however, is underrated as a social commentary of the times. It's probably the only good movie that deals with Feminism, which was a cultural war very much on our minds at the time.

Many of the references will probably bewilder those younger than 35. For example, the scene with Joanna and Bobby on the steps. Talk is made of ""the Women's Lib thing in New York"" ""a Maidenform [bra] bonfire"", a ""consciousness-raising group"". Concerning the ""bonfire"", burning bras was a big thing in the early 70s--it symbolized freedom from feminine restraints.

Watch the scene of the men's party at Joanna's house--the camera dwells on Joanna's feminine curves, very obviously both bra-less and pantiless. This is a visual allusion to the ""bra-burning"" trend. At the end of the movie, there's a scene with ""Joanna"", bra-less, and much better endowed than before. There's a scene with pantyhose--a vital scene--too revealing to give away here. Pantyhose, widely worn in the 70s, was that most feminine, that quasi-sexist garment that can be said to strangle Joanna's sensibilities,  her independent ambitions. Our sensitivities have been numbed by a generation of mindless, Rambo-type movies. This is why many of the reviewers have looked at this movie with too literal an eye.

Some of the feminists allusions are too obvious to go into here. Suffice it to say they're numerous. As an example, one of the wives used to be the head of a women's group. Joanne and Bobby hear of this, and want to know more.

Listen closely to the dialogue. Much of the time, it's revealing. Bobby refuses to ""squeeze the goddamn Charmin"" or ""become one of those 'pot-scrubbers'"". The gossip talks about ""the first black couple to move in town--is it a good thing""? Later on, in the supermarket scene, the new black couple is arguing. Listen closely--the wife's unhappy, and wants to leave Stepford, and we viewers can see the cycle starting all over again.

The only criticism I can land on this movie is that the editing is flabby in spots. Establishing shots, in particular, seem too drawn-out, even for the era. But overall, I highly recommend this movie, both as a thriller and as a social commentary of the times.",1106697600,8,2627,4.956818181818182

I'm also extremely glad to watch this before I watch the new version with Nicole Kidman & Matthew Broderick. Upon watching it I was very pleasantly surprised. The cast is truly amazing and very well casted. I was even more surprised how much I enjoyed Tina Louise among many other noticeable actors today. The movie may start out slow, but ends up in an amazing eye opener plot line in the end. It is a bit predictable if you've read the book or know what the movie is already about, but it is still very entertaining from start to finish. I was also amazed about how creepy it made me feel and made me think for some reason of all new types of conspiracy theories. It's a really nice mix of sci-fi, thriller, and a little bit of horror. I know some people where highly disappointed or did not like the new version. I can't give my opinion on the new film version since I haven't seen it, but I will say always count on the original as being the best. This is no exception. The story is very well written and it's light unlike other thriller or horror movies. Plus the cast is amazing. It's a definite must see.

The DVD is very fun to and I was also surprised to see that it has extra's. A lot of classic films do not unless it was a big blockbuster. It has a behind the scene's (kind of) 18 minute clip of the actor's and director discussing the movie. Not to mention other enjoyable basic extra's.

So over all it's a must have for any fan of this genre or a lover of the classics.",1103500800,,1565,4.178807947019868
914636,4,6304697988,"In this 1975 screen adaptation of Ira Levin's novel, Katherine Ross and Peter Masterson star as the married couple who trade the big-city hustle for the serenity of a small Connecticut suburb;  Stepford.  This is a town in which perennially chipper wives dutifully tend to their husbands' every need, feverishly clean their houses and swoon over their children. The new women in town (Ross and Paula Prentiss) try to discover what's behind this domestic bliss, and their confrontations with the various townsfolk are what make the movie such a creepy, truly spine-tingling blast.

""The Stepford Wives"" provides audiences with some fairly interesting social commentary and cautionary feminist undertones while maintaining a satisfying level of suspense, and if nothing else, makes the pathetic 2004 remake look like precisely what it is; garbage.  After the disastrous remake, I really appreciated director Bryan Forbes' distinct story focus and his careful building of suspense.  It was wonderful to be able to watch an intelligent thriller that doesn't rely on special effects and blood for thrills and chills!",1100304000,2,1111,5.398843930635838
914637,4,6304697988,"With the remake of ""The Stepford Wives"" coming out on DVD next week I decided to watch the 1975 original again.  This is one of the most understated horror films of all time, more akin to an episode of ""The Twilight Zone"" than the bloodbaths that usually defined the genre at that time.  Of course, with William Goldman adapting Ira Levin's novel, you knew that this one was going to be more cerebral.

Stepford is a quaint little Connecticut town where the Eberharts have moved to in order to escape from New York City, whose urban horrors are reduced to the sight of a man carrying an inflatable rubber doll down the street.  The decision to move the family was done by the husband, Walter (Peter Masterson), who apparently makes all of the decisions for the Eberharts, much to the distress of his wife, Joanna (Katharine Ross).  She finds the idyllic life of Stepford to be too different and actually admits she misses the noise of the big city.  While her husband makes plans to join the local men's club, Joanna finds herself turning back to her love of photography as a way of keeping sane.  Then she finds a kindred spirit in neighbor Bobbie Markowe (Paula Prentiss), and they go off in search of other like-minded ladies for some increasingly necessary female bonding.

Everything that is wrong with Stepford is personified by Carol Van Sant (Nanette Newman), the perfect model of a Stepford wife, who lives next door.  There is something odd about Carol, for whom cleanliness is before everything else.  All of the other wives seem to be like Carol, with the exception of Charmaine Wimperis (Tina Louise), who seems all ready to complete the triad of sanity with Joanna and Bobbie.  But then, overnight, Charmaine becomes just like Carol and the others.  Bobbie thinks it has to be the water.  Of course, she never suspects the truth until it is way too late.

Of course everybody knows the twist.  ""The Stepford Wives"" became a paradigm for the flip side of the feminist movement of the Sixties.  While many women were interested in having their consciousness raised, some men were wishing they could drag their spouses back to the Stone Age.  Of course, Levin found a solution by going in the opposite direction.

My reading of this film has always been slightly idiosyncratic.  My sympathies are with Joanna, not because she is a gifted artist with a camera who deserves to become self-actualized and do more with her life than take care of the house and kids seven days a week, but because she is Katharine Ross.  After ""The Graduate"" and ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,"" Ross was the actress from the Sixties that I thought of as being the most beautiful.  Consequently, when Walter is unsatisfied with his wife I find it unbelievable because the man is married to Katharine Ross.  She is bright, she is articulate, she has a cute smile to go along with great eyes, and there is no reason to enhance her bust line.  Walter is a toad who has married far above what he deserves.

""The Stepford Wives"" is an exercise in misdirection, and not simply because most of the clues hint at something simpler than advanced robotics.  The story spends most of its time trying to figure WHAT is going on, with directly addressing the question of WHY.  Goldman's satire is often too subtle.  A pivotal scene is when Joanna, Carol and Charmaine get together with a couple of the other wives to unburden themselves.  The three women each admit deep dark secrets, unbarring their souls.  The other women get rhapsodic over cleaning agents.  Clearly there is a wide gulf here, but the idea that gender equality would result in a male backlash that would do more than simply yearn for the good ol' days never becomes explicit.  There is a lot more going on here than rehashing ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" for a new generation.

The movie also requires Joanna not to put two and two together in enough time to flee Stepford, although she does have two children who can be used against her at the key moment.  Still, ""The Stepford Wives"" cannot be accused of being heavy handed, which is usually the fatal flaw in such thrillers and the final scene is as elegant a conclusion to a horror movie as you are going to find in the genre.  I still pity the Stepford husbands, who think that perfect housewives make the world a far, far better place.",1099699200,4,4346,4.66010498687664
914638,4,6304697988,"The Stepford Wives is a great, slick piece of entertainment.  Beautifully shot, carefully directed and well cast, this makes for some first-rate entertainment.  Is it about feminisim? Chauvanism? The quest for perfection?  Any and all really.  Goldman did a great job scripting Levin's novel.  It is mysterious, creepy, sometimes languid and it still manages a great number of tongue-in-cheek moments.  Ultimately, it's not WHAT is happening to these women (how many clues and winks can they give you) rather it's about whether our heroine will succumb to the same fate.  The final shot is the ultimate gasp and chuckle moment.  Ross, O'Neal and Masterson are fine.  Paula Prentiss is the perfect wiseass who keeps it in check just enough so that she herself does not become a joke.  The film holds up well and the DVD looks great.

914639,5,6304697988,"Katherine Ross and Paula Prentiss are great as Joanna and Bobbie, two women who can't figure out why the rest of the females in Stepford are so subservient and docile. Of course, the husbands are all thrilled with their blank, utterly domesticated spouses. Joanna and Bobbie attempt to put together a women's consciousness-raising meeting, only to find the other wives discussing their homelife, chores, etc. Any effort by our heroines to actually discuss anything with substance is squelched by more ""brownie recipe""-type blather. Joanna and Bobbie are joined by Charmaine (Tina Louise) who shares their suspicions and disgust for all things Stepford. Unfortunately, just when this trio gets going, Charmaine is somehow assimilated into the mindless suburban collective! She even lets her husband bulldoze her beloved tennis court to put in a swimming pool he desires. Things really start getting weird! Bobbie goes on a weekend getaway with her hubby. When she returns, she too is a member of the frilly apron society! Joanna confronts the ""new"" Bobbie in her kitchen. In the freakiest scene of the movie, Joanna stabs Bobbie with a steak-knife, causing her to short-circuit and repeat the same words and actions over and over! Joanna is now alone in a nightmare world of idiot bliss. Determined to get to the bottom of it all, she meets face to face with the true horror behind Stepford and it's Men's Club. The final scene is a classic moment of sheer terror! Highly recommended...",1095292800,6,1485,5.0653061224489795
914640,5,6304697988,"Having seen the Nicole Kidman/Matthew Broderick remake of the Stepford Wives made me want to recheck the original.  Yes, the original version based on Ira Levin's novel far supercedes the original.  On one level, it's a great suspense story that slowly draws the viewer in, peeling away the seemingly paradise of Stepford to reveal something downright sinister and disturbing.  On another, it serves as a 1970's time capsule, where women shone the spotlight on themselves at the height of the feminist movement.

Stepford seems to be an idyllic place, where no one has to lock their doors and where the Eberhardts, who have recently moved there from the Big Apple, witness the friendliest car accident in the shopping center parking lot.  For husband Walter, a balding and sort of wishy-washy lawyer, charmed by the neighbourliness of their neighbour, Carol Van Sant, Stepford is a change for the better.  Not for his wife Joanna, an amateur photographer who misses the noise of the big city.

At first, Joanna's depressed and bored because of the quietude of the place, but then she meets Bobbie Markow, an ex-Gothamite who ""doesn't want to squeeze the Charmin.""  She gushingly praises Joanna's messy kitchen, then tells her about the Men's Association, where all the men hang out.  The building itself is a mansion of sorts, and a nocturnal shot of it contains sinister overtones.  Well, why isn't there a Women's Association?  And why not start one?

Part of the reason is that most of the women are too busy being good little housewives.  They do gain an ally in Charmaine Wimperis, but others are politely disinterested.  In fact when they manage to get together to start a consciousness-raising session, they find a reluctance to participate except in domestic matters.  However, things really perk up  when the genteel Carol (Nanette Newman) has a bit too much to drink at a party, repeatedly says the same things to various people, and later, is then made to complacently apologize to everyone for her behaviour, an action Joanna and Bobbie find absolutely galling.

Another is when they accidentally visit a friend and hear her engaging in bedroom activities, calling her man the best.  However, when they actually see him, he isn't exactly an Elvis lookalike.  Why are the women so complacent here?  Because in an exaggerated sense, as Billie Jean King noted in the dissonance of gender equality, ""the system here is men.""

The mention of consciousness-raising by Joanna and Bobbie makes this a 70's period piece.  It was of course during this time that small discussion groups constituting young students, professional women, and suburban housewives like Joanna and Bobbie shared their experiences and frustrations with men as well as rethinking their relationships with the same.  They embody those fighting private battles as opposed to other feminists more concerned with the big picture, the political struggles of women en masse.  But it also denotes the concern that women want to count.  Joanna tells a photo gallery owner to whom she shows her photos that she wants to be remembered.  Indeed, if sports was where anyone can make gains, why not women in photography? (q.v. Margaret Bourke-White)

Given the women's lib overtones of this movie, it's no surprise that the female performers outshine the males, and how!  With those wide, expressive, and thoughtful eyes, a natural sort of beauty, and someone beautiful yet tough, Katherine Ross (Joanna) serves as one of the pivots in this movie.  Paula Prentiss as Bobbie wins second prize, someone with attitude, a tart sense of humour, and someone just plain fun to be with.  And after being rescued from Gilligan's Island, Tina Louise moved to Stepford, taking on the role of Charmaine.

With electronic music by Suzanne Ciani, the original Stepford Wives is an intriguing period piece, with more suspense, thoughtfulness, and a terrifying and ultimately heartbreaking ending, set to matching strings.",1090800000,4,3970,5.099071207430341

914702,2,6304697988,"A film by Bryan Forbes
This film is the first ""Stepford Wives"" movie and is adapted from Ira Levin's novel of the same name.  The tone of this film is much different than the newer version.  The new ""Stepford Wives"" is more of a comedy, but this version fits into the horror/thriller/suspense genre.  It deals with an idea that should scare the feminist movement: that men would rather trade their wife in for a human looking robot than have a strong woman as a mate.  When this movie was released in 1975, ""The Stepford Wives"" had a social identity and a social relevance to the feminist movement.  In that vein, the movie might have been more powerful twenty years ago, but I can only react to how it played today.
Walter (Peter Masterson) and Joanna (Katherine Ross) are moving from the big city to the smaller town of Stepford.  Joanna is unnerved by the women of Stepford.  They all seem to be very happy and content in their lives...lives that are solely focused on pleasing their husbands.  Joanna thinks that something is wrong, and seems to get confirmation when new residents who start out normal begin changing dramatically to the ""Stepford"" type wife.  The tone of this film leans towards suspense as tension is building throughout the film as hints are given and Joanna's fear mounts as to what is happening and what may very well happen to her.
The movie has a great idea behind it.  The whole concept of Stepford is wonderful for a movie (and a book, too) and it should work much better than it does.  The problem is that the acting was not very good, but that may be because the dialogue the actors were given wasn't much better.  A big example of this is the character of Bobbie (Paula Prentiss).  She comes off as a very hokey character, somewhat hickish, though the character has pretenses of being a true feminist.  No character is truly given a chance to develop or show a personality, not even the characters which are supposed to actually have a personality.  ""The Stepford Wives"" was just a disappointing movie, though I can imagine it had more of an impact in 1975, but surely not for the quality of the picture.  The impact must have been for what the movie was about.  The only thing I found truly interesting about ""The Stepford Wives"" is that this is the film debut of a young Mary Stuart Masterson (the son of Peter Masterson).

914705,5,6304697988,"THE STEPFORD WIVES was a unique film.  It set out to make a horror film where clean spotless sunlit kitchens were just as scary as rainy spooky old mansions at midnight. Made in the mid 1970s during a wave of feminism and controversy over the ERA Ammendment - it never got the acclaim it deserved for it's building creepiness and Sci Fi twists.  The remake is what it is, but here's where most people first glimpsed Stepford - a very real suburb where homemaking is a science.
Katharine Ross(in an EXCELLENT turn)plays Joanna Eberhard who moves from NYC to Stepford with her husband and two daughters.  She's a photographer and homemaker who's dabbled in the women's movement but never really taken up the cause.  She begins to realize the women of Stepford are all obsessed with housework, and worse ... subservient and servile to their husbands.  She joins up with another woman who finds this all strange, Bobbie -- played oustandingly by Paula Prentiss.  Together they find out a string of clues that maybe not all is well in Stepford, and the seemingly benign suburban bliss may be MANUFACTURED by the creepy Men's Society that every husband is a part of.
Bryan Forbes took over this project after speculations Brian De Palma should film it.  He made a very effective treatment of the novel, but added his own touches.  His wife Nannette Newman influenced the costumes by demanding rather than proposed Playboy bunny outfits the wives should look Victorian with hats and gloves and long dresses - creepy and sexy.  Tina Louise (Ginger on Gilligan's Island) also makes a great cameo as Charmaine - one of Joanna and Bobbie's radical friends who transforms to a Stepford Wife by startingly ripping up her tennis court for a pool her husband wants.
You get the film in widescreen, and the transfer is passable for a movie of this age.  Colors are 1970s soft and there is grain, but it looks fine.  You get a 12 minute featurette with all the principle players, and they explain how the movie was made and what it was like.  Some people say the pacing was slow, but this was the 1970s!  I think its suppposed to develop slowly like the novel, and you get to know the characters.  The last ten minutes are completely shocking, and no test audiences made them whimp out (cough cough - the remake's ending was reshot).  This was a politically relevant well-crafted film with great acting!  Superb in every way!  Check out the source novel by Ira Levin as well.",1087776000,3,2458,4.6923076923076925

Very quickly you get the idea that something isn't quite right.  The women are perfect, too perfect.  As the story unfolds you begin to see how the intricate pieces of the plot fit together.  You are given clues from time to time, but again they are subtle so you have to pay attention.  The husbands in the town are guarding some sort of secret and the newer wives are nervous about it, but a weekend alone with hubby solves everything for each of them.  This weekend gives the ladies a newfound love and respect for their spouses, children, homes, and spray starch.
The part of Dale ""Diz"" Coba played brilliantly by Patrick O'Neal is one of the least developed but most interesting in the movie.  There is so much more the director could have done with his part.  Tina Louise is also very good as Charmaine Wimperis, showing us a side of her acting talent far removed from ""Gilligan's Island.""
The last 10 minutes of the movie are so grippingly suspenseful that they are worth the whole of the movie.  If you like suspense and twists, you are going to love this movie!",1045180800,3,1635,4.42
914791,5,6304697988,"Growing up in the supposedly 'post-feminist' era, I heard ""Stepford Wife"" thrown about in popculture reference to a severely represed woman without individual being. This dour description almost turned me off of this delightful movie.
Yet, a college intervention convinced me to give the title another chance. For the film wasn't actually celebrating such women, offering a cautionary tale instead of how dreary and horrific such life actually was.
The men of Stepford are supposedly happy with their robotic wives, but how secure are they with themselves if they had to create virtual doormats? Furthermore, what kind of homelife did this virtual hell create for the children (who undoubtedly would have been traumatized by the ordeal)?
My feminist self liked the movie precisely because the classic script exploited the tension between culture and politics suspesfully. The camp factor (delightfully high) and the now dated appearance of many wardrobe ensembles adds to the overall sense of disorientation. We know something is not quite right, but cannot initally (along with the main character) decipher what it is untill revealled.
Sure movie makers could have sat down, planned and filmed a conventional (inevitably stodgy) doccumentary showing how things are ultimately better when each woman is allowed to fufill their own individual dreams, but that would have not had the same appeal. Audiences at the 1975 premire and thereafter may have not realized they were participating in a feminist conciousness raiser themselves.
This film was intended for the audiences who would not neccessarily go down to the corner newstand and buy Ms. magazine, attend the meetings of the local feminist group, but nevertheless needed simmiliar information---and perhaps even more so than the other groups.",1044576000,,1797,5.421428571428572
914792,4,6304697988,"The ""Stepford Wives"" is every man's fantasy and every feminist's nightmare come to life. Based on the book by Ira Levin, the film is a commentary on the social roles of men and women within society, taken to the extreme.
 The film tells the story of Joanna Eberhart (Katherine Ross), a wife and mother, who is being reluctantly uprooted from her home and career as a photographer in New York City, to a quiet little community known as Stepford.....a suburban Garden of Eden, seemingly picture-perfect in every way. Although unhappy, Joanna gamely attempts to make this new life work for the sake of her husband and children. She even plays the dutiful hostess for the local men's club, which her husband, Walter, is joining. It isn't long however, before Joanna begins to suspect that something is not quite right about the town and it's inhabitants, especially the women, who seem to have absolutely no aspirations other than being the perfect housewife and mother.
 Fortunately, Joanna finds an ally in the form of Bobbie Marco (Paula Prentiss), also a new arrival in town, who shares Joanna's distaste for her surroundings. Together, the two women attempt to bolster the local women toward higher ambitions than that of cooking, cleaning, and beauty tips. All to no avail.
 As the film progresses, Joanna and Bobbi become increasingly convinced that something sinister is going on here and are determined to get to the root of the matter. After Bobbi returns from a weekend get-away with her husband, Joanna is horrified to find that Bobbi has become like all the rest of the wives. Only then does Joanna stumble upon the town's terrible secret.
 The film's climax is effectively disturbing and doesn't sell-out for the ""happily ever after"" ending that so many films do. Then again, depending on your viewpoint, maybe it does. A thought provoking film, it raises the questions of how men and women view each other and what it is that they want and expect from the opposite sex as well as what are the ""perfect"" qualities which make up a mate.
 The performances are generally good all around with Paula Prentiss providing the bulk of the comic relief in the movie. Her character is the antithesis of the perfect housewife and is not shy about showing her dislike for all things domestic. A very young Mary Stewart Masterson makes her screen debut here as one of Joanna's two daughters.
 The Silver Anniversary Edition DVD is a high quality product and includes a widescreen format, interviews with director Bryan Forbes, Producer Edgar J. Scherick and cast members Katherine Ross, Paula Prentiss, Nanette Newman and Peter Masterson. It also contains the theatrical trailer, radio spots, talent bios, and a language selection.",1040947200,2,2727,4.956236323851203
914793,4,6304697988,"Whether or not you've actually seen it, you'll probably have heard of ""The Stepford Wives"". Based on Ira Levin's novel, it was produced in the 1970s and has endured in the public consciousness ever since. Indeed the terms ""Stepford"" and ""Stepford Wife"" are now part of our vernacular. If you're in any doubt what these expressions mean, just imagine a woman who is the perfect male fantasy...a wife who cooks, cleans and keeps her husband's home to perfection whilst remaining an object of beauty, with well-preserved looks, sexy outfits and just the right-sized cleavage. A female who is there to service her man's every need - domestic, emotional, sexual - whilst never questioning her role as devoted housewife.<P... but the  ""The Stepford Wives"" remains a powerful and disturbing movie, because it shows what could happen if men allowed their fantasies about women to become a reality.
The film tells the tale of New York housewife and photographer Joanna Eberhart, who moves with her lawyer husband Walter (sexy name - not!) and their two kids to the seemingly idyllic rural town of Stepford. Very soon Joanna becomes disenchanted with her surroundings, missing the liveliness of New York. Her feelings of isolation are compounded by the fact that the other women in the town appear content to stay at home for their husbands as loyal house fraus, with no outside interests whatsoever. Also, all new male arrivals in Stepford are invited to join ""The Men's Association"", an organisation from which the town's women are strictly excluded. Whatever goes on there remains a mystery; the women aren't told.
Fortunately Joanna meets the effervescent and rebellious Bobby Marco, another recent arrival in Stepford who shares her concerns about the strange behaviour of the women in the community. Together they decide to set up a consciousness-raising group and rally to get the local women involved...almost to no avail! At the first meeting of the wives, the other women prefer to agonise over the cleanliness of their kitchens and talk about the wonders of ""Easy-On"" starch spray and baking. One other recruit is found though; a feisty redhead called Charmaine who feels restricted by her husband Ed's demands. However after a weekend away with him, Charmaine returns strangely altered, allowing her hubby to bulldoze her much-loved tennis court and confessing that she all she wanted to do was ""please Ed...and boy am I gonna please him"". Weird.
Mystified, Joanna and Bobby seek an answer to the zombie-like behaviour of the local women, wondering if ""something in the water"" might be responsible. They enlist one of Joanna's ex boyfriends, who is a scientist, to help, but this fails to pay dividends. Joanna soon comes to the frightening realisation that the town's wives undergo a change in personality after they have been resident in Stepford for roughly three months... and her time is almost up...
I won't give any more away but this is a thought-provoking and intriguing movie!! Although low on action, the film builds its sense of momentum through a growing feeling of paranoia: are the women in the town somehow being ""substituted"" for drone-like replacements? Or are all of Joanna's anxieties inside her own head? If you're looking for a fast-moving film you might be disappointed, but the cleverness of the movie lies in its subtlety and the way in which the events take place in a seemingly normal domestic setting.
Another reason for this movie's success lies in the acting. Katherine Ross (also of ""The Graduate"") puts in an intelligent, sympathetic performance as a woman who feels increasingly hemmed in by the claustrophobia of Stepford, and you really root for her as she feels she might be next on the list for ""conversion"". Paula Prentiss is great as Bobby, a funny, bubbly and tomboyish character determined not to become ""one of those pan-scrubbers"" and the rapport between her and Joanna is believable and touching. Given her determination to escape Stepford, Bobby's last few scenes are all the more poignant; I won't say any more but they make for some of the film's best moments! The supporting cast do a good job: amongst these are Peter Masterson as Walter, becoming gradually less supportive of his wife's feelings and fears and more and more influenced by the demands of the ""Men's Association""; and Nanette Newman as Carol Van Sant, one of the wives who starts behaving very oddly at a barbecue, continually proclaiming ""I'll just die if I don't get that recipe"" (!!) Newman's role as a wife is all the more ironic considering all those ""Fairy Liquid"" adverts she once did (remember?!)
The movie has also attained a kitsch/camp quality over time, mostly due to the fact that it was made in the 1970s! This doesn't spoil the subtler elements to the film, rather makes it all the more entertaining! A large part of the camp appeal is down to the wives themselves - their appearance, behaviour and dialogue. According to this movie, men would like nothing better than to see their wives dressed in frilly blouses (still showing off their assets), flowery dresses and big floppy hats - hilarious. The wives all say things like ""I really shouldn't say it, but I just love my brownies"" (that's cakes in case you were wondering) and constantly praise their husbands' performances in the bedroom department: ""You're the King....you're the Master""!! No comment!
To summarise this is a very enjoyable movie, which, as I have already mentioned, shows the dangers of male fantasies coming true and the perils that women must face having to exist in a patriarchal society. Go buy it...but don't get any ideas about changing your girlfriend...okay?!",1036195200,90,5670,5.012725344644751
914842,3,6304697988,"This is a well made adaptation of the thought provoking, tautly written novella of the same name by Ira Levin, author of ""Rosemary's Baby"". It was first released in 1975 and became a box office smash.
The story is very simple, but gripping and well written. Joanna Eberhart (Katherine Ross) moves to the seemingly bucolic town of Stepford with her husband, Walter (Peter Masterson), and two children, leaving behind the dangers of big city living. An independent, assertive, intelligent, and creative woman, Joanna epitomizes the newly liberated women of the nineteen seventies. Looking for like souls with whom to become friends, she seeks out some of the other married women of the town, only to find that they are, for the most part, all uniformly addicted to housework, give their husbands complete obeisance, are made up to the gills, and have figures courtesy of more than maidenform.
Joanna manages to find two like minded women such as herself, Bobbie Marlowe (Paula Prentiss) and Charmaine Wimperis (Tina Louise) with whom to pal around. Bobbie, however, has a creepy feeling about the town and the women that seem to dominate the landscape and wants to move out of Stepford at the first possible moment. Then, a series of puzzling events occur, and Joanna becomes convinced that the town's mysterious Men's Association, presided over by the slightly sinister and chauvinistic Dale Coba (Patrick O'Neal), has hatched a sinister plot to change all the wives of Stepford into submissive Barbie dolls. Will Joanna manage to escape the fate of the rest of the Stepford wives? Watch the film and find out.
This film, coming out on the heels of the feminist movement, struck a deep chord at the time of its release. No one can doubt that the women represented by Joanna, Bobbie, and Charmaine are infinitely more interesting than the lady in the kitchen-whore in the bedroom stereotype desired by the Stepford men, who were, for the most part, physically unprepossessing, though successful. Have things changed all that much in terms of what successful men want in their wives? Instead of the submissive, Betty Crocker, little Miss Homemaker, Barbie doll type desired by the men in this film, many successful men today desire young, submissive, trophy wives with boob jobs. So what has really changed in the quarter of a century since this film was released?
Katherine Ross, Paula Prentiss, and Tina Louise all give fine performances. Patrick O'Neal is terrific as the slightly sinister and supercilious President of the Stepford Men's Association. All in all, this is a moderately suspenseful and enjoyable film. The DVD provides crystal clear audio and decent visual. The only problem is that one would think that the silver anniversary edition would offer a little more by way of special features than interviews with the director, producers, and stars.",1029628800,7,2859,5.072186836518047
914843,4,6304697988,"The Stepford Wives is one of those movies that really seems to be of its time as a period piece, but still contains themes that are worth noting. Although its primarily a study on the importance of the individual and the importance of feminist ideology in the 70's as opposed to the house frau ideology of the 1950's patriarchy, it serves as an example of why individuality and non conformity are values to be treasured, not buried to keep up a facade of subservience. Paula Prentiss and Katherine Ross turn in solid performances as well. Ross' usurption by her soulless doppleganger at the end is a priceless scene.

914846,4,6304697988,"After hearing references made again and again to The Stepford Wives, I decided to take a chance and buy it on DVD.  It was only 12.99, so I figured I had very little to lose.  The film is shot and directed in a very 70s style, which can be hard to follow or even annoying for younger, Gen-X viewers (like myself...I was born the year the movie came out) but if you just sit through it, it eventually gets EXTREMELY good.  I did not know how the movie ended or what the plot even was, so I found the film particularly thrilling.  I paid attention to the foreshadowing, but I figured that the Stepford wives were tamed into submission by coercion, beating, threats, or some other plausible method.  It becomes obvious when Ross's character's best friend becomes a ""Stepford Wife"" that they are being replaced by robots.  The sight of Ross coming face to face with her hollow-eyed double, a robot that is not quite finished, is terrifying.  People my age don't have the cultural or historical perspective to understand what this film meant when it was released, but 25 years' worth of hindsight allows my younger generation to make the film our own.  Feminists were extremely annoyed with this film, saying it was anti-woman, but I think the opposite is true.  It is not exactly pro-woman, but it is definitely anti-man.  The message I got was that men were too insecure to cope with their wives' growing independence during an era of cultural and sexual liberation, so they simply replaced them with robots.

Hey, but what do I know, I'm an MTV 80's baby, raised by Madonna.

The argument of the movie has lost a great deal of impact nowadays but I can imagine the reactions of our female companions in 1975 when watching the fate of the poor Stepford wives. However, one may still appreciate the cynicism of the movie and the performances of the feminine cast that is excellent.
As for the DVD, Anchor Bay has done another great job and presents apart of the trailer and a french dubbed version (very, very bad !), recent interviews of the cast including the producer and the director.

The first time i saw this film, I  had NO clue what was going on in Stepford.  I followed Kathering Ross' character Joanna as she tries her best to fit in with life in the small New England town that her husband move her and their children to.  I felt her unease at the things she saw.  I felt her frustration at not being taken seriously.  And like Katherine's character, I didn't know WHY I felt so uneasy.  This was the perfect town, wasn't it.  NOT BY A LONG SHOT.  This is a movie that unfolds at its own pace, occasionally droping clues to the viewer, without them even realising.  It is only through repeated viewings that you realise how much you missed.  I have watched this movie over and over, with people who have never seen it before, and they walk away with the same unease that I felt. Although not a ""horror"" film, in the classic sense, this movie is horrifying in its implications.  Enjoy it for what it is, a bit of film history that has spawned 2 (bad) sequels.

914851,2,6304697988,"This film is an unoriginal variation upon Invasion of the Body Snatchers.  As in Invasion of the Body Snatchers, people are being systematically replaced by unemotional drones and the lead character attempts to uncover the truth.  Only in this case, instead of aliens targeting the population of earth, a men's club in a small town is replacing its members' wives with robots.  This could be the perfect setup for both a good horror movie and for a social satire on the battle of the sexes.  However, unlike the brilliant Body Snatchers, this film is neither good horror or good social commentary.
Basically, as soon as any family moves to the sleepy town of Stepford, even the most loving of husbands turns into such a male chauvanist pig that he becomes willing to kill his wife and replace her with what must be a multi-million (maybe even billion) dollar robot.  What is it that makes the men in that town so upset with their wives?  Why, they do things like play tennis in their spare time and get together to drink iced tea when they aren't cooking and cleaning!  Apparently, the men want wives who do nothing more than clean the house and take care of their kids (it appears the husbands don't even want sex!).  Of course, it would be a lot simpler for the men to get divorced and hire maids instead of resorting to multi-million dollar technology and murder, but every single character in this movie is so one-dimensional and stupid that such behaviour is actually consistent with their characters.
There is no real suspense since you know what is happening almost from the beginning and the lead female is the only even slightly sympathetic character.  Personally, I could not tell the difference between most of the original females and their replacement robots (except for the fact that the robots occassionally break down).  And suggesting that this movie is social commentary is like suggesting that a discussion on who's stronger, the Hulk or Superman, is a valid and worthwhile discussion about national defence capabilities. The characters and town in this movie have absolutely no connection to reality whatsoever.

914935,4,6304697988,"""When you hire Bryan Forbes, you get Nanette Newman,"" says the producer of the Stepford Wives in the revealing featurette interview.  (Actually you seem to get the entire Forbes family on this one -- their young daughter, who later went on to introduce BBC kids programmes, makes one or two silent appearances in the movie.)  And therein hangs the cause of much of the internal wrangling in the making of this film.
Writer William Goldman said that the film would have done much better at the box office if Nanette Newman hadn't appeared in it.  (OK, so she's no great actress, and her American accent is crummy, but she's not bad as a robot.)  In interview, Forbes says how offensive he found that remark and that he has never spoken again to Goldman.  Goldman was perhaps more offended that Forbes re-wrote much of the Oscar-winner's script.
But as one of the interviewees says, bringing in Newman forced a substantial re-write of the script.  The original idea of these Barbie babes who never age would have been best illustrated by tight, sexy clothes.  But Newman would not have looked good, and this forced the switch to frilly long dresses.
Forbes in interview seems unsure whether the movie is a feminist movie or not.  He's right to say that it's certainly not anti-feminist.  My favourite scene, though, is when the three real women finally get around to hold what they euphemistically call a ""consciousness-raising"" session, and it turns out that they just want to complain about their husbands.
My least favourite scenes are towards the end at the Mens' Association because it seems such a cliche to stage the climax in a gothic mansion.  If they ever remake this movie, you would surely see some of the hi-tech labs where the robots are manufactured.  I've only seen this movie once before -- in the late 1970s -- and I thought that Katherine Ross's character actually did break into one of the many computer companies parked just outside Stepford.  Shows you how poor my memory is; I must have been confusing this with Woody Allen's SLEEPER!
But I was such a confused teenager in the 1970s that I thought THE STEPFORD WIVES must have something to do with THE ROCKFORD FILES.  Sad, isn't it?
This is a cult movie, but I'm not sure it's a great movie.  It may be too low-budget and, for a sci-fi movie, lacking in special effects for today's youth audiences.  These days I like things to be clarified for me.  Why are the Stepford men -- who are presumably non-robotic -- nearly as dreary as their wives?  Why wasn't more made of the psychotherapist, who comes across very ambiguously as only partly human?  You really fear she's going to turn Katherine Ross over to the men anyway, but she never gets that opportunity.

I thought it was interesting that the men were as dull and humorless as the robots they replaced their wives with; also, that  Joanna and her friend Bobby (as well as their husbands) have already made  compromises in their lives:  Joanna's deference to her husbands wish to  move to Stepford, Bobbie's comment about her last name of Markoe having  been changed from the more ethnic (Jewish?) Markowitz.  Her own last name  has been given up for her husband's in marriage; her husband's last name  has been altered to sound more homogenous.  Another interesting aspect of  the movie is the town's highly technological economic base, while its  surface appearance is of a traditional, idealized village, culminating in  the men's organization headquarters, which is a  historic restored mansion  and must be preserved (much like the men are preserving their wives'  youthful beauty by replicating them as robots)as explained to Joanna by the  security guard when he warns her to stick close to her home.  When Joanna  is lured inside at the end, it turns out to be a sterile, dark and empty  place, much like the minds and bodies of the robots, except for the curious  replica of her bedroom, which is apparently designed to get the robot used  to its most important place, where it will perform for Joanna's husband(or  perhaps already has).  It was also interesting that Joanna is unsuccessful  at interesting the male gallery owner in her photographs until she  insecurely pleads her case with unthreateningly domestic and cute subject  matter: photographs of her and Bobbie's children.  Even then, the gallery  owner asks her 'what she wants to get out it', as if she needs to justify  herself as a woman daring to take pictures; Joanna's response is somewhat  conflicted; over and over again she gives in passively in the face of male  opposition.",955324800,4,1942,4.934782608695652

7876022,3,6304697988,"Movie 3 of 1975 and 24 overall in my journey through films of my lifetime. I timed ""The Stepford Wives"" in conjunction with Halloween and it wasn't really until the 3rd act until that choice paid off. I always heard about this movie/story and it came off to me as a horror trope. Indeed there are ways in which it is just that. The idea of losing control is maybe the supreme horror axiom. ""The Exorcist"" and ""Night of the Living Dead"" are two that come to mind. I'm not saying that ""The Stepford Wives"" is that level of horror or quality but it had its moments. The third act is when it really takes a turn into the macabre and that was quite enjoyable.
While I don't usually appreciate politics in my movies (although sometimes it is unavoidable) ""The Stepford Wives"" is clever in its implementation and I actually couldn't imagine the story told without some of its feminist elements. Perhaps I find older feminism more reasonable but I'm not sure. I will say that there were moments where the movie does hit you over the head with its allegory but that didn't detract from how well ingrained it was into the story overall. The main character is well acted and compelling. Her relationship with her husband is played very well and there is a time where the film makes her seem crazy in the eyes of the husband and you can't blame him. I'm not sure a modern version of this would have done that so it was refreshing to see the husband humanized rather than being a feminists caracture of a male which is usually what you get these days.
I'd like to take a moment to compliment the music. It was perfection. I actually, personally liked none of it but it worked and was appropriate. The best scene in the movie comes near the end when we see a ""malfunction"" of a stepford wife and a rather than show circuits and smoke we hear robotic music, really cool. BTW that malfunction scene was as good as any I have vertigo seen in a horror movie. I found myself smiling at its creepy camera angles and unnatural disposition. It was as if the director wanted to plunge you into the uncanny valley and he did and did it well.
Some elements suffered from just being an older movie. The film quality was not even as good as some of its contemporaries like ""Barry Lyndon."" Today, with digital, it seems even the lowest budget film will have decent looking quality. Now for ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" the low quality film stock gave it that ""Grindhouse"" look that so many directors strive for. That didn't work for ""The Stepford Wives."" It needed a clean look, a polished world of perfection that reflected the whims of its antagonists. It needed to look like a compelling place to be so that when the ugly truth was unearthed you would feel duped.
In conclusion, I liked it. I'm not sure it was a horror film but it was a good movie to watch on a Sunday night with my wife.
Pros
-well directed (especially the final scene in the grocery store, complex blocking and camera movements in one take but done flawlessly to great effect)
-powerful third act (although a main character is discarded too hastily)
-good comedic moments
-music was well done
-worked as a political satire (a rare exception IMO)
Cons
-low film quality takes you out of the experience
-relational resolution between the husband and wife was unsatisfactory
-a little slow toward the end of the second act",1509235200,2,3365,4.527093596059113
