I very much like the packaging of the set. The disks are well protected without taking up extra space with cases. There are three cases: seasons 1 - 4, seasons 5 - 8, and seasons 9 - 10, with a cardboard sleeve for all three.",1433808000,7,392,4.144736842105263
6992040,5,B00STKR50Q,I bought this series because I liked NCIS. This is different but still shows respect for the services. My wife and I are enjoying watching this very much.,1433635200,2,154,4.535714285714286

6992046,5,B00STKR50Q,"Came nicely packaged. The seasons were broken out into 3 ""books"", seasons: 1-4, 5-8, and 9-10. In each book there was the regular DVD plastic holders, assembled like pages in a book. Easy to flip thru and find what you are looking for.  They did not come in cardboard sleeves as mentioned in other posts. All disks accounted for and in excellent condition at a really great price.

6992052,4,B00STKR50Q,"This was a replacement order because the first time I bought them one DVD arrived loose in the case and scratched-the exchange order was processed quickly and without question, arriving in great condition (visually-speaking). It will take me a while to play through all the discs and notice if there is any issue-hopefully not.

As far as the show goes-one of my favorite TV series! This is why I purchased it. Older show, so the effects are sometimes a little obvious, but great stories, plots, acting and themes. I love the humor mixed with serious content, and the great writing. This is where NCIS had its start. Good stuff! I love that Amazon made it possible for me to find the whole show-it's getting more difficult to find in libraries and store shelves now. Good price, good value, good service.",1529366400,,804,4.742857142857143

Nitpicking here--  Disks are hard to read because they're not easy to read which disk or season you're on.

No captions.  I'm not deaf, but I do use the captions on everything because I have a loud 3 and a half year old. :)",1528848000,,308,4.241379310344827

6992073,1,B00STKR50Q,"Don't waste your time with this series.  Even the pilot was bad, boring, and confusing.  Compared to Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman Jag deserves a MINUS 10 stars!  JAG is nothing more than free publicity for the military.",1524096000,,215,4.756756756756757

6992076,5,B00STKR50Q,"This show is fabulous.  I never saw this when it aired on the network, but I had heard of it.  Not being a fan of Navy shows, I passed on it when it first aired since I'm more into Army and Marine TV shows and movies.  This show has everything and not just scenes on ships.  There is a lot of action and explosions throughout the series.  There were a lot of scenes where I wondered if a main character would leave a bad situation alive because they did kill off main characters.  There were several supernatural episodes that were interesting.

I'm a big fan of Catherine Bell which is why I purchased this show sight unseen and I was not disappointed.  The acting and writing are better than most shows and I wish it lasted at least another year as they anticipated even though many were leaving the show.  For me it got better after the first season when they got rid of one character who could be easily hated.  I think he left at the beginning of the second season.

The episodes in the courtroom and JAG office were great and many of the stories were based on true cases.  I got a kick out of the JAG Admiral who was often humorous and all of the characters were likable and realistic.  Even some of the mean characters became likable later.  I believe this show has something for everyone since it not only covers Navy and Marine life, but other stories from the civilian world and in the lives of the characters.

Now I'm glad I didn't watch it when it aired on the network because I would have hated waiting months to find out what happens since many seasons ended with a cliffhanger that continued the next season.  At least I could watch it all at once without the wait and without the commercials.  I have about three discs left from the final season and I'm trying to drag it out because I don't want it to end.",1523491200,4,1824,4.302052785923753

6992078,5,B00STKR50Q,"Excellent first few seasons and then it became good until last two seasons 9 & 10. I actually stopped watching during season 10, it became a soap around season 8/9, perhaps different writer or director, less professional in content.

6992081,5,B00STKR50Q,"The series of J.A.G. was an exceptional show that I think would be hard to replace even in today's time. The crew (Actors/Actresses) of the show and those behind the camera made such an interesting and high caliber series that when watching it on DVD, was like watching it all over again for the first time without commercials.
  I would highly recommend this collection to anyone who has or may have an interest in a series that can capture your attention.
  I am glad too have this complete series and will watch it again.

6992109,4,B00STKR50Q,"JAG, short for Judge Advocate General, the Navy's judicial arm. The series is great -- it has to be to go for ten seasons, but Donald Bellisario, the show's creator and producer sadly was one of the ones that gave TV a bad name in the 80s and 90s. Happily, many of JAG's flaws are buried by hasty and sloppy background video (provided by the Navy). Videos of jet aircraft are reversed in some scenes and the numbers on their sides change. Ships also are misidentified. In one episode, an opening shot shows a video of the USS ARLEIGH BURKE (DDG-51) and identifies it as the USS THOMAS LYONS (no such ship). They also use the aircraft carriers ENTERPRISE (CV-65) and FORRESTAL (CV-59) for the fictional SEAHAWK. The problem is, the background video they use has both hull numbers! Seeing that the Navy is a big part of the audience, these are obvious missteps, but Bellisario doesn't really care as he's convinced his audience is a bunch of morons.

All in all, if you overlook the sloppy editing and crooked storylines that occasionally get in, the show's highly entertaining.

Go ahead, if you haven't seen the series, you'll most likely love it. It really is a winner.",1510444800,,1170,4.647342995169082

Didn't watch it when it was on TV, but this is a good series.  In my opinion, much, much better than NCIS and far more realistic.  The episodes cover a wide variety of topics and , use a lot of military equipment (particularly F-15s), .

The down side is the technology used to make the DVDs. It seems more like something out of the 1980s. I own a lot of DVDs and these are by far the most clunky, I have ever experienced. I watch mostly on a laptop. All the others pick back up where I left off when I close the lid. These DVDs reset back to the beginning. And you had better remember where you left off. For the technology of the DVDs, I give them ONE STAR.

As the series moves forward the characters change and grow both professionally and personally.  We liked seeing some characters return in different parts of the series to make the story line come together.  The price was reasonable and this brought us several weeks of entertainment when we can't get TV on the antenna.  We also enjoy taking series on camping trips into the mountains where we have not TV reception and they are great to watch to relax in the evenings. JAG has the right mix of adventure, excitement and great characters to make it one of our favorites.",1492819200,4,779,4.7481481481481485

I did have one complaint but didn't knock the rating down because of it.  It wasn't the fault of Amazon.  This stores very well compared to having all the seasons in different packages it takes up about half the room.  Discs easily can be removed and put back in.

My package came missing one DVD, having two copies of the neighboring disc.  Customer service was chaotic.  I contacted Amazon having bought it here.  They were very nice in my treatment of this issue.  However they wanted me to send back the entire set and ship off another one.  I feared the same problem would happen in that.  In contacted the companies (CBS and Paramount) on the package I had chaos.  Both said to ship it back to my seller (Amazon).  One of them hadn't a clue and needed to forward it to a higher up before responding to me.  In digging on the internet, I found a third contact at the company.  They were happy to resolve my problem and just asked for photos of the package (UPS/lot code) and purchase proof...

6992248,5,B00STKR50Q,I love watching reruns of JAG at night before I go to sleep. I am drawn to the relationships of the JAG family and the members of the team particularly Harm and Mac. But it comes on so late here that I just had to think of another way. So this was my solution and it works. Now I can get my sleep and binge watch as much as I want. Love it.,1455580800,8,340,3.671232876712329

6992262,5,B00STKR50Q,"We are enjoying this series a whole lot.  After the first season which was sort of dorky we have been really liking  seeing this series once more.  Being retirees, we purchase and watch numerous video series, typically two or three episodes on a long evening by the fire.  The Admiral is just my kind of guy.  Great character acting.  This is a good addition to our collection.",1449273600,3,377,4.552238805970149

6992273,4,B00STKR50Q,Only four stars only because we have not watched the entire set yet. We were fans of the JAG series. We have only watched into season eight so far. This has renewed our being fans. More special features would have been nice. All disk so far have been good with no bad disks. I like the packaging. This takes much less shelf space.,1440115200,4,330,4.253968253968254
6992274,5,B00STKR50Q,Another great Bellasarius project (along with NCIS).  Good tight writing.,1439769600,2,73,6.3

6992277,5,B00STKR50Q,"Many years ago, when JAG was on Thursday evenings, I would not answer the phone until the show was over, it was that good and deserved my full attention. Of course, being a career navyman, it was my kind of atmosphere. How good was this show? Well, I just bought the complete series and am enjoying each episode as much as in years past. A wonderful part for anyone's movie DVD collection.",1438646400,42,389,4.416666666666667

6992279,5,B00STKR50Q,"The compact shelf-top box contains 2 large plastic cases (seasons 1-4, 5-8) and one half size case (seasons 9-10). Plastic sleeves secure a DVD to the front and another offset on the back.

The DVDs arrived pristine and played perfectly. Each disc lists the titles of its episodes. The 3rd season discs in each case have a colorful photo on the front.

David Bellisario provides a commentary on the background and filming of the series. The gag reels are rather short. Catherine Bell gives some thoughts on the first episode that she appeared in. Without the commercials, the stories really flow smoothly. I watched part of the original series and caught many missed episodes on reruns. But there are multi-episode back stories going on along with the individual story lines. So this is a great buy for a fan.",1438646400,62,809,4.81294964028777
