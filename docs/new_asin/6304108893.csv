It was a real good example of the early days for the settlers. Lee Horsley & Lynda Carter were really good in their parts they played. I recommend this series to everyone it is really good,I have watched it twice already & I just got it last week.",1327363200,,445,4.309523809523809
8213264,5,6304108893,"Although the Hawkeye series only aired for one season in syndication, I felt that it brought to life a very interesting period in American history.  In this episode, Elizabeth (Lynda) and Hawkeye (Lee Horsley) infiltrate a French camp in order to stop them from using a ""secret weapon"" against British troops.  As Elizabeth, Lynda once again gets to play a heroic role (but must rely on her smarts rather than the powers of a superheroine).
I highly recommend this video, along with the other episodes of the Hawkeye series.  This show was created by Stephen J. Cannell whose name is synonymous with top-notch programming.  Buy it today!!",1088640000,4,638,4.934579439252336
