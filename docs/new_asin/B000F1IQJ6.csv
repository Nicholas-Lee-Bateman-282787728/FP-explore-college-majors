2548038,2,B000F1IQJ6,"Well there's a lot T&A... and the interviews are okay but the annoying aspect of this DVD is it's just the producers fighting & worrying over how the show will be percieved (and then later panned initially) and it never shows you any worthwhile clips of the actual Zumanity long enough. Not even one act! I watched itonce, and haven't had the urge since.",1151798400,3,354,4.546875
2548039,1,B000F1IQJ6,"I am a a huge Cirque fan.  I have all their DVD's release shows and have seing many of them in person. WHAT AN EXPERIENCE. However, one of the show I am looking forward to see is Zumannity.  I purchased the Cirque Du Soleil - Lovesick and that a disapointment it was. I was, sick.  The DVD is a pre, pre, preshow of the making of, of the making of a show.  I hope the show in NY NY, LAs Vegas is completely a different story.  I booked my vacation to las Vegas for September 2006 and I off course to see the show.  I will let you know them.  Don't spent the money on the DVD and safe up for a trip.

2548040,1,B000F1IQJ6,"I have all the Cirque du Soleil DVD's.

This is the first Cirque du Soleil DVD that disappointed me.  I mailed a letter expressing my disappointment to Cirque du Soleil's headquarters in Montreal.

Wait for the Zumanity DVD to come out.  This DVD chronicles only a handful of the performers.  Joey the drag queen emcee from NYC, the British ballet dancer (she was too boring to remember her name), a strong man from Miami and two other lackluster women.  The strongman's best attributes are his muscles and girlfriend.

As long as they are not hurting anyone, I do not care about the people behind the scenes.

Zumanity is a great, controversial show.  This DVD does not do justice to Zumanity.  It provides just a blink of an eye view of Zumanity through a keyhole.

The material on this DVD is more suited as ""Bonus Features"" on the real Zumanity DVD.

Cirque du Soleil never offered a DVD like this before.  What inane logic made them release this DVD?  With any luck, they will never release another DVD like this again.",1149897600,24,1024,4.616666666666666
2548041,3,B000F1IQJ6,"It was just OK.  I was hoping it would be longer and have more added bonus features.  I also hoped it would show more clips of the Las Vegas show Zumanity.  When it was over I thought, ""That was it?""

I am a huge Cirque Du Soleil fan and I have most of their DVD's and many CD's.  This is by far one of the worst ones I own.  If you want to buy any Zumanity material, I recommend the music CD.",1149638400,4,393,3.731707317073171
2548042,5,B000F1IQJ6,"this is a great ""making-of"" video for zumanity - if you are a cirque fan it is an absolute must have bc of the behind the scenes look into the performer's preparations as well as their personal lives. Highly recommend for someone who is not as familiar with cirque as well as it shows you that these are not just circus performers but extremely talented individuals who are as captivating off stage as they are on.",1146528000,5,414,4.4605263157894735
2548043,1,B000F1IQJ6,"A disorganized mess, no story, nothing to do with Cirque except costumes once in awhile.  I do not recommend it.",1364169600,,112,4.6
2548044,1,B000F1IQJ6,Don't bother. This sucks. It's only a documentary without much to look at at all. Go see the real thing,1361318400,,103,4.2
2548045,3,B000F1IQJ6,"WOW!!!!  Cirque du Soleil went adult only!!  It took me on a journey I would have never gone alone!  I sensed from the preview it was risqu, but......  Oh my, oh my!  Now I must hide ""Love Sick"" in the family room.  I can appreciate the courage of the directors, artist in bolding stepping out of the traditional box.  Of course, Cirque du Soleil is not traditional in any sense.  Your gifts of imagination and interpretation have always been amazing, beautiful, thrilling, motivational, funny and dramatic to name a few!  I love you Cirque du Soleil and will always remain your fan!",1247443200,6,583,4.637254901960785
2548046,5,B000F1IQJ6,"It's true that Love is Sick. I bought this DVD knowing it was a documentary INSPIRED by Zumanity and not about the other Cirque DVD's. I thought it was brilliant in it's back stage real life drama from creation to it's performers. I liked knowing little things like the fact that Joey the Emcee was asked not to use the F-word so much yet it's used all the time by so many of the comedians at most adult shows in Vegas and in the real NYC. I also liked the fact that not everyone knew what to expect from the creators from the beginning. I'm glad it went behind the scenes of one of the most controversial Vegas shows to remind us it's hard f-in work.

The show now has changed from what you see in the film. Joey and a few others are no longer under contract now so it's premise has taken a much milder tone, but is still for adults. I mean there are no men kissing each other (too bad) so the gay theme is mild to the extent they do have a new drag Emcee and she is not as vibrant as Joey. There is t&a but it's without controversy.

So anyway, buy the F-in DVD! Meanwhile, the show F-in needs to take a few steps forward and push itself closer to the edge... again.",1202774400,3,1168,4.073913043478261
2548047,4,B000F1IQJ6,"I thoroughly enjoyed this backstage tour, so to speak, however it left me wanting to see more of the show. I guess they want you to buy tickets! There were too many repeat shots, however, the edting made for an intersting programme. If you saw Fire Within, the making of Varekai you;ll enjoy this.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cirque-du-Soleil-Fire-Within-Varekai/dp/B0002XVRNE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cirque du Soleil - Fire Within / Varekai</a>",1175040000,7,489,6.65625
2548048,2,B000F1IQJ6,"One can't judge this documentary against the merits or lack thereof of the Vegas Cirque de Soleil show, but it is fair to require that this expensive documentary do more than simply present a MTV montage of images to reflect the ""real story behind the story"" of the making of the show.  The shots inside the cars are dull and look like HBO's Confessions to a Taxicab Driver. The actual footage of rehearsals and presentation of the show are done with thousands of one second montaged shots that makes viewing this as anything but erotic or tense or dramatic.  This type of topic deserved a much better movie.  There really is no drama to its telling of the story, and there is nothing compelling or interesting in the way the movie follows the lives of the ones involved - especially disappointing since although the transvestite is the one most followed and examined, there appears to be far better stories involving the Catholic ballerina and the woman whose fiance is in Canada.  Dull, and confusing.",1173052800,6,1003,4.747126436781609
2548049,4,B000F1IQJ6,"As a dancer,I think this film may appeal mainly to those who are dancers/performers themselves, or those who have already seen Zumanity.  Lots of backstage intrigue and enough scenes of the show itself to be titillating and encourage you to hop a plane to Vegas. Touching and often very funny as well- not an artistic triumph, but it more than held my interest. Wish they had more footage of Wassa and a little less of Miss Jonel's whip! The performers are absolutely spectacular and deserve full marks for their courage in doing what they do in Zumanity: present a vision of sexuality that is more...well,.. HUMAN, than the other banal, cliched and cartoonlike erotic shows in Vegas, or anywhere else for that matter. Spymonkey rules!!!",1168473600,9,737,4.896
2548050,1,B000F1IQJ6,"I must say that this DVD seriously disappointed me.  I absolutely hated it.  I heard that Zumanity was a more ""adult"" show.  I figured that maybe the costumes would have a little less fabric, and that the show would be more sexual than other shows.  But I figured that it was the Cirque, even if the above were true, at least it would be done tastefully.  I NEVER expected to see what I saw.  I was so extremely disappointed.  Not just with the DVD, but also with Cirque.

This DVD is the behind the scenes beginning of the show.  But I still saw more T&A than I expected to see.  (And the actors were told that they were playing it too sae and needed to show more.)  And it was not done tastefully.  I truely think that a strip joint would have more class than this show does.  I'm not one that is easily offended, but I couldn't even finish watching the dvd.  It was absolutely terrible.  I'm tempted to send it through the cd shredder.

I'm just glad I bought the video before wasting money on a trip to see the show.",1164758400,3,1020,4.2072538860103625
2548051,4,B000F1IQJ6,"It is amazing how many people get locked into a narrow view of what 'Cirque' is 'supposed' to be. Lovesick is a great documentary showing the trials and tribulations that take place before the whimsical world of Cirque becomes just that for the audience. I'm glad they chose not to show the actual performance. This DVD is not the show, and never should be classified as such. A must for anyone interested in the darker nature of pre-production.",1153785600,23,445,4.717948717948718

8116364,4,B000F1IQJ6,"I saw ""Zumanity"" in Las Vegas in 2011 and it was the best show I've ever seen in my life! I have never forgotten it and its performers. Amazing doesn't even begin to describe the show. I picked up the DVD ""Lovesick"" for a whopping three bucks at Big Lots and was hoping it would recreate my viewing experience of the actual ""Zumanity"" show. It was interesting and showcased the behind-the-scenes drama the performers go through, but I didn't recognize most of them. Joey, the drag queen emcee, has since been replaced by another drag performer called Edie. I would have liked to have seen more clips of the performances I remember, such as the two Asian women swimming in the big water bowl, the hula hoop lady named Julia Kolosova, and the two fat redheaded ladies with the strawberries tray. I did enjoy the documentary, but I'm glad I didn't pay more than three dollars for it.",1374451200,3,880,4.575949367088608
