3140180,1,B00153ZL3M,"This is really a bad program,it got worse with each succeeding episode and I have
consigned it to my pile of DVDs that will never be played again. The stories seemed
like they were written by grade school students with no knowledge of the subject
matter and no hope of ever improving. This is the worst series I have ever seen
from the usual excellent BBC.",1265068800,5,356,4.409090909090909
3140181,5,B00153ZL3M,"Bonekickers  is a modern day British drama series about a team of archaeologists. Bonekickers is from the creator of Life on Mars  and Ashes to Ashes. It stars Julie Graham, Hugh Bonneville, Adrian Lester, and Gugu Mbatha-Raw.

The series is sort of a combination of the British sci-fi series, Torchwood, and the American crime drama, CSI. It's set in the city of Bath in England and combines modern forensic science (like CSI) with mysteries from the past and has a touch of sci-fi in it as well.

Bonekickers ran for one series in 2008 and was not renewed for a second series. There were a total of six episodes, all of which are contained in this three-DVD package. DVD special features include behind-the-scenes segments for each episode.

Dr. Gillian Magwilde (Julie Graham) is the leader of the archaeology team. Professor Gregory ""Dolly"" Parton and Dr. Ben Ergha (Adrian Lester) work on the team with her and Vivian Davis (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) is an intern. Each episode is capable of standing on its own although you'll get a better feeling for the characters as a whole if you watch the entire season.

The archaeological finds that are unearthed are always a bit of a mystery. They don't tend to be found where they're supposed to be and that's part of the interest in the series. For example, the first episode is about a blood-stained piece of wood believed to be from the cross that Jesus was crucified on. It was found in a cave in England and nicely meshes with the legend of the Knights Templar.

The starting point of some of their archaeological finds is probably not historically accurate. It's questionable whether or not a piece of bloodstained cross would actually be found in Bath or whether or not 18th-century manacled slaves would be found in a ship off the coast of England. The mystery behind the location of the artifacts is part of the draw of the stories.

There are flashbacks in history throughout each episode that add a bit more mystery to the investigations. Dr. Gillian Magwilde (Julie Graham) has occasional psychic flashbacks as well that give the series a bit of a sci-fi twist.

Given the subject matter of historic battles and mysteries, there is some violence in the series although it's very well done and not overly graphic. Professor Gregory ""Dolly"" Parton (Hugh Bonneville) has a tendency to make comments with sexual connotations which portray him as a slightly dirty old man and there is the very occasional shot containing partial nudity.

All in all, the series is highly entertaining and historically interesting. It's an enjoyable blend of history, science, and drama with just enough action to keep your attention. Given the very occasional nudity, I'm not sure I'd recommend it for younger children but the series would easily appeal to the PG-13 market. The series is not rated at the time of my review but does contain the warning ""Contains violence and graphic scenes"" so use your own best judgment.",1263340800,40,2953,4.841269841269841
3140182,5,B00153ZL3M,"BONE-TICKLING GOOD if viewed as entertainment for ADULTS not concerned with complete factual information. It has a bit of fantasy, a lot of action (violence & graphic), and suspense aplenty. Not being an archaeologist nor a European history expert, the plots of the episodes were convincing enough to carry the story. This short-lived 6-episode series ""BONEKICKERS"" is acted well enough to make it a worthwhile DVD keeper. Scenes from contemporary Bath, England, are visually romantic.

The Wessex Univ Archaeological Dept. team has a major relic to uncover and then to discover the current-day ramifications of the artifact. Both the past and the present is a mystery every time, much to the delight of the mystery-loving viewer. A linking thread is a continuing plot relating to Gillian's mother, Karen, obsessed to madness over her sword quest and journal, of which has been absorbed into the life of Gilly, aka Dr. Magwilde, protagonist of the series played by Julie Graham (beautifully so). Prof. Gregory Parton (Hugh Bonneville) has plenty of funny dialogue about Gilly's chest, and not a chest found buried in the ground. Dr. Ben Ergha (Adrian Lester) a young black archaeologist of the department makes up the university staff. Well, except for the less-than-competent dept. head Daniel Mastiff (Michael Maloney). A very young black intern, Viv (Gugu Mbatha-Raw), arrives on the scene. She's unwelcome by Gilly, due to Viv's inexperience or beauty or anyone's guess. Quite soon into the episodes, they all feel like family to the viewer.

The writer actually suggests an ""Indiana Jones"" comparison, but this is better in the way historical and contemporary worlds merge. There's enough Gothic, war, Celtic, and Medieval violence to keep the young kids away. In the end, a connection to all of the episodes becomes evident, with a clashing conclusion. Remember it is as fictional as The Da Vinci Code, regardless of what was written in that book's opening page.  But it's convincing enough, only the experts will notice the difference. Me? No! I simply enjoyed it all. Every episode has a ""dig"", each a chamber. Entertaining DVD to ""DIG INTO.""

YES, distributor Acorn Media has provided SUBTITLES.
Original TV airing was in 2008.
To much bonus to list, but you have the chance to select behind the scenes footage and interviews for selected phases of production with every episode. Quite interesting ""making-of"" stuff.

Episodes:
1 Army of God: A battle including Knights Templar. Were they carrying a precious cargo? A Christian relic? Includes a graphic broadsword beheading (not for children). Crusades come to 21st Century. A favorite line: ""For the love of Jehovah, may we go to the pub?""
2 Warriors: Bones are recovered on a beach, bodies with no hands. Shackles also are found suggesting slaves.  It's only the beginning of a complex mystery encompassing 2 centuries, multiple continents.
3 The Eternal Fire: Celtic 1st century relics are found under baths in the city, Bath. Celtic fires appear related to Roman fires as well as the lives of the 2 civilizations. Archaeologist science meets imagination.
4 The Cradle of Civilisation (spelling is correct): Babylonian artifacts appear for sale on the black market in Bath. Gillian's Iraqi ex-lover is looking to recover a tablet with prophecy (Babylonia's 10 commandments). Gillian wants to help.
5 The Lines of War: WWI tank is found in France with 6 body remains. But why also is there Joan of Arc clues? Much more than expected is discovered here.
6 Follow the Gleam: Gillian & Viv work on a new relationship. An Arthurian discovery (the Round Table?) is made in an area known as Camelot. Is it finally a break in Dr. Magwilde's quest for Excalibur? Archaeology turns vicious. Will Gilly end like her mother?

Good BBC drama presented in a unique form. My recommendation: ""Let's dig!""
Tennyson recommendation: ""The quest is everything.""",1261008000,21,3903,5.117739403453689

Could have been interesting  if it hadn't immediately gone into the politically correct muslim defense and ""attack christians as much as possible"" bent",1524096000,4,430,5.484848484848484
3140230,3,B00153ZL3M,"What this is NOT- it is NOT a female Indiana Jones type show. It is not similar to Bones or any of the other shows you see on the slipcover (CSI, Dr Who etc).

Even with all it is NOT, I thought it sounded interesting and despite some of the terrible reviews, I thought I'd give it a try. Sadly, it has earned the poor ratings.
 I give it 3 stars because it had some interesting ideas about various mysteries from history. I like history and I like mysteries so that is good.  It is easy to watch while your doing something else. I also liked it much better after the first two shows since it stopped pushing the anti Christian, political opinions as much as it did in the first two. It's clean without a lot of swearing, very little blood, and your children could probably watch it and enjoy it.  It could have been great with more likable characters and better acting from the secondary actors and a little bit more believable archeology scenes. I'd love to see this redone only better and without the politics.

If you want to ruin what is an interesting premise you take the bad acting, wild theories, poor archeology scenes, this show has and then toss in some anti American weird comments and political judgement (Oh Great, he's a Republican and we have to work with him!) and coat that all with a lot of anti Christian comments (Oh surely, your educated enough to not believe that crap)

Essentially this show is about a team of archaeologists who are freelancers (?) Yet who work for a university (?) and the rest of the show is just as confusing.
The characters are fairly predictable. There is a strong female lead, Dr. Gillian Madwilde, with a bit of a mystery around her. I think had she been more likable I would have enjoyed the show a whole lot more. But she's judgmental, quick to anger, suspicious of everyone around her except for when she should be suspicious, then she's very trusting. She's harsh and fights a lot with an old flame who is also on the team. She is also a dreamer and willing to believe all sorts of wild theories with no proof or facts to back her up. The old flame is a tactful man who tries to keep Dr. Gillian on the straight and narrow. There is a younger intern who believes everything and apparently has to have everything explained to her. She is wide eyed and excited about everything and an older man who is all about the sexual innuendos etc.
Surrounding these four man characters are a series of bad actors that couldn't keep things moving along. I think the script had a lot to do with it.

And the worst part is-  in each episode, almost every scene that had archeology involved- I found myself rolling my eyes. I'm not an archaeologist but I could do a better job than they did. In one scene, for example, they deliberately break a jar from antiquity that has liquid in it, just to see what is in the jar. Who does that?

In each episode the investigate something that is so amazing it can't be believed. They discover the Cross of Christ, The Hanging Gardens of Babylon etc etc. And in each episode something happens so that they have no proof of their discovery. The Cross burns up, the grave gets flooded etc.
Over arching this is some mystery about Dr. Gillian's mother. I would have enjoyed the show a lot more if I had understood the mystery straight up from the start. By the fourth or fifth show I was still trying to figure out what exactly is this mystery and flat out didn't care by the end of the shows.

So there it is, It's likable and enjoyable at times yet at the same time it drags on.  It has some great actors and poor acting. It has some interesting premises and yet it gets stupid at times. Overall the show can't quiet make it all work together in one great show but it should have been a fun historical show.",1524096000,,3782,4.365576102418208

3140232,1,B00153ZL3M,"lol....read some reviews and some said this made them like history that much more? Genealogy and history go together like bread and butter, can't have one without the other. But to believe this show.....if you could even call it that encouraged historical interest failed history in school!

The message throughout this absurd piece of kaka is more about Christianity being the evil bane of all the world's woes that persecutes islam. The attacks on those who admit to even having a faith, so violates everything that falls under human rights. Who is it, the writers, the person who who pitched this crap to producers that hate anything remotely faith based. Even the actors and actresses who signed up for this must have been desperate for a paycheck. The powers that be should have done some 'real' research into the subject of Christianity, Catholicism, Templars, and archeaology before filming. I think if they had cut out the bad attitude towards Christianity this show might have been okay.

3140233,1,B00153ZL3M,"This show is awful!  I gave it a fair shot, but it was so over the top that I just couldn't stomach it anymore.  The first episode's attempt at portraying Christianity and Islam both in the 12th century and in the present day missed the mark completely.  It was a desperate rewrite of the past, and and equally desperate rewrite of present day.  The dialogue was forced and the scenarios were based almost exclusively on heavy-handed stereotypes and worn out clichs.  If you like shameless pandering, overacting, and  social indoctrination by the entertainment world,  you'll love this show.  However, if you are just looking for some good, quality entertainment, you probably ought to give Bonekickers a miss.",1523836800,2,710,5.0085470085470085

3140259,4,B00153ZL3M,"I complained so loudly about historical balderdash in the 1st episode that I surprised even myself by watching the 2nd. It was better, and by the 6th episode, my feelings about ""Bonekickers"" had considerably improved. I love history and I love mysteries, and the Bonekickers' premise, combining the two, is a winner. It turned out to be an OK series. I liked the ""Behind the Scenes"" Bonus Extras, too.

In England, when construction or farming turns up an ancient artifact, business stops while the archaeologists are called in to check things out. The Bonekicker team, out of the fictional Wessex University, loves going out in the field to investigate. They usually end up with more excitement than they bargained for. Gillian Magwilde, team leader, also has a personal quest which she pursues throughout the series. She is continuing her mother's search for an ancient artifact; a search that cost her mother her professional reputation and sanity.

""Bonekickers"" originally aired in 2008 in 6 episodes. The BBC was prepared to commission a 2nd series, but the writers/producers, discouraged by unkind critical reception and low viewer ratings, decided to pursue their interests elsewhere. They probably couldn't  afford to get Hugh Bonneville back, anyway, now that he's a star as Lord Crawley on ""Downton Abbey"".

In the 3 DVD or 2 BluRay disc set, you get 344 minutes of viewing, plus the special features. Viewing aspect is 16:9 widescreen and sound is Dolby digital stereo. English subtitles are available for all episodes. Each episode has it's own ""Behind the Scenes"" special features.

Episode 1. ""Army of God"". A construction crew turns up a 14th century Middle Eastern coin. How did a coin issued by a Sultan turn up in Somerset? The Bonekickers are called in and unearth several bodies hacked to pieces. Research turns up that Knights Templar were secretly escorting a Christian relic to England in 1307, trying to protect it and themselves, since Templars were on the run after their disgrace. The Sultan's warriors followed them to Bath and destroyed them. But what if the Sultan didn't get the relic? And what if there are still Templars today - ""When the call comes, I will be ready.""
This episode is fun and over-the-top, including a psychotic televangelist, but I was really annoyed by the ridiculousness of its basic premise. It's unlikely a Sultan would have cared about a Christian relic. And though the Templars were on the run after Friday the 13th, October, 1307, their hunters were Catholics, particularly Philip IV of France, who owed the Templars a lot of money and didn't want to pay it back.
Damascene is not the same as Damascus Steel.  Usually, you wouldn't say ""damascene steel"", because damascene means ""gold laid over steel"".
....Behind the Scenes (27 minutes total): Covers the idea of the show itself, the script, visual effects, shooting, editing, production design and the edit for live cut. The commentators focus on the scene in the cavern under the dovecote. It is very interesting to see what was actually shot in a freezing aircraft hangar, and then how the special effects, compositors, matte painters and editors turn it into the scene we watch on TV. Fascinating, including David Early (digital matte painter) explaining that the last thing they do is add ""traditional film grain. Things tend to not look real unless there's old-fashioned film grain in."" It's what our eyes expect.

Episode 2. ""Warriors"". Back in the late 1700's, English ships took metal and trinkets to Africa, picked up slaves, took the slaves to the Caribbean and America, and returned home with sugar and cotton. Slavery was legal in English colonies, but not in England proper. So why, when the Bonekickers excavate in the mud of the Bristol Channel, do they find slave shackles with severed hands?
A very interesting (and hypothetical) story.
....Behind the Scenes (15 minutes total): Covers the script, shooting and audio mix. It's interesting the kind of decisions they have to make on the sounds in any scene.

Episode 3. ""The Eternal Fire"". The first earthquake in 300 years hits Bath on Valentine's Day. Gas is escaping from previously unknown caverns beneath the famed Roman Bath and the historical site is shut down. But not before the Bonekickers sneak their way in.
Another interesting story, expounding on a historical what-if, this time involving the Iceni queen Boudica.
....Behind the Scenes (11 minutes total): Covers the script, shooting, audio mix and colour grade (British spelling). In the latter, it's amazing that they have to shoot on location at all. The colourist makes a scene shot in the afternoon look like it happened at night, highlights one person's face to make her stand out and make a table appear to glow when it is merely white.

Episode 4. ""The Cradle of Civilisation"" (British spelling) This episode moves from Babylon 331 BCE to modern day Iraq, 50 miles south of Baghdad. It's a war zone. A man trying to escape gunfire falls down decrepit steps. He finds skeletons, an amulet and a box with an ancient cuneiform-covered vessel.
""I've got an Etruscan spear in my hand and I'm not afraid to use it!""
....Behind the Scenes (21 minutes total): Covers the script, shooting, costumes, foley and visual effects. Foley refers to the physical sounds that actors and animals make. It's like the men in the background making the horse clopping noises for a radio show, except it's much more involved. I got a kick out of the sound machinations for the animated snake. In reality, you probably wouldn't hear a snake moving over a carpet. But for the TV show, it adds zing to make a sound for that.

Episode 5. ""The Lines of War"". In a field outside Verdun, the French have uncovered a buried WWI Mark 1 tank, The French call in the Bonekickers as a courtesy, because the Mark I was British, the first tanks ever fielded. Why is the undamaged tank deliberately buried? And why does one of the WWI soldier bodies inside it have a tattoo of the Cross of Lorraine, the sign of Joan of Arc?
This is a cool episode and I enjoyed the story arc and it's conspiracy theory background. However, I have to nitpick: Joan of Arc was the Maid of Orlans, not the Maid of Lorraine.  She had a coat of arms, but it had no cross on it. The Cross of Lorraine is sometimes called the Crusaders Cross, because it was used by the Knights Templar in their beginning, before switching to the Maltese cross, But I don't think there is a connection to Joan of Arc.
....Behind the Scenes (18 minutes total): Covers the script, shooting and music. I got a kick out of listening to Dee Gregson, location manager: ""We needed to find a WWI tank to build the interior of. This is the only Mark 1 tank in existence."" And they found it at the Bovington Tank Museum in Dorset. Even better, they were able to film inside the tank in the museum. So look around the tank interior scenes - it's the real thing.

Episode 6. ""Follow the Gleam"", The Bonekickers travel to Glastonbury, where another archaeology team is searching for ""the ultimate"" Arthurian artifact. But Gillian thinks they've missed an important clue, and is not put off when a mysterious group called the Disciples of Good Use warns her off. The warning works on Gregory Parton, her co-worker, who tells Gillian, ""If they're behind this, you've lost.""
....Behind the Scenes (19 minutes total): Covers the script, shooting and audio mix. As you watch this episode, try to pick out where they used a Barbie Doll as a stunt double.

An enjoyable series, though the historical ""facts"" are sometimes hard to swallow. At a reduced price, it's a lot of viewing for not a lot of bucks.

I love most British shows because they're (usually) well done and far more imaginative than many of our own here in the US. (The fact that we remake tons of British shows just bears that point out.)

My only real problem with Bonekickers, so far, has been the so very obvious use of the show for political support. Warriors, Episode 2, is, partially, about the first black man running for President, and even uses the same political catch-phrase as our current president. They even go so far as to make a derogatory remark about Republicans. I don't care who you voted for, I just don't like it when a show does this, especially a non-US show.

3140282,5,B00153ZL3M,"BONE-TICKLING GOOD if viewed as entertainment for ADULTS not concerned with complete factual information. It has a bit of fantasy, a lot of action (violence & graphic), and suspense aplenty. Not being an archaeologist nor a European history expert, the plots of the episodes were convincing enough to carry the story. This short-lived 6-episode series ""BONEKICKERS"" is acted well enough to make it a worthwhile DVD keeper. Scenes from contemporary Bath, England, are visually romantic.

The Wessex Univ Archaeological Dept. team has a major relic to uncover and then to discover the current-day ramifications of the artifact. Both the past and the present is a mystery every time, much to the delight of the mystery-loving viewer. A linking thread is a continuing plot relating to Gillian's mother, Karen, obsessed to madness over her sword quest and journal, of which has been absorbed into the life of Gilly, aka Dr. Magwilde, protagonist of the series played by Julie Graham (beautifully so, just like in ""William and Mary""). Prof. Gregory Parton (Hugh Bonneville-excellent in 'Downton Abbey') has plenty of funny dialogue about Gilly's chest, and not a chest found buried in the ground. Dr. Ben Ergha (Adrian Lester) a young black archaeologist of the department makes up the university staff. Well, except for the less-than-competent dept. head Daniel Mastiff (Michael Maloney-'The Young Victoria'). A very young black intern, Viv (Gugu Mbatha-Raw--from 'Larry Crowne', see my review), arrives on the scene. She's unwelcome by Gilly, due to Viv's inexperience or beauty or anyone's guess. Quite soon into the episodes, they all feel like family to the viewer.

The writer actually suggests an ""Indiana Jones"" comparison, but this is better in the way historical and contemporary worlds merge. There's enough Gothic, war, Celtic, and Medieval violence to keep the young kids away. In the end, a connection to all of the episodes becomes evident, with a clashing conclusion. Remember it is as fictional as The Da Vinci Code, regardless of what was written in that book's opening page. But it's convincing enough, only the experts will notice the difference. Me? No! I simply enjoyed it all. Every episode has a ""dig"", each a chamber. Entertaining DVD to ""DIG INTO.""

YES, distributor Acorn Media has provided SUBTITLES.
Original TV airing was in 2008.
To much bonus to list, but you have the chance to select behind the scenes footage and interviews for selected phases of production with every episode. Quite interesting ""making-of"" stuff.

Episodes:
1 Army of God: A battle including Knights Templar. Were they carrying a precious cargo? A Christian relic? Includes a graphic broadsword beheading (not for children). Crusades come to 21st Century. A favorite line: ""For the love of Jehovah, may we go to the pub?""
2 Warriors: Bones are recovered on a beach, bodies with no hands. Shackles also are found suggesting slaves. It's only the beginning of a complex mystery encompassing 2 centuries, multiple continents.
3 The Eternal Fire: Celtic 1st century relics are found under baths in the city, Bath. Celtic fires appear related to Roman fires as well as the lives of the 2 civilizations. Archaeologist science meets imagination.
4 The Cradle of Civilization (spelling is correct): Babylonian artifacts appear for sale on the black market in Bath. Gillian's Iraqi ex-lover is looking to recover a tablet with prophecy (Babylonia's 10 commandments). Gillian wants to help.
5 The Lines of War: WWI tank is found in France with 6 body remains. But why also is there Joan of Arc clues? Much more than expected is discovered here.
6 Follow the Gleam: Gillian & Viv work on a new relationship. An Arthurian discovery (the Round Table?) is made in an area known as Camelot. Is it finally a break in Dr. Magwilde's quest for Excalibur? Archaeology turns vicious. Will Gilly end like her mother?

Good BBC drama presented in a unique form. My recommendation: ""Let's dig!""

3140283,3,B00153ZL3M,"Bonekickers is not the best of British television, but it is not farther out there than the latest Zombie or Vampire movie in which people swallow one idiocy after another whole and enjoy it. The fatal flaw in this series (one that you often find in sci-fi or crime series) is the writer's tendency to descend into melodrama and soap opera - the original Star Trek is a case in point. This is a shame because the premise was an interesting one - archaeologists trying to piece together the past - there is inherent mystery in that. The writers tried to add in too much crazy stuff and you wonder at times what they were smoking at two in the morning with some of their 'brilliant' ideas, (they are also doing this with the latest Agatha Christie remakes). Less is often better than more. However, I liked the mix of cast and Hugh Bonneville was an excellent character who would have been even better as the lead. The one character should have ended up as the daughter and not the 'sister'. And I bet if the series had devoted itself to serious mystery writing, it would have been a hit.",1313020800,2,1086,4.435
3140284,3,B00153ZL3M,"Bonekickers (2008) is a short-lived BBC television series about a team of archeologists from a fictional university in England, that become involved in the investigation of a number of high profile cases.  The adventures attempt to incorporate historically significant elements, often with a connection to religion, into stories that supposedly have world changing relevance today.  In this, the series strives to emulate The Da Vinci Code, which is little tough to do once, let alone multiple times.  Quite unbelievably, the archeologists are repeatedly underground in some long hidden cavern, making some great discovery.

The team from Wessex University is led by Dr. Gillian Magwilde (Julie Graham), and includes Ben Ergha (Adrian Lester), Gregory Parton (Hugh Bonneville), and intern Viv Davis (Gugu Mbatha-Raw).  Magwilde comes across as tough, confident, and confrontational.  The very even tempered Ben, was romantically involved with Gillian in college, and is probably the one she counts on most.  Mastiff is a colorful figure, with a distinctive choice of dress.  He's brilliant, but occasionally prone to dramatics and inappropriate language.  These three know each other well, and the Viv is the newcomer who tries to fit in.  The group functions fairly well, but under Magwilde's leadership, they just don't seem to jell.  Magwilde seems to have issues getting along with everyone, and is also dealing with her sick mother, who was also a famous archeologist.  Ben and Viv are the most normal, and seem the most likeable, but this is probably not a group that most will fall in love with.  There is a story arc, involving a secret relationship, that while obviously important to the writers, just doesn't seem necessary.

While the series Relic Hunter (1999-2002) tried to apply the Indiana Jones mold to a TV series, the Bonekickers team doesn't have any action hero types, so they don't do much fighting or engage in physically challenging tasks.  Like the legal profession, movies and television have glamorized the field of Archeology far beyond reality, and Bonekickers continues the tradition, with overdramatic plots where the historical fate of civilization is often hanging in the balance.  The series basically takes itself too seriously, with a pretentious attitude to whatever the particular situation is, usually without having the goods to back up the premise.  Routine discoveries, often lead to overdramatic conclusions.  Things are way too simple, where a simple fact, turn of a phrase, or a line from a literature, can serve as a clue to connect the dots of a mystery that has been long unsolved.

With all that said, the series is still kind of interesting in part because of the curiosity to see if the big build up, will actually lead to a solution that makes sense or is historically significant.  An archeologist may have a different opinion, but the stories are mostly a disappointment, as the group seems to destroy as many artifacts as they preserve.  Critical reception in England was generally not very favorable, and the series ended.

In `Army Of God"" the opening episode, the team discover a piece of wood that may have been part of Christ's crucifix.  This eventually leads to what may have been the marker of Christ's final resting place, in a secret underground chamber.  The episode `The Lines Of War' features the discovery of a buried World War I tank.  The tale seems to be headed in one direction, but ends up in a really weird place involving the remains of Joan of Arc.  Swords and the cross are highly significant in the series, and Gillian Magwilde discovers the famous Excalibur, hidden in a pool, in the series finale `Follow the Gleam'.  One of the more violent episodes, it ends with an odd family reunion, and the unfortunate loss of another priceless artifact.

With decent production values, Bonekickers is a mildly entertaining television series, that features various picturesque and historical locations, and has some decent cinematography.  Although it tries hard to capture a spirit of adventure, it doesn't really achieve it, as the series seems to fall short in character development and story quality departments.  The DVD set contains all six episodes in the complete series, on three DVD's, with a run time just short of six hours.  There are some nice extras for each episode that cover matters related to the production.  If you are interested in this series, you might want to try and get it used, or wait for a price drop.",1312070400,2,4500,5.072010869565218
3140285,1,B00153ZL3M,"Somehow I find it comforting that American TV is not alone in being mind-numbingly idiotic and ignorant. Exhibit A: ""Bonekickers.""

This British TV show is quite simply one of the stupidest shows I've ever seen that didn't involve the words ""reality TV."" Allegedly about a band of archaeologists, it rapidly decays into a steaming, soupy mess of bad melodrama, cliches, bad history and logical errors that would reduce even Indiana Jones and Lara Croft to hysterical sobbing.

The skeleton of a Crusader is found in a Bath suburb (no, I don't know how nobody found him!), and for some reason it shocks everybody that a Middle-Eastern coin was found there. Next to a Crusader. Who was in the Middle East. The face that this is a ""mystery"" shows you a lot about the series.

So Dr. Gillian Magwilde (Julie Graham) and her associates Dr. Ben Ergha (Adrian Lester), Professor ""Dolly"" Parton (Hugh Bonneville), and noob Viv Davis (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) are brought in to investigate. They find a chunk of wood that may have been part of Christ's cross (or not). But of course, they're being targeted by a TV fundamentalist and a pair of crazy ""Templars.""

The gang also investigates a bunch of African slaves betrayed by George Washington, which is of interest to a transparent Obama stand-in; the death site of Boudica in Bath (what?); a WWI tank prototype filled with bodies from different countries, a Babylonian artifact, a CGI snake and an illegal antiquity-seller; and the search for Excalibur despite a bunch of white-masked... somebodies.

The best thing you can say about ""Bonekickers"" is that it makes for a wonderful drinking game. It becomes almost hilarious as it goes on, because it's so completely divorced from reality. This is the only series I've ever seen where not only does a crazy hallucinating woman talking to a ditch count as ""archaeology,"" but she regularly BREAKS and DISCARDS ancient artifacts.

That's right: Dr. Magwilde is depicted as a brilliant archaeologist and historian, but she actually comes across as a crazy woman who killed the REAL Dr. Magwilde and assumed her identity. And Julie Graham's over-dramatic, tooth-baring acting doesn't help either.

But the insane main character isn't the biggest problem. Oh no. It's fairly obvious that the writers were just flinging whatever sounded cool into the scripts, whether it made sense or not. They also apparently didn't have access to google or wikipedia, since they make basic errors in history (Joan of Arc did not leave a skeleton!) and logic (why is there a powerful TV fundamentalist in ENGLAND?). And they throw in a lot of soap opera twists, such as a character discovering that an associate IS HER SISTER.

And because this series wasn't idiotic enough, they inject it with large amounts of sociopolitical poopery. Christianity is depicted as being full of insane half-witted murderers, Islam is depicted as being naive innocent victims of evil Christianity, Obama is openly worshipped, and American Southerners are depicted as being slavery-loving bigots. Oh, and George Washington is depicted as a weak-willed wuss... as opposed to the warrior nicknamed ""Devourer of Villages.""

I wish I could say that at least the supporting cast was okay, but they're not. Mbatha-Raw is as wooden as Christ's cross, and Lester looks almost apologetic for starring in this. Bonneville is the only halfway enjoyable character, and he plays a drunk misogynist.

""Bonekickers"" is a series best enjoyed when you're hanging out with a bunch of friends and a bottle of alcohol. At least then you can sit around and make fun of it.",1311897600,10,3596,5.0285714285714285

The show is pretty far fetched, they solve thousand year old mysteries, but that's what I liked about it.

For instance in the first episode they uncover a major religious artifact. But the show is really very good. Gillian(the main character) is looking for a specific item throughout history, this same quest lead her mother to a break down that landed her in an asylum. Each episode is like a mini movie because most things r wrapped up @ the end of each episode. There r a few lingering things that r throughout the series but for the most part you  fell like each episode has a resolution. The BBC is great in the way they don't move @ a soap opera pace.

This one however is  somewhat about acheology but mostly the archeology is just a backdrop for making up stories featuring historical figures like Boudica and others.  Ok , that's what lots of shows like this do however but this one often reflects the views of the writers which can be jarring especially in the first episode. They go on and on about the crusades but refuse to acknowledge the fact that the muslims had invaded europe starting out in the 800's and continued to do so long before the crusades ever took place. In other words the past is full of injustice and it's from both sides. The bbc has always been gutless about making any constructive shows about the radical part of Islam. And while we know there are radical christians and most of us abhore them,  although their numbers are very small these days, the bbc can't ever come to grips with any bad muslims (in the bbc world all muslims are good)  or deal with radical islam unleashed in mosques right in the uk preaching death to everyone is the west. The bbc needs to make a show in which good muslims try to stop the psycho wahabist type of islam, now that would be a great show.  Anyways the shows acting is fine and this series only lasted one series so you get all the episodes here.

The acting is good.  Each episode combines somewhat fractured historical mysteries with modern forensics and a modern tale to tell; each focuses on a particular period of history, beginning with the Crusades and ending at World War I.  The episodes are:

1. Army of God.  Blood-stained piece of 2000 year old wood; Jesus' cross, perhaps, Knights Templar, a modern-day fanatical Christian preacher and his unhinged followers.
2. Warriors.  The bones of 18th century slaves in the Bristol Channel.
3. The Eternal Fire.  A dig underneath the famous Roman baths at Bath uncovers a series of caves once used for prisoners, perhaps including Britain's famous warrior queen Boudica.
4. The Cradle of Civilisation.  An Iraqi archaeologist, and former lover of Gillian's, arrives in Bath searching for some long lost secret.
5. The Lines of War.  The discovery of a British WWI tank buried in France creates many mysteries: it holds the remains of six soldiers, British and German, and contains clues that seem to point to France's Joan of Arc.
6. Follow the Gleam.  Apparent discovery of King Arthur's famed Round Table leads Gillian to renew her - and her archaeologist mother's - lifelong search for Arthur's sword Excalibur.

The plots were indeed ridiculous and the acting was fine.  But their depiction of how archaeology is done disappointed.  People picking up artifacts and carrying them off before mapping them in.  No grid lines marking off units.  No photography of artifacts in situ. And when they find the piece of cedar from the Holy Land infused with blood, nobody mentions that crucifixion was a common form of execution in that place, at that time?  C'mon.

3140307,4,B00153ZL3M,"If the title of my review suggests that Bonekickers is slightly shallow entertainment, and I'm not saying it is, that shouldn't be taken as any kind of knock against the show. Bonekickers is unashamedly lightweight fun, brought to life by some very fine actors (especially Adrian Lester and Hugh Bonneville) and devised by some very fine TV writers. Those writers, Matthew Graham and Ashley Pharaoh, were also two of the creators of the classic Life on Mars. While I wouldn't put Bonekickers up on that same pedastal, it's a class act and thoroughly enjoyable.

Some have pointed out that the history on display in Bonekickers may not be 100% accurate, as if that somehow makes the show sub-standard. I'll leave it to the history majors to weigh in on that. For me, the idea that Bonekickers plays fast and loose with historical facts (and I'm sure it does) doesn't bother me any more than knowing that Life on Mars is almost certainly not a thoroughly accurate depiction of 1973 police procedures. Quite the contrary, like any good TV show from Doctor Who to The West Wing, Bonekickers exists on its own terms, and for six hours of escapist entertainment that's more than enough..",1265241600,9,1181,4.817733990147783

from the usual excellent BBC.",1265068800,5,356,4.409090909090909
3374678,5,B00153ZL3M,"Bonekickers  is a modern day British drama series about a team of archaeologists. Bonekickers is from the creator of Life on Mars  and Ashes to Ashes. It stars Julie Graham, Hugh Bonneville, Adrian Lester, and Gugu Mbatha-Raw.

The series is sort of a combination of the British sci-fi series, Torchwood, and the American crime drama, CSI. It's set in the city of Bath in England and combines modern forensic science (like CSI) with mysteries from the past and has a touch of sci-fi in it as well.

Bonekickers ran for one series in 2008 and was not renewed for a second series. There were a total of six episodes, all of which are contained in this three-DVD package. DVD special features include behind-the-scenes segments for each episode.

Dr. Gillian Magwilde (Julie Graham) is the leader of the archaeology team. Professor Gregory ""Dolly"" Parton and Dr. Ben Ergha (Adrian Lester) work on the team with her and Vivian Davis (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) is an intern. Each episode is capable of standing on its own although you'll get a better feeling for the characters as a whole if you watch the entire season.

The archaeological finds that are unearthed are always a bit of a mystery. They don't tend to be found where they're supposed to be and that's part of the interest in the series. For example, the first episode is about a blood-stained piece of wood believed to be from the cross that Jesus was crucified on. It was found in a cave in England and nicely meshes with the legend of the Knights Templar.

The starting point of some of their archaeological finds is probably not historically accurate. It's questionable whether or not a piece of bloodstained cross would actually be found in Bath or whether or not 18th-century manacled slaves would be found in a ship off the coast of England. The mystery behind the location of the artifacts is part of the draw of the stories.

There are flashbacks in history throughout each episode that add a bit more mystery to the investigations. Dr. Gillian Magwilde (Julie Graham) has occasional psychic flashbacks as well that give the series a bit of a sci-fi twist.

Given the subject matter of historic battles and mysteries, there is some violence in the series although it's very well done and not overly graphic. Professor Gregory ""Dolly"" Parton (Hugh Bonneville) has a tendency to make comments with sexual connotations which portray him as a slightly dirty old man and there is the very occasional shot containing partial nudity.

All in all, the series is highly entertaining and historically interesting. It's an enjoyable blend of history, science, and drama with just enough action to keep your attention. Given the very occasional nudity, I'm not sure I'd recommend it for younger children but the series would easily appeal to the PG-13 market. The series is not rated at the time of my review but does contain the warning ""Contains violence and graphic scenes"" so use your own best judgment.",1263340800,40,2953,4.841269841269841
3374679,5,B00153ZL3M,"BONE-TICKLING GOOD if viewed as entertainment for ADULTS not concerned with complete factual information. It has a bit of fantasy, a lot of action (violence & graphic), and suspense aplenty. Not being an archaeologist nor a European history expert, the plots of the episodes were convincing enough to carry the story. This short-lived 6-episode series ""BONEKICKERS"" is acted well enough to make it a worthwhile DVD keeper. Scenes from contemporary Bath, England, are visually romantic.

The Wessex Univ Archaeological Dept. team has a major relic to uncover and then to discover the current-day ramifications of the artifact. Both the past and the present is a mystery every time, much to the delight of the mystery-loving viewer. A linking thread is a continuing plot relating to Gillian's mother, Karen, obsessed to madness over her sword quest and journal, of which has been absorbed into the life of Gilly, aka Dr. Magwilde, protagonist of the series played by Julie Graham (beautifully so). Prof. Gregory Parton (Hugh Bonneville) has plenty of funny dialogue about Gilly's chest, and not a chest found buried in the ground. Dr. Ben Ergha (Adrian Lester) a young black archaeologist of the department makes up the university staff. Well, except for the less-than-competent dept. head Daniel Mastiff (Michael Maloney). A very young black intern, Viv (Gugu Mbatha-Raw), arrives on the scene. She's unwelcome by Gilly, due to Viv's inexperience or beauty or anyone's guess. Quite soon into the episodes, they all feel like family to the viewer.

The writer actually suggests an ""Indiana Jones"" comparison, but this is better in the way historical and contemporary worlds merge. There's enough Gothic, war, Celtic, and Medieval violence to keep the young kids away. In the end, a connection to all of the episodes becomes evident, with a clashing conclusion. Remember it is as fictional as The Da Vinci Code, regardless of what was written in that book's opening page.  But it's convincing enough, only the experts will notice the difference. Me? No! I simply enjoyed it all. Every episode has a ""dig"", each a chamber. Entertaining DVD to ""DIG INTO.""

YES, distributor Acorn Media has provided SUBTITLES.
Original TV airing was in 2008.
To much bonus to list, but you have the chance to select behind the scenes footage and interviews for selected phases of production with every episode. Quite interesting ""making-of"" stuff.

Episodes:
1 Army of God: A battle including Knights Templar. Were they carrying a precious cargo? A Christian relic? Includes a graphic broadsword beheading (not for children). Crusades come to 21st Century. A favorite line: ""For the love of Jehovah, may we go to the pub?""
2 Warriors: Bones are recovered on a beach, bodies with no hands. Shackles also are found suggesting slaves.  It's only the beginning of a complex mystery encompassing 2 centuries, multiple continents.
3 The Eternal Fire: Celtic 1st century relics are found under baths in the city, Bath. Celtic fires appear related to Roman fires as well as the lives of the 2 civilizations. Archaeologist science meets imagination.
4 The Cradle of Civilisation (spelling is correct): Babylonian artifacts appear for sale on the black market in Bath. Gillian's Iraqi ex-lover is looking to recover a tablet with prophecy (Babylonia's 10 commandments). Gillian wants to help.
5 The Lines of War: WWI tank is found in France with 6 body remains. But why also is there Joan of Arc clues? Much more than expected is discovered here.
6 Follow the Gleam: Gillian & Viv work on a new relationship. An Arthurian discovery (the Round Table?) is made in an area known as Camelot. Is it finally a break in Dr. Magwilde's quest for Excalibur? Archaeology turns vicious. Will Gilly end like her mother?

Good BBC drama presented in a unique form. My recommendation: ""Let's dig!""

3374727,3,B00153ZL3M,"What this is NOT- it is NOT a female Indiana Jones type show. It is not similar to Bones or any of the other shows you see on the slipcover (CSI, Dr Who etc).

Even with all it is NOT, I thought it sounded interesting and despite some of the terrible reviews, I thought I'd give it a try. Sadly, it has earned the poor ratings.
 I give it 3 stars because it had some interesting ideas about various mysteries from history. I like history and I like mysteries so that is good.  It is easy to watch while your doing something else. I also liked it much better after the first two shows since it stopped pushing the anti Christian, political opinions as much as it did in the first two. It's clean without a lot of swearing, very little blood, and your children could probably watch it and enjoy it.  It could have been great with more likable characters and better acting from the secondary actors and a little bit more believable archeology scenes. I'd love to see this redone only better and without the politics.

If you want to ruin what is an interesting premise you take the bad acting, wild theories, poor archeology scenes, this show has and then toss in some anti American weird comments and political judgement (Oh Great, he's a Republican and we have to work with him!) and coat that all with a lot of anti Christian comments (Oh surely, your educated enough to not believe that crap)

Essentially this show is about a team of archaeologists who are freelancers (?) Yet who work for a university (?) and the rest of the show is just as confusing.
The characters are fairly predictable. There is a strong female lead, Dr. Gillian Madwilde, with a bit of a mystery around her. I think had she been more likable I would have enjoyed the show a whole lot more. But she's judgmental, quick to anger, suspicious of everyone around her except for when she should be suspicious, then she's very trusting. She's harsh and fights a lot with an old flame who is also on the team. She is also a dreamer and willing to believe all sorts of wild theories with no proof or facts to back her up. The old flame is a tactful man who tries to keep Dr. Gillian on the straight and narrow. There is a younger intern who believes everything and apparently has to have everything explained to her. She is wide eyed and excited about everything and an older man who is all about the sexual innuendos etc.
Surrounding these four man characters are a series of bad actors that couldn't keep things moving along. I think the script had a lot to do with it.

And the worst part is-  in each episode, almost every scene that had archeology involved- I found myself rolling my eyes. I'm not an archaeologist but I could do a better job than they did. In one scene, for example, they deliberately break a jar from antiquity that has liquid in it, just to see what is in the jar. Who does that?

In each episode the investigate something that is so amazing it can't be believed. They discover the Cross of Christ, The Hanging Gardens of Babylon etc etc. And in each episode something happens so that they have no proof of their discovery. The Cross burns up, the grave gets flooded etc.
Over arching this is some mystery about Dr. Gillian's mother. I would have enjoyed the show a lot more if I had understood the mystery straight up from the start. By the fourth or fifth show I was still trying to figure out what exactly is this mystery and flat out didn't care by the end of the shows.

So there it is, It's likable and enjoyable at times yet at the same time it drags on.  It has some great actors and poor acting. It has some interesting premises and yet it gets stupid at times.

3374756,4,B00153ZL3M,"I complained so loudly about historical balderdash in the 1st episode that I surprised even myself by watching the 2nd. It was better, and by the 6th episode, my feelings about ""Bonekickers"" had considerably improved. I love history and I love mysteries, and the Bonekickers' premise, combining the two, is a winner. It turned out to be an OK series. I liked the ""Behind the Scenes"" Bonus Extras, too.

In England, when construction or farming turns up an ancient artifact, business stops while the archaeologists are called in to check things out. The Bonekicker team, out of the fictional Wessex University, loves going out in the field to investigate. They usually end up with more excitement than they bargained for. Gillian Magwilde, team leader, also has a personal quest which she pursues throughout the series. She is continuing her mother's search for an ancient artifact; a search that cost her mother her professional reputation and sanity.

""Bonekickers"" originally aired in 2008 in 6 episodes. The BBC was prepared to commission a 2nd series, but the writers/producers, discouraged by unkind critical reception and low viewer ratings, decided to pursue their interests elsewhere. They probably couldn't  afford to get Hugh Bonneville back, anyway, now that he's a star as Lord Crawley on ""Downton Abbey"".

In the 3 DVD or 2 BluRay disc set, you get 344 minutes of viewing, plus the special features. Viewing aspect is 16:9 widescreen and sound is Dolby digital stereo. English subtitles are available for all episodes. Each episode has it's own ""Behind the Scenes"" special features.

Episode 1. ""Army of God"". A construction crew turns up a 14th century Middle Eastern coin. How did a coin issued by a Sultan turn up in Somerset? The Bonekickers are called in and unearth several bodies hacked to pieces. Research turns up that Knights Templar were secretly escorting a Christian relic to England in 1307, trying to protect it and themselves, since Templars were on the run after their disgrace. The Sultan's warriors followed them to Bath and destroyed them. But what if the Sultan didn't get the relic? And what if there are still Templars today - ""When the call comes, I will be ready.""
This episode is fun and over-the-top, including a psychotic televangelist, but I was really annoyed by the ridiculousness of its basic premise. It's unlikely a Sultan would have cared about a Christian relic. And though the Templars were on the run after Friday the 13th, October, 1307, their hunters were Catholics, particularly Philip IV of France, who owed the Templars a lot of money and didn't want to pay it back.
Damascene is not the same as Damascus Steel.  Usually, you wouldn't say ""damascene steel"", because damascene means ""gold laid over steel"".
....Behind the Scenes (27 minutes total): Covers the idea of the show itself, the script, visual effects, shooting, editing, production design and the edit for live cut. The commentators focus on the scene in the cavern under the dovecote. It is very interesting to see what was actually shot in a freezing aircraft hangar, and then how the special effects, compositors, matte painters and editors turn it into the scene we watch on TV. Fascinating, including David Early (digital matte painter) explaining that the last thing they do is add ""traditional film grain. Things tend to not look real unless there's old-fashioned film grain in."" It's what our eyes expect.

Episode 2. ""Warriors"". Back in the late 1700's, English ships took metal and trinkets to Africa, picked up slaves, took the slaves to the Caribbean and America, and returned home with sugar and cotton. Slavery was legal in English colonies, but not in England proper. So why, when the Bonekickers excavate in the mud of the Bristol Channel, do they find slave shackles with severed hands?
A very interesting (and hypothetical) story.
....Behind the Scenes (15 minutes total): Covers the script, shooting and audio mix. It's interesting the kind of decisions they have to make on the sounds in any scene.

Episode 3. ""The Eternal Fire"". The first earthquake in 300 years hits Bath on Valentine's Day. Gas is escaping from previously unknown caverns beneath the famed Roman Bath and the historical site is shut down. But not before the Bonekickers sneak their way in.
Another interesting story, expounding on a historical what-if, this time involving the Iceni queen Boudica.
....Behind the Scenes (11 minutes total): Covers the script, shooting, audio mix and colour grade (British spelling). In the latter, it's amazing that they have to shoot on location at all. The colourist makes a scene shot in the afternoon look like it happened at night, highlights one person's face to make her stand out and make a table appear to glow when it is merely white.

Episode 4. ""The Cradle of Civilisation"" (British spelling) This episode moves from Babylon 331 BCE to modern day Iraq, 50 miles south of Baghdad. It's a war zone. A man trying to escape gunfire falls down decrepit steps. He finds skeletons, an amulet and a box with an ancient cuneiform-covered vessel.
""I've got an Etruscan spear in my hand and I'm not afraid to use it!""
....Behind the Scenes (21 minutes total): Covers the script, shooting, costumes, foley and visual effects. Foley refers to the physical sounds that actors and animals make. It's like the men in the background making the horse clopping noises for a radio show, except it's much more involved. I got a kick out of the sound machinations for the animated snake. In reality, you probably wouldn't hear a snake moving over a carpet. But for the TV show, it adds zing to make a sound for that.

Episode 5. ""The Lines of War"". In a field outside Verdun, the French have uncovered a buried WWI Mark 1 tank, The French call in the Bonekickers as a courtesy, because the Mark I was British, the first tanks ever fielded. Why is the undamaged tank deliberately buried? And why does one of the WWI soldier bodies inside it have a tattoo of the Cross of Lorraine, the sign of Joan of Arc?
This is a cool episode and I enjoyed the story arc and it's conspiracy theory background. However, I have to nitpick: Joan of Arc was the Maid of Orlans, not the Maid of Lorraine.  She had a coat of arms, but it had no cross on it. The Cross of Lorraine is sometimes called the Crusaders Cross, because it was used by the Knights Templar in their beginning, before switching to the Maltese cross, But I don't think there is a connection to Joan of Arc.
....Behind the Scenes (18 minutes total): Covers the script, shooting and music. I got a kick out of listening to Dee Gregson, location manager: ""We needed to find a WWI tank to build the interior of. This is the only Mark 1 tank in existence."" And they found it at the Bovington Tank Museum in Dorset. Even better, they were able to film inside the tank in the museum. So look around the tank interior scenes - it's the real thing.

Episode 6. ""Follow the Gleam"", The Bonekickers travel to Glastonbury, where another archaeology team is searching for ""the ultimate"" Arthurian artifact. But Gillian thinks they've missed an important clue, and is not put off when a mysterious group called the Disciples of Good Use warns her off. The warning works on Gregory Parton, her co-worker, who tells Gillian, ""If they're behind this, you've lost.""
....Behind the Scenes (19 minutes total): Covers the script, shooting and audio mix. As you watch this episode, try to pick out where they used a Barbie Doll as a stunt double.

An enjoyable series, though the historical ""facts"" are sometimes hard to swallow. At a reduced price, it's a lot of viewing for not a lot of bucks.

I love most British shows because they're (usually) well done and far more imaginative than many of our own here in the US. (The fact that we remake tons of British shows just bears that point out.)

My only real problem with Bonekickers, so far, has been the so very obvious use of the show for political support. Warriors, Episode 2, is, partially, about the first black man running for President, and even uses the same political catch-phrase as our current president. They even go so far as to make a derogatory remark about Republicans. I don't care who you voted for, I just don't like it when a show does this, especially a non-US show.

3374779,5,B00153ZL3M,"BONE-TICKLING GOOD if viewed as entertainment for ADULTS not concerned with complete factual information. It has a bit of fantasy, a lot of action (violence & graphic), and suspense aplenty. Not being an archaeologist nor a European history expert, the plots of the episodes were convincing enough to carry the story. This short-lived 6-episode series ""BONEKICKERS"" is acted well enough to make it a worthwhile DVD keeper. Scenes from contemporary Bath, England, are visually romantic.

The Wessex Univ Archaeological Dept. team has a major relic to uncover and then to discover the current-day ramifications of the artifact. Both the past and the present is a mystery every time, much to the delight of the mystery-loving viewer. A linking thread is a continuing plot relating to Gillian's mother, Karen, obsessed to madness over her sword quest and journal, of which has been absorbed into the life of Gilly, aka Dr. Magwilde, protagonist of the series played by Julie Graham (beautifully so, just like in ""William and Mary""). Prof. Gregory Parton (Hugh Bonneville-excellent in 'Downton Abbey') has plenty of funny dialogue about Gilly's chest, and not a chest found buried in the ground. Dr. Ben Ergha (Adrian Lester) a young black archaeologist of the department makes up the university staff. Well, except for the less-than-competent dept. head Daniel Mastiff (Michael Maloney-'The Young Victoria'). A very young black intern, Viv (Gugu Mbatha-Raw--from 'Larry Crowne', see my review), arrives on the scene. She's unwelcome by Gilly, due to Viv's inexperience or beauty or anyone's guess. Quite soon into the episodes, they all feel like family to the viewer.

The writer actually suggests an ""Indiana Jones"" comparison, but this is better in the way historical and contemporary worlds merge. There's enough Gothic, war, Celtic, and Medieval violence to keep the young kids away. In the end, a connection to all of the episodes becomes evident, with a clashing conclusion. Remember it is as fictional as The Da Vinci Code, regardless of what was written in that book's opening page. But it's convincing enough, only the experts will notice the difference. Me? No! I simply enjoyed it all. Every episode has a ""dig"", each a chamber. Entertaining DVD to ""DIG INTO.""

YES, distributor Acorn Media has provided SUBTITLES.
Original TV airing was in 2008.
To much bonus to list, but you have the chance to select behind the scenes footage and interviews for selected phases of production with every episode. Quite interesting ""making-of"" stuff.

Episodes:
1 Army of God: A battle including Knights Templar. Were they carrying a precious cargo? A Christian relic? Includes a graphic broadsword beheading (not for children). Crusades come to 21st Century. A favorite line: ""For the love of Jehovah, may we go to the pub?""
2 Warriors: Bones are recovered on a beach, bodies with no hands. Shackles also are found suggesting slaves. It's only the beginning of a complex mystery encompassing 2 centuries, multiple continents.
3 The Eternal Fire: Celtic 1st century relics are found under baths in the city, Bath. Celtic fires appear related to Roman fires as well as the lives of the 2 civilizations. Archaeologist science meets imagination.
4 The Cradle of Civilization (spelling is correct): Babylonian artifacts appear for sale on the black market in Bath. Gillian's Iraqi ex-lover is looking to recover a tablet with prophecy (Babylonia's 10 commandments). Gillian wants to help.
5 The Lines of War: WWI tank is found in France with 6 body remains. But why also is there Joan of Arc clues? Much more than expected is discovered here.
6 Follow the Gleam: Gillian & Viv work on a new relationship. An Arthurian discovery (the Round Table?) is made in an area known as Camelot. Is it finally a break in Dr. Magwilde's quest for Excalibur? Archaeology turns vicious. Will Gilly end like her mother?

Good BBC drama presented in a unique form. My recommendation: ""Let's dig!""

3374780,3,B00153ZL3M,"Bonekickers is not the best of British television, but it is not farther out there than the latest Zombie or Vampire movie in which people swallow one idiocy after another whole and enjoy it. The fatal flaw in this series (one that you often find in sci-fi or crime series) is the writer's tendency to descend into melodrama and soap opera - the original Star Trek is a case in point. This is a shame because the premise was an interesting one - archaeologists trying to piece together the past - there is inherent mystery in that. The writers tried to add in too much crazy stuff and you wonder at times what they were smoking at two in the morning with some of their 'brilliant' ideas, (they are also doing this with the latest Agatha Christie remakes). Less is often better than more. However, I liked the mix of cast and Hugh Bonneville was an excellent character who would have been even better as the lead. The one character should have ended up as the daughter and not the 'sister'. And I bet if the series had devoted itself to serious mystery writing, it would have been a hit.",1313020800,2,1086,4.435
3374781,3,B00153ZL3M,"Bonekickers (2008) is a short-lived BBC television series about a team of archeologists from a fictional university in England, that become involved in the investigation of a number of high profile cases.  The adventures attempt to incorporate historically significant elements, often with a connection to religion, into stories that supposedly have world changing relevance today.  In this, the series strives to emulate The Da Vinci Code, which is little tough to do once, let alone multiple times.  Quite unbelievably, the archeologists are repeatedly underground in some long hidden cavern, making some great discovery.

The team from Wessex University is led by Dr. Gillian Magwilde (Julie Graham), and includes Ben Ergha (Adrian Lester), Gregory Parton (Hugh Bonneville), and intern Viv Davis (Gugu Mbatha-Raw).  Magwilde comes across as tough, confident, and confrontational.  The very even tempered Ben, was romantically involved with Gillian in college, and is probably the one she counts on most.  Mastiff is a colorful figure, with a distinctive choice of dress.  He's brilliant, but occasionally prone to dramatics and inappropriate language.  These three know each other well, and the Viv is the newcomer who tries to fit in.  The group functions fairly well, but under Magwilde's leadership, they just don't seem to jell.  Magwilde seems to have issues getting along with everyone, and is also dealing with her sick mother, who was also a famous archeologist.  Ben and Viv are the most normal, and seem the most likeable, but this is probably not a group that most will fall in love with.  There is a story arc, involving a secret relationship, that while obviously important to the writers, just doesn't seem necessary.

While the series Relic Hunter (1999-2002) tried to apply the Indiana Jones mold to a TV series, the Bonekickers team doesn't have any action hero types, so they don't do much fighting or engage in physically challenging tasks.  Like the legal profession, movies and television have glamorized the field of Archeology far beyond reality, and Bonekickers continues the tradition, with overdramatic plots where the historical fate of civilization is often hanging in the balance.  The series basically takes itself too seriously, with a pretentious attitude to whatever the particular situation is, usually without having the goods to back up the premise.  Routine discoveries, often lead to overdramatic conclusions.  Things are way too simple, where a simple fact, turn of a phrase, or a line from a literature, can serve as a clue to connect the dots of a mystery that has been long unsolved.

With all that said, the series is still kind of interesting in part because of the curiosity to see if the big build up, will actually lead to a solution that makes sense or is historically significant.  An archeologist may have a different opinion, but the stories are mostly a disappointment, as the group seems to destroy as many artifacts as they preserve.  Critical reception in England was generally not very favorable, and the series ended.

In `Army Of God"" the opening episode, the team discover a piece of wood that may have been part of Christ's crucifix.  This eventually leads to what may have been the marker of Christ's final resting place, in a secret underground chamber.  The episode `The Lines Of War' features the discovery of a buried World War I tank.  The tale seems to be headed in one direction, but ends up in a really weird place involving the remains of Joan of Arc.  Swords and the cross are highly significant in the series, and Gillian Magwilde discovers the famous Excalibur, hidden in a pool, in the series finale `Follow the Gleam'.  One of the more violent episodes, it ends with an odd family reunion, and the unfortunate loss of another priceless artifact.

With decent production values, Bonekickers is a mildly entertaining television series, that features various picturesque and historical locations, and has some decent cinematography.  Although it tries hard to capture a spirit of adventure, it doesn't really achieve it, as the series seems to fall short in character development and story quality departments.  The DVD set contains all six episodes in the complete series, on three DVD's, with a run time just short of six hours.  There are some nice extras for each episode that cover matters related to the production.  If you are interested in this series, you might want to try and get it used, or wait for a price drop.",1312070400,2,4500,5.072010869565218
3374782,1,B00153ZL3M,"Somehow I find it comforting that American TV is not alone in being mind-numbingly idiotic and ignorant. Exhibit A: ""Bonekickers.""

This British TV show is quite simply one of the stupidest shows I've ever seen that didn't involve the words ""reality TV."" Allegedly about a band of archaeologists, it rapidly decays into a steaming, soupy mess of bad melodrama, cliches, bad history and logical errors that would reduce even Indiana Jones and Lara Croft to hysterical sobbing.

The skeleton of a Crusader is found in a Bath suburb (no, I don't know how nobody found him!), and for some reason it shocks everybody that a Middle-Eastern coin was found there. Next to a Crusader. Who was in the Middle East. The face that this is a ""mystery"" shows you a lot about the series.

So Dr. Gillian Magwilde (Julie Graham) and her associates Dr. Ben Ergha (Adrian Lester), Professor ""Dolly"" Parton (Hugh Bonneville), and noob Viv Davis (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) are brought in to investigate. They find a chunk of wood that may have been part of Christ's cross (or not). But of course, they're being targeted by a TV fundamentalist and a pair of crazy ""Templars.""

The gang also investigates a bunch of African slaves betrayed by George Washington, which is of interest to a transparent Obama stand-in; the death site of Boudica in Bath (what?); a WWI tank prototype filled with bodies from different countries, a Babylonian artifact, a CGI snake and an illegal antiquity-seller; and the search for Excalibur despite a bunch of white-masked... somebodies.

The best thing you can say about ""Bonekickers"" is that it makes for a wonderful drinking game. It becomes almost hilarious as it goes on, because it's so completely divorced from reality. This is the only series I've ever seen where not only does a crazy hallucinating woman talking to a ditch count as ""archaeology,"" but she regularly BREAKS and DISCARDS ancient artifacts.

That's right: Dr. Magwilde is depicted as a brilliant archaeologist and historian, but she actually comes across as a crazy woman who killed the REAL Dr. Magwilde and assumed her identity. And Julie Graham's over-dramatic, tooth-baring acting doesn't help either.

But the insane main character isn't the biggest problem. Oh no. It's fairly obvious that the writers were just flinging whatever sounded cool into the scripts, whether it made sense or not. They also apparently didn't have access to google or wikipedia, since they make basic errors in history (Joan of Arc did not leave a skeleton!) and logic (why is there a powerful TV fundamentalist in ENGLAND?). And they throw in a lot of soap opera twists, such as a character discovering that an associate IS HER SISTER.

And because this series wasn't idiotic enough, they inject it with large amounts of sociopolitical poopery. Christianity is depicted as being full of insane half-witted murderers, Islam is depicted as being naive innocent victims of evil Christianity, Obama is openly worshipped, and American Southerners are depicted as being slavery-loving bigots. Oh, and George Washington is depicted as a weak-willed wuss... as opposed to the warrior nicknamed ""Devourer of Villages.""

I wish I could say that at least the supporting cast was okay, but they're not. Mbatha-Raw is as wooden as Christ's cross, and Lester looks almost apologetic for starring in this. Bonneville is the only halfway enjoyable character, and he plays a drunk misogynist.

""Bonekickers"" is a series best enjoyed when you're hanging out with a bunch of friends and a bottle of alcohol. At least then you can sit around and make fun of it.",1311897600,10,3596,5.0285714285714285

And because this series wasn't idiotic enough, they inject it with large amounts of sociopolitical poopery. Christianity is depicted as being full of insane half-witted murderers, Islam is depicted as being naive innocent victims of evil Christianity, Obama is openly worshipped, and American Southerners are depicted as being slavery-loving bigots. Oh, and George Washington is depicted as a weak-willed wuss... as opposed to the warrior nicknamed ""Devourer of Villages.""

I wish I could say that at least the supporting cast was okay, but they're not. Mbatha-Raw is as wooden as Christ's cross, and Lester looks almost apologetic for starring in this. Bonneville is the only halfway enjoyable character, and he plays a drunk misogynist.

""Bonekickers"" is a series best enjoyed when you're hanging out with a bunch of friends and a bottle of alcohol. At least then you can sit around and make fun of it.",1310774400,11,3596,5.0285714285714285
3374784,5,B00153ZL3M,"I'm a huge fan of the BBC so I thought I'd give this show a try. It was definatley worth a look see. The show is pretty far fetched, they solve thousand year old mysteries, but that's what I liked about it. It's out there in the fact that things r done in such a timely manner + that they r the only people to have thought of these things. For instance in the first episode they uncover a major religious artifact. But the show is really very good. Gillian(the main character) is looking for a specific item throughout history, this same quest lead her mother to a break down that landed her in an asylum. Each episode is like a mini movie because most things r wrapped up @ the end of each episode. There r a few lingering things that r throughout the series but for the most part you  fell like each episode has a resolution. The BBC is great in the way they don't move @ a soap opera pace. Which is great considering that there r only six episodes for this series. They also have behind the scenes for each episode so u get an inside look. If u like shows that wrap things up each episode then give this a try, you won't be dissapointed.",1274140800,,1140,4.158371040723982
3374795,3,B00153ZL3M,"The bbc can come up with some great series like survivors which also featured the excellent julie Graham in the lead role.  This one however is  somewhat about acheology but mostly the archeology is just a backdrop for making up stories featuring historical figures like Boudica and others.  Ok , that's what lots of shows like this do however but this one often reflects the views of the writers which can be jarring especially in the first episode. They go on and on about the crusades but refuse to acknowledge the fact that the muslims had invaded europe starting out in the 800's and continued to do so long before the crusades ever took place. In other words the past is full of injustice and it's from both sides. The bbc has always been gutless about making any constructive shows about the radical part of Islam. And while we know there are radical christians and most of us abhore them,  although their numbers are very small these days, the bbc can't ever come to grips with any bad muslims (in the bbc world all muslims are good)  or deal with radical islam unleashed in mosques right in the uk preaching death to everyone is the west. The bbc needs to make a show in which good muslims try to stop the psycho wahabist type of islam, now that would be a great show.  Anyways the shows acting is fine and this series only lasted one series so you get all the episodes here.
It's a decent show but like alot of filmland few historical facts abound here in this series.  That's not a major complaint though because facts often don't get in the way of filmland do they?.",1273276800,4,1578,4.458333333333333
3374796,4,B00153ZL3M,"""Bonekickers"" is a new BBC television series about modern day archaeologists that was written and executive produced by Matthew Graham and Ashley Pharoah, multi-award winning co-creators of the British and American hit&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Life-on-Mars-The-Complete-Series/dp/B001XRLWLU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Life on Mars: The Complete Series</a>, and its sequel&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ashes-to-Ashes/dp/B0025G22I0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ashes to Ashes</a>: it debuted on BBC One in July 2008 and aired on select public television stations in the U.S. in summer 2009.

And it sure ain't about your grandfather's archaeologists; you might consider it to be about archaeologists on steroids, a wild and wooly action /adventure show that most resembles the long running British series&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doctor-Who-The-Complete-Specials/dp/B002ZHKZEM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doctor Who: The Complete Specials </a>, with a shovel standing in for the good doctor's tardis; or, if anyone has ever seen it, the 1941 movie&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hellzapoppin/dp/B000OV7OVS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hellzapoppin</a>.  Continuous, zany action, a million ideas thrown up on the screen to see which ones stick - and, for heaven's sake, don't go near it if you like your history straight and unfractured.  It comes to us in a three disk set containing six episodes, approximately 344 minutes plus 107 bonus minutes.  And, bless you Acorn Media Group, subtitles - they really help here.

The series is filmed and set in the ancient, beautiful city of Bath, England, and no expense has been spared in the filming: backgrounds are lush, plenty of vehicles and extras.  It stars Julie Graham (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/At-Home-with-the-Braithwaites-The-Complete-First-Series/dp/B0002HODEU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">At Home with the Braithwaites - The Complete First Series</a>) as Gillian Magwilde, the fiery leader of a team of archaeologists; and may I say, parenthetically, it's the only recent British TV series I can recall in which the women are wearing comfy shoes, and/or boots. A great blow for accuracy in the depiction of female ""bonekickers,"" that.  However, the only two stars of the series with which I am familiar are Hugh Bonneville (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Notting-Hill/dp/B000023VTP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Notting Hill </a>) as Gregory Parton, an Indy Jones like character, down to the hat; and Michael Maloney, (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Forsyte-Saga-The-Complete-Series/dp/B00007149J/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Forsyte Saga - The Complete Series</a>), playing Daniel Mastiff, another of his irritating dweebs.  Guest stars include Eamonn Walker (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Oz-The-Complete-First-Season/dp/B00005Y6YJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Oz - The Complete First Season</a>), and Burn Gorman (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Torchwood-The-Complete-First-Season/dp/B000VWE5OY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Torchwood - The Complete First Season</a>).  The acting is good.  Each episode combines somewhat fractured historical mysteries with modern forensics and a modern tale to tell; each focuses on a particular period of history, beginning with the Crusades and ending at World War I.  The episodes are:

1. Army of God.  Blood-stained piece of 2000 year old wood; Jesus' cross, perhaps, Knights Templar, a modern-day fanatical Christian preacher and his unhinged followers.
2. Warriors.  The bones of 18th century slaves in the Bristol Channel.
3. The Eternal Fire.  A dig underneath the famous Roman baths at Bath uncovers a series of caves once used for prisoners, perhaps including Britain's famous warrior queen Boudica.
4. The Cradle of Civilisation.  An Iraqi archaeologist, and former lover of Gillian's, arrives in Bath searching for some long lost secret.
5. The Lines of War.  The discovery of a British WWI tank buried in France creates many mysteries: it holds the remains of six soldiers, British and German, and contains clues that seem to point to France's Joan of Arc.
6. Follow the Gleam.  Apparent discovery of King Arthur's famed Round Table leads Gillian to renew her - and her archaeologist mother's - lifelong search for Arthur's sword Excalibur.

If you can kick back and enjoy this kind of thing, it's light, escapist fun, not to be taken too seriously.",1271376000,,4738,6.959527824620573
3374797,2,B00153ZL3M,"I had hopes for this series but was let down.  I was willing to accept ridiculous plots in exchange for good acting and some archaeology.  The plots were indeed ridiculous and the acting was fine.  But their depiction of how archaeology is done disappointed.  People picking up artifacts and carrying them off before mapping them in.  No grid lines marking off units.  No photography of artifacts in situ. And when they find the piece of cedar from the Holy Land infused with blood, nobody mentions that crucifixion was a common form of execution in that place, at that time?  C'mon.  I'll suspend a lot of disbelief and forgive a lot in the bargain, but this series really pushed me to the limit.",1268870400,7,697,4.655737704918033

3374804,4,B00153ZL3M,"If the title of my review suggests that Bonekickers is slightly shallow entertainment, and I'm not saying it is, that shouldn't be taken as any kind of knock against the show. Bonekickers is unashamedly lightweight fun, brought to life by some very fine actors (especially Adrian Lester and Hugh Bonneville) and devised by some very fine TV writers. Those writers, Matthew Graham and Ashley Pharaoh, were also two of the creators of the classic Life on Mars. While I wouldn't put Bonekickers up on that same pedastal, it's a class act and thoroughly enjoyable.

Some have pointed out that the history on display in Bonekickers may not be 100% accurate, as if that somehow makes the show sub-standard. I'll leave it to the history majors to weigh in on that. For me, the idea that Bonekickers plays fast and loose with historical facts (and I'm sure it does) doesn't bother me any more than knowing that Life on Mars is almost certainly not a thoroughly accurate depiction of 1973 police procedures. Quite the contrary, like any good TV show from Doctor Who to The West Wing, Bonekickers exists on its own terms, and for six hours of escapist entertainment that's more than enough..",1265241600,9,1181,4.817733990147783
