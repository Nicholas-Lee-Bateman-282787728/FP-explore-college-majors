3645219,5,B001HVZO70,Saw this movie and thought it would be a wonderful birthday gift. It was nicely packaged and arrived in great condition.,1234742400,2,120,4.761904761904762
3645220,5,B001HVZO70,"This movie is truly inspiring and true.  Yes, it had dark elements, but the elements are presented in a way that you can relate to in everyday life and great for the entire family.  The movie was shot in Kansas City (which is in Missouri!) and hopefully this paves the way for more and more films to be created in this beautiful city.  I travel a lot and you'd be surprised how many people believe the main Kansas City is actually in Kansas...there is a Kansas City, Kansas in actuality...but it's very, very small in comparison.  How 'bout that...a little geographic lesson in a movie review.  Much like many life lessons in this movie...buy it today!",1233619200,3,652,4.586206896551724
3645221,3,B001HVZO70,Iwould recommend this as an excellent family movie emphasizing relationships and strains within families and the love and devotion to all creatures small and large. Beautifully. filmed with a group of talented performers  and a final act for Peter Boyle.,1233532800,5,254,5.35
3645222,5,B001HVZO70,"This is a great movie for a family to watch together.

Viven Cardone gives a fantastic performance as a troubled
girl who learns the universal truth, that being of value
to someone, is being of value to yourself.

It will be fun to watch as her career develops.

Peter Boyle was excellent and perfectly cast as a man
nearing the end of his life who has a big heart and a
lot of experience.

The story was a good one and will cause everyone who
watches it to think about how we treat animals.",1233446400,,491,4.191489361702128
3645223,5,B001HVZO70,"You could not help but fall in love with this family.  Peter Boyle's last performance is hilarious!  The landscape in Missouri and Kansas is picturesque!  Bought 6 DVD's to give for birthday parties, friends and family!  Hard to find movies these days that all ages can enjoy!",1233446400,,276,4.808510638297872
3645224,5,B001HVZO70,"This movie is excellent. Having several friends with young children I hear all the time that there aren't any family films that aren't animated, and that they have a tough time finding live action films that the whole family can watch. This is one.

It has a great message behind it and is beautifully shot, beautifully acted. I'd recommend it to any one with kids or anyone wanting a film that will make them feel good afterwards.",1233360000,4,431,4.597402597402597
3645225,1,B001HVZO70,"I just rented and watched this movie, and I was disappointed. The actors are pretty good, but there are very few(if any) endearing characters. There is a whole lot of discussion about Euthanasia(putting animals to sleep) which adds a very dark element to the film. This film will be very confusing for children! Peter Coyote plays a very angry character. The movie drags on and on and on. This is not the worst movie I've see, but I definitely don't suggest you buying it. If you are really interested rent it like I did.",1233273600,5,521,4.553191489361702
3645226,5,B001HVZO70,"I just finished watching this incredible movie and I loved every moment of it! Amazing acting, heart touching story. A perfect family movie. It is a must see or you will miss out on a movie that will deeply touch your heart!",1232841600,7,224,4.357142857142857
3645227,4,B001HVZO70,"Pleasant family movie, about a young girls journey, growing up losing her mother from a tragic car accident. Her dad takes the heat, not knowing at first how to survive without her.
Later on, his daughter makes him realize where his love and attention should be. Sometimes, the often most difficult, can be the best blessing .",1427241600,,326,4.7368421052631575

3645233,5,B001HVZO70,I ordered this movie because it was filmed right here in my area. There are many things/places in the movie that I recognize and have been to.,1402272000,,142,4.296296296296297

3645236,1,B001HVZO70,"I believed the reviews here, but was disappointed with this DVD. I bought it for my nieces, but it wouldn't hold their interest at all. Unfortunately, this movie is slow, the plot is inane, the acting is mediocre, and overall it is so bad it is embarrassing to watch.  I forced my self to sit through the first 7 minutes, then fast-forwarded through the rest of the film, hoping it would get better. It didn't.  Look it up on on rottentomatos.com for a more realistic set of reviews.  I have watched many ""great family movies"".  This isn't one of them.",1371859200,4,552,4.49
3645237,1,B001HVZO70,"...it was so awful! Like another reviewer said, it has nothing to do with a girl and her horse. It's a jumble of loosly-related stories, with really bad acting and scenes which seem like they don't belong with the rest. I'm not even sure what the plot was supposed to be. I fast-forwarded through much of it, then eventually gave up. I don't intend to finish watching it.",1357344000,3,371,4.470588235294118
3645238,5,B001HVZO70,This was a truly great movie with a great message for all animal lovers.  I would recommend this to everyone.,1356220800,,109,4.45
3645239,1,B001HVZO70,i am very upset that i got half way through the movie and it froze. I tried it on 2 different dvd players so i know it is the movie . this upsets me to get half way through a promising movie and it quits working.,1347321600,,212,3.630434782608696
3645240,5,B001HVZO70,a beautiful family movie made me laugh and cry excellent movie for adults and children watch this togrther as a family im sure youll give it a thumbs up,1336089600,,152,4.275862068965517
3645241,2,B001HVZO70,"I bought this to watch with my 6-year old daughter, who is mature for her age and  horse crazy.  I say that because this movie is NOT appropriate for the youngest of this genre's audience.  I am glad she did not understand most of it.  The theme of death permeates the entire movie...  The main character's mother dies in a frightening scene before the opening credits have even run.  2 years later her dad (the local dog catcher) rounds up 17 cats from a grief-stricken old woman only to find out there is no room at the shelter for the cats.  The shelter manager's proposed solution to this? Euthanize 17 existing animals to make room! It gets worse.  After setting free all of the animals in the pound, Belle is sent to grandfather's horse farm for an ""attitude adjustment."" As we quickly learn, animals are expendible to Grandpa.  On Belle's first day at the farm, we learn that one of Grandpa's prize fillies have suffered a torn suspensory ligament.  Now, this is not a broken leg and it is pointed out that this horse earned a lot of money for the farm.  Her reward? You guessed it - euthanasia. The fact that she is not ""dog food"" and merits interrment in the farm graveyard is supposed to make everyone feel better.  As I said, death irreparably darkens this movie. A litter of puppies born ""imperfect"" sentenced to death in the local river...  Neighborhood dogs dying back in Belle's home town for no apparent reason.  No wonder poor Belle actually thought her father euthanized her mother! It is all too much for this supposedly family-friendly film.  The fact that all is not as it seems and the movie gallops furiously to a feel good finish is simply too little too late.  I was left feeling depressed and glad it was over...  And that my daughter lost interest very early on.",1304726400,13,1789,4.5579937304075235
3645242,5,B001HVZO70,I throughly enjoyed watching this movie with my family. It was a very clean and refreshing video (something that is becoming increasingly harder to find).Highly Recomended but for the guys it may be a bit Chick Flickish but still worth the time to watch.,1300924800,,254,4.795454545454546
3645243,1,B001HVZO70,"Bought this movie for $20, thinking it was a movie about a girl and her horse, as the cover shows. Found out after I watched it that it was, in fact, NOT A HORSE MOVIE, but some stupid, unrealistic, fake, coming-of-age story. Hhhhfff!",1298678400,5,234,4.465116279069767

3645247,5,B001HVZO70,"I bought this movie because my friend said it was good. that it reminded her of my dad and she almost cried and my dad passed away in october, so, i thought i would get it and watch it. It shipped faster then i thought it would and it wasn't broken or scratched so and overall really good movie so five stars",1279843200,,308,3.9838709677419355
3645248,2,B001HVZO70,"The excellent cover photo for the dvd made the film look appealing, but the
movie is slow moving and mostly boring. About a third of the movie needs to be
edited out.  A number of times I almost shut it off.
  The music is good, but the acting is mediocre.
  When the child goes to live with her grandfather, you see the value of work &
praise to help a child be happier.  Earlier she was very angry and unhappy.
  Near the end of the film the girl was allowed to boss the grandfather around,
making her look superior and the grandfather look stupid -- too much of this in
today's films and TV shows.
  Overall, the movie is not worth seeing.",1275868800,,642,4.188524590163935
3645249,4,B001HVZO70,"I thought this was a nice movie about family life and growing up, nothing indecent and no bad language that I can recall picking up on.  I purchased this movie as a gift for someone that is a real animal lover.  I know some people in other reviews worried about explaining euthanasia of the dogs to their children but I think it's something they need to know about and be aware that this really happens in this world and I feel this would be a good teaching moment for the child to learn that they can make a difference when they decide to stand up for something.  I did think the acting was kinda weak for an adult viewer, these aren't major celebrities here, and yes maybe that of a made-for-tv movie, but that it was still well done and heartfelt.  I felt it had a good storyline with a tear-jerking happy ending. I liked it.",1261180800,11,828,4.288461538461538
3645250,4,B001HVZO70,It's a great movie. It arrive just a few days after ordering it and it was in excellent condition.,1259366400,,98,4.2105263157894735
3645251,1,B001HVZO70,This movie had great actors and a lot of promise. The script writers wrecked the plot about half way through the movie. Belle (Vivien Cardone) is an misguided teenager because she believes her father spoke to the doctors and approved of euthanasia. Later she finds out this is not the case. This is one of your typical Hollywood movies today which show parents and even grandparents aren't too bright and the children are the only ones all-the-brains. By the end of the movie she has pretty much showed everyone their life mistakes and made the world a great place. Not a good movie to show your children sends the wrong message concerning parent-children interactions.,1250812800,2,669,4.87719298245614
3645252,4,B001HVZO70,there are parts that are slow but in all its a great movie. I got confused at parts. I had wanted to just see the movie at a Red Box so when I bought it I think I had very high hopes for it. so that could be the reason why I gave it a four instead of a five.,1245974400,,258,3.316666666666667

She lets loose her Dad's ( town dog catcher)  pound animals
and gets in real trouble.
She gets ""farmed out"" to her grandfather who is a crusty old
horse trader.
The combination of animal rights, dogs and horses
ends up with the creation of a new  way.
I didn't really like the movie much,
but it appears to be one that you can take your family too.",1243555200,3,414,4.227848101265823
3645254,5,B001HVZO70,"This is a great movie for helping kids understand that animals are not to be mistreated, disposed of like old property, and to be valued and treated well. It also demonstrates that you can't be too young to become an animal advocate. I've volunteered at a local animal shelter for 7 years and wished I had an opportunity to start when I was much younger so I could have done much more to help animals.

5/25/2013: Watched it again. As good as the 1st time I watched. I don't get why they could euthanize the dog within a day. Most municipalities keep the dog in quarantine for 10 days for rabies protocol, or perform a more costly necropsy. So that was a bit odd.  I had forgotten what happened when the ranch hand tossed the bag into the river.

Not sure what people expected who were disappointed, but this was a nice and well rounded movie, sort of like movies of the past without the things that make up movies today. It's nice to have heartwarming movies like this.

And, I also forgot why the dog bit the ranch hand.  Like I said, I loved this movie as much as I did the 1st time I watched it 4 years ago.  Teared up again. :)

If you're buying this for kids like 12 and under, it's a great movie. More kids should watch movies like this when their younger. Hopefully it would open a few of their eyes. Of course it won't help everyone, but those few it touches, it'd be worthwhile.",1238457600,8,1388,4.2748091603053435
