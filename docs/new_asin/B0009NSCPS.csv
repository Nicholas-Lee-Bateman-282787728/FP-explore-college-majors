2302167,5,B0009NSCPS,"Being a fan of this famous dancing couple, I was quite pleased by their comeback. As opposed to their popular films from the thirties, this film shows the couple already married. Thus, the screwball situation begins when Mrs. Barkley decides to become a dramatic and tragic actress on her own, free from her husband's influence. Things get complicated because there is a French playwright who not only encourages her, something that Barkley has neglected in doing, but also seems to be falling in love with her. Mr. Barkley adds tension to the plot when he helps his wife through telephone calls while pretending to be the French playwright. The plot is quite funny although it takes a while to take off.

The musicals scenes, however, are brilliant. Starting with the opening credits Astaire and Ginger are dancing. They also get to tap-dance together Bouncin' the Blues. The most emotional pairing of the two is the revival of a George Gershwin's song from Shall We Dance, They Can't Take That Away from Me. While in Shall We Dance, Astaire only sings it to Ginger to express his falling in love with her, in this version, they do a ballroom dance and the lyrics take on a new meaning within the context making this scene more powerful. Astaire gets to a unique solo routine as he tap dances with lots of shoes, a memorable Astaire performance of Shoes with Wings on. Oscar Levant joins the couple to play majestically two classical tunes, the Sabre Dance and Concerto no. 1 by Tchaikovsky. Although the direction of Mark Sandrich in early classics, such as Top Hat, the Gay Divorcee, Carefree, and Shall We Dance is missed here, the performances of Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire and the musical numbers lift this film from what could have been a mediocrity. I was able to see both dancers doing dramatic acting, particularly Ginger Rogers. The movie may not be there with Top Hat and Shall We Dance, but it is almost there.",1463616000,,1927,4.7351190476190474

2302173,3,B0009NSCPS,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

Well, looks like good ol' Nostalgia ruled the day on this viewing. I was wowed with their first color installment and mesmerized with the still beautiful Rogers. She was only 38 mind you but don't think she danced much for many years. The crazy shoe dance was fun trying to determine the special effects used and seeing Fred in a skirt was a hoot.

I kept waiting for them to dance like they used to, face to face, but Fred held onto that cane for dear life. Could he not lift her anymore for that fabulous lift/twirl that immortalized the couple in ""Swing Time"" or maybe it was ""Top Hat"" or ??? Dang can't recall the exact title but you know the routine. However, in the last dance segment he did her a twirl with his back to the camera, a stand-in???

I enjoyed watching Oscar tickle the ivories in the Sabre Dance and Tchaikovsky's B Flat wild renditions. Sadly Dorothy was unavailable for the Wizard Dance but delighted to see my favorite dancers unite in harmony.

High recommend for the last hurrah of the greatest duo of the thrillin' thirties musicals.",1434240000,,1102,4.522613065326633

2302204,4,B0009NSCPS,"This isn't the greatest of the Astaire-Rogers movies.  The only reason it is all that memorable is that the dance numbers are solid, Oscar Levant played a hair-raising version of the Sabre Dance and a chopped down version of Tchaikovsky's 1st piano concerto.  This was done about ten years after their years at RKO and was cobbled together because Judy Garland wouldn't come out of her dressing room.  The studio fired/suspended her while she kept the whole crew waiting.  Astaire's comment about it was ""There's no excuse for bad manners...""  The plot is a bit creaky but the numbers, including Astaire's ""They Can't Take That Away From Me"" make it worthwhile.",1402704000,,661,4.918918918918919

So I enjoy movies that not only end happily but show there are real problems but you can move beyond them.
I used to watch musicals on Friday nights when I was in high schools. I always liked Astaire and Rogers, I love the dance numbers especially the romantic dances, the softness, the implications. I have seen this movie at least twenty times, it relaxes me.

2302212,2,B0009NSCPS,"that Judy Garland did not appear in this film.  After the phenomenal success of ""Easter Parade"", the powers that be thought for certain (rightly so) that a follow-up pairing would be just as wonderful for the MGM coffers.  For whatever reason(s),
Garland could not essay the role, so the powers that be felt that a reunion with Ginger Rogers would be right up Fred Astaire's alley.

So they hauled out and dried off Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire, under contract, had little say in the matter.  He went along with it; a company man.

This film allows us the thrill and appreciation of enjoying the once-in-a-lifetime pairing of Garland and Astaire all the more.  This ""reunion"" between Fred and Ginger falls flat.  Very flat.  In their RKO musicals they were elegance personified but here they are MGM'd and Technicolored to the max and it's garish.  Not worthy of them.  Certainly, by this time (1948/9) Rogers needed something - anything - to further her career and a ""reunion"" with Fred seemed like a sure bet.

I think the film is dreadful and I'm glad Garland didn't do it.  Supposedly, a few songs had to be dropped as Rogers couldn't do them.  I'll stick with ""Easter Parade"".",1367884800,,1183,4.712195121951219

2302235,4,B0009NSCPS,"This is a rare treat: we have an Astaire-Rodgers film - their tenth and last together - in colour. The dancing is as effortless as always, which is a measure of their talent and professionalism for, after making one or two films every year for seven years (1933-39), there had been a hiatus of ten years before they got together again on screen. The plot is insubstantial - a husband and wife dance team squabbling over whether or not they should stay together or go their separate ways. The screenplay was by Betty Comden and Adolph Green.
The supporting cast is headed by composer, pianist, and actor Oscar Levant who is his usual laconic, slightly cynical but always witty self; in the movie Levant gives sparkling performances of Khachaturian's Sabre Dance and a much edited first movement from Tchaikovsky's 1st Piano Concerto. We can see why George Gershwin chose Levant to champion his Piano Concerto after his death.
The original film music is by Harry Warren with lyrics by Ira Gershwin or Arthur Freed. The hit song is `This heart of mine' with, as a finale, a reprise from the film Shall We Dance of the Gershwins' `They can't take that away from me'.
Despite its shortcomings judged from the standards of more modern musicals, an Astaire-Rogers musical, in colour yet, is always entertaining.",1343606400,,1304,4.825892857142857

2302237,3,B0009NSCPS,"Compared with many of the great films Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers combined to make, this is one of their lesser efforts.  Still, it has an interesting history.  Ten years earlier, they made their last picture.  Ginger was a last minute replacement for an injured Judy Garland.  The story as it were, revolves around John and Dinah Barkley, a successful song and dance team that perform on stage.  Dinah catches the eye of a French director who wants to cast her in the lead in a drama about a young silent movie star, Sarah Bernhardt.  Her hubby had been taking her for granted over the years and she wants something new.  Could this story ring true of Rogers and Astaire's relationship?  In any case, they break-up and she does the play, unaware that John has been giving her direction over the phone pretending to be her French director.  He of course, has also fallen for her.  As you might expect, the story is just pretense for some fine dancing.  Although I must admit, both Astaire and Rogers have begun to show a little ""tooth"" by this stage of their career.  In a secondary role, Oscar Levant has some pretty funny scenes and the filmmakers clear out time for a couple excellent piano numbers.  The boy can play.",1314835200,,1224,4.585253456221198

This film looks as though someone colored it with magic markers in the most garish colors imaginable.  However wonderful some of the dance routines might be--as noted by some of the better reviews here--I was too distracted by the poor quality of the picture to appreciate them.

2302240,4,B0009NSCPS,"Betty Comden & Adolph Green's THE BARKLEYS OF BROADWAY was the last Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers movie, and what a great finale it is.

Filmed in Technicolor on lavish sets, with gorgeous costumes and music provided by Harry Warren and Ira Gershwin, a familiar story of a couple breaking up and later reconciling has an added post-WWII twist of the woman choosing  her own career over being the lesser of two performing Barkleys.

Song and dance man Josh Barkley's frequent reminders that his coaching was the key to wife Dinah's success is such a source of irritation to her, that when offered the lead in a legitimate drama Dinah chooses to leave musical comedy and her husband behind. Josh is jealous of playwright/director Jacques Barredout's doting on his wife, and even though they've officially separated, he lurks backstage during rehearsals of ""Young Sarah Bernhardt.""

Dinah struggles in a serious role. Jacques loses patience and barks at her in front of other cast members. Sympathetic Josh secretly places a number of phone calls to Dinah and, by pretending to be Jacques, gives acting advice that helps her enormously. But it looks like the payoff is Josh will lose Dinah to his rival.

Every musical piece in this film is a highlight. Co-star Oscar Levant amazes with his pianistic skill on two numbers, Khachaturian's ""Sabre Dance"" and the 1st movement of Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto #2. Fred does a spot-on Harry Lauder impression on ""My One and Only Highland Fling."" Blue screen is used in the ""Shoes with Wings On"" number, where seven pairs of shoes (one is pink high heels) magically dance with Fred.

A charity fund raiser is a perfect opportunity for Ginger and him to reprise the Gershwin brothers' ""They Can't Take That Away from Me,"" a song first heard in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/SHALL-WE-DANCE/dp/B0006GAI6Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">SHALL WE DANCE</a>&nbsp;(1937). This time however, the two also dance to it. Astaire is clearly older than in his RKO days and Rogers is a bit thicker in the waist, yet they haven't lost the magic that makes a Fred & Ginger picture such a treat. Don't miss this final pairing of the greatest cinematic dance team of all time.

2302242,4,B0009NSCPS,"After they appeared in ""The Story Of Vernon and Irene Castle"", Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers went their seperate ways. Fred went to MGM studios while Ginger stayed a little while longer at RKO (where they made their classic movies together).
Ginger sought out comedies and serious dramatic  roles, winning an Oscar for ""Kitty Foyle"". Fred made several musicals, then retired briefly. ""Easter Parade"", with Judy Garland, was Fred's comeback. Judy was supposed to be in ""The Barkleys of Broadway"", but when she dropped out, Ginger stepped in. When it was made in 1949, it was Fred and Ginger's first film together in ten years. It would also be their last.
Josh (Fred) and Dinah (Ginger) Barkley are married stage stars. When Dinah wants to play straight dramatic roles, it leads to the end of their partnership and problems in their marriage. Josh comes up with a scheme to get them back together both personally and professionally.
The smart and witty script was by the husband and wife team of Betty Comden and Adolph Green, who would go on to write the screenplay for ""Singin' in the Rain"" three years later.
The highlights are, of course, the production numbers. ""My One and Only Highland Fling"" is performed by Fred and Ginger wearing kilts. Fred gets a wonderful tap solo, ""Shoes With Wings On"", in which dozens of shoes come to life and dance by themselves. Silly, yes, but it works.
George and Ira Gershwin's ""They Can't Take That Away From Me"", which Fred had sung to Ginger in ""Shall We Dance"", is reprised here. At Ginger's suggestion, they did a dance to it this time, because there was no dance included with it when they did it before. The dance for this version was a lovley one.
This film may seem slow at first, but repeat viewings show how classy, elegant and funny it really is.
The DVD includes a ""Making Of"" featurette, the trailer, a cute Droopy cartoon,and a forgetable short subject.
Fans of Astaire and Rogers will want to add this to their collection.",1232582400,,1977,4.713872832369942

I am no lyricist but on occasion once given the cue I was able to anticipate every line to the finale of the some songs of some features. The plots sometimes leave something to be desired--sitting through them. This cinema is much more than their ""poetry in motion"" outwitting on the dance floor the rest of the movie. That great song of love that is finally urequited captures the vain imagining of the heart, the mirages of the mind. But Astaire's chivalry plants the seed of yet another futurity for the pair in art that was not consummated in life. Truly, ""They can't take that away from me.""",1228435200,,662,4.610169491525424
2302254,5,B0009NSCPS,"After a ten year hiatus, Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers got together made their tenth and final movie together. Finding Astaire 50 years old, and Rogers, 38, it's the dancing couple's first and only picture together in color, full, saturated Technicolor, no less.

The movie differs from the stars' previous work in that they start out as a bickering married couple. Rogers is tired of being made to feel that Astaire has been her Svengali and craves a serious move. (Kitty Foyle, somebody?) The French climax was a brilliant touch.

Astaire is awesome. The ""Shoes With Wings"" routine, I feel was only the third best dance scene in the movie. ""Bouncing The Blues,"" an entertaining workout, was incredible! Staccato taps, to stripper-like finish with Rogers concealing their affection with the curtain at dances end, was pure joy. Though not as limber as she was in her youth, Ginger looks athletically muscled, and makes up for the changes over time. Her partner leads with a chemistry only those two know.

But the emotional apex of the film has to be the rhapsodic reprise of ""They Can't Take That Away From Me,"" from ""Shall We Dance,"" on which both Ira and George Gershwin worked. With Breathless artistry and excellent precision, I get chills watching this dance. Watch Ginger and Fred near the end of this closely: Magically mesmerizing, they made love in dance, and you can feel the flames of their passion.

That timeless highlight was the pinnacle of their whole union. My only regret is even after ten movies, they left me wanting more.

Alas, history can't take the magic from their legacy away from me.

2302255,4,B0009NSCPS,"""The Barkleys of Broadway"" is an excellent vehicle to reunite Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. The merits are excellent colour and the stars themselves, mature and well cast and recreating their magic both in dance and in their obvious warmth and rapport. The drawbacks depend on whether you like MGM musicals or not. For me, the film has that overproduced and pretentious quality which was typical MGM. Oscar Levant is his usual tiresome self and there is one very high camp bit when Rogers recites the ""Le Marseillaise"" in a bid to demonstrate within the plot that she is a great dramatic actress. It is hard not to laugh.

The print of the film is excellent and there is good choice of variable extras. The short film ""Annie was a Wonder"" is a sentimental and corny tale of a Swedish girl becoming an American citizen and hard to watch. The cartoon is another MGM dud with Droopy, the dog. The theatrical trailer for the film is included but best of all there is the last part of a series of documentaries about Astaire and Roger's legacy. Astaire's daughter appears and the doco captures all one would possible wish to know about how the reunion occurred.

The DVD is OK value but better if purchased as part of one of the Astaire /Rogers collections.",1214784000,,1254,4.618834080717488
2302256,4,B0009NSCPS,"""The Barkleys of Broadway,"" a musical comedy/romance, (postwar, 1949) was, unexpectedly, the tenth and last film Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers made together.  It finds Astaire 50 years old, and Rogers, 38, and was made, after a ten-year hiatus, during which they each did their own things, and Rogers won an Oscar for her serious work in ""Kitty Foyle."" Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios made it, rather than the pair's original studio, Radio Pictures(later RKO).  Famed MGM producer Arthur Freed, working in his prestigious music unit, gave it a no-expense spared gloss; it's the dancing couple's first and only picture together in color, full, saturated Technicolor, no less.

The somewhat slow, stagebound script was by Betty Comden and Adolph Green, and it is witty: at one point, Astaire says, ""I've been sneezing and coughing like a Model T."" As is widely known, Astaire, having stepped successfully into the dancing shoes that were meant for Gene Kelly in ""Easter Parade,"" and worked happily with Judy Garland, was expected to reteam with Garland here.  But Garland had been fired, she was ill, although she was apparently well enough to show up on the set, without invitation, and  harass Rogers, who had been invited to take her part. Most sources say that Comden and Green therefore had to rewrite the part for Rogers.  Most sources also point out that the scriptwriters somewhat followed real life, in that Astaire wanted to be the best song and dance man ever, whereas Rogers yearned for the respect given a serious actress, see ""Kitty Foyle.""  However, let's remember that Garland also yearned for the respect given a serious actress, and eventually made ""Judgment at Nuremberg,"" and ""A Star Is Born.""  So whose life were the scriptwriters really thinking about, from the beginning, anyway?

At any rate, this movie differs from the stars' previous work in that they start out already married, (they are quite middle-aged by now) and bickering, rather than courting, and they are portrayed as being already at the height of their careers, enjoying a Broadway hit. They are Josh and Dinah Barkley in this one, and Rogers is tired of being made to feel that Astaire has been her Svengali; she wants a hit of her own, preferably a serious one.  The script also differs from their other work in that it provides them with no individual foils.  Instead we have the talented piano player and acerbic wit Oscar Levant as their mutual best friend, and Billie Burke in her usual scattered society hostess role.  Charles Waters directed; Cedric Gibbons art directed, giving the film its lively look.

Nobody knows quite what to make of Rogers' way over the top, out of the blue, reading of ""La Marseillaise."" My only theory is that perhaps it was meant as a homage to the then fairly recent wartime ""Casablanca.""  If you can stop crying long enough during that film's ""Marseillaise"" scene, you'll notice that it, too, is a bit overwrought.  However....

The film's original music was composed by the well-known Harry Warren, with lyrics by George Gershwin,who had died, shockingly young, and most agree the music's nice, but not up to the dancers' earlier great material.  However, the pair get a spirited, entertaining, rhythmic workout to ""Bouncing The Blues."" Their Scottish ""Highland Fling"" number is enjoyable.  ""Manhattan Downbeat"" just doesn't work.  Astaire's favorite, famed choreographer, Hermes Pan, comes back to work on the big, well-known ""Shoes With Wings."" But the evocative, emotional highpoint of the film has to be the reprise of ""They Can't Take That Away From Me,"" from ""Shall We Dance,"" on which both Ira and George Gershwin worked.  It reminds us of every reason we loved the earlier pictures.",1197676800,,3713,5.0261011419249595
2302257,3,B0009NSCPS,"Beware.  While this is one of those Astaire/Rogers films with some wonderful dance numbers, the color print put out here by Warner Brothers is terrible.  The transfer is so dark as to be sometimes unwatchable. Compare the fabulous tap number here by these two that's found in That's Entertainment and you'll see that this print is like looking through a dark filter. I bought this DVD to have the Shoes With Wings On number and, in my opinion, the best dance ever done by this pair - They Can't Take That Away From Me.  Warners may have done all right with the early Fred and Ginger black and white pictures but this transfer isn't up to par with the fine job done by MGM on their musical gems from the golden era.

The release of the ""Dream Factory"" collection is a fine example. These films could have been photographed yesterday (""Summer Stock"" is a pure delight to watch in terms of picture quality). ""Barkleys of B'way"" unfortnately does not live of to the exceptional quality acheived on other films of this genre.

The DVD picture quality is very poor and dull and the sound is very muted. I was so dissappointed in this treatment. The DVD appears to have simply transfered the Video to DVD. No restoration to the picture is at all apparent. Even the trailer looks better than the movie.

The extras are fine and I can't complain here but hey Warners, what were you thinking when you tackled this gem. Someone must have been taking a sickie!

Though essentially a musical comedy about a stage couple whose long association has created tension between them you sense the words spoken by the two actors has a ring of truth in their real life partnership.  That said, there are enough musical and dance routines to lighten the air.  Aside from the impressive piano stylings of Oscar Levant there is also the breathtaking ""Shoes With Wings"" sequence with Astaire.  Though not the most entertaining of the Astaire-Rogers pairings it is a curio that should not be missed if one wants to understand the career trajectory of this legendary team.",1125273600,,711,5.0
2302263,4,B0009NSCPS,"After a ten-year absence, Fred and Ginger (F&G) are dancing as a pair one last time in their only Technicolor movie. It's not your typical F&G movie. Their acting has matured so much so that you forget that they dance, too. It has a little more drama and a little less comedy. Instead of boy meeting and chasing girl, their characters are already married, which provides a different relationship on screen. Also, Ezra Miller (Oscar Levant) is superb in his piano playing.

The featurette ""Reunited at MGM: Astaire and Rogers Together Again"" explains how F&G pair up for this film by accident, their continuous chemistry, and Fred's perfection. It includes interviews with Ava Astaire McKenzie (daughter), archivists, and biographers with a mix of F&G photographs and film clips. Broadway choreographers and performers also appreciate how F&G have inspired them. (Run time 13:53)

The vintage short ""Annie Was a Wonder"" is a narrated docudrama about the Scandinavian working immigrant girl. It's a heart-warming, almost tear-jerker of a time gone by. (1938, B&W, Run time 10:51)

The MGM 1949 cartoon ""Wags to Riches"" stars Droopy the dog, who inherits his owner's estate but has to contend with a rival dog trying to get rid of him. (Run time 7:11)

2302274,4,B0009NSCPS,"Some think BARKLEYS a poor footnote to the great Astaire/Rogers films of the 1930s, but seeing it for the first time I was agreeably surprised.

The stars, fifteen years after their initial teaming at RKO, haven't lost their chemistry and seem as pleased to be together again as we are to see them that way.  It's nice to see A&R in color, for once.

The dances are really outstanding.  After a decade's break from musicals, Rogers jumps right back in without missing a beat.  And Astaire's dancing here is more athletic and energetic than in the earlier EASTER PARADE.

The female lead was originally intended for Judy Garland, who would have done it well (she did everything well), but it seems even better suited to Rogers. The role fits her like a glove.

On the downside, there's the heaviness of the MGM house style, that makes one long for the RKO light touch, and Oscar Levant -- who is more annoying than amusing and bangs on various pianos with a vengeance (what did those keys ever do to him?)  Levant has a formidible technique but he always seems to be punishing the piano for some grievous offence.  Lighten up, Oscar!

I think people say this film improves with subsequent viewings because the first time you're bothered by the virtues of the old RKO films it doesn't possess ... once you get over that, you can appreciate it for its own considerable strengths.  It's a fun and fitting close to one of the screen's greatest partnerships.",1124668800,,1452,4.654901960784314
2302275,5,B0009NSCPS,"people say that this is the weakest of the A/R bunch but I strongly disagree. It may not be their strongest (Top Hat & Swing Time) but it's not their weakest. It may even be in the top five. I agree with the other reviewers that the first time you watch it you're like ""Ok, that was just fine."" the secind time you watch it you say ""that was actually very good"" and the third time ""that was wonderful!"" This is a better than average MGM movie, and quite sophisticated too. JUdy annd Fred were fine in ""Easter Parade"" but who could beat our beloved Ginger Rogers with Fred? The direction is wonderful, some of the best they'd had. The acting is excellent, it's funny witty and the dances I think are superb. The technicolor is also beautiful, and it's nice to see Gin's blue eyes and deep red lip rouge. Ginger is no longer a lithe little thing with a delicate baby face, but she's beautiful and very grown up looking. She is in a woman's body now, and after not doing a real musical for almost 10 years (!) she is in incredible form. Her dancing is really up to par with Astaire.
Some intersing technical notes, in the Barkley's house. They have one bed that they share. Nowadays that seems like nothing, but back then the censors were still hot on the idea that married people shouldn't share a bed in movies, because it suggested sex. (So where DO babies come from then.) (At one point Fred does think Ginger's pregnant, but by 1949 the censors still couldn't read between the lines.) Another interesting thing is that they have their own bathroom, divided by a shoulder height wall. It comes to principal use when Roger's is undressing and we (including astaire only) see her shoulders and up.(God forbid she take off her shirt in front of her husband!)
The dance number are really exceptional in this. 0We see Swing Trot through the credits, but we catch the end alone, and it's really swell, then, Astaire croons to Rogers back at their house after bickering (again) while they're in bathrobes. (almost like the famed scene in Swing Time when he sings ""the way you look tonight"" and she come sout with shampoo in he hair) this time he sings, ""you'd be so hard to replace"" as if to remind the audience that for ten years, his partners haven't been up to the par as Ginger was. then there's 'Bouncin' the blues' i think one of their best taps together. it's a rehaersal number, and it's just adorable, sweet, and loads of fun to watch. It's that old Astaire/Rogers magic. It's almost like a grown up version of ""I'll be hard to handle"" Ginger and her liquid hips make a stripper's exit at the end of the number, with Fred leaning on her exended arm. Later that day, Josh and Dinah go to an art museum, where they are to see the unveiling of a new portrait of them. It shows Dinah as a pancake, and Josh, as the plate that molds her, (which is the common conception people had of A/R throughout their careers.) Ginger retorts at the sculpture in deadpan style. ""Why is my face a pancake?"" It's quite a funny scene. ""my one and only highland fling"" renews teh comical stuff they could do together. Ginger had a knack for putting on accents and mocking people. which is seen throughout her 73 movie career. 'MOAOHF' is a delightful number, and the ending is sweet. ""A day in the country"" is sund to Oscar Levant, as they take a trip to the country for a while, while he wants to go back to NY"" Ginger's voice is extremely good in this song, it seems to have develpoed a bit. ""Shoes with wings on"" is Fred's customary big solo and it's very good. what else can you say about the man who defied dancing? It's really quite good. But we can''t waut for his reunion with Gin. (They'd split at this pouint) Possibly the best number in the fil, ""They can't take that away from me"" a reprise from their 1937 movie ""shall we dance?"" it's one of my favorite songs period, and he sings it beautifully to her on stage. If you watch Her face expressions, you'll realize how much this number really means. The dance is gorgeous too. After the song is over, Ginger starts to cry, which she has always done with such emotion. Manhatten downbeat is their last dance together and it's a big splashy finish, with beautiful costumes. The very end show a close up of the greatest dancing team's faces.
20 years after Barkley's, they reunites at the academy awards, where they presented an oscar. They did a swirl and dip for old times, and the applause was so overwhlmind, the forgot to stop holding hands. :-)",1088121600,,4489,4.442424242424242
2302276,3,B0009NSCPS,"It's weird the things that get stuck in your memory. I never thought of this as an inferior film just because the formula separates itself from the RKO depression-era 30's (the film was made in 1949), though I seem to be hearing this a lot from critics. In fact, when I first saw the dance of 'They Can't Take That Away from Me,'  I actually thought it was a performance from a TV special, not a movie. The performance is an exhibit, not a love scene. There's something almost- I don't know- *cold* about the way they move on that bare, heavily draped, stage. It's also the first and only adagio they perform in color- which, in itself has a sense of an era ending. Nevertheless, they have the same emotional connection to each other, and at the ages of 38 and 50 respectively, they still carry off the grace and elegance. When they saunter off the stage, an excited audience breaks into applause- like they've been watching an act from THE ED SULLIVAN SHOW. It's extrordinary that ten years after Rogers remade herself doing straight award-winning drama and Astaire remade himself as a solo performer and a man who could dance with just about anyone, they could settle back into one more film and not have one strain of foot or hair out of place. MGM formula and Oscar Levant aside, it's a very nice way to end a professional marriage.",1037664000,,1336,4.520661157024794

2302279,5,B0009NSCPS,"In this 1949 Ginger Rogers/Fred Astaire reunion, Rogers and Astaire play Dinah and Josh Barkley, a successful wife/husband Broadway act. But their constant bickering leads to a breakup, right in front of the cameras of  look magazine! Dinah goes to star in a play about the young Sarah Bernhart  and Josh continues his show with an understudy named Shirley- I mean,  ""It's Shirlene dear!"" Eventually, they realize how they can't  live without each other.
This movie starts with a song called Swing Trot,  but it's hard to be seen behind the opening credits. Soon after, Dinah and  Josh have their first fight...on stage! They argue about which one deserves  the credit for the shows success in there curtain speeches. In the car to a  party at Mrs. Belding's house (played by Billie Burke-Glinda the Witch of  the North from the Wizard of Oz), the Barkleys have another fight,  forgiven, of course, soon after. Then, when Ginger leaves Fred out on the  terrace while she talks to a French playwright, Fred becomes mad at her,  but at the house, apologizes in song!
Then, it's a few days later, and  Ginger finds out she's getting an understudy-just incase the Barkleys get  into a fight and Dinah decides not to go on one night. She doesn't seem to  mind at first, but casually tosses a chair across the room when the  understudy is gone!
Later that day, Josh and Dinah go to an art museum,  where they are to see the unveiling of a new portrait of them. It shows  Dinah as a pancake, and Josh, as the plate that molds her. This really  annoys her!
Then its time for my favorite song in the movie, My One and  Only Highland Fling. It's a tale of courting in the highlands of Scotland,  and both Ginger and Fred have a ball with their Scottish accents, and  Ginger has great facial expressions.
After my One and Only Highland  Fling, Dinah and John go out to Mrs. Belding's house in the country with  their composer, Ezra (played by Oscar Levant).
There, Dinah becomes  interested in the script the Monsieur Jacques Bardeux has completed on  Sarah Bernhart. Jacques is convinced Dinah is perfect for the part, but  Dinah refuses because of her success with Josh in her musical comedy show.  However, he does convince her to take home the script and read it. Josh  catches her reading it, and moments later, LOOK magazine comes in their  apartment for a photo shoot! That is when they split.
Dinah goes to star  in ""The Young Sarah"" and Josh continues his musical comedy with  Shirlene, the understudy.
Eventually, a fantastic dance number comes on.  It is called ""Shoes With Wings On"" and is danced by Fred Astaire.  Fred own a shoe shop, and his shoes come alive magically. Shoes With Wings  On is kind of The Sorcerers Apprentice from Walt Disney's Fantasia.
Josh  snuck in on one of Dinah's rehearsals and hid in the back. He was shocked  with Jacques Bardeux's horrible direction, so later that night, he calls  Dinah, and has a dead-on impersonation of Jacques. He tells Dinah exactly  how to act and the next day at rehearsal, Jacques thinks she is wonderful.  He calls again the next night after watching rehearsal, and calls her  again, coaching her.
Ezra arranges for Dinah and Josh to appear at a  hospital benefit without the other one knowing the other one will be there  too.  After he performs a wonderful ""touching"" performance of  Tchicolvsky's 1st Piano Concerto, he announces that Dinah and Josh will  perform a dance together! They are shocked, but eventually, Dinah and Josh  agree. They perform a great number called You Can't Take That Away From Me,  in which Fred sings. After their performance, Josh asks Dinah to talk with  him about rejoining, but she declines. One might think she is mean, but  when Josh leaves, Dinah begins to cry.
The next thing you know, it is  Dinah's opening night in ""The Young Sarah"" and she is a  smash.
Afterwards, Josh calls Dinah again and tries to sound like Jacques  and asks Dinah if she still loves her husband, or if she loves him. Then  Jacques walks in! She answers to whom she now realizes is Josh that she  loves Jacques just to torture him a little bit.
Finally, she has realized  she must go back to Josh, so she goes to her old apartment where he still  lives, and puts on the record for the song You'd Be Hard to Replace, and  she lies down on a couch on the terrace. Just as the song is about to end,  the record starts repeating, and as she goes to fix it Josh walks in.
As  she is about to leave, she quotes him from one of his phone calls. She also  explains to him that she really loves him and wants to go back to musical  comedy.
This leads to Fred singing Manhattan Downbeat, the last  on-screen dance that the great immortals ever did together, which makes it  more enjoyable. Fred and Ginger dance in the living room, and then it fades  to the stage. Ginger is wearing a gorgeous colorful gown, and Fred is in a  black suit and top hat. As the song ends, Fred and Ginger get lost in the  chorus, but you can still pick out Ginger's gown! Then the camera zooms in  and freezes on Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire.
