3914813,1,B002E01LQ6,"I am a SciFi junkie. I even watch those lame made for tv movies on the SciFi channel, and I even enjoy them. But OH MY GOD, this miniseries is the worst SciFi ever, far far below even my lenient standards.

The story was clearly written by someone who could not pass a third grade science test. Every time the ""scientists"" open their mouths they spout some new nonsense that makes absolutely no sense at all like ""these changes in the moon's gravity will affect large objects on earth like cars and trains but will not affect smaller things like ants"". The character that says that says it right after saying that ""the way gravity works is that larger objects attract smaller ones"". This does not even make sense within the context of the flawed logic of the show.
On the more humanistic side of the story it is unbearably sappy with lots of scenes like a little girl who is constantly saying things like ""Is the man in the moon going to be all right?"".
I don't think I have ever not watched the end of a SciFi Movie (Even ""Plan 9 from outer space"" and ""Starship troopers""), but I found myself unable to even finish watching the first episode.",1245715200,7,1143,4.4170616113744074
3914814,5,B002E01LQ6,"I'm writing this after watching the first half of this miniseries.  I find the writing to be intelligently written, the acting the same....My feeling is that they're not going for sensationalism but more realism.  I don't know about ""brown"" asteroids (heavy asteroids) but it seems plausable (SPOILER ALERT) that one could hit the moon and cause it to be heavier, hitting with such force that it could change the moon's orbit. The special effects are awesome, esp. for a made-for-tv movie. As I say, I'm not an astronomer/scientist but it all seems logical. I'm looking forward to the conclusion next week and signed up to be notified when the DVD comes out.",1245628800,24,658,4.866071428571429

3914816,3,B002E01LQ6,"Movie is alright but Amazons video service lets you watch an ""HD"" 1080 movie in 480 most of the time when it isn't buffering anyway.  Keep in mind this is with a 300MB dwn / 10MB up connection and a 42ms ping to amazon.com.  I actually paid to watch a movie and feel like I needed glasses....",1491955200,,292,4.105263157894737

3914823,4,B002E01LQ6,They show commentary from other countries around the world but they did not take into account that it is 2 different hemispheres and totally different time zones.

3914828,2,B002E01LQ6,"I must partially blame Amazon Prime here. When I want to watch a movie, I do not expect it to be a TV movie or a pilot.  The female lead is merely ok, the male lead is wooden and his dialogue is even stiffer, although it improves for part 2. In fact the only performance with any depth at all is from James Cromwell (Babe). The only reason I'm not giving it one star is that some of the visuals, particularly shots of the moon, were kinda cool.

Addenda- Apparently this comes in 2 parts. You have to sit through rolling credits. Tacky.",1472860800,,536,4.194174757281553
3914829,5,B002E01LQ6,"This is such an incredible movie.  The appearance is that of a low budget film but the movie itself is amazing.  The plot is very plausible and the acting is superb.  The characters are so believable and do a fabulous job at portraying their part.  There were numerous times that the acting was so touching and human that is would literally evoke a response.....sometimes almost to tear or at least misty eyed.  Both of the two leading male characters and female characters are commendable.

While the movie is long.........3 hours and 10 minutes divided into two parts.......I felt it was very deserving of the time investment.  I actually watched it once and then about 3 days later watched it a second time.  And have no doubt, I will view it again before very long, even knowing exactly what is going to happen.  If you want to see a good movie that will play on your heartstrings, this is one.  While it is slightly science fiction based it is really a movie of people and their response to disaster.  I would not hesitate to recommend this.  Even so much that I literally spent 30 minutes searching through 3 years of Amazon orders just to write this review.",1472860800,2,1164,4.597087378640777
3914830,5,B002E01LQ6,"I have watched this TV-movie on Amazon about 6 or 7 times! It has been well worth the $10 I paid to buy it!  Each time I watch the movie --- it is a great movie and its a shame it is not as well-known as the other Asteroid Movie (Armageddon)! The acting is great.  The Plot is great too, with an Asteroid hitting the MOON as well as one hitting the Earth.

However, I have to ask: Did they have an Astrophysicist or Astronomer to advise them on this movie?  Apparently NOT.

See, a Brown Dwarf is a Gas-Giant Planet, larger than Jupiter, than is not large enough to achieve Nuclear Fusion and become a Star.  A piece of a Brown Dwarf would be just gas and if it hit the Moon would not cause much damage.

What hits the Moon in this movie is a NOT a piece of a BROWN Dwarf, but piece of a WHITE Dwarf!  A WHITE Dwarf is what the Movie says a BROWN Dwarf is: A WHITE Dwarf is the remnant of a Star that has gone Supernova.  A typical WHITE Dwarf is about 10 or 11 miles in Diameter and has a Mass of about TWICE that of our Sun!  I do not know how a piece of a White Dwarf breaks off, but it is good that only a piece hits the Moon, since, if the WHOLE White Dwarf hit the Moon, there would be NO more moon!!!

Also, the Asteroid that killed the Dinosaurs was 6 (SIX) miles wide, not 11 (ELEVEN) miles wide, as Maddie tells the President.

Other than that, it is a great movie.",1472688000,8,1375,3.9241877256317688

3914854,5,B002E01LQ6,"First of all, I am a true fan of David James Elliott. I am a JAG fan. Watched the whole series twice. So I must respect him making other movies.  IMPACT? Different for him.  The movie comes in two (2) parts which is required because it is a 'before our times' movie.  I could relate as seeing what is going on today's world, it seemed familiar.  I would not recommend watching both parts at once because it draws you in.  The technical stuff is so facinating.  But, if you do watch both parts at once, be cofortable.  If you go to another part of your living quarters you will miss the moment. Lillian",1455148800,4,601,4.265486725663717

3914876,2,B002E01LQ6,"OH Dear......that was an awful movie,  kinda.  Mostly.  The ""science""  was possibly the worst I've ever seen.  I give it 2 stars just because it was almost worth sitting through the whole thing just to watch the close-ups of ...uh  Kestridge...Prettiest woman I've seen in a long time, hopefully she'll get parts in other movies.  She seems like a good actress.
I was mildly amused that ""Grandpa""  was played by the actor who played Zefram Cochrane  in Star Trek.  He did do a good job in this movie too, kinda.

3914880,2,B002E01LQ6,Interesting enough premise -- the moon suffers the impact of a magnetic meteor that begins pulling it toward earth and playing havoc with localized gravity. Too bad the writer had a lobotomy after coming up with it. SAVE YOUR DOUGH!,1441238400,,232,4.825
3914881,1,B002E01LQ6,The worst movie I've ever purchased. This movie is disrespectful to the entire genre of Sci-Fi. At the time you could only purchase so renting wasn't an option also the reviews were fair so I took a chance but it was a major regret.,1439424000,,232,4.295454545454546
3914882,3,B002E01LQ6,"Ok. Pretty ridiculous screenplay. Gravity disappears in small areas, special effects are not up to modern standards, but on a rainy day,  not horrible.

Roland discovers that a brown dwarf actually embedded itself in the moon and is causing gravitational anomalies.  With 36 days and counting until the moon impacts earth, Kittner's invention of an anti-gravity device must be delivered to the fissure in the moon.  Everyone's performance is smack on!

3914966,4,B002E01LQ6,"I'm not much of a science guy so I appreciate this mini-series' stab at explaining the tricky stuff in a way that even a layman like me can take in. It's too bad then that, according to my science nerd pals, the film dishes out quite a bit of astronomical hooey. IMPACT is a two-part television mini-series that aired on ABC in 2009. I guess it's a well-executed disaster flick if only you can temper your jonesing for scientific accuracy. For some, that's a big if.

Astronomers are proclaiming it the greatest meteor shower in nearly ten thousand years. It's a momentous event being witnessed first-hand by star-gazers all across the globe (and you see the flaw in that statement, right?). In an observatory in New Mexico, scientist Maddie Rhodes (Natasha Henstridge) alarmingly observes an asteroid that had been hidden until now, of which diameter measures 19 kilometers, twice the size of the meteor that supposedly killed off the dinosaurs. To the star-gazers' disbelief, this asteroid blasts into the moon, throwing it out of orbit and into a collision course with *gulp* Earth.

As the moon looms ever closer, we note the immediate repercussions: compasses thrown out of whack, cell phone disruptions, massive electrical discharges, temporary loss of gravity... An emergency think tank is assembled, comprised primarily of Maddie Rhodes, widower and former NASA astrophysicist Alex Kittner (David James Elliott), and German scientist and leading moon expert Roland Emerson (Benjamin Sadler).

The team concludes that the asteroid that had slammed and then lodged a piece of itself into the moon is a fragment of a brown dwarf (a.k.a. a dead star). As such, that lodged piece bears a mass weighing twelve sextillion tons, rendering the moon suddenly twice as heavy as Earth. Professor Kittner gets on the whiteboard and explains why the moon's now assumed an elliptical orbit around Earth, at which point my science pals started cracking up. Apparently, something with enough force and energy to propel the moon out of orbit would obliterate or seriously damage the moon upon impact.

""Do you think the man in the moon is okay?"" asks Kittner's earnest young daughter. She's part of the required soap opera that courses thru these disaster flicks. And, actually, the two young actors (Natasha Calis, Owen Best) playing the Kittner kids are engaging and don't get much in the way of the core narrative. James Cromwell has a choice supporting bit as Kittner's reclusive father-in-law. Colin Cunningham (from FALLING SKIES) is pretty good at playing dirt bags and it's the same-old, same-old here as his part calls for a shady, down-on-his-luck reporter intent on landing the scoop of a lifetime, no matter the fallout. Meanwhile, the fairly distracted moon expert may have to put his impending nuptials on hold. The apocalypse tends to screw up all sorts of plans. So, yeah, the human drama angle is well covered.

Keeping in mind that this is a made-for-television affair, the special effects hold up okay. I do like the fantasy element of them cars and trains soaring weightless thru air. In the end run, I think IMPACT is pretty entertaining. I guess the eggheads'll have a field day channeling Crow T. Robot and Tom Servo and dissing the supposedly poor application of science. But give the mini-series some credit. At least when it was time to launch a team to space on a last ditch mission to avert the end of everything, there isn't an oil rigger in sight. 3.5 out of 5 stars for IMPACT, on the strength of the never-gets-old doomsday premise and a good cast and how the movie manages to be both cheesy AND massively entertaining and that I like watching David James Elliott do his acting thing.",1379203200,,3706,4.942215088282504

This one fits the bill fairly well. It was originally a TV mini-series, so it is split into two 3-hour parts. The first part details how a meteor hits the moon and how it is discovered to be a fragment of a brown dwarf which implies certain dangers. The first part has some decent interaction between characters as well as evenly-spaced disaster scenes. Most of the action takes place in the US and Germany. The second half deals with attempts to devise a plan to deal with the impending disaster. It involves the required military attempt to go against scientists and blow things up which fails followed by a just-in-time heroic rescue by the scientists. The effects are passable, but obviously somewhat low-budget and in places, cheesy. The characters and their adventures are fairly standard for a movie like this with the usual suspects dying, the usual heroes saving the day and getting the girl and the usual bad guys having a change of heart. All in all, there isn't a whole lot new here other than perhaps a novel, albeit unrealistic disaster scenario. Still, the movie managed to keep my attention and keep me thinking.

The movie is suitable for the family and has some tender moments as well as some interesting special effects.

All told it was worth the time it took to watch and deserves its four stars rating in my opinion.

3915005,3,B002E01LQ6,"As far as disaster flicks go, this one didn't go far enough.  It was virtually a one trick show with the ""weightlessness"" providing the only wow factor.  Unfortunately, they kept dragging it out every time the plot began to stall.  Literally, if you've seen it once, you've seen it a hundred times.
There was a pall of half-heartedness over the entire production.  Whereas others in this genre go overboard by fabricating a heightened sense of urgency, Impact crawled along as if it had all the time in the world.  Someone had their finger on the snooze button and didn't let up.
It started with a tentative non-debate of religion over data, data trumping everything (according to Natasha Henstridge's character).  From that point on it tiptoed its way through 190 minutes of: anomalies, geese flying in the wrong direction, compasses that wouldn't work, tides running amuck, the ever popular cell phone interference, the dead wife syndrome, the ex-husband from hell, and the world's worse grandfather.  Considering everything they tossed into the mix, there were more than enough sob stories to go around.  Unfortunately, none of them had much to do with the matter at hand.  Naturally, the military had their own agenda, as did political sycophants surrounding the President.  This too is typical of this genre.
But the greatest hindrance to this bloated film/miniseries was the actor David James Elliott, playing Alex Kittner, the one with the bright idea to save the world.  I've never seen a more blas performance, given the circumstances of impending DOOM.  Robotic, is the kindest description I could apply to his unreasonably dull appearance in a pivotal role.  His tone of voice, his lack of expression, all rarely changed throughout the course of this epic.  He was given the opportunity to display some type of emotion, twice, and both times he couldn't be bothered to summon up even a cursory example to fit the occasions.  For a second I thought he had something but no, it was just the way they lit him.  He posed more than he performed.  Even the children playing his offspring were more credible than he was.  It was as if he knew this wasn't going to amount to much so he didn't bother to try.

Cliches bounced around like superballs at a superball convention, and the effects whenever they showed the moon were exceptionally hokey...like the painted backdrops on Hee-Haw or something.  That said, if you can get it free at the library and (like me)...it's worth a watch.

It was not only interesting and obviously researched from, and in more time than it takes to thumb through your son's third-grade science textbook, it was exciting, and actually BELIEVABLE!! Most action or science-fiction movies resort to simplistic or ridiculous plot contrivances to get their characters out of--or into--difficult situations. They abuse artistic license or take lazy shortcuts that make deus ex machina seem like a math theorem.

IMPACT was obviously written by someone of intelligence who, if he or she doesn't have a science background, had the integrity and drive to research this premise to a high degree--of satisfaction--for this film nut!! Watch it, please. If you share any of my thirst for considering all the possibilities that are 'out there', then enjoy this little diamond in the rough, as my grandmother used to say...",1266192000,2,1873,4.635542168674699
3915014,1,B002E01LQ6,"Although I wanted to keep an open mind, I write this with a bias against made-for-primetime miniseries based on disaster scenarios. First of all, the plots often have too many protagonists with cookie cutter personalities. The TV producers usually focus attention on a love story, a parent trying to rescue his or her offspring, some kids who have to watch a grandparent die, and of course, the U.S. President is the one person people turn to for morale. They also feature one or more good-looking scientists with no personal lives whose only motivation is altruism for the human race. Impact is all this, and worse. The sole antagonist, other than the rogue Moon, is a paranoid gas station manager who insists on protecting his own property in a world that is destined to end in 37 days - and withholding Aspirin from an old person dying of a heart attack.

Where is the religious community in all this? Where is the theological wrestling that would naturally occur in a deeply religious country like the United States of America? Where are the highway robbers, the criminal element that usually appears during any major humanitarian crisis? In a real end of the world crisis there would be total anarchy. No one would be falling in love or changing their religious beliefs. Thirty-seven days is hardly enough for the average person to reflect on the death of a loved one.

Not only that, but the average TV producer's understanding of physics is deplorable. The writers of ""Impact"" do no better than the people who served us ""Armageddon"" or ""Asteroid"". I count all the following mistakes:

1. The object that strikes the Moon, given its appearance and description as a ""dead star"" would properly be referred to as a black dwarf. But there are no black dwarves in the Universe. Why? Stars are big and hot, and they take a long time to cool even after they run out of fuel.
2. White dwarves emit enough radiation to have destroyed all life on earth long before the Moon got struck. They are also about the size of Earth.
3. Ignoring that fact, an object massive enough to have twice the gravity of the Earth impacting the Moon at normal collision speed for objects falling toward the Sun at 1 AU would not crack the Moon upon impact. It would have cracked the Moon before impact due to tidal forces. Then the Moon would have been pulverized, and the white dwarf would have continued on its original trajectory.
4. Ignoring that fact, the object would not settle into Earth orbit. If the Earth and the white dwarf became gravitationally locked the Earth would orbit it, not the other way around.
5. Ignoring that fact, the collision trajectory would not be a perfect spiral.
6. Ignoring that fact, all of the nuclear weapons in the world would not move the Moon a millimeter away from Earth. The military has scientists. They know this. Also, the Partial Test Ban Treaty prohibits the use of nuclear weapons in space.
7. Ignoring that fact, the ""gravitational anomalies"" caused by the white dwarf would not affect certain objects and not others. If it was close enough to lift people off the surface of the Earth, it is likely the surface of the Earth would be lifted with them. In other words, the Earth itself would have been pulled apart by tidal forces.
8. Ignoring that fact, no rocket exists that can launch humans and scientific equipment from Earth and land on a body with twice the Earth's gravity.
9. Ignoring that fact, there is no such thing as a mass driver.
10. Ignoring that fact, a mass driver would not propel the white dwarf into space. It would simply propel itself toward the white dwarf. The Moon's crust is not sturdy enough to withstand the forces required to support an object when that object is causing a body with twice the Earth's gravity to accelerate in its direction.
11. Ignoring that, the energy required to mass drive the white dwarf out into space at a velocity high enough to gravitationally separate it from the Earth-Moon system would vaporize the mass driver within a microsecond of it being turned on.

All of this suggests that the directors funneled money into the special effects team and away from their scientific advisers. Even more likely, they failed to hire such a team, because they knew that the realistic disaster scenarios had already been taken up. So they basically shrank the asteroid from Armageddon, gave it a hundred times the mass, threw it at the Moon and spat on Sir Issac Newton's grave. They then added a storyline that any half-brained soap opera producer would have rejected and called it a miniseries.

A better plot would have involved a small select group of individuals leaving the Earth to live on a space station orbiting the Sun or another star. Explore their thoughts on leaving their home planet, their thoughts about humanity after earth, and leave it at that. At least the ending would be unpredictable.

3915015,1,B002E01LQ6,"This miniseries is one more case of a clever sci-fi plot idea wasted by a bad development, with a dull and melodramatic script, and a mediocre acting (particularly the performance of the two main characters is lousy). Furthermore, science fiction is supposed to be based on scientific rigor with a license for logical and credible extrapolation. The scientific adviser for the miniseries must have been sleeping during the whole shooting because the list of violations of scientific laws and basic knowledge is endless.

The following is a short list of the worst inaccuracies or impossibilities: (i) a full moon that is seen simultaneously in Earth's day side (U.S.) and in the night side (Europe); (ii) the moon looks bigger from Earth's surface than from space; (iii) electro-magnetism lifting non-metallic objects; (iv) assuming an anti-gravity effect was possible, cars and people floated but small objects did not; and (v) the lousy handling of the brown dwarf physical properties, which do not follow Newton's nor Keppler's laws.

A small brown dwarf has a mass similar to Jupiter (Jupiter mass is around 320 times that of Earth) and a big one could be 80 times that, so in good faith let's assume that it was just an splinter that hit the Moon. So if this ""dwarf"" splinter has a mass two times that of Earth (consequently its mass will be 12 times that of the Moon) then: (i) any decent observatory would have detect it approaching because the gravity of such big mass would have affected the orbits of all planets in the Solar System; (ii) the Moon would have been completely smashed on impact and not just cracked; (iii) the Moon's orbit would have completely altered after impact, following more or less the brown dwarf original trajectory and no longer locked to the Earth; and (iv) the Earth's orbit would have been altered too, now becoming a satellite to the Moon + Brown Dwarf system.

As for the special effects their quality is poor even by a TV series standard. SFXs look like late 70s technology: some of the astronaut scenes look like the TV episodes of the original Start Trek series and the low resolution the lunar surface is a shame, I wonder if was actually a painting.

Definitively not recommended.

The acting is not terrible, but not great. The writing is not terrible, but not great either.
In the first half of the film, everybody is put into a position where they have to sacrifice 'everything' to be part of the team that saves the earth.
This provides a certain amount of dramatic potential, but you quickly realize, that by the beginning of the second part of the film, they've written themselves into a corner and that whole theme becomes irrelevant. A film that takes a close look at how people decide to do what they do and how that affects their loved ones would make an interesting drama... but this is not that film.

In all films like this, where the fate of the planet hangs in the balance; the writers have to make choices about what does and does not happen. The writers of this film don't appear to have made good decisions about would happen first and what would happen next. Additionally, the director and the editors did not do a good job selecting the most important or most interesting pieces of the puzzle.

My feeling is this; if you're going to write a drama about people and the choices they make and things that happen to them as a result... you probably don't want to start by blowing up the planet. It's kind of like burying the lead in a newspaper story. Nobody cares about love affairs and bratty kids when the moon is about to strike the earth.",1260316800,,1458,4.396296296296296

Every second of this film is so fatally flawed in every way, and the flaws just build upon themselves at such an exponential rate, that it's obvious within the first 60 seconds that the real disaster in this film is the film itself.  However, for this reason, it succeeds immensely, as a comedy.

On the other side is the science. People that really don't know anything about astronomy, physics, or how all of this works will be more likely to find this movie very enjoyable, but the rest of us are far more likely to cringe at the way science became fantasy in this movie. Up to a point all of us can suspend our disbelief and look beyond the flawed science, but its too hard to ignore the impossibility of the situation as I was watching this play out.

The movie was broken up into two parts. The first part seemed to drag on. Very very slow.

I did the Amazon Unbox for this movie, and the video quality of the first part wasn't so great. What irritated was that the video quality of the second part seemed SIGNIFICANTLY better than the first, and immediately. When I say immediately, I do mean the first few seconds of the second part. I think the second part might have been filmed with better/newer cameras than the first. The video quality of the second part stayed good until the end. Why would the video quality of the second part be so much better than the video quality of first part?

The second part of the movie was just too fast - there seemed to be a lot that could have been added, not that it would have made the movie any better.

I am not a scientist, but I do have a good education, yet I found the ""science"" behind this movie to be extremely flawed.

I am of the opinion that the writers of the movie were more interested in developing the characters than the science. The characters were definitely closer to reality than the science, but that isn't saying much. The only character that came close to being ""real"" is the dude who drove the kids to see their dad. He came very close to abandoning them, yet decided to help them anyways. This character was the exception to the rule, as most people would have left the kids to fend for themselves.

At three hours and ten minutes, this movie was painfully long. I have seen and watched movies of this length before, and found most of them entertaining. This movie was horrible. At the point when the ""first part"" of the movie was over, I really wasn't overly interested in watching the rest. However, I did anyways, thinking the movie might end strong. I was disappointed.

3915029,1,B002E01LQ6,"`Impact' was a 2008 ABC television mini-series that I bought on a lark.

Ready for the rant? Here comes...

Talk about a suspension of disbelief!

This made for TV movie was worse than `Santa Claus Conquers the Martians'! My IQ dropped so low I could speak to my plants as an equal in just the three and a half hours I sat in a semi-vegetative state watching it!

A `heavy asteroid', described as a remnant of a Brown Dwarf, which was then incorrectly described as a remnant of a supernova, strikes the Moon causing a large crack along it's northeastern hemisphere.

But! Because this ""brown dwarf"" remnant (I think they meant a neutron star, but I doubt anyone bothered to consult the science advisor. If they even had one) is made up of superdense matter, it's gravitational pull begins to draw it on a collision course with the earth.

The marginal special effects stopped being so special after not even a nod to reality was given. The sight of cars being lifted into the air by the gravitational force of the now much more massive moon while the surrounding objects sat motionless took my breath away with it's total lack of respect for the audience.

Wooden acting, absolutely unbelievable subplots, and an absurd sense of seriousness made this an intensely painful television experience.

One must wonder if Phil Plait has seen this film, and if so, why hasn't he reviewed it? I suspect either because he's still in a coma, or he's unable to stop laughing long enough to type.

No plot spoilers from me; the movie centers on the events that occur immediately after what is believed to be an asteroid hits the moon (which happens very shortly after the movie starts), the effects it has on the earth, and the efforts of the governments and scientists of the world to set things right... before the world is destroyed.

I am a Sci-Fi and disaster movie junkie, so I likely rated this higher than many movie purists would since there are a lot of scientific faults, implausible events, and has almost every clich&eacute; from just about every other disaster movie.
