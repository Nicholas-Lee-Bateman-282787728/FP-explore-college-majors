8230180,5,B000XXWE30,This is actually a very good DVD. This copy would not play and I tried everything to get it to work. But then I tried skipping the first section and lo and behold the other sections played just fine and I love it!,1519084800,,213,3.9767441860465116
8230181,5,B000XXWE30,Very useful for my Geography and Geology college classes.,1427155200,,57,5.444444444444445
8230182,5,B000XXWE30,"Good explanations, nice graphics, a little complicated in spots and a little redundant in others but overall very nice video",1402099200,,124,5.25
8230183,4,B000XXWE30,This was a good dvd on geological activity. I am glad that I bought it! There is great info on tectonic plates for those interested.,1398988800,2,132,4.32
8230184,3,B000XXWE30,"This is about the first video.

Which is an attempt to explain the history of earth's geology in one hour.  First off, while the video on mapping the planet using spectroscopy (I think that's what the project was doing) was fascinating, it's wasted time when you are trying to cover the earth's geo history.

Then they spend a lot of time on the magnetic field of the Earth.  Again, interesting, but off topic.  Why not cover that in another video?

They totally rush through the fascinating question of how proto-planetary systems form and evolve into solar systems (if I use the correct terms.)  There's a lot of interesting info here.

As is standard in any geo video, they don't even attempt to explain two important processes.  (1) Why did plates start subducting? (2) How was so much continental crust formed?  I can't knock them for this - I am not sure science knows the answers to these questions.

In general, I would prefer a video on this topic stick to a chronological order, and avoid digressing much.  Also, the how the Earth was Made documentary was two hours ( the original documentary, the show was only an hour.)

Anyway, as this is an inexpensive video, if you are really interested in geologic origins, I suggest getting the two hour how the earth was made show as well.  That way you get this material presented a few ways.",1376524800,4,1345,4.620253164556962
8230185,3,B000XXWE30,"I believe in Creation, so this video, although very interesting, is not MY idea of how the earth came to be.  This video strongly supports the ""big bang theory"" and that we came from molecules of gas millions and millions of years ago.  I don't agree with that.  It's ok, it gives a lot of information and pictures.  I would not have purchased this if I had known it is totally anti-creation. This video supports the idea that all forms of life, plus water, wind, air, earth, land...all came to be just by chance.  I don't agree.",1374105600,,529,4.412371134020619
8230186,3,B000XXWE30,A little long for my purposes. I play short videos on motor coaches.  This is too long for the short trips I take.,1354060800,,114,3.9565217391304346
8230187,4,B000XXWE30,"As a science teacher I found this a very worthwhile video.
It covered the topics we needed to cover in a way the students
could ""see"" rather than just picture in their mind. Helped them
better understand the Earth and helped me better ""show"" them",1339718400,5,246,4.488888888888889
8230188,5,B000XXWE30,"This is a wonderful DVD about how our planet is so diverse. There might not be life on our planet if certain conditions did not exist. Our planet took three billion years to get prepared for us and every living thing. What a miracle! This DVD takes the viewer from the very beginnings of our planet, the collision of our moon and the formations of our landforms and oceans.
The photography is spectacular and the kids will really enjoy this.
This DVD will wow you with its beauty.",1284336000,8,480,4.465909090909091
8230189,4,B000XXWE30,There are finally some solid science videos on the market again.  I show this in my 9th grade Earth Science classes.  It is well received.,1284163200,10,138,4.48
