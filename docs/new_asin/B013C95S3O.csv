This is one of those series I can watch that will take me out of a really bad slump, or help me handle my stress. With how this past semester in grad school was, that was a very important thing for me.",1529452800,,285,3.9310344827586206
8727268,5,B013C95S3O,"Decent for this comical series.  Though, seriously, unless you want the artist's book (main reason I purchased this collection)or to visit the tourist attractions with a plush version of the star character, you could do just as well with the DVD, which I also own.",1529452800,,264,4.866666666666666
8727269,5,B013C95S3O,"One of my favorite series. Hilarious plus a real story full of emotion. The art book is amazing as well, containing character drafts and va interviews. It does contain spoilers so wait until you finish the show before flipping through if you haven't seen it yet.",1508716800,2,262,4.717391304347826
8727270,5,B013C95S3O,"Absolutely loved this anime! Just fair warning, the first episode will tug at the heartstrings. Hilarious, heart warming, good pace. And of course great packaging from NIS. Cannot recommend this one enough.",1455321600,6,206,5.46875
