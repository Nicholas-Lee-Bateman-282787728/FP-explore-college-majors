8379724,5,B002SZQC5C,"This item is my very first UK import Region Blu-ray disc (this will not play on Blu-ray players sold in the US; you definitely need a region free Blu-ray player). This is an excellent Blu-ray transfer, crisp and sharp picture with crystal clarity. Whatever source they used for this Blu-ray transfer must have been in excellent condition, most likely original film elements. There is no sign of blemishes anywhere on the film. My warm thanks and congratulations to the people who were involved in the making of this product.

I already owned the US-Released The Avengers The Emma Peel Collection 2-DVD set. The first DVD in that set is Series 4 - this item is the Blu-ray version of that DVD. The upgrade from the DVD format is tremendous. Plus, you get the subtitles which was missing from the DVD format. The audio format is the same, just 2.0 channel audio, so there is no upgrade with respect to the audio aspect. There seems to be tons of extras and bonus features which are also great upgrade from the DVD version, which I believe doesn't have any bonus features. I am still enjoying the episodes so I haven't got around exploring the bonus features yet.

If you love The Avengers and if you have a region free Blu-ray player, you are going to enjoy this immensely. I didn't have a lot of opportunities to wath The Avengers when I was growing up but I am glad I discovered it later. I have huge liking for 60s TV shows, especially the ones with British flair.",1518998400,3,1465,4.545454545454546
8379725,5,B002SZQC5C,"Well, arguably two words but as a precursor to every relationship TV show with a strong female lead and charming male lead - think Lucifer, the Mentalist, among many others in recent years, this is still fun to watch to this day.",1511481600,,229,4.476190476190476

8379727,5,B002SZQC5C,"So far, I listened only the first 6 episodes. but I have good news!
1) This is not only the 1966 season, but these are the COMPLETE 26 episodes with Diana Rigg in B/W for seasons 1965-1966
 2) The sountrack is not MONO but STEREO ( PCM 24 bit)
 3) The quality is simply AMAZING!!!",1499212800,4,280,4.072727272727272
8379728,5,B002SZQC5C,"Another superb high definition restoration for the beloved Avengers, one of the best television series of all time!

This is a 7 disc DVD boxed set in 4 slim cases, very space efficient.
Each case has its own artwork that clearly states every feature on each disc. Discs are simply numbered.
Disc 1 comes with a period publicity insert.
Audio is Mono 2.0 only, no subtitles.
PAL format, Region 2, Black & White, some extras in Color.
Released 2010.
Onscreen menus are great but the arrow cursor is almost the same color as the background, making it hard to see.

I believe this collection, Series 4, includes ALL the B&W Diana Rigg episodes.
This series was a major turning point for The Avengers.
All episodes would be produced with film instead of live recorded videotape from this point on, a tremendous format change.
This was done to make the series more marketable for overseas use, it bypassed PAL to NTSC conversion hassles.
But, The Avengers would suffer from a somewhat Globalist reformulation, making it simpler and more Family Friendly.
British stereotypes became legion, villains were made petty and cartoonish.
Series 1, 2 & 3 are much more intelligent and seriously dramatic with a sarcastic sense of humor.
After watching the old A&E discs for years these are fascinating. The level of quality is a new benchmark for the series but the same can said for all of the other OPTIMUM Studio/Canal restored Avengers releases.
This is THE collection to have for fans, simply unparalleled by any other, as far as I know.
There are Bluray collections available but I don't know if they feature the same level of valuable extras available here.
There are many worthwhile extras including experimental colorized (HOT!) footage of the sexy and banned episode A Touch Of Brimstone, ITN newsreel snippets and a vast encyclopedic stills collection, hundreds of production and publicity photos and more!
I am particularly impressed by the extra, Armchair Theatre - The Hothouse, starring Diana Rigg.
It hasn't been restored unfortunately but is very interesting.
It has a runtime of about 52 minutes in B&W.

It is so wonderful to see these great classic stories looking so new, it really does add another dimension to them.
It's too bad there is no Stereo or 5.1 Audio option.
I think the next step for The Avengers should be a complete colorization for all B&W episodes. I would truly enjoy that option but I am very much enjoying these as they are.

A wonderful release and lovingly restored. I can't imagine a more improved DVD version of this ever.

Absolutely beautiful.

Update 3/4/18:

I now have a 4K TV & a multi region PANASONIC DMP-BDT270 Bluray player and all of the OPTIMUM Studio/Canal restored Avengers DVD releases upscale perfectly!
I can't see any pixelation or ghosting, these discs are Benchmark Quality indeed.
I haven't seen the Bluray editions yet, I would assume they are even better but the DVDs are most impressive and I am very pleased with them.",1495065600,4,2974,4.877227722772277
