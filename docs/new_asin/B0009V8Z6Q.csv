Number 3 sucks, 4 is awesome and now 5 sucks. You got it right in #4, what happened guys? The camera they used were poor quality, the kind used in cheap ""B"" rated movies and half the sound track sucked. The jumping parts where cool and also had some great scenery, but most was boring. I suppose it is slightly better than #3. Just doesn't have the same level of quality as say mountain biking movies like New World Disorder. Just overall disappointing.",1284681600,,629,4.25
