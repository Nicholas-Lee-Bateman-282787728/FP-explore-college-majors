Moguls are not part of newschool anymore- blame FIS. honestly I don't know what you expected, being a newschool movie. Ignorance, lack of thought on your your part? while I'm not here to harrass you, i do think want to defend a milestone video in newschool skiing. this is quite possibly the most influencial video in recent history. the problems you had with this movie is because it is not the skiing your favorite, and its your fault that you didn't see what kind of skiing it was. don't bash such a stellar movie just cause its not your flavor",1101081600,,657,4.39344262295082

7950766,5,B00005QJLF,"Those of you lucky enough to have a copy of ""13"" will find this to be a good companian video.
The best ""extra"" is the director's commentary, but the extra segments don't do much for me.
This is purely a new school video as are most Poor Boyz Productions movies.  A decent soundtrack done music video style with the song/artist listed at the begining of each segment.",1047168000,,366,4.462686567164179
7950767,5,B00005QJLF,"In this movie propaganda you witness some of the worlds best new school skiers in there amzing abilities whether you see there amazing hip jumps or incredible half pipe hits propaganda proves to be the best ski movie this year, and if that isn't enough to persaude you to buy it then hear this, witness JP Auclair complete the first ever 360 degree loop, or jon olsson set the world record with his hip jumps, or JF cussons massive 1/4 pipe hits, and C.R. Johnsons inverted 900 over a 110ft jump possibly the biggest aerial maneuver ever, and watch mike douglas take the new school to the back country, also check out highlights from the world ski invitational and last years x-games. with summer on the way putting a damper on your skiing let propaganda get you back in to the skiing mood.",1021507200,4,790,4.531468531468532
7950768,5,B00005QJLF,"Yes, finally, the one to end all other newschool skiing movies.  Propaganda... you can't have it any better.  All the pro stars/heros are here showing off what they can do.  The Backflip to 270 Rail by Paul Cotter is a scene to be seen.  Poor Boyz Production has done it again!  A great flick with sick tricks!  Best of all, it has a long session of my hero Jon Olsson doing sick gaps and 900 toxic grabs in it.  Best newschool skiing related flick up to date.  Better than Scandalous and Ski Movie 2 : Hight Society IMO.  Buy before it runs out of stock",1011225600,5,554,4.2
