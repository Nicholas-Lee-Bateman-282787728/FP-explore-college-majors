5663397,5,B00BPEJZEM,"I saw this movie yesterday thinking that it would be a very good xmas movie about love and goodwill  and Ho,HoHo, but it turn out to be not what I though it would be. If you think this movie is going to be about good times you are wrong and I have to speak my mind about this movie. If you just lost a love one or if the holidays you are sad missing your love ones do not go and see this movie because you will come out of the movie crying. This movie should have been about friends getting together and having fun during the holidays not finding out that your friend has Cancer and is Dying. I wanted to buy this movie for the holidays next but my mind is changed and I will not buy itbecause I do not fell like watching this movie and then I am crying and my Holiday is bad. So if you are strong and can stand to watch such sorrow then this movie will not get next to you but if you are not strong do not see this movie.",1385510400,3,922,3.8526315789473684
5663398,5,B00BPEJZEM,"I loved this movie.  It was one of the best movies I've seen in a while.  It was funny and heart-warming. I laughed and I cried, then I laughed and cried again. Quentin (Terrence Howard) was hilarious). I thought the first movie was my favorite, but this one just added to it.  I have seen it twice.  This will definitely be in my collection.  Go see it and you haven't already.",1385337600,18,378,4.267605633802817
5663399,4,B00BPEJZEM,"So this fellow had written a fictitious book inspired by events in his own life... When the old group gathered for a wedding, friends questioned how much of that book was really fiction and how much was actual fact. Oops! That was the premise of ""The Best Man"" in 1999. Now we have a sequel which takes place 15 years later. And yes, the plot has thickened ...but those old hurts still haven't gone away.

Our little bunch has never been so witty or so appealing; the dialogue is racy, raunchy and very, very funny (the delighted audience laughed out loud over and over again). Religion unabashedly plays a big part in the plot and it is used with NO irony or derision, so we see successful middle- class families who attend church, pray together, and raise polite well- mannered children who sing religious songs at family gatherings. This is a feel-good movie with a huge principal cast, so I must limit this to just a few.

They are:
  * Taye Diggs (""Baggage Claim"") is Harper, that selfsame author, back on the prowl again in quest of a topic for a new book. Since his first book's middling success, he seems to be in a sophomore slump. (He was The Best Man 15 years ago.)
  * Sanaa Lathan (""The Cleveland Show"") is his wife Robyn, finally due to have a baby (Harper has a low sperm count); problem is, it's breach so she's scheduled for a C-section right after the holidays.
  * Morris Chestnut (""Ladder 49"") is Lance, our Alpha dog: a pro football player, a devoted husband, and a loving father of four (he was the groom 15 years ago). Mr. Chestnut says he doesn't take his shirt off in every film, but I am happy to report that in this one he DOES!
  * Monica Calhoun (Lots of TV) is Mia, Lance's adored wife and mother to his four children. (She was the bride 15 years ago.) In that crucial football game she watches with her youngsters, we see something that resembles a rugby scrum rather than a traditional football play.
  * Terrence Howard (""Prisoners"") is Quentin, a successful but wayward friend who is always in the middle of everything. I have never seen Mr. Howard so funny!
  * Nia Long (""House of Lies"") is an executive with a successful book publishing company. She wants her author to write a biography of a football player who just happens to be a personal friend.

This R-rated outing contains sexual situations (not all the characters are devoted Christians) but stresses the importance of friendship, loyalty and trust. Expect plenty of profanity, lots of anatomical discussions, a girl fight, plus a time to laugh and a time to weep.

All in all, this is a nice emotional workout for everyone; that's why movies are made, isn't it? Kudos to writer/director Malcolm D Lee (""Welcome Home, Roscoe Jenkins""). A happy and enthusiastic screening audience exited the theater Tuesday night. I'll notify my JayFlix.net folks when Amazon releases the DVD.",1385337600,23,2872,4.6351084812623276
5663400,5,B00BPEJZEM,"This movie crossed all racial barriers because everyone would be able to relate to this cast/characters and subject matters.  The chemistry of this cast of characters is so superb they draw you into the emotions of their lives.  We either know people or have family members that are experiencing the same issues as portrayed in this movie.  It's nice to see a group of friends ""really having each others back"".  The love and friendship they share with each other comes across in this movie.  You will laugh and cry and really feel you have lost a true friend.  I loved the original ""The Best Man"" and the love they shared in that movie is still there in this one.  I wish more movies like this one were being made.  I am looking forward to it coming out on DVD.",1385164800,13,761,4.424460431654676
5663401,5,B00BPEJZEM,"This was the BEST holiday movie I've ever seen!!! It captures all of your emotions, very funny, sad and happy.",1384905600,21,110,4.55
5663402,5,B00BPEJZEM,"Bring your tissues ...The ""Best Man Holiday"" was way more than I expected it to be. This is the best movie of the year, in my opinion, but I don't think it's really appropriate for children so don't let the ""Holiday"" part fool you. This is a very underrated cast of actors and actresses because these people have been in the game for a while now, but they still are not as respected as they should be for the superb thespians that they are. All of the original stars from the first movie have returned, and this one was even better than the first. I saw ""The Best Man"" fifteen years ago, and I loved it then, so this sequel was long overdue. Stars include: Taye Diggs (Harper), Terrance Howard (Quentin), Morris Chestnut (Lance), Harold Perrineau, Jr (Julian), Nia Long (Jordan), Regina Hall (Candace), Monica Calhoun (Mia), Sanaa Lathan (Robin), Melissa DeSousa (Shelby), and new cast member Eddie Cibrian (Brian). This movie had a deeper story that was way more serious than the first film. It's about pride, loyalty, family, friendship, and understanding that everyone needs somebody at some point in their lives.

This movie picks right up where the first one left off, and it brings you up to speed about where these characters have been all this time. I thought that was a clever move because it's clear that a lot has happened. Harper and Robin got married, and are expecting their first child, and clearly you can tell there is some tension in their relationship due to fertility problems as well as financial issues. Candance and Julian have gotten married, and they have two daughters, but Candace still can't escape the consequences of her old profession, and it is brought up a lot that she used to be a stripper, but Shelby is also still a major problem for both of them. Shelby is back, and she's now a reality show television star which is a perfect job for Shelby since she's so overdramatic, but she's also divorced with a daughter of her own now. However, while she continues stirring the pot with Candance and Julian she has bigger problems than she realizes. Jordan, the careerwoman, is back, but this time she has a boyfriend who surprises everybody by being just a little bit lighter than what they were expecting. Jordan's strength, as well as her control issues continue to keep her from obtaining happiness, but she soon realizes that she doesn't have it all. Quentin is still single, lewd, crude, and perhaps one of the realest characters ever, but I was pleased to see that he could also be a serious character with a soft side. Terrance Howard MADE this movie for me! Lastly, Lance and Mia are still married, they now have four children, and Lance is still playing pro-football better than ever, but after a while it becomes clear that they needed to get the old crew back together for a reason, and it is shocking.

I absolutely loved the cameos by Anthony Hamilton and Marsha Ambrosius, and if you saw the first film, you'll totally see the significance behind the song they are singing, and if you are familiar with the music you'll love the soundtrack as well because there are great songs from different R&B stars. I can't say enough good things about this movie. This is a must see!",1384819200,90,3216,4.660211267605634

5663438,2,B00BPEJZEM,"This review may have spoilers. I tried to like this movie. Except for Nia Long. The premise seemed good. However, I found it not real. If your friends know you are an author and have written a book wouldn't you try to get ANY copy to read ASAP not during a wedding weekend! This way all the drama would have been dealt with. I know, that is what the movie is all about. There was too many subplots.it could have been great. I do like Morris Chestnut in addition to Nia Long.",1508716800,,474,4.163043478260869

5663443,1,B00BPEJZEM,"The trailer to this movie is very deceptive. This is NOT a joyful holiday feel good movie. It is a very sad and slow moving movie. Lance is angry and somber throughout most of the movie and it gets progressively more sad as the movie unfolds. Quentin brings the only laughter and up beat feel to the movie in the same way that he did in the 1st movie. The acting was good and it was good to see everyone back together again.

5663465,4,B00BPEJZEM,"This movie had everything - an all star cast, great dialogue, and a nicely interwoven plot.  It was even a true sequel in terms of the characters' history with one another.  The acting was stellar, particularly by the women who were so believable that you just wanted things to work out for them.  (Sanaa Lathan was my favorite.)  The only downside was that the movie was somewhat predictable, ie, the fight between the two women, the death that occured for one of the characters, the couple who ended up getting together at the end, but you all of those things occured quite naturally.  Overall, it was a great film, and I'm looking forward to the next one - Best Man Wedding, I think.",1484092800,,686,4.544715447154472

 there is too much profanity in this movie and most of all no one is considering the children. Adult speech should not be spoken in front of children like that. And as for Lance Sullivan he was always swearing but yet lifting up God. people need to know that the Lord is real and you can't get by in life claiming to be something that you're really not. I do admire yes.. That someone decided to bring the Lord into the situation or should I say into the picture but we must always have high regard for him. As one writer said this is not a movie for Christian. I mean Christians can watch this movie but you have to scroll towards the end pass all the foul language and sex talk. Sex talk and foul language should never and I mean never be exploited in front of little children. once you take out the foul language and sex talk the movie is awesomely touching and great. And most of all correct God in the film. if someone is going to be uplifting the Lord.. Then make them A True Believer not just a religious person.",1481500800,,1044,4.2462311557788945

5663588,5,B00BPEJZEM,"This was an outstanding movie. Although it is essentially an all African American cast, the story line is one that anyone can relate to. It delves into the lives of friends and shows the bond that holds them together. There is the career woman who is too busy to let her boyfriend know how much he means to her. The writer with writer's block who is desperate for a great idea that will revive his career. The man who finds out a secret about his wife  and he doesn't know how to deal with it. There is the woman who  marries men for there money and is now a single mother who can't relate to her daughter. There is the one friend who is the joker, never taking anything seriously, but underneath he doesn't miss when his friends are in need. They are all invited to their football star friend's house for Christmas by his wife. Unbeknownst to them, they are brought there to be told news that will shake them to their core and bond them back together. This movie will have you on an emotional roller coaster, laughing one minute and crying the next. It is a funny and poignant movie that examines faith, loyalty, friendship and love.",1457568000,,1134,4.395238095238096

5663602,5,B00BPEJZEM,"A classic comedy-romance-drama film, The Best Man Holiday was far more better than The Best Man, somewhat became more of a Christmas holiday inspirational film. In accordance, to the previous film The Best Man Holiday picks up were it lift off and they used pictures during the introduction to give everyone clarity of what happened over the years. The inspirational parts came from healing old wounds, making time beautiful in the last moments, and sustaining a family of friends while inviting new one's. This film may be one of the greatest African-American films because of the inspiration, comedy and real-life drama it gives. In addition, I love the high definition of the motion picture for they've truly mastered a good picture clarity that looks more natural and the DTS 5.1-HD Master Audio. The actress that they've picked out were very well picked from The Best Man because in current years, Regina Hall, Melissa De Sousa, Monica Calhoun, Na Long, Sanaa Lathan, all still look beautiful.",1455494400,,998,5.054545454545455

Clearly, the screen writer is planning another sequel and this is a big risk.  This sequel had some good moments, but was not as good as the original.  I fear that a 3rd movie will just be worse.  If there is a 3rd movie to be added, I hope that it will be more of a romantic comedy and not tear us apart like this one.",1436659200,,496,4.072164948453608

5663826,4,B00BPEJZEM,"a supremely American movie that no one else could make. Not as good as the Best Man, but enjoyable.

It is about repercussions for past misdeeds. The movie does not take the position that moral objections to something are stupid or ignorant, which is a welcome change from Hollywood's usual position. And the movie accepts that bad things happen in life, but it does not mean that one abandons one's faith. This seems like a lot to get from a comedy, but it's all there.

Two objections - first, extreme vulgarity.  If not for that, it would be a good movie for children. I hope there is a ""clean"" version.  Two, the ending, with Lance delivering the baby is just too much. The actors could barely make their acting credible. At times, they had a hard time keeping a straight face.

Why is Shelby there? No one likes her - except Mia.  And Mia seems to like Shelby because Shelby really needs someone to like her. I know a few women like Mia, really kind women that it makes you feel good to be around.  When Mia tells Shelby, I love you, it seems like just the kind of thing she would say.

The movie is about breaches of trust and how they go into the future and about how we accept our friends despite all their faults and vice versa. And for those of us who find The Best Man one of our favorite movies, its nice to see what happened to those characters.",1415750400,,1358,4.298039215686274

5663944,3,B00BPEJZEM,"The Best Man (1999): College friends reunite for Lance and Mia's wedding.
The Best Man Holiday: These college friends gather at the home of Lance and Mia fifteen years later.

Great Cast: Lance - Morris Chestnut, Mia - Monica Calhoun, Harper - Taye Diggs, Robyn - Sanaa Lathan, Jordan - Nia Long, Julian - Harold Perrineau, Candace - Regina Hall, Quentin - Terrance Howard, Shelby - Melissa De Sousa, Brian - Eddie Cibrian

I heard this was a good movie, so when it aired on HBO I watched (I don't go to the theater as much as I used to and, although I purchase Blu-rays, DVDs and Digital movies from Amazon often, I like to have viewed it first to be sure I want to add it to my collection). The movie trailer looked fun. The movie poster looks fun. I was looking forward to fun. But the movie wasn't as fun to watch as I expected. These friends were dealing with issues that caused quite a bit of drama. And then something came to light that was so disappointing that I kept wondering why the script had to be written this way. I realize this is something that happens in real life, but I didn't see why it had to happen in The Best Man sequel.

I did laugh at times - Quentin was the funniest character - but with what happened along with the brief nudity, brief sex scenes and crude humor... I'm sorry, but The Best Man Holiday wasn't as entertaining as I had hoped. I like the actors, though. Again, great cast.",1404950400,,1416,4.315789473684211

For the sequel to take 15 years in the making, this was not bad at all.  My favorite scene was the air band performance without Shelby's performance.  My heart was glad and at times a little sad.  I enjoyed the evolution of the characters; it was like the audience got to participate in the Christmas festivities with the friends.  This film is about reconciliation, hope, and togetherness (not my three words).  I'm still processing it all.",1404518400,,554,4.829787234042553

5663974,4,B00BPEJZEM,"This is truly a remarkable movie with plenty of laughs, pathos, and more than a bit of sadness.  All of the characters from the 1999 film ""The Best Man,""  are present and each character  has a time to shine in the movie.  Terence Howard is very funny and his character shows the most growth from the 1999 original.  Monica Calhoun is outstanding as the ill Mother of three children and wife to Morris Chestnut.  Several of the characters are going through trials, most of all Taye Diggs character and Sanaa Lathan and Julian (Murch) and wife, Regina Hall.  The movie ends on a positive note but there is truly a very sad part towards the end. There is plenty of cattiness and backbiting between the women and the men and it brings a clarity to their personalities and backgrounds.  Sanaa Lathan who was not in the first movie as much has a much more pivotal role in this one.

It took 14 years for the Director Malcolm D. Lee to make this sequel but I must say that it was well worth the wait and the actors have grown as stars.  What a great ensemble cast.  The music in the movie also wonderful.  I really enjoyed this movie and it is one that I would watch again and again.  A sequel as good as the original.  How amazing!

Watch this movie, recommend it to others and watch it with friends and be prepared to laugh a lot and also to cry.  Try not to hold back the tears let them flow.  Then watch it again.  These women look better in their forties then they did in their twenties and thirties. Also the fashions look spectacular.",1402876800,,1534,4.32280701754386

5663976,5,B00BPEJZEM,I love that you can laugh and cry at the same time.  I wasn't sure how they were gonna paste everything together at first but somehow everything seemed to work out.  The ending could have been a bit different in my opinion but overall hilarious and sappy at the same time!  Kevin Hart is a natural and I usually love all his movies.  This movie somehow does say a lot more about many relationships than we'd like to admit.  New things get boring too.  It's all about sticking it through in the name of love!,1402617600,,507,4.28421052631579

Love is expressed at its pinnacle between the Creator and the Created, between family--a mother to child, a father to child, between husband and wife, seasoned love--the relationships between friends, new love--the relationship between man and woman and the acceptance of new friends; there is love of life, love of the gifts of life, and while there are certainly trials--various storms that initially upset the balance of peace, at the close of the day, the one resounding truth is love--
Love that bares all, endures all, gives all, believes in all, and forgives all--unconditional love.

I thoroughly enjoyed this film.",1400716800,,798,5.037878787878788

You can tell right away that there is something wrong with one of the characters so it has a sad ending.

I loved the story, I think I laughed as much as I cried.  They played people that we could all identify.
I could go on and on but then I would give the story away.
Just watch it!",1398729600,,339,3.6944444444444446

5664035,3,B00BPEJZEM,"I loved the first ""Best Man"". Yeppers, totally loved it. ""Best man's Holiday""  brings everyone back with a few extras thrown in. We do get a little deeper into the friendship and relationships or all involved as we are all brought back together for Christmas, friends and foes alike. I won't say what the reason is but we do get a lot of terrific performances form all concerned but....this got way too serious and I love all these characters too much and want them to have fun.",1398729600,,478,4.494252873563219

5664037,3,B00BPEJZEM,"Best Man Holiday was entertaining,  that's what got it to three stars. I loved how beautiful everyone looked. The locales were lovely to look at as well. But the writing seemed too Hallmark greeting-cardish in that all the multiple plotlines had these pedestrian moral messages and/or themes. The Best Man Holiday wants you to be a better person after viewing it, and like most morality takes it leaned towards melodrama at times while in others it all out preached mini-sermons to you.

Best Man Holiday's greatest asset lies in the friendships between the characters and their humorous banter along with a sense that they really do care about one another; a trait I love to see in films starring Black characters as it still seems underrepresented in mainstream films.",1398470400,,770,4.961240310077519
