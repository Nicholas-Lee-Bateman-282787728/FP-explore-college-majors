8304510,5,B001G9CNMW,"The description of this DVD is a bit misleading. It is a fascinating record of a unique live performance in which the drummer is the ""lead"" instrument. And while I understand a previous reviewer's frustration, the bass playing is not visually interesting. This really is a Terry Bozzio DVD with bass and guitar accompanying.

The same frustrated reviewer mentioned above also voiced his personal opinion about Missing Persons being ""crap"". That is what many critics said about Mozart's music when he was writing it. In fact, Missing Persons was an extraordinarily forward thinking group of world class musicians using that era's brand new technology to create a unique sound that has a cult following to this day. Listen to their song ""Give"" and you will hear Bozzio using electronics like they hadn't been used before.

If you like drums, this DVD is extraordinary.",1499385600,,866,5.048951048951049
8304511,5,B001G9CNMW,"I did not know this DVD existed until I bought it at a Bozzio show. I enjoyed it very much. I had never seen the guitar player before, although he will be performing with UK this weekend in SF. He seemed like a Holdsworth clone, but not so much it bothered me. I can't believe I had never heard Alex before. His playing was quite complex and enjoyable. Bozzio was just going nuts on the drums. This DVD is a great Bozzio performance. I agree that the camera did not show Patrick until the end of the show. I am a fan of Terry and Patrick from the Zappa days, but the Missing Persons stuff they did was crap. It was great to see them playing excellent music. The encores are on the bonus feature. Well worth the money for Bozzio and guitar fusion fans.",1303171200,2,751,4.186206896551724
8304512,2,B001G9CNMW,"I love everything Patrick O'Hearn has recorded since his days on Private Music. So when I saw that he was one of the members of the trio on this performance, I immediately ordered it. Unfortunately, the songs are extended exercises in 70's-style jazz fusion, and they fail to keep the viewer engaged. This disappointment might have been ameliorated by good camera work, but Mr. O'Hearn is completely and inexplicably ignored by the cameras during the entire performance. It's very strange, and I cannot recommend this dvd to any Patrick O'Hearn fans.",1292112000,5,550,5.054945054945055
