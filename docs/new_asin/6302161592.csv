435069,4,6302161592,"This video marks the second meeting of the unmistakable Web-Head and the X-citing X-Men. Much like in thier first meeting, this episode centers around the character Firestar (voiced by former Family Affair star Kathy Garver) and her past with the X-Men. After joining the X-Men, Firestar took a hiatus from her adventures to help an up and coming scientist in his research. Unfortunately one of his experiments went drastically wrong, causing him to become the split-personality cyborg called Cyberiad. He makes the friendly super-hero reunion become a nightmare as he patches into the X-Mansion's security and uses it against the heroes. Fans might like this episode as it also marks the first time Spider-Man trains in the X-Men's Danger Room. Fun and engadging, fans of the superhero genre should not miss out on this adventurous video.",1025827200,9,839,5.176470588235294
435070,5,6302161592,"For fans of the 80s cartoon Spider-Man and his Amazing Friends, this is definately one episode that should not be missed. The television series centered around the Marvel Comics superhero Spider-Man (voiced by Dan Gilvezan) and his two similarly powered roomates Iceman and Firestar. In this video, A Firestar Is Born, we discover the secret origin of the superhero Firestar! Actress Kathy Garver, best known as Cissy from the television series Family Affair, voices the firey superhero who's real name is Angelica Jones. Born a mutant and poor, Angelica was constantly belittled by fellow schoolmates and called 'Angelica Jinx'. When she discovers she has amazing abilities she tries to end the school teasing once and for all. Along the way she even meets and joins the mutant superheroes the X-Men. And if that isn't enough, Spider-Man and pals must also contend with the super strong villain The Juggernaut! This is a really exciting and fun episode and is sure to be favorites of many 'kids' past, present and future.",1024358400,,1022,5.053254437869822

7822271,5,6302161592,"During its 3rd and final season of new episodes on NBC's weekly Saturday morning cartoon-fest over 25 years ago, ""Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends"" presented one of its finest episodes: ""The X-Men Adventure.""  Although designed as a spin-off pilot (which didn't sell) for Marvel Comics' team of mutant heroes, this cartoon is truly a first class Marvel Team-Up.

The inventive plot features the wisecracking Spider-Man accompanying former X-Men members Firestar and Iceman to the Xavier Mansion for fun and games in the Danger Room.  This episode's X-Men are: Cyclops, Colossus, Storm, Nightcrawler, Thunderbird, Kitty Pryde, and Professor X (in their familiar costumes from the 1970's).  Much like the terrific 2nd season episode, ""A Firestar is Born,"" in which the X-Men also prominently guest starred, this storyline again focuses on Firestar.  The episode opens as she is faced with self-doubt after failing an outer space hologram training exercise in the X-Men's Danger Room.  Then, the mysterious villain, Cyberiad, invades the mansion and takes over its sophisticated Cerebro computer system.

From that point on, our heroes must split into teams in a three-way race to the mansion's attic to battle Cyberiad over control of the mansion.  Each of the X-Men receives solid individual moments to shine, as they must dodge Cerebro's elaborate ""death traps.""  Ultimately, it is up to Spider-Man's ingenuity to save his friends from jeopardy, and Firestar's courage in confronting some painfully tragic memories.  All in all, the insightful episode has some surprisingly poignant moments for Firestar fans, as she expresses some emotional depth rarely seen in the era's menagerie of one-dimensional cartoon characters.

Per the recent Disney-Marvel corporate merger, one can only hope it will finally allow this animated Spider-Man and all his amazing friends to receive someday soon the full DVD treatment this animated series truly deserves.

Rating: 9.5/10 (The animation has aged surprisingly well!)",1267488000,3,2008,5.504885993485342
7822272,5,6302161592,"The origin of one of Marvel's most-loved heroines! What's not to love? The video is 22 minutes of fun that involves the telling of Firestar's origin, how she came to join the X-Men and later the Spider-Friends. All this while teaming up with the X-Men in the ""present day"" to stop Juggernaut! Great, vintage cartoon fun!",1126137600,,320,4.732142857142857
7822273,5,6302161592,With the popularity of Spiderman you would think that Disney's Beuna Vista would have some commone sense and release this awesome Saturday Morning Cartoon classic on DVD.  We fans will accept non-other than ALL 24 episodes uncut!,1110499200,10,229,5.1891891891891895
7822274,5,6302161592,"I liked this movie very much, it is so cool. I tnink it was a good idea to put Fire Star in the X-MEN even though she wasn't in the comics. The cast of X-MEN in this are Cyclops,Angel,Storm, and Wolverine. The villian is Juggernaut. In this episode Fire Star tells the story of her origin. I think it is a super, super hero episode. You ought to see it. I lked the part were Angelica gets revenge on Bonnie when she wrecks her doll house. Also when they fight the Juggernaut. I wish it could of been lke that on The Origin of The ICE MAN. I think the X-MEN are better than Spderman. Don't get me wrong I do like Spiderman. I just like X-MEN better. I think that there should of been a longer scene with Magneto and the Sentinal. This has been a great episode, take my advice.",1037318400,3,775,4.105263157894737
7822275,3,6302161592,"I know that this is Spider-Man's series, but ever since Firestar and Iceman teamed with him, the show became a place for a lot of mutant reference. There were also Sunfire, Magneto with the Blob, the Toad and Mastermind from the Brotherhood, and the X-Men themselves. Firestar's origin was told, which showed her dealing with life as an outcast because she was poor (TV couldn't deal with the subject of mutant rascism back then). That rich spoiled brat Bonnie was the catalyst, but Angelica's father always kept her head straight. the scenes where Angelica did a ""Carrie"" when she lost her cool at the high school prom and got her payback when she was framed were great. To keep the action going was the heroes' battle against the unstoppable Juggernaut, but teamwork made Juggy very stoppable. Due to the fact that Spidey was kept mostly in the background, it's truly exciting (and uncut, if you saw the edited versions on UPN and ABC Family recently). I recommend the video ... or I should say ""go for it""!",1028332800,2,1009,4.706214689265536
