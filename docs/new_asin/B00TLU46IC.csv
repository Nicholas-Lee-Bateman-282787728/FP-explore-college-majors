8702219,4,B00TLU46IC,"While it didn't go back into the archives, it still was strong. I felt my head rocking and my foot kicking and thought woah, Mr. Leeb sure knows how to put on a show. The second to last song was amazing. The last 15 minutes or so so were golden. This won't scratch your old time FLA itch, but it will provide a good concert feeling experience. I enjoyed it.",1480291200,,357,4.114285714285714
