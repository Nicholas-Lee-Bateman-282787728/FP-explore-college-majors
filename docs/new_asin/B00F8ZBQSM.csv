5970784,3,B00F8ZBQSM,I see why we have this epidemic of female teachers with male students? Middle age women having hot flashes orgasm spell's and 20's something's male parading around in theirs undies like a ad from Abercrombie Fitch! Wickedly funny.,1431216000,3,230,5.078947368421052

5970786,1,B00F8ZBQSM,"This is about the stupidest, most poorly made movie I have ever seen. From the identical 'tidy whities' that all of the guys have on to the cheap-o (and I DO mean CHEAP-O) wood masquerading as expensive woodwork on down to the FAKE orgasmic pleasure these three 'cougars' get from watching their evil, papier machete clown do their evil bidding, this movie SUCKS to the core. It looks like the costumer bought a 6-pack of cheap knitted boxer-briefs and divied out one pair to each of the male cast members; and I do mean identical -- every one had the same pair of non-descript, white, no-character undies on -- no color, nothing distinctive anywhere except their over sized (probably stuffed) package areas. Even the kitchen cabinetry in the ""made to look like an expensive kitchen"" was so nicked up and scratched up, but refinished enough in an  attempt to make it look like new. Guess again; it looked like it came from the house remodeling dump pile next door. Now, on to the acting, AWFUL can't even hope to ever come close to covering this. All I can say is it was good for a laugh as a free replay on an obscure cable channel, but by no means waste a cent on purchasing this less-than-D-grade croaker. What a total waste of anything even remotely resembling film making.",1414108800,,1277,4.600877192982456
5970787,1,B00F8ZBQSM,"Even though they are older I thought I'd see some of these hot cougars, especially Lisa London, nekkid.  Good grief, 99% of this movie is guys in their underwear showering, etc.  Bleccch!  If you swing that way, that's fine.  But, I really was hoping for some nekkid women....shoot, I'd take ONE.",1392422400,5,296,4.745098039215686
5970788,1,B00F8ZBQSM,We just started viewing Amazon Prime Movies and were surprised and disappointed the first film was such poor-quality.  The online Amazon rating of 3.5 - 4 stars was way off-base for this amateur and pointless production.,1390694400,,220,5.111111111111111
5970789,4,B00F8ZBQSM,"The newest film from director David DeCoteau has something for everyone.  A trio of actresses with cult followings: Kristine DeBell (1976's Alice In Wonderland, Meatballs, TAG:The Assassination Game), Helene Udy (1981's My Bloody Valentine, Pick-Up Summer) and Lisa London (H.O.T.S., Private Resort).  A slew of hardbodied young men in nothing but their underwear.  And a hideous little doll who's handy with a blade.

Former sorority sisters - who practiced witchcraft back in the day - reunite when Donna's (Udy) daughter is killed after being taunted by a fraternity.  Donna wants revenge - Tina (London) is all about it, she's ready to use dark magic to have the responsible frat guys killed off.  But Lana (DeBell) isn't so sure it's a good idea.  Next, we're introduced to an amazing fraternity house - well, more like a mansion - where the guys are all about working out, taking showers and napping in their briefs.  Of course, they're not a very smart bunch, and the witches' spell has unleashed a vengeful little doll that has no trouble stalking the young hunks.  Lana wants to put a stop to the madness, but before she can, there's a nice little plot twist that endangers them all.

For movie fans who grew up with gals like DeBell, Udy & London, it's a treat seeing these ladies back in action.  DeCoteau has great taste in casting genre faves in his movies - he's also featured Donna Wilkes (Angel, Jaws 2), Darcy DeMoss (Can't Buy Me Love, Friday The 13th Part VI:Jason Lives) and Monique Parent (Playtime, Dark Secrets) - in his recent projects.  His male eye candy is, as usual, spot on - there's a scene involving a pizza delivery boy that is very funny and sexy.

Those looking for a ""serious"" horror/revenge flick should know better - but fans of the director and the cast should definitely add 3 Wicked Witches to their Amazon cart or their instant video queue!",1389916800,4,1881,4.768518518518518
5970790,1,B00F8ZBQSM,Didn't like it. Poor acting and looked like a low budget movie.,1472428800,,63,4.333333333333333
5970791,3,B00F8ZBQSM,All the movies in this series appear to have the same slow moving sequences and plot. Only good for seeing well-built guys in a movie.,1469145600,,134,4.4

(soft ...Really Soft core gay porn with milf in it ) ?????
KINDA CUTE MANBOY BUTT and lotsa BAD acting",1464998400,,138,3.6333333333333333
5970793,1,B00F8ZBQSM,"Not worth buying or streaming if it is not free, or worth seeing to end. A waste of a good story.",1463788800,,97,3.6666666666666665
5970794,1,B00F8ZBQSM,Not that good.,1463529600,,14,4.0
5970795,1,B00F8ZBQSM,"the cover does a total disservice to this film... If I could give it a negative star it would gt 10! the acting was complete crap. All the actresses where annoyingly bad at the simple job of acting. It was more like they were literally at home afraid of getting into character cause the UPS delivery man might come and interrupt the process. Someone mentioned it looking like these ""middle aged actresses where having hot-flashes"" in front of the young, underwear flaunting lift crew.

I was extremely annoying by the whinny, bipolar skinny blonde woman who was eager for revenge, yet she'd have her ecstatic laughing spells like she'd forgotten the daughters dead... which is why they release the demon that takes charge of the creepy harley quinn doll they had to deface for copyright purposes. Otherwise, they would of probably had to pay the designer.",1463356800,,855,4.8561643835616435
5970796,1,B00F8ZBQSM,"Stupid, if you are going for a skin flick catered to women and gay men. You have to show some dong and but. You may ask why am I looking for skin in the movie, its because the acting is horrible and the script is horrible on top of that and there nothing but scenes of men in the same pair of underwear throughout the movie. You only see this combo typically in good porns!!!",1462838400,2,375,4.013333333333334
5970797,1,B00F8ZBQSM,"Horrible. Old bags with cheezy special effects magic, and dudes in their underwear. Basically homo erotica. Not that there's anything wrong with that.",1462752000,,150,5.565217391304348

5970799,1,B00F8ZBQSM,This was by far the worse movie I've seen to date.  A bunch of guys running around in undies getting killed.  There was no acting at all. Cameras more concerned with male attributes then anything else...,1461628800,,203,4.611111111111111
8613203,3,B00F8ZBQSM,"better than most of mr. d's special group of 'walker' films. this one had a special punch....in spots.  the 3 wicked witches did not put a spell on me...
unless it was a sleeping spell.  years ago they didn't have to know how to act as that wasn't their specialty.  those days are gone.  today they have to act a little.  I take that back.  we do get little.",1513641600,,358,4.115942028985507

8613205,1,B00F8ZBQSM,"And a very POOR one.  It spends a copious amount of time on young men in underwear, often in water.  S L O W, dumb,and predictable.  Not worth the time.",1482710400,,152,4.0
8613206,1,B00F8ZBQSM,"I only gave it one star because there is no option to give it zero stars.  In my lifetime I have only stopped watching a movie twice--this was one.  And it didn't take long to give it up. The actresses would not have been able to get a part in a low life porn movie, which I am given to  understand requires no talent or skill other the commodity of being female. It wasn't highly rated, but I figured how bad could it be? The answer was AWFUL.",1476921600,,444,4.0227272727272725

8613210,1,B00F8ZBQSM,if I could have given it a zero stars I would have.  this is like the 1313 movies.  guys in tighty whites that don't fit properly.  story line sucked. they tried to use a clown doll like the puppet master movies.  they failed.  some sense where the doll stabbed with the knife you could see the rubber knife bend.,1474848000,2,313,4.237288135593221
