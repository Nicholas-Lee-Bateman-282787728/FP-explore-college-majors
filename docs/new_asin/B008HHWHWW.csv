8528176,5,B008HHWHWW,"So much fun for a disco workout. Takes some time to learn the moves but in a good way -- so it doesn't get boring. Good for beginners to intermediate as far as exertion. Music is the original version, with several disco classics, but not all songs have lyrics. Some are just disco instrumentals (non vocal).",1425600000,2,307,4.5
