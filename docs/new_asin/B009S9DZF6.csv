Not many special effects if any, the power of the story as told through the talent of the actors combined with some great musical scores.

Even if you're a young person, there are lessons to be learned by watching these vintage flicks of yesterday.
Great thing is you can watch them on your time in your home.",1378512000,,591,4.472222222222222
