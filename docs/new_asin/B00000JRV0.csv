7913314,3,B00000JRV0,"This is the first volume of a five volume instructional video series titled Nihon Jujutsu by Norm Belsterling, a retired police officer who has applied his knowledge of Jujutsu in the line of duty.  Norm Belsterling has over 30 years of experience in the martial arts and has trained with well known martial artists as Fumio Demura, Dan Ivan, and Shizuya Sato.

The video starts out demonstrating basic warm up and stretching exercises to be done before practicing any martial art as well as basic jujutsu footwork and falling techniques for about the first eleven minutes.

This first volume of Nihon Jujutsu is subtitled, ""Joint Locks and Submissions.""  It should be called ""Transitions from one joint lock or submission to another.""  Norm Belsterling calls the viewer's attention to a particular joint lock or submission by mentioning its name before demonstrating it.  However, he actually performs a series of  2 or 3 joint locks or submissions out which the one he named is just one in the series that he performs as he makes transitions from one to another with smooth continuity of moves.  These smooth transitions from one hold to another are impressive means for a master to show off.  It does demonstrate a high level of skill to perform even with a rehearsed choreographed sequence and a cooperating partner.  But, it will be probably next to impossible and definitely and foolishly impractical to attempt such transitions once engaged in a real fight.  In a real fight you would want to take down your opponent and force him into submission quickly as possible with as little superfluous movement as possible.

Transitioning from one joint lock or submission to another is requires at least an intermediate level to advanced level skill.  If you don't already know the joint locks and submission holds demonstrated in this video volume, this volume is not going to help you learn them because there is not a lot explanation.  While there are a few slow motion demonstrations of the moves Norm is performing, a beginner is going to get lost by the time Norm makes his 2nd transitional move.  The rest of Norm's performance will flash past the beginning level jujutsu student's eyes without leaving a sign of comprehension about what just happened.

If you are an intermediate level student and already know a good number of joint locks and submission holds, you might want to buy this video to watch how Norm performs transitions from one hold to another.  Otherwise, if you are a beginner, then I would suggest that you start with Wally Jay's ""Small Circle Jujitsu"" video series instead because Wally Jay takes the time to explain everything before or as he demonstrates each move so you will learn something if you listen and pay attention.  Also, if you are a beginner, you can also buy the books ""Small Circle Jujitsu"" or Willy Lin's ""Chinese Grappling T'ien Shan P'ai Chin-Na: The Grappling Art of Self Defense, Volumes 1 and/or 2"" here on Amazon for a fraction what they cost elsewhere.  Those sources will give a good number of Joint locks and holds to learn for beginners.  After you have done that come back and look at this one again.

This video is just over 45 minutes long.

This video is still available on DVD here on Amazon.",1148256000,,3252,4.832129963898917

7913316,5,B00000JRV0,"Probably the best bartending video I have ever seen!  I have seen a lot of these videos because I am a mixing instructor.  I teach exactly what is taught in the video, but I do emphasize more on the hospitality side.  But, this product is the best deal for someone who can commit to 3 to 5 viewings and taking notes.  It is concise, accurate, and well produced.  I highly suggest buying this video if you need to get into the business fast!",1015027200,4,440,4.253012048192771
7913317,5,B00000JRV0,"This is a great video. It shows you the basics of Ninjutsu, such as, the breathing techniques, movements (e.g. Ninja side move), different sitting positions and main exercises with which you may start practicing this great martial art. In my opinion this is the best source for people who really want to start learning martial arts (Ninjutsu or not) and who want to start practicing at home. After completing this course you may consider yourself ready for harder experience, such as Volume 2.",984441600,2,493,4.951807228915663
7913318,2,B00000JRV0,"DARK ROMANCES VOL 1:BORN EVIL, is a movie that probibally could have been more if it had had a bigger budget.  For an independant film, it is good, but it is not for all tastes.  The film's first problem is that it's  stories are way too long.  By the time you get to the end of THE BLACK VEIL  (75-minutes), you really won't care anymore.  The other problem with this  story is that it is filmed completely in close-up, and the images change so  quickly and frequently the thing will drive you insane!  The other problem  with this story is that it is a period piece, and, with the budget these  people have, it is not convincing at all (hence the close-ups and clips  from other films).  LISTEN TO MIDNIGHT is much more entertaining, but  it doesn't make any sense!  At least it's only 25 minutes!  While the  acting and effects in the film are all first rate, it's real problem is  that it is too ambitious for it's budget, and with a bit more money, the  creaters probibally could have made a much better film.  Be sure to  get VOL. 2:BLEEDING HEARTS, it's much more entertaining!  In one  final note, the packaging of the film also claims that it is 140 minutes,  but it is only 100 (the same applies to VOL. 2).  In summary, this is  perfectly adequate, though by no means great cinema.",963878400,3,1292,4.36864406779661
