2590495,4,B000FUWFIU,"Awesome! For those who love riding mtb, this video is a must! Incredible stunts, amazing places and a very technical video making and great sound tracks. Could be a little longer, but it worth every penny!!",1197849600,,206,4.75
2590496,5,B000FUWFIU,"I have this DVD in both regular and Director's cut. After watching the DC, the subtle things really come out in the movie to make it amazing. Its super laid back and more about ""flowing"" on some of the most scenic lines ever to be filmed than the hardcore, brash scenes of other films. Awesome cinematography, great music, great riders, and interesting for the long-time riders and even those new to the sport (and lifestyle!)",1197244800,,426,4.693333333333333
2590497,4,B000FUWFIU,"I purchased this video for my son, Scott, who's an enthusiast for mountain biking. Although this was the same one that my son had purchased at an earlier date he found this video had even more in it than his first. He was very excited and glad that he had decided to keep it because I was ready to return it.

2590498,5,B000FUWFIU,The music is great as are the locations and the way they captured the action.  Really well done & enjoyable.  Nothing is too long so it doesn't get boring but still leaves you wanting for more and just itching to get on your bike & ride!  I thoroughly enjoyed watching these guys rip up the trails.  Amazing riders...,1187568000,,317,4.413793103448276
2590499,5,B000FUWFIU,"This movie is awesome, features alot of the places that you would dream of going biking at.  Moab, whistle, north shore, awesome video recommend it to everyone that is a mountain biking, it will get you pumped to go out there and tear up the trails.",1181865600,,249,4.413043478260869
2590500,5,B000FUWFIU,I am a soldier that is deployed to the Middle East and I have purchased several different mountain bike movies during the deployment to help me remember what its like to ride and stuff that I would like to learn to do.  This movie is one of the best that I have because it reminds me about just going riding with friends and having a good time.  I would suggest this to anyone who loves to go for a ride now and then.,1171843200,10,417,4.0120481927710845
2590501,5,B000FUWFIU,"This movie just has a great vibe to it. Audio wise this is a kinder gentler MTB video. The music is not as kranked-up(No pun intended) as some of the other MTB movies and fits perfectly with the riding and locations. Which are both awesome. This movie captures the Fun, Comraderie and Adrenaline of the mountain biking scene very well.",1171411200,6,335,4.6
2590502,3,B000FUWFIU,"I bought this expecting more big huck, Vancouver stuff etc.  The entire movie LOOKS good, but a lot of the riding is nothing special.",1156377600,2,133,4.541666666666667
2590503,5,B000FUWFIU,"ROAM is the second film by The Collective ([...]) and shot entirely in 16mm film. The riding in the film in unbelievable and shot in premier locations like Whistler, Moab and Morrocco. Lots of great singletrack, downhill, dirt jumping, and a little freestyle action with Ryan Leech.

The filmmakers did a great job piecing the segments together and choosing a soundtrack that flows well with the film. The movie is only 40 minutes, but the extended bonus features make up for it. I like the ""shop loop"" feature in the bonus section, I just leave the movie on for hours looping over and over.

This is a great movie to watch before your next session, epic ride, or just to leave looping endlessly.

Buy it. Now. You'll love it.",1152576000,7,726,4.612403100775194

2590558,5,B000FUWFIU,"Great vid.  Clean cut, smooth freeride videos are hard to come by nowadays.  The art just isn't there, and it's all cookie-cutter BS.  I've watched it a few times already, and it makes me want to ride every time I watch it.",1431734400,,223,4.261904761904762
2590559,4,B000FUWFIU,"Good video, but the title seemed like it would be the adventures of a couple /few riders going to different places.  It was more videos of different people in their home areas riding.  The videos are great, the stunts these guys do on their unpowered motorcycles (cuz really, are they mountain bikes anymore?  Those things are amazing and expen$ive)  There was a bit of  adventure stuff in Marakesh, yes.  Overall it was a good video.  Watch it.",1430006400,,445,4.701298701298701
2590560,2,B000FUWFIU,"Good footage and skilled riders, but the trance-like soundtrack and the Zen narrator are at odds with the behavior displayed.  The footage of the riders completely off-trail in Moab was particularly galling.  These goons are the ones getting trails closed and giving the rest of us a bad name.

Ride responsibly.",1429142400,,312,5.078431372549019
2590561,4,B000FUWFIU,My son said its a montage not a documentary.  Whatever it is its visually stunning and exciting.  Lots of incredible riding.,1428710400,,124,4.857142857142857

2590593,4,B000FUWFIU,"Good movie, but not as good as ""Where the Trail Ends""  available on Netflix. I liked it, but there was too much slo-mo footage that it kind of got me a tad bored mid way through. Great riders and some great scenery, however.",1417305600,,224,4.209302325581396
2590594,4,B000FUWFIU,"Awesome. Great bike skills, awesome landscape backdrops.",1417305600,,56,7.142857142857143
2590595,5,B000FUWFIU,Pretty amazing what these guys can do on their bikes!,1415577600,,53,4.4
2590596,2,B000FUWFIU,A little too heavy on the hike and bike free ride for me.  I tend to appreciate the longer segments of mixed riding inclusive of singletrack.,1412121600,,141,4.423076923076923
2590597,5,B000FUWFIU,Great shots and a nice soundtrack blended with just the right amount of commentary.  Its hard to take your eyes off the changing scenery and all the amazing things these guys do on their bikes.,1409529600,,193,4.514285714285714
2590598,5,B000FUWFIU,Killer movie,1409011200,,12,5.5
2590650,3,B000FUWFIU,"The bicycle feats in this film are incredible but after awhile, they become redundant.  I thought there would be more of a story with it like how the boys got involved and how the sport has changed, etc.",1403654400,,203,4.342105263157895
2590651,5,B000FUWFIU,"Great Film. Great Cinematography. Great Talent. This film is the one that changed the way mountain bike films are made. Perfect  blend of art, bikes and scenery",1400284800,,160,4.925925925925926
2590652,2,B000FUWFIU,"One where I can get paid to ride my bike and have people film me.

Plot?

Documentary?

Neither.  Wow...more dirt jumping.  Big deal.",1398902400,,133,4.608695652173913
2590653,4,B000FUWFIU,"I gave this as a gift, so I can't comment on the movie.  My Son requested it thought, so he must have heard something about it, that made him wish for it.",1394928000,,154,3.8125
2590654,5,B000FUWFIU,This is a really really good DVD (documentary) for the Mountain Bike world.  It shows several different aspects of the sport and doesn't favor anything exept the bikes and the riders!  Great footage and direction.,1390348800,,213,5.057142857142857
2590655,5,B000FUWFIU,"These guys ride so hard it is shocking.  Totally amazing footage of fearless riding.  Soundtrack is money too, I put this video on at parties and everybody loves it.",1383696000,,165,4.655172413793103
2590656,5,B000FUWFIU,Currently off my bike because of an AC tear. Watching this video is part of the recovery and will be therapy for the next two months.,1382659200,,133,4.153846153846154
2590657,4,B000FUWFIU,"Great video and music, not as good as The Collective, but still and great video to add to your collection",1373328000,,105,4.3
2590658,1,B000FUWFIU,"I have the rest of the Collective films so I knew the quality of film and action would be awesome. However, the DVD was never able to play on any device of mine. After further inspection it looked like the DVD had never been properly written or the dealer was trying to pull a fast one on me by sending a blank disc. Sent it back; we'll see how round two goes.",1369612800,,360,4.013888888888889
2590659,5,B000FUWFIU,Finally a mountain bike movie that catches up to where the snowboard industry was five years before.  It's a good one with lot's a great locations and sick riding.,1368057600,,163,4.620689655172414
2590720,5,B000FUWFIU,"Roam is my favorite Mountain Bike DVD.  The Collective shot this using a number of unique techniques which makes the film stunning.  I have this near the top of my list with movies like Art of Flight, but the production value is not as strong as Art.

Strongly recommend for anyone who loves Mountain Biking.",1365638400,,308,4.5636363636363635
2590721,4,B000FUWFIU,Roam has a decent sound track and some great riding sections. It does lack variety and the footage is a little grainy. When deciding to buy remember that the footage is older but the action shots are well staged and will get you pumped to ride.,1341705600,,244,4.326086956521739
2590722,5,B000FUWFIU,"Love it - has a mix of singletrack, jumps, different scenery, different riders. I do not have a lot of MTB videos but this is one of my favourites - maybe THE favourite.",1335484800,,169,4.151515151515151
2590723,5,B000FUWFIU,"I would give this 6 stars if I could! Nothing else like it, superbly done by everyone involved! Someone gave this 3 stars?!?! They are crazy and/or pretentious because this is unbelievable! Buy this!",1292025600,,199,4.882352941176471
2590724,5,B000FUWFIU,I purchased this movie for my 17 year old boy who is really in to mountain biking. He loved it and has watched it many times over. Great buy. Thanks Amazon.,1276128000,,156,4.064516129032258
2590725,5,B000FUWFIU,"I own and have watched all three of the Collective movies, the Collective, Roam , and Seasons, and love them all.  But I say that Roam is the best of the three movies... it's just a GREAT movie.  BUY THIS VIDEO.. you will watch it over and over, just make sure you ride first otherwise you may want to sit and keep watching it!  These movies re-inspired me to get back into riding after about 10 yrs off the mtn bike.. so I owe them a lot.  Seriously.",1244851200,,451,4.090909090909091
2590726,4,B000FUWFIU,"""Roam. The Collective 2"" covers so many different styles of mountain biking as well as so many different mountains. Lots of good action. The filming is awesome in this film.",1241913600,,173,4.8
2590727,5,B000FUWFIU,"I haven't seen a lot of mountain biking videos before this. I just wanted to say that the soundtrack and riding in this video are awesome. If you buy this, you won't be dissapointed. I must have watched it 30 times already with the sound up loud every time. Just great camera work, great tricks, and great music. You won't be dissapointed.",1229644800,,339,4.483870967741935
2590728,5,B000FUWFIU,"I've got a couple of different mountain bike DVDs in my collection, but this is by far my favorite. The video crew put a lot of effort into getting a great shot with some beautiful color of the NW coast. Highly recommend!",1228780800,,221,4.285714285714286
2590729,4,B000FUWFIU,It's a great video.  It feels a touch short and I wish they would have spent less time showing jumps and more time showing trail stuff in cool places.,1215302400,,150,4.172413793103448

8126910,3,B000FUWFIU,"It was a good documentary, but I don't remember much about it and it has only been a week or so since I watched it.  Entertaining, but not memorable, so I give it a 3.  I enjoy mountain biking and enjoy reading and watching reviews, documentaries etc.  I find that most of these are mostly extreme downhill or X game type productions and they begin to blend all together for me into the same theme.  This is something that would be fun to watch with some friends into the same thing.  Individually I loose interest in a mater of 15 minutes.",1453593600,,540,4.306930693069307
