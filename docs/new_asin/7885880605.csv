1158901,5,7885880605,"Am sure that we all are glad that finally TIME/WARNER decided to release this Movie on DVD. Hopefully soon followed by other long neglected films of the 1950th vintage. Like ""THE EGYPTIAN"" and ""VALLEY OF THE KINGS,"" (ALL STILL GATHERING ""STAR DUST,"" ON THE TIME/WARNER FILM LIBRARY VAULT).

The screenplay for this CLASSIC MOVIE was written by no other than the great American literary genius: ""WILLIAM FAULKNER.""

Director Howard Hawks, worked brilliantly on this large scale epic, a gigantic production filmed on location in Egypt, using thousands of extras. This movie plot would take you to the time of the building of the Great pyramid at Giza, for Pharaoh Khufu, this Pharaoh is been played here by Jack Hawkings (who also starred on the epic film ""Ben Hur."")

Also as the Pharaoh's second wife mistress, you can see the sexy newly arrival to Hollywood of ""Joan Collins"" (in one of her first starring roles) long before her ""Dynasty's Persona Character,"" whose insatiable lust-greed, would lead to murder, betrayal and much more on this movie plot.

""Land of the Pharaohs"" is a very entertaining film, which along with the story featuring the saga of an slaved conquered nation, one which is finally allowed to return to their promise land along with their fellow architect, the designer of this ""Seven Wonder of the World,"" after the death of the conquering Pharaoh. All of them set free by a benevolent ""High Priest,"" upon the completion and sealing of the Great Pyramid as this wonderfull film ends.

""Land of the Pharaohs"" with detailed sets, some showing the intrircate complex pyramid's inner labyrinths, booby traped as so no one can learn this Pyramid secrets; along with these film vast desert vistas which so marvelous fill the screen for you, are all very astonishing to the eye in grandeur.

I srongly recomend this film, particularly if it is now finally been released on an ""Anamorphic Widescreen DVD Format"" fully restored for color and sound, in order to preserve the aspect ratio of its original grand theatrical exhibition presentation in Cinemascope.

Am sure that the late Henry Luce (Yale alumnus & founder of ""Time/Life Inc."") would have felt very proud that this long overdue film, written by William Faulkner, would at last see the light of day once more, for all of us collectors of classic movies to own, therefore on account of all this ""Thank you TIME/WARNER.""",1176422400,46,2394,4.9551122194513715
1158902,5,7885880605,"COME ON WARNERS, PLEASE RESTORE AND REMASTER LAND OF THE PHAROAHS FOR OVERDUE DVD RELEASE.

THE LASER DISC WAS VERY BLUE BUT WE THEN AT LEAST HAD A LEGAL WIDESCREEN COPY FOR OUR NOW OUTDATED LASER PLAYERS.

ALSO, AS WITH A STAR IS BORN (1954), PLEASE CARRY OUT A SEARCH FOR THE LOST FOOTAGE EXCISED FROM LAND OF THE PHAROAHS PRIOR TO ORIGINAL RELEASE

IN 1955. TWENTY OR SO MINUTES WERE DELETED FROM THE RELEASE PRINT AND IT WOULD BE WONDERFUL TO SEE THE FULL VERSION FOR THE FIRST TIME.

THERE ARE A LARGE NUMBER OF WE FANS OF FILMS PRODUCED IN OR SET IN EGYPT, AND THOUGH WE ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO THE DVD RELEASE OF 1980'S SPHINX, ANOTHER REVIEWER HAS MENTIONED THE AS-YET-UNAVAILABLE, PROPER STUDIO DVD VERSIONS OF THE EGYPTIAN AND VALLEY OF THE KINGS.

ALL OF THESE FILMS HAVE HUGE FAN BASES SO PLEASE GRANT OUR WISHES FOR THEIR RESURRECTION, RESTORATION AND RELEASE TO THE HOME VIEWING MARKET FOR THEY ARE ALL FILMS THAT INVITE REPEATED VIEWINGS AND NOT JUST A ONCE ONLY VISIT.

1158903,3,7885880605,"The pharaoh (Jack Hawkins) returns home after months in the desert, having fought his fifth war in six years...

During his victorious escapades he has zealously and aggressively accumulated a large quantity of gold... He tells his loyal friend Hamar (Alexis Minotis), the high priest, that he desires two things: a son by his queen, Nailla (Kerima), and a secure tomb where he, and his marvelous treasures will be buried for eternity...

Because he wants the royal tomb to be impregnable, he assigns the slave Vashtar (James Robertson Justice), an arquitect far superior to any Egyptian, to design it... Vashtar agrees to help the pharaoh on the condition that once the pyramid-tomb is constructed, his people will be freed... Only Vashtar, who will know the secret to entering the tomb, will have to die...

With ""one heart"" the people of Ancient Egypt responded to the call of their ""living god"", and came from every town and village to raise for him the immense impressive structure for his second life... They marched to a ""holy labor"" with great faith and great joy... They came singing from every corner of Egypt for the great task...

But the condensed work on the pyramid goes for years... During this time the queen bears the pharaoh a son, and Vashtar's son Senta (Dewey Martin) grows into manhood...

The pharaoh asks every nation to send him a tribute in gold... But Cyprus sends him an attractive young woman named Nellifer (Joan Collins) instead... Although her refusal to obey his commands angers him, she excites him like no one ever has, and becomes his second wife...

While the pharaoh is distracted by the progress on his pyramid, Nellifer carefully set a malicious plan to become heir to his throne and to his enormous treasures... She wins the heart of Treneh (Syney Chaplin), a palace guard, and together they plot to kill the queen...

With a selected group of bald, tongueless priests who allowed themselves to be buried alive, some cowards who get thrown into an alligator pit, and a sultry, dark-haired beauty with the highest ambition, ""Land of the Pharaohs"" is an interesting excursion into Ancient Egypt, basically a macabre melodrama with a final spectacular twist... The engineering details would make a fascinating documentary...",1167782400,4,2263,4.986737400530504
1158904,5,7885880605,I have the VHS version; was ready to buy widescreen DVD. It's not yet been done! This is one film that must be restored properly and Time  Warner needs  to get on with doing this. I'll  buy when it happens.,1165968000,5,206,4.1
1158905,5,7885880605,"Seems strange that this movie is still gathering ""Star Dust"" on 'Time/Warner Film Vault Library' when it carries an screenplay gemstone, written by no other than the great American literary genius: WILLIAM FAULKNER. While sadly now, only poor Korean copies are circulating the internet for the sale of this classic.

I only wish that this film, with some help from us, that by our favorable votes on this review, would let the studio know that we need it now finally released on Anamorphic Widescreen DVD format fully restored, preserving the aspect ratio of its original theatrical exhibition in Cinemascope. Along with the movies ""Samson and Delilah,"" ""The Egyptian"" and ""Valley of the Kings (A Warner Bro. Movie),"" all of which are also classic films been sorrow ignored and neglected by those people in charge, at the Studios Corporate Suites.

But for all of us who love and appreciate classic Hollywood's movies of the 1950th vintage, we fell that it is now time for the Movie Studios Executives and in particular those at ""Time/Warner"" to take time, do please listen to our requests and fully remaster fully restored on DVC copies of all these clasic movies. Ending once and for all this benign neglect to these wonderful feature films of that era.

Director Howard Hawks, worked brilliantly on this large scale epic, a gigantic production filmed on location in Egypt, using thousands of extras. This movie plot takes place during the building of the Great Pyramid at Giza, for Pharaoh Khufu, played here by Jack Hawkings, who also starred on the epic film ""Ben Hur.""

Also as the pharaoh's mistress second wife, which is been played by the sexy ""Joan Collins"" (in one of her first starring roles long before her ""Dynasty's character"") whose insatiable lust and greed, leads to murder, made worth it buying and seen this movie. Which beside all this wonderfull team of Director/Stars, also at the same time, like an extra unique BONUS features the unique screenplay by one of ""America Greatest Intellectuals,"" our fabulous literary genius ""William Faulkner.""

It is a very entertaining film, that along with the story line, feature and shows the saga of an slaved people which finally it is allowed to return to their promise land, with their fellow architect, who designed the 'Seven Wonder of the World,' after the death of the conquering Pharaoh. All of them set free by a benevolent high priest, upon the completion of the Pyramid as this wonderfull film ends.

""The Land Of The Pharaohs"" with detailed sets including the pyramid inner labyrinth, booby traped so no one can learn its secrets, and vast desert vistas fill the screen and astonish the eye.

Am sure that the late Henry Luce, (Yale Alumnus founder of ""Time/Life Inc."") would not have wasted a minute of his time, if he would still be  alive and in charge at ""Time/Warner,"" to see it remastered in all its glory. Am sure that Mr. Luce, would have ordered his workforce the unconditional release on ""DVD Widescreen"" of this classic film; if he would have notice this request/review or just bothered to see it by himself at one of the screening rooms at Warner Bros.

SO LET IT ROLL SKULLS AND BONES. Get back to work guys, and last but not least ""THANKS"" in advance from all of us for doing so.",1162684800,29,3266,4.828264758497316
1158906,4,7885880605,"The format is not full screen.  It is letterboxed widescreen.  None the less, I find that it portrays the people of the time in a more accurate light than the atypical ""slave"" role of so many other movies.  It's easy to see in this movie where Joan Collins developed her ""catty"" side.  Too bad it was not better produced as full screen or anamorphic widescreen.",1144972800,10,361,4.507692307692308
1158907,2,7885880605,"This DVD version is letterbox, but that's about all one can appreciate in this edition. Picture quality doesn't even match the VHS version. Large crowd scenes have characteristic jiggle common to VHS. Focus is not sharp and crisp.

I compared my VHS with the DVD and the VHS actually had better picture quality, albeit pan & scan full-screen.  I would wait for the studio edition of this DVD (if it ever happens.)",1127174400,62,413,4.722222222222222
1159017,4,7885880605,"Before picking on this as a Hollywood type of film, you haven't seen ""The Egyptian"" (1954) and you don't want to see that movie.

This movie is not a Cecil B. DeMille movie. Yet it has that big 1950' epic feel. I was surprised to find that William Faulkner wrote most of it. But this movie is fun to watch and I believe Joan Collins as a seductress that gets what she wants (literally). Jack Hawkins is my idea of a real Pharaoh Khefu. It was very impressive first seen as a child. I love the engineering solution to sealing the passages scenes. They actually made the film in Egypt. I was not too young to overlook the scantily clad Joan Collins.",1501113600,,647,4.30327868852459
1159018,5,7885880605,Why don't they make movies like this anymore.  Everything about this artful work of historical fiction is STUNNING.  (Sidenote:  It's worth it just to look at Joan Collins - you won't believe your eyes).  The scenery is awe-inspiring and if you love imagining Egypt in the era of the Pharoahs do NOT MISS THIS!!  The acting is superb.  The soundtrack is outstanding!!!  The plot line - and esp. the ending - are fantastic.,1499904000,,422,4.698630136986301

1159024,5,7885880605,It's an old time classic.  Joan Collins though her acting is well done the use of the makeup on her was horrible.  She does appear at times she just popped out of the toaster a very unrealistic skin tone.  The movie is mostly focused on the building of a pyramid rather than the players.  Sometimes a bit campy but that is part of it's charm and humor.,1494028800,,352,4.208955223880597

1159103,3,7885880605,"Total cheese fest!  Who knew the ancient Egyptians wore gold lam and chiffon.  And 50's hairstyles. Poor Joan Collins is totally out of her depth but she puts on a steamy show.  Jack Hawkins gives the movie whatever dignity and ballast it has.
The end of the film when the tomb is sealed is great!  Shows how Hawks could still put together a gripping ending.  If only Joan could express panic and despair!  She squeaks!",1479340800,,419,4.52
1159104,4,7885880605,"Pharaoh, obsessed with physical power and financial power in the form of gold, plans for a foolproof tomb to safeguard his body and treasure.  He enlists the genius of an architect of a captured tribe by promising to free all of his people by the time the tomb is completed.  At least 15 years pass, and the tributes required become more burdensome from the neighboring nations.  A princess of Cyprus offers herself in lieu of tribute that is ruining her island.  She becomes his second wife, and is also corrupted by power, as she attempts to destroy both him and the first wife in order to become queen.  Justice comes to all in the end.

The movie spends quite a bit of time showing in an entertaining way how the pyramids were built according to theories of the day.  The melodrama does not get in the way of this, but don't expect a complete soap opera as these spectacles can be.  The captive tribe is essentially our modern point of view on these proceedings personified.",1479168000,,978,4.548571428571429
1159105,5,7885880605,This is the move where Joan Collins learned to be the creepy evil woman. Unfortunately it latched on and she never shook that persona off.,1478217600,,138,4.56
1159106,5,7885880605,"This is an incredibly underrated film, and is a great, intriguing story.  Jack Hawkins masterfully plays the pharaoh whose focus is wealth,power, and the intent to ""take it with him.""  The sweeping grandeur of the film is on the scale of The Ten Commandments, with literally a cast of many thousands.  Watching the emerging treachery of the former slave girl, and her ruthlessness to gain the throne keeps one's attention, and eagerly awaiting the climactic ending is indeed an experience.",1474416000,5,489,5.0875

1159219,5,7885880605,"While I was TDY overseas in the EAD-USAF near Cairo, Egypt, I had the rare opportunity to go to the Museum of Antiquities, tour the Pyramid of Kufu and the nearby ones.  Also, I was able to take a ferry boat down the Nile to the Valley of the Kings, Luxor and saw one of the quarries where stone was taken for the structures.  In addition I had the rare privilege to have studied such construction activities in ancient Egypt before overseas duty there.  There is a lot of ""Hollywood"" drama, but this DVD movie by Howard Hawks revived all of those experiences I had in Egypt.  Thousands extras acted in different scenes while dressed and appeared just like the ancient Egyptians did.  The scenes at the quarries, moving stones on the rivers and massive labor for years were no exaggeration.  The Director, Howard Hawks had the gift to produce movies like the Land of the Pharaohs that included education, history and the politics into a magnificent production.  It was both the religion and symbol of Egypt's greatness for the Great Pyramid to contain the treasure and tomb of the Pharaoh, Kufu as a representation of Egypt's greatness as an empire.  Here is a five-star classic movie worthy of a DVD collection.  Note the subtitles contain the names of the Egyptian Gods and persons that are very enlightening and educational.",1468454400,7,1327,4.734782608695652

This is a moral film set in ancient Egypt.  It is very good ...with a spectacular ending.  Joan Collins gave possibly the best performance in her career in my opinion.  It goes to show you what happened way back then may still hold for today.  What a set-up by the High Priest.  I highly recommend this film. Ranks right up there with The Ten Commandments, Ben Hur, Fall of the Roman Empire, Sparticus and etc..  In my opinion, well worth the watch and money spent to obtain the film.  I am glad I got a copy as I don't know for how much longer it may be available.  Perhaps , in my opinion,  they should play this film in history class in school.  I highly recommend this film. This film has not swearing or nudity in it and is worthy to show to your family.  It was made before the current language customs came into play.  I don't feel you will be too sorry for watching this.  A Hint:  Listen very carefully at the end when the people are leaving Egypt.  I would rate it for anyone.",1446249600,5,1140,4.136986301369863

""Now five-thousand years of might, mystery and majesty sweep down upon you as the story of the first wonder of the world becomes the greatest wonder of the entertainment world!

So vast, that making it was the screen's supreme achievement!

So powerful that seeing it will be your greatest dramatic experience!

A motion picture triumph that you will never forget!""

The above comes from the theatrical trailer of this engrossing epic.

We are presented with a fictional account of the building of the Great Pyramid (the oldest and largest of the three pyramids found in Egypt).  (Note that the Great Pyramid served as a tomb for the Pharaoh.)

This movie stars two British actors: Jack Hawkins (1919 to 1973) and a young Joan Collins as Pharaoh Khufu (also known as Cheops) and his second wife, Queen Nelifer.  They give good performances as do all the others involved in this spectacle.  (Collins first appears about 39 minutes into this movie.)

This film has literally a cast of thousands (almost 9800 extras in one scene alone).

The sets are magnificently detailed including the pyramid's inner labyrinth, booby-trapped so no one can learn its secrets and live.  You get to also see vast deserted vistas that fill the screen.  The vivid colours shown are quite astonishing.

I thought that the background music enhanced each scene.

This movie was filmed on location in Egypt and in Rome studios.

Surprisingly, this film was a box-office failure since it did not quite break even.  I don't know why it was seen as a failure.

Finally, the DVD itself (the one released in 2013) has two extras.  Both are good.

In conclusion, this is a truly lavish production whose story can be summed up by what one character says:

""To build a tomb to house one man in his second life, thousands are finding misery in this life.""

(1955;  1 hr, 45 min; wide screen;  27 scenes)

1159595,2,7885880605,"I really wanted to like this film. The opening scenes are pretty impressive as we see thousands of Egyptians accompanying the Pharaoh (Jack Hawkins) on his return from a campaign. The outdoor shots are gorgeously composed in Cinemascope. So, too, are the construction scenes of workers ceaselessly laboring to build the pyramid which will eventually be the Pharaoh's tomb.

The main problem is there isn't any one to root for. Pharaoh is so obsessed with his gold and his pyramid that he's willing to make his people miserable for thirty years. When he dies, I felt no sympathy for him. By the end, he doesn't come to any realization or transformation in character. His scheming wife (Joan Collins) and her lover are one-dimensional. I should have felt sympathetic towards the architect and his son (Dewey Martin). They've agreed to design the pyramid in exchange for the release of their people, but those people have such an abstract presence, the sympathy dissipated for me. Hawks also found Dewey Martin distracted by his celebrity status and pared his scenes down to virtually nothing.

Hawks made some great films, but this was a misfire. His next film, Rio Bravo, was a masterpiece. Also, a masterpiece is The Big Sky with a superlative Dewey Martin.",1400716800,2,1257,4.95260663507109

1159657,5,7885880605,"I have become a Howard Hawks fan over the years collecting movies. I prefer movies with good dialogue and short on gratuitous computerized special effects. I always seemed to gravitate to certain films but never knew why. Then I noticed they were usually Hawks productions. I discovered that one of the traits of his films is the dialogue. It seems so natural. At times he used rapid-fire repartee, or used overlapping dialogue to make conversations sound more realistic with one character speaking before another finishes.

Hawks is quoted:

""I had noticed that when people talk, they talk over one another, especially people who talk fast or who are arguing or describing something. So I often write my dialogue in a way that makes the beginnings and ends of sentences unnecessary; they are there for overlapping.""

Once you pick up on this trait in Hawk's pictures you may come to enjoy his work as well.

Land of the Pharaohs is a Hawks extravaganza with a cast of thousands. In fact, he hired the Egyptian army to re-enact the Pharaoh's soldiers in the opening scenes of the film, and their triumphal return from pillaging and destroying Egypt's latest enemy. They are a dead giveaway. The Pharaoh's army historically was clean shaven. The modern Egyptian soldiers flatly refused to shave their mustaches off for the film!

The beautiful Joan Collins, in her film debut, plays the scheming fem fatale who turns Pharaoh's head once introduced to his court to ostensibly pay tribute from her kingdom. Meanwhile, Pharaoh, who yearns for a tamper proof tomb, engages the services of an ingenious architect who nearly cost him his last victory, but is now Pharaoh's prisoner.

As the tomb goes up, Joan gets down lying, cheating and killing her way to becoming Queen and inherit (steal) Pharaoh's kingdom and treasure. Well she gets it in the end in more ways than one. A wonderful and just climax in a classic, if not now, cult flick.

This is a must-have Hawks flick.",1400544000,3,1969,4.859701492537313

1159659,5,7885880605,"I have very fond memories of this movie, having watched it on TV eons ago.  To finally have my own copy, to watch anytime I want to, is great.  As for the film in question, it's a historical spectacle that doesn't quite rise to the standard of an epic.  Much of the film drags on far too long with way too many scenes of parading hordes.  Just that, thousands of people marching, attending lengthy funerals, or as they work in the quarries gathering stones to build a pyramid.  Sending those stones down river.  Dragging those stones across the sand...........  On the helpful side of things, they do provide a narration of dubious historical significance to go along with it.  You may find that enlightening or mind numbingly dull.  They do have 15 years to kill before the real star of this film finally shows up: Joan Collins.  At that point, things really take off with court intrigue, assassination attempts, lust, and greed galore.  Every scene featuring Joan fairly crackles with verve.  Joan singlehandedly brings this doomed venture to life (Land of the Pharaohs was such a failure, director Hawks' quit directing for four years).  Joan is the absolute best reason to watch this film.  Alex Minotis (as Hamar), James Robertson Justice (as Vashtar), and Jack Hawkins (as Pharaoh Khufu) are the next best reason to watch.  Otherwise, it's pretty routine.  (But still a wonderfully awful trashy classic with an incredible finale.)",1397606400,,1436,4.8962655601659755

I'm not a Critic or do I want to be. If I was one, the movies I've seen seen since 1980s onward would never pass for even fair. No way near the old directors and actors.

Joan Collins is at her conniving, bitchy best in this film, which was one of her early screen appearances.  Her character, Nellifer, comes to pharaoh's (Jack Hawkins) court as an offering from a tributary kingdom.  She quickly slinks her way into the pharaoh's heart, and goes to work.  Pharaoh is busy building his pyramid, and the very creative way this is depicted, including the stunning method for sealing the tomb at the end of the film, is ingenious and clever.

Joan Collins,  as usual, is terrible, but since the character she portrays is also ""terrible"" to a large extent, at the end of the movie she gets what she deserves for her nasty performance: she is buried alive.  This witty comment was made by another reviewer here, and I fully agree with it.  Great.  Now... what would then be the real problem with this movie ?

This film uses the wide screen process of CinemaScope to full advantage and it's visually a treat, from the costumes to the sets, but just like many film spectaculars, the emphasis is on that, not the script.
Joan plays one of Pharaoh's (Jack Hawkins) concubine's who scheme's to be ruler herself someday. But the real interest for me is the building of Pharaoh's tomb in a great Pyramid.

1160120,3,7885880605,"Warners made full use of the invention of CinemaScope with its extravagant historical epics in the mid-Fifties: this enjoyably trashy story of the building of the Great Pyramid of Cheops repeatedly makes beautiful use of the widescreen aspect to show (via panning shots) a kind of mural effect of zillions of extras quarrying out the pyramid's stones under the hot Egyptian sun. Howard Hawks was the director and ""Nobel Prize-winning William Faulker"" was the head screenwriter, yet the whole thing seems engineered specifically for the taste of twelve year-old boys. There are almost no distinguishable characters other than the chief architect and his son, both motivated solely by an honorable sense of duty, and the pharaoh Khufu (Jack Hawkins) and his haughty Cypriot second wife Nellifer (Joan Collins), both motivated solely by a greed for gold and jewels (the way children imagine rich people). The real emphasis is on what would most impress prepubescent boys: the awesome labor and planning involved in the building of the pyramid. There's also a great revenge kicker at the end that also seems perfectly pitched to young boys, and remains hard to forget decades after seeing it. Clad almost solely in lam slinky skirts with matching lift-and-separate haltertops, Collins is at probably her most unforgettable here of all her Hollywood films, despite her distractingly awful violet-grey makeup (with bright orange lipstick).",1200182400,10,1433,5.317180616740088
1160121,5,7885880605,"Howard Hawks and Joan Collins may have spent years talking the film down after its failure at the box-office, but Land of the Pharaohs isn't the kind of guilty pleasure you might expect given its DVD release as part of Warners' `Camp Classics Collection.' While it may be hokum (Jack Hawkins' gold-loving Pharaoh determines to build a pyramid that will keep him and his treasures safe from tomb robbers for all eternity while new wife Joan Collins plots to relieve him of them), there's some damn good filmmaking in there as well as a killer ending that help mark it out as one of the best of the 50s widescreen epics. The first 35 minutes, offering a truly spectacular introduction to the world of Ancient Egypt, are particularly impressive, and once the plot is set in motion it's a fascinating look at the sheer logistics of building a pyramid with only human labour at your disposal. The fact that these sequences are filmed with real human labour - literally thousands of real extras - rather than CGI trickery only adds to their real sense of awe.

Things do take a turn for the sillier with the arrival of Joan Collins' scheming temptress, pouting her way from Cypriot ambassador (yes, it's a stretch) to Pharaoh's latest wife and then plotting to separate him from his wife, his life and his beloved treasure in that order while he shows off his godlike powers by wrestling a bull barehanded. In the process, James Robertson Justice's conquered and captive architect trading his life and his talents for his people's freedom and his son Dewey Martin tend to get sidelined. Apparently the film was originally going to be longer but was trimmed down before release, and it's possible that their characters bore the brunt of the cuts. It's been done skilfully enough that it doesn't look like anything is obviously missing, although it does leave the film with no-one to root for: in Hawks' words, ""Everybody was a son-of-a-b****."" Yet that never really matters, since the film's S.O.B.s are much more interesting than any of the more decent characters, and the film throws in one of the screen's greatest and most delightfully ingenious poetic revenge endings as everyone gets what they richly deserve.

A forerunner to his masterly work on The Fall of the Roman Empire, Dimitri Tiomkin's florid and grandiose score may not be subtle, but this isn't a film that calls for musical subtlety: often boasting surprisingly complex construction and deconstruction of themes, this is powerful, epic stuff determined to give voice to the thousands of extras and the be heard above all the wonders and gods of Ancient Egypt themselves. Unfortunately the DVD transfer is somewhat disappointing thanks to the combination of the deeply flawed WarnerColor system that is an absolute nightmare to restore and early CinemaScope lenses which occasionally give you a loss of detail and variable color in the same shot, with long shots suffering worst of all. It's certainly acceptable and there's nothing that can realistically be done to improve it, but it is a shame. On the plus side, Peter Bogdanovich's audio commentary thankfully includes plentiful extracts from his taped interviews with Hawks and the original theatrical trailer is included. Incidentally, for another, less Hollywood take on the subject, seek out Ismail Kadare's superb Albanian novel The Dust of Kings (published in English as The Pyramid) which uses the building of Cheops' Great Pyramid as an allegory for Stalin's Five Year Plans.",1197763200,5,3498,4.988013698630137

It's a large scale Cinemascope production (looks goofy on a 20"" screen) where little was spared in art direction and set decoration.  Jack Hawkins is suitably regal as the Pharaoh and James Robertson Justice shines as the slave architect who designs his master an impenetrable tomb.  A young Joan Collins provides the sexual tension as the slave girl who schemes her way to becoming Pharaoh's wife.  The thin plot unfolds as expected, but it's the spectacular cast of thousands and the exotic sets that carry the day.

This DVD is in gorgeous WIDE-SCREEN format (not 3:4 cut-and-pan) and the audio soundtrack is in sensational stereo. So you can lean back and enjoy Dimitri Tiomkin's glorious musical score.

The stereo sound makes you feel you are actually in the tomb with Joan Collins as the stone blocks fall into place, entombing her alive for all time.

There are a couple of drawbacks to this DVD. The default mode is with Chinese subtitles. You have to switch them off manually using your remote control. There are no extras whatsoever with this DVD.

In addition, you should crank up the color saturation on your TV to get full benefit of the original WarnerColor hues, which are a bit faded in this print.

Also, the opening credits and closing credits have been deleted. The movie just starts with the opening scene without any introduction. But every scene, and every word of dialogue is here.

Clearly the signature role of her career, she played the part to perfection. Her performance alone makes the film worth purchasing if only to gaze upon her once more.

Forgive my adolescent walk down memory lane and let me continue. In the wake of such blockbusters as 'Ben-Hur' this earlier masterpiece has been all but forgotten by the populace at large. 'Land of the Pharaohs' tells the fictionalized account of the building of the Great Pyramid to house Pharaoh Khufu (Jack Hawkins) in the Afterlife. The method of building the edifice and process of sealing the labyrinth afterwards is extremely well done and fascinating to watch.

Other than Joan's memorable performance the rest of the acting is a little stiff and over choreographed, but the cimematography is excellent and the soundtrack by the legendary Dimitri Tiomkin rivals anything the more well known epics of the time had to offer.

Peter Bogdanovich tells in the commentary that the French referred to it as the most intelligent spectacle film ever made.  And probably (sorry mister Lang) they were right.  The Pharaoh is a master with total power that believed the promises of future richness himself.  Those with special qualifications which are necessary to him are rewarded with earthly goods (good food and women are the coveted prizes); the masses of laborers are convinced of a posterior second life where they can received the rewards of their work in this one.  Socially the film is a child of 1950s sensibilities: the good women are the good wives, who can cook well and attend to the children; instead, the bad ones are gold-diggers, which abuse of their beauty and are capable of murder in their search of power.  The strange conclusion is that a murderous despot is preferable to the devious woman that wants what he has.  Esthetically is a very static piece, exploiting the recently adopted Cinemascope screen ratio for spectacular shots of the masses in movement (that and a venomous cobra give credence to the contemporary adagio of the ""widescreen"" ratio as only useful to film snakes).  But what you see in the screen is mostly real.  The shots are cleanly executed and the climax is perfectly done and satisfying.  The script is fairly good, and having William Faulkner as one of the screenwriters doesn't hurt; the music by Dimitri Tiomkin appropriately reflects grandeur and imperial power.",1188604800,,1613,4.962825278810409

A forgettable History movie, since there is no relation with any historic fact, pertinent to the Reign of Cheops in it.
It is more a nice Fantasy/Love Lost/Revenge approach, that still has its qualities to this day.

Many where made in those days, just look at ""David and Bathsheba"", starring Gregory Peck, or even ""Solomon and Sheba"" starring Yul Brynner. It has to be considered as the ""Great Couples of Antiquity"" trend that went on almost to the Mid-Sixties, ending perhaps with ""Cleopatra"", starring Elizabeth Taylor, Rex Harrison and Richard Burton (a triangle?).

But nevertheless, they were all highly entertaining and in their ingenuity even well-done movies.

Actors like Jack Hawkins or James Robertson Justice are bitterly missed nowadays, and left us some powerful performances even with products like this one.

My three stars are not diminishing the value of the movie at hand, but rather stand for the true esteem I have for products of this sort.
It cannot be considered a history lesson, but rather a nice and vivid extravaganza, and as such it should receive 5 stars.

But since we are talking about people who actually lived, and who had a well-documented past or at least a summary of their deeds, even in the 50's, I must say that Hollywood did not go deeper than necessary and farther than it is obvious, to bring us such spectacle.

Not only does he have nothing positive to say about the film, he actually has NOTHING to say at all.  His presence on the track can only be explained by his having an old taped interview with Hawks in which he leads the director to discuss DeMille and dump on his movie. A total waste of time when there is so much to behold on screen.  But get it anyway!  It's a great 'Land'.""",1183593600,62,459,4.364705882352941

The new, fully restored, wide-screen, stereo DVD edition of LAND OF THE PHARAOHS is finally on the way  -- due date, June 26. You can pre-order this on Amazon now...then settle back and watch Joan, Jack and Dewey -- and that can-you-top-this finale!!!",1179705600,2,408,5.166666666666667
1160214,4,7885880605,"Well, I thought it would never come out on DVD.  Perhaps it's my passion for all things ancient Egyptian, but I have always loved this wonderfully enjoyable epic.  Howard Hawks was a director who steadfastly refused to be pigeon-holed, making everything from Bogey's ""The Big Sleep"" to sci-fi classic ""The Thing"" (although he credited editor Christian Nyby instead of himself) to stock car racing ""Red Line 7000.""  Here he takes a shot at ""historical"" epic and does a damned entertaining job of it.  Pharaoh  Jack Hawkins plays straightman to Joan Collins' campy concubine while James Robertson Justice does a terrific job of keeping a straight face as a tomb architect.  Amidst all the stone monuments, the only thing wooden is Dewey Martin as Justice's son.  All this may not sound like a **** movie, but it's a guilty pleasure I've watched so many times on VHS that it's embarrassing.  That's gotta be worth extra credit.",1177286400,112,924,4.916129032258064
