8036356,5,B00061F5F8,This is just one of multiple titles from this same series. My kids and their friends love all of these. They watch them over and over with renewed interest each time and we discuss them afterwards.,1381881600,,197,4.5
8036357,3,B00061F5F8,"This series is made by Nest Entertainment which I found out has Mormon ties. Because of this, you have to preview them carefully as they insert stuff that is inaccurate. Not in all of the series but some of them are really off base! I bought a bunch of them not knowing this and ended up throwing the ones that were erroneous in the trash!!",1326672000,4,340,4.246153846153846
