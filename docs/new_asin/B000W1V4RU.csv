8602572,5,B000W1V4RU,"I did the video this morning for the first time.  It was very complete, as it worked core, upper body and lower body.  Very easy to follow.  It had (easy) yoga moves (new for me).  I am currently training for a half marathon, so this video will be part of my training from now on, since it builds muscle strength, necesary for all those runs ahead of me.",1313020800,4,354,4.161764705882353
8602573,5,B000W1V4RU,"This workout moves very quickly compared to other fusion-style programs. I like that it has a different feel, and I tend to become bored when programs move too slowly. I have enjoyed Kimberly's kickboxing-based workouts, as well. It is a great cardio option on my ""barefoot days"" (I do this workout barefoot, even though Kimberly and her assistants wear shoes). I would judge this as a light workout for the intermediate-advanced exerciser.",1196208000,8,440,5.125
