1235783,5,B00000JMOE,"First off, I wouldn't normally consider myself a fan of life-affirming womens' stories.  I'm supposed to be a spiky intellectual male-type-person.  I don't like this kind of music; I prefer loud guitars, anything from the  Second Viennese School, atonal improvisation and hip-hop.  This film should  by rights make me gag.
And yet, it's so well-written and so beautifully  acted that it taps in me some suppressed vein of shameless emotionalism.  Ileanna Douglas is brilliant as the geeky songwriter who matures into a  sadder and wiser Earth Mother, following various more or less catastrophic  relationships with oppressive men.  John Turturro is the producer with a  very strange beard who keeps a sort-of-brotherly eye out for her.  Bridget  Fonda has a lovely cameo as the teen idol with the guilty secret.  Even  Patsy Kensit is good, for crying out loud.
There's a scene near the end  where Turturro confronts Douglas that gets me as near to crying as I ever  get about something fictional, and that's saying a lot.  Douglas's singing  voice is dubbed by Kristen Vigard, whoever she is, and full marks to her.  It's not going to make me go out and buy a Carole King CD, but it's a gem  of a movie.",960163200,22,1204,4.803921568627451
1235784,4,B00000JMOE,"I picked this movie up on a whim, and I really enjoyed the story about the rise and fall of the Brill Building songwriters. I especially enjoyed the chemistry between Douglas and Matt Dillon, and the stellar performance by  John Turturro.  He is on my list of overrated actors.  The only thing I  didn't like was the editing. At times, it could be very choppy and you  could tell which scenes were being cut.",944697600,,408,4.45945945945946
1235785,4,B00000JMOE,"A warm and funny tribute to a turbulent time in music.  The score and soundtrack alone are worth the price of admission.  Elvis and Burt did an amazing job, and God Give Me Strength is maybe one of the best songs to  ever come from a film!  A little corny at times, but in just the right  quantity to keep this film honest.  Definately worth watching more than  once, the lead characters do justice to their roles.",942105600,,414,4.298701298701299
1235786,5,B00000JMOE,"Grace Of My Heart is an all over feel good movie.  The character Denise Waverly is an inspiration.  Her story, triumphs, pain, and songs are a reminder that life is too short to not live it to the fullest, and to never  give up.  ""God Give Me Strength"" indeed !  The music in this  movie is brilliant and perfect.  Hats off to Karyn Ratchman!  I saw this  movie and bought the soundtrack and my own copy the next day.",916617600,,417,4.177215189873418
1235787,5,B00000JMOE,"The song and movie tile, of the same name, is an endearing reminder of the changes in the times and music throughout the 60s and 70s.

1235823,4,B00000JMOE,"The real strength of this movie is the music. The original songs were worth the price of admission themselves, a diverse range that captured well the style of hits from the late 50s to early 70s. Illeana Douglas is excellent as well, believable and appealing as the lead. The story is good too. My only reservation is it was told a bit too literally. At times it was easy to see where the story was going, though the overall journey was rewarding.",1438041600,,447,4.463414634146342

1235825,5,B00000JMOE,"I give this 5 stars because the movie presents clearly an on-going subject that I've never seen before. I'd heard about how pop music suddenly changed into something else... Being a baby-boomer and having grown up in the 60's and having good memories of the music that came from multi-talented writers that basically were pushed out of what Joni Mitchell playfully dubbed ""stokin' the star maker machinery behind the popular songs""  You know the olde saying ""if it's not broken, don't try and fix it""  The acting was superb and skillfully and passionately presented.  I loved it!!",1436486400,,580,4.958762886597938

1235838,4,B00000JMOE,"Very nice, different picture. It looks at the challenges of a female singer-songwriter in the late 50s early 60s. To me, it seemed like a thinly-veiled bio pic of Carole King's life, with a few extras in there. In part this is a music biography film, about how a star finds her voice, but it seems to be more about the barriers and life than the music.",1427673600,,352,4.268656716417911

1235862,3,B00000JMOE,"As with most reviewers, I found the story to be fascinating, and the acting superb. However,the pace of the film and it's easy, rushed resolve are weak points. However, I would watch it again, and I would enjoy it again!",1403740800,,220,4.525

Artists from the era paired with current artists. Burt Bacharach and Elvis Costello, for example,  wrote one of my favorite songs ever, God Give Me Strength, and I can't figure out how that has not become an American standard. It is brilliant! THIS NEEDS TO COME OUT IN BLUE RAY!! Please?!",1398816000,,446,4.717948717948718
1235865,5,B00000JMOE,"I love the music, the actors, the story, everything. This delightful musical creates fictional versions of Carole King, Beach Boys, the legendary recordmakers & producers of the 50s-60s-70s and weaves in songs written by composers of that time along with more contemporary composers writing in the style of each era. Loved it. Love Elvis Costello and Burt Bachrach's work together on this.

I have seen this movie several times since it came out & finally bought my own kindle copy so I can watch it whenever I feel the need for a musical lift. (Note this is not a musical so much as a movie with a lot of music). Ileanna Douglas is fantastic and whoever sang for her has a fantastic voice and phrasing.",1396828800,2,703,4.624

1235869,2,B00000JMOE,"trying to cover FAR too much territory and having these loosely based characters ""crossing "" each others lives[Carole King w Brian Wilson]...too unbelievable...good performances but schmaltzy songs...Carol King deserves a much better bio as does Brian Wilson and Phil Spector...I know its supposed to be ""loosely based"" but I don't buy it...stick to the really good musical bio flics[Buddy Holly,Loretta Lynn,Ray Charles,The Temptations... even something as fictional as ,THAT THING YOU DO works much better as a look at the Sixties feel and sound better than this tearjerker.",1379980800,,576,5.556818181818182
1235870,4,B00000JMOE,good movie IMO.  Loosely based on the life of Carol King.  I really like one of the songs in the movie written by Burt Bacharach called God Give Me Strength.  I thought the movie was good.,1377734400,,188,4.166666666666667

1235874,5,B00000JMOE,"I love this story, partly because I love the history of that period of music,and partly because the main character reminds me of my friend the playwright Louisa Rose. Physically, and that particular sense of humor. and her approach to one's life's work.",1366243200,,253,4.906976744186046
1235875,5,B00000JMOE,"I love this movie, so I can't say you will feel the same.  I can only give my opinion, which is to say it's a special movie.  While it doesn't say it's based on historical events, it follows the life of a pop songwriter, starting off with New York's Brill Building in the early 1960s and then out to the music scene in California, and ends with the early 70s.  If you're not familiar with the Brill Building, it was a kind of pop music factory where all of the great pop songs of the early 60s were recorded.  It was considered a factory, because everything was there...the agents, the songwriting staff pumping out songs for new acts, and even the recording studios.  Greats like Carole King started writing songs there.

It follows Edna Buxton (Illeana Douglas) as she lives the life of a struggling songwriter.  I think this is very much how it must have been for many of the great songwriters of the time.  If you ever thought of yourself as a songwriter or even a wannabee, you should love this movie.  You follow her through the years, and through the good and bad of this experience.

In addition to the great script, there is a lot of great music, too.  The music isn't the classics of those days, but the songs were written by great songwriters such as Burt Bacharach, Elvis Costello, Joni Mitchell and others to sound like they were written back then.  Some of the songs sound a LOT like some of the classics from those days on purpose, as a 'tip of the hat'.  Wikipedia has a lot of good info about this movie.  If you don't want to take my word for it, just check it out.  There's a lot of name dropping going on behind the scenes.

In my opinion, this is at least a very good movie, it not a great one.  Yes I'm biased, so don't blame me if you don't like it.  But, I really don't think you'll be disappointed.",1364169600,2,1823,4.296187683284457
1235876,5,B00000JMOE,"I've always loved this one, yet you can't buy the DVD in Germany. I have no clue why. But now I have it and I love it :)",1363910400,,120,3.3214285714285716
1235877,5,B00000JMOE,"I thought this was an excellent movie and Iileana Douglas gave an amazing performance.  I also like Matt Dillon and thought his portrayal of Jay was a good one.  It reminded me of several movies with the similar theme of ""A Star is Born"" with Judy Garland and James Mason and also the movie with the same name with Barbra Striesand and Kris Kristofferson.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys music or who is in the entertaining and recording industry.",1360540800,,466,4.590361445783133
1235888,5,B00000JMOE,"The whole story line made you think about who the characters were, and made you go back and rewatch.  I first watched the movie on television, and enjoyed it.  Then I bought the video.  I enjoy listening to Dusty Springfield, and I knew Carole King wrote alot of the great songs she sang.  Growing up I listened to Carole King.",1359936000,,327,4.4

1235890,5,B00000JMOE,"Love this movie. It should have done much better at the box office. Neat Story and great music. Casting Illeana D and Matt D worked!
It's worth buying to hear ""God give me Strength"" I didn't know Elvis Costello & Barry Manilow worked together so well. Lent the DVD out, didn't get it back yet so I'm buying it again.",1357948800,,316,4.283333333333333
1235891,5,B00000JMOE,"This film about 60's pop music and how it changed going into the 70's is very entertaining without being maudlin or sentimental. The central character is very loosely based on Carole King...a female songwriter who wants to record her own songs but is resigned to write hits for others in the legendary New York song factory that was the Brill building. Along the way she collaborates with one of her male counterparts, marries him, has a baby, divorces him, moves to California, gets involved with a Beach Boys type, marries him, tragedy ensues, but art ultimately triumphs as she finally records a successful album of her own songs.

What I like about this film is that it's NOT a biopic so you're not constantly comparing the events in the movie to real life. While there are some obvious parallels to Carole King's career, other female songwriters like Elie Greenwich are also referenced in Douglass' character and her female colleagues.

Strong performances by Illiana Douglass, John Turturrow and Matt Dillon.

The sound track features strong songs by Burt Bacharach and Elvis Costello, Joni Mitchell, Larry Klein (Joni's ex) and others.

Carole King was just announced as the latest recipient of the Gershwin Prize for popular songwriting, awarded by the Library Of Congress and I hope this movie gets more attention because of it.

King joins Paul Simon, Stevie Wonder, Paul McCartney and Burt Bacharach/Hal David as recipients of the Gershwin Prize. If you don't know about the Gershwin brothers, do some homework and learn about the music they wrote. If you want to hear definitive interpretations of their songs, get the ""Ella Fitzgerald Sings the George and Ira Gershwin Songbooks"" CD set. This is some of the best music making ever put on record!",1355961600,,1758,4.986348122866894
1235892,5,B00000JMOE,Love the plot of this movie...It's not the same cookie cutter story that's been overdone in Hollywood time and time again. It really shows a side of the music business that isn't shown too often. The acting was great! The script was original and well written. I would definitely recommend this movie to someone who is sick of seeing the crap being put out there today.,1354838400,,368,4.590909090909091

Yes, it's sappy and appears to base its characters on real ones.  Yes, some of the best singing was dubbed.  Yes, it could probably be called a chick flick.  So?

Curl up on the couch, suspend disbelief and just enjoy a well told story about a bygone era with some really nice music.  Rainy day optional.",1302998400,,484,4.184782608695652

I love Ileana Douglas, she's such a great actress and is wonderful in this film. I'm not sure if this would be a movie I would watch often due to some heavy subject matter like suicide and mental illness, but it ends great, Denise Waverly finally becomes a successful singer. The costumes are beautifull and Ileana Douglas looks amazing in them. My only criticism is the lip-synch work, it's not so great. Ileana Douglas should have sang herself I've heard her sing in other movies, and I think she could have sang well. Other than that it's a definite buy.",1234742400,,696,4.361538461538461

1235913,5,B00000JMOE,"This is a wonderful movie capturing the days of the Brill Building in New York where the majority of the songs we heard in the 50s, 60s, and some 70s were written.  It accurately depicts a time when female songwriters and singers were in the vast minority.  Coupled with the fact that the movie is loosely based on Carole King's life before she received acclaim as a singer as well as a song writer, this movie and its music reflect a wonderful era.  It is sad, however, that the soundtrack of this movie did not include the female version of God Give Me Strength.",1202860800,,564,4.403846153846154

1235915,4,B00000JMOE,"Grace of My Heart (Allison Anders, 1996)

Allison Anders spent the early part of her career making little gems that no one saw (with the exception of one film upon which she collaborated with, among others, Quentin Tarantino). Grace of My Heart is one of them, a loosely-fictionalized account of Carole King's career in the Brill Building, writing hit song after hit song for other artists before reaching into herself and drawing on that material for the groundbreaking 1971 album Tapestry, to this day considered one of the best records ever released in America by many critics.

Illeana Douglas (Bondage) plays Edna Buxton, a socialite from the Philadelphia suburbs who wins a recording contract in New York. When she gets there, she finds out the whole thing was something of a scam, and finds herself down and out until she meets Joel Millner (John Turturro [Rounders] in what may be one of his finest roles), a producer who renames her Denise Waverly and gets her caught up in writing songs for other artists, and Howard Caszatt (Eric Stoltz [who would come back and work with Anders again in Things Behind the Sun]), who becomes her songwriting partner, and after a while her husband. The marriage is anything but stable, and Denise's life continues on its rocky path through a succession of friends, lovers, and inevitable heartbreak. Until, that is, Tapestry-- excuse me, Grace of My Heart.

What Anders brings to the table is that, while she was obviously going for some sense of the reality underlying the fiction, she never lets it get in the way of telling a good tale. Music historians will find a good deal to munch on where this picture is concerned, but the rest of us can just sit back, chew popcorn, and have a good time without worrying about whether we understood all the in-jokes or not. (Not that that stops us. It seems there's been a debate raging for years over whether Bridget Fonda's character in the movie is a lesbian or not. I don't understand why; isn't it patently obvious?) The primary goal of any good film should be to entertain, and Grace of My Heart delivers. Everything else is just icing on the cake. ****",1172534400,,2145,4.729946524064171
1235916,5,B00000JMOE,"A lot to recommend here, Illeana Douglas deserved an Oscar nomination, and much more popular recognition than was forthcoming for her terrific performance in what should have been her breakthrough movie. Her portrayal of Denise Waverly (nee Edna Buxton) is just so RIGHT that it has to be seen rather than droned-on about. But drone on, I must, if it might help let people know there is a lot in this movie to savor.
 Ms. Douglas is so excellent that it's tempting to overlook good work of other actors in the movie, but i won't.  As the beautiful but snooty British songwriting colleague of Denise's, Patsy Kensit is just perfect, the eventual friendship of the two women unfolds believably and very enjoyably. Douglas and Kensit are terrific in their scenes together.
Matt Dillon gave one of his best film performances here, Eric Stoltz and John Turturro were spot-on in roles that seemed to be (loosely) based upon Gerry Goffin and Phil Spector.  The Edna/Denise character clearly has shadings of Carole King, while Dillon's character seems to have more than a tad of Brian Wilson used as inspiration.  Chris Isaak, in a miniscule role, unfortunately, is totally forgettable as Kensit's husband.
Recapturing what NYC's  Brill Building may have been like circa 1963, progressing with a satisfying segue into early 70's Los Angeles, the movie hits all the right notes.
Members from the girl-group that Denise wrote early hits for nicely weave in and out of the movie, the Patty Duke-esque female teen-star who struggles with her 'Secret Love' provides another memorable segment amongst many.
The film may have undone itself by not admitting the not-so-subtle maskings of aspects of the lives of Carole King and Phil Spector.  These 'fictional' characters seem to be a treatment of ""what if Phil Spector had discovered Carole King and then she fell in love with Brian Wilson?' (It is less obvious that the roles of Kensit and Isaak could also be intrepreted as being based upon Mann and Weill, the UK's  answer to King and Goffin in the 1960's).
 Maybe  'karma' somehow prevented this film from being the huge smash it should have been, only in that if the lives of King, Goffin, Spector and Wilson actually were the inspiration of this movie, it may have been better to be upfront about it.  Yet, the film is so life-affirming, the music so good, the feel of it so resonant, 'Grace Of My Heart' is a success of its own entity.
Today in 2007, Motown, Diana Ross, Berry Gordy and Florence Ballard are getting similar treatment with 'Dreamgirls'-- aspects of their lives are used without monetary compensation, changing just enough not to have to pay.  'Dreamgirls' is 2007's ""Grace of My Heart"", with louder box-office ka-ching and some Oscar noise that 'Grace of My Heart' was actually more deserving of.
The DVD is a great value for the price, loaded with extras  and a sufficient fold-out booklet.  See it for a once-in-a-lifetime performance by Illeana Douglas.",1170547200,10,2964,4.904

Illeana Douglas, always absolutely fantastic, just takes this one all the way home. The story is great, the cast amazing, this is a just a great story. Great movies, to me, are ones that you don't feel compelled to pick to bits to justify why you liked it. You just do. This is an entertainment medium after all.

1235919,5,B00000JMOE,"Illeana Douglas is always fun to watch and this movie suprised me.  LOVED the soundtrack, but liked the music DURING the movie even more.  While I liked Elvis Costello's version of the title song, the vocal used in the movie and the singing contest scene with it was the highlight (who is that singer?!?!?!?). The ending dragged a bit and Eric Stolz and Matt Dillon's characters were just so bad to her that it became a bit unbelievable that she'd even put up with them as long as she did.  The ""Secret Love"" storyline was clever, too.",1144281600,2,535,4.494845360824742

1235921,2,B00000JMOE,"Shooting at just under two hours, this is one of those films where you nearly feel winded after watching it in its entirety.  Not that it is a ""bad"" thing to have so much happening in just a short amount of time, but with Grace of My Heart it felt like a solid blow to the gut.  The lack of air, the ""whoosh"" of intense pain, and the increased blurred vision due to the excitement of the punch were all experiences that I had while watching this film.  For those that can sit here and claim that this was a perfect film, I really beg to differ, but I will be a very brave advocate towards the ""originally average"".  This means that there were elements that I completely loved, followed in suit by elements that made me awaken at night in a pool of my own sweat.  Grace of My Heart was one of those classic cinematic tug-o-wars that ultimately ended in a stalemate, but had fans on either side waiting for the final results.

Beyond the cryptic comparisons that I make above, there were moments of honesty, especially when I was thinking about the elements that worked and those that did not.  You cannot talk about this film without giving Anders the credit that she deserves for the music.  This film could not have survived without the talent that was behind the musical moments.  The energy, emotion, and cultural independence were ravishing.  Literally, it could take your breath away and you wouldn't have even realized it.  It set the tone and created the atmosphere for this film.  As a viewer, you could close your eyes, ignore the spoken words of this film, and get completely lost in the music.  The way that Anders incorporated established, modern singers to bring this era of the 50s, 60s, and 70s to life were brilliant.  She deserved the accolades that followed the musical footsteps of this film, sadly ... I don't think she quite had a firm grip on the rest of the story.

What I mean by this is that while the songs established the film, the story and characters hurt it. Illeana Douglas does exceptionally well with the material presented to her, but she just doesn't quite drag you into her life.  You never quite feel as if you are right there with her experiencing her sorrows, excitements, and pain as she trudges through this man-infested life of hers.  You watch her go through the motions, but you never feel that tear erupt or couch-excitement brew.  It just doesn't happen, and why ... because 1) she never ages throughout the course of 20ish years (only gets thinner and thinner) 2) her voice is semi-whiney through the entire film causing us to feel like she was a bit sour and finally, 3) her consistent need for a man in her life.  This latter I blame Anders.  She never defines Waverly's character throughout the film.  Is she a feminist?  Is she as independent as we all thought?  Does she create or simply steal from other's misfortunes?  These are simple questions that should have been answered throughout the film, but instead we are nearly forced to explode (as stated before) as more and more information is jammed down our vision.  It is nearly sickening.  While Illeana doesn't carry the weight of disaster completely on her own shoulders, there are other characters that just didn't seem to fit the mold of the film.  Bruce Davison and Matt Dillon seemed to be completely miscast in their respective roles, again constantly reminding us that we were watching a film, not immersing ourselves in a vivid story.

The only character that I can give credit towards is John Turturro's Joel Millner.  Turturro took his ""bit"" part to a new level always giving enough so that we constantly waited for him to reappear on screen.  He was like an animated cartoon that brought more to the screen than any of the other characters mentioned above.  That is sad to see for a film of this caliber, but it is what occurred.  So, you take the grandiose excitement of the music and couple it with some sub-par acting and what do you get?  Grace of My Heart in its purest form.

Overall, it is never good to use more than one Fonda in your film.  If you find yourself going with more than one, you should really be reconsidering your options.  Matt Dillon completely ruined this film for me, while my keen eye had a blast picking out today's artists in this film.  I just wish more was developed with Douglas' character.  Why did she continually fall into love with the wrong men?  Did anyone else catch that her creative songs were developed from the suffering of others?  Finally, why did we bring up her family's fortune if it was never used throughout the film?  I kept waiting for her to use her family money to build upon the climax of the film, but it never happened.  I felt cheated, as I did several times during this film.  It wasn't a bad movie by any means, but it just wouldn't stand out in a crowd.  Grace of My Heart is the wallflower of the cinematic world.

1235922,5,B00000JMOE,"Excellent movie, with a cast that fit their parts exceptionally. Illeana Douglas was excellent. I wish I could have played her part. I enjoyed the movie so much that I have watched it over and over, plus I purchased the movie soundtrack. I can't get enough of it. I grew up listening to Motown, and the sweet ballads of the 60's and 70's, so this was right up my alley. Two thumbs up to Allison Anders. At first, I had a hard time determining if this was a true story or not, it was put together so well. Having family who were part of the show business world since the 20's, I was so pleased with a story I felt I could truly relate to, though the story is not my own...though I wish it was.",1107561600,,692,4.095588235294118

Many 'stars' of this era are parodied here, and those familiar with the music of the 60's will immediately recognize the characters portrayed.  The original music is beautiful, and recorded with incredible authenticty.  John Turturro is marvelous as the New York hot-shot music publisher, carefully nurturing his latest discovery, a female songwriter (played by Illeana Douglas) who turns out hit after hit and makes a fortune for herself and the publishing company, but wants only to make her own record as a singer. ""Denise"" finally gets to do just that, but only after losing two husbands and for a short while, her own mind.

I've found since then that John Turturro is a chameleon, changing physically with each character.  I'll never forget Illeana D. in this role--like one of your reviewers said, it's hard to believe she wasn't singing the songs.  I loved the music of all the groups in this movie--wish all of the songs were included on the music cd.  The girl who sings ""God Give Me Strength""  was fantastic!  As were all singers in this movie.  Matt Dillon, Eric Stoltz, & Bruce Davison were excellent, as always.  Christina Pickles & Bridget Fonda were great in their small parts, also as usual.  I was disappointed that Leonard Maltin gave this movie only 2 1/2 stars, but he does that for a lot of movies that I like.  I watched this movie at late night on HBO or some cable channel about two years ago, & became addicted to it, & guess I also infected my daughter.  I have ordered a dvd for both of us for Xmas--am looking forward to seeing all the extras.  I thought that Edna served as a symbol of the growth of rock music from the early sixties through the eighties.  Also, it showed the treatment of a woman in this industry, although probably not as really hard as it was.  And, it showed the relationship struggles that real women go through every day.  But, it was the music that makes this movie so great for me, & the portrayal of this music & the music business by the great actors.",1007942400,12,1533,4.345070422535211
1235926,5,B00000JMOE,"'Grace of My Heart' was a wonderful movie, with a poigniant message. It chronicals the life of Edna (Illeana Douglas) through the music that she writes. Illeana Douglas gives a stirring performance, she seems to age along with the character, as if the movie had actually been made over 12 years (the amount of time the movie covers). John Turturro masters his role as Joel, to the point of making you forget he is the same man who played chess in 'The Luhzin Defence' or stuttered on television in 'Quiz Show'. Matt Dillon also creates an unforgetable character.
Grace of My Heart makes you feel all of the right emotions you can feel in a movie: joy, sadness, shock, humor, suspense and also feel content. Its realism is surprising, while its ideal-worldishness is masterful. It blends the shock of the real world with a utopian zest that very few movies can gracefully achieve.
