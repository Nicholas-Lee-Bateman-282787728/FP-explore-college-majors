7827062,3,6302494729,"Serials about flying were always popular, and coming right in the middle of World War II this one involving German spies must have been a big hit.  Unfortunately the plot is rather muddled.  The four young men of the title are suspected of murder--against all odds, because it should be more than obvious that they didn't do it.  Then they somehow wind up in Africa for no particularly good reason.  The twists and turns seem to exist for no other reason than to extend the serial a few more chapters.  By the time it meanders to the end the climax falls pretty flat, and you almost don't care that the villain gets caught.

Most of the four kids had never done a serial and never did again.  Johnny Downs had been a member of the Our Gang comedies in the 1920's.  Even though he never made it big he appeared in almost 100 movies, most memorably in a small role in which he did a great tap dance for George Gershwin in ""Rhapsody in Blue.""  Bobby Jordan was a member of the Dead End Kids and the East Side Kids, and died of cirrhosis at the age of 42.  For Ward Wood, this was his first movie.  The only one of the four who repeatedly appeared in serials was William Benedict (Tim Tyler's Luck, Captain Marvel, Perils of Nyoka), a former Bowery Boy, who had a long film career that lasted until 1988.

The real star is Robert Armstrong, who became a big star ten years earlier as the lead in ""King Kong.""  This was his final serial, appearing earlier in ""Sky Raiders"" and ""Gang Busters.""  The great Eduardo Cianelli (The Mysterious Dr. Satan, Sky Raiders) is well remembered as one of the all-time great serial villains, though he's basically the number two bad guy in this one and never really does much.  Jennifer Holt (""Hop Harrigan"") was the co-star of innumerable Westerns in the 1940's and the daughter of legendary serial tough-guy Jack Holt (""Holt of the Secret Service"") as well as the sister of Western hero Tim Holt (""Treasure of the Sierra Madre"").

As usual, Universal's cliffhangers are average at best.  Looking at some chapter openings, you wouldn't know there had even been a cliffhanger in the previous chapter.  There is at least one big cheat:  In Chapter Three an elevator plunges toward a fire and explodes; turns out the elevator stopped and there was no explosion.  Otherwise, the cliffhangers are hardly worthy of the name.",1341014400,2,2348,4.57177033492823
7827063,4,6302494729,"Universal's three 1943 serials were all quickly produced war propaganda efforts, though not without interest, and a good video edition can make quite a difference in their appreciation.

""Adventures of the Flying Cadets"" is a 13-chapter Universal serial from 1943, with Johnny Downs, Bobby Jordan, William Benedict and Ward Wood as cadets Danny Collins, Jinx Roberts, Zombie Parker and Scrapper McKay, at a private flying school run by Major William Elliot (Charles Trowbridge).  This is something like the ""Dead End Kids"" serials, with the cadets trying to deal with the bad guys directly, since they are accused of involvement in the murder of Major Elliot.  The crime was committed by ""The Black Hangman,"" thought to be a Nazi, but actually consulting engineer Arthur Galt (Robert Armstrong), who is working with the Nazis.  This is revealed to the audience early in the serial; he controls the caves of An-Kar-Ban in Africa, a source of a war material that he wants to sell to the Nazis.  Galt has been murdering others who were involved in the expedition to find the caves since one of them may know what they contain.  The Nazis, led by Kurt von Heiger (Eduardo Ciannelli) want to take over the operation, rather than deal with a middleman, and plan on disposing of Galt once he is forced to reveal the location of the caves.  The cadets eventually flee to Africa with Galt, whom they believe is in danger from The Black Hangman.  And there is a female character involved in the plot, Andre Mason (Jennifer Holt) but it takes her until Chapter Five to show up, having escaped from Galt's guards at the caves where she and her father have been imprisoned.  Unfortunately she is ""rescued"" by another Nazi, Herman Klott (Philip Van Zandt), claiming to be an American so he can get her to reveal the location of the caves.

Despite an obviously low budget, this serial appears to have been made with a little more care than others at the time from Universal and the direct propaganda is toned down considerably from that in ""Junior G-Men of the Air"" of the previous year.  The special effects are not as obviously flawed as they are in other Universal serials, though still far from what was achieved at Republic.  Dialogue isn't bad; even the acted-out chapter introductions are kept to a reasonable length, though some of the actors could have used help with German diction.  There are only a few recycled cliffhangers from earlier serials, and the variety is enhanced by use of stock footage with plenty of explosions, if some of it a little mismatched with the situations.  It takes a few chapters for the rather complicated plot to get off the ground, and it is hard to believe that Galt isn't immediately the prime suspect, though at least the proving of his guilt is handled well.  While the level of back-stabbing among the Nazis is also incredible, it helps in leading to their defeat.  Top honors for acting go to Eduardo Ciannelli, who even gets to engage in a little humor.

VCI's edition, # 8325 is on two discs, and while far from a pristine print, the gray scale is good enough, the image is fairly sharp and has been cleaned up reasonably well.  There is a slight bend near the top of the screen, possibly dependent on monitor characteristics, believed due to a copy-protection scheme though it usually isn't annoying.  The opening titles are all the same except the first, with the MPPDA certificate number changing from Chapter One's 9281 to 9284 and then back to 9281, apparently due to a slight difference in length of the first chapter titles, but a good simulation of the originals.  The sound isn't especially good, with a lot of wavering high frequency response noted in the song accompanying the opening (and closing) titles, but the rest is quite adequate; no problems understanding the dialogue.  The only ""extras"" are nine serial movie trailers, which are interesting but do not include ""Adventures of the Flying Cadets.""

Alpha's edition, # ALP 4789D on a single disc, is low in price but not worth the savings.  The image is fairly fuzzy and too large, with quite a bit of it off-screen, and there are a lot of scratches, dirt and splices.  Most of the opening titles have the correct MPPDA certificate numbers, but the oversized image puts them so close to the edge of the screen that they can't normally be read.  The titles are otherwise in pretty sorry shape, and often the opening is clipped.  Gray scale isn't bad; faces do not go blank, but not as good as the VCI edition.  Further, Alpha puts their logo on-screen during the credits, moving it around to different corners, presumably to prevent pirating of the disc, though the poor image quality should take care of that issue.  The sound is a worse problem, distorted in most chapters, enough to make some of the dialogue hard to understand.  No ""extras"" are provided except a catalog of Alpha's video releases.

While far below the quality of any of Republic's serials from 1943, even ""The Masked Marvel,"" this one profits from Universal's strength in complexity of plot and dialogue, and there is enough action to keep up interest, at least in 20-minute doses.  But it is a lot more tolerable in VCI's edition than Alpha's; my 4-star rating has one star added for what VCI was able to do with the available print.

Update, 26 August 2013: VCI's DVD is no longer shown on their website.  Sinister Cinema has the serial, but only on VHS, the picture quality being about like Alpha's though the sound has much less distortion.",1301702400,5,5517,4.755508919202518

7827065,3,6302494729,"VCI continues its impressive lineup of DVD serial releases with THE ADVENTURES OF THE FLYING CADETS (1943), a 13-episode Universal chapterplay.

Four young flying students are accused of the murder of a commanding officer; he was actually done in by a mysterious Nazi saboteur known as the Black Hangman. To clear their good names (and they're called Danny, Jinx, Scrapper, and Zombie, four good names if I've ever heard them), the four Air Cadets track the Nazis across land, sea, and air, eventually unmasking the Hangman and forcing a showdown at a secret African helium mine.

Universal released a new serial starring the Dead End Kids/Little Tough Guys once a year from 1940 through 1942. I suspect FLYING CADETS was written for the DEK/LTGs, but it ended up utilizing the services of only Bobby Jordan, who hadn't appeared with his Dead End Kids mates in any of the earlier serials. The other three cadets are the familiar Johnny Downs and Billy Benedict and the unfamiliar Ward Wood; the supporting cast includes Eduardo Ciannelli, Robert Armstrong, the lovely Jennifer Holt, and the ever-popular Regis Toomey.

Like most of the later Universal serials, you'll find plenty of stock footage; a Greek chorus of minor characters who begin each chapter by talking about what's going on (was this cheaper than the beloved ""scrawl"" that began BUCK ROGERS and earlier Universal chapterplays?); and a little too much plot to be healthy in a serial. It's also surprising that we, the audience out there in movieland, are let in on the identity of the Black Hangman very early in the game, although that may have been because there's no mistaking who it is under that mask. It's fun to watch the scheming Axis Huns double-cross themselves on an ongoing basis; there's no honor amongst Nazis, it seems. I also liked the way Ciannelli blusters about the Cadets: ""Those idiots! Those dummkopffs! They've outsmarted us again!"" The biggest laugh, however, is reserved for those times in which the Nazis refer to the Black Hangman as ""Der Shvartz Hanker"", which, gosh darn it, is just hilarious, you'll have to trust me. Oh, and there's also a peppy ""Air Cadets"" theme song that plays over the opening Cadet credits, so be forewarned. It'll stick to your brain the way peanut butter sticks to the roof of your mouth.

THE ADVENTURES OF THE FLYING CADETS is officially a rather pedestrian serial (the participation of the other Dead End Kids/Little Tough Guys would've helped immeasurably), but the DVD is very good and contains a slew o' really fun serial trailers. Recommended.",1104451200,10,2569,4.953596287703016
