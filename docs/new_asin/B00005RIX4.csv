7952447,4,B00005RIX4,"It was nice to see Brandy Davis again...I'd developed a devotion to her in her Surrender Cinema outings, Pleasurecraft and Virtual Encounters 2. In those works she was blonde, and lovely. In this one, she's a brunette, and seems more ""serious"" in this role. She's lovely, no matter what her hair color!",1215993600,2,302,4.826923076923077
7952448,4,B00005RIX4,"Very good movie just as the other reviewers said.  One of the things that makes an Unrated movie better is the number of below the waist shots, this movie basically has none which is its greatest down fall.",1209254400,2,206,4.421052631578948
7952449,4,B00005RIX4,"This movie focuses on Maria (Brandy Davis).  Maria and her boyfriend Dylan (Danny Pape) are experiencing trouble in their relationship.  Dylan accuses Maria of being sexually inhibited.  One day, Brandy comes home to find that Dylan has invited another woman, complete with a big red bow, to engage in a lesbian tryst with Maria.  Shocked at the thought, Maria tells the woman to leave.  After this incident, Maria leaves Dylan and finds her own apartment.

Upon moving in, Maria settles down with a glass of wine and looks out the window.  To her amazement, the window of her neighbor's apartment across from her's is wide open, and Maria sees the couple inside making love.  Intrigued, Maria grabs her camera, but she doesn't snap any pictures.  However, Elise (McKayla Matthews), Maria's very uninhibited neighbor knocks on her door and tells Maria she saw what she was doing.  Embarassed, Maria admits her actions, but Elise is not mad; she is intrigued.  The two women strike up a friendship, and Elise asks Maria to photograph her and her boyfriend.

When the photos come back, Elise is very impressed with them, and she gives Maria the name of an erotic photographer who might be interested in them.  Maria takes the photos to Jacob, the photographer, and he is indeed impressed with Maria's work.  But he's also impressed with Maria herself.  Soon, the two are involved in a sexual relationship of their own.

Maria continues to work on her photography, and she is becoming very good at it.  With Jacob's help, she is fast becoming a recognized erotic photographer, and soon her work is hanging in some of the same galleries as Jacob's.  However, Maria begins to long for Dylan.  She eventually realizes that she is meant to be with him.

When I first started watching this movie, I was surprised that it was so explicit.  I guess the ""unrated"" label should have given me a clue.  The story is surprisingly good.  Maria's story is well-developed, and the world of erotic photography is shown in a way so the viewer can follow very easily.  As for the acting, I thought Brandy Davis did a very good job as Maria.  Watching her ""discover"" herself was one of the best parts of the film.  Danny Pape did an ok job as Dylan, but he is limited somewhat due to the lack of time he is actually involved in the story.

I enjoyed this movie and I recommend it.  Be warned that there is considerable nudity and sexual situations, so it is definitely not suitable for younger viewers.",1138147200,17,2480,4.7046511627906975
7952450,3,B00005RIX4,"Carnal Sins is a so-so, erotic movie about Maria, (Brandy Davis) a professional photographer, who doesn't quite feel comfortable with the sexual relationship she has with her fianc, Dylan, (Danny Pape). When Dylan finds out that Maria feels that she is sexually inhibited, he hires a lady to engage in a lesbian tryst with Maria, who after being shocked upon returning home to a naked lady with a big red bow, while Dylan grins, sends the lady packing.

After that Maria decides she needs a little breathing room and moves into an apartment. On her first night in her new apartment she observes her next door neighbors in flagrante delicto through their uncovered picture windows. She doesn't take any pictures but she does view the action through her 35MM viewfinder to see what it would look like.

The next day she meets a well known photographer of erotica named Jacob who encourages Maria to do some erotic photography of her own. he becomes her mentor and confidant by helping her with her sexuality. As Maria becomes more and more drawn to Jacob her eye for nude photography and her sexual freedom are discovered. Meanwhile Elise (McKayla Mathews) the love making neighbor visits Maria. She tells her that she saw her taking pictures. After finding out that Maria didn't actually take pictures, the disappointed but apparently uninhibited Elise, invites her to take pictures that night.

Maria goes on to take the pictures of Elise and her husband both through their window and directly in front of her in her apartment, then she begins an affair with Jacob as she gets inextricably drawn into the world of nude photography, shedding her inhibitions along the way. Eventually her nude photography begins to be noticed and the studio that exhibits Jacob's work, starts to hang Maria's

Keeping in mind that this is a softcore movie, I found the plot and acting to be reasonably credible. As for the cast, I found McKayla Matthews to be a sexy turn on. Brandy Davis was nice too but her diminutive size didn't do as much for me. The fianc, Danny Pape, who didn't have that big of a part, would probably be considered a hunk but the erotic photographer Anthony Skordi certainly wouldn't. The movie was directed by Madison Moore and lasts ninety minutes and is unrated.

When judging a softcore movie, I grade on a curve. I rate these movies against other movies within the adult movie field. These films tend to have low budgets, less experienced actors, if actors at all, and the screenplays tend to be unbelievable or hokey. The obvious purpose of these movies and I don't believe anyone would watch them for any other reason, is to provoke sexual excitement. (the defintion of pornography) With those things in mind, I found the movie to be average and rated Carnal Sins, three stars.",1136073600,7,2791,4.80625
