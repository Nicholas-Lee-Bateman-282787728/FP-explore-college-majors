8563998,4,B00B84B1DC,"I ordered this DVD to learn more about the capabilities of miniature table saws.  Of course, much time is devoted to safety and nomenclature.  Although the Preac saw is no longer being made, the DVD showed the features and setups for common mini table saw tasks - crosscutting, ripping, grooves, dados, rabbets, setting blade height, etc. Although I am a table saw novice, I am going to bite the bullet and purchase a Byrnes saw soon for model shipbuilding, and watching this DVD gave me confidence that I can operate a mini saw safely.

On the minus side, several references were made to other table saw tasks, projects, and procedures - for later -  that never materialized.  I was not sure if they were supposed to be included on this DVD, or another - but the DVD ended without this info.  Also mentioned were links to the author's custom products for the Preac saw, and hints of more advanced tasks - which I could not find either.

Although a little pricey, I found this DVD a worthy addition to my library - mostly because it shows the mini table saw as a not-scary tool to be feared, but a precise instrument that can be mastered (with care and practice) by a novice.  I am sure that I will reference the DVD when I finally get my new Byrnes saw.",1411084800,,1254,4.445414847161572
