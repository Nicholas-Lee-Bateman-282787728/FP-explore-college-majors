7946515,4,B00005N90F,"I bought this collection as a gift for my husband who wanted 3000 Miles to Graceland. We are big fans of Kevin Costner, so when I found this collection I decided to get it! I love the movie Tin Cup. It seems like a boring watch, after all it is about golf, but Kevin Costner's cheeky character gives it tons of humor. I would recommend all of these movies to anybody who's a fan of Kevin Costner. The cases that the movies come in are a bit wimpy. There aren't any extras on the DVDs that I've noticed, but the movies are in good shape and the cases will work out alright.",1419811200,3,572,4.116071428571429

I was very surprised with 3000 Miles... good movie, I highly recommend it to Costner fans and to anyone who likes kind of off-the-wall crime movies",1195344000,4,211,4.410256410256411
