7904411,4,B000006GOW,It is an entertaining VHS film created by Jack Nicklaus and a TV station.  He chose 18 memorable holes of golf courses in the world and takes us a tour on each one of them.  He demonstrates actual swing and how he would approach each hole.  Golfers would love this VHS.,1370649600,,269,4.235294117647059
