8161402,5,B000LC4ZN0,"Paul gilbert is one of the better guitar shredders of our era, from racer x/mr. big and
solo stuff, hes never fails to shine and in this video he teaches some of his techniques
which is informative!!!!",1380758400,,201,4.45945945945946
8161403,5,B000LC4ZN0,"Excellent content and instruction from a guitar virtuoso. It's not for newbies. You really need some chops to keep up with the material. You need to be able to throw down all the chords anywhere on the fretboard (major, minor, sus, add, 7s, 9s 13s) and you need to be fluent and fast in all the scale modes especially the mixolydian. Mr Gilbert is a great teacher and his laid back manner will make you want to play and practice more, but this video is for pro musicians.",1371081600,2,471,4.363636363636363
8161404,5,B000LC4ZN0,"The Lord of Shred Guitar returns for a 3rd time in Terrifying Guitar Trip to show us how to do it right! This video is excellent for all types of guitar player levels but I definitely recommend it for intermediate to advanced players. He does a tad less explanation here than usual (assuming you've already seen his previous titles) but being the superb teacher that he is, even beginners will have a lot to keep them busy. Definitely worth buying. Extra footage of PG in studio, concert, and just chilling with the band (Mr. Big at the time) are great. A must have for shredders and PG fans!",1248825600,3,592,4.4907407407407405
8161405,5,B000LC4ZN0,This DVD is an excellent choice for intermediate players.  Paul is an amazing player and also an amazing teacher.  Mind the crazy backgrounds and whatnot and you will learn quite a bit from this dvd.  Glad I made this purchase!,1179100800,5,227,4.625
8161406,4,B000LC4ZN0,"One thing about Paul Gilbert, he's a great great guitar player. The production values are pretty cheezy on this DVD but the instruction is presented in simple concepts which anyone who is not a beginner can get something from. Gilbert does not try to impress you with fancy discussions of modes or technical concepts and breaks his lessons into little bits and pieces. Included are several in concert videos which show Gilbert at his best. Yes, it's one of the better instructional DVD's that I've bought",1176163200,9,504,4.872093023255814
