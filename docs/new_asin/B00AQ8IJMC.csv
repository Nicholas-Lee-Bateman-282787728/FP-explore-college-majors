8556270,2,B00AQ8IJMC,"I am the number one Carpenters fan in the world I think, own every album, compilation and DVD. I've made excuses for some of the recent documentaries and live in concert releases. However there are no excuses I can make for this low budget travesty. It's just a mess from start to finish. To start with the title is misleading. I thought I was getting a copy of the old VH1 documentary from their Behind the Music series from years ago that I loved so much. Instead what I end up with is commentary from 4 British industry insiders whom I've never heard of. So many of their comments ranged from questionable  to flat out untrue. They completely skipped over Karen's solo album and their phenomenally successful Christmas Portrait album, not to mention the very successful TV specials (1976-80). The only reason I am not rating this a bomb is because it contains snippets of Karen's tremendous voice. I owe so much to Karen. Her voice got me through so many tough times during my adolescence. I loved her from afar. I miss her and I always will. Karen and Richard deserve so much more than this tripe. Do not by this disc. Spend your money on two truly great dvd's: Close To You Remembering the Carpenters and Carpenters Gold.",1362355200,14,1226,4.572727272727272
