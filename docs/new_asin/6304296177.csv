7870040,5,6304296177,"I would definately purchase from The Book Worm again.  I ordered Run for the Dream - The Gail Devers Story [VHS] because it was not available on dvd and I am very glad I did.  They got this movie, which was an excellent movie, to me in great condition (brand new.. still in package) and was shipped to me in a timely manner as promised.  They also included a very nice hand written note thanking me for my business.  Definately the type of people I want to do business with and would absolutely recommend them to others.  Thanks for caring about your customers!!",1343952000,,562,4.41747572815534
