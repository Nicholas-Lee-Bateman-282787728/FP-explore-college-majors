Spanish born vocalist Pedrito Rico himself (1931-1988) easily deserves 5 superbright stars for his delightful unique vocal recordings (even if you don't understand the language). Two CDs of 24 tracks each are currently available with infectious rhythms and colorful orchestrations, punctuated with the rata-tat-tat of flamenco heels and finger snapping. Wildly popular in Spanish-speaking countries, in the mid 1960s he also conquered New York at the Chateau Madrid and on the Ed Sullivan Show. He made maybe a half dozen films, and retired early.

This DVD is a worn print of his first film (1957). Even the soundtrack has lost its luster, and the 7 songs suffer. Originally filmed in Vision Panoramica and Ferraniacolor, the movie emerges here 4:3 and b/w, probably a tv relic. Production values are mediocre as a young singing man of the people is discovered, groomed by a hard task master, finds romance, and still loves Mama.

Senor Rico is NOT photogenic, so more sensitive lighting, camera work, and wardrobe would have been a help. He is disproportionate, with a large head (say, young Orson Welles) and a small body (say, Joey Heatherton, when he's cinched into tight flamenco pants). He also does some modest heel tapping, but I would say on his recordings the spirited footwork is added by a professional.

But understand me: This fellow was/is a great vocalist whose personal appearances wowed the audiences and whose recordings are simply irresistible (Amazon offers some MP3 downloads). I hope his subsequent movies did him justice.",1259280000,,1569,5.189723320158103
