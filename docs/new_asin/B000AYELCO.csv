2397063,5,B000AYELCO,"An in-depth review of this film must include crucial plot details, so if you don't like ""spoilers"" please stop reading now.  Some reviewers of this film have misinterpreted the writer's vision.  Ostensibly a standard gay comedy, Almost Normal would be rather forgettable, if it wasn't also a social satire, designed to illustrate what it's like to be gay in a straight world.  As satire, it succeeds very well, and in some ways as brilliantly as one could hope to expect.  In spots, the plot is too confusing to produce the intended impact, but I give it an A for effort.

Brad is nice-looking, single, gay, on the cusp of his 40th birthday, and somewhat discontent.  He ogles sports jocks when they're not looking, goes on dates with guys who are miles below his desirability level, and frequently argues with his best friend Julie, who is also his sister-in-law.  At a party for his parents' 45th wedding anniversary, things have just about hit the boiling point.  A reunion with his best high school buddy reminds him that his friend stopped talking to him when he came out.  His mother still dreams that he'll find some nice girl, and as he remarks to Julie, sometimes he just wishes that he was ""normal"".  Not that he dislikes being gay, but he is weary of being different from the heterosexuals that surrounded him.  As a gay man, I found it easy to identify with this sentiment.

Events at the party annoy him so much that he gets drunk, even though he recently gave up alcohol.  Seeking some fun, he slips out of the party and drives to a local gay cruising area, where he crashes his car into a tree.  As we suspect (and our suspicions are confirmed much later in the film) much of the remainder of the film is a dream sequence that plays in his mind while he lies unconscious in a hospital.  And what a dream!

Brad dreams that when he wakes the next morning, something unexplainable has happened.  He has traveled back in time to the 1970's, and is now an 18 year old high school student.  But that's not all.  He has gotten his wish to be ""normal"" because everyone in the world is gay!  Except, of course, those outcasts who are emotionally and physically attracted to members of the opposite sex.  Known pejoratively as ""breeders"" and ""hole-punchers"", heterosexuals in Brad's dream world are routinely ostracized, scorned and even ""straight bashed"".  They are preached against, misunderstood, and subjected to extreme ignorance and isolation.  Pardon my gloating, but as a gay man, I found this a most delicious and righteous turn-about on reality.

It was also highly satisfying to see a world where gay people are totally free, and stand proudly with their chosen partners before the entire world.  In Brad's dream, there is no such thing as homophobia, and for a wonderful moment I allowed myself to be caught up in this glorious if absurd fantasy. Conversely, I can only imagine what it must be like for a straight person to absorb the basic premise of Brad's dream world - heterosexuals may find it strange, disjointing and probably fear-inducing.  Homosexual propaganda?  Yes!  And highly effective.

A myriad of plot problems are resolved with witty or sometimes silly explanations.  In his dream, Brad's parents have same-sex partners, but his father and mother begat him through a custom known as ""birth partners"" where best friends of opposite sexes have children solely to reproduce, although romance and sexual desire between the sexes is taboo and ""disgusting"".

Here's where Brad's dream gets dicey and somewhat confusing.  Enter his sister-in-law, Julie.  Although Brad has found his soul-mate, a basketball jock he had a crush on in High School in his ""real"" life, Brad slowly begins to realize that he is sexually attracted to Julie, and she to him.  For a while, I was a bit uncomfortable with this plot twist, until I realized that the writer was cleverly engineering a take on the real-life terror, isolation, rejection and ultimate acceptance that virtually all gay people experience when they discover the truth of their own sexuality.  Brad and Julie go to an underground ""straight"" bar, witness a violent ""straight bashing"" and ultimately attend their high school dance, where they demand acceptance.  Many reviewers were confused by the dance scene.  When Brad and Julie are denied permission to dance together (""We have to tolerate your kind, but we don't have to put up with your disgusting behavior"") many of the on-looking gay couples (including some of the faculty) begin to dance with opposite sex partners, in a show of solidarity and tolerance.  Some reviewers of this film thought that this signaled a reversal of Brad's fantasy dream, and that ""everybody starts turning straight"".  Some even saw it as an argument that sexual orientation is a choice, but that's not what I got out of it - I saw it as a simple show of support for a persecuted minority.

The ""gay reversal argument"" has been used before, but not quite so effectively.  In ""Torch Song Trilogy"", Harvey Fierstein begins an impassioned speech to his mother by saying, ""Ma, imagine what it would be like if everyone around you was gay; every book, every magazine..."" and Anne Bancroft, replies, ""You're talking crazy!""  Almost Normal expands this argument to its conclusion.  Of course, no heterosexual can ever truly understand what it's like to be gay in a straight world.  But in the end, I found much of this movie powerfully persuasive, and I wanted to round up all my straight friends and family and make them watch it.  The final scenes reverted to standard gay comedy, but there was a nice romantic twist at the end I didn't see coming.  That part I'll leave for you to discover, for I do recommend that you see it and decide for yourself.  I left with a smile on my face and my head full of thought, and that's never a bad thing.",1132358400,56,5848,4.7846460618145565

2397066,2,B000AYELCO,"The idea to make the whole world upside down in terms of sexuality is more than luring. It could have been a very good film. But it's not :(
Well, acting is far from good. Some people behave odd and artificial in front of cameras (just to mention Brad's parents). Some dialogues are wooden and really boring.
I also don't buy Mr. Keitch as a professor - I hope I will look as young in my early 40's as he did in his. If you decide to move your action back in time, you have two options. Either you hire two actors to play the part or you invest more in make-up.
The plot is sometimes not clear - the whole thing with one of the students? First he seems to hit on our boring professor, and then? He says he's not gay...Hmmm.
Or the one with brothers. Brad goes back in time, but we don't meet his siblings. As if he suddenly became the only child. The only scene where we actually see the oldest bro is almost at the end. Strange.

I do believe that the authors had good intentions. Unfortunately, the result is far from being good.",1307750400,2,1031,4.155
2397067,4,B000AYELCO,"The basic idea of the movie is fairly simple - what if we could alter just one element of the world? In this case it is the idea of what ""normal"" from the point of view of sexuality that is altered. Heterosexuality becomes a perversion while homosexuality is the socially established norm. Sounds weird? Well, you can see the movie and check how it works.
Brad Jenkins (played by Andrew Keitch) a university proffesor approaching 40 crashes his car while visiting his family. When he regains his consciousness he realizes he found himself (in a little ""Back to the Future"" style) in a parallel universe where everyone is gay and Brad himself is a teenager again. Will he be happy now that he is (although he stays as gay as he was in the world he came from) normal?
The script tries to make the most of this, not always successfully but just well enough to make it a light and pleasant viewing and (should you be watching this in a straight company) a little thought-provoking too.",1284508800,,981,4.548022598870056
2397068,5,B000AYELCO,"It's possible to like how a movie begins and how it ends but not the middle development? The story is a clear homage to Back to the Future, so clear that even the main character, Brad, named more than once the movie and Michael J. Fox. Brad is a forty years old repressed gay guy; he was gay also in high school, but he has never had the courage to really come out. Brad likes men, and with men he means that he likes men who behave like men, and that obviously don't like men themself. In high school he had a crush on the basketball hero jock, the dream of all the cheerleaders. At 40 years old, Brad still continues to like the jock type that doesn't like him. The problem is not that Brad is gay, the problem is not that people don't accept him, the problem is that Brad doesn't accept himself. He sees being gay as being not normal, and he wants to be normal.

Due to a car accident, Brad is brough back to high school, only that now the world is upside down, every one else is gay and Brad can finally fall in love and being loving back by his dream date, Roland. But since, as said before, the problem was not Brad being gay, but Brad that was not accepting himself, when every one else is ""not normal"", Brad obviously is now normal, means that, instead of falling in love for the jock, he falls in love for the cheerleader. It's not the world that has to accept Brad, it's Brad that has to accept himself.

Lucky for the gay romance movie fans, the movie has a better ending than expected.",1278288000,,1497,4.176470588235294
2397069,2,B000AYELCO,"I bought this after seeing the preview; it's not even remotely funny. I felt that the wrong actors were chosen; I didn't connect or feel for any of the characters; plus the dialogue needed work. Too many lines which seem to have been added in by a b-movie script writer. Don't buy, maybe rent.",1276560000,2,293,4.444444444444445
2397070,5,B000AYELCO,"Gosh who would ever thunk? ALMOST NORMAL was filmed entirely in Nebraska! Not the sort of fare one expects from the Cornhusker State, which makes it all the more delightfully entertaining.

This is one under-the-radar-kool low-budget flick with better than average production values. I especially appreciated the scored background music (full orchestra no less), and the atmospheric night platform scene at the (Lincoln?) railroad station. For  connoisseurs of good looks, there's plenty of worthwhile eye candy regardless of your orientation.

ALMOST NORMAL is a cinematic bon-bon that you just KNOW you're gonna want to watch more than once. With the stellar and oh-so-very-unique plot line, there's too much detail to successfully absorb and appreciate on only the first go around.

To cut to the chase and summarize: this one's a winner.",1250899200,,841,5.396946564885496

2397072,3,B000AYELCO,"This low budget dramedy is a real odd duck. The premise is an homage to the Kathleen Turner film Peggy Sue Gets Married - a forty-ish college professor (J. Andrew Keitch) has a car accident and wakes up to find himself back in high school but in a world where it's considered normal to be gay and aberrant to be straight. The queer thing (no pun intended) about the story is that, in the bizarro world, where he finally has a shot at the straight jock he'd longed for in the real world, instead he falls for his sister-in-law (Joan Lauckner), who had harbored a secret crush on him in real life. Naturally they're found out, ostracized and he is ""straight-bashed,"" making for plenty of opportunities for indignant speechifying. But all that seemed minor in the scheme of things. The big problem I had with this one is...what exactly is the point? Once a misfit, always a misfit?

There are some affecting performances, particularly Keitch and Lauckner and overall, the production values seem fairly high for an indie.  Unfortunately, much of the humour (satirizing homophobia) is a bit tired  and a spiel near the end decrying prejudice seemed extremely strident and unnecessary, since one is safe to assume everyone watching the film is probably gay friendly already.

Not awful. Just don't expect too much.",1202774400,2,1308,4.825892857142857

Very unusal concept. Funny, well thought out production, well written and all the actors are very believable in their respective roles. Great ending. Very enjoyable film. If you want to watch something that will put a smile on your face and make you laugh this is a must have for you. Different from anything I have ever seen.

The use of local people from Lincoln High School and Nebraska State University made this movie really genuine. Aside from Brad's mom's wigs, I thought the movie was convincing and extremely heart warming.  I am sick of seeing the same old campy stuff that's continually shoveled in our faces all the time.  My hat's off to the director, producers and all those who VOLUNTEERED to make this film a reality.

2397077,4,B000AYELCO,"I just watched this film and found the whole plot rather interesting. The acting isn't the greatest, there isn't enough male nudity (I'm tired of seeing naked women in almost every film I see, but no naked men), but the point of the whole story is well taken. As with most movies involving time travel, I half expect a Borg to pop out of no-where. ;) What caught my attention is the demonstration of how fluid human sexuality can be and how little we really understand about ourselves. Sure, you can turn on PBS and watch the mating habits of almost any other species, but put some humans in there and it's labeled ""pornography"". Alas, such is the paragon of animals. This is a film most teenagers and most adult should watch so that they can experience a new perspective on human life. There will always be ""outsiders"" in human cultures, but maybe movies like this will help all of us be less cruel to them.",1165968000,,908,4.475903614457831
2397078,4,B000AYELCO,"This movie is very different and overall, the reviews I've read here are unfair. While the acting is pretty bad in some points and some of the casting is not real great either, I have to give this film 5 stars for content. The plot is incredible. You get the best of both worlds here. A gay love story with a happy ending, and a straight love story with a happy ending. You get adventure, comedy, and a strong point is made that ""normal"" isn't always easy to attain, even if you had a ""do-over"" knowing what you know now. The main character here finds that there are things in his life that he wouldn't change in order to change the things he is most disturbed about in his life. He remains in the end, the same as he was in the beginning, but his whole outlook has changed about what really matters and what is totally insignificant in life.

I guess your view of this movie will depend on how you judge films. IF the content, or story line is more important to you than technicalities, you will love ""Almost Normal"". If you are more interested in how much money was spent on making it, (obviously not much), whether or not the actors deserve an academy award (which they don't), or how well the cast was put together (in this case, good and bad) then you will find plenty in this film to pick apart. Personally, I like being entertained and challenged by a plot to think about things I might not otherwise consider. This movie provides that. I recommend it highly, but also recommend you view it for it's content, not it's quality, and keep your expectations below the top.",1159747200,3,1575,4.3938356164383565
2397079,2,B000AYELCO,"What a shame. I had high hopes for this movie. It's a terrific concept - every gay man who came of age in the 20th century dreams of returning to high school in the hopes that the past would be different.

What ruins this film? Let's start with the casting. None of the lead actors portraying teens looks young enough. Personally, I found the lead unattractive and way too old for the part. He was also a poor actor who could not emote. Not that the others around him fared better. The parents are the most stilted and ruin every scene.

Next the script. The dialogue is unrealistic. There are plenty of contrived plot elements. Wouldn't it have been more interesting if he had gone back and the jock he lusted after had not had any interest in him at all? The director could have addressed themes of dating and romance within the gay community. The role-reversal with the lead discovering straight feelings seemed heavy-handed.

Maybe because the cast was mostly (if not all) straight, but there was no passion between the players. certainly not between the male leads. Their kiss might as well have been between two brothers. Gay men in love do not kiss like this.

There are far better movies showcasing gay love. I recommend avoiding this substandard flick.",1159401600,3,1261,4.666666666666667
2397080,2,B000AYELCO,"Almost Normal is, as many other reviewers have stated, a play on ""Peggy Sue Got Married""-type of fantasy. It is even sometimes enjoyable, but for the most part it feels like a film school project rather than a real film.

Why?

J. Andrew Keitch (I know I've seen him as a child in other films and television, but such is not listed on IMDB), does an earnest job and a good acting job. A less than superior script and some really horrible acting (Brad's mother for one)pull the movie down though.

I know that a great deal of thought went into the film because the ""fantasy"" sequence when people are normal being gay has some really interesting presentations of ""normalcy"" that I would have not thought to address were I the filmmaker. However, there are some really embarrassingly bad moments in the film. When Brad wrecks his car, there's a little bit of monologue that he says and then he squeals like a girl as begins to wreck - it's all very fake and forced - was the director going for farce here?

Tongue in cheek is awesome and farce has its place, but to try to mix farce in with comedy on film is a huge mistake. It never looks right and it always comes of as amateurish and juvenile.

I really wanted to like the film and I kept watching until he started becoming chummy with his former life sister in law. It just fell apart under its own weight then.

How shallow and ignorant, how arrogant!  The ""critic"" who repeatedly used the word ""sattire"" (sic) can't even SPELL it correctly, much less does he understand what it means.  It's true this film doesn't have the best acting talent and could certainly have been made much better, but look past it at the theme and the way the plot twists get you to think, if you are capable.

2397087,4,B000AYELCO,"Marc Moody has written and directed a film that is so earnest and reaches so high for making a significant statement that it is difficult not to admire the result.  ALMOST NORMAL is so obviously a gay version of 'Back to the Future' by its own admission that it becomes a bit tedious and silly, and when accompanied by low budget and tenuous production values it is a little squeaky in achieving its self-imposed high standards, it comes very close to being a forgettable effort.  So why is it so popular?  It has spirit!

Brad (J. Andrew Keitch in a fine film debut) is a 40-year-old closeted gay college professor in Nebraska who lives in fear of derision and is frustrated he is unable to live his life in a happy relationship.  His good friend Julie (Joan Lauckner) is supportive and encourages Brad to return home for his parent's wedding anniversary.  Brad does so reluctantly, finds the usual homophobic atmosphere and in a moment of weakness, drinks too much and has an auto accident.  Miraculously, when he awakens, he has the appearance of a handsome high school kid and when he wanders into the world he discovers that there has been a major reversal: now it is normal to be gay and grossly distasteful to be a straight breeder.  Even his parents are gay with breeder hosts for procreation purposes.  Brad sees reverse discrimination now, is sought after by the high school jock Roland (Tim Hammer), enjoys the freedom of being openly gay, but meets the now new Julie and is strangely attracted to her, having to hide his  new 'straight alliance' in a new closet. And the resolution of this new dilemma is the message of the film.

Everything about the idea of the film makes the viewer want to love it, and it is  a sweet little diversion of a film with some thinking material about prejudices.  It is rough and hampered by many technical and casting and scripted errors, but it does give newcomer Marc Moody a strong grounding for making further films about gay life that seem to appear like seeds of ideas throughout this film.  It needs polish but it is a good time and offers a wide audience a better perspective on what it feels like to live a life as an outsider.

Adorable gay professor Brad (Andrew Keitch) has a minor break-down when he

turns 40. Not only is he lonely, but his students and his family are

consistently reminding him of both his loneliness and his age--the

familiar lines like, ""Why don't you go out there and date?"" ""My dad would

be a great match for you,"" and ""There's a nice young woman about your age

who hasn't found a husband yet ...."" Then one night, Brad's world is

turned upside down and he finds himself (dreaming) back in high school, only this

time, everyone is gay. The locker rooms are filled with sexual tension,

the cheerleaders are all making out with each other, and the female gym

teacher is the least gay teacher in the place. EVERYTHING is flipped

upside down. It's a gay person's dream come true! Or is it....

This plot is brilliant. We've all (queers, at least) imagined a world like

this -- where American flags turn to rainbow ones and all the heteros in

the world have to feel what it's like to be on the perifery of society.

It's also brilliant becasue it turns out not to be so simple. Brad finds

himself still questioning his sexuality -- only this time, could he

possibly be attracted to girls? On top of a truly entertaining story,

Almost Normal thus raises the important question of whether being queer is

more than just a sexual preference, but also a way of life.

2397094,4,B000AYELCO,"""The minute you accept that you are different is the moment you become normal."" - Brad to Julie in ""Almost Normal"" (2004)

What *is* ""normal"" anyway? That's the question explored in an extremely creative and risky screenplay writen and directed by Marc Moody, and produced by Sharon Teo, who are professors of film at University of Hawaii and University of Nebraska at Lincoln, respectively. Judging by the reviews I have seen posted elsewhere, lots of people completely missed the point of the film, not unreasonable considering the fact that this doesn't really fall into any preconceived notion you would have of gay cinema.

Brad is a forty year old (a ""young 40"" as he would be sure to clarify) gay college professor, who is depressed about entering middle age and still being single. At the start of the film, a colleague fixes him up with a blind date, who turns out to be the type of campy, pretentious queen that is Brad's idea of a ""date from gay hell."" Going home for his parents anniversary party, he runs into his sister-in-law and best confidant Julie, who tries to cheer him while Brad drones on wishing he could be young again and ""normal."" Leaving the party after having too much to drink, Brad is heading for the local gay cruising rest-stop, when he totals his car, but somehow manages to stumble back to his folks house and falls asleep. When he wakes up, he finds that he is back to being an 18 year old high school student, living with his parents and their respective same-sex lovers, in a world that considers same sex love to be the norm, while heterosexuality is a perversion.

His first day back at school brings lots of surprises, including getting wolf whistles from a group of construction workers, finding the gym showers now require you shower with someone of the opposite sex (to avoid same-sex horseplay), and being asked out on a date by Roland, the star basketball player. When Brad's attempt at going back to ""his world"" (a ""Back To The Future""-ish attempt to recreate the circumstances of the car crash) fails, he settles in to his surroundings, and his relationship with Roland gets stronger, even leading to a sweet, innocent proposal. But when Brad finds Julie, now a new student at his school, he finds that he is still not quite ""normal"" by this world's definition, and struggles to reconcile his feelings and preserve his self-esteem.

For a low-budget indie, the film is beautifully made, with a full cast of mostly amateur actors and students from the local Lincoln NE high school as well as the University. The photography is first-rate, the sets perfect for the late '70's to early 80's time frame depicted, and it has an original musical score that adds to the atnosphere. I thought it was well-written, though perhaps a bit complex in story, with some memorable lines, most a reversal of standard phrases one hears about gays (For example, one character in the ""gay"" world mentions that ""If God had wanted men to be with women, He would have made women to like football!"")

Ultimately, the complex story line is the one drawback, especially since the full film has to be looked at in its entirety to get the concept the writer is going for. Details in some scenes may seem extraneous and confusing, until you connect them with what went before or after. Critics loved it or hated it, very little middle ground. Unrated (but could be a PG-13), excellent DVD bonus features include directors' commentary (which I recommend, going through the film for a second time), deleted/extended scenes and outtakes. To me, the film is a brilliant, original gem, and I recommend the extra effort it takes to really appreciate it.",1132876800,6,3665,4.765354330708662

8080474,1,B000AYELCO,"This movie on the surface has a good premise: The main character of this story (a perpetually single, gay, 40 something year old drunk) has been thrust by circumstance into an alternate world, in the past where he is in high school and society has been reversed, gay is normal and straight is not.

He should be in heaven right?  Wrong! You see the writer of this script appears to believe that being gay is a choice cause our main character isn't content with the world being a perfect utopia for him.  Somehow he has flipped a switch because now he is suddenly straight, is sexually attracted to and loves a woman - so he can rebel against society again.

They had a great opportunity to make a feel good movie and I feel they ruined it.",1397952000,,739,4.372262773722627
8080475,5,B000AYELCO,"This one film that was Deja Vue for me.  I experienced so many things in the film as to really put me into a funk of self-pity.  But that was all of yesterday and today is........................  This is one of these What-If films that keeps everybody guessing until the very end.  It is a fantasy that has some very true meanings that are voiced by the main character.  We, in the audience, learn as well as the main character does.  This will make you really appreciate that person next to you, that you love and cherish.  I first viewed the film back in 2008.  It still has quite an effect on me.  LOVE IS A SITUATION OF SO VERY MANY THINGS!  NJMJr!
PS just watched this film for the fifth time.  I guess I am just a incurable romantic!  I still get teary-eyed at the end!  NJMJr!!",1364342400,,785,4.258503401360544

While you would think that the juxtaposition would be interesting any novelty quickly wears off because the acting is so bad.  I really wish I could be kinder to this movie because I wanted to like it but my vocabulary fails me when I attempt to describe how bad this.  Avoid if you can.",1331683200,,411,4.243589743589744
8080477,1,B000AYELCO,"Rather than sit through this abysmally acted and conceived piece of garbage , I'd rather walk into any fast food joint and stick my face in the deep fryer. Sometimes, when things are intentionally bad, they can be amusing (John Waters) but this is just bad. And..boring. And..stupid. It has no idea what it wants to be. Not even shirtless hunks running around was enough to make me endure this waste of a c.d. Maybe a drink coaster?",1331596800,3,432,4.551282051282051
8080478,1,B000AYELCO,"This is such an annoying movie! Maybe there is an audience for it somewhere, but I'm glad I don't know anybody in it.

It pretends to invert the gay/straight imbalance, but it does it so unevenly that it ends up alienating gays even more than we are already. The most annoying inequity: the ONLY sex scene, and the ONLY serious kissing (with tongues, open mouths and credible passion), are between straight couples, although in the world being shown gay is the norm and straight is taboo. The kissing between same-sex couples looks like me kissing my grandmother, every time it happens, and it happens a lot because that's how the movie drives home its insufferably heavy-handed message.

If in a world dominated by people like me (i. e., gay people), the only ones who have good sex and the only ones who are passionately attracted to each other are the straight minority, no wonder the star switches teams so easily and eagerly. The preposterous, predictable ending, which I suppose was meant to surprise and delight us, to force a smile onto our faces and a tear into our eyes as we left the theatre, just made me angrier.

I don't care what point this obnoxious movie was trying to make; I HATED it.",1326412800,2,1203,4.63849765258216
