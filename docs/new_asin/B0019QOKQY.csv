3443321,5,B0019QOKQY,Oh c'mon Arthur is a classic. I bought Season 11 after I bought Season 10 and it just keeps on getting better.,1355270400,,110,4.045454545454546
3443322,5,B0019QOKQY,I'm picky in what my daughter watches on television and PBS always brings such quality entertainment to the table that she and I can watch. I love that the kids depicted in Arthur act like children and work through problems like children do and that each character has their own identity. This season continues to bring quality writing and a quality product and it's fun to watch.,1355184000,,380,4.686567164179104
3443323,3,B0019QOKQY,"I bought these DVDs for my son.  I liked the show when I was smaller, and the Arthur book he had was a big hit at our house, so I thought the DVDs might be a good buy.  There was a lot of emphasis on negative behaviors and only at the very end of the shows was the positive alternative there.  I hear my son repeating D.W.'s rude words.  We stopped watching it.",1340668800,,361,3.904109589041096

PLEASE PRODUCE ALL 15 SEASONS OF ARTHUR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1318377600,4,293,5.659090909090909
3443326,4,B0019QOKQY,As usual the Arthur stories are age appropriate and have a message for our little ones. We use them at school on days when the children have to come in early (below zero or pouring) and have a few minutes before the regular schedule begins. The length of the stories are just right. It is also a nice way to quiet them down so that they are ready to focus on their next task. The themes are also a good jumping off point for discussion or creative writing.,1300838400,,456,4.193181818181818

3443408,5,B0019QOKQY,"This set of DVDs is so helpful in my special education classroom.  The students like to watch Barney, but Barney is really not age-appropriate for students aged 14-18 years (developmentally about 3-4 years).  Arthur and his friends do things at school at home, have social situations that are more age-appropriate than the usual primary cartoon.  The social stories are easy for my students to follow once they concentrate.  It was very difficult to find new Arthur DVDs at this time and I am very grateful to Amazon for carrying them.
Many years ago, I met Marc Brown at the Children`s museum in Boston and his Arthur DVDs are so perfect for my audience.

3443421,5,B0019QOKQY,"Having not grown up during Arthur's first run in the 1990's, I was not familiar with the books or tv show. As an adult I love this show. Usually kids want to watch things over and over and this show does not get boring or tiresome to an adult, even when watching with your kids. The story lines cover many social, ethical and life lessons topics in a respectful and fun way for kids. Sometimes too many stories that cover every social issue, as not to leave anyone out. Predictable stories that are resolved in ten minutes. Great for young kids with short attention spans. Stays contemporary even after almost 20 years.",1363737600,,619,4.535714285714286
