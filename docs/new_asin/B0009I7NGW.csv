2291146,4,B0009I7NGW,"I am a big Star Trek fan and I enjoyed the idea of going back to where it all began, 150 years from now but also 150 years before the original with Capt. Kirk and crew.  The problem I have is the continuing story line that started at the end of season 2.  There are too many shows on TV where you have to have seen the previous show to know what's going on.  It works for Deadwood and Desparate Housewives, but not for Enterprise.  They tried to fix this in season 4 where they were like a series of mini series, but I much prefer stand alone episodes.  I have some life and don't have time to keep up with all the shows that are now using this soap opera format.  To be fair to this second season most of the shows are stand alone but ends with a major cliff hanger.  Season 3 is one very long episode.",1116720000,,803,3.98125
2291147,4,B0009I7NGW,"As a long time fan of the Star Trek franchise, I tend to be among the more lenient fans as far as where the writers and producers take the stories.  I suppose this is what to expect from a fan who was drawn in by Star Trek: The Motion Picture.

Nevertheless, I thoroughly enjoyed Enterprise as a series on it's own, but it is very obvious that there are differing views on where the fans wanted the series to go as opposed to the writers.

I understand the producers desire to explore new ideas (Temporal Cold War, Xindi) but we Trek fans are nitpickers, and there were so many good opportunities to ""fill in the gaps"" created by the other four series.  What caused the various conflicts with the Klingons and the Romulans?  How was Section 31 started?  And season four left me wanting for more about the early development of the Federation.

There were some very notable episodes this season, particularly Carbon Creek, Horizon, and Bounty.  Minefield makes you want for more of the origins of the Starfleet-Romulan conflict, and Dead Stop seems to foreshadow the Borg storylines better than Regeneration, as I feel it was unnecessary to actually have the Borg in Enterprise at all.

The ultimate shame is that the last season was the one that the fans wanted, and was actually so good that I was anxiously awaiting the next episode after watching each weeks' story.  It might be nice to see an occasional made for TV movie with this cast, maybe with a creative idea for a Romulan war (hint, hint.)

I will say, though, if you are only willing to invest in a single season, wait for the fourth one.  It's truly worth it.",1116115200,22,1621,4.551724137931035
2291148,1,B0009I7NGW,"With the second season, ENT continued to anger many long-time fans as Archer and his crew tangled with the Borg, the Ferengi and the Romulans long before TOS and TNG did. The back door excuse that continuity was maintained was that the crew never learned of their names (though the Borg issue remains very muddled). Brannon Braga -who was asked by a fan to explain the Borg episode Regeneration - seemed to confirm that this Trek was a complete Reboot of the franchise or a Star Trek that occurs in an alternate universe. There is something called Many Worlds, a parallel time theory that contends that most historical occurrences, such as the signing of Magna Carta and what not, did happen only that principles might have been slightly different. And that essentially, since Star Trek: First Contact, the entire franchise now exists in this parallel timeline.  Essentially, what happens is the Borg and TNG Enterprise journeys into the past and changes history. Here, then, reality splits into two versions -one road depicting the changed history, and the other road is were the original reality exists before the change. In the end, it is the only way to explain the Borg episode and Star Trek: Enterprise. Had Braga and Berman basically thought this out, maybe I could've forgiven them for the drivel they put out for three seasons until Paramount and UPN let Manny Coto take over the last season (which has been the best since DS9). I'm sad to say that Trek really ended with DS9. All others, have just been pale imitations.",1115424000,12,1529,4.813688212927756
2291149,5,B0009I7NGW,"I just completed an afternoon view of disk 1 of season 1.
I found the visual and sound quality amzing.

While watching Broken Bow, my immediate impression was a sense of wonder and 'wow'! It was amazing how these characters came together on Day 1 and captured our imaginations! The pilot episode was by far, the best Star Trek pilot ever released -- that is, the producers delivered a compeling story on the very first program! Wow!  I am anxious to purchase the third season set---since the story lines were immaginative and made me remember what the Star Trek universe was all about. It is a pity that the Star Trek millions did not embrace a series, which was by far, one of the most compeling and brilliantly acted of all the franchize.

On a side bar: I was amazed at the appearance of actors that are now some of the best shows on TV: The O.C. (One of the aliens is now Julie Cooper's mother...), Dangerous Housewives (The husband of Mary Ellen...), JAQ (The mysterious CIA agent...), and so on.",1115424000,10,1001,4.519337016574585
2291150,4,B0009I7NGW,"By the end, almost every episode seems like it was a  continuation. I loved TNG from the start because every episode was an excellent stand-alone sci-fi mystery, edible for anyone (changing the time slot from 8pm to 7 didn't help either- then from Wed to Fri).

But okay, get past that stuff (buy a TIVO) no problem and then let's go BACK in time (Star-Trek goes FORWARD by the way), it wasn't a totally unacceptable idea; the excitment of standing on a comet, venturing into the completely unknown is a little more approachable for the wider audience. But I think the new viewers quickly gave up after this season when each and every episode no longer had a stand-alone sci-fi mystery, but triple and quadruple episodes. Hello confusion.

The 'Cliff-Hangers' of TNG worked like a charm. Every season ending with an unbelievable jaw-dropping wonderment that left us excruciatingly waiting for the next seasons CONCLUSION OF STORY. I just took it for granted that Enterprise would make it, and I'd just buy the seasons. I can't watch ""24"" either for this exact reason.

This is what ruined Enterprise; ""To Be Continued"" being the first credit of every episode by season three.

I still loved the show and watching the first season in a box set was delicious.

By the way (for you producers) Scott Bakula probably wasn't the best choice. Avery Brooks, Patrick Stewart? Utter MASTERS of the stars. Janeway of course irritated me and most other Trekkers (all but one that I know), but the stories were good so I enjoyed. Bakula isn't a bad actor, there just could have been alot more to this character.

The stories in Enterprise are really creative as well. Experiences that led to the creation of the Prime Directive was a great wheel to turn, the idea of everything being uncharted and unknown gave them plenty to work with. It's a shame they gave up on it. What the hell are we gonna do NOW?? YOU SUCK PARAMOUNT (or whomever).",1115337600,6,1926,4.714285714285714
2291151,5,B0009I7NGW,"Captain Archer and the tuff decisions he had to take during each episode is very refreshing.

The Season 3, and the long term goal to safe Earth from the Xindi keep waiting from week to week. Similar to ""Alias"" or ""24"".

Overall, is sad that the show is being cancelled.

I don't understand people coming here and writing bad things about Enterprise. If they don't like it, what are they watching it so much?  I don't watch shows I don't like, and I don't go and write reviews about them.",1115337600,26,488,4.388888888888889
2291152,5,B0009I7NGW,"The title pretty much says it all. Star Trek has fallen victim to these awful reality shows that are polluting the air waves. It's a sad state of affairs when people are more concerned when a staged setup is more important than quality storytelling. Stand up against Hollywood, and boycott ALL reality shows!!!!!

As for Enterprise, I felt that it got back to the roots of Star Trek that TNG, DS9, and Voyager had somewhat departed from. Don't get me wrong; I love, own, and enjoy all of the Star Treks.

The entire cast was one of the most gifted I've ever seen in a sci-fi series, with outstanding performances by Scott Bakula and Jolene Blalock as Archer and T'Pol. The stories were sharp, the interaction with the crew enjoyable, and the visual FX among the best on all of the Star Treks to date. People complained about the theme song, which was a radical departure from the previous series, but in my opinion, not to its detriment. The spirit of 'Where My Heart Will Take Me' so captures the basic feeling for Enterprise that I found it to be far more suited to this prequel series, than anything I can imagine being composed for it.

The second season continued the ideals of exploration, while hinting at the larger storylines, such as the Temporal Cold War, showing how First Contact was made with many of the species from the Original Series (giving those species a much needed makeover), and man's early forays out into deep space. This continued to be an important theme throughout the series, beginning in the groundbreaking 1st season, the tense and exciting 3rd season, and the amazing multi-arc 4th and final season, covering the distance between First Contact with the Vulcans (seen in Star Trek: First Contact) and the Original series.  The second season, though a bit less exciting than the others (which also happened with TNG, DS9, and VGR), contained some outstanding episodes, such as 'Carbon Creek' where a marooned crew of Vulcans (including T'Pol's grandmother) must adapt to 1950's Earth while hiding their alien origins, 'Stigma' which shed some light on the intolerance of Vulcan society (kind of a mirror for ours), 'Future Tense' which continued the Cold War and introduced the Tholians, 'Regeneration' which shows what happened to the Borg Sphere that reached orbit of 21st Century Earth in 'Star Trek: First Contact', and the nail-biting conclusion 'The Expanse', which set up the beginning of the 3rd season-long story arc on the Xindi.

Quite frankly, I'd bet that anyone who says this show isn't good, is one of those beer-drinking bumpkins who considers garbage like 'Survivor', 'The Apprentice', 'The Bachelor', 'The Simple Life', and 'The Contender' to be good TV.

Ben Stein, once hosting ""Win Ben Stein's Money"", and former worker for Nixon (Don't hold that against him), has stated that Hollywood has lost contact with the common man. Make a statement to them, and demand that they bring good shows back, instead of those garbage-reality shows.

Enjoy the second season, and indeed all the seasons, of Star Trek: Enterprise and stick it to Hollywood, prove that quality is more important than cheap thrills.",1115251200,34,3149,4.919020715630885
2291153,4,B0009I7NGW,"Following the success of four live-action TV series and ten feature-length films, producers Rick Berman and Brannon Braga attempted to create a fifth live-action ""Star Trek"" series that would be set approximately 100 years prior to the time of Captain Kirk (during the original ""Star Trek"" series, which ran between 1966 and 1969) and 100 years after the fictional character Dr. Zefram Cochrane flew the first warp-capable spaceship, as depicted in the 1996 film ""Star Trek VIII: First Contact"".

The new series, entitled ""Star Trek Enterprise"" debuted in the fall of 2001, only months after the previous ""Star Trek"" series, ""Star Trek Voyager"" concluded its seven-year run.  As the show's title implies, the ship used in the show if named ""Enterprise"" and has serial number NX-01.  Having less advanced technology than Captain Kirk's time, the maximum speed of the NX-01 is only warp 5.  It's crew was comprised of Captain Jonathan Archer (played by Scott Bakula, formerly the lead actor of the sci-fi TV show ""Quantum Leap"", that ran between 1989-1993), Vulcan science officer Subcommander T'Pol (Jolene Blalok), pilot Ensign Travis Mayweather (Anthony Montgomery), ship's communications officer Ensign Hoshi Sato (Linda Park), the Denobulan Dr. Phlox (John Billingsley), weapon's officer Lieutenant Malcolm Reed (Dominic Keating) and ship's engineer Commander Charles 'Trip' Tucker III (Connor Trinneer).

When over 12,000,000 viewers watching the first season's premiere episode, it initially appeared that UPN, which broadcasted the show, would have another successful ""Star Trek"" series, just as it had with ""Star Trek Voyager"".  Unfortunately, subsequently shows had much smaller audiences that only continued to shrink with each season. The average number of viewers per episode for the first season was about 6.7 million; for the second season, this number dropped to 4.4 million and for the third season, the number dropped further to 3.8 million.  It was during the fourth season that UPN decided to cancel the series, even though there were still another three seasons to be produced because the fourth season ratings dropped even further to 3.1 million viewers per episode.

The question, then, is why did ""Star Trek Enterprise"" fail to capture the attention of the estimated 30,000,000 ""Star Trek"" fans living in the U.S.A.?  Personally, I believe several factors are responsible.  First, the most interesting characters were Dr. Phlox and T'Pol.  The characters of Reed and Trip were often annoying both in the first two seasons.  However, the most annoying character during the first two seasons was Capt. Archer himself, who continued to act like an arrogant uninvited guest towards every alien species and outpost encountered.  Second, the inclusion of the previously unknown species of the Suliban and the Xindi, as well as the notion of a ""temporal cold war"" from the far distant future, ran tangent to the notion that ""Enterprise"" was supposed to be a prequel leading up to the time of Capt. Kirk.  Third, the technology and overall look of the NX-01 often appeared more advanced than what was used in the original 1966-1969 ""Star Trek"" series, which is supposed to be 100 years more advanced than ""Enterprise"".  Fourth, insufficient attention was given to portraying the various extraterrestrial races responsible for forming the United Federation of Planets (the Vulcans, the Andorians, the Tellarites, and the Alpha Centauris), as well as to other races known during Capt. Kirk's time.  Though the Vulcans were a regular race depicted in first two seasons of ""Enterprise"", only a handful of episodes featured any of the other familiar alien races: 5 episodes during the first season and 8 during the second.  The familiar races encountered during the second season were the Romulans in episode ""Minefield"", the Klingons in episodes ""Marauders"" & ""Judgement"", the Andorians in episode ""Cease Fire"", the Tholians in episode ""Future Tense"", the Borg in episode ""Regeneration"" and the Tellarites in episode ""Bounty"".  Of these, only the Klingons & Andorians were not first time encounters.  The blame for these various factors that directly contributed to the premature cancellation of ""Star Trek Enterprise"" rests solely with producers Rick Berman and Brannon Braga.  Though producer Manny Coto did an amazing job of reconnecting the fourth season of ""Star Trek Enterprise"" to the other ""Star Trek"" TV series, sadly, his efforts came too late to save the show.

Of the 26 second season episodes, the memorable ones include ""Carbon Creek"", ""Minefield"" (an excellent episode), ""Dead Stop"", ""Marauders"", ""The Seventh"", ""The Communicator"", ""Singularity"", ""The Catwalk"", ""Dawn"", ""Stigma"", ""Cease Fire"", ""Future Tense"", ""Judgment"", ""Cogenitor"" (one of the best second-season episodes), ""Regeneration"" and ""Bounty"".  Several disappointing episodes include ""A Night in Sickbay"", ""Precious Cargo"", ""Canamar"", ""The Crossing"" and ""Horizon"".  I have mixed feelings regarding the season finale ""The Expanse"" as it was the precursor to the truly awful Xindi-dominated third season.

Overall, I rate the second season of ""Star Trek Enterprise"" with 4 out of 5 stars.  It was an interesting experiment that had it been given more time, probably would have blossomed into a far better series thanks to the efforts of Manny Coto during the fourth season.",1115251200,5,5357,5.402160864345738

The characters are imperfect, (Capt.) Archer takes actions that would be against the Prime Directive in successive iterations.  The representations of violence and death are not 'tidy', as in the original series, or NextGen, Voyager or DS9.  What I like most of all is that the series episodes are mostly interconnected, so it makes a great series to binge watch ...

Even when something is completely improbable and hokey - no matter the series - I enjoy suspending disbelief for a little while to watch it. Because of this, I don't obsess over every little detail of ""accuracy"" for events that are, at the end of the day, merely fiction.

2291283,3,B0009I7NGW,"The NX-01 Enterprise, Earth's first deep-space exploration vessel, continues to visit new worlds and make first contact with new species. However, Captain Archer's mission is complicated by rising tensions between the Vulcans and Andorians, the ongoing threat of the Suliban and internal dissent within the Klingon Empire which results in a price being placed on his head.

The first season of Star Trek: Enterprise was promising and intermittently fun, but it was also highly variable in quality, pulled its punches a lot and didn't have the courage of its convictions. A Star Trek prequel series featuring life at the rough end of space, humans establishing relations with races like the Tellarites, Vulcans and Andorians and featuring lots of low-tech solutions that Geordi or O'Brien would have fixed in five seconds in later series could be quite exciting. Enterprise doesn't do that, however. It's really just another Star Trek show, slightly bland and playing it safe whilst leaning a lot on Star Trek tropes that were exhausted long before The Next Generation ended, let alone by the time Enterprise was on air a full decade later.

The season actually starts off in an entertaining enough fashion, with T'Pol relating the story of a Vulcan science team stuck on Earth in the 1950s which does some typical but amusing culture clash stuff quite well. A Magnificent Seven-riffing episode has the crew help a team of miners defend themselves from Klingons and a war episode focusing on Andorians and Vulcans fighting over a contested moon is clever for how it shows that human flexibility can be an asset in resolving a situation that the Vulcans can't deal with through logic alone. There's also a solid Klingon trial episode starring J.G. Hertzler as a Klingon attorney and a very good first contact culture clash episode starring the late, great Andreas Katsulas as an alien captain who forms a bromance with Captain Archer over their mutual love of exploration. A late-season episode featuring a flashback to Archer's days as a warp test pilot (riffing on things like The Right Stuff) is also decent. There's a solid sense of character progression throughout the season as well, with T'Pol developing into a more interesting character and Phlox getting some interesting episodes as well.

The weaknesses from Season 1 remain intact, however. Trip gets far too many episodes dedicated to him when he is simply far too bland and uninteresting a character to merit it, Travis gets exactly one episode to do anything of interest in (and doesn't do too great a job) and Hoshi doesn't even get that. To be fair they do drop some of the more frustrating elements from Season 1 - the Temporal Cold War is pretty much forgotten about, apart from two episodes - and they also work on making the Klingons more formidable bad guys at the end of the season, but Enterprise remains firing on half-thrusters for most of the season. For every good episode there is a dull-as-dishwater one, and a couple that are flat-out terrible.

That said, the season finale is surprisingly good. The Suliban reluctantly form an alliance with Enterprise to combat a greater threat in a region of space known as the Delphic Expanse, setting the scene for the much more heavily-serialised third season.

The second season of Star Trek: Enterprise (***) remains watchable and at times it lives up to the promise of the premise. But all too often it waters down gripping ideas into dull, Star-Trek-by-the-numbers morality plays and sells short its own potential.",1481932800,,3537,4.99830220713073

2291386,4,B0009I7NGW,"This is a tricky series to review. I really enjoy watching the series on Amazon Prime because there's no distraction from commercial interruptions. Continuity is maintained throughout these re-views and let's you appreciate staging, lighting, set design and overall production values. John Billingsley, Doctor Phlox, is my favorite character in the series. He steals every scene he's in. Scott Bakula, Captain Archer, and Jolene Blalock, Tpol, the series Vulcan science officer, do most of the heavy lifting, or onscreen presence in the series. Have a little fun watching the fine actor Connor Trinneer, Enterprise's Chief Engineer, do a perfect impersonation, intentionally, of then Present George W. Busch in many of the scenes he appears in. There's lots of subtle nuances in Star Trek: Enterprise. I am not a Trekkie and I enjoyed it. Watch the closing credits at the end of the episode to see who does the behind the scenes heavy lifting. You'll find some of the best people in the industry worked on this series.",1475366400,7,1018,5.1017964071856285

2291408,5,B0009I7NGW,"Perhaps my favorite Star Trek series. Great mix of science, character development, intriguing story lines, and battle. Not always as altruistic as Enterprise, nor as preachy as Janeway's Voyager, but there is always a message. When it first came out, I thought Scott Bakula was a crazy choice. I was wrong - although his acting has never been top-tier, he portrays Archer very well, making for a believable leader when times get tough.

If you like any Star Trek series, Enterprise is at least worth a look. It provides backstory for the others, in the early days of some of the technologies and relationships  they revolve around, and is interesting in its own right. Each episode stands well on its own but the continuing storylines through the seasons are quite well done.",1474848000,,775,4.863636363636363
2291409,3,B0009I7NGW,The story line is great. The concept of interstellar travel and meeting new species is incredible. The special effects are 6 out of 10. It appears the story veers off course after a couple of episodes so it seems to not be consistent for a little while.,1474848000,,253,4.404255319148936
2291410,5,B0009I7NGW,I have to admit here that I have been a fan of Star Trek ever since Captain Kirk embarked on his 5 year mission. I'm only sorry that the series didn't last as long as the mission was supposed to. What followed ranged mostly from mediocre to passable. This series on the other hand may be the best of the franchise. It brought back from the original series the wonder of discovery and the mystery of the unknown that should (in my humble opinion) be the basis for all scifi. All in all it is an excellent series.,1474761600,,511,4.224489795918367

2291413,5,B0009I7NGW,The pilot episode didn't draw me in but as you get attached to the characters it becomes for enthrolling.  Reminds of why i was addicted to stargate and and Atlantis.  If you are a fan of Quantum Leap you will get some special treats too.,1474675200,,238,4.266666666666667

2291420,5,B0009I7NGW,"Can't pass up Star Trek.  They've taken the playbook from DS9 and turned the theme into a prequel. T'Pol substitutes for 7o9 with the same sexual innuendos we saw before.  Small ship, lots of first contacts that are 99% humanoid, plenty of ethical issues from a decade ago and some that are ""timeless.""  There is a thematic element that runs through a lot of Season 2.  A temporal cold war.  I'm not sure how I feel about that.  After watching Dr. Who for decades, I think they should have thought through timey-wimey issues a bit better.  The theme seems more of a writers crutch than something that was thought out.  One shining creative item I have to mention, and that's the theme song.  In the first season and I think the second, the theme song really shines.  In season 3 they doctored it up and lost a lot.  I know it sounds like such a nit, but my wife and I both really loved the message and ""heart"" in that song.",1474243200,,923,4.3391812865497075

2291505,4,B0009I7NGW,"I've been bindging on Enterprise, and I have to say that it's much better than I remember it. Maybe I've lowered my standards after seeing the damage the ""reboot"" movies have done to the franchise.

I still say that the producers of Enterprise screwed up by into ducking the ""Temporal Cold War"" and the ""Xindi War"" storylines instead of concentrating on how the Federation was founded. Why do a prequel if you don't want to tell stories about the beginning of the Federation?

Still, the series had strong characters and good stories. Seeing a less powerful Enterprise with an untested crew made for some good stories.",1468540800,,618,4.820754716981132

But still a good show and worth watching.
Just skip the theme song in the beginning. Song probably caused show to be cancelled.",1468454400,,317,4.389830508474576
2291509,4,B0009I7NGW,"The second season of Enterprise builds on the strengths of the first season. Shrann and the Andorians return and the P'Jem incident casts a shadow across the early half of this season. There are several episodes that are stand alone. They are one off episodes that are pretty much take it or leave it as far as trek is concerned. ""Marauders"" is a replay of the original series ""Private Little War"", and ""Precious Cargo"" is a more intimate retelling of two trek stories, where a princess must be rescued from danger and taken to another planet in spite of the love that grows between her and a crewman. Also there's a retelling of ""Piece of the Action"" from the original Trek. In fact, much of the season Enterprise casts about  trying on past Trek storylines. Even the Borg show up and Archer has a Star Trek ""Undiscovered Country"" Klingon prison/trial episode. SoBerman and Bragga are firmly stuck in the past and only the Andorians and episodes like ""Carbon Creek"" and ""First Flight"" save the season.
Now a real beef: I have several CBS DVD sets and they all have digital errors on them. Columbo and Enterprise have entire shows where they digitize the images, the screen freezes or jumps entire segments. Very poor quality that mars otherwise entertaining programs.",1468368000,2,1268,4.789954337899544

Being a lifelong fan of Fifty's Sci Fi, I like the old style, ray gun, ""shoot em ups"" that happen on this show.
The production quality was top notch, holds up very well, and looks great on a modern widescreen tv; unheard of back when this series was produced. It is interesting to see every character on board holding and using small screened devices that look like smartphones or small tablet computers. These also were unheard of back then but common and indispensable now.

Good.
Minefield I loved as it introduced the Romulans but never showed them.
The Communicator was a GREAT episode. It showed just how much impact you can have.
Stigma was great not for T'Pol's story line but for Trips. Phlox and his wife... My kind of folks.
Future Tense was the best Temporal Cold War episode of them all.
Judgment was perfect as it showed the Klingons but not at war. It was the embodiment of the trial from the movie but better.
Cogenitor was a great one. A bit heady in my opinion but hit on the key social issues.

Regeneration is my favorite of the this season. It's a good little bridge episode of sorts. Introduces Cybernetic organism.

The finale setup Season 3. A brazen attack to ruin all the pretty niceness. Just what the Trek Universe needed I think. A slap the to face.",1462147200,,854,4.426751592356688

2291597,5,B0009I7NGW,"In Season 2, Captain Archer and the crew of the Enterprise really start to get their feet wet for the first time as the traverse out into the distant stars.  They meet many strange alien beings and find that they are all surprisingly different except that most of them are dangerous one way or another.  One of my favorites is episode 22, Cogenitor.  In this episode, Trip finds himself in real trouble after he takes a liking to an attractive alien woman known as a Cogenitor.  I don't want to ruin it for anyone but Trip feels that the society the cogenitor lives in is discriminating against her and he tries to help her as mush as he can without the Captain's approval.  It ends very sadly and Trip gets really reamed by Captain Archer.  The show has some great space adventure shots that you won't forget as the crew goes about interacting with the Cogenitor's race.  As I said the end a bit of a surprise and sad. Also, the last episode of season 2 is the start of the supercharged and best of Enterprise to come in seasons 3 and 4 where Earth comes under a barbaric attack that kills millions in the state of Florida where Trip's sister lives and Enterprise is Hell bent on finding out who did it and these seasons are the true basis of the Enterprise experience.  The enemy is called the Zindi and wow Captain Archer and crew go all out to track down these barbarians and what a show.  Enterprise is almost totally destroyed several times in grueling space wars in these seasons.  It's really a sobering survival of the fittest and not a show for the faint of heart.

I've been a big Bakula fan since Quantum Leap. While some of his performances in Enterprise were a bit on the slow and deliberate side, overall he was very effective, as was the rest of the cast.

I enjoyed seeing this series explore some of the theme that we only saw tidbits of in the original Star Trek series, particularly Andorians (who would appear many times in Enterprise, and Orions. I found it to be lots of fun.

For season two, I particularly enjoyed the early Borg encounter, and the start of the adventure to ""The Expanse"" which would dominate season three.",1453939200,,743,4.496296296296296

2291732,1,B0009I7NGW,"Don't waste your time on this failure.  Perhaps this series is for someone not familiar with Star Trek... then I suppose they may enjoy it.  The terrible acting and writing needs to be trashed.  Captain Archer is eating while his crew is being tortured by an alien on their ship... Earth is attacked and millions of people are killed... Captain Archer is informed of this but doesn't ask any questions to his upper management like WHY? as his crew asked him the same question.  I really do not understand what his mission was as Captain of the Enterprise... he wasn't honorable, strong in his beliefs or with the Federation.  He was always quick to anger without question like an immature kid that never grew up.  What a waste of time if I were to watch every single episode... the ones I've seen which I gave all I can give of any kind of understanding.  I'll pass.",1452816000,,866,4.512820512820513

Moreover, the show lost is moral grounding.  A franchise that elevated the best of humanity, reflection, and optimism took an ugly turn down a dark alley.  Torture, Bigotry?  Roddenberry is turning over in his grave.

The stories are top notch, exploring cultural differences, interpersonal relationships, with nice touches of technology and special effects. They do a good job of adding background for things that are alluded to in the original series. The only criticism I have is that they give the Vulcans more influence over human affairs and the federation than I had ever thought had been suggested by the original series. Still, it is not too difficult to get passed that. Season 1 was good. This is even better. Every Trek fan is different. This is how I rank them. 1. Original Series. 2. Enterprise. 3.

2291857,5,B0009I7NGW,"For me, the very best Science Fiction stories reflect back on current culture and/or specific human situations enough to broaden our perspective and allow us to imagine possible futures. I believe Star Trek has always done this better in television format than any other series and Enterprise is closer in spirit to the basic Star Trek ideals than any of the other television series since the original. Exploration in it's infancy, developing morals of behavior, discovering other cultures and their motivations and as each situation enfolds we learn, along with the crew, more and more about ourselves through our behaviors, reactions and emotions. Not every story in the series is worth the 5 stars and comparing it to a series with a very large budget and cast would not be fair, but on the whole I consider it great SciFi. My only complaint is that it seems too ""American.""
Yes, I've loved the Star Trek universe since I was very young. I also love Doctor Who for the witty fun of it, Battlestar Galactica for the fascinating characters - I'm a very open-minded, uncritical, fan so everyone on the Enterprise could all be wearing green shirts and I'd still thoroughly enjoy the stories.",1446336000,,1190,4.8669950738916254

2292158,4,B0009I7NGW,"I'm a big fan of TNG and Voyager. Stuck with both series until the end and still watch them over and over. I watch DS9 occasionally. When Enterprise first came out on broadcast television, I watched a few episodes, but didn't find them to have the ""feel"" of the other Star Trek series. I didn't find Scott Bakula's interpretation of a Captain to be along the lines of the other Star Trek Captains, but that improved. It was very obvious that they chose Jolene Blalock to capitalize on the type of draw the Jeri Ryan brought to Voyager. I thought that was kind of pathetic that they felt the need to do that to bring in viewers.
A few weeks ago, I decided to try giving Enterprise another chance and now that I'm into season 2, I do enjoy it. What I like best is how the crew reacts when they encounter new aliens. In the previous Star Trek shows, they all acted like it was no big deal. In Enterprise, it's still something new, something they're not accustomed to, just yet.
I still don't feel like this series had the same ""mojo"" as the others. That might be why it never got the fan base and ended after 4 seasons.
I will hope that another Star Trek series will happen in the future, but one that offers the action and intensity that current tv viewers are interested in. A Sci-Fi series needs to be as almost as good as a movie.",1433030400,,1331,4.285714285714286

2292178,5,B0009I7NGW,"SEASON 2 CONTINUES TO BE FUN

Enterprise takes a lot of flak for supposedly ruining the Trek franchise. But that is a little unfair.

There are some things about Enterprise that don't fit with the general continuity of the rest of the franchise. The main one of those things is the general look and feel of the show. While it looks cool and realistic, it doesn't flow with the rest of the franchise. In the show's defense it does occur 100-200 years before everything else in the franchise. Things are bound to look a little different. But it's also presented in widescreen, where the rest of the franchise is 4:3. But that's really the biggest issue with the series.

The show is NOT just tacked onto the franchise with no reference to the known Trek universe. In fact there are numerous references to the rest of the Trek world. The Eugenics program with references to Khan is a multi episode story arc that features the ancestor of Noonian Soong, played by Brent Spiner. That story arc also includes an explanation about why Klingons from The Original Series look different than Klingons from the Next Generation era. (It's goofy, but it's fun)  There are just many many references to the Trek universe you know and love, and explanations on how that universe developed into the one you know from 'the future'.

Season 2 gets into some early meetings with the Klingon Empire, which is cool. The Borg that were sent back in time in Star Trek First Contact are referenced in season 2 as well, with the crew trying to figure out what these cyborg humanoid creatures are. (Of course they have never seen a Borg and no one will make contact with the Borg Collective fro several hundred years). So the season is filled with neat references like that.

It's a well made show. If you watched the rest of Trek you owe it to yourself to bring it home with Enterprise.",1431907200,4,1860,4.587349397590361

Amazon Prime to the rescue: this series is, in my humble opinion, the best of all of the Star Trek Franchises, combining the optimism for the future and the not-so-subtle reflection of the present from the original;l series, to the more polished production values of the later series.

2292278,5,B0009I7NGW,"I bought this to complete my collection (already had seasons 1, 3 and 4). One of the best things about this collection is the packaging. The plastic cases are unique, the internal blue box holding the disks is fairly sturdy. They make good display items.

The paper/cardboard outer band holds the case shut, but if you cut the center of it with a knife in the back you can leave it on the case so that top and bottom tab on the front are still displayed (which is what I've done, then added some tape to the back side to hold it on better).

All in all a great series, and nicely original packaging. Enterprise has become my favorite of the Trek series. I wish it had lasted longer. I guess we were lucky to get four seasons as opposed to only three for the original series, but still, this show could have easily gone seven or eight if they had given it the chance to capture an audience at the time.

Scott Bakula as Captain Jonathan Archer and the rest of the crew, including the holographic doctor, take Enterprise NX-01 to the furthest known reaches of mankind.  The crew acts and reacts accordingly with the whims if the powers that be.

2292372,3,B0009I7NGW,"Star Trek Enterprise had a bumby ride it's first three seasons, and it's not the fault of Paramount, some of the actors from the series said Paramount didn't promote the series enough, I say their wrong, Paramount PROMOTED the hell out of the series, with advertising EVERYWHERE..The problem with Enterprise was a lack of continuity, imagination and story telling, this happened alot in season two. The producers of Enterprise could had taken this season to new heights exploring the origin of Trek history, they started doing this in season 4 but by then it was too late for the series to pick up, however,  in this DVD set there are good moments and I think Enterprise always had some of the best sets on TV making it LOOK very believable,As for the acting goes It's okay for most of the season, though I find Scott Bakula's  Archer very confusing in ""A Night In Sickbay"" T'pol's sexual nature is explored in ""Bounty"".""Regeneration"" i think is a standout exploring the Borg that was left over on Earth from the movie ""First Contact"", my other favorites are Carbon Creek, Minefield, Dead Stop,Marauders, First Flight and the Expanse. In My opinion the good beats out the bad in this season and you'll like the special features. Overall this DVD shows Enterprise heading in a different direction by the end of the season, and that's good.",1415577600,,1338,4.787878787878788

Perhaps it was by design but it seemed to me that in the first season, Archer was trying to smother everyone with kindness and understanding. Rather boring.
Being a sucker for a good love story, I enjoy the romantic tension between Trip and T'Pol.
I've been a big fan of Star Trek since the original series started. I never missed an episode of Kirk, Spock, McCoy and Scotty but I don't even remember this series being announced and never saw an episode when it was playing.

2292506,5,B0009I7NGW,"LOVE Star Trek: Enterprise Season 2.
  This series was short lived. I think because, at the time, there was a lot of different Star Trek shows on TV all at once. The characters were refreshing and well acted. The story lines were done very well. And seeing the development of Star Fleet before its existence was refreshing. They ended the Series with the very beginning, or Formation of Star Fleet, Leaving the series with a  wonderful ending. Gelling it with the other Star Trek Shows that followed in the History and Formation of the different shows.
  Jolene Blalock was more than just a pretty face. She brought her own interpretation of the Vulcan Persona to light. Considering what large shoes she had to fill, in a major Franchise. She brought an intelligence, vulnerability, and strength to the Vulcan character, T-Pol. You could see her struggle, trying to integrate into the Human Enterprise Crew, through her expressions and reactions, following in the the true Vulcan Mannerisms, like Leonard Nimoy did.
  I'm only sorry that the show didn't last longer. Star Trek was all about the Struggle in the exploration of space. This show showed a lot of cunning and ingenuity, following the true theme of the Trek Universe.
  Star Trek has so many followers from all walks of life, that I'm sure it would endure on TV, for a long time. I wish the powers that create the Star Trek Universe would get something back on television.

2292542,4,B0009I7NGW,Liked the movie.  Liked the humanizing of Mr. Spoke.  Cumberbatch makes a good villain that is not all evil once you learn his back story.  The visual effects and photography is first rate and puts you in the action of the movie.  Thumbs up from me.,1401753600,,249,4.3478260869565215
2292543,4,B0009I7NGW,"Star Trek Enterprise is better than the original series because of the fuller character development.  They have enough flaws to make them more human.

2292547,4,B0009I7NGW,"Being a Trek fan, it's always hard to keep an open mind when something new is tried that isn't the 'norm'. Certainly, Enterprise is a testament to that. With Season 2, we can see more clearly just how fatigued the writing staff was and just how involved the studio became. While episodes like 'Precious Cargo', 'A Night In Sickbay', and 'Marauders' aren't the shiniest of stories despite some great character moments, as a whole Season 2 delivers many solid Trek-style stories.",1401235200,,477,4.901234567901234

2292554,5,B0009I7NGW,"This show was produced under duress fromt the studio for more Star Trek, and the producers really wanted to wait a year os so. I think that it shows in this show, produced by the guys that gave us TNG, Deep Space Nine, and Voyager. It still is worth watching. Of course Scott Bakula takes sometime to get used to. He has a presence, but does the George Clooney head popping around when acts thing. The problem with this show is it had no real interesting characters like Spock or Data. It really needed someone to grab the show by the balls, and that is what was missing. I signed a petition to have the show saved in 2005. It is an expensive show to make. Who knows maybe one of these fan sites can make a special with the cast. There are a few stand out episodes here. So I would recommend Season 2,to every Star Trek fan.",1400112000,,824,4.188679245283019
2292555,3,B0009I7NGW,"There are a few fun episodes but most of them were ""rip offs"" from episodes/movies from other Treks.

2292559,5,B0009I7NGW,I missed it during the original run and I regret it. This is a great series and unfortunately only lasted a few seasons. BUT I found it now and will watch it all the way thru then probably watch it again.,1398816000,,204,4.0
2292560,4,B0009I7NGW,When the series first came out I was not able to watch/record the shows.  Using my Amazon Prime account I was able to view shows I missed.  The shows are now classics.

But, the saie price of about 60 dollars is about right. I'm very happy with the picture quality. It's the only Star Trek series filmed in HD and you can see it on the blu-rays (thought the series looked good on dvd, but even better now). Plus, the new extras are awesome. Enterprise is my favorite and I'm really happy with the blu-rays.",1398038400,,508,4.09

2292567,5,B0009I7NGW,"Just as in most of the other Star Trek series. this one is no different.  The actors are well suited for their roles, and play them well.  The story lines are in line with most of the other series, so if you liked any of the others, you will like this one.  The first season ended each episode with a ""story line ending"", but season II, is a continuing drama, so you won't want to miss an episode to keep in line with the story.  I would definitely recommend this to a friend  if they were ""Trekkies"".",1397865600,,501,4.123711340206185

2292569,2,B0009I7NGW,"The writing, acting or both are less than desirable. The plot lines for the most part are weak. There are a couple of good episodes; one being set in the artic circle and plays nicely off of the Star Trek First Contact movie. However the script for and performance by the researchers are lame and belong in a Friday the 13th movie. The season finally picks up the pace and gives hope to a better third season.

2292571,5,B0009I7NGW,"Great creativity by the producers to introduce different views of controversial issues.  As with ""Voyager"", I'm not disappointed.  Why they canceled after the 4th season is beyond me.  I guess the sponsors didn't make enough return on their investment.",1397088000,,252,5.410256410256411
2292572,4,B0009I7NGW,GENERALLY THE SERIES IS VERY GOOD.  LOTS OF GOOD ACTION AND STORYLINE.  NOT SO FORMAL AS TO BE OVERLY MILITARISTIC.  THE CHARACTERS ARE INTERESTING AND ENJOYABLE.  I WOULD ENJOY THE SERIES BEING RENEWED ON TELEVISION.,1396828800,,217,5.114285714285714

2292574,4,B0009I7NGW,"As a long standing Star Trek fan (who despises Voyager), I had reservations when they announced Enterprise.  Taking into consideration what their goal with this series is, it still has some problems.  In season 2, however, the show begins coming into its own.  The Vulcans are still out of character with the other series but seem to slowly be working their way back, Scott Bakula is a fine actor but poor writing causes him to act out of character to what would be expected of a ship captain and makes him look utterly inept.  It is also strange that a character who is not a member of Starfleet would have a place in the chain of command of a Starfleet starship.  Not to mention the fact that any ship whose mission included first contact with other races would naturally require the presence of an ambassador specializing in interspecies relations...but not this ship apparently.  This is also the first Star Trek whose theme song was an actual song.  All that being said, they have managed capture again the sense of exploration and adventure that attracted me to the original series so many years ago.  This alone allowed me to look beyond its problems and keep me coming back for more.  I have enjoyed watching it and expect it to keep getting better as the series continues.  I am aware that this particular series has ended several years ago, but I was unable to watch it as it aired so I am watching it now to make up for it.",1396742400,,1434,4.523255813953488

2292576,5,B0009I7NGW,"I have always enjoyed Star Trek. If you feel the same you will, of course, enjoy this season 2 Star Trek.

2292579,5,B0009I7NGW,"I liked the show, Tucker was my favorite actor on the show, along with Dr Phlox.

Scott is good in the part and the characters hold true to the concept of Star Trek. Since you have to just about drag people into the transported you'll know where it is in the time line of Star Trek. Plan on watching the whole series.  I watched the original series in the 60's until NBC stuck it on Friday night at 10:00 to kill it, FOOLS!  Star Trek will always be better than Lost in Space or BattleStar Galactica.

2292622,2,B0009I7NGW,"I'm at the halfway point through the season.  I never saw this when it came out.  It is a HUGE advantage to be able to watch these on Amazon Prime!  (Thank you, thank you!)  ALL of Start Trek is available, and I started with TOS and I've gone through everything, in 2 years.

My 2-star rating:  My friends who are Enterprise ""aficionados"" tell me the show does not really get good until the story arc gets started, which I assume is in Season 3.  I think Rick Berman and the writing staff always intended to have an over-arcing plot, like the one which worked so successfully in DS9.  We see a hint of this with the ""Temporal Cold War"" introduced in Season One, but this isn't the real story arc.  I think it is just a trial arc, which was eventually abandoned or resolved.

That being said, at least a third of the stories work as somewhat insightful one-offs, with some refreshing anecdote or word-play.  It is kind of refreshing seeing Archer and crew ""boldly go"" without being hamstrung by the Federation, the Prime Directive, and in some cases just pure common sense.  There is a lot of ""what if"" from the writers.  However, too many of the episodes seem contrived and not well-formed.  It seems like the writers are intentionally (or even arbitrarily) creating problems to overcome - Helpful aliens invited on the ship AREN'T, the Vulcans will continue to be pig-headed, and the shuttle WILL crash-land due to ""something in the atmosphere neutralizing the propulsion system.""  Nothing surprises, the conflict becomes formulaic, and the resolution (precisely 8 minutes before the end of the episode) highly predictable.  We get the overall sense (and Scott Bakula's sometimes smarmy performance underscores this) that nothing is really at stake.

Although the worst episodes (so far) are far better than the worst episodes of TOS and STTNG, I am looking forward to when the stakes get higher, and they get the show up to warp speed.",1389139200,,1937,4.768768768768769

Adventure, good writing - it made you think - good actors.

I guess reality shows are cheaper to make and attract a bigger no brain audience?

2292642,4,B0009I7NGW,"This is a review of the complete series

Why did this show get cancelled?

I'm sure producer Rick Berman asks that question to this very day, I think his answer is the same as everyone else's.  It started out as a good show, but it got better so slowly over it's four year run that it wasn't picking up enough viewers and was losing too many as well.

But, he shouldn't beat himself up too much.  At least half the blame has to go to UPN, the network that was it's home for four seasons.  During the network's 11 year existence it had only one clear success:  Star Trek Voyager.  Almost every single other show that premiered on UPN didn't last longer than two seasons.  And most lasted only one.  Either UPN didn't care, or they didn't have the funds to get quality programming or show producers gave priority to the other networks, leaving UPN with table scraps, at best.  When you don't have any quality programming, save for one show, a show like Enterprise has to pull it's weight on an extraordinary level (Paramount wanted to start a network with a Star Trek series in the mid 1970s.  I guess it would have ended the same way and the decision to nix it back then was proven correct).

Enterprise couldn't.  So UPN pulled the plug on an expensive show to try and salvage the network, without success.  A year later, they merged with another underachieving network, the WB, and became the CW.  A network that hasn't done anything at all and is in danger of folding itself (with the exception of Vampire Diaries, bearing in mind that you can't have a successful network with one show).

So, summing up by season.

One:  A good start, but the temporal cold war storyline meandered and went nowhere.  There were some good moments.  Shadows of P'Jem delves into the Vulcan and Andorian mythologies and we're introduced to Shran, an Andorian who could be Captain Archer's buddy one moment, and torturing him in some machine the next.  An interesting relationship between the two that was never adequately explored.  Lots of missed opportunities.

Two:  Better, but still not by much.  A decent storyline concerning Archer's relationship with the Klingons, an encounter with the Borg (remnants of the Borg ship destroyed in Star Trek First Contact), a nice story about T'Pol's ancestor in 1950s Pennsylvania, and, of course, the start of the Xindi storyline.

Three:  The Xindi.  Essentially a 24 part episode.  Pretty good.  Highlights include an encounter with religious zealots that think the spheres in the Delphic expanse are sacred and they try to stop Archer's mission, a creation of a Tucker clone that tests Archer's morals, an excursion to 2003 Detroit to try to stop the Xindi from developing a deadly weapon, fighting Vulcan zombies and, finally, a showdown with the Reptillian Xindi commander over Earth.  The tension is well kept over the span of an entire season.

Four:  A brief stop in an alternate 1944 Earth in which the Nazi's have control over the east coast of the US, thanks to time travelling aliens (some clever alterations of period newsreel footage are utilized),  fighting Arik Soong, the ancestor of the man who created Data in Next Generation, as he releases the horror of the Eugenics Wars upon the Galaxy, an intriguing explanation on why the Klingons in the original series look so different from the Klingons in later movies and shows,  the Syrranites and the return of pure logic to Vulcan (and encountering a young T'Pau, later seen in the original series, explaining why she's so revered in Kirk and Spock's time), the Mirror Universe episodes that are a prequel to the original series ""Mirror Mirror"" and a sequel to ""The Tholian Web"" and was supposed to be a start of an ongoing storyline that, sadly, could not be continued, and, finally, a disappointing conclusion that makes the final voyage of the NX-01 a holodeck recreation on Next Generation's Enterprise D, with Commander Riker and Deanna Troi returning.

All in all, a pretty good show, but so many missed opportunities.",1386288000,,4017,4.786337209302325

I love Scott Bakula from way back .I have been watching him and his character, but this just doesn't have the same variety as Deep space Nine, It seems to concentrate way to much on the 6 main characters and not anyone else. The ship is suppose to have  some 80 people aboard it. Once they change the story line more it could get better. Its just not my first pick .",1379721600,,532,4.057142857142857

This one is a bit closer to home - set before the original series and only a few generations after the events depicted in first contact. It's a nice exploration of what it might be like for mankind's first excursions into space at faster-than-light speed.

2292676,5,B0009I7NGW,It took me a few seconds to associate the Borg ship they found in the ice in this episode and the one the NCC-1701-E destroyed in First Contact were one in the same. I have a feeling that if Enterprise had went on to have another 1 or 2 seasons we would have seen the Borg again. I did catch a mistake though with what Picard said in TNG as to not having any record of this species in LCARS and yet here they are 200 years before that. Either there was some kind of error in Starfleet records that wiped their memory banks or Q wiped the minds of Starfleet in the 22nd century.,1378857600,,577,4.026086956521739

2292678,5,B0009I7NGW,"""Star Trek: Enterprise - Complete Second Season""

""Enterprise,"" which ran from 2001-2005, was the fourth and arguably best of the Star Trek sequels, benefitting from a decade-plus of production experience built up on previous shows such as Next Generation, DS9 and Voyager.  The scripts, acting and pacing were all polished and professional, and the special effects (which look particularly good on the new BluRay edition) were a superior product. There are some anachronistic retconned plot points which were mildly problematic - mainly the revised timeline of human-Vulcan relations - but it's no biggie.

Overall, this was a very good sci-fi TV show, with a look and scope that was better than most space shows of the era. The only real downside was the awful theme song, but now, with the new digital format one no longer has to go putter around the kitchen until it's over (as I did when the show first broadcast) Now, you can just skip past it, and get into the good stuff.  ""Enterprise"" stands up surprisingly well - I was pleased to see this new edition, to revisit classic episodes I hadn't seen in over a decade, and delighted to find how entertaining they still are. Highly recommended, whether you're newcomer or an old fan! (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue film reviews)",1378771200,,1275,4.888888888888889

Enterprise the first season started at $84.00 then down to $77.00 for months..dont think they made much on them. I waited. Finally bought it UNDER $50.00. Now they are back up to $75.00! Corporate ALWAYS proves they are ALWAYS out of touch! Now the second season has started $77.00! Its like a game of FOOLS! I am not one. Can you imagine what goes on literally in the minds of these guys??? Marketing ALWAYS proves the Masses ALWAYS buy more in Quantity than the VERY small exclusive market that would ""BUY HIGH""!

The first two series are about exploration, adventure, and give you a peek into the species and relationships that bring about the United Federation of Planets.  The stories have an air of fun and excitement, and they make you wish you were seated on that bridge with a job to do.

Unfortunately, in season 3 (which I am currently viewing) they flush all that down the toilet in an attempt to create a dark drama.  My suspicion is that it is series 3 which ultimately brought about the demise of this program.  It is an utter bait and switch and feels like watching a completely different program.

My favorite stories from Enterprise involve time travel, the Temporal Cold War, and the beginnings of Section 31. And I was one of the theme song haters at first, but by this season I had come to appreciate ""Where My Heart Will Take Me"" as it just fit the theme of the show. It really had a great cast and great storylines, up until the arguable Xindi debacle. This season had some great episodes - first contact with alien races, ""Carbon Creek"", and ""Regeneration"" (with the Borg). Unlike the other Star Trek series, this ship is full of inexperienced and optimistic crew members who are on the front lines of space exploration. Every experience is new and exciting for them.  The addition of the featurettes make this a must for any Enterprise fan.

This series has a special, supportive comradery that pulls the viewer in. I enjoyed this show when it was on TV and I have recently enjoyed it again, watching it on Amazon Prime. This is out of this world.",1377388800,,359,4.294117647058823
2292692,5,B0009I7NGW,I was not a ST fan until this series. It sparks my interest to check out other ST series. Not one boring episode.,1377388800,,113,3.9565217391304346
2292693,4,B0009I7NGW,"This series is still following the model of the Star Trek series, providing a wholesome TV experience while taking up today's issues and controversies for a good message.",1377302400,,170,5.107142857142857
2292694,5,B0009I7NGW,"I think there's little question that Season Two of 'Enterprise' topped Season One in its quality of storytelling.  The character development seemed more cohesive, the actors looked as though they were finally settled into their roles, and the writing was better.

The quality of the Blu-Ray treatment for Season Two also appears to be a big improvement over Season One.

The big treat me for me is newly-produced VAM (Value-Added Material).  Series co-creator/producer Brannon Braga sits down with the entire main cast (yes, all seven including Jolene Blalock) for a candid, casual discussion.  This is very much like the 'TNG' cast sitting down together for the Season Two Blu-Ray of 'TNG,' except the 'ENT' actors are very candid and not afraid to talk about the controversial stuff.  The three-part documentary is also very informative.

My favorite episodes this season include ""Marauder,"" ""Carbon Creek"" (one of the finest Trek episodes period!), ""Regeneration,"" ""Minefield,"" and ""Stigma.""  In fact there are so many good episodes that the less-than-stellar episodes seem pretty good.

Overall this is well worth the price, even though it didn't sell for $59.99 on release day, like the first four seasons of 'TNG' and the first season of 'ENT' did.",1377216000,,1254,5.23
2292695,4,B0009I7NGW,"Most folks (especially ""Trek"" fans) should be familiar with the fate of ""Enterprise"", the last franchise TV series that ran from 2001-05 before being cancelled.  Like most ""Trek"" installements it started out a bit rough and improved steadily...but just as things were getting really good in Season 4, the plug was pulled.  Season 2, therefore, shows a marked improvement over the first year, as the series gradually shifted from ""adventure-of-the-week"" stories to a more serialized format.  Plenty of highlights here, including ""Carbon Creek"", ""Future Tense"" and the cliffhanger finale ""The Expanse"", with only a few duds in the bunch.  ""Enterprise"" typically has a bad reputation among the ""Trek"" faithful, but this second season has a pretty good batting average and, of course, things get ever better from here on out.

CBS' Blu-ray package isn't as impressive as their work on ""TNG"", but what is?  This filmed-for-HD series looked good in its time but many scenes lack the crisp appearance of newer shows, and the sub-HD CGI effects also show their age on occasion.  It's obvious that less work was put into the remastering than ""TNG"", but it's still a watchable show that looks fairly good for what it was.  But the extras really sell this set, as we get several hours' worth of new supplements that, like the first season, are painfully honest in every way.  Series creators Rick Berman and Brannon Braga are on hand to detail some of the problems behind-the-scenes, while the actors are also forthcomiing about what worked and what didn't.  Overall,  it's a nice change from the surface-level, back-patting interviews that clog up most modern DVD and Blu-ray releases.  Without these extras I'd be much less inclined to recommend this set enthusiastically, but they're that good!

So it's a bit expensive, but in my opinion worth the sticker price if you're an established or curious new fan of the series.  You might be frustrated after shelling out so much for the DVDs almost a decade ago, but this Blu-ray release shows a marked improvement all across the board.  Definitely worth looking into!",1377129600,,2105,5.025936599423631
2292696,5,B0009I7NGW,"The first time I watched Enterprise was on a pirate DVD in Baghdad. Just got this Aug. 20,2013,yesterday. This is just the best BR I've ever seen. I first watched the full cast interview. That alone was worth the price to me. Then the 1st and 2nd episodes. WOW!",1377043200,,261,4.346938775510204
2292697,5,B0009I7NGW,"I have to confess that I never dreamed I would enjoy a Star Trek series as much as I did STAR TREK: ENTERPRISE.  Sure, I've seen various incarnations of Star Trek in the past, including the original series with Kirk and Spock, the Next Generation with Picard, and even a few movies after that.  But none of them struck a chord with me as much as Enterprise; this show is darker and grittier than its predecessors, which gives it a nice twist in a familiar universe.

Prior to watching this second season, I had to track down season one on Netflix and tear through it.  It was not hard to do, either, because once I started watching it, I was hooked!  This show has more spirit and heart than any Trek series before it.

STAR TREK: ENTERPRISE is set 100 years prior to the original Kirk missions, when humanity is just reaching out into the stars.  For this reason, most everything is new, including the protocols for how humans interact with aliens and such.  This is the primary draw for me, the true unknown and how we deal with it.

The series is done very well from a production standpoint.  It looks great onscreen and no expense is spared when it comes to special effects; the aliens look original and the computer animation is tight.  From a television standpoint, science-fiction doesn't get much better than this.

Season two picks up right where one left off, and let me tell you: it's intense.  I will not divulge anything else, so as to not give anything away, but I was very pleased.  In fact, I'm pleased with the whole season, and I am looking forward to watching the whole series.

STAR TREK: ENTERPRISE is a big win for me, and if you're a fan of science-fiction, this will be a must-have.  Be sure and check it out on Blu-ray, too...the sometimes low-picture quality on Netflix was disappointing, but seeing the show in HD is stunning.  Not to mention the plethora of Special Features that come along with it.  Regardless of what format you choose, though, I highly recommend giving this show a look.",1377043200,,2018,4.542936288088643

The HD streaming from Amazon is generally good. There are times when the quality drops out of HD and usually requires a page refresh to get the HD stream going again, this doesn't happen very often and is not to the point of being an annoyance.

2292712,5,B0009I7NGW,"In Season 2 you have the cast comfortably inhabiting their characters and a well-established dynamic at work on board the Enterprise. You have a further exploration of the Human-Vulcan-Andorian relationship. Some of my personal favorite episodes were the unorthodox tale from T'Pol's in Carbon Creek with her ancestor's involvement in the actual First Contact between Vulcans and Humans; Dead Stop which was one of the creepiest episodes of Trek ever executed; Dawn which gave us Trip's Enemy Mine experience; while Stigma and Cogenitor explore ethical questions; Regeneration shows us the consequence of Picard's crew conflict with the Borg seen in the movie ""First Contact;"" but the best episode for me was First Flight. A great conflict of egos in making the first historic flight of the Warp 2 engine. Archer finds out his friend and rival, A.G.Robinson, died in an accident. He relates to T'Pol (in flashback form) while in the NX test program, A.G. broke the warp 2 barrier, but ignored orders to go to sub-light and instead pushed the ship to the point where it was destroyed but ejected safely. Robinson blamed the engine design (by Archer's father), which heightened Vulcan caution and Starfleet brass into shelving the NX program indefinitely. Archer is angry, along with his new friend Lt. Charles ""Trip"" Tucker, leading to a bar fight with A.G. After the fight, Archer and A.G. steal the last NX test vehicle and with a modification made by Trip to allow them to fix the engine problem in flight, they succeed in proving that there wasn't a design flaw in the engine. You can tell how this contentious start created an enduring and deep friendship between Archer and A.G. You can feel the sense of loss in Archer and the compassion of T'Pol in suggestion of naming the nebula after Robinson.

The events of 9/11 intrude upon the Star Trek with the introduction of the Xindi arc in the season finale, The Expanse. Earth is attacked by an unknown alien species and the Enterprise is sent off to investigate and respond to this assault that killed 7 million humans including Trip's sister. So the optimistic milieu of Star Trek is subverted into the fear and paranoia of our post-9/11 culture. This theme will be explored in the 3rd season but it made the end of Season 2 a bit depressing which, thankfully, is a rare event in the Star Trek universe.",1373155200,,2359,4.8535980148883375

2292720,3,B0009I7NGW,"This  saga  of Enterprise  is suppose to be  on the  time  previous  to  the  time of James T Kirk's  Star  Trek Season.

They are starting to  create  their own  protocols of security,  Federations od Planets  does not  exists yet. So  in this scenario ,  adventures  becomes a little boring sometimes.  Sometimes  the scenes  look  pretty  similar  to  scenes  inside a submarine  are actually  boring.

However,  it is nice to know  what happened  in the period  between  the  CocKraine's  first  warp  tip  and  the voyages of  the Starship Enterprise on the tiome of  Kirk and  his  crew.",1371686400,,728,4.767241379310345
2292721,5,B0009I7NGW,Carbon creek is my favorite Enterpise episode. The fact the Tapal has only known the other members of the crew for a year and yet shares a story abour a family member her 2ND Fore morther is a great early sign of the closeness the will come to be between the 3 main characters of Trip Archer and Tapal. I have often found it interesting how the writers for any Star Trek series has to loosen the emotional control of all vulcans in a show so we as viewers can gain empathy with them.  Because if they held true to to the philosophy of Vulcans they would be the most boring people in the show. Jolene Blalock is at her best in playing both roles. And of course you cannot ignore the clothesline scene either. Time travel and flash back showa have always been my favorite storylines.,1371686400,,781,4.312925170068027

2292726,5,B0009I7NGW,I enjoyed this season even though it was my least favorite season of Enterprise. These episodes were like classic star trek episodes where the story was all contained in one episode. My favorite episode of this season had to be Regeneration with the Borg making an appearance. My least favorite was A Night in Sickbay and Cogenitor. I thought they both contained boring plots. I like most star trek episodes out there and was disappointed when this was cancelled.,1370390400,,463,4.8734177215189876
2292727,5,B0009I7NGW,Love the character development - I wish this series had been put into syndication so that it would have continued beyond 4 seasons. Enterprise's ratings were actually HIGHER than Mad Men's but not good enough for commercial TV.,1370217600,,227,5.0
2292728,5,B0009I7NGW,"A very underrated series that is the ""prequel"" to the rest of the Star Trek shows and movies.  Season 2 is even more cohesive than Season 1 (which already seemed to have far better cast integration than I'd expect for a first season TV series), with good acting, strong plot lines, and a lot of action.  Themes and storylines are built from episode to episode, but most of the shows in Season2 are standalone.

It's approachable for non-trekkies, but Trekkies will love it.  Strong acting, interesting plots, nice (for the time) graphics, and a lot of precedent-setting stuff happening before the Federation existed.  Unlike Voyager (the prior series), there's a lot less ""how could they be that stupid??"" moments.  All those times you watched Voyager and were annoyed by all the stuff they didn't do-- when they didn't fight back, when they talked slowly instead of firing, when they were defeated by virtually everything they encountered and were usually saved by accident or by outside forces rather than their own efforts and skills?  This show doesn't do that.  You think ""Captain Archer should punch that guy in the face!"" and lo and behold, Captain Archer does punch that guy in the face!  The lack of bumbling makes this series feel much more real, and much more watchable.

I briefly watched ""Enterprise"" when it first aired, but broadcast was a terrible way to watch shows like this.  Streaming in HD without commercials makes for a far superior experience.

But I do enjoy the escapism combined with the observations about humanity that science fiction provides in general. All that said, I find that this series, Star Trek Enterprise enjoys and benefits from its excellent pedigree; it pays sufficient homage to it's roots in Roddenberry's universe for most fans to feel at home, and it avoids egregious contradiction of that word. It's rather fun to see the Star Trek universe in an earlier time when the technology is not so powerful, though of course, still way ahead of our current reality. I also find that the actors are excellent, and the writing creates good three dimensional roles for them (though the bulk of the Earth-based Vulcans are perhaps a little too stick in the mud, but that creates a good foil for the enthusiasm of humans not yet bounded by the prime directive.)",1361836800,,969,4.739644970414201

We do get to know characters better and we do see the Enterprise crew getting their space legs. The pacing of this season, similar to Season 1, is a bit off. It is definitely worth watching to prepare you for the phenomenal arcs that come in Season 3 and Season 4 of Enterprise. To please the avid Trekkies out there, we also get introduced to some really important Star Trek races (like the Romulans) and see many explorations of how familiar notions like the Prime Directive were formed.

What NO ONE takes into account when standing back and reviewing ENTERPRISE is that this happened to be the Star Trek show on the air during the United States being attacked on 9/11. Now they could have done a ""message"" episode  TOS-Style. Remember, the TOS episode that covered racial inequality all in one neat little episode, that had 2 actors painted half white and half black on their faces..lol. Now the writers for ENTERPRISE had a thing called a conscious. They could not sum up what tore into the USA'S very soul on 9/11, in one neat little episode. So enter the Xindi Threat, going to destroy the Earth. So when you begin to badmouth ENTERPRISE again, remember 9/11. What other choice did the writers have. Now BEFORE 9/11 happened we can watch Season 2 of ENTERPRISE, which had terrific episodes, such as, MINEFIELD, DEAD STOP, A NIGHT IN SICKBAY, PRECIOUS CARGO and CATWALK.

When it became obvious where the episode was going I had to stop for a few minutes to determine if I could actually follow through with watching it.  Was it freedom offered or was it damnation?  I can argue that the Cogenitor would have known better than to involve itself with Trip, but obviously the issue was unheard of in it's society, that no steps were taken to avoid such a predicament.  What was hard was the realization that how the episode ended was probably the easiest and possibly the only way the writer's could have ended it.  I'm sure others will disagree.  What is awesome about this episode is that even as I write this review I cannot decide which side of the argument my thoughts lie and that is the sign of a good story.  Is it better to walk in the light for even a moment than to never have seen the light at all?

For the past 50 years of Star Trek the Ponn Farr has been an exclusively Vulcan male condition....but I guess that's not true. That makes me doubt the motives of this silly sub plot, but whatever it provided some goofy uncomfortable moments. The kind of goofy uncomfortable moments that happen in horribly written porn movies where they try and make an excuse that leads to the sex part. Basically every 7 years the Vulcans have to RAPE the nearest opposite sex (this one was forced early...by the writers) Ya know, the more I learn about Vulcans the less logical they seem.

Precisely what I think every episode...it can get a bit redundant.

This one is a Thinker....The episode starts out with a friendly first contact and allows the conflict to come from the cultural misunderstandings, a nice change in pace. We have a hard enough time here on this planet getting along with all our differences. I can't even imagine how much we are going to mess up relations with other worlds and species.

I do think the ending is a bit too harsh though (don't worry no spoilers ahead). I mean Archer has already committed mass genocide, started a war, and wiped out an entire ship of non-corporeal beings. And he is yelling at Trip for one little thing, that he wasn't even directly responsible for.

You get the idea that the Dinobleons did something horrible (like ""holocaust"" terrible), but it's such a shallow explanation it never gets interesting or makes an impact for me.

On a common sense note: So it's the year 2152 and we have warp 5 capable star ships and transporters that can teleport people kilometers to and fro....but the rock climbing technology is still from the 1930s?

2292782,4,B0009I7NGW,"The episode revolves around two sub stories...one is that T'Pol had contracted a disease that could jeopardize here career and life and the other deals with Trip being caught in the middle of a Dinobleon love triangle (the acceptable kind). I rather enjoyed learning more about Phlox and his wife, and at the same time you learn about some Vulcan prejudices, of which T'Pol finds herself on the receiving end. It's good TV and good Star Trek, but I did have a huge problem with the one issue which I'll discuss ahead...

  *SPOILER ALERT*

Something that makes no sense is how T'Pol claim she was forced to Mind Meld (almost like the writers were trying to draw comparison to rape). However this is a flat out lie and is not consistent with what actually happened. She willingly participated in the mind meld, and only asked for it to stop after a period of time. I don't know if this is bad writing or if T'Pol actually believes she is 100% innocent (which would make her a liar)",1343952000,,980,4.519774011299435
2292783,2,B0009I7NGW,"In 1985 a mediocre Sci-Fi movie came out called ""Enemy Mine"" where an Alien and a Human crash land on a desert like planet....at first they fight and almost kill each other, then they end up helping each other. I know Star Trek has been known to rip-off other Sci-Fi books and movies (and it frequently re-hashes it's own material), but this is almost straight up plagiarism. Just watch the trailer for ""Enemy mine"" and you'll have watched this episode: [...]

Aside from that whole fiasco, the episode itself was quite laborious to get through and the ending felt contrived and rushed. I'd recommend skipping this one, it's rare that I say that.",1343952000,,646,4.716814159292035
2292784,5,B0009I7NGW,"Everything about this episode just clicked for me. The plot made perfect sense, the technobabble seemed grounded and realistic, the mystery of the aliens was well thought out and executed, and I loved the vibe of the crew taking shelter and becoming closer (as Archer said ""It's like we're camping""). The turning point of the story also came at the perfect time, and I had no idea who were the good guys and who were the bad guys until near the end. Entertaining, suspenseful, with a dash of feel good comradery and teamwork.

It's a relief...I've really hated giving the past few episodes low ratings (they deserved it), so it feels good to give an honest 5 star to a deserving Star Trek Enterprise episode.",1343952000,,708,4.664
2292785,2,B0009I7NGW,"from discussing with friends some loved this one some hated it, personally I can't stand these lazy RESET type episodes where nothing seems to matter

*spoilers ahead* this review is a comment from another user...I tend to agree with almost all of it so I'll paste it here. He brings up an amazing point that is present in a lot of Star Trek. The bridge officers...and heck even just the lowly crewmen are Star Fleet. Imagine how much training an Astronaut has to go through...now increase that tenfold. And yet still some of them act dumber than a pile of rocks and seem to have no right to be on such an important mission. I wouldn't trust Hoshi to put together a 10 piece puzzle.

""The problem with ""Vanishing Point"" isn't that everything was a dream -- it's that nothing in the episode makes any sense, not even the intentionally nonsensical parts. Most importantly, this is a Hoshi episode, and while it should develop her character it only serves to make her look stupid, unobservant, shrill, and volatile. She can pass her hands through objects, yet doesn't fall through the floor. She fails to question sudden changes in Archer and T'Pol's command styles. When Crewman Baird translates the ""simple bimodal syntax,"" Hoshi doesn't seek him out or investigate his methods, choosing instead to chum around in the gym and wander the ship. She does not protest or question Archer when relieved of duty. Knowing full well that she can pass through doors and objects, she tries to operate doors and machinery with frustration. When confronted with alien invaders, she doesn't confront or make contact with them, but instead runs off to try and warn Archer.

All the careful reality tweaking is for naught because we start out with Hoshi, professional yet reasonably worried about transporters, and end up with a frantic, insecure, passive, oblivious officer who doesn't question even the basic premises of the world around her, the command structure of her ship, or demonstrate any problem-solving ability whatsoever. And this person is allowed on the bridge?

The biggest slap in the face is the ending: Phlox, Archer, and Trip prattle about how long ""it"" lasted and that ""it"" must have been a dream, but never mention what ""it"" is. A hallucination? Some kind of neuro-mixup that happened during transport? A strange re-arrangement of molecules? No, our ""explorers,"" when confronted with a potentially serious transporter malfunction, simply shrug their shoulders and exit stage left. The viewer isn't even dignified with ""ionic interference"" or ""geological phenomenon."" Not even the nonsense in this episode makes any sense.""

""Night in Sick Bay is an ensamble coalescing the cast around the Captain's dog that brings out the soul of this series."" none of that even makes sense...did you even watch it?

The episode itself is watchable, but right off the bat it's ridiculous...Why on earth is there another contrived half naked gel rubdown scene? What is the flippin' point?It was pretty obvious that the producers of this show were trying desperately to sexualize Star Trek, but c'mon there's probably pornography with better story.

There are some great moments between Malcolm and the Captain, and the writing again is top quality. A tense nail-biting episode with some of the most subtle but impressive special effect so far.

This I presume is also one of the first encounters with Romulans (both Human and Vulcan), so the episode even has a bit of a historical weight as well.

p.s. A quick question (I doubt this even deserves an answer) but wouldn't the spike that impaled Malcolm be at -460 degrees F (temperature in space)....common sense would say that would have caused instant death from severe hypothermia -- I mean his blood would freeze almost instantly even if the EV sealed and re-pressurized the puncture point.",1343865600,,806,4.875912408759124

Also; props to whoever wrote this episode, amazing work.

on a serious nit picky note: It seems to come out of left field for T'Pol because up until now she hasn't shown any capacity to be fun or playful. I hope THIS version her continues, because she is normally about as interesting as a piece of toast.",1343865600,,554,4.378640776699029

The only reason I enjoyed this episode was the polygamous Denobulans and Dr. Flox's wife hitting on poor, hapless, moral Trip.  If you've watched this series you know the Denobulans are polygamists and evidently they have no qualms about hitting on someone directly in front of one of their spouses.

Kidding aside, this episode can be safely passed over without losing much of the continuing story (what little there is at this point).  I still liked the episode, although it didn't introduce any new characterization.

""Oh, wow, not THIS episode.""

I guess that is why the writer's focused on T'Pol and her skin tight suits. It must be what kept it on the air for 4 years. Almost all the crew had a fantasy reenactment with her.

She is an excellent vulcan and out does Spock in many ways. The writers seem to like her too and manage to have her wearing little in any scene they can manage. Too bad that they want to create viewers by titillation of her instead of a good story. The writing is so bad. The stories so, so silly. Unbelievable. Nonetheless, it is an somewhat enjoyable trek through space if you let go of the story and depth. It is just disappointing that such effort was made at setting and scene and little care to the story and casting. I can see why it was canceled and wonder a little how it lasted 4 seasons. I myself never heard of it ten years ago and only recently found here. The shinning star of the show is without a doubt Jolene Blalock and she impressed me greatly. I think she can act and would have liked a lesser focus on just her physical features. The Captain, Engineer, and Tactical officers could of all been better portrayed by other actors. The most annoying character to me was the doctor. He should have just had his own show like ""House,"" if he is going to be so flippant and cutesy.

Not all the episodes, but most of them and a lasting effect that was good that had a positive influence on me as a person. I began to read Science Fiction and listen more in science class and eventually become an engineer. i believe Star Trek had a lot to do with that.

Today, I watched Star Trek Enterprise: Season 2, Episode 22 - Cogenitor, and I have not felt so moved by a Star Trek episode in decades. While I like Star Trek and was happy that there were followon subsequent series I never found many of them very inspiring.

In Star Trek: The Next Generation, there was an episode I think called ""The Flute"" that I thought was the best episode in that series, by far. The newer Star Trek series I felt sidestepped a lot of the passion and morality, even as they tried much harder to be politically correct they just did not grab me the way the original series did when I was a boy.

But this story, and some others in Enterprise ... mostly starting in Season 2, are as good as anything ever done in Star Trek, and i was really touched and impressed. By the time Enterprise came along I was not watching Star Trek anymore, and it is only now that the series is on NetFlix all the seasons basically for free that I get to see this show. I honestly think that this series is as good or better than the original series. Very impressed with the writing and ideas presented here, and the subversive way they are presented that I have not seen on TV or the mainstream media very often in the years since TV became so monolithic and corporate.

I have to say very good job and thank you to everyone involved in Star Trek Enterprise and this episode in particular. With all the special effects, the money and the talent we have, why is it that there are so few things worth watching on TV?

Beyond the usual grand story line that is provided throughout the entire Star Trek Universe, Enterprise adds an eccentric interaction between the main crew. Though not new for any Star Trek series of late, the writing, direction and acting bring out what appears to be raw emotion rather than forced and planned.

I will admit when the show first appeared that I was unsure of how Enterprise would fall into the Star Trek Universe.  I watched it here and there throughout its short time on the air (mainly due to the fact that CBS and Paramount moved its time slot around).  And I really didn't care for the show into it was syndicated on the Sci-Fi channel and others.

But once you sit down and begin to watch the show on a regular schedule and learn about each of the characters, about their fictional lives, you begin to not only appreciate the uniqueness of Enterprise but the art which was created during the production of the show. Season one through four are captivating and irreplaceable once you allow yourself to enjoy it.  I would recommend any of the seasons to any science fiction fan.",1292716800,,1187,4.628571428571429

(Released: 2005 by Paramount Home Entertainment)
Another Looong DVD Review by Joe Torcivia

Star Trek Enterprise: The Complete First Season was an unexpected pleasure.  Please read that review elsewhere on Amazon. Let's move on to Season Two!

In the beginning, Zefram Cochrine invented Warp Drive technology.  The rest was (TV, movie, and merchandising) history!

When something is great to begin with, and its follow-up is just as good, it's a wonderful thing!  And so it is with Star Trek Enterprise: The Complete Second Season.

As with all previous ""Modern TREK Series"", we resolve last season's cliffhanger, move though another solid season of surprises and delights - and, in this case, go somewhere completely unexpected in setting up the season to come.

As is our custom in these reviews, we'll break it into CONS and PROS.

The CONS:

Packaging: The packaging remains unchanged from Season One - and is such for the duration of the series.  If you like it, you like it.  I do not. Nor do I truly dislike it, but more intelligence - and dare I say ""LOGIC"" - could have been applied to the design.

Attached to the package with TWO DABS OF GLUE is a cardboard piece that wraps AROUND THE TOP FRONT, BACK, AND BOTTOM FRONT of the package!  You cannot open the package without removing the cardboard.  BUT, on this cardboard, is the ONLY PLACE that it is identified as being the SECOND SEASON!  So, if you remove it, nothing else on the package can distinguish it from other seasons.  WHY?

No Skipping the End Credits:  As with Season One, I found that the EPISODE END CREDITS - the SAME end credits that Paramount routinely shrunk, squashed, and did not allow to be read in its original UPN TV broadcasts - COULD NOT BE CHAPTER-SKIPPED on it's DVDs.  Of course, I can choose to fast forward through them, if need be.  BUT... Just thought I'd share the irony, folks!

The PROS:

Widescreen:  STAR TREK ENTERPRISE is the first TREK series to be filmed in widescreen.  When played on my HD TV and upconverted via Blu-ray player, it's a delight to behold!

Content Booklet: Each season of Star Trek Enterprise comes with an enclosed BOOKLET of about 12 pages.  Every episode of the set is described in sufficient detail to remind you of the particulars if you've seen it, or whet your appetite if you have not.  But, where this item becomes especially valuable (...particularly for a season beyond Season One), is the recap of ""The Story So Far"".  Very nice to have for a quick review, before beginning the new voyages.

Also helpful are ""Shaping the Future"", emphasis on a key episode of Season Two, and ""Long Range Scan"", a preview of things to come in Season Three.

The Episodes:

""Shockwave Part II"": Ever since STAR TREK THE NEXT GENERATION floored us with ""The Best of Both Worlds Parts I and II"", STAR TREK series have offered season-ending cliffhanger episodes!  Last season's Part One revealed more tantalizing details about the ""Temporal Cold War"" and the dire consequences for the Earth when Archer is removed from the time stream.

Part Two finds Archer marooned in the devastated 31st Century, with time-traveling ""crewman"" Daniels.  Archer's removal, in some way, leads to the United Federation of Planets never forming and the destruction of Earth's civilization.  Needless to say, the technology to return Archer to 2152 is also destroyed, leaving him and Daniels helpless and stranded.  Meanwhile, an armada of Suliban (a conspirator race in the ""Temporal Cold War"") led by Archer's foe Silik, have captured the Enterprise, demanding that First Officer T'Pol and the crew produce Archer or face death.

Other highlights include:

""Carbon Creek"": Vulcans crash-land in 1950s rural Pennsylvania! This may be one of the single greatest TREK stories ever!  (...And THAT is no small claim!)  A ""break"" story that features the regular crew only in framing sequences.

""Minefield"": Introduces us to the Romulans - though they were mentioned in an historical context in ""Shockwave Part II"".

""A Night in Sickbay"": Great character story for Archer and Doctor Phlox - and Porthos the Beagle's illness makes us all sad.

""Marauders"": Klingon raiders terrorize and plunder a small mining colony.  Archer doesn't stand for this.  Relive the days when Klingons were great villains!  Ah, such memories!

""The Communicator"": A lesson in why you should never be careless with your equipment, when observing more primitive alien cultures.

""The Catwalk"": An amazing story of the Enterprise crew ""in-exile"" aboard their own ship!  While navigating a deadly region of radiation, the crew must take refuge in a shielded maintenance shaft - for eight days.  During this period, a race immune to the danger takes control of Enterprise.

""Dawn"": A superb ""Trip and a Hostile Alien in Danger"" story.  Dawn, as in ""sunrise"", brings killer (literally) heat to the planet where the pair is stranded.

""Cease Fire"": Expands on the bitter history of the Vulcans and the Andorians, originally explored in Season One's ""The Andorian Incident"".  Both episodes are a great and unexpected spin on our impressions of the Vulcans.

""Canamar"": Archer and Trip are arrested as smugglers, and sentenced to a planetary penal colony.  I suppose every series, from LOST IN SPACE on, ends up doing one of these.

""Judgment"": Archer's life is in the hands of a worn-out Klingon defense advocate.

""Cogenetor"": Trip's interference with an alien culture has surprisingly bad consequences.  The ending will kick you in the gut, like an episode of LOST or ALFRED HITCHCOCK PRESENTS!

""Regeneration"":  No Spoilers, but I actually said ""Oh, F***!"" out loud, when I saw WHO was discovered in the Antarctic!  (Yes, sometimes it's GREAT to approach a series completely ""in the dark""!  The surprises are all the more effective!) Hooks superbly into one of the TREK feature films.  The episode commentary track reveals a great deal of TREK continuity-related controversy associated with this episode.  Me?  I had no problem, and really enjoyed it.

""First Flight"": The ""Right Stuff"" story of Star Trek's Warp Program told in flashback. Jonathan Archer and his rival A.G. Robinson compete to be the first pilot to break the Warp 2 barrier!

""Bounty"": A Tellarite Bounty Hunter captures Archer, who is regarded as a fugitive - per the events of ""Judgment"", for the Klingon Empire.

""The Expanse"":

BIG SPOILER ALERT!  BIG SPOILER ALERT!  BIG SPOILER ALERT!

(Okay, I warned you!) In its final episode of the season, ENTERPRISE takes a decidedly unexpected turn.  An orbiting weapon appears from nowhere, and fires a destructive beam at Earth!  The beam cuts a devastating swath of annihilation from Florida to Venezuela.

Enterprise is recalled from its mission, and is to return to Earth immediately.  Along the way, it is encountered by the Suliban.  Silik reveals his connection with the ""Man From The Future"", who has been behind many of the machinations of the ""Temporal Cold War"".

""Future Guy"" (as he is called in commentary tracks) reveals that the attack came from 400 years in the future - by an as of yet unknown race called ""The Xindi"".  The Xindi have preemptively unleashed their attack because Earth will destroy THEIR planet in the future.  (...Got that, so far?)

The Xindi home world exists in a ""Bermuda Triangle-like"" area of space called ""The Delphic Expanse"" where, according to our Vulcan ""friends"", strange phenomena occur and ships never return.

Enterprise is fitted with a new command center and upgraded weaponry.  It also takes on military personnel, to operate alongside its normal complement of Starfleet crewmembers. Its new mission is to locate and contact the Xindi in the PRESENT DAY, before the attack takes place.  Recall that, in the context of this series, Enterprise is the only Earth ship in existence capable of reaching the Expanse.

Archer and company head toward the Delphic Expanse... with a number of Klingon warships in pursuit, as Archer is still wanted by the Klingon Empire.  And so, we move into Season Three, and what seems to be an unprecedented season-long arc of adventure vs. the Xindi!

END OF SEASON FINALE SPOILERS!

For the casual viewer I recommend Star Trek Enterprise Season 3 which is truly excellent. Most surprising. The introduction of a long and good story arc makes this season great for fans and casual viewers alike.",1270598400,,482,4.182795698924731

I don't see it...I am going back through the entire series and all I've seen ""bad"" are one or two episodes that I think are weak, personally. In season two there is the superb ""Carbon Creek"" which answered the question of where we got Velcro. I have found ST-E to have plot depth and craftsmanship, series continuity, and character development. The time travel arcs are particularly hard hit in the forums; I think they are excellent and very well done.
  This season two collection is well done. I found no video or sound problems and a lot of extras. The menu presents a short learning curve and there is a minimum of overpackaging.
  I honestly cannot understand why this series was not more popular.",1247443200,,805,4.569444444444445

2292825,2,B0009I7NGW,"Summary:
Awesome cast, great atmosphere, but the quality of the stories varies from the best
that science fiction has to offer to the most boring imaginable.

Main review
The concept of a series taking place shortly after the First Contact Movie is a brilliant idea. But it seems a long way from the idea to realisation. Already at the end of the pilot (Broken Bow) I missed the greatness this concept potentially has. You get thrown into ""business as usually"" (rescuing, exploring etc.) way too soon. I would have loved a pilot movie plus some more shows describing the time from first contact to the launch of Enterprise. That would have been something truly new. But this pilot is just an extended version of a 08/15-show.

The cast delivers frequently - Scott Bakula is on hell of as sovereign captain, Jolene Blalock is sexy as she is intelligent and plays T'Pol with a huge amount of depth. I could continue endlessly with Phlox, Hoshi, Trip, Malcolm...  It's an outstanding team with no need to fear comparison with a Picard, Spock, Scotty...
The set designers and the costume designers all did a great job (thanks for avoiding more romper suits).

But it is difficult when there are too many boring scripts.
Especially in the first two seasons contain too many shows following the pattern:
""Landing on an alien world, been taken prisoner, making an escape."" Even the visit to Risa follows this.
Also there is ""being boarded, been held hostage, chasing away the enemy"".
Then there are some episodes like ""Shuttle pod one"". The whole show consists of a rather dry talk between Malcolm and Trip. I can't imagine something more boring.
And a lot of the shows contain just a recycled script from ""Next Generation"", ""Deep Space 9"" and ""Voyager"", such as ""Terra Nova"", ""Sleeping Dogs"", ""Dawn""...

But on the other hand you can't skip those episode - they sometimes contain important information on the characters. Therefore the waiting for the good and outstanding episodes is somewhat painful. These are the shows ""The Andorian Incident"" (I love the duplicity of the Andorians and there development into the 4th season) , ""Shockwave"", ""First Flight"" and the continuing plot about the Xindi (finally a few more star battles than in TOS, TNG and DS9).

Then when the series was already near its death the 4th season hit with power. The plot about the Augments could have been an Oscar-winning movie, and so would have been the story about the Vulcan's not been that perfect after all. The Andorians continue to deliver and the racial conflict with ""Terra Prime"" is the kind of stuff I waited 4 seasons for.

Conclusion
Seeing the 4th season there is defiantly potential for three more seasons.
But with the experiences of the first two seasons I can't blame the network for discontinuing the show.

I bought the slime line boxes and paid for each 13 British Pounds (18 US-Dollar). If I had paid the regular price for the first editions (80 Dollar) I would have been very upset.",1236988800,,2977,4.812133072407045
2292826,5,B0009I7NGW,The second season continues where the first leaves off with riviting action and a great story-line.,1234137600,,99,5.25
2292827,4,B0009I7NGW,"I'm about 1/3 of the way through the season and overall was impressed.  I watched both the original series and the TNG series while in college, but haven't followed it much since.  On a whim I tried Enterprise, Season 1 earlier this year and thought it was overall pretty good.  The writing is not at tight as what I remember from the other ST series, and I don't think that they have developed the characters as fully as they should.  However, the actors really work well in Enterprise together.

I remember the early seasons of TNG being very uneven and the actors didn't really find their groove until later seasons.  Here, I think that they actors really gelled early on, and Season 2 hits a nice stride for how well they all work together, both as actors and in character.  It's a shame that the series did not go more than 4 seasons.  I really think with more character development and a bit more direction for the series, this would have lasted the full 7 seasons that other Trek shows did.

Overall, it seems like they just kind of wander around space a lot; but it usually hangs together well.  My biggest complaint about the writing is that in a lot of episodes they didn't know where they wanted to go, and therefore the actors didn't have the right dialogue.  There are a number of times where I am watching and think that they didn't have the characters really completing their thoughts and motivations.

Best summary I can come up with:  Great ensemble cast, but not developed as fully developed as it should have been.",1224374400,,1533,4.530909090909091
2292828,5,B0009I7NGW,"In my continuing mission to watch every Star Trek ever made, Enterprise season 2 naturally comes early on. One thing I've noticed as I watch episodes one after another is that each season has a distinct feel. While season 1 was more dedicated to the aliens and the role of humanity in space, season 2 is heavy on the development of each of the bridge characters, Chief Engineer ""Trip"" Tucker most heavily. Each episode seems to be dedicated to the background of each main cast member, from Lt. Reed early on in the season with ""Minefield"" to Archer's recall of a stolen warp 2 ship to T'Pol's deeply felt pon farr episode late in the season... Far more emotive and controversy-laden than season 1, season 2 but betters the Trekie experience as humanity makes its way towards the creation of the Federation...",1218412800,,808,4.697183098591549
2292829,1,B0009I7NGW,"It is really cool to be able to download episodes and play it on the computer. The Unbox player works well, but sometimes it freezes when switching from full screen into a different mode. The down side? Well, the first disappointment was that I was not able to play the files on my Zune. The second problem is that Season 2 has two missing episodes and Amazon was not able to explain why (at least until now, and after asking twice). If the episodes are not available at least the web site should have mentioned that the season was partial. I would have given more stars but the partial set of episodes spoils the package.

I also suggest care on using the ""brightness"" and ""contrast"" controls of the ""Unbox player"". When the player is initially installed both controls are set at 50% be default, which generates a horrible image (at least on my computer).

Next DS9, haven't had the chance yet, but will eventually get to it (wasn't thrilled with the whole ""war"" premise). When Voyager came into the spotlight, I was skeptical yet again, figuring it couldn't have the real ""Star Trek feel"" being stuck in space. I didn't even watch it initially. But it is an excellent show too! Now to Enterprise - I swore to myself I'd give it a fair chance the first time around, and watched it religiously and in much anticipation for each coming week. I enjoyed the show while I was watching it, but found it to be hard to follow - especially with the multiple story arcs throughout the last two seasons. Being the devoted fan, I had to have it when it was released on DVD. I only recently opened and viewed each season, episode after episode and let me tell you, watching it in this manner made a lot of sense! I had come to realize how intricate the plots can be, the characters, multi-demensional, and the effects are truly amazing. The writers took a big, bold chance with continuing arcs, and that was a nice nod to the fans. They were not trying to carefully step on eggshells and write individual stories. They were giving a gift to fans, knowing those who were following each week would be the only ones returning for the next installment. Watching one eppy after the next, I was like, ""Wow!"" that's good writing! The characters were as they should be - newbies in the universe, and not knowing quite how to proceed. They were flawed, made bad (and good, really good) decisions. They learned from their mistakes and experiences, and grew accordingly - but never lost sight of the qualities that Roddenberry had envisioned for future of the human race.",1214179200,,1861,4.525222551928783

2292835,3,B0009I7NGW,"Star Trek: Enterprise had a bumpy beginning with its first season, with some dull shows that turned off many viewers permanently, causing a ratings slide that it never recovered from.  In its second, there were some very strong episodes and just as many clunkers and unoriginal stories rehashed from years past.  However, by the end of the second season, the episodes got stronger and reached a high point with the attack on Earth by the Xindi.

2292837,4,B0009I7NGW,"One of my good friends bought this for my graduation, as I missed seasons 1 and 2 because it ran on UPN which came in very poorly.  I have since watched season 1 on the SCI-FI channel and thought it was fun.  I love Scott Bakula as Capt. Archer.  Season 2 seemed to come together better with the characters and their inter-relationships.  I loved ""Cease Fire"".  Any episode with the andorians is great fun!  ""Regeneration"" was good, but has the problem of introducing a species that wasn't met by the Federation until TNG.  Oh, yeah.  I forgot the incredibly lame ""First Contact"" that opened this possibility up.  Overall, I felt the episodes were better written here and I enjoyed this season.  The final episode, ""The Expanse""  was a huge mistake.  After constantly ripping off original season and TNG species encounters, they missed the boat by bringing in the Xindi instead of introducing the Romulan/Federation war that would have occurred during this time period, according to Star Trek lore.",1178582400,,998,4.875
2292838,5,B0009I7NGW,"This is a solid season, Enterprises Sophomore effort. We get to see the crew really acting like family, discovering more species, learning more about the politics of space and relationships. The best episodes in my opinion were Carbon Creek, where T'pol tells Archer and Tripp about the ""real"" first contact, it is really like a mini movie within the season, I didn't want it to end. Judgement is my second favorite, Archer is brought before the Klingon High council for crimes against the empire, I love the klingons and I love that his advocate basically puts archer straight on the Klingon race, they aren't all warriors there are different classes and the intellectual class is getting sick of the whole empire being corrupted. My third favorite is The Expanse, where the zindi have killed millions of humans on earth and the ""temporal cold war"" plops right in the enterprises lap whether they want It or not, or even believe it in T'pols case, going into the expanse and the rumors that surround it reminds me of the movie ""event horizon"" where the ship goes into space and encounters strange anomalies and it messes them up severely. The rumors about the expanse have people coming out of it turned inside out and crazy. Still the enterprise wants to go into it, to save the human race while recognizing that they might have to sacrifice themselves to do so.

The worst episodes in my opinon are Precious Cargo, and Cogenitor. Precious cargo has an alien ship that needs help, and onboard is a beautiful woman who has actually been kidnapped and her and tripp escape and crash on a planet. I really hated this one, because it just reeked of TNG. Padma Lakshmi cannot act she is horrible horrible horrible and it ruins any chemistry she might have had with commander Tripp. The other one Cogenitor, again very TNG with its PC overtones and lame story line. All in all it's a wonderful season, so well written and extremely addictive and watchable.",1177632000,,1952,4.741176470588235
2292839,4,B0009I7NGW,"The Season One cliffhanger finally got my attention.  The DVDs avoid the day, date, time, and station confusion and the commercial interruptions.

However, I am not going to do that because there is more to this show during season two than several episodes. The character developement was really good, you could see the chemistry between the actors. Captain Archer was excellent and he made me think of the cowboy american mentality. Its like what Captain Picard said to spock about cowboy diplomacy.  This show really seemed to represent what I think our initial mentality would be about space. Niave and eager to explore and make freinds. In the first season I didn't really feel a connection to the storylines or characters but during this season I could not get away from it. I would recomend this show to any sci-fi fan.",1140048000,5,769,4.654411764705882

Regarding the extra features, I particularly enjoyed the pieces on Jolene Blalock and Levar Burton. It's nice to learn that Jolene Blalock grew up watching the original ST with her family. It was also refreshing to see what she actually looks like without the Vulcan hairpiece and make up. As for Levar Burton, I appreciate the fact that someone who played a role (figuratively and literally) in the revival of Star Trek is directing Enterprise.

Archer's dog Porthos getting sick and having to take care of him. ""Regeneration"" is the episode where the inactive Vulcans in Antartica try to attack the NX-01 Ship and thus are confronted.

The stories are sharp and the characters Archer, Trip, and Phlox strong.  If there is a weakness, it is in the secondary characters who are not as developed as they ought to be.

I liked several of the episodes, such as #2 Carbon Creek (story not at all bad and beautiful location/set work) and #50 First Flight. #35 Singularity was interesting, being told from the point of Hoshi spending most of the episode caught in the Transporter pattern buffer, but I thought the Borg episode, #49 Regeneration, was a mistake- very poorly handled. #31 Dead Stop had it's points with the automated repair station, nice introduction of the food replicator idea- more like in later (in time) series although I was left wanting to know just who built the thing. Most of the stories were very well done, the production values were always good.

Amazon says there are 6 easter eggs, I've found only three so far and they aren't as good as what 1st season had. The extras in general this time out aren't as good and the secrets bit really isn't (I want to see one about how they ran the various computer screens). The deleted scenes are OK but it's easy to see why most of them were deleted. This is the first time I've noticed that the episodes are listed in broadcast order but numbered by the order in which they were filmed, I think one of the extras makes some mention of this beng the case.

2292851,2,B0009I7NGW,"CONTENT

 Season one of Enterprise left the show's ratings in a precarious situation.  With 15 million viewers watching the pilot episode, the number dropped to around five million by the first season finale.  It was clear that, in order for the show to survive, the second season would have to be far more innovative in regards to storytelling.  Unfortunately, season 2 of Enterprise was one of the blandest and most average seasons of Star Trek to ever grace television sets.

The storytelling became abysmally simple.  Old plots were rehashed with new characters and setting pasted onto them.  You could tell where a plot was going within the first few minutes of an episode.  Also, the show lacked any kind of energy or urgency.  And character development throughout the season was virtually nonexistent, until the season finale.

A prime example of one season 2's rehashed plots is the episode ""Marauders.""  It employs one of the most tired and overused plots in Star Trek.  The plot can be broken down rather easily.  You have Friendly Group A (the deuterium miners) who is being preyed upon, unjustly, by Hostile Group B (the Klingons).  The Enterprise, in this case, is Neutral Group C.  Now Group C observes the problem Group A is having with Group B.  Group C may or may not (it can vary in this type of plot) try to resolve the dispute peacefully with Group B.  Of course, achieving a peaceful resolution will, ultimately, prove futile.

Now, we have to understand the composition of Friendly Group A.  Group A always has a leader who is hesitant and who always wants to play it safe.  Thus, he is ready to give into the demands of Hostile Group B.  Of course, there is always someone in group A who wants to fight against group B.  This person is often someone with a child who was widowed by Hostile Group B (or at least widowed at some point).  It can, at times, also be simply another member of Friendly Group A.

Anyway, Neutral Group C transforms into Friendly Group C when they side with Group A against Group B.  Then Group C either through combat or ingenuity (or both) manages to keep Group A safe from Group B indefinitely.  Group C then departs.

There are subtle changes that can be made in the plot that writers think viewers won't notice.  For example, Neutral Group C can assume the role of Hostile Group B.  This has been seen in the Voyager episode ""Friendship One"" and the Enterprise episode ""Terra Nova.""

This is not to say that the entire season was worthless.  However, by my count there were only ten episodes that were actually good (""Carbon Creek,"" ""Minefield,"" ""Dead Stop,"" ""The Seventh,"" ""Vanishing Point,"" ""Cease Fire,"" ""Future Tense,"" ""Cogenitor,"" ""Regeneration,"" and ""The Expanse"").  However, this leaves 16 episodes that I found either bland or just plain bad.

""Regeneration"" is my favorite episode of the season.  Despite the controversy it caused among the fans, I don't see how it destroys continuity.  ""The Expanse"" was an interesting episode, as well.  But it tries to tell too much story too fast.  Months pass in the span of a single episode.  Huge changes are made to our characters and to the ship's mission.  Considering how atrociously snore-inducing some of the episodes this season were, ""The Expanse"" probably should have been extended to at least two episodes, possibly three.

Therein lies the curse of strictly adhering to a stand-alone format.  Other science fiction shows, such as Deep Space Nine, Babylon 5, and The X-Files, were able to introduce huge changes to their shows and make it seem like a natural extension of the series.  In any case, ""The Expanse"" was a good change for Enterprise.  While the third season was never fully realized, it would prove to be far more captivating then Enterprise's first two seasons.

SPECIAL FEATURES

The Enterprise Season 2 Box Set comes with the usual mix of cast interviews and production entries.  None of it is overly insightful, but it is still interesting.  (Though, the blooper reel doesn't live up to the one seen on the previous DVD set.)  There are only a few deleted scenes on the box set.  By far the most interesting scenes were those deleted from ""The Expanse.""

However, the real gems of the special features are the audio commentaries by Mike Sussman and Phyllis Strong.  They are insightful, interesting and, at times, humorous, and its obvious that the writers do indeed care about Star Trek and try to tell a good story.  The text commentary by the Okudas is, principally, filler, often citing obscure references to previous episodes or pointing out when the screens on computer terminals change.

SOUND/IMAGE

The image quality of the show is incredible.  However, I did notice one ""blip"" in one scene.  It was probably an imperfection on the film.  (I know that seems excessive, but I'm reviewing this thing, right?)  Both the 2.0 and 5.1 sound mixes were adequate, though I never felt blown away, which is something you'd expect from a series that emphasizes action and adventure.

The DVD menus also feature some rather impressive CG Klingon ships.  Though, after a time, not being able to skip the menu sequence becomes an annoyance.

PACKAGING

The packaging is virtually identical to the season 1 box set.  While the packaging is extremely sturdy, it is far too elaborate.  Given the specious quality of a number of episodes, it was often difficult determining whether attempting to retrieve a disc was worth it.  The set also comes with a booklet episode guide.  It serves its purpose.  However, I still preferred the episode guide located on the back of the box on the Voyager DVDs.

I only recommend this box set to the most diehard of Enterprise fans, for those people who need to own every hour, regardless of quality.  But there are a few episodes in here that should appeal to a majority of the fans.  All in all, season 2 was the series' low point, while seasons 3 and 4 were something of a renaissance for the show.  So keep an eye out for the Season 3 Box Set due out on September 20th.",1125187200,5,6029,4.762088974854932
2292852,5,B0009I7NGW,"Star Trek ""Enterprise"" is my favorite incarnation of the Star Trek franchise, although I love them all.  Enterprise features a cooler looking ship, more realistic weapons and equipment, and a connection with the present day (it is only about 150 years in the future) all of which I find make this series really appealing.

The second season of Enterprise features mostly excellent episodes that showcase the excellent acting abilities and good chemistry of the cast.  Captain Archer really becomes the captain by this second season, and the characters of the other main cast are nicely developed as well.  T'Pol's role as science officer becomes nicely complex, as she struggles with her divided feelings toward the illogical and brash humans, who nevertheless surprise her with their achievements and unexpected abilities to cope with problems.  Dr. Phlox is simply fabulous.  Trip, Travis, Hoshi, and the rest of the ""Senior Staff"" all develop well in this second season.

There are some really fine episodes in this second season.  A couple of my favorites are Carbon Creek and Cogenitor.  Both of these were panned by critics, but I found them to be insightful and moving stories.  Go figure.  How anyone who likes Star Trek could fail to enjoy Carbon Creek (the story of an early accidental visit to Earth by a Vulcan survey team) is simply beyond me.  The interactions between the Vulcans and Earthmen in this episode (really a story about how a small 1950s American town is perceived by the highly technological Vulcans) is first-rate.  Cogenitor deals with the Enterprise's encounter with a three-sexed race of beings who are more advanced technologically than Earthmen, but who harbor, from a human point of view, downright inhumane attitudes towards their third sex.  Problem is, it is not clear that the human point of view should predominate, and therein lies an excellent story.  Some very good acting in this episode, in my opinion, particularly in the ending scenes between Trip and Archer.

Star Trek purists have criticized Enterprise for not hewing perfectly to the overall Star Trek history, and this is a valid criticism.  I found that once I got past this issue, the Enterprise series nonetheless is great entertainment and it is a shame that Enterprise only went for 4 seasons.  One of the best things about this series is that here, space and alien civilizations are new, the technology of the Enterprise is somewhat untested.  This gives a freshness and sense of wonder to the series that the otherwise excellent Next Generation Star Trek, in particular, lacked.  (There, in my opinion, space was too well-travelled, the alien races too familiar.)

One thing that I did not care for in this series was the repeated use of the time travel theme.  In my opinion the wonders of interstellar travel should provide an infinite amount of thematic material, and there is no need to resort to implausible time travel scenarios.  What could be more interesting than the findings of Earth's first deep space interstellar spacecraft?  There is no need for time travel stories, and I would have been happier had the series omitted altogether the ""Temporal Cold War"" theme.

Overall, the second season of Enterprise sees the series approach its very excellent potential.  This is a must have for all of us Star Trek lovers and will provide hours of enjoyable viewing.",1125187200,5,3378,5.019748653500898
2292853,4,B0009I7NGW,"""Star Trek: Enterprise"" was one of the best shows on television, and it was sad that the show ended while still in it's prime. Thankfully, though, the show has been given a second life with the DVD release of the show throughout 2005.

Season Two of the show is, arguably, the show's worst season. The middle of the season was let down by substandard writing, which can destroy shows easily (Though ""Buffy: The Vampire Slayer"" was able to survive after the disasterous Seasons Five and Six).

But that's not to say that the season itself is horrible. Even with the middle-season slump, the season still had some great episodes. It began well, with great episodes such as ""Shockwave Part Two,"" ""Carbon Creek,"" ""Minefield,"" ""Dead Stop, and ""A Night In Sickbay"" at the beginning. And at the end, great episodes such as ""Judgment,"" ""Horizon,"" ""Cogenitor,"" ""Regeneration,"" ""First Flight,"" and the season ending classic ""The Expanse"" proved that the show still had life to it, setting up for the events for the epic Season Three ""Xindi"" story-arc.

Season Two of ""Star Trek: Enterprise"" presents the season with great picture and sound, and some fantastic extras that will definitely entertain. Any fan of the show will want to put this DVD in their ""Star Trek"" collection today.

2292854,5,B0009I7NGW,"This is considered to be the worst season of the four year run of Enterprise, if that's true, I can't wait to see the next two because I thought this season was excellent.

I have the first season and now the second and I have fallen in love with this series. I've been a hardcore Trek fan for about two or three years and I wasn't able to see ENT until I bought these DVDs. Let me tell ya, these episodes are fantastic. I highly recommend getting every season of Enterprise. Great stuff",1124150400,,487,4.236559139784946
2292855,4,B0009I7NGW,"Although it wasn't a perfect season, the second year of ""Enterprise"" found the show experimenting, visiting more traditional Trek story territory and developing a new story arc for season three tracking down an alien race called the Xindi in a portion of the galaxy called the Expanse. While the middle of the season sagged with predictable episodes that fell into the typical Voyager category of alien of the week type episodes, the end of the season picked up the momentum established at the beginning of season two. The best episodes offered a lot of promise that would pay off with seasons three and four.

Season two started off with a bang with the second part of ""Shockwave"". We discover that Earth is toast and Archer is trapped 900 years in the future by crewman Daniels a plant from the future who was sent to Enterprise to prevent elements of the Temporal Cold War from altering the future. Archer must try and find a way back though as Daniel's future has been destroyed along with the time traveling device that allowed he and Archer to be wisked away to future Earth.

""Carbon Creek"" documents the ""true"" first contact between Vulcans and humans. A Vulcan survey ship crashlands on Earth in 1950's America with T'pol's grandmother as the surviving commander. They must blend in and become part of the small town they've crashed near if they are to survive as they aren't sure that their distress call has been received.

""Minefield"" is a bottle show with some truly clever visual effects and tense direction. Lt. Reed (Dominic Keating)must remove a cloaked mine that has attached itself to Enteprise when they accidently enter a Romulan minefield.

In ""Dead Stop"" Archer discovers he has a high price to pay for repairs and upgrades to the Enterprise made at a automated dry dock. The repairs are marvelous and take less time than Starfleet could do them in but there's a horrible price tag attached he's unaware of.

""Singularity"" plays like a thematic variation on ""The Naked Time"" when the Enterprise crew begins displaying obsessive-compulsive behavior that puts the crew in danger as they near a Singularity in a trinary star system.

In ""Future Tense"" the Enterprise crew discovers a spaceship from the future which both the Tholians and Suliban claim as their own. The ship is taken aboard Enterprise but begins having a nasty effect on the crew and ship.

""Cease Fire"" introduces the Andorians again when Archer is called in to mediate a dispute between the Andorians and the Vulcans over a planet no bigger than Earth's moon. It seems both lay claim to it and both believe it provides a strategic advantage. When a battle breaks out over the planet, Enterprise finds itself right in the middle of it all.

""Regeneration"" lived up to its title as the script caused controversey. It seems that the remains of the Borg Sphere from ""First Contact"" are discovered in the Arctic by a Starfleet crew. When the Borg are revived Archer and Enterprise are recalled to help prevent the Borg from causing the assimilation of Earth. This clever episode does a nice job of tying both ""The Next Generation"" together with Enterprise. It's a interesting, well written episode that is also very
suspenseful.

One of the finest episodes recounts how Archer was involved in testing his father's warp engine design, the competition between him and another pilot (a marvelous turn by Robert Carradine) to fly it and to become captain of Enterprise. It's a great episode that captures Trek at its finest and ranks among the best the series produced.

""The Expanse"" sets the stage for the third season. An alien probe comes to Earth destroys a huge area from Florida to South America. The Suliban summon Archer to offer help; it seems the Xindi have, somehow, found out that humanity will destroy them in the future. The probe was a test to see if their weapon could destroy humanity. Archer and his crew are sent into the Expanse an area of the galaxy that can drive people mad to track down the Xindi and prevent them from launching a much larger version. Taking along a crew of Marines to help Enteprirse and her crew will up the tension during season three.

While season two wasn't perfect (the 8 episodes I highlighted were among the best with others ranging from good to poor), it had more than enough strong episodes to make ""Enterprise"" worth a look. The real treat here, though, are some of the extras included deleted scenes, four commentary tracks (two text, two audio), a very funny gag reel with flubs, two strong featurettes on Levar Burton (who directed a number of ""Trek"" and ""Enterprise"" episodes) and Jolene Blalock. There's also a glimpse behind the curtain with ""Inside 'A Night in Sickbay'"", photo galleries and a number of very cool Easter eggs.

Once again the packaging is very nice with a hardplastic outercase to protect the DVDs (which are on plastic DVD holders like those used for the ""DS9"" and ""Voyager"" series). We also get a booklet with a synopsis of each episode which is great for people like me who can't remember which episodes are which. All in all, a fine job from Paramount. While you're paying a premium for this series, you're also getting terrific transfers (although the digital artifacts for ""Cease Fire"" were awful and numerous)and some terrific extras.",1123977600,3,5299,4.823788546255507
2292856,5,B0009I7NGW,"I usually rent these but I made an exception for this one.

Enterprise bridges the gap between first contact and the 60's show that started it all.

In season 2 insight is gained into Vulcan-Human and Vulcan-Andorean relations. A host of species are introduced including the first Romulan Human encounter.

The video quality is outstanding despite the fact that I am projecting this onto a 10 foot screen with no hint of pixelization or movement artifact in fast moving scenes. The colour rendering is phenomenal and much better than previous star trek dvd's.

The audio quality is true 5.1.

2292857,4,B0009I7NGW,"Star Trek Enterprise had the distinction of being the series that ruined an almost forty year old franchise. But in the end it's only crime was bad timing, the creators total disregard to continuity,as well as wasting time putting around the galaxy, and focusing on the confusing Temporal Cold War while fans wanted to see the early days of Starfleet leading up to the founding of the United Federation of Planets.

By the time of the second season, it was pretty obvious that Enterprise was a disappointment to viewers who felt the show direction was weak as well as ""Franchise Trek"" becoming stale (indicated by 2002's Star Trek Nemesis's poor box office performance). After the follow-up to the excellent first season finale (Shockwave pt II),the season consisted of weak episodes(Precious Cargo, Canamar,The Crossing,Horizon, and the terrible A Night in Sickbay),among some of it's finest(Carbon Creek, Minefield, Stigma, Future Tense,Judgment,Cogenitor, Regeneration, and the best Enterprise episodes ever,Dead Stop ).Fans who first tuned in to see how the steps were taken for the UFP to be formed(which would be touched upon during the last episodes of the fourth and final season) had to contend with two seasons worth of ""Boldly Going Nowhere.

By the end of season two,sensing a change in directionwas needed, the show took on a different course as Enterprise respond to an attack on earth (""The Expanse"", an allusions to 9-11), and try to stop the Xindi race from developing a weapon of mass destruction. This story arc continued into the third season,resulting in some of the best episode ever filmed. Unknown to the cast and crew,the problematic show was halfway through it's run.",1122681600,3,1693,5.152727272727272
2292858,5,B0009I7NGW,"I love the shows, but for a hundred dollars, I hate the quality.  The very first disk had the episodes numbered wrong.  I ended up watching them out of order and was thoroughly confused.  The episodes are listed, left to right, from the top, as: 028 - Shockwave pt2; 027 - carbon creek; 029 - minefield; 031 - dead stop.  Of course, I watched 28, then 29, then I noticed the mix up.  Carbon creek should be 29 and minefield should be 30.  What an annoyance.  One that should not exist for $100.  It would be nice if Paramount would replace the disk with a corrected version, but I won't hold my breath.  Again, I the consumer, will be forced to accept an inferior product, because we all know, you can't return an open DVD.

I will also take this opportunity to voice my complaint that you are forced to watch an opening cut scene that lasts for 20 seconds.  I know it's not much, but I should be able to skip it if I want to.  I also noticed that you cannot skip the credits, you must simply fast forward them.  I hate that.

2292859,5,B0009I7NGW,"Okay, let me start of and say that I didn't watch Enterprise when it aired on UPN. (I think that I was reluctant to watch it because I was a big TNG fan) SO one day, I decide to take a risk and buy Season 1 of Enterprise, I loved it! Season 2 is even better. The cast seems to click a lot better and there are some awesome story lines. Here are my Fav episodes of Season 2.

Shockwave part 2

I love the temporal Cold War! Plus it is the conclusion to the cliffhanger.

Minefield

Really good character development with Archer and Malcolm

A Night in Sickbay

some people talk crap about this episode but I thought it was brilliant! I love Porthos and also this episode gives some major character development to Archer and Phlox. Also, a good episode about humility.

The Communicator

The Prime Directive goes right down the drain in this one. Everything gets screwed up!

Precious Cargo

Trip ends up with a beautiful princess...need I say more?

Cease Fire

Wonderful episode that gives Starfleet more leverage in the Interstellar community

Future Tense

Tholians, Soliban...Another Temporal Cold War theme!

Regeneration

Any epidode with the BORG is awesome!!

First Flight

This episode is probably at the top of my list. I thought it showed so much of who Captain Archer was. The beginning of the NX program and even a bar fight!

The Expanse

This episode totally starts a whole new saga to Enterprise. Not only does Archer have to deal with the Temporal Cold War but now it gets even more messed up with a race called the Xindi. This episode surely wets the appetite for season 3! I cant wait for it.

I believe Enterprise could be a smash hit in syndication. I have fallen in love with this series!",1122595200,4,1709,4.519607843137255
2292860,4,B0009I7NGW,"Let's face it - Voyager was probably the weakest Star Trek. Not that there was a lot wrong with it, but it was just a retread. The promise of Enterprise was that it would tell of the beginnings of Startfleet and the Federation. It did do that, but not really enough. It should have introduced more than just two of the older races (other than the ever present Klingons) and should have led up to the Romulan War in the 5th season. The Temporal Cold war was a mis-step. With the Orions and other mysterious races, there was plenty to tangle with.

However, it was also a better Start Trek than Voyager and maybe even TNG in that it had a cohesive cast without the stupid perfection of the characters. Like all ST, some episodes are better than others, but in the end the problem with ENterprise was the network. UPN is just not a major channel. If they had also franchised it like they did with Voyager, it would have done a lot better.

I have a feeling that in the future it will be considered, along with DS9, as one of the better versions of ST, along with the original. Maybe they'll do a few movies. It would be funny if it repeated the success of TOS in syndication.

And Season two was generally good and worth purchasing.",1122422400,2,1229,4.334782608695652

2292863,5,B0009I7NGW,"First off let me say that I am a huge Trek fan. I loved TOS, and thought TNG was a bit too cerebral; not enough phaser fire and maneuvering for my taste. When DS9 came out they completely lost me until Voyager. Even though Voyager had some strange characters, for instance the clown fish Neelix, I really could not miss it. They ended it in the right way too. Then Enterprise. They picked my favorite actor to play Captain Archer, and the crew was OK too. Some of my favorite episodes came in the second season: Carbon Creek, DeadStop, Regeneration were among them. Unfortunately someone got nervous about the writing which was getting better with each episode and came up with that season long battle to save Earth from the Xindi in year three.

Year two featured my favorite Episode. It was called Deadstop. THe crippled Enterprise, far from home, needed help to be able to get back to warp drive over Warp 2. Like magic a ""Repair Station"" appears and conforms itself to fit the ship and account for the crews taste in food and enjoyment. All for the price of a little warp plasma? Archer senses this is too good too be true and he is right when his helmsman is killed in an ""accident."" You'll have to watch the story to see how it turns out.

-Enterprise- A show just not given enough time. In a day when reality rules apparently there is just not enough money to put quality Sci-Fi on network TV anymore. What a shame that Enterprise was cancelled. jetsax",1121299200,29,1459,4.481203007518797
2292864,4,B0009I7NGW,"Science Fiction TV shows are a mixed bunch, ranging from brilliant (Stargate SG1) to lackluster (Battlestar Galactica) So I wasn't sure what Star Trek Enterprise would be like when I first tuned in to watch that first episode. Coming off of ""Star Trek: Voyager,"" it had a lot it had to live up to. When I tuned in that first night, I was staggered at how well the show was crafted and put collectively. We really enjoyed everything about the series; the cast of characters, the ship's design, and the caliber of actors involved. I knew right away that this development would be ""must-see"" TV for me, and a supplementary superior Star Trek series.
Enterprise quickly became one of my favorites out of the Star Trek series. I was surprised to find that I enjoyed it more than ""Deep Space 9"" and ""Voyager"". Everything from the plots, the excellent array of characters and excellent acting has made me really enjoy the show. The music in particular, is fantastically adapted to suit the show's specific tone. David Barrett and Jim Charlston's strong directing make the action scenes frenetic and electrifying. The A-list cast, (especially Scott Bakula as Cap. Jonathan Archer) convince in their roles. If the show has a flaw, it's the sometimes unconvincing special effects. But the stories are so well-written it's impossible not to get engrossed in the action. When Season 3 rolled around, I was absolutely astounded to see how much Enterprise had bettered over my already massive admiration for the show. I was exceptionally pleased when they gave the show the added ""Star Trek"" to the title. It had more than earned that title. The Xindi, T'Pol's new look, and the addition of the MACOs to the crew were all excellent ways to make the show even better. One of my favorite Trek shows, it is certainly one of the most thrilling. Gene Roddenberry would approve.",1121299200,21,1858,4.827586206896552

However, every Star Trek series does not have to be the best ever to be great.  The same is true of every season of Star Trek.  I believe season two is the weakest season of Enterprise.  However, it is far superior to season 1 of TNG, or season 2 of Voyager.  In fact this series and even this season has some real gems.  ""Minefield"" gives us the first taste of the Romulans.  ""Dead Stop"" gives us a great eerie, computer controlled, alien space station.  ""Stigma"" is one of the greatest prejudice episodes yet written.  This episode blows the original series episode ""Let That Be Your Last Battlefield"" out of the water.  ""Cease Fire"" is as good as any episode in the Andorian story arc.  The Andorian story arc and the development of the Shran character is truely one of the best stories in all of Trek.  ""Cogenitor"" was another blow you out of the water episode about imposing one's morals on other cultures.  ""Regeneration"" was a cool episode that brought the Borg to Enterprise with minimal continuity issues.  Finally, ""The Expanse"" kicked off the Xindi story arc, one of the most compelling in Star Trek history.  Give Enterprise a chance.  It is great stuff!",1121212800,3,1304,4.644736842105263
2292866,4,B0009I7NGW,"Enterprise was the only Trek series that I watched entirely from beginning to end. TNG I didn't get into until about 3 years in, when it went to wide syndication. Even so, when they repeated seasons 1 and 2 episodes, most of them were awful. I started watching DS9, but tuned out after a few episodes, as it got really lame really fast. Same with Voyager. Both DS9 and Voyager brought me back when I caught them in later seasons after they had improved.

Compared to TNG, DS9 and Voyager, Enterprise had more quality episodes in seasons one and two than all of those combined. Easily half of the episodes from Season two of Enterprise were top form Trek and Sci-Fi. Season one has many more.

Personally, I loved Season one of Enterprise. Season two was better than I initially thought. I was disappointed when the plots and stories didn't expand very much. But beyond that, they were still quite good. And when they did expand into a long arc for Season 3, we discovered that the writers were incapable of developing a huge story, and had to throw a bunch of inferior filler episodes in to keep the season going. Season 4 was much stronger and better developed all the way around.

So to me, Seasons 1 and 4 were the best. 2 was next and 3 was the worst. Most fans praise 3 and bash 1 and 2.

I do believe that if season 4 style story telling were intorduced in season 2, perhaps the series would have survived. We may never know.

But all in all, this is worth watching as a fan.

Trip proved to be the best character, and the stories in Season 2 really brought him to the fore, which was a good thing.

This is technically not true.  The correct terminology would be mass, but there is no reason you couldn't refer to that mass in Earth gravity terms as weight.  Mass does in fact have an effect in space, as it requires more energy to move more mass around.  So, when the crew wants to shed some weight from their ship to become more maneuverable, it totally makes sense.  Now, my review of Enterprise?  I wanted to join the hate club, but it's a great show.  Most people take issue with the ship having actual screens that say things instead of blinky lights like the series that are suppose to happen in the future, but this show was made in modern times with widely available computers.  If Gene Roddenberry could have had legit computer screens in TOS, TNG, VOY, or DS9 he would have.  But blinky lights and printed stickers were all they had at the time.",1520121600,,1035,4.37696335078534

8061105,5,B0009I7NGW,Love Star Trek.  Love the creative stories and character development.  Very believable stories tying into the original series nicely such as Warp development and the Transporter.  To me better than Next Generation and Voyager which are decent but employ time-travel too much,1498521600,,274,5.476190476190476
