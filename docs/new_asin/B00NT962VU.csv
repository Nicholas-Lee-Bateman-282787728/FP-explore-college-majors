8680082,1,B00NT962VU,Cheap and cheesy. I wouldn't waste my money buying it (if I wasn't dumb enough to have already bought it).  I'm not sure if enough money was spent producing this film to even rank it in the 'low budget' category.,1428019200,,212,4.3
8680083,4,B00NT962VU,"I thought it was, while not ""epic"" quality, a very good movie..attention to detail with Norse language and images was well done. I would recommend it to anyone",1423872000,,159,4.714285714285714
8680084,2,B00NT962VU,"A group of Saxons with bad haircuts are taken prisoner by a group of Norse with worse haircuts. In some kind of ritual 5 are released and hunted by berserker Vikings with KISS make-up so they can cut out their hearts. Wade (Sol Heras) is being hunted, but wants to circle back to save his younger brother.

Apocalypto was done so much better, it made it difficult to watch this film that takes place in 835 AD. That was the year the Vikings invaded the Isle of Sheppey, although it is not known if this was the exact location. The film rightly shows the power of the vlva, a woman who was a seer and priestess. Her demand for human sacrifice, especially the way depicted in the film,is to say the least is controversial.

This goes into the realm of historical fiction that border on fantasy.
