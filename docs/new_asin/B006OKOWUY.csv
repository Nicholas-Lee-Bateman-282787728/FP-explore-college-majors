5009375,3,B006OKOWUY,Thought it would be longer but the shows were good. Would not recommend it to a friend. Needed more for what I paid for.,1376006400,,120,4.041666666666667
5009376,5,B006OKOWUY,"This DVD was great except for ""Ham Radio"" which was not  a good choice.  All of the other selections were hysterical and wisely chosen.

If you are a Frasier fan, I highly recommend this DVD without reservation.",1372464000,,211,4.648648648648648
5009377,5,B006OKOWUY,"This is great when you don't want or have the time to look up a favorite
episode. The laughs are still as fresh as the first time you saw it!",1367366400,2,141,3.7333333333333334
5009378,5,B006OKOWUY,I enjoyed this DVD very much but as an avid viewer of Frasier I was disappointed in the fans selection of the top 8 shows. But it is hard to pick because of so many great episodes. I was just glad to see something new out there that I could buy of the show since I already have all 11 seasons.,1336608000,2,293,3.819672131147541
5009379,5,B006OKOWUY,Really awesome product for Frasier fans! My girlfriend and I added this to our collection and we couldn't be happier!,1334361600,,117,4.9
5009380,4,B006OKOWUY,"This interesting set of Frasier episodes represents a pretty good collection of shows from one of the funniest sit-coms ever produced. While I do not agree with all the selections, there are good enough to entice those who have only seen a few episodes to have some real gems for their collection.

The episodes presented on this economically priced DVD are;

Midwinter Night's Dream (S1): Nile's failed attempt to spice things up with Maris leads to Daphne being trapped in his home during a strong storm when the power fails.

Frasier Craine's Day Off (S1): Frasier, suffering under an intense flu, decides to go back to his show anyway with disasterous results.

Daphne's Room (S2): Frasier looks for his book in Daphne's room and gets more than he bargained for.

Moon Dance (S3): Niles takes Daphne out for dancing to impress his friends.

The Two Mrs. Cranes (S4): Daphne has Niles pretend to be her husband much to his delight.

Ham Radio (S4): Frasier's attempt to pull off a radio play goes horribly wrong.

Ski Lodge (S5): The Fraiser gang hole up at a Ski Lodge while attempting to get into each other's pants.

Three Valentines (S6): Niles, Frasier, Daphne and Martin have their own Valentine adventures.

It's difficult to argue with any of the episodes listed on their own, though ""The Two Mrs. Cranes"" is probably the weakest of the bunch while the ""Three Valentines"" is pretty much forgettable save for Niles' scene, a perfect, nearly wordless bit of comic gold with Eddie looking on as Niles nearly destroys Frasier's apartment. ""Daphne's Room"" however, is one of those subtly great choices that all Frasier fans should see, it's simply hilarious.

What's important to remember is that this list is not considered a ""Best of"" but simply the winning entries in a fan poll. So given that, it does excuse to a certain extent superior episodes that were left out such as ""The Doctor is Out"". However, ""The Matchmaker"" from Season 2 was the first Frasier episode to be considered an instant classic and is hilarious from start to finish, how the fans didn't put this one in is surprising indeed.

Overall, a person who wants to see more of the best Frasier episodes is risking very little by purchasing this collection. I would suggest that if they like what they see, the next step should be purchasing Season 2 of Frasier, which is one of the best overall seasons of any sit-com, ever.",1330905600,26,2399,4.768115942028985

5009417,3,B006OKOWUY,"I can't believe the episode on the ocean liner isn't in here. (""Maris, what a lovely bathroom!"" ""This floating gong show."" ""The comedy stylings of Giggles O'Shea."") Heck, I'm laughing now just remembering it. And what about the episode with the fencing instructor? Some of the best physical comedy I've ever seen. Or the time Frasier and Niles decided to open a restaurant, with awful results. I already have all the seasons, so I won't be getting this collection.",1406592000,2,464,4.886075949367089
