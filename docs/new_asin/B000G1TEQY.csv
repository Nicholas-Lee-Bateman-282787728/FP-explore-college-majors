2598690,5,B000G1TEQY,This is a wonderful video of a person who I admire very much. This video gives a glimpse of the side of an artist that no one usually ever sees. I actually watched this video with Keith as he watched it for the first time. It is a well made documentary and I would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of Keith's.,1154476800,,312,3.890625

8128637,4,B000G1TEQY,"I've admired Carter's photos for many years and this DVD gives you a chance for a ""fireside"" chat in the mind of a terrific photographer.  This is not a technical/ ""How to take photos"" type of DVD.  Just pop it in and take a little art break.",1373846400,,242,4.127659574468085
8128638,4,B000G1TEQY,Nice conversation with KC. Very talented and humble artist. You will gain some insight into his work that otherwise might be lost.,1373241600,,130,4.954545454545454
8128639,2,B000G1TEQY,"Biographies can be an impoverished genre because biographers often lack the imaginative talents of their subjects, so what happens is they shrink their subjects down to a size that's manageable for them. This treatment of the amazing Keith Carter is a bland, boring work. This video bio is so promising and so disappointing. When Carter speaks, the film is eloquent. But it adds up to few insights into this poet photographer's craft or life choices.. We don't get any in depth look at how he came to have such an original voice. We don't hear about the development of his esthetic. Yes there are facts, but no meaning. The whole film is a bunch of random, unconnected moments. Ten minutes are devoted to Carter's trip to a glass house; I'm still wondering why the filmmaker used this footage. Five minutes are devoted to a trip to Mexico that reveals nothing except Carter's choice of camera bag. Another stretch of time is devoted to an Architectural Digest-y homage to his studio. The director seems to be filling time. A few very bland contextualizing voices weigh in, like his editor from the NY Times Magazine who is nervously vapid. A whole stretch goes to Horton Foote, whose relationship to Carter is adoring but modest. But we get a lot of pictures of one of Carter's books in Foote's lap. It's embarrassing! This DVD costs a considerable amount of $, runs for one stingy hour, and the director wastes at least half of it.  The sad thing is that the producer, Anthropy Arts, is planning a series of bios of photographers. Let's hope they bring more depth to bear on the next installments.",1349827200,2,1598,4.707142857142857
8128640,4,B000G1TEQY,"This is a simple, well-made documentary on Keith Carter, one of the greatest living photographers, in my opinion. It guides you through his working process, thoughts on art and life, as well as providing glimpses of his home, studio, darkroom, travels, family, etc. As a documentary, it's not really a work of art in itself, but more like hanging out with a really cool photographer, and learning all these great things along the way. I was very pleased with the extra material on the DVD - a video on his toning process, and a video of his various wonderful books, with him commenting on each of them. Altogether, a well put-together DVD, and one that I will watch again!",1282003200,,672,4.65546218487395
8128641,4,B000G1TEQY,"In this DVD, Keith Carter is expaining in detail about his views on photography, demonstrating how he works and also giving some personal hints to beginner and intermediate photographers. It is also possible to see and feel the atmosphere he has created for himself to concentrate on photography. Although the DVD has no subtitles he has a very clean accent and it's quite easy to follow the scripts. It's great to see what type of working environment he has created for himself. It gave me inspiration and some vision for the future of my photographic career. The documentary has a relatively slow and pieceful pace and Keith Carter is talking quite a lot but it's never boring. He has a very good and sufficient way of explaining his thoughts. I managed to capture a few thoughts which I always felt inside but never been able to put into words. It's almost one hour but can be watched very easily without getting bored.

I am a keen follower of these type of DVDs and I can say that this is one of the succesful ones. It's good for all people who are interested in photography but I believe that people who are relatively a bit more experienced will take better benefit of it.",1235520000,,1179,4.561320754716981
8128642,5,B000G1TEQY,"I agree with the other reviewers that this video gives you a glimpse inside the head of a great photographer.

  As well as the main program it also has a run through of Carter's books with his own narration guiding you through. There's also a section on toning with Keith where you get into his darkroom and watch him at work. If you are interested in tea toning this alone will make it worth buying.

Good video, and a good value - about 2 hours in total.",1191801600,,457,4.218390804597701
8128643,4,B000G1TEQY,There is no combat during this video. It is educating and inspiring. He's a good guy.,1190160000,,85,4.375
8128644,4,B000G1TEQY,"As a long time lover of Carter's amazing photography, I was very pleased to see this DVD and bought it immediately. I was not disappointed.

Keith Carter comes across as a real human being, and not some holier than thou ""artiste"" who photographs dirt and then creates some long winded explanation of how the dirt is an expression of some inner torment blahblahblah. But this is to be expected, as Carter is a real artist, in the sense that he ventures out into the world, truly communicates with other human beings and creates art that communicates with other human beings. His work stands in direct contrast to the ""ennui"" photography currently in vogue with collectors.

And if there is one word you could use to describe Carter's photography, it is human, sometimes revealing, oftentimes mysterious, but always tapped into and informed by the human experience. I remember the sense of beauty and awe I felt viewing his work back in college. The amazing thing is, he just keeps getting better!

God Bless You, Keith. I love your work more than you could know.

Parker
