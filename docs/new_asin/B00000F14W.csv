1200099,1,B00000F14W,"The Hanoi Hilton, Lionel Chetwynd's well-intentioned effort to tell the story of the American POWs, may be one of the best examples of what can happen when good directorial intentions go bad.  The true story is a riveting and inspirational one, but Chetwynd's stiff editorial decisions  and inane dialogue results in a movie that will make anyone who knows the  POW story cringe.  He researched the subject thoroughly and consulted with  ex-POWs to ensure accuracy in the details (such as the layout of the prison  and the garb), but the script falls so short it is embarrassing.  Too bad  this 1987 feature film used up the name ""the Hanoi Hilton,""  because the best work on the infamous POW camp of North Vietnam is actually  told in a 1998 documentary Return With Honor (produced by Academy Award  winners Sanders and Mock for the American Film Foundation.  Tom Hanks has  put his name behind it.).  The documentary weaves extraordinary historical  footage with the comments of the real POWs - and the men are infinitely  more authentic and fascinating to listen to  than the stereotypical  portrayals in The Hanoi Hilton.  Anyone interested in an intelligent and  articulate presentation of this subject should avoid Chetwynd's movie and  see Return With Honor instead.",956016000,15,1273,5.024038461538462
1200100,5,B00000F14W,"The Hanoi Hilton angered a lot of reviewers upon its 1987 release.  The New Republic launched its exceptionally vicious review of the film by calling it ""filth.""  Other reviewers howled in protest by calling  the film ""one-sided,"" ""virulent,"" and so forth.
Such  reviews only confirm James Bowman's point about the idiotic film Kids,  namely that the movie reviewing community consists of the most gullible  people in the world, people who would never think to challenge the  assumptions they want to see confirmed in the movies they review.
It  confirms this point because what the denunciations of The Hanoi Hilton  really reflect is the film's commitment to truth.
The film is about Hoa  Lo prison, one of the most brutal POW prisons in history.  North Vietnam  not only tortured and killed prisoners, it used them as propaganda tools,  and enlisted the aid of Westerners to spread disinformation about Hanoi and  its war aims.
The film captures such disinformation actions in two  crucial scenes; early on, an Australian TV journalist (based on the real  life journalist Wilfred Burchette, who aided Communist forces all over the  world and participated in the torture of American pilots in both Korea and  Vietnam) openly in league with the Communists does a piece on a prisoner  who steadfastly refuses to go along with the colossal fraud being permeated  about Communist benevolence.  The Aussie gripes at the prison commandant  (Aki Akeong) about the POW's uncooperative attitude.
Later, an American  film actress and her husband (based on Jane Fonda and Tom Hayden) greet the  POWs and ask them to sign an apology ""to the women and children you  bombed.""  Of course they did no such thing, and tell her off on  it.
Nonetheless she wins the release of a few prisoners, much to the  contempt of almost all of them.  This is one of the film's major themes;  one goes, we all go, as is repeatedly told by the POWs to the prison  commandant.
Eventually the POWs are released upon the signing of the  Paris Peace Accords, and celebrate having outlasted the enemy as they take  off for freedom.
The film's superb cast, tremendous attention to detail  (the sets were built through extensive consultatition with men who were  imprisoned in Hoa Lo), and Lionel Chetwynd's flawless direction make for a  chilling story.",930009600,54,2317,4.95822454308094

1200154,5,B00000F14W,"TERRIFYING and GLORIOUS! Possibly the most important film about Vietnam War ever made. I was deeply impressed, shocked and moved by the description of the ordeal of US prisoners held, tortured and murdered in the Hoa Lo prison, nicknamed by American POWs ""Hanoi Hilton"". Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

1. The Hoa Lo prison

Hoa Lo is situated in Hanoi. The prison was built by the French - it was initially known as ""Maison Centrale"". After the communists took over the North Vietnam, they used it to hold and torture political prisoners. When first US aviators were caught in 1964, the Hoa Lo was emptied and reserved for American POWs. It was not the only place in which Americans were held, but it was by far the worst. Torture, beating, deliberate starvation, humiliation, psychological manipulation, etc. were routine  some American prisoners who were particularly courageous in resisting pressure were murdered The conditions were so harsh and the treatment so barbaric, that inmates called this hellhole many sarcastic names: ""Riviera"", ""Golden Nugget"", ""Little Vegas"", etc. but the one which really stuck was ""Hanoi Hilton"".

2. The film

The film follows very closely the real events. Some of the characters are very directly inspired by real POWs, but all the names were changed. For a considerable part of the film the main character is Lieutenant-Commander Williamson (Michael Moriarty). Among other important characters are Colonel Cathcart (Lawrence Pressman), the senior POW in the prison, who for that reason is the target of particularly cruel abuse and Major Oldham (David Soul), an extremely tough USMC officer. There are of course many others. Not everybody will be there when the credits roll

This is a precious semi-document about people who were fighting for a noble cause but then were captured by an inhumane totalitarian tyranny, and held without any protection for years and years, at the mercy of every whim of their captors. This film shows how they fought back in every possible way and how sometimes they achieved little victories, which helped some of them survive until their release.

This film shows that torture of POWs was an international effort, as Chinese Russians and Cubans helped with their ""expertise"" in order to obtain valuable military information. It shows at one moment a Western ""journalist"" working directly and zealously for the North Vietnamese torturers  this repugnant character is almost certainly inspired by Australian KGB agent and loyal Vietcong propagandist Wilfred G. Burchett.

Possibly the best part of the film is when the ""Hanoi Hilton"" is visited by the worst kind of filth that can possibly exist  traitors. Those three Americans supporting the communists are identified only as ""Paula"", ""Jesse"" and ""Raymond"", but it is clear that the first two are in fact Jane Fonda and Tom Hayden. In the real life the POWs told visiting American leftists that they were being tortured, but Fonda lied about it, certifying on a conference press that there was no torture in ""Hanoi Hilton"". This part was left out in the film - and it is a pity. Later in the same trip Jane Fonda sat on an anti-aircraft gun to pose for a picture and encourage the communist gunners to down more American planes. It is hard to express the contempt the POWs felt for those people; small wonder that Fonda is still known as ""Hanoi Jane"" The part about the gun also was not shown in the film - and again, it is a pity...

The ending is excellent and very moving - but I will not say anything more about it, to avoid spoilers.

I could go on much longer, but you really deserve to discover this little known jewel by yourself. This is a very powerful, important and precious film, to buy and see absolutely. I will definitely keep my DVD for future viewing.",1458691200,6,3820,4.923794712286159

It seemed that while we had known of the torture, it was an inconvenient truth for the media and those in harmony with the ""benevolent"" People's Republic of (North) Vietnam--and the full story filly came out when the POW's came home. And it was an 'all as one' mindset; when they found out John McCain's dad was a major USN admiral, they offered to let him go and he refused, and he almost died. They mentioned that 750 came home, but 2,740+ still remain unaccounted for-Hanoi knows they're just not talking. And this was not the only stunt 'Hanoi' Jane Fonda pulled-she was also filmed on an antiaircraft gun. For those that don't know why the NVA seemed so frightened of the Black soldier, its because their propaganda was that all Blacks were cannibals. Maybe the movie was not a box office hit, but it mattered to all who served, and family, friends and many Veterans.

1200267,5,B00000F14W,"I happen to know 1 POW and have read numerous books published about this period in history. The portrayal given here is accurate.

If you're looking for some Hollywood extravaganza, you won't find it. Outside of Michael Moriarity, most of the other actors are ""B"" list at best.

Having said that, let's separate the ""art"" aspect of film from the fact that this is a good story-and a story that needs to be told.

I'd like to point out several things:

1st, several of the men who served in the ""Hanoi Hilton"" served as advisors.

2nd, the conditions portrayed are actually BETTER in the movie than they were in real life. 1 simple example-many of the men suffered from extreme gastrointestinal distress and had worms in their excrement. Some of the men were actually EXPELLING parasites on a fairly regular basis. In this case, don't think that the amount of disease, coupled with the cramped quarters, and the men's poor diet did not lead to WORSE incidents of illness than were shown.

3rd, the amount of raw courage portrayed was TONED DOWN. I'll give 1 brief example: Admiral Jim Stockdale actually BEAT HIMSELF UNCONSCIOUS rather than submit to be used as a tool for the NVA's propaganda. He was later awarded the Medal of Honor.

Anyone who could pan this film is simply not aware (or does not want to acknowledge) of the pressure,extortion, and torture our men were men exposed to for as many as 9 years (the 1st prisoner caught was Lt Everett Alvarez).

The truth is that many of the awful things that happened to these men can be used in our everyday lives. Some examples would include the role of faith (religious, faith in our country, and faith in the people around us), the role of principles in our daily lives, and the triumph of the human spirit.",1281139200,3,1762,4.625

At the same time, it made me think of our own Guantanamo Bay prison, and made me wonder what kinds of torture we may have used to extract information from our POW's.  We see the Vietnamese as being vicious in their treatment of our people, but of course, their people were being killed by our armed forces.  They would want to retaliate.  It seemed to me that the men looked awfully healthy and well fed when the time came for their liberation, and I wonder how that compares with the reality.

Perhaps the powers that be don't want Americans to see a powerful representation of the experiences of one of the candidates.

When you think of all of the mindlessly fawning portrayals of the monsters of the left (Che Guevara comes to mind in the Motorcycle Diaries, or John Reed, in Reds), is it too much to ask that a movie that shows the other side of them (the side that butchered 100 million people over the course of the last century) be made available?",1174348800,7,623,4.464912280701754
1200296,4,B00000F14W,"I intially saw this at the movies when first released.  AT THAT TIME I felt this was a very graphic and powerful movie.  One reason I had enjoyed it so much was because of Senator John McCain, tho' not mentioned by name in the movie (he is listed in the credits as being a ""guest for 5-1/2 years.""  It's powerful to me how these regular guys perform these courageous patriotic acts without a second thought.  It proves people become heroes from their circumstances and abilities to hold true to beliefs of our democratic principles.  This is a must see just for the history of the era.  To see Jane Fonda doing what she felt was right to our veterans upholding and protecting our values as a free Nation.",1133136000,12,704,4.4609375

1200298,5,B00000F14W,"The Hanoi Hilton is a chilling video that gives an inside look into what it was like to be a PoW. They didn't allow you to talk, the silence speaks of the many tortures they went through. The lack of dialogue makes you look between the lines and hear what isn't said. There are no right sides in war, the movie wasn't about how horrible the North Vietnamese were, it is about the conditions of war in general and that place in particular. In case no one noticed, the torture became worse after the Cubans became involved.
War is ugly, and the people who end up running things do ugly things on both sides. This is a haunting film that tells us just one part of what the Vietnam War was like. If you think its an attack on anyone, or not enough dialogue, you are missing the point. The point was very well made in this film...try listening harder to the silence between the lines.",1100304000,10,879,4.301204819277109
1200299,4,B00000F14W,"One lonely conservative voice has been trying to shout out from the ""wilderness"" for years. Lionel Chetwynd is a writer/producer who made ""The Hanoi Hilton"", which actually described the North Vietnamese as the evil torturers they were. The ""Hilton"" was the moniker given the infamous prison camp where American POW's were kept while Jane Fonda was flirting with our enemies. Liberal film reviewers criticized it. Do not believe them. It is good stuff.

7906264,4,B00000F14W,"This DVD shows just a few of the mental and physical atrocities waged by the North Vietnamese Government upon the mostly American Pilot occupants of the infamous prison.  It also clearly depicts the honor, patriotism, and valor displayed by most of its occupants during the Vietnam War, where, according to the Geneva Convention, which laid down limits for the international community as to what information prisoners are required to give.  This three items are Name, Rank, and Serial Number.  According to the Convention, no other information must be protracted by any means.  Clearly (and very clearly in the case of Vietnamese prisons throughout Vietnam, including the Hanoi Hilton,) the rules were not followed.  A very touching flick.  Also there were many other tortures employed for POWs in many wars, and many crimes against God and man practiced by our enemies.  This is a good film for U.S. veterans to watch.",1505865600,,919,5.086666666666667
7906265,5,B00000F14W,"Many movies caught the essence of the brutality of war. Very few caught the brutality of men captured in war. Hanoi Hilton is one such movie.

As a young American teen during Vietnam I was all too familiar with what was happening in Southeast Asia. As the son of a career military man it hit home.  Ultimately as a career military person myself I have thought of these Airmen, Sailors, Soldiers, and Marines many times over my life - especially after going through Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape (SERE) School prior to entering flight status.  It was their exploits and stories I read prior to SERE that helped me through it.  I can hardly imagine my one week compared to their years of captivity.  Thank you, gentlemen.  Thank you from the bottom of my heart.

Hanoi Hilton is the story of perseverance and dedication. It is there story of belief in ones country and a greater cause. The Navy's motto, Non Sibi Sed Patriae, Not for Self but County, is totally apropos.",1499472000,3,979,4.656976744186046

7906267,5,B00000F14W,"Movie depicts the horror that the fascist U.S military junta brought to the Vietnamese People. The Vietnamese People are absolved of this supposedly horror that American soldiers endured, but the sad truth it was their own country who did this because the U.S deceived and brainwashed the youth that they were fighting a demonic enemy when in fact the demon was the U.S. The American youth did not know why they were fighting except the lies that they were protecting democracy. It was a lie told by the fascist and capitalist beast when in reality America does not support democracies abroad nor is humane to the other people, and for this reason the U.S lost this war. Why do not American children and youth learn as well the horrors and human right violations that the U.S military committed against the Vietnamese, Laotian, Cambodian, the African, and Latin American people in the time that these people were fighting a just war. By the way, I am a Vietnam Vet who fought as an American, but at the end of the war I realized that I was deceived and that America was just a lie. For this reason, we lost this war, and I repent of ever participating in this horrid war perpetrated by my country, and forgive me God for the deception that I let the American fascist beast hidden under a beautiful angel that says it is democracy and the light of the world, and thanks be to God that the innocent lambs of Vietnam won this war against the beast.",1498262400,,1445,4.540229885057471
