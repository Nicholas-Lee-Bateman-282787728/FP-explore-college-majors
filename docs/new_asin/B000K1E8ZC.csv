8460525,5,B000K1E8ZC,"It doesn't matter if your a dedicated trophy hunter, or just a country boy who takes dad's rifle out to get closer to God and nature. This DVD is action packed and just flat out as real as the feeling of taking your first deer. My brother in law is on the Pro Staff, and also owns the company. I've had the pleasure of sharing the field with him and some of his Pro Staff as he put me on my first deer. If you like to hunt, you will want this DVD, and you'll watch it again and again.",1178496000,,484,3.85
