5968105,5,B00F61B2AA,"My kids love Octonauts and this video makes it possible for them to watch their favorites at home or on the go while in the car.  I was a little worried that my kids (ages 3, 5, and 7) would be bored while watching this DVD since they had already seen most of the episodes but I was wrong.  They actually love the DVD even more because it does have their favorites.  Its nice to have a go to video that all my kids enjoy.",1393891200,,421,3.929411764705882
5968106,5,B00F61B2AA,"My 3 year old son loves anything to do with sea creatures (particularly whales, sharks, and octopuses), so I was eager to introduce him to this Octonauts dvd.  His reaction even surpassed my expectations.  He simply can't get enough of it!  He would watch it more than once a day if I'd let him.  The Octonauts is an entertaining adventure show with fun, adorable characters, but it is also very educational. The episodes are short little vignettes you can watch alone, or all together as more of a full length feature.  I would recommend this dvd for any preschool-aged child who is interested in learning about animals, particularly animals who live under the sea.",1393804800,,666,4.807017543859649

My Review:

 My little boy is 3 almost 4 and just adores the under the sea action of this animated feature. The DVD version is 70 minutes long, it has 6 action packed adventures plus bonus material. The Octonauts are a great show for your children to learn from not only is it packed with action and adventure but the plot lines are sure to keep your children interested. Teaching them something new every time they watch.  My son loved it so much and to add to the excitement, I made him a plate of fish sticks&fries. So he got to watch a favorite television series and enjoy a seafood meal.

 Be ready to learn a thing or two right along with your child as you both watch the newest Octonauts adventure, To the Gup-X! Action packed adventure while you learn more about ocean life and helping others. Enter for your chance to win! Good Luck!

**Disclosure** This DVD was sent to me free of charge for my honest review from N Circle Entertainment.",1393804800,,1683,4.583333333333333
5968108,5,B00F61B2AA,"My children (ages 7, 5, and 3) are captivated by Octonauts. They loved this DVD and it is incredible how much they learned while watching it! We love how they show a picture of the real animal at the end. It helps to connect the cartoon to the real world. My 7 year old is obsessed with sea life at the moment and this show has helped him learn about his favorites -- the whale shark and great white sharks. I would highly recommend this DVD!",1393459200,,442,4.151162790697675
5968109,5,B00F61B2AA,"Any child interested in the Ocean is sure to love the Ocotonauts! My daughter age 5 and my son age 3 recently have been introduced to this show and are quite taken with it! The latest not to miss out on DVD releasing soon by nCircle that my family got to pre-screen is called Octonauts: To the Gup-X. On this feature, there's non-stop adventure in which kids discover the lovable characters exploring, rescuing, and protecting all sorts of animals of the sea! We've not just been watching but using it during our homeschool time too.

This DVD is 70 minutes long, you can easily sit and watch all the episodes or break it up and watch one at a time (especially if you want to use these along in a science lesson). There are a total of six episodes and two bonus features. Some of the sea creatures children will learn educational facts about are Great White Sharks, Coconut Crabs, Bowhead Whales, Whale Sharks, Flying Fish, and more! The facts are mentioned in each episode as the story goes along but also will be brought up during the end in the ""Creature Report"". I'll have to admit that even I learned a new thing or two. Way to go for summarizing the facts!

My kids have watched the DVD numerous time and have yet to tire of it. My daughter liked seeing the Narwhals and my son thought the coconut crabs were pretty cool. I'd like to mention that even though there's sharks which can be frightening and other potentially suspenseful situations, the show presents these situations well without scaring kids.

Overall we wouldn't hesitate to recommend the series! Randomly throughout the day my kids will come up to me and let me know about some neat fact they learned while watching! It's not just great entertainment but has actual educational benefits to it as well. Who knows, maybe this will encourage a child to be a marine biologist or another career pertaining to the sea!",1393372800,,1884,4.601190476190476

5968128,3,B00F61B2AA,"My 3 yr old twins love the Octonauts.  Amazon pitched this as a new DVD, but actually it is a combination of older episodes, and not even the best ones, in our opinion.  Plus the animation is not HD or something, because it's pretty terrible.  Anyway, still the same funny great show, but by no means new, nor the best.  I wouldn't have ordered it if I had known.  We've DVR'd all the episodes, but this dvd is handy for traveling.",1398643200,,431,4.271604938271605

5968130,5,B00F61B2AA,"To the Gup-X!  Brings another 6 adventures of the Octonauts right to your own TV. These episodes feature the same endearing characters from the PBS series. My grandchildren found the DVD on the counter and insisted on watching an episode before lunch! These undersea adventures are perfect for children. Led by Captain Barnacles, this team of sea faring explorers roam the oceans looking for sea creatures to rescue or protect. There is no violence  but some tense moments as a monster (really an octopus) plays gotcha with the Pirate Cat Quazi. Meanwhile children are learning to care and help  as they watch Peso, a medically trained penguin, bandage flippers at super speed. When Dashe, a young lady with a camera, wanders into a Whale shark the entire team heads out to rescue her. Complications arise when others, including the salty old Captain are swept inside the large Whale shark. It was a delight to travel with these explorers as they discover and explain undersea mysteries. And we all look forward to the creature report, a lively dance sequence which brings up a picture of the real creature weve been learning about. For adventure and education  wrapped up in entertainment  you just cant do better than To the Gup-X!",1397433600,,1233,4.908653846153846
5968131,5,B00F61B2AA,"My daughters, ages 3 and 4, had never seen Octonauts before we tried out this DVD.  After watching it once, it was a hit, and they request it frequently.  Not only is it entertaining, but I have heard them reciting facts about sea animals that they have learned from this DVD while they play.  I also find it to be one of the less-annoying kids shows, and I don't mind watching with them, or listening to in in the background.  Good, entertaining, and educational.",1396828800,,464,4.488095238095238
5968132,5,B00F61B2AA,"As a NSider I receive a DVD every moth to review and this month we got The Octonaunt: To The Gup-X! This is the second Octonaunt DVD we own, my son is still really young and I originally thought it would be geared more towards older kids. But I was pleasantly surprised to find out The Octonauts are good for all kids. My son loves the cute Oconaunt crew and how they help others. He may not get the educational parts just yet but they are done in a way that he still enjoys it. Every episode has a Creature Report rap up at the end of the episode. Basically it is actual pictures and some interesting facts about the creature we just met during the episode. The report is done to a catchy little song, so that younger kids can enjoy it. The older kids will find the photos and facts interesting.  As a parent I really love that the Octonauts are not just fun but educational as well. Every episode they meet a new creature and help them out in one way or another. It teaches my son to be kind and helpful to everyone and I really like that. As he gets older I think he will start taking a bit more out of the creature report as well.

The Octonauts: To The Gup-X has 6 great episodes about the Great White Sharks, Coconut Crabs, Bowhead Whales, Whale Sharks, Octopuses and Flying Fish.  The DVD runs about 70 minutes, so it gives a parent a little break or a chance to get things done.  There is also a bonus section where you can watch all 6 Creature Reports as well as a Close Up Of The Gup-X. The Gup-X is the newest of their vehicles (there are 5 others) that they use to help the creatures they meet.

I want my son to watch things he enjoys but I also want him to be able to take some sort of  educational value too. The Octonauts are just that. We will defiantly be adding more Octonauts to our DVD collection.",1396569600,,1818,4.150568181818182

5968140,5,B00F61B2AA,"I love when a kids show does double duty.  Thats what you get with Octonauts.  They are an odd bunch of underwater adventurers that explore the deep depths of the ocean and help those that are in need of their assistance.  I can say even as an adult I have learned a few things from this show.  Each show takes us on a new adventure of some sort.  Were introduced to new under water creatures or helping another one out of a jam.  Octonauts: To The Gup X takes up on six adventures with the whole gang. My favorite episode on the disk was the one about flying fish.  I remember them as a girl growing up in the Caribbean and it was great learning more about them and sharing them with my kids.  This disk also jumped into sharks, whales and crabs.  This is a great dvd to pick up for your Octonauts fan or any fans of sea creatures.

I received this dvd for review through the NSider Review Program from NCircle Entertainment.",1395187200,,926,4.24
5968141,5,B00F61B2AA,"I received this DVD as part of NCircle's NSider program. My four year old is picky about the shows that he will watch. However, when we received this DVD, he was in love! We do not have cable, or even local channels, so we rely on DVDs or Netflix for television. My son had never seen Octonauts, but after watching this he loves it! Kwazii is easily his favorite character, because it's a cat. He enjoyed the flying fish episode the most. My 9 year old daughter, who loves all animals, also enjoyed watching the show. I enjoy the show because it teaches about real sea animals. Thank you for another great DVD, NCircle!",1395100800,,619,4.43859649122807

I can't say enough good things about this show. First off, my 7-year-old wasn't all too excited to watch it with his brothers as we sat down to view the DVD for the first time. He was under the impression that the show was geared toward an audience of younger kids. Needless to say, he changed his tune about halfway through the first episode. He ended up being the one that kept asking ""please just one more"" after every episode! He liked the funny characters, appreciated the educational aspects of the show and was completely intrigued by all of the episodes. His brothers, ages 2 and 6, enjoyed the DVD immensely as well. They all requested this DVD several times within the first week that we had it. The Creature Reports are very informative and that is a huge bonus in my opinion! I'm really impressed that this show is appealing to an audience of kids with such a vast age range. This DVD would be a great addition to any family's video collection!",1394409600,,1110,4.5

The animals in the submarine are these pseudo-animal creatures that I really cant identify but my kids love them.. The adventures usually involve some animal thats in trouble. Not the WonderPets kind of trouble, but a serious threat like a shark who has been injured and needs to be given first aid (but the Octonauts have to avoid being eaten). My kids like to learn the facts that are in the Creature Report at the end of each episode. There were some episodes on the DVD that my kids hadnt seen, so that was good. I especially liked the diversity of the dialects in this collection of Octonauts shows. The episodes are quite short at around 10 minutes each and there are 8 on this DVD.  It's perfect for keeping in the van for those short errand runs.  I received this DVD to review. The opinions shared here are 100% mine.",1394236800,,948,4.505813953488372

I like the Octonauts because it has the perfect level of intensity for my children who are easily affected. We still can't watch Disney movies because of the villains or scary parts. The episodes of Octonauts here capture a good balance between intensity and learning. My two-year-old will get scared at the parts where there are lurking sea creatures, and the accompanied foreboding soundtrack; however, as a parent, I enjoy that he isn't glazed over and he is acclimating to watching scenes that are ""intense."" My four-year-old especially loves the Octonauts, and she loved all the episodes on this DVD. Perhaps she is the better age to really enjoy these.
