8328857,4,B001O1ZU9U,"I took off one star from this DVD, simply because the format is a bit strange.  The episodes are very short and they auto-play, which is fine.  However, the Miffy theme song cuts off on some of these, and that perturbs the kid, since she is a huge fan of singing along.

Still, like all Miffy and Friends episodes, these are animated well, have a nice, soothing narrator, and cute stories.",1389830400,,389,4.450704225352113

Only disadvantage is that theme song does not play at start of each episode, and we loved the song.",1276560000,,250,4.391304347826087
