Imagine spending an hour with a top explosives expert while he teaches you
everything you ever wanted to know. That's what awaits you in this video.
Not only is it a blast to watch, you'll come away with more practical
knowledge than most licensed explosive experts!

Can C-4 cut steel? What happens if you double the size of a high explosive
charge? Triple it? How does Napalm differ from gasoline? All of these
questions are answered during explosive comparisons of C-4, dynamite, TNT,
det cord, nitro-based propellant, RDX and more. You will see how to safely
handle, store and set up a complete range of explosives, and learn the
proper use of fuses, blasting caps and other detonating devices.

This videotape was shot on location using sophisticated equipment and high-
speed shutters in order to capture the explosions in complete detail.
