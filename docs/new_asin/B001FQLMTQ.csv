3588271,1,B001FQLMTQ,"I'll keep this short, as  don't want this video to take up any more of my time that it already has. This video is just terrible. SPOILER ALERT... if you heard that series of phone calls a few years ago between the two teens who were high on meth in a snowstorm, then called 911 and reported that they were surrounded by minorities who wouldn't answer them (along with other hallucinations), then froze to death unable to find shelter, then you have already heard this ENTIRE plot. I kid you not, this movie is nothing but a ripoff and dramatization of those phone calls. Obviously, if you have heard the calls, then, you know that the two kids are seeing things that aren t there, and can't hurt them. Just hallucinations. How anyone could rate this above a 1 or 2 is beyond me. I respect other's opinions most of the time, but not THIS time. Skip this video and save your money, otherwise you are either going to be disappointed or furious that the filmmakers simply stole that lame storyline from those phone calls (you can hear those calls, by the way, on YouTube - the actual calls are 100x more frightening than this awful excuse for a movie). How this got financed and filmed and found a distributor, I will never know. The investors must be wishing that the film producers were themselves frozen to death from hypothermia. The filmmakers (and I use that term very, very lightly here) owe me 45 minutes of my time (all I could bear watching of this disaster of a movie) and the $2.99 I wasted renting this unoriginal hunk of garbage.",1269302400,12,1539,4.496428571428571
3588272,3,B001FQLMTQ,"Dead of Winter (aka Lost Call) has all the makings of a good, intense movie - but it never truly delivers.  Throwing a big surprise in at the last moment doesn't help.  You can't make up for a weak story by delivering a surprise questionable ending - when is Hollywood going to figure that out?  I know this film is supposedly based on a true story, but I've read about that true story; Dead of Winter may be built upon the same structure of that event, but this is really just an attempt to exploit a tragedy in a failed effort to add a little extra tension to a film that struggles to stand on its own two legs. I don't want to speak too harshly of the film, though, because I have to admit it did a good job of keeping me entertained.

If these two young people had only had their drinks unknowingly laced with LSD, I would really have cared what happened to them after they found themselves lost in the cold, snowy woods.  The fact that they also both willingly snorted crystal meth at their friend's New Year's party, though, kept me from establishing a true bond with them and their plight.  I didn't want anything bad to happen to the cute girl, Tiffany (Sandra McCoy), but I have to admit I didn't like Kevin (Al Santos) at all.  When you think some awful something is attacking you, you don't just run off and leave your girl behind - unless you're Kevin, who did it repeatedly.

So Kevin and Tiffany leave this party in something of a huff and head home on the snowy roads.  Hearing and seeing frightening things, they abandon the car and run off into the woods in a panic.  Afraid to head back to the car, they decide to trek the rest of the way home through the woods.  Naturally, they get lost.  They do call 911, but the signal never lasts very long, and the dispatcher has a hard time figuring out where they are because of the crazy things they say - they're lost at their apartment, there are a bunch of ""workers"" there who don't speak English, etc.  Things go from bad to worst out in the woods as Kevin's behavior becomes stranger and stranger.

In light of the ending, I feel that some of the overall story elements are rather flimsily connected to one another, and a number of obvious yet unanswered questions arise as to the whole situation this couple found themselves in.  The film does muster up a couple of creepy moments, one of which features a beautifully subtle and perfectly executed shot that you may not notice if you aren't paying attention at the time, but the story just isn't strong enough to carry this film all the way through.  The end result is an average horror/thriller that will entertain you but probably won't exceed your expectations.",1256515200,,2681,4.41869918699187
3588273,5,B001FQLMTQ,This is a great movie. It kept my interest through the entire movie. The acting is very good. I like movies that are based on true events.,1239753600,5,138,4.148148148148148
3588274,3,B001FQLMTQ,"You might think that you've already seen every possible permutation of the mad slasher stalking the young couple in the woods. However this film, ""based on real events,"" does put a new twist on the theme.

The couple's floundering in the woods gets a little repetitious, and you might think you are guessing the secret of their dilemma. But you probably won't know the whole truth of the matter until the very last frame.

So this film is marginally worth sticking with. But there's another, better film out there with the same title, ""Dead of Winter."" (Producers seem to be recycling titles with increasing rapidity.) This somewhat older film, starring Mary Steenburgen and Roddy McDowall, is much slicker, more clever - and more frightening. So if you just have time for one chilling snow job - make it the Steenburgen/McDowall film.",1235865600,15,835,4.914893617021277

These no talent idiots who give it less then three stars, what have they done as far as movies are concern themselves. Hate over zealous critics, who have no resume to show the rest of the world and have nothing better to do then put others down. Jealous morons. This movie was enternaining to me.  Shows what can happen to you on dangerous drugs, so it does send a message, so there you less then three stars jerks. I want the soundtrack.",1231632000,5,558,4.616161616161616

The plot and story is beyond silly/non-believable and the acting...if you want to call it that, is no doubt the worst you could ever imagine!  I can't even believe someone was stupid enough to waste resources on such a piece of crap movie.  On a scale of 1 to 10, I'd give this stoop-fest a minus 1000!

3588277,3,B001FQLMTQ,"If you read the liner notes to this film, there are quotes that compare this film to ""The Shining."" We won't go THAT far here, although there are moments where the scenery and mood do succeed in creating tension and uncertainty. McNamara obviously draws from Mr. King in that respect, although this movie would compare with more standard King films such as ""Riding the Bullet."" It is better than most of the Masters of Horror series, though, and if it were not for the banal dialogue and absurd one-liners throughout, the acting by the two lead characters would have put this over the top. But the problem is that while it IS atmospheric and it IS chilling at times, everyone watching it knows what is going on, and the ""twist"" at the end really is not all that shocking. There is very little blood/gore, very few moments where you will jump or be startled, and the suspensful moments are just too few and far between to make this movie anything more than average.

McNamara deserves points for trying, however, and he does connect on certain thematic elements. In addition, the two young leads in the film deliver performances that should not be overlooked. It is not a total loss, but I would only suggest it as a rental.",1229040000,8,1223,4.610091743119266

3588282,4,B001FQLMTQ,"Dead of Winter captured my interest in the casting of the two main characters. Both actor and actress were not easily read as villain or victim. You need to watch the entire movie to figure out who dun it. The spin with the spiked drinks keeps you wondering if the events are real or if they are memorex. The cell phone calls mix in an element of the supernatural, which is not easily determined as to where the natural, hallucination or supernatural cross each other.

The male and female, both died - froze to death in real life. This incident happened in the dead of winter, to two drug induced young adults on New Years. The movie was dramatized some, as most movies are, to give it more appeal, but for the most part, this did happen -

[**spoiler ahead**]

The girl in the movie was 'slipped' a drug, when in real life, she knew what she was doing - she took the drug on purpose - they both did. This was found out during the investigation. Also, in the movie, the female police officer died/was murdered, but in real life, there wasn't any police fatality. The only deaths were the male and female. In one of the actual police 911 recordings, police could actually hear the male ask for help when he called, thinking he was talking to workers on a farm, but who he was speaking to, were cows.  The police could hear this due to the mooing. Many facts were right, but some dramatized. They were found to be on hallucinogenic drugs and froze to death from being confused and lost in the woods.",1374105600,,1146,4.316279069767442
3588294,2,B001FQLMTQ,"<strong>Dead of Winter</strong> (Brian McNamara, 2007)

Somehow it didn't occur to me that this movie (also released as <em>Lost Signal</em>), which popped up on some channel or other as <em>Brian McNamara's Dead of Winter</em>, was directed by THAT Brian McNamara, a TV character actor (currently appearing on <em>Army Wives</em>) who's had a guest spot at some point or another on probably half the shows you watch on TV. To date, this rather silly psychological horror flick is McNamara's only feature-length directorial effort. There's a reason for that.

Plot: after leaving a New Year's Eve party where their drinks were spiked with LSD by the sadistic host, Kevin (<em>American Gangster</em>'s Al Santos) and Tiffany (<em>Cry_Wolf</em>'s Sandra McCoy) have an accident on their way home, panic, and run off into the woods, their only lifeline being a spotty cell phone they use every once in a while to check in with the local sheriff (played by McNamara) and his dispatcher (<em>Bubba Ho-Tep</em>'s Ella Joyce). Kevin eventually becomes convinced that they are being stalked, and the two of them flee deeper into the woods even as the sheriff does his best to get a manhunt going in the sub-zero weather.

I wanted to like this movie. I've been a big Ella Joyce fan ever since the <em>Roc</em> days (and that's two decades ago now), and there are a number of places where there's a hook out there, dangling, waiting for McNamara and/or screenwriters Robert Egan and Graham Silver, two producers working on their first script, to pick it up and run with it. They never do, preferring a script that stands solely in service to the plot--which is thin. As such, you end up with a dead generic pseudo-psychological thriller often (and never favorably) compared to <em>The Shining</em>. **",1329264000,,1792,5.047297297297297
3588295,2,B001FQLMTQ,"Wow, this movie is unapologetically bad. The instant and mind shattering effects of crystal meth star in the leading role (incidentally a young couple also flees from a madman while braving the elements).

The story kept me intrigued, though I'd advise any viewer to have the mute button ready and turn off the volume when the girlfriend's auditory hallucination scenes start (think Sideshow Bob stepping on rakes, only instead of funny, annoying, and longer).

The police officer and 911 dispatcher roles are convincingly played and I actually connected with them by the end of the movie. The young couple strained credulity at times, but I suppose the drug card was used as a get out of (scriptwriting) jail free card.

Overall it was not worth watching. The idea is a decent one, but the drug's impact on the story was way overplayed; the director let this one get away. As bad as the end product is, judicious editing here and there might have bumped it up to the crappy but entertaining enough level. In the end it was little more than an hour and a half public service announcement to not do crystal meth (and of course no one with the sense to read my review would consider doing that anyway.)

Skip.",1309305600,,1207,4.679245283018868
3588296,4,B001FQLMTQ,"Dead of Winter definitely doesn't deserve all the criticism it has received thus far.

It's about a young boyfriend (and his girlfriend) who are stuck in the woods and basically, it doesn't take long until they BOTH start losing their minds.  Something evil is lurking out in those woods, and whatever it is likes to play mind games with their thoughts and makes them do unrational things.

While walking through the woods, both the young man and his girlfriend constantly hear weird, unnatural sounds that make them really nervous, upset and angry.  These sounds get to the point that it drives them crazy and fearful for their lives.

These particular scenes create an *amazingly* tense atmosphere.  In fact, they work so well that the atmosphere is the number one reason I'm giving Dead of Winter such a high rating of 4 out of 5.

The storyline is pretty good too.  The boyfriend and girlfriend keep accusing each other of things they never really did because the eeriness and strange evil inside the woods is making them go crazy, so they get into fights over, for example, who made certain phone calls, and why they shut the lights out on each other upon entering a home, etc.

Of course the other person didn't really DO any of that stuff, but the storyline creates a nice unsettling mystery showing what it's like to see two people go insane.

All the boy and girl wanted is to find a way out of those pesky woods.

Anyway, the storyline is never really confusing because at least you can understand and explain the events most of the time.

However, the ending is pretty terrible if you ask me, and the acting could have been better (especially by the girlfriend).  Far from a bad film, however.",1291939200,2,1704,4.64
3588297,3,B001FQLMTQ,"I read somewhere that McNamara inserted his name in the title like he thought he was John Carpenter. Well, it's obvious he did it to identify it and set it apart from other movies by the same name. And I agree that the soundtrack is a keeper. The movie had my attention from the beginning and I didn't mind the lack of blood and gore and gratuitous sex. McNamara created a horror movie without those kind of cheap tricks - a movie that speaks for itself. The movie certainly does send a message about street drugs. My interest didn't lag at any point and the ending was unexpected. It is a chilling movie and I would love to know about the people whose experience this movie is based on. ""Brian McNamara's Dead of Winter"" is full of suspense and the chills never stop and should not be compared to the Mary Steenburgen & Roddy McDowall version - they are two entirely different movies with entirely different plots. Both are suspense filled movies. All in all this is a good movie for a rainy day or dark night.
