1196508,5,B000007O5D,"Boy, this is an oldie! But the two clowns in it are phenomenal.  You can't help but admire how they seem to have worked their way into almost every shot and background throughout the entire video.  What a talented pair!  Especially the black and white guy!

1196510,5,B000007O5D,"My wife first bought this video (VHS) after it first came out about 20 years ago.  Our kids loved it then, and her kindergarteners loved it during that whole time.  Now our grandkids love it and we bought it in DVD form because 1) we're afraid the tape will break! and 2) we bought copies for our grandkids, too.  It is a masterful production, still today.  One advantage of the DVD over VHS:  you won't be rewinding all the time like we've done!  One word of caution: the songs have a way of sticking in your head.  You'll find yourself humming them all day, and the next day, and....",1247097600,,585,4.3119266055045875
1196511,4,B000007O5D,"My 2 1/2 year old daughter really likes it.  It's cute and the kids who act & sing in it are very good, but the sound quality is pretty poor in parts.

7905066,5,B000007O5D,"A trip down memory lane for me.  My little brother loved these.  Now that I have my own children I wanted something that wasn't Barney.  This video is constant singing with little dialog keeping my 2 year old twins interested. We purchased the ride the roller coaster and a day with the animals video also.  (my favorite is ride the roller coaster because it has a few songs adults would actually listen to.. just sung by kids).
Highly recommended
