828742,5,630428540X,"I have avoided seeing this movie for the past two years because I was under the impression it was about UFO's, telekinesis, and the like.  When a friend recommended it to me recently, I reluctantly watched it.
I found  it to be one of the most interesting movies I have seen in years.  The  ""magical"" events do not dominate the story as I thought they  would.  Instead, we see the reaction that  heightened peceptivity and  sensibility provoke in the general population when they appear in one  special person.
Travolta's abilities appear magical, but there is a  rational reason for them, and that plays a key role in the movie.  (I do  not want to give the plot away).  I noticed a key bit of dialogue involving  D.H. Lawrence and ""Lady Chatterly's Lover,"" making me aware that  the writer was very familiar with the essence of the novel.  In fact, the  movie reminded me of the perceptivity of D.H.L. and the reception his  novels, poems, and essays got from the general public. His sensitivity, I  am sure, was enhanced by his struggle with the dire circumstances of his  life, as is Travolta's.
The story is enhanced by the pairing of two  people who are hurting from the blows life has dealt them.  In a pleasant  change from the habit modern movies have of having lovers couple ""in  the first reel"" so to speak, this couple has first to work through  their problems and hesitations before they can become intimate. To me their  progress in getting to know each other slowly and trustingly was realistic  and inspiring.
Spectacular UFO effects and mind-bending tricks do not  dominate this video; in fact, they scarcely enter. What we have is a  fascinating study of a ""different"" human being and his convoluted  interactions with conventional society.",914198400,,1758,4.763333333333334

829051,5,630428540X,"George Malley is part of a close knit rural community. He is celebrating his birthday. On his way home he sees a bright light. After that his world changes. He finds he can think clearer and do extraordinary things.

Now we see if this is a gift or a curse. How will his friends and others deal with his ""Phenomenon?""

The concept of the movie is not new. However it is the execution of the story and the interaction of the characters that make this a top notch film. You could also tell that John Travolta has a great time making this film. Many of the other actors fit the parts so well hat you forgot they were acting.

If you like this film, the film ""Resurrection"" (1980) with Ellen Burstyn is similar but more serious.",1503792000,,724,4.3088235294117645

Be aware that these abilities are real and should be respected. Power can be used for serving others or for serving the self. How you use your ability and skill defines who you are in the moment. I like that the main character uses his abilities for the betterment of the world.

829902,5,630428540X,"Yes, I understand that Phenomenon is fiction, yet it is a film that gently tugs on what could be possible for the expansion of the human mind (wisdom wise, reaching beyond the expectations of what others think is possible for you etc.). Phenomenon stars John Travolta as a friendly auto mechanic named George Malley whose life is turned upside down once he gets hit by an unexplained ball of light after innocently going outside on the night of his 37th birthday. Almost seemingly overnight he gains an increased intelligence and clarity effortlessly which right away manifests in how he does his job as an auto mechanic.  His physician Doc Brunder (Robert Duvall) cannot logically make sense out of what happened to Malley but he is still accepting of him. Another person, George Malleys close friend Nate Pope (Forest Whitaker) also stands by his friend Malley during the both the high points and challenging points of what happens when his newfound abilities spring up for others to witness. In the midst of all this, George Malley tries extremely hard to court single mother Lace Pennamin (Kyra Sedgwick) and to even win over her kids Al Pennamin (David Gallagher) and Glory Pennamin (Ashley Buccile). Lace Pennamin courteously acknowledges George Malley yet she is understandably guarded due to what transpired within her relationship history. George Malley also gains the academic interest of UC Berkley Professor Dr. Ringold (Jeffrey DeMunn) after a shockingly accurate earthquake prediction despite his modest educational background. Eric Claptons song Change The World plays towards the end of the film. Bonus material; There is a theatrical trailer for Phenomenon and the recommendation of these additional titles for those who enjoyed this film; Ransom, Scream, The Nightmare Before Christmas, The Rock, Tombstone.",1442361600,4,1825,5.2714776632302405

A rather unique story, touching, at times funny, with some life lessons thrown in too. Not one of the best movies I've ever seen but good. And something you could definitely watch with young children too. Speaking of kids, the ones in this movie were wonderful young actors.

830233,5,630428540X,"I won't compete with other fine reviews already posted, but wanted to share the term ""synesthesia"" with interested viewers of ""Phenomenon.""  George's tumor produced a form of ""synesthesia"" in his brain, when neurons (grey matter, data) got connected to other neurons in ways unintended by nature. This is akin to what happens during LSD trips when people see music as colors, say, and to natural cases of synesthesia where the individual might observe numbers divisible by three with a yellowish tint. (That makes math problems or memorization a lot easier!)  Some researchers believe/wonder if the great geniuses of history (Leonardo da Vinci, Einstein, Shakespeare, etc.) were synesthetics with a natural ability to perceive connections between things and ideas considered by others to be unrelated. One interesting figure from recent American history with synesthetic abilities was Charles Sanders Peirce. Amazon carries several books about him. Like George in ""Phenomenon,"" Peirce mastered every field that he turned his hand to.  Otherworldly.

A few TED.com talks feature brain researchers who explore synesthesia and related matters.

For my money, ""Phenomenon"" is a fine movie.  The story, script and acting rang true, except George's telekinetic powers and one gap in his curriculum of study.  If I had been wearing George's hat, I would have devoted an hour a day to studying brain science.",1427241600,,1400,5.394495412844036

Both Forrest Whitaker and Robert Duval put in excellent performances also.  When the town turns out to help George celebrate his birthday he observes a bright light in the sky.  When he comes to he finds that he is unable to sleep and all his learning abilities are in high gear.  He is using more of his brain, reading several books a day and is growing more intelligent by the day.  An average man, George is having trouble coming to grips with his new found abilities and so are his friends around him.  Don't want to give away too much of the story.

830652,4,630428540X,I'm not a fan of John Travolta as I find him far too full of himself and neanderthol looking.  He is both in this movie but for some reason it works very well.  I can't think of another star who could portray a not very bright good old boy who all of a sudden develops super mental powers.  The whole cast is wonderful.  Of course Robert Duvall never puts a foot wrong when acting and he adds much to the movie.  Same thing for Kiera Sedgewick.  She looks so darling that you can see why he is so devoted to her.  I won't give away the end but this is a feel good movie and unless you prefer Travolta acting like a snake then you'll like this.,1404518400,,643,4.015748031496063

830654,5,630428540X,I thought it was an excellent movie. Better than most of John Travolta's movies. It also shows that it is human nature to fear and prejudge what you don't know or understand. In the end there was a simple explanation for what was going on with him.,1404259200,,248,4.297872340425532

830712,5,630428540X,"There is an authentic innocence, generosity of spirit and deep love shining in the character Travolta plays from the very outset of the movie. When he is tranformed by an experience and taps into a creative intelligence that is remarkable, there is never a
thought of how to exploit it for himself, but only how to give the information to others.  Its a modern parable that does not preach, has no ties to any traditional religion but speaks to our souls in a resounding way. I quite simply love this movie.",1398556800,,507,4.571428571428571

830833,5,630428540X,"I think, to date, this is the best work Travolta's ever done. Unlike his basic-but-superb one-note character portrayals (""Fever"", ""Michael"", ""Swordfish"", ""Arrow"", ""Paris""), his character here actually transforms from an everyday guy to an extraordinary guy while never losing the ""gee whiz"" quality of the everyday guy. Solidly backed by Whittaker, Duval, and Sedgewick, Travolta's portrayal is complex and heartfelt while maintaining the understatedness that makes this film a gem.",1385596800,,482,5.9

830866,5,630428540X,On the sad side.  John Travolta and Kyra Sedgwick are great together.  Travolta goes from a very normal person to someone that can learn a foreign language in 10 minutes. He can't sleep and reads 10 books a day.  There is very sad reason this is happening to him.  Highly recommend this for the family.,1384560000,,302,4.4363636363636365

831049,4,630428540X,"John Travolta's ""Phenomenon"" from 1996 is similar to ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Powder/dp/B004JM8X5E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Powder</a>"", which came out some eight months earlier. Both films are about a gifted individual with unusual powers and the reactions of those around him. ""Phenomenon"" differs from ""Powder"" in that it's about a regular guy (Travolta) who suddenly gains amazing abilities, rather than an outcast who already has them.

The other characters include a woman whom he wants to date (Kyra Sedgwick), his best friend (Forest Whitaker), his doctor (Robert Duvall), a marveling professor and miscellaneous townsfolk & government agents. The story takes place in a small town in Northern California (shot in Auburn, CA).

This is an interesting ""What if?"" story. What would happen if an average Joe suddenly attained genius and telekinesis? The film explores the untapped power of the mind and spirit. What great things would we be able to do if we were able to tap into this vast reservoir of potential! The ordinary person might likely respond with skepticism, but the story is based on numerous real-life examples, albeit perhaps not as pronounced as Travolta's character.

I've had my own run-ins with such things. For instance, about five years ago I was in bed having an intense dream when my wife burst into the room to wake me up. The smoke alarm outside the door was blaring like crazy, but there was no smoke or fire (or heat). The intense energy evoked by my dream obviously set it off because, as soon as I woke, it suddenly stopped. If there was any doubt, the same thing happened the next week. What can explain this except the untapped power of the mind and focused energy?

Another example comes to mind, albeit different: when I was around 8 years old my family and I were walking the trails of Theodore Wirth Park in Minneapolis when we came to the edge of a baseball field. As soon as we entered the outfield somehow I just knew that the current batter was going to hit the ball and it was going to hit me right in the face. I knew this but I didn't know how I knew it. I just knew. Next thing you know the batter hits the ball high into the air -- it was like slow motion -- and it came and hit me right on the cheek! (Good thing it was a softball, huh?). How did I KNOW this was going to happen? I don't know, but it's pretty amazing and it shows the power of the mind and spirit to warn us, which some call intuition.

It goes without saying that ""Phenomenon"" is worthwhile just for effectively exploring such amazing things and provoking thought.

Travolta's character is somewhat of a type of Christ in the story, which makes the ending a bit unsatisfying. I don't want to say too much (no spoilers), but the question arises: If he possesses the genius and power to do all that he does in the film, why couldn't he use these powers to deal with a certain situation at the end? To me, the writers and filmmakers took the easy way out by giving us a ""realistic"" ending. In short, they played it safe.

Still, this is a good movie if you like dramas and the subject matter piques your interest.

The film runs 123 minutes.

lack of depth of the average human intellect, and why education should be the most important aspect of every government's budget.

831115,3,630428540X,"Back in 1996, filmmaker Jon Turteltaub would go on to work on his latest film ""Phenomenon"" after coming off two successful films, ""While You Were Sleeping"" (1995) and ""Cool Runnings"" (1993).

With a story written by Gerald Di Pego (""Message in a Bottle"", ""Instinct""), the film would star John Travolta (""Get Shorty"", ""Pulp Fiction"", ""Saturday Night Fever"", ""Grease""), Kyra Sedgwick (""The Closer"", ""Gamer""), Forest Whitaker (""Platoon"", ""The Last King of Scotland"", ""Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai"") and Robert Duvall (""The Godfather"" films, ""Apocalypse Now"", ""Deep Impact"").

The film was a success in the box office.  Budgeted at $32 million, ""Phenomenon"" would earn over $152 million in the box office.  And having been released on VHS and DVD in the past, ""Phenomenon"" will now be released on Blu-ray courtesy of Touchstone Entertainment.

VIDEO:

""Phenomenon"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:40:1).  Video quality is very good and features an all-new digital restoration.  There are detail and more clarity when closeups of the characters are seen, from the stubble on John Travolta to clothing.  Vibrant colors are much more evident than the previous DVD release which looked softer, so this Blu-ray release is an upgrade over the original DVD.  Skin tones are natural, black levels are nice and deep and I didn't notice any edge enhancement, artifacts, banding or any video problems during my viewing of the film.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Phenomenon"" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio and Spanish 2.0 Dolby Digital.  The soundtrack is primarily dialogue with the occasional music that can be heard through the surround channels.  But the most where you do hear surround channels being utilized is for ambiance during crowd scenes or when George is being struck by the light.  But for a film such as ""Phenomenon"", lossless audio is appropriate, dialogue is crystal clear as with the music for the film.

Subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish.

SPECIAL FEATURES

""Phenomenon"" comes with the original theatrical trailer.

JUDGMENT CALL:

One day you are a normal man.  The next day, you realize you have special abilities.

""Phenomenon"" was a film that rather intriguing when it first came out.  A sci-fi film that captivated viewers for its take on one man's special ability and enhanced intelligence due to being struck by light.  Is it a supernatural phenomenon or something health related?  And despite using his abilities for good, it starts to make friends and residents of the town scared of him.

This is the premise of ""Phenomenon"".  And while there have been a few films that have similar storylines, one thing that people have felt about ""Phenomenon"" is its correlation to Travolta's dedication to the Church of Scientology (which he would followup several years later in the film ""Battlefield Earth: A Saga of the Year 3000).

But the correlation is the belief that all people have special abilities but must go through steps or changes in one's life in wanting to achieve clarity, free of the past and knowing that you are part of something much bigger than humanity.

The religious correlation was discussed a lot back in the mid-'90s but in the case of this film, it's a film that tries to stay safe without being polemic.  The character of George Malley is a good guy who wants his abilities to help people, but because people are not sure how to react to his new abilities, many wonder if he is an extra-terrestrial, faking his abilities or what.  There is no explanation.  And so the film tries to play things quite safe with George being worried about how others think about him.

Sure, we get the U.S. government storyline included (and I can't mention any more than that without spoiling the storyline) but if anything, the film tries to focus on the positive.  May it be his relationship to his friends, the people in the village to the one woman that George has liked.  The film doesn't stray away from the good nature of its character, so for those hoping for something drastic or even integration of action sequences, this is not that type of film.

It's a straightforward sci-fi film with an interesting concept of what is causing George's abilities, but other than that, writer Gerald Di Pego plays it safe with the screenplay.  And to the benefit of ""Phenomenon"", it's a film that has a stellar cast and a filmmaker who just came off directing the successful romantic comedy, ""While You Were Sleeping"".  But the film was too simple for me and I felt it could have been much better.

The Blu-ray release does look very good on Blu-ray thanks to its new digital restoration and the lossless soundtrack sounds very good as well.  But unfortunately, aside from the theatrical trailer, there are no special features included.

Overall, ""Phenomenon"" could have been a different film.  I suppose focusing on George's supernatural abilities would make this almost to a superhero film and this is not what the film is all about.  For those wanting a simple storyline without the complexities of other sci-fi films, ""Phenomenon"" may be for you!  Cool movie, but an average Blu-ray release.",1354147200,2,5143,4.957943925233645

Granted that super-intelligence would probably enhance one's thought processes and thus cause us to banish most selfish thoughts, wouldn't such a person still be tempted once in a while to use those powers for his own gain? Not big gains, but just small ones, like moving the dinner trays and switching on stuff by thought? This movie has none of that, in fact, all Travolta does is going around saving the world!

But the movie does redeem itself by at least having a story that is interesting enough for viewers to want to watch it to its conclusion. Travolta's acting is commendable, and the supporting cast do well enough to maintain interest in the movie. Aside from the fact that is unrealistic, it is a good movie to watch that brings a sense of wonder and intrigue about the world around us.

Travolta's infectious smile makes the movie worth watching. He wins you over with his wonderful smile and bubbly personality. He's a nice guy amid nice people living in a nice town. The movie at times seems to be in danger of collapsing from its huge weight of niceness. It's a flick that some will find insufferable because of its chronic cuteness and terminal niceness. Some may find the movie subversive.
 There's a core of simplicity that could have drowned it, but somehow you surrender to its good nature.

831284,4,630428540X,"George Malley (John Travolta) is an affable, easy-going auto mechanic in a sleepy American town.  He has become smitten by Lace (Kyra Sedgwick), a ferociously-independent and emotionally guarded single mother who manufacturers chairs in an even more remote location than the town itself.  George's bumbling attempts at piquing her interest continually fail, yet he remains optimistic, even after she rebuffs him for his 37th birthday party.

Remonstrated by his long-time friend Nate (Forest Whitaker) that he shouldn't be purchasing his own drinks at his own birthday party, George wanders outside, where he has a most unusual encounter--perhaps even of the ""first"" and ""close"" variety.  Rendered senseless by the experience, he soon recovers and heads back inside the bar, where his pals continue their celebrations and chuckle as he tells his story.  Later that night, George lies awake, pressured thoughts consuming his mind.  Suddenly, he bolts out of his useless bed as a surprising illumination enters his brain:  he now knows exactly how the darned rabbit keeps getting in his fenced-off garden!

There are so many undercurrent messages socked away in this movie, it is a wonder the director, Jon Turteltaub (""Instinct,"" ""National Treasure""), remembered to film the thing.  It is a testament to this director's subtlety that these messages come across as gentle and graceful reminders of life's beauty, rather than as annoying platitudes meant to placate the unwashed masses.  A few examples, and I have doubtless missed many:  ""sometimes remarkable things happen to unremarkable people,"" ""every person's life belongs to a greater whole,"" ""judge not with haste,"" ""information is power,"" ""humans possess near-unlimited potential,"" and ""love can be everything.""  I tend to view the cramming of acceptable moral precepts down an audience's collective throat--during something meant as entertainment--to be a particularly sad method by which Hollywood demonstrates its humanity; however, this tactic is not being employed here.

*minor spoilers/plot points below*

We are witness to George coming to grips with his new-found powers.  His rise in the community from country gentleman to powerful entity is shown clearly through the eyes of the audience, who exhibit very believable reactions:  fear, humility, puzzlement, and, that most cursed of double-edged swords, worship.  He witnesses friends drifting away, metamorphing into disciples, or being shamed into silence because of their perceived intellectual inadequacy.  George becomes slave to these myriad new ideas filling his brain, preventing sleep, self-care, and respite.  He involves himself in a cipher ""game"" on the short-wave radio belonging to Nate, and ultimately provokes very highly-placed unwanted attention, indeed.  George wonders why all his newfound abilities help him not at all in his quest to pierce Lace's heart.  He invents many rude implements, which yet work spectacularly well in their functions.  A seismologist from Berkley, visiting Mr. Malley to verify his ability to ""sense"" ULF (ultra-low frequency) emissions--which herald the arrival of an earthquake--is swept along on a scavenger hunt of sorts for an extremely sick local boy.

*end minor spoilers/plot points*

There are far, far too many ideas explored in this movie, but it succeeds anyway.  Travolta is not fantastically convincing in the beginning; yet he, like George, becomes more and more remarkable (and thus, believable) as the movie progresses.  The gentle way he informs Lace that ""it's happening,"" made me want to switch the movie off, so real it seemed.  Kyra is absolutely convincing, as always.  I fell in love with her character at least five separate times in the movie.  Robert Duvall and Forest Whitaker also steal many scenes with their requisite skill.  Mr. Duvall's outburst in the pub towards movie's end stunned me into silence.  Forest's performance as socially-stunted introvert, incapable of expressing his feelings towards women, was totally on the money.  I'm sorry I waited nearly eleven years to see this movie.  It touched my mind and my heart by the end--just as Malley's experience touched his, and those of the people he loved.  This was a beautiful and worthwhile movie.

He is a well liked auto mechanic who tries hard but is not too good at anything except fixing cars. Then one day, when leaving his birthday party, he sees a light in the sky and then passes out.

When he comes to, everything is different but it takes a while for him to put his finger on it. His concentration is better. He is able to retain what he reads. He has lots of bright ideas. Along with all of this, though, he cannot sleep. He spends all night reading and coming up with gadgets and theories. Most of them work.

His friends notice things are different but they cannot shake the ideal of a dull George Malley. His intelligence makes them a bit jealous and then even frightens them. This is especially true when he manages to learn Portuguese in half and hour in order to save a lost child with food poisoning. They are sure they are afraid when he exhibits some telekinesis. Rumors abound.

Most of the rumors center around the UFO George saw on the night of his change. That makes things scarier.

George falls in love with a single mom and has a hard time winning her over. Eventually, though, he does because she can see his good heart. This is about the time that he comes under scrutiny from academic and government types. The academics want to study him and the government is frightened because they cannot control him. Things come to a head when it turns out that there is a very mundane explanation for the phenomenon and some medical types want to cut him up.

I didn't try to take it too seriously, as I fell in love with George, the Dr., and Lace.  George genuinely cares about his friends.  The Dr., played wonderfully by the great Robert Duvall, understands people, and Lace is over the top sexy ( like some jewish women I have known...can Sedgwick be a jewish name?)

831317,3,630428540X,"This movie works at all only because of the quality of the acting of Travolta, Duvall, Sedgwick, Whitaker, and the others who really do commit to this incredibly dumb plot.  It is easy to get caught up in the love story, and in the wonderfully nice George Malley (as all his friends do), but every piece of ""knowledge"" in this film is as whacked out as Lace Pennamin's stupid chairs.

At first, when the light hits George, we buy into something unearthly has given him these powers, but when the truth is revealed late into the movie, well, let me say that what happened to George does not and cannot happen from what the story has happen to him.  If you have ever had that in your family, as I have, you know what really happens and it is not, EVER, an increase in mental ability, let alone something as impossibly fanciful as telekinesis.

Then there is the whole sinister government thing.  Why do this?  Why is it necessary that the government is out to enslave us by keeping us ignorant and stupid and yet if we dare rise above the enforced mediocrity, they want to take us away?  This is even dumber than the asserted reason for George's abilities.

Even so, I like every character in George's town, especially Duvall's Doc Brunder and Whitaker's Nate Pope.  It is the quality of their acting and commitment to this story that makes the film work at all.  When I first saw it, I suspended belief and common sense all the way until the George finds out about the source of his powers.  Then I got annoyed and the feeling kept increasing all the way to the end.  Still, Travolta and Duvall do have a great scene together at the hospital that would have worked in any movie without all this other nonsense.

831318,2,630428540X,"Motion picture messages are so smoothly constructed and mass produced today, audiences would hardly bat and eye if they were seeing anti-intellectualism presented to them in a form that also imputes witchcraft, telekinesis for example.  Big ideas must mean something from outer space has infected the brain; or anything intelligent, resourceful or efficient.  Also foreign language acquisition is held suspect by this piece of government propaganda, we're better off being mono-lingual and ignorant of others around the world.  While not as mudslinging and rife with judicial malpractice as the Salem Witchcraft Trials, movies still libel segments of the population the state has deemed unwanted or suspect for reasons of their beliefs, attitudes and intellectual pursuits.  Then the mudsling is that intelligence must be unnatural and under alien control, that it means something is organically wrong with the brain; of late it has been more popular for the exercise of state oppression to simply label people as mentally ill (without all the cosmic conspiracy angle).  What it really means is that the tireless efforts the government has put in place to destroy the public education system, and to weaponize the culinary water supplies everywhere with a vectored chemical incapacitant wmd, fluoridation, must now jealously and suspiciously interdict any signs of its ineffectiveness at rendering the population functionally illiterate, subaverage in memory, language, logic and mathematics skills.

There is no big important secret cipher system at risk, that the government needs to keep a secret in order to subjugate unwanted populations of chemically inundated citizens; it is plain to see and requires no algorithm to decode.  The pattern is obvious:  exploit, lie, poison and insult the residual intelligence of the population they haven't yet completely wiped out.  This movie is a highly revealing sick statement of an insular, autocratic technological empire crumbling under its own inconsistencies and open acts of war, mob violence and vigilantism on America; a foreign policy of isolationism attempting to disguise corporate colonialism as our outreach, when the overstatements of xenophobia for international languages couldn't be more apparent or reflection of the decline in the U.S. education system.  Demonization of intellectuals is old fascist whining and scare tactic.  It is making more movies than sense because its only card to play is hypnosis in order to evade fairly simple identification of its ideology and modus operandi.

Other than the large dimensions of psychological film project objectives for mass populations the psycorps or planning and budgeting of the Pentagon designs, this film also has latent suggestible side effects that could be harmful to young people prior to the age of disillusionment with the establishment.  The film could instill phobias in young people that academic achievement or the strengthening of their intellect is somehow a demonic or alien compromise, that smart is bad and that dumb is preferred.  Use this film if anything to make a fool of the corruption that thinks we take it seriously.  Who is the more alien-invasion insidiousness anyway?

There are these people out there who think they have big ideas, something to contribute.  They believe in direct democracy, energy conservation, environmentalism, alternative forms of power extraction and won't learn from the coy ridicules of cinematic revisionism not to see others equally, or not bother to learn to speak some of their language.  What's to be done with them?  Perhaps they'll die naturally from the progression of their disease, as they so should.  It seems that would be in keeping with this film's sick prescription.

 Oh, and in case you're writing in the newspaper oped style that can't make an argument without  telling people what to think verbatim, remember to begin with the polemic:  ""That's what's going on here!...""",1133654400,6,3957,5.417618270799347

He is now obsessed with knowledge, of learning, and he's a little telekinetic to boot.  How this affects him and the people in his small town overrides the obligatory governmental intervention subplot.  Travolta is marvelous and so is the rest of the cast: Kyra Sedgwick as the relation-phobic young mother who is the object of Travolta's affections; Robert Duvall is superb as the doctor/friend who tries to get Travolta through this change; Forest Whitaker as his farmer buddy.

Actually this is a very good film, largely carried by the strong cast of John Travolta, Kyra Sedgewick, Forest Whitaker and Robert Duvall.  Yes there are a few corny moments especially towards the end but they were forgivably brief not tediously drawn out, compared to your typical Hollywood tearjerker which this is not.  I won't give away the ending except to say that it is not one of your dime a dozen and-they-lived-happily-ever-after things.

""Phenomenon"" actually has a lot of Eastern philosophy behind it---the idea that we are all connected at a deep cosmic and psychical level which most of us never imagine nor dare to access, as well as the New Ageish belief that we only use about 10% of our brains' full capabilities.

Travolta is known to be a Scientologist, which made me wonder a little how much that might have influenced this film which is nowhere near as kooky as your standard Scientology doctrine which you can get from L. Ron Hubbard's infamous (science fiction) book, ""Dianetics.""",1112486400,37,1178,4.840796019900497
831371,4,630428540X,"Confusion. Nauseating. Touching. Homey. Four words I'd use to describe the movie known as ""Phenomenon"", one that I watched yesturday during my psychology class. Why the confusion, why the nausea? Perhaps because I wasn't expecting this movie...I didn't even know what it was called. But aside from that, and aside from looking at a scientific explanation, this movie exceeds on most standards. What fooled me at the beginning surprised me near the end; towards the beginning I was feeling almost stupid watching this because there was no scientific explanation for what was happening. A man sees a bright light and the next day wakes up a genius. He seems oblivious to wanting to know why this happens to him but instead choses to go with the flow and, after sensing the beginnings of an earth quake, seems at a loss and seeks for answers to his newly developed questions when all begins to go downhill.

I won't go into too much detail about what happens next but for the most part of the movie, I was in a state of confusion. Why was Travolta feeling like this? What happened to him? And most importantly, why doesn't he seem concerned when everybody else in his know-all town is? I think that, coupled with the small-town feeling (which makes me feel nauseas at times) and the irritating music made me feel out of the loop while everybody else around me was oohing and awing over Travolta's performence.

Towards the end, I was feeling a little bit more reassured. There are some touching scenes but Travolta's great performence more than makes up for the confusion surrounding his diagnosis. His love interest (who's name I cannot recall at the moment) does an outstanding performence as a torn bystander who doesn't know what else to do but simply watch her friend break apart day by day. Altough Travolta's diagnosis is truly devastating, it's wonderful to watch how he deals with it...and I think that's where this movie excels, the point it's trying to make and the point I missed entirely (perhaps because I was expecting more of a scientifically visioned film). This movie isn't about psychology or about earning 200 IQ points over night - it's about being the outcast, being the scum of society, being the freak of nature...and learning how to deal with it.",1111449600,5,2268,4.797953964194374

The challenge of imagining what it would be like to be hyper-intelligent has defeated a lot of writers. How could we know, after all? How could a chimp grasp the thoughts that go through the average human mind? This movie does quite a good job of handling this problem, but it really zooms in on the difficulty of finding a role in life when all your friends look at you in awe (or downright fear) and even the government sees you as a security risk.

It's not very exciting, but it is emotional and thought-provoking. And surprisingly funny, in an unassuming way.

What this movie is, actually, is a story about a man learning to cope with something that he can't understand, and how it brings him closer to his friends and his community, and how it allows him to understand and deal with his own fate.
Yes, it's a bit sappy at times, but it also contains some really excellent performances. Travolta delivers what it certainly his most authentic and touching portrayal of a real human being yet seen in his post-Tarantino career.

831374,4,630428540X,"I originally saw this movie in the theater and was pleasantly surprised.  Not that I can see it at home the film's wonder has not disappeared.
Phenomenon stars John Travolta (with an appearance by Brent Spiner of ST:NG).  The premise of this film is that John sees a light in the sky that hits him and knocks him out.  After that he has increased brain usage.  This enables him to read quickly, comprehend, think clearly and even perform minor telekinesis.  In the small town in which he lives this sort of thing can cause some problems and fear.  Robert Duval gives an excellent portrayal of a small town doctor and the rest of the cast does a marvelous job.
Phenomenon is partly a love story as John pursues the woman of his dreams, but it is also much more.  It is a film about facing the unknown and the wonder of learning.  While much of the film is funny it is definitely not a comedy and you should be prepared to have various emotional strings pulled throughout the film.

It does a great job of that; unfortunately, the story is paced incorrectly and thus has a long introduction, a crammed development and a schmaltzy, lengthy, sickening ending. Like most tales in which a character is suddenly a genius, such as ""Flowers For Algernon,"" there's a conflict between love for a woman and the alienation of someone feared by others for his ability. To his credit, John ""I was in Disco movies"" Travolta does a great job of portraying a man overwhelmed by his own intellect, looking every bit like someone who gets struck by revelation every few minutes. He's also every bit as childish and handsomely unintentionally aloof as a genius would be, and is enigmatic in that role; Kyra Sedgewick does a great job with her 1.5-dimensional character. This movie ultimately would do best if the rock/folk music interludes were cut and replaced with some silent scenes, and if the last 30 minutes were reduced from hanky-sopping drama to a few insights and then a slightly more ambiguous, less Christ-like ending.

  John Travolta is phenomenal in the phenomenal movie ""Phenomenon"".
  The movie is about George Malley, a simple guy of average intelligence who works in a garage in his small California town.  During his birthday party, he walks outside and looks up at the sky.  He sees a flash of light, and is knocked down to the ground.
  Gradually, he discovers he can do supernatural things, like move objects without touching them, sensing ultrasonic waves to predict earthquakes, and learning a foriegn language in 20 minutes.
  This movie provides solemn moments and funny moments.  After a sneaky and totally unpredictable little twist in the story (regarding the mysterious flash of light and what causes Malley's powers), we find what the movie's message really is.
  I'll shut up now so you can go watch it and be amazed.  The title says it all.

J: 4/5 Stars
  phenomenon is a screen gem. it might not be perfect but it sure hits close to home in our hearts. it is about a man, played by john travolta, who on his birthday sees a flash of light in the sky and is knocked off his feet. when he arises he is different or feels different at least. what did he see in the night sky? a UFO? a hallucination? part of the magic of phenomenon is finding out at the end what the light really was.but phenomenon is much more than that.
  it takes place in a quaint little town where everyone knows eachother and no secrets can be kept without your neighbor knowing. everyone meets in the conventional bar where they find out things from others. George Malley is a humble mechanic who is your average straight guy. he is is in love with the town recluse and is a close aquaintance with her kids. after the encounter on his birthday, everything changes. his intelligence seems to have been ameliorated. now, he reads five books a day, can remember nearly everything, and has the ability to move things with his mind. the townspeople first react in shock, then in awe, and then in fear of the ordinary man with now extraordinary abilities. they feel that george has been altered.in doesn't help when he gets in trouble with the government(the scene where he is interrogated is priceless).
  Then after all this...i will leave you to see the rest. the end of the movie should come as a surprise to you as it was to the characters in the movie and me. john travolta is a good choice for george malley, and his performance carries an insight into his thoughts and feelings. this movie really inspires you to walk out on it, and it remains in your heart for a long time after.",1057276800,,2570,4.543478260869565

However, the role was played like it should have been. To me, the movie is all about relationships we have with each other and how we effect others through those relationships. The movie has you speculating why he now has a ""special gift"" as evidenced on the assumptions of the townsfolks. He's betrayed often in the name of fear and ignorance. Yet, he never gives up his friendship. The emotional swings that fly through the movie seem very genuine in the characters.

831471,5,630428540X,"I desperately wanted to see Phenomenon after I had seen its preview. The story of a man who mysteriously starts to change into a genius but retains his humanity, sounded too good to miss.  It's nice to find a film with a  bit of soul in this day and age.

There seemed to be a little  controversy concerning the fact that Travolta played the lead. Apparently  by belonging to the Church of Scientology some people mistakenly believed  that his character was a portrayal of that organization's ideal human. Even  if it were true I would have thought this would bring more people to their  doors rather than less.

George Malley, (Travolta), is a small town  motor mechanic, a likable man who is struggling to learn Spanish whilst  trying to work up the courage to ask Lace, a reclusive single mother, (Kyra  Sedgwick), out on a date.  But his sedate life changes dramatically when on  the evening of his birthday he sees lights in the sky and blacks out. From  then on he finds it almost impossible to sleep and his friends start to  notice differences in him.

His intelligence is amazing enough but  when he shows talents in less conventional areas, many of the town's folks  become nervous and even afraid. Despite the fact that he is doing nothing  but good, they begin to draw away from him. All that is, except Nate,  (Forest Witaker), his best friend, the town doctor, (Robert Duval), and  Lace. The three of them manage to see the beauty within the man. That  constant part of him that has not changed and is even more remarkable than  his new abilities.

The film takes a darker turn when the  government steps in and takes George away for testing. As the mood is  plunged into chilled water and his future begins to look bleaker, we are  warmed by the support of Doc and the love of his, by now, girlfriend Lace.  This movie has the power to reaffirm a positive life and maybe even reverse  a negative one. See it as soon as you can.",957830400,,1942,4.497126436781609
831472,5,630428540X,"I took me awhile to catch on to the John Travolta ""comeback."" Always a good actor, he is trancendent in ""Phenomenon."" Taking his character of George, struck by a mysterious light, and turning him from  an average man to a genius, could have been an actor's trap. Travolta makes  it his triumph. He gives George such a humanity that even with the genius  powers we are aware that George of old is still there, trying to  desparately to just be his old self, and only the girl he longs for, played  excellently by Kyra Segwick seems to understand his wanting to remain the  same, no matter how many ""miracles"" he performs. So many films  like this are too serious, use too many special effects, or are just plain  ridiculous. Travolta great performance seems to lift the entire genre and  wins us over like he does Segwick and her two children. The supporting cast  is excellent, especially Robert Duvall, who does miraculous things with the  town doctor. Forrest Whittiker is also good as George's best friend. The  town accepts the miracles like no other movie town does. Yes, they are in  awe, but they still doubt, as George doubts, that he was given a gift as a  mistake, but when all is said and done, we know the ""bright  light"" made the right choice, that he was able to even handle his own  mortality. There is a scene near the end of the movie, when George is  sharing his last moments and an apple with the two young children, that is  as moving as any I've seen in recent memory. Some may see  ""Phenomenon"" as too far-fetched or mauldlin, and if so they are  as jaded as many movie goers are getting. What does an audience want? Here  is a movie without much violence, blood, or spectacular special effects and  does have a message but does not force it on you, how all of us have the  possibility to be more than we think, that there is genius on a small  scale, in the feelings for love, simple pleasures, sharing an apple with  children, or facing one's own mortality without fear.

One evening, at a party to celebrate his  37th birthday, George stumbles outside, mug o' beer in hand, and is bowled  over by a strange light in the sky. Is it a U.F.O. or is this country  bumpkin seeing things? George's (and the whole town's) true astonishment  comes when he discovers that now he's able to break secret government  codes, predict earthquakes, and read four or five books a day. And in his  free time he's designing cars that run on fertilizer. Now that's what I  call getting the most out of your education.
Eventually the yokels turn  against and reject what they can't understand. George becomes an oddity,  some even believe a prophet. He's rounded up the feds, studied like a lab  rat, and then left to deal with the consequences of his miraculous  metamorphosis.
Phenomenon attacks its subject in an unpreachy,  down-to-earth way that makes believability a given.
