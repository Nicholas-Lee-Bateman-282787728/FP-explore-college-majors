8267735,4,B0017XOF3C,"The All About series are my sons perpetual favorites.  In response to an earlier review, Hard Hat Harry is pretty cheesie I'll admit it, but he is not creepy.  My son has been watching these videos since he was 2 and still watches them on and off now that he is nearly 4.  The content is really great for toddlers and each video is only around 30 minutes.  Yes the quality of the videos is at times poor, especially the Firetrucks video. But my son has never complained.  Not only are the videos entertaining but they are educational as well.",1324252800,,542,4.38
8267736,2,B0017XOF3C,"These ""All About"" videos are interesting for kids, but parents will be taken aback. They are ""hosted"" by the very creepy Hard Hat Harry; a strange genie who pops up in the middle of kids playing, and takes them on adventures.  I certainly don't want my kids to wander off with some weird guy who invites them to look at trains/cars/etc.  Honestly, he strikes my wife and me as a potential molester.  Finally, the quality of the videos is lousy: many of them look to be filmed - poorly  - in the early 1980's. We are not buying any more of this series, and now have to explain to our kids about talking to strangers.",1230595200,3,615,4.321739130434783
