4284887,4,B0047D5ZR4,"After seeing the Olympics, I wanted to know who trained the winner, who was classically beautiful and breath-taking.  When I learned it was Carl's student, I immediately bought everything I could find that he had produced.  This video is quite good, but he doesn't give away all his secrets.  Some you really have to look for.  This dvd is fun because you see the Olympic winner in his early stages of training with his rider as a newer working student of Carl's.  While his narrative is very useful, watching the riders closely and the way they use their hands and the bit was most enlightening for me anyway.  You can see how they gently but firmly moved the bit around in the horses mouth to supple the jaw.  Done crudely this would be called ""sawing"".  Done correctly it massages the horses tongue and gets them to chew the bit and relax the jaw.  He never says anything about it, nor do any of the instructors I've taken lessons from.  I guess this is a hard thing to teach but you can see it here and how well it works in educated hands.",1348012800,8,1043,4.385416666666667
4284888,4,B0047D5ZR4,"It was fun to see Valegro in this video.  He is much younger and training 3rd level instead of Grand Prix.  Since he has done so well with Charlotte Dujardin (almost beating Steffen and Ravel this year), the training he has received at Carl Hester's barn must be highly rated!  The general philosophy of Carl Hester was made pretty evident although I didn't see lots of specifics.  The young horse that was described as naughty was very well behaved.  I had hoped to see more evidence of early training methods but the ride was seamless. It is fun to listen to Carl and watch the rides.",1334102400,2,586,4.490566037735849

8418020,5,B0047D5ZR4,"This is a video full of gems pertaining to the training of horses all delivered by Karl in his wonderful realistic natural way, nothing is secret or mysterious, he says it how it is and what a brilliant DVD! After watching the video you just cannot wait to ride your horse and try out things, even the basics are fun.",1408320000,,317,4.3
8418021,5,B0047D5ZR4,Amazing!  Best Dressage video ever!,1405555200,,35,6.0
8418022,4,B0047D5ZR4,carl hester's clearly articulated training goals and the approach he has to attain them was both instructive and enjoyable. His sense of humor added to the presentation because as we all know  training is difficult yet he made it  a pleasant experience.  His reference to the elastic reins was fleeting.  It was not an infomercial.  I watch the DVD frequently to pick up  subtleties that I  missed.,1397433600,,398,4.850746268656716
8418023,5,B0047D5ZR4,I have enormous respect for Carl Hester & his training philosophy. The video was a good overview of his methods.,1390089600,,112,4.65
8418024,5,B0047D5ZR4,"Again, not a training how-to video, but rather a visual discussion of what can work, and why from someone who obviously loves his horses.",1388620800,,137,4.75
8418025,3,B0047D5ZR4,Enjoyed the video.  You get to see what Carl is working on and what he decides other riders should take care of.  He realizes he won't fit every horse.,1379808000,,151,4.172413793103448
8418026,3,B0047D5ZR4,"Interesting DVD to watch, though more of an advertisement for his fantastic elastic reins than an educational DVD. If you want to see nice horses ridden well, buy it. If you're looking for a how to, might want to look elsewhere.",1374624000,5,228,4.585365853658536
8418027,5,B0047D5ZR4,"Admittedly a fan of Carl Hester's for many years, I thoroughly enjoyed this video. I have watched it twice and gained additional insights, with each viewing. Each horse brings different talents and he taylors the training to each individual horse, explaining the what, the why, and the riders were all able to demonstrate what he described. He is very articulate, bringing humor as well as knowledge to a discipline that can often, and very honestly, be considered stuffy and uptight. My own horses are benefiting from what I have gained watching this DVD and I plan to complete my library with the book I do not yet own.",1363824000,3,621,4.7592592592592595
8418028,5,B0047D5ZR4,"Love this video, Carl is adorable and funny, the horses are beautiful, and it's so fun to see Charlotte and Valegro in the early stages of their training.  A little blueprint for how to train your horse to win an Olympic Gold Medal!",1360368000,,232,4.395348837209302
