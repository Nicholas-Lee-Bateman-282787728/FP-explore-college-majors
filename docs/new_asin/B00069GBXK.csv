8040594,5,B00069GBXK,"This is a cheap way to acquire this classic film that has apparently fallen into the public domain. There is a copyright warning at the beginning from Digiview Productions, but I have my doubts. I was surprised to see it was made in China, but it played just fine.  It claims to be digitally remastered. It might have been once. This seems like standard VHS quality. It's wonderful to see 1937 Technicolor.  It's not awesome sharp, but it's perfectly watchable and the sound is fine. There are no special features. It lets you click on ""Preview,"" but it just starts playing the film. It came in a slim case with a different photo. The photo shown here is on the disc inside. The cover on the one I received is March and Gaynor embracing.

The film itself is a masterpiece. I cry at the last line every time. If you're only familiar with the Judy Garland / James Mason musical version, you have seen a totally different film. James Mason was one of the best actors ever on film, but Fredric March WAS Norman Maine. The Gaynor / March chemistry wasn't as amazing as that of Garland and Mason, but you will adore them both and get some good laughs.  The color footage of the Chinese Theater in 1937 alone is worth the price of admission! A similar film that predated this was ""What Price Hollywood?""",1394236800,2,1296,4.478813559322034
8040595,4,B00069GBXK,"Two of the finest examples of drama from Hollywood's fledgling golden age, William Wellman's 'A Star Is Born' (1937) and George Stevens' 'Penny Serenade' (1941), are showcased in this double feature from Catcom.  Each earns 4 1/2 stars, boasting superb performances by lead and supporting cast to complement truly absorbing storytelling by director and screenwriters, respectively.  The transfer of 'Star'-- an early color production which appears faded and somewhat out of focus-- is as good as any I've seen in the public domain (3 stars), while picture and audio clarity on 'Penny'-- from an obviously more blighted source-- is slightly below average (2-plus stars).  The quality of the prints, unrestored as they are, isn't a deal-breaker, however, as it affords very watchable versions of two excellent films in one economical package.  4-minus stars overall.",1372377600,,864,5.425373134328358
