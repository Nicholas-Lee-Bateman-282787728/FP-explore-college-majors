7861348,5,630409583X,"If you have ever tried to learn to dance using video dance lessons and failed, you have never seen Nick Felix video lessons. He is by far the best dance instructor, without a doubt. He makes learning to dance easy with his approach to teaching.  He teaches you the basics and demands you learn them. If you follow his methods you will learn to dance very well and enjoy doing it. He may be getting up in years now but I have seen his early instructional videos and his later ones. All are great for learning to dance.",1305417600,,517,4.275510204081633
