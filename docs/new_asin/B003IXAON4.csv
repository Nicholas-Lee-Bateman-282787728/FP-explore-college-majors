8397763,1,B003IXAON4,"Buyers beware.  I like Amazon for publishing reviews and I just want to share my bad experience in buying this from Sonystyle.com.  I searched it under PS3 and Sonystyle.com showed it as an item they offer for $15.oo without photos, no discription and titled Lady Gaga Just Dance. So I thought I can play her music and learn to dance (just like other PS3 format).  The phrase (Ultimate Review) was omitted.  As soon as I opened it, I was disappointed that it is not PS3 and only 3 DVD (100% UNauthorized) and full of stories and interviews of Lady Gaga.  I did not even want to finish the first disc.  I requested for refund/return but Sonystyle.com sent me email ""denied"".  Definitely NOT the item I want and expect.  The DVD label clearly stated ""100% not authorized"" and with explanation ""This product is 100% independent and is not associated or approved in any way by Lady Gaga or her past and present management. Thank you Amazon for providing the opportunity to share feedback about this item.",1337990400,,1000,4.674285714285714
8397764,1,B003IXAON4,"I expected more music videos on this dvd. Lady GaGa is almost not present. Disapointment is the keyword, and the same goes for the other dvd - Glamourpuss: The Lady Gaga Story :-((

I've just wasted my money on 2 dvd's. Should have read presentation more thoroughly, before bying the dvd's.

I thought that I purcased concert/music vids and not so much talking about Lady GaGa as there is.",1311897600,5,389,4.6231884057971016
