8191204,5,B0000844JD,"""Das m&auml;dchen Rosemarie"" (""A Girl Called Rosemarie"") from 1996 was directed by Bernd Eichinger and features a mesmerizing performance by Nina Hoss in the title role. Based on the real-life story of 'Rosemarie Nitribitt' (Nina Hoss) an intelligent young-woman from the wrong side of the tracks, who during post-war Germany's meteoric economic recovery, got caught-up with the elite circle that were pulling the strings and reaping its rewards! 'Rosemarie' just wanted a chance to get ahead the best way she knew (using her phenomenal feminine charms), and to be able to taste the life of the upper crust and maybe even be accepted by them. However, she soon came to realize, that she was just a disposable plaything in the hands of her powerful male associates. And that they were really calling the shots all along! The cast were all very good and the era was perfectly captured and sumptuously photographed. The finale (at the ball), was especially memorable: with a surreal and Wagnerian-like quality (the lighting and staging). Again, Nina Hoss was simply incredible, she brought the character to life and I can't see anyone not being able to sympathize and feel for 'Rosemarie'. A superb film, worth buying for sure! I'm glad I got the chance to see it again. The DVD picture quality was excellent. NTSC, German (English subtitles), NR 127 mins.

Love and Peace,

8191205,5,B0000844JD,This movie is loosely based on a real life person Rosemarie Nitribitt.  It's a really good German drama about a wild girl who uses her looks and manipulation to get ahead.  There is some great acting here by Nina Hoss and Matthieu Carriere.,1216598400,3,240,4.558139534883721
