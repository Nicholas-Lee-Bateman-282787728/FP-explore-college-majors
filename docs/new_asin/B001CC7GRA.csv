3508386,5,B001CC7GRA,"I'm loving this. Long time Stones fan. The documentary disc is so cool. To them grouped around with acoustics, stripped down is a dream come true. Singing live together truly moving to me. Wonderful harmonies .The CD is fantastic. Some real treats on concert performances. Down In The Bottom, Spider and the Fly got me psyched to hear new disc with blues overtones. If you love the Stones I would think you love this. Tokyo sessions really cool. IMHO if you can swing it the deluxe is way to go.",1464998400,9,495,4.511111111111111

You can never get enough from this band and all of their passion, life lessons, and pure talent. No other band ever has gone this long with new music and consistent tours - puts the ole' ""let's get together for another reunion tour"" every 5 or 20 years and say we are still around as a band to shame.

3508401,5,B001CC7GRA,"This review is for the DVD/CD combo as I have yet to upgrade to Blu-Ray so here goes. There is a long standing argument that has something to do with wether or not a Beatles fan is an Elvis fan as supposedly the two don't mix. I heard that back in the seventies and never really understood it. I love them both with equal enthusiasm. But when it comes to the Stones and the Beatles now there's some fuel for the fire. The Stones had always been the high water mark of every garage band in America but seeings how I believed that the Stones quickly became a 'studio' band in their long and storied career, I could not help but notice how virtually EVERY bar band that ever played a Stones tune was able to do so much better than the Stones did live. I still do or did till I finally (almost begrudgingly) purchased this for myself this Christmas. I recall reading the plans for this release back when Wyman quit the Stones in 94 but then no movie, nothing. I thought perhaps they did some MTV deal and would appear on 'Unplugged' and that didn't happen either. Then I thought they probably couldn't handle the idea of playing that 'Close-To-The-Cuff' anymore as their warts would show up. Fast forward to 'Shine A Light' and sure enough I thought, they had played past their prime. So in an effort to locate the point 'Live' where their prime was, I bought this. I am so glad I did because the quality of this for a LIVE Stones recording just blew me away. I still have never found out why the movie was never released after it was made, but in so doing they also did a new release of the songs themselves, (as opposed to the first CD which I have still not listened to). So I will still look at the very old live disks to see the Mick Taylor performances and perhaps add a couple of those gems to my collection but the versions of Miss You, Midnight Rambler, and Gimme Shelter are worth the price of the CD by itself. The DVD just sums up Kieth Richards narration that, ""There's no such thing as 'Unplugged'"". If one is looking for an actual serious live performance of the Stones classics, this is it! Buy it, and play it over and over again because unlike the Stones, this never gets old.  ~Mark~",1483142400,6,2198,4.309178743961352
3508402,5,B001CC7GRA,As a serious Stones fan. I am so glad that I bought this. Contains three full concert video's of shows that I no longer find on a you tube as well a documentary disc. The photo booklet is cool too. And I have downloaded the C.D to Itunes.,1481155200,,238,3.9791666666666665

3508404,5,B001CC7GRA,"INCREDIBLE!!! As a die hard Stones Fan, I have collected bootlegs of the Stones and back a few years ago I posted a video on YouTube of me  asking the question ""When will the Stones ever officially release this bootleg stuff!?"" Well since 2010 The Stones have put out a number of awesome releases from Ladies and Gentlemen to all the From The Vault releases and now to this Gem, Totally Stripped!!! I am absolutely beyond Happy with this Super Deluxe Version! The sound and footage on all of the DVDs are amazingly incredible! I absolutley love it!! The CD kicks too but has nothing on the DVD's!

3508410,5,B001CC7GRA,"I can't stomach most recent tours' DVD's because of Mick's frowning and prancing about the stage and trying to reach the last row of the arena, so this is a refreshing collection of shows, as he's considerably toned down. He even plays some credible guitar here and there. The setlists vary quite a bit, which is wonderful. Lots of ""Exile..."" songs  always a great thing. On the studio DVD, to see Keith in the studio with an acoustic guitar... you rediscover what a truly great musician he can be.",1475625600,,498,4.595505617977528

3508413,5,B001CC7GRA,"Loved it. The movie is great. The 3 complete shows are outstanding, but the Brixton Academy show they are absolutely on fire! Keith is particularly on top of his game at that show. The CD is almost totally different than the CD released originally. The book has interesting text, but is really mostly nice stills from the shows.
The documentary has a scene of Mick, Keith, Bernard and Chuck singing Tumbling Dice backstage with just Chuck on piano that is awesome!
Nicely packaged as essentially an LP sized book.
All this and Lisa Fischer too!",1474675200,,544,4.7368421052631575
3508414,5,B001CC7GRA,"This is an excellent archival release.  As far as I am concerned it is the best one released to date. The Stones sound great in a small place and apparently liked doing the shows enough to incorporate theaters in later tours. The main issue is where you are in collecting Stones music and what is the best option for you to purchase this music.  If all you want is a single disc and don't want the documentary then go with the original Stripped that was released in 1995, which includes six songs from these shows and eight studio recordings of which one, Little Baby, is not available on any other Stones albums as of this writing.  If you either have the original Stripped cd or want more of the live music from the shows but don't want to spend a lot of money then get the release of the single cd with the documentary,  The cd contains nothing but songs from the shows and the documentary, among other things, shows them recording some of the studio versions included in the original cd.  If you can afford the box set then by all means go for it. I seriously doubt you will be disappointed.

A number of reviewers mentioned purchasing the box set on Amazon UK because it is cheaper.  That's what I did.  The UK purchase price includes a 20% VAT tax that we do not have to pay because the retailer does not have to collect the tax on sales to the US.  Then you add in the international freight and your credit card gets charged in dollars.  In my case I saved over 40%. I received the dvd box set in a week and it played great.  One caveat is that not all European dvds work on US players.  This one does.

Hope this review helps you decide whether or what to buy.",1474675200,,1668,4.257142857142857

3508418,5,B001CC7GRA,"Oh, man, what a great set of concerts.  The Gimme Shelter in Amsterdam, alone, is worth the cost of the whole set.  Lisa Fischer is in her prime, and Mick still has most of his vocal range.  The selections are awesome...lots of stuff from Exile on Main Street (in my opinion their greatest album ever).  As usual, the guitar work is outstanding.  Ronnie even plays some slide.  The audiences are great, too.  They really know their Stones songs, and do a lot of sing-along.",1473811200,2,473,4.559523809523809

3508429,5,B001CC7GRA,"This is perhaps their best live DVD set.  The sound is very crisp, which is the result of both small venues and the producer, Don Was. It is not exactly the Stones unplugged, but it is toned down from their arena concerts.  There is very little duplication across the three fantastic concerts.  A fourth DVD also includes some new studio versions of songs such as Wild Horses and Spider and the Fly.",1469923200,,399,4.513888888888889

3508431,5,B001CC7GRA,"My favorite album by the Stones has always been Stripped. I was happy to see this come available. Keith does sing background on a number of tunes, and takes the lead on several songs. The 60 page hard cover book, with words and photos, was not expected but a nice addition. In addition to the CD and the documentary Blu-ray you get the 3 total shows. This is the one for Stones fans. if needed jewel boxes or DVD cases are available from Amazon or others. the book/holder is 11.25 inches square. the black & white photos were taken at the Amsterdam show 10 total and were featured on the original CD. the ones taken at the other shows are in color. 11 from each place. I liked the book which holds the disks fine. it will fit with other books or vinyl. The text is like extended liner notes.",1469491200,,791,4.28

3508434,4,B001CC7GRA,"I like the music, but I hate the box it came in. It's the size of an old Life magazine . Just a little smaller then a LP. I don't understand why they did the set like this. It will not fit on a shelf with any other CD's or Box Set. You have to find I different place to store it. The text is not very interesting and most of the pictures are in  black & white.

3508439,5,B001CC7GRA,"The Amsterdam show was great/fantastic. Probably one of my favorites only because they don't play Jumpin Jack Flash, Brown Sugar, Honky Tonk Woman or Satisfaction.  I know most Stones fans will think I'm crazy. But I love these guys (why do you think they call me Mick) and have seen them 9 times since the '78 Some Girls tour.  I know others have seen them more than that but I've grown tired of hearing these songs time and time again.  They have soooo many other great songs and I've complained they don't mix things up enough. When they regrouped for the Steel Wheels tour and then Voodoo Lounge, that did change some, but still not enough for me.  These stripped shows are what I was always hoping for.  True, some songs might not have sounded well or gone over well, but I still would rather hear Connection rather than Happy for the umteenth time.(Though it was cool to hear Keith sing it on his solo tour) They should have kept playing ""Like A Rolling Stone"" live, they did such a good job with it. (Plus Bob ""wrote it for them"" :)  And finally, hearing Its All Over Now was sooooo cool. (I was a big Faces fan and they did it also) Thats another song they could do.  But considering those last two are covers and not written by Mick and Keith could be a big reason why we don't hear them live repeatedly . I know they do other covers but they tend to use them once a tour and then move on to another one. I don't know, just my guess.",1469059200,3,1442,4.26007326007326
3508440,5,B001CC7GRA,"Probably the final album I initially bought at the time, since I wrote them off afterwards. They look and feel like they are treating these old songs like new. I'm old school Stones, seeing them in the 70's and collecting their stuff for years until Bill Wyman's exit. Street Fighting Man was the tune that I really loved hearing from this when the album came out. I bought the Stripped cd at the time, and enjoyed it. Now this comes out and I said to myself, I better get the super duper deluxe version since I enjoyed the cd so much because I wanted to see the concerts. I really enjoy Keith singing (badly) Connection, and I love the way they did it. All the shows are really great in my opinion. They all have their certain charm. As some other reviewers stated on here, Lisa Fisher nails the vocal on the Merry Clayton part in Gimme Shelter. I say the Stones are a business since the 70's, and this must be mere product to vend from their headquarters, but when diamonds like this show up, it's well worth it!  5 Stars!!!",1469059200,5,1026,4.34375

The DVDs are Region 0, which means they do indeed play on U.S. DVD/Blu-Ray players!  The Region 2 designation on Amazon's EU sites is incorrect.  The UK price is MUCH lower, and the shipping is reasonable and fast.  I would normally order Blu-Ray, but as the product description notes, these are Standard Definition video even on Blu-Ray, so there is presumably no difference in image quality between BR and DVD.  The footage was shot on 1990s TV cameras, before they had HDTV, so that makes sense.  The concert footage is indeed kind of fuzzy and dimly-lit by today's standards, and it's not widescreen--so it's like watching an old episode of Austin City Limits.  But the vitality of the shows makes for some thrilling viewing nonetheless.",1465862400,6,835,4.7172413793103445
3508468,5,B001CC7GRA,"This release is arguably one of the best Stones products to surface in many a year. Yes, the Stones have released many different CD/DVD packages/compilations to the public of live material chronicling their long career whether it be Four Flicks, Biggest Bang, Some Girls Live in Texas, Sweet Summer Sun and other assorted shows from the vaults-some of these releases seeming redundant (been there, done that already) and just a cash grab. However, as a long time Stones fan, this newest collection is essential. We are fortunate to be treated to a series of live gigs at smaller, more intimate venues at locations in Paris, London, and Amsterdam that were professionally shot during the Stones Voodoo Lounge trek that feature just the band minus the usual theatrics and pyrotechniques featured in huge stadium shows. The Stones were drawing from MTV's Unplugged series and filmed these shows to represent a ""stripped down"" presentation of their material. This is just the Stones up close and personal, relying on their musical abilities to deliver the goods (and they do), playing more rare, deep and/or obscure cuts (Spider & the Fly, Down in the Bottom, Love In Vain, Shine a Light, etc) not normally featured on the Voodoo Lounge tour. Although many may argue that today's Stones may not look and play like the Stones of old, these shows (1995) capture a moment in time when the 'boyz still had it. Why they waited so long to release this is a mystery. My favorite of the bunch: The Paradiso show in Amsterdam is worth the price of admission alone. Seriously, one of the best Stones packages to see the light of day. For Stones fans (especially of the Ronnie Wood era), it doesn't get any better than this. Highly recommended.",1465603200,39,1729,4.844594594594595

3508470,5,B001CC7GRA,"One of the best live Stones series of concerts released in the past few years. The smaller settings for the Stripped shows embody an energy not found on some of the From the Vault Releases.
The real value of this set is in the set lists that are not the usual Stones greatest hits, which are amazing performances that span the best album cuts of their career. Moreover, there is no flash in the live shows...just the band, the two back-up singers, and the 3-piece brass section comprise some of the best performances I've ever seen from Rolling Stones live releases. The band is really into the show and the only real drawback is that the DVDS aren't readily available as CDs. Worth the price for any fan.
PS, the CD included is not the same track listing as the original ""Totally Stripped"" release and includes tracks other tracks from the club shows; a companion piece that will rock your socks off...!",1465603200,11,904,4.58641975308642

I first watched the documentary & I thought that was great , but then I watched the concerts & all I could say was WOW ! The Olympia show is already being labeled as being one of the ten best Stones concerts of all time !!!! If you are a Stones fan this set is a must have ",1465516800,7,441,3.6914893617021276
3508472,5,B001CC7GRA,"Full disclosure: I am  a HUGE Rolling Stones fan and I purchase every album, dvd or concert ticket the day it's released.
I've seen the band over 40 times, so, I'm pretty good at knowing a good Stones show or not.
These shows are special. Up until that point in 1995, the band pretty much played in stadiums and played pretty much the same songs, night in and night out.
I'd seen seven shows in 1994 while they played in North America. The setlist was pretty predictable and for the most part, the band played well.
When I heard that the band was going to play theater shows in Europe for 95, I was excited for the fans.(And myself)
The Stones didn't disappoint, either. They performed songs they'd NEVER played live before.
Bob Dylan's ""Like A Rolling Stone"" was a huge surprise for die hard Stones fans.
""Shine A Light"" from Exile On Main Street made its live debut.
Acoustic versions of ""Beast Of Burden"" and ""Wild Horses"" showed how great these songs really are, and more importantly, how good the band was at that time and continues to be.
If you're looking for hits and classics, they're all performed on this box set, too.
""Jumping Jack Flash"" particularly from the London show, just soared.
I got chills down my spine as I watched it and I've heard that song hundreds, if not thousands of times. It was like hearing it for the first time, again!
You could tell the band enjoyed playing for the smaller crowds and it showed up in their performances.
The sound mix is excellent on my 5.1 system. You can even hear Mick's guitar playing!
The only complaint I have is that only SD was available in 1995. There were no HD TV's or BluRay players available. It was for that reason I ordered the DVD version of this box set. The BluRays are in SD as well, no real inprovement in picture quality.
Remember, there was no YouTube or Twitter in 1995.
If I were at that show and I had to give a review in 140 characters or less?

@RollingStonesParadiso Still the best rock n roll band in the world! And they know it!",1465430400,11,2011,4.4177897574123985
3508473,5,B001CC7GRA,"The Deluxe Limited Edition of Totally Stripped is worth the extra bucks. The only unfortunate detail is that it's not available in Blu-Ray. I doubt that would have made a difference for video that was shot in 1995, but it might have improved the audio. Not that the audio on the DVDs are bad, but you know the Blu-Ray audio is going to be slightly better.

Documentary - This is NOT the same as the documentary that was aired on MTV and never seen again (except on bootlegs). This is a different edit and includes the entire backstage Tumbling Dice vocal warm-up with Mick, Keith, Chuck and Darryl. And Ronnie pokes his head in at the end. Lots of great interviews and full clips from the three theater show. One could make the case that all you might really need is the CD and single DVD/Blu-Ray edition, but then you'd miss the full shows of the three theater gigs.

CD - Only one track overlaps the original Stripped release, and all tracks are from the live theater shows. I wish there would have been more from the Tokyo studio sessions, and the duplicate track is Like A Rolling Stone. I guess that makes sense since it was the ""single"" from the original Stripped release. Sound is great, but you also get all of this on the DVDs.

Paradiso, Olympia, Brixton DVDs - Yep, it's all been bootlegged. But it sounds/looks like a bootleg. Here you get great video and sound. And yest the Brixton show really is as incendiary as everyone says it was.

Packaging - If you have the Sweet Summer Sun super deluxe then you are familiar with the book-style packaging. The discs are housed in slots on the inside front and back covers. The book is nice and mostly photos. There is some text but it's really more like a picture book to look at when you listen to the CD. The photos are great and some have been unseen until now.

If there is any one late edition Stones release that validates the power of this band, Totally Stripped is it. The Stones had just finished up the incredibly successful Voodoo Lounge Tour and were firing on all cylinders. The studio footage is a treasure, and the intimate atmosphere of the theater shows confines Jagger just enough that he actually concentrates on singing instead of flailing around. Great performances abound on the concert DVDs. If you're a collector, you've already decided to buy this.",1465430400,9,2329,4.562200956937799
3508474,5,B001CC7GRA,"As a collector and Stones fan, I am very pleased with this set. Some of the criticisms that have been leveled are appropriate - the price, the video quality. I suggest that several of the recent series of live releases have flaws that can be taken one way or the other, but, for me, I love The Stones and am glad to have access to all of these releases.

I ordered this on May 31st and received it on June 4th as it was fulfilled out of a warehouse less than 100 miles away.

I find the package appropriate for the theme of this release, nothing overly spectacular; nicely done, though. The video quality is what it is, quite good overall with some missteps and/or flaws, in my opinion, in the filming. None of the video concerts are in widescreen. In the end, it's the music for me. The audio portion of each video, as well as the CD, is excellent.

I can't get enough even if I've heard these songs on a variety of releases and seen The Stones myself over and over. The CD sounds great at home and in the car. Very nicely done. Yes, I won't be giving up the original 'Stripped' CD release.

So, all in all, I think this is a release for Stones fans who want everything or as much of their live performances as they can get.",1465344000,13,1225,4.2

3508476,5,B001CC7GRA,"worth every penny. Stones are in great form. The small stages bring out great interaction within the band members. My two main points...Keith singing the high harmonies like he used to. I notice he does not sing them anymore...hey, if I was his age I can't fault that now, but these discs are a pleasure just for that. Also, one word for Lisa Fischer - hot! Mick does a great job, singing and adding rhythm guitar. Ronnie gets sloppy sometimes but that's Ronnie, still love his playing. Bobby Keyes is great with his solos, looks like he had cleaned up for these shows. Chuck Leavell does a good job on keyboards as usual, and shows why Mick relies on him a lot now. And, of course, timeless Charlie Watts. He has so much energy I will always wonder at his amazing stamina. This is how the Stones should work now...smaller venues keeps them fresh. With all the loss the music world has suffered in the last 12 months, I cherish this set. You will too, so lay out the cash for this. I really truly hope Stones fans don't look at this as a cash grab by the World's Greatest Rock 'n' Roll band. You will love this set like I do.",1465257600,19,1125,4.311320754716981
3508477,2,B001CC7GRA,"I love the Stones and have bought all of the vault series discs so far.  i was really looking forward to this one too, but it should have been titled ""Totally Ripped Off"".  Given the sub-par video quality of the SD-Bluray discs, there's no reason all of the content here couldn't have fit on one dual-layer disc.  Oh wait, the reason is so they can charge us upwards of a benjamin to get this.  The book is lackluster and forgettable and the discs contain nothing new.  No new interviews or anything.  The least they could have done is to include the Voodoo Lounge concert that was released on video back in the day.  I'm sure that will come out eventually and at a premium price as well.

3508481,5,B001CC7GRA,"Easily some of the best post-Wyman footage ever captured.  This contents here have been ""holy grail"" level material for years among longtime collectors.  The band is in excellent form and there is very little to not like about this set:  the Stones playing small club/theaters, playing huge chunks of never-before-played songs and also devoting a portion of the show to acoustic stripped down selections.  There are so many highlights throughout the set:  Mick, Keith, Bernard Fowler and Chuck Levall singing ""Tumbling Dice"" during an pre-show warmup, the acoustic version of ""Beast of Burden"" from the Paradiso show, the absolutely manic version of ""All Down The Line"" and the first ever performances of ""Shine A Light.""  Too many to mention.  Any fan of the band will find many hours of enjoyment from this set.

One note: don't get rid of your original ""Stripped"" album.  A lot of the songs on there are not duplicated here.  This set acts as a companion piece to that and by no means replaces it.  Keep both.

I waited a very long time for this set to come together.  It was worth the wait.  This set will go down as one of the best documents to prove that The Rolling Stones are truly the world's greatest rock and roll band.",1465084800,38,1230,4.686915887850467
