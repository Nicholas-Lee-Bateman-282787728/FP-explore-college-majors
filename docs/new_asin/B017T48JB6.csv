This is really a great series, following the lives of a group of Polish troops who parachutist into German occupied Poland during he Second World War.  The series follows these troops and their loved ones as they both fight against the occupying German forces and to simply fight to keep themselves and their loved ones safe.

The series goes from 1941 through 1945 with the burgeoning occupation of Poland by the Soviets and communists.  The box set includes all 7 series (plus includes a double deck of special play cards as an added bonus.)  This includes all 6 seasons of the original show and then then 7th season known as Czas Honoru: Powstanie (in English: Time of Honor: Uprising) a special season featuring the cast during the 1944 Warsaw Uprising.

The discs are good and have English subtitles.  The subtitles are generally good, though at some season there are the occasionally misspelled word, but that really does not distract from the drama of the series.  The program generally does a good job hitting various aspects of life under the war.  This is an amazing series that should really have a broader appeal.",1521590400,2,1233,4.751173708920188
