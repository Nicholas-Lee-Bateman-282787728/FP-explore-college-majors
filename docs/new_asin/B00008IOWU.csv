1848053,5,B00008IOWU,"It will keep you thoroughly involved. I felt the strongest performance was Malkovich, even though I do not particularly like him in any role. He made this story carry the tension and suspense that another actor could not have generated. He was ideal for the part.
I enjoyed the story and felt it was quite entertaining. I have been concerned that many reviewers have stated it is not a factual account. I do look to A&E for honest productions and have come to trust them. I would hate to learn that they breached that trust in honest film production.
If what you want is a strong story that provides all the elements: love, war, action, drama, suspense, and several unexpected twists, then you cannot go wrong with this one. It does deliver the ""E"" portion of A&E.",1054512000,2,764,4.583941605839416
1848054,2,B00008IOWU,I really looked forward to this. However it left me disappointed. The problem is the person who plays Napoleon.

The actor playing him was not appealing. The sets were lavish and the one scene showing the creation of the coronation painting was very nice but the whole thing just left me cold. It seems like a lot of effort went into making this film but somehow it just never came together.
Isabella Rosselini does a nice job playing Josephine as a ravaged by time coquette who is too old to play that game anymore but too in love not to try.

1848057,2,B00008IOWU,"This DVD really angered me. It could have been so good! With all the time, money, and effort that went into the making of this miniseries, with the great cast they assembled, you'd think that they could come up with something better than a poorly disguised hatchet-job on one of the most successful leaders in History.
Let me sum up how this DVD goes: Each military triumph that Napoleon enjoyed is brushed over and downplayed. His dramatic and unlikely rise to power was virtually ignored by the writers. Only the massive deaths, destruction, and negative aspects of Bonaparte's reign are focused on. Charges of nepotism, pride, ambition, greed, etc. are all fair accusations against Napoleon, but this miniseries goes overboard.
I simply cannot put into words how unfair this entire DVD is to Napoleon. He certainly was not a noble man in many instances, but at least give credit where credit is due. One of the greatest military minds in the history of civilization deserves MUCH, MUCH better!
The third disk of the DVD is the best of the bunch, as it features A&E features on Waterloo and Napoleon.  These specials salvage two stars for a DVD that would otherwise deserve one.

1848071,1,B00008IOWU,"I know almost nothing about Napoleon, but I do know a good movie when I see it, and this is not one. I didn't know Europeans could make movies this bad, but it rivals the worst that ever came out of Hollywood. It's like a six-hour marathon episode of Dallas. If Napoleon had been even 1% as boring and stupid as he is in this movie, no one would remember his name.

I can't stand John Malkovich, and I like Isabella Rossellini as a person but she's not much of an actor. I've loved some of the European actors in other movies, but I've never even heard of Christian Clavier and don't wonder why.

But what makes this so unbearably bad are the moronic writing and directing. Everybody talks and acts like they're in a 1980s American soap opera, not at all like real historical human beings or even like well-developed fictional characters.

Costumes and sets aren't enough to make me love a movie; there have to be believable characters behaving more or less like real human beings. Everybody in this one is as phony and stupid and annoying as J R Ewing.

This three-disc Collector's Edition would be a rip-off even if the movie had been good. The third DVD is only filler crap that's even worse than the movie itself.",1414281600,,1217,4.468468468468468

I'd recommend it as a rental for other history buffs or perhaps as a purchase for those wanting to obtain A&E's specials on the extras disc but I find it hard to believe that more extra footage couldn't be found to flesh out some of the scenes, that anamorphic widescreen wasn't used, an original French soundtrack wasn't available, or even a 5.1 soundtrack since battle scenes are a great way to show off that home theatre.

1848077,3,B00008IOWU,"Viewing the 6-hour A&E miniseries on Napoleon's I was wandering for whom it was made? After a while I was trying
To convince myself that it was made for general public, and every viewer interested or curious can purchase it. As a
Result only knowledgable viewers in Napoleon's history will be able to understand what's going on. Many newcomers
Without any historical background will ask a simple question :  From where this man Napoleon come from and who is he? For this reason the chronology was poorly done. Why the producers start Napoleon story in the year 1796? If. The producers could not effort, or were not willing to include Napoleon's schoolboy days at Brienne and show his snow ball battles, they should have started his biography with the Siege of Toulon in 1793 in  which the 23 years old
Captain , scored a great victory and after the battle was promoted to the rank of General. The victory at Toulon made the name Bonaparte famous and Paul J.N. Barras ( 1755-1829) Main executive leader of the Directory regime
Of 1795-1799 remember the name of general Bonaparte and appoint him the general of interior army,and his appointment lead to eventual suppression of the Paris uprising in 1795 .Shortly after Bonaparte met Josephine The
Beauharnais mother of two children , Eugene and Hortense, mistress of Barras , she was one of Ravishingly
Beautiful. Consequently on March 9, 1796 they were married in a civil The honeymoon was brief , because two days
Later Bonaparte was on his way to the Italian border .He was just been appointed Commander in- Chief of the
French Army in Italy. I understand that in six hours time only that much could be included, but the producers could
Have done much better to include more meaningful battles. After Arcola ,Austerlitz and Jena ,they should have
Omitted Eylau ,a bloody battle without results for eather side, and possibly Aspern- Esling . Instead they should
Friedland a decisive Napoleon's victory forcing Tsar Alexander to request peace treaty and a meeting with Napoleon
At Tilsit , and another important Napoleon's  victory at Wagram in 1809  against Austria. About the Russian  Campaign in1812 . Dr. Alnatol Lewicki in his famous History of Poland and the Russian Campaign of1812 writes the following information. Napoleon invaded Russia with the Great Army of 647.000 in 1812 . In the most bloody battle
Near the village of Borodino , the Russian Army under the command of Marshal Kutusov lost 52.000 while Napoleon
Lost 28.000 .The victory belong to Napoleon and the road to Moscow stand open, but his Army of only 95.000 was
In terrible shape. David G. Chandler in his epic The Campaigns of Napoleon writes little different: The Russian Army
At Borodino lost 44.000 while Napoleon lost 30.000 . It difficult to know which figures are right. Also very important
Was to include the 3 day Battle near Leipzig in 1913 in which Napoleon's defeat was his downfall not the Russian Campaign. That much for the changes. The costumes are excellent ,so is generally also the acting. Clavier looks
And acts well in the role of Napoleon ,but who wants to see the most authentic Napoleon I recommend the Abel
Gance 's Napoleon a silent movie which has in Albert Dieudonne the best actor in the the role of Napoleon I have ever seen. Believe me ,I have seen them all. The film cover accurately all event of the young Bonaparte until the age of 26 that means until 1796 and his appointment as general in Chief of the French Army in Italy. Unfortunatelly Abel
Gance due to financial reasons could not continue any further. Dieudonne as Napoleon Exercice great power and
Authorityas no other actor ever did . It is a great movie despite being silent. Very highly recommended.

1848084,3,B00008IOWU,"I admit that I am only half way through the lst disc and am wondering if I'll be able to make it through the whole thing. This man simply lacks the charisma and commanding presence that is required for the role of Napoleon. He looks disturbingly like Dustin Hoffman and he borders on the ridiculous.  And, Isabel just looks like an old, fat Italian housewife.  Has anybody read enough history to know that Josephine had such bad teeth that she never smiled enough to show them. However, they do present her as the slut she was earlier in their relationship. It is way too gory too.  One does not need to see civilians slaughtered in the streets in order to believe that order was restored.  The Egyptian scenes were just confusing then he shows up back in Paris all triumphant - WHY?  Well, they didn't have t.v. reporters at wars back then, did they. A much better pairing of Napoleon and Josephine is in the movie ""Desiree"" with Marlon Brando and Merle Oberon. A far superior movie is ""Napoleon and Josephine""  with Armand Asante and Jacqueline Bisset. Asante is as good a Napoleon as it is possible to be and Bisset is a much better actress than I ever thought she was prior to seeing this. She is perfect in the role. NOTE:  ON A RAINY DAY I watched the rest of this later version. It didn't get any better. Too many battles, too much gore and not nearly enough explanation about which battle was being fought and why then all of a sudden Napoleon is back in Paris leaving, I assume, all the dead and wounded just lying there. One thing I liked was near the end when he was accused of having children as an army and it was obvious from looking at them that they were, indeed, children.  Every time I've been in Paris and stood looking down on his coffin at the Invalides I always think to myself ""why on earth are they honoring the worst thing that ever happened to France"" especially considering the fact that he wasn't even French. NOTE: IF YOU ARE GOING TO LOOK AT THIS MOVIE, WATCH THE 3RD DISC OF SPECIAL FEATURES FIRST.

1848092,1,B00008IOWU,"Was so looking forward to watching this series. I was profoundly disappointed. If you have any background in the life of Napoleon or this exciting, complex period of history, this effort at portraying either is tedious and thin--a thoroughly exasperating experience. Peculiar casting, lackluster direction, phoned-in performances, and confusing editing all work against it.  But the sloppy attention to accuracy trumps even this. Military historians will throw their hands up at the amateurish re-enactments of famous battles, or the complete misconception of tactics or the nature of combat during this period. But political historians will shake their heads at the simple-minded narrative of politics and what was going on at the time. One wonders who their military and historical advisers were, or if they even listened to them.

A comment now about the casting: Christian Clavier was cast in the eponymous role, but it was, aside from the fact that he is short and looks (with the right hat) vaguely like Napoleon (an old Napoleon--who was in his twenties and thirties during much of this time), an odd choice. A veteran comic actor, he read his lines woodenly and with such a thick accent (in the English version) that it was difficult to understand him. I found I had to rewind quite a few times to try and hear what he was trying to say. This was to be contrasted with all the North American accents, which felt jarring and out of place. Even though Isabella Rosselini is a magnificent actress, it was also odd to cast her as Josephine. Though Josephine was older than Napoleon, she was not that old and the closeup photography and harsh lighting were not flattering. It was sad to watch these two venerable actors trying to play characters who were decades younger--the love scenes between them were laughable and embarrassing. John Malkovich, as Talleyrand, looked just bored throughout, as if he didn't know what his role was. In one pointless and long scene, in which he was sleeping in a carriage, I thought maybe he was actually sleeping while the director tried to decide what he wanted to do.

Altogether, not really worth the six hours to sit through. I was sad afterwards, having had such hopes for this.",1351900800,3,2222,4.92
1848093,3,B00008IOWU,"I have a lot of books and films on Napoleon. He has fascinated me for years.  I found this film rather disappointing, although the settings and costumes were wonderful.  It was a pity they didn't use two actors to play Napoleon when firstly young and dashing, and later rather older and more portly. Instead Christian Clavier was older and  portly all the way through, and with all the camera focus on his mad-eye looks, he made Napoleon out to be quite a weirdo. Then Josephine - very matronly and dull - if she was as Rossellini played her it is surprising he ever fell for her in the first place. In his day, Napoleon, while only about 5ft 6ins, was not so much remarkably shorter than most men of his time, but this film made him out to be one of the seven dwarves. Everyone in his family was way taller, and he didn't resemble any of them, including his mother.  His wife was a whale in comparison if you accept the portrayal. I have always thought John Malkovich was overrated, and he proved that true here. If he is supposed to be an actor, can't he at least try to speak like a French man rather than an American when portraying someone French?  He was wooden and lifeless. But you couldn't describe Clavier as poor Napoleon as lifeless in this film. He was frenetically racing about, eyes darting madly, and galloping from what seemed like one disaster to another.  It was almost funny to watch because he seemed all the time to be racing from room to room, country to country, arms waving orders being barked on the way. The way his campaigns were portrayed in the film you wondered why he was ever described as a military genius at all - this film merely depicted a lot of death and destruction, but not much in the cunning victory stakes.  Likewise there was the odd mention of the many great improvements Napoleon made to France after the Revolution. Things like the legal system, architecture, education, art etc were mentioned in passing only despite the fact many of his reforms and structures remain today.  All in all, there was too much crammed in to too little time, rather like his reign I expect, and the end result was rather frustrating and disjointed from an historical perspective.",1351382400,2,2207,4.555555555555555

This miniseries has a strong French flavour and point of view.  The casting, much of it decided by Depardieu who even had his own son play one of Napoleon soldiers, is exceptional:  Isabella Rosellini as Josephine; Gerard Depardieu as Fouche; John Malkovitch as Talleyrand; all deliver astounding performances in amazing settings.  My only comment is that Christian Clavier, the actor selected to play Napoleon, is too calm and collected and fails to depict Napoleon as a mass of boundless energy and motion, the true ectomorph that was Napoleon.  But he still delivers a very creditable, intense performance.  A good balance of Napoleon's personal and military life nicely intertwined: the story of a brilliant military hero at the mercy of his love for Josephine--initially an attraction for her many high placed social contacts and her womanly charms--as well as his very demanding, power hungry, large immediate family.  A very well done series that attempts and delivers a lot.  Well worth watching more than once.",1351296000,3,1238,6.162790697674419
1848095,3,B00008IOWU,"After reading other reviews I purchased this mini-series thinking that it will be a great overview for someone who knows next to nothing about Napoleon - me !  Wrong !  First of all, it starts after he has already reached high military rank - no background on his ancestory, upbringing, or early military career.  In addition, my impression is that he was a brilliant military commander, but if you watch this mini-series you think he lost every battle.  No hint of what made him a ""great general"".  On the plus side, acting very very good, good cinematography, moves along pretty good.  One suggestion, watch the extra ""Napoleon and Wellington"" before watching the actual mini-series.  You get more background material.",1332720000,2,720,5.0
1848096,5,B00008IOWU,"I was half-expecting a plodding historical biopic but this production is anything but routine. ""Napoleon"" is visually stunning, reminiscent at its best of David Lean and Stanley Kubrick, with an intelligent and unpredictable screenplay as well as some excellent understated acting. It's also historically about as accurate as television history ever is with barely any descents into the usual telehistorical bathos and ""improvements"" on history. For that reason, some may find it boring.

Visually, ""Napoleon"" is sublime. In this it's helped by the beauty of the architecture, furniture, and costumes of the period. Even bearing in mind these advantages, the cinematographer does a startling job of parading one memorable image after another. The battle scenes are simply extraordinary: I was constantly reminded of ""Barry Lyndon"" in its seemingly authentic depiction of every aspect of the period. The coronation scene is remarkably like the famous painting by David, the meeting of the two emperors on the barge at Tilsit is captured in seemingly lifelike form until it's revealed (very much reminiscent of Kubrick) to be a painting of the scene as the camera draws back. But these are only two out of hundreds of breathtaking scenes. There is no hint of a television budget; it all looks extremely expensive.

The script is pithy and aphoristic, in keeping with Napoleon's own verbal style. It's also completely devoid of the cant of most modern screenplays; for that reason, some might find it lacking in feeling and drama. Likewise, the acting is restrained and subtle; in the title role, Christian Clavier never overplays or struggles to suggest a ""titanic"" historical figure. He allows the mystery of Napoleon to faintly register but no more than this. There is no quasi-romantic agonizing anywhere to be seen. Of course, if you're after ""insight"" into what made Napoleon ""tick"" or even to get a Rosebud-style ""explanation"" for his actions you're going to be disappointed by this series. It's opaque about motivation, merely presenting the things that happened with visual elegance and verbal wit.

My only caveat: in a rare deviation from historical accuracy, Napoleon is portrayed as way below average height - as the popular image of him has it. In reality, he was 5'7"", medium-height for men of the period. The ""Napoleon Complex"" dies hard.",1316476800,3,2351,5.214285714285714
1848097,5,B00008IOWU,"First, NO ONE can make a mini-series or even a 40-hour epic capturing all the complexities of Napoleon and his era.  This work quite sucessfully attempts to distill the vast gist of all that complexity into only 6 hours and does a good job of blending the highlights of his great achievements, which are numerous:
1) rapidly spreading the French notion of ""Liberty, Equality and Fraternity"" throughout Europe (with the notable exception of Russia) to bring down the medieval monarchies in relatively short order in the ensuing half century in all Europe, exploiting the ""Age of Reason"" and effectively gutting the values of ""inherited nobility and aristocracy"" by the sheer audacity of a Corsican peasant crowning himself (in the Pope's presence) as Holy Roman Emperor (and cleverly restoring France to Catholicism in the process),
2) defending, preserving and consolidating France's new and quite vulnerable revolutionary government (precipitated by the American Revolution while incorporating the essence of the latter's notions of a republic) while the adjacent monarchies tried to exploit France's real and perceived weaknesses to restore the monarchy,
3) capturing the genius of his military, scientific, political, legal, and philanthropic prowess and mind,
4) creating the unintended consequences of a) breaking the back of the Spanish colonial hold on the Americas and much of the Far East, b) both cementing the British spirit in its naval power and colonial ambitions while sowing the seeds for its ultimate demise, and c) allowing the United States to develop during its infancy (Louisana Purchase, etc) without European intervention that probably would otherwise have occured,
5) suffering the devastating impact of the fundamentally flawed Russian campaign in 1812 which brought his power to an abrupt end,
6) accomplishing the astounding phoenix of his short-lived restoration to power during ""the 100 days"" due to his energetic charisma,
7) capturing his need to always be doing something grand, which when deprived led to his early physical demise, and
8) affirming France's well-founded devotion to its best leader since Louis XIV (the Sun King) and Charlemagne.

The series script, direction, and actors do a great job in each role, and Clavier does a brilliant job of showing all the elements that must have existed in Napoleon's complex personality as it developed, as do Malkovich as Tallyrand, Depardieu as Fouchet, Rossellini as Josephine, and the scores of others who played Caulaincourt, Ney, Murat, Maret, Muiron, Davout, Duroc, Russia's Alexander, etc.  To cover all these bases it must necessarily skip over all the key British naval engagements at Nile, Copenhagen, Trafagar (""Nelson, Nelson who is this Nelson? He is no one!"") and Lissa, and little to no attention is almost justifiably paid to Wellesley in either Portugal or Waterloo.  The focus here after all is Napoleon himself...and this series does an excellent job of detailing his likely personality, thoughts, and capturing the essentials of his far reaching achievements.

This is a great piece of work - the settings and costumes authentic, and it strikes a good balance between those who expect fast-paced grand action versus ""boring"" but keenly astute and leveraging minutia, which ultimately have great import.

Had I not known about Napoleon aforehand I would have commented to myself, while watching it, ""what the heck is going on"". It developes incredibly poorly. There is just no ""rhyme or reason"" to it. It just does a terrible job of portraying Napoleons rise from obscurity to Emporership. It does so in the most nondescript way imaginable.

There is only one high point to this miniseries and that was the costumes - quite good, even remarkably good. I am really not a very critical person, in fact I am wax quite sanguine most all of the time but this was just so motivatingly weak I felt compelled to speak.

1848109,1,B00008IOWU,"This series is called a ""Super Production"". But the inferiority of Directing technique and Directing talent between Yves Simoneau and Spielberg & Hanks is abysmal. To deserve a 5 star this series would have to be as good or better than Band of Brothers, or Saving Private Ryan. Or better than the 1970 film Waterloo, with Rod Steiger, Christopher Plummer, Orson Welles, and Jack Hawkins.
The acting is sometimes atrocious, some of the secondary characters just ""say"" their lines, they don't act. Christian Clavier as Napoleon is not convincing, he lacks the ""Esprit"", the Rage, the Drive the real Bonaparte had. He just acts, does not wear the whole personality of Bonaparte.
The battle scenes are horrendous, soldiers just throw their arms and ""die"" - their Special Effects guy is still in the 1950's. Compare to the battle scenes in Band of Brothers and Saving Private Ryan, and the gulf is absolutely enormous.
The sequence of scenes is also loosely tied - here I have to admit it is not the Director's fault but the Producer's - Napoleon's life should NEVER be tried to be shown in 4 hours, the man is so complex, his life so full of adventures, of ups and downs, of heroism and crookery (he brought back from Italy 248 carriages full of works of art to the Louvre, later taken back after his defeat at Waterloo). His life should be told in not less than a Band of Brothers length - 16 to 20 hours.
But even comparing it to WATERLOO the 1970 film it is much inferior. Rod Steiger is a real Napoleon, and C. Plummer excels in Wellington - if you want to feel Napoleon and his people, if you want to see literally thousands and thousands of extras in the battlefield, with helicopter taikes showing the battleground, go see Waterloo.
On the ""Army"", again this production is shallow, an ""Army"" is represented by 20 or 30 soldiers, like in Egypt, on the dunes, you only see about two dozens of soldiers - for God's sake, in Bands of Brothers they just used computers and ""multiplied"" 20 soldiers to seem like thousands, and this technology was fully available when this series was filmed. So don't expect to see big Armies, lots of Extras, etc. It clearly is a cheap production, despite the comment of another Amazon client that they used 3 old carriages - ok, but how about soldiers? No Armies.
I honestly don't recommend buying this, it's a waste of money, doesn't grip you, doesn't explain the man, and surely doesn't put you in the past.

1848113,4,B00008IOWU,"Napoleon is a gorgeous, lush, and vibrant cinematic feast.  It's stunning to watch and reminds me of the earlier films filmed in full Technicolor.  The colors are vibrant and over-saturated at times.  It's definitely a visual masterpiece.

I bought my version from a Chinese seller on eBay. The version I watched is 8 hours in length and in English with a choice of dubbed Chinese audio or the English audio.  I've noticed that many reviewers have complained about the English dubbing on the English version and mention that one should purchase the French version with English subtitles.  I'm very confused about this, really, because my version wasn't dubbed English.  I realize they didn't film two entirely separate films, however the version I owned is filmed in original English and my husband and I agree we cannot possibly be mistaken about this.  We expected dubbing, but there was none.  Every single word was enunciated clearly and was absolutely in sync with the actors' mouths.  In addition, the English version I watched had no narration as some of these reviewers noted negatively.

I had never even heard of Christian Clavier prior to seeing this film.  He was incredible.  He seemed born to play this role. Clavier's face is amazingly expressive and he brings sensitivity and empathy to his part.  At times I got so caught up in the character and appeal of Napoleon that I found myself dreading the Moscow scenes and then the scenes at Waterloo-- futilely hoping for a different outcome.  I've learned that this actor usually plays more comedic roles and I'm surprised since he's wonderfully talented.

Joining Clavier is Anouk Aimee as Napoleon's mother, Isabella Rossellini as Josephine, John Malkovich as Talleyrand, and Gerard Depardieu as Joseph Fouche.  Anouk Aimee was perfect-- she definitely brought some depth to Letizia.  Both Isabella Rossellini and John Malkovich, though, were really horrible.  Josephine was known to be unfaithful and headstrong.  Here, we wonder what Napoleon actually sees in her! I don't want to blame this actress completely-- the script could have definitely used some improvement when it came to their interaction.  However, she brought no charm to the role of Josephine at all, I thought. Had Josephine been played by Marie Bumer (who played Napoleon's sister, Caroline), Mavie Hrbiger (Marie Louise of Austria, Napoleon's second wife), or Alexandra Maria Lara (Countess Marie Walewska), we would have all fallen in love with her.  But, instead, we were given a flat performance lacking in appeal.

John Malkovich played John Malkovich playing Talleyrand.  I don't think I've ever seen him play a role any differently than he played here.  Just like Jack Nicholson is known for being wild and erratic, John Malkovich is known for his flat affect and cold demeanor.  Additionally, it was a bit off-putting to have Talleyrand speak with absolutely no trace of a French accent, but there you have it.  It seemed as if the casting directors took no real note of this when casting- having the names that would draw both the French and the Americans must have been their main concern.  John Malkovich wasn't the only one who didn't even attempt to speak with an authentic accent.  Julien Sands, (who played Klemens Metternich, the ambassador from Austria) spoke the King's English.  Having accents match the characters would have been a bit more helpful, especially when dealing with unfamiliar characters from so many different countries.  And although Napoleon was actually from Corsica, his French accent didn't bother me at all.  He at least was French (even if originally from Corsica) and, really, he lived in France from age nine.  He very well could have lost his Corsican accent (his mother, however, was decidedly French).

So, some of that was a bit strange.  Napoleon's speech was beautiful but his own brothers sometimes sounded American.  His stepdaughter didn't sound French, his second wife didn't sound Austrian.  Where's Meryl Streep when you need her?

Everyone else was very good. Gerard Depardieu actually gets better with age. I've always liked him, but didn't understand his very wide appeal. He was excellent and stole the scenes when on screen.

As noted by so many other reviewers, there are obvious inaccuracies and omissions.  Thankfully, my husband (a historian) was right there next to me and I was able to ask him questions when things weren't clear.  The transitions from scene to scene are poor and fail to give the viewer ample background and information.  Some text would have been helpful between scenes-- especially either prior to major battles, for instance, or afterwards.

Still, with all the film's faults, it was enjoyable and informative (even if it could have been more informative), and Christian Clavier was superb.

As an addendum, when this film was made, there was only speculation regarding the cause of Napoleon's death.  He believed he was being poisoned and suffered horrible pain during his last months.  However, only last year it was discovered that Napoleon actually died of gastrointestinal bleeding due to gastric cancer.

Edited to add: I just confirmed that this version is NOT dubbed, despite reports to the contrary! In fact, the English version was dubbed into French, not the other way around.  And, although the French version has a longer running time than the narrated English version, this particular Chinese import version (with no narrator) runs the same length as the French version.",1205971200,33,5505,5.111982082866741

I had this same thought throughout the entire film.  You will be in heaven for 6 hours if you love extremely detailed period design & costumes (here most, possibly all - I can't remember - were filmed in the historically correct chateaux & palaces).  If you adore fabulous 18th & early 19th century French interiors, which I am sadly obsessed with, then you will absolutely be entranced.  It was all executed so incredibly well down to every last detail.

The acting in the film was magnificent.  Isabella Rossellini was incredibly charming as the character of Josephine.  This was by far the best role that I've ever seen her play.  Christian Clavier was so charming I developed a bit of a crush on him by the end of the movie.  John Malkovich, was extremely convincing and played his role absolutely beautifully as well.  I consider him to be one of the few (if not the best) great actors of this age.  Gerard Depardieu played his role wonderfully.  If you were to read a novel with a character similar to Napoleon  you wouldn't believe it to be possible for someone to have had such a productive life in the short amount of time spent on earth.

Which is a little inappropriate, since the real Napoleone de Buonaparte was a Corsican of Italian decent, and never learned to speak French without a distinct Italian accent, let alone write it properly.

Still, it's not Clavier's fault that this 2002 mini series ends up a three-star experience. The script simply isn't very good, and a lot of people are bound to wonder what the big deal was with this guy Napoleon. Why were his soldiers so fond of him? Why did 99% of French voters elect him as their emperor? This tepid and seriously underdeveloped version of the Emperor doesn't seem likely to have inspired that kind of admiration, and you never come close to learning what makes him tick, either.
And why do they always have to portray him as a small man?! Napoleon Bonaparte was of completely normal height for a man born in the 18th century, and his nickname, ""the little corporal"", had nothing to do with his physical appearance.

The battle scenes are very much less than impressive...apparently money was short or something, so many potential highlights, like the famed battle of the Nile, are barely mentioned, and the battle scenes in general are, well, lousy. Napoleon commanded an army hundreds of thousands strong. This is a few hundred extras running around. And the armies' long marches are displayed in Discovery Channel-fashion, as a computer-generated arrow running across a computer-generated map. Honestly...

The talents of the great character actor John Malkovic are wasted on an odd, unsympathetic and socially awkward portrayal of the sublime (and very socially apt) diplomat Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Perigord. But Gerard Depardieu is very good as Joseph Fouche, duke of Otrante and minister of police, and British actor John Wood is subtle and memorable in his small role as Barnaba Chiaramonti, pope Pius VII.

Still, ""Napoleon"" remains a shallow affair on the whole. You never get to know, or care about, this dull and inconsistantly portrayed Emperor Napoleon, and you'll most likely end up asking yourself ""why the hell is this guy at war all the time? Who is he fighting, and why?"" Dunno. Well, yes, I'm sure you know why he was fighting ""all the time"", but the makers of this mini series either didn't know or didn't think it mattered. He just is.

By the way, ""Napoleon"" is not 480 minutes as stated on this page. It was shown in the US in a horribly mutilated three-hour version, but restored to its original six-hour France 2-glory for the DVD-issue. Six hours (sans commercials), not eight.

1848120,4,B00008IOWU,"First off, this is not a six part series!!  It may have been six parts in the French language edition, but this 3 disk set from A&E is not six parts, it is FOUR parts, each about 90 minutes long.  The four episodes are on the first two disks, the third disk is devoted to extras, such as two documentaries, one on the life of Napoleon and one on Napoleon and Wellington (there is substantial overlap between the two documentaries).

Christian Clavier is too old to play the young Napoleon (and remember that this man became sole ruler of France at age 35).  Isabella Rossalini is also much too old to play the young Josephine de Beauhernais, who was 32 when she met Napoleon, but she is a very fine actress and does a good job with the role.

Interestingly, the Battle of Lodi is depicted, but inexplicably made into a loss rather than a victory, which is strange because it was at Lodi that Napoleon became convinced he was chosen by destiny for great things.  Generally, the battles are not given much coverage, but staging Napoleonic-era battles has proven prohibitively expensive even for big-budget cinema, never mind television.  There are a few great scenes of Napoleon surrounded by his Old Guard, complete with bear-skin hats.  There is also a great scene of Murat leading a heavy cavalry charge (curaissiers with breastplates and helmuts) at the battle of Eylau.  (Think about what percentage of the Napoleonic-era European gross national product was plowed into military uniforms, considering that we cannot afford to reproduce very many of them today for purposes of Television or Motion Pictures).

The most puzzling ommission is the 1812 campaign in Russia; it was the disaster that doomed Napoleon, but it gets less than 5 minutes of screen time in this six-hour miniseries.

This TV (A&E) mini-series on DVD, based on the book ""Napoleon"" by Max Gallo, depicts the major life events of Napoleon Bonaparte (1769 to 1821) between the years 1795 and 1821.  You will discover his manipulation of power, his loves, seductions and betrayals, his interactions with his tightly knit and highly demanding family, and how he inspired his armies to achieve his conquests.

This is a four-part epic with each part of 90 minutes having twelve scenes.  The dates covered in each part are as follows:

(1) 1795 to 1800
(2) 1800 to 1807
(3) 1807 to 1812
(4) 1812 to 1821

Napoleon (Christian Clavier) is depicted quite well as a military leader. Due to his military prowess, he became First Consul of France in 1799 and became Emperor of the French in 1804.  His reign as Emperor lasted until his first abdication at the end of March, 1814.  We are shown how he came back to power again but was soon abdicated again at the end of June, 1815.

All battle scenes are exquisite and, as well, very realistic.  They show the organized battles that were fought during this time.

Napoleon is depicted as a human being also.  Napoleon's appreciation of his first wife Josephine (Isabella Rosselini), whom he married in 1796, is clearly shown throughout.  But since she was unable to give him an heir, he divorces her (they both agreed to this) and marries in 1810 the younger Marie-Louise.  Napoleon also had various lovers most notably Countess Marie Walewski.

This production had a cast of 150 actors.  Christian Clavier seems to have been born to portray Napoleon.  He capably carries the entire series.  Isabella Rosselini also gives a fine performance.  Also look for John Malkovich as Talleyrand, Napoleon's scheming political advisor.

The entire production is a visual feast (which is not surprising since this was an expensive European production of $46 million).  As I said, battle scenes are exquisite.  Costumes are rich in detail.  Cinematography is fantastic.  (Building interiors are especially photographed well.)

I felt, however, there were some problems.  First, the story (especially at first) can be difficult to follow (although I must admit, I was never completely lost).  Thus brief narrative blurbs for the sake of continuity would have been helpful.  Second, there was a failure to properly introduce Napoleon's large family and key military figures.  (It is in this respect, that I was sometimes lost completely.)  Lastly, since this was originally made for TV, there is a frequent fading to black (so commercials could be inserted).  I found this distracting.

I would thus recommend reading a brief biography of Napoleon's life before viewing this movie.  Doing this will solve the first two problems mentioned above and so increase your viewing enjoyment.  I would also recommend that you turn on the English subtitles.

I must emphasize that this movie does not cover all the details of Napoleon's life during the time span indicated.  Such a movie would be much, much longer.  But for what it does cover, I felt it did a good job.  (Purists would probably disagree with me.)

Finally, the DVD is perfect in picture and sound quality.  There are 150 minutes of extras.

In conclusion, if you want to get to know about some of fascinating life of ""The Little Corporal,"" then you must view this movie!!

1848124,5,B00008IOWU,"THE FILM:

""Napoleon"" is an epic look at the life of one of the greatest military geniuses in history. While there are some minor problems with historical accuracy, the film is a thoughtfully-produced and well-written docu-drama on the life of Napoleon Bonaparte, the man whose will was forced upon the continent of Eurpoe.

Christian Clavier does an exceptional job in his portrayal of Napoleon, never playing him as a one-dimensional character. The supporting cast (including Isabella Rossellini, Gerard Depardieu, and John Malkovich) does a terrific job as well, and the battle scenes are very exciting. This is truly an epic miniseries on par with ""North and South.""

THE DVD

""Napoleon"" is presented on DVD in its full six-hour running time. The problems with the editing on the television version (which ran three-hours without commercials) are fixed here. The battle scenes are even more exciting, and a little more graphic (Especially the battle of Waterloo, which was butchered when originally shown on A&E). The film also features excellent picture and sound.

The extras are great, the highlight being a 95-minute documentary on the lives of Napoleon and Wellington leading up to the battle of Waterloo. A ""Biography"" on Napoleon (using the same footage and information from ""Napoleon and Wellington), and a 22-minute featurette on the making of the film, are also fascinating. Any fan of the film will not be dissappointed by the DVD release!

1848125,1,B00008IOWU,"The historical in-accuracy - in any respect - of this fabrication is striking. It seems like a bad piece of propaganda. The authors really should have asked some experts (of which there are plenty). It is a terrible waste of money, actors and time amalgamated for the sole purpose of glorification only. The French obviously are the worst historians the world has come to see. This is close to the top of it all.

The Tsar has been depicted as a traitor. Instead it was Napoleon who betrayed him by clandestinely lifting the ban on english trade in order to make a fortune out of related monopolies on goods not to speak of his Marshals making a fortune by clandestinely trading English goods (Massena is one good example of it).
Aspern and Essling (1809) as the first major setback to Napoleon's ambitions (after Egypt), who wanted dictate peace in Vienna, isn't accurately described nor are French battle tactics explained which led to the victories of 1806/07. Peninsula failures are barely touched.
I have learned that the battle at Leipzig (1813) was the final turning point in this Man's astounding career. In this film there is no reflection of it, let alone not even a single Prussian flag on display!
At Waterloo Fieldmarshall Blucher's force is depicted as a laughable cloud of dust only, but it was him and General von Gneisenau who ended what brilliant Wellington had begun on that day. Napoleon is on display as a cunning womanizer only. No reflection of his reforms or the Code Civil disturbs the flatness of this series. The main character's actor might have been chosen for is apparent alikeness only - a bad choice in comparison to somebody like Rod Steiger! Fleeing from Moscow Napoleon revealed his hopes and thoughts to Caulaincourt, with whom he traveled for 13 days sitting next to him in a coach. You'd be surprised by the characterization of Napoleon's innermost handed down by Caulaincourt, of which you'll find nothing in these films.

I will not venture into a tiresome count of all errors displayed. If you want to have a more honest picture (still incomplete though), then go and see 'Waterloo' (1970).

This movie is a misleading farce, historically spoken, except for costumes, horses and coaches which are beautiful to watch.",1117411200,5,2257,4.872395833333333
1848126,4,B00008IOWU,"I enjoy history, but before watching this film I knew next to nothing about Napoleon.

On the upside, the central cast performances are all excellent, and the scenery and costuming are all indescribably delicious.  This film is simply an orgy of palaces, country homes, landscapes, beautiful women in beautiful dresses and seemingly endless 19th century military opulence.  The story touches on most of Napoleon's life and was a compelling and enjoyable way to be introduced to him.  It should also be mentioned that the lighting, cinematography and music are truly beautiful and moving, and the film looks and sounds great on DVD.

On the downside, the supporting cast almost all give performances that are so wooden that you wonder if they need smelling salts, and the words ""made-for-TV"" mean that the film cuts away from itself again and again for commercial breaks that are no longer there.  Also, there are some continuity issues, as in one scene where it appears that Napoleon is wounded in the leg, saying ""It is nothing..."" followed immediately by a scene showing him running normally to go to a fallen officer; something that would be very difficult with a musket ball in your thigh.

Don't let that stop you from renting or buying this DVD set, however, especially if you're new to Napoleonic history.  It kept me interested for two straight nights, and has fueled my desire to know more about this period in European history and the man that defined it.",1095724800,3,1465,4.902834008097166
1848127,2,B00008IOWU,"A major missed opportunity. I tried to like this film - I wanted to like it. But, in the end, I could only watch about half of it. I turned it off wondering why they had even tried to make it in the first place. The main problem - and there are many to choose from - is a script that tries to cram in too much but still manages to leave out even more, and assumes the audience is capable of filling in the gaps. Names are dropped at a furious rate but unless you are familiar with the history of the period, most will not mean anything and none are allowed to ever become anything resembling real people.

I can understand the necessity of compressing and streamlining such an eventful life. But what I find maddening and frustrating is that the decisions of what to include and what to leave out seem so arbitrary. For instance, at one moment we see Napoleon charging across the bridge at Arcole - the next moment he is suddenly back in Paris, the remainder of the Italian campaign forgotten. An important battle such as Marengo is only mentioned in passing. The depiction of the Egyptian campaign is even more muddled than the real thing and feels like it was tossed in as an afterthought. I finally gave up when Napoleon arrived in Poland and encountered Marie Walewska. The clumsy way that episode is handled is typical of this whole sorry enterprise.

The film doesn't even look right sometimes. Too much of it appears shiny and new - the costumes frequently look like they have just come off the wardrobe rack, fresh and never worn. Everything looks sterile - no set looks lived in. Much of it suggests all the authenticity of an old Hollywood swashbuckler filmed on the back lot. In fact, I think that MGM or Warner Brothers, back in the 1930's, would have done a better job.

Which leads us to consider the rather electic assortment of actors assembled to impersonate the historical (and occasionally hysterical) figures. Christian Clavier seems an inspired choice to play Napoleon, even if he occasionally awakens memories of Les Visiteurs. There are brief flashes of brilliance but, for the most part, he is fighting a losing battle against an unactable script. Sometimes his accent doesn't help either. Isabella Rossellini (looking more and more like her mother) is a good actress but displays no hint of the exotic Creole that Josephine was. John Malkovich is almost too good - stealing scenes effortlessly and showing what some of the other performances might have been. Gerard Depardieu, on the other hand, seems at times to be on autopilot which is strange since he is one of the producers. Most of the rest of the cast are so non-descript and one-dimensional that it becomes difficult to remember who is supposed to be who.

If you want to see a really good film about Napoleon, seek out, beg or borrow Abel Gance's silent masterpiece. But if you just want a trashy comic book version...this is it.",1093392000,19,2914,4.641472868217054
1848128,4,B00008IOWU,"A&E bolsters its already considerable reputation in the field of the mini-series with its lengthy treatment of Napoleon Bonaparte. ""Napoleon,"" starring Christian Clavier as the diminutive conqueror, attempts to condense one of history's great figures into six short hours. Any effort to delve into the world of this complex individual will inevitably run up against time and budget constraints, and this mini-series is no exception to that rule, but A&E gives it the old college try anyway. The result is somewhat of a mixed bag. ""Napoleon"" generally succeeds in conveying to the audience a sense of selected aspects of the general's life, but simultaneously the program leaves out an enormous amount of important material. A deadly serious interpretation of Bonaparte's life would probably take twenty or thirty hours at the very least. It is possible to adequately cover ponderous topics in a mini-series, as the BBC production of William Makepeace Thackeray's ""Vanity Fair"" aptly proves, but trying to cover in depth a colossus like Napoleon is impossible. If you are willing to accept that the series will skip significant events, you can still enjoy the program. It helps that several notable actors signed on, specifically Isabella Rossellini as the emperor's wife Josephine, Gerard Depardieu as the wily head of the secret police Fouche, and John Malkovich as the super diplomat Talleyrand.
During the later phases of the French Revolution, Napoleon Bonaparte was merely a minor general with a dream for greatness. ""Napoleon"" emphasizes the military officer's early ambitions quite well as we see him come up with a better plan to quell a riot, presumptuously marry the widow of a man executed during the Reign of Terror, and begin his rapid rise to the top of French politics. The movie covers Napoleon's campaigns in Egypt, his assumption of power during the fall of the Directory, and the consulate period. Napoleon the emperor portrays in some depth his controversial coronation, his fanaticism for heirs, Austerlitz, the invasion of Russia, and the first and second exiles. Too, we see the dramatic return of the emperor known as the Hundred Days, Waterloo, the forming and shattering of internal and external political alliances, assassination attempts, romantic involvements, and the love/hate liaison between the general and his wife. Important characters from history march across the stage, from Czar Alexander to the Pope to the ineffectual Louis the XVIII.
A good way to critique the movie, and also an unavoidable one, is to look at what ""Napoleon"" either slights or ignores entirely. Unfortunately, quite a bit gets left out. The Napoleonic law codes receive short shrift, as does Trafalgar, Borodino, and Leipzig. In many ways, the viewer should expect this. The implementation of new laws throughout Europe just doesn't look that dramatic on the screen. Moreover, some battles had to be left out. How to portray a great naval battle like Trafalgar on a television sized budget? Still, the filmmakers probably should have paid more attention to Borodino. That battle, which Napoleon won at a fatal cost to his empire, in some respects marked the apogee of his power. Perhaps the largest flaw in this production is the lack of proper context. Napoleon rises, rules, and falls without any consideration given to the 1789 revolution that created an environment in which an upstart like Napoleon could assume power. Nor is the effect his rule had on Europe examined. The Congress of Vienna, anyone? How about the ""Concert of Europe""? You can't even begin to understand modern Europe without looking at the reactionary backlash following the general's final defeat. The fact that Napoleon Bonaparte spread liberal French ideas about government throughout the conquered territories is more important than romance and battles. Sadly, such complex themes don't make for very interesting television in an era of short attention spans.
I don't mean to be too hard on the series. I liked the production on a whole. The battle scenes we do see are fascinating to watch. So are the primary performances. Clavier turns in an effective performance portraying the emperor, as does Rossellini as the gregarious Josephine. The real joy is watching Malkovich ham it up as the inscrutable Talleyrand as he limps around leering and dropping sage political aphorisms. Depardieu is less interesting as the lumpy (there's no other way to say it) Fouche. The set pieces and costumes look divine whether they are historically accurate or not. It pains me to say it after blasting the series for heavy emphasis on dramatic battles, but my favorite scenes in the movie occurred at the beginning when Bonaparte quells that riot. He orders his troops to fire grape shot out of the cannons, and the special effects in these sequences were gruesomely effective. You literally see hunks of metal punching through bodies in slow motion. It's all quite gory, one would think too gory for television. The later battle scenes oddly do not use the same effect. As much as I turn my nose up at some of the blatant omissions in the movie, I must admit the mini-series is well worth watching.
A bunch of extras adorn the three discs. While you don't get trailers or commentary tracks like you would on a theatrically released film transferred to DVD, you do get some stuff unique to A&E, such as Napoleon's ""Biography"" episode, a behind the scenes featurette, another documentary about Napoleon and the Wellington, and cast biographies. A giant in western history, Napoleon Bonaparte will probably never get a film treatment that will equal his life. If you wish to learn more about this amazing figure, plenty of books await your pleasure. Don't forget to read Tolstoy's ""War and Peace"" for an account of Borodino that will have you biting your nails. Clear six hours off your schedule and give this one a watch. It's entertaining, moderately informative, and looks wonderful. Thanks, A&E!",1086912000,3,5971,5.118852459016393
1848129,5,B00008IOWU,"A&E did a marvelous job re-creating Napoleons life.  I would have liked to see A&E go into more detail concerning historical events and lives of the people involed.  Then the movie probably woudnt be titled strictly Napoleon.  However, I have a very curious mind and would have like to further explore all faucets of the life, people and events in it.  I do wish it were longer it would have definatly had no problem holding my attention.  I love to see how Napoleon progressed and refined himself.  He transformed himself from rough to refined and I got to watch the whole journey.  Just a small example would be when he first took power, his look represented not only by clothes but composure was scratchy at best.  As he progressed it unfolded into the definition of a stately ruler. Why wait, if you love a film caputuring genius and their life buy now.",1082678400,,857,4.592105263157895
1848130,2,B00008IOWU,"I have this exact version of the DVD (a 3-disc set as pictured here), and I have to voice some pretty major complaints:
1. There are NO subtitles - not even English for the hearing impaired!
2. The sound editing is horrible! I'm not sure if this is a flaw for the movie in general or just the mix on this particular DVD, but there were several times when the musical score was playing so loud that it was nearly impossible to understand what the characters were saying. I have a top-notch 5.1 surround system, and I tried it with surround and with only the TV speakers. Either way it was a horrible sound mix that made it hard to make out what was said.
This is forgivable for movies that at least offer you subtitles so you can ""read"" what the characters are saying, but with this movie you are left with no choice but to back-up and start the scene over.
3. There is no reason why this version couldn't have fit on one disk. The version sold here in Europe has the exact same technical specifications and fits nicely on one disk (all four episodes).
The only logical reason I can see for selling it this way is to squeeze more money out of the public. It could have been sold as a 2-disc set with all four episodes on one disc and the extras on the supplementary/extra one but then they would have had to cut the retail price in half.
A tragedy!
On the ""film"" side of things, the movie is only ""ok"" - not great.
The costumes, locations and sets are all nicely done, but the makeup is horrendous (at one point you can even see the glue and tape used on one of the beards as it does a close-up that should have been reshot in pickups)! The music is bad, trying too hard to be epic. The script is much to complicated and doesn't bring us into the story nearly as well as it could. (You have to know an awful lot about Napoleon to understand what's going on at times.) The acting for the main characters is adequate - and even good at times. However, the secondary characters are quite awful.
Basically, the bottom line is it's a nice-looking film (aside from bad makeup) but the story is hard to follow. On top of that, poor sound-editing and lack-of subtitles makes this a huge disappointment!
I suggest looking elsewhere unless you are absolutley insistant on seeing a so-called ""complete"" film on the life of arguably one of the greatest powerful leaders this world has ever known.",1081987200,5,2383,4.357303370786517

1848133,4,B00008IOWU,"NAPOLEON is a splendid A&E mini-series about one of the most famous generals/conquerors/rulers/reformers in history.  This is an international production based upon the book by Max Gallo and is sympathetic towards BONAPARTE.  Even at six hours, it can't cover all the details covered in hundreds of pages in hundreds of books.  There are plenty of times you wish they had given a bit more background.  Yet, it does an admirable job in giving you the essence and understanding of the period while being highly entertaining.
Some of the international supporting cast seem a little wooden, but the stars do well in enlightening the characters and events.  Christian Clavier gives a convincing, sympathetic, and understanding portrayal of Napoleon, although with little of his darker side.  Isabella Rossellini enables you to see why Napoleon loved Josephine despite her philandering while he was away in his early years.  (Yes, there is more to Josephine than appearances).  John Malkovic plays a really smooth Talleyrand who as Foreign Minister survived and served multiple masters in the revolution, empire, and monarchy.
The film begins in 1795 when Napoleon is a promising young officer.  One of the most fascinating aspects of celebrities is seeing how they got to the top.  The film adequately shows how Napoleon defended the revolutionary government against the rabble, was rewarded with a command in Italy where his brilliant leadership ability begin to shine, and overthru the murderous government ostensibly to forestall a return of the monarchy.  Although his reign was relatively brief, less than twenty years, these were some of the most momentous events in European history and the film covers a variety of his personal, military, and political highlights.  You see little of his lasting political reforms, but see why he was so momentous.  His return from Elba with a handful of supporters, winning back the army to his side, and retaking the government illustrates his appeal and popularity.
The film shines with lavish settings, palaces, and military maneuvers.  Of course there are plenty of battles including Arcola, Austerlitz, Jena, Eylau, Aspern-Essling, and Waterloo.  None of the battles get the full treatment like the Soviet version of many years ago, but while short, they are well done.  You'll have to read books to find out why he was a military genius and pore over his tactics, but the film's battles make it clear that conquering, holding, and losing most of Europe wasn't easy.
In sum, the film fulfills its promise to entertain and enlighten viewers with a brief overview about one of the most fascinating individuals in history and to show why our interest endures today.  Then go on to learn the details by reading a book or reliving the era by playing a game.  Napoleonic era boardgames is one of the largest and most detailed areas of gaming.",1067817600,5,2878,5.113247863247863
1848134,4,B00008IOWU,"Apparently, many reviewers feel disappointed that the six-hour A&E miniseries on Napoleon did not include every battle, every major incident in the life of the famous Corsican.  Let's be realistic for a moment.  Even 1,000+ page books likes Chandler's The Campaigns of Napoleon do not cover all aspects of the Emperor's life.  In order to provide the kind of in-depth coverage of Napoleon's 22-year career from Toulon to Waterloo, this mini-series would have to have been about 20-24 hours long and obviously cost about four times as much.  Does anyone think that is going to happen in our quick-buck entertainment industry? Instead of grumbling about what the mini-series omitted, viewers should appreciate A&E's effort and recognize this mini-series for what it is: marvelous.  My review of Napoleon: the Miniseries will discuss what material was included in these six hours, what was minimized, and what was omitted.
 The producers of Napoleon get scant credit for packing six major Napoleonic battles (Arcola, Austerlitz, Jena, Eylau, Aspern-Essling, and Waterloo) into this six-hour format.  Each battle gets at least 5-10 minutes of coverage, which is enough to convey at least some of the highlights; reviewers who expected a Bondarchuk-style coverage of each action are unreasonable (and even he omitted key details in his film on Waterloo).  Key events that receive significant treatment in the mini-series include: Napoleon's suppression of the Paris uprising in 1795, the Coup of Brumaire, an assassination attempt, the murder of Duke d'Enghien, the Treaty of Tilsit, Marie Walewska, the imperial coronation, Napoleon's abdication, the Hundred Days, exile on Elba and St Helena, and his death.  Key personalities who receive major speaking roles include Marshals Ney, Murat, and Lannes; Talleyrand, Fouche, Josephine, Marie-Louise, Joseph, Lucien, and the Tsar Alexander.  All in all, this is a huge amount of material.
 The mini-series covered five battles or campaigns in brief, usually with one quick scene or brief mention: the Egyptian Campaign, Trafalgar, the Peninsula War, the Russian Campaign, and the 1814 Campaign in France.  A number of personalities, mostly military men, are also briefly depicted: Captain Muiron, Davout, Augereau, Berthier, Bernadotte, Soult, Grouchy, Eugene, Blucher, and Wellington.  The only incidents briefly depicted are Napoleon's schoolboy days at Brienne, which are covered in two historically inaccurate scenes.
 Obviously, a great deal of material just could not fit in the six-hour format.  Ten major battles or campaigns were entirely omitted: the siege of Toulon, most of the 1796 Italian campaign, the Pyramids, the Syrian campaign, Marengo, Auerstadt, Friedland, Wagram, Borodino, and Leipzig.  Omitted incidents include most of Napoleon's first 26 years, Napoleon abandoning armies in Egypt & Russia, and the Treaty of Campo Formio 1797.  A number of significant marshals, such as Massena, Oudinot, and Junot are not mentioned once.  I think the only valid criticism that can be made about these omissions is that the producers tended to enhance the importance of a few minor characters such as Muiron or Roustam, at the expense of historically more important figures like Berthier.
 There are a number of criticisms that could be made about how the historical material is presented.  First, the transitions between most of the major events are poor; this mini-series desperately needs brief narrative blurbs to describe what is happening or just happened (e.g. we see the retreat from Moscow, but there is no mention of the scale of this catastrophe.  A brief slide could have said, ""Napoleon invaded Russia with 600,000 men and only 40,000 made it back to Poland.).  Second, there is a general failure to properly introduce Napoleon's family members or marshals properly.  The result is that these characters keep appearing out of nowhere and viewers unfamiliar with this period will be wondering, ""just how many brothers and generals does this guy have?""  Finally, the mini-series makes no real effort to attempt to explain the reasons for Napoleon's rise or fall; things happen, one after another, until he ends up on St Helena.  Obviously the 6-hour format is again partly the culprit for this failure to analyze or explain, but part of it lies in the fact that the film tends to see events though Napoleon's eyes (which helps to engender empathy in the viewer).  Napoleon was indeed oblivious to many of the events and people working toward his downfall, and this mini-series imposes that same tunnel vision upon the viewer.
 In sum, Napoleon: the mini-series could not possibly hope to cover all of this man's very busy life in only 6 hours, but A&E makes an honest effort and the result is the best portrayal of the Emperor's life to date.  The writers should also be congratulated for depicting Napoleon in a manner that gains empathy for his insights while not hiding his misdeeds.  If anything, this is the kind of film that should spur viewers to read more about Napoleon in order to find out more about omitted details.  Thank you A&E!",1059350400,127,5107,5.238329238329238

7984513,1,B00008IOWU,"Midway through the first episode, my husband looks at me and asks, Is this as bad as I think it is? Yes, yes it is. We watch a lot of historical entertainment, so its not the genre that turned us off. Its the terrible writing, the tragically bad cinematography and sets, and the forced acting (although how much can you fault actors given such poor material to work with?). Its truly not wellmade and not worth your time. Ive no idea how they cast such big names in it.",1524009600,,469,4.280898876404494

7984515,4,B00008IOWU,"As with any bio pic worth its salt this begins as a flashback from 1818 as a prisoner on his own Alcatraz to 1795 when he made a name for himself in the streets of Paris with his battle decision making. From there he marries and heads off to a violent battle.

Upon returning home he is adored so he goes out to Egypt in an effort to claim that area, dire situations (see the book 'Mirage'.)

He again returns home and with force takes over, then has the Pope bless him as he crowns HIMSELF! Political intrigue and female encounters. Engaging, insightful, colorful, big and beautiful.

Scenes of battle violence and ever-present cleavage.",1502409600,,638,4.578947368421052

7984517,4,B00008IOWU,"This is a great showing much about Napoleon that can only be found in books.  I have only two complaints.  One is that it has no subtitles, and it can be needed at times as the actor (Clavier) who plays Napoleon has a heavy accent.  The second is more for historical clarification.  As it is believed that Napoleon was short at only 5 foot 1 or 2, it has been found that Napoleon was quite taller, since the French inch is longer than the British inch, but that fact was ignored for British propaganda reasons.  Clavier is actually about the same height as the real Napoleon, 5' 6"", but it seems they went to extra lengths (no pun intended) to make him appear as short as the British wanted us to believe.",1484006400,,705,4.3106060606060606

7984521,4,B00008IOWU,"A six-hour reenactment of Napoleon's life beginning in Paris in 1795 with John Malkovich portraying Talleyrand, his foreign minister and advisor. After the attempted assassination on Napoleon, the minister of police and others believed, based on flimsy evidence, that royalist duke d'Enghien was responsible, and he was executed. Josephine and his mother, Letizia, thought he was innocent and that Napoleon should have pardoned him. The surrender of French General Pierre Dupont and the defeat at the battle of Bailen, Spain, was followed by the Spanish people striking out at the French Army in Madrid on May 2, 1808. By sunset, 150 French soldiers were killed. This led to a brutal, savage war with atrocities committed on both sides, a type of guerrilla warfare. Napoleon went to Madrid in December 1808 to regain control. When no one heard from him for three days, they feared the worst. This scare and the assassination attempt prompted Talleyrand to urge Napoleon to produce an heir (son) or the overthrow of his monarchy was possible. This would guarantee the stability and continuity of his administration and government. Because Josephine was too old to conceive an heir, Talleyrand tried to drive a wedge between her and Napoleon. Talleyrand suggested to Napoleon that he consider Marie Louise, Archduchess of Austria, as a future wife. Napoleon was interested in Countess Marie Walewska of Poland for a time. She was devoutly religious and married with a 2-year-old son. She offered to sacrifice her principles, subordinate her dignity, and make herself available to satisfy Napoleon's carnal desires to curry his favor. She hoped that Emperor Napoleon had the power to wrest freedom and independence for Poland away from her enemies - Prussia, Austria, and Russia. Prior to going to Spain in 1808, Napoleon had defeated the Russians in the battle at Friedland. He convinced Russian Czar (Tsar) Alexander to sign the Treaty of Tilsit on a floating raft on the Nieman River in July 1807. The Czar joined the alliance forbidding European nations from trading with the British. The ""Continental System"" barred British ships from all ports under French rule and also barred neutral nations from carrying British goods to the continent. The Continental System not only ruined the British economy but all its European neighbors including Russia. The Russian Czar soon recanted the continental blockade against England. Further negotiations became futile when Napoleon demanded a sovereign and independent Poland. The Czar would not permit this. He viewed Poland on his border as a threat. Nor would he agree to constraining the Prussians and Austrians from acquiring weapons. So Napoleon in a strategic move married the Archduchess of Austria to ally France with Austria. Christian Clavier was superb in the role of Napoleon, and so was the acting of John Malkovich, Isabella Rossellini (Josephine), and Gerard Depardieu (Fouche - Minister of Police). The 94-minute ""Napoleon and Wellington"" documentary from Bonus disc III compares the lives of these two extraordinary military commanders born months apart in 1769. Extensive details and insights are presented about these two leaders, Wellington of Britain and Napoleon of France, whose careers culminated in the battle of Waterloo, Belgium. This battle is examined here in great depth. The only downside is the actors speak with a pronounced accent, so you have to listen closely to understand every word.",1471132800,3,3463,5.286751361161524
