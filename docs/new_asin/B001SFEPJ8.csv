8339746,5,B001SFEPJ8,"There is not a whole lot to say about this amazing little piece of history about secret societies and the occult. This two DVD set helped me write my book called the 'L.A.M.B,' without it I would have been sorely hamstrung. In addition to this wonderful DVD set I also had the pleasure of making reference to the 'Occult Conspiracy' by Michael Howard. These resources made fact-finding almost effortless.

I chose five stars because the information was realistic and not hyperbolized.

Moreover, I did not dislike anything about the two DVD set. And I can certainly say I learned more than I expected.

I would recommend this DVD set to anyone writing a book on the occult, secret societies or in need of such information for their fiction novel. Or those who are curious to know how all this occult business got started anyway, and whether it is still as dark and secret as in the past. Once you start watching the DVD's I am sure you will no longer wonder why the very rich will never be dethroned and why they in fact control governmental operations from behind the scenes in most countries. You will also understand why Alex Jones, radio host, becomes such a lunatic whenever the Bilderberg group hold one of their private conferences somewhere in the world.",1393113600,3,1262,4.701357466063349
