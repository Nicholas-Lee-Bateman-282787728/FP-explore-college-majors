8548531,5,B0058U3SMY,"This is a collection of three of French director Jean-Claude Brisseau's films; Life the Way it Is, Cline, and Workers for the Good Lord.  Brisseau first earned notoriety from his film the Sound and the Fury about youth in French Suburban housing projects who faced with poverty and dysfunction form gangs. He was hailed as a realist and social critic for this work, but this view narrows his abilities as a director. In all three of the films in this collection Brisseau effortlessly blends genres and themes to create truly different and exceptional works. Life the Way it Is  is Brisseau's second film and is considered one of his most radical. It is about women entering the workforce in a modern globalized economy. Agnes leaves school to make a living in a factory, but once there she is faced with sexual harassment, alienation, and unstable co-workers. Cline is a psychological drama based on a suicidal girl with supernatural healing powers and her caretaker/nurse. Workers for the Good Lord is part melodrama and part dark comedy. After his wife leaves him Fred joins up with an unlikely pair, Sandrine and  Maguette, to go on a bank robbing spree through the south of France. This collection is entertaining, insightful, and though-provoking. It would make a great addition to anyone's film collection.",1318291200,,1312,4.981735159817352
