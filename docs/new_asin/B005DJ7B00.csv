Nova explores who the Iceman was, how he remain hidden for so long, possible events that lead to his death, and the various scientific tests being done on him to reveal his mystery.",1405209600,3,292,4.528301886792453

4660057,5,B005DJ7B00,I actually show this to my class at the beginning of the semester to try to hook their attention on the field of anthropology. The information in it is great and the way it is layed out really hooks my students.,1362787200,,211,4.170731707317073
4660058,5,B005DJ7B00,"this scientific study of the discovery of a frozen mummy is engaging, and becomes a murder mystery that even when rewatching it leaves one guessing. the clues and questions the documentary askes and the personal questions one asks of oneself go deep if you let it. on the other hand it is a visually intreaging piece, well recorded, easy to follow and crosses generations and cultures. this is the story of one of our ancestors and his untimely death! yikes! i watch it and never tire of it.",1361145600,,491,4.590909090909091
4660059,5,B005DJ7B00,"Have seen both pieces on the Iceman on PBS and thought my son and family would enjoy, which they did.  This DVD is about
the scientists discovering more about him thru more testing, how he died, food he had eaten, etc.  Truly amazing to think they can still extract DNA after all those centuries.  Would recommend.",1357344000,,314,4.571428571428571
4660060,5,B005DJ7B00,"What an interesting specimen the ICEMAN is. To think he was murded 5,OOO years ago, yet his mummfied body is here today. This is a great discovery for science, and for the rest of the world. He was found by hikers up in the alps, at first they thought it was the body of a climber who had lost his life up there. But on further shoveling they discoverd primitive tools near the Icemans body, and knew they had come across something unbelieveable. It was the body of a stone age man. This documentary shows you performing an autopsy on the body, to try and unravel the mysterys surrounding this frozen man. And you will learn how he died. The Iceman lived all those many centurys ago, even 3,OOO years befor Christ was born, so that is a very long time ago. Some of his community were farmers, others were nomads. But he was just a person. Like us. He looked the same as we do. He ate meat too. They found the contents of a meat and bread meal still in his stomach. The only difference with this man, is he carried bows and arrows around with him. This documentary is well worth watching. As they will never find another, quite like him.",1345248000,8,1136,4.313084112149533
4660061,5,B005DJ7B00,"Have always been interested in the 'path' of the iceman.  This the latest NOVA offering and brings you up to date with the latest information.  Since receiving and viewing, there have been some follow-up articles with even more recent discoveries...can't help but think more to follow.  Highly recommended.",1340668800,,306,5.333333333333333

""Frozen for more than 5000 years, on a remote mountain pass, and now, preserved for the ages in a refrigerated tomb;  he is the Iceman, a frozen relic from the Stone Age. The oldest human body ever found.  He's a messenger from the past, bearing secrets of how humans lived nearly a 1000 years before the [Great] Pyramids [of Egypt].  He is also a homicide, waiting to be solved.

Who was he?  And who shot an arrow into his back?  Was it warfare?  Or murder?

Now a rare and dangerous procedure [autopsy] leads to some startlingly fresh clues.  A piece of bone, a copper axe, and a last meal surprise the experts, as they come closer to understanding our ancient past and to solving the Iceman murder mystery.""

The above is said by the narrator at the beginning of this extraordinary documentary.

The mummy was found and pulled from a glacier Sept. 1991 in the Otztal Alps near the border between Austria and Italy.  Thus, the Iceman is also known as ""Otzi.""

An autopsy was performed (including a DNA analysis) giving details of Otzi's death and life.

Throughout the program brief comments are made by an alpine archaeologist, radiologist, etc.

Near the end of the documentary, all the evidence that's found is considered leading to an unexpected conclusion of who killed Otzi.

Finally, the DVD itself (the one released in 2012) is perfect in picture and audio quality.  There are no extras.

In conclusion, this is an exceptional documentary that may have solved the ""world's oldest open case of homicide!!""

4660063,5,B005DJ7B00,My students enjoyed this as a supplement to our social studies curriculum.  It fit the bill when I wanted more information on this curious case.  I'd seen it first on PBS and wanted a copy of my own for my room.,1324080000,8,211,4.121951219512195

8466933,5,B005DJ7B00,"The surprising scientific analysis - 'Iceman' from five-thousand years ago - is us!

He has heart disease, is lactose intolerant and suffers from Lyme disease. The scientists were stunned, since this was thought to be modern problems.

He also carried a ''copper ax''! Before this find, it was accepted that five-thousand years ago was the ''stone age''.

Wrong!

The ability to refine copper indicates a stunning level of technology. His clothes and shoes were complex, multi-fiber garments. He used a backpack frame strikingly similar to modern ones. The narrator asks -

What do we conclude?
The ''Iceman'' is us!

DNA suggests connection to people in Sardinia. Had brown eyes.

Amazing what scientists uncover!

This one hour video focuses on Iceman's cause of death. Shot in the back by arrow and hit viciously enough to crack his skull (yes, he is us). They analyze how he died.
Undoubtedly homicide.
Sad.

Empathizes the meticulous care of the scientists/doctors to preserve the frozen corpse. They unthaw him carefully. They are only allowed nine hours of investigation before refreezing.

Drama!

Can they complete their work?

Interesting and informative. Plan to watch with my grandson.",1481241600,3,1197,5.242105263157895

8466940,2,B005DJ7B00,"The discovery of a frozen man 5300 years old is one of the most breathtaking events to have happened in archaeology in the past 50 years.  This pathetic DVD trivializes the event into a 'Murder Mystery"" which is completely unsubstantiated and completely NOT the most interesting part of what we can know about this man.  Focus, focus focus.  If this kind of whispering voice over and loud drum-beating music is the best ""science"" can do with this astonishing discovery then give this film a complete miss and read, or have your students read, some of the more substantial descriptive articles that have been published about Otzi,  This film is just low-level ""entertainment.""  The event itself is major.  Everyone involved in this joke of a film should have to find other work.",1417305600,2,777,4.893129770992366
