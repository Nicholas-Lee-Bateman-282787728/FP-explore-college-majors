8638594,4,B00I39V9BY,"""Danger - Love At Work"" is a 1937 comedy that was directed by Otto Preminger.  It was so early in his career he did not think later that it was not just another exercise to show Darryl F. Zanuck that he could direct... anything. The comedy, which could have showed much more engaging social themes, heightens itself upon the eccentricities of a peculiarly oddball and wealthy family.  Ann Southern and Jack Haley expound a lot of energy as the two leads while the film also stars Mary Boland, Edward Everett Horton, John Carradine, Walter Catlett, Bennie Bartlett and many others.  The screenplay by James Edward Grant and Ben Markson, based on a story by James Edward Grant, in hindsight today is rather hilarious, and 20th Century-Fox has wisely added this to its Cinema Archives Collection this time in full frame.  There is an inkling of the Preminger taste for the controversy, with an added complication of Southern and Haley forced to spend the night together in a barn and ""society"" (Southern's two old maid aunts and then the entire family) getting the wrong impression.  Although the script turns its attentions on a rather tedious and obvious aspect for comedy, the family's many eccentricities, it still has a rather sophisticated and, ultimately, innocuous adult charm.  Works on many levels although it could have been done with much more insight.  (The fun title theme song sung in the film by Ann Southern and Jack Haley goes uncredited in the film but the music is by Harry Revel with lyrics by Mack Gordon). b & w, 81 mins.",1397347200,6,1541,4.7924528301886795
