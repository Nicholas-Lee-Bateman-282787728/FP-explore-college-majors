3028303,5,B000YDZPMG,"This is a great popcorn eating fun scary movie! 'Nightmare Man' is another classic horror-comedy from Dir. Rolfe Kanefsky starring scream queen Tiffany Shepis. This is essence of Kanefsky horror- great comic lines that come just before the gross kill, the tough sexy Shepis toting guns and crossbows and an awesome traumaqueen performance from the gorgeous Blythe Metz who was pretty darn believable. True to form Kanfesky takes us on a thrilling ride full of twists and turns. It made me jump in my seat and laugh out loud! If you want high art, go to the opera, if you want a fun night with friends eating popcorn in your living room, get Nightmare Man. If you haven't checked out Kanefsky's other movies- try 'The Hazing' and 'There's Nothing Out There', you won't regret it!",1205539200,4,778,4.770370370370371
3028304,1,B000YDZPMG,"I went to see ""Nightmare Man"" with my father, and about halfway through, I actually had to lean towards his ear and apologize to him. I wasn't sorry for the time we were spending together, but I sure as hell was sorry for the film we had to sit through. The number of levels this movie sucks on is amazing: it's unoriginal, predictable, badly scripted, badly acted, miscast, uneven, unimaginative, and--perhaps worst of all--not at all scary. This movie had all the charisma of a direct to video shocker produced and filmed by amateurs, and that's an insult to amateurs since they probably could do a much better job. I don't know who thought it was a good idea to make this film, but whoever it is needs to see more movies and see them frequently; anyone appreciative of the cinematic arts would never let their own film project stoop to this level.

""Nightmare Man"" opens with a dream sequence, in which a woman named Ellen (Blythe Metz) is stalked by a demon wearing a green devil mask (which she bought thinking it was symbolic of fertility). She runs through her darkened house, clad in only her bathrobe, while her Italian husband, William (Luciano Szafir), is off trying to restore the power. Just as the demon is about to catch her, she awakens in the passenger seat of her husband's car, after which she panics because she's late in taking her medication. William is driving Ellen to a mental institution because she's been having frequent, disturbing dreams, and she's convinced that the demon chasing her--the Nightmare Man--is real. She's also convinced that no one, not even doctors, will be able to help her. All she has is her pills to keep herself under control, which is interesting since they bear a striking resemblance to Tic Tacs.

Ellen and William's drive leads them into the woods, and it's there that the car runs out of gas. Stranded and without a working cell phone, William opts to walk back to a far away gas station for help. Ellen, of course, stays in the car. By the time it gets dark, her fears begin to take hold, and she can't help but feel that someone is out in the woods, waiting for her. And as it turns out, someone is in the woods. Clad in the green fertility mask, the Nightmare Man chases Ellen through the woods; he even catches her a few times, which makes me wonder how she managed to avoid being killed.

Meanwhile, at a cabin nestled deep in the woods, we meet four young characters: Jack (James Ferris); his fiance, Trinity (Hanna Putnam); Mia (Tiffany Shepis); and her boyfriend, Ed (Jack Sway). These characters are introduced playing Erotic Truth or Dare, and from that alone, you should have a pretty good idea of what they represent. This is especially true of Mia, whose foulmouthed, oversexed, and sarcastic, even when the occasion doesn't call for it. When they think they hear a noise from the woods, Mia grabs her crossbow and steps outside, not seeming to care that she's wearing nothing but lacy black underwear and a bra. To borrow a phrase from Dr. Seuss, she has all the tender sweetness of a seasick crocodile.

And that's when Ellen finds them. Lost, alone, and desperate for help, Ellen rants and raves about the evil that's out there, about how the Nightmare Man has actually escaped from inside of her and become real. Of course, no one believes her until he actually starts attacking. Thus begins the slasher portion of the film, the monotony of which is broken when Ellen realizes that she's lost her pills. Yes, we all know how it feels to not have medication around when we need it--sitting in the theater, I wanted an aspirin, but silly me, I left them all at home. Next time I'll know better.

Or maybe I won't. Sometimes, you don't know just how bad a movie will be before you see it; all you can do is go into it cold and hope for the best. That was certainly the case with ""Nightmare Man."" Had I known I would be watching something this pitiful, something this unbelievably ill conceived ... but why dwell on what I had no control over? That's just negative thinking, and as Mia screams at Ellen, ""I want you to say something positive! Tell a story that begins with `Once upon a time,' and ends with, `Happily ever after'!"" Sound advice, wouldn't you say? And why not? Mia holds a shotgun as she says this while Ellen is bound to a sofa by her wrists and ankles.

That moment paves the way for the final fifteen minutes, which goes in such a different direction that it seemed to belong in another movie. But considering the skill level of the filmmakers, this should come as no surprise at all. ""Nightmare Man"" functions at the same level as a carnival funhouse, full of dark corridors, random spooky noises, and pop out scares so unconvincing that we laugh instead of scream. I'm tempted to recommend this film as a parody, but since it was actually taking itself seriously, I know that would be the wrong thing to do. This isn't a spoof--it's only a bad movie starring untalented actors and made by untalented filmmakers.",1194739200,10,5002,4.589485458612975

3028307,5,B000YDZPMG,Its a very good film if you understand it from a spiritual point of view. Its a low budget film but done very well. The creature in the show is the same as the Jumbee/Dybbuk of the movie Unborn and the Babadook of the movie Babadook. They are also called the Brahma Rakshasa of India. In west Africa they are called Ajo Nnu Nu (evil birds). The native Americans like the Lakota called them Thunder beings. They are also called tree dwellers and forest spirits. The god Pan is a similar entity. These are the same creatures being referenced under different name. They have many more names. So if you watch the movie from that perspective you will see that the movie makers are very knowledgeable of their topic and incorporated a lot of information about these entities and how they are said to behave.,1476057600,,801,4.531034482758621

3028310,1,B000YDZPMG,Terrible. Sub-par acting and story-line. I thought the part where the young adults were drinking and playing games was especially pooly acted and quite pointless to the entire movie. It felt like they just were trying to add in some nudity in a movie that would have been better without it.,1456617600,2,290,4.705882352941177

3028313,5,B000YDZPMG,"I have been a fan of the 8 to Die For series since i saw Frontiers & have been collecting them ever since,some are hit or miss but this film here is amazing.
It starts off with a couple with fertility issues,so a mask comes in the mail(supposedly the wrong mask) & right from the start things go wrong. Apparently a mask holds a demonic power to it,so the guy takes his wife on a ride to the psyche hospital. He keeps the mask in the trunk for the therapy that is to come. The car breaks down & the battery of the cell died so she is out there alone with ""the nightmare man"" while her husband tries to take a walk to get gas. There are spoilers coming....there are a group of people in a cabin sharing a weekend of premiscuous games & partying before 1 of the couples marries. So the group of 4 people are having fun as the party gets going & the girl seeing the nightmare man runs into the cabin with the partygoers. The girl really does see the man in the mask,which is a guy who is wearing the mask & is paid to kill the crazy wife. Well turns out that bodies turn up left and right and the demon really comes outta the girl seeing the nightmare man(who is OBSESSED with taking her pills) Well needless to say she does not get her pills & the real demon is unleashed,tearing through the party members  1by 1 as well as the hitman & her husband. The demon is left to confront the head owner of the cabin(Tiffany Shepis) and the demon is forced from the body & it's spirit goes into Tiffany Shepis. She is left alone,the sole survivor babbling about demons & she is put in the nuthouse. She is just like the original girl,she needs the pills to keep the demon at bay....but the dr's don't believe her & they take her off the meds. So in summation,the film is excellent...compared to some of the other 8 to Die For series(Unrest,Penny Dreadful,Wicked Little Things,Dark Ride) this has great acting,an excellent cast,lots of cool special effects & good gore and plot twists. I recommend you get a copy,especially if you love Tiffany Shepis like i do.",1455408000,,2049,4.308290155440415

3028317,4,B000YDZPMG,"Initially, Nightmare Man looks like a cheaply made piece of crap with no real scares. A vapid film that banks on excessive blood and nudity to keep your attention. And it is, but this film knows it and embraces the schlock and proudly shows it off for all the fun it has. On top of a seemingly run-of-the-mill horror plot the film injects some clever twists to the formula with some surprisingly intelligent characters (at least for a horror movie) and plenty of twists to keep things from feeling to by-the-numbers. I found myself enjoying the film more and more as I watched it and by the end I was glad to have watched it.

This film is certainly for those who know and love the classic slasher movie and don't mind some ""so bad it's good"" with their movie. If you're looking for a genuinely terrifying film then you're SOL, it isn't scary. But it certainly is entertaining.",1446422400,,877,4.515723270440252

3028323,1,B000YDZPMG,"I could write a comprehensive review about this movie, but honestly why bother. It is what it is: a B-horror movie the kind that you find on TV late at night, or the kind you watch with your friends for the fun of it. Throw some unnecessary nudity and sexuality, and you have a movie that could have been made by a college film student over the weekend. But honestly, I'm not trying to belittle the movie. It is what it is, nothing more, and nothing less. Though slight kudos for the 'twist' near the end.",1444176000,,505,4.270833333333333
3028324,4,B000YDZPMG,not bad at all. sound track a little low quality though but much better B movie then some,1443744000,,89,4.0
3028325,3,B000YDZPMG,"Very bad acting.  Also comes with your typical 20 something naked girls getting killed, apparently people think you can't make a good horror movie without showing a lot of boobs and sexual language or more, surprise you can!  The story line itself was not to bad and it did have a little twist at the end, but I do not care to see this movie ever again.  This movie is only good for absolute boredom when there is nothing else to watch.",1443657600,,436,4.2926829268292686
3028326,3,B000YDZPMG,"Regarding the movie itself, it was entertaining with some parts being humorous and others a bit spooky. Just a bit.
However the portrayal of daemons was shoddy at best. And misleading at worst.  As someone who has had numerous personal relationships with many daemons, I was taken aback at the childish misrepresentation of my lovers from a different dimension. None of my loveons (daemon lovers) had teeth resembling drunken enraged piranha with gingivitis nor do they look like fourth hand knockoffs of the Muppet's or makeshift versions of a puppet from Peter Jackson's classic ""Meet the Feebles""  lol
IMSSO Troma could have done a much better job with the special effect portion of the movie.
Not the best-AfterDark- flick, buuuuuuut not the worst.",1443225600,,752,5.105691056910569
3028327,4,B000YDZPMG,I really liked it.,1443139200,,18,3.75
3028328,2,B000YDZPMG,"Well, i'm glad it's back up on prime, so i didn't waste money watching this. This wasn't as bad as ""Unearthed"" (another after dark film).
The basic idea of the movie is, the husband cannot perform in bed, the wife gets a fertility mask, never returns it because she gets a shower and the next thing you know she is waking up in the car (okay something happens, but spoilers).
Apparently the mask is haunting her, and her husband is taking her to a mental hospital, and being a total jerk about it, seriously, this guy is a piece of , well you know.
So the car runs out of gas, he leaves her there (so she won't say ""i told you so"" the whole way, according to the husband. Now, if this hasn't peaked your interest, then don't watch it. The film gets darker, and by darker, i mean someone forgot to higher a lighting crew.
Now while the wife is running in the woods, you get introduced to a cast of forgettable characters, seriously, the cliche of playing truth or dare with sexual undertones (sound interesting? it's not)
Then the wife bursts in, and i'm not going to say anything else about that stuff.
So, there is a story, a plot, etc. Does any of this get resolved in a well written fashion? nope. The last twenty minutes are the most interesting (minus the final scenes, ugh). The acting is what you would expect, nothing exceptional. You don't really care about the characters, it's rather boring, poorly paced, and the ""twist"" didn't surprise me, i'm sorry.
All in all it was a movie, it was watchable, i just doubt i would watch it again. (if this review isn't helpful, could you please tell me how i could be helpful?)",1442966400,,1626,4.40531561461794

3028331,1,B000YDZPMG,"Save yourselves, I keep searching for a decent horror movie but I am truly afraid that the industry has lost it. It seems like anyone can make a movie now and while that is not always a problem most of the time it is.",1427328000,,217,3.9545454545454546
3028332,5,B000YDZPMG,once you get pass the low budget it was worth watching,1423872000,,54,4.0
3028333,3,B000YDZPMG,A few good twists in the third act and a gutsy performance by underrated scream queen Tiffany Shepis make this pretty watchable despite poor production values and an otherwise average cast.,1423180800,,189,5.129032258064516
3028334,2,B000YDZPMG,"I'm actually an After Dark film fan, but Nightmare Man is pretty much a complete miss. Sets up a decent story and then completely spins out of control into ridiculousness. As a plus, it does have Richard Moll, but even that is mostly a tease as he's present for only the last couple minutes.",1422921600,,291,4.407407407407407
3028335,2,B000YDZPMG,"I usually enjoy most of After Dark Horrorfest's movies. Borderland, Frontier(s), Deaths of Ian Stone, etc, but this may unfortunately have to be an exception.

The opening plot focuses on the main character, Ellen who lives with her husband, William. After Ellen orders an African fertility mask through the mail, she becomes plagued with haunting visions of a demonic supernatural entity named The Nightmare Man, who she believes is after her. Her husband and doctors believe she's paranoid and schizophrenic and give her pills to help control her condition.

As they travel to the mental institution one evening, the car breaks down in the woods and while William goes off in search of help, Ellen stays in the car and that's where The Nightmare Man shows up.

Overall: That's as much as I can give away without telling too much of the movie. In my opinion, Nightmare Man was a decent movie with a decent plot until we get around the last 15 minutes. Seriously, this movie takes such a ridiculous twist during the last 15 minutes, it'll have you shaking your head in disgust and disappointment, laughing at how stupid it is, and almost wishing you never even bothered watching it. The movie had potential to be great but it's ultimately ruined with such a crapola ending that it somewhat ruins the whole movie. The acting isn't all that great either. While I haven't seen every movie made by After Dark Horrorfest; Nightmare Man is probably the worst out of all of them I've seen.

Blythe Metz. She is a very hot babe with a curvy body who also just happens to be a
pretty good actress. She is excellent playing the psychotic babe. This is a pretty good
horror flick. It is a little cheap on the make-up and special effects but the story
and acting are decent. Very much worth the VOD rental price.",1288483200,,406,4.151898734177215
3028343,2,B000YDZPMG,"I'm not sure what this film was trying to accomplish.  The acting and story are so amateurish and cheesy, that you wonder if you're supposed to laugh or in fact be scared.  The ""villain"" isn't scary as much as he is ridiculous looking.  The film looks very low budget and the story is beyond stupid.  The movie does take a few alright twists about an hour in, but that's far too late to save it (although it did save it from a 1 star rating).  There are also attempts it seems at eroticism, but it pretty much fails.

I went into this film actually expecting to enjoy it, even after reading many negative reviews and comments about it.  I wasn't watching it to make fun of it like so many have done, yet I can't help but to do so after the fact.  Stay away from this one, it's certainly the low end of the After Dark Horror Fest series and that's not saying much.  Once again with every review, I have to recommend ""Borderlands"" and ""Frontiers"" for those interested in some of the better After Dark films.",1285200000,,1005,4.303191489361702
3028344,1,B000YDZPMG,"Nightmare Man is a cliche slasher flick with an ending that almost makes it okay, except that you can't make a bad, cliche movie ""okay"" so it doesn't. And this ending's foreshadowing was about as subtle as a hammer to the face.

Honestly, when I started watching this film I thought I was watching a porno. It begins with a buxom woman in pajamas sitting in an apartment babbling to an unseen man, delivering her lines as woodenly and unbearable as possible. Then in steps the man who is easily fifteen years older than her, is wearing only a towel, and talks like a Spaniard. I thought I'd been fooled and wasn't actually watching Nightmare Man!

Thankfully, they quickly read their cue cards to the part where they discuss this creepy fertility mask and I knew I had the right film.

The plot boils down to this: A couple have been trying to get pregnant and failing and this has driven the wife to imagining the mask has spawned evil, which soon turns to be true as she is attacked by a masked figure after being marooned in an out-of-gas car.

The first 35 minutes of this film was atrocious. And at right about the 35 minute mark the ending was completely obvious. Well, not the entire ending, they waited about another half hour to give you enough to realize the rest. So, as you wait for the heavy-handed foreshadowed ending, you sit through a typical slasher film. The woman flees the killer, runs into a group of 20somethings alone in a house in the middle of nowhere and together they barricade themselves as they are picked off one by one.

The final violent ending was fun to watch, unfortunately it was spelled out pretty clearly already so the fun of it had been stripped away.

Nightmare Man does do one thing right--it stays properly in line with the quality of about 95% of the rest of these After Dark Fest films. Unfortunately, that means its also crap.",1266796800,,1872,4.523668639053255
3028345,2,B000YDZPMG,"I will start by stating that I realize the After Dark Horror Fest movies are a vehicle for independent movies. That means these movies aren't exactly 80 million dollar blockbusters. However, I have seen several independent films that put the 80 million dollar blockbusters to shame.

Nightmare Man was a simple concept executed in a simple way.  The premise is that a married couple orders some sort of African fertility mask.  When the mask arrives, it's ""icky"" and they don't quite want to knock boots while wearing it.  All of a sudden the movie is a slasher flick with the killer wearing.....you guessed it, the mask.  The transition between story building (about 2 minutes) to full out slasher flick is done so abruptly that you barely know what just happened.  The rest of the movie is just a slasher flick with zero originality.

Lets start with the mask.  It just wasn't scary.  It was goofy.  It had horns and was a dark color with pointy teeth and weird eyes.  Nothing spooky about it in my opinion. It looked kind of funny being worn while chasing the damsel in distress. The kills were unoriginal.  Same kills you would see in practically any slasher film.  Makeup was basic and not believable.  Acting was over the top, characters were ""characters"" not people.  Even the opening credits looked like something out of a high school project.

I hate to bash a horror movie, because horror movies are one of my loves in life.  Nightmare Man was just too simple and unoriginal.  They could take that same exact story and do so much better with it.  They could make the mask more interesting.  They could work on more natural acting style.  They could practice the makeup techniques more.  They could figure out more interesting kills.  There is a ton of potential, but they just didn't live up to it.",1260489600,,1808,4.687898089171974
3028346,2,B000YDZPMG,"And it's really not worth watching for either.  The nudity is short-lived and tedious, and your hard-earned money is better spent elsewhere.  A predictable plot had the Significant Other announcing that he's got a future in Hollywood churning out bad screenplays by the stack, and I was stuck pointing a white cheddar cheesy poof at the television screen within 15 minutes and asking, ""Do you think it'll be that person?  Hmmm?  What are the odds....""

I do love Trapped in a Cabin types of films (no, I don't know why) and I was thrilled to see the cabineers fighting back with unusual aplomb.  You go, girl!  On the other hand, I question whether or not one can die from a single bolt through the throat, and I'm almost certain that you'll live (miserably) if you have a knife shoved through the bottom of your jaw straight upwards, but I suppose if that happened to me, I'd collapse in a pile and give up right there.

These After Dark movies are turning out to be quite a disappointment.  About one in eight is worth watching, and those are some nasty odds.  These folks are clearly given a bit of funding, and there's no excuse for churning out this dreck over and over again.  Really.",1255651200,,1190,4.539906103286385
3028347,4,B000YDZPMG,"The After Dark horror series remains a mixed bag.  I haven't seen all of them, but the handful I've seen have been just OK at best.  That is until I saw ""Nightmare Man"".
Sure, it's low budget(all the After Dark films are), but it's a fun variation on the slasher genre.  A lot of the reviews on here complain about the acting.  In actuality it's not bad for a low budget horror movie.  Does anyone really expect Oscar worthy material in a movie called ""Nightmare Man""?
In short, ""Nightmare Man"" is a campy, occasionally clever little film.  It doesn't take itself too seriously, and it moves along at a good pace.  What more can you ask for in a LionsGate video?  More movies like this, for starters.",1250640000,3,700,4.456692913385827
3028348,3,B000YDZPMG,"The first thing I want to say is that I did enjoy this movie.  It was a clever blend of Evil Dead, a revenge plot and standard gore fare.  This is by no means a putdown as overall I did find this movie entertaining.  Was it great? No.  Was it horrible? No.  So what was it about you may be asking, well, the premise of the film is that a woman orders a fertility mask for her husband because he can't seem to get it up.  Maybe he needs some Extenze or Viagra, but no it's a fertility mask that supposed to correct this issue.  Whatever, it's horror it doesn't always have to be plausible.  She freaks out when she sees the mask and wants it out of her sight.

Anyway, she and her husband start on a vacation to get away for a while when the car runs out of gas.  He goes off hiking to get some gas and she is attacked by someone in this mask, there is more build up to this but essentially that's when things start to go haywire.

From there we are treated to a lot of gore murders and some really goofy lines by a group of people that are staying in a cabin close by playing some erotic truth or dare games.  Our lady stumbles upon this party and then the plot starts to unwind.

Things I liked about this flick:
Fast Moving - Decent Special Effects - Comedic Scenes - Some Surprises

Things I didn't like:
Poor Lighting - many scenes seem completely washed out and it makes it hard to see what's happening
Predictable Plot Overall - having seen my share of horror the plot is obvious from early on but there is a surprise

I would recommend this movie though if you want to have a fun time.  It's not fantastic but it will provide some entertainment for it's running time.  This is also one of the few discs that actually provides you with behind the scenes and more.  It looks like the cast and crew had fun shooting this and the bonus footage is fun to watch.

Check it out, it's not a masterpiece but it is a nice distraction.",1232323200,8,1931,4.128686327077748
3028349,1,B000YDZPMG,"Don't let my review title confuse you:  this movie was a nightmare in the WORST way.  One of 2008's Eight Films to Die From, er For, this was my first installment.  I'm hoping the other seven will be better.

We start off with a young woman getting an African fertility mask--from Rome.  Guess they were all out of stock in Africa.  Anyway, seems she and her husband are having troubles--albeit he can't PERFORM.  What that has to do with a fertility mask escapes me, but I digress.  So she thinks the mask is grotesque, and throws it in the floor.  The next thing you know, she's taking a shower (nudge, nudge; wink, wink) and the lights go out, and she's scared, and she's running around the house, and it's pitch black outside (when not two minutes ago it was broad daylight), and then she...ZZZZZZzzzzzzz.  You get the idea.

Nightmare Man has absolutely nothing going for it.  If you can't figure it out in the first five minutes, you need to turn in your horror card.  It wasn't funny.  It wasn't campy.  It wasn't suspenseful.  It wasn't scary.  It wasn't much of anything.  The acting (as would be expected in most of these ""period pieces,"") was atrocious.  The husband had the acting range of a turnip.  The remainder of the cast, while still not having the stage presence of a rock, were a little better than he was.

Horribly directed by Rolfe Kanefsky (and edited even worse), the film is rated R for ridiculous, some feisty situations, and nudity.  I would recommend having an amputation performed sans anethesia before I would recommend this movie.",1227225600,4,1562,4.644688644688645

I watch these movies for the pure enjoyment of watching such a terribly horrible film. The ideas that the Horror Fest movies come up with are a lot of fun. Me and my buddies watched Nightmare Man with incredible enjoyment because it made us LAUGH out loud the entire time. It was so freaking hilarious.

That's where the plot took a turn I wasn't expecting (someone else might but not me) and I thought this is really dumb and almost turned it off.  Well I did not turn it off and I was rewarded because the final 20 mintues or so supplied an ending I for sure did not see coming and raised this above the 2 star rating I had in mind for it.

NIGHTMARE MAN is one of the more entertaining of the Horrorfest 2007 movies.  There is some nudity in this one and every female in it takes off her shirt at least once.

3028357,2,B000YDZPMG,"I usually reserve one star for films that are virtually impossible to watch, and by that measure, Monster Man achieves two stars. It's film quality and camera work is at least competent, the story moves along at a quick pace, and there is a handful of eye candy, if that's your thing. However, you'll not find this set of actors anywhere near your local multiplex, more likely in late night Cinemax fare.

The story revolves around a couple who obtain a grotesque mask supposed to improve their chances of conception (really, I didn't make this up). The woman has violent nightmares about the man in the mask that lead to a decision to have her hospitalized at a mental institution. While the couple is on the way there, the car sputters, leaving him to find help and her to wait in the car alone, eventually winding up in a cabin inhabited by, what else, partying 20-somethings.

There is much killing, little real acting (painful at moments), a fare amount of blood, and a whole lot of familiar plot turns. Somewhere in here is a decent story waiting to get out, but the screenwriter just isn't able to do it. You'll know very soon what is going on, despite attempts to cover it up, and the ending won't be much of a surprise to horror aficionados.

Wearing a mask that's African
Too bad that his killing plans
scare nobody.""

First off, a general warning regarding this year's crop of Horrorfest films on DVD.  They all have the same menus, which consist of the viewer driving in to a drive-in.  Then the menu options come up on the movie screen along with snippets from the movie.  I have not been paying attention to these, because I push play at the earliest opportunity, but while putting away my popcorn after watching the film I noticed that these snippets really give away too much of the film.  You might say that in this case that is not a bad thing, but on general principle you should avoid such spoilers, especially if you have managed to make it to that point without knowing anything about the film besides the title.

""Nightmare Man"" is what I would categorize as a drunken frat boy film.  By that appellation I mean that it is not intended for the aficionado of horror films, but for those who like to leer at scantily dressed women and laugh at the blood and gore.  That is not to suggest that this is not a desirable demographic if you want to make money off of a horror film, but that I never filled out an application.  However, that constitutes a line of demarcation that will dictate your response to this film, as evidenced by the other reviews for this 2006 film.  If you do not like tongue-in-cheek horror films or think that this one walks too fine of a line in that regard, then you are not going to like this one and you should know that from the start.  Still, the cast is decent and the women all act sexy rather than just look sexy, which is why the aforementioned drunken frat boys will love this film.

Ellen Morris (Blythe Metz) and her husband William (Luciano Szafir) are trying to conceive a child, so she orders a fertility mask that turns out to be to creepy.  The next thing we know Bill is driving Ellen to a mental hospital because she insists she has been attacked by the ""Nightmare Man.""  Then the car runs out of gas and Ellen is left alone.  For a while wirter-driector Rolfe Kanefsky (maker of such unrated driected to video fare as ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Erotic-Misadventures-of-the-Invisible-Man/dp/B0000C2ITQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Erotic Misadventures of the Invisible Man</a>"", ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jacqueline-Hyde/dp/B000AOEMT6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jacqueline Hyde</a>"") is covering the same ground as last year's Horrorfest entry ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Penny-Dreadful/dp/B000MEYKE6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Penny Dreadful</a>,"" as the Nightmare man shows up and tries to kill Ellen.  But in fleeing from the killer Ellen stumbles upon a cabin in which two couples, Mia (Tiffany Shepis) & Ed (Jack Sway) and Trinity (Hanna Putnam) & Jack (James Ferris), are  engaging in their own version of couples therapy.  Now we know that Ellen will not just be the appetizer on this mania's menu and the killing can begin in earnest.  The problem is when we get to the final act and the film reverses engines full from tongue-in-cheek to a scene that many viewers might find disturbing (if not offensive).  I was giving the film the benefit of the doubt to that point, but I had to round down because I thought it was way too late to try and have it both ways in this movie.

As you watch this film the identity of the Nightmare Man is so obvious that it becomes too obvious, which makes you question what is really going on.  There does indeed turn out to be a twist, but then the twist gets reversed and the movie gets derailed.  Viewers not in the drunken frat boy category are going to be rolling their eyes at this point and inquire as the cognitive processes of the director.  Otherwise, this is a film that wants to have its sex and violence too, represented by the cutting back and forth between Ellen being attacked in the woods and the game of Truth or Dare being played in the cabin.  Then there is the way sex (that is to say, nudity) are used to set up the first death, even before the victim says their ironic last words.  But for me the burning question is this: I understand that anybody can pick up a knife and figure out what to do with it, but how many people could pick up a bow and arrow they find in the woods and start shooting rapid fire bullseyes?  (Amazing what you will focus on as being unbelievable in a horror film, huh?).

This is one of only three Horrorfest DVDs this time around that actual have bonus features beyond the Miss Horrorfest Contest webepisodes, which speaks more to Kanfesky and Shepis being old hands in the horror genre than anything else.  There is a ""Flubbing a Nightmare"" gag reel that is pretty lame, some extended scenes that show nothing important was left on the cutting room floor (but do give you another chance to see Shepis's strip tease and Putnam's fake orgasm), and a stills gallery.  ""Creating a Nightmare"" is the standard ""making of"" featurette and then we get ""Tiffany's Behind the Scenes"" bit (actually introduced as ""Tiffany's Behind........the Scenes""), which is pretty much what you would expect if you give Tiffany Shepis a video camera during the film's down time.  Shepis, Kanfesky and producer Esther Goodstein laugh their way through the commentary track.  Final Note: If you are a Richard Moll fan you are going to have to wait for the end for him to pop up (Why is he even in the movie?  Because he lives in Big Bear where the movie was shot).

3028361,1,B000YDZPMG,"I rarely take the time to write bad horror movie reviews, but after renting this movie and seeing how terrible the film was, I just could not resist.

First of all, this is the only film from this years After Dark Horror Fest, I have actually rented so far, so do not associate this review with any of the other films from this years After Dark Horror Fest.

The first 15 minutes of the film is actually all I could tolerate because of how many things are wrong with this film. I've probably only watched 3 or 4 horror films in my lifetime that have been so horrible that I couldn't stand watching more than 15 minutes of and this is one of them. From the opening scene you get a hint at how bad this film is going to be. The actors move and act like the same actors that are currently on very crappy daytime soap operas, yes it's that bad. The movie looks as though it has been shot using a camcorder that you would record a high school sporting event with. It's hard to look at terrible actors who are being shot with such a low budget camera. After 15 minutes, I couldn't take anymore and I had to shut it off.

From reading the back cover the story sounds interesting and would probably make for a good film if better actors and better camera work were used. Unfortunetly it was not the case with this movie. I don't remember any of the movies from last year's Horror Fest looking this poorly shot, so I was really shocked to see this in a Horror Fest film.",1206230400,4,1461,4.210714285714285
3028362,1,B000YDZPMG,"Remember the episode of Seinfeld, where while standing in line to see ""Rochelle, Rochelle"" Elaine says guys will sit through anything for an hour and a half just to see breasts?  That seems to be the case for the positive reviews of this flick from young teen guys that can't get their hands on Girls Gone Wild videos and manage to buy DVDs like Nightmare Man, gush mainly about the hot chicks and boobs, but not about much else that really matters.  They're easily distracted by the nudity so they don't care about the lack of thrills and can claim they're watching a ""legitimate"" movie in case their parents ask about it. Hey, I love naked people, but when it's just a distraction tool from the lack of scares, humor, or PLOT, it's a cheap shot.

Oh, the plot: a woman with mental problems eats pills as often as Tic Tacs and claims to be chased by the Nightmare Man (""That mask is HORRIBLE"" she keeps exclaiming, and she's right -- it's just a terrible cheap mask that induces laughter instead of fear out of the viewer).  She meets up with two horny young couples in a luxury ""cabin"" in the woods where the gals find numerous ways to be seen undressed.  Killer shows up.  There ya have it.

I went in with an open mind and found myself losing hope within the first 10 minutes. Nothing scary, and we're already treated to two naked shots of Ellen.  I just knew then where this film was going.  Good thing this DVD was a part of a set I got, as any price listed for it cannot be justified. I've known many who've walked out on this one when it was in theatres as part of the Horrorfest and I can fully understand why.

About 20 years after There's Nothing Out There, you'd think writer/director Rolfe Kanefsky would have improved on his craft.  Most of the budget on that first flick went to the then state-of-the-art opening credits, leaving the rest of the film to naked girls and general lack of scares and wit.  All these years later, Nightmare Man has nice opening credits and the same old thing: naked girls and lack of scares and wit.  The really sad thing is this was intended to be a serious, if ""b-horror"" flick.  Kanefsky says he's very proud of this project.  But he just didn't try to give us anything different nor original.  No attempt to make a decent presentation: bad lighting, extreme acting, lazy dialogue, poor synth score and bad special effects.  Low-grade effects included Ellen cutting her wrist with a knife but with blood ALREADY on her wrist and looking like thick orange-red paint.  The color was NOT set wrong on my TV.  And that chase through the woods near the beginning?  On and on and on and on it went.

All in all, nothing new here, no surprises.  It's as if Kanefsky figured his loyal fan base would blindly praise and support anything he makes.  Apparently they do, as someone keeps funding these projects and the DVDs keep coming.

Easily the worst of the 2007 After Dark Horrorfest along with Lake Dead.  As Ellen kept annoyingly screaming, ""Where are my pills?  Where are my PILLS??""  I felt I needed some pills too from this viewing experience...but was just left with the sound of frogs croaking, a Kanefsky trademark.  One can't help but feel insulted from that.",1206057600,,3208,4.512998266897747
3028363,1,B000YDZPMG,"I hate to give movies such a low rating since I can usually find at least a few things I like about them but this one is an exception. There was not much if anything I could enjoy about this movie.

  The movie begins with Ellen getting some weird mask in the mail,suppose to be a fertility god mask or something. Later that night we see her running through the house with a man in this masc chasing her. He is about to catch her when she wakes up as it was just a dream. We then see her in a car with her husband as he is taking her to a mental institution because she's been having many disturbing dreams and believes nightmare man is after her and is indeed real. We all should guess what happens next. Their car runs out of gas in the middle of the woods and of course they have no cell phone reception there so her husband decides to walk about 10 miles to the gas station. She stays in the car and eventually it gets dark and she sees nightmare man in the woods. Soon after he is trying to get her while she's in the car. She is able to get away and nightmare man pursues her into the woods.

 We then meet 4 young characters at a house in the woods. Jack and his fiancee Trinity along with Mia and her boyfriend Ed. They are playing erotic truth or dare(lame).They think they hear something and go outside to look and see nothing. Just as they are about to back inside they hear screaming as Ellen escapes nightmare man and they let her inside. She is all bruised and tells them a man is chasing her and going to kill her. Eventually Jack calls her husbands cell phone and he lets Jack know that his wife is schizophrenic and that there is no one chasing her. Eventually Ellen tells them she's dropped her pills outside and if she doesn't go get them they will all die. This is where it starts to get really ridiculous. Ed is eventually killed by nightmare man,nightmare man break in and kills Jacks fiancee and is able to dodge 4 shots point blank and then reappears killing Jack. After this Ellen's husband shows up and then decides to go outside looking for Ellen's pills. He goes back to his car and nigthmare man is sitting in the backseat. Or is it?

  Without giving the ending way I can only say it is really lame and almost funny. Had this been intended to be a horror comedy from the start instead of trying to come across seriously it might have worked it a little better. I thought this after dark horror fest was too frightening and disturbing for theaters.

3262801,1,B000YDZPMG,"I went to see ""Nightmare Man"" with my father, and about halfway through, I actually had to lean towards his ear and apologize to him. I wasn't sorry for the time we were spending together, but I sure as hell was sorry for the film we had to sit through. The number of levels this movie sucks on is amazing: it's unoriginal, predictable, badly scripted, badly acted, miscast, uneven, unimaginative, and--perhaps worst of all--not at all scary. This movie had all the charisma of a direct to video shocker produced and filmed by amateurs, and that's an insult to amateurs since they probably could do a much better job. I don't know who thought it was a good idea to make this film, but whoever it is needs to see more movies and see them frequently; anyone appreciative of the cinematic arts would never let their own film project stoop to this level.

""Nightmare Man"" opens with a dream sequence, in which a woman named Ellen (Blythe Metz) is stalked by a demon wearing a green devil mask (which she bought thinking it was symbolic of fertility). She runs through her darkened house, clad in only her bathrobe, while her Italian husband, William (Luciano Szafir), is off trying to restore the power. Just as the demon is about to catch her, she awakens in the passenger seat of her husband's car, after which she panics because she's late in taking her medication. William is driving Ellen to a mental institution because she's been having frequent, disturbing dreams, and she's convinced that the demon chasing her--the Nightmare Man--is real. She's also convinced that no one, not even doctors, will be able to help her. All she has is her pills to keep herself under control, which is interesting since they bear a striking resemblance to Tic Tacs.

Ellen and William's drive leads them into the woods, and it's there that the car runs out of gas. Stranded and without a working cell phone, William opts to walk back to a far away gas station for help. Ellen, of course, stays in the car. By the time it gets dark, her fears begin to take hold, and she can't help but feel that someone is out in the woods, waiting for her. And as it turns out, someone is in the woods. Clad in the green fertility mask, the Nightmare Man chases Ellen through the woods; he even catches her a few times, which makes me wonder how she managed to avoid being killed.

Meanwhile, at a cabin nestled deep in the woods, we meet four young characters: Jack (James Ferris); his fiance, Trinity (Hanna Putnam); Mia (Tiffany Shepis); and her boyfriend, Ed (Jack Sway). These characters are introduced playing Erotic Truth or Dare, and from that alone, you should have a pretty good idea of what they represent. This is especially true of Mia, whose foulmouthed, oversexed, and sarcastic, even when the occasion doesn't call for it. When they think they hear a noise from the woods, Mia grabs her crossbow and steps outside, not seeming to care that she's wearing nothing but lacy black underwear and a bra. To borrow a phrase from Dr. Seuss, she has all the tender sweetness of a seasick crocodile.

And that's when Ellen finds them. Lost, alone, and desperate for help, Ellen rants and raves about the evil that's out there, about how the Nightmare Man has actually escaped from inside of her and become real. Of course, no one believes her until he actually starts attacking. Thus begins the slasher portion of the film, the monotony of which is broken when Ellen realizes that she's lost her pills. Yes, we all know how it feels to not have medication around when we need it--sitting in the theater, I wanted an aspirin, but silly me, I left them all at home. Next time I'll know better.

Or maybe I won't. Sometimes, you don't know just how bad a movie will be before you see it; all you can do is go into it cold and hope for the best. That was certainly the case with ""Nightmare Man."" Had I known I would be watching something this pitiful, something this unbelievably ill conceived ... but why dwell on what I had no control over? That's just negative thinking, and as Mia screams at Ellen, ""I want you to say something positive! Tell a story that begins with `Once upon a time,' and ends with, `Happily ever after'!"" Sound advice, wouldn't you say? And why not? Mia holds a shotgun as she says this while Ellen is bound to a sofa by her wrists and ankles.

That moment paves the way for the final fifteen minutes, which goes in such a different direction that it seemed to belong in another movie. But considering the skill level of the filmmakers, this should come as no surprise at all. ""Nightmare Man"" functions at the same level as a carnival funhouse, full of dark corridors, random spooky noises, and pop out scares so unconvincing that we laugh instead of scream. I'm tempted to recommend this film as a parody, but since it was actually taking itself seriously, I know that would be the wrong thing to do. This isn't a spoof--it's only a bad movie starring untalented actors and made by untalented filmmakers.",1194739200,10,5002,4.589485458612975

The creature in the show is the same as the Jumbee/Dybbuk of the movie Unborn and the Babadook of the movie Babadook. They are also called the Brahma Rakshasa of India. In west Africa they are called Ajo Nnu Nu (evil birds). The native Americans like the Lakota called them Thunder beings. They are also called tree dwellers and forest spirits. The god Pan is a similar entity. These are the same creatures being referenced under different name. They have many more names. So if you watch the movie from that perspective you will see that the movie makers are very knowledgeable of their topic and incorporated a lot of information about these entities and how they are said to behave.,1476057600,,801,4.531034482758621

3262810,5,B000YDZPMG,"I have been a fan of the 8 to Die For series since i saw Frontiers & have been collecting them ever since,some are hit or miss but this film here is amazing.
It starts off with a couple with fertility issues,so a mask comes in the mail(supposedly the wrong mask) & right from the start things go wrong. Apparently a mask holds a demonic power to it,so the guy takes his wife on a ride to the psyche hospital. He keeps the mask in the trunk for the therapy that is to come. The car breaks down & the battery of the cell died so she is out there alone with ""the nightmare man"" while her husband tries to take a walk to get gas. There are spoilers coming....there are a group of people in a cabin sharing a weekend of premiscuous games & partying before 1 of the couples marries. So the group of 4 people are having fun as the party gets going & the girl seeing the nightmare man runs into the cabin with the partygoers. The girl really does see the man in the mask,which is a guy who is wearing the mask & is paid to kill the crazy wife. Well turns out that bodies turn up left and right and the demon really comes outta the girl seeing the nightmare man(who is OBSESSED with taking her pills) Well needless to say she does not get her pills & the real demon is unleashed,tearing through the party members  1by 1 as well as the hitman & her husband. The demon is left to confront the head owner of the cabin(Tiffany Shepis) and the demon is forced from the body & it's spirit goes into Tiffany Shepis. She is left alone,the sole survivor babbling about demons & she is put in the nuthouse. She is just like the original girl,she needs the pills to keep the demon at bay....but the dr's don't believe her & they take her off the meds. So in summation,the film is excellent...compared to some of the other 8 to Die For series(Unrest,Penny Dreadful,Wicked Little Things,Dark Ride) this has great acting,an excellent cast,lots of cool special effects & good gore and plot twists. I recommend you get a copy,especially if you love Tiffany Shepis like i do.",1455408000,,2049,4.308290155440415

As someone who has had numerous personal relationships with many daemons, I was taken aback at the childish misrepresentation of my lovers from a different dimension.

3262825,2,B000YDZPMG,"Well, i'm glad it's back up on prime, so i didn't waste money watching this. This wasn't as bad as ""Unearthed"" (another after dark film).
The basic idea of the movie is, the husband cannot perform in bed, the wife gets a fertility mask, never returns it because she gets a shower and the next thing you know she is waking up in the car (okay something happens, but spoilers).
Apparently the mask is haunting her, and her husband is taking her to a mental hospital, and being a total jerk about it, seriously, this guy is a piece of , well you know.
So the car runs out of gas, he leaves her there (so she won't say ""i told you so"" the whole way, according to the husband. Now, if this hasn't peaked your interest, then don't watch it. The film gets darker, and by darker, i mean someone forgot to higher a lighting crew.
Now while the wife is running in the woods, you get introduced to a cast of forgettable characters, seriously, the cliche of playing truth or dare with sexual undertones (sound interesting? it's not)
Then the wife bursts in, and i'm not going to say anything else about that stuff.
So, there is a story, a plot, etc. Does any of this get resolved in a well written fashion? nope. The last twenty minutes are the most interesting (minus the final scenes, ugh). The acting is what you would expect, nothing exceptional. You don't really care about the characters, it's rather boring, poorly paced, and the ""twist"" didn't surprise me, i'm sorry.

3262832,2,B000YDZPMG,"I usually enjoy most of After Dark Horrorfest's movies. Borderland, Frontier(s), Deaths of Ian Stone, etc, but this may unfortunately have to be an exception.

The opening plot focuses on the main character, Ellen who lives with her husband, William. After Ellen orders an African fertility mask through the mail, she becomes plagued with haunting visions of a demonic supernatural entity named The Nightmare Man, who she believes is after her. Her husband and doctors believe she's paranoid and schizophrenic and give her pills to help control her condition.

As they travel to the mental institution one evening, the car breaks down in the woods and while William goes off in search of help, Ellen stays in the car and that's where The Nightmare Man shows up.

Overall: That's as much as I can give away without telling too much of the movie. In my opinion, Nightmare Man was a decent movie with a decent plot until we get around the last 15 minutes. Seriously, this movie takes such a ridiculous twist during the last 15 minutes, it'll have you shaking your head in disgust and disappointment, laughing at how stupid it is, and almost wishing you never even bothered watching it. The movie had potential to be great but it's ultimately ruined with such a crapola ending that it somewhat ruins the whole movie. The acting isn't all that great either.

I went into this film actually expecting to enjoy it, even after reading many negative reviews and comments about it.  I wasn't watching it to make fun of it like so many have done, yet I can't help but to do so after the fact.

3262841,1,B000YDZPMG,"Nightmare Man is a cliche slasher flick with an ending that almost makes it okay, except that you can't make a bad, cliche movie ""okay"" so it doesn't. And this ending's foreshadowing was about as subtle as a hammer to the face.

Honestly, when I started watching this film I thought I was watching a porno. It begins with a buxom woman in pajamas sitting in an apartment babbling to an unseen man, delivering her lines as woodenly and unbearable as possible. Then in steps the man who is easily fifteen years older than her, is wearing only a towel, and talks like a Spaniard. I thought I'd been fooled and wasn't actually watching Nightmare Man!

Thankfully, they quickly read their cue cards to the part where they discuss this creepy fertility mask and I knew I had the right film.

The plot boils down to this: A couple have been trying to get pregnant and failing and this has driven the wife to imagining the mask has spawned evil, which soon turns to be true as she is attacked by a masked figure after being marooned in an out-of-gas car.

The first 35 minutes of this film was atrocious. And at right about the 35 minute mark the ending was completely obvious. Well, not the entire ending, they waited about another half hour to give you enough to realize the rest. So, as you wait for the heavy-handed foreshadowed ending, you sit through a typical slasher film. The woman flees the killer, runs into a group of 20somethings alone in a house in the middle of nowhere and together they barricade themselves as they are picked off one by one.

The final violent ending was fun to watch, unfortunately it was spelled out pretty clearly already so the fun of it had been stripped away.

Nightmare Man does do one thing right--it stays properly in line with the quality of about 95% of the rest of these After Dark Fest films. Unfortunately, that means its also crap.",1266796800,,1872,4.523668639053255
3262842,2,B000YDZPMG,"I will start by stating that I realize the After Dark Horror Fest movies are a vehicle for independent movies. That means these movies aren't exactly 80 million dollar blockbusters. However, I have seen several independent films that put the 80 million dollar blockbusters to shame.

Nightmare Man was a simple concept executed in a simple way.  The premise is that a married couple orders some sort of African fertility mask.  When the mask arrives, it's ""icky"" and they don't quite want to knock boots while wearing it.  All of a sudden the movie is a slasher flick with the killer wearing.....you guessed it, the mask.  The transition between story building (about 2 minutes) to full out slasher flick is done so abruptly that you barely know what just happened.  The rest of the movie is just a slasher flick with zero originality.

Lets start with the mask.  It just wasn't scary.  It was goofy.  It had horns and was a dark color with pointy teeth and weird eyes.  Nothing spooky about it in my opinion. It looked kind of funny being worn while chasing the damsel in distress. The kills were unoriginal.  Same kills you would see in practically any slasher film.  Makeup was basic and not believable.  Acting was over the top, characters were ""characters"" not people.  Even the opening credits looked like something out of a high school project.

I hate to bash a horror movie, because horror movies are one of my loves in life.  Nightmare Man was just too simple and unoriginal.  They could take that same exact story and do so much better with it.  They could make the mask more interesting.  They could work on more natural acting style.  They could practice the makeup techniques more.  They could figure out more interesting kills.  There is a ton of potential, but they just didn't live up to it.",1260489600,,1808,4.687898089171974
3262843,2,B000YDZPMG,"And it's really not worth watching for either.  The nudity is short-lived and tedious, and your hard-earned money is better spent elsewhere.  A predictable plot had the Significant Other announcing that he's got a future in Hollywood churning out bad screenplays by the stack, and I was stuck pointing a white cheddar cheesy poof at the television screen within 15 minutes and asking, ""Do you think it'll be that person?  Hmmm?  What are the odds....""

I do love Trapped in a Cabin types of films (no, I don't know why) and I was thrilled to see the cabineers fighting back with unusual aplomb.  You go, girl!  On the other hand, I question whether or not one can die from a single bolt through the throat, and I'm almost certain that you'll live (miserably) if you have a knife shoved through the bottom of your jaw straight upwards, but I suppose if that happened to me, I'd collapse in a pile and give up right there.

These After Dark movies are turning out to be quite a disappointment.  About one in eight is worth watching, and those are some nasty odds.

Sure, it's low budget(all the After Dark films are), but it's a fun variation on the slasher genre.  A lot of the reviews on here complain about the acting.  In actuality it's not bad for a low budget horror movie.  Does anyone really expect Oscar worthy material in a movie called ""Nightmare Man""?
In short, ""Nightmare Man"" is a campy, occasionally clever little film.  It doesn't take itself too seriously, and it moves along at a good pace.  What more can you ask for in a LionsGate video?  More movies like this, for starters.",1250640000,3,700,4.456692913385827
3262845,3,B000YDZPMG,"The first thing I want to say is that I did enjoy this movie.  It was a clever blend of Evil Dead, a revenge plot and standard gore fare.  This is by no means a putdown as overall I did find this movie entertaining.  Was it great? No.  Was it horrible? No.  So what was it about you may be asking, well, the premise of the film is that a woman orders a fertility mask for her husband because he can't seem to get it up.  Maybe he needs some Extenze or Viagra, but no it's a fertility mask that supposed to correct this issue.  Whatever, it's horror it doesn't always have to be plausible.  She freaks out when she sees the mask and wants it out of her sight.

Anyway, she and her husband start on a vacation to get away for a while when the car runs out of gas.  He goes off hiking to get some gas and she is attacked by someone in this mask, there is more build up to this but essentially that's when things start to go haywire.

From there we are treated to a lot of gore murders and some really goofy lines by a group of people that are staying in a cabin close by playing some erotic truth or dare games.  Our lady stumbles upon this party and then the plot starts to unwind.

Things I liked about this flick:
Fast Moving - Decent Special Effects - Comedic Scenes - Some Surprises

Things I didn't like:
Poor Lighting - many scenes seem completely washed out and it makes it hard to see what's happening
Predictable Plot Overall - having seen my share of horror the plot is obvious from early on but there is a surprise

I would recommend this movie though if you want to have a fun time.  It's not fantastic but it will provide some entertainment for it's running time.  This is also one of the few discs that actually provides you with behind the scenes and more.  It looks like the cast and crew had fun shooting this and the bonus footage is fun to watch.

3262846,1,B000YDZPMG,"Don't let my review title confuse you:  this movie was a nightmare in the WORST way.  One of 2008's Eight Films to Die From, er For, this was my first installment.  I'm hoping the other seven will be better.

We start off with a young woman getting an African fertility mask--from Rome.  Guess they were all out of stock in Africa.  Anyway, seems she and her husband are having troubles--albeit he can't PERFORM.  What that has to do with a fertility mask escapes me, but I digress.  So she thinks the mask is grotesque, and throws it in the floor.  The next thing you know, she's taking a shower (nudge, nudge; wink, wink) and the lights go out, and she's scared, and she's running around the house, and it's pitch black outside (when not two minutes ago it was broad daylight), and then she...ZZZZZZzzzzzzz.  You get the idea.

Nightmare Man has absolutely nothing going for it.  If you can't figure it out in the first five minutes, you need to turn in your horror card.  It wasn't funny.  It wasn't campy.  It wasn't suspenseful.  It wasn't scary.  It wasn't much of anything.  The acting (as would be expected in most of these ""period pieces,"") was atrocious.  The husband had the acting range of a turnip.  The remainder of the cast, while still not having the stage presence of a rock, were a little better than he was.

Horribly directed by Rolfe Kanefsky (and edited even worse), the film is rated R for ridiculous, some feisty situations, and nudity.  I would recommend having an amputation performed sans anethesia before I would recommend this movie.",1227225600,4,1562,4.644688644688645

First of all, if you are thinking of purchasing this movie for the pure enjoyment of a good horror flick, FORGET IT. This movie's plot line is damaged beyond repair. The actors are bellow par, at best.

I watch these movies for the pure enjoyment of watching such a terribly horrible film. The ideas that the Horror Fest movies come up with are a lot of fun. Me and my buddies watched Nightmare Man with incredible enjoyment because it made us LAUGH out loud the entire time. It was so freaking hilarious. Every moment is beyond predictable and the twist at the end... well... let's just say it's as if it came straight out of a ""Scary Movie"" sequel.

3262851,4,B000YDZPMG,"This movie was a pretty typical thriller with the cast of young sexy cannon fodder getting picked off one by because they do stupid things like go out for some fresh air when a mad killer is lurking about.  Oh well, the girls were nice to look at.  Anyway, it was pretty obvious what was going on here and then we reached the 69 minute mark.  That's where the plot took a turn I wasn't expecting (someone else might but not me) and I thought this is really dumb and almost turned it off.  Well I did not turn it off and I was rewarded because the final 20 mintues or so supplied an ending I for sure did not see coming and raised this above the 2 star rating I had in mind for it.  NIGHTMARE MAN is not a great movie by any stretch of the imagination but for a lights out viewing with some friends and some snacks, this one delivers the goods and is not a bad way to spend 90 minutes.  NIGHTMARE MAN is one of the more entertaining of the Horrorfest 2007 movies.  There is some nudity in this one and every female in it takes off her shirt at least once. Most of the time it's done just for the sake of showing off for the camera.  I won't give away the ending, but it's not typical of the Horrorfest movie endings, where everything is usually wrapped up nice and neatly for the forces of good.",1208736000,7,1294,4.086956521739131

The setting of the house in the woods is a fave of mine, but the chases through the woods were terrible. I think it had to do with the budget, maybe it would have turned out better if he stalked, not ran throught the trees.

3262854,2,B000YDZPMG,"I usually reserve one star for films that are virtually impossible to watch, and by that measure, Monster Man achieves two stars. It's film quality and camera work is at least competent, the story moves along at a quick pace, and there is a handful of eye candy, if that's your thing. However, you'll not find this set of actors anywhere near your local multiplex, more likely in late night Cinemax fare.

The story revolves around a couple who obtain a grotesque mask supposed to improve their chances of conception (really, I didn't make this up). The woman has violent nightmares about the man in the mask that lead to a decision to have her hospitalized at a mental institution. While the couple is on the way there, the car sputters, leaving him to find help and her to wait in the car alone, eventually winding up in a cabin inhabited by, what else, partying 20-somethings.

There is much killing, little real acting (painful at moments), a fare amount of blood, and a whole lot of familiar plot turns. Somewhere in here is a decent story waiting to get out, but the screenwriter just isn't able to do it. You'll know very soon what is going on, despite attempts to cover it up, and the ending won't be much of a surprise to horror aficionados. You could do worse for mindless late night fun, but I'd look to other horrorfest films like Mulberry Street or Borderland instead of this.",1206489600,5,1389,4.57429718875502

Wearing a mask that's African
Too bad that his killing plans
scare nobody.""

First off, a general warning regarding this year's crop of Horrorfest films on DVD.  They all have the same menus, which consist of the viewer driving in to a drive-in.  Then the menu options come up on the movie screen along with snippets from the movie.  I have not been paying attention to these, because I push play at the earliest opportunity, but while putting away my popcorn after watching the film I noticed that these snippets really give away too much of the film.  You might say that in this case that is not a bad thing, but on general principle you should avoid such spoilers, especially if you have managed to make it to that point without knowing anything about the film besides the title.

""Nightmare Man"" is what I would categorize as a drunken frat boy film.  By that appellation I mean that it is not intended for the aficionado of horror films, but for those who like to leer at scantily dressed women and laugh at the blood and gore.  That is not to suggest that this is not a desirable demographic if you want to make money off of a horror film, but that I never filled out an application.  However, that constitutes a line of demarcation that will dictate your response to this film, as evidenced by the other reviews for this 2006 film.  If you do not like tongue-in-cheek horror films or think that this one walks too fine of a line in that regard, then you are not going to like this one and you should know that from the start.  Still, the cast is decent and the women all act sexy rather than just look sexy, which is why the aforementioned drunken frat boys will love this film.

Ellen Morris (Blythe Metz) and her husband William (Luciano Szafir) are trying to conceive a child, so she orders a fertility mask that turns out to be to creepy.  The next thing we know Bill is driving Ellen to a mental hospital because she insists she has been attacked by the ""Nightmare Man.""  Then the car runs out of gas and Ellen is left alone.  For a while wirter-driector Rolfe Kanefsky (maker of such unrated driected to video fare as ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Erotic-Misadventures-of-the-Invisible-Man/dp/B0000C2ITQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Erotic Misadventures of the Invisible Man</a>"", ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jacqueline-Hyde/dp/B000AOEMT6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jacqueline Hyde</a>"") is covering the same ground as last year's Horrorfest entry ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Penny-Dreadful/dp/B000MEYKE6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Penny Dreadful</a>,"" as the Nightmare man shows up and tries to kill Ellen.  But in fleeing from the killer Ellen stumbles upon a cabin in which two couples, Mia (Tiffany Shepis) & Ed (Jack Sway) and Trinity (Hanna Putnam) & Jack (James Ferris), are  engaging in their own version of couples therapy.  Now we know that Ellen will not just be the appetizer on this mania's menu and the killing can begin in earnest.  The problem is when we get to the final act and the film reverses engines full from tongue-in-cheek to a scene that many viewers might find disturbing (if not offensive).  I was giving the film the benefit of the doubt to that point, but I had to round down because I thought it was way too late to try and have it both ways in this movie.

As you watch this film the identity of the Nightmare Man is so obvious that it becomes too obvious, which makes you question what is really going on.  There does indeed turn out to be a twist, but then the twist gets reversed and the movie gets derailed.  Viewers not in the drunken frat boy category are going to be rolling their eyes at this point and inquire as the cognitive processes of the director.  Otherwise, this is a film that wants to have its sex and violence too, represented by the cutting back and forth between Ellen being attacked in the woods and the game of Truth or Dare being played in the cabin.  Then there is the way sex (that is to say, nudity) are used to set up the first death, even before the victim says their ironic last words.  But for me the burning question is this: I understand that anybody can pick up a knife and figure out what to do with it, but how many people could pick up a bow and arrow they find in the woods and start shooting rapid fire bullseyes?  (Amazing what you will focus on as being unbelievable in a horror film, huh?).

This is one of only three Horrorfest DVDs this time around that actual have bonus features beyond the Miss Horrorfest Contest webepisodes, which speaks more to Kanfesky and Shepis being old hands in the horror genre than anything else.  There is a ""Flubbing a Nightmare"" gag reel that is pretty lame, some extended scenes that show nothing important was left on the cutting room floor (but do give you another chance to see Shepis's strip tease and Putnam's fake orgasm), and a stills gallery.  ""Creating a Nightmare"" is the standard ""making of"" featurette and then we get ""Tiffany's Behind the Scenes"" bit (actually introduced as ""Tiffany's Behind........the Scenes""), which is pretty much what you would expect if you give Tiffany Shepis a video camera during the film's down time.  Shepis, Kanfesky and producer Esther Goodstein laugh their way through the commentary track.  Final Note: If you are a Richard Moll fan you are going to have to wait for the end for him to pop up (Why is he even in the movie?  Because he lives in Big Bear where the movie was shot).

I'm not one to usually get stuck on points like cinematography and stuff but it was so distracting.  At one point I think they actually reversed the coloring in the background to look like a negative!

3262858,1,B000YDZPMG,"I rarely take the time to write bad horror movie reviews, but after renting this movie and seeing how terrible the film was, I just could not resist.

First of all, this is the only film from this years After Dark Horror Fest, I have actually rented so far, so do not associate this review with any of the other films from this years After Dark Horror Fest.

The first 15 minutes of the film is actually all I could tolerate because of how many things are wrong with this film. I've probably only watched 3 or 4 horror films in my lifetime that have been so horrible that I couldn't stand watching more than 15 minutes of and this is one of them. From the opening scene you get a hint at how bad this film is going to be. The actors move and act like the same actors that are currently on very crappy daytime soap operas, yes it's that bad. The movie looks as though it has been shot using a camcorder that you would record a high school sporting event with. It's hard to look at terrible actors who are being shot with such a low budget camera. After 15 minutes, I couldn't take anymore and I had to shut it off.

From reading the back cover the story sounds interesting and would probably make for a good film if better actors and better camera work were used. Unfortunetly it was not the case with this movie. I don't remember any of the movies from last year's Horror Fest looking this poorly shot, so I was really shocked to see this in a Horror Fest film.",1206230400,4,1461,4.210714285714285
3262859,1,B000YDZPMG,"Remember the episode of Seinfeld, where while standing in line to see ""Rochelle, Rochelle"" Elaine says guys will sit through anything for an hour and a half just to see breasts?  That seems to be the case for the positive reviews of this flick from young teen guys that can't get their hands on Girls Gone Wild videos and manage to buy DVDs like Nightmare Man, gush mainly about the hot chicks and boobs, but not about much else that really matters.  They're easily distracted by the nudity so they don't care about the lack of thrills and can claim they're watching a ""legitimate"" movie in case their parents ask about it. Hey, I love naked people, but when it's just a distraction tool from the lack of scares, humor, or PLOT, it's a cheap shot.

Oh, the plot: a woman with mental problems eats pills as often as Tic Tacs and claims to be chased by the Nightmare Man (""That mask is HORRIBLE"" she keeps exclaiming, and she's right -- it's just a terrible cheap mask that induces laughter instead of fear out of the viewer).  She meets up with two horny young couples in a luxury ""cabin"" in the woods where the gals find numerous ways to be seen undressed.  Killer shows up.  There ya have it.

I went in with an open mind and found myself losing hope within the first 10 minutes. Nothing scary, and we're already treated to two naked shots of Ellen.  I just knew then where this film was going.  Good thing this DVD was a part of a set I got, as any price listed for it cannot be justified. I've known many who've walked out on this one when it was in theatres as part of the Horrorfest and I can fully understand why.

About 20 years after There's Nothing Out There, you'd think writer/director Rolfe Kanefsky would have improved on his craft.  Most of the budget on that first flick went to the then state-of-the-art opening credits, leaving the rest of the film to naked girls and general lack of scares and wit.  All these years later, Nightmare Man has nice opening credits and the same old thing: naked girls and lack of scares and wit.  The really sad thing is this was intended to be a serious, if ""b-horror"" flick.  Kanefsky says he's very proud of this project.  But he just didn't try to give us anything different nor original.  No attempt to make a decent presentation: bad lighting, extreme acting, lazy dialogue, poor synth score and bad special effects.  Low-grade effects included Ellen cutting her wrist with a knife but with blood ALREADY on her wrist and looking like thick orange-red paint.  The color was NOT set wrong on my TV.  And that chase through the woods near the beginning?  On and on and on and on it went.

All in all, nothing new here, no surprises.  It's as if Kanefsky figured his loyal fan base would blindly praise and support anything he makes.  Apparently they do, as someone keeps funding these projects and the DVDs keep coming.

Easily the worst of the 2007 After Dark Horrorfest along with Lake Dead.  As Ellen kept annoyingly screaming, ""Where are my pills?  Where are my PILLS??""  I felt I needed some pills too from this viewing experience...but was just left with the sound of frogs croaking, a Kanefsky trademark.  One can't help but feel insulted from that.",1206057600,,3208,4.512998266897747
3262860,1,B000YDZPMG,"I hate to give movies such a low rating since I can usually find at least a few things I like about them but this one is an exception. There was not much if anything I could enjoy about this movie.

  The movie begins with Ellen getting some weird mask in the mail,suppose to be a fertility god mask or something. Later that night we see her running through the house with a man in this masc chasing her. He is about to catch her when she wakes up as it was just a dream. We then see her in a car with her husband as he is taking her to a mental institution because she's been having many disturbing dreams and believes nightmare man is after her and is indeed real. We all should guess what happens next. Their car runs out of gas in the middle of the woods and of course they have no cell phone reception there so her husband decides to walk about 10 miles to the gas station. She stays in the car and eventually it gets dark and she sees nightmare man in the woods. Soon after he is trying to get her while she's in the car. She is able to get away and nightmare man pursues her into the woods.

 We then meet 4 young characters at a house in the woods. Jack and his fiancee Trinity along with Mia and her boyfriend Ed. They are playing erotic truth or dare(lame).They think they hear something and go outside to look and see nothing. Just as they are about to back inside they hear screaming as Ellen escapes nightmare man and they let her inside. She is all bruised and tells them a man is chasing her and going to kill her. Eventually Jack calls her husbands cell phone and he lets Jack know that his wife is schizophrenic and that there is no one chasing her. Eventually Ellen tells them she's dropped her pills outside and if she doesn't go get them they will all die. This is where it starts to get really ridiculous. Ed is eventually killed by nightmare man,nightmare man break in and kills Jacks fiancee and is able to dodge 4 shots point blank and then reappears killing Jack. After this Ellen's husband shows up and then decides to go outside looking for Ellen's pills. He goes back to his car and nigthmare man is sitting in the backseat. Or is it?

  Without giving the ending way I can only say it is really lame and almost funny. Had this been intended to be a horror comedy from the start instead of trying to come across seriously it might have worked it a little better. I thought this after dark horror fest was too frightening and disturbing for theaters.
