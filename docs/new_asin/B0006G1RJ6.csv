8041437,5,B0006G1RJ6,"It is wonderful that I have Tony's DVD lessons.  I am a very slow learner and it is perfect for me.  I play it again and again.  And since I am alone while I watch and practice Tony's recommendations, I do not have to feel silly about all of my mistakes.  Thank you Tony!!!!",1483401600,2,274,4.018518518518518

8041442,2,B0006G1RJ6,"I bought this DVD after listening to Tony Rice and Dan Crary trade off on the song ""Cattle in the Cane"" on Dan's CD ""Jammed If I Do"", and his guitar performances on ""You Were There For Me"" with Peter Rowan.  On both of those albums he is very fluid and very versatile.  Unfortunately this DVD only has 5 songs in tablature on it, the rest of the time is spent with him talking about picks, capo's right hand position and the like...

That's fine if you want to be exactly like Tony Rice but as a purely instructional video, it falls flat.  It's less of an intimate lesson of his playing style, and more of a fawning over the man himself.  Hey, if you love the guy and can't get enough of him, buy it; but don't expect to learn much from it.",1160524800,13,740,4.111111111111111
8041443,5,B0006G1RJ6,"What makes this video so special to me is the overall attitude of Tony, and his performances of the included songs. He gives a nice smile while delivering advanced technical information. Tony explains all about his picking technique and equipment, throwing in some special riffs that are also included on paper. If you owned the VHS version of this, you will love being able to hop through the index and repeat sections. This is the only way to catch all of the intricate picking Tony does. By themselves, Tony's sweet performances make this DVD worth owning.",1137456000,13,559,4.833333333333333
