8398374,1,B003JOOTVU,"More like a fistful of horse pucky.  If I could give it zero stars, I would.  Terence Hill is not in any of these, nor are these ""Trinity"" films.  Tried to watch 2 of them...couldn't get past the first 12 minutes.  Checked the other two...Bud Spencer headlines, with no Terence Hill.  Decided those two were probably as horrible as the first two, so I didn't even watch them.",1295308800,10,375,4.455882352941177
8398375,4,B003JOOTVU,"A fistful of Trinity are four movies with Bud Spencer and Terence Hill. None of the movies has anything to do with the Trinity westerns. It`s just a way to sell films with the Bud Spencer, Terence Hill label. Anyway for the price I paid for these four movies I was greatly satisfied. ""Watch Out We`re  Mad"" was your typical Spencer and Hill movie with Bud at his best trying t sing in a chorus. "" The Two Missionaries was ok but kind of repettitious of there other films. Seeing Bud Spencer in ""Soldier of Fortune"" was a little different time period for Bud playing a Don Quixote character and upholding Italian pride but none the less humorous.  Last but not least, was ""Aladdin""i enjoyed the film but I thought it could of been a lot better..it was really chidish. I am no Roger Ebert but for the price and quality of these films and your a Bud Spencer, Terence Hill fan you should purchase it...Ricko Allen",1293580800,31,909,4.437125748502994
