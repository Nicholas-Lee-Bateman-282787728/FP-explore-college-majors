7988389,5,B00008YLT6,"From the back:  Mary Wanless's unique method of helping riders at all different levels of experience.  Her approach to riding and teaching has been influenced by psychology, biofeedback, Neuro-Linguistic Programming, the Alexander and Feldenfrais systems of body work, Tai-Chi, massage, dance, anatomy, sports psychology, and Educational Kinesiology.  She has evolved an understanding of the physical and psychological relationships between the horse and rider that has led to an extraordinarily effective method of teaching and learning.  Unlike traditional equestrian training, Wanless' method encourages riders to shut out the critical voice of the left brain and to develop an intuitive ""feel"" through imitation and experiment.  With an eye toward undoing bad habits that so easily become engrained, Wanless provides simple but effective exercises and innovative imaging techniques that lead to better concentration, relaxation, and body awareness.  Wanless' teaching shows it is possible to unite mind and body in harmony that transcends all the ""shoulds"" and ""oughts"" and to become a truly natural rider.  Mary demonstrates with real riders, on real horses, with real problems, how to gain the equilibrium and proper body alignment necessary to establish correct riding skills.

Highly recommended.  Very helpful.",1197158400,2,1319,5.863874345549738
7988390,4,B00008YLT6,"Mary Wanless' Ride with your Mind #1 is a good working video - that's to say an advanced novice rider will find themselves going back to it several times to review and sort our common situations. The beginning rider is likely to have a more difficult time with this one, even though they will gain some good information. The video includes several different horse/rider combinations in order to illustrate several key concepts and that's very good but obviously has the ""trade-off"" of being able to devote less time and detail (and reinforcement) to each concept. I would expect many people above the ""beginner"" stage to learn something from and appreciate this video. Mary W. can also be a bit of a character and that adds some amusing charm to the show.",1114992000,3,755,4.770992366412214
