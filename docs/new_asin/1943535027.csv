7802203,2,1943535027,"Disappointed with the set-up of the new version of this sermon.  The original Youtube videos with the funny videos prior to the sermon was better than this commercial CD with the wife.  He also did the first sermons on this subject alot better on his first presentation than on this set.  I go to prison ministry and the women really enjoyed him on Youtube, but our group did not have the same reaction with this DVD set.  They should have left it as it the same instead of the new set-up with the wife.",1504569600,,503,4.319148936170213

7802205,5,1943535027,"Fantastic videos to go along with the Comparison Trap book. However, for those with an Apple TV -- let me save you some money. Go download the Comparison Trap app in the iTunes App store. All four videos are available for free. Then just use your ""air play"" feature on your Apple TV to play the video from your phone to your TV to show it to your bible study or small group. Either way, a great study and well worth doing.",1480636800,3,422,4.158536585365853

7802207,5,1943535027,"My wife and I live well outside of the Metro Atlanta area yet we've been watching North Point Community Church online each Sunday morning the past 2-3 years. While we both grew up in church and then spent 10 years co-leading a large middle school group after we got married we've since found ourselves, despite the disdain of our parents and some friends, among the unchurched. Yet, it's here that our eyes have been opened to so many things that bog down many church goers - our image and what other at church thought of us, church politics, putting money in the plate thinking that is all that God really requires of us, and the belief that church happens within the 4 walls. Outside of church we've discovered the reality that we are the church, wherever we go and wherever we find ourselves. And that we need to be in community with others, not just with those of like faith. My wife now leads and attends several small group gatherings in homes or coffeehouses and we're finding ways where we can invest into the lives of others in life-changing ways however we feel led. And she's currently going through this book with her ladies group and not surprisingly it's such a relevant and personal topic to the women as it's speaking right to one of the most challenging aspects of living in this modern world of ours. Highly recommend!",1463356800,3,1336,4.594142259414226
