8425970,5,B004DTS14Q,"I love that my children can have access to the wonderful world of Mr. Rogers.  I'm so glad Amazon has made these ""weekly episodes"" available.  I'd rather have our TV time be restful and relaxing, instead of over-stimulated and fast-paced (which is what the majority of toddler programming seems to be.)

These specific episodes are great at stimulating imaginative play, and encouraging kids to use things in their everyday world to be creative.",1361836800,3,445,5.068493150684931
