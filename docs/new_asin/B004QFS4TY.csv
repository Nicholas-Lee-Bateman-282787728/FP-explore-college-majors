8438100,2,B004QFS4TY,"he film has several talented names dominating the cast, but the show belongs to the kids actually. Especially Siddhartha Sanghani, who displays great confidence while enacting his character. Rajvi Suchak has the purity that this role demands. Zakir Hussain and Rupali Ganguli, as Pappu's parents, are adequate. Kay Kay Menon gets limited scope. Liliput has no role whatsoever. Rajpal Yadav is wasted. Sanjay Mishra deserved a better deal. As for Jackie Shroff, what is he doing in this film? The remaining kids are alright.

On the whole, SATRANGEE PARACHUTE is a OK show all the way.",1300665600,,584,5.083333333333333
