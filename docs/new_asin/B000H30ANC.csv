8136141,4,B000H30ANC,"My kids are in kindergarten and 2nd grade -- they both really like this DVD.  The kids in the stories - 3 boys and 3 girls (who are the great granddaughters of the boys) - travel through time and meet a lot of interesting historical characters. Of course, they always have a hard time getting back to their own time. The DVD includes the following stories:
2015
You Can't But Ghengis Khan
Able Was I Ere I Saw Elba
The Good, the Bad, and the Goofy
Lewis and Clark...and Jodie, Freddi and Samantha
Hey Kid, Want to Buy a Bridge?
Breaking the Codex",1183593600,11,546,4.300970873786408
