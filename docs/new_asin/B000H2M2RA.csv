2625776,1,B000H2M2RA,"Ever lite a wick on a firecracker and it doesnt go off? How disappointing right? Well the filmmakers here lite the wick but, their film doesn't take off ..sadly! ""Rest Stop"" is a bummer from the beginning.. the direction is flat, acting is mediocre at best, the writing is weak ..with an overemphasis on blood and gore that is there to try and cover up just how weak it is. I am a fan of horror movies and I like good gory effects but, a film has to have more to offer as well. I know that in a horrific situation one might not think straight.. but, our main girl had plenty of opportunities to either start walking or, shoot the psycho with the injured cops gun. There was a part when the girl suggested that she and another girl that was trapped in a utility closet escape together but, she never thought to do that on her own after she realized the trapped girl was either a ghost or only inside her head. Its not fully explained if the trapped girl was a past victim or what. Whenever the main girl decides to use the gun on the madman.. she of course wastes the bullets on the injured cop that ended up not really being there like the trapped girl.. so I don't even know if there was a gun or not because if the cop was part of the main girls imagination or a ghost (again it's not fully explained) ..then the gun was part of her imagination as well.. so I am not sure how the bullet holes got in the bathroom door. Also I don't understand why the cop didn't believe her at first.. he must have been a part of her imagination and not a past victim come back from the dead to help her because, if he was a past victim he would have already known that the crazed man was after her. I hate deep plot holes! The biggest misunderstanding I have is why the trapped girl and police man both vanish as if they weren't ever there, along with the blood that vanishes, the gun, the bullet holes?? I hope I am getting my point across regarding this films many flaws because, the whole film is over all one big flaw and with the 5 or more alternate endings its no wonder the filmmakers had trouble tying up the knots in the script.. they actually never do believably. Its ashamed that this wasn't even decent. The ingredients were there, they just weren't mixed or prepared properly.",1161043200,4,2275,4.244239631336406
2625777,3,B000H2M2RA,"I started watching this movie 3 or 4 times before I finally just decided to put all distractions aside and really pay attention.  I thought this would be some mild diversion, but it was actually pretty good.  Jaimie Alexander was on screen for most of the movie and she did a decent job.  She went through a lot, survived a lot, overcame a lot then....well, the ending was definately a downer.  Done on a low budget but effective in its own way, Rest Stop is not a bad way to indulge yourself for a couple hours.",1161043200,,512,4.302083333333333
2625778,3,B000H2M2RA,"""Rest Stop"" is not a bad movie, it's just a lazy movie and borrows ideas from much better horror movies.  The torture and mutilation scene is out of ""Hostel""  the mutant is from ""The Hills Have Eyes"", the relentless crazed truck driver takes a detour from ""Joy Ride"" and many more.

The boyfriend of a young girl disappears while she goes to take care of business in the most disgusting toilet at a abandoned rest stop. She actually uses it which defies credulity, she would have been better off going in the bushes.

She spends the rest of the movie being terrorized by a maniac in a yellow truck and takes refuge about a dozen more times in the toilet of horror.

She thinks she finds refuge with folks in a camper but they turn out to be the long lost cousins of the loons from ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and they even have a mutant child in the back who takes polaroid pictures of himself.

She escapes but just when you think how much crazier this movie can get she meets up with a park ranger played by Joey Lawrence who acts like he was still on the tv show ""Blossom"". For his efforts he gets run over a couple of times by the maniac in the yellow truck so our heroine drags him into the toilet-by this time she has spent so much time there she may as well start renting.  So Joey the ranger tells her to take his gun and blow his brains out-she takes the gun and sticks it in his mouth and fires and with half his skull skittering across the floor Joey tells her she didn't do a good enough job and to try again. She does and at least one bad acting performance has ended mercifully.

The movie does not end happily but it does have some tense moments a lot of gore and is worth a rental but don't expect anything new or original.",1161043200,19,1741,4.207207207207207
2625779,4,B000H2M2RA,I saw this movie at the Fangoria horror convention in NYC & I thought it was pretty entertaining. The unedited version adds a good helping of extra gore. Overall the atmosphere felt very genuine and there were alot of jump out of your seat suspense moments that usually don't have much of an impact on me but they did it very well in this movie.,1160870400,2,345,4.323076923076923
2625780,2,B000H2M2RA,"Talk about lost opportunities! While it has a couple of good bloody scenes,some good ideas aswell as 1 or 2 pretty damn creepy moments ""Rest Stop"" is one of the most bogus attempts at a backwoods road movie that this horror fan has ever stumbled into. Lucky for me I got to watch it for free on the SCI-FI channel this past weekend so I definitely won't make the mistake of buying it. Words that come to mind not only after watching the movie but 5 minutes into it are(unoriginal,cliche,aweful,ridiculous,mindless,directionless,amateur)

2625781,2,B000H2M2RA,"I recently attended a horror movie conference where Shiban was kind enough to pre-screen the unrated version of this film for the attendees who wanted to view it.  He explained that this movie was going to be shown on Sci-Fi channel and then be followed with a DVD release in both Unrated and Rated versions.

This movie looks pretty polished for a low budget film.  There are some areas where the camera shakes quite a bit, I suppose that's intended to induce suspense, however, in my case it only induced nausea, and the actors, while they don't overact, they are not believable as their characters.  Joseph Lawrence, who played the incredibly young sheriff, was not convincing even in the least.  Law men, especially sheriff's, know how to draw their guns and bring more than six bullets with them when they leave the office.  The interaction between Lawrence and Alexander borders on the ridiculous that culminates in a bizarre sequence where Lawrence requests Alexander to do something, she does it, she messes up, he scolds her, and she does it right.  The sequence was completely baffling and completely ruins any mood that was developed at that point.  I turned to my wife and we both said that same thing, wow was that dumb.

I respect what Shiban is trying to do here.  He's trying to create a new unstoppable killing machine in the same vein as Freddy, Jason, Michael Myers, and so on.  But, let's be honest, how many more do we really need.",1159747200,12,1452,4.699604743083004

2625785,3,B000H2M2RA,"I like to travel by car and in the last six decades I've traveled practically every major highway from the Pacific Coast to the Great Plains and from the Mexican to the Canadian border. In addition, I've been on a lot of minor roadways and my preferred sleeping arrangement has been camping. All has gone well, and I've had no problems. However, a small percentage of stopping places can be creepy and populated by creepy people. I've had any number of rest stops where I've felt high anxiety and could hardly wait to get away. I suppose this is a common feeling with many auto travelers and is not limited to rest stops but might also include motels and eating places.

My late night bargain-rack movie for last night was ""Rest Stop,"" a movie which built upon this common traveling anxiety and magnified it to really extreme proportions. Most people didn't like the movie, as evidenced by the Amazon rankings, and I can clearly understand why. I'd say the movie is badly flawed in the latter third but is actually a rather good movie, if you can stand to watch it. ""Rest Stop"" is centered about a young couple who stopped at a roadside rest stop on an obscure California highway only to have their traveling turned into the worst nightmare ever imagined, The rest stop is unattended, the only people there are a really, really creepy family in a motor home, and the couple is harassed and stalked by a madman in an aging pickup truck. Ultimately, the stalker managed to separate the couple. He tortured and ultimately killed the man. He then turned his attention to the woman. What followed is the worst type of terror and torture you might imagine, including the death of a policeman who inadvertently stopped and became prey to the same mad stalker. Be ready for a bloody, gory and gut-wrenching experience dragged out through the last third of the movie. In fact, the violence and horror escalated until I wondered how the movie producers could ever de-escalate it to provide a suitable ending. Well, evidently, this was a problem. The ending was very poorly done and the entire last third of the movie could use extensive re-writing.  The extra features on the DVD offers three other possible endings, none of which seem satisfactory to me.

The movie was actually rather well done. The acting was excellent. You really felt the horror of the situation as it unfolded. I think the movie was overdone in that the violence became simply overwhelming and difficult to watch. All right, it's just acting and just a movie, but you might stop and think a while when you go go into your next roadside rest stop for a break.

2625787,1,B000H2M2RA,"I certainly wasn't expecting a masterpiece when I sat down to watch this horror film, but I was often confused and found this to be really worthless on any level. Besides being extremely predictable, it also contains many unexplained things - one being a former victim of the killer suddenly disappears, which could be explained as a ghost, but when a cop disappears after being killed, it just makes NO sense at all. This is only part of the problem with this mess of a movie. The actors are unconvincing and they do unnatural things in the situations they're in. The film is very unoriginal and we've seen it all before done so much better, even in bad horror films.",1325203200,2,668,4.575
2625788,3,B000H2M2RA,"Alright not the greatest flick however, after reading so many horrible reviews I felt the need to comment.  Why on earth would so many of you look for a ""reality concept"" here?..It's a horror movie!  The lead character was not an idiot , she was trapped in time...she did not have the luxury of using her brain here. It's about people caught up in a nightmare they can't escape, plain & simple. I'm sure any fan of the genre would agree these types of movies are made to just put a little fear in you & make you think about choices we all make in our lives. Not to mention the consequences we pay for our choices.  While I must restate that I never thought in a million years I would ever defend this movie, but honestly it was not as bad as most would lead you to believe. I have watched so much trash in my lifetime atleast this flick was filmed well and had good sound quality, which is severely lacking in so many of the films put out theses days.

I am going to my local video store, Buying every copy and destroying them, the director needs to either quit, or get a job, maybe working at a rest stop. He should be tied to a chair and forced to watch this movie till he dies of old age. Most boring, dumb movie ever. Even worse then ""Feeling Minnesota"" and that movie sucked, but at least had a plot.",1321142400,,477,4.031578947368421
2625790,4,B000H2M2RA,"Rest Stop is a pretty good horror movie.  Honestly, it was a LOT better than the negative reviews here on amazon led me to believe.  I was expecting a total disappointment but got a pretty decent horror film instead.

It's about... well, let me explain what happens in the beginning first.  We find out that a young mans brother is missing (along with his brunette girlfriend) somewhere in a small town in the middle of nowhere, so the young man -and his extremely hot blonde-haired girlfriend- go on a search to find out where he might have gone.

Tagging along is an annoying friend that went to high school with the two of them.  He's the typical goofball idiot that lets out an insult whenever he sees fit.  You know, the type of person most of us have dealt with or possibly dealing with now!  Most of us don't like these type of people, haha.

Soon we witness that there's a maniac in a truck that goes around attempting to run over people who he believes are sinners.  This takes us to some fairly interesting segments and furthermore takes up a good portion of the storytelling in the beginning.

Anyway, one aspect that I found really cool about Rest Stop is how it tried to implement two very different styles of horror.  You have the crazy man attacking people type and you have the psychological horror type that makes you think about the paranormal and spiritual side of the spectrum.

To be fair, combining the two styles wasn't exactly a smooth transition.  I mean, the plot is obviously severely flawed and undeveloped, but it's a noble attempt on the movie writers to give us something more than your typical ""maniac slicing up and running over innocent people"" routine that we've seen a thousand times already.

To give one example, the blonde-haired girlfriend walks into a bathroom and sees a woman sitting in the stall and crying, however the woman immediately disappears the moment she kicks the door open, and when the blonde girlfriend comes back to the bathroom later the entire room is completely different, deserted and rundown which is *nothing* she experienced when she first walked in there.  To me, this kind of setting provided a really good atmosphere.

It's soon discovered that the young man, his girlfriend, and the goofy guy are seeing apparitions of the missing brother and his girlfriend.  This inevitably leads to some interesting (and psychologically terrifying and nightmare-like) segments involving the two missing people actually returning under mysterious conditions and making those searching for them believe that they actually found the missing couple, when in fact that's not what's happening at all.

There's a crucial aspect to the storyline involving having peoples eyeballs ripped out of their heads and the reason behind it, but I can't reveal the reason without spoiling the movie.  It's a semi-interesting aspect of the storyline, however.

Oh and the ending?  It's fantastic.  It's a nice twist.  Nothing extraordinary or revolutionary or anything like that- just an unexpected turn of events.

Overall, the acting is pretty good, the storyline is fairly elaborate (of course it's nothing that Silent Hill for example hasn't done much better) and the fear and gross factor is pretty high.  I recommend it.",1318118400,,3262,4.917733089579524
2625791,5,B000H2M2RA,"I had never seen these 2 movies before. There are some parts that are a little out there. These two movies are good thrillers. It leaves the watcher wondering if the characters are really seeing things or if they are a figment of their imagination.

2625792,2,B000H2M2RA,"The movie started off good, but then it went downhill real fast.  There were stuff that didn't make any sense at all.  People ""disappear""...not the abduction type of disappearing, but literally, disappearing.  Then there were her actions that didn't make sense.  During the movie, I kept asking, ""Why would she do that at that time???"" and ""Why isn't she doing that?!""

2625793,3,B000H2M2RA,"The most horrifying part of this movie is when the girl is trapped in a rest stop bathroom with another guy and neither one of them can act.

Boyfriend goes missing. Girl goes nuts looking for him and trying to figure out what's going on while trying to defender herself from a crazy man. Blood, fire, gunshots, car crashes, irony and a nasty bathroom.

2625794,4,B000H2M2RA,"For this horror fan's money, Rest Stop is a gritty, gory thrill ride well worth watching.  Yes, the story has some problems, but I really don't understand all the vitriol directed toward this juicy little film.  You have to respect a killer who has honed his craft to such an exquisite degree as the Rest Stop killer; this guy has psychological and physical torture down to a freaking science, savoring every minute of the heroine's extended ordeal.  He repeatedly leaves the scene entirely, confident that his prey remains under his complete control in each of his absences.  Admittedly, the fact that our poor dumb heroine isn't exactly the sharpest knife in the drawer helps, but I still have to give major kudos to our bad guy.  I don't think I've ever characterized a killer as having panache, but this guy has it in spades.  I don't care how unoriginal and sometimes clichd the movie was, I quite enjoyed it.  Still, the critics have some valid points.  The addition of a certain family into the story was an embarrassingly bad decision that comes across as shameless pandering, while certain potentially confusing elements in the plot will be decried as serious plot holes by some - although I think their inclusion and lack of a definitive explanation actually add an effective depth to the story.  Those who expect their horror movies to wrap everything up with a Scooby Doo ending won't like it, but I see no reason why a horror film can't leave you pondering over a few unanswered questions.

The basic storyline is pretty simple.  Young Nicole Carrow (Jaimie Alexander) runs off to California with her boyfriend Jess (Joey Mendicino) - but they never make it.  At some point along the way, Nicole's need to relieve herself lands them both at the world's nastiest and most remote rest stop.  Showing great fortitude, Nicole actually manages to do her business inside, but there is no Jess and no car waiting for her when she comes back out.  As the hours and minutes pass, her wonder and bafflement at Jess turn into deep concern, and then her worst fears seem to be confirmed by the menacing presence of a mysterious man in an old yellow truck - the same man and truck referenced on a number of ominous graffiti posts (going back a number of years) on the bathroom stalls.  Nicole's night takes on a number of macabre, borderline insane twists and turns, but the one overwhelming constant is the killer's murderously calculated intent to torment this poor girl.

At one point, Nicole does interact with the world's weirdest family inside an RV, and the movie suffers greatly for the inclusion of this scene.  It's patently ridiculous and really disrupts the tension and suspense the movie has the built up until that point.  It's most unfortunate because Nicole's interaction with a couple of other characters during her ordeal plays so well.  I have to take a moment here and praise Joey Lawrence for his performance; I never knew he could act, but I thought he was great in this movie.  It also behooves me to say a few words about the DVD extras.  In general, it is never a good thing for a movie to come with alternate endings, let alone three of them, because their presence on the DVD necessarily conveys the impression that the director was never quite sure how to end the movie.  We can at least take comfort in the fact that he chose the best of the available endings for the film itself, as none of the three alternate endings works well at all, in my opinion.  Personally, I would not have included them on the DVD.  Other extras include a slideshow of ""crime scene"" shots as well as a home movie made by a member of the RV family.  Apparently, this little film may have a bearing on some of the film's open questions, but it's really more stupid than anything else.

In the end, we do have a flawed, unoriginal, clichd movie - yet I think it works surprisingly well despite these handicaps.  Obviously, a significant number of viewers disagree with me on this.  I would just ask you not to dismiss this film out of hand because of all the negative reviews.  While you've no doubt seen this type of storyline play out before in other horror movies, Rest Stop does succeed in invoking an atmosphere all its own.  It's not scary, but I certainly had a good time watching it.",1269216000,2,4295,4.635402906208719
2625795,2,B000H2M2RA,"Rest Stop: 4 out of 10: Tedium is not a pleasant experience. Rest Stop has plenty of tedium. To paraphrase Ed Harris in Glengarry Glen Ross ""Hey lets take all the latest overexposed trends in horror movies and put them in one film. Yeah no one has thought of that before"" The film starts with the couple that is hard to root for. He (Joey Medincio) is a jerk; she (Jaimie Alexander) is a spoiled daddy's girl. They drive from Texas to California and get lost. (It is one road called I-10, numbskulls) They stop to make love and I was having seventies horror film flashback as horrid soft-folk rock was playing in the background and soft filtered sunlight danced on their naked bodies.

They eventually stop at a backwoods rest stop and the movie moves distinctly into science fiction territory. Ever since Seven, and more recently Saw, moviemakers have been trying to one up each other in creating the most disgusting room imaginable. The ladies restroom is one of those over the top places. The only thing missing is George Michael with his pants around his ankles. My lady friend watching the film with me expressed amazement that any woman would enter such a room let alone use the facilities. I am a guy and I wouldn't use them. A meth-addicted hooker would think twice about using the facilities. Needless to say, Jaimie Alexander's character loses all credibility when she plops herself down.

Actually, Alexander's character loses credibility repeatedly in the film. As written she is one of the dumbest heroines ever seen in a movie. (My personal favorite sticking her fingers through the door at the killer, which he naturally bites off.) The rest of the film reads like a modern horror clich checklist, redneck serial killer in Duel style truck (check); Crazy religious family with demented dwarf child (check); poorly lit torture room with stupid zooming camera effects (check); the killer tricks the heroine into killing an innocent (check); supernatural apparitions (um check); Joey Lawrence (uh yeah actually); endless conversations that slow movie to a crawl (check); and my personal favorite... ending that disregards everything that came before it in search of so called twist (bingo).

I had high hopes for this film going into it when I first watched it, it was being compared to ""WOLF CREEK"" [a film I liked]  so I thought that this would be just as good if not better.  Unfortunately this film did not live up to that expectation, maybe it is my fault for believing the hype. This film turned out to be just ok which is a disappointment, but it does still have some good qualities about it. I think if I would have gone into this with out expectations it might have been a little better, who am I kidding it would have been the same. Reason being is that with or with out the expectations the lead actress would still have annoyed me, so maybe I would have felt the same way.

The story is all about a young couple just getting away from every thing in life and trying start a new one, guess they get more then they wanted.  The film picks up nicely once they get to the [you guessed it] rest stop and one of them goes missing, the girlfriend is left to fend for her self as a killer plays with her the whole night. The film at this point goes from a serial killer flick into a ghost film into a torture film and back again, it makes more sense [maybe not] when you watch it. That is basically the story, how long can she take being played by this guy out to kill her like he did her man.

Jaimie Alexander stars in this film and man I wish she did not, her performance is absolutely annoying, at least to me. The thing that annoys me the most is that I know she can do much better and you can tell while watching this that the potential was there. She ends up failing in this film though with a very shaky and down right annoying performance, I just don't believe her in this role. She is absolutely out shined by every other person on this flick. Deanna Russo plays her part masterfully and really should have been the lead in this film, her performance is hauntingly good and very creepy. Joey Mendicino as Jaimie's boyfriend does a good job for the time that he is on screen, and all the actors that played the creepy RV family are brilliant. Another great and very believable performance comes from Joseph Lawrence as the police officer who gets trapped with Jaimie's character. If it were not for those individuals this film would have been really hurt by the lead actress.

Writer/Director John Shiban obviously was trying to make a good movie and you can tell he really put is all into this, every thing is fine on his end. The writing for this film was good especially for this type of film and the direction and pacing was good as well, I think that the creepiness of the bathroom scenes though is what makes this film stand out above a bad lead. There are some good gory scenes as well and the RV family provides one of the best parts of the film. There are some things that don't make any sense but you can check that out for your self.

It is up to you to judge this film how you see fit but personally I say that the lead actress almost ruins the entire movie. I would say that this is a rental and then see how you feel from there, I think for the most part it is good.",1225238400,,3112,4.157807308970099

I've been wanting to see Rest Stop for awhile and was a little excited to finally sit down and watch it. When it was over, I was more relieved than anything else. This movie wants to be in your face and shocking so bad that it's almost laughable. Yes, there are some rather good gore scenes but all of that is completely overshadowed by the fact that the story is it's biggest flaw. There's dates on the bathroom stall from the 70's and if this movie takes place in the present then the Killer would have to be at least sixty. The family in the RV had potential but with what screen time they're given it just leads to the viewer to wonder, what in gods name was thep point of all that? The main bad guy is a dime-store villain ""dirty-red-neck trucker,"" great there's something new. And lets not forget our moronic heroine who seemed to do nothing but make things worse for herself. I'm sorry, say that's how her character would act all you want but I refuse to believe people are this stupid. Last but not least, the ghost factor: cool concept, but executed so poorly i'd rather watch Ghost Dad. And don't look for anything helpful in terms of an explanation with the alternate endings, they'll only further induce cranium aches.",1224547200,,1330,4.477366255144033

I pretty much knew what to expect from the film within the first five minutes when we saw our heroine run away from home, take a drag from a marijuana cigarette and indulge her self with some good old fashioned fornication.

The movie is extremely predictable, even to the point where when my girlfriend and I were watching it, we would say what we thought was going to happen next...and it did.  Maybe I've just seen too many of these movies or there just isn't any creativity to this film.  Probably a combination of both.

If the predictability wasn't enough to ruin the movie, the acting undeniably did the job.  Our leading lady, if you will, doesn't sell the movie at all and let's face it, Joey Lawrence has never been known for his acting skills.  Not to mention, you know you're pretty much as good as dead when they send in Mr. ""Whoa!"" to save your life.  You're better off fending the crazed redneck by yourself.

2625807,1,B000H2M2RA,"Just gonna point out flaws, this doesn't even deserve a traditional review:

--The main character, was she not one of the most annoying characters ever? What a whining, complaining, unlikeable person. How many times did she swear in the movie? Notice how from the very beginning of the movie she would have these mini temper tantrums of varying degrees, which would continue to the very end of this terrible film.

--There was a point in the movie where I stopped giving my full, undivided attention, so maybe I might've missed something, but when the Phil Lamarr from Mad TV lookalike cop came into the picture, why weren't one or both of these items brought immediately into play: 1) his gun (before gasoline was an issue), 2) his walkie-talkie. Was there a reason why after he was injured, and they were both in the bathroom, that they didn't try to call for backup?

--What bad acting from the Phil Lamarr lookalike cop. Tons of examples, but when they were in the bathroom, he said, ""don't let him trap you Nicole."" What is he, her COACH for some athletic sporting event? I guess it's the inclusion of her first name, but that, combined with his tone was just wrong for this situation, it makes him sound like some motivational speaker, or a corner-man giving advice to a boxer: ""watch for his jab, Nicole.""

--What exactly was the killer waiting for? Why did he keep leaving her there and driving off? He could've got her anytime he wanted.

--That random girl at the end they showed walking towards the bathroom must've been someone they picked up off the street. She had exactly 0% acting skills. The worst acting I've seen has been a tie between the cop from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cube/dp/6305238065/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cube</a>, and that little child girl from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ghost-Dog-The-Way-of-the-Samurai/dp/B00005QCVX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ghost Dog - The Way of the Samurai</a>. I might have to change this list. Just listen to her explain to the cop about what she heard behind the door. When someone says ""what?"" in disbelief of what they're hearing from you, your first instinct isn't to tell the GENDER of the person (she said ""It was a girl!""), you usually will reiterate the seriousness of the situation by saying, "" I said, I heard a voice trapped behind the door, there's SOMEONE back there! I heard a VOICE!"" Not, ""it was a girl."" Because then the reaction could be, ""WTF are you talking about,*WHAT* was a girl?"" Then look at her reaction after the cop checks behind the door and concludes it was a joke, she says, ""but I heard it!"" Yeah, they need to go ahead and just send her back to the streets.

2625809,3,B000H2M2RA,"After seeing two really god awful movies I rented tonight, this one was either a decent film, or just seemed good compared to the other two.

A young couple are on there way from Dallas to California to start there life. On the way, they need to pull over, cause when ya gotta go, ya gotta go. When Nicole comes out of the can, her boyfriend is gone, there is no one around but an RV that appears to have no one in it.

When Nicole decides to walk down the road for help, a yellow pick up truck that almost ran them off the road in a previous scene tries to run her down and she realizes her boyfriend is not just missing.

She then becomes stalked by the guy in the pick up, and meets a few weirdos and spooks along the way, just trying to stay alive as she is preyed upon by a maniac.

:::::

I kind of enjoyed this one. It was not so scary, but i liked it cause it seemed like a fresh idea. Although some of the things you discover is happening along the way are kind of weird and hard to swallow, it's still interesting and I can't say I have seen it done like this before.

The whole thing is pretty much shot around a rest stops toilet block for the whole movie, so you have to give them credit for being able to complete a movie that goes no where location-wise, but does go plenty of places plot-wise.

::::
Warning: ---SPOILERS-- if you don't want to read spoilers, don't read from here on.
:::::

Some things to this movie just don't make sense to me, so I can't give it more then 3 stars. Although it seemed fresh and interesting, it still leaves me wondering what the heck the r.v scene was for. So there religious nutballs, and probably have something to do with the killer in the truck, but they just did not seem to tie into the movie too good. I dunno, to me, it felt like they where there just to give the movie a scene that was not in the toilet block. But did not really belong in the movie, if I was the editor, I'd have cut that scene out.

And the character of Nicole seeing ghosts of past victim's was an interesting thing to watch, but, why develop the cop Bruce Willis wanna-be so much, with him telling her to take his badge to his wife, and say goodbye to his daughter etc... it just did not feel right because he is telling her to kill him with the gun to end his suffering, yet it's really because he is a ghost and she can not kill the killer with a ghost gun... although, the end kind of made you realise the killer is a ghost anyway, so ...ehhh, is it really worth trying to make sense of this?

The movies done, it is what it is.

::: bonus features ::::

- about 6 alternate endings. Some interesting, some your glad they did not use, and I think everyone could have come up with better endings then these.

- the whacko family home cam, kind of funny.
- on the bus - zzzzzzz
- trailers, and behind the scenes of some things

Overall, if you liked a movie called ""Monster Man"" then this movie should appeal to you. It's about the only thing I can sort of compare this one to. Maybe if you saw Roadkill/Joyride then this a movie you might like.

quite frankly, I am eagerly awaiting the up-coming sequel to this film said to be released in October 2008.",1210896000,,3186,4.124394184168013
2625810,1,B000H2M2RA,"You know those great horror/thrillers, where the lone hero/heroine has to match wits against a sadistic madman? Movies like ""Breakdown"", ""The Vanishing"", ""The Hitcher"" or ""Joy Ride""? ""Rest Stop"" tries to reach that level of suspense, but fails on every level.
You will be AMAZED at the stupidity as it unfolds onscreen. Dumb girl runs away with Dumber boyfriend to California. Along the way this annoying couple stops to have sex, argue, and take a ""short cut"". While on this ""short cut"" the girl has to use the restroom and refuses to cop-a-squat in the grass for fear of snakes. (Keep in mind that this same girl didn't mind rolling around in the snake-country tall grass and woods just 3 minutes earlier bumpin' nasties in an earlier drawn out scene) So dumb boyfriend pulls over at the next ""REST STOP"" oooohhhh!
I'm not into spoilers so I won't elaborate beyond that. The heroine has the IQ of a scrambled egg, and continually makes astoundingly stupid decisions. At one point some mutant hillbillies are thrown in..and why not, if your going to rip off ""Hostel"", might as well throw in a little ""Hills Have Eyes"" too. Somewhere along the line a supernatural element gets thrown in as well...it doesn't add to the movie, but becomes more of a distraction. I kept wondering what is the purpose, are these ghosts, is the girl insane? You will never know the answer, so don't bother. It's just another element added by a writer/director who is just throwing all kinds of ideas into his film to see what sticks...most of which doesn't.
All of this would be fine if we have a great sadistic anti-hero to root for, like Freddy or Jason. You don't even get that. Some finger-sucking guy drives around a canary yellow Ford F150 looking like a deranged stock room guy from Home Depot who got lost. I guess by keeping him hidden it's suposed to build suspense? It doesn't, and we are left without anyone to care or root for.

2625818,3,B000H2M2RA,"First i'll start by pointing out what many other reviewers have, and thats that this is a low budget movie. Nicole and her boyfriend run away from home and end up in a suposedly abaondoned rest stop in CA. From then on her boyfriend vanishes and from there on is when the story stops makeing sense.

1. The girl in the janitor's closet. Her name is Tracey Kress and she is seen in the begining of the movie(around the 70s) and is killed by the hillbilly driver. After some frantic scenes She disappears. Is that bathroom supposed to be haunted by the ghosts of people he killed?

2. The religous freaks. In the special features it shows Scotty(the deformed little person) takeing photos of his family. In  the first shot it shows his father burying the body of what looks like to be the killer. In the last shot it shows the killer murdering the family. So once again how in the hell was Nicole able to ride in the camper with them if they're dead? Another funny thing i noticed was when she got off they were right back at the rest stop. So i guess even though the father was driving and never turned the vehicle around. I guess they never went anywhere and the SUV just disappeared into thin air.

3. The Killer. Just some old hillbilly who could have been easily killed by a bullet.. but noooo. After he ran over the cop Nicole just watches in horror like a jackass while he steals the cop's motorcycle. Then in the bathroom she has another opportunity to shoot him. But instead she wastes all the bullits on the door(and two on the dying cop)

4. The Ending. Made no sense whatsoever. She blows up the killer's truck while he's in it, and then just like that he's standing behind her. The final scene shows her in the bathroom talking to a new girl stopping in to take a piss. When she sees Nicole she runs out and gets the ranger. Who when opens the door sees nothing. After he leaves it shows her behind some equipment saying ""Help Me"" Hmm, Ok. Sooo what did the killer do to her exactly?! turn her into a spirit? Banish her to sit in the bathroom closet for all eternity? The script was very poorly written, and as another reviewer stated. ""There are so many things that happen and give no explanation as to why. There is a sequal to this movie coming out later this year. Hopefully it will answer all the questions left hanging from this movie.",1186185600,,2352,4.360730593607306
2625819,1,B000H2M2RA,"To put it very, very simply: this is a rip-off of many superior movies. Except there isn't a single person in this film to care about. Everyone is irritating beyond belief. Everyone and everything is a cliche: you've got the bickering young couple, you've got the family of wackadoodles, you've got the crazy hillbilly in a truck.

It just felt too much like we were supposed to find it all super edgy and/or subversive, but it just fell flat. The ""crazy"" family in the van just made me LAUGH. The killer's ""torture chamber"" made me laugh. There are three alternate endings that are really terrible, with I think it was the very last one being SO unbelievably horribly shot, it'll cause you to go into shock.

And of course my biggest beef is the fact that people in horror movies are just so, so stupid. Especially people on road trips. I can't tell you how many times I've peed into an empty McDonald's cup because we couldn't - or wouldn't - stop. Hell, they couldn't have just pulled over by the side of the road so she could shut her trap for one freakin' minute and pee?

Drive to Hollywood and seek gainful employment as Famous Movie Stars.  This one fact explains much that is wrong about the film.  Not only does it immediately make the characters hard to care about, but it also foreshadows one of their biggest and most boring flaws: mind-blowing stupidity.

Nicole, at one point, hears the call of nature, and the two ill-fated young lovers stop at (dum da dum!) the Rest Stop.  After Nicole uses perhaps the most nauseating toilet in southwest America, she comes outside to find that her boyfriend and his car have disappeared.  Before long, she is tormented by a sadistic man in a yellow truck, an odd-ball family of fundamentalist God-thumpers, and her own crippling idiocy.

2625826,2,B000H2M2RA,"Rest Stop (John Shiban, 2006)

Writer/producer John Shiban makes his feature-film directorial debut with Rest Stop, a slick little thriller that wants to be far more than it actually is. While this is an admirable goal, it's never possible to fully forget that the movie's trying a bit too hard. Still, it's a vast improvement over a lot of recent damsel-in-distress flicks.

Nicole (Watch Over Me's Jaimie Alexander) and Jessie (Joey Mendicino in his big-screen debut) have run away from their small-town Texas home and are on their way to Los Angeles when they pull into a rest stop. After the required bathroom break, Nicole comes outside to find Jessie has disappeared. She also discovers the rest stop is the home base for a particularly nasty serial killer who's been picking off young girls there for a very long time. She's forced into a game of cat and mouse with the guy, and finds herself questioning her sanity more and more as the game goes on.

Yes, there are plot holes big enough to drive a yellow pickup truck through. And yes, there are some awe-inspiringly stupid moments (especially the final scene) that make you wonder whether anyone at the production company actually read the entire script before bankrolling this thing (I kept thinking it was the filmed equivalent of a novel published by Xlibris). But Shiban was at least trying, and you have to give him a few brownie points for that. I mean, how seriously can you take a movie that casts Joey Lawrence as a cop? And how seriously are you supposed to take a movie that features the camper family to be found in the middle of this one? It's entirely possible that the most you'll get out of this movie is a few laughs, a few hours of nitpicking with your buddies, and some awesome eye candy in the for of Jaimie Alexander.

2625828,1,B000H2M2RA,"One of the most important elements in a horror film is that the audience has to either, identify or care about the potential victim. In this case, I felt neither.  It's hard to be sympathetic towards people who are genuinely stupid. I'll explain. The girl in this film is being hunted by a deranged killer in a commercial pick-up truck. He steals her boyfriend away to take him to his gruesome and torturous demise. Once she realizes he is missing, she sticks around (all alone) in a deserted rest stop to get drunk on a bottle of whiskey that she discovers in a police officers desk. She calls for help and when a police officer arrives it turns out to be Joey Lawrence! Wough!! The killer runs over Joey and his death scene is acually quite comical. I can only hope the director was playing it for laughs because it is like something out of Monty Python. Joey is laying on a floor and he begs the girl to shoot him in the head to relieve him of his agonizing misery. She reluctantly agrees and sticks the pistol in his wide open flapper. She pulls the trigger and the next shot is Joey Lawrence laying on the ground with half his brains splattered on the floor telling her ""You missed!, do it again"" at that point I was waiting for John Cleese and Eric Idle to walk out and go into ""The Lumberjack Song.""

2625829,4,B000H2M2RA,"If you plan on watching Rest Stop with the intentions of being scared or shocked, save your time.  If, however, you want to make fun of a ridiculous horror movie, continue reading.

Rest Stop starts off with a cheesy montage reminiscent of a 70s movie; there's a senseless killing, a creepy truck, bad home video footage, and an EXTREME NIPPLE CLOSEUP.  After that it gets funnier.

Two kids, who probably have ADHD, or at the very least are a product of inbreeding, runaway from home to become big stars in Hollywood.  Fat chance!  When the boy looks like Damone from ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"", and the girl acts like Leo DiCaprio in ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"" - and she's not supposed to be retarded - then you know they'll just end up as street vendors or fluffers in another kind of movie.  It's better that they meet someone to put them out of their misery.

On their way to California, in the only bit of realism in the entire movie, the girl has to go to the bathroom (#1).  Sure enough, they stop at the rest stop from hell.  Shortly thereafter, she's dropping trou' at the foulest toilet in the history of mankind; the only thing it was missing was a fecal mural.

After conducting business (#1), she leaves the restroom to find her boyfriend missing.  At first I thought it was because he was tired of her horrible acting, and he just decided to go it alone in Hollywood.  I was wrong, and soon the girl starts to get terrorized by a guy who has watched a collection of horror movies prior to visiting the rest stop.  He watched ""Joy Ride"" to learn how to use a CB, ""Hostel"" to learn how to torture, ""Sixth Sense"" to cause the conjuring of ghosts, ""Texas Chainsaw"" to deal with an RV of freaks (although he could have just watched RV with Robin Williams).

The rest of the movie unfolds as anticipated, replete with gimps, freaks, pointless gore, religious nuts, idiotic dialogue, unrealistic amounts of blood, senseless destruction, incoherent crying, and a Joey Lawrence cameo as the most incompetent cop since the father in ""The Hills Have Eyes"".  Thankfully, Joey portrays the black guy in this movie, and he dies quickly and stupidly.

Does the girl get chased?  Yes.

Does the girl fall down?  Oh, you know it!

Is the killer seemingly indestructible?  Of course.

Does the girl make countless wrong decisions, one after another?  Clearly.

It's predictably moronic, and I loved it.  I haven't laughed so hard in a long time.  Score one for the bad guys!",1170979200,6,2478,4.610983981693364
2625830,1,B000H2M2RA,"a horror movie for the brain dead. a ridiculous and stupid screenplay full of holes. if you want to scare the viewers witless, at least you should come up with some smart tricks not just a smaller version of stephen king's semi with a redneck guy driving a beat-up old truck at will to kill people since what? 1957? what? a super nature mystery? so this girl was making love with her boy friend in the wildness, how come a voyeur-like close-up film would have shown up in an old tv? how it was possible? what?! that ranger's station got cable or satellite subscription? how is possible her boyfriend's blue sedan would disappear without a trace and then appeared in from of the ranger's station? what?  if so many people mysteriously gone missing at that particular highway section and at that specific rest stop, why there's no fbi involvement at all so far? why in heaven's name a motorcycle cop would possibly show up in the middle of the night? did we all knew that the next rest stop was about 60 miles away? so where this stupid cop show up? if that cop was crashed by that stupid yellow truck, if that young woman indeed was smart enough, why she didn't withdraw the cop's gun and should that killer kingdom come? and, folks, could you tell me why the director and screenwriters decided to let us listen several times to the girl's urinating sound? what's the purpose of continuously showing her in the filthy toilet cubicle to pee? just want us to become a voyeur peeping tom or what?
the stereotyped problem of watching horror movies or those alien movies is always like this: they treat viewers like morons who got the least brain and education and think they could get away with a stupid screenplay, a stupid director and a bunch of young actors who would do anything if only they could be casted in anything as long as it is called a movie. screaming, crying, cursing, gory bloody scenes, scary sound effects, special effects...anything goes. and it all started when you hid behind a corner, awaiting your friend come up, as soon as he or she just about to pass by, you jumped out and made a scary scream. but unfortunately, we are not childish kids anymore, and you should not stay in that age still try to scare people in the same way.

This was a damn scary, gory horror movie right in line with Saw or Wolf Creek (but similar to ""Joy Ride"" - which is far superior). It's dark, scary and pretty well done for a low budget, straight to dvd movie. The lead, Jamie Alexander is not bad.  Her character does make some stupid choices in the move.  Yes, there were things that made no sense and it was a little slow at times, but still a good horror movie, until the end, which was not satisfying. Plus, it looked like there was a ton of footage we didn't see in the movie but the only ""deleted"" material are two alternate endings. Almost a hit, but ultimately a miss.",1170028800,2,720,4.248175182481752
2625833,3,B000H2M2RA,"As already described, this is a Horror Thriller with a lot of inspiration borrowed heavily and without inhibitions from ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", when it comes to the overall setting and atmosphere, ""Joy Ride"" when it comes to the Psychopathic Killer, and ""The Hills have Eyes"" because of the Mutant like Son and his parents who act as apparent sympathizers or even accomplices of the Killer.

While this movie won't get any prizes for originallity, it does have its thrilling moments.  The main problem is, nonetheless, the lack of logic among the heroine.  When she has every reason to believe that something terrible just happend to her boyfriend, she finds a trailer where she seeks refuge from the Killer who she believes to be after her.  Here she actually finds a video of herself and her boyfriend while they are making love, which is only a few hours old.  Any normal person would by now try to get out of the trailer as fast as possible, but when a C.B. radio close to her rings she picks it up and starts talking to the other person on the line.  Even after finishing the conversation she stays in that trailer.  This is totally incoherent; I mean who in their right mind would stay at some stranger's trailer, where that video is.  If you put 1 and 1 together you just have to realize immediately that either a perverted peeping Tom made that video, which isen't exactly consolation, or even worse the Killer himself made it.  So why the hell stay in that trailer?  The small amount of alcohol that she drank can't explain this type of irrational behavior.  Another scene just totally defies any normal behavior.  Here the killer is coming toward Nicole,the heroine, with his pick-up truck; she manages to jump out of the way, thereby avoiding being hit by the truck.  In the event she flings her mobile phone away, only to pick it up in the next moment, as she decovers that the batteries have been removed by her sudden move.  So what does she actually do, she looks at the celluar for a second which is now dirty and throws it away.  Hello, anybody here who's thinking for a moment.  I mean, why not find the batteries, they can't be far away, and put them back in the phone??  Even if the phone didn't get a connection, as it did in the beginning of the movie, once the couple arrives at the deadly rest stop, it would be foolish and an absolute risk to leave the mobile phone behind, since a connection could easily be established else where.  This is another one of those scenes that just dosen't make any sense !

Also Nicole dosen't come across as likeable.  When she was with her boyfriend, she's behaving like a spoiled teenager, and often acting rather bitchy and demanding, as if nothing is good enough for her.

If the 2 unlogical scenes don't bother you and, the fact that a large portion of this movie is, to put it mildly, adoped from other aforementioned films, then this is certainly alright watching, if only for the thrills, which come rather frequently.  But if this is not the case, you'll be better off skipping this one.

By the way, the horror elements are absolutely in the background, which makes this movie more of a dark and morbid Thriller, than a Horror flick.",1169683200,3,3208,4.56993006993007

There are a few decent ideas lurking in this uninspired and dreary attempt at cashing in on horror junkies desperate for a fix (the conclusion of the strange and protracted visit in this film by Joey Lawrence is one; the odd family at the rest stop perhaps another) but not really enough to merit a viewing, really, believe me.

The gore is mostly fake looking.  Still I wanted to keep watching the film to see how things played out.  I was not completely bored but there are some slow moments.

2625837,1,B000H2M2RA,"I like horror, no, I love horror. My vast collection is comprised of 98% horror, a good deal of them are low budget schlockfests. Old films, films with no budget, etc. They have an excuse for being bad, and thus, are ""so bad they're good"".

 This film has no excuse whatsoever for being as bad as it is, except for an idiotic script and director. This film had the money, the technology, the time, and the eye-candy to be good. It's a simple premise for a film, nigh impossible to screw up. ""Rest Stop"" is one big screw up.

 It's expected that when a movie begins with a road trip, there will be an almost mandatory music video montage. Acoustic guitar will play, scenes of the happy travelers cruising along in their car past farms, cities, etc. will play out. They will fumble with the radio and make silly faces, smoke dope, laugh etc. The director chose to up that count a bit, and as a result several times in this film the viewer is sitting around watching what is effect a meaningless music video.

 The girl picks up a bottle of whisky and starts pugging away, and thus begins the next full-song, music video showcase. Shots of her swigging, crying, throwing things, etc, to the sound of the music.

  Fast-Forward time, several times this happens.

Long, drawn out sequences of characters crying, sappy music blaring, for what seems like an eternity. Everything in this movie is drawn out far longer than it needs to be, hence the title of my review. I ended up just fast-forwarding 5 minutes of what needed to be a one or two minute scene. We get it, the character is sad, they are crying. Move on.

 Fast-Forward

Now horror movie protagonists are not known for their intelligence, we all know this, but when the viewer is absolutely flogged with idiocy it's very hard to play dumb ourselves.

 - near-dead policeman lays at your feet, victim of the killer. The killer is ambling around like a drunken fool before you. Do you grab the policeman's gun? Do you perhaps grab the policemans radio? Not this idiot.

- The killer's vehicle is before you, empty with keys inside. Do you jump in and flee? Not this idiot.

- You have a deranged lunatic on your trail. You find a bottle of whiskey. Do you get so plowed that you finally pass out? This idiot chose to do so.

Im sorry, there's just no excuse for the sheer stupidity of the central character of this film, other than a reason to draw the film out. Like the aforementioned 5+ minute long scenes of crying and shaking her fists at the sky, the entire movie itself should have been boiled down, cut in half. The lead character is a stupid, whiny poltroon that had no right to survive the ordeal as long as she did. The killer, an incompetent moron.

And the stupid, almost randomly inserted ""wacky backwoods family"" was an utterly lame attempt to portray something like a Texas Chainsaw type backwoods brood. Unfortunately, they have none of the realistic panache that makes the aforementioned hicks from hell so memorable. There's some ok gore, but I can say without a doubt that it isn't worth sitting thru the rest of this absolutely tedious film. Thank God I only rented it",1168560000,29,3142,4.548845470692718

Rest stop is a film that i did like, yes its not perfect, but i have yet too see many films that are, but this film will appeal to true horror fans, not for its original plot nor for its great acting (though the acting isn't bad at all), but for the fact that it pushes the horror level a few notches up, from the boring teeny horror that never stops coming in the wake of scream. Where i live in australia there are no more drive ins left due to to large companies buying them out and trying to play major studio films on them. As a result the direct to dvd film has replaced the drive in so i see these films in a difrent way, i see them as the modern drive in flick. Look through films  that came out in the 60s, 70, 80s, and played at the drive ins, blood fest, evil dead, zombie, etc. see how fondly they are remembered today. In time people will be going back to films like Rest stop and releasing them as long lost classic horror. I can say that i saw evil dead at the drive ins in 1982 and cheered it as a horror classic will you be able to say,in 25 years from now.

Plot:

Again, for a no name film, of course the plot is going to be vauge. Two teens are moving out to California (i think it is). A boyfriend and a girlfriend. Along the way they stop basically in the middle of nowhere at a rest stop.  When the girl comes back from the rest room her boyfriend's gone.  The whole villian scene is portrayed by a weirdo dude in yellow/white old ford truck. The movie never really ends, the film just stops.  There is an ongoing story in the end, which kind of bugged me, but  you'll have that.

Pro's:

Interesting gore scenes.  The pyscho killer/stalker finds some interesting ways to tortue his victims.  Also, some of the other scenes were graphic, which at times had me on the edge of my seat.

There's a heaping amount of decent gore effects, but the sheer stupidity of the characters just makes you scratch your head and wonder.

2625851,3,B000H2M2RA,"What we have here is about 30 minutes of story stretched over 90 minutes of movie, most of which takes place in (what I can only assume is) a haunted public restroom.  Add oceans of gore and meaningless filler scenes, straight out of every other horror movie, and you've got the perfect combination for a night of terror and frustration.
  First off, the gore was top notch (I looked away at least once or twice, if not several times), but it seemed like this movie wanted to be more than what it was. At its's heart, I believe it wanted to be a psycho killer movie, but every now and again a supernatural element would rear its unwanted head (one minute the characters there, the next minute he/or she is gone with no explanation). As a result I found myself asking more questions as the story progressed.
Q: What did the killer look like?
- You never get to fully see him.
Q: Does he have some sort of supernatural power?
- One minute he's not there, and the next he is.
- Same for his victims; are they ghosts, or did our heroine just forget to take her medication that morning?
Q: Is peeing outside really that bad?
- The heroine makes her boyfriend take her to a rest stop to pee, instead of doing her lower business in the bushes.
- And she actually uses said bathroom, despite the fact that its easily the most disgusting place this side of Freddy Kruegers colon.
Q: Who thought this soundtrack would be ideal for a horror movie?
- I mean its possibly the worst ever.
- Definitely borrowed from a sappy teen romance flick.
Q: Why would she keep running back to that bathroom for cover?
- Its filthy, possibly haunted, and she knows Mr. Mentally Unbalanced  comes back every 15 minutes to check on her.
Q: What was the point of the ride she took with Leatherfaces family?
- They picked her up, didn't listen to a word she said, called her a whore about 30 times, then after she burst into the back room where they were keeping the mutant family photographer, they dropped her off exactly where they picked her up.
Q: Why was Joey Lawrence killed off without saying ""Whoa"" at least once?
- When he's not saying ""Whoa"" he's a terrible actor.
Q: Isn't the Heroine of a horror movie supposed to be likeable?
- She's strong, she's weak, she's a terrible actress, and she's annoying
Q: If you were being hounded by an psychotic, inbred maniac, why would you take the time to chronicle it on the bathroom stall?
- Apparently all his victims are doing it.
Q: Was the sheriff and the manson family in on it?
- They all had one common saying; ""You'll get what you deserve.""
- Aside from that, the sheriffs office had the sex tape, the two main  characters made, playing on the T.V
- The Mutant Candid Cameraman, at least from what I observed, was the one taking pictures of the victims for the ""Missing Persons"" posters
- Were they in on it' or were they just pointless distractions

  All in all I would've liked to have seen more of the torturous activities taking place on the abandoned school bus, and alot less of the same old bathroom. But I'll take what I can get.  2 Stars for the Gore and 1 for the tension.

MORAL OF THE STORY: Always use the bathroom before
  you leave the house.",1163635200,,3187,4.373942470389171
2625852,3,B000H2M2RA,"Warner really missed the boat on this one! The first release on their new spinoff horror company could have been marketed much better. They could have capitalized on the regurgitation of thematic elements craze like Austin Powers, Scary Movie and Not Another Teen Movie. Thats what this movie is, regurgitated thematic elements. Entertaining to some degree, but contrived.

Normally, the background score of a movie plays very little in my review of a movie. In the case of Rest Stop, I hated the music. It annoyed, it was blended in poorly and it was obviously selected/composed on a shoestring budget.

Nowhere near as good as Slither or even Feast for the recent horror movie DVD releases. Skip it until it makes the $6 bin.",1163203200,,727,4.854838709677419
2625853,1,B000H2M2RA,"A young couple decide to drive from Texas to California.  Along the way, somebody in a pickup almost runs into them;  the guy yells at the pickup driver and he speeds away, but apparently he's angry.  And unfortunately he's a psycho killer.  A bit later on, the couple stop at a rest stop so the girl can use the bathroom.  When she comes out, both the car and her boyfriend are gone.  She gets drunk.  Later, the guy in the pickup shows up.  He keeps appearing every 10 minutes or so throughout the movie.  The girl runs towards him, he drives away.  He seems like a pretty wimpy psycho killer.  Later on, she hides in the bathroom whenever he visits.

All she would really have to do is to run in the woods and follow the road back to a main highway.  But she's too stupid.  Later in the movie, she seems to start hallucinating - things will happen, then afterwards they seem not to have happened.  This is completely unexplained and honestly, it's just an extremely cheap plot device.  There's a ton of gore if you're into that.

Overall, idiotic girl, non-threatening killer, gratuitous gore, no plot what-so-ever.  I would definitely recommend skipping this.",1162425600,2,1163,4.590243902439024
2625854,2,B000H2M2RA,"This gorefest from director John Shiban (TV'S SUPERNATURAL) is illogical and full of plot holes, but star Jaime Alexander is excellent as Nicole, the young girl who finds herself the target of a sadistic killer at a deserted rest stop from hell.  Alexander throws herself into the role and carries the movie well; too bad the plot and direction don't live up to her standards.  There is no background on the killer's motives, even though he's been at it for almost 40 years; there's no explanation for the bizarre Winnebago family; and it's ending is another one of those ""we can't explain it so just let the audience make up their own explanation.""  I relish the days when horror movies' bad guys got their just desserts and the heroes rode off in the sunset; movies like this are indicative of today's pessimistic view on life.",1162166400,,829,4.703448275862069
2625855,5,B000H2M2RA,"...at least in comparison to movies like Slither.  I watched both movies yesterday.  Rest Stop kept me in suspense even though, as pointed out, there really isn't anything new under the sun here in Rest Stop.  Still, the production value is exceedingly high and well done.  As is the acting of the main character and the background characters.  There is a sense of ""what is reality and what isn't"" that makes you yourself question what is going on in each Act of the movie.  The gore effects were not in your face unless it helped the story line.  That is, the movie wasn't gory just to be gory, the violence was there to move the story along in the direction you yourself are not sure of until the dark and twisted ending (which is the best ending for the movie to have in comparison to the alternate endings shown on the DVD).  Ironically I would have thought that Rest Stop had been in theaters and, in comparison to Rest Stop, the movie Slither would have been direct to DVD due to its poor story, poor acting, poor gore effects.  Basically, everything Slither (as a movie that was placed in theaters) should have had, Rest Stop, which is a direct to DVD, does have.  Strange.  But true.  If you want to rent a movie to watch, a good scary movie, one that will twist your mind and make you question your own sanity, rent Rest Stop...if you want to be bored so badly that you begin to bang your head against the wall until your brains come out of your ears, well then rent Slither.",1161820800,4,1484,4.375912408759124
2625856,1,B000H2M2RA,"I saw the DVD in the store, so I picked it up. Big mistake. I had never heard of it before. I wish that were still the case. It's one of those classic cases where Halloween time sparks the release of horrible (not horror) movies.

There are two things that stand out to me:

1) It's totally implausible and

2) Does she ever stop crying and whining ?

The things that happen in this movie, and there is not a lot happening, just don't make sense. They get to the rest stop and the guy disappears, we don't know why. Though if I knew how emotional that actress would become, I would have left too. The cop / park ranger guy is an insult to the police force. Even to the guys from Police Academy. Oh yeah, and after she blows his brains out, um, twice, he just simply disappears. ""Oh you missed, shot me again !"" Yea.

Moments like this are happening throughout the film. She is sitting in this nasty bathroom, contemplating on what to do, while she could quite easily be skipping down the highway. Better hitch a ride with the demented creep family, with two weird Jewish boys and a deformed Mini-Me. Huh ? Excactly. Oh wait, the boyfriend is back, and still alive, but without a tongue. That will definitely hurt their relationship.

I wish somebody would have cut out HER tongue. Because all she is doing for 90% of the film, is crying. I assume the actress was following the directors pointers to look frightened and distressed. But somebody should have told her that whining, whimpering and crying for 90 minutes of screen-time is rather annoying. Even if somebody bites off your finger.

Writing anything more would give this film too much attention. Like most of the others have written before me: Stay away. Trust me, you would rather have dinner in that Rest Stop bathroom, than to waste your prescious life on this ridiculous pile of stupidity.

Amen.

2625857,1,B000H2M2RA,One of the worst movies I've ever seen.  If I could rate it lower than one star I would.  Not even worth the price of a rental.  Stay FAAAAR away.,1161561600,2,146,3.8
2625858,2,B000H2M2RA,"While it would be impossible to say that this horror film is the most aweful film ever, it would not be to far from the truth saying that it is a terrible one. It starts out promising with a dumb woman in a rest stop getting terrorized by an unseen stalker and then it landslides downhill from there. None of the acting is really that good but if I had to pick the person who did alright it would be Jaimie Alexander, the protagonist. Of course, as expected with any truly bad horror film, her character is as dumb as the cardboard box she was crafted from. Everyone else, including the all but lost Joey Lawrence, are damn near pathetic. The gore is ok in this film... although a little over the top in some points. The story is one that could have (and damnit... it should have been) cut down to an anthology length (this would fit in sort of well with the Masters of Horror series) and it probably would have been a lit better. As it is, the whole stretch of being at one Rest Stop is a bit dull after a while... even when she manages to venture out into a camper van full of really wacky nut cases. Top this lame puppy off with a dark (but incredibly unrealistic) ending and you have a truly low end attempt at being a scary halloween flick.",1161475200,4,1245,4.2133891213389125

This movie had good qualities but a bad ending, not only that but we really didn't see much emoiton for the victims.  It just seems that with the format of dialog and reactions, I believe the writer could have based a more sturdy emotional reaction for most characters.  I really didn't feel sorry for any of the victims in this film because truthfully, they didn't use common sence.",1161302400,2,551,4.48

Sometimes we yelled directions at the screen, sometimes we held our stomachs - we had a great time with this flick.  The best part about a movie with newcomers like Jaimie Alexander is that you'll never know who's going to get the axe.  I mean come on, not only will Michael Meyers never die, but neither will Jamie Lee!  I'm purchasing this for my Halloween party...  my boyfriend who's afraid of his own shadow, will at the very least appreciate the movie for the bare naked [...].

 John Shiban cut his entree into film as writer-producer of the X Files. You may remember his newborn son cast as baby William in a few episodes.

 In Rest Stop Mr. Shiban has an unflinching desire to continuously display the atrocities in a filthy and disgustingly dirty ladies room. The fact that the lady in question prefers this to a short jaunt in the woods is ridiculous. No woman would be caught dead or even think of entering this place. Enough already.

 This is a sick slasher sort of film that portrays brutality and violence but retrieves nothing for the viewer. The one star is for Jaimie Alexander who is obviously a fine actress trying to work her craft in a poor production.

 This is pure junk. The three alternate endings are junk.
