6078370,4,B00GJ6HQDI,"I've been catching this new series on cable with ""Free on in Demand"" & so far from the episodes I've seen, Beware the Batman's 1st season has been an enjoyable & promising new series. And as any hardcore fan will tell you, there's the obvious influence here from Christopher Nolan's Batman movies & it's a bit of a detractor for me, & not because I disliked his trilogy. It's just that it seems to be lately a serious over kill with making everything seem hyper real & at times it makes the characters & motives comes across as cold & numb. What happened to that sense of escapism that the Tim Burton films had & Batman the Animated Series? That aside I really love what they've done with Batman's costume which again looks like it came right out of all the Batman flicks & it works perfectly here. One of the biggest & most questionable stretches for me has been Batman's longtime dependable & sarcastic fixture, Alfred. This wonderful character's longstanding persona has been altered to what looks to be Jason Statham & why they did this I haven't the slightest clue. Perhaps modernize him for a new audience? Either way, they should've left well enough alone. What really shines about this show & keeps it separate from all the other previous Batman cartoons is the chance to finally see new villains instead of the standard rogues gallery that we're all familiar with. Bringing in Katana into Bruce Wayne's operation has also been a really nice & brave move too because the creators could of easily gone in another direction but it would've taken away some of it's creative edge I think. The cgi animation is much in the same vein as the recently great but short lived Green Lantern show & it's really awesome to behold dark Gotham City & all it's inhabitants in this medium. Looking forward to more of this show & watching how the story unfolds. What's great about all of the Batman animated series' is that they rarely repeat themselves & this latest iteration is even more proof of that. B+",1384387200,19,1998,4.615168539325842
6078371,5,B00GJ6HQDI,"As a long time Batman fan, I went into this series with a critical attitude. I did not want anyone messing with the Bat or his mythology. This series is a wonderful breath of fresh air that has totally won me over.

This take on the Dark Knight has quite a bit of divergence from the previous Batman tales and backstory. Instead of Alfred being a fairly helpless and weak background character, he is recast as a former secret agent with quite an interesting story arc of his own, which is constantly informing the story lines. He is also much younger and very active as a butt-kicking member of the revised Team Bat.

Interestingly enough, it looks like there is no Robin or other of the extended sidekick and ex-sidekick universe in this version of Batman. In place of Robin we have Katana , another former secret agent trained to the level of the League of Assassins and a great colleague for Batman as opposed to just another juvenile sidekick, and I dare say way more pleasant than Damien, the professional smart-ass version of Robin that we are afflicted with in The New 52 comics. Katana and Batman have an excellent relationship that is hard core professional.

The series also does an amazing and unexpected change to Batman by not using the usual canon of Bat-villains. The villains that show up in this series are known in the Batman comic universe, but are brought into sharp focus in the foreground of these stories. All of them - Professor Pyg and Toad, Mockingbird, Humpty Dumpty, and Anarchy to name a few - bring a whole new flavor to the Batman universe. Where are the Joker, Clayface, Poison Ivy, the Penguin, and Tow-Face? Who cares? I did not miss them.

I think the plot lines in this series are outstanding. I found myself really surprised and almost shocked at some of the twists and turns in the stories as they unfolded. The series did a lot of what the The New 52 is doing now in the comics: anything is fair game from the past, just bring it in with a new take or a twist on the old character or situation. So we see the Outsiders, Harvey Dent, Commissioner Gordon, Barbara Gordon, and many others in ways we have not seen them before. All this is at first disconcerting, but the way I resolved all of this is by thinking of the whole series as an Earth 4 or 5 variation on what we are familiar with - like a big Elseworlds story. Which, I would argue, is the only way that the second Batman movie trilogy works - but that's another discussion!

Kudos to Glen Murakami and his team for coming up with something that is really unique, interesting, and just a lot of fun. As a hardcore Batman and comics fan, I regard myself as a pretty good authority on the subject, and you can rest assures that I am VERY happy with this series and its impact and effect on the DC universe. It is too bad this series didn't run longer as the plot lines were extraordinarily interesting and would have been very interesting to see as they unfolded. And I want to tell you - that ""Beware the Bat"" theme is outrageously cool! It made me want to go check out the album and the band!  I hope that Glen Murakami and his cohorts have another shot at an animated series because they deserve it and it will be amazingly excellent!",1461974400,6,3232,4.423529411764706
6078372,4,B00GJ6HQDI,A enjoyable and well laid out animated film I found it worth watching and I would recommend it if you like animated flims.,1459987200,,122,4.3478260869565215
6078373,3,B00GJ6HQDI,"I love the show, I just don't understand how the DVDs are being packaged. I bought Shadows of Gotham, which are episodes 1-13, but I have no idea which will give me the remaining episodes since the item description and name of the DVDs are all different yet seem to refer to the first season.",1456963200,,292,4.327272727272727
6078374,4,B00GJ6HQDI,"The first part may not be that interesting to people who are in love with TAS (such as me), but despite building up really slowly, it all comes along nicely. The plot starts out thin and dull, but at least we get to see Batman use his critical thinking and give justice to the title of ""World's Greatest Detective"". There is an attention to detail unseen before in anything comic-animated, especially in the case of Batman with the recent incarnations (or shall I say blasphemous interpretations). The take on characters is different (while not welcomed by many, is actually good), and it complements the dark atmosphere, enhancing the Batman mythos. I really enjoyed seeing the new villains in action. There's a lot more depth to them that previous works. I recommend only watching this if you plan on going to Part 2, which was an epic conclusion to what this part started.",1455926400,,875,4.7631578947368425

6078392,5,B00GJ6HQDI,"I only hope this show continues.  I like the modern-day characters as well as the crisp looks of them.  I first saw this at a friends house one night after coming in from clubbing.  Got hooked on it.  Even now, when the show come on t.v., I will watch even though I have probably seen it multiple times already.  I also like not seeing Robin that much.  Many people tell me that buying animation on blue-ray is a waste of money.  Not so.  The crispness and deep saturation of color is worth the additional price you pay.  I just bought a 4K television set and can't wait to pop in all these blue-ray products I've bought over the years to see them in a new light and like them even more.  Whoever thought up the title ""Beware the Batman"" deserves a good handshake.  It does get separated from the original t.v. show from the late 60's, and the other animated Batman shows since then.  If you like to be consumed by a fantastic picture, buy this blue-ray version.  You won't be disappointed.",1418169600,6,990,4.373626373626373

6078407,4,B00GJ6HQDI,"When Beware the Batman was first unveiled to the public, it was met with a lot of prejudice. We would have yet another show centered around Batman. Gone were famous villains like the Joker and Poison Ivy in favor of lesser known villains like Anarky and Magpie. The cancellations of Young Justice and Green Lantern: The Animated Series did not help. This show needed to do a lot validate its own existence. Fortunately, what we got was a surprisingly solid series that holds up to the legacy of the franchise.

First of all, the emphasis on lesser known antagonists benefits the show as they provide new challenges and interesting scenarios for Batman to overcome. Professor Pig and Mr. Toad are a great villain duo, Humpty Dumpty is a frightening, yet tragic figure, and Anarky makes a great foil for Batman.

But the show isn't just about the villains. Seeing Batman facing these villains as well as the problems he faces as Bruce Wayne are also interesting. In most interpretations, Bruce Wayne is the ""mask"" for Batman. However, that isn't the case here. Here, Bruce Wayne is more of a philanthropist, using his fortune to invest in ways to help the world at large while his alter ego tackles crime to the street. Taking a cue from the Nolan films, the TV show touches on what kind of lifestyle someone like Batman would have. We see him seeking techniques to reduce his sleep time, he's on an all-liquid diet, etc. It's also worth mentioning that this series bring back the detective aspect of the character (an aspect not seen in a Batman TV show since Batman: The Animated series). All of these aspects bring a unique perspective on the character, which is a very good thing for a character who's story has been numerous times throughout the years.

As always, Alfred serves as Batman's ally, friend, and confidant. However, in this series, he is also Batman's mentor. This version of Alfred was an MI-6 agent earlier in his life. When Bruce Wayne's parents were killed, Alfred trained him under his wing. He also is more involved in the field as he helps Batman every now and then(masked, of course).

Speaking of supporting characters, we have another lesser known character in the form of Tatsu Yamashiro. (Comic fans may recognize her as ""Katana"") She has her own story and how they eventually tie in to the main story is very interesting. We have James Gordon(currently a Lieutenant) who develops an uneasy partnership with the Dark Knight.

The episodes are well paced. There is a nice blend between the story and the action. Nothing feels abrupt and the animation is very fluid. The art style could take some getting used to, especially with Batman's model. There also seems to be a surprising lack of people roaming the streets of Gotham, especially in places where you'd expect more people to be(although this gets fixed in later episodes).

Overall, I would recommend getting this series. This blue-ray contains the first 13 episodes, including episodes that haven't aired. Anyone with a blue-ray player and has the slightest bit of interest in Batman should consider picking it up.",1404777600,,3099,4.826741996233522

I had not seen it before purchasing the two-disc DVD set but was blown away by the writing, animation and new take on the Batman mythos. I thought all the changes were very interesting. I am disappointed this series has been cancelled and while I don't know the exact reason I will assume it was a poor business decision that ruined this.

By far the very best animated series that I have ever seen and that includes all of the previous Batman series that have come before.  I just can't see why no one will continue it.  The stories are just so very good and refreshing with villains rarely seen before.  One thing though.  Why is it that animators just have to have all of their toons with gigantic over-sized eyes, tiny waists and elongated legs???  Why can't they go to great comic artists such as Alex Ross, George Perez or Jim Lee and get characters that actually look real???

It also was a companion to the other DC ""Cartoon Network"" computer animated ""Green Lantern"".  I feel a great mistake was made by pulling these potential springboards for DC to bolster the upcoming movies of ""Batman Vs Superman"" and ""The Justice League"".  DC's short sightedness will be it's downfall.  Marvel right now is miles ahead in this game.  This series was fantastic.  It had everything going for it except for the gumption to go on.

6078426,4,B00GJ6HQDI,"I don't know what it is about animated shows based on DC Comics characters as of late. It seems that as soon as we get attached to them, they disappear from the television line-up. ""Beware the Batman"" is the latest show to go the way of the Bermuda Triangle and vanish into thin air.

It went on hiatus and was supposed to return to the Cartoon Network roster in January 2014 but never did. Thankfully, Warner Bros. has released the first thirteen episodes of the series on Blu-ray and DVD as ""Beware the Batman: Shadows of Gotham - Season One Part One."" Hopefully, it will help tide fans over until new episodes arrive in some form.

Gotham City is overrun by crimes committed at the hands of masked villains and other malicious forces. The police department, led by Lieutenant James Gordon, is constantly trying to keep up with the evil schemes. Many times they come up shorthanded. A mysterious avenging angel calling himself the Batman lends a hand in the war against corruption, swearing an oath to defend his city against lawlessness and wrongdoing.

""Beware the Batman"" was intended to take the place of the lighter-hearted ""Batman: The Brave and the Bold,"" which ended after three seasons. A much darker take on the Dark Knight's mythos, it's more based on the newer ""Batman: Earth One"" re-telling of the hero's early days of fighting crime versus the campy feel of the 1960's television show we were used to from ""Batman: The Brave and the Bold.""

Just like in ""Batman: Earth One,"" Alfred Pennyworth isn't just young Bruce Wayne's butler. He's a battlefield-trained ex-medical officer who actively helps the Batman fight crime and solve mysteries. The Caped Crusader is also assisted in his endeavors by the sword-wielding Katana.

The audio and video for ""Beware the Batman: Shadows of Gotham - Season One Part One"" will please home viewers. It's presented in a 1080p High-Definition 16x9 (1.85:1) format accompanied by Dolby Digital 2.0 sound. The picture is clean and vibrant and all the sound effects, dialogue, and music are well-balanced.

""Beware the Batman: Shadows of Gotham - Season One Part One"" is a bare-bones Blu-ray and DVD release. There are no extra features to be found on the release. it's a shame they didn't include some interviews with the voice actors or show runners.

Although ""Beware the Batman: Shadows of Gotham - Season One Part One"" is not rated, some warning needs to be given to parents. There's a good amount of comic book violence to be found. The villainess Magpie is scantily clad in a costume that is reminiscent of something you'd see a dominatrix wear in an S&M club. I don't really know what the reasoning is in having her dressed like this in a Saturday morning cartoon for kids.

I really enjoyed ""Beware the Batman: Shadows of Gotham - Season One Part One"" and hold onto hope that we'll get the new episodes being aired overseas right now in the U.S. at some point. Even if Cartoon Network doesn't air them, I'm sure they'll pop up on Blu-ray and DVD sometime. If you like your Batman dark and enjoy a lot of the newer villains introduced in the comic books over the past few years, you'll no doubt love this show. The CGI animation can be off-putting at times, but if you can just look past it and get to the heart of the stories you'll find a wealth of entertainment.",1396396800,2,3321,4.703958691910499
6078427,4,B00GJ6HQDI,The show is well written. It has a good plot and leaves you hanging in the last episode. I would preferred a season set and some bonus features.

Everything about this series is great. The visuals, CGI, music and computer imageries are just fascinating. Storyline is also great. Not too complex and not too plain meaning that if you haven't seen previous series about batman, or are not that much into comic books, you will still like this one. The voice acting was also very decent. They just found the right person to voice every character.

The assertiveness of batman also the beauty of female characters such as lady Shiva, katana, magpie,..  was very interesting. Alfred was alright, I think he needed to appear a little older.

All in all a great series. Shame on cartoon network for pulling the plug on this beautiful and fascinating show.",1394496000,,801,4.824817518248175
6078436,5,B00GJ6HQDI,"How did this show get canceled?! Its great! The creators made some changes to the most familiar iteration of the Batman, but they all worked very well, I felt. Alfred is younger and is a former MI6 agent and Batman teams up with a female ninja named Katana, rather than with Robin. They use Batman's lesser-known villains rather than focusing so much on Joker, Riddler, etc, and that was a nice change. They could have brought in the more familiar ones later anyway. I felt that you got to see Batman being more of a detective than usual, which was also nice, and Gotham is a very noir-like city. Very cool. And the action is excellent. Even though Batman takes some lumps, he always appears as the supremely skillful fighter that he is.

As far as the blu-ray goes: this show looked excellent when broadcast in hi-def on Cartoon Network, but the blu-ray image is even more spectacular! I was blown away by how crisp and colorful everything looked. Perfect! I don't know why some of these shows are broadcast in 5.1 audio but then have only stereo sound on the blu-ray, but the HD-Master 2-channel soundtrack on this disc sounds great. It surely would sound even better with 6-channel sound, but for once I have no problems with this stereo audio. There are no special features on this disc, which is very disappointing, but I loved the show so much that it doesn't really bother me.

This is a great take on the Batman character, and the picture and audio on the blu-ray are outstanding. The voice actors are great and the stories are fresh and fun. Again I would say: How did this great show get canceled!? I just hope they bring it back in some form. I'd love some movies or, even better, another limited 13-episode run. (I think I could repeat most of this review regarding the recently-canceled Green Lantern animated show. Another excellent show that somehow was cut short. I've already pre-ordered that season one blu-ray.)",1394496000,5,1930,4.656891495601173

The 12 episodes that are on this dvd are very good. Especialy the 2 that cartoon network refuse to show. This show was well did voice acting and animation was second to none. It just ashamed that CN decided not to allow this show to grow and survive thus quickly given this batman series the ax.
There is 1 thing that should have been inclued in dvd. There should be a voice talk in 1 of episodes or a behind the mask story telling of this batman story.

Trust me it grows, you are bound to be confused with this version of Alfred and the villains, the more falible Batman but the script keeps getting better and the arc build.

This is a series that people that do not love the character from the comics and are unfamiliar with the many takes on the mythos of Bruce Wayne will find lacking, sadly the casual fan is taking over all of entertainment.",1393804800,3,724,4.43609022556391
6078439,5,B00GJ6HQDI,"What Executive Producer and show-runner Sam Register has done with 'Beware the Batman' is the seemingly impossible. While there is no way to verify this, after watching every episode of the series' ""Shadows of Gotham: Season One, Part One,"" you get the feeling the entire endeavor started this way. He assembled a team of top animation craftsmen and women, and then took them on a journey 75 years into the past. Back to the dark mythos of `The Bat-Man' that artist Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger created in Detective Comics #27, and upon whom for 9 more issues they pilled on so much mystery, darkness, violence and vulnerability as a human vigilante that the editors of Detective Comics finally freaked out.

'The Bat-Man' had his final solo appearance in Detective Comics #37. What followed was Detective Comics #38 and ""The Sensational Character Find of 1940 - Robin the Boy Wonder."" The Bat-Man of the stories that filled those 10 issues of Detective Comics from #27, May of 1939 through #37, March of 1940 would not reemerge for 30 years. It was 1970 when writer Denny O'Neil and artist Neil Adams returned ""The Batman"" to his roots as a solo vigilante/detective with the dark stories ""The Secret of the Waiting Graves"" and ""Paint a Picture of Peril.""

This seems the only logical creative explanation as to how Register was able to lead his entire crew behind `Beware the Batman' into making it the most unique and visionary `reboot' of the character in the medium of film and television since Christopher Nolan's `Batman Begins' and Bruce Timm's Emmy winning ""Batman: The Animated Series.""

""Beware the Batman"" has the same type of groundbreaking `vibe' that Timm's 1992 show had when it arrived. First and foremost, this is a series with a story that continues from episode-to-episode. While certain stories do have a `stand-alone' feel, the main characters of Bruce Wayne, Batman, Alfred, Tatsu Yamashiro, Lieutenant James Gordon and even minor characters such as Barbara Gordon all evolve and move forward through the series' overall arc.

This decision by Register, along with producers Glen Murakami and Mitch Watson, is vital given how complex they've chosen to reinterpret the series classic characters. Per the `Beware the Batman' imdb.com trivia page, ""According to producer Mitch Watson, Batman has three aspects to his personality: ""There's the public Bruce Wayne, who we modeled slightly after Richard Branson, more of an altruistic guy whose company's trying to do good. The private Bruce is more introspective guy who really only deals with Alfred at the beginning of the series; he's quiet, a little bit obsessive about particular things. And finally, there's the Batman.""

The series' writers, including standouts Mitch Watson, John Matta, Matt Weinhold and Len Wein, literally WRITE `the public Bruce Wayne,' `the private Bruce Wayne' and `the Batman' AS THREE SEPARATE CHARACTERS. The series directors include such legends as Curt Geda and Sam Liu, and they've all developed distinct `movements, mannerisms and facial expressions' for the TWO Bruce Waynes and The Batman.

Actor Anthony Ruivivar (`The Adjustment Bureau' along with television's `Major Crimes' and `Southland') has literally developed three performances for his role as Bruce Wayne/The Batman, and there are times in the series - when the drama reaches adult heights - that the audience understands why Alfred is so concerned about insuring someone is always there to watch out for Wayne.

Ruivivar can switch from one Wayne to The Batman to the other Wayne in transitions so distinct, you could easily forget it's the same actor playing the same parts.  For the first time since Michael Keaton's performance as Bruce Wayne and Batman in Burton's 1989 original ""Batman,"" the audience is forced to consider the possibility that Bruce Wayne may be walking a fine line between `control' and `insanity.'  In climactic episode of `Season One, Part One"", Ruivivar even voices a distinct, unique Thomas Wayne. The guy is that good.

And the same must be said for the rest of the cast. Voice Acting veteran JB Blanc is perfect as a younger Alfred Pennyworth, a former MI6 Agent who, when forced, gives as good as he gets. Sumalee Montano's performance as Tatsu Yamashiro is perfectly metered, with her performance greatly aiding the writers and directors as her true identity and secrets are revealed.

Kurtwood Smith (""That 70's Show,"" ""A Time to Kill,"" ""Broken Arrow"" and ""Robocop"") is a pure delight as Lieutenant Gordon. His scenes with The Batman as they forged a very uneasy alliance give Smith a chance to play frustration and anger that gives way to humor and humanity.

In giving audiences a more complex Batman, a younger and tougher Alfred, and adding Tatsu Yamashiro into the mix, initially as Wayne's limo driver, the producers wisely chose to go with villains rarely seen, and some never before depicted in animation or live-action. What makes them all work is the combination of character design, CG animation, movement, texturing (here's a show where the costume designer's work - thanks to CGI - is shown off in brilliant detail unlike any animated series in history) and, above all, the writing and voice casting.

Professor Pyg, AKA Lazlo Valentine, is voiced by Brian George, who plays him as a hilarious parody of Alfred Hitchcock. It's when he brings out his surgical tools, and the extent of his plans is revealed, that his character becomes truly horrific. Accompanying him as Mister Toad, Udo Kier provides great comic relief. Fiona Hughes' Lady Shiva conveys the menace and dishes out the malice those familiar with her character have come to expect. Grey DeLisle's Magpie is fascinating - introduced in the seductive manner of Selena Kyle, she's also a tragic figure whose conclusion in one episode is haunting.

Even when a villain like Humphrey Dumpler is introduced, and cynicism sets in that the episode will be one of the `weak links,' the writers add genuine human tragedy, and cast the perfect actor - in this case Matt Jones - to make the absurd dramatic.

With all great films and television series, their success, impact, and ability to transcend the technological leaps that follow in the wake of their production rest on the merits of their scripts, conceptualization, originality, acting, and the willingness of their creators to go to places others haven't with regard to subject matter.

It is because `Beware the Batman' falls into this category of greatness, its use of full CGI is not only befitting the material, it was the only logical choice.

When Tim Burton made ""Batman"" in 1989, he went with costume designs and art direction that mixed the styles and architecture of the `30s with an ambiguous `high/low tech' look. Cinematographer Roger Pratt shot with such low light levels and so much steam that when US theater owners saw the exhibitor screening, many freaked out. They feared the bulbs in their projectors wouldn't be bright enough, and that audiences wouldn't be able to see what was happening on screen.

Bruce Timm and his team made an insane choice in 1991 when starting work on `Batman: The Animated Series.' They decided all backgrounds would be painted on black paper stock, not white. While it meant that dust and scratches had the potential to be more obvious in the series than any other animated show ever made, it guaranteed a very dark, unique and moody tone to the series.

In rebooting Batman, Christopher Nolan wanted as much realism as humanly possible. He shot ""Batman Begins"" on as many real locations as possible, including a glacier in Iceland on which actors Christian Bale and Liam Neeson could feel the ice shifting beneath their feet. Nolan also insisted on shooting all second unit work himself, and only resorting to model or CGI when an effect couldn't be done in camera.

Sam Register and his Art Department, Visual Effects crew, Character Designers, Vehicle Designers, Background Designers and Set Designers have created a totally new Gotham City, Wayne Manor, Batcave, Batmobile, and countless other locations, rooms, props and atmospheric locations. His directors and animators have rendered them in glorious CGI. Viewed in its Blu-Ray release, ""Beware the Batman"" has textures so real you can practically feel what you are seeing on the screen.

A huge amount of credit must be given to the series' incredible sound designer and re-recording mixer Robert Hargreaves, along with the entire sound department. ""Beware the Batman"" is also blessed in having the talented composer Frederik Wiedmann for all 13 Episodes of ""Season One, Part One."" While Vasalines and Iggy Pop inspired rock band Dum Dum Girls delivered a great, punk/pop main title theme for the show, it is Wiedmann's scores for each episode that do what all great film scores do - give the visual experience its emotional voice.

Frederik Wiedmann takes the time in each episode to develop themes for newly introduced characters, alternating between rock and orchestral infused scores depending upon what the episodes and moments demand.  Several episodes contain very dark, almost tragic endings - reminiscent of Hitchcock's ""Vertigo"" or ""Psycho."" It is the power of Wiedmann's music in those episodes that elevate those endings to levels of heartfelt tragedy or dread.

""Beware the Batman,"" like all groundbreaking Batman reboots which preceded it, feels like it truly began by turning to specific comic book source material.  One can't help but feel Register chose to go right back to the very beginning -  ""The Bat-Man""'s very first, dark, brooding, violent and forgotten stories from May of 1939 through March of 1940.

In watching ""Beware the Batman,"" you sense the producers, writers and directors are in tune with where The Bat-Man was in his last solo appearance in Detective Comics #37.  The series feels, with regard to The Batman, that Register's creative team have taken the character where Kane and Finger would have had Detective Comics not stopped them from plunging further down the rabbit hole with The Bat-Man as he was originally created and developed.

Like all great reboots, by using these forgotten stories as the psychological basis for this new interpretation of The Batman, Register and his team were able to explore the psychology of Bruce Wayne and Batman in a way only Tim Burton and Michael Keaton had touched upon 24 years ago with ""Batman"" (1989).  Bruce Wayne and The Batman of ""Beware the Batman"" is a version modern audiences simply have not seen before.

This, in turn, gave Register and his team license to reinterpret Alfred, introduce new villains, redesign the look of Gotham, and embrace doing it all with CG Animation to insure ""Beware the Batman"" - like all great reboots - bore it's own unique visual stamp, allowing its creators to realize the world of Batman in a way no one has ever experienced it before.

By utilizing CG Animation, Register and his team have given audiences an entirely new emotional and visual interpretation of arguably the greatest comic book character ever created, and a visual reinterpretation of his legendary mythological world previously unseen.  CG animation was the only way all of this could be accomplished.

What a pity then, perhaps an outrage, that `Beware the Batman' may not live long enough to see the second half of its first season even air on Cartoon Network's `DC Nation.' After its premiere on July 13, 2013, the show was abruptly, and with no reason given, pulled from Cartoon Network's schedule the week of October 23, 2013. In October of 2012, Cartoon Network did the same thing with DC Animation's `Young Justice' and `Green Lantern: The Animated Series.' Those two programs eventually saw their final episodes of their respective seasons air, but it came after cancelation announcements.

Still, it seems the blame can't be placed solely on Cartoon Network's lack of enthusiasm for ""Beware the Batman."" The show also launched with no merchandising push from DC Collectibles or any of their licensees. Buried in Mattel's `Batman Unlimited 2013 Series 03' line of figures, along with a new Frank Miller ""The Dark Knight Returns"" Batman figure, was a single ""Beware the Batman"" figure. As a figure in a `series' line, you had to turn the box around to learn it was ""Batman as seen on the animated series...Beware the Batman.""

Perhaps most indicative of the series' fate is the fact that this licensed product for the show, an action figure, was labeled by DC Comics on the packaging as part of their `Adult Collector' line.

Indeed, ""Beware the Batman"" may be that rare thing - the first adult Batman animated series that's too grown-up for the Cartoon Network, merchandising, and multiple seasons. With all of Marvel's shows now aimed at little kids, and older Marvel fans abandoning them in droves, ""Beware the Batman"" may be the last artistic, adult Batman series fans will see for a very, very long time.",1393804800,26,12939,5.040730337078652

6078441,4,B00GJ6HQDI,"While this is not the classic Batman that everyone knows (it's obviously set on one of the many Earth's in the multiverse), it was a very well produced show.  Set in what seems to be his early years of crime fighting, he is still feeling his way.

Many people complained about the role Alfred plays.  Alfred has always been more than just a butler.  He has been Bruce Wayne's confidante, mentor, protector, and friend.  The back story of Alfred being a former MI6 agent is nothing new.  Many classic Batman stories told of Alfred's past as a spy.

There were also complaints about Katana being his partner in the series instead of Robin.  Again, I assume this takes place on another Earth (like Young Justice) so there are likely to be differences.  I found it to be refreshing watching the relationship form between them.

I'm afraid this is likely to be all we will see of this series.  It has been off Cartoon Network's schedule for quite some time now and the last 2 episodes have yet to be aired (at least those who have purchased this will get to see them).  Networks now just don't seem to give shows a chance to build a following (I'm still miffed about Green Lantern being cancelled after only one season).  I think if the show had been run in prime time and had more showings it might have caught on.

I gave this 4 stars because there were no extra features included.  I'm sure Warner could have at least included trailers of upcoming releases.  I guess that shows how they feel about the series.",1393286400,8,1507,4.485294117647059

6078443,5,B00GJ6HQDI,"Im a Batman fan, and Ive been with the character through The Animated Series, Batman Beyond, The Batman, and Brave and the Bold. This new series changed things up by offering different villains, a new take on Alfred, an alternative sidekick, and CGI graphics. Many people whined about these changes before seeing the finished product, but I went in with an open mind. Even now, some whiny fanboys still complain about this show, but their opinions don't matter, because they were determined to hate this show no matter what. As I said before, Im a Batman fan, and if you are too, let me strongly recommend you purchase this show. This may sound blasphemous, but I find this show to be superior to The Animated Series. Let me tell you why this show works so well.

1. The serialized continuity. Episodes of this series aren't just random stories meant to showcase the villain of the week. Every episode flows into the next, setting up an overall arc that carries out over the whole set. I dare you to watch just one, because each episode leaves you wanting to see what happens next. This sort of storytelling sets this show apart. The writing was clearly intended for an older audience who can keep up with all of the plot elements, and the plots are dense.

2. The writing. This may have been aired on Saturday mornings, but the writing is over the head of the kids who were watching. These episodes are packed with story, depth, and emotion. You really have to pay attention to everything said, or you will miss an important detail. Compare this to The Batman, a series where the dialogue was atrocious. Beware the Batman was written with an intelligent audience in mind, not meant to be a dumbed down cartoon for the kids.

3. Batman. This version of Batman is the Batman I think most people like. Hes cocky, hes a brilliant detective, and hes an expert fighter. Sometimes he gets overtaken, because hes still fairly new to the vigilante gig, but overall, Batman owns his adversaries here. And for once, the detective skills possessed by Batman are put on display front and center. Again, you have to pay attention or you will quickly miss important details. And one more thing: This Batman is so dedicated to being the best he can be, that Bruce Wayne is on an all liquid diet, which Alfred must blend for him. Its details like that that really make this show special.

4. The CGI. It took a little getting used to, but once you get adjusted, it works well. Batman and his whole cast of characters look fantastic in this format. Gotham City looks like a real city, which makes this setting more believable. Because the city was built with CGI, the camera is able to pan around and offer amazing shots of the city. Camera pans are actually done quite often in this show, and it pulls you in and makes you feel you are in this world. These camera movements could not be done so well with traditional animation.

5. The choice of villains. We all like the Joker and company, but theyve been used many times, and Batman is bigger than them. The villains in this show become classic in their own right, and they give Batman a challenge we haven't seen over and over again. Trust me, you won't be twiddling your thumbs and missing the Joker as you watch the show.

6. Katana. She works better than Robin, and it makes more sense to have her as a sidekick. Shes smart, skilled, and even offers some necessary humor to the show.

7. The music. Rather than creating bombastic scores to follow along with the characters and action, the music is very simple and streamlined. It adds to every scene without trying to be too noticeable.

8. The voices. Every voice works. Every actor becomes the character they're playing, which makes it more believable. It helps that these scripts weren't written to be kiddie fare, giving the actors real material to work with.

Bottom line is this: There is something for everyone to enjoy here (except whiny fanboys). This show is smart. Its got story, action, and characters to draw you in, and there is no filler. Everything works together to take the show from episode one through episode thirteen. Give this show a chance. You won't be sorry. Its the best Batman series I have ever seen, and I own them all.

As far as Cartoon Networks treatment of this show, well Cartoon Network is where cartoons go to die these days. CN only wants to air unfunny comedies meant for people with ADHD. Beware the Batman was too intelligent for CN, so they purposely did not promote it, put it in a bad timeslot, and pulled the show before it could build an audience. Some people have complained about this show (yeah, you know by now, the whiny fanboys), and they have made ignorant comments like This show sucked! Glad it was canceled! Now they can make something better! These people will be disappointed to find that that won't happen. Any future DC shows on CN will be in the form of the putrid Teen Titans Go (or Teen Titans No!), as I said before, CN likes braindead comedies. The lesson is this: CN is a wasteland, and whiny fanboys whine just to hear themselves whine. Dont let Beware the Batmans abrupt cancellation by CN, or the collective and worthless jeers of whiny fanboys, deter you from this show. Beware the Batman is a must have. I just watched all the episodes, and I plan to do so again real soon, because its that good.",1393200000,8,5357,4.5592515592515594
6078444,2,B00GJ6HQDI,"This series let me down. Majorly. From the D Class Villains to the uninspired scripts. Weak character development and poor character motivation are things that are not welcome in any adaptation of the Batman Mythos. Even the Mid 2000's series ""The Batman"" is twice the show this is. Replacing Robin with Katana and Catwoman with Maggpie seem like good ideas until we realize these characters are just as bland and underwritten as Batman, Alfred, and the rest of the characters. I will not be watching the rest of this series. It might be interesting to some, but to me it can't compare to what has come before: Batman: The Animated Series, Batman Beyond, and The Batman.",1392940800,5,670,4.7844827586206895
6078445,5,B00GJ6HQDI,"While this show is basically about a younger Bruce Wayne perfecting his skills as Batman, this show also introduces alot of new characters. It was refreshing to see some new faces and slowly points its way to one of Batman greatest foes. Many people have complained about the look of the show, or about the new villains that Batman faced, but to be honest it was quite well done. Some of the new villains were very interesting and even offered a challenge to the Bats.

I mean they could of always just thrown in one of the classic villains, but that would be to easy for them. This show was meant to showcase some of other less known villains and it worked. Of course towards the end of the season we are gifted with hints of who is coming to Gotham, and Im sure it was done to give the Batman: The Animated Series fans something to cheer about as a well known foe shows up.

If you are honestly a Batman fan, love the animated series, then youll like this. Yea, the animation is different, but thats the way this new ""animation"" is going, and it really wasn't bad, just got to get use to it.",1392940800,2,1093,4.27536231884058
6078446,5,B00GJ6HQDI,"Wow, it seems like I waited YEARS for this to be released. Since my wife and I made the decision over two years ago to end the madness that is DirecTV, Dish, cable or anything else that was sucking us dry because of the maybe 10-15 shows we watched collectively, I am not sure how I learned about BtB. Sure, you can ALWAYS find something to watch, but we determined the costs outweighed the benefits, and that my insomnia did not need any more help. However, when I did find out about it, I searched for it on the Amazon app on our Vizio, and decided to purchase the first episode. I enjoyed it immensely, but I felt each episode cost more than I wanted to pay without having the physical version of it. That was months ago and as I started watching it yesterday on its release, my wife came in on it and started enjoying it herself. I always get tickled when I am able to get her to watch something that she otherwise would say, ""I don't wanna watch that!"" Ha! As a child, I had Batman everything, even cried while in the hospital when my grandmother brought me a Superman puzzle--I pitched a fit! I severely wanted Superman to get, UP! UP! AND AWAAAY! She returned it and I, of course, got what I wanted. As you read the other reviews, I think so much has been said that I am only giving you this: YOU NEED TO GET THIS! MAN! This was so worth the wait! Granted, Alfred is as big as Bruce/Batman, and Katana is refreshing yet surprisingly a tasteful change from the mythos, but it all works so well together and makes such sense. The animation is appropriate for this, and I can see where Robin could get introduced if wanted, if you were wondering about that. (A minor spoiler alert--While Anarky is introduced here(I am not sure if he existed before Batman: Arkham Origins), his appearance is very different although the voice seems very much the same.) Right now, I am on a huge Batman kick, with the comics and the games. And as much as my wife has made a note of that, she will sit down and enjoy all of this with me. I guess Batman is not just for the fellas, anymore.",1392768000,8,2075,4.282442748091603
6078447,5,B00GJ6HQDI,"This is a dark, younger Batman, reasonably new to the Gotham City night.  James Gordon is still a police lieutenant who doesn't trust Batman.  Batman's never had a Robin for a partner.  It's just Bruce Wayne and Alfred, his loyal butler.

Alfred... well, Alfred is a former British agent who is not only a manservant, but is also training Batman.  Not the old TV retainer, but rather a bodyguard for Bruce Wayne and confidant to Batman.  After the initial shock wore off, I discovered I like this version of Alfred.

Tatsu is brought in as a driver for Bruce Wayne when Alfred is hurt early on.  Over the course of several episodes, the young Japanese woman discovers Batman's secret identity, and we find out that she was a secret agent who infiltrated the League of Assassins - the ninja-like group who will end up being the driving villains for the series.  Tatsu becomes the masked Katana, fellow crime fighter and student of Batman.

If you've read Batman comics for awhile, you might find that Katana reminds you of Cassandra Cain in a lot of ways, which I welcomed.  She's more like the former Batgirl than like the comic book Katana, in my opinion.

If you're looking for the traditional Batman rogue gallery, you won't find it.  Here, we have Anarchy, Magpie, and the League of Assassins, led by Lady Shiva and Ra's al Gul.  No Joker, Riddler or Catwoman.  But that's OK - the villains work for this series.

The art is the same sort of 3-D rendering as the Green Lantern Animated series was.  The glossy black outfits worn by our heroes work for the most part, although Batman's cowl is a bit strange.  Katana looks really good and her creation of her own costume is both inspired and hilarious.  In fact, Katana gets most of the seriously funny lines, and her voice actress delivers them well.

This DVD collection is only the first 13 episodes of the series.  Only the first 11 were broadcast in the Fall of 2013, so two episodes are completely new here.  There's a cliffhanger ending to the 13th episode, so hopefully the remainder of the first season will be quickly forthcoming.

If you liked Green Lantern's animated series, you should get this.  If you like Batman, you should get this.  If you want to see Lady Shiva fighting, you should get this.  If you enjoy fun animated series, you should get this.

So really - all of you should pick up this series.",1392681600,6,2373,4.588095238095238
6078448,5,B00GJ6HQDI,"I was skeptical of this show at first, but truly blown away once I started watching.  I think this is the closest we've gotten in a good long while to the quality of Batman: The Animated Series as far as a pure Batman TV show.  I'm not overlooking the brilliance of Batman Beyond, which I'd say is a continuation of Batman: TAS or the campy fun and action of Batman: The Brave and the Bold.

I hope this show continues on, because it has promise.  Batman and Katana have a fascinating dynamic, and a younger Alfred adds an interesting element, since he can partake in some of Batman's missions and all.  The use of lesser known villains keeps the series fresh and presents Batman with something other than being hung over a vat of acid at the end.  There also seems to be an overall story arc here, which really ramps up the tension as the show goes on.

The voice acting is superb.  Anthony Ruivivar as Batman is great and unique.  Sumalee Montano is memorable as Katana.  Kurtwood Smith as Lt. Gordon, and Tara Strong returning as a young Barbara Gordon.  You can't go wrong, they're all solid.

My only criticism is that it often seems like no one lives in Gotham.  Probably this is a budget issue, as it seems like the sets are devoid of traffic and the busy nature of a large metropolitan area like Gotham.  I suspect that a larger budget would help with that, and this show would get even better as it gets older.  (Unfortunately, I gather from the other comments that this show is going to be short-lived...)  I've already got all the episodes Amazon is offering by Instant Video.  I suggest that anyone who likes this show and can afford it buy up a copy of this show to show CN that we will support more episodes if they keep making them.  $$$ is the only language CN is going to understand, so if it doesn't sell, they'll axe it.",1392681600,6,1839,4.374631268436578
6078449,5,B00GJ6HQDI,"""Beware the Batman"" is a computer animated, 30 minute series which is inspired by the decades old ""Batman: Year One"" comic book series written by Frank Miller.

Here, we see Batman as he was in the early days of his career: brilliant but arrogant, inspired but raw, practiced but inexperienced.  He is assisted by a more experienced and very patriarchal Alfred the Butler and, ultimately, by a young and equally enthusiastic young woman with a wealth of martial arts training: Katana.

""Beware the Batman"" the series stays away from the more generic and ""done to death"" villains such as The Joker, The Penguin, Catwoman, etc., and instead utilizes villains from a later pantheon of rogues such as Anarky (created by Alan Grant) and Mister Pyg (created by G. Morrison) among others.

Here's the big problem with this brilliant series: it airs on Cartoon Network.  Yes, the same network that has funded years of useless shows such as ""Squidbillies,"" ""Aquateen Hunger Force"" and other horrid animated titles that languished for years in their ""Adult Swim"" cult block of stoner-fugue.  This same network has a nasty reputation for unexpectedly killing titles that do not focus only on fart jokes and that is the the case with ""Beware the Batman"": as of November, 2013, word went out that Cartoon Network decided to pull the plug on this promising series less than six months after it premiered.  Why?  Only the block of ""geniuses"" at Williams Street know for sure and I doubt you would be willing to hear the reasons, buried as they would be among a slew of ""um,"" ""you know"" and ""like.""

I would highly recommend this series to all fans of Batman.  The character design of Batman as well as Gotham and the Bat-vehicles is reminiscent of Anton Furst's brilliant work in the Burton Batman films.  The writing and character development are excellent.  ""Beware the Batman"" is worthy successor to Bob Kane's original vision for the character (even if he did change what that vision was many times) and is worth a purchase to see all the elements come together.

Buy it now while you can and show your support for a series that is many levels above the network which it and its creators have had to deal these past few years of painful development.",1392595200,51,2238,4.781818181818182
6078450,5,B00GJ6HQDI,"With this animated series, the creators took a lot of risks. They introduced new villains, who are just as menacing as the old ones, did away with Robin and introduced a new side-kick, which fell more in line with the plot and story than ever before, and re-imagined Alfred, the butler, into an ex-MI6 agent. Which gives a lot more credibility to Bruce Wayne's path to becoming a  crime-fighting super-hero. The series got a lot of flak for its reimagining of the DC characters, but I think that is exactly where they excelled. I think it's a shame they stopped the series. They should bring it back. This is definitely worth the money!",1387843200,36,636,4.628318584070796

I loved the fresh approach to all the characters,more detective than most cartoons,and this Batman remind me of the Bale type Batman,serious,with brief flashes of humor. The animation is wonderful,its very stylized,but I got into it right away,its well written,not silly at all,I lied it so much I bought the second Blu-ray too.

8623753,5,B00GJ6HQDI,"This may sound like blasphemy to fellow TAS fans, but I think this is the best version of Batman that showcases everything that makes him awesome: the detective, the crime fighter, the shadowy figure, the martial artist, and strategist.

I think it was a bold choice to go with the 3D animation style, and once you get used to it, really works here. I also like the choice to focus on some of the lesser known characters from the comics as some of the other reviews have already mentioned. There's no Joker, no Scarecrow, no Catwoman, and no Penguin(though he does get a reference) on this show. There's also no Robin. The Alfred on this series is the one I've been wanting to see for a long time as it digs into his past as a former MI6 agent.

I could go on and on but I think I'll just leave it here by saying this is a very worthy series for any Batman fan to have in their collection.

This DVD set contains the first 13 episodes of the series.",1504828800,3,949,4.232044198895028
