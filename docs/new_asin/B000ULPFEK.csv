2922387,5,B000ULPFEK,"Hi, everyone. This is Wes, and this is my movie. This was a little film I made as a thesis over at LAFS a few years back. It's rough around the edges, but I still love it, but of course I'm a bit biased. I hope you have as much fun watching it as we did making it.",1314230400,,264,3.5689655172413794
2922388,2,B000ULPFEK,"Seemingly never-ending, thin storyline with superstar cast that barely holds it together.  A waste of the mega talenta of Ian Richardson and the lovely Francesca Annis.  Put this one down as a travelogue of eastern Europe and you may see it through.",1275177600,,249,4.904761904761905
2922389,5,B000ULPFEK,"The Gravy Train is a fantastic example of the late Malcom Bradbury at his very best. Ian Richardson is perfectly cast as the devious Spearpoint and delivers many of the best lines with withering, dry humour. There is no doubt that this role led to him being cast in the equally devious lead role in House of Cards.

I think it's fair to say that the humour is decidely British and satirical, so if you're not into that, this isn't for you. But if you are, you can't go wrong with The Gravy Train.

Malcom Bradbury was a prolific author of comic novels and was recognised as one of Britain's best screenwriters, yet still found time to lecture in American Studies at the University of East Anglia.",1240531200,8,696,4.47244094488189
2922390,4,B000ULPFEK,"If you enjoyed House of Cards, you will enjoy this. Ian Richardson is the perfect scheming villain.",1193702400,8,99,4.882352941176471
2922391,3,B000ULPFEK,"This is an interesting 1990 television mystery that amounts, actually, to a chase film through some of Europe's most beautiful areas.  The plot involves a young EEC bureaucrat who finds himself surrounded by crooks who are trying to pin crimes on him.  Wherever he goes, a sort of guardian angel, with whom he sleeps, keeps arriving on the scene to assist him.  We never do find out who she is or who she works for.  Lots of chase, little action, and almost no humor (despite this being listed as a comedy).  The acting is superb, and the director is above average.  In short, this is good fun, but don't expect laughs or any depth of story.  This package includes the sequel, The Gravy Train Goes East, shown on British television the following year.",1191110400,12,751,4.601503759398496
8213734,2,B000ULPFEK,"An acquired taste. The original series is &  is a little brutal yet quite amusing. Very enjoyable. The Gravy Train Goes East, in my opinion, is a little weaker. Still, I have watched them both & we shall watch them again & maybe once per year after that",1475193600,,253,4.270833333333333
8213735,5,B000ULPFEK,So happy to find this!  Very funny in a light-hearted yet smart way.,1456617600,,68,4.230769230769231
8213736,2,B000ULPFEK,"Dvd's were damaged, a lot of scenes were skipped over.",1424217600,,54,4.5
8213737,5,B000ULPFEK,"We're watching this for the second time.  Brilliance in the writing, wit, outstandingly tapestried story line that is undoubtedly a dry satirical view of politics.  It is also terribly funny.  This was our introduction to Christophe Waltz who plays a character who is possibly intensely nave as well as rather dim.  He is so idealistic that he becomes somewhat of a pawn for all sides, unwilling to see corruption and fraud until it becomes so transparent that even an individual in denial could not miss it.  Waltz is brilliant in this, as is of course Richardson who never failed the viewer in his bright career.  Unlike American TV series, this one allows the intellect to expand and enjoy entertainment at its very best.  100%",1422316800,2,730,4.838709677419355
8213738,4,B000ULPFEK,Good humor; kind of disappointed in Ian Richardson's role; he's capable of so much more.,1418860800,,88,4.933333333333334
8213739,4,B000ULPFEK,"I love Ian Richardson, and I loved these two mini series when I watched them on TV. I hoped one day to find a subtitled DVD, and I bought this one only because I despaired. So - the missing star goes with the missing English subtitles.",1371427200,,235,4.130434782608695
8213740,5,B000ULPFEK,"Interestingly, this British series is not available in Region 2 format. And that may well be because the characterizations and story lines are brillant satire around the early days of the EEC and the bureaucrats within the EEC, especially British bureaucrats.

Ian Richardson was incredibly talented at his craft and in ""Gravy Train"" is hilarious with ease. It is his portrayal in ""Gravy Train"" vs. ""House of Cards"" which exemplifies the concept that there is no difference between drama and comedy. Not my idea - first heard this in the Special Features on the ""The Statement"" DVD said by the Director, Norman Jewison.

Christoph Waltz is the story catalyst stumbling brillantly around characters and story lines. If you liked him in ""Inglorious Basterds"" you will now appreciate this very talented actor even more and understand his earning the Oscar for ""D'Jango"".

The characters are not devious, just self-fulfilling and the epitomy of career bureaucrats with more than modest political ambitions.

For an analogy, ""Yes, Prime Minister"" shares similar satire. So, if you like ""Yes, Prime Minister"", I venture to suggest you will be hooked on ""Gravy Train"" - just as I am.",1368057600,,1176,5.109375
8213741,5,B000ULPFEK,"Surely there must be more of such material of what's happening behind the doors of  Bruxelles / Strasbourg etc to give us further episodes of ""Gravy Train"".  The acting skills of - alas deceased - Ian Richardson and of Christoph Waltz are simply superb. So is the acting of all other cast members, really. On the other hand however, the ""Gravy Train goes East"" was not quite as hilarious...a tad ""forced""...all in all though: Well worthwhile to look at, and to look at, and to look at again !!",1364083200,,493,4.52808988764045
8213742,5,B000ULPFEK,"This short is so much fun. I wish I had a partner like Biscuit with me at all times to keep my spirits up and to exact revenge for me :)
I'm hoping to see more from this filmmaker soon!",1314230400,,185,3.65
8213743,5,B000ULPFEK,"I happened to find this film, just searching through the short film section of Amazon Instant View downloads. The picture with the two clowns looked interested and I figured, for $3, why not? I spend more on feature films that I hate, why not give my hard earned $3 to someone's passion project? It's a sweet film, i won't give anything away since it's a short, but it's definitely worth it. Also, correct me if I am wrong, but isn't that the chick from that ABC Family show about the girls switched at birth? If not, she sure does look a lot like her. 5 stars.",1314230400,,561,4.30188679245283
