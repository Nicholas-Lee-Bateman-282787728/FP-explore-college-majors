8442897,1,B004V4RW0M,"I was intrigued with the idea of looking into some of the better known mysteries with modern techniques, but I was very disappointed. The episodes I viewed featured a single scientist pondering relics, forming opinions, then conferring with another expert who agreed. There was no debate, no exploring of other options, and innuendo paraded as facts. There were holes in the supporting evidence that I easily picked out.

I'm a little disturbed at what is passing as scientific or professional analysis these days. Definitely not what I would consider a keeper.",1344902400,2,561,5.164835164835165
