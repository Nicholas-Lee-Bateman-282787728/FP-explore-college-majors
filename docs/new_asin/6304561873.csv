904140,5,6304561873,"It's about time. After years of speculation, Fox finally brings home the best television show on the air on DVD. Apparently, just the beginning of what promises to be an excellent series of DVD's, the first box also includes the Tracey Ullman shorts that spawned the wonderful series. Hopefully as the series progresses, Fox and Groening will include commentaries and loads of extras, but as a starting point, it's just great to see them on disc...",994032000,,448,4.907894736842105
904141,5,6304561873,"Finally, a collection of uncut, amazing sound and picture clarity in a collectible format.  I have been waiting years for some sort of organized collection of Simpsons episodes, the video tapes lend nothing to the fan who wants to build a Simpsons library, and it being on DVD is the icing on the cake.  Buy this today, and if you've held out this long, here is reason enough to justify buying that shiny new DVD player.",993945600,,420,4.5131578947368425
904142,5,6304561873,"As more and more TV series start being released in complete DVD anthologies, I crossed my fingers, waited, and hoped that The Powers That Be would figure out what a great idea it would be to do the same thing for the Simpsons.

If you haven't ever seen the Simpsons, well I don't believe you.  Whether you are a fan or not you know who they are.  So I am basing this review on whether you are a Simpsons fan or not.  If you are not a fan would you buy this as the start of your Simpsons collection?  Probably not honestly.  The animation is not up to their current standard and the jokes aren't as memorable.
Now what if you are a fan?  Then this is a must buy if you don't own it already.  There are still a lot of classic moments.
Barts tattoo.  Homer taking on the nuclear power plant.  The electric therapy scene from the psychiatrist office visit.  The Simpsons buying a motor home.  Homer and the belly dancer.  And Krusty the clown being framed.

904751,5,6304561873,"I'm sure everyone born after 1970 has seen and enjoyed at least a few episodes of The Simpsons. Unlike The Flintstones or The Jetsons, The Simpsons is set in contemporary America, making it very easy for its viewers to relate to. Although the antics and adventures of the protagonists are often outlandish and require suspensions of incredulity, the down-to-earth and realistic nature of clever Lisa, naughty Bart, frustrated and hard-working Marge, loving but air-headed Homer and silent Maggie are what make the show shine. In fact, until the show started running out of ideas (which took over ten seasons, at least for me), they never got boring or stale. Even when the plots were weak, they still helped make the show entertaining, human, moving, empathetic and worth watching (at least for the first decade).

This first season begins with the clan of five (and their cat) learning the best meanings of Christmas. Of course, nothing goes right, especially when you put a ten-year-old boy in a choir with no prior training and coerce him into singing tedious and banal carols instead of letting him have fun and be a kid (Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire). Other gems that I particularly enjoyed were There's no Disgrace Like Home (a brilliant look at anger management, dysfunctional families and unrealistic expectations), Moaning Lisa (a profound and gritty look at childhood depression), and The Crepes of Wrath, a simultaneously humorous and horrifying look at multiculturalism, tolerance and child exploitation.",1464998400,,1521,5.182926829268292

The humor was great, the drawings were less refined, the situations were at times relatable, the family roles and unity were there, your average working slightly lower middle class :) family getting through the week.

I bought mine at walmart and it came in the new style packaging that they've been using since the 11th season, whitch kinda bums me out, because i liked the original packaging it was in, but thats not the main issue i have. The main issue i have is that mine did NOT come with a booklet. like it should. which really set me off since im schtikler for dvds and cds. I even bought season 2 at walmart and that one also didn't havea booklet. thats f*ckin bullshi*. when i buy something i want, i expect it to be fully intact with its original parts.

905465,5,6304561873,"DOH! Why didn't I order these years ago? But MMMmmmmmm... Simpsons BEST! I'm so glad to be watching them now that I have them. I watch one every day or two, and I've moved through four entire seasons and a smattering single episodes in some of the other seasons. I've seen the ones that once made me laugh till I fell off my chair. Now, my chair has arms, and it prevents me from falling out, but I'm still laughing all the way. This is the humor that changed animation and made us ask ""wow... can they do that on TV?""

I've read criticism of the boxes, the packaging, the disks, the inserts, the format, and the Simpsons in general, but when these arrived I realized that either those people got something else or they're probably annoyingly picky about trivial matters. I'm not here to buy the slickest DVD boxes, though these look like they'd be contenders for the title. I think the inserts are creative, fun, and informative, but again, I'm not here for those. I'm here for what's on these DVDs, and I couldn't be happier with what they've provided us. Commentary, deleted scenes, stills, advertising, and extras unique to each season, this set has everything I want, and probably a lot more features than I'll ever have time to watch (but I'm trying).

One packaging caveat: each box had a printed sheet attached to the back with those sticky-dots. I didn't like that they made the boxes feel cheap, so I carefully pulled them off and rolled off the sticky-dots. I folded the printed sheets and stored them inside with the other inserts within each season's box. What lay beneath those attached backs is FAR more attractive, and the boxes now feel worthy of displaying where visitors can pick them up and look.

I'm just a few years younger than Matt Groening, and I was a big fan of Life In Hell, his alternative weeklies strip long before the Simpsons ever aired. For many years I avoided The Simpsons, thinking it was a ""Flintstones"" version of Life in Hell. When I finally watched it, I was instantly hooked for life. Now I'm seeing all the shows that I missed. Not having a TV, I've seen almost all my Simpsons episodes on YouTube or iTunes, with a season or two that I saw with my kids back when we had a TV, before I said ""no more TV"" and kicked it out. That leaves a lot of these 9 seasons which are totally new to me. This is great!

The image is clear and the colors true. The format fills the height of my monitor, but of course is not as wide. I don't know the exact ratio of these, but it's the one that appears most natural on my Apple Cinema Display. Sound is true to the original. I'm not a DVD connoisseur, but I'm pretty critical of movies and content; these DVDs have made me happy every time I've watched. I'm so glad to finally have all these seasons!",1409356800,6,2778,4.409356725146199

It is great to see how raw and bold the creators were when the series premiered in 1989. As most know the set included the famous first Simpson's Christmas episode that once I saw it for the first time I felt that there was something really special about this family. I would have loved to have seen the original 48 one minute shorts from the TRACY ULLMAN SHOW where the Simpsons got there start included in this set but hopefully those will be released sometime in the future. I wouldn't mind seeing them in their own special set or as part of the ULLMAN show as a series issued on its own. We can only hope that whatever the reasons for these shorts not being released will be sorted out in the near future.

The new ones are made of a stronger plastic. It's still held in with glue, but it seems like a stronger glue as well, but that's just the base of the internal holder, the rest snap into place and turn like the pages of a book.",1397347200,,525,4.26

905652,5,6304561873,"The Simpsons.... This show can arguably be considered the best show ever on TV! Been around since 1989 and still going strong! Starting out as short clips on the Tracy Ullman Show, The Simpsons are now one of the most popular and recognizable shows throughout the world! And this is the season that started it all.

 This season contains 13 amazing and memorable episodes that won an Emmy award and had 4 additional nominations. Some of my personal favs that stick out is ""Bart the General"" where Bart is bullied at school every day and is tired of it and rallies other school kids that are bullied as well fight back with an army like strategy water balloon attacks. ""The Telltale Head"" Where Bart vandalizes a town statue by decapitating it and causing the town to form an angry mob as Bart and Homer try to figure out how to get out of that mess. Also who can forget the very first episode ""Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire"" the first Christmas with the Simpsons and all of the bonus money for X-mas is spent to remove a tattoo that Bart decided to get. Looking like there was not going to be a Christmas that year, instead they add a great addition to the Simpson family with Santa's Little Helper. This season is a great addition to any Simpson fan!

 Some of the special features include outtakes, early sketches and magazine covers. BBC Special: America's First Family, and Commentary on the episodes. The commentaries are great features for the hardcore fans and are a lot of fun to check out even if you're not a big fan. Overall this is a great season to get if you are deciding to just get one(or one for now.) This really won't matter if you decide to get them all like a hardcore fan(like myself, and proud of it!) I hope you enjoy the 1st of many seasons of The Simpsons!",1389225600,3,1786,4.435975609756097
905653,5,6304561873,"Disc one has six episodes: ""Simpsons Roasting On An Open Fire"", ""Bart The Genius"", ""Homer's Odyssey"", ""There's No Disgrace Like Home"", ""Bart The General"", and Moaning Lisa."" It extra features are scripts for ""Bart The Genius"", ""Bart The General"", and ""Moaning Lisa."" The scripts are half-page scans of the original documents, with their pen edits, and some doodles, which I suppose must be by Groening. No commentaries. ""Simpsons Roasting On An Open Fire"", the first episode of the series, has a weird Mr Burns (off-voice),

Disc two also has six episodes: ""The Call Of The Simpsons"", ""The Telltale Head"", ""Life On The Fast Lane"", ""Homer's Night Out"", ""The Crepes Of Wrath"", and ""Krusty Gets Busted"". No bonus features on this disc, and no commentaries either! ""The Crepes of Wrath"" is probably my favorite episode of this season, with Bart going to France on exchange and a young Albanian staying with the Simpsons. Of course, the Albanian kid is not the angel he seems, and Bart gets stuck in a slave labor situation. Hilarious!!

Disc three has one episode (""Some Enchanted Evening""), and several bonus features:
- Five minutes of ""Never Before Seen Outtakes"" from ""Some Enchanted Evening"" (can watch it with commentary from Matt Groening, James L Brooks, director David Sliverman and writer Al Jean) that are so-so interesting (a bit rough, not all that different from the final version). The commentators groan that it's off-model, and groan about nearly everything else, from how Marge gains and loses weight, a frog, everything's rubbery, the actions of the characters don't obey the laws of physics, Homer is fretful, smug, Marge gets slammed behind door, not tele-synced yet, less edited, big phone, glasses without pupils, Marge's mirror not matching. Commentaries nothing special, just lots of audio-wincing...
- a 1:50 animatic of ""Bart The General"", with James L Brooks and Matt Groening commenting. It's an interesting thing to watch to understand how these things are put together.
- a five-minute documentary on ""The Making of the Simpsons"", starting with Matt Groening and his Life In Hell story, and Groening's first meeting with James L Brooks. Groening was going to do Life In Hell characters, but wanted to protect them in case the show didn't work out, so he took five minutes to invent a family based on his own - father is Homer, mother is Margaret (Marge), sisters are Lisa and Maggie. ""Matt"" would have been too obvious, so he changes the spelling to ""Bart"". The studio spent $10 million for 13 episodes. Prime time animation had been dead since the Flintstones, so it was a great leap for Fox. Chris Solomon, animation critic from LA Times, gives comment. Groups appropriated Bart Simpson - black Bart, Irish Bart, Mexican Bart, vegetarian Bart, pro-Gulf War Bart, anti-Gulf War Bart, etc.
- Foreign language clips - compare the same one-minute clip of Bart and Lisa preparing a wedding anniversary breakfast for their parents in French, Italian, Spanish, Japanese and Portuguese! Weird to hear how Homer and Bart sound in those languages
- Tracy Ullman shorts of ""Good NIght Simpsons"" (four parts)
- Albert Brooks' Audio Outtakes from ""Life On The Fast Lane"", 3:43, not so funny
- Art of the Simpsons, including Matt Groening's Life In Hell ""The Los Angeles Way of Death"" that originally caught Brooks' eye, and Simpsons' early sketches and drawings (35 items), including ""surrealistic face making"" opening sequence concept, attempts to get Martin Prince right (with Groening's approval signature to the one we know and love), versions of Principal Skinner, Matt's original Ms Krabappel (very different), classroom design, story boards, Marge's mom, and other sketches from 1987 to 1988.

The stories had more plot rather than just randomness. While Season 3 and 2 are my favorites, Season 1 is still in my top 5 and far better than anything today.

I would have thought I could remove the cardboard shells and just keep the inner container seperately, but the trifold does not stay closed without its outer packaging.  That kind of bothers me.  They are really nice-looking and solid glossy cardboard, and all the disks are new and intact.  I have watched a bunch already, not all, and I am really really happy with it!  I really couldn't find it cheaper buying them individually.  I was afraid I would be unfamiliar with the older episodes, but I have not watched a single one that I did not see in my childhood.

Season 11 was going the wrong direction and disappointed me so much that it was depressing and I stopped watching the show. I'm a fan of the earliest episodes starting from the Tracy Ullman Shorts. After re watching some of the early episodes it reminded me of how great the show was in it's early days. The show just started with the full-length episodes in 89/90 and it had a lot of potential and they put a lot of life into it. There's more depth to stories and they had a darker edge with more serious parts. Episodes like ""Moaning Lisa"", ""Homer's Odyssey"", ""The Tell-Tale Head"" and ""Life On the Fast Lane"" had different problems/situations going on with different characters while still having enough good and intelligent humor throughout. It didn't get much better than this except Season 2 and maybe 3. So many classic episodes throughout and I'd highly recommend it.",1353369600,,997,4.8023255813953485

Bart is the same trouble maker he always is and Lisa is still as smart as ever and shines in one of my favorite episodes: 'Moaning Lisa'.

Groening and Co., were still finding their voice and were still trying to decide what boundaries it was alright to push and when. Now, of course, we know that the boundaries are few and the satirical component of the show has only increased.

906216,5,6304561873,"The first season of The Simpsons was groundbreaking, honestly changing the landscape of television. An animated show with adult-level satirical commentary while still remaining humorous was something that tv had never seen before. People couldn't get enough of it, and The Simpsons became a craze. Bart Simpson was an instant cultural icon. All of this wild popularity was well deserved as the show was well-written and went places that other shows were too afraid to touch. Even when the show was pushing boundaries, it was always smart and funny. It didn't push the envelope with trash; it pushed it with brains.

These episodes did have some rough animation. The show really didn't finish the major revisions to its style until the end of the 2nd season. The background layouts were often very simple without much detail, and the actual movement was often awkward an off model. It didn't matter at the time because the content was so fresh and original.

No doubt that these shows deserve a 5-star rating, but I still feel they are not as good as what came in season 3-6. Season 1 episodes are often a little depressing in retrospect. Lisa feeling blue, Homer blowing Christmas, Homer getting fired, Marge contemplating an affair--these shows are big time downers compared to later episodes that still dealt with serious issues without being depressing (Homer's mother returning, Bleeding Gums Murphy Dying, Milhouse's parents getting divorced). The amount of jokes per minute is also a little lean in season one compared to the pace of later seasons. To me episodes 3-6 outshine 1-2 in quality. Seasons 1-2 are both great; I'm just saying I enjoy watching 3-6 much more.",1281139200,,1674,4.996415770609319

A fascinating look at early animation for the simpsons. Remember, the Simpsons have been on TV for more than 20 seasons, so this was at the latest early 1990. The incredible leap in technology is apparent when you switch to watching even Season 10. The brilliance of the humor is still there even from the beginning. Quite likely the best part of this set is the special features. They walk through the introduction of the comic, from Sunday paper cartoons, to the first shorts on TV.

Down here in Australia, the channel in charge of broadcasting The Simpsons continually sees fit to shuffle the show around (sometimes taking it off for months at a time and even skipping episodes altogether) depending on what highly disposable reality show the populace is hooked on so catching a season in its entirety is near-impossible. And I don't know what it's like elsewhere in the world, but the irresponsible programmers in this country butcher the episodes (old and brand new ones alike) to make room for ""advertising"" that invariably results in the closing credit sequences (which often feature a song or more action) being drowned out by a heads-up for whatever inferior garbage they'll be screening next.

The drawings of the characters are naturally raw as they are not the finished product that we have become used to over the years but this is alright given the quality of the gags and the great story-telling.  These episodes though have been transferred from a poor videotape master as we frequently get the shimmering, crooked lines that you get on a bad video when the tape sticks to the playing magnetic head of the player and this is very evident in every episode which took away a great deal from my overall enjoyment of the dvds.  I don't remember seeing these when they were screened on tv and so it's unfortunate that for a ""Collector's Edition"" that we should get such poor dvd picture quality transfer although I have to say the sound quality on Dolby 5.1 surround is pretty good.

Overall, great episodes, sound quality but poor picture quality transfer from what appears to be a videotape with all its inherent limitations.",1256256000,2,1139,4.651741293532338
906283,5,6304561873,"Here's a flashback worth reliving! I, like many of my early Gen Y counterparts, had the privilege of being exposed to the very first episodes of The Simpsons as a child and was able to matured as the series developed.
Looking back at these episodes at 25 years of age really reveals the depth of writing and quality of smooth and fluid hand-drawn animation that went over my head at that young age.
This season is the closest to really reflecting Matt Groening's counter cultural angst as depicted in his earlier comic strip, Life In Hell. The Simpsons are a symbol of complicated familial dysfunction and much of the show's focus is on the anarchistic Bart before the writers realised that the success of the show relied on dumbing down Homer.
At this point of television history, the series appropriated SOME of the moralistic elements of family sitcoms like Family Ties, so there is a moment of pathos in each episode where each character comes together and show that deep down they all love each other... and it is moving without losing its nineties edge. There's No Disgrace Like Home and Moaning Lisa are two standout episodes that mix lots of visual laughs with very complicated family issues.
In terms of pure comedy - the season finale, Some Enchanted Evening, is definitely the strongest and my favourite laugh out loud episode from this year - with The Call of The Simpsons following a close second.
An issue I would have with this season is that the episodes here are so iconic that they outweigh my ability to laugh during the episodes - it's like watching Psycho and not finding it scary because it wrote all the rules for slasher films that have been used to death, but still finding it really entertaining.
This is particularly true of The Telltale Head, Bart the General and Bart the Genius where you can observe a prototype for what the tone and style and characters and structure of the series would take and improve on in later seasons as it shifted its focus from appealing to children and parents to attracting the college crowd.
The special features on the DVDs are amazing and it is really impressive to see the hard work and lengths the crew had gone to in order to satisfy the fans with goodies. I can't give this anything other than five stars.",1245110400,,2271,4.651741293532338

906388,5,6304561873,"Ok, so this isn't actually where the Simpsons had their beginning. Anyone who really knows about them will know that they were first introduced to America on the Tracy Ulman show. They were so successful however, that they soon had their own cartoon.
  For the record I'll say that I never saw the Tracy Ulman shorts. But I was there from the very first season to now, and while I'll freely admit that much of the clasic humor is gone from the series I still very much enjoy watching it. That said I will probably collect Simpsons seasons until they're no longer produced.
  The first season, though the quality isn't nearly as good as in later seasons, still has some classic gems. The very first episode that I remember watching with my family was Bart the General, where Bart leads a group of downtrodden kids in a war against local bully Nelson Munts. Other notables include Moaning Lisa, which saw the first appearance of Bleeding Gums Murphy, Bart the Genius, wherein Bart fakes his way through an aptitude test and finds himself in the gifted class, and of course Call of the Simpsons, which is probably one of my favorite episodes of this season. And of course we must not forget Babysitter Bandit, Crepes of Wrath (Bart's infamous trip to France), and Krusty gets Busted, first appearance of Sideshow Bob.
  All in all this is an excellent season despite its shortcomings. It wasn't the first season I saw on DVD but it was the first one I ever bought. And I'll probably continue to buy each season as it becomes available.",1223337600,,1532,4.634686346863469
906389,5,6304561873,"I start my review this way because The Simpsons is approching Season 20 as I write this review. And only in the last several years has the show started to show serious signs of age! I am 28 now and this is a Simpson season I fondly remember one of my fathers' co-workers dubbing off of cable for us because we didn't have it;it was on right before ""Married With Children"" at the time if I recall. I cannot watch this season without images of ""Don't Have A Cow Man"" T-Shirts and even McDonalds offering a line of Simpson dolls;for a time they were as big a marketing item as The Beatles were in the 60's. It's funny how irreverant,witty,anti-authoritarian figures such as The Beatles and The Simpsons could have any capitalist angles but they did. But these 13 shows have a lot of special meaning to me. In this season Bart cheats on a test and ends up branded a genious,Marge has a near affair with a hursuit bowling teacher,Lisa jams her blues away with local jazzman Bleeding Gums Murphy (am I the only Simpson fan out there who liked this character?) and the entire family give each other electroshock treatment. Of course being when this is this season sometimes seems like the Bart Simpson show;Bart goes to France,Bart fights a bully,Bart outsmarts the babysitter bandit,Bart reveals Sideshow Bob had framed Krusty The Clown,etc. But before Homer became the breakout character Bart was the star vehicle. But that doesn't matter. Neither does the difference in the animation;the main characters have very rubbery movements,a lot of the backround characters are either horrible mutants or just look like blobs with faces in the crowd scenes. Not only that but Bart isn't as full of clever quips as he would be later,Homer talks more like Walter Matheau then he would later on and Ned Flanders hasn't yet become a religious fanatic;he was just the Simpsons yuppie neighbor at this point. But as a later Simpsons episode pointed out sometimes TV show change after a pilot or first season;some characters are baught upfront or pushed into the backround and sometimes you can change them almost entirely. Interestingly enough this would be the last of The Simpsons I'd see for another five years;I caught seasons 2 and on through network syndication. I have since diligantly purchased the DVD sets and will continue to do so but still this stands out as really one of my favorite Simpson seasons.",1222128000,,2396,4.7898550724637685

In my opinion, the show really picked up steam in its second season, but there are certainly plenty of laughs in the premier season as well.  Aside from being an incisive satire of modern America life and pop culture, it also succeeds in walking a very fine line: however irrationally and selfishly the characters may behave toward each other, their mutual affection wins out in the end, giving the show some genuine sweetness as well as a sharp bite.",1218844800,,654,4.830357142857143

If you're anything like me, then you already own this boxed set, and you're probably just reading this to see why anyone would give your favorite show anything less than five stars.  If you're not like me, if you're a casual fan or someone wondering what this boxed set has to offer, then I'll be clear.

The first season of this groundbreaking show contains many memorable Simpsons' moments.  The adoption of Santa's Little Helper.  The family doses each other with electro-shock therapy.  Homer is mistaken for Bigfoot.  Sideshow Bob frames Krusty the Clown.  And Bart makes Nelson bleed his own blood (a hilarious line that would later be stolen by a film called&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dodgeball/dp/B0006419IM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dodgeball</a>).  It's a funny show; it's a funny season.

This set, though, gives understandably short shrift, especially in light of the bells and whistles that the later sets ended up with.  Matt Groening provides some curious insights with commentary on every track, there are a few audio outtakes and scripts you can glance at, and there's even an easter egg that plays an old ABC news item about Bart's unhealthy influence on the dress codes of impressionable young school kids.  (Even more amusing, considering where the show went from there.)

However, these DVDs were mastered from broadcast tape, and (of course) the show was still finding its legs in this first year, so the video and audio lack quality, the animation itself is sloppy and weird, the menus are lacking, and even the episodes themselves have that weird unformed quality of a show that's not sure just how much it wants its edge to cut.  Considering that this set was made back at the turn of the century, these little niggles are understandable, but niggles nonetheless.  The set'll still cost you $27.  For a hardcore Homer lover like myself, that's a piddling price to pay.

That episode also introduced the first of the ""Itchy and Scratchy"" episodes, which some viewers apparently found so offensive.

The Simpsons have been satire at its best, poking fun not only at television shows but the way we look at television.  There are no end to the allusions from one episode to the next, but what I love about it is that there is no hammer over the head, telling you what they refer to.  You have to figure it out for yourself.  The show really took situation comedy to new highs, or new lows depending on how you look at it, but it never lost its sense of humor, and that is saying a lot for a show that is now in its 18th season.",1167350400,12,1356,4.435483870967742

After getting enough attention on the Tracy Ullman show with their 2-minute episodes, FOX saw the talent and signed Matt Groening and co. to make an entire season.. Were they going to make it? Or were they going to just be forgotten and end up like every WB show? Well, we all know the answer to that, since they're still around and are still one of the most popular TV shows out there, but let's not think about that right now... let's just focus on the start of America's most beloved politically incorrect family.

Compared to later seasons, this may not get as big of a laugh out of you, but it's still cool seeing what The Simpsons were like back when they started. Episodes like Krusty Gets Busted, Simpsons Roasting On An Open Fire, Bart The Genius, The Crepes Or Wrath, The Call Of The Simpsons, Some Enchanted Evening, and Homer's Night Out are some of my all-time favorite Simpsons episodes, and probably some of the best they've made. Sure, the drawings are a little crude (nowhere near as bad as the drawings when they were on the Tracy Ullman Show), but hey, they were just getting started, and the crude drawings don't make the season unwatchable. I mean, come on, IT'S THE SIMPSONS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

There are some great features on the season - most of which can be found on the later season DVDs too, but the one feature the other DVDs don't have is that you can watch some of the sketches they did on the Tracy Ullman show - I believe that's another reason why you should buy this. So if you're a simpsons fan, your collection isn't complete until you've bought this one!

Not much really needs to be said about the Simpsons, as it's one of the biggest pop culture icons ever. However, you can really tell from these episodes that the series was rough around the edges when it started. Character designs are unrefined, and the animation is crude and rubbery. The stories feel like typical sitcom plots with a little Simpsons edginess and zany humour tossed in, but not nearly enough of it. The voice-actors were also still getting into character here, so their performances are also different from what they later matured into.

Luckily, Fox loaded the first season with dvd goodies, including commentaries on every episode and some other fun retrospective material. Presentation is really nice too with some original packaging and disc artwork. I'd say the episodes themselves are three stars, but the superb box set treatment bumps the overall score up to four.

The 13 episodes contain simple plots that are generally revolving around one story (in comparison to later seasons). The picture is relatively sharp (although close inspection will throw up some surprises) and the sound could be better but that's just the master tapes showing their age.

Audio commentaries are included on all episodes with Matt Groening and James L. Brooks sitting in on nearly all of them. They are a neat touch and are well worth checking out.

A variety of extra features seem to be sadly lacking however. The four minute 'featurette' is in reality a four minute slice of a half hour BBC documentry. The inclusion of a number of scripts sounds like a great idea but trying to read through them on a TV screen is a different story.

One feature of note is the deleted scenes from 'Some Enchanted Evening'. I recommend viewing this out if you ever thought the broadcast animation was sketchy.

Overall, The Simpsons: The Complete First Season really isn't good at ALL compared to the current ones available. ( 1,2,3,4,5,6,7, and soon 8. ) There are some memorable episodes in here like Krusty Gets Busted and Some Enchanted Evening, but for the most part, most of the episodes are os-os. That's backwards for ""so-so"". The animation is crude, the laughs are sparce, but it doesn't matter. The Simpsons hasn't really been known about laughter, but great stories. And really, any season you buy that is what you will find. Some laughs but not many, and excellent stories written by brilliant writers. ( John Schwartzwelder, Conan O'Brien... ) Sit back and enjoy The Simpsons: The Complete First Season.

It includes the oldest Simpsons Episodes to date. The drawings are bad, but are still good. Many voices (espically Homer voiced by Dan Castellantea) sound different. The Special features are also intresting. With interviews with the creator, Matt Groening, short Simpsons cartoons from The Tracey Ullman Show and many more to see.

The first of many great Simpsons Seasons. Well done Matt Groening.

906751,3,6304561873,"I love the Simpsons probably less so than most people, but I love them all the same.  My primary interest wherein it concerns the Simpsons is the number of take-offs and allusions they make to many many different works through art, history, and pop culture.

Of course I can't really expect the same level of focus on the earlier episodes, which is why predominant in this set is the sort of attention one feels towards the development and evolution of the characters.  Minor changes in coloring, voice-acting, and character development create add up slowly to create a different feeling Springfield than we're all used to.

This is not a bad thing.  These episodes are still funny and still interesting to watch, and in fact they seem less old than the date gives them.  However, while the overall clunkiness can be forgiven, it's still clunky.

I like this set because it's interesting to watch and it still holds a lot of humor, but I can't honestly hold it as close to my heart as later seasons.  For the huge Simpsons lover out there, this set is a must.  For those less-so attached to America's Favorite Dysfunctional Family, you'll probably find yourself watching this set less than the others.

After all, how can you not like such unforgettable characters such as Mr. Burns, Principle Skinner, Otto, Willie, Moe, and (of course) Homer? In the face of such blatant ripoffs as Family Guy and South Park, the Simpsons keeps going strong.

I feel that this is the best Simpsons material. Bart the General, a favorite episode of mine, is a hilarious story about Bart taking on the local bully with the help of his grandpa and the guy who owns the army supply store who is (of course) out of his mind. The result is such dialouge as, ""Do you have the water balloons?"" ""Right here. Is it OK if they have 'Happy Birthday' written on the sides?"" ""Well I'd perfer if they said, 'Death from above,' but we'll make do with what we have."" It cleverly satirizes war. Another highlight is Bart the Genius, where Bart (Who is an idiot) gets into a high-profile private school due to switching tests with Martin Prince, the school genius. It ends up pretty funny.

Though the Simpsons have evolved over the years, incorporating the side-splitting Treehouse of Horrors, an episdoe that slyly parodies the Beatles story, the inclusion of the Simpsons' fundamentalist-Christian neighbors, the Flanders (their portrayal, by the way, isn't really that far away from some fundamentalists I know), and the inclusion of creator Matt Groening himself.

You will find a Simpsons different than what you see today (or even Seasons 3-9).  You'll see a charm there that's been lost.

If you're money's there and you're a fan, get this.  But if you're money is limited or you're a casual fan, then there's better Simpsons sets to get out there (Namely Seasons 3 through 9).

My disappointments that net it 4 stars are content-related.  While there are some classics here, there are some huge clunkers - the show didn't really hit its stride until Season 3.

Then the hugest glaring omission is the neglect of not including ""Season 0"", the two and a half years of shorts that appeared on the Tracey Ullman show.  There are 48 of these shorts which aired from 04/19/1987 to 05/14/1989, and they only give us the ""pilot"" (Source is [...]  BIG glaring omission - buyers of this set miss a lot on the evolution of the Simpsons from the included short to what we see in Episode 1 of this series.

Then, the menus are a bit annoying, where you have to navigate all of them to see all the episodes.  Thankfully this annoyance was removed in later sets, but it is still an annoyance for this time.

And then of course, there's the 6-6-1 layout of this set for shows.  With season six, they proved that they could put seven shows per disk (Admittedly, I do not know the technical limitations they were under back then).  But loading a disk to see a single show is definitely annoying after repeated viewings - the costs could have definitely been lowered by making this a 2 disk set.

While this would have been a 4.5 star thing when it came out (and when I bought it), time has not been kind to this set after repeated viewings and seeing what they did with the newer sets.",1128643200,3,1817,4.350148367952523

Before the days of Beavis & Butt-head,King Of The Hill, and South Park, The Simpsons was a landmark show as an animated show not geared to the Saturday morning set. It's colorful characters, and satirical take on modern day life would evolve in the later seasons.

 Aside from the classic episodes (No Disgrace Like Home,Crapes of Wrath,The Call Of The Simpsons),the show's biggest focus was the original Ridilan kid Bart, who was on T-shirts and other kitchsy items.

However, there were a few people who'd see short cartoons involving a family called the Simpsons on the Tracey Ulman Show.  The characters were wacky, dysfunctional, and yellow.  And they were pretty funny.  So FOX decided to give Groening his own half-hour show starring the family from Springfield, USA, and the rest is history.

The show recently ended its 16th (!) season, and will begin its 17th year in a few months.  This is more than a show, it is a cultural phenomenon.  No other show is as big a part of American culture as The Simpsons.  Now, Matt Groening is almost a household name, and if he isn't, Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie are.  Their catchphrases, like ""D'oh!"", ""Eat my shorts"", and Marge's trademark grumble are known across the country; some people even use them in everyday speech (d'oh is one of my favorites).  In later seasons, the main five are strengthened by a huge group of secondary characters, each with their own unique character traits, and sometimes, even a hilarious voice (like Prof. Frink).

This year was a tad shaky, though.  It was definitely funny, but nowhere near as hilarious as it would come to be in future seasons.  The episodes this year didn't have the social commentary that they would come to have in later seasons, and that very commentary is what most of the jokes were based around.  This year was pretty much all about making us laugh at about anything.  My favorite episodes from this year were ""Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire"", ""Bart the General"", ""The Crepes of Wrath"", ""Krusty Gets Busted"", ""Homer's Odyssey"", and ""The Call of the Simpsons"".

This season will probably slightly confuse people who've grown up on the later episodes.  Homer's voice is a little different, Mr. Burns (another great character) has a smaller office than normal, and a lot of the supporting characters have certain things that may seem a bit off.  For example, Burns' assistant Smithers is black in one episode, Chief Wiggum and Moe have black hair instead of their usual blue and gray, respectively, and Sideshow Bob is still on the Krusty the Clown show, as opposed to Sideshow Mel (although, that gets explained).  Also, this year is centered around Bart.  Most of the main plots revolve around him with his family as the supporting players.  In a few years, the focus would (rightly) shift to Homer.

Anyway, this set is a great way to relive the beginnings of a great show.  If you are a Simpsons fan, you should definitely get this.  If you aren't a Simpsons fan, check this out!",1124236800,,2734,4.768085106382979
906822,5,6304561873,"When watching these 13 episodes from the inaugural season of the Simpsons, it's amazing to see how far the long running show has come.  Created by Matt Groening and originally a short appearing on the Tracy Ulman Show, the Simpsons introduces us to a family of five in the town of Springfield (which state it is in is purposely kept annonymous).  Oafish father Homer works in the local power plant, his nagging wife Marge has a ridiculous hair-do, and their children are baby Maggie, genius Lisa, and of course, trouble making Bart.  While the crude animation and some of the ""lesson-learned"" storylines aren't as sophisticated as what would come in future seasons, there's still plenty of gold here: the family adopts beloved dog Santa's Little Helper, the family go to shock therapy, Bart saws the statue head off of town founder Jebediah Springfield, and Bart's TV hero Krusty the Klown gets imprisoned which leads Bart to his first altercation with wicked Side-Show Bob (voiced by Kelsey Grammer).  While these first episodes aren't the best of the series, this Season 1 collection is still a must have for Simpsons fans, and new fans to the series can go back to see it's humble roots.",1124150400,,1190,4.847290640394089

906824,3,6304561873,"..........and I'll tell you why.  It's just not that good.  the animation is horrible.  the jokes are not funny.  Homre sounds soooo wooden and stiff.  Yeah, it did set the premise for the following sseasons, and for that it deserves some credit.  However, this seems to me like it was something that was only funny aat the time it first aired.  I remeber watching it as a kid and thinking it was hilarious.  At the time it was.  It was an animated show that was directed at a broad spectrum of audience members.  For it's time, it was ground breaking.  It was something not done on primetime tv, andd it survived  and survuved quite well with a ton of merchandiseing later that year.  But to the standards of today, and to the standards of today's episodes of the Simpsons, it just doesn't hold water.  It's time has past, and, thankfully, the quality of the shows have increased by an astounding percent.  At the time this review was written, it was being sold at the price of around 22 dollars.  I personally, would wait for that price to dorp a bit before purchasing.  This my be herrasy for a simpsons fan to say, but the first season, in my opinion, just isn't worth it.",1123718400,4,1176,4.446009389671362
906975,5,6304561873,"All I can say is this is a must have for any Simpsons fan.  I especially enjoy seeing the changes in the way the show has taken shape from then until now, including better artwork in the show and the myriad of special guests and guest voices.  It's just great to see such an awesome show in it's infancy like this!",1120262400,,314,4.131147540983607
906976,5,6304561873,"If you're fairly new to The Simpsons, Season 1 will come as a shock.

Where's the smooth, colorful animation? Where's all my beloved minor characters like Professor Frink? Why is Homer so serious? And why is he talking like Walter Mattheau? And where's the funny jokes????

So yes, in terms of comedic value, Season 1 is not nearly as funny as later seasons. Yes, the animation is crude. Yes, Homer is completely different (Bart was really the show's ""star"" back then). Yes, Smithers is black.

But the writing is strong, even though a few of the shows haven't aged well. ""Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire"" (first episode aired) is a great Christmas show, and explains the origin of Santa's Little Helper. The writing is excellent; beginning to end. None of the episodes rely on zany cop-outs to escape plot holes (like a few recent Simpsons shows).

""There's No Disgrace Like Home"" also features a classic scene at the end (shock therapy). There's also a weird scene, in which Marge and the kids make fools of themselves at Mr. Burns' company picnic, and Homer, of all people, is the embarassed normal one. Yet, his idiocy shows in other episodes like ""Life on the Fast Lane"" (in which he buys Marge a bowling ball for her birthday) and others.

Lisa also develops some complexity in an episode of her own, ""Moaning Lisa""; it feels shockingly serious compared to The Simpsons of present. Similiarly, Homer battles a bout of deep depression in ""Homer's Odyssey"", after Bart accidently gets him fired.

Other classics include ""The Telltale Head"" (a fantastic Bart story), ""Krusty Gets Busted"" (which showcases Homer's cowardice), and ""Bart the Genius"" (another great Bart story).

The coup de grace of the extra features is the cast commentary on all 13 episodes. They often point out cool, behind-the-scenes like facts, and hilariously rip on a lot of stuff. The background characters (used to fill scenes with crowds, etc) are so freakishly ugly at times that it's unintentional comedy at its best.

Thus, in conclusion, this is a must have set..even though you won't be laughing at Homer's zany antics as much as you do now. The stories were very well written; they're not deeply satirical like they are now. Instead, they focus more on the characters themselves. Rarely, nowadays, do you see Bart's emotions like in ""The Telltale Head"" and ""The Crepes of Wrath""; It was a much different show back then, for better or worse. But if you're gonna collect the DVD sets, it would be criminal to not get Season 1.",1118448000,6,2511,4.823255813953488
906977,5,6304561873,"In 1989, not a single person on earth suspected that the face of television, a bland medium that existed primarily to sell hideous products, was about to be changed forever. Matt Groening, the creator of the brilliant comic strip, ""Life in Hell"", with the help of James L. Brooks and Sam Simon, created an animated television show that was so funny, true-to-life, and bitingly satirical, as well as so littered with detail it became a masterpiece and a true work of art. Every single animated show since its first airing has been inspired by it, and indeed, popular culture was altered to make way for it. In the 13 episodes of the first season of ""The Simpsons"", we see a masterwork being formed. The season began with the Christmas episode, ""Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire"", and gave us such classics as ""Bart the General"", ""Moaning Lisa"", ""Krusty Gets Busted"", and the beautiful ""Life on the Fast Lane"". These words just don't do the show justice. It is incredibly hilarious and sometimes heart-wrenchingly sad. Although the first season is only an omen of great things to come, it must be purchased by every single human being on this planet. Do yourself a favor and do just that. You won't be disappointed.",1118448000,2,1214,4.758293838862559
906978,5,6304561873,"Cartoonist Matt Groening who did the Life is Hell comics decided to make a show which started as 1 minute shorts on the Tracey Ullman Show. There Fox expanded the shorts into actual episodes making the Simpsons a spin-off of sorts. And here we have Season 1's first 13 episodes that while not greatly animated(it was their first season after all) it still started a great show and even a phenomenon.

The season starts with the holiday episode Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire, which finds Homer without a christmas bonus and Marge having to spend all their money on removing Bart's tattoo which he thought would be cool. In the end, they adopt Santa's Little Helper, a racehound dog.

In Homer's Odyssey, Homer gets fired and he ends up becoming a big safety guy and gets re-hired at the plant as a safety technician. In the Call of the Simpsons, Homer buys a cheap RV and the family get stranded in the woods with Homer being an unlikely Bigfoot sighting.

Life on the Fast Lane as Marge getting a bit too close to her bowling instructor, who utters the famous(maybe) line about brunch(""you don't completely get what you get at breakfast but you get a good meal!""). The Crepes of Wrath has Bart becoming part of a foreign exchange student to France while an Albanian spy is sent to live with the Simpsons.

Krusty Gets Busted is exactly that and Bart and Lisa try to find ways to clear his name. Probably the first real introduction of the ever-popular Sideshow Bob. The finale Some Enchanted Evening as Homer and Marge getting a babysitter only it's a notorious Babysitter Bandit. This was actually the first to be made but had to be re-sent to Korea(where they finish up the animation) so it became the finale.

It's funny looking at this set as it's probably one of the only seasons of the show that you can rightly say it's the first season. Half the time with reruns I can't tell what season it is but still it's a very good start to what would become a 16 season series.",1116201600,,1979,4.516759776536313
906979,5,6304561873,"The Simpsons needs absolutely no introduction, and after 16 years on the air, it's pretty hard to talk about it in a review without heaping on the superlatives. Everybody in the world knows what The Simpsons is, and just how it has defined popular culture since its debut. Most critics agree that this is, by a large margin, the greatest TV series ever created. I'm not sure if I quite agree with this, but over time this may be the case. You have to understand that, even though I have been familiar with the show for as long as I can remember, it is only recently that I have taken a serious interest in it, which has culminated in the purhcase of The Complete First Season of The Simpsons on DVD.

The Simpsons is great for a number of reasons. One of these is that it works on so many levels. The dumbest person in your family can appreciate it for its humour in the literal sense, but also the most intelligent person in your family can appreciate it for the use of irony, satire and various other comedic devices that make it such an intelligent programme. Creator Matt Groening said that with the first season on The Simpsons, he had no idea what he was doing. This may have been the case, but he was definitely doing something right. This season contains only 13 episodes which the FOX  network commissioned with a budget of $10 million. This was a risk at the time back in late 1989, but it has since paid off; the profit FOX has made from this phenomenon is now estimated at inexcess of a cool $1 billion.

The first episode of Season 1 is ""Simpsons Roasting On An Open Fire,"" which is a brilliant introduction to the family at Christmas. Homer failure as a department store Santa Claus, Bart's costly tatoo removal and a bad day at the dog track leave the family disheartened. Things look up when Homer brings home Santa's Little Helper and the family realise the true meaning of Christmas. ""Bart The Genius"" sees Bart switching I.Q. exams with Marten Prince, which results in a placement at a school for geniuses. His conscience soon gets the better of him, though, and Bart confesses all. ""Homer's Odyssey"" is a great episode where Citizen Homer is fired from his job and is caught in a web of nuclear hazards and public safety campaigns. ""There's No Disgrace Like Home"" is a true classic which sees Homer attempt to fix the major problems within his family after the realisation that his family is the worst in town. A visit to Dr. Marvin Monroe's facility is the hilarious high point.

""Bart The General"" is an amazing episode which sees Bart form his own army to get back at Nelson, who beats him up after school for attempting to protect Lisa! In ""Moaning Lisa,"" we see Lisa slip into her childhood depression! How can she be happy with so much suffering in the world? She finds comfort in her saxaphone, and a chance encounter with bluesy be-bop 'Bleeding Gums' Murphy. In ""Call Of The Simpsons,"" the family take a trip into the woodland after Homer buys an RV in an attempt to compete with his annoying neighbour Ned Flanders. Of course, he crashes the RV over the edge of the cliff, which forces the family to survive in nature, amongst eagles, grizzly bears and Bigfoot! ""The Telltale Head"" sees Bart desperate to fit in with a bunch of rebellious teenagers that he is prepared to go to any lengths. This results in him cutting off the head of the local town's statue, Jebediah Springfield! ""Life On The Fast Lane"" is a great episode that sees Marge annoyed at Homer's lack of compassion towards her on her birthday. She turns to bowling in an attempt to try and make some use of the stupid bowling ball that Homer bought for her (or himself). She meets a man who tears her marriage apart - temporarily - before she is reunited with Homer.

""Homer's Night Out"" is a classic in which Homer is caught on camera with an exotic dancer doing a bellydancer. Marge is unfuriated and forces Homer to teach Bart a lesson about women and their role as strong individuals in contemporary society. ""The Crepes Of Wrath"" sees Bart's bad behaviour reach fever pitch. In an attempt to control this, Principal Skinner sends Bart to France in exchange for an Albanian student. Bart leanrs how much his family means to him after his Hellish time. ""Krusty Gets Busted"" is a brilliant episode which sees the funny clown framed for robbery. The final episode of the season is the hilarious ""Some Enchanted Evening,"" which sees Homer desperate to impress Marge after she is dissatisfied by his treatment of her. They go for a romantic meal and hire a babysitter for the children. Little do they know that their children are in the deadly hands of the notorious Babysitter Bandit!

This season sees the introduction of many well-loved characters, such as Marge's sisters, Patty and Selma, Ned Flanders and his diddly family, Montgomery Burns and his extremely heterosexual(!) sidekick Smithers, the legends that are Itchy and Scratchy, Grandpa Simpson, Reverend Lovejoy and his wife Helen, Krusty The Clown, Sideshow Bob and many others! This season also spawned many popular catchphrases such as ""Ay carumba!"" and the classic ""D'oh!""

The hilarity of The Simpsons lies in its genius to turn traditional, Middle American values and flip them on their head. It shows America as the country it really is, without any sense of guilt or remorse, and because of this we love it. It is a bold, original, honest show that is totally one of a kind. Nothing like this will ever exist again, and the syndication of the show will literally run for decades and decades. We see ourselves in these characters because we are familiar with their ways of thinking. The Simpsons is so embedded in our public consciousness that I don't even have to go into as much detail about the characters of the show, it's premise or its creation as I would with any other show. All you need to know is that this DVD is essential, but be warned, once you buy this you've got at least another 17 to buy!",1115078400,5,5969,4.6043233082706765

906981,5,6304561873,"Starting with the very first episode (airing December 17, 1989), The Simpsons DVD (Season 1) is packed with some of the best episodes in the show's history. All of these early episodes exhibit a bit of amateurish (by later Simpson standards) animation, seeing as how the popularity of the show had yet to land it the massive budgets of subsequent years. However, this does not take away from the show's acerbic wit which is present and in full swing throughout all thirteen of the original episodes.

A few details do stand out. Homer's voice is slightly different, and he isn't as stupid as his character is later portrayed to be. But all the other Simpson family members are firmly established from the get-go. These initial episode witness the appearance of such beloved supporting characters as Krusty the Clown, Ned Flanders, Itchy & Scratchy (although they're just cartoons!), Monty Burns & sidekick Wayland Smithers, Patty & Selma, Martin Prince, Grandpa Simpson, Reverend Lovejoy, and a host of other highly regarded inhabitants of Springfield who have climbed their way into the hearts of America since the show's debut.

As the longest running animated show in history, and the longest running prime show of any type, The Simpsons is an American treasure - a combination of humor, wit, and satire that examines not just the lives of its eccentric characters, but also the society, culture, and world in which we live. Fun for adults and children alike, The Simpsons is a cutting edge television comedy that, like Seinfeld, change the television landscape in the 1990's by dictating a new genre of TV fun - spawning network investment in new series such as King of the Hill, Futurama, and The Family Guy.

Like all new things which smash the paradigm of life, The Simpsons is unrivaled by its knockoffs, and the show doesn't show signs of slowing down. If you haven't yet visited Springfield, then I definitely recommend that you pick up The Simpsons (Season 1) DVD to catch a glimpse for yourself. You have no idea what you've been missing...

907115,4,6304561873,"Wow.  I didn't expect the reviews of Season 1 to be so overwhelmingly negative.

I've discovered something interesting.  ""The Simpsons"" is like politics.  Two people look at the very same thing, but come to incredibly different conclusions that seem to directly contradict each other.  I'm beginning to understand why Washington is so bitterly partisan. But I digress!

I'll come out and say it: I love these thirteen quirky little films.  I know many people have been denouncing them as unfunny, poorly animated, awkward-looking, and slowly-paced.  You can make a case for all these arguments---humor is always subjective---but it's important to view things in context.  The causually negative reviews seem like an odd case of amnesia.  As awful as you might think these are, just 15 short years ago they had critics and audiences alike rolling on the floor.  They were, to put it bluntly, groundbreakers.  Things have caught up, as they always do, and have made the innovators look old-fashioned.

People begin a television series knowing full well that if they get to make more seasons, the show will inevitably change.  Things develop, characters are fleshed out, awkward ideas are dropped, the internal logic works itself out.

 What if ""The Simpsons"" had been a ratings failure, loved by critics and audiences but cancelled after just one or two seasons?  This first season would be a cult classic today, and there would have been mounds of unfulfilled potential, something that pervades any first season of any show.  Homer can't go into space yet--we've got to get to know him first!

What one thinks of this first season (and what what thinks of the current seasons) depends on what they like about the show to begin with.  It seems that those who just love the comedy element, the razor-sharp timing, breakneck jokes and topical jabs, and goofy characters doing crazy things, are in love with the modern show and scratch their heads over this disk.  Others love the comedy too, but they also love the show as the story of these characters, this goofy family that wormed its way into our hearts, corny as that sounds.  They feel that comedy is even better with a little dramatic backdrop to give it some urgency.  They don't just laugh at the characters, they feel for them a little, too.  The slower pace of these early stories and the more character-oriented dialogue fit right in with that sensibility.

I agree with the reviewer who said that these shows seem to be less out-and-out comedies than funny family sitcoms with a dramatic tinge.  From what the commentaries suggest, it seems it was largely the influence of James L. Brooks that gave it that element.  I miss it a lot.  As the show got funnier and funnier, it gradually lost the warmth.  (These days, as someone else pointed out, it's also lost a lot of maturity.) The best balance between humor and warmth was achieved, I think, in seasons 2 through 4. After that the show was incredibly funny, but it rarely ever had the sincerity that seems to color this first, half-season. Don't forget, they were in uncharted waters.  It was very unlikely in anyone's mind that the show would take off the way it did.  Matt Groening was right when he referred to season one as ""a series of wild experiments that succeeded beyond our dreams"".  They were appealing to anyone out there who would tune in and give the show a chance.  Kids were a bonus, but it was the adults who mattered.

  What I regret is how ""The Simpsons"" seems to have been taken over by a ""Comic-Book Guy"" mentality, only speaking to people who have seen every episode, memorize lines, and know a lot of trivia.  What about outsiders?  This DVD represents the sweat and blood of people who believed enough in this premise to put it out there before the prime-time audiences of America and see what would happen.

Do yourself a favor.  Forget everything.  Forget ""Simpsons-mania"". Forget Emmy awards.  Forget ""fans"". Forget ""DVD extras"". Forget phrases like ""worst episode ever!""  This is just a show on television. You're flipping the channels and you come across this weird cartoon family misbehaving in an opera balcony.  What the hell is this?  Is this about a yellow bug family or something?

You're curious, and you put down the remote.  You view all of this with fresh eyes.  See it for the first time.  (""What's the name of the mom, again?  That weird old guy the father works for is funny.  Hey, that principal kinda reminds me of my uncle. Omigod, Bart is just like my cousin!  Say, what state do they live in?"")

If you simply don't like these episodes, even in that context, then that's that.  Again, everything's subjective.  But if you can view these films on their own terms, blotting out what would come later, you may find it's like being reintroduced to some old friends.

The animation is crude and quirky, but if you know a little about how television animation is produced, you'll know that it's a system where you don't always know who in Asia will be working on what, whether you've got an A crew or a B crew, or how closely the final thing will reflect your carefully made plans. The overseas system, thankfully, has gotten much better in the last fifteen years, thus so has quality-control.

Besides, I think it's fun to see the familiar characters moving in fluid, rubbery ways and occasionally distorting into weird shapes.  As for the voices, while some of them have changed drastically over time, the performances themselves are mostly as good as they ever were.  At times I do find some of Harry Shearer's (Skinner, Smithers, Flanders) performances a little flat, but he settled in very quickly.

(side note:  I don't buy the ""Bart-centric"" myth at all.  If you actually look at these (and season 2)one by one, there are less Bart-centered stories versus ones built around Homer and others.  Bart was certainly the one who was merchandised to death early on and was the talk of parents and teachers, but it was totally overblown.  Remove all that and he's just one main character out of four.  Okay, five.)

To conclude, this DVD  contains a very different animal than the one that's on today, and even the classic seasons that followed it. But it's a show that was raw, honest, and for the time, edgy.  Watching it, you'll see that it could have developed in several different directions than the one it did.  This makes it historically interesting to fans, but forget about us.  Casual buyers who never really got into the show should pick this up to see what all the shouting was about fifteen years ago. I dare 'em not to at least grin.",1105315200,13,6602,4.7458223394898855

Plus very nice video and audio quality as well. In addition, each ""Simpsons"" DVD collection includes a very nicely-done and handy multi-page booklet, which gives a wealth of information about the programs in that season set.

I think a lot of people who have purchased this first-season (1989-1990) DVD set might be saying (like I did): ""Hey, that first year of the show wasn't so bad after all"". In fact, I found most of these 13 programs very funny, indeed.

Sure, the voices sound slightly different than in subsequent seasons; but overall, Homer and his gang can still tickle your funny-bone more often than any other single TV program I can think of.

Each of ""The Simpsons"" DVD sets is (alone) worth purchasing for the hilariously-oddball antics of one Mr. C. Montgomery Burns. There are a boundless number of famous and smile-inducing ""Monty-isms"" contained within the many ""Simpsons"" full-season DVD boxed sets. Such as.........

>> ""Well, that's odd -- I've just robbed a man of his livelihood, and yet I feel strangely empty. Tell you what, Smithers -- have him beaten to a pulp.""

>> ""I'm looking for something in an attack dog. One who likes the sweet gamey tang of human flesh. Hmmm, why here's the fellow ... wiry; fast; firm, proud buttocks. Reminds me of me.""

>> ""Look at them, Smithers! -- Goldbrickers! Layabouts! Slug-a-beds! Little do they realize their days of suckling at my teat are numbered!""

>> ""I could crush him like an ant. But it would be too easy. No, revenge is a dish best served cold. I'll bide my time until ... Oh, what the hell; I'll just crush him like an ant.""

ROFL!!

So, kids of Springfield, if you know what's good for ya, pick up this inaugural-season Digital Disc set of ""The Simpsons"". *

* = And you'd better get all subsequent DVD season sets as well -- or else you just might find yourself face-to-hilarious-face with Montgomery Burns, with Monty uttering those four dreaded words that we all fear ..... ""Smithers, release the hounds!"" :)",1104883200,,2748,5.109375
907117,5,6304561873,"...Mental institution, that is!  The Simpsons have been gradually getting funnier and better every season and this is where it all started.
It seems kind of funny watching the somewhat crude animation and Homer's funny voice (not to mention Barney's yellow hair!), but this was pretty cutting edge in 1989, so to speak.
Bart the General, Bart the Genius and Krusty gets Busted are among my favorites, although there aren't really bad episodes.
Wether you're a Simpsons noob or have been watching the Simpsons BEFORE the Simpsons religiously (Tracey Ullman, Inside Herman's Head), this set should be a must for any TV fan, if not just a must period.",1104624000,,648,4.944954128440367
907118,5,6304561873,"Here is where it all began. A lot of people complain about the relative shoddiness of these early episodes. It is true that the season is rather crude compared to the next two seasons, which in my opinion are the best Simpsons shows of all.

But it is necessary to distinguish ineptitude from primitiveness. When the show began in 1989-90, the Simpsons show was still being born. The show was initially a family sit com, aimed much more at people Bart Simpson's age; and Bart was considered to be the main character (remember those days?)

The crudity of all elements in this series is like seeing Predynastic Egyptian art, or Archaic Greek sculpture - it is weirdly fascinating. I love being able to see all the possibilities that existed, before the characters and style were formalised and standardised in Season Four. I like hearing Bart Simpson *first* saying ""don't have a cow"" - and sayiong lot of other things that seem totally out of place. I like seeing Lisa first showing signs of her later character, while basically being a female Bart.

Besides, these shows have heart. The home-made quality of Season One and Two is very appealing and warm, somehow, as if the writers actally cared about ther characters. The show was not a complete comedy at first - the writers could pull out the somber and unforgettale masterpiece ""Moaning Lisa"" with its classic jazz scene, and also the adultery-tale of ""On the Fast Lane"". These classic episodes are not *supposed* to be that funny. Many newer episodes totally sacrifice drama - they all sort of meld into each other as a random set of skits - while every single episode in Seasons One to Three has its own distinct style.

The classics ""Krusty Gets Busted"" and ""Crepes of Wrath"", moreover, point the way the show would go in future, with their cynicism and hilarious plots.

If you are at all interested in the more primitive and personable episodes that began the Simpsons boom, then buy this DVD set!!!",1104192000,2,1959,4.75

907210,1,6304561873,"It's not for nothing that Matt Groening says ""we didn't know what the hell we were doing back then"" in the liner notes of this DVD collection. I suppose that these early episodes might have some value to hardcore ""Simpsons"" collectors and archivists, but they're missing the one essential ingredient of later episodes: the humor. THESE SHOWS AREN'T FUNNY. It wasn't until late in the third season or early in the fourth that ""The Simpsons"" became smart and witty and consistently enjoyable. I'm looking forward to the release of the sixth season(1994-95), which was my personal favorite.

Everybody has to start somewhere; Homer and Company started with these clumsy, poorly-written shows. As good as ""The Simpsons"" has been for years and still is, why bother to relive the ugly-duckling stage of its development? Avoid.",1102982400,7,820,5.119402985074627

Anyway, the first season of The Simpsons, while looking a bit crude by today's smooth animation and sound editing standards, is still some of the best cartoons on TV.  This 3-disc set is truly a must-have for any Simpsons fan.

The DVD set has some interesting ""bonus"" features, such as scripts for a select few episodes.  It's actually fun to read a script and then watch that episode in animation.  While, at least it was fun for me for a couple of them, then it got boring.

The video quality on the DVDs is very good; there's nothing I can find fault with.  You also get a French audio track, and English and Spanish subtitles in case you are playing host family to a foreign student who has trouble grasping the Simpsons' accent.",1102464000,,775,4.492857142857143
907213,5,6304561873,"Forget what people say about the first season being bad.  Yes, it's different but it's still great. The Tracey Ullman short was a nice touch, they should get those all out on DVD.  This is a must-have for Simpsons fans",1102032000,,218,4.425
907214,5,6304561873,"I was one of those fans who watched The Simpsons from the very start; back in those days, even at college, all we had were rabbit ears to pick up the less than clear local Fox station - some folks back then, in 1989, still did not even have a local Fox station.  Things have changed a whole lot since the thirteen-episode first season of this classic comedy, but in many ways The Simpsons has not.  As I write this, the show's still going strong and building upon the work done all those years ago.  While there was a bit of experimentation back in the early days, the characters emerged fully formed from the very first show.  It's quite a treat to be able to watch these first thirteen episodes in order again and to reflect back upon the controversy and instant impact this animated show immediately made on popular culture.

I was amazed at how vibrant and familiar these first shows seemed; it seems like only yesterday that I was introduced to Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, Maggie, and all the denizens of Springfield.  Every episode here is a classic.  Watching There's No Disgrace Like Home, the third episode, I was unexpectedly taken back to the very beginning of Simpsons mania as I watched the Simpsons repeatedly administer shocks to themselves to the consternation of family therapist Marvin Monroe.  And who could forget the terrible ordeal Bart endured at the hands of two French cretins (or little Adil Hoxha, foreign exchange student from Albania - a legend in the lore of Simpsons trivia) in The Crepes of Wrath.  In terms of pure hilarity, look no farther than Homer's Night Out, in which Homer becomes the swingingest swinger in town and elicits a plea for help in the ladies' department from none other than Mr. Skinner himself.  The first memorable guest performers also lended their special magic to the show early on: Penny Marshall as the baby-sitting bandit in Some Enchanted Evening, Kelsey Grammer as Sideshow Bob in Krusty Gets Busted, and Albert Brooks as the RV salesman in Call of the Simpsons and Jacque, Marge's French admirer and bowling instructor in Life On the Fast Lane.  I could write a paragraph about every single episode, as each one is a classic.

The commentary for each episode is fabulous, as a whole gaggle of the geniuses who brought the show to life come together to laugh at the best bits, talk about the show's genesis and evolution during this experimental first season, and provide fans with all kinds of trivia and juicy tidbits about the whole Simpsons phenomenon.  You can clearly see the show develop with each passing episode, particularly in terms of the level of detail in the animation and, to some degree, the voices.  With the help of the commentaries, you get a whole new perspective on Homer and the gang.  One can't help but be impressed by the way each character was developed early on, the chemistry that quickly emerged between all the characters, and the way in which serious issues were explored in such a comedic manner.  Gosh, you had Marge and Homer's marriage on the rocks in a couple of episodes, Bart's deportation to France for his excessive shenanigans at school, the capture of Bart and Lisa by a wanted criminal, the framing and imprisonment of Krusty, the problem of illiteracy, etc.  This show really had it all, right from the very start.

I don't know why I waited so long to add The Simpsons Season One to my DVD collection, but I can't wait to get all of the seasons on DVD.  After 15+ years, it's easy to take this show for granted, but this Season One DVD with all of its extras has reawakened my old passion for this incredible television show.  Speaking of extras, you get a look here at the first animated version of the show, and it's just as horrible as Matt Groening and the other Simpsons bigwigs said it was.  You have to see it to believe it.  After seeing that, you realize more than ever how lucky we are to have The Simpsons in our lives.",1101427200,2,3937,4.618364418938307
907215,5,6304561873,"'The Simpsons' is one of my favorite shows-always will be,but when I first saw it during this season BOY it shocked me! I'd never seen an animated show like this-the writing was the best I'd seen on such a program and it was very quirckily entertaining! One thing fans should know was that this was what I call the 'starring Bart Simpson' season-most of these shows involve Bart going to France,getting in trouble,walking in the woods in a skirt of leaves,etc. Even his own family play second fiddle to his antics. Homer Simpson's voice is much deeper,blander and alot less silly then it was to become. Also you'll see alot of the characters in their formative,trial and error stages. Of notice is a black Mr. Smithers (????),Marge nearly having an extra maritial affair with a character that (unfortunately) would never appear on the show again and Police Cheif Wiggum's ever-changing hair color. But my favorite episode probably involved the baby sitter bandit Ms. Botts,who hold Bart,Lisa and Maggie hostange as she plunders the Simpsons shoddy wares.

  You'll notice how hyper aware of his general idiocy Homer is during this time;on each of the 13 shows he's constantly pointing out his stupidity rather then revelling in it as he does now. These shows have a slightly more surreal and comic book quality that's appealing too. First season yes,great shows DEFINATELY and alot of pleasures (some guilty) for all of us. Some guilt though-I'm still into it at year 16!!!!",1098921600,2,1474,4.935483870967742
907216,5,6304561873,"I was lucky to grow up watching the Simpsons.  Season one began it all, well before Homer was dumbed down beyond belief, and before writers put in stuff like Principal Skinner saying ""ball-sack.""
  My biggest complaint is that not all of the Tracy Ulman shorts were included, only the first one.  My other complaint is that I got ripped off when I bought this new.  At the time it was 30 dollars.  Now it is half that, new.
  I think this DVD set at 14 dollars may be the best deal on Amazon period.  In the stores, the list price is still above 30 dollars.

  The Quebec reviewer is complaining that the spoken French voice overs in the Simpsons is not Quebec French but, gasp, the French people speak in France.  Why he wrote that in French and not English I don't understand, b/c I'm sure he knows English too considering he is using Amazon and lives in Canada.  I feel for you ""homme"" but don't forget this is an American show, written in English.  Youd be better servered listening to the original voices in English, after all the voices are what make the Simpsons great.",1098230400,4,1076,4.418367346938775
907217,5,6304561873,"It's too bad so many feel this first season wasn't funny compared to what is being put out now. This first season's episodes were a different sort of humor that didn't rely entirely on overblown/outlandish plots and cheap laughs. Much of the humor in these episodes is subtler and perhaps not sledgehammer enough for some people's tastes. Watching one of Groening's pre-Simpson's bunnies gnawing on Homer's arm while he rolls around on the grass is pretty funny if you can see the irony in it. The entire first season is full of inferred chuckles that some people might not get. That's too bad!

The artwork is much more amateurish but that is pretty funny too and I have no doubt the crew must have laughed themselves silly when putting these episodes together. Personally I would much rather have this collection than anything labeled as The Simpsons in the last few years.",1096761600,3,875,4.7947019867549665
907278,5,6304561873,"I still remember all the hype when the Simpson's originally aired in prime time in 1989-1990. Up until then, there hadn't been a cartoon in prime time since the Flintstone's (?). Anyways, it was something new and refreshing at the time and since then, we have all grown with the family over the years. This dvd is a little short since there was originally only 13 episodes but it is filled with lots of commentaries and extras, including the original skit from The Tracey Ullman Show.

I'm sure there aren't many people out there who haven't used a phrase from the Simpson's at one time or another. Not sure whether that is a good thing or not... DOH! One of the fun things people look for in every episode is what Bart writes on the Blackboard during the intro. So, here they are:

907282,1,6304561873,"This is by far the worst season of the Simpsons and definately a disgrace to the entire Simpsons series. Its amazing how much I could like the later seasons of the show and, in contrast, how much I could find this season unwatchable.

 The animation is absolutely horrid to start with. No, unwatchable, and that's the truth. Not only are the individual edisodes absolutely devoid of comedy, but the fact that the developers wouldn't even take the time to make the animation consistant, forget pleasant, just consistant. With terrible and outright lame storylines for the episodes, the least they could have done was their job. The bay windows of the Simpson home change from flat to, surprise, bay style, every episode. In addition, one episode Smithers in black, in one Cheif Wiggim is Creole, and in every one the cast is comprised of nameless, faceless minions that look two demesional.

 Next, the episodes are absolutely devoid of comedy. What this season calls comedy is Krusty the clown asking if betting on sporting events is a crime. That was the only laugh I had through the entire mess. One attempt at a joke was Bart telling how long the episode would take: 27 minutes and 39 seconds. When the developers are resorting to how long the episode will last, thats pretty downright sad.

 Here is a typical episode. The Simpsons go to church. Homer listens to a football game while there, and Bart asks if monkeys go to Heaven. He then makes new bully friends and they sit and watch clouds and drink slurpees. He then cuts off the head of the town founder and is chased by an angry mob, only for them to change their mind about killing them. See the comedy? No, well neither do I. Boring. Lame. Waste of money. That's what I see.

 Not to mention the fact that the storylines are completely plot driven. The characters are not the stereotypes of the charcters that are in the later seasons. Cheif Wiggim and the cops are just the cops, not stereotypes of what is funny about the cops. There's no Cheif Wiggim planting evidence, or taking the wrong guy to jail, or eating donuts, or not believing there's an elephant going through people's lawns. Just ""book 'em boys"". So lame, two dementional, and boring.

 Oh, and Homer being the main character hasn't yet been developed. No we get to see Bart flush a cherry bomb down the toilet and watch him drink slurpees with the local bullies, or skateboard around town. In this season Bart writing on the chalkboard is the main attraction. But we all know, that Bart is what Bart is, a supportive character. Homer is supposed to be the main charcter. There's no Homer going into space and nearly ruining a space launch and killing an entire crew over potatoe chips, or be ""a fish eating machine"". No we get to see him lug a boulder and nearly attempt to kill himself. That's drama, not comedy. Oh, we also get to see Marge throw him out of the house for dancing with a stripper and that Marge is dating a French bowling instructor. Again, this isn't a drama.

 Moe's tavern changes its look so many times, I once again marvel at the developers disreguard for consistancy. That's the least they could do. If not pleasant to look at, and terrible voice acting, consistancy is the least they could do. Watching Lisa ""get the blues"", like I care for more drama, and Bart calling Moe asking for a ""Jaques Strap"" is also more attempted, but failing comedy.

 Another thing to look for is a lack of recognizable charcters, and forget guest appearances, such as Rainier Wolfcastle(Arnold Swarzenegger), Willie(also a lack of Irish people made fun of for drinking), a Michael Jackson impersonation, Doctor Hibbert(""Hee-hee-hee""), and Doctor Joe Riveriera(any surgery $129.95, ""Hello Everybody!)

 I'm going to pretend that this season doesn't exist, because its boring, lame, absolutely devoid of comedy, and a disgrace to the Simpson name.",1091404800,14,3880,4.751488095238095

I would have given this season set a 2 or 3 Stars but its the first season.. it deserves more & it spawned 14more seasons & its expected to run at least 4 more years to this date. The simpsons has been the best animated series there is & this is the season that started it all.",1085529600,,1270,4.4

Contrary to movies, where the origional is always the best, ie, the first ""Halloween"", the origional ""Lethal Weapon"", and the origional ""Airplane"", television series' tend to go in the opposit direction.
Yes I suppose all Simpsons fans know that the first classic episodes featured rough animation and off kilter voice overs, but I was unaware of the extent of the damage we're dealing with here.
In another anymous review titled ""mediocre"", the writer was the first person who actually seen what I had seen.  Yes these were classics, but like he mentioned, when was Smithers an African American.  Maybe I have excess anylitical skills, but in addition to this, Chief Wiggims turns every color in between brown, tan, baige and yellow in a single episode, which is ""Krusty gets busted"".
Also like the same review pointed, this season offered only funny moments, and there were no real laughs, save for when the entire Simpsons family gives each other shock therapy in the episode ""There's No Disgrace Like Home"".
Upon this there were many very pleasant episodes, such as ""The Crepes of Wrath"", as well as ""Krusty Gets Busted"", where Sideshow Bob is introduced as Bart's eternal nemisis, yet this only shadows what is to come.
Call me a pessimist, but I'd rather own (I do anyway) from season two on, when Arnold Swatrzenegger guest starred, in addition to when the animation is clear and refined, and the voice acting is top notch and in its stride, and when the episodes move with the brisk speed and zanny antics that us Simpson fans have grown to love.
Because face it folks, without the top notch voice acting that shapes the characters, more interesting characters to fit into every episode in zanny ways (Milhouse sudenly appearing in the living room of the Simpsons' home and exclaiming ""Because he's the kind that kisses and leaves you, indicating Homer), well then its just not worth it for me.
Despite the many glithches and loads of seasons that out there or will be available soon, this first season still has its moments.",1084147200,,2035,4.844827586206897

907515,5,6304561873,"Watching this brings me back really far as I first watched the Simpsons. Their voices have not been fully mastered yet. You can tell by listening to Homer. His has changed the most since this to the modern Simpsons. Bart was the closest to what we are having today. Even though the animation and voice is not, you still would not stop because once you start watching, the story will hook you into the story and more you want to watch it. Simpsons story line is even better than what we have right now, too bad they never made a Simpsons movie. Bart the trouble maker had alot of great story line demonstrating how adolescence troubles are, like how he dealt with being so called genius (Bart the Genius), also how he dealt with the bullie of the school (Bart the general), also how Lisa is going through her thing when she feels nobody understands her (Moaning Lisa), also stuff concerning Homer and Marge and abou t their family, Simpsons is also funny, even in this primitive stage. This is probably America's most favorite past time show and its for people of all ages.

Although this first season brings back memories, it's just plain not entertaining, much like Seinfeld, another show that turned out to be one of the 2 best shows of all time along with the Simpsons, had a horrible first season.

I grew up on the Simpsons ever since they first aired in Australia in 1990 and have grown up with the show and sad as it may seem, have grown tired of the new material around 1999 when it appeared to start copying another little animated show that was gaining popularity at the time... I loved the first season as it's all done by hand and it's focus on the show was Bart's escapades, well before the show's creators realized Homer was the star. For those kids who write reviews bad mouthing this season, who were mostly likely being born when the Simpsons show first aired, I say go home. Granted the Simpsons didn't really strike massive genius until season 3-4, the new seasons are much worse than the early ones. How can you not laugh when the Simpsons constantly electrocute each other when they're at Dr. Marvin Monroe's (Remember him?) family therapy center. The Simpsons were less refined but a hell of lot more mature in the early days, and the state of the show today makes this collection capture the times and how much of the show has changed since then.

907644,2,6304561873,"Yes, that's right. The first season of THE SIMPSONS was mediocre. Many readers will instinctively click the negative button under my review but you seem like an intelligent person. If you haven't bought ""Season 1"" or don't remember or haven't seen any of these episodes, hear me out.
 It was nothing like the second, third, fourth, fifth and eight seasons (the only ones worth collecting once the entire series is on DVD by the year 2050) and isn't much like our favorite show at all.
The most glaring thing is the awful animation. Now THE SIMPSONS hasn't ever been ""pretty"" but I cannot comprehend how they managed to look so shoddy. Did they have the color cells filled in by chimpanzees? Was Krusty drawn by Matt Groening's down-syndrome inflicted four year old? It sounds unkind but see the episode where Krusty gets framed by...is that Sideshow Bob? In another episode (before he gets fired), he looks and acts just like Sideshow Mel! And since when was Smithers African-American???????????? :-O
-=possible spoilers ahead=-
Now one could overlook the shoddy production if the storylines were half as clever as they would become. But they're not. As a matter of fact, some of them are painfully pedestrian. There are funny ""moments"" here and there (a preview of good things to come) but everything in between ranges from pedestrian to just painful to watch. The camping episode? Were they trying to write a Brady Bunch episode? Lisa gets ""the blues?"" As if anybody cared about Lisa even then?????
The only real saving graces here are the Christmas special (which is delightfully twisted in a National Lampoons kind of way) and ""Bart the General"" which has some really good moments, like the tribute to ""Patton.""
THE SIMPSONS first season is a historical curiosity which doesn't hold up today. You won't want to buy this unless you like completion.",1073088000,11,1851,4.913738019169329

This set is like the Alamo. It's not really as thrilling for many of us as it must've been for the people who experienced it, but it's still textbook-worthy material, so what are you gonna do?
It kinda makes me wonder if, by the time that like, Season 13 is out, if those will be like this. I don't think so, because Season 2 and 3 are still good for entertainment. The Samantha ""Stinky"" Stanky episode always makes me laugh.",1072569600,,778,4.485915492957746

It's great to be able to sit down and watch this series build itself up, introducing great characters by ones and twos.  A must have for any Simpsons fan.
The only draw back is that yes, it is kind of lean on DVD extras.  I haven't watched the episodes with commentary, yet, but am looking forward to doing so.

This DVD pack also features comments by the creators of the show, Matt Groening and James L. Brooks, in wich they explain how it all started.
The animation in this first season is not technologically sophisticated as other animated products nowadays, and this voices are not synchronized with the visual caracters, but what really counts is the writing wich makes us laugh and be aware of many of society's problems at the same time.
This light approachto exposing serious issues is probably what has kept ``The Simpsons`` on air for 14 years. This DVD is a definite must if you are a Simpsons fan.",1066608000,,871,4.8133333333333335
907649,5,6304561873,"The Simpsons were pretty basic in their first season - the animation and the voices were crude, and the subjects were all rather realistic family situations, not very far from the shorts of the Tracy Ullman days. The cast of characters was small. Still, this first season is mandatory watching material, as almost every episode here is a comedy classic. All in all, though the series and the humor weren't as developed back then as they are nowadays - in season 15 and counting - but the storylines were much tighter and more to the point than they are now. Some of my favorite episodes include -
`There's No Disgrace Like Home', an unforgettable classic episode that features some memorable scene including the `Clockwork Orange'-ish shock therapy scene.
`Bart The General' deals with Bart's confrontation with Nelson Muntz and his bullies. With Grampa's help, Bart creates an army of children to battle the thugs.
`Moaning Lisa' marks the first appearance of Ron Taylor as Lisa's jazz tutor, Bleeding Gums Murphy.
`The Telltale Head' is the memorable classic in which Bart cuts off the head of the statue of city pioneer Jebediah Springfield, and is the most originally written episode in the season, as it's told in its entirety as a flashback.
In `Life On The Fast Lane' Marge falls for the seductive French bowling instructor Jacque, again with some very memorable scenes.
`The Crepes Of Wrath' - Bart is sent to France as part of a student exchange plan, and the Simpsons get to house a lovely Albanian boy, actually a spy. And finally -
`Krusty Gets Busted', one of the most classic episodes in the series, which marks Kelsey Grammer's first appearance as the psychotic Sideshow Bob. Grammer is hilarious in this episode - I just love it when he sings `Every Time We Say Goodbye' at the end of his show.

Being Season one, the character development hasn't had time to mature and this makes for a slightly distracting watch. I keep expecting Homer to talk like he 'does', not like he 'did'. He also comes across as far more sensible than in subsequent seasons. Basically he's a whole different person.
Nevertheless, the 13 episodes that are in this set are of fairly decent stock and do entertain however I would recommend that you buy seasons 2 or 3 before this one.

It is the greatest television show of all time, outlasting most shows, animated and live actions, never losing steam, getting better with age.  This past season is one of the best on record.
They are household names like the President and Michael Jordan.  They're faces are everywhere.  They're America's greatest family.  Bart is American's Bad Boy, Homer is America's greatest father figure, he screws up but has redeming qualities, Marge is the do it all mother, but police officer and jailbird under the surface, Lisa is the underappreciated genious whose gifts go perpetually unrewarded and Maggie is just so cute.
The supporting characters are as good as the principal players.  Grandpa and Moe are hilarious, Lenny and Carl are always reliable for a dumb laugh, Ned Flanders is irritating but you can't live without him, Principal Skinner and Mrs. Krabapple are sardonically indespensible and laslty Apu is the unsung hero of the show: working twenty four hours a day, perpetual sex magnet and father to a score of children.  And he's always giving us something to laugh at.
The music is memorable.  Any fan will say they hum the theme song every day of their lives, even if it's just once.  The songs and dances are staged like lavish Broadway shows, i.e. the We Put The Spring in Springfield.
But it was all here where the show started.  The writing more than made up for the rough drawing and animation.  One of my favorite things to do is watch this season compared to other seasons and see how the characters evolve: voices and hair styles, coloring and clothes and whatnot.  The scenery changes, the colors change and it just transformed over night to the finely honed master piece it is today.
This first season is packed with some of the best episodes, no episode is a bad one, some of the best jokes, (Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, Nixon, Comet, Cupid... Donna Dixon), some normal chalk board gags and some funny ones, the couch gags are all pretty much the same, the themse song and opening sequence is unrefined, but the show has become the mega hit it is today.  The lines have been tightened, the colors have been sharpened, the voices have been tuned and this has become the best show on televisioin.
Order of episodes:
1. The Crepes of Wrath is the best of season one and remains one of the best of the entire series.
2. Krusty Gets Busted showscases one of the series more popular characters, initiates the best story line of the series, Sideshow Bob wants to kill bart.  Very smart and very funny, it remains one of my favorites.
3. Bart The General is a great Patton parody and it begins the Bart versus Nelson journey.
4. Homer's Odyssey showcases Homer's fight aginst Mr. Burns, introducing one of the funniest characters in the show. Viva Senor Burns!
5. Simpsons Roasting On An Open Fire sets the standard for how The Simpsons seem to be heading for the top, but just crash right back down at the bottom.  It still hasn't lost it's freshness.
6. There's No Disgrace Like Home, I just like seeing Maggie get shocked, it's funny.
7. Life On The Fast Lane is the first of many clashes between Homer and Marge over Homer's, stupidity.
8. Homer's Night Out, is the second of many clashes between Homer and Marge over Homer's, stupidity.
9. Call Of The Simpsons is good poking fun at Homer's weight, smell and eating habits.  Welcome Simpsons faithful Albert Brooks.
10. Bart The Genius is a good introduction to Bart's deceptive ways.  But they get better.
11. The Telltale Head begins the chemistry between Bart and the bullies other than Nelson Muntz, but theirs are always enjoyable roles.
12. Moaning Lisa is just kind of a boring introduction to Lisa's moroseness we've grown accustomed to.
13. Some Enchanted Evening is the introduction of Bart and Lisa's hijinx, but they get better.
All in all, the first season, one of the best seasons, of the best TV series of all time is done justice with this box set.  Even the packaging is great!  I GIVE IT MY HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION POSSIBLE!",1051056000,3,4310,4.735294117647059
907883,5,6304561873,"It could be argued the simpsons is the greatest ever animated series.  Obviously it's not made for kids, maybe the kid in all of us.  The first season introduces us to many of the zany characters we have come to love.  It's interesting to compare the animation and evolution of the series from these first few episode.  A must see & own for fans.  you gotta love it, now....EAT MY SHORTS!",1050796800,,388,4.408450704225352
907884,4,6304561873,"Compared to anything else available out there, I'd give this set 4 stars.  But in comparison to all the upcoming seasons of the Simpsons, I can only give it 4 (unless I could give the others six or seven!).
The animation is so crude compared to what we see on this show today.  The voices are weird.  And the plots are a bit cruder, the characters still rough-edged.  The show hadn't quite figured out how to make Homer a loveable lug or Bart a loveable scamp.  You can almost see why some parents objected to this show...it was a bit rough.
But it sure had one thing going for it right from the start...it was REALLY, REALLY funny.
If you haven't seen the Simpsons before, I won't try to talk you into them with this review.  But I will say you've missed something special!
If you know (and love) The Simpsons, you don't need my convincing.  But you might want to know if this set is worth the cost.  I say, absolutely.  Having the episodes so pristine is great.  And there is commentary from all the major creators for each episode.  Normally, these ""director's commentaries"" on DVD's are not all they're cracked up to be, but particularly in this first year of the show, we really get the idea of how the Simpson's evolved.  James Brooks, Matt Groening and others tell us in great detail how the show developed, and some of the stuff is very subtle and would probably have gone unnoticed.  It's great to watch an episode, then go right back and listen to the commentary.  Very revealing!
I highly recommend this excellent set.",1050278400,,1529,4.492753623188406

Season 1 of The Simpsons is when the show was still trying to find its feet, but the episodes are still funny and everything that you would expect from The Simpsons and its slew of colorful characters. The best part of the DVD are the extras. there are commercials, sketches, concepts, interviews, enough to make any hardcore Simpsons fan go bonkers with excitement! If you are a fan of the hilarious yellow people on The Simpsons, you should buy Season 1. You just wouldn't feel right without it. Refresh your memory of the good ol' days when we were still all trying to figure out why Homer is so stupid and why Marge's hair is blue. If you still don't know, or you have never even heard of the Simpsons, you should buy the DVD to get all of the answers. If you love the phrase Doh! or Don't Have a Cow Man! buy the DVD.

At the time, they were a scandal among parents from my generation (well, some of them) to the point that I wasn't allowed to watch them in the house.  As a consequence, I lost several years worth of viewing.  Fast forward to now, and the first season comes out on DVD.  Naturally, I had to get it.  The reunion was bittersweet.  There were some classic episodes that I remembered, some I never saw, and a load of special features.  But the episodes weren't as funny, at least not as funny as they were in 1993 when I finally started watching in earnest.  It was kind of a let down.  Of course, I watched the whole thing through, but it was kind of empty.  I guess I'll get the other two seasons that are out, but it won't be worth it until Season 4 comes out.  For anyone out there who would get this set, do so only if you're a diehard fan (I'm not) or are looking for nostalgia (I wasn't).

Pros-
*Homer was actually a little bit smarter
*its story and plot actually had a depth to it instead of the ""one stupid thing after another"" storyline that we know today
*its the first season of americas favorite family wat can u say?
Cons-
*the characters look more like Dr. Seuss characters
*the drawing and voice's r weird

It became sillier but was still okay for a season or two, but by the time I entered high school-1996-the show had gone to pot and the current show bears absolutely no relation to the first seasons. Who cares if the animation is not as standardized(I actually think it is very clever and innovative-note the dream sequences in ""Bart the Genius"", ""Life in the Fast Lane"", and the ""Bully"" episode).

Now admittedly, it couldn't have gone 20+ seasons if it stayed in this vein.  But I do like these episodes better.

It's also amazing traveling back in time to see these early episodes. Here's Homer, sounding like Walter Matthau. There's Marge getting drunk at the company picnic. Who's that family whose car receives the ray of sunlight from the Lord - they're not the Flanders! Chief Wiggum is young and nearly robust. And is Smithers black? Of course, there were the days when nobody on the show had identifiable skin color.
Every episode has a commentary track - unlike some other TV DVD sets - by a handful of the creators, from Matt Groening and James Brooks to the various writers and directors. Hearing their insights into how characters developed - which characters are ""off-model,"" how changes came about - puts all the weirdness into perspective. And hearing them crack up as they see episodes they haven't watched in years is an added attraction.
No matter how much they were feeling their way in the first season, this collection is full of classic episodes, such as ""Call Of The Simpsons,"" in which the family goes camping and Homer is mistake for Bigfoot, ""Krusty Gets Busted,"" which introduces Sideshow Bob's criminal genius, and ""There's No Disgrace Like Homer,"" complete with electroshock therapy.

Ned Flanders was mixing drinks and losing his temper and not acting as the passive Christian neighbor, Lisa was smart but much more bratty, Marge was more aggressive, Smithers was black, etc. There are some funny episodes the first season, but few that were as geniously funny as they would become once the characters and everything were more figured out. Of course in comparison to other shows, even when the Simpsons are bad they're better than 95% of what else is on television, but once you've seen how great they can be it's hard to settle for less.
What's really cool about these DVDs though are the commentaries by Matt Groening, the animators, producers, etc. It's really interesting to hear different strategies they employ in creating the Simpsons (e.g., they try to never have a shot of them straight on, but rather at a sideways angle) and to hear them joke about different characters and how their characterizations developed (e.g. Smithers' homoerotic love for Mr. Burns).

Homer's voice is even different in the first season.  There are a number of interesting extras, including one funny commentary track where someone is so disgusted with the crude quality of an early unreleased show that he actually walks out and the commentary ends.

Unfortunately, you cannot really watch the episodes themselves with the commentary on, the sound of the show is nearly impossible to hear or concentrate on.  I recommend watching the episode, then restarting it with the commentary (you reach the commentary as though it was a form of subtitle).

But because they didn't put it all on one disc, they caused a huge price for only about seven episodes.  This brings us to my second problem.

908414,3,6304561873,"These 3 discs contain the entirety of the first season of the television series Time Magazine called ""The Greatest of the Century.""  Since television has only existed this century, I guess that means it's the greatest show of all time....  At any rate, the Simpson's did not earn that honour in its first season alone.  In fact, most would agree that this season is the worst.  As Matt Groening points out numerous times in the audio commentaries, ""We had no idea what we were doing.""  It shows - the animation is sometimes crude, the characters are uneven (their personalities had not been worked out yet), and occasionally voices change because the character was read by two different actors.  Finally, compared to the pace of the shows from the second season on, these move at a snail's pace and do not have nearly so many sly pop-culture references that make the later episodes so emminently re-watchable.
However - all the Simpsons' charm is there, from Homer trying to buy a motor home bigger than the Flanderses' to Bart cheating on an IQ test.  The audio commentaries are fun to listen to - these will probably be the most interesting ones because we get some insight into the origin of the series (although through 13 of these, there's some repetitive/contradictory information).  The extras that are included are fun, especially the Tracy Ulman short (which is mostly shown in one of the ""flashback"" episodes somewhere around Season 12, but here it's shown in its entirety).  The best part, though, is that these episodes are shown cut-free, as opposed to the hacked-up, ad-ridden syndicated versions we are subject to with the reruns on our local affiliate stations.
Overall, the DVD is worth 3 stars.  The series is showing promise at this point, but it's not until the 2nd season that the first really good episode appears (Homer and Delilah).  There is a truly hilarious audio outtake bit on Al Brooks improvising Jacques' (the bowling instructor) dialogue.  However, long-time fans are likely to be dissappointed that more early information is not provided.  There's only 1 episode on the third disc so there's lots of extra space - why not give us more of the Tracy Ulman shorts?
At any rate, this DVD is a great start to the Simpsons collection, and rest assured, the episodes just keep getting better and better (at least, until Season 8 or so.....)",1031270400,2,2367,4.843672456575683

908506,5,6304561873,"Finally, I can have my favorite show on DVD, to watch over and over again (my poor videotapes were wearing out). Season One, with its crude and uneven animation (Smithers' dark skin in ""Homer's Odyssey,"" for example) and tentative voice work (Dan Castellanetta's Walter Matthau-ish early Homer), does not look like the show that would revolutionize television. But the cleverly nuanced humor that has made the show immortal is here in full effect, and we see the beginnings of the characters that would become TV icons as enduring as Lucy, Klinger, and Joe Friday. We see that Bart was less of a brat then, and more of a scapegoat; Lisa had yet to emerge as the sax-wielding activist vegetarian Buddhist character she would become. Homer and Marge have remained mostly the same, though I could swear that Homer gets a little dumber with each season. And Maggie...well, if you had this family, you'd stay pretty quiet, too. Here we meet Smithers and Burns, Skinner and Mrs. Krabapple, Grandpa and Krusty, Sideshow Bob and Apu, Reverend Lovejoy and Ned Flanders, and Patty and Selma for the first time; we're also introduced to the mayhem of Itchy and Scratchy (pretty tame in season one). Here you'll find some of the show's bona fide classics: ""Krusty Gets Busted,"" ""The Crepes of Wrath,"" ""Call of the Simpsons,"" and of course, the immortal Christmas special that started it all. The DVD extras are among the best I've ever seen, with hilarious commentary from creator Matt Groening on all 13 episodes, and some of his first character sketches. In addition, there's the short piece from the Tracy Ullmann show, ""Goodnight Simpsons,"" plus original scripts for four episodes, and a handful of outtakes. And if you've ever wanted to watch the show in, say, French, well, the DVD offers that, as well. For rabid fans like myself, this is a godsend.",1029542400,,1844,4.875796178343949
908507,4,6304561873,"I try to restrain from using hyperbole to describe any products I review, but there is no doubt in my mind that ""The Simpsons"" is the greatest animated series in television history.  No other show has ever shown such adeptness at meshing social satire, contemporary events, and random, but hilarious jokes all into one series.  It is interesting how an episode can begin in one place while its conclusion is somewhere completely different and unrelated.  Yet, one never gets lost or confused by the path it takes.  It is, paradoxically, a controlled stream of consciousness exercise.  This ""...Season 1"" DVD shows how the show got its start.

  Originally an animated short as part of the old ""Tracey Ullman Show"", ""The Simpsons"" got their own timeslot in 1989.  A certain degree of apprehension existed, as no one was quite sure how an animated series, especially one as non-traditional and offbeat as this one would be received by the viewing audience.  The producers involved shouldn't have worried.  ""The Simpsons"" caught on like gangbusters and is now about to enter its 14th season and is the longest running animated series in TV history, and 2nd-longest running primetime show ever (behind the 20 years of ""Gunsmoke"").  In this first season, the animation and character development was a bit rougher than in subsequent seasons.  Homer was a bit less stupid and little more of an angry man than the lovable oaf that he became.  Bart was still the troublemaker, but not as clearly defined as a person.  Maggie, Marge, and Lisa also had a ways to go before finding their niches in the series.  But, I digress.  This was still a very entertaining first season with such memorable episodes as the debut Christmas special ""Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire"" and ""Krusty Gets Busted"", which marks the beginning of Bart's lifelong troubles with Sideshow Bob.  The extras are marvelous, and I still have yet to view all of them.  This series is long overdue on DVD, but I'm elated that it has finally happened.",1029283200,,2009,4.873156342182891

The first season is like an odd stroll down an alley of misplaced and misshapen memories. Its all here:
Homer's first voice (same guy...but different); Moe's black and Barney's blond hair; Speaking of black...Smithers changes races after his first appearance; Flanders changes from a super-capitalist to a born again Christian; and Albert Brooks loses his French accent while calling for some onion rings during an attempt to seduce Marge.
What struck me most were all the things that were part of the Simpsons from the very first season. Unforgettable side characters like Apu, Mr. Burns, Smithers, Krusty the Clown, and even Kelsey Grammar as Side Show Bob are all here at the beginning.
The episodes from the first season may not be the greatest, but there are some darn good ones. The generally slower pace and yet to be established ""ground rules"" aside, who can resist Homer's dive into the potato chips or Moe's over the top fury at having been crank called?
Each episode also includes a commentary featuring Matt Groening as well as the various writers and directors of the episodes. I found these commentaries to be entertaining in their own right and a highlight of the package.

Therefore this first season collection was something that I felt obligated to own as a loyal Simpsons fan, but it is not something that I will be watching over and over again, especially once the later seasons come out on DVD.
As it should not be hard to find a listing of all the Season One episodes with synopses, I will not bother to list all of the episodes. Of the 13 episodes, my favorites were ""Call of the Simpsons"" and ""The Crepes of Wrath."" The DVD extras were okay. There is one Tracy Ulman short, but I would have liked to see more of those.

Its humour is completely derivative of almost any other family sitcom you have ever seen. the only really original thing about it back then was that it was animated. Also the characters are very different in the first season: Homer is much more intelligent and marge much more simple. The only people I would recommend this DVD set to are people interested in the complete history fo the simpsons. Just don't expect to laugh very much or very hard.

The 1st season focuses almost entirely on Bart, around which other characters revolve, excepting the episode of Moaning Lisa. toward the later episodes, Homer begins to take center stage, a position he has held ever since.
The extra features are not funny but the conversation with Groening provides some insight into his mindset when creating the Simpsons. He admits that they were a last minute creation to avoid failure, something I've long suspected.
It's amazing that from thses humble beginnings, the Simpsons have evoled into one of the funniest, most satirical shows on TV.",1025136000,,851,5.042553191489362

908699,5,6304561873,"Although I'm a pretty big fan of ""The Simpsons,"" I hesitated before buying this DVD set. I don't have any first-hand memories of these episodes (I was born in 1983, which would make me 6 at the time these were released), and my impression of this season from reruns was not favorable. There's no such thing as a bad ""Simpsons"", of course, but this season always struck me as mediocre. The animation was poor and the characters were not well-defined, and the show didn't have its manic satirical bent yet.
However ... this set made a believer out of me. The episodes are presented in crystal-clear picture quality, and the sound is great. The episodes themselves, while still not the best ones in the show's history, are all quite entertaining, while several (""Life in the Fast Lane,"" ""Moaning Lisa,"" ""Krusty Gets Busted"") are great. The audio commentary by Matt Groening and other writers and directors is fabulous, and the extra features are a nice bonus. The entire box set couldn't have been put together better.
Although this is still part of the awkward developing stage of ""The Simpsons,"" this box set couldn't have been a more satisfying purchase. I can't wait for ""The Complete Second Season""!",1023235200,2,1201,4.834951456310679

However, everything else about the DVD is pretty lame.  It is difficult to move from episode to episode, very few of the extras on disc three are worth the time to watch.  The 'concept art' has been scanned at such a low quality I'm astonished they spent the time to burn them onto the disc.  I just now realized that there is additional audio commentary buried in the 'language' options - and so I'll bump the review up a notch.
Overall, enjoy the episodes and if you like commentary this is a good buy (esp. for the price!).  Otherwise I might borrow it from a friend for a night.  And really, I hope the product design for the second season is superior.",1022630400,4,917,4.428571428571429

The creators were still figuring out a lot as they went and the first several shows everything from the voices to the appearance of the characters is often quite different from the show we know and love. The first several episodes of this collection are the worst in this regard but the second half of the season starts to get closer to a finished product.
If you are a hard core Simpsons fan and want to watch the evolution of the show then this disk is a great find. If you're looking for some great Simpsons episodes, however, I strongly recommend you be patient and wait for subsequent seasons to be released.",1022284800,3,739,4.401459854014599
908793,5,6304561873,"The first season episodes are without question the least funny. They represent growing pains which we all must endure.  Some good episodes exist here, but most are so-so to bad. But the picture quality and sound are great, no complaints there! Anything else can be attributed to shabby animation on their equally shabby budgets of the time.  Now I wish to include some funny or interesting tid-bits I noticed as I watched the first-season DVDs:
1. Barney's hair is blond! What a freak!  2. Smithers is black! Guess he pulled a Michael Jackson later... And good ol' copper Lou is white! He pulls a reverse MJ in season two!  3. Homer doesn't quite sound like Homer.  4. Homer is a pretty normal guy the first season, and in one episode HE judges Marge and the kids to be hellians!  5. Mr. Burns is a mean, crotchety old man...he mellows out as seasons pass (although his evil always remains strong). 6. Fat Chief Wiggum is actually quite a competent officer!  7. And there was something odd about the Wiggum boy Ralph that I can't remember...
What is truly remarkable is that with all its imperfections, the ""Simpsons Universe"" is quite established here -- all the groundwork in place... later seasons just improve on what's already there.... even most of the regular present-day characters are here in the beginning of it all.  Bow down everyone, for The Simpsons is your king!!!!!",1021161600,6,1381,4.7489539748953975
908794,4,6304561873,"Some pop cultural phenomena are inexplicable, such as the New Kids on the Block or Saved by the Bell.  Others explode on the scene like finely-targeted missiles aimed straight at the fanboys, such as the Spider-Man movie.
Still others grow on us like a fibrous tumor on a 17th-century Bourbon.
Such is the case with ""The Simpsons"".
Those of us who watched Fox religiously from its birth in the late 80s well remember the awkward, Liquid Television-style animation of ""The Simpsons"" back when it was a series of shorts shown between skits on ""The Tracey Ullman Show.""  Who would've thought back then that the odd-looking family choking one another would become ubiquitous in American culture, or that grown men and women would be caught repeating whole scenes around watercoolers at work?
Now the entire first season of this groundbreaking series is available on DVD to spawn a whole new round of watercooler discussion.
The first season found ""The Simpsons"" in the awkward stage of transition from the bare-bones animation on ""Ullman"" to the more polished show we see today.  While the split-second timing, references to pop culture obscura, and rancorous wit we've come to love are apparent only sporadically herein, this collection reminds longtime fans why they fell in love with this show in the first place: the writers were utterly fearless.
For example:  Bart's setting off a cherry bomb in the bathroom gets him sent to France as a foreign exchange student while an Albanian child comes to live with the Simpsons.  Bart is forced to work as an indentured servant to diabolical French wine makers, while the Albanian child dupes Homer into providing him with nuclear intelligence which he then transmits home.  As the erstwhile nuclear spy is led off to a prisoner exchange, Homer bids him adieu while promising to write and send him those civil defense plans he'd wanted.
In another episode, the Simpsons attend a disastrous family therapy session and wind up delivering enough electroshocks to one another to cause a brownout in Springfield.
Can one imagine a primetime cartoon this subversive 13 years ago?
The extras in the DVD edition are a bit sparse: some scripts, an interview, a brief commentary.  But the episodes are phenomenal, and the price is extremely reasonable.
This is a great set and a welcome addition to any fan's library.",1020643200,2,2350,4.994884910485934

Anyway this is where the Simpsons started on fox, and this is the first season, and so some of the animation, sound, and script is a little odd and sometimes sketchy in places.  Don't let that chase you away though, this dvd set includes some of the greatest Simpsons episodes that have ever aired (actually all of the episodes are great!).  Remember when Flanders bought a really expensive RV, and Homer was so jealous that he went out and bought an RV too (except it was really an RV in bad shape)?  Well that episode is on this set.  Remember when Homer didn't get his christmas bonus and Marge used all of the christmas money to get Bart's tattoo removed (ow quit it! right?), but in the end they got Santa's Little Helper?  Well that episode is on here.  Remember when Bart switched his IQ test with Martin, and then went to a school for the gifted?  Well that episode is on here.  Remember all of the prank phone calls to Moe's Bar?  Yep they're all here too.  AH! all of the memories come flooding back don't they?  See the first season isn't so bad after all.

908798,4,6304561873,"It's strange how something labeled controversial more than ten years ago can become a cultural icon.  The Simpsons set the standard for prime-time animation.  Without it, it's doubtful that such shows like King of the Hill and South Park would exist today.
While the first season is dated (the animation is sketchy, the voices have yet to be finely honed), it's interesting to see how and where it all began.  I remember being banned from watching The Simpsons, and ""bootleg"" tapes were passed around in the schoolyard, allowing us to see the hilarity of the family.
Now, I am not a big fan of the early years.  The later episodes have spoiled me in that regard, and I'm happy to say that Lisa Simpson is no longer the annoying, pretentious fact-quoter/voice of reason that she is in the first season (okay,okay, she still is, but her character has much more depth and humor now).  However, it's great to view these first few episodes just to see how one of the longest running television shows began.
A word of warning:  The extras are not very spectacular.  The commentaries drag on, and there are many times where nothing is said at all.  And the ""bonus"" episode is just a crudely drawn version of one of the exact same episodes.  But, having said that, any extras are welcome, and it's great to see The Simpsons on DVD finally.

  The Simpsons first season DVD was not all that Fox said it would be.  First of all the quality of the shows were poor.  It felt as if you were watching a recorded vhs tape instead of a dvd.  It was not retouched at all, video or audio.  The menus were boring and slopily put together.  Throughout the whole menu it kept playing over and over the simpsons theme.  The easter eggs were boring and easy to find.  This disc DOES NOT CONTAIN all the Tracy Ullman Pilots that Fox promised.  It only contains one pilot episode which everyone has already seen.  there are more glitches and problems that im not gonig to list because I don't have the time.

  If you are the true Simpsons enthusiast, I would recommened you to get this, but not for the extras, but just to have.  I really do feel that Fox has... it's fans.  It's a 30 dollar DVD that has been put together like a 8 dollar DVD.  The True Simpsons' fans should complain, not for the price but for the poorly put together DVD.  This DVD is so bad that it doesn't even get the ""Krusty Seal of Approval""  Fox better think it over before they release their next few Simpson DVD sets.",1019001600,16,1385,4.290697674418604

These episodes are extraordinarily classic but not as hilarious as the later episodes.  So don't expect a joke every five seconds.

908904,5,6304561873,"I am amazed to see the dates of the reviews of the other readers. It seems like many of them commented on the advertised contents but didn't have the boxset to comment on it.
I am giving this boxset 5 stars, not because of the quality of the episodes (in my opinion the first season isn't the best, but that's subjective), but because I find that this is the first TV release that is priced according to what the boxset comes with.
There are three DVDs inside the box (small box, takes little shelf space). They are single sided. Region is 1. By the way, I compared this release to the one released in R2 and they are very similar (this is not always the case, if you were laughing already).
Video and audio quality are nice (not perfect, though).
A 8 page booklet is included in the box. It just lists the episode names, the chapters, and give a small synopsis.
The included episodes are: Simpsons Roasting On An Open Fire, Bart the Genious, Homer's Odyssey, There's No Disgrade Like Home, Bart the General, Moaning Lisa, Call of the Simpsons, The Telltale Head, Life on the Fast Lane, Homer's Night Out, The Crepes of Wrath, Krusty Gets Busted, Some Enchanted Evening.
The episodes are 4:3 (full frame). Audio is English 5.1 Dolby Digital, English Dolby Surround, French Dolby Surround. Subtitles: English and Spanish.
There's some commentary by Matt Groening for all the eps. 4 of the eps come with the original scripts (not very interesting). There is some previously unaired footage, but I don't value this much. Usually the reason for footage not being aired is that is wasn't good enough.
I miss the rest of the Tracy Ullman shorts, I guess they are saving them for the rest of DVDs, but since they were done and aired before season 1, they should have included them in this boxset.",1018051200,3,1789,4.59375

The quality is great, the extra features are extensive and interesting, and you get all the original first season episodes with beefed Dolby Digital 5.1 sound. This set is great for even a casual fan in my opinion. Although the first season isn't the best, it is still damn funny. The satire is still great. And if your concerned about the animation, don't worry. It really isn't all that bad, just not as good as newer seasons. Please people, give Matt Groening a break, him and his staff had no clue on how to make an animated show when they first started. Anyways, extra features include original epsidoe scripts, audio commentary on EVERY EPISODE, character design drawings, additional commentary by the producers on things like character production, deleted scenes, foreign language clips, a look into the making of The Simpsons, a BBC special on The Simpsons mania, clips from The Simpsons on the Tracy Ullman Show, audio outtakes, and Spanish subtitles (plus French Dolby). So you can see this set is backed with extra features. Plus, it includes a pamphlet of the episodes that give you a breif description of the episode, the date when it was first aired, and notes (like if new characters are introduced in the episode, for instance). The quality of the box it comes in is great, too. It is made out of sturdy thick cardboard plus it comes with a sleeve that protects the folded insides of the set where the DVDs and the pamphlet is held. Also, the art is pretty funny with a bunch of different continuing scenes on the case (for example, each DVD has art of a scene with a Simpsons character, and when you life up the DVD from the case, there is a continuation of the scene on it form the one on the DVD). I've heard people complaining about how the set is on three discs, but I don't even see how you can fit everything on one with all the extras. It isn't a big deal at all.

Aside from that minor gripe, this is a great collection for the serious Simpsons fan!  The entire first season is included here in their entirety (no commercials!!) with some fascinating background material such as scripts.  I like the running commentary for each episode by the creators of the show which helps to give you an insight as to how some of the episodes came to be and also to visually see how the characters and overall design philosophy evolved.  The quality of the video and sound is excellent...easily better VHS.  It's great to finally be able to figure out exactly how the episodes debuted (interestingly enough, the first episode ever of the Simpsons debuted in December 1989 and was a Christmas special).

The animation was questionable (at this time done by the people behind the Rugrats, rather than an in-house studio), the voices were off, and various locations kept shifting appearance (note the bottom windows of the Simpson house). Still, this was back went the show was a social satire first and foremost... the plots still revolved around basic family exercises. The first season features dealing with bullies, going camping, celebrating Christmas, marriage problems, and so on. The Simpsons tackles each with it's wacky and bizzare flair... working perfectly without awkward guest appearances, bizzare and arbitrary character additions, or inexplicable pop culture references.
Each of the 13 original episodes is presented here in it's original aspect ratio of 1.33:1. The audio has been remixed to Dolby Digital 5.1, fleshing out the original stereo audio across the soundfield. A French 2.0 track is provided for each episode, as are Spanish subtitles. Each episode features scene-specific audio commentary with a variety of the original creative team, including Matt Groening and James L. Brooks, the creators.
Disc Three features all the remaining special features... my favorite being an early animation test for the first episode produced, ""Some Enchanted Evening"" - one of the commentators... producer James L. Brooks, I believe, is so disgusted he literallly take off his headphones and leaves the recording booth. Hilarious stuff.

These definitely aren't the best episodes of the series (in fact, up until last season, they probably could have been considered the worst), but the point of this set is to allow people to see the beginnings of one of the best series on television.
The problem is that your casual Simpsons fans might not be as entertained by this as the true hardcore fans.  The animation is crude, the plots are (gulp) normal, Homer's actually semi-intelligent, and the jokes are only mildly amusing.

909001,5,6304561873,"All of us Simpsons fans have been eagerly awaiting the release of DVD episodes.  They only released the first season, which are not up to par to later seasons, but it's terrific anyway.  As other reviewers have noted here, the pacing of the first season episodes were a bit slack at times.  The episodes are not packed with as many jokes as shows from subsequent seasons.  Nevertheless, many of the episodes are classics.  I particularly love ""Life on the Fast Lane,"" which features Albert Brooks as a French bowling instructor who tries to seduce Marge.
The commentary tracks for each episode are fantastic.  Different episodes feature a combination of Matt Groening, James L. Brooks, and various writers and directors.  They have a remarkable memory and give great insight into stylistic and writing choices that were made.  They all spend quite a bit of time remarking how crudely drawn the episodes are, but I was surprised by how early in the first season the episodes hit their stride.
Within the first six episodes, we are introduced to the main bulk of supporting characters that have continued to provide laughs through the years (e.g., Barney, Apu, Moe, Patty & Selma, Grandpa).  Yes, some things have changed.  Homer's voice was a little different, and he was less stupid back then.  Barney was blonde, and Moe and Milhouse had black hair.  But seeing the changes are really fun.  One of the best parts is the unaired footage from ""Some Enhcnated Evening"" (which was the first episode made, but the last one aired that season).  The commentary track relates how awful everyone thought this initial episode was and that they had to re-do most of it.
I truly think that any Simpsons fan will love this collection.  I am also eagerly awaiting the release of future season.  Highly recommended.",1014768000,2,1801,4.875
909057,4,6304561873,"Don't get me wrong. I bought the DVD set, and I'm glad to have it. But that doesn't change the fact that these are some of the weakest ""Simpsons"" episodes ever made.
Of course, it's important to remember two things:
- Even a bad ""Simpsons' episode is better than the best episode of, say, ""The Family Guy.""
- It's easy to diss ""The Simpsons""' season 1 in hindsight, having seen the great things that were to come. On its own, season 1's not bad at all.
Of the episodes on this disk, my favorites are ""Bart the Genius,"" ""Bart the General,"" and ""Moaning Lisa."" Other than audio commentary by Matt Groening and others involved in the production of ""The Simpsons,"" the special features aren't particularly exciting. The purported ""unaired episode"" is just an unaired version of ""Some Enchanted Evening"" (the one with the Babysitter Bandit).
I'm still giving this DVD 4 stars. Why? As a sign of things to come -- I'm *really* looking forward to the Seasons 2-10 DVDs -- and because it's nice to have the episodes available uncut after so many years of watching them in syndication.",1014681600,,1076,4.668421052631579

Still, if you're a rabid Simpsons fan like myself, you owe it to yourself to buy this collection, if nothing else for the commentary.

There are some pretty cool extras included as well such as original scripts, voice outtakes from Albert Brooks, and a brief documentary.
Included also is an old Simpsons snippet from The Tracey Ullman show in the late 80's.  I was a bit disappointed that they included only one, but perhaps more will be included in future releases......hopefully.
I remember back in 1990, I saw a special FOX aired showing how a show was put together from start to finish, including the voice actors in the studio, and even the orchestra which plays the music for the show.  I sincerely hope they include this on a future DVD set, because it gives people insight as to how a single Simpsons episode is created.

So everyone ends up thinking that Bart's IQ rivals that of Einstien, and Bart ends up in a special school for gifted children.  It's just a great classic episode!
It's intersting to watch the older episodes and note some of the differences between the old episodes and the new ones.  For instance, a couple of characters have different colored hair.  Also, in the Santa's Little Helper one, Ned Flanders decks his house out with over the top Christmas lights.  I couldn't help but think that the super religous Flanders would never have a Santa on his roof or abreviate Christmas as Xmas.

909464,4,6304561873,"After spending the past 12 years of my life as a die-hard Simpsons fanatic, there was little I could do to resist this DVD package. This release provides all the episodes of the first season, which was actually a partial season of 13 episodes. This is the first of the projected series that will collect for us every season of the Simpsons' run, and I hope they come out fast. I agree with most fanatics that the show was still warming up during the first season (the show was truly invincible in seasons 3-7), as the animation was crude, and the voice actors were still developing their characters. This is especially true of Nancy Cartwright as Bart and Dan Castelleneta as Homer, as they were both still nailing down the nuances and subtleties of the two Simpson men. But the story lines in the first season were already stellar and fully developed, and were instantly more subversive and intelligent than any other show on TV.
But there are a few disappointing aspects of this package. There seems to have been some confusion over whether the Tracey Ullman shorts would be included - they're not, even though there's room for them. The ""extras"" are not really worth the effort, consisting only of some non-breathtaking outtakes, short clips in foreign languages, and a so-called documentary on the making of the show that is merely a snippet from a British newsmagazine. These extras seem like they're only there because a producer decided that you're supposed to include a ""bonus"" on a DVD. And this package certainly does not need to be on three discs. What's here could fit on two discs easily. So when the rest of this series starts to come out, they can probably dispense with the extras.

I have spent many a sunday growing up with the disfunctional family and enjoyed every episode. When they came out on video I was happy but they wouldn't include the complete seasons! Only snipets of each season which the company thought out shined the rest. Now finally you can own the complete first season including the very first christmas special, once only available on video tape. I like the added stuff that shows how they made some of the episodes. I hope when the get around to releasing season 2 that they include more tracy ulmen show episodes.

I think there should be a method whereby I could make one episode play followed hard upon by the next without going back to the menus so it can play in one stream like the many videotapes of the simpsons that I've made... maybe I could learn to program my dvd player to do so for me but let's face it... most people are just as lazy and or stupid as homer simpson and can't be bothered.
Lastly... why three disc for just 13 episodes (or as I've loosely calculated 280 minutes or almost 4 hours 40 minutes). There's no way of convincing me that one of these discs could not have been eliminated.

The set is very well put together, from the packaging down to the content. I would have liked more bonus features, but what's there is nice (including some scripts and one of the original Simpsons shorts from The Tracy Ullman Show). The picture and sound quality, by the way, is excellent.

I found I didn't mind this much, though. Who could mind when you get to see the introduction of much-beloved characters, such as Apu and Mr. Smithers?
My only complaint about this DVD set is that I feel that the organization of the tracks is confusing at best. The episodes are split up over the three DVDs, with the goodies intertwined somewhere in between. So, you have to jump from DVD to DVD to see the episodes at times.

909471,2,6304561873,"""The Simpsons"" came to FOX television when I was 26, I am now 93 and the show is still on the air, and the kids seem to be timeless.  Marge has not aged a bit, and Homer is as bald and fat as ever.
I loved ""The Simpsons"" into the first few seasons, but now I am just over exposed, over tired and over done with this show.
Maybe once ""The Simpsons"" goes off the air and stays off for about a decade I will appreciate this show once again for what it was.
But now in its 11th season on FOX, and syndicated on every channel at every time, every day of the week, all I can say is
AY CARUMBA! get this show OFF THE AIR ALREADY.
""The Simpsons"" fanatics are going to hate me for this, but I am sorry this show needs a rest, a long one.  Sometimes when you don't have something for awhile you appreciate again.
What is sad is that after 11 years on FOX, this is still one of FOXs highest rated shows.  Television has gone so far, yet new stylish shows like ABCs ""Alias"" fail to make headway.
Due to the fact that Americas diminishing attention span and taste for more developed plots is beyond the Dorito eating couch potato public.
I say cancel ""The Simpsons"" and start a spin-off of something fresh like ""The Itchy & Scratchy Show"".",1007856000,2,1226,4.142857142857143
909472,5,6304561873,"It all started when I was 10 years old.  My mom put a tv in my room for the first time and I remember my sister would watch Tracy Ulman late at night.  One night a grainy, rude, poorly animated short came on and I was hooked!  This cartoon was so crappy and awkward I couldn't stop watching!  I loved the characters!  They were just like people I knew!
""15"" years later I am still a fanatic.  I have watched since it began and I still watch them.  I have gotten rid of my Burger King collectibles and dolls, I finished Virtual Simpson, and I have upgraded to the greatest toy of all time, DVD! This DVD is incredible.  The whole first season is here and all the classic lines! ""Kwyjibo"", ""The proper way to spell weiner..."", Grandpa's rant about ""Family Jewels"", ""Dip Sign Ahead"", ""Maybe he vanished into FAT air"", and all the repeditive stuff we here every week.  Barneys hair was blonde, Milhouse's wasn't blue and the same towns people seemed to show up constantly.
Looking back at these episodes I must admit, I CANT BELIEVE ITS LASTED THIS LONG!  The animation looks terrible!  The voices are like japanese fight movies! But the storys are GREAT!  I cant wait till the other 9 thousand episodes come out on DVD! (at this rate it will take another decade!)

Heh, that is just cool. There are plenty of bonus features, including Japanese, Spanish and other language playback of the shows. Which is always a plus. And it is really funny seeing Bart saying something in Japanese. Plus, I think, all of the Tracey Allman original shorts, which was really cool seeing.
People complain and complain about mosqito sound and quailty. I say, oh well. We are lucky that we are getting this at all as both fans of the show and consumers.

When placed together, I realize this isn't the best Simpsons season by a long shot (the pacing is slower, not enough bash-em-out culture jokes). My only real complaint is Groening didn't include all of the 'Tracy Ullman' shorts (but they're so weak, who even cares anyhow...) More importantly, the Historian in me wants to know how they cast those immortal voices for the Simpson characters, no information in this set. Fine by me - the characters speak for themselves.

909557,5,6304561873,"Just recently got this, and it is fantastic.
Why do I love this DVD set?
#1 Is price. Compare the price for a 3 DVD set, containing the entire, un-cut, un-edited first season of the Simpsons! With the price for the special VHS releases they did awhile back, such as the ""Political Simpsons Set,"" and the ""Halloween Simpsons Set,"" and you will see which is the better deal (even now).
#2 DVD quality.  ( I have no idea what the other reviewers are talking about - I have a high definition TV, and I am using component video cables, and it looks crystal clear to me.)  If you tape the Simpsons every week like I do, or you buy the few VHS releases they have put out, and compare these VHS versions to DVD you will see quite obviously the difference in quality of both video and sound (my DVD player is using s-video so that may be why my video is so much better). It is even more fun if you have your DVD player hooked up into a good sound system, surround sound Simpsons is INCREDIBLE! Then there is the fact that with DVD's you don't ever have to rewind anything ever again, and you can pause the action and slow-step through it, and actually SEE what is on the screen.
#3 All 13 episodes of the first season:
1. ""Simpsons Roasting on an open fire""
2. ""Bart the genius""
3. ""Homer's Odyssey""
4. ""There's no Disgrace like home""
5. ""Bart the General""
6. ""Moaning Lisa""
7. ""Call of the Simpsons""
8. ""The Telltale Head""
9. ""Life on the Fast Lane""
10. ""Homer's Night Out""
11. ""The Crepes of Wrath""
12. ""Krusty Gets Busted""
13. ""Some Enchanted Evening""
#4 BONUS MATERIAL!
In contrast to VHS special features which invariably have to be tacked onto the end of a VHS tape, and only if the movie isn't that long - DVD special features can be numerous, and you can jump right to them if you like. As more and more seasons are released on DVD I imagine that the special features will be getting even more interesting as the cast and crew digs up their notes, cut-scenes and other goodies. But here is what was included on this set:
DISK ONE:
a.) ""Bart the Genius"" script.
b.) ""Bart the General"" script.
c.) ""Moaning Lisa"" script.
d.) All episodes are available in the English language or French with only spoken language, or subtitles as well. Plus a sound selection of 5.1 Surround, or Dolby Surround.
*The scripts are cool because they are scanned into the DVD format and you can step-through them and see the original script for an episode, including stage and voice actor-type directions, and you can see things that were crossed out, and replaced, or things that were highlighted or emphasized. It is something that you have to be a Simpsons fan to love*
DISK TWO:
a.) All episodes are available in the English language or French with only spoken language, or subtitles as well. Plus a sound selection of 5.1 Surround, or Dolby Surround.
DISK THREE:
a.) Never before seen outtakes. *The outtakes are from an unaired version of ""Some Enchanted Evening,"" and they really aren't anything all that spectacular, just the Simpsons being goofier and more ""cartoon-like"" than they normally are. But the bonus here is there is the option of watching the outtakes with commentary from Matt Groeing, James L. Brooks, David Silverman and Al Jean.*
b.) Animatic from ""Bart the General."" *This is sort of an ""evolution of a scene"" type thing, where you see a scene go from idea, to rough sketch to final version, it also has commentary by Matt Groeing and David Silverman.*
c.) The Making of the Simpsons, ""America's First Family"". *Sort of a ""behind the scenes"" look into how the Simpsons got started, with a narration from some female narrator. Matt Groeing, tells the origins of how he got the Simpsons started - bumpers between the acts of the Tracey Ullman Show.
d.) Foreign language clips. *These are just the same short clip of a scene but available in French, Italian, Spanish, Japanese and Portuguese. Useful if you are studying a foreign language and you want to try out your listening/comprehension skills. Or if you are curious as to what they Simpsons sound like in different countries.*
e.) Tracey Ullman Short: ""Good Night Simpsons."" *This is just one of the many Tracey Ullman bumpers that they made, I was actually disappointed that they only included one of them on this set. But oh well - maybe the next set.*
f.) Albert Brooks Audio Outtakes. *Albert Brooks did the voice for the romantic bowler Marge almost had an affair with. In this special feature they show clips of the show, and Albert Brooks goofing around with his lines, amusing, but not hysterical.
g.) The art of the Simpsons. *Shows the creation and design of many of the Simpsons characters, and other interesting tidbits.*
h.) ""Some Enchanted Evening"" script.
i.) All episodes are available in the English language or French with only spoken language, or subtitles as well. Plus a sound selection of 5.1 Surround, or Dolby Surround.
Well there is my review. I hope it has been helpful for those of you who read reviews to see if you should buy something. The only complaint I have about this DVD set is the packaging could have been a helluva lot sturdier. The DVD trays are in a 4-part fold out style, and the covers are done in thin cardboard-like paper. Although I must say that at least they chose a DVD tray that holds the DVDs in place while storing them, but allows you to remove them without any kung-fu knowledge. Plastic casing would have been better, or at least sturdier cardboard, but hey that is small potatoes compared to what you get. And the art of the DVDs and the case is very well done.",1006560000,2,5570,4.585757271815447
909558,3,6304561873,"If you like Simpsons and feel you HAVE to have them in your collection, then go ahead and get it. But if you are interested in extras or supplementary material - this DVD is pretty useless. The most surprising to me was how bland and boring are commentary of the creators of the Simpsons: they obviously do not know what to say, it all just chit-chat between 3 of them with very little substance. I do not think there is a single extra on this DVD that make it worth buying, unless, of course, you are interested to read original scripts on your TVs screens.",1006560000,3,558,4.3238095238095235

The writing is there, however, and its fun seeing how the characters have evolved/grown over time. And hey, these are the classic episodes!

909562,5,6304561873,"I am an animation lover and I always snap up the 'definitive collector's editions'. Naturally, I'm delighted that the Simpsons will be joining my DVD rack soon and I can retire my worn old tapes. This is a very good start to a great cartoon dynasty here.
 Great things about these DVDs: Complete-and-uncut, crisp, digital-sound episodes.
Consider-for-future-DVDs things: More production art (the character sketches could have been a little better chosen). A studio tour would be great, perhaps a section with Alf Clausen on the music of the show, tighter proofing of the audio commentaries (there's a lot of repetition and, while the spontaneity of Groening/Silverman et al. is great, it needs to be more tightly planned and with a touch more professionalism. Lasseter and the gang at Pixar do it perfectly.). More about the show's history - like the technical and artistic transition from Ullman show to primetime. And finally, a feature to just run all the episodes back-to-back would be great (rather than have to go through menues to play each one).
As said, it's a very good start. I would suggest to Fox that they study the DVDs Disney puts out. They have collector's DVDs down to a fine art. Some fans are happy to just have the episodes, but an equal number want to bask in the genius BEHIND the show too. Fox HAS the material there, it's time to show it off!",1006041600,3,1367,4.767932489451477
909563,5,6304561873,"The Simpsons have earned a spot in American television history as one of the best cartoon series of all time.  Who among us is not familair with Homer, Bart, Lisa, Marge and Maggie Simpson?  Or catch phrases such as ""Don't have a cow, man"", ""Eat my shorts"", and ""D'oh!""  They are perhaps the most dysfunction fictional family on television; yet, they are more of a family unit than the Bundy's from ""Married With Children"", and certainly more endearing, and easier to love.
""The Simpsons"", of course, were born on The Tracy Ullmann Show, as mere short sketches.  They were crude drawings, harkening the stone age of their humble beginnings; their bodies etched and drawn as though they preceeded the age of ""The Flinstones""; their voices were deeper, more scratchy; their movements less than dynamic.
For anyone who has not seen these sketches, or are less familair with episodes from the first year of ""The Simpsons""; who only grew up watching episodes from the later years, when the Simpson family looked more defined, more molded into what we are used to seeing a cartoon character look like, it may be difficult for them to watch the earlier programs.
But for those of use who love ""The Simpsons"", no matter their appearance, ""The Simpsons - The Complete First Season"" will most definitively appease our raging appetites.  They are still crudely drawn; they still have less than dynamic motions, and they still possess the deep and scratchy voices.  And yet, all that is overshadowed due to the brilliant writing behind the scenes.  The simple fact is - ""The Simpsons"" is genuinely hilarious.  They give us an ample supply of events to laught at, as did ""Married With Children"".  The difference is that ""The Simpsons"" possess more heart than the Bundy family ever could.  We are not merely laughing at the Simpson family, and mocking their livelihoods; and we do not consider them to deserve all the bad things that happen to them, as we do with the Bundy's.
The first year of ""The Simpsons"" includes such classic episodes as ""Simpsons Roasting On An Open fire"".  A Christmas episode where Homer tries his hand at being a shopping mall Santa Claus so he can earn enough money to buy his family presents.  When he recieves his pay check, and finds out the cost of his suit and the Santa classes, have been deducted, leaving him with about eleven dollars, he is in despair, and ends up at a race track for hounds, hoping to win the money he needs to buy the gifts.  This episode also introduces the Simpson family dog, Santa's Little Helper.
A Second episode is ""Crepes of Wrath"".  Bart becomes an exchange student.  He goes to live with a family in France, which turns out to be two bad men making illegal liquor.  They abuse him to no end, until he is able to escape and, having learned some French, finds a local policeman and tells him about the men.  Bart is an instance hero.
A third episode is ""Krusty Gets Busted"".  All loyal Simpson fans are familair with Sideshow Bob, and his hatred of Bart, and his schemes to kill him.  This is the episode which started it all.  Krusty is framed for robbery, and it is up to Bart, his last remaining loyal fan, to find the real robber.
""The Simpsons"" owes much of its early success to great writing.  And though the writing of today's episodes are still funny, and worth watching and laughing at, the first season of ""The Simpsons"", is perhaps their finest season of all.",1006041600,2,3420,4.666666666666667

1)No animated menus. Just a dull boring pic of one of the family members played to the Simpsons theme over and over again. Even the worst DVD's at least have THAT feature.
2)Clumsy way of toggling through features and episodes. No way to play through all of them one after another.
3)VERY VERY VERY little features or fun things to see. The Easter Eggs are a bore when u find them in two minutes, and the featurette is only a mere 15 minutes from a 90 minute special.
4) The commentarys are great but theirs alot of complaining about the lack of resources and trying to explain its low budget looks.
The episodes themselves are still great, and look wonderful on DVD. The colors are bright and the sound is top notch.
But they could have done BETTER. I see so many here, so satisfide but Fox can do much better then this dribble. The other seasons, we should demand better! When X-Files fans get better, were being jipped big time.

You get to see Barts first impressions of rebellion, Homer not quite the brainless lovable slob we know him to be, yet they are still the same characters, just not developed yet. It is truly fascinating to watch. The animation is servicable while not entirely clean-cut, but that doesn't matter.

The fact that these episodes are on DVD is a treat in itself, I bought this collection simply because of the Simpsons episodes (duh!) but the special features that come with the DVD's are also great.
I'm very happy with this special edition, it is one of my favourites. I cannot wait for the next series to be released!",1004659200,,747,4.304964539007092
909764,4,6304561873,"First of all, this is an invaluable DVD for any die-hard ""Simpsons"" fan. Just to have such brilliance on DVD is well worth any downsides.
Now, that having been said, the DVD is sorely lacking in bonus material and the commentaries give no real insight other than how long it's been since Groening has seen a particular episode or how little the writers really care about some of the seminal points in ""Simpsons"" genealogy.
And yes, .... is lying about the existance of an un-aired episode. It's not an entire episode, nor is it un-aired footage. It's basically a scratch-track, a rough version of the same stuff that appears in the ""aired"" episode.
Don't get me wrong, I love having ""Simpsons"" on DVD, and I'm sure that when subsequent seasons become available, I will buy each and every one of them (it will, at the very least, free up a lot of room in my video collection!)....
I just hope that future DVDs will have more bonus material (what about all the other Ullman shorts???)  and more insightful commentaries.",1004659200,,1017,4.681564245810056
909765,5,6304561873,"This set is a must-have for those who appreciate the greatest TV show in history. It's fun to watch all of the first season episodes back to back. Everything was so fresh and new. The character's weren't fully developed (naturally) and that's what's so great about analyzing them. Yet at the same time it's also sad watching these episodes comparing them to the recent years. The Simpsons have been going down-hill ever since the ""Who Shot Mr. Burns?"" fiasco. That's what happens when a show doesn't accept outside scripts. What a shame they couldn't keep up this level of greatness! Maybe they just spoiled us too soon with seasons 1-4. There are many hilarious moments and memorable scenes. I especially love the one where Bart cuts of the head of Jebediah. That was the episode that pulled me in all those years ago when I was once skeptical of the show being as good as the hype. I was stunned to discover it was better that the hype and has replaced the Flintstones as being my all-time favorite animated show. (Notice I didn't say cartoon.) Also the video boxing match between Homer and Bart leaves me in stitches every time. This great collection celebrates the golden years and unless they bring back their original writers or find some hungary new ones, we will have to remember them for these episodes. It's fun to see all of the extras that are included and the price was right. Also, check out Nancy Cartwright's book ""My Life as a Ten Year Old Boy"". It's a very interesting look at the show from someone who was there from the beginning (as the voice of Bart.) I'm keeping my fingers crossed that they release the next few seasons too.

909766,5,6304561873,"Animated notwithstanding, ""The Simpsons"" was one of my first peeks into prime-time television.  Back in 1990, just the idea of having an animated, dysfunctional family on regular TV was next to impossible to understand.  Knowing where the show has gone (and still is going), rewatching these episodes was quite a trip for me. The DVD set itself is satisfactory enough, with commentary by creator Matt Groening, producer James Brooks (a solid film director in his own right), and many other writers and directors who conspired to put together a series that almost fell apart before it even got on the air (hear the commentary for the last episode in the set for that whopper of a story).  It also includes some early animation tests (the commentary for this is funny), some audio outtakes from guest star Albert Brooks (a master of improvisation, and not among his last trip to Springfield), and some early designs and sketches.  Despite the many changes that have occured to the show since then, this is a definite must-buy for fans of the show, and an interesting marker to what was the beginning of a great show.",1004486400,3,1114,4.816753926701571

The animation is a lot more crude. The character voices and looks are evolving (Mr. Smithers was black at one point). The opening had yet to be perfected. But the heart was there, and only got better. Plus some great bonuses including original Tracy Ullman show shorts - let's hope there are more on future editions.
Plus it's nice to see the shows in their entirity - so often a minute here an minute there is cut for synidcation. Now we can get the pristine humor all the way. Is it perfect? No. Is it fun? Hell yea. Let's hope it's the start of a long wonderful series of DVD's.

It is incredible to see how much the stories, characters, and writers have developed since the very early years.  And the best thing is, they are still churning out new episodes to this day.

This complete first season DVD set has excellent audio and video quality; not perfect, but quite good considering their production values. This is probably the best they are ever going to look.
The audio commentaries, the best of the medium-sized supplement selection, are entertainingly self-mocking, though the participants sometimes forget about things. For 13 episodes and a reasonable selection of supplements, this is quite a good value for the price.",1004227200,,694,5.376146788990826
909770,5,6304561873,"The first season was my favorite season of ""The Simpsons"". It set the grounds that the show delt with every character and made sure you knew them in just 13 episodes. This season made you feel several emotions; from darker to lighter storylines. Every character had their episode with them in the spotlight. Not saying that the newer episodes aren't good, their great, but I think I like the atmosphere better in this season. ""Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire"" is my favorite. It was one of the more heartwarming episodes. ""Moaning Lisa"" makes me sad (I cried when Bleeding Gums Murphy died"". I'm on the edge of my seat when watching ""Some Enchanted Evening"", and ""Call of the Simpsons"" is hilarious. The DVD doesn't have very long special features though, however, there's a lot of them which makes up for it.

It is absolutely the funniest show you'll find on TV that's not just in reruns. However, I say this about most of the series, but not so much emphasis is put on this first season. Yes, you do get to see an interesting development of the show, but the first season, to me, seemed a little out of place. I realize that it's only the first season, but the stories and dialogue seem so out of place. The writers miss plenty of potential gags by making Homer just an average father instead of a completely clueless dope (when HE was recommending the family change its ways and MARGE was getting drunk, I almost cried). Many familiar characters that I love are missing, and I see few jokes that are completely hilarious surprises. That said, Bart is still a maniacal menace, and Lisa is just the same, and the jokes we do get are better than some of the most recent episodes (such as a sentimental Ned Flanders amusement park tale).

Matt Groening's depraved, desperately sane and almost human creations are featured in 13 episodes.  The somewhat rough animation and the evolving character designs are a little removed from the smoother style of later episodes.  Groening's (and other producers') commentary is engaging.
There's a never before seen version of ""Some Enchanted Evening"" episode and Albert Brooks's hilarious audio outtakes from ""Life on the Fast Lane."" You can also hear Homer speak French and other dubbed languages.  Weird and wonderful all the way.",1003190400,2,715,5.4818181818181815
910001,3,6304561873,"There is an overwhelming good to this DVD set that outweighs the one complaint.  So to amend the stars you see above.  Having the Simpsons First Season on DVD is five stars.  The extras are one star.  The DVD quality (picutre/sound/etc) is about three stars.  That makes the set worth about three stars.
These are some funny Simpsons episodes.  What really sets The Simpsons apart from many long lived series is how close to the mark those first episodes came to the refined product a decade later.
It's hard to believe that even in the first, abbreviated season, you'd find episodes that are classics.  I won't review the episodes themselves.  If you like The Simpsons, you will enjoy these episodes.  If you are a Simpsons nut, you will not be able to live without them.
What I will review here are the extras.  This is for the discriminating buyer that buys DVDs to learn more about their favorite movies and shows.
You won't learn much.
There is a somewhat informative, if short, 'documentary' of sorts on how the first season came to be on the 'extras' disc (Disc 3).  That really turned out to be the best extra.
The running commentary for each episode turns out to be extremely lacking.  Of all the DVDs I own, this quite possibly might be the worst commentary.  Each episode's commentary is provided by a mix of people.  Sometimes you'll hear from the episode's director, writer, or Matt Groening himself.  But it always seems to be two or three people.
In any case, episode after episode, you'll find that the ""commenters"" are too busy watching the show to tell you anything useful about it.
There are long silences followed by bursts of laughter when punchlines are delivered on screen.  It's almost as if they're simply gathering to watch these episodes for the first time in many years.  There are small nuggets of information, but it is hard to sift through the silence and laughter to find them.  When you expect to hear the inspiration for a joke or character, you only hear them chuckling.
This isn't really a knock on the talented people who produced the show, but more on the people who produced the DVD.  Perhaps they needed a way to let the commenters know that viewers would want ""behind-the-scenes"" insight.
Even the ""unaired outtake"" requires some induction to figure out what is going on.  The ""commenters"" groan over the poor quality of this unaired material.  However, they don't spend any time at all telling us what went wrong, who did it, and how they worked around it to produce what finally went to air.  Instead we hear more silence, more groaning, and more exclamation (limited to a few words or less) about how bad it is.
If you just want the Simpsons classics to watch again, get this without delay.  Don't even think about the extras, they are nonexistent.",1003190400,3,2792,4.687885010266941

The DVD features, overall, are horrible.  It's a pain to navigate, and the reason it's a pain isn't because it's filled with menu-animation or something, which at least would have been interesting.  It's just poorly organized.
Plus, (and if this is my oversight, someone help me out here) there's no way to tell which episodes are on which disk unless you memorize them.  I have to load a disk, get to the menu, then find out if the ep I want is on that disk or not.  Around episode 7, 8, 9, I forget where disk 1 ends and disk 2 begins.  Is there something on the box?  The disks themselves?  Did I get a misprinted disk?

I've only become a serious Simpsons fan in the past few years so there was still a lot that I'd missed in the history of the characters and the storyline in general. Seeing the entire first season helped to put that all into perspective. What struck me most about this was how different the show is now compared to the original season. It took a couple of seasons for the true colors of each of the characters to finally show through. For instance, the original Homer seems much more prone to lashing out in an almost violent way whereas he is now much more likely to show dopey frustration. Also, small things struck me like Cheif Wiggums has black hair in the first season whereas he now has blue hair.

It was in California that I got my first full taste of the Simpsons, and from then on, it was one of those shows that almost all of my family sat down and watched.  My mom didn't mind what Bart said, and my entire family got a huge kick out of the early episodes, which brought back many memories from 10 years ago.
  The box set comes in probably one of the funniest slip-case sets I've seen.  Inside the case, there is a short introduction by creator Matt Groening, as well as a funny whirling image of the characters being tossed around the DVDs and such.  Every single first season episode is here, as Homer tries to save Christmas, Bart cheats on a test and faces surprising consequences, Lisa has a bad case of ""the Blues,"" and much much more.  I would ramble on and on but that would spoil most of the episodes.
  One could even complain about the quality of animation in these (several of these episodes look like the characters turned to jelly, and theres a rather strange moment where in one episode Mr. Smither' skin is an orange color with dark-grey hair, and 1-2 episodes later he's the Smithers we know today!).
  The first two discs contain 6 episodes apiece with commentary tracks for each episode, as well as several scripts.  It's surprising to read the scripts (if you can past all the rampant pencil-doodling on the pages :D ) , and find out how much got changed to the final product.
  The thrid disc is the extras disc, and contains episode #13, which has a rather startling revelation on the 3rd disc, as the producers and directors sit down and groan in pain and horror at the atrocity of animation that almost became Episode #13 (this atrocity can be found in the extras section, Episode 13 plays as it did when it premiered, in beautiful animated glory).  When you see it, it will make you glad that they decided to redo it ASAP.  There are also character sketches (though not enough), a making of Simpsons Documentary (which was made about 10 years ago), and an episode from the Tracy Ullman show, this is the Simpsons' first appearance.  The box-set loses one star for this, because I had hoped the DVD set would contain ALL the Tracy Ullman shorts, as I had seen several on reruns but not all of them.  There is also a cool 7 langauge, 60 second clip of the Simpsons in different languages (I urge you to listen to them in Japanese, it's the best!)  And as  a little sidenote, there is a hidden ""Easter Egg"" on the third disc, but I'll leave that for you to find out.
  Hopefully this will be enough to get you to purchase this set.  Personally, I'm even more excited for Season 2, but Fox has not set a release date yet.",1002499200,,2802,4.387596899224806

It is well worth seeing these episodes if you are used to only grainy VHS tapes.
The extras are also a good touch. The scripts may interest the hard core fans. The early ""roughs"" and first attempt at an animated draft were wonderfully BAD! Matt Groening and others acknowledge in their commentary on how awful the first run was. Getting animation right is hard. It takes a lot of people who must really care about the project. Recently at the Festival of Cartoon Art in Columbus, Ohio, Lynn Johnston who creates ""For Better and Worse"" and Rick Kirkman who co-creates ""Baby Blues"" lamented on how badly their strips were treated by animators. It boiled down to one point: the animators have to really care about the characters and the show. Luckily for us, the producers of the Simpsons do care, and it shows!

Each episode has been transferred as well as a ten-plus-year old television source could be, and each episode has been accompanied by a commentary track.

910277,5,6304561873,"""The Simpsons- The Complete First Season"" is a must-own for Simpsonsmaniacs (including me, of course). It's a 3-dvd set of the first 13 episodes, plus plenty of delicious extras- it's the sizzle AND the steak.  Mmm... steak...

Sure, the animation is a bit crude compared to today's Simpsons, and the voices aren't quite there. But this is where the legend began, and recalls a magical time for those of us who were there when this bizarre family first dazzled us. You get the classic premiere episode, where Homer finds his shopping mall Santa job isn't what he'd hoped, the earliest incarnation of Smithers (he was black... sort of), Lisa's first meeting with Bleeding Gums Murphy, and Bart's war with Nelson (which ends with a treaty-signing and snacks). 13 complete episodes, all cleaned up and super-snazzy for your viewing enjoyment.

Yarr, come for the freaks, but stay for the extras, which include animatics for several episodes, scripts, hilarious commentary from the series' creators (including Matt Groening and James L. Brooks) and grotesque, never-before-seen footage so horribly animated that one of the commentators actually walks out (I'll let you find out who)! That moment alone is almost worth the package price. This is a deluxe, well thought-out set, slickly packaged with plenty of hilarious little Simpson illustrations and full of promise for the next release. I can hardly wait, because the episodes only get better and better.

If you're a Simpsons fan, this is what you need. I mean, it's the entire first season! That alone would be thrilling, but when you factor in everything else, it easily supercedes the VHS collections. Oh man, you need this set immediately. Just writing about it makes me want to go watch them again.",1001980800,,1753,5.055363321799308
910278,5,6304561873,"At long last, the Simpson family on DVD!  No more commercials, no more hacked up episodes in syndication; it's a wonderful thing.  The thirteen episodes that comprise the first season collection have never looked or sounded better.  The color is spectacularly bright, which is all the more noticeable because these episodes were the ones that looked the most washed out on TV.  And hearing the Simpsons in 5.1 channel surround adds a whole new dimension to your viewing.
To my mind, though, the best thing about this collection is getting to see the entire episode, rather than what's left after it's re-edited for syndication.  I came across scenes and I had completely forgotten about, or that I had never seen at all, some of which had me laughing out loud.  It seems that much of the more oblique, dry humor was removed, and having it back makes these episodes even funnier.
The only downside to this collection is the extras.  I suppose if you are an animator, or are interested in the process of animation, you might find them interesting.  I found much of the archival material rather dull though, and the piece on the origins and history of the Simpsons was far too short.  The commentary on the episodes was frequently very funny, but it's unlikely you'll watch every episode all the way through, and then repeat the process with the commentary on.
Ultimately, the lack of features doesn't matter.  There could be nothing but the episodes as described above, and I would have gladly purchased the set.  For me, and I think for most people, it's all about being able to see the funniest show on television, whenever and wherever I want, with no annoying commercials.

While the animation is occasionally crude, and the characters themselves were still evolving somewhat, many of these episodes are still valid and extremely fun to watch after all these years.  It was particularly fun to watch greats like ""Bart the General"" and ""Krusty Gets Busted"" again, and the satire on video games in ""Moaning Lisa"" is still valid today (I know partially from being a gamer myself).  All of the episodes are surprisingly funny, even today, and it is great to see them as they originally aired, meaning that there are no syndication cuts to deal with, plus there are no commercials.  As if the episodes weren't enough, though, you get plenty of extras, most notably the audio commentaries from creator Matt Groening, as well as various writers and directors, that are present for each episode.  The commentaries are full of little known trivia and behind the scenes info, some of which will definetely shock even the most hardcore Simpsons fan.  There is also an animatic from one episode (which helps show off the animation process), audio outtakes from another episode by guest star Albert Brooks for another episode, early sketches and designs for various characters, the specific ""Life in Hell"" cartoon that prompted a Fox exec to phone Matt Groening, clips from the unaired version of ""Some Enchanted Evening"", complete scripts for four episodes (complete with more production sketches), the very first ""Tracy Ullman"" short, foreign clips, clips from a BBC behind the scenes special, and even a couple hidden features: magazine covers and an ABC special on the Bart Simpson t-shirt controversy of the early days.

As far as the episodes go, I really enjoy watching them, its a drastic change of pace as to the... fest that the last few simpsons seasons have become. Sure the drawing and voices weren't as good, and they may have not been as blatently funny as seasons 3-8 (even though there is a lot of subtle humor in season 1) but the plots are excelent, and that is what counts. I cant stand watching the new episodes because they pretty much took everything the simpsons were and threw it out the door, making homer a complete baffon, and having incredibly stupid plots, it just makes it hard to watch. Pointless, blatent cameos (unlike in the older seasons where guest voices would play a new simspsons character instead of themselves) that seem have been more of a consideration of the writers than the plot have pretty much ruined the last few years. Im not saying that season 1 is the best, because the middle seasons had a perfect blend of plot and humor, but its definatly a good season and in my opinion infantly better than most anything the last couple of seasons have been able to produce.",1001721600,,1469,4.404411764705882

Sure, any Simpsons fan will tell you that Season 1 is by far the worst of all the seasons, but the animators (like Matt Groening says in the liner notes) didn't know what the hell they were doing.  What they were doing was creating the longest running television show in history and undoubtedly the funniest piece of satire ever put on the tube.  The animation may be crude, the voices of the characters screwed up, and the focus of the episodes around Bart but every show has got to start somewhere.  Groening's decision to feature and  stupify Homer in ever subsequent season was the catalyst for the Simpsons historic run.  What amazes me even more than the DVD's is their price....

910362,5,6304561873,"Ah, the relief.  How long have we all waited for this moment?  And Fox and the Simpsons production team really delivered the goods on this one.
First off: technically, they did great work.  The 5.1 sound, even in the rudimentary first few episodes, is crisp and well-remixed.  And those used to seeing the older shows in syndication will be amazed by the clarity of the transfer.  I've been astonished by the richness of the color.  I think the tv reruns became rather bleached over time, because the visual quality really is remarkable in this set.  If this is the standard by which ensuing seasons are distributed, we'll all be quite happy indeed.
Second Off: Many believe the 1st season to be of considerably lower quality that even the 2nd season.  They argue the jokes come slower, Homer and Burns' (among others) voices are too different from their later development to be palatable to the ear, and the animation is choppy.  In a way, they're right.  But in another, more accurate way, they're missing out on the bigger picture.  Having the entire 1st season at your fingertips enables you to clearly see two things: 1. the gestation of a number of very significant character relationships that develop so wonderfully over the course of this show's remarkable run (e.g. Bart vs. Skinner, Homer vs. Burns, Homer vs. Flanders, Lisa & Bleeding Gums, etc.) and 2. the extremely quick development and improvement of the production quality even in those first 13 episodes.  Examine the difference between ""Homer's Odyssey"" and ""The Crepes of Wrath"" and you'll be amazed at the latter's better continuity, improved animation, and higher-frequency of jokes.  It really gives you a sense of how the production and writing team began to realize the potential of this medium, the characters and the actors' incredible talent, and how it vaulted them into the jaw-dropping 2nd season & beyond.
And no commercials?  Ahhhh.  No more fast-forwarding through poorly marked Simpons tapes, trying to find that gem of an episode, dealing with early '93 bad-haired-actors, movie trailers and soup blurbs (well, at least until the third season's out...)",1001635200,3,2138,5.01699716713881

The features are a little hit and miss.  The foreign language clips are very interesting, as is the commentary on animation.  ""The Simpsons: America's First Family"" is pretty good, just a little short.  Extremely disappointing was the commentary to the outtakes from ""Some Enchanted Evening""; the extent of it is basically the five or six bigwigs on The Simpsons talking about how horrible it was.  Kinda sad.
Buy these DVDs, but don't expect too much from the extras.  Hopefully they'll step it up a notch (more 'making of', maybe) in subsequent editions.",1001548800,,782,4.834586466165414

My wait finally came to end on september 27th, 2001.  After having it preordered for weeks i was imediatly pleased with the amazing packaging job on the dvd.  I don't care what other people say these first episodes are some of the best, if yu can get over the sketchy animation and wierd voices.  Getting to watch them without commercials is a huge plus.  Bonus features such as the script for each one is a very interesting feature.  With Matt the man Groenings winning comentary and hilarouis simpsons outtakes, this set of 3 dvds is the best 30 dollars ive ever spent.  If you are any true simpsons fanatic this is a must have.

Some people are just never satisfied.  I'm glad Fox decided to finally put these out, and I hope they keep coming at a good pace, so I can continue the collection!

I had a hunch that maybe they just didn't know what I know.  Watching the first season again reminded me of why I get so mad at Homer, but still love him so much.  And how I pray that Bart will grow to his true potential, and learn to think with his heart more often, even though our glimpse of the future tells us he will be an overweight wrecking ball operator (but perhaps a kind one!)  And...well nobody likes the episodes about Marge and Lisa anyways...wasn't there another child?  Just kidding, I love you ladies too!

910567,4,6304561873,I bought this DVD... I was expecting many more shorts from the Tracy Ullman show. There was only 1 which was already shown on the 138th episode spactacular. The behind the scenes show was only about 5 minutes long and did not feature the voices of the Simpson's characters which was what I was hoping for. The unseen footage was only 2-3 minutes long and was just added material from the Babysitter Bandit episode. The art of the Simpsons feature was only 3 minutes long. Other than this the DVD was great. All 13 episodes from the 1st season with original intro and commentary and french language and/or spanish subtitles which was cool. 3 episode scripts and much more small extras. But is this worth the steep price. If you are a hardcore Simpsons fan it is.,1001462400,,761,4.562043795620438

While on it's way had some down falls for a set of episiodes here and there.  While some may not be funny it's still appealing to the SimpFan.  I got this dvd set a day before it's release date and it was sure worth the wait.  It's got great restoration of the color and image and it's got 5.1 digital sound.  This set of dvd's lacks there of.  It's missing a lot of what I was waiting for, not just from the episiodes but extra's.  This is a great buy I can not judge that, but there's not much more then episiodes in here that caught my eye.  It's got commentary and a few little things, but not enough for you to go back and to fiddle with them a second time around.  I really hope that they put more effort into getting things the public couldn't see or other interesting add on's for future dvd's release's of the Simpson's episiodes.",1001462400,,957,4.185792349726776
910569,5,6304561873,"I would not say this DVD is worth buying based on the 1st season episodes alone; you can see all this in syndication every 3-4 years.  But the commentary pushes it far over.  Clearly unrehearsed (Apu apparently makes a first appearance twice and we are left with no doubt that Bart never said ""kowabunga""), the commentary is good because it is honest.
One aspect of The Simpsons I never appreciated before listening to the commentary was the importance of the animation.  I always considered the final script of most importance to a Simpsons episode, but the contrast between a poorly animated ""Bart the General"" and a mediocre one sort of went against that.  In episodes in which Matt Groening commented, there was insight into the excruciating details that were deliberated on.  For example, it took an entire season to decide that pupils must be 1/7 (probably in diameter) of the eye size.
One last thing:  Why did the epidose in which French was spoken get redubbed into French, even the portions which were originally spoken in French?",1001462400,,1040,4.8474576271186445

910572,3,6304561873,"At last, The Simpsons make it to DVD, with the first release being a box set containing all the shows from the first season.
Of course, the main reason to own this DVD is to have these episodes with the best picture and sound quality possible - and without the cuts that inevitably get made for syndication. In that respect, the set is excellent. The picture quality is not always that great, but that is a result of the animation techniques used at the time (something alluded to in the commentary tracks).
The episodes themselves are great. The early stories found more of their humor in everyday type situations (relatively speaking, anyway) - for example, Bart having bully troubles in ""Bart the General"", or Homer having to sit through boring stuff at a school festival in order to see his kids participate in ""Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire"" - rather than in some of the more far-fetched plots that have become commonplace in recent years.
Best of all, you get to see The Simpsons before rough edges became polished away, before the characters and characterizations became formulized and more narrowly defined, and before sight gags began to fill in many of the gaps.
Homer is more beleagured working man than easily distracted buffoon, the relationship between Bart and Lisa is more realistic, and the show as a whole moves at a more relaxed pace, including more of the little details that make up everyday life.
The DVD set is not without flaws, however:
(1) The menus are horrible. There should be a main menu that allows the user to opt for episodes or extra features - there isn't. The first menu you get is the list of all the episodes on the disc; to access the extra features, you have to go through the submenus. Nor is there the option to view all of the episodes on a disc in sequence; at the end of an episode, you have to go back up a level, select the next episode, then go through that episode's submenu.
(2) The extra stuff is disappointing. First, the scripts are a waste of time - if I wanted to read scripts, I'd write to Fox and request copies. Next, where are all the Tracey Ullman shorts that were promised? All we get is the ""Goodnight Simpsons"" clips that we've seen already. The ""outtakes"" are all from an unaired version of a single episode, apparently for the purpose of showing us how [...bad] it looked at first. The foreign-language clips - all of the same scene from the same episode (""Life on the Fast Lane"") - will only be interesting the first time around. And, contrary to what the packaging says, Matt Groening does not appear on the commentary for all thirteen episodes - there are at least a couple on which he does not. (And the only magazine covers - alluded to in the description found on this page - that appear on these discs are found in the ""America's First Family"" special.) [N.B., Since I originally posted this, other folks have pointed out that the magazine covers and the news story on the Bart t-shirts are found on the set as Easter eggs.]

Expecially the BBC First Family one. Although it lists ""ABC Special: Bart Simpson T-Shirt Scandal"" on here, it's not on mine. They do briefly touch on it on the First Family sequence. The audio (Albert Brooks) outtakes are funnier than that episode itself. The commentary is also awesome to hear with each episode. The original scripts seem to be photocopys of the actual originals. So you can see red lines through lines they deleted and editing marks. It's really a classic DVD, and it is well worth the $30 and more. Expecially when the VHS people are paying $15 for 2 episodes, and we get 13 (22 on latter seasons/dvd's). This boxset will be a classic for lifetime.

The animation on the peripheral characters is amazing, and Homer is much better as a failed father than as a bumbling babboon. So I bought a dvd player when I heard these were coming out, because for the last four years I've fallen asleep every night to videotapes of old Simpsons episodes. The dvd set is great, but of course it's not perfect. I definitely wanted to see all of the shorts from the Tracy Ullman days, and I would have loved some footage which depicts the actual animation and voiceover process (rather than four scripts, which seems a bit excessive...especially if you don't have a dvd-rom).

You have no way of knowing what's on any of the disks unless you put each one in the player. As a nit-picky note, two of the three disks are gold, and the third is silver. Gold is better because it won't corrode over time should it be exposed to the elements. Collectors like this almost as much as consistency. The packaging is excellent and well designed (except the episode guide). I'm glad they didn't do anything creative like making the top of the slipcase spikey like Bart's hair.

It's not that the transfers aren't great--they are, and the Dolby 5.1 soundtracks are superb, particularly the atmospheric sound effects that create a rich audio field lacking on some film releases. What's missing is the extras.
Apart from Groening's commentary, there's nothing to get excited about. The foreign language clips wear thin fast (they're all the same scene), and there's no ""Lost Episode,"" but rather some unfinished animation from the ""Some Enchanted Evening"" episode. As for the documentary, it's a segment from the excellent BBC piece created last year, which fans truly deserve to see in its entirety. Fox has stepped on that, however, as it shows the actors doing the voices.
It's great to have The Simpsons on the little disc, but don't buy it if you're looking for more insight into the series. Given the volume of additional material relating to the series that's floating around, it's surprising that so little is included in the package.

For those of you that can't comprehend why it should get 4 insted of 5 stars the reasons are simple; (1) First and foremost-once you watch season 1 again, you will see that it is dry and the humor rather bland compared to the season 4-7 prime. And (2) they only included 1 of the several Tracy Ulman shorts and it's the one that every simpsons fan saw parts of on the 138th episode spectacular. This warranted me giving this DVD set a 3 out of 5 stars. The kicker to give it the extra star was the excess bonus materials that will be seen on this set.

910764,5,6304561873,"I found out about this DVD set about 2 months ago, and the minute I heard of it, I almost lost it. The Simpsons are hands-down the BEST SHOW on television. It's much better than other animated shows like South Park, which relies on its ""adult material"" way too much. Unlike that series, The Simpsons is pure comedy without falling into complete absurdity. I have to admit that some of the first season episodes are not as good as some of the later ones, but the quality is still there..in spades (by the way, the drawings and animation is a little crude). If you've never heard of the simpsons, then you've been living under a rock, this is one of the most popular shows on TV, and has remained popular for almost 12 years. One of the best aspects of this show is the fact that almost every little detail brings something to the table in terms of comedy. Example: In the episode were Bart gets kicked out of school,(season 4, esiode: ""whacking Day""), and Marge sends him to a Christian school (for 2 minutes), a sign on the school entrance says ""We put the FUN in FUNdamentalist Dogma"", now if you don't find that funny, then you need to check for a pulse!
What I'm trying to say is that this is one of the few comedy shows that has its fair share of one-liners
(many ""D'ohs"", ""ay carambas"",""worst episode ever"", etc.)but these only add to the overall value of each episode, and like I said, if you're a HUGE simpsons fan (like myself) then you need to analyze EVERYTHING, every little detail, etc., cause you can be sure you'll find something funny everywhere you look.
I don't know about the DVD...but I am glad the episodes will be shown in full screen format (wide screen would suck), and it has sooooooo many extras! I mean, commentary on every episode, special outtakes, original scripts and ONE UNAIRED EPISODE ... Oh yeah. life can be sweet sometimes!

You either love the Simpson's or you hate them... and for those that hate them, they probably never really gave them a chance. This collection of the 1st year's episodes = classic. The voices (especially Castlenetta's as Homer) are a bit rough, as is the animation, but that's what make it grand). Did you know that Homer's voice was originally an impression of Walter Matthau (by Castlenetta)? With more Simpson's DVD's to come, I think I can throw the 35 VCR tapes filled with Homer & Co in the trash... but I won't. With an incredble supporting cast; Mr. Burns, Ned Flanders, Milhouse Van Houten, Nelson, Barney Gumble, Smithers, Patty & Selma (Which one is which - Per Marge, ""It's Patty who chose the life of celibacy. Selma simply had it thrust upon her.""), Grandpa Abe, & Krusty to name a few of the best... I can see this show going on forever. Celebrity guest voices are many as the show continues - and many consider it an honor. Along with many of the rough original clips from the Tracy Ullman show, this DVD includes the entire 1st season: (1989-90): 7G08 Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire, 7G02 Bart the Genius, 7G03 Homer's Odyssey, 7G04 There's No Disgrace Like Home 7G05 Bart the General, 7G06 Moaning Lisa, 7G09 Call of the Simpsons, 7G07 The Tell-Tale Head, 7G11 Jacques To Be Wild (aka Life on the Fast Lane), 7G10 Homer's Night Out, 7G13 The Crepes of Wrath, 7G12 Krusty Gets Busted, and 7G01 Some Enchanted Evening. The Simpson's is easily the longest running animated prime time show... chock full 'o wit, sarcasm, adult humor and just flat out fun.

As we prepare to fill our bellies with Duff and our mouths with Pork Rinds, many of us have already begun to reflect on what The Simpsons means to us. Personally, my own life would not be as joyful or comical if I did not have my thousands of Simpsons quotes or scenarios to refer to on a daily basis.

I also remember my parents saying I couldn't watch the show because it was a bad influence lol.  now its matured into the greatest run of any show in television and has pretty much shaped my personality and also the humor of many people across the globe.  Nothing matches the intelligent writing and comedy that graces nearly every episode.  I'm not sure if I will buy every season, but the first 5 or 6 are a lock.  Seasons 4-5 were easily the best and I must have these in prestine condition.  I didn't get around to recording the show till season 4, so a lot of the early episodes I have are syndicated and therefore have cuts in them.  The DVD's rectify this nicely.

Very basic, not the refined writing we expected starting with the 91-92 season.

911118,5,6304561873,"The Simpsons is art at its finest.  The opening season is the shortest containing 13 classic episodes compared to 20+ in the following seasons, which will all be released in order eventually.  Sure the animation isn't as good and Homer's voice is a little different (even though it is the same person), but these stories are among the best and started the most entertaining series ever.  This is the origin of many funny phrases that have become apart of American culture.  Also, this will show each episode in its entirety.  Syndicated reruns often cut out a few seconds per episode to make room for commercials, so unless you recorded the original airing you're probably missing something.
Season One (1989-1990) consists of: Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire (7G08) Bart the Genius (7G02) Homer's Odyssey (7G03) There's No Disgrace Like Home (7G04) Bart the General (7G05) Moaning Lisa (7G06) Call of the Simpsons (7G09) The Telltale Head (7G07) Life on the Fast Lane (7G11) Homer's Night Out (7G10) The Crepes of Wrath (7G13) Krusty Gets Busted (7G12) and Some Enchanted Evening (7G01).
If you still don't own a DVD player, unlimited replay of the funniest show ever should be reason enough to finally get one.  Pick this up when you get the chance, but beware you may never go outside again.",994118400,26,1296,4.868181818181818

Yet, as time passes, the show does loose some of its luster, it does loose some of its amazing draw, but with this!  This amazing piece of americana, this amazing rebirth of the simpson dynasty, all shall be funny again!  Lately the show has shown the wear of the times...the story lines are becoming less and less spontaneously funny, but we can all relive the first season with this!  I've told everyone that i know that i would be throwing down the money as soon as a dvd anthology became available for the simpsons, and now it has!  May we all now genuflect in humble meekness before the almighty simpson god!  Thank You, and good night.  *bows gracefully*",994118400,,780,4.649635036496351

Since the first season was shorter, this first disc has many extras.  First, all of the shorts from the Tracy Ullman show will be there.  Also, there will be a ""lost"" episode included.
Fox must be commended in releasing these discs.  When they were preparing to release the discs, they went to the fans, and asked how we would like them released.  As season packs?  How many extras?  How often?  Rarely does a publisher care that much.
