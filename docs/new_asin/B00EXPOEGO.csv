5949230,3,B00EXPOEGO,"I read the reviews and it sounded great but it was not what I expected.
Not what I expected.
No where near as good as Ice Age or Despicable Me.",1392422400,5,143,3.8
5949231,5,B00EXPOEGO,"Hype for this movie has been at a fever pitch ever since release, and even though I was a little late to the show, I could understand why. The pedigree behind it was top-notch, the casting was great, and the prospect of a multi-universe crossover from several unrelated franchises was enticing. In a word, it looked fun, and like the type of movie that both kids and adults could enjoy. That, however, was a terrible underestimation, because it was far more than fun, although it certainly was that in spades. But ""The Lego Movie"" is also emotional, thrilling, and, in more ways than one, a total surprise. Warner Brothers managed to blindside me with this one, and while it may not top a certain Disney movie involving ice (at least, in my book), it's still an incredible feat in its own right.

Emmet is a typical Lego minifigure. That's no joke. He's actually the generic figure, complete with a blank-slate face and a typical haircut. That's just perfect for him though, as he lives in a city where everybody is encouraged to behave in uniform fashion by the ominous Lord Business. Unfortunately, though, he's so thoroughly average in every respect that nobody seems to notice him, which isn't the best situation to be in when he's suspected of a massive crime. The crime, as it so happens, is stumbling upon ""The Piece of Resistance,"" which will stop Business' plan of unleashing a mysterious weapon known as ""The Kragle"" upon the unsuspecting populace. Luckily, he gets rescued by the deadly and sexy (as far as Lego people can go) Wildstyle, who reveals to him that his world is only one in a series of many universes, and that Business has plans to use the Kragle on all of them. This sets off a wild adventure to stop the villain, with the aid of several heroes, known as ""Master Builders,"" and for Emmet to discover his hidden potential that may very well change everything as the characters know it.

If this sounds like a trite set-up, it's because it kind of is, but that's the point. See, despite the movie being insanely creative and funny, not to mention subversive in a weird of way, the overall narrative seemingly proceeds in a formulaic fashion... for reasons that will make sense about two-thirds of the way through it. While it's tempting to discuss this twist, it would ruin the element of creativity and surprise that makes the whole experience work. Rest assured that any gripe you have with the plot will, most likely, be thrown out the window when you realize what's really going on, and why things seemed sort of cliche for a bit. In all my years of watching films, the writers on board here delivered one of the best silver screen twists since ""The Sixth Sense,"" which is no small accomplishment.

But what about the rest of the movie? Fortunately, the formulaic narrative up until that point is aided by three things: a great cast, wickedly funny dialogue, and clever visual trickery that's worth the ticket price alone. Everybody here is perfectly cast, with special props going out to Will Arnett for his deadpan, lampooning take on Batman, Allison Brie as the infectious and adorable Unikitty, and Charlie Day as the ADD-addled Benny. However, it's worth noting that Chris Pratt as Emmet is one of the better low-key performances in any film recently, even those by directors who specialize in that niche like Wes Anderson. Sure, he'll occasionally make a silly joke, but on a deeper level, he turns a stock Lego figure into somebody with genuine pathos, whom almost anybody could surely relate to.

On top of the great cast, everything on the A/V side of things is charming and awe-inspiring in equal amounts. There's a score from Mark Mothersbaugh (known for both his excellent video game and film scores, as well as being a member of Devo,) which effortlessly blends styles at the drop of a dime, and routinely shifts from emotional to peppy, thrilling to soothing. It complements the visuals well, which are nothing short of remarkable, and probably the best usage of CGI animation I've seen in all my years. Yes, that includes every Pixar flick. To me, everything in ""The Lego Movie"" is teeming with life, somehow overcoming the fact that everything is supposed to be made out of plastic. Everything in this movie, being made of the titular plastic bricks, is used in a wide variety of surprising ways, especially in the powerful and inspiring climax. Anything can become, well, anything, if that makes any sense, and seeing somebody use the art of animation in this way should make Pixar ashamed of how derivative and bland their last few movies have been.

There's no way around it, really. Much like ""Frozen,"" ""The Lego Movie"" is not just a good ""animated movie."" It's not just ""good for a kids' flick,"" or ""funny enough for adults to like."" As a film critic, this is one of the most brilliantly constructed (if you'll pardon the pun) films in years, and emotionally resonated with me in many respects, especially when the film's world and lore is fully realized in the final act. This is, quite simply, one of the greatest animated films ever created, and to a lesser extent, one of the best films to come along, and certainly one of the most wildly inventive. Subversive, cheeky, and beautiful in many regards, this is a movie that I feel almost anybody could enjoy.

If not, well, maybe you're just missing a piece.

5949232,4,B00EXPOEGO,"This PG phenomenon is cleaning up at the box office: a $69M opening weekend tells me that families are hungry for kiddie-friendly movie fare.

Of course, I am not a six year old, so I was highly aware of the visual assault, with don't-blink-or-you'll-miss-it action and bright colors flashing off and on the screen. I could picture young'uns having a good time as they relate to sweet construction worker Emmett. His mind is ""prodigiously empty,"" according to another character (he always needs instructions), but his heart is in the right place; so it's a huge problem when he is mistaken for the Master/Builder who has to stop a villain from gluing the Universe together.

We encounter several set pieces aimed at the adults who bring their offspring to the movie:
  * ""The Piece of Resistance"" (nope, the kiddies aren't going to get THAT one!) which is perpetually sought.
  * ""Honey, Where Are My Pants?"" is a supposedly hilarious television show that illustrates the emptiness of contemporary sitcoms.
  * The Good Cop/Bad Cop Lego who speedily swaps faces, depending on which cop he is playing.
  * The double-decker couch (?!) which is the best/worst original idea Emmet has ever offered.
  * The creative use of Legos to make a city, a desert, a pirate ship and that famous double-decker couch.
  * The Millennium Falcon makes an appearance late in the film. I venture to guess that most of the rugrats won't be familiar with this one, but I could be wrong.

Bottom line? The concepts of team-building, believing in yourself and learning how to trust, can't be bad; although a possible beheading by an X-acto knife could be scary. This is one you'll want to discuss with the children on your way back home... or after viewing your DVD from Amazon.",1392336000,5,1755,4.803333333333334
5949233,5,B00EXPOEGO,"Like many people who have reviewed this offering unfairly, I received an email from Amazon indicating that my order had been cancelled because THE DISTRIBUTOR would no longer be offering it. Instead, Amazon suggested this set as an alternative.  If the rest of the dopes bothered to read the email in its entirety and do a little research, they would have discovered that that it was WARNER HOME VIDEO that CANCELED this release, NOT FLIPPING AMAZON.

Here's what happened: Warner had already planned for the original releases that we pre-ordered well before the film was released in theaters.  They knew they would have a hit on their hand but were unprepared for how big of a hit it would become. So, they scrambled to do a bunch of market research regarding this new set and discovered that consumers OVERWHELMINGLY preferred it to the original Blu-ray/3D Blu-ray/DVD/Digital (and Blu-ray/DVD) release which was made available only SEVEN days after the film was released.

Amazon DIDN'T screw you (if you want to call it that, anyway), Warner Home Video screwed you.

Someone said, ""I guess I'll just go somewhere else""

Sure, you can go somewhere else... and buy the EXACT SAME SET AMAZON IS OFFERING BECAUSE THAT'S ALL THAT'S GOING TO BE RELEASED FOR THIS TITLE FOR AMAZON AT MOST RETAILERS. Target is the ONLY retailer to offer the standard Blu-ray/DVD combo as it's their exclusive. Again, blame Warner, NOT Amazon.

""Now we have to do this again for a more Expensive 3D version .....?""

NO... As noted by the CAREFULLY WORDED product description, the 3D disc is a BONUS.  So, if you don't like it, TAKE IT UP WITH WARNER HOME VIDEO, NOT AMAZON.

You slobs are lucky that Amazon is such a decent company that they gave us all a $10 credit (or better in some cases) to purchase this when they were under no obligation to do so because they did nothing wrong.  WARNER changed their mind, ya dopes, and the fact of the matter is that the set would probably have been down to what you paid for the set you initially pre-ordered by relase day anyway, or something close to it.  I already had a $10 credit applied to my account over a customer service issue so I was able to apply the code and get $20 off, so score for me and if it goes down by release day I'll be paying even less than $20 for it.

Bait and switch?  Please. You people are embarrassing.

ORIGINAL FILM REVIEW POSTED ON THE ORIGINAL PRE-ORDER SET:

Please note, this is a review for the film only. Today's date is February 14, 2014 and at the time of this review, this film had only been in theaters for one week and the 3D Blu-ray/Blu-ray/DVD/Ultraviolet home video release was only available for preorder.

It is a rare event that I give a film a perfect score but if there was ever a film that was more deserving in recent memory, I can't think of one. The LEGO Movie is by far the best animated film I have ever seen and that includes ANY Pixar film (yes, I know... blasphemy). It is also the first film I have seen in years in which the entire audience stood up and applauded when the credits rolled.

Cleverly acted, the film showcases the comedic talents and sometimes surprising comedic talents of some of the biggest names in popular film today. Will Farrell (Lord Business/President Business) and Will Arnett (Batman/Bruce Wayne)... heck, those guys are givens as far as comedic timing is concerned but who knew that Morgan Freeman and Liam Neeson could be so funny?

From the beginning, the story seems like nothing more than a rehash of the themes in Kung Fu Panda or The Matrix with the role of Po/Neo taken on by our very ordinary hero, Emmet (Chris Pratt). As the film progresses, it takes on the tone and plot of a million of other action film clichs but the visually stunning frenetic action combined with multiple clever pop-culture references allows you to forgive what seems like a generic story and just simply enjoy the awesome adventure that you and your kids are on. The level of detail is absolutely phenomenal, right down to the tiny scratches in the ABS plastic and my favorite, the visible finger prints on the minifigures themselves. And make no mistake, by design, this film was meant to be seen by families which just makes the experience that much more enjoyable.

So, am I saying that the overall experience of the film makes up for the weak story? Nope. In the last 20 minutes of the film there are live-action sequences that tie the whole story together and turn what was a generic and almost mediocre plot into one of the most brilliant pieces of complex fantasy story-telling I have ever seen in a family film. It was so cleverly done that I literally slapped myself in the forehead for being tricked like I was because the film drops not-so-subtle clues as to the big twist throughout its entirety.

I came out of this film realizing that though cleverly marketed as a kid's film, this is a nostalgia film for X and Y Geners (is that a word? don't care, going with it...) and the tell was with 1980s Spaceman, the insanely hyperactive Benny (voiced by Charlie Day).

Anyone whoever had this minifigure (or a similar one with the space helmet) knew that within a month's time of taking that helmet off repeatedly, the bottom of the helmet near the chin would split because it was so thin. The reason for this is simple: it was a two part injection-molded piece of plastic and that thin little piece was right on the seam. The fact that someone thought of this very esoteric detail in and of itself is not only brilliant but it also helps achieve one of the film's main goals: taking our generation back to a time when we were seven years-old. The level of violence in this film is probably the biggest factor in the MPAA PG rating, but it's the exact same kind of violence that a seven year-old kid would inflict on their own LEGO minifigures through normal imagination-fueled play and like everything else in the film, it ties into the big twist that brings the whole film together.

Is The LEGO Movie, as some have claimed, just a two-hour advertisement for a toy? Yep, but who cares? LEGO toys are a permanent part of our pop-culture and certainly no different than film franchises based on G.I. Joe or Transformers... except for the fact that I can watch a LEGO film with my kids and not scare the living crap out of them. The motivations for this film are irrelevant as to its quality despite the cynical attitudes towards it.

My only regret is that we didn't see it in 3D as this is one film that it is a moral imperative to see in 3D. Oh, well... I guess we'll just have to go see it again. Everything is awesome, indeed.",1392336000,,6635,4.551637279596977
5949234,4,B00EXPOEGO,"I wasn't sure what to expect with THE LEGO MOVIE. The previews I had seen about the film weren't all that impressive. However, I have seen some of the Lego Star Wars and Lego Batman shorts and found them highly entertaining and humorous. I had also read some really positive reviews about THE LEGO MOVIE from some movie critics I respect. Overall, I found the movie to be highly entertaining, but tainted with disappointment.

THE LEGO MOVIE revolves around an ordinary construction worker named Emmett Brickowoski (Chris Pratt). Emmett is just a typical worker. His favorite show is Honey, Where Are My Pants, his favorite song is Everything Is Awesome, he does everything by the instruction manual, and he thinks President Business (Will Ferrell) is a great guy. Unbeknownst to average citizens like Emmett, President Business is actually an evil mastermind known as Lord Business who not only wants to rule the world, but wants to permanently change it to fit his tastes. All of the Master Builders of the world are hiding in secret. But there is a prophecy that there will be a special Builder who will find the piece de resistance and stop Lord Business. After being smitten by Wyldstylde (Elizabeth Banks), Emmett has an accident and ends up discovering the piece de resistance and is caught up in a war between the Master Builders and Lord Business. Hes joined on his quest by a blind sorcerer named Vitruvius (Morgan Freeman), Batman (Will Arnett), a happy strange looking cat named Unikitty (Alison Brie), a 1980s spaceman named Benny (Charlie Day), and Wyldstyle.

What I was most impressed about with THE LEGO MOVIE was the humor and the special effects. The Lego shorts and cartoons are usually very funny and THE LEGO MOVIE is no different. However, the humor in THE LEGO MOVIE is moved up a couple of notches. There are layers of humor scattered throughout. At one moment theres a one-liner joke that the kids will appreciate and the next second theres a reference from something in classical literature being thrown in. The jokes and laughs keep up a constant and steady stream throughout the movie, but the humor never drags the story down.

As for the special effects, I was amazed at how just about everything in THE LEGO MOVIE world looked like it was made from Legos. Not including the strange offshoot the movie takes in the third act and some random artifacts from a different world, everything in THE LEGO MOVIE actually looks like its made from Legos: from shower bubbles, to water, to lasers. Almost everything in THE LEGO MOVIE looks like it is part of a Lego world.

In terms of story and plot, THE LEGO MOVIE is a really well written film. It could have a crash and chintzy commercial, but its not. The movie is filled with messages about using ones own talents, believing in yourself, working together as a team, why you shouldnt be consumed by pride, and the importance of family. Despite all of this I was disappointed by the switch-up in the plot during the movies final act. I don't want to give too much away, but during the final act of the movie, the story veers off into a completely different direction. Granted, in the hands of lesser screenwriters and filmmakers, this part of the movie would have come off as complete schmaltz, but in THE LEGO MOVIE it does not. However, this last section of the movie left me feeling a little bit cheated and disappointed. I wanted to see how the characters in the movie would solve their own crisis, but instead was given a deux es machina finale. THE LEGO MOVIE is a good movie, but the films final act is what keeps it from being an awesome movie.

Overall, THE LEGO MOVIE is a highly entertaining movie that will appeal to people of all ages and is truly a family movie. Its full of great humor and has some extraordinary special effects. Just beware that youll either love the movies last act or it will be something that makes the movie a little bit disappointing.",1392249600,,3946,4.6801152737752165
5949235,5,B00EXPOEGO,"I have to admit, when I went into the theater to see this movie, I was expecting a lot of typical Lego humor and very little plot. I was right about the Lego humor, it was hilarious and thoroughly enjoyable. Every other moment, another pun or random visual or spoken joke was made. The humor, in my mind, was better than in any other lego movie that I have ever seen. The humor was enjoyable for kids and adults, playing heavily with the visual humor as well as on the humor in the unexpected.
The biggest surprise was the plot. Any lego short or movie has been weak on plot. Even the best Lego movies of the past were mainly funny with a shallow, kid's movie plot. This film, however, had a fairly deep plot, hitting more than one lesson for children and adults alike. Instead of pushing individuality through complete uniqueness, the story presented a strong argument for the importance for teamwork, even in the highly skilled. The lessons drove the plot home as the story carried a consistent story line. Though not like the story lines of Disney or Dreamworks, this story is great in a different way, making it an extremely unique children's film.
Lastly, as others have commented, the film's special effects and the attention to detail on the Lego building sequences was astonishing. The film presented a high quality of visual clarity, making the film much more enjoyable and much easier to get into.
Overall, this film impressed me. It was a truly enjoyable film. Like Disney's Frozen, this film was a pleasant surprise from the animated genre, and like Frozen, it is just as much for adults as it was for kids.

5949236,5,B00EXPOEGO,"We're big fans of LEGO in my house, but I thought any movie featuring LEGO would be one big commercial.  I also wasn't entirely sure what the point would be.  LEGO is about creativity and exercising your imagination -- which is why it's been so difficult to get a decent Dungeons & Dragons film made -- so what could a movie about LEGO bricks possibly offer?  As it turns out, a lot.

First, let's establish that the LEGO company knew who to hire: directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller made the hilarious ""Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs"" and Chris McKay created ""Robot Chicken."" I repeat: ROBOT. CHICKEN.  The terrifyingly un-PC, uproariously funny, occasionally squirm-inducing Robot Chicken, a show consisting entirely of animation riffing on the pop culture of our youth.  So it's no surprise that ""The LEGO Movie"" is entertaining for adults.  What is surprising is how it's entertaining for everybody. This was my three-year-old's first film and she loved it, along with my six-year-old, my wife, and of course me.

The world revolves around your typical yellow minifig Emmet Brickowoski (Chris Pratt), an everyday construction worker who loves Taco Tuesdays and just wants to fit in.  Much to his dismay, it turns out he's so utterly bland that he is also utterly forgettable...until he stumbles upon the Piece of Resistance, and super-heroine Wyldstyle (Elizabeth Banks) stumbles upon Emmet.  Prophesized by the blind Vitruvius (Morgan Freeman) as The Special, Emmet's humdrum life will never be the same.  He is to lead the Master Builders, minifigs who know how to assemble LEGOs, against Lord Business (Will Ferrell) and his Octan Corporation empire. Thing is, Emmet is the least special minifig of all.

What ensues is a mind-bending adventure that riffs on everything from ""The Matrix"" to ""Terminator."" With so many worlds to explore, the occasional intrusion of items from real life (always deadly), and a soundtrack that will burn into your skull, it's hard not to enjoy the insanity.  Every piece of pop culture in the world is so trite (ranging from the aforementioned ""Everything is Awesome!"" song everyone listens to the ""Where's My Pants?"" television show everyone watches) that it's hard not to laugh at our consumerist culture in spite of the fact that this is a movie which will sell many, many, LEGOs.

The film is strikingly earnest and utterly false at the same time, filled with a meta-narrative that is either charmingly quaint or a deep metaphor for the child in all of us.  You could spend all day analyzing its nuances -- it's a movie that you need to own on DVD to get all the in-jokes that are crammed onto the screen -- or you could just go and play with your LEGOs.  Which is exactly what my son did...and he's started building LEGOs in new and creative ways.

5949465,5,B00EXPOEGO,"This was a sugary feast for the eyes with jokes aimed at both kids and adults. But what we really appreciated about this film is it's made-for-children critique of Capitalism. Lord Business is the obvious ""bad guy"" on a psychopathic pursuit of profit and perfection. His quest to achieve these ends comes at the expense of all that is unique and ""cool"" in the Lego realm.

Eventually we learn that the Lego world's central conflict (""business"" vs. ""fun"") parallels the internal frustrations felt by our meta-narrator: a child whose beloved, working parent--under the influence of ""business""--is rarely available to play.",1494633600,,620,5.2

Seeing everything (even smoke) made up of Legos truly enhanced the visuals, but the storyline was pretty straightforward and simple. Characterization was a combination of hit and miss.

5949981,5,B00EXPOEGO,"Written in so many great layers. Great for kids but adults can enjoy this film by themselves. Nostalgia, family, tongue-in-cheek marketing, cultural satire, political commentary, even cosmology, all somehow come together beautifully in a film my kids watched dozens of times and I enjoyed every single time. Not too many films can pull that off.

I can't believe Morgan Freeman hasn't done more voiceover work, because he just kills it. Chris Pratt and Will Farrell are hilarious, but that's generally a given. Alison Brie was delightful in Community and channels all that tried-and-true repressed Id she showed there into this. Elizabeth Banks brings established comic chops to her role, though I will agree with others that the agency of her otherwise very potent character was marginalized; she obviously has a backstory where she can't sort out her own identity (constantly changing names), hopes to be the Special (the ""hero"" of the Prophecy) but isn't, and then despite these unresolved insecurities loses herself in relationships. I don't think my five year old daughter internalizes those heady concepts; she just likes that Wyldstyle can build stuff and kicks butt, which she totally does. Liam Neeson growls, snarls and kicks chairs with totally PG ""swearing"" fits as Bad Cop, lampooning the roles that have made him so much money lately. Finally (for the purposes of this now-longer-than-intended review), Will Arnett and the script subvert the stereotypical Batman so hard it's difficult to believe but amazing to watch. There's a reason he's getting his own film soon.

So if you haven't seen this movie, it's worth it. Good luck getting the main song out of your head, a delicious piece of ironic sugary pop that hides a layer of tragic bitterness all its own; the songwriter was actually in a pretty dark place with his home life at the time of writing and you can disturbingly hear that undercurrent of smiling with gritted teeth. This is basically the tone of the film in music form - stuff sucks, but we have what we need to make it just a little better: friends, creativity, hope. That's what I got, anyway.",1482105600,3,2126,4.985915492957746

5949997,5,B00EXPOEGO,"When I first heard about ""The LEGO Movie,"" I thought it couldn't be any good. For one thing, I thought we already had Lego movies. There are tons of stop-motion Lego movies on YouTube. How could a ""Lego Movie"" be any different or better than what I'd already seen? The key to this movie is that it's about Legos itself as a concept, not just making movies with Legos.

The movie dramatizes the age-old war between two types of Lego builders - those who follow the directions and those who ignore the directions, those who are rigid in building exactly what Legos are supposed to be and those who build whatever they can imagine.

In ""The Lego Movie,"" we meet Emmett (Chris Pratt), an average construction worker. He always follows the instructions in everything from eating breakfast to making friends. He lives in a city rigidly organized by Lord Business (Will Farrell), who's promoting an upcoming holiday called Taco Tuesday.

But when Emmett falls into a hole in the Earth, he becomes bonded to a mysterious object called the Piece of Resistance. He discovers Lord Business plans to use a weapon called the Kragle, which will freeze the world in place, forcing everyone to stay the way he wants them to, forever. Emmett is rescued by a sultry woman who works with the Master Builders, an eclectic group who can reshape the world to build anything. Led by Vetruvius (Morgan Freeman), a blind and scatterbrained wizard, Emmett discovers the world is literally constructed in different realms and genres. Emmett must become the Special, rediscover his power, and save the world.

The story is a clich, intentionally so. ""Lego"" parodies all the tropes of the Heroes Journey, including the prophecy, the aging mentor, and the special individual who saves the world. Along the way, Emmett meets other Master Builders like an egotistical Batman and an 80s astronaut obsessed with rocket ships.

Even though all the Legos are computer-generated, the movie mimics the feel of a stop-motion animated movie. Flames are shown as Lego fire pieces. Water is a cascade of blue studs. It's all part of the charm and fun. There's a twist in the end where the true nature of their world is revealed, and it's surprisingly emotional.

Overall, ""Lego Movie"" is a great movie with a lot of laughs, fun and heart.",1481932800,3,2296,4.8295165394402035

5950237,2,B00EXPOEGO,"We love this movie - terrific for kids and adults viewing pleasure! The disc & box did arrive new and undamaged.

The reason for the poor review is because of the digital code that came with the Blu Ray disc and inaccurate description of the product.
<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lego-Movie/dp/B00EXPOE5U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lego Movie</a>
While the Blu Ray disc works perfectly, the digital code only works in the UK and Ireland. We read the product description and while it did warn about the DVD not working in the US - it did not mention anything about Blu Rays or the digital code! Since so many products on Amazon seem to share reviews and descriptions even when the products are different, we thought this was one of those cases.
The product details are also for DVD only. ""Editorial Reviews"" area said to review the description but there was not a description to review except what was already mentioned above.
Unfortunately we did not recognize this issue with the code until recently when we tried to redeem it. So now we have a digital code that is still valid until 21/07/2017 but is completely unusable in the US. And the digital copy is something we were looking for in purchasing this movie.

I feel that Amazon and the sellers should make a greater effort to distinguish these different formats, editions, descriptions and reviews. It should be easily found in the first lines of the product item's description, right next to the picture (before scrolling anywhere else on the page) which region a disc & digital code is formatted for and it should match the product being sold!

The sharing of descriptions and reviews between different kinds items should be removed. It is completely irrelevant and not at all helpful to have reviews for separate products muddled together! It actually seems fraudulent as the items are sharing review/star ratings - very misleading!
This is true for for all kinds of products on Amazon - for example, I recently ordered a basting spoon but most of the 40+ reviews were for a spatula&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/KitchenAid-Nylon-Basting-Spoon-Black/dp/B005D6G5QE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">KitchenAid Nylon Basting Spoon, Black</a>!

It did have starts and stops that were problematic (probably from trying to introduce so many different Lego ""worlds"" into the mix) and the voice talent, while excellent, didn't stand out (huge Elizabeth Banks fan and didn't even know she was the female lead).

I (being that I was explaining the movie) kind of saw that it was like ""The Matrix."" There were comedic moments but not enough of them and it did seem to be a bit long (tossing in the Will Ferrell ending to explain what was going on probably pushed it long).

5950326,5,B00EXPOEGO,"I took a nine year old boy with me to the theater when the movie first came out and we both loved it. After I bought this DVD I watched it with my niece and nephew, ages 19 and 20, and they loved it, too. The writing is clever enough that only adults will understand some of the jokes and pop references, yet it is still entertaining to children.

Spoiler alert:
Most action movies are about good vs. evil and in the end the good guys violently vanquish their foes. Where else can you find an entertaining movie where at the end the ""good guy"" reaches out to make peace with the ""bad guy,"" who accepts and reforms? The Lego Movie has great life lessons for all ages.",1475107200,,666,4.203125

And it wasn't kind of good, it was super horrible... just kidding, it's one of the best family movies of all time! And it's not like the Lego shows where they make just as an ad for the toy, it's basically telling you to play with your own Legos and build  with your creativity, that's what I wanna here!

Eventually peace is made, and common ground found, after the usual explosions and chase scenes.
There is one main female character who isn't just there for candy value, however most noteworthy characters are male (a ratio of about 4:1 again, standard fare).
So it's not perfect and if like popular culture to include more relevant female characters for the sake of my boys growing up in a balanced world,  and we do enjoy this movie (mom with sixteen ten and six year old boys)",1463443200,,674,4.663865546218488

I would definitely recommend this movie for a child who loves lego!",1531180800,,297,4.321428571428571
8610207,5,B00EXPOEGO,Funny movie for the kids and the adults. It gets old quickly. My kids play it at least 3 times a day.  Everything isn't awesome when viewed that many times.,1531094400,,156,4.2
