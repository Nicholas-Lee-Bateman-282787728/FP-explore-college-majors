3532327,4,B001DJLD2Q,"Love Hugh Grant.  Great ""chick-flicks"" movies.  The jury is still out on the double sided DVD.  I'm not sure I like the idea - although I'm not entirely sure why - maybe both sides need to be protected - maybe you can't see the name of the movies (on either side) well.  I like having one movie per DVD.",1242518400,,303,4.084745762711864
3532328,5,B001DJLD2Q,"This collection comes on two DVDs.  I hadn't seen Mickey Blue Eyes or An Awfully Big Adventure when I purchased, but I bought it because I really enjoyed Music and Lyrics as well as Two Weeks Notice.  However, I really enjoyed MBEs and AABA!

Just a note, Big Adventure is a very adult show.  It has strong sexual themes and references.  Artiscally and psychologically appealing however, with an emotional moral.",1226361600,32,412,4.828571428571428

3532365,5,B001DJLD2Q,"What a great collection.
I like 3 movies out of 4 from this collection.
I only hated An Awfully Big Adventure which I saw it because it was in the collection. Otherwise I would have never watched. That movie was so horrible.
Other movies, although I have watched them before, I loved so much wathcing them again.
This collection is a must own and I will watch them from time to time.",1451865600,,383,4.333333333333333

3532367,1,B001DJLD2Q,It took me several months to start watching this collection and when I did start watching them the first movie I chose ( Music & Lyrics) was defective. Amazon refused to even allow me to submit that information. Unsatisfactory!!!,1444780800,3,229,4.897435897435898

Although I ordered this pack of DVD's in 2009, I didn't actually sit down to have a 'Hugh Grant' movie Sunday until Nov 24, 2013, and low and behold the first movie I tried to watch cut off before the ending.  I have no idea how it ends!  I am reluctant to give this even one star and would NEVER recomend newtownvideos!",1385510400,3,346,4.292307692307692

3532411,1,B001DJLD2Q,I will never get 4 movies on a disc again.  Much too hard to fast forward to the one you want to see.  I will only buy singles inthe future.,1371081600,3,140,3.6333333333333333
3532412,5,B001DJLD2Q,All the films are good. Two Weeks is the winner but The Englishman is really best after seeing it more than once.  You begin to get the sweet flavor of the effort in the village.  Loved it,1368144000,,188,4.054054054054054

3532417,3,B001DJLD2Q,Three movies are quite charming and mostly light hearted fun. I'd never seen An Awefully Big Adventure and now wish I could burn it out of my brain. I kept waiting for the humor and romance and should have stopped watching! Who messed up BIG time and included this movie with romantic comedies. Incest?!?!?! Oh and suicide is super funny... Such a disturbing and gross movie. People are free to create whatever they'd like but it should have Never been in a collection with the other movies. May be worth re-buying all the other movies one by one just to not have that one in my house.,1355788800,4,585,4.4766355140186915
3532418,5,B001DJLD2Q,I love all of these movies... especially Music and Lyrics so this was a no brainer for me.  I will get lots of quality couch/knitting time in with these as entertainment this winter.  Love being able to buy as a set.,1355097600,,216,4.2439024390243905
3532429,5,B001DJLD2Q,"Good collection for the Hugh Grant fan with 2 movies when he wasn't so well-known, so that's a nice treat.  Good value for the collector or movie addict.  Nice addition for the Bridget Jones movies for your library.",1311379200,5,215,4.631578947368421

3532431,4,B001DJLD2Q,"I love all the movies and had seen all but ""An Awfully Big Adventure"" and i saw that Alan Rickman was in it as well and was over joy .....Untill i watched it. That movie should never of been made in my personal view it was just wrong on too many levels. I love all the other movies and think its a wonderful with that one little hickup",1290556800,,335,3.9411764705882355

3532433,1,B001DJLD2Q,All of these movies are horrible and grant has to be the worst actor in history and also a very annoying person to hear speak. This dvd might make good fire wood though.,1266451200,,169,4.151515151515151

3532435,4,B001DJLD2Q,"I bought this thinking I would enjoy it since I love Hugh Grant.  I had seen Music and Lyrics, Two Weeks Notice, and Micky Blue Eyes, but had not seen An Awfully Big Adventure.  First of all it is a VERY adult movie.  Secondly, it pretty much had no point to it.  I just kept wondering if the ""child"" in that movie had something wrong with her, and if she was really that stupid.  At the end of the movie I was like I have lost brain cells watching this movie.  And it wasn't a chick flick at all.  Anyway, if you are thinking about buying this set, it's a really good deal, just be warned about the last movie.",1265068800,5,611,4.041666666666667
3532436,4,B001DJLD2Q,"Three of the four movies are great (my definition of pleasant distraction).  The purpose of a movie, for me, is not to solve major problems or to have a hero or heroine.  For me, a simple, funny mix that gives a happy ending, an expected ending. This equals relaxation when I have down time.  Hugh Grant is great at being an attractive lead while being effortlessly funny.  Have not been able to get into Big Awful Adventure, but three of four give what I purchased the DVD for.",1252108800,16,478,4.3977272727272725
3532437,3,B001DJLD2Q,"We usually like Hugh Grant movies.  He's usually funny and a little romantic.  This collection was a little different.  Two of the movies (Mickey Blue Eyes and Two Weeks Notice) were funny, romantic, great!  The other two movies were ""strange"".  One, Music and Lyrics, was rather slow, drawn-out, boring and we couldn't wait for it to end.  The other, An Awfully Big Adventure was strange, hard-to-follow, kind-of-creepy, tragic and sad. This movie was rated R, the others were PG-13.  We also had trouble with the design of the DVD case.  It has a swinging insert holding one of the double-sided DVD's, which came loose during shipping scratching the DVD's, so that they skip and freeze.  The replacement was in the same condition.  We would suggest replacing the case, if you order.  However, for about $10, it was still a good deal, if only for the two better movies.",1248220800,5,870,4.8108108108108105
3532438,4,B001DJLD2Q,"I adore Hugh Grant--funny, sexy--and I bought this collection awhile ago for the ridiculously low price of something like $12. My only complaint is that it includes ""An Awfully Big Adventure,"" which was an ""awfully big mistake."" I think this is one of the worst movies ever made, and the fact that it's referred to as a comedy is simply insane. Here are some spoilers: Incest (father/daughter), suicide (father, after finding out that he had sex with his own daughter), a second suicide, I think (the daughter). This was a really sick movie, IMO, and I would have been so much happier had it not been included in this set. ""Nine Months"" or ""Englishman..."" would have been better choices. Oh, ""Bitter Moon"" (not in this set, thank goodness), is another seriously sick movie. I have watched the other three movies many, many times over and love them.",1246406400,5,848,4.775510204081633
