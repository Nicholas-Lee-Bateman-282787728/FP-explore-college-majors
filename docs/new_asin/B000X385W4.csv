8226776,5,B000X385W4,"Make Them Die Slowly is arguably the film for which Director Lenzi is best remembered today, and while some might not wish such a legacy on their worst enemy, I think it fits old Umberto quite well. Whenever anyone makes a movie as crass and squalid and pugnaciously gross as Make Them Die Slowly, thats what they deserve to be remembered for, and its perfectly fair to say that this movie marks the culmination of everything Lenzi had been doing for the past decade at least. If you have a cast-iron stomach and absolutely no couth, its a hoot and a half.

The Italian cannibal movies of the 70s and 80s enjoy a little-recognized point of distinction from the more conventional horror films of their era. To the best of my knowledge, every single one of them was either targeted by the Director of Public Prosecutions during the height of the Video Nasties scare or banned from Great Britains video stores as a result of the Video Recordings Act of 1984. I can think of no other case since the 1930s in which an entire genre was expressly given the boot from an entire country or at least not from any country that wasn't under the thumb of some manner of authoritarian dictator. Perhaps because it was the first film of its kind that I saw (or indeed heard of), I tend to think of Umberto Lenzis Make Them Die Slowly as a sort of poster child for its whole sordid tribe. Whether thats valid or not, I definitely believe this films divergent fates on the opposing shores of the Atlantic have something to tell us about the difference between the British response to the rise of hardcore gore movies and the American. Make Them Die Slowly was banned in the UK, but here in the States, it was promoted with one-sheets and video boxes that proudly proclaimed, Banned in 31 countries! This is one instance, I think, in which we Ugly Americans are indisputably on the side of the angels.",1384646400,,1883,4.521994134897361
