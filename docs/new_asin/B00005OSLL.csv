7949153,1,B00005OSLL,"It's hard to believe that Roy Scheider, one of my all time favorite actors, had anything to do with this cheesy low rent flick which seems to feature pretty boys who can't act a lick.  I guess Mr. Scheider must have been down on his luck.",1509321600,,238,4.173913043478261
7949154,2,B00005OSLL,"This is some of the worst acting I've seen, and the plot wasn't much better. Flat, predictable story, with extremely loud blow-em-up action scenes, which were used to cover up the poor acting. Would not recommend.",1505865600,,213,4.944444444444445

In reviewing a recent film some film critic mentioned this older sci-fi film favorably so I thought Id have a look.  This stars Ray Scheider (as the bad guy), Dina Meyer and William McNamara.  The plot is about an NSA agent whose job it is to catch terrorists and drug smugglers, who suddenly develops large gaps in his memory, and his search to figure out why, who is doing it, and whether he can reverse it.  Its a research drug called Oblivion whichyeahcauses walling-off of large chunks of memory.  The reason?  The whole thing is so ludicrous Im not going into it.
The plot is lame, the dialog mostly abysmal, the acting indifferent to abominable, the special effects non-existent, the soundtrack and cinematography wholly forgettable (insert Oblivion joke here).  Personally I'd say avoid this at all costs.",1448496000,2,853,4.875

7949160,4,B00005OSLL,"This is a very good B movie.  The acting by William McNamara was good and Roy Scheider, as always, was exelent.  The movie has a somewhat unique plot.  When an agent does not know who he can trust he goes to his Ex wife (Dina Meyer) and tries to get her help into finding out what is happining to him.  They saved some money in filming by using part a chase seen  from the movie Narrow Margin, but the footage was spliced in very well.  The sound was very good for a low budget movie.  It is a movie I will watch again.",1045612800,12,519,3.9805825242718447
