8388050,4,B0033T50NW,"I quite enjoyed this film, despite the fact that it seemed to try very hard to avoid stirring feelings in the viewer. It's very beautiful, and the characters very real, in an almost documentary sense. I appreciate films that portray events without trying to 'push' the viewer towards one feeling or another, and but for the gentle suggestions of the soundtrack, this film does just that. My major objection with this film is that it seems unfinished. It ends at a very awkward point, without explanation, much less resolution. Despite that, I think it is still very much worth the viewing, especially if you're a fan of Firth.",1372291200,,626,4.805555555555555
8388051,3,B0033T50NW,"I have watched Genova on my television, a grey Sunday afternoon simply because it was streaming at that time on the payperview channel.
I found it beautiful and absorbing, contrary of what reviewers have written, a rich texture of subtle and shifting micro events carry on the whole structure of this quite unique film.
Death and mourning are always present as an extra character while three different generations try to cope with what is left of their life after a loss, in a new, misterious and sensual city.
It is an intense, intimate movie and I strongly recommend it.",1295654400,,572,4.787878787878788

8388053,1,B0033T50NW,"This film is appalling - I am disappointed it achieved such accolades. What is the world coming to? Colin Firth is a brilliant actor, and the others in this dreadful movie did a good job too, for what it's worth, but the move goes nowhere, except through the picturesque streets of beautiful Genoa. Is that all that's required? Scenery? Foreign accents? What about a storyline? Tension? Hell, what about a plot? Appalling.",1272153600,,422,4.875
8388054,2,B0033T50NW,"The previous reviewer is correct in saying there is no plot in this movie.  Virtually nothing happens, in terms of action or the emotional development of the characters.  This movie would display a flatline if hooked up to a heart monitor.  The only thing it has going for it is the cinematography of Genoa, but even that starts to pale after a while.  I fast forwarded the second half hoping for some sort of redemptive denouement but even the ending was dull.",1260748800,,461,4.585365853658536
8388055,4,B0033T50NW,"""Genova"" is a curious film.  I was always waiting for something to happen but it rarely did.  Having said that, I nonetheless quite enjoyed it.  However, it has no discernable plot.  It is essentially an inside view at a family's experience of tragedy and there subsequent recuperation in Genova.

The film starts with a pleasant family scene in a car in the American winter.  It quickly shifts to horrible tragedy.  As a means of coping with tragedy, the father, Joe (Colin Firth) decides to head off to Italy for a year where he will lecture at the university in Genova.  He travels with his two daughters who seem to be about ten and sixteen.  They live in the heart of the old city where the streets are often dark and the feel of the film is brooding.  I was always waiting for some further tragedy or incident.  These are slow in coming and largely manageable.  Much centres on the younger daughter who is having real troubles coming to grips with the death of her mother.  Indeed, she has visions of the mother regularly.  The older daughter is a real beauty who is just coming to understand sex in the newly liberating environment.  It is the role of the father to manage these challenges.

As I have already said, the film has no plot.  Rather, the viewer is given an inside view of a family in day to day life.  The pace of the film is languid and the characters are very believable.  I found myself being quite entranced by the lives being lived.

There is no point seeing this film and expecting action in the modern sense.  You will, however, see a captivating modern film that deserves a wider audience than it will receive.  The film is clearly art house.  But don't let this tag put you off.  The film has charms and is there to be enjoyed.",1257033600,3,1756,4.449685534591195
