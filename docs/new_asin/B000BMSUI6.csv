8089189,4,B000BMSUI6,"This film is the sequel to the b&w 1955 ""El Gavilan Vengador,"" and is in crisp, clear color. It also stars Antonio Aguilar's beautiful wife, Flor Silvestre, and is one of the first of many films they would do together. Aguilar plays Capitan Mauricio Rosales, who has been sent to investigate crimes and a murder in a mining area where gold has been found, but in secret, he is also the masked ""Gavilan Vengador,"" who ""Conquers but never kills,"" and defends the helpless against the bad guys. Directed and co-written by Jaime Salvador,  ""La Justicia"" has 7 songs (with a good rendition of my favorite, ""El Gavilan Colorado""), an amusing all-out barroom brawl, spectacular horses, and a dash of humor here and there. Not a great film, but a highly entertaining one, and a must for Aguilar/Silvestre fans.

Antonio Aguilar, who was born in 1919, in Zacatecas, has been called by some ""The Roy Rogers of Mexico"" because of his superb horsemanship and his wonderful singing voice, talents which he combined in countless films during his lengthy career, starting in the early 1950s. Silvestre has also had a legendary and long career, and the Aguilar name continues in the spotlight with their superstar son, Pepe Aguilar. There is a 2 disc set available in some stores (for a very nice price) that couples this film with the original ""El Gavilan Vengedor,"" and both films are in excellent condition for their age. For anyone who enjoys charro films, it's a nifty package.",1174953600,,1466,4.836653386454183
