3734660,5,B001OQCUYS,"This movie is extremely funny and everybody did an awesome job. It's like the opposite version of '13 Going on 30' Mike O'Donnell gives up his chance for a scholarship, when he finds out his girlfriend, Scarlet is pregnant. 20 years later, Mike is going through a bad divorce, his kids don't respect him and is forced to stay at his nerdy friend, Ned's house. While visiting his old' school, a janitor asks Mike if he wishes he could go back and do it all over again. Mike tells him 'yes' and the next morning, he's 17 again! I thought it was hilarious when Zac Efron acts like a parent the whole time and tells teenagers to be abstinent. He helps his son get on the basketball team, his daughter is dumped by the school bully and tries to make out with him, and his wife is dating another man. Can teenage Mike set things right? I wish I could be 17 AGAIN!!!",1240272000,,859,4.276073619631902
3734661,4,B001OQCUYS,"On the surface, Mike O'Donnell is a lot like Troy Bolton, another Zac Efron character. Both play high school Basketball, and both are torn over two passions in their lives. Unlike Troy Bolton, however, Mike O'Donnell struggles with issues much deeper and more resonant than a choice between Basketball and musical theater; through divine intervention, he faces a choice between reliving his life and continuing down the path he has been on for twenty years. Mike is the main character of ""17 Again,"" a lighthearted but surprisingly good film that examines life's issues with a mixture of humor and warmth. Part of the charm comes from the nave and idealistic nature of the story--virtually nothing that happens is remotely possible, but we're engaged just the same, and that's because most people wish they had the chance to do something over again.

Back in 1989, when Mike was still a seventeen-year-old high school student, he walked away from a Basketball scholarship to be with his girlfriend, Scarlett (Allison Miller). Today, Mike is a thirty-seven-year-old loser (Matthew Perry). He has emotionally checked out of his marriage. Scarlett (Leslie Mann) wants a divorce, and his teenage children, Maggie (Michelle Trachtenberg) and Alex (Sterling Knight), want nothing to do with him. He loses a promotion to an inexperienced girl no older than twenty-five. He has been kicked out of the house, forcing him to stay with his nerdy best friend, a rich software designer named Ned (Thomas Lennon), who Mike protected from bullies back in high school. Depressed and rejected, Mike is reduced to wandering the halls of his former high school and staring into a display case at his old picture.

Along comes a pleasant-sounding janitor (Brian Doyle-Murray), who conveniently disappears whenever anyone else shows up. If given the chance, he asks Mike, would he want to relive his seventeenth year and make different decisions? Mike says he would. Not long after, Mike drives across a bridge in a freak rainstorm and sees the janitor jump over the railing. Mike rushes to the edge, sees a bizarre whirlpool of light at the bottom, and falls in.

After returning to Ned's place the next morning, Mike is shocked to discover that he has been transformed into his seventeen-year-old self. Ned, quite familiar with fantasy archetypes, suggests that Mike has been changed in order to go on the proverbial hero's journey. Thinking this means another chance at a future in Basketball, Mike decides to pose as Ned's teenage son and go back to high school.

Adopting the alias Marc, he quickly befriends his own son and mentors him in the ways of Basketball. Alex has talent, but he suffers from a serious lack of confidence. This is mostly because of the team captain, a juvenile delinquent named Stan (Hunter Parish), who bullies Alex just because he has nothing better to do. Unfortunately, Stan is also Maggie's boyfriend, which means that Mike now has to be her mentor as well as Alex's. Ultimately, Mike's relies on his years of experience as a way to encourage his children, to inspire them to be more than they are.

Things take a complicated turn when he reunites with Scarlett and falls back in love with her. She, too, has feelings for him, especially since she can see the resemblance to her soon-to-be ex-husband. But a relationship is absolutely out of the question, and both of them know it; not only would it would be grossly inappropriate, it would also ruin Mike's new found sense of purpose.

And herein lies the theme of ""17 Again"": What if being transformed into a teenager had nothing to do with pursuing a Basketball scholarship? What if the journey is just as much a learning experience as it is an inspiring one? Mike is essentially getting to know his wife and children for the first time, and as such, he's finally beginning to realize just how great they are. In turn, he's learning more about himself and his ability to be a good father figure. But what good will it do if he's trapped in the body of a seventeen-year-old? Despite the fact that this movie is basically a good-natured fable made with the intention of making us laugh, there are moments when the more mature subtexts rise to the surface and give the audience more to think about. But make no mistake--this movie is, above all else, a family-friendly comedy. One of the most entertaining subplots involves Ned's attempts to woo the school Principal (Melora Hardin). You might think this would be impossible, given his affinity for all things science fiction and fantasy (he can speak Elfish fluently). But don't be so hasty; even the most hardboiled among us can have surprisingly similar interests.

I also enjoyed the juxtaposition of Mike's youthful appearance and his years of experience. Example: During the lunch period, Mike is able to one-up Stan, not by getting into a fight, but by proposing three different theories on why bullies behave the way they do, all while doing tricks with a basketball. And then there's an interesting scene in a sex ed class, where Mike preaches to Maggie and everyone else the importance of abstinence (in all likelihood, this was not a message the film was trying to send, but rather an instance of fatherly overprotection). Moments such as these made for a surprisingly entertaining film, one that presents itself as nothing more than an ordinary family comedy. Indeed, ""17 Again"" will appeal to younger audiences, especially if they're familiar with Efron's work in the ""High School Musical"" films. But because it explores family issues maturely, I think it's safe to say that older audiences will also get something out of it.",1240272000,2,5652,4.924449108079748
3734662,3,B001OQCUYS,"This was a pretty fun movie to watch. I like this particular type of story, so I knew going in that I'd have some fun with it.

Zac Efron is actually a decent actor, and he was far less orange in this movie than he typically is.

He had great chemistry with his costars, played the displaced middle aged guy pretty well, handled the fatherly vibe with his son and daughter in a believeable fashion.
My problems with the movie include:

1) Matthew Perry and Zac Efron look nothing alike.  I'm 26 years out of high school and while I don't look 17, I still look like my younger self.
Maybe David Cassidy should have been chosen for the older role, but then they would have had to go for a much older 'older role' which would have made the wife/kid attraction seriously creepy.

2) The mom hardly EVER interacted with her kids. She had some interaction/fondness for her son, but almost none with her daughter.  When the daughter and mother were together in scenes it was if they didn't know each other.  The daughter is dating a very inappropriate guy who behaves abusively to the son in their own house and neither parent was aware?

Overall, fun movie to watch.  Could have been far better if the writers had bothered to script a better plot.  Lack of back story on the characters made it hard to really understand the wife's rage, or the children's complete dismissal of the father.",1240185600,22,1382,4.492
3734663,4,B001OQCUYS,"Sure, this type of movie where bodies are switched has been redone through other movies Big, 18 Again, Freaky Friday. However, this movie was humorous, and had a touching message about being a parent. Parents could  relate to parts of the movie dealing with topics of  dating, sex and wanting the best for your child.  There are some unbelievable parts but you can't analyze the fantasy aspect of the movie.
  I recommend this movie to others because it's not a High School Musical spinoff or a complete duplicate of switched bodies. It's touching, funny and worth the $7 to go see. I thought Zac Efron did an awesome job. He made me laugh throughout the movie.  I'm not a teenager or raising a teen but this definitely is a must see for parents who have an adolescent.",1240099200,2,769,4.576642335766423

3734819,5,B001OQCUYS,"Released in 2009 and directed by Burr Steers, 17 Again stars Matthew Perry as a dispirited 37 year-old man about to lose his wife and high school sweetheart. Through a spirit-guide (Brian Doyle-Murray) he is miraculously able to become, you guessed it, 17 again. His younger self is played by Zac Efron, whos actually the star of the movie. Leslie Mann plays his soon-to-be former wife while Thomas Lennon appears as his geeky best friend. Sterling Knight & Michelle Trachtenberg are on hand as his kids struggling through the teen years. Melora Hardin plays the attractive principal while Nicole Sullivan has a glorified cameo.

This movie is magic from beginning to end, with few missteps. Its both a high school dramedy and a second chance fantasy. There are elements of films like Back to the Future (1986) and Peggy Sue Got Married (1986), but the uniqueness here is that the protagonist doesnt go back in time, but rather stays in the current day and appears to his family & friends as 17 years-old, even though hes really 37. With one exception, no one knows who he really is.

Efron, who was only 21 during filming, easily carries the film while Mann is one of the most winsome women to walk the Earth. Lennons amusing character is akin to the Big Bang Theory guys. Best of all, the film has heart, effectively conveying the triumphs and tragedies of the high school experience in all its glory and awkwardness. I know its clichd, but youll laugh, youll cry.

The movie runs 102 minutes and was shot in Santa Monica (Hayden High School), Van Nuys & Los Angeles, California. The script was written by Jason Filardi.

I am glad that this Zac Efron was more of the Disney-variety rather than the post-rehab version of himself.  Matthew Perry, Thomas Lennon and Leslie Mann were great supporting characters, and even if the plot was predictable, it had a feel-good ending.  It is always nice to watch these kind of movies with our pre-teen kids, because it reminds us that even through our animated arguments over chores and homework, there always remains the fact that we do care for each other, and that we love each other.  Sometimes, putting each other in each other's shoes helps with the compassion and understanding.

3735199,3,B001OQCUYS,"Pretend that seventeen and eighteen years old are close enough and that the old Jerry Lee Lewis/George Burns/Slim Whitman song didn't happen.  Pretend that you never saw or never heard of either of the ""Freaky Friday"" flicks, ""Big"" with Tom Hanks, or any other growing-younger or personality-switch movies.  If you can do that, you'll have a pretty good chance of liking the 2009 Blu-ray fantasy comedy ""17 Again.""  It's harmless enough, if rather predictable and safe.

The story begins in 1989.  Mike McDonnell (Zac Efron) is a senior in high school, the star player on his school's basketball team, expecting to get a scholarship to a major university, and dating Scarlett (Allison Miller), the cutest girl in town.  Life is good.  Then, just before the big game, with college scouts in the audience, Scarlett tells Mike that she's pregnant, and his whole life changes.

Flash forward twenty years.  Mike (played as an adult by Matthew Perry) never got the scholarship and never went to college, his wife Scarlett (played as an adult by Leslie Mann) has just kicked him out of the house, his two teenage kids want nothing to do with him, and his boss has passed him over for a promotion.  Life is not so good.  Where did he go wrong?  Ah, he thinks, if only he could go back and do it all over again.

Here we enter ""It's a Wonderful Life"" territory, complete with a magical school janitor (Brian Doyle-Murray), a ""spirit guide,"" to replace Clarence the angel.  And the next thing we know, Mike is seventeen again.

The thing is, it's not 1989.  It's still 2009.  It's just that Mike is seventeen, with a thirty-seven-year-old's mind and memory.  What to do?  He enlists the aid of his best friend, whom he's known since childhood, Ned Gold (Thomas Lennon), a nerd who became super rich in the software business.  Ned's still a dork, living alone, playing video games, and immersing himself in everything fantastical.  He's a hard-core ""Star Wars"" and ""Lord of the Rings"" fan, naturally, and everything in his house reflects it.  Frankly, he's the best thing in the movie; exaggerated, to be sure, but so eccentrically overstated that he's quite often more interesting than the main character.

Nobody recognizes the teenage Mike as the older Mike, since that would be crazy.  However, because Ned understands about supernatural stuff, he accepts that Mike has become suddenly younger and agrees to pretend being Mike's dad; together they enroll Mike in high school, where Ned immediately falls for the straightlaced, unattached principal, Jane Masterson (Melora Hardin).  The highlight of the film comes during a restaurant scene between Ned and Jane, a special, enchanting moment for which we can only have wished for more.

Now, what do you mean, Does Mike learn a lesson and set his life straight?  It's a Hollywood comedy, isn't it?  The movie may be from New Line, but Disney could have made it.  With director Burr Steers (""Igby Goes Down"") at the helm, Zac Efron (""Hollywood Musical,"" ""Hairspray"") in the lead, and Thomas Lennon in support, the film manages to make more of its flimsy premise than one might suppose possible.

Mike attempts to bond with his son (Sterling Knight), keep his daughter (Michelle Trachtenberg) away from a total moron boyfriend, and fix things up with his wife.  The situation comes close to creepy weird when the teenage Mike tries to kiss his much-older and unknowing spouse and when his teenage daughter starts to find him attractive, but these are innocent enough encounters.

The main thing is that the movie picks up steam as it goes along.  By the second half, its characters, messages, and situations settle into a more-mature and less-inflated state, bringing a few humorous junctures with them.  ""17 Again"" is not particularly a laugh-out-loud comedy, but it is a gently amusing one.

If the filmmakers had produced the film in the 1980's, it would no doubt have starred Michael J. Fox.  Not only does Zac Efron resemble Fox, he acts like him.  And ""17 Again"" is as innocuous as any movie or TV show Michael J. Fox ever made early on.  It really is a kind of time warp, and not a wholly unpleasant one.

Video:
New Line engineers had to squeeze a bit to get all of the movie and the high-def extras onto a single-layer BD25, but the VC-1 encode is adequately up the job.  We get the movie in its original theatrical-release aspect ratio of 2.40:1, so there's a lot to see.  Colors are fairly deep and rich, although they are also a trifle too dark much of the time.  Definition is slightly soft and overly smooth at times, while revealing a good deal of detail at other times; go figure.  As with many new movies, the screen is absolutely clean, perhaps too much so, giving the image a somewhat two-dimensional quality.  For a modern, lightweight comedy, it all works well enough.

Audio:
The Dolby TrueHD 5.1 audio track is surprisingly good when it wants to be, producing a thunderous bass and strong, wide dynamics.  Understandably, though, most of the time it deals strictly in dialogue.  Nevertheless, musical background numbers comes across with zest and authority, and on occasion the surrounds exhibit some fine environmental noises.  While I was not expecting much from the soundtrack, it often turned out to be agreeably alive.

Extras:
The New Line powers that be give you the works here in a two-disc set.  First, we have the extras on the Blu-ray disc, all of them exclusive to Blu-ray and most of them in high def.  There's ""Zac Goes Back"" (HD), a twelve-minute featurette with the filmmakers commenting on the movie's themes; ""Going Back to 17"" (HD), a three-minute featurette with more of the same; ""Breakin' Character Outtakes"" (HD), three minutes; ""Zac's Dance Flashback"" (HD), two minutes, a cut scene in rehearsal; a ""Tell-All Trivia Track"" with pop-up bits of trivia and gossip throughout the movie; and thirteen additional scenes in standard def, totaling about sixteen minutes.

Next up is a series of BD-Live features, requiring that you have your Blu-ray player connected to the Internet.  These features include a commentary by star Zac Efron; a featurette, ""Tom Lennon and Melora Hardin:  Unfiltered""; and another featurette, ""Zac Attacks,"" a battle with medieval sci-fi weapons between the movie's best friends, Mike and Ned.  Things conclude on the BD disc with twenty-four scene selections; trailers at start-up only; English as the spoken language; Spanish subtitles; and English captions for the hearing impaired.

Then we get a second disc that contains a digital copy of the film, compatible with iTunes and Windows Media devices; a regular, standard-definition DVD copy of the film; and a coupon for obtaining a fifth BD title free if you purchase five other Blu-ray titles.  A slipcover for the two-disc Blu-ray keep case ties it all together.

Parting Thoughts:
After more than a hundred years of screen comedies, it must be getting pretty hard to come up with anything fresh.  Often, the best we can hope for is something like ""17 Again,"" a slick, well-produced, well-acted retread.  For younger viewers who haven't seen many, or any, role-reversal fantasies, this one should go over just fine.  It's cute enough and generally inoffensive, with the Blu-ray high-definition picture and sound pleasing to the eye and ear.  For many of us, the film may seem a little tired, but there's no denying its sweetness and charm.",1432771200,,7406,4.913848631239936

There is a lot in this movie that draws off of ""Back to the Future"" and ""Karate Kid,"" and it creates this really nice atmosphere and likable story. This is the one movie I've seen where Zac Efron fit the role perfectly and did quite a good acting job. In every other movie, he seems miscast and like he's not that great of an actor. There is just such a verve and energy to this screenplay that it works really well. I have watched this movie five to ten times, and loved it every time. The directing was well executed as well, and the music was well chosen. This movie has a ton of heart, and is very fun to watch. I highly recommend it! Why did I only give it four stars? I save five stars for absolute classics, and there was an element to this movie that just made it feel like something on the Disney Channel. Not hating, just commenting that it knocked the seriousness down a notch. Four stars, no problem, and you really should watch this movie.",1427760000,,1008,4.201030927835052

3735272,5,B001OQCUYS,"One of Zac's best films and finest performances ever, playing the disgruntled father and husband gone back in time to his high school self revisited, trying to reach out to his son and daughter in the body of a student their age who also happens to be a basketball star, he tries to guide them both towards better lives then they have and learns more about them then he knew as their adult father. He also encounters his soon to be ex wife and realizes he's still in love with her, just in the wrong body and age to get close or romantic with her. Two scenes stand out in my mind, one where they're in health class talking about safe sex and he describes holding his newborn daughter for the first time, his delivery is so vivid I forgot he was acting and believed he had a child, later he talking with his teenage daughter who tells him she's giving up her college scholarship to be with her bully boyfriend because he's her forever, he becomes her adult father and forbids her to go through with her plan, but in his high school body he only makes her defensive and confused -the way he delivers his lines were so father like I felt them for the first time, as my own father was less than protective I never got that kind of speech until I heard Zac telling Margaret Sarah O'donnel there was no way in hell he was going to let her throw away her life for a loser like Stan, then near the end when his wife is in divorce Court he offers a teary eyed plea to stop her and it makes you cry along with him. A script is words on pages, it takes someone sensitive and real to be able to show the right emotions well enough that you feel them too, and for a guy to be able to do that is rare and truly amazing. When Zac has tears in his eyes, I have them too, and it doesn't make him less of a man, it's beautiful and honest and brave -I tend to push my emotions away, but I seem to feel his without any way of resisting, no one else has that effect on me, so I have to give him credit for his talent and performance in this movie, he's so much more than a body or handsome face, he's a gifted and talented actor, and in this movie it comes across clear and strong.

This movie kept the essence of the original story.  Zac Efron was new to me, but I found him appealing and talented.

Good movie without in-your-face sex, or gruesome violence.

However, I am personally annoyed with so many movies that show teenagers being disrespectful to and about their parents; acting dumb; being cruel and mean spirited; but the movie writers approve that behavior with lines like, ""They're teenagers"".  Why is that supposed to justify bad behavior?

Being a teenager should not be some excuse for not being & doing your best, showing respect where due, being responsible for one's own actions.

Maybe I am too old to understand, but it seems like movies are helping to create these types of young adults who will grow into the same type of adults.",1420416000,2,878,4.768211920529802

3735417,3,B001OQCUYS,"I use this title for my review because Friends star Matthew Perry appears briefly in this film, playing the older version of Zac Efron...by the way, I wonder how Zac Efron survived during the flashback to 1989...cell phones and Facebook didn't exist back then.  Anyway, after Matthew Perry's character is turned into Zac Efron...I mean, is turned into his younger self played by Zac Efron, he must repeat high school, keep his son from being bullied, avoid the attempted seduction from his daughter, and win back the love of his life, his wife, played by Leslie Mann, who is seeking a divorce...anyone else ready for therapy yet?  Overall, this film was all right.  It had it's laughs, though some of them, like everything between Thomas Lennon's and Melora Hardin's characters, were forced.  It's no snooze-fest, so I'll leave it to you as to if you wanna buy it.  I will say that I have seen many films with Leslie Mann in them and I've never been able to make up my mind about her...I'm concluding that I'll like or dislike her depending on the film.  She was good in this film, though I'd have liked to see some more interaction between her and Matthew Perry in the end (instead of that other couple).  Again, this is an average film and I'll leave the ultimate purchasing decision up to you.  Enjoy.",1380672000,,1304,4.639130434782609

Zac Efron was amazing in this role and did a great job of showing Mike falling in love with his wife all over again. His friend Ned's romance with the principal is zany and believable, and everyone was perfectly cast. I thought it would be a fluff movie, but it was amazingly deep and genuinely funny.

My one quibble is when Mike turns back into Matthew Perry. ""Why"" couldn't they have cast someone a little better looking? I felt really bad for both of them.",1376524800,,525,4.412371134020619

After watching a few other Efron movies and enjoying them, I decided to give this a chance again.

Matthew Perry pulls off the bitter aging guy who thinks his life peaked in high school very well. Thomas Lennon and Leslie Mann are wonderful as their respective characters.

3735500,4,B001OQCUYS,"Let's face it, most of us had unrealistic dreams, ambitions and goals for ourselves when we graduated from high school.  Life has a way of throwing us a big curve ball the sets us on a totally unexpected course.  When things don't click the way we invisioned them, we tend to see only the negative aspects of where that path took us.  To get a better perspective on things, it would help to get one last chance at being 17 again to see if our ambitions were realistic, for one thing, and also to see if those ambitions would have made us happy anyway.  What a wild and fun trip that would be.  That's exactly what this film delivers.  As I ponder my own failures in life sliding into middle age, I find myself watching this movie as motivation to look around at all the many blessings in my life and I'm energized to keep living and loving it.  It also doesn't hurt that the film captures Zac Efron at his most beautiful just before he started thickening for more manly roles. We will never see this hearthrob in all his skinny jeans and shaggy hair glory again.  And whoever thought Efron could hold up his end of the bargain when paired with the comic timing genius of a Mathew Perry, but astonishingly he does. Perry and the 2nds in the cast do just as good of a job spreading the comic fairy dust to make this all believable. In fact, thanks to the cast and deft storytelling, this flim soars and I fell in love with it just as I did another high school time travel tale- Back To The Future.  As the DVD has a few extra minutes of trimmings that you don't see in the cable tv version and the fact that it's such a pleasure to view it without commercial interruption, this one is a must have.",1348617600,,1695,4.255451713395638

I can usually find the redemptive side of any film but this one simply doesn't have a clue.  Oh, yeah, include a bit of ""Clueless"" in this begged, borrowed and stolen waste of a movie.  There are so many writers out there with original ideas who could craft at least a decent if not good film but this is not one of them.  A pastiche of frames pasted together adding up to nothing.

3735505,5,B001OQCUYS,"While the switching bodies film has been done before, I found this to be a nice addition to that genre. Zac Efron is hilarious and when paired with Thomas Lennon, they make a great comic duo. Also, there are several scenes in which Zac shows what a good actor he is. There is an especially touching scene in a courthouse in which Zac has to show his vulnerability, and he does this extremely well. Overall, very enjoyable and watchable. If you are a Zac Efron fan, you'll love it. If you aren't a fan, you'll become one after watching this film. I know the critics were not overly enthusiastic about this movie, but I think male heterosexual critics have a hard time praising anything Zac Efron does. It may have something to do with his looks or his fan base of teenage girls; as if someone that teenage girls like couldn't possibly have any acting skills. The same critics loved Ryan Gosling in Drive, in which Mr. Gosling, although in general a very good actor, pretty much has one look the entire film. His acting style in this film consisted of him staring very intently and delivering his lines. He's practically a zombie throughout the film and these critics couldn't fall over themselves fast enough in praising his performance and the film, which was an excuse to show egregious violence and to show in great grisly detail how to kill people in many different ways.",1342051200,4,1374,4.612244897959184

There are the usual stupid premises.  For example, even his about to be divorced wife isn't really sure he looks a lot like the boy she married.  It isn't until the end of the movie that she breaks out a picture.  The always effective Leslie Mann plays the now grown up wife and surprise...Zac Efron does a nice job in the 17 year old body of Matthew Perry.  Pleasant and harmless stuff.

He gets a shot to correct his past mistakes with her and his kids.  Thomas Lenn plays his longtime buddy Ned who has his own subplot going on as he attempts to woo [Zac's] High School Principal played hilariously by Melora Hardin.

3735520,5,B001OQCUYS,"The Plot
Mike O'Donnell is a married adult with two teenage kids and wife who is finalizing her divorce with Mike.  All of a sudden, in some mysterious magical way, Mike is tranformed into a teenager and he goes back to high school to relive his glory days as a basketball star.  The adult Mike is played by Matthew Perry and the young ""17 Again"" Mike is played by Zac Efron.

The Acting
This movie is obviously meant as a showcase for Zac Efron.  He demonstrates his incredible basketball skills, as well as his fine acting talent in this comedy. There are numerous comedic situations involving young Mike, including scenes with his son.  For example, in a reversal of roles, the son corrects the father, especially when young Mike ogles his older wife.  Too much looking and young Mike gets a rap in the head with a basketball or gets squirted with water from his son.

Leslie Mann plays the wife and mom, and she does it with a delicate balance.  Mom, (Ms. O' Donnell), is gracious and usually keeps just enough distance from young Mike to make it believable.  Ms. Mann's acting is nuanced and her character is soft, gentle, and slightly off balanced, but in a sweet and ditzy way.

The Smackdown
Smack. Smack. Smack. Smack. Smack. Smack. Smack. Smack. Count them. That's a total of eight smacks.  I was cracking up when young Mike was smacked in the face by his wife, his daughter, three beautiful teenage girls, and by his nerdy, best friend.  I just had to watch these scenes again and again as it was just so funny.

The End

I really can't believe I just said all that, since walking into this movie I expected to find it mundane and worthless.  I actually really liked this movie, like a lot.

Sure, it's predictable, but in a charmingly fresh way.

The film tells the story of Mike, a one-time basketball star who gave up his dreams to marry his pregnant girlfriend.  Twenty years later and Mike is bitter and dissatisfied with his life, which has weighed heavily on his wife Scarlett, who feels like the target of Mike's unhappiness.  The film opens with Mike living at his best friend Ned's house while he awaits his impending divorce.  Mike's teenage kids resent him and his wife is aching to love him, but her better judgment won't allow it.  When Mike gets a freaky visit from a man no one else can see he is soon in for a strange yet much needed wake up call.  After falling off a bridge, Mike finds himself 17 again, only this time he's living out his high school days in the present, with his wife and kids in arms reach.  Taking this as an opportunity to fix his life, Mike begins mending relationships, but his current situation certainly makes it a tad difficult.

You don't need me to tell you that everything works out in the end, but the film works a lot of magic getting us there!

Personally, I didn't have much faith in Zac Efron.  I was wrong.  This kid has loads of charm and real talent that he uses to full effect here.  The films more tender scenes are carried with the needed humor yet substantial emotional depth.  Who wasn't near tears while Efron unloads in a classroom about the love he felt for his newborn daughter or when he pleaded in the courtroom for his wife to give him another chance?  Efron NAILED this performance.  He was slick, charming, cool and emotionally relevant.  The supporting cast didn't do so bad either.  Thomas Lennon (as the nerdy best friend) is ridiculously hilarious here, even when his character is a little too far over the top, and Leslie Mann is not only beautiful, but she is intelligently funny (I just love her work).  Michelle Trachtenberg is like my new celebrity crush (man has she grown up) and Sterling Knight balances his awkwardness with layered bravado as Mike's son.

Yes, this story has been told before, but that doesn't mean this one isn't just as good as the others.  It's far from what I expected, but that is a very good thing.",1287100800,5,2534,4.49671772428884

In ""17 Again"" - a sort of cross between ""Big"" and ""Back to the Future"" - Mike O'Donnell is a soon-to-be-divorced father of two whose early dreams of one day becoming a star basketball player were shattered in high school when his girlfriend informed him she was pregnant with his child.  Now, in his 30s, Mike gets the unprecedented chance to start over when he finds himself inexplicably back in his 17-year-old body after plunging into a river.  He immediately re-enrolls in high school, the same one his children now attend, in an attempt to both reignite his truncated basketball career and keep an eye on his kids and help them overcome their various teen-related issues and problems.  And after years spent bemoaning the life of athletic glory he never got to experience, Mike learns that there's really nothing more important in life than being a good husband and father to one's family.

Despite game performances from the two Mikes (Matthew Perry and Zac Efron), ""17 Again"" suffers from an ill-conceived premise, labored slapstick routines, and an overabundance of sappy life lessons to go along with all the standard teen-movie hijinks.  There may also be a few too many incest and underage-sex jokes for some people's comfort.  Since the concept was handled far more skillfully in those two previously referenced films (not to mention ""Freaky Friday,"" ""18 Again,"" and a whole host of similar-themed works), my advice would be to rent one of those and skip ""17 Again"" altogether.",1275091200,2,1496,4.96

This film reminded me of so many of those 80's high school comedies with the body switching premise. The film is not very original, but Zac Efron carries the story with some help from a good cast that keep it amusing. The story of a would be basket ball star (Efron) blows his big chance at playing college ball and getting a scholarship to marry his high school sweetheart who he gets pregnant. Fast forward 20 years and you have Matthew Perry who is stuck in a nowhere job and can't seem to find any passion in his life whether it be fixing up the house, being a good dad or not making his wife feel guilty for the choice he made to leave the big game to propose to her.

While the film is oh-so familiar, I thought Efron was engaging and with the help of comedians Jim Gaffigan and Thomas Lennon, the film is an easy watch with some funny moments.

3735540,3,B001OQCUYS,"Mike O'Donnell (Zac Efron and Matthew Perry) was a star basketball player in high school destined to get a scholarship for college. But when he misses a big game when he runs off with his girlfriend, Scarlett (Leslie Mann and Allison Miller), he misses his chance for college stardom. Fast forward several years later, Mike's on the verge of divorce, is all but hated by his two kids, Alex (Sterling Knight) and Maggie (Michelle Trachtenberg), and is dreaming of the days in high school when he could have made more of his life. But one day, when going to pick up his kids from high school, he runs into a janitor who seemingly grants his wish to go back to high school and relive his high school dreams.

Let's face it, the premise of someone switching bodies, transforming into an older person, and vice versa has become a tired premise. There's been 13 Going On 30, Freaky Friday (which has been done twice), 18 Again!, and of course the best of the lot Big with Tom Hanks. Naturally, when this came out I don't think many people expected anything earth shatteringly original, but, instead, all eyes were on Zac Efron. Could Efron carry a movie that was beyond the Disney tween audience? Can he actually act outside of the High School Musical movies that made him a star?

The answer, while not resounding, is a definitive yes. We'll have to wait for something else to come along to see if he can be a grown up actor, but he does equip himself well in this movie. While you see Efron play the part at the beginning of the movie, Matthew Perry picks up the part fairly early and carries the part for a little bit. When Efron picks the part back up after a little bit, he does a very good job of mimicking some of Perry's mannerisms, allowing you to get lost in the idea that these two actors are really the same character. The one performance that really stood out in my mind, the actor who really stole every scene he was in, was really Thomas Lennon as Mike's high school friend/ nerd Ned Gold. Thomas Lennon plays the perfect eccentric, just far enough over the top, but not too far playing the character wryly rather than just as a clown.

As far as the rest of the movie goes, 17 Again gets extra credit for making fun of it's premise. After a Star Wars spoofing fight, when Ned realizes that Mike has come back as his 17 year old counterpart, he says, ""It's a classic transformation story. Are you now or have you ever been a Norse God, Vampire, or Time Traveling Cyborg?"" But of course, while it may have some interesting moments, for the most part 17 Again deals with the same tired concept, and the same tired messages as every other body transformation movie. This is a sub genre that feels almost as if you've seen one, you've seen them all.

All in all, I'd actually have to say that this movie might have just enough new, and the performances are good enough that this might just be worth your time. I suggest at least giving it as a try for a rental if not a buy. Of course if you're a fan of the transformation story, you'll most likely want to go ahead and buy it, or if you're a big fan of Zac Efron.

3735541,5,B001OQCUYS,"17 Again is probably the best family film you can possibly ask for.  The swear words are usually mild so kids, teens and adults can enjoy it as a family.

I was laughing several times throughout the movie.  Of course the storyline is completely fictional because it's impossible for one person to actually turn back time and be 17 years old all over again, but for storyline reasons, it's a good one.

The storyline flows flawlessly, so there's never any confusion over what's going on.

The story is about a married man on the verge of a divorce who reflects back to his teenage years and when he was a star player on his high school basketball team.

He believes he regrets getting his high school sweetheart pregnant, and believes he should have aimed for that basketball scholarship instead.

While he reflects back to his teenage years, an old man appears (dressed as a janitor, but secretly holds the key to the fountain of youth).  Eventually the man actually transforms back to his teenage years, and this is when the story picks up BIG time.

As a 17-year old teenager, he actually goes back to high school where he sees his son being picked on by bullies, and his daughter having creepy losers for boyfriends.  When he steps in and tries to defend his son and daughter against the bullies and losers, well, his son and daughter don't realize their classmate is actually their father, and that's what makes the film so hilarious.

An even bigger part of the storyline is how he tries hitting on his wife as a 17-year old teen.  The wife of course, thinks there's a startling resemblance between the teen and her ex-husband, but for most of the film, she doesn't think there's anything more to it than just that- an amazing coincidence.

Anyway, I laughed several times while watching this movie, and I recommend it to just about anybody who enjoys solid comedy and great storytelling.",1266019200,2,1893,4.6656626506024095
3735542,5,B001OQCUYS,"This movie is a delightful romp with a lot to offer.  Zac Efron is amazing in his part as Mike, with talent to burn.  He's sweet but takes no prisoners when dealing with ruffians, and his moves on the dance floor and his agility with a basketball are equally impressive.  He demonstrates his acting chops in this movie as well, going from winsome to tough to romantic and all-around likeable without ruffling a feather.

Thomas Lennon as his quirky Star Wars sidekick is hilarious and adorable.  His role is more than a supporting one, as his storyline is given more space than one might expect, but it adds a lot to the movie's humor and keeps it lighter than it would be with the sometimes gritty problems that Mike faces with his children's issues and the difficulties of trying to recapture his wife's love.

Matthew Perry's part is too small to do him justice, but he fulfills it well.  The movie focuses mainly on Zac Efron's part in regaining what the adult Mike, played by Perry, cannot get back on his own.

This movie is so enjoyable that you're willing to suspend disbelief when you need to.  Mike's wife, for example, seeing him exactly as he looked when he was a teenager, is very slow in picking up on the fact that he IS her husband as a teenager, and she seems blandly accepting of the story concocted by Lennon's character that the young Mike is his son.  Of course, the transformation from 30-year-old to 17-year-old Mike is another leap, but the movie is so engaging that you don't mind.  Watching Mike get back at the bullies picking on his teen children is satisfying, and his efforts to extricate himself from sticky situations are humorous.

Anyone who ever thinks about those teen years and wishes there were a way to go back and relive them again will enjoy this movie.  There's plenty of action, some tender moments, and enough craziness to keep you thoroughly entertained.  It gets my vote, and I'll definitely watch it again.",1265587200,11,1953,4.6231884057971016

This is a movie about a man that gets to take a second look at his life, and in taking stock, is able to gain the perspective he needs to fix things.  A father's view of teenage sexuality is particularly well handled.

Zac Efron handled the role capably.  I wasn't expecting much of him, but he is a more than decent actor that handled an unusual role with real grace and skill.

Now for the nitty-gritty.

For once the supporting male friend (Thomas Lennon) is fun and quirky instead of crass and crude. Win.

The storyline is sweet. At age 17 Mike (Perry/Efron) gives up his dreams to do the right thing. While college scouts wait in the bleachers to be dazzled by his basketball genius, his girlfriend paces on the sidelines. Mike makes her tell him what was wrong, she does and Mike walks off the court, out of his dreams and into reality. Unfortunately, what he gave up consumes him. In a Wonderful Life/ 13 Going on 30 chance to revisit age 17, Mike faces high school with his own kids and having to rebuild his popularity the hard way. He develops caring relationships with his teens and rediscovers his wife on a whole new level.  Win.

Sex and partying among teens happens. Refreshingly, other than a few off-color remarks (including Mike's job as a drug representative for a Viagra-type product, most is off-screen and low key. When the teen Mike sits through sex-ed he shares his conservative views on sex while the teacher passes out condoms, even suggesting that it needs to be between people who love each other and it's about things like being mature enough to recognize the value of children and real love and commitment. Win.

Overall, this is a sweet movie with a big heart. Not earth-shatteringly brilliant, but rich.",1262736000,3,1485,4.7587548638132295

3735559,4,B001OQCUYS,"It's 1989, and for 17-year-old high school star Mike O'Donnell the future looks brilliant. High school as his personal Camelot and flaunting exceptional skills at hoops, Mike is about to put on a show on the basketball court, for his fans and for that all-important college scout on the bench. But here's his gorgeous girlfriend and she's just given him a shocking reality check. And, just like that, there go the fame and fortune, Mike's future now narrowed down to one simple choice. Mike chooses to do the right thing, marries his girl who is expecting.

It's 2009 now and we find Mike O'Donnell a discontented, out-of-shape loser of a family man. Two decades he's been married to his high school sweetheart, and the fallout to this are crippling regrets and a perception of potential having been wasted. That is how Mike sees it. Now his wife Scarlett is about to divorce him, and he's woefully out of touch with his two teenaged kids. The final straw comes when his 16 years of service at the firm is rewarded by his being skipped over for a big promotion (the extra scoop of shame comes in losing that promotion to a girl who was hired only two months ago).

But Mike is about to get a do-over. In one of those messed-up, unconvincing plot devices, Mike plummets into the river and magically sheds twenty years. Seventeen again, Mike has this idea of rebooting his life or maybe fixing his life. He enrolls in his old high school, now being attended by his two troubled, disaffected children. But Mike is unprepared for how drastically high school life has changed. Once the coolest dude in the classroom, Mike O'Donnell finds himself languishing outside the popular loop.

I caught 17 AGAIN last night on cable TV. I wasn't jonesing to see this flick when it was out in the theater, mostly because I've seen variations of this fantasy premise before, and seen it done well in movies like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Big-Extended-Edition/dp/B000LC4ZF8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Big (Extended Edition)</a>, both versions of FREAKY FRIDAY (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Freaky-Friday-2-pack-1977-2003-Versions/dp/B0001XAPVA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Freaky Friday 2-pack (1977 & 2003 Versions)</a>), and even in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vice-Versa/dp/B0001GOH84/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vice Versa</a>. But, it turns out, 17 AGAIN is a well-constructed family flick, surprisingly watchable and able to bring a freshness to this old tale. Zac Efron steps away from being a featured song & dance puppet in the HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL franchise. Not that he gets edgy or street gritty all of a sudden, but it's nice to see the kid get off the Disney factory treadmill. Efron is still a teen idol and 17 AGAIN is still very much in that girl heartthrob wheelhouse, but at least it's a bit different and this time he gets a chance to play with established grown-up actors. Having said that, in the opening scene, Efron treats the movie audience to an ""All the girls drool now"" moment as he goes thru a shirtless workout in the school gym. Zac Efron definitely has got charm and he's even credible when demonstrating the unhip sensibilities of a dad on the pessimistic side of 30. And, in those scenes calling for emotional depth, he shows surprising range; he even sounds sincere as he dispenses parental advice to his ""peers."" Maybe the kid's got the chops to last.

Matthew Perry happens to be a favorite of mine, and it's a shame that his film career hasn't taken off, post-FRIENDS. He's not in this movie much; he plays the adult Mike O'Donnell . But he manages to do that thing he does, which is play characters who are sarcastically witty but uncomfortable in their own skins. The wonderful, lovely Leslie Mann shows up, and she's predictably wonderful and lovely. Thomas Lennon, as Mike's peculiar best friend, lends the film an influx of nerd oddity. And for Michelle Trachtenberg, it's nice to see that there's life after BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER.

It's not that startling that the narrative beats are contrived. Much of the humor is predictable, making that extra layer of quirk that much more welcome. As mentioned, the quirky element comes in the shape of Mike's best pal who happens to be one of those differently-wired cats and who should just never be let out in public because he is that socially inept. It's twisty fun, though, keeping up with his courtship (or - let's not talk falsely now - stalking) of the icy but kinda hot high school principal. Lest all nerds lose hope, realize that even the most aloof of goddesses may wave a freak flag. So cue the seductive dinner conversation, but in Elvish. Later, the sexy principal coyly extends an offer: ""You can plunder my dungeon anytime."" Mike's weird friend responds with: ""I'll bring my longbow."" Oh, unholy nerdgasm. The film also flirts with a case of the icky but, thankfully, doesn't follow thru. You'll see what I'm talking about.

And as if we weren't already aware, the movie comments on the pervasiveness of today's communication devices. No sooner is Mike pummeled by a school bully than the beating is posted on YouTube and shared thru everyone's cellies.

It's a bit huh? that the high school coach, who was Mike's coach 20 years past, doesn't ever mark the eerie similarities between Mike now and Mike ago. But, despite that and all the cliches and despite the lame inclusion of the janitorial guardian angel, 17 AGAIN supplies enough grace notes to resonate with just about everyone, but especially with us middle-agers drowning in nostalgia. Ah, wedgies, doing someone else's homework, and relinquishing one's lunch money... who knew my stroll down memory lane would be so rosy? Excuse me, please, while I go cry into a big pillow.",1259539200,3,5852,5.127882599580713

Mrs. Donnell decides to set forth a divorce and to take the kids Alex and Maggie.  Mr. Donnell then stumbles into the highschool and meets this old weird janitor, later on Mr. Donnell would be 17 again. The teen Mr.  Donnell (Zac Efron) now has the opportunities to reshape and diligently rebuild the directions for his kids, and at the same time develop the opportunities to stop the divorce. Of course he didn't do all this alone... he is just a teen...but his best friend, Ned Gold (Thomas Lennon) an adult will help aide Mr. Donnell in his adventures.

I was really worried that this flashback adventure would be predictable and only mildly funny, but it was pleasantly surprising and full of good humor. Leslie Mann and Matthew Perry are two of my favorite actors so it was nice to see them starring as the romantic leads, but it stinks that Perry didn't get as much screen time as Mann. I hope to see Perry in more movies soon...I miss his comic stylings.

But even in that case its the parents who should be in control of their kids viewing.

Mr Efron (I can see why he fuels teeny fantasies) actually can act.  Has great light comedic timing and carries the drama well.  He could go places if his handlers are savvy enough to put him in the right movies.  The plot has been done before many times and will no doubt be done again (since it is a perennial adolescent fantasy).

3735586,4,B001OQCUYS,"This was a pretty good film for the most part, and it actually was a lot better than what I was expecting.  The age regression theme is definitely something that has been done a lot over time, and figured this film really would not be anything really special.  However, I was pleasantly surprised, and the film was a good one.  I really was impressed by Efron's performance as he interacted very well with his co-stars, and I also agree with the earlier review that Efron did an excellent job playing a displaced middle-aged guy in a modern teenager's body.  The chemistry between the Matthew Perry/Zac Efron character and his Star Wars loving friend, who was played by Thomas Lennon, was hilarious, and the interaction between Efron and that character really made the film great and created most of the funny moments.  I also loved the subplot of how the Thomas Lennon character was trying to woo the principal of the school and his various failed attempts at first.  It definitely was a shocker when the principal turned out to be a female version of the Thomas Lennon character!  This film really does make one think what any of us would do if we had the chance to take a Mulligan and redo portions of our life with high school often being one of the most important parts.  While I thought the plot at times was kind of stretched the good acting on the part of Efron and and Thomas Lennon along with the lady who played the principal was made this worth seeing.

My issues with the film are the following:

1)  I would have done more background on Matthew Perry/Zac Efron character post high school so that the viewers could understand why his marriage did not work and why his kids did not care for him.  It appears that the character was quite popular and hip in high school but ended up becoming quite a square by middle age.  It would have been good if there was more time devoted to showing how the older character (Matthew Perry) was out of touch while also showing him as really liking his family.  The thing that kind of confused me about the main character is that he was so clueless about how his kids were really like, and it would have been good if there was some way to better show the disjoint between what he thought was true and what reality is.  I would have definitely added another scene or two between the Matthew Perry character and the kids to better understand why the kids did not care for him.

2)  I would have definitely toned down the daughter character as she was really over the top in terms of her promiscuity.  I would have made the daughter more of a character being concerned about being popular and fitting in rather than the school tramp.

3)  I also agree with the earlier review that the mother character really did not interact much with the kids, and it would have been good if there was something more done there.

4)  The spiritual guide/janitor who apparently granted the Matthew Perry character's wish to return to his high school days really should have been given a bit more background and interacted with the characters.  Granted, this character is a minor one, but it still would have been nice if he was an actual guide during the film rather than simply an omniscient observer who appeared two or three times over the course of the whole film.

5)  While it was funny watching Efron acting like a middle-aged guy I think there were times the children and wife characters were creeped out by him.  I think it would have been better if the Efron character was more like a teenager and acted the part while talking like a middle aged with his friend kind of like how the Scott Bakula character was like during show ""Quantum Leap"" with his being the person in question during his ""leap"" while talking normally with his friend when alone.  I would have even added more flesh to the spiritual guide character with his being the person following Efron around and talking to him during the moments when he needed to be an adult.  Basically, I think it would have been better if the son and daughter characters became Efron's actual friends as opposed to being creeped out by him during parts of the film.

6)  As for the film's conclusion, it would have been nice if the main character's family instead of just the wife knew that Zac Efron was actually Matthew Perry.  I think it would have been really funny to see the kids' reaction to finding out that they were actually with their father the whole time kind of like Sally Field's reaction in the film ""Mrs. Doubtfire"" when she figured out her ""nanny"" was actually her ex-husband played by Robin Williams.

In short, this was a very good film, and I would not have taken the time to write this if I did not think it was worthy of commentary.  This film is entertaining and is fun, and the acting by Efron and Lennon as well as the cameo appearance by Matthew Perry all were done well.  Hopefully, if this film is ever remade, then some plot gaps can be filled in to make an otherwise good film even better.",1252108800,,5004,4.492817679558011

how the direction of this film went.  Good smart script, good acting usually presents a good movie, and because the silly scenes or situations were kept
at a minimum this became a very good movie.

3735588,3,B001OQCUYS,"Having never seen High School Musical, I wasn't sure what to expect from this Zac Efron. He was actually a decent actor. Casting Matthew Perry though as his future self was very....ODD. As another reviewer stated, they look nothing alike and most of us in our 30s and 40s still look a little like our high school senior photo. Matt isn't the one selling this film so I don't know why they would choose him unless he was already on board for the project and Zac Efron was a last minute replacement? But anyway, the film is entertaining if you have nothing else to watch but its also very predictable. I disagree about the content warning from some of the reviewers. There's nothing in this movie for parents to worry about unless your kid has been living in a cave or you're Amish. There is much more raunchier things shown on the CW network and on regular television. Zac Efron fans I assume will just love seeing his face in anything so I'm sure they'll love it. Its all good fun. I recommend it for the family.",1251590400,3,1012,4.4171122994652405
3735589,5,B001OQCUYS,this is a fun movie that never pretends to be anything its not. zac efron proves he can carry a movie while thomas lennon steals the entire film. it has some surprisingly funny moments as well as some surprisingly emotional ones as well. its much better than anyone could expect but also exactly what its supposed to be.,1251590400,,320,4.5344827586206895
3735590,4,B001OQCUYS,"This movie is being pushed as all Zac Efron. Fortunately for Zac, he has a very good supporting cast that keep him from falling flat. The fact that this release comes with not only the Blu-ray edition, but a standard definition DVD and a digital copy adds to its value that may push it from being just a rental to worth purchasing.

I didn't look at the latter two, since the Blu-ray version was all that I was interested in. The picture quality is very good, without any artifacts or edge enhancement problems to be found. The Dolby TrueHD audio track is also surprisingly good. Many times, comedies aren't good movies for getting decent sound, but when the movie calls for it, the subwoofer and the surround channels get a chance to perform.

The extras aren't bad, but unless you're in love with Zac Efron and/or you just have to see more of the movie, no matter what, they're largely forgettable. The BD-Live extras aren't all that much better, except for the fact that this is the first WB title I've seen to contain a ""My Commentary"" segment, which was recorded by Thomas Lennon, Zac Efron, and Melora Hardin. It's actually funny to watch them rip on each other and recount the movie as it's playing.

The movie itself is a Zac Efron vehicle. It features him on the cover, it calls him out in the corner of the packaging (Packed with Zac!), and even the extras highlight the fact that the screenplay was rewritten specifically for Zac Efron to play the lead. We've seen this kind of movie before, and its themes have been covered much better by those that preceded it, so then it falls onto the performances of the cast to make it better than mediocre. While Efron doesn't do a bad job, his supporting cast saves the movie from mediocrity. Thomas Lennon elevates every scene he's in, and the chemistry between Matthew Perry and Leslie Mann is very good as well.

For most people, this might be a rental, but if you're on the fence, the extras make it worth the purchase. You can read more about this disc on The BigScreen Cinema Guide!",1251331200,,2041,4.538043478260869

3735592,3,B001OQCUYS,"First, my excuse: as my title indicates, this movie was my wife's pick, not mine.

A guy chose responsibility instead of opportunity back in high school, but he always regretted the missed opportunity, so he's been rather apathetic and grouchy ever since.  He's now middle-aged and is suddenly restored to his 17-year-old body (keeping his middle-aged mind) and goes back to his high school.  This enables him to apply his life experience to do some things differently and set some things right.  In the process, he gains a new appreciation for his wife and kids and the importance of his role as a husband and father.  He also comes to realize that he's been foolishly acting like a victim all those years after high school, instead of taking responsibility for his decisions and his life.  Having learned these things, he's restored back to middle age and vows not to waste the rest of his life.

That's pretty much it for the general plot and the lessons of the movie.  Beyond that, this ""cute"" movie is mostly light entertainment, and is a (mildly funny) comedy more than anything else.

I certainly won't watch this movie again, and I wish I had spent the time watching something with more substance, but I guess the movie wasn't awful.  Nevertheless, lesson learned for next time ...",1251244800,2,1289,4.7657657657657655

And they did.

Though this didn't receive 'rave' critical review, it was quite cute and highly entertaining.  The cast was well assembled and Zach Efron was surprisingly funny, especially opposite ""Lt. Dangle"" (Tom Lennon).

I actually read a review somewhere that Efron lacked 'edge' in this role...ummm, what?  Was 'edge' really necessary?  I didn't think so.  He was adorable and funny and what more does one need for entertainment?

I watched this with my husband and mother-in-law and we all agreed to its entertainment value as qualifying as 'cute and funny'.",1251158400,6,775,4.945736434108527

I thought this would be a poser knock off trying to capitalize on Efrons popularity with a younger crowd.  I was surprized.  This a very entertaining movie.  I think the studio made a huge mistake in overbilling Efron.  They might as well called it the Zack Efron movie!  That is not to say he didn't do a good job.  He did.  TV child stars are notorious for being over hammy on the big screen.  I think he showed that he is capable of being a legitimate movie actor.  The rest of the cast really make this show as well.

3735606,4,B001OQCUYS,"Life has not gone well for Mike O'Donnell (Matthew Perry).  His wife Scarlett (Leslie Mann) has kicked him out.  His kids, Maggie (Michelle Trachtenberg) and Alex (Sterling Knight) want nothing to do with him.

When he tells the janitor at the high school he'd love to go back and do it all again, he suddenly finds himself back in his 17 year old body (now played by Zac Efron).  Getting his best friend Ned (Thomas Lennon) to claim to be his father, he enrolls in high school.  But why has Mike become 17 again?  Can he solve all his problems with a second chance?

I guessed going into this where the story was going, and I was right.  Heck, the age changing movie is nothing new.  But this movie offers an enjoyable take on the familiar premise.  It's funny at times and tender at others.  And the humor doesn't reach too far into the awkward humor bucket, something I find more cringe inducing than funny most of the time.

When I first heard about the casting, I did have to question it.  Zac Efron and Matthew Perry?  Seriously?  But I think I am thinking about a fantasy comedy too seriously.  The entire cast gives good performances, ranging from the funny to the more serious and tender moments.

A special shout to Thomas Lennon and the character of Ned.  He made the film for me.  I laughed so hard at Ned reveling in his geekiness.  And Thomas Lennon played the part absolutely perfectly.

As I suspected from the PG-13 rating, there is plenty of sexual humor over the course of the film.  I did find myself laughing at parts of it despite myself, but other times I found it more squirm inducing than funny.  Parents will definitely want to think about it before they let their pre-teens and young teens see it.

Honestly, I think the movie could have been just as funny and more enjoyable for me without the sexual humor.  Even as it is, this is an enjoyable comedy.",1249948800,4,1880,4.458823529411765

Determined to make the right decision, he skips the game and declares that his future is spending the rest of his life with her and raising their child.

""17 Again"" is nothing new.  In fact, it has been done better many times before.  This is clearly a starring vehicle for Efron, who is moderately charming and successful in the role.  The story could have been written better, but seems dumbed down for the younger audience that would come to see Efron on film.  I really cannot recommend this film.",1244419200,3,952,4.408045977011494
3735610,4,B001OQCUYS,"There seems like so much I could say about this movie.  My initial thoughts are:
-Too adult in nature for Zac Efron's kid fans
-Has good themes and messages
-Most of the funny parts are in the previews

17 Again is one of those half and half films--half of it is good, moral, and entertaining, and half of it is raunchy, mature in nature, and unnecessary.  The plot goes something like this: Middle-aged Mike is unhappy with his life and about to get a divorce from his wife.  He and his kids are like strangers to each other, even though he genuinely cares for them.  One night Mike mysteriously transports to the age of 17 in present times.  He decides (with the help of his MAJOR sci-fi freak best friend) to go back to high school and help put his kids on the right path.  So Mike (under the name of Mark) goes back to school and spends his time lecturing his kids about who they should date, helping them onto sports teams, or romancing their mom (who is also his wife).

Some of the funniest parts are the most awkward ones.  Teenage Mike/Mark dancing with his wife (to his wife, he is just her son's friend) and being found by their son.  Mike/Mark's daughter wants to start a relationship with the teenage Mike/Mark, not knowing that he is actually her dad.  When he tells her that they can never be together, she at first thinks that he is gay.  There is one use of the b-word and some other mild profanities.  Mike/Mark's daughter has a pompous, lustful boyfriend.  Mike's best friend is seen in bed (fully clothed) with the school principal (at the end of the film, right before the credits).

I was surprised at the amount of good messages in this movie.  Mike (when he is actually 17 in high school sometime in the 1980's) gives up his college dreams to marry his pregnant girlfriend.  When he is an adult, he strives to spend time with his kids and shows genuine interest in their lives.  When he goes back to the age of 17 through the warp thing, he makes it his goal to help his kids get their lives on the right track.  He speaks about abstinence to the entire Health class.  He does everything he can to get his daughter's messed-up boyfriend away from her.

Without the sexual jokes and overtones, this movie would be great for kids and teens.  Unfortunately, the crude humor ruins it, even if kids don't understand all of the ""jokes"".  Zac Efron is at his best in this film and captures a sensible, struggling teenage dad very well.  Don't expect it to be any funnier than you see in the previews, though.  Most of the funny parts are in the previews.  Overall, it was an enjoyable two hours of reliving high school.",1241308800,16,2636,4.428274428274428

10 Lessons I Learned From 17 Again
1. Scriptwriters seemed to have run out of ideas, so eighties movie plots are being recycled.  I noticed this watching the trailers, too.  People my age are in need of being taught life lessons that we didn't learn the first time around, so we're going back to the future.  (Note to future directors: Stop.  Stop already, please.  Or if you do so, use lots of irony. Just a suggestion.  ""Back to the Future"" had a lot of in jokes, but ""17 Again"" squanders many chances to be funny.)
2. If you were alive in the eighties, you'll recognize quite a few recycled scenes including ones from ""Back to the Future,"" ""Just One of the Guys,"" and the original ""17 Again.""  Presumably the switch in age was so there could be a college application storyline.  However, if you do the math, they've done some time fudging here.  That's the second thing you'll notice.  The first is the seeming miracle of Zac Efron turning into Matthew Perry.
3. Taking responsibility for one's actions as a teen will make you extremely miserable in the future.  The best thing to do is put yourself and your needs first.
4. When you're in high school, everything seems like the end of the world.  But you're really just beginning your life.  Actually, I learned this one already, but it's a good message anyway.
5. Hitting on your friend's mom is no longer considered cool, at least in the Disneyverse.
6. You need to keep exercising and eating right after high school, or you'll lose your youthful physique and no longer be as attractive to the opposite sex.
7. If you go back to high school, it helps to have perfectly coiffed adorably floppy hair, nice cheekbones and unlimited access to your dad's credit card.
8. There are at least two other options to two teens having a child of their own, but this film acts like they don't exist.
9. Elvish can bring two unlikely souls together, one of whom keeps swearing that she'll never date the other.
10. Beware of elderly janitors who seem to know everything about you.  They may be your spirit guides.  Really.",1240876800,11,2211,4.573604060913706

8331223,4,B001OQCUYS,"17 Again was a funny and entertaining movie overall. It was pretty cheesy at times but thats what made it more funny.
The camera techniques and music well used well throughout the movie. Times that were intense had a lot of close ups. The camera moves with Zac Efron all throughout the movie. Whether he was dancing w his wife as a teenager or walking up to the school looking fine with his hair blowing in the wind.
This movie kept me very entertained the whole movie. This movie seems to be pretty popular. I think the audience it is a little more attracted to is teenagers. But the meaning behind the movie applies to everybody.
The whole movie, He doesnt appreciate what he has. Then he starts to realize what he really does have and how important his family is. Basically the moral message is appreciate what u have now cause once you loose it then thats when you will appreciate it more.
Zac Efrons character is struggling with some pride. He is blaming his decision on marrying his wife instead of choosing basketball for his boring life. Through out the movie he tries to win back his familys love and eventually does in the end.
Overall I enjoyed this movie and I would definitely watch again and again, maybe even 17 times. Not just because of Zac Efron either. The movie was well put together and was comical to me. I would give it a 11/12 for lacking some educational value.",1526428800,,1386,4.482213438735178

A father who has been blaming his wife and kids for a failed and disappointing life gets his wish to live his live over again- but unlike most wish fulfilment dreams, he doesn't actually go back in time.  He becomes 17 again, but remains in the current time which means it really isn't a true 'do over'.  However, he does get his youth and basketball talent back again and the chance to win a scholarship to college.  What he didn't expect was the opportunity to see his kids' and wife's life from a new standpoint.  What he sees shows more about him than about them and he realizes how many opportunities he's missed in his life.  His focus on all that he lost caused him to to be blind to all that he had gained.
