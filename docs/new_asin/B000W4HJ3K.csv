8221223,5,B000W4HJ3K,Good book with lots of history and background of that whole era in the Hot Rod Era of the '60s.,1421539200,,95,3.8
8221224,5,B000W4HJ3K,"Great DVD by one of my favorite kustom artists. I like Franco's laid back and easy going instructional style, and he is a very cool guy. This dvd is a pleasure to watch and I highly recommend it. I e-mailed Von Franco as I had a question about the dvd, and he actually e-mailed me back with more instruction. How cool is that?",1309996800,,326,4.190476190476191
8221225,5,B000W4HJ3K,"I have a collection of Von Franco inspired Dyno bicycles, and wanted some info on the man. Nice piece of historical artistry. Did a little T-shirt dabbling myself as a kid.",1274227200,,172,4.580645161290323
8221226,5,B000W4HJ3K,"Excellent autobiographical film by VON FRANCO, released/distributed by the guys at the MAD FABRICATORS' SOCIETY and acting as counterpart, sort of, to the long out-of-print book of the same name. VON FRANCO was a child prodigy, of sorts, of the legendary ED ""BIG DADDY"" ROTH, and the pair spent many years touring the car show circuit together, displaying Roth's Kustom Kreations and airbrushing t-shirts to pay the bills.  Franco is quite the character in his own right, and anyone with a love of Kustom Kulture (or with high-octane premium leaded gas in their veins instead of blood) will easily overlook the home video aspects of this flick and dig straight into the meat of it.  Whatta ride - thanks for sharing, Franco!",1202688000,,724,4.926229508196721
