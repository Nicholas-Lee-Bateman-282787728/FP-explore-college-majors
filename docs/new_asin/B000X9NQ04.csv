8433366,1,B000X9NQ04,"I bought this video for my daughter because she loves Mia Hamm.  She was doing a project at school on her and wanted to see her play.  So I searched Mia Hamm on Amazon and this is one of the videos that came up.  I was suprised and very disappointed to find out that even thought it said on the website and on the back of the box quote, ""North Carolina team lead by Mia Hamm"", that she was not playing or was even mention the entire time.  I don't know if she was out for injury or what the deal was, but I feal if I search your website for Mia Hamm and she was not playing in this game it should have been noted.  I ordered another documentary and was very happy with that purchase.",1252713600,,683,3.9562043795620436
