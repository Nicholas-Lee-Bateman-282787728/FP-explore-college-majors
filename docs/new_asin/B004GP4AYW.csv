8428925,5,B004GP4AYW,"This author is great of the DVD. This is someone I would love to study under, I am an anatomy and kinesiology junky. This is a great learning  tool",1390780800,,147,4.068965517241379
8428926,4,B004GP4AYW,"These videos are not only hugely instructive anatomically, they approach the subject with a reverence and respect not often seen in dissection videos.  I highly recommend them,  especially to those just being introduced to human dissection.",1383264000,,240,5.638888888888889
8428927,5,B004GP4AYW,"with great sensitivity and appreciation for the wonder of the human body and the cadaver, and the donors who make this possible, there is nothing ""gross"" about the gross anatomy presented here.  beautifully filmed, though the camera sometimes struggles to get the focus just right because of the nature of the complexity of human tissue, and the desire to present it as well as possible.  i find it relaxing to watch these lectures, even while eating!!!",1372204800,,453,4.947368421052632
8428928,4,B004GP4AYW,"Although Gil's credentials are not typical, the video series is thorough and would prove useful to those studying the variety of physical health fields.",1360540800,3,152,5.375
8428929,5,B004GP4AYW,"We viewed several clips from Gil's DVD's when I was in massage school and I had seen most of the first DVD as well. I have been wanting to purchase them since I graduated but have not had the money, when I saw them for $59.95 I jumped at the chance to buy them! (I have never seen them for under $100.00) I have learned that there is also a plan in the works to offer C.E's for massage therapists based on the material on the DVD's. I highly recommend these DVD's for any student of anatomy or bodywork, this is a great price and they are worth every penny!",1339891200,7,557,4.072727272727272
8428930,5,B004GP4AYW,"Truly amazing dvds. If you are interested in anatomy and physiology, these dvds will open your mind beyond any schooling you may have had! Gil makes the dissections so interesting, and his style keeps you enthralled without getting queasy... best of all you learn about yourself!",1297468800,3,279,5.086956521739131
