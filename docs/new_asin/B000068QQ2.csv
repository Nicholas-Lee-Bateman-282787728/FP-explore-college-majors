1726056,5,B000068QQ2,Must see movie,1421625600,,14,4.0
1726057,5,B000068QQ2,This is definitely one of my favourites.,1421280000,6,40,4.857142857142857
1726058,5,B000068QQ2,This has to be one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. The only thing that I would like to change is to make it in English. Other then that a really good movie and one that I will share.,1421280000,3,197,3.5
1726059,1,B000068QQ2,"I very carefully did NOT put spoilers in this review, although I wanted to, but some reader might be able to guess the ending just from my attitude. If you're extremely sensitive, don't read any farther. Otherwise, you're very welcome to spend a few minutes in my world.

Obviously others who have seen this movie enjoyed it. I found it almost unbearably frustrating.

It's yet another coming out movie, which is bad enough, with all the standard violence, homophobia, angst, blown opportunities and cowardly betrayals of the one who least deserves it. It got to be too much - way, WAY too much.

One screw-up after another after another, relentlessly, endlessly, as if the comer-out was trying very, very hard to do absolutely EVERYTHING as badly as possible. After what seemed like five hours of the same crap I wanted to punch the jerk myself.

No gay person in real life can be that stupid AND that afraid AND that cowardly AND that selfish. Gay men are stronger than straight men are, not weaker - we HAVE to be! - and persisting in making movies that make us look like self-centered cowards is inexcusable. If there actually are gay males like that lurking somewhere in the Netherlands countryside, their despicable behavior should not be celebrated on film.

But what makes this movie even worse than the typical coming-out movie is its infuriating ending, about which I will say no more. I hated it. I checked two stars, but I realize it doesn't deserve even one.",1418601600,18,1471,4.752941176470588
1726060,4,B000068QQ2,"Sieger is a fifteen year old and is good at sporty things - especially running and he gets chosen to represent the school. This throws him into the group of athletic types and he meets Marc. Marc is not like other boys - he is assured and makes up his own rules. They soon develop a friendship; but Marc is hankering after a bit more.

Sieger is also dealing with a home life that is far from ideal. His mother was killed in a motor accident and his caring father has now become over protective of him and his more wayward older brother. Add to this that he is going through the whole sexual awakening thing - that is where your default switch is heterosexual - and he is trying to do the right thing. As the training intensifies so does the relationship - but the outcome is always in doubt.

This was a made for TV film in the Netherlands (in Dutch with good sub titles) and as such was always going to be a bit tame. Then again we are talking teenagers here so don't expect anything too post watershed. On the other hand it is a story that has been told before, but this one manages to do it in a very charming and understandable way that comes across as being absolutely genuine. If you like a tender gay themed love story then I am sure you will want to see this film.",1417824000,81,1273,4.170731707317073
1726061,4,B000068QQ2,"The movie is in French, and the instructions to put the English subtitles on are in French.  It's enjoyable but probably more understood if you grew up around hockey.  It's about a senior men's team who live for their games, and their sponsor who gambled the bar on whether his men win or not.  Young and middle age men care more about their hockey games than their wives or careers.",1417219200,,383,4.442857142857143
1726062,4,B000068QQ2,"It may be because I'm French Canadian and have a thorough understanding of the culture but this film is hilarious!  This version includes a subtitled English version - there are versions out there that only have the overdubbed English track, be sure to order this one and not those - makes a huge difference!

This film stars a slew of well-known French Canadian comedic actors, the script is hilarious - and of course, it revolves around hockey, awesome!",1358640000,,455,4.82051282051282
1726063,5,B000068QQ2,"This exceeds all other movies within the genre, it feels nostalgic throughout. It is a splendid and warm story of the innocence of youth and love, and if you want a feel-good movie, this is it!",1509753600,2,193,4.388888888888889
1726064,5,B000068QQ2,wish they had did more than imply the ending as I am a sap for well defined endings and happy ones at that. Good movie that reflects the anxiety of coming out. enjoyed the acting. Movie could have been 30 minutes longer to be complete.,1505174400,,235,4.2444444444444445

1726089,4,B000068QQ2,"Nice acting and atmosphere, although I found it very similar to Summer Storm, without the depth of the latter. I didn't feel like the subplot with Sieger's family meshed very well with Sieger's conflicts. It felt disjointed, and overall I didn't find it to be very original. But it was a nice movie and I'm certainly not going to complain about the existence of another hopeful, gorgeously shot LGBTQ love story. It would be appropriate for a younger audience since it only includes kissing and some drinking.",1469232000,,509,4.862068965517241

1726092,5,B000068QQ2,"Absolutely the best love story between two boys. It has a gradual tension as Sieger wrestles with his growing affection for Marc, the other team mate.

1726111,5,B000068QQ2,"This is possibly one of the sweetest gay themed coming of age films I have seen in a while (Other than The Way He Looks). The actors were perfect, they had great chemistry together and Ko Zandvliet was just so mesmerizing as Marc. I could really read the characters emotions on the actor's face. The story line was nice, nothing was gratuitous and there was actually a nice plot and subplot.

1726121,3,B000068QQ2,"The lead characters definitely kept their ""relationship"" on the edge and unrequited which kept the viewer on the edge of their seat waiting to see if they would move forward in their budding attraction for each other. Naturally, one has a much stronger character and composure compared to the other who is reticent to interact on most levels. The follow-through at the end is what is lacking and disappointing to me I really expected a little more to be accomplished than what the director and producer's provided. The actors were sweet and attractive and did a good job, but I believe their hands were tied behind their backs although the final path taken is possible for straight as well as gay teenagers. Fairly enjoyable, but not something I would strongly recommend. It's a definite coin toss in my mind. I would watch this movie somehow before making a purchase.

PS  If you under stand German you will get a lot more meaning out of this film!

1726135,5,B000068QQ2,"Have read most of the other reviews and will say I agreed with what has already been stated. The storyline is real, sensible and instinctive. Tender kissing replaces non-depicted sex, however, given the level of their mutual attraction, affection and raging hormonal age the physical act isn't far off. Thanks to the healthy attitude the Dutch have towards sex in general, these guys will be guilty of committing an act of love.
Amazingly, both lead actors, despite their young age, were nothing short than PERFECT for their respective roles. You can't help but sense that the slightly aggressive Marc (KO ZANDVLIET) may be a bit more focused in knowing what he wants from the innocent Sieger (GIJS BLOM).  Sieg is following a journey of ""awakening"" which is unfolding in such an innocent natural way it gives new meaning to naivete. The close-up face-shots of their glances and long stares make you feel you're invading their space and privacy. It's a ""first-love"" for both teens and you know that the strong bond they're forging will at the very least make them life-long friends.
Both actors represent fine ""eye-candy"" but over and above that are fine actors. All connected with this body of work deserve praise---keep up the beautiful work Holland!!!",1434758400,,1254,5.0

Fortunately, the flow of the film allowed me to understand everything that was happening even if I couldn't keep up with the text. Sieger and Marc are well written characters and the actors did a fantastic job. Stef, Sieger's friend and fellow teammate, was very intuitive, he seemed to understand that there was something more between his friend and Marc. He was a little hesitant in bringing up the relationship between Sieger and Marc, but showed support in his own way.

The characters were completely believable and while they all weren't likable they and the performaces gave the movie a quality that very satisfying.
The leads are attractive and while there is tension in the story it never veers into melodrama (not that melodrama is a bad thing).
So a naturalistic coming out and coming of age story that is sweet and interesting and one that I think will be worth watching again.",1431907200,,567,4.737373737373737

1726163,5,B000068QQ2,"Of all the gay films I've seen so far, this was by far, the best.  I've watched this movie 9 times already, in 1 year.  I became totally absorbed into the relationship between the 2 boys, and thought this was a great and captivating movie.  The movie was definitely low keyed and mild in sex scenes, but very absorbing in relationship!  Only disappointment was that there was no heavy sex scenes.  Only kissing.  But in the end, that was enough, even though I wished there were just a few more graphic scenes.  But the boys were awesome in looks, both very attractive, and the movie went deep in both their feelings for each other, which swept me away.  I felt like i wanted to be there with them.  Definitely a 10 stars movie.  Too bad i can only give this 5 stars!  It is a great and absorbing film.  Well worth watching.  I would classify this as a masterpiece.  Well thought out, and a happy ending.",1430092800,2,903,4.36144578313253

1726166,4,B000068QQ2,"Aside from a sub-plot that adds some padding--(older brother, fast motorized vehicles and annoyed father) I liked this film a lot. A budding relationship between two runners on a relay team forms the core of this film. The two lead actors do a splendid job--one of whom cannot quite admit (in public, anyway) his attraction to his teammate, who is much more comfortable with his gay identity. The end of the film where the one runner regrets his bad behavior to his gay friend and is hurt that he cannot share the celebration of victory with him, is almost palpable in its pain.

1726188,5,B000068QQ2,"Brilliant in cinematography, script and acting by the two leads. True love without sexual tension. That may be difficult to believe in that 2 boys of approximately this age, after kissing, would probably be jumping each others' bones due to their raging hormones. However, the writer and/or director here chose to keep the focus on having fun and the bonding that best friends have; then adding love. Excellent portrayal of what an adolescent boy feels (peer pressure, attraction to both genders, self doubt, remorse) when confronting his true feelings.

In many places the cinematography was simply breathtaking. It was also not disjointed or thrown in (like so many Indy films) but was shown in context with the characters. For example,  the 2 boys running along the beach with the ocean waves crashing, riding their bikes in a lush forest and laying on the beach watching the white birds flying in the night sky.

Bravo on creating a rare gay masterpiece!",1426550400,24,958,4.975

1726201,5,B000068QQ2,"I agree with the majority who have given this film such positive reviews. I am a 75-year-old gay man who struggled for most of his life (but especially during his teen years) for self-acceptance against the tide of anti-gay sentiment in society. Films like this were unavailable for the first 50 years of my life -- when they were most needed. Books, movies, and TV programs of that era mainly portrayed gays stereotypically as neurotics, villains, child abusers, or negatively in some other fashion. Straights cannot begin to imagine the effect the media had for young gays -- most of whom were hiding in the closet, or trying the best they could to convince themselves they were not gay but merely going through some kind of period that they would grow out of. Movies like ""Boys"" arouse two sentiments in me -- profound grief for not having experienced the love and affection pictured so positively here, and anger, bordering on rage, that I was denied not only the experience, but the opportunity to see others do so in the example of this movie (even if only fictitiously). The special qualities of this film have not been mentioned in the other reviews -- and they are represented in the characters themselves: two bright, adjusted, affectionate, caring and healthy individuals. Not the freaks, villains, and sickoids who populated the books and movies of my childhood.",1425945600,128,1374,4.901287553648069
1726202,4,B000068QQ2,"Boys is a 2014 Dutch (with English subtitles) made for TV film, starring Gijs Blom in the lead as Sieger and Ko Zandvllet as his love interest, Marc. It is set in the countryside and the cinematography is beautifully done. The storyline maybe tame by American standards but is solid and believable. Sieger is discovering his sexuality amidst dealing with the loss of his mother, over protective father and a rebellious older brother. Marc, confident and free spirited, is comfortable with his gayness and pursues a friendship with Sieger. The two are in training for the big upcoming track relay race. As the story unfolds we see the romance develop between the youths. This is a wholesome, romantic, first love story that will be enjoyed by most. Mischa Kamps work succeeds without resorting to the typical and tired formula of sex and drugs. This is a great film, for teens and their parents to watch together.",1425859200,8,912,4.852564102564102
1726203,5,B000068QQ2,"Wow! I was so impressed by this brilliant Dutch film I watched it twice before writing a review.  Simply a stunning coming of age story detailing the blossoming love between two high school track athletes, ""Boys"" deserves the highest praise.
Director Mischa Kamp has superbly captured the many moods of a teenage boy coming to terms with his sexuality.  Gijs Blom is exceptional in the difficult role of Sieger, a brooding 15 year old dealing with a complex home life, stating that he is ""not gay"" but being overwhelmed by his feelings for Marc.  The latter, a colorful and outgoing free spirit played with remarkable sensitivity by Ko Zadvilet, who coming from a very open family, has difficulty in understanding Sieger's mixed messages about his sexuality.  The whole cast is nothing short of superb, none more than the touching performance of Jonas Smulders as Sieger's widowed father, trying to make a good home for his two sons.
Everything about this film is spot on.  From the sensitive direction and intelligent, realistic screenplay to Melle Van Essen's faultless photography of the beautiful Dutch countryside and the fantastic pop music score by Rutger Reinders.
Less than eighty minutes in running time but every moment of this uplifting gay romance is precious and beautifully put together.  A feel good movie for sure, but one with substance and intelligent observation.

While the budding relationship between the two young men is interesting, especially the inner conflict of the one--I was especially intrigued by the very real and close relationship of the two sons with their recently widowed father. This is a very nice detail because in the end, it really is all about family--sometimes the negative impact more so than the good, but the filmmakers give us a very realistic view offering both the good and the bad. As for the relationship of our two young romantics, all I can say is, you really may not be able to choose the person you love. Because it is so rare, the courage must be summoned to humbly face it and be grateful for it and when that happens, it is beautiful!",1422835200,17,863,4.496815286624204
