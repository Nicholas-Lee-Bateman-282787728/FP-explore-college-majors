8023057,5,B00026L9AW,I truly wished this series never came to a end. even as a teen when this first came out. I loved the show! its honestly a great buy for all ages but yes mainly for children lol. A must have for children in elementary school and younger. You won't be disappointed,1425686400,,262,4.1568627450980395
8023058,5,B00026L9AW,The I Spy series couldn't be more fun and developmental for preschoolers.  Our three year old grandson loves these DVDs and Grammy and Poppy love searching with him.,1356393600,,165,4.892857142857143
8023059,5,B00026L9AW,"This is a fun series for younger kids. Probably ideal for ages 3 - 5. I found the theme song both irritatingly infectious and catchy. (""Whoops, I found it! How about You?"") I love the slightly imperfect feel of the stop-motion animation. You can feel safe letting your kids watch this and they will learn a few things while they're at it.",1354060800,,338,4.467741935483871
8023060,4,B00026L9AW,"My three year old LOVES this show. I had already purchased a single disk found in a local shop, but buying the other individual disks was more expensive than getting the lot. My son likes me to watch it with him and I enjoy watching it. He calls me ""Spyler"" and I call him ""C.C."". The items that the character look for are easy to find and your kid will feel very accomplished if you let him find it first(as the characters do). BUT...for me and other big kids: They have a secret item at the beginning of the episode that you are suppose to find x-number of them-IT'S REALLY HARD! And I like it for that.",1304467200,3,605,4.17948717948718
8023061,5,B00026L9AW,My kids love I Spy - they sing it all the time.  It's a DVD collection that I don't mind watching either.,1123891200,4,105,3.772727272727273
