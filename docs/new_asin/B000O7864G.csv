2792552,5,B000O7864G,"First off, when the Japanese make a series of films they don't get cheaper - the films are either given the same budget or MORE!  Also, while the crew may change they try to STICK to the facts.  Watch all four of the first films in a row and you have a VERY long story, with plots that link together, the same characters played by the same caste, and the feeling that there was money, sweat and love poured into each scene.
The first two films were in Black and White but by the third we get color.  Wonderful, beautiful color.
The scenes are realistic, the settings gritty, the characters dirty and the action wild.  It was nice to see Tomisaburo Wakayama as the one armed Samurai in the second story.  Not only is he acting as Zatoichi's brother - which works really well because he is the real brother of Shintaro Katsu - but it is nice to see him before he became famous for being the Lone Wolf, in Lone Wolf and Club.
By getting them all together I did save money AND was able to watch them over the week, having my own Samurai Movie Convention!  Yes, I did eat noodles and rice.  Not really for kids - serious themes - but while there are tons of action there is little blood and it is SO cool.  So many the kids could peek.  Get it used or new.",1238025600,19,1251,4.157676348547718
2792553,5,B000O7864G,"Ichi is the classic hero who is courageous, selfless, honorable and somewhat vulnerable at some level. He never gets the girl and always rides...er, walks off into the sunset!

Zatoichi is a blind masseur - a disability looked down upon in Japanese society at that time. However, craving respect, he learns the way of the sword and becomes a Yakuza gangster. When we meet Ichi, he has already decided to leave that life behind and ""go straight"" but his former life always come back to haunt him either because someone wishes to employ his services or because someone with a grudge wishes revenge. Ichi is a masterful swordsman but will often display his skills against inanimate objects to make potential opponents think twice.

I should point out that these movies are not the typical martial arts films which showcase action almost exclusively. Like the great western movie ""Shane"", there are very few fights in these films. Ichi is a character (wonderfully portrayed by Shintaro Katsu) that is fully developed. He has regrets, hopes, fears and desires. Ichi is a man who wishes to be left alone to live his life in peace but is never allowed to do so by circumstance.

These movies are more than a showcase for superb swordsmanship (yes, his skills are indeed superb and the action sequences are excellent). They are morality plays and tales of compassion and honor.",1228780800,6,1369,4.866952789699571
2792554,4,B000O7864G,"I was completely unfamiliar with Zatoichi except for seeing a 5 second clip of one of his movie or TV show.  So, I wanted to watch the beginning of Zatoichi.  As I did some research, I found out that the entire character started with movies (many of them were made).  Then, it began a successful TV series.  I noticed that there are tons and tons of various movies, tv shows, and packages.  This particular package is what introduced the character Zatoichi to Japan.  This is where it all began.",1215129600,6,495,4.50561797752809
2792555,5,B000O7864G,This is a great series. I am a big Bruce Lee and Zatoichi movie fan. If you want to see what Japan was like in the mid to late 1800's watch these movies. The themes all are great and you know who the hero is. After living on Okinawa for 4 years and Thailand for 1 1/2 years I can tell you that these movies are directed and produced in a high quality fashion.  So sit back on a do-nothing Saturday night and watch these movies with a little Sake and pop corn and enjoy a good movie. Zatoichi would want you to do it that way!!!,1205020800,4,527,3.925233644859813
2792556,5,B000O7864G,"Every Saturday for the past few years I've arose on Saturday morning to watch a Samurai movie on International Film Channel. Since watching my first Zatoichi film I became a rabid fan of the series. My 4-volume set arrived this past Friday and I have already watched all four movies. Its a good thing I also ordered the 7-volume set.

The Blind Swordsmen movies are captivating in the way they are filmed. When it would have been easy to churn out a low budget action film, the producers of these movies took the high road and turned out films that are high quality in every way. Sure, there's the obligatory ""blind swordsman wipes out two dozen samurai"" stuff in it. But its all done in a believable way.

Zatoichi is a true antihero. Picture him as the Japanese version of the Lone Ranger, Marshall Dillon, Josie Wales, and John Wayne all rolled into one man. And Shintaro Katsu brings him to life in such a way that I cannot imagine anyone else playing Zatoichi. In fact, I was surprised to find out that Shintaro Katsu wasn't blind himself. He makes the part that believable.

Even if you've never seen a Zatoichi movie but you like samurai movies, I can promise you that you will not be disappointed in any of the Blind Swordsman movies.",1189382400,5,1242,4.535714285714286
2792557,5,B000O7864G,Great examples of this cult classic.  I have all 26 DVD's and find these to be the best of the bunch.,1187827200,5,101,3.8095238095238093
2792558,5,B000O7864G,I was living in Japan in the the earil to mid sixties--what a wonderful memory!! I watched this on Japanese TV all thoes years ago and never thought I would see it again. But thanks to Janus films I can relive my childhood. Seeing these episodes again is like being reunited with a dear-long lost friend. I highly recommend this set to anyone..don't pass it up!,1183852800,8,361,4.484848484848484
2792559,5,B000O7864G,"I came to the Zatoichi franchise in college when AMC or TCM had a saturday morning Samurai movie special every week.  They pulled heavily from the Zatoichi films and I was instantly sold on their humor, sometimes through wordplay, but alternately in the form of slapstick.

The sword fights also resonated with me as being very different from what I was used to.  They were compact and final.  Enemies fell after a single blow and a the hero rarely started fights; always attempted to talk his way out of them not from fear, but rather because killing was not something he relished.

This collection is a tremendous value with high quality examples of this storied franchise.  The packaging looks great, very colorful with dynamic images on each case.  It looks fabulous on a shelf and looks even better on a screen.",1177113600,21,816,4.74468085106383
2792560,5,B000O7864G,"I have been looking for this set to show up at Amazon. If you don't have the first four Ichi films, buy it. Watch all four in order and you will be in for a real treat. The set of twenty six Zatoichi films and the first six volumes of the TV series are a treasure to be viewed over and over for the rest of your life. Watch them in a quiet setting and breathe the atmosphere of life in feudal Japan. Love, hate, violence, peace, honor, pathos..it's all here..in spades. I have never seen anything like it in film. And so much of it. I have a dozen of the films and the first six volumes of the series and have been enthralled with every one. I'll continue until I have them all. Then I'll start all over from the beginning. If you get hooked, you will too.",1176163200,30,756,4.046666666666667
8183861,5,B000O7864G,"Four well-done films that together tell an epic story about the blind swordsman's early adventures, with several recurring characters throughout. The first has the least amount of swordplay in the entire film series, focusing more on character and tension; what swordplay there is, is some of the best in the series, and well worth the wait. I feel the second one is the weakest of the four, but it's still great to see Shintaro Katsu share the screen with his big brother Tomisaburo Wakayama.",1452297600,,493,4.880952380952381
8183862,5,B000O7864G,"Amazing film series. I am now hooked. I already watched 5, 6, and 7. Got the next three on order now. Zatoich films are masterpieces with great sword fights and compelling stories.",1444694400,,180,4.65625

8183865,5,B000O7864G,"I ordered this book for my brother. It was in great shape.  He was thrilled with it. It was all and even more than what he wanted. Thank you for excellent service,",1391990400,,163,4.09375
8183866,4,B000O7864G,"The Zatoichi films have never been my favourites, but they are nevertheless outstanding.  I was first introduced to the character of Zatoichi while living in Japan in 1968.  So my first glimpse of him was more than 15 films into the series.  My kids gave me the boxed set of Volumes 1-4 last Christmas and it was the first time I had actually seen the first four movies in the order they were made.  What an eye-opening (pardon the pun) treat!  Seeing the first few films of the series in their proper order reveals a great deal about the character and motivations of Zatoichi that I had not understood by having watched only the later films.  If you have never seen Zatoichi before, or have only seen a couple of the films out of sequence, I strongly recommend that you start with this set!  You will understand what makes the central character the person he is, and the subsequent films will make more sense to you.  Although the Zatoichi movies all tend to follow a similar formula, each movie tells a unique tale showing how the events of his past continue to shape his future and the way in which he deals with the events in his life.  Zatoichi movies are much more than mere chanbara (swordplay).  They are intense human dramas that examine the strengths, weaknesses, failures, and triumphs of all of the principal characters.  The stories are laced with slapstick humour, usually have a poignant love interest and a group of characters who are enduring misery and hardship at the hands of the villains -- and often the result of their own poor decisions or character flaws -- with enough sword fighting to satisfy any chanbara fan.  The good guys are rarely all good and the bad guys are rarely all bad, so the stories are rich, engaging, realistic, and gritty.  Often, as in real life, the ending is not truly happy ... especially for Zatoichi.  Highly recommended!",1333670400,,1873,4.636363636363637
8183867,5,B000O7864G,My husband is a big fan of Zatoichi.  I purchased this set of four early films for him for Christmas.  He watched all four films within a week!  These are classics which I know he will watch again and again.,1295222400,2,207,4.125
8183868,5,B000O7864G,"Fantastic, and from the early '60s, no less! Getting close to 50 years! And, without all the editing, explosions, CGI, bells and whistles of today's similar type films! Very interesting original stories about the humble, sometimes humorous, blind masseur who only wants to get along with people, but always seems to wander into a human snake pit. These movies were very nicely done, and there are even a few instances where some of the slow moving camera shots remind me of early classic ""Bergman"", which I love.
  If you haven't seen any of these movies, just try and imagine this scene near the very beginning of the very first movie in the series. Zatoichi, (who can't see of course) is led into a seedy dark gambling house, where someone has escorted him, and sits him down on the floor. Attracted by the boisterous sound of a large group of men gambling, he moves over amongst them. The rough, sleazy-looking buggers throw Zatoichi annoyed glances while they continue their dice game. Zatoichi then interrupts them and, smiling, proceeds to inform them ever so politely that they all ""smell"" very bad! You might be able to imagine the reaction, but better still, you might want to see it!
  Finally, I guess I'm at a bit of a ""stalemate"", since there are three great boxsets out, (all of which I have), but are they going to put the rest of the movies into boxsets? I feel compelled to wait, because that would obviously save a ton of money, yet I'm really eager to get all the movies in between- right now!",1259452800,2,1512,4.630597014925373
8183869,4,B000O7864G,"I bought the first Zatoichi film, ""The Tale of Zatoichi."" I really enjoyed the film and was impressed with the extras-an insert with an essay written by a Zatoichi freak and a set of 4 Collector's Cards. When I saw this set of 4 films I was overjoyed and I bought it. I also bought the second box set of Zatoichi the Blind Swordsman: Vols. 5-8.  However I was a little disappointed to discover that this set has only the disks with no cards or inserts. Is there any way to get the inserts or collector's cards now? According to reviews I've read of the individual films they all included them.
The movies themselves rate 5 stars. But I'll dock the sets one star each for the missing inserts and cards.",1250553600,4,701,4.351145038167939
8183870,5,B000O7864G,"Every second of Zatoichi is worth viewing with concentration. From the overall story lines, to the individual character profiles, and the way Shintaro Katsu builds Zatoichi as the movie(s) progress. The subtle humor and his physical presence are terrific. His mastery with the sword and his style of fighting are classic. And of course the message...",1250121600,2,350,5.267857142857143
