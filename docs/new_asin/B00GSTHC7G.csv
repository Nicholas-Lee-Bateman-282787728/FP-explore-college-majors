6109683,5,B00GSTHC7G,"OK maybe this movie series will never win an academy award or emmy. But this is a great way to spend some time relaxing. Catherine Bell is great as the Good Witch. The stories are well written and wholesome and give a message without being too preachy.

6109684,5,B00GSTHC7G,This is a great series for children and adults.  I think that the entire series on Hallmark should be released including the movies on DVD.  I don't understand why they are waiting so long to release this to DVD,1393200000,29,211,4.384615384615385

6109927,5,B00GSTHC7G,"Not what I was expecting. I normally don't watch witchcraft anything, but there is more witchcraft that went on in ""Bewitched"" than there is in this series of movies. Nothing witch like going on, other than herbal remedies and a highly perceptive woman's intuition. I really liked how Cassie  is creative about solving problems with relationships with family members and others. People solve their own problems by taking her suggestions, but do it through their own strength, not by magic. No special magical brews or spells, even though it's highly suggested with looks and back ground music. There is also a value system that is put into place on how to talk, respect others, consequences of lying and dressing appropriately. Highly recommend.",1465948800,4,745,5.10655737704918
6109928,5,B00GSTHC7G,"I love, love, love all The Good Witch movies and the Good Witch series!!!  This is the second in the series of movies.  The first was in 2008 and this was in 2009, then there were one each in 2010, 2011, 2013, and 2014.  And then series 1 and 2 of the Good Witch television series.  At the time of this writing (06/15/2016), every movie and the two tv series are available for purchase on Amazon.  For purchase means the buyer gets to watch the videos over and over as long as Amazon obtains the rights.
The tv series 1 is free through Popcorn flix that I found on Roku, so that was where I watched series 1, but I will probably end up purchasing this series as well, as I don't know how long it will be available on Popcorn, and I will want to watch these all again in a year or so, and then again in another year or so. (Did you ever notice that after a year or two, or sometimes three, re-reading a book you loved or a watching a video you loved can be like watching for the first time again?  It is amazing how much we find we have forgotten, when we reacquaint ourselves with the material.)
These videos all take place in the quaint small town and Cassie's gorgeous large home that was dilapidated when she took it on and brought it back to beauty, the house's lush gardens, and Cassie's little shop in town.  These videos also have lots of visual beauty and charm, from set designs to wardrobes.
Another thing I love about these is that there is continuity throughout all of these videos, continuity of characters, plots, and of actors!
Like Cassie Nightingale, I have studied and use herbs and supplements for my and my son's health (as much as he'll go along), and use crystals for their subtle magnetic properties and visual beauty.  I believe in striving to speak to the good in each person, which is the part that can hear the other side, and to listen to try to hear what is really going on with the other - even when we have a disagreement, and even when the disagreement is severe.  This is what Cassie Nightingale does in this series and does way better than I, which makes for inspirational and calming videos.
I try to live each day with peace in my heart, and to listen to God who is within everything and everyone, and to be a peaceful and loving influence in the world, as much as possible.  It seems to me that Cassie Nightingale does the same.

Unrealistic sequences.  A garden party in Canada in November when nothing, except for the witch's plants, are in bloom.  And are we believe that if a stranger shows up with ""papers"" proclaiming him to be the rightful property owner  of a house, that (1) the courts would immediately believe him, and (2) the original owner of the house be giving just two weeks to vacate?  Frankly, all the five-star ratings are puzzling.  Most of the actors were stiff, and the child actors were especially wooden.

I love the first one but I feel like the sequel to this was just even better!! Maybe it is because the plot was just better than the introduction movie? Or maybe because the actors just gelled better together? Either way love this one. But have to say that I am disappointed by the weekly series they are bringing to Hallmark. It sounds like Chris Potter is not even in it which is what helped make the series so sweet and endearing. It also sounds like the show will be focused around their now teenage daughter and her friends. In other words sounds like another teen show.

The movie is great &I can watch it alone or w/ family.  My only criticism is toward Hallmarks marketing.  After releasing ""Good Witch's Garden"" & ""The Good Witch's Gift"" on their own they are releasing a 4pk with all but the 1st movie.

6110300,5,B00GSTHC7G,"Inevitably Hallmark had to produce a sequel, THE GOOD WITCH was simply that good and that watchable. You and I, should we play the word association game and should you mention ""Catherine Bell,"" my first instinctive response will always be ""Lt. Col. Sarah 'Mac' MacKenzie."" But if you ask me a second time, then I'd say ""Cassandra Nightingale.""

In 2009, THE GOOD WITCH'S GARDEN happily reacquainted us with ""the most untraditional woman in town,"" and that's Cassie. This sequel finds her settling into Middleton and into her ancestral home, the Grey House. And not even the constant undermining of the mayor's snoopy wife (Catherine Disher) can derail Middleton's 200th year anniversary garden gala's being held at Grey House, which is the oldest home in town. Even as Cassie preps for the bicentennial event, she can't help but fret over the steep cost of Grey House's upkeep. To bolster her funds, she decides to convert Grey House into a bed & breakfast inn. This leaves one enterprising stranger that opening he was looking for.

Cassandra Nightingale is an eternal optimist. She sees the good in people, the great potential of them. When that stranger, whose name is Nick, becomes her first paying guest, she welcomes him with open arms. Except that Nick claims to be the direct blood descendant of Captain Charles Hamblin, beloved of the legendary Grey Lady herself, she whose bloodline courses thru Cassie. And Nick's ironclad chain of title naming him as sole heir trumps Cassie's handwritten will that wasn't even notarized (kids, notarize your will). So you see, this can of worms puts Cassie's faith in her fellow man sorely to the test. Meanwhile, her widowed boyfriend, Middleton's Chief of Police Jake Russell (Chris Potter), was suspicious of Nick from jump. But what can he do? He doesn't brim over with magic.

In fact, we the viewers aren't for sure convinced that Cassie herself is magic. That's the conceit of this whimsical series. Is Cassie Nightingale a witch? Or, as she suggests to her smug guest, does she merely possess keen powers of perception? Either way, Cassie retains that alluring air of mystery. Catherine Bell continues to be perfect in the role.

Sideplots concern Chief of Police Russell's kids, Brandon and Lori. Brandon (Matthew Knight) is in imminent danger of hooliganism as he tries to impress a pair of troublemakers. Lori (Hannah Endicott-Douglas) is frustrated with her assigned classmate who she feels isn't contributing to their history project. Brandon and Laurie both turn to Cassie, whom they believe to be a benign witch. Can Cassie's sought-after practicality - cloaked in cryptic suggestions - make a difference?

Hallmark Channel has got itself a (deservedly) popular television film franchise. I appreciate the show's sense of whimsy and that aura of mystery that surrounds Cassie. And it's so endearing, the absolute faith the Russell kids have in her. I love how kind and generous Cassie is, and how intuitive she is, and how wise. Who wouldn't want a problem-solving good witch living in their neighborhood?

And I also want a veritas plant.

By the way, not for one second did you think Nick could get the better of Cassie, did you? Okay, then.

Thanks for bringing these movies out finally!",1402358400,,389,4.5
6110352,5,B00GSTHC7G,"I became a fan of the Good Witch when the first movie appeared on Netflix.  It quickly became my favorite movie and I watched it a number of times when it was still on streaming because it is just such a magical, comforting and uplifting film.  Then when they removed it, I immediately bought it on DVD.  When shopping for the DVD, I found out that it wasn't just the one movie...that there was a whole SERIES!  I do not have cable and was totally bummed when I discovered that there was no way to view the others.  So, naturally, when I found out that the second one was coming out on DVD, I marked my calendar and bought it right away!

The Good Witch's Garden does not disappoint.  It has the same feel of the first one and Catherine Bell is amazing as always.  I honestly don't think that anyone else could play that role as well as she does.  She has a gift for delivering cheesy lines so that they don't sound cheesy.  I also really liked Chris Potter in this one.  He was great in the first one, but I feel like in this one, his character is even better developed.  I also have to mention that the accompanying music, such as the theme song and the background music throughout both films fits so perfectly with the mood and magic of the film.  I am totally psyched for the next one to come out on DVD next week!",1402358400,8,1318,4.203187250996016

6110370,4,B00GSTHC7G,"I enjoy all these movies and wish they would put out a box set.  Cassandra is back, and she's as pretty and intuitive as ever about what people might need and how to set magic in motion.
This particular movie features Cassie's garden and the town garden club.  Greyhouse is looking amazing- inside and out, and about to be the site of the historical society's celebration.  Cassie is having some income issues though, and has made the decision to open up Greyhouse as a bed and breakfast.  Everything seems about perfect, and her romance is going great until a handsome stranger comes to town!
No, don't expect a big blockbuster here, but Good Witch fans will certainly enjoy this one.  If you haven't seen the others, I do recommend watching them in order, but they should all stand alone as 'feel good' movies.",1401062400,,812,4.65034965034965

It's great to see something without the ""F"" word and without the superfluous sex scenes commonly found in so many films done today.  The characters are warm without being too goody goody.

6110389,4,B00GSTHC7G,"Finally, they release the next installment of Hallmark's Good Witch series, retruning to Middleton, Grey House and the beautifully, mysterious Cassie.

This time we see Cassie's fantastic, if not, magical garden.  The town plans a bicentennial celebration to take place at her garden.  To make ends meet, she takes in a lodger, making her gorgeous home a B&B.  The handsome but creepily, smug lodger along with the mayor's wife plot other devices to spoil the good witch's peaceful existence.

There exist five stories going on: Cassie and the sheriff's romance and potential engagement; the loss of Grey House; the sheriff's son falling into bad company, the sheriff's daughter encounter with a disturbed classmate, and fifth, grandpa's love life.  All of these play into Cassie's benevolent hands one way or another.

I'd rate the movie PG for mild thematic elements, but the whole family can watch.  Our elementary aged children like these tales.  They really enjoy her cat and the sense that she can perform magic and will save the day.  Co-producer and star Catherine Bell is perfect in the role: elegant but simple, mystical but loving and kind, and with a great knowing look like her cat.  Chris Potter returns as the sensible, practical, at times befuddled, lawman boyfriend.

More tales to come, and they keep you wondering if she really is what the kids think she is.",1399852800,9,1377,4.991228070175438

6110398,5,B00GSTHC7G,"Inevitably Hallmark had to produce a sequel, THE GOOD WITCH was simply that good and that watchable. You and I, should we play the word association game and should you mention ""Catherine Bell,"" my first instinctive response will always be ""Lt. Col. Sarah 'Mac' MacKenzie."" But if you ask me a second time, then I'd say ""Cassandra Nightingale.""

6110401,4,B00GSTHC7G,"I'm just a sucker for Cassie Nightingale.

She's back and just as witchy as ever in this movie that features her garden as a main setting, and really, almost a character.
It sticks to the same basic formula as the first two movies.  People all around Cassie have problems, and she has a few of her own, but she always seems to know what to set in motion to fix things.

This story goes back to Grey House's original owner, and just what happened with The Grey Lady.  The house and garden look fantastic.  As a gardener myself, I really enjoyed seeing all the plants and Cassie's greenhouse.

Perhaps this movie is a tad less magickal than the first two, but it's definitely going to please most fans.  I really hope they make more.  I just love them.  They always seem to leave me feeling more compassionate towards people in general.

I want to give it 4.5 stars.  I do love it, but if you aren't a fan of the series, don't expect a blockbuster.  It's too subtle and sweet for that.",1398470400,7,983,4.34065934065934

I suggest everyone purchase a copy not just for their family, but for those they love.  These films are proof that movies can be entertaining while putting form good energy! As a Witch myself, I view Cassie as a wonderful role model. I understand she's fictional, but I also understand that young people often tern to fictional characters they see on television for a model on how or who they should be.

Please release all of the movies since I can't get my fix until you do!",1395705600,15,500,4.0
