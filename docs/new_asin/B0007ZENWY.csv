2254327,5,B0007ZENWY,My husband is so interested in UFO'S / ALIENS!  He sure loves to watch A & E!  This is a great DVD and he was surprised I remembered his interest as a surprise gift!  (I actually find it interesting too)!  So it was a WIN WIN DEAL!,1329091200,,231,3.851063829787234
2254328,1,B0007ZENWY,"As a 4-year college educated fellow with over five-and-a-half decades of life experience, I have studied other resources with far more information than this DVD has.  The History Channel apparently is for the less interested folks who want a surface introduction without much substance.  Saucer shallow documentary on saucers.  Milquetoast, wimpy, and disappointing.  After all, Leonard Nimoy was on Star Trek (TOS) thereby made both famous and popular for all those years, so since he narrates this film, I was hoping his name alone wasn't all A&E offered here.  If you're under fifteen years old, this DVD might be worth your time though; because you won't be expecting Leonard Nimoy to respect his own television actor career as to whether or not to lend his credibility where it most definitely is not deserved.  Boo on A&E, and Leonard Nimoy isn't that desperate, so he needs to slap the crap out of his agent for himself being part of this so-called documentary.  The only interesting part about this film is how easily the SETI organization guy makes an ass out of himself by being ambiguous and pontificating about his inability to balance reality of his own view against the view he wants to debase.  All he's going to get out of stradling the fence is the seat of his pants ripped.  I'm guessing this is one of those purchases I've made where I'll toss the artwork and plastic DVD, and reuse the case to replace a damaged case for one of the movies I have that I want to hang onto.  Bless you Amazon for making these DVD's available used from second hand shops.  I'd end up in therapy if I had paid full price for this.",1317254400,,1629,4.660839160839161
2254329,3,B0007ZENWY,"I bought this DVD back in 2007. At first I thought it was a documentary about the first cases of Alien Abductions ( the cover is a little bit misleading ), so I was disappointed at first, but then I watched the documentary a second time and thought it was a very interesting documentary, talking about a lot of interesting sightings who took place in the past and even in the bible. It's a good buy, but buy it if the DVD is less than 20$, if it's over 20$ then don't buy it, after all this Doc. is only 50 minutes long. But it's a good addition to a collection.",1309392000,,562,4.072072072072072
2254330,5,B0007ZENWY,"This DVD deals with the ancient astronaut theory in which ancient gods were not really gods but in fact extraterrestrials. It is an idea that I personally subscribe to.

Not only do you get a brief overview of ancient examples of extraterrestrials, but you also get stories from guys like Stanton Friedman, Graham Hancock, and many more, and it's all narrated by Leonard Nimoy!

Very quality DVD that I have watched literally over 15 times now. I know..15 times!

5/5

2254331,5,B0007ZENWY,"ANCIENT MYSTERIES hosted by Leonard Nimoy is an interesting and valuable series on topics that range from Camelot, The Lost Colony of Roanoke, Troy, Atlantis, the Bermuda Triangle to Erich von Daniken CHARIOTS OF THE GODS territory with this entry titled UFOs - THE FIRST ENCOUNTERS. The series bounced around from network television to A&E on cable, and now it is available for consumption on DVD. This is fortunate.

UFOs - THE FIRST ENCOUNTERS provides a superb background to the many other DVDs now available on the topic of UFOs, the best of which is the film OUT OF THE BLUE. This program, for example, goes back to the original Hebrew meanings of words found in the Holy Bible in English. What did words like Nephilim really mean? Some religion scholars, clerics, and conservative interpreters of the Bible --who believe everything that they were taught in Sunday school because they choose to consider every word in their translated Bibles to be Gospel -- understandably object to having events and miracles in the Bible being seen as evidence of visitations of entities from another solar system. Perhaps some of the  interpretations might be seen to be reaching a bit at times, but the speculations of these modern science-influenced thinkers and explorers are just as credible as the supernatural, often simplistic interpretations of the Sunday school scholars whose belief-structures have not advanced since the Middle Ages. Many, but certainly not all,  seek to rule out anything that does not conform to what has been passed down to them through generations and seem to maintain the attitude: ""My mind is made up; don't confuse me with facts.""

This program does not claim to be the last word on any topic. It offers mere speculation, a fresh perspective on topics based on more recent scientific evidence. It does not preach to us -- it merely presents an array of goodies from which we can choose. Leonard Nimoy, who influenced more than one generation of STAR TREK fans with his portrayal of the logic-minded, half-alien Mr. Spock, adds dignity to the series. However, his distinctive voice does not ask us to swallow whole hog every word from the narrative. He merely asks us to approach this topic -- as with every topic in the series-- with an open mind. The script allows us to think for ourselves.

The illustrations used in the program are mere artistic interpretations. They do not claim to be empirically verifiable evidence.  In the excellent fictional film DEAD POET'S SOCIETY, John Keating (Robin Williams) asks his male students to stand on their desks in order to view the world from a new, and individual, perspective. This program UFOs -- THE FIRST ENCOUNTERS does the same.

What if we looked at what we have been taught from a different perspective? What if the pillar of fire in the desert leading the Hebrew people was a manifestation provided by an alien race? What if the silvery shields that Alexander the Great reports seeing were actually UFOs? The descriptions certainly suggest something of that nature. What fired the beams at the walls of a city that Alexander and his troops were attempting to conquer?

Okay. We are taught in logic class that he who asserts must prove the argument. He or she cannot ask someone to prove that something didn't happen. This is called ignoring the burden of proof. We also supposedly cannot beg the question -- arrive at a conclusion based on premises that we have not yet proven.

Does UFOs -- THE FIRST ENCOUNTERS ask us to prove that something did NOT happen, as the alleged psychic at the end of the silly Ed Wood film PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE asks audiences? Does this program ask us to accept conclusions based on premises that have not been proven?  Not that I noticed.

If you can, buy the DVD of the film OUT OF THE BLUE, a film that dares to offer some pretty compelling evidence -- not only of the possibility that UFOs are not of this earth -- but also of some cover-ups in the past. Credible witnesses like our ex-president and Nobel Prize winning scholar Jimmy Carter cannot be so easily dismissed. Even our ex-president Ronald Reagan spotted what appeared to be UFOs and asked what would happen to the various, quarreling nations of the world if we were faced with a threat from outer space.  Even Arthur Godfrey, venerable radio and television personality, reported sighted a UFO from his private plane. Even Gordon Cooper, former astronaut, claims in interviews to have seen extraterrestrial visitors (or onlookers) while in space. These are not witnesses from early history who lacked the knowledge of science that we possess today.

Robin Williams as John Keating in DEAD POET'S SOCIETY tells his students to think for themselves. Try it. It takes a little more effort than lazily believing what you have been taught or led to believe for a long time, but it might just be worth the effort.",1275609600,27,4889,4.833732057416268
2254332,5,B0007ZENWY,This is a great episode in an awesome A&E series hosted my Leonard Nimoy. The cover is a bit misleading. This DVD is about ancient accounts of aliens and how they've been visiting earth since the dawn of time. It also poses an interesting theory on the origins of aliens. This DVD has a spiritual aspect to it and any true seeker will enjoy the possibilities it questions.,1264291200,2,372,4.485294117647059
2254333,4,B0007ZENWY,"This DVD presents the old ancient astronauts story in every detail.  The Bible for example is looked at as a science book; basically a collection of UFO reports.  There's a lot of food for thought here, and facts I never put together.  As an example I never knew that when Moses brought down the 10 commandments his hair had turned white and his skin was shiney, as if from radiation burns.  This DVD is loaded with unusual and little known UFO facts and theories from ancient times.",1228867200,33,483,4.517241379310345
2254334,5,B0007ZENWY,"Well worth the money, a little bit expensive, but cheaper than A&E price $24.95, thought provoking and unlike most UFO's documentaries doesn't deviate from the subject and offers a wide range of little known information
I definetely recommend it along with the now out of print ?! ""OUT OF THE BLUE""",1215907200,26,298,4.862745098039215

It's narrated by Leonard Nimoy too, and in my opinion, you can never go wrong with having Spock teach you ancient aliens 101.",1356652800,,266,4.782608695652174
