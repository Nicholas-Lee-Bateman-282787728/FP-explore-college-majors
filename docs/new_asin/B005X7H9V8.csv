4902416,1,B005X7H9V8,"It's not easy to make the Civil War boring, but this pseudo-documentary manages to do it.  It starts out with the header... Volume II...uh... what happened to Volume I?  Beats me.  In the first segment it goes into excruciating detail about the seemingly dozens of commands related to holding or carrying a gun.  Snoooooooze.  The re-enactment part is actually quite good and the re-enacters are pretty good actors.  The story picks up momentarily, but then it's back to the guy fiddling with the gun.

I agree with another poster that this would be a good 'how-to' guide to future re-enactors.  After you slog through more uniform and gun details, you are back to the re-enactment which again is quite good.  Some of the narrative provides information about the daily grind of war that is interesting as well.  The next section is all about the Confederate army disbanding after Appomattox, and their struggles to get home, shuffling along on-foot with no support from the collapsed government of the South.

After that section ends with the disbanding of the Confederate Army, the next segment is all about the Army of the Potomac.... so in this segment the war is back on with the battles of Atlanta and Chickamauga.  Next, is 'Cival War' parts one and two, followed by a Confederate soldiers diary, and a two-part segment about Lincoln.

Take all the Civil War documentaries you have ever seen, put them in the blender, and you will have this one.",1359244800,11,1451,4.825910931174089
4902417,5,B005X7H9V8,"My hubby is a war buff and loves everything I get him concerning it.  Funny thing, he is from Sweden and can teach most Americans about our wars!  I guess we are more exciting.",1358380800,2,176,4.147058823529412
4902418,5,B005X7H9V8,"I am biased, but... Disc One of this documentary set includes HD, high-quality re-enactment films about different civil war battles as well as docu-drama overviews of the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia and the northern Army of the Potomac.  Perfect for the history or Civil War buff and a fantastic resource for teachers at all levels of instruction.  The other two discs contain older documentaries re-packaged from earlier releases, but for the price, this set is worth every penny for Disc One alone.",1328140800,15,510,5.132530120481928
4902419,3,B005X7H9V8,"This is a Reenactor-Soldiers Guide to the Civil War.  A how to or Video Training Manual in Camp Set-Up, Drill, Rations, ect..

Only for the Civil War Buff or Expert, not the Casual Joe.

Highly Recommend Ken Burns ""The Civil War"" or the Movie ""Gettysburg"" with Martin Sheen for the Casual Viewer.

I did find a lot of the Soldier Material Interesting...  But I can only watch ""Right Shoulder Arms"" so many times.

If you are a Buff, keep the FF button handy for the more tedious parts.

A Unique Documentary.",1327881600,30,508,4.516483516483516

8488400,5,B005X7H9V8,very informative movie for any Civil War buff!!,1487462400,,47,5.0
8488401,4,B005X7H9V8,"It's like watching a Civil War blogger.  Far too much reenactment footage.  Most of the time, as impressive as it is, is just video of reenactments with very little narration to whats happening.  Gets old real fast.  Shot nicely but it just feels like filler or footage cut from Ken Burns wannabe's.  The two other disks have a but more potential.  The Lincoln disk is great and well put together.  The Civil War p1 & 2 is ok.  The narrator is a bit flat but the old footage in nice to see.  If your a REAL BIG war buff this will be great, for the casual history buff pass on this one.",1476316800,,585,4.151785714285714
