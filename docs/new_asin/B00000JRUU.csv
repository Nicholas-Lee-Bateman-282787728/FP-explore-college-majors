7913350,4,B00000JRUU,"This is the 5th video volume of a 5 volume instructional video series on Nihon Jujutsu by Norm Belsterling.  This last volume is titled ""Throwing Techniques.""

This volume 5 is more interesting and fun to watch than the previous 4 volumes because Norm demonstrates many of the techniques covered in all the volumes of the series in a rapid free form defense against a series of surprise attacks between various instructional demonstrations of this volume.

Norm begins instruction in this video by demonstrating a ""trap block"" used to trap an opponents leg which is held in place or drawn up and back while your forward arm presses the opponent's upper body back and down.  Often this whole move is done with a 45 degree or 180 degree turn.  It has the effect of quickly taking down or throwing an opponent who is kicking you.  If done quickly by a strong individual it has the effect of turning the kicker upside down back upon his head and shoulders.  a variation of this technique is demonstrated in some Karate katas such as Heian Godan or Pinan Godan although most karate students don't know what the move really represents.  Most karate students think that the move is to block a high strike coming from behind a low strike or kick coming from the front thanks to Masatoshi Nakayama's misinterpretation of the technique.  Some karate students think that the move represents a grabbing of a male's genitals and then yanking them up and back above the shoulders and head.

Norm Belsterling demonstrates some unarmed defensive techniques against various types of knife attacks by an assailant.  He defends against a knife attack by an attacker using an over head ice-pick grip, a forward thrusting attack of the blade, a forward and upward attack against a knife that was held low and hidden and against slashing attacks.  All techniques used to defend against the knife attacks have already been covered in this video series.

Norm demonstrates ""arm-winding sacrifice throw"" and a ""body sweep throw"" against punching attacks.

There is a seven minute summary review of all techniques demonstrated in this volume toward the end.

This video is 55 minutes of instruction.  It's a pretty good instructional video series.  Many books and videos on martial arts have something demonstrated that leaves the buyer or the student dissatisfide because of poor or unrealistic instruction perhaps of a technique that a student realizes which will not work.  Those problems don't exist in this series.

I'm satisfied with each volume of the series.
