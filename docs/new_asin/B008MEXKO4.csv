8544926,5,B008MEXKO4,"Aimee's Babies videos are a ""must have"" for parents!  New and experienced parents alike will learn parenting tips, milestone comparisons, and more!  My first daughter was super fussy and the baby massage techniques I learned from Aimee's Babies, helped immensely.  As a newborn, my second daughter, struggled with passing her bowels :-)  Believe it or not, baby massage helped that TOO!  Learning all about a baby's milestones with this DVD helped keep MY baby on track.  When I felt she needed a boost to stay on track with her development, I learned valuable exercises and tips to help her achieve each milestone.  I would definitely recommend this DVD and all of Aimee's Babies products.  It makes a great baby gift too!",1350432000,,723,4.917355371900826
8544927,5,B008MEXKO4,"Now I can know exactly what to expect as my baby grows and develops. This reassuring DVD presented by the very capable and talented specialist, Aimee Ketchum keeps me informed by showing what I can expect at each stage of my baby's development. As a first time parent, I'm delighted to have such a clear and well presented and documented disk. The quality of the presentation is tops and the extra tips and exercises are very useful. The ""models"" are adorable and there are even 4 iPhone apps to go along with it. I highly recommend this for all parents!",1350000000,,554,4.55

I was blown away by how much I could impact my daughter's development in her first year!  It's well done, easy to follow, and gives me great bonding time with my daughter in addition to helping her reach her ""milestones"" (hanow that I know what milestones are)!  I had NO IDEA how important these first 12 months of interaction would be for her!  I truly feel that by following the tips and teachings of this video, I am helping my daughter with a good start on her life's journey!  I HIGHLY recommend this DVD to anyone with a child in their first year of life. I know it will be my go-to gift for my friends who are expecting!  Thank you AIMEE'S BABIES!!!",1350000000,,777,4.20945945945946
8544929,5,B008MEXKO4,"This DVD is PACKED with information! I have watched it three times and I am still learning every time I watch it. My baby is eight weeks, so I watched the newborn segment as soon as I got it and I learned so much!  I learned all about her reflexes and why she moves around the way that she does. It has really set my mind at ease because now I know that everything she does right now is normal. It's hard to know as a first time mom, what ""normal"" looks like. I have already watched the 3 month segment and started some of the recommended exercises to help her development and help her reach her milestones. There is so much information, I will probably only watch the segment that corresponds with my baby's age.
I am so excited to have this information. I have already purchased the DVD for two friends who are expecting in the next few months.
I highly recommend this DVD for all new parents. The tips and exercises are so basic and easy to understand and the DVD is so comprehensive, following babies literally throughout the whole first year.
I also like that this DVD comes pediatrician recommended and that it is done by a pediatric occupational therapist.
If you want to monitor your baby's development and learn how to help them hit all their milestone marks, buy this DVD. I haven't found anything else like it.",1350000000,,1321,4.436213991769547
