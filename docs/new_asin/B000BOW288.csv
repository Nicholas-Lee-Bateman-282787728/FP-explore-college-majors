2434141,2,B000BOW288,"I bought this at the same time that I bought the Element Ballet Conditioning video.  Ballet Bootcamp Stretch was $20 more expensive than the Ballet Conditioning video, and it wasn't half as good.  I did not enjoy the workout as much as the Ballet Conditioning one.",1206230400,6,264,4.717391304347826
2434142,5,B000BOW288,"I don't know what I was expecting, exactly; perhaps more flowing ballet-style stretches.  While there were plenty of ballet-type stretches, there were also plenty of yoga- and pilates-inspired stretches as well.  The workouts consists of 9 chapters, and you can skip to any of them at will.  Here is a rough breakdown with approximate times:  (1) Isolations: this is a fun 5-minute warmup working down from your neck to your hips; I loved the rib rolls and hip rolls, it sorta reminded me of bellydancing; (2) Standing Stretch: this 10-minute stretch routine included some flowing stretches, some static stretches, and some yoga-inspired stretches; (3) Seated Stretch: a short 5-minute mat routine with ballet-style stretches; (4) Ab Work! I was surprised to find 6 minutes of yoga- and pilates-inspired ab work in a stretch routine, but it worked here! (5) Cat Stretch: a 1-minute quick break from abs; (6) More Ab Work! More pilates-inspired ab work, including single and double stretch legs; (7) Reclining Stretch A: 6 minutes of yoga, pilates, and athletic type stretches in which the instructor demonstrates her amazing flexibility by going into a backbend (the other exercises did not do the backbend, so I didn't feel bad about not doing it, either!) (8) Reclining Stretch B: 7 minues of ballet-style stretching, mostly for legs; (9) Splits Preparation: A final 5-minute stretch done in a seated position.  Again, the instructor is able to get her legs completely parallel, but the others do not; so again, I didn't feel so bad about not being able to do it myself!

All-in-all, this was a more strenuous workout than I was expecting, but I did thoroughly enjoy it.  Jessica sounds a little raspy, like she might have lost her voice from giving so much instruction, but she is very pleasant.  No time is wasted demonstrating the moves, so if you don't know what she means by ""down-dog"" or ""passe"", you will definitely have to watch it first.  I very much enjoyed this fusion-style workout, as well as the classical music which played throughout.",1184457600,87,2052,4.976608187134503
2434153,5,B000BOW288,"I've looked for a long time for a dvd that didn't either water down the ballet elements or deliver a sub par workout. I love this dvd because it challenges me every time, and I get a good workout that leaves me feeling well stretched and thoroughly fatigued. I can't wait to make it to the next one!",1362960000,,299,4.172413793103448
2434154,5,B000BOW288,"This stretch class is really complete. I do a number of different sports and am often stiff in one area or another. When I find the time to do this video, I always feel better.",1350518400,,176,4.057142857142857
2434155,4,B000BOW288,"I was looking for a ballet style workout video, and that's what this is 'ballet style'. If you are a dancer or a dancer wannabe you'll find it unchallenging. But now for the rest of us:
Three women do a series of stretching exercises:
Warmup
Standing
Seated (toughish in places due to knee bend)
Abs 1 (tough on lower back)
Cat Stretch
Abs 2tough on lower back)
Reclining Stretch A (some challenging positions)
Relining Stretch B (workout of the feet, a rarity)
Preparation for the splits
Stretching isn't rocket science. There's a lot of stuff you've seen before, but it's well cued and put together well.  The cuing is such that once you've done the video you don't need to listen to the set up every time but just move into position. The room is a typical ballet studio (I guess for ambience). The instructor looks to have been a ballerina, and there are two other fit women.
The Abs routines put a lot of stress on the lower back and there's no modifications-you'll need to figure them out on your own. This is why I took off one star.

The video is amateurish (no matching costumes, no fancy set) but if that rings your chimes there's Leslie Sansome videos.",1319414400,2,1162,4.5285714285714285
2434156,2,B000BOW288,"This video is ok if you're looking for a relatively gentle head-to-toe yoga type stretch with some ballet influence.  I was looking more for a targeted lower extremity stretch to help me improve my ballet extensions and turnout. I'm not an expert on videography, but the quality in that regard is a bit harsh -- like it wasn't filmed through a soft lens.  The ""hoarsness"" in her voice that another reviewer complained about sounds like it may just be her natural voice -- didn't bother me at all.",1306022400,3,496,4.625
2434157,4,B000BOW288,"As a dancer of 20+ years I was excited to try out this dvd to maintain my flexibility and learn some new stretches. While the dvd offers a good variety of stretches, there's nothing here you haven't seen before if you're a dancer. If you're not a dancer I think this is a do-able exercise if you know your limits and are able to modify as needed.

As I said, this does have a nice mix of stretching exercises that are influenced by dance, yoga and pilates, and it's hard to find a good dvd that works primarily on flexibility. While it tends to focus on the legs and hips it also works your core and back and even some foot/ankle stretches are included, an area that's often neglected in workout dvds. As someone with weak ankles this was a nice addition. However, there are some things that may make this difficult for non-dancers or those who aren't as flexible. First of all, she doesn't offer any modifications. While it may be common sense to only stretch to your potential and not push yourself too far, it might have been helpful if she offered gentle reminders and alternatives for those who can not fully go into some of the stretches. Beyond offering modifications, in general she could have given more tips and instruction on proper form. Instead she just tells you where to move next, with little commentary. Also, she uses dance terminology with no explanation. If you don't know what a passe or degage is, for example, you will need to follow along visually quite a bit rather than rely on her cuing. I don't think it would be difficult to follow along in this way, i.e. the steps aren't advanced, it would just perhaps be an annoyance to those who aren't familiar with the terminology. Also, the production cost (and therefore quality) seems somewhat low. It looks as though it were shot in a small, local dance studio on a cheap camera. The music is classical ballet, bordering on cliche (a couple of Nutcracker tunes) and it is very quiet and almost inaudible at times which also makes it seem as though it were done cheaply. The women doing the workout in the background came across to me as flexible women, but ultimately untrained dancers who show incorrect form at times. I'm not sure if this would be noticeable to others but I found it slightly irritating. This combined with the production made it all seem somewhat amateurish. I wish some of the stretches were held longer and I had to do my own cardio warm up before doing this dvd in order to make sure my muscles were warm enough to fully do the stretches without risk of injury. Even with all of these concerns, I still think it is a worthwhile stretching routine and a good purchase.

The segments included are as follows:
- Isolations (5 min): Straight forward warm up consisting of shoulder rolls, hip rolls, head/neck isolations and chest isolations. She moves somewhat quickly through these though when some of them should be done more slowly to avoid injury and pain, particularly the head rolls.

- Standing Stretch (10 min): Gentle dance and yoga inspired standing stretches that work the back, chest and legs. Nothing too intense here, the most difficult is probably a standard forward bend. Kind of a nice additional warm up and intro to the stretching.

- Seated Stretch (5 min): Dance inspired floor stretches that mostly work the hips and legs. Includes a straddle stretch.

- Abs Part 1 (6 min): Pilates inspired ab work that fits in well with the stretches because she incorporates leg and back stretches into the core work.

- Cat Stretch (1 min): Fast break from the ab work. Even though I didn't find the ab work too intense I was surprised at how good the cat stretch felt stretching out my abs afterward which makes me think the ab section worked my muscles harder than I thought!

- Abs Part 2 (5 min): More abs. Includes reclining leg stretches while holding abs. Also includes putting your legs back behind your head and rolling slowly down the spine to work your core and stretch your back.

- Reclining Stretch A (6 min): Yoga and pilates inspired floor stretches that focus mostly on the back. Includes a back bend.

- Reclining Stretch B (7 min): Dance inspired floor stretches focusing mostly on the legs and hips.

- Splits Preparation (5 min): Lunges, hamstring stretches, splits and a final straddle.

All in all it adds up to about an hour. Although it's somewhat pricey and could do with some improvement, Ballet Boot Camp Stretch offers a good variety of stretches in a market where options for pure flexibility workout dvds are limited to little beyond yoga. It's a welcome addition to my exercise regimen and a nice change of pace.",1303776000,25,4646,4.633049817739976
2434158,5,B000BOW288,"It really helps to improve the flexibility ,I also have Jessica Sherwood's Ballet Bootcamp II dvd. It's also an execllent dvd. I hope she'll make some new dvd.",1301184000,2,159,4.714285714285714
2434159,5,B000BOW288,"Many of the reviews for ballet inspired workouts include complaints about lack of ballet. This video includes not only short choreographed cardio routines, but also a longer choreographed section at the end. The video flows nicely through targeted area work to full body routines. I could feel my abs burning half way through the ab section, but Jessica gently reassures you that you should be feeling a burn and that it is ok to slow down or take a break as needed. While I am no ballerina, I still harbor fantasies of playing one 'on tv' so I really enjoy the ballet moves sprinkled throughout. Even if you are not ready to do the choreographed routine at the end, the first 50 minutes give you a great workout. This has easily become my favorite workout.",1297123200,3,757,4.614814814814815
2434160,5,B000BOW288,FInally a really great stretch and flexibility plus strengthening DVD that actually flows. You can get in and do the exercises with a fluid movement and no stopping and starting to wait until they explain every conceivable detail.  She is a very disciplined instructor who gives the instruction as you do the movements so it actually flows.  I love it.  It is something that I will use to keep flexible on a regular basis.  2 thumbs up to Ballet Boot Camp Stretch!,1294358400,,464,4.621951219512195
2434161,5,B000BOW288,"This is the best ballet video class I've had,and I've owned just about all of them in a quest for a stay-at-home alternative to a $40 studio class.
It goes through routines the way you would in a classroom and Jessica goes through the technique like a real-live instructor does.
My beef with other videos is that they're structured more like a strength training work-out and fail to stress injury prevention which is boring, dangerous and doing ballet a disservice because it's such a fun and effective way of staying in shape.
I danced until I was 20, stopped for several years. This summer I got to a size 16 when I decided I wouldn't betray the sisterhood if I assessed a need to get in shape again. Since I dislike traditional exercise and I missed it I chose ballet for the job. I'm 4 sizes smaller after only 2.5 months. That means I went from an XL to a L-M before the season was over. I credit ballet boot camp with that. The awesome thing is that even when I skipped for a very busy week, the muscles kept getting leaner, a total incentive to get back on the wagon, plus it is really very fun.
I love this video so much I want to take it behind the bleachers and get it pregnant.",1291420800,22,1188,4.2844444444444445
2434162,4,B000BOW288,"I really like the detailed instructions.  The instructor has a warm but non-nonsense style that does not get annoying with repeated viewing.  The glute work (turn in, turn out, lift and lower - you know what I am talking about!) and the center barre work offer variety and challenging workout.  It is all in the technique - anyone who says they do not feel it or it is too easy is not doing it right.  I used to do high impact aerobics thinking that was the ultimate in staying in shape, but the ballet/pilates/yoga combination workouts offer a better, more graceful way to do that.  Also, I like how the production is not too slick and the people in the video appear to be everyday people and diverse - young, old, in great shape, in so-so shape.  Onto Ballet Boot Camp 2.",1288483200,6,773,4.408450704225352
2434173,5,B000BOW288,"I am rather flexible due to a martial arts background and I was looking for something a bit challenging to keep up my flexibility.  While I can do the splits, it is not without serious warm up, concentration, and effort.  This workout is the perfect level for me.  I believe the moves include a mix of ballet, pilates, and yoga.  It wasn't cardio but I had worked up a light sweat from the effort at the end.  Great for my break/recovery day between higher intensity workouts.  I had first tried Ballet Boot Camp 2 (which wasn't for me, unfortunately) but I liked the instructor and decided to give this a try.",1286409600,3,610,4.45045045045045
2434174,3,B000BOW288,"I bought this video from the other reviews. I took ballet many years ago but this was a little too much for me. Not sure what I was expecting but this was not it. If you are good at ballet you will enjoy this video, definitely not for a novice dancer. Way too many moves without instructions on how to do them. I will repeat this is for ballet dancers.",1284249600,3,352,4.042857142857143
2434175,4,B000BOW288,"I really like this DVD. I was almost exactly what I was looking for. I am new to real stretching and I wanted more stretches that will lengthen the muscles I use in ballet, and ultimately increase my flexibility. I believe this DVD will do it if I do it regularly. The background is plain, they are in a studio that is pretty nondescript. The music is classical and appropriate. The instructor is obviously very flexible. My complaint is this: there are several chapters and each time a new one starts they are already in the pose and stretching and you have to rush to get in whatever position and do it. That is a bit annoying. Also, she doesn't give  modifications for the section on learning the splits. This is fine if you know where your limit is, but she also does not help you safely come out of the some of the stretches. She assumes you have complete flexibility to move out of it the way she does and this is dangerous. I have felt my knees about to pop trying to get out of the move in time to get to the next position. I do not like that at all and may have to stop using her video for the splits and backbend although I want to learn both very much. I will have to find a book or something that gives better decriptions on modifications and coming out them safely. You can really injure yourself it you don't. Other than that, I feel fully relaxed and stretched and all of the other stretches are great. The abs section is tough but effective. If you are highly flexible, you will have no problems. If you are only somewhat flexible, know your limitations on the backbend and splits sections.",1282694400,2,1606,4.317880794701987
2434176,5,B000BOW288,"I am not, in any way, as flexible as the woman who demonstrates the stretches on this DVD, but you know, I like it anyway.

It's nice to watch myself getting millimeters closer to being able to do the stretches as far as she does, and I like having the evidence before my eyes that human beings really can do things like that, so one day I'll be able to too. And not all the stretches are beyond my abilities by any means.

She does not show alternative ways of doing a stretch if you're not flexible enough for her way (this IS a Boot Camp DVD), she just assumes you'll go as far as you can. I can imagine many people not liking this, but I don't mind at all. I like being left to my own devices instead of having her say every stretch, ""now, if you can't go this far, then just go as far as you can with control,"" or something like that. I can figure that out for myself.

She does not explain what the different ballet terms she uses mean, she just does them, expecting you too keep up, which is all right when you remember that she can't stop you from rewinding the DVD a time or two. Besides the ballet, there's several other influences as well, including yoga, pilates, and the every-day stretches you learned in gym class. I like her approach of using whatever works best while avoiding being too new-age-y or too boring. There are plenty of stretches I've never seen anywhere else--especially for hips and quadriceps; they're wonderful! I have very tight hips, so it's great to finally find stretches that focus on them.

The abdominal workouts are amazingly challenging. I've worked them into my strength training regiment and then skip them when I just want to do the DVD to stretch. But doing them with her in order works too; there's plenty of stretching both before and after the ab workouts, so you won't be sore.

All in all, this is a challenging, diverse, and no-nonsense stretching DVD that's wonderful for leading you through a thorough stretch for any fitness level.",1282521600,10,1986,4.460055096418733
2434177,5,B000BOW288,"If you want to get more flexible, This is a terrific stretch. Classical music to listen to, the production is not high quailty BUT, I'm glad I purchased it, do this Video at least 3 times a week,you can do every other day.

2434178,5,B000BOW288,"I bought myself a few DVD's including the N.Y city ballet workout but this one was the only one that was challenging & yet very gentle. A real delight!!!
I have only 1 year of ballet experience & I'm over 35.
I like the instructor: She's very clear, simple, down to earth with a pleasant voice. Not the type of person that will get on your nerves while you're sweating & suffering.
The whole experience is very invigorating & relaxing.
No jerking or jumping around; Just what I needed & 3 weeks later (4 times a week), my inner thighs & bottom look much better!!
One flaw: The video editing + quality are not that great but I love what this workout did to my body so I'll give it 5 stars anyways!",1274227200,14,696,4.2406015037593985
2434179,5,B000BOW288,"I was a dancer until I turned 18. Now I'm 37 and I love how great of a stretch I get from this work out. I don't like yoga because I'm always dying for an old school dance class stretch that addresses all your major muscles in a direct way.

I've owned this dvd for a while, but I've become addicted to it because it feels so great to get a full body stretch. Plus, it's nice on the days that you don't want to work out so hard, but you still want to do some sort of exercise. My flexibility is increasing everytime I do it - looks like I'll be able to do the splits again soon!

Might not be so good for someone without ballet training...",1270252800,2,639,3.945736434108527
2434180,5,B000BOW288,"This is my favorite exercise video, for when I have the time.  She focuses on fitness and strength for the floor exercises and the final dancing sequence, and spends most of her time working on exercises to train the muscles used in ballet.  I have never been much of a dancer, but the music and structure of ballet classes always appeals to me and this video is perfect.  Jessica leads a fairly large class of variously-shaped and -skilled students, so it is not intimidating but is very inspiring.  I find it to be quite a challenge, with the high number of repetitions involved and then the dance routine at the end, but it is certainly do-able and extremely well taught.  And if you ask me, I'd rather do a muscle-strengthening and cardio routine to Tchaikovsky music than to anything else!",1257465600,15,794,4.642857142857143
2434181,4,B000BOW288,"This was a good video to help loosen and stretch the body.  I did not find it very vigorous -- not like a traditional boot camp -- but it was what I was looking for.  I consider this a good warm up or cool down for more vigorous exercise, and I use it before or after I do a heavy body sculpt workout or after a dance class.",1234310400,,324,3.75
2434182,5,B000BOW288,"I own both the element ballet dvd and the ballet bootcamp stretch dvd. They are really different! The element ballet dvd has a lot of standing exercises and it's more like a ballet class at the barre. Sometimes you have to do a lot of repetitions and you feel that your muscles are getting sore! So if you like that kind of workouts, buy it!

I really prefer the ballet bootcamp stretch dvd. It doesn't have too many repetitions and it helps to improve the flexibility (for example with the splits). I'm 42 years old and recently started ballet class for beginners. I think both these dvd's are very good for a ballet beginner, and I would advice to buy them both!

I also have Jessica Sherwood's Ballet Bootcamp II dvd. It's also a really good dvd. I hope she'll make some new dvd's in this serie, I'm quite a fan of hers!",1224288000,17,823,4.372549019607843
8090286,2,B000BOW288,"I was really excited to receive this because of all of the positive ratings. I was really hoping to gain some new knowledge about how to gain more flexibility. However, being not in the least bit flexible, I was surprised at how many people thought these stretch positions were hard to get get into and out of. I really think think these positions are something geared more towards beginners in their difficulty and I only saw a very small handful of new stretches that weren't already common knowledge for me. I feel like if youve ever taken a gym class then youve gotten half of them covered and if youve ever taken any other sort of dance or fitness class youve seen almost all of the other stretches. Basically, I don't think Ill ever use this video because I already have those stretches in the back of my head and can sit on my floor and do all of those things. Also, they seemed to have stuck in some abdominal workouts, but I only wanted it for stretching. Im not sure if Ill go through the trouble of returning it, but I definitely regret buying it because Ive found hundreds of better stretch videos on YouTube while I was waiting on this.",1513382400,,1149,4.4245283018867925
8090287,3,B000BOW288,"This is definitely not what I expected, but when I looked again at the name and realized it has the word ""stretch"" in it, I realized it does live up to that part of its name once I thought about it. The name of the video is a bit of an oxymoron, because by using the word ""boot camp"", I can't see how anyone can be led to think that this is going to be anything less than very intense. Because of this, the name can be very misleading. If you are looking for an intense workout in any direction, this is NOT the video for you. If you, on the other hand, are looking for a smooth, gentle, but great stretching video that is a wonderful combo of ballet and yoga; along with some mellow pilates-style core exercises mixed in, then you'll be right on target with this one.

Who I think this would be great for:
- Beginner beginners! People who either haven't worked out in a LONG time, or are just getting into it.
 - Someone who just wants a very relaxing body-opening experience. I like to pull this out as a first-of-the-morning video when I'm still half asleep, as a nice gentle way to open up into the day. Or, as a before-bed video.
- Someone who is not looking for any sweating (unless, again, they're a very beginner with exercise...in which case they MIGHT get some sweat, I'm not sure)

Who this will NOT be good for:
- Anyone who is looking for what is normally meant by ""boot camp"". Honestly, I think it's quite a joke that she even uses those words in the title of the video, because it's anything but.
- Anyone who will be turned off by a dated-feeling set-up.

What I like:
- As I said, I like this video when I just want a smooth, mellow, body-opening experience. It's very tranquil, it has classic ballet music in the background, and her energy is very calming.
- It's very clear and basic. No fanfare, no ra-ra...just a clear, well-explained, run through of some graceful movements and exercises. She has a very calming energy.

What I don't like:
- There is absolutely no introduction for new exercises, and the video segments are extremely choppy. For example, you'll be finishing one segment standing, and then all of a sudden it flashes to a new segment and not only are they on the floor with mats (nothing is said about having a mat at the ready, ever) and there is no explanation about what they're doing now, but they're already starting the exercises! It just IMMEDIATELY goes into the exercises, so you have no time at all to even get into the position before you've missed part of what they're doing. They're not ever complicated movements so it's not like it's hard to figure out what they're doing, it's just that you're always racing to get into position whenever a segment changes. I've learned that you just have to already know what yous should be prepared for (after watching the video once through), and that you should probably just pause the video between segments so you can get into position so you won't miss anything. Not a big deal, but definitely docked a star for this, as it's such a simple quality issues that's unnecessary. I wouldn't NOT get this video because of this if you're thinking of getting it, but just know that the first run-through will be quite choppy for you...which is a bummer, because that choppyness is so opposite from the energy of the video, really messing up the ""flowing"" energy of the whole thing.
- Very poor filming quality. It starts out with a close up of the instructor which then pans out very shakily, as if it's her buddy filming with a camera-phone or something and they're just walking backwards, wobbling the camera the whole time. Luckily, this does get much better for the duration of the rest of the video, but it's a very poor first impression.
- This feels like it's out of some nondescript decade, very dated feeling but from who knows when. I feel like this shouldn't matter, but the women behind her are just dressed so...doudy, I guess would be the word. Maybe she purposefully did this so that women who aren't into trends or fashion and who don't look like the typical ballerina or gym rat or yogi would feel comfortable...but for me it's kind of a turn off. Just feels too dated. Again, this isn't a big enough deal to not get the video, but I feel a little more thought could have been put into the details, like presentation, the participants being a little more coordinated...just a tad bit of flare to make the video not feel like such a thrown together home-job.

Overall, I do like this video, but with just a little more thought into the details mentioned above; like presentation, some introductions to what will be happening in the next segments, and some smoother camera work, this would have earned another star.",1434412800,2,4716,4.509941520467836
8090288,5,B000BOW288,"I bought Bootcamp 2 first and wondered what could make Bootcamp 1 cost so much. The reviews caused me to eventually purchase it. However, imagine my surprise when I opened it to find ONE disc, not 2. So I thought...""Maybe there is twice the running time on that one."" Nope! Just about 65 minutes. So, this is the most expensive DVD in that series. Loved the training - reminds me of my years of ballet. But, the listing is wrong. That should be corrected.

Then...at the end of the DVD, they tell you there is a website for ballet boot camp (this was NOT on the bootcamp 2 DVD). So I went over there to see if there were any new offerings in the series. Imagine my surprise when I find THIS DVD listed there for...$19.95. OK...I got ripped off here with the price. Not sure why anyone else who reviewed this FAILED to alert prospective buyers of both issues. I won't return it though...lesson learned.

So..the CONS: there isn't 2 DVDs - you are paying 50 bucks for ONE - 2.5 times the going price for a new one at the ballet bootcamp website. That is the only con here. It is worth 20 bucks, just like the second ballet bootcamp. But 50 bucks? That'll be your call.

By the way, the DVD opens with stretching...more extensive stretching that I'd do without being warmed up first. From what I recall of my years of ballet classes, we warmed up before class even started. That was pretty much expected. So, if you choose not to warm up, I suggest you do the aerobic section (the second section) first, then go back to the first section.",1418860800,,1535,4.378947368421053

8090291,4,B000BOW288,"I was looking for a variety to add to my stretching videos. I like this one a lot, it is a bit long but is divided into chapters so that is helpful when I am in a time crunch. I certainly would not call it a ""boot camp"" as that has connotations of difficulty. It is a very good totally body stretch. Has some ab work in it but that is important for keeping the abs strong so that the back remains limber.",1381708800,,404,3.8795180722891565
8090292,4,B000BOW288,"Loved this dvd.  I felt that the workout was really a good one.  The dancer leading the class was extremely personable.
I like nyc ballet workout better, but this one will get use on the rotation of my exercise dvd's",1371513600,,216,4.375

8090294,5,B000BOW288,"I have accidentally written my review under Ballet Boot Camp Stretch. Sorry about this. It has the same score and title. Please, go there to read it.

Overall, I highly recommend Ballet Boot Camp (both DVDs 1 and 2) and Ballet Boot Camp Stretch for everyone with at least 1 year of ballet experience. You may think it is not rigorous enough and not useful enough only if you can easily dance on pointe and do professional ballet.",1367798400,,429,4.5
8090295,5,B000BOW288,"I think that a lot was said about this video. Jessica Sherwood is just a wonderful teacher, I do not know where she currently teachers, but if I were in that city, I would do everything to join her classes.

Based on my experience with this video and with ballet classes in general, let me share who MAY and MAY NOT benefit from it.
If you want to strengthen your body to prepare it for dance classes during the week, to avoid injuries from dance classes, and to cover all muscle groups + dance moves, this video is for you. It is for kids and adults. It features only adults, but if your kid has at least 1 year of ballet experience, you should encourage her/him to use this DVD at home at least once a week to avoid injuries and build up their core strength and turn-out.

It is possible that if you are a super experienced ballet dancer, who can easily dance on pointe, then you may need a stronger workout than this one.

Ballet Boot Camp, DVD 1, is on Youtube. See for yourself. Ballet Boot Camp, DVD 2, is not. I bought both because I hope that Jessica Sherwood (the teacher) is receiving some kind of royalty from sales. I just love her.",1367798400,4,1144,4.2626728110599075
