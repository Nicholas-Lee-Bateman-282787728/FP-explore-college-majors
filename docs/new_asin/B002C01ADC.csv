8362725,4,B002C01ADC,"`A Queen Is Crowned' is the colour documentary of the Queen's coronation as shown in cinemas at the time of the event. It starts with footage from around the UK and Sir Lawrence Olivier narrating about the splendour of our `sceptred isle' before moving on to the actual coronation itself. You follow the Queen as she travels to Westminster Abbey in the magnificent golden coach, see the various rituals and oaths of the ceremony (all explained by the narrator), see the various dignitaries honour the Queen and parade out of the abbey and see the huge armed forces as they parade en masse through the streets of London. Finally you end with the Queen waving to the massed crowds as they swarm the mall and Buckingham Palace to honour their new Queen. The costumes, ornaments of state and setting are truly awe inspiring and the pomp and ceremony are fascinating to watch. The score from The London Symphony Orchestra is uplifting and completely in keeping with the ambiance of the day. It is interesting to see the Coronation in colour and with explanations after seeing brief exerts over the years at various royal mile stones. If you have even a passing interest in this event I'd recommend this DVD, it makes for interesting viewing and places the reign of our Queen in that bit deeper context.

I like this doco and, eventually, one day this DVD will be combined with ""The Queen's Coronation: Behind the Palace Doors"", the most recent BBC produce.",1262044800,2,282,4.875
