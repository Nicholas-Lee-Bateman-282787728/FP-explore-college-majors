516348,4,6302800471,This ovie was enjoyable because of the actors but it plainly ended too soon. I would have liked  resolution between Meg and her husband.,1360108800,,136,4.666666666666667
516349,5,6302800471,This movie is an excellent view of how modern medicine views anything off the main road. With mistrust and suspicion. A strong tale showing how allopathic and naturopathic medicine can work together to improve health care. Fabulous rendition of Meg laurel by Lindsay Wagner. I watch this movie yearly just to remind myself to keep my mind open to that which is not yet proven by science!,1350950400,3,387,4.791044776119403
516350,5,6302800471,The movie was great it showed the triumph of good over evil and that sometimes one must take the less traveled and let their heart lead them down that path.,1343865600,,156,4.233333333333333
516351,5,6302800471,"The delivery was quick, the quality of the DVD is excelent, and the movie...........Well, the movie:I remember watching this movie as a young adult. The scene where the mountain doctor used maggots to cure an ear infection.....I would never forget. As I got older I thought this must have inspired Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman. I love everything Lindsay Wagner has ever done.....so if your an avid fan as I am you're going to love it......if you are not, you will still find yourself enjoying a ""Little House On The Prairie"" style story that's takes us back to a more simpler time.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Incredible-Journey-of-Doctor-Meg-Laurel/dp/B004CZZZLS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Incredible Journey of Doctor Meg Laurel</a>",1335916800,5,779,6.090909090909091
516352,5,6302800471,This movie was absolutely wonderful! I would recommend anyone who is a Lindsay Wagner fan to see this movie. I love everything it stands for and of course Lindsay's performance was absolutely perfect. So far since getting this movie I have watched it 4 times and I think I am going to watch it again tonight.,1313971200,,308,4.517857142857143
516353,4,6302800471,"I saw this movie on tv years ago, and finally was able to purchase it on DVD.  There were several very short pauses in the dvd when it appeared a commercial may have been inserted.  Also, there were a couple of areas when the dvd briefly ""broke up"".  But, I didn't think it was significant enough to warrant return. If you're into folklore of the ""blue ridge"" mountains, I believe this movie would interest you.  Basically, a young doctor (Lindsay Wagner) suffers hardships when she tries to bring modern medicine to distrusting mountain families that were only accustomed to the natural cures given to them by their ""mountain medicine woman"" (Jane Wyman).",1299974400,18,656,4.830357142857143
516354,5,6302800471,I Love this movie.  It is a good wholesome movie.  Makes you stop and think of times gone by.  Very well made.  I Love Lindsay Wagner.,1276646400,,134,4.038461538461538
516355,2,6302800471,"As a hillbilly, I'm not offended by that term. I am offended by this movie, though. This collective group of hill people make the Beverly Hillbillies look like Albert Einsteins.

The production values and writing are poor. The plot is predictable and cheesey. Don't waste your time. Just turn on the Hallmark channel and watch a couple of episodes of Little House instead. They won't be quite as ridiculous, but they'll hit ya in the same place.",1184112000,2,445,4.779220779220779
516356,4,6302800471,"What begins as what seems to be a fish out of water story becomes a tale of tolerance for others and the acceptance of that which we cannot change.

Dr. Meg Laurel (portrayed by Lindsey Wagner) was once one of them, an Appalachian mountains resident (my mother being of the same heritage was never a hillbilly so I resent calling them that) who suffered at the hands of a ""healer"" while a small child.

Fast forward to Dr. Meg as a medical doctor now living in Boston suffering nightmares of her mistreatment so long ago.  Following several discussions with her husband, the decision is made to ""exorcise"" her demons in the form of returning to the Appalachians so as to render modern medical care to those she thought she had left behind so long ago.

Following a rough beginning, losing much of her possessions over the edge of a ridge, Dr. Meg attempts to incorporate herself into the society that by its very nature refuses to accept her.  She is given constant reminders of the life that could have been hers but for the grace of God.  She attempts to care for a man who should have died but was somehow saved by Granny (portrayed by Jane Wyman) and has a greater time of convincing these people her knowledge and skill as a medical practitioner is really the best way to go.

Dr. Meg is also witness to a wedding between a middle-aged man to a child who is now responsible for raising children not much younger than herself.  The fear and concern she shows of this arrangement is never more evident than when the child tells her that at the tender age of about twelve or thirteen she was becoming concerned she would be an ""old maid"".

She eventually develops a ""friendship"" of sorts with Granny who she trusts enough to care for her when she develops a cough.  To be sure, the treatments Granny utilizes have always been viable for someone with an understanding of nature and even acupuncture, but as a doctor, Dr. Meg has a difficult time accepting this.  However, Granny is witness to some miracles of ""modern"" science as well and comes to see that her way isn't always the best way either.

So as not to give away any ending, the synopsis should stop here but to say this is definitely a movie worth seeing, if for no other reason than to see the beautiful scenery that is the Appalachian Mountains, is an understatementThe best reason to watch it is because it gives a wonderful look inside a society that refuses to change, unless it's kicking and screaming, and refuses to allow outsiders in, unless there's a good reason to allow it.

I had to give this movie only four out of five stars due to the poor appalchian accents applied to some of these people.  While James Woods is wonderful as the sin eater, his accent is just a bit over the top.  Some of the females in this movie perform accents that are also too much.  Having visited the Appalachians as much as I have, having relatives still living there, I can assure you the accents aren't as pronounced as this movie would have you believe.

If you like this movie, watch&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Songcatcher/dp/B00005O0SO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Songcatcher</a>.  with Aiden Quinn and Janet McTeer.

The story is very good, showing how herbal treatments and medicene does not have to be foes against each other.  Powerful performances by Wagner, Wyman and Woods.

Unfortunately she clashes with both the local healer and the townspeople.  She must learn that her way isn't the only way that works.

People had to work very hard for a living,I guess the bad thing was that Meg Laurel[Lindsay Wagner] for a long time in the movie wasn't given a fair chance to practice her doctoring skills because the people in the town were use to an very very old fashioned doctor and because of that FOR THE LONGEST TIME IN THE MOVIE she didn't have a chance until Meg helped  save a young woman's life and helped deliver her baby and then everyone got along with Meg thanks to the other doctor mentioning to the town of how good she was and everything was great after that.",1517097600,,685,4.310077519379845
7831815,5,6302800471,"My then teenage daughter and I watched this movie many years ago.  (She's 40 now.)  She still speaks of it.  Some time back I ordered her the video and she literally squealed with delight.  The movie had deep meaning for us.  My grandmother was a ""granny"" midwife in the Ozarks of Arkansas.  She was not inundated with the superstitions set forth in this movie set in the Appalachian mountains, but did face some of the same challenges.  Working with the few doctors could at times be difficult.  She had her cures.  She felt the woods and the mountains were God's pharmacy.  For awhile she lived in Oklahoma, then ""Indian Territory,"" across a creek that divided the homesteaders land from the Indian reservation. When they had a woman having difficulties giving birth they came for her bringing a horse for her to ride.  When faced with ""white man's sickness"" they came for her.  They taught her their cures, she taught them hers.  Eventually they learned to work together through mutual respect.  Now, as I write her story, I recalled this movie and ordered my own copy, I had a glimpse back into some of the things she faced.  True, the situations were different, but this video shows that there are more than one way to practice medicine, it carries over even today.  This video will appeal to anyone interested in the history of early lay midwives, also known as ""granny midwives"" and ""grannies"" who treated the mountain folks with methods that worked, though unconventional.  It may seem that this was something from the far distant past but before you think that, watch the video.  You will recognize some things from the 21st century.  Natural medicine, herbs, botanicals, acupuncture, relaxation techniques, and a new movement today of doctors willing to incorporate these things into their practice.  I love this video for its historical value as well as its breathtaking drama.  Lindsay Wagner does an excellent job of portraying Dr. Meg Laurel.  It's Five Stars for me.  I really hope many people will purchase and view this video so that this history of a time not all that long ago and its influence on medicine today can be seen by those too young to have been blessed as I was to hear the stories first-hand, from my own grandmother.",1508630400,,2249,4.769430051813472
