5910750,3,B00EF1PL4K,"Warner bros are just recycling their blu-ray's that's all, no new extras, no new master audio mixes
instead of buying the individual blu-ray's of Demolition man, Over the top, Tango & cash which would cost maybe $8-$9 each Disc
you can get all 3 Discs in 1 blu-ray case for a cheap amazon price of $13.80 which is about $4 somethin' a Disc
all 3 Discs are exactly the same as the individual releases which means the same 5.1 master audio mixes
only different packaging
DEMOLITION MAN has the Joel silver & Andrei Audio commentary track from the very old dvd release
OVER THE TOP, TANGO & CASH have their usual Theatrical trailers

$13.80 for all 3 films in 1 case what a bargain, so your saving money actually
so your better off buying the triple blu-ray set if you love these 3 films
only 3 stars for 3 barebone's blu-ray's
so 3 stars for this new triple set based on no new extras, no new audio mixes, just a typical recycle",1436227200,3,926,4.383720930232558

5910754,5,B00EF1PL4K,"Im a 90s guy, and Stallone was not my favourite actor, but he was the man with movies full of adrenaline and coolness, Demolition Man, and Tango & Cash are excellent examples, those 2 make this set excellent, over the top is a good movie, but not in the league of the others, at least for me.",1406160000,,292,4.140350877192983
5910755,5,B00EF1PL4K,Stallone displays his ability to experience in any walk of life. Over the Top is a great example. He was awesome showing his son the facts of real life.,1394150400,,152,4.275862068965517

5910757,4,B00EF1PL4K,"Over the top thats why! Sylvester is awesome in all three of these movies, and the blu ray looks great!",1390089600,,103,4.2
5910758,5,B00EF1PL4K,"Sylvester Stallone: Triple Feature (Blu-Ray Edition) is a great set to add to your movie collection.  With this triple pack you get Tango and Cah, Over the Top, and Demolition Man.  This triple pack is right now on sale for under $14 dollars.  I can say that I enjoyed watching all three of these movies and I sometimes find myself popping one of them in on weekends.  If you have Amazon Prime you can get free 2 day shipping.  I cannot recommend this deal any higher.  But if you are unfamiliar with any of these movies I have included a summary of each movie below.

Tango and Cash - Beverly Hills Detective Ray Tango (and Downtown Los Angeles Detective Gabriel Cash have earned themselves a reputation for disrupting crime lord Yves Perret's smuggling operation in their respective jurisdictions.  One day, both of them are informed of a drug deal taking place later that night. Both detectives meet each other for the first time at the location, but discover a dead body that is wire-tapped before the FBI arrive and surround the duo. Agent Wyler finds Cash's pistol on the floor and arrests both Cash and Tango. At their murder trial, Tango and Cash are incriminated by an audio tape, secretly given to Wyler by Perret's henchman Requin and verified in court by an audio expert, which appears to reveal them shooting the undercover FBI agent after discussing a drug purchase. They plead no contest to a lesser charge in exchange for reduced sentences in a minimum-security prison, but are transported to a maximum-security prison to be housed with many of the criminals they arrested in the past.

Over the Top is a 1987 action drama film starring Sylvester Stallone. It was produced and directed by Menahem Golan, and the screenplay was co-written by Stallone.  The main character, played by Stallone, is a long-haul truck driver who tries to win back his alienated son while becoming a champion arm wrestler.

Demolition Man is a 1993 American science fiction action film directed by Marco Brambilla his directorial debut, and starring Sylvester Stallone and Wesley Snipes. The film was released in the United States on October 8, 1993.

The film tells the story of two men--one, an evil crime lord; the other, a risk-taking police officer--who are cryogenically frozen in the year 1996 and reawakened in 2032. Following a massive earthquake in 2010 that destroyed much of Los Angeles, it merged with San Diego to form a planned city called San Angeles in which all crime has seemingly been eliminated from mainstream society.

Again I would definitely recommend this Triple pack and thank you for reading my review.",1387152000,4,2623,4.867415730337079

5910772,5,B00EF1PL4K,Why get one Stallone movie when you can get three at the same time? I asked myself this question when I was looking for Over the Top on blu ray and I answered it when I bought this triple feature. All of these movies are great. Especially Over the Top. Arm wrestling action movies are a dying breed.,1466726400,,299,4.172413793103448

5910774,4,B00EF1PL4K,"A great collection of some older films. They all have average to good transfers and look better than they ever have on any other format by a wide margin. The films themselves are pretty decent. I think Tango and Cash is probably the best one, although the others have their strengths and weaknesses. At any rate it's three decent films from Stallone and a fairly cheap price. Lower bitrates abound but altogether they look like older bluray films should for the most part.",1460764800,3,472,4.698795180722891

8604913,5,B00EF1PL4K,"So much Stallone so little time. For the price you can't beat it. These are some of my childhood favorite movies. Especially Over The Top. But Demolition man and Tango and Cash are pretty good now, though demolition man is a bit dated. Picture quality is good a step if from DVD especially for such old movies. I'd say go for it.",1505692800,,329,4.32258064516129
