5188883,4,B008XAT1M2,I loved these movies. So when I saw them in a double feature I was excited. I mostly like Bette Middler movies.,1425772800,,111,4.090909090909091
5188884,5,B008XAT1M2,It should be a requirement for anyone who works in health care to watch 'The Doctor.'  It's a favourite of mine.,1423872000,,112,4.333333333333333
5188885,4,B008XAT1M2,"Bought this disc mostly for the ""Stella"" film, for I wanted to get rid of my vhs tape of it. Yikes! Did I just type vhs tape?",1416960000,,125,3.6666666666666665
5188886,5,B008XAT1M2,"Two great movies in the one package. The picture and the sound fer both are  good, and a great job has been done with the blu-Ray reproduction. If you have not seen The Doctor and you like a human interest story this is the one for you. Stella is a great movie with that wonderfull actress Bette Midler. The heartwarming performace on how a mothers love and her happines sheplaces on the line for her daughter, is really touching. These movies are a great price and I reccomend this set to you.

5188887,5,B008XAT1M2,"The Doctor is one of my favorite movies. I have given this movie to my own doctors as gifts to remind them of the human factor in medicine.  It's not a great movie by any means, but it shows a side of medicine that is often taken for granted and that's why I like it.  I think William Hurt plays his part well, although he's more personable and humorous than any surgeon I've ever known.",1374192000,,387,4.1466666666666665
5188888,4,B008XAT1M2,good upgrade from standard dvd and very good value for money. hopefully we see more from the Touchstone back catalogue released on Bluray by Mill Creek...,1362096000,,154,4.961538461538462
5188889,5,B008XAT1M2,"Mill Creek does it again, this time with two dramas, BOTH of these are rated PG-13
Both are in thier original widescreen ratios, and have optional english captions.

The PQ and AQ are great with this release.

The Doctor stars William Hurt, Elizabeth Perkins, and Alan Arkin.

Stella stars Bette Midler, and John Goodman.

Mill Creek is really releasing some stellar products lately!
