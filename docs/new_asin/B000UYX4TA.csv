When I tell students that chickens love to eat grass and leaves and will perch in the trees at night like ""real"" birds, they're amazed. Our Feathered Friends shows chickens living busy, contended and dramatic lives in an open farm setting where roosters and hens and their young scratch the ground for food, drink from streams, run here and there as their interest is piqued, perch in trees, and show affection for each other and the people who care for them.

One benefit of this film is that it shows chicks hatching in the spring with their mother hens, where they belong, instead of being mechanically incubated, then hatching, motherless and pitifully alone, in sterile surroundings.

I did wince when the child narrator referred to chickens preening themselves as ""greasing."" Chickens have a preen oil gland at the base of their tail. With their beaks they distribute this oil through their feathers and all over their skin as a form of waterproofing, since chickens evolved in a wet tropical forest habitat that, despite centuries of domestication, is encoded in their genes. Wild chickens continue to live in the jungle to this day.

Chickens are energetic, beautiful, social birds with endless curiosity. Roosters protect their hens and their young from predators, and both parents will fight fiercely, even to death, to protect their chicks. Our Feathered Friends captures the vibrancy and warmth of chickens. Ir makes an excellent contrast, for older students, 6th grade and up, to the horrific conditions of chickens on industrial farms that can be seen on YouTube and obtained from animal advocacy organizations.
