Extremely informative, and a major wake up call to those who don't believe in global warming or species extinction at a rapid rate.",1360800000,13,431,4.5256410256410255
5459190,5,B00ANDGYQS,"Wisdom, knowledge, perspective, humility; inspirational!  I watched ""Our Fragile Planet"" yesterday on PBS. It was amazing: even though David Attenborough is getting on a bit these days, he is still fresh -- and still passionate about protecting life on this planet, in all its glory and diversity. If there is anyone we should listen to on our tiny biosphere floating in space, it is him. You can catch this episode at pbs.org for a while. I will be getting the full DVD set shortly: I have no doubt the other two episodes are just as inspirational.",1360454400,37,549,4.71875

While to be included in his lifes work as one of the many great Documentary achievements,  this is one of not only his, but the entire genre's best and certainly worth owning. Sir David Attenborough is the master in regards to the Nature Documentary genre, and this work continues to edify his accomplishments. As the title eludes it is a compilation of his body of work and is positively well done as always. Thank you  Sir David Attenborough for this and all your many Nature Documentaries, I for one learned through your voice countless awe inspiring facts about animals and nature, how to love and adore the wonderful facets of our GOD given planet.

5459230,5,B00ANDGYQS,"Attenborough does it again.  Without his narration, these features would not have the same meaning.  The cameramen should be just as noted, though.

5459235,5,B00ANDGYQS,"We are huge fans of David Attenborough and have virtually all the recent nature specials on blu ray, we don't have too many of the older ones which this offers some great snippets from. It gets more behind the scenes than any of the major productions so it's great to see it all from another angle. As a fan to other fans I highly recommend picking this up... partly because watching the other stuff over and over gets old and you need something new but also because it's a great blu ray in general, packed with things that the big features can't show.",1440028800,,552,4.368932038834951

5459237,4,B00ANDGYQS,"Could have been SO much better. Of course, the content was amazing and the history was enlightening and informative. However, it only lasted a couple hours. The description says 150 minutes. NOPE! That is incorrect. A life as long and storied as Mr. Attenborough's should be attributed to about eight hours of footage and back-history. Other than that, what WAS there was enjoyable and well-presented.

Thank you for your humor, wisdom, and service Mr. Attenborough! sss",1438819200,5,470,5.184210526315789

5459241,4,B00ANDGYQS,"Like many, I grew up watching David Attenborough nature programs. As a kid I would marvel at the places he went and animals he told me about. I would imitate his voice and laugh at some of the ridiculous situations he put himself in (once INSIDE a termite mound!). So this was a must see for me. As usual with anything involving Attenborough, this did not disappoint. It was especially interesting to see a lot of his older stuff going all the way back to the 50's. I only wish there was more. Maybe I'm spoiled from recent mini series like Planet Earth and Frozen Planet, but at just 3 hour long episodes I was hoping it would go further in depth with his history.

Either way, it's a great watch and one that any Attenborough fan will enjoy and appreciate.",1435276800,,758,4.375886524822695

5459261,5,B00ANDGYQS,"David Attenborough at the end years of his life gives perspectives on nature and life that any good history and nature student would appeciate.

5459264,5,B00ANDGYQS,"This was a pleasant surprise.
NATURE and BBC have collated pieces of the creme-de-la-creme of Attenborough's adventures and interposed them with interviews of Sir David.  That is not the surprise. The surprise is that they have sharpened the old footage to near-Blu-Ray quality.

If you feel inspired by David Attenborough, this is a keepsake.
Yes, there are recycled pieces from ""Making of Trials of Life"" and ""40 years on the air""; but I can listen to them over and over again.
I loved it because the interviews reveal Sir David's deep understanding of nature and I could travel with him (in spirit) on these superb adventures.
I liked it because was Blu-Ray; it really makes a difference when it comes to natural history films.
I am sure you won't regret buying this.
However, there are identical DVDs/BLU-RAY discs with slightly different names; so make sure that you don't end up with a duplicate :-)",1370822400,20,905,4.87012987012987
5459265,5,B00ANDGYQS,"I love nature documentaries. It allows you to see things in the world you wouldn't otherwise, and done soooo well. David has such an ability to bring things to life. I am a creationist and I don't think he is, but facts are facts and they don't change what you experience. It is all wonderfully fascinating.",1370563200,2,307,4.5
5459266,4,B00ANDGYQS,I'm a loyal fan and very much enjoyed this DVD.  Wish it had been longer and presented even more of his history.  I do recommend it to other fans.,1370390400,,146,4.0
5459267,5,B00ANDGYQS,Exceptional!!!!!! Great look at the changes in the available land and the development of cameras and how he used them!!!,1369008000,,120,5.05
5459268,4,B00ANDGYQS,"This production with David Attenborough is a little different than the rest of his BBC programs.  This is a three-part production:  his Life on Camera, Understanding the Natural World, and Fragile Planet. There is more video of Attenborough the budding naturalist, as he hunts for elusive animals across Africa's plains.  There isn't as much spectacular scenery as there are in other BBC productions, since this DVD also shows older recordings when Attenborough was much younger but no less enthusiastic about wildlife and habitat but when video quality wasn't the best.

Attenborough's passion for wildlife is evident here.  He is fascinated watching tree monkeys or gorillas or mating lions as much as he is feeling a giant beetle crawl up the side of his face.  Gaping mouths of alligators approaching him don't seem to startle him as much as it would a city slicker.  He is clearly comfortable being a part of their habitat, and his often youthful enthusiasm is contagious.

I enjoyed all the footage of birds, and how the slow-motion footage shows the movement of the wings and feathers as a bird hovers over water watching its prey.  I also enjoyed the footage of the young geese learning to follow Attenborough, and learning to fly with his improvisations.  He never tires of these animals and his passion for them is clearly obvious.  This man is a natural.

There is also a message here by Attenborough and his team:  man is destroying natural habitat for many of the animals featured in this production.  Ice caps are melting, jungles are being cut down, rivers and cities are getting polluted.

Most of the video looks like outtakes from previous releases, and the format is brought to the viewer in small flashback to earlier footage of the 1990s or early 2000s.  When he's lecturing he's in his office in front of books, wearing his typical safari or jungle clothes and feeling very comfortable.  He is very animated when he speaks; his presentation demands a viewer's full attention.

There is a lot to be learned in this production and it's worthwhile to view it all.  For those wanting jaw-dropping cinematography you may be disappointed.  For the curious naturalist this will be very pleasing.

A copy was given to be to review in exchange of a review.",1368316800,,2269,4.887434554973822
