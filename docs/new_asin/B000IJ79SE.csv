8145686,5,B000IJ79SE,"this 2 dvd set tells in detail about each plane which includes germany, japan, u.k. and the u.s. and why they were successful in the sky. it gives the height , length, wing span length, the type of engines in them. this set is great for the world war 2 buff or who likes
aircraft. volume  one is also worth getting.",1431907200,,315,4.163934426229508
8145687,1,B000IJ79SE,"I can confirm other reviewers' statements about technical inaccuracies.  Half of the 'Spitfire' footage is actually the Hawker Typhoon, the plane responsible along with the P-47 and several others for restricting axis ground movement to nighttime.  I was cracking up.  Some of the footage was the Hawker Hurricane, some was even the P-40 Tomahawk (Warhawk when in U.S. service).  I guess they thought any fighter plane with British markings was a Spitfire...? I haven't bothered to watch much more.  I can't imagine why on earth a 'documentary' would be so wrong with footage and technical data.  This stuff is all extremely well-known with even basic, amature historians, which makes me wonder who put this together.  Not a historian!
This product should not be sold.  Anything else is better than inaccurate info.",1246060800,3,815,5.1679389312977095
8145688,1,B000IJ79SE,"Calling this pair of DVD's documentaries is misleading & insulting. 2 thirds of each episode has nothing to do with the aircraft being covered. On top of that are the mispronounced names (Vought Aircraft is pronounced like ""ought"", not like the the yiddish word ""ouy""). Many mis-identified film clips are present. In the episode on the Zero there are several instances of clips showing the Nakajima Ki-43 Peregrin Falcon and calling it the Mitsubishi A6M Zero. I swear I actually saw two clips of ground forces in Vietnam, which has nothing to do with these aircraft or World War II. Contrary to the opening statements on each dvd, there appears to have been no attempt whatsoever to improve the video. Improvement in contrast, removing yellowing from aging film, and brightening of the clips are elementary editing tasks once film clips are digitized. But there has been no attempt to do any of this for these videos. Comparing these videos to the Discovery Channel's ""Wings"" documentaries is like comparing the Flintstones with Casablanca. I got these in a clearance bin at $3 for the pair. I feel like I was ripped off. Spending 4 hours watching these is 4 wasted hours that could have been better used doing something productive like chasing dust bunnies.
Don't waste your time or money!",1246060800,2,1291,4.899543378995434
