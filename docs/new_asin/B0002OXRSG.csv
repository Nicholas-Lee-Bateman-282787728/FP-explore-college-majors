2112578,1,B0002OXRSG,"As a Christian I fully realize that American Christian culture could well deserve some biting satire. But this story is way out of balance, more a caricature of this culture. If you think Christians are unhappy, repressed, narrow, hypocritical, unable to deal with reality and, yes, homophobic, then you will like this movie. Those who reject fundamentalist christianity, and embrace drunkeness, adultery and, yes, homosexuality, are shown as happy and best able to deal with reality. If you believe that, you will enjoy this movie.",1086912000,9,532,5.270588235294118
2112579,5,B0002OXRSG,"Saved! is a brilliantly biting satire about students at a strict Chrisitian high school and how they deal with the unwanted pregnancy of one of their prized students. It is brutal, honest, funny, and intense. The cast is simply amazing. Jena Malone, Mandy Moore, Patrick Fugit, and Eva Amurri are all superb and it's great seeing Macaulay Culkin back in more adult roles (also see Party Monster). Mary-Louise Parker is fantastic as well, as always in her supporting roles. This is by far the perfect dream cast for any independent film. I think lots of people will be looking at Mandy Moore differently from now on, whether it be for better or for worse.
As a gay Christian not accepted by his family, I can definitely relate to this film, and honestly say that none of it is exaggeration. All these people exist and they are all people I know. My friends and I really enjoyed the film because it definitely hit close to home and was something we could laugh at and also discuss seriously. Yes, the film is played for laughs, but it is also a very serious topic that really makes you think about society and the ridiculous expectations they have. All the situations in the film ring true with an emotional depth rarely seen in teen films. None of the events will seem off the wall to anyone familiar with modern adolescence or this particular religious subculture. Scary, isn't it?
The film definitely made me think about what this world is coming to and how people so devoted to GOD fail to accept anyone who is a little different. As one of the characters said toward the end, GOD loves us all and that is something people should understand, but choose not to. It's ridiculous and this film explores that well.
Compared to the rest of the film, the ending is a bit weak but it was compensated for by the main message of the film, which is acceptance of people and their differences (and this includes acceptance of Christian Fundamentalists). The film is not a mean-spirited parody; but while it pokes fun at some extreme examples of Christian Fundamentalism, it doesn't make anyone out to be a villain and it doesn't have an anti-Christian message despite what so many people think. People who think that Jews, gays, and unwed mothers need to be saved instead of accepted probably won't enjoy the message of this film, but they just need to deal with it.
I commend everyone involved in the film. It is a movie that needed to be made and I am so glad it was. Many people will hate it, many will oppose it, but everyone should see it, because this is exactly how the world we live in is. Take a chance and see Saved. You might live to enjoy it.",1086912000,,2645,4.535564853556485
2112580,4,B0002OXRSG,"Dogma and The Passion of the Christ were both released to alot of controversial hoopla. How this film sneaked past the cracks I will never know. This was the only trailer I saw placed before The Passion of the Christ. It seemed strange. Was this movie serious? Was it making fun of christianity? And if it was, how did it have the balls to advertise itself to the audience that its making fun of. After finally getting around to watching this movie I find that much like its message, it lies somewhere in the middle of it all.
Jena Malone is Mary. Your typical High School girl who attends a Christian High School and lives in a Christian community. I have seen this world before. It amazed me that someone finally made a film about the queer lifestyle of these kinds of neighborhoods. Everything and anything must be Christian affiliated. From music to clothing it all must have the stamp of JC attached before these folks even lift an eye brow of interest. Jena Malones mother wins a prize for best Christian interior designer. Its a boxed in world. Its a scary world because faith is no longer a personal belief between you and God, its become an obsession that must be flaunted and shown to everyone and everything.
The film covers your basic range of believers. Mandy Moore plays the self righteous Christian who is out to save the world. You aren't a person. You're just a soul that needs her help. And if you aren't saved than its her mission in life to get you to that place. Jena Malone is Mary, not as intense as Mandy, she's a believer, but doesn't push her believes down peoples throats. And god help her, she has her doubts. Macauley Culkin is Richard, Mandy Moores disabled brother. What no one bothers to learn about him is, he's not a believer at all, so he's a closeted unbeliever. Than you have the only Jewish student in the HS, who is of course berated by oh-so-perfect Mandy Moore character, Hillary Faye.
The players here are some of our best young actors doing what they do best. Jena Malone has been in Donnie Darko and The Dangerious Lives of Altar Boys and is pretty much playing the same character here. But she carries this starring role a bit better than in those films where she is more of a supporting character. Mandy Moore finally convinces me that she should quit singing and stick to films. Sure you hate her character, but thats what your supposed to feel. Shes a hypocrite of the worst kind, and Mandy Moore plays it to a T. Macauley Culkin continues to climb his way out of Home-Alone hell and plays it smart by taking on these smaller but more human roles. I look forward to more from him.
The film winks at us with every cliche. You can't help but laugh at a T-Shirt that says JC/DC. This little Christian world is funny, especially since so much of it seems familiar to me. I was sorta caught up in those kind of ppl for a short time in my life, needless to say I kept my faith but left these folks to their own thing. Its a story about tolerance, and it gets a tad bit preachy towards the end. Its a premise we don't see much of in films, and it doesn't make fun of Christians, it makes fun of bigots and hate mongers. This is all greatly represented in a scene where Mandy Moore throws a bible at Jena Malones character. And Jena Replies, ""this is not a weapon.""
Indeed.

2112581,4,B0002OXRSG,"I hadn't seen many ads for this movie going in, but I knew that Mandy Moore, Jena Malone, and Macauly Culkin were in it.  I didn't set my hopes very high, thinking that the film was going to be a bit of a letdown.  I was so wrong!  This is one of the funniest and best movies that I've seen in a very long time.  The story follows Mary (Malone), an oh-so-Christian girl who has never wavered in spirituallity.  She has two best friends, the so-good-she's-bad Hilary Faye (Moore), and Veronica (Elizabeth Thai), a Vietnamese girl who was ""saved"" when she was adopted by an African-American family.  The three of them are part of a group called the Christian Jewels, and they are a Christian Rock band.  Mary also has a boyfriend named Dean (Chad Faust), who is also a perfect Christian... until one day, Mary and Dean are swimming, when Dean tells Mary that he thinks he might be gay.  Mary is so shocked that she bangs her head and starts to drown.  A kid by the pool, who has long brown hair and a beard, jumps in and saves her.  In a delusional state, Mary believes the boy to be Jesus, and he tells her to save Dean.  Mary does everything she can think of short of sex to save her boyfriend from homosexualality.  One day, while talking with Hilary Faye, they get on the subject of intercourse.  Hilary Faye says that, in certain circumstances, like rape, God can restore a person's virginity.  Mary believes that, if she is able to save Dean through sex, her virginity will be restored.  So they do it.  And not only does Dean not become straight, Mary gets pregnant.
Soon, Mary begins to question her faith, and she is thrown out of the Jewels group, only to be replaced by a nerdy wannabe (Heather Matarazzo).  Mary also begins hanging out with Cassandra (Eva Amurri), the only Jewish girl and the only bad girl at the school, and Roland (Culkin), Hilary Faye's handicapped and laid back brother.  The two kids, who are fast developping a relationship, help get her through the pregnancy as best they can.
This movie is about religion gone nuts.  The girls at the school, Hilary Faye in particular, are examples of people who use religion for the wrong reasons.  Hilary Faye believes anyone who isn't Christian is going to Hell, and it is her mission to save them all.  Also, the movie addresses ways of remedying situations.  When Dean is sent to a place called Mercy House to get de-gayified, Mary soon discovers that it is not a place for those who are sent there, it is a place for those who do the sending.
This movie may be offensive to some people.  For example, when we are first introduced to Cassandra, we see her pull into a handicap parking space, she is smoking, there are beer bottles in her car, and right away we learn she is Jewish.  There are bad girls in every religion, and we needed to know why she did the things she did, but it's almost as if the writer assossiated Jews with evil.  Probably not though, because of the film's theme.  Anyway, if you can handle religion bashing, you will love this movie.",1086739200,8,3032,4.467272727272727
2112582,3,B0002OXRSG,"Mary (Jena Malone) has always led an exemplary Christian life, along with her best friends Hilary Faye (Mandy Moore) and Veronica (Elizabeth Thai). They attend American Eagle Christian School, hold constant prayer meetings and even have their very own singing girl group, The Christian Jewels. Everything in Mary's life seems to be right on spiritual track, until one day (while swimming)...her boyfriend Dean (Chad Faust) confesses he thinks he's gay. Mary is so shocked by his confession that she ends up hitting her head and almost drowning in the pool. She has a ""vision"" and believes that Jesus is telling her to do everything necessary to help ""save"" her boyfriend from becoming gay: and she does.
Next thing you know school is starting, Dean is sent to Mercy Home Center to ""recover from his gayness,"" and Mary soon realizes that she is pregnant. Angry at God for letting her down and not protecting her from this when she was only trying to do ""His will,"" Mary begins to rebel at school. Shocked Hilary does everything she can to save ""the poor backsliding Mary"" who is going to ""end up in Hell if she doesn't repent."" Mary's mother Lillian (played by Mary-Louise Parker) seems to be ill-equipped to deal with things like teenage pregnancy, so Mary enlists the help of school rebel & Jewess Cassandra (Eva Amurri) and Hilary's handicapped brother Roland (Macaulay Culkin) to hide her pregnancy from everyone.  Especially Hilary, her mom, and school principal Pastor Skip (Martin Donovan).
Pastor Skip's oh-so-cute son Patrick Wheeler (Patrick Fugit) just returned from the missionary field (where he was living with his mother), seems to have developed a big crush on Mary, but Hilary also has a big crush on him. Roland and Cassandra begin to spend time together, as Roland takes up smoking and begins to find some freedom from his over-bearing sister, Hilary. All this melds together to create a situation filled with drama and tension that must come to a head at some point. But will everything turn out all right in the end, and will Mary find her faith again?
There is some language in this film, including two f-words. Christ and God are mentioned often, but not in swearing: there is one instance where a character says ""Jesus Christ"" when scared and another one says ""G*d damn"" and seems to really mean it, but that is it. There are some ugly phrases and swear words done in graffiti on one scene that the camera pans on for a few seconds. There is smoking, it is inferred people are having sex in their cars, there is a scene where two characters have sex, but you see nothing and just hear a few seconds, and then they show the ""just after"" bit for a few seconds. It is spoken of and inferred that the pastor and a woman are having an affair. There is a few seconds spent during a sex-ed class, with a picture of a naked man and woman (areas ""blurred""). Something is stolen from a local store. There is a short stint where Mary is exploring different religions, and is reading a book and holding a crystal. Much of the content is fairly irreverent.
From her license plate ""JC Girl,"" to her ""gossip filled"" prayer meetings, and Bible-throwing theatrics of ""Jesus's love,"" Hilary seems to epitomize all that can be bad about a Christian girl. She is portrayed as being filled with jealously, ""tough"" love, and scheming, more than with Christ's forgiving love. I didn't walk out of this movie feeling offended, but I should warn you that many of you may.  Much of the content of this films shows atypical Christian activities and functions, from Christian school assemblies to prayer meetings, all with a bit of dramatic flair and with the ""Christianese"" so overdone that it is very over-the-top. I couldn't help but chuckle at some of it (much of it was so true and a bit silly when looked at with an ""outsiders"" perspective), but some could easily take great offense; I think if you are going to be able to watch this film, you have to be very open-minded about the way they ""poke fun"" at the religious community. There is a definite line between making a valid point and ridiculing, and although they often came very close, I never felt like the moviemakers stepped over the line. But some of you may: all this to say, I still don't think this is for ""ye who be faint at heart""; it takes strength and openness to be able to look at yourself the way others may see you and understand where they may be coming from.
The ending leaves some left to be desired, and I found myself wishing for a tiny bit more resolution on some points, including Mary's ""faith"" in God. In the end, I felt the movie painted a pretty realistic picture of life in the ""Christian world"" (as many Christians isolate themselves from the world) and how it is, and it does make some very valid points and even teaches some good life lessons. As one character says ""Why would God make us all so different if He wanted us to be the same?"" They seem to be telling Christians to be more open-minded, more accepting, and the world would be a better place as a whole. And I can't say that I don't agree with them on that. The world would be a much better place with more forgiveness and less grudges, more love and less hate.",1086652800,5,5207,4.603875134553283
2112583,4,B0002OXRSG,"GREAT ART CAUSES YOU TO THINK, AND PRECIPITAES ENORMOUS WEATHER SYSTEMS OF CONTROVERSY.
I was riveted during this entire movie.  For the first fifty minutes of the film, and practically until its end, I had no idea what was going to happen, and whether or not the film was going to be Agnostic or Christian.

  For those of you that enjoy surprises and a battle of your own socio-cultural powers of observation, this film is worth viewing.
  I do not, however, recommend this film to Southern Baptists, or for that matter, any charismatic Christian that takes emotional worship too seriously. (i.e. Pentecostals, Radical Seeker Churches, etc. . .)  Some of you may think this is who this film is for, well, lets just say there is a gentler way ;)
This film is about the idiosyncrasies and more importantly oxymoronic belief systems of fundamentalist and legalist Christianity.  Philo-Theologically I was torn horribly after seeing this film.
  Biblical Hermeneutics and modern exegetical interpretation are right down my alley, ergo I went into the film wary with expectations of blasphemy.
  To be honest, I could not find any subjective cases.  The only reason why I am a mentally jumbled after this film, is a very important quote in its most important section... that for me could be a something to think about, whatever your beliefs:
  An antagonized youth pastor says, ""The Bible is black and white, there is no gray.""
  A (sympathetic) central character replies, ""no it isn't, can't you see, it's all gray.""
  Accepting the westernized chromatic symbolism of white being Good and Black being evil, and transferring this into Christian text being God being White and Satan being black, we have here a conflict.
 What I would like to do is break it down as a man in the throngs of generational philosophy trends knows how.
  At first this was a signifier to me of modern attempts to turn the Christian God into an impersonal all encompassing essence not unlike the Tao.  But as the movie progressed, there seemed to be small acknowledgements to Western Christianity to hold validity.
  C.S. Lewis, an acclaimed Christian thinker and non-fundamentalist, says in ""Mere Christianity,"" that, ""there is no gray in this world, there is only black and white.""
  There is and has been a trend of what is called pluralistic or Unitarian Christianity that has precipitated into a dominant philosophy for my generation.  It is founded on one theory alone: we really, really should not judge.
  In pluralistic Christianity and hermeneutical interpretation there is some confusion being stirred up by such authors as Jean Dominic Crossan, counterpart of the Jesus Seminar whose goal is basically to revisionize who Jesus was, and turn him into a great teacher, but not the son of God.  Agendacized?  Yes.  Intellectually sexy?  Also yes.
  Unfortunately both atheists and Christians have slammed Crossan's work as historically inaccurate.  But a one time through pass is all-most youth needs to provide alibis for behaviors that had previously been thought of as wrong.  I know this because I went through all of this myself.  Crossan is not alone in this crusade.
  This movie deals synonymously with the controversy going on in many denominations (Episcopal, Methodist, Unitarian etc. . . ) that have decided to ordain practicing homosexuals as ministers in the church.
  This, to most bible readers, is considered heresy.  Not because homosexuals are going to hell, or because it is a special, bad sin that is worse than any other . . . but because it endorses the behavior itself, which is taught against in Paul's epistles, which are canonized texts in the New Testament.
  With developments such as these in huge churches with enormous congregations, this movie is dynamite in making a statement about fundamentalism.
  Unfortunately not without a cost.  To  not spoil the film, I will not tell you the cost, or even my own views of the ramifications of its philosophy - - - - but I will say this.

  This film is going to cause generational problems in family religious beliefs.  It is going to cause problems via liberational-based Christian morality.  That is what great art does and I will say it again,
  GREAT ART CAUSES YOU TO THINK, AND PRECIPITAES ENORMOUS WEATHER SYSTEMS OF CONTROVERSY.
  Five stars for execution.
  Four stars for theology.
  Two stars for antagonization (which breeds cyclical judgement problems)
  See it, if you have a sense of humor about life, and are not quick to judgment.  A very important film.",1086566400,6,4530,4.977242302543507
2112584,4,B0002OXRSG,"I normally stay clear of movies which tend to fall within the high school/adolescent genre, I already survived my teens and have no interest in revisiting them, but after reading some promising reviews and publicity of SAVED! I decided to give it a chance and I haven't regretted it. This movie is a different kind of flick that holds an important moral lesson transcending the teenage milieu; it carries a lesson for everyone.
The subjects of this film attend American Eagle Christian High School full of young Born Again Christians who praise the Lord and Jesus Christ at every opportunity. At the center of the crowd is a clique headed by Hillary Faye (Mandy Moore) who is the loudest bible thumper of them all. She is obsessed with saving non-believers destined to spend eternity in hell.
At the beginning of the senior year Hillary is steadfastly alarmed and outraged when several of her classmates and friends are revealed to not follow God's ordained scriptures and who consistently resist their Christian education including such attributes as being Jewish, homosexual, pregnant, and handicapped. It is these students who rise up against the oppressive Christian beliefs of Hillary and her like to claim that God loves and endures the wide diversity of human beings.
Throughout SAVED! there is a tremendous amount of satiric humor aimed at the ridiculousness of the Born Again Christian movement and their follies. While many of the jokes are borderline slapstick there are some clever and memorable lines that made me laugh out loud. The role of the satiric humor enabled the plot and screenplay to lighten up. By watching this movie is becomes so easy to laugh at the characters. Without the humor there would be a much more serious and harsher tone highlighting the viciousness of the conservative Christian faith.
SAVED! is not the run-of-the-mill teenage movie, but this is the reason why it worked for me. It's not a perfect movie but nonetheless worthy of watching.",1086393600,4,1980,5.003030303030303
2112585,3,B0002OXRSG,"I wasn't sure what I was getting myself into when I went to see Saved. I did it on a whim, felt like going to a show and it was the only title I recognized. I'm agnostic, and not easily offended by any real humor directed at religion, but sitting through ninety minuets of secular propaganda is not my idea of fun. I'm glad I gave it a chance.
I didn't find the humor in Saved offensive. Most of it is border-line slapstick. It doesn't attack Christian belief's or fundamental's. It has fun with the religions quirks. Some of the humor in the move is laugh-out-loud. Some is silent-chuckle. Some doesn't work at all. To be honest, the humor in the move would not be enough for me to recommend seeing it. What saves this film (pun intended-forgive me) are the touching moments pulled off by the characters and cast.
The film centers on a sweet, nave, devoutly religious young girl who, in trying do a good and-in her mind-Christian thing for her boyfriend, becomes pregnant. She's played by Jena Malone, who has quickly become one of my favorite young actresses (also fantastic in Donnie Darko). This wouldn't be half the film without her. It's impossible not to sympathize with her and the enormous difficulty of her situation. This makes it also impossible to judge her as she questions (or completely looses) her faith.
She soon finds herself cast out of her social circle and befriended by two other misfits. A boy who has no faith because he's crippled, and a girl who has no faith in Christianity because she's Jewish. Much of the movie deals with them butting heads with the self-righteous queen-bee of the school.
The rest of the cast is also good. The most complex character is probably the pastor. He's a character who shows real caring and affection for his students/ parishioners in some scenes and intolerance and unacceptance in others. There is his great last scene at the end where he is torn between being a nice guy who wants to reach out and be there for the people he cares about, and being a strong moral leader. It's funny and sad at the same time.
There are some moments where the movie crosses the line and seems to try making points about Christianity. One scene near the end where the students gang-up on the pastor and confront him about social intolerance made me feel like they should have been the ones speaking behind a pulpit. But the movie crosses this line only once or twice. Not nearly enough to diminish all the good parts of the film.
If you're a deeply religious person or someone who thinks religion is a subject that shouldn't be treated lightly than this movie probably isn't for you. If your not that person, or even a Christian who's able to take a little nudge-in-the-rib humor about the stereotypes others have about your religion, you might want to see this. You'll probably find it offers more than promised from the previews and critical reviews. I did.",1086220800,2,2901,4.624031007751938

Stellar performance by Macauley Culkin, with very strong performances by Martin Donovan (unshackled from his Hal Hartley roles), Mary-Louise Parker, and several young actors you might never have heard of.

Saved! is also a superb model of how to elegantly integrate existing music into a feature film. My fine screenwriting professor gave us the firm edict, ""You can get away with a maximum one musical montage per film."" And virtually very Hollywood film that breaks that rule falls flat - trying to shoehorn in irrelevant songs by ""name"" artists. Most Hollywood directors/editors can't get even one musical montage right.

This indie includes at least a dozen montages, all set to obscure indie rock music, with no name-checking or pay-to-play. Every montage felt natural, tweaked the pace beautifully, and moved the movie forward. Watch and learn, Directors of Tomorrow!",1453593600,2,1066,5.448484848484848

2112637,5,B0002OXRSG,"Basically the standard teen high school main character dealing with a nasty bully type movie you've seen plenty of times before.  This time it's set in a religious school, which is a unique spin I haven't seen before.  But you don't need to be religious to watch it, as you don't need to be a cheerleader to watch Bring it On, an aspiring actor or singer to watch Glee or Victorious. Saved is a fun teen character movie that deals lightly with some issues kids in all types of high schools may face but isn't trying to be a documentary style answer for those who may be facing those issues, it's just entertainment and is best maybe a breaking the ice talking point for this sort of thing.  Obviously it's not an accurate portrayal of a Christian School, it's more like a school in a brainwashing cult would be, but that's what makes it fun!

I never went to a religious school but I was forced to attend church growing up and there are certainly people with the judgemental views that use references to the bible to further their ideals and put others down to make their own life better, yet when challenged like the main character and 'bad girl' do to those people, in this film those people can never back up what their saying.  So although the characters may be fun  exaggerations on how real life people behave, people like them do exist and should be laughed at and not followed.

All the actors do a good entertaining job in Saved, even Macaulay Culkin who obviously would have been way older than a teen by the time this was made in 2004, but is still passable as one.  Mandy Moore does a fun main mean girl villain, and Jena Malone does a great job as the main character Mary.  Eva Amurri Martino is also brilliant as the girl who has been expelled from other schools and is only attending the religious school as she's sees being homeschooling by her mother as a worse option. Her clashes with the cult like teachings and Mandy Moore's character make the film.",1446508800,,1970,4.45
2112638,4,B0002OXRSG,"'Saved!', a 2004 release, is not what it first appears to be. Despite taking place at a Christian high-school, with a group of devout seniors at its' center, 'Saved!' mocks those who blindly follow some dogma, simply because they're told to do so.

The film opens with Mary's (Jenna Malone) decision to 'save' her bf from homosexual tendencies by allowing him to take her virginity. Catching him in the middle of ogling photos of naked men, his excitement is adequate to perform the task. But finding his stash of magazines, his evangelical parents send him to a 'pray away the gay' facility, leaving Mary bereft.

Mary's group of friends includes queen-bee Hilary Faye (Mandy Moore), who acts as if carting around her wheelchair-bound brother Roland (Macaulay Culkin) is a pleasure. We also meet school-slut Cassandra (Eva Amurri) & new student Patrick (Patrick Fugit) who's the pastor's son.

Patrick is intrigued by Mary, partly due to her complete lack of interest in him. She has bigger problems, you see. Her one-afternoon stand with her bf has left her pregnant. Not 'possibly pregnant' or 'a little bit pregnant', but full on 'oh s***, how did THIS happen?' pregnant. Meanwhile Roland & Cassandra begin a romantic flirtation...

A side-story involves Mary's single-mum (Mary Louise Parker) falling for the very-married Pastor Skip.

All these storylines converge at the school prom, where VERY pregnant Mary is proudly accompanied by Patrick. When she goes into labor during the prom, not only do her friends gather round, her mother drives down, & her gay bf & his new partner are also on hand.

All the actors acquit themselves well, although it seems difficult to believe that a teenage boy would continue to be attracted to a girl bearing another boy's child. Macaulay Culkin is especially notable as Roland.

'Saved!' was directed & co-written by Brian Dannelly. One of its' producers is Michael Stipe. With those type of credentials, a sly poke at religions seems inevitable.

Do buy 'Saved!'. You'll thank me for it!",1442966400,,2031,5.023809523809524

2112641,1,B0002OXRSG,"I wanted to see this movie when it came out, but just ended up seeing it now. It was a huge disappointment. As a 30 year old woman who comes from a conservative Christian family and who was actually home schooled, I find it insulting how they portrayed conservative Christians. Biblical, conservative Christians aren't anything like this movie, at least the ones in my life aren't. They really try to be loving and they don't want to drive people away from Christ at all. I think Christians themselves doubt how they should approach others and even what their own Christianity should look like.  It would be nice if they were trying to convict Christians to be more loving that they would portray them somewhat accurately. I also didn't like how they portray the loving people as the unbelievers. I didn't see one loving Christian in the movie, and the adults were pretty much idiots. They also made it seem like Christians turn off their brain and don't actually think about their faith. Many Christians care about truth and come to Christ because it is true to life for them. They may also have felt the power and love of Jesus in their lives. I don't think they would abandon their faith jut because of a few hiccups in life. Christians are supposed to be evangelical. They aren't supposed to just sit on the side and not care about other peoples souls. Of course, every Christian could act better and more like Christ, but they still make mistakes and sin. Christians generally understand that. I never went to a Christian school, so I don't really know what that environment is like.

This movie is based in a Christian school, and a boy thinks he is gay and a girl become pregnant trying to save him by having sex with him. The understanding kids are of course the non-believers in the school, and the bigots are the Christians. The intellectual climate is very low in the movie. It is understandable to critique Christians, but at least show a loving Christian in the mix. The movie ended up just bashing Christianity. The irreverence and bitterness I felt from the movie was very high and a major turn off. Loving Christians want to help everyone to love Jesus and not sin. They also want to help girls who become pregnant out of wedlock if you go to a crisis pregnancy center. Of course, they also don't want the girls to get abortions because that is taking a life and can cause major heartache in the future for the girls and women who choose that route. It's not about judging. Christians know how hard an unexpected pregnancy is because many have lived through it and learned from the experience. They are just as human as anyone else, and aren't just trying to rain on the parade.",1438819200,6,2694,4.598752598752599

Each actor was perfect for their part. A feel good teen movie where there is a lesson and it was very well portrayed and communicated. This would be a movie to show at one of those holiday assembly's in high school. It talks about people being different and accepting them for their differences. It teaches to welcome and not shut out. To love despite differences. 5 stars because it's worth it.,1428019200,,554,4.4950495049504955

2112720,3,B0002OXRSG,"Inevitably, what dooms this movie is the fact that there's no real second act?  It is like a Saturday Night Live skit [or rather, the 1980s version of Saturday Night Live -- where the writers didn't have a proper ending to a sketch].  Saved!  pores over the shallowness and superficiality within the evangelical subculture -- the film repeatedly makes the same point, ad nauseam.

If I were watching say, Mad TV -- the same contentions, and observations, could've been made in a fraction of the time.  In fact, Nicole Sullivan acted in sketch dealing with similar ideas; about a pseudo-Christian rock band. [That one was at least witty and very entertaining: the hot tub was a baptismal font, if I remember correctly.]

However the repetition found here leaves us with only one single joke over and over and over.  After a while, the film is just not funny: it is repetitive.  And given the fact this is ostensibly a comedy, these reiterations are onerous, and time-consuming: all around the Mulberry Bush...  {Due to the fact that the film is repetitive -- it may well not stand up to repeated viewing.}

Further, there does seem to be a reproachful tone in the film; considering the subject matter, and the theme, this is truly ironic.  I agree with another reviewer, * tvtv3 *, who I quote: The movie could have raised itself about the genre and actually been meaningful, but instead it turns out to be a bigger hypocrite than some of the ones portrayed in the film.",1419206400,,1469,4.69921875

Basically it's the story of someone who took her religion so seriously and has a life changing event that causes her to question what she really  believes.  It uses  a real satirical type of humor that I really appreciated.  The Jewish female student at the Christian high school was by far my favorite character, mostly because she loves pushing peoples buttons just to get a reaction from them.  It has a underlying message of acceptance without being too preachy about it.

The movie was very smart in that while doing this, it still didn't demonize anyone.  Even the ""villian"" played by Mandy Moore deserved some sympathy in the end.

 This is one of those rare instances where satan comes close to breaching the surface and showing himself. And the reason that he's so up close and personal is because he wants your children really really bad. At first glance, it appears to be just another Ferris Bueller style tongue-in-cheek comedy where the kids are all-wise and secretly hip, while their parents are clueless, glassy-eyed buffoons. But don't allow this to fool you. Just beneath the surface is a simmering evil... a blatant and obvious attack against the values of the church. Within the first five minutes alone it assaults the church's stance on illicit teen pregnancy, premarital sex and gayizm.

Initially it seems to be directed at the children. But not even they are the real objective here. The church itself is the main target. Like the enemy who sews thistles in the farmer's wheat, this movie makes a direct attempt to pollute the hearts and minds of the young and impressionable. Especially those who have not yet made their own personal commitment to Christ.

 Yes, satan has been hard at work chipping away at the church every day since the birth of Jesus. But it has never been more obvious than it is now. And in movies like this, it is plain to see a familiar angle of attack: undermine the church from within by sowing seeds of doubt in the children who are already on a Godly path, and from without by slowly strangling it from a lack of new convertees.

 So in closing, I beseech you... stay away from this movie. There is a demon waiting to whisper its deceptive message of Godless secularism in each and every viewing.

2112801,5,B0002OXRSG,"As a non-recruiting Christian myself, I found this film hilarious.  It catches perfectly many of the so-called Christians whom I have known--intolerant, self-absorbed, and extremely judgmental of others.  It also captures very well the confusion and frustrations that come to young people as they grow from being their parents' children to being themselves.  In spite of some of the negative stuff here, I don't see a single anti-Christian sentiment here at all.  Rather, I see a series of strong statements about the unfairness of judging other people and of not loving each other unconditionally--I hear almost all Christians preach unconditional love, but I see few of them practice it.  This film examines the effects of conditional love and baseless condemnation, and it examines them well.

The movie also flows extremely well.  The young cast works very well together, and the direction and editing keep it moving with excellent pacing.  The music's also good, and there are some truly hilarious moments all the way through.  All in all, it's definitely one that I'll see again.",1299369600,,1085,5.189655172413793

Jane Malone, however, was excellent in the movie. She is a very mature teen actress and she has a strong presence on the screen. No offense to Macaulay Culkin but I am not sure why they chose him for movie. He just did not fit in the cast and was lost behind others.

2112804,2,B0002OXRSG,"While this movie does a good job story-wise, featuring a girl in a Christian school who gets pregnant, thus breaking the Biblical teachings of avoiding premarital sex, thus causing a stir of controversy among her classmates and teachers, the ""spoofing"" of this movie against Christians is so clearly bigoted against Christians. Just ONCE I'd like to see a movie featuring Christians for who they really are - real everyday people who struggle yet hold on the hope of a loving and faithful Heavenly Father who has redeemed them through the punishment of His Son, Jesus. NOT a bunch of psycho brain-washed cult followers who clearly need psychological medication. Yes, I'm a Christian myself, and while I clearly understand the desire for rebellion, this movie not only takes it too far, but does an ignorant job of doing so.
The movie is pretty contradictory even in it's attempted spoof, the directors clearly have no clear vision or desire to know who God really is, what Christianity really is, or who Christians really are. They simply are working off of an ignorant bias (most likely off of mass media assumptions), and while they do humor Christians into thinking that their attempts are genuine (by the ending which does CLAIM to accept the existence of ""A god,"" clearly this god has no personality, no care for His people, and no real right to be worshiped or cared for at all. The directors simply would rather preach a politically correct Deism point of view and expect the audience to follow suit, instead of actually challenging people and truly asking them to open their minds to something that might actually help them in life.
This movie simply mocks Christians by pointing at them and saying ""hey look at those people, they think they know everything, don't be like them, but instead just be uncaring ignorant deists like us.""
What most people fail to see is that even WE Christian do not understand God fully, we CANNOT, it is impossible. We struggle just as much as anyone else in this life. We also do not claim to know everything, and even though some MIGHT, that is basically the case with any group, religious or not, right?

While Christian films like 'Fireproof' may not have the star-power of this film or the budget, I would easily recommend it over this one only because at least the Christians in those films are portrayed with genuineness, not cartoons masquerading as reality such as in this film. It would be great if more big budget films portrayed Christians as genuine, but we all know how biased and ignorant they are, yet just like these directors, people will still ignorantly believe what this film says about Christians yet neglect any other thing Hollywood does as fake and superficial.",1289952000,3,2725,4.835117773019272
2112805,1,B0002OXRSG,"The director and writer clearly hate American evangelicals. They're vicious, hateful, hypocrites here, pretty much to the man. They're a melange of what a lifelong secularist imagines Christians are about. If you've ever been or been around evangelicals, Pentecostals, or Catholics, you'll realize that these characters bear little resemblance to any of them. They fume about ""faggotry"", shriek ""fornicators!"" at people, and are just unpleasant. Each is a caricature, really. The ""rebels"", of course, are sensitive, complicated, interesting, warm people, and we're supposed to cheer them as they give the finger, as it were, to the obnoxious Christians. They're living the filmmaker's fantasy, I suppose.

If you're a Christian of any sort, the only thing of interest here is a lesson in the amazingly vicious, and amazingly skewed way that your typical Hollywood type sees evangelicals (again, confused together with Catholics and Pentecostals). Like we're never seen that before.

If you're not a Christian, beware - this movie won't give you a scintilla of insight into your Christian friends and neighbors, but it will encourage you to despise them and feel infinitely morally superior to them. The main point of the movie, of course, is a morality tale: it's OK to be gay, and how dare, how dare anyone not loudly agree with this? Yup - subtle. Here, it's mixed with an off the shelf teen love story to help it go down.

Thus, the movie is either useless or positively harmful. Hence, one star. The directors try hard to offend, but the whole thing is so off target that none of it stings. Not funny, either. It's like watching someone trying to make fun of black people by talking like Buckwheat and eating watermelon.

PS - This isn't sour grapes. I'm not an evangelical, though that's my background. American evangelical culture is ripe, absolutely ripe for parody. These folks don't understand it well enough to parody it, though. It's just a backdrop for the heavyhanded, obvious sermon just mentioned.",1288396800,7,2012,5.087878787878788

The messages are right on - people are complex and not always what they seem to be at first; there is good in everyone; religion can be positive and it can be twisted and used by people sometimes; true friends stick together and watch out for one another; kids have a lot of sense (more than adults give them credit for sometimes); trust your gut but use common sense too.",1282262400,2,660,4.554621848739496
2112807,5,B0002OXRSG,"I found two things interesting about Saved!: one is the movie itself, which is a delightful teen comedy and coming-of-age film, where a group of young people at a private Christian high school are confronted with the difficult and complex world that they will have to navigate as adults. This includes issues of sexuality, responsibility, and morality, as well as the difficulty that always goes along with trying to live the ideals of one's faith in the real world. And here the movie's ""villain"", Hillary Faye, is just as interesting as the ""hero"", Mary. Both have a strong faith in Christ, and both must confront the challenges that their faith is supposed to help them confront. Both learn, in the end, that faith requires sacrifice and tolerance if it is to really do you any good.

This same issue is faced by the adults in the movie, and here is where I really enjoyed the film. Mary's mother Lillian and her principal Pastor Skip are also deeply religious, and each is lonely: she is a widow who wants, understandably, a man's love and, yes, sex, and he is in an unhappy marriage that really ought to be ended. But Pastor Skip in particular is trapped in an Augustinian legalistic faith that allows no compassion and no compromise, and so he projects his unhappiness onto the young people he is supposed to minister. Hillary Faye absorbs this like a sponge, finding herself trapped in the danger of power and harsh judgment that many Christians fall into, again favoring Augustine's dark view of the world over the loving one of Jesus and the gospels, even as both Pastor Skip and Hillary Faye claim to speak for Christ.

It's a familiar theme in American Christian fundamentalism, to use Christ and Christianity not to love your neighbor but to condemn and judge and hurt those who are different, who are already in pain; the scene at the end, when Pastor Skip is pacing back and forth, caught between his desire to bring flowers to a new mother and welcome a new child into the world and his fear which tells him to condemn them both, to cast that first stone, speaks wonders about the conflict so many Christians struggle with today. And yes, these sorts of Christians exist; I've met them and felt their fear.

The second interesting thing about the film is the reaction it has engendered among Christians themselves. Some see the film, correctly in my opinion, as a helpful warning to their own faith, that the example of Hillary Faye and Pastor Skip is one that every person of faith should heed and avoid. Others, however, have responded with fear, and with anger, claiming that the film is an attack on Christianity and that it is a rejection of faith. Yet the Christians in this film are everywhere, and they are good. They are Mary, whose mistake with her gay boyfriend Dean is founded in love (and teen ignorance). They are Dean, who discovers Christ's love even as his own parents send him away because their faith is weak. They are Patrick, who accepts Mary despite her foolishness, and they are Roland, who despite his claim that he isn't a Christian acts very much like the best of Christian kindness and charity, and they are even Cassandra, who like Jesus himself is a Jew and a rebel. Because they all, like real Christians and real Jews (and real Muslims and Hindus and Buddhists... the list goes on), know that Christianity isn't about judging people but about loving them, about forgiving and practicing kindness every day, about reaching out to those who are lost, who suffer, and who are afraid.

People who most need it, like Hillary Faye and Pastor Skip. And that is the real beauty of this film, because they do.",1276732800,,3646,4.683307332293292

2112818,5,B0002OXRSG,"""Saved!"" is a mostly (and unfortunately) overlooked little film that deftly tackles the subject of religion, and the confusion and hypocrisy surrounding it.  Written by none other than REM frontman Michael Stipe, it manages to be a tasteful satire that makes you laugh as much as it makes you think.

The story is centered around a girl named Mary, played by Jena Malone (who by the way is awesome because she's in not one, not two, but three of my favorite movies from the past few years: ""Donnie Darko"", ""Into the Wild"", and this one right here).  Mary is a straight-laced teenage girl who is devoutly religious, and a top student at a christian school.  She has a picture-perfect life, and a boyfriend she's madly in love with.  That is, until her boyfriend confesses to her that he is gay.  Now, since christianity doesn't take so kindly to the homosexual persuasion, Mary decides that she must try to ""convert"" him in order to save their relationship and his soul.  And how does she do this?  By having sex with him.  This of course does not work, and not only is the boyfriend still gay, but she is now pregnant.  And of course, christianity doesn't take too kindly to teen pregnancy or premarital sex either.

This causes Mary to be shunned by her peers, leading her to question her faith, and everything she's always believed in.  She's confused, because she's gotten into this mess because she thought it was what God wanted her to do, and in the end it only made things worse.  This leads her on a path of attempting to reconcile her faith with certain aspects of her religion that no longer make sense to her.

This all could potentially be a very dark and depressing film, but Stipe tackles the issues in a very light-hearted but still thought-provoking way.  The uproar that is caused by all of these events seems so silly, but at the same time it's the kind of thing that really happens all over the country.  Malone is excellent as a character who is so obviously naive, but at the same time is well-intentioned and introspective.  She learns important lessons from all of this, and hopefully the viewer does as well.  I am a non-religious person, but at the same time I'm not anti-religious either, so I really liked that Stipe chose to take a similar standpoint in making this.  It is highly critical of organized religion, and the things within it that frankly just make no sense to me, but at the same time it doesn't completely condemn religion either. It shows that you can still maintain your faith or whatever without necessarily becoming a mindless slave to it, which is why I think that no matter what kind of views you have on religion, you can identify with the movie's message without feeling like you're being told to take one side or the other.

And of course there's tons of great performances here, like Mandy Moore as the hilariously over-the-top religious zealot Hilary Faye, and Macaulay Culkin as her wise-cracking younger brother.  Patrick Fugit excellently reprises his prototypical nice-guy role in ""Almost Famous"" as Mary's new potential love interest, and Eva Amurri (the lovely and talented daughter of Susan Sarandon) stands out as perhaps my favorite character of the film, the rebellious and acid-tongued Cassandra, who as the lone jew in an all-christian school is an unabashed outcast who isn't afraid to tell anyone exactly what she thinks.  Her character is especially interesting, because she's initially looked down upon by the whole school (Mary included), but after word gets out about what's happened to Mary, Cassandra is the only one who's really there for her, which is an important part of Mary changing her perspective on everything.

Anyway, this is just a fun, intelligent, extremely well-written film that I highly recommend.  Michael Stipe has proven to be every bit as good of a screenwriter as he is a songwriter, and I for one really hope he continues to write more great stuff like this.",1211587200,,3954,4.763929618768328

It has found fertile ground especially in the South and West, but really everywhere there's a group of folks that want to worship Jesus. There's nothing like it in Europe and other continents. It must thrive in a place of respected Religious Freedom.

I have observed first hand the parishioners and churches in my locality.  For the most part, the service relates the travails of Jesus, his life and times, and the universal message, redemption from sin, original or less consequential by acceptance of Jesus Christ as Savior. Our little Jesus High School gives the otherwise noncommittal an opportunity to check out those funny nut cases and their rabid Mandy Moore church dictator and her zombie friends.

The slightly wishy-washy ending doesn't overly dampen the message that the Bible isn't much of a moral guide.  Best of all, it's very funny.",1193702400,2,402,4.569444444444445
2112826,5,B0002OXRSG,"Oh, how I love this movie.  It's become one of my all-time favorites.  I won't go into detail since many wonderful people have done it already, but I just had to put in my two cents after reading some other reviews.
I know of a man who's just like Pastor Skip.  I have family members who are like Hilary Faye.  There ARE people out there that act JUST LIKE THEM!  Yes, it is just a movie, but these writers really hit the nail on the head when it came to the characters. I was amazed.  One of the lines toward the end of the movie absolutely sold me for life: ""Why would God make us all so different... if he wanted us to be the same?""  The answer to that, I'm sure, is priceless.
Keep an open mind to the movie.  It is NOT anti-christian. If's its done anything for me, its respect the religion of Christianity a little more. It simply points out how narrow-minded some (not all) Christians can be. This movie will be with me forever.  If you haven't see it, then GO SEE IT!",1190505600,,975,4.1436170212765955

But I'm not religious. You will love this movie if you are an Atheist, Jewish, or Christian (those are the ones touched on). You will just love it no matter what your religion is.

In the end it gets preachy.  But that's okay with me.  It's preaching the true message of Jesus, the one you seldom hear today.  It's the message of tolerance that early Christians must have put forth, before the Romans highjacked Christianity as a useful tool for controlling their empire.

What a shame more churches today don't preach the message that this little teenage comedy attempts to share.

2112830,2,B0002OXRSG,"Like other reviewers, I also attended a Baptist, evangelical Christian academy from kindergarten through 12th grade. My experience was nothing like that portrayed in this movie, which pushes its polemic with exaggerated characters who exhibit every stereotype of evangelicals that one can imagine. Of course, there are certainly hypocrites in such schools and churches, as every Christian can attest, but exceptions do not make the rule nor justify the message this movie intends to make.

The story involves a girl who gets pregnant because she had sex with her boyfriend (with same-sex attraction) to make him straight. Her reason: Jesus told her to do it in order to help him. The boy is cast aside by his parents, and the girl, for fear of the same, hides her pregnancy from her classmates and mom (who, by the way, is having an affair with the pastor). The girl's close friend, Mandy Moore's character, is the quintessential evangelical stereotype -- self-righteous, condemnatory, fanatical, etc. The ""bad girl"" at the school and a handicap boy are the only ones who reach out to the pregnant girl (as does, eventually, the pastor's son, but only after essentially losing his faith). By the end of the movie, all the characters have lost their evangelical faith and embraced a warm, fuzzy sort of universalism/unitarianism where God affirms all of our diversity. Of course, there is some good in that (aside from the issue of homosexuality, which is more than a simple matter of either being born that way or choosing it) insofar as we are all broken and have no right to condemn others as if we are righteous before God on our own merit. Evangelicals do immense work in reaching out to pregnant teenagers (e.g., Jerry Falwell's crisis pregnancy center and maternity house), in addition to numerous other ministries (whether it be to the third world poor or the prisons of America). As well, ""conservatives"" have been found to give more and do more charitable work than ""liberals"" (see the book, 'Who Really Cares,' by Arthur Brooks). Of course, that would not be the impression gained from this movie. I appreciate the movie's intent to criticize blatant hypocrisy, but the full-scale attack on traditional Christianity is unfounded and only serves to foster stereotypes.",1181779200,8,2277,5.023809523809524
2112831,1,B0002OXRSG,"I saw the film and was not impressed. I attended a Christian School and have spoken at a few. If the writers, actors etc; took the time to ""attend"" Church, atleast to do research, they would realize that the language and actions by the main characters are completely exaggerated, unreal and over-the-top. It's hard to believe that a writer for this drivel attended a Christian School for any period of time - maybe he just peeked his head in one afternoon...impressive!

Anyone who says this is NOT a rip on Christianity must be on Crack. The scene where the Pastor is reading the Christmas Story and the main character is thinking to herself that perhaps Mary was not a Virgin meaning she lied about it. C'mon folks. The Virgin Birth is a basic, central belief of Christianity...this is a duh. > Biblical/historical retardation knows no bounds, the proof is the over 250 people that have reviewed this film and liked it.

Perhaps the saddest epilogue to this travesty is the promotion of the Mandy Moore film ""A Walk to Remember"" by Salem Christian Radio stations around the U.S. during the 2001/2002 film season. Then the slimeball (Moore) turns around and does this. What a Jerk!",1181433600,7,1182,4.760975609756097
2112832,3,B0002OXRSG,"Saved! is a delightful liberal morality tale of good guys who win gleaming vindication and a bad girl who ends in obliteration more satisfying than death.  Saved! satirizes the usual litany of religious right hypocrisies: aping popular culture, villifying sexual sins while flirting with them, permissive materialism, ignorance imposed upon the young, leaders' unaccountability, etc.  But it does so unusually well, with brilliant moments, ""Please let it be cancer!"" being a favorite.  The texture of suburban insular religiosity is closely observed, delivering a precise and bitingly funny portrait.

With so much to savor, it gives me some pain to award only three stars.  But the characters are generally one-dimensional, the conclusions foregone, and the philosophy mired in false dichotomies.  The archetypal cast includes the all-knowing  ""bad""  girl with a good heart, the all-forgiving Jesus figure (Patrick), the purring-hissing villainess (Hillary Faye) , the innocent victim (Dean), etc.  The main character (Mary) escapes this lot, generally receiving multi-dimensionality, if not always the ring of truth.  The principal (Pastor Skip), while weak, unintelligent, and obtuse, is really interesting, and the only character to audibly struggle over the issues (if ineffectively).

Saved! demonstrates the divisive impact of moral convictions, and presents a glowing portrait of an ""it's all ambiguous""-based morality:  the only ""sin"" which bears consequences is that of hypocrisy.  We never the see the adulterous principal's wife.  Main character gets pregnant and dream boyfriend says, ""It doesn't matter to me"" (hard to swallow).  Even parking in the handicapped space doesn't hurt anyone.  In a vaccum of consequences, it's easy to see how ""it's all ambiguous"" folks get on just fine.

According to Saved!, either you agree that it's all ambiguous, or you're a pharisee out stoning people.  Referring to the woman caught in adultery in John 8:1-11, W. Meredith Long writes in his recent book ""The AIDS Crisis"": ""Jesus confounded the Pharisees by choosing both grace and holiness.  He rejected their unstated but deeply held conviction that the two choices are mutually exclusive.""  Jesus chooses both moral convictions and inclusion by refusing to condemn but also asking for repentence.  This is the synthesis that we need to bring harmony to our Western battles between right and left.

Yeah, well, maybe someday, but for now, if you enjoy watching culture-war pit-fights as much as I do, Saved! is a delicious flick.",1176076800,,2533,5.474226804123711
2112833,5,B0002OXRSG,This is a really good movie. All of the Characters fit their parts great. Jena Malone plays Mary a confussed teenager. She is trying her hardest to be Christian the right way. But takes a wrong turn when trying to help her boyfriend. And it turns her relationship with her best friend Hilary Faye upside down. Mandy Moore character Hilary Faye is what I would call a poser. She tries her hardest to get everyone to like her and think she is the best Christian. Mary and Hilary Faye both have a thing for Patrick (Patrick Fugit) and this makes things worse between them. Hilary Faye's paralyzed brother Roland played by Macaulay Culkin knows the true about  Hilary Faye and decides to helps his girlfriend Cassandra the wild child of the school played by Eva Amurri and Mary bring out the truth in Hilary Faye.

2112836,5,B0002OXRSG,"For some of us who didn't fit into the ""Good Christian Norm"" this movie tells our story. I grew up in a very strict religious home, yet I didn't want to wear a tie and go to meetings, knock on doors early Saturday mornings, go to bible study or fake an interest in hanging out with a bunch of boring people who always tried to look like they were the ""in"" crowd or hang out with the good kids who had more serious problems then us problem kids.

Anyway this movie tells the story from our end, some of us didn't try to fit the mold, some of us were just too different to try to fit in, and some of us saw the whole scam for what it really is. OK my review is not an attack on Christianity or Christians so don't quote a bunch of scriptures at me, just telling it like it is.

This is just a really great movie, my favorite lines from the movie are (don't know if I quote them right but goes something like this)  ""this is not a weapon"" (after Mandy Moore throws the bible at Jena Malone) and ""if god wanted all of us to be the same then why did he make us so different""

2112838,5,B0002OXRSG,"When this movie came out, I was a senior in high school. I had long since given up on religion as a result of my experiences in youth groups, and went to see the film because I expected it to be the Protestant Dogma. It was...but it was also so much more.

I highly recommend this movie to anyone who may actually be skeptical of how truthful the film is, or to anyone who has encountered this opinion of religion from a friend or family member. This movie sparked some controversy among Christians, as it should, because it represents an extremist side of the religion that many never see and don't believe actually exists. I know that once my own parents saw the film, they were surprised to find that I wasn't the only person who felt this way about my own religion.

A lot of criticism of the movie centers sround the idea that they did not do enough to counteract the hypocrisy or that they did not actually offer a good resolution to the problem. The fact is, I thought that the ending promoted the idea of ""co-existing"" perfectly.

All in all, yes, it's a controversial idea - especially in the Bible belt - but I think that everyone, no matter what side of the religious spectrum you're on, would benefit from viewing this hillarious movie with a great message for an ending.",1170720000,5,1283,4.451063829787234
2112839,2,B0002OXRSG,"I give Saved! two stars for attempting to confront a complicated subject matter (hypocrisy among Christians).  However, this is far from being a fair assessment of Christianity as a whole.  I like the characters portrayed by Mandy Moore and Jena Malone - I think they are legitimate satirical representations of real Christian teens, however exaggerated they may be.  But I am very disappointed that no one offers any wisdom, hope, or guidance for these confused teens (not even the pastor, whose cheesiness and timidity rivals the likes of Ned Flanders).

The story never really goes anywhere.  The message seems to be something like this: ""There is no way of knowing right from wrong since most of life is a gray area.  Therefore, we should do whatever feels right.""  The Bible is hardly, if ever, referred to as a reference for moral judgments.  This film goes beyond satirical comedy to accuse Christianity of being all about show and appearance, not unlike a beauty pageant.

Sadly, this film is probably a fairly accurate depiction of the way much of the world views Christians.  It should be a message to any believer in Christ - not to judge others because no one is without sin.  As Jesus says, ""Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother's eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye?"" (Matthew 7:3)",1170633600,,1332,4.7229437229437226

Ah, such bittersweet memories I have left behind...thankfully! I certainly would not call this movie an endorsement of Christianity, but that is the beauty of it.

2112841,2,B0002OXRSG,"I really didn't enjoy the movie, but  I had to finish it.  The hypocrisy of Faith and her sidekicks mirrored so many of the so-called fundamentalist that I know, but the ignorance and hopelessness of the others were terrifying.

This movie presented a very perverted view of Christianity.  Though there was alot of talking about Jesus and saying His name, it was clear that no one in the entire movie actually KNEW HIM and spent time with Him.  When Mary gets a revelation from something she believes is Christ that opposed the actual Word of God, she finds someone who is crazier than the average nut to confirm her decision.  Christ does not tell anyone to do things that goes against His Word.  No one actually reads a Bible in the movie.  Consequently, most made many life-damaging decisions.

I hated the ""reality"" of the movie, but it has challenged me to actually spend time with Christ and learn about Him. I shudder to think that I could live long enough to present such a twisted veiw of what Christianity truly is.",1163635200,5,1025,4.6187845303867405
2112842,3,B0002OXRSG,"When saved was released in theatres, I had several acquaintances and friends tell me that it was a really good movie. I was told that it dealt honestly with faith and that I should see it because ""it's also a Christian movie."" I was a bit surprised by some of these words of praise because they came from people who were mainly atheists and agnostics. I wasn't able to see the movie when it was in theatres and forgot about the film until I happened to see it while browsing at a local video store. I was in a reflective mood and wanted to watch something at least slightly philosophical and I thought SAVED! would be a good choice.

The movie revolves around Mary (Jena Malone). Mary is going to be a high school senior at American Eagle Christian High School (notice the name of the school--it's supposed to be a joke). Mary's dating a really cute guy named Dean (Chad Faust). Despite their upbringing, Dean's pressured Mary to have sex, but Mary wants to preserve her virginity until she's married and she's resisted. Then Dean starts to exhibit some homosexual tendencies and reveals to Mary that he thinks he's gay. Mary is upset and prays about what is happening. In what she believes is an answer to her prayer, she believes she sees Jesus in a swimming pool and takes that as a sign that she's supposed to have sex with Dean to save him from turning gay. Dean's parents find gay pornography in Dean's room and ship him off to a place that supposedly specializes in ""degayification.""

This opening set up is just the beginning of the movie, but it says a great deal about what the movie is really about. Mary's ""revelation"" is supposed to be funny. It's also supposed to be ironic that Mary, a goody-two-shoe who is known for promoting abstinence becomes pregnant the first time she has sex with a man who has given in to his homosexual tendencies. It's all supposed to be fun and in good humor. But that's where the filmmakers fail. There isn't anything funny at all about Mary's vision--God never asks a person to commit a sin in his name; God will not ask someone to do something that is against his nature. As for Mary's pregnancy, it becomes the central plot device through the rest of the film, but really isn't ironic (partially because of biology) and is more sad than anything else. From the opening scenes it becomes clear that though the filmmakers pretended to make a satirical drama about Christian fundamentalism, they failed to do so because they show very little knowledge about Christian faith and how things operate at a Christian school.

As for the rest of the movie's plot, Mary returns to school and her close knit group of friends, including the school's favorite daughter, Hilary Faye (Mandy Moore). At first things seem normal, but as Mary begins to deal with the very real issue of having a baby inside of her, it seems to her that Hilary and all of her old brigade are a bunch of pious fakes and hypocrites. Mary starts hanging out with a new crowd that includes the school's only ""Jewish"" student, Cassandra (Eva Amurri)--which is another inaccuracy by the filmmakers because Cassandra is Jewish in name only; Hilary's handicapped younger brother Roland (Macaulay Culkin); and the new principal's skater son, Patrick (Patrick Fugit). Mary's old friends initially want to bring her back into the fold and even attempt to kidnap her to exercise whatever demons are within her. Of course, after that the once-best friends become arch rivals and Mary becomes just another outcast. Mary doesn't even feel comfortable talking to her mother (Mary-Louise Parker) because she is involved in a ""secret"" relationship with Mary's principal, Pastor Skip (Martin Donovan). One thing follows another until the climax at the school's prom.

Since seeing this film I have read many other comments and reviews about it and there are many who believe it is an anti-Christian movie. In fact, according to director Brian Dannelly, several Christians working on the film quit and during the production after realizing the full extent of the movie, a church, a Christian rock band, and the homeowner whose house was to be used for important scenes pulled out of productions because of objections over the movie's unflattering content. I can understand why people would be offended by the film and can see why they think it is anti-Christian.

Personally, I do not believe that. However, it is quite apparent that the filmmakers didn't know the first thing about real Christianity. I think the writers either took every incident they have ever heard about (no matter how remotely) evangelical Christians doing crazy (and usually stupid) things and set them in a Christian high school so they could make a formula teen drama movie that preaches a message they like to hear, one about tolerance. [...]

That's not to say that SAVED! is a terrible movie because it's not. It is a typical teen drama, but it offers some extraordinary acting. Jena Malone, Mandy Moore, Patrick Fugit, and the rest of the cast give some superb performances. They bring humanity and life to what could have been just cardboard characters. Especially impressive is Macaulay Culkin; anyone who has any doubts talent as an actor should watch this film to erase those doubts. The movie, though formulaic, is well-paced and only looses steam at the conclusion.

Overall SAVED! is basically another teen drama, but one that desperately wants people to discuss issues the movie raises. I don't fault the movie for that, but I do fault the film for the way it presents certain issues. The movie could have raised itself about the genre and actually been meaningful, but instead it turns out to be a bigger hypocrite than some of the ones portrayed in the film.",1158710400,2,5739,4.790909090909091
2112843,5,B0002OXRSG,"This flick has so much going for it that it is hard to know where to start. But first, I want to disagree with the reviewer who believes that satire is meant to be funny and not taken seriously. Just the opposite. Satire uses humor to address deadly serious subjects. It is difficult to do well, as it needs to achieve a precarious balance between being too biting and being too gentle.  This movie achieves that balance, and is the main reason why it is so delicious!

We have been fortunate that two excellent satires have been made recently, ""Thank You for Smoking"" and ""Little Miss Sunshine"". The former satirizes the death merchants who sell cigarettes (the main character is likable, although his job is detestable), and the latter takes pot shots at the self-motivational industry and child beauty pageants. There is also a satire of an ""American Idol""-like TV show, which also stars Mandy Moore, which is pretty good (I forget the name).

I will not summarize the movie here. Suffice it to say that ""Saved"" has an excellent script--funny, warm, and wise. The characters are well-developed and believable.  The acting is superb, from everyone, nothing over the top (inappropriate in a satire).  Moore's Hillary Fay is played as a devout Born Again Christian whose religious zeal has made her lose some of her basic humanity.  Jena Malone's Mary is a sweet religious girl who gets woken up by a jolt of reality and ends up confused about what to believe. Mary's mother is delightful, and has some of the  film's best lines.

Some reviewers have said that this is an anti-Christian film.  It is not.  It is a plea for tolerance and understanding from certain religious fundamentalists who see the world in terms of black and white, good or bad.  As the preacher's son notes, ""No Dad, the world is gray.""  We all can learn from this film.",1157241600,20,1842,4.721875

2112845,4,B0002OXRSG,"Saved is a funny movie about a girl - who is dealing with her boyfriend - who has announced he is gay... Then how she figures she can ""fix"" him and the consequences of her failed attempt to do so...

Those who have been brought up believing in a christian/catholic/mormon/protestant faith and are having doubts - or have become athiest or agnostic or just plain free from the fanaticism and oppression of religion - would probably get a kick out of this movie.

Jena Malone is a very beautiful and talented actress who is proving herself in every role she plays. In Saved, she is the pivotal character who is trying to find her place in the religious atmosphere she lives in. The Rules tell her she is evil, yet she knows she is doing good things. With oppression and an attempted exorcism by her friends, who think she has become possessed by the devil just because she has started keeping to herself, she has a lot to deal with here and does a great job...

Mandy Moore plays - you guessed it - the goody two shoes preppy witch with a B. And of course, she also conveniently has a scene where she belts out a christian song on stage. But after all her character's fanaticism and prejudice, justice falls flat in her face and she gets what she deserves.

The movie is not just a christian movie. It deals with real life, religious fanaticism, and how people can come to terms with their own flaws and be fine with them. The feeling one gets when Mandy Moore's character throws a bible at Jena Malone's character screaming ""I am filled with christ's love!"" is how many of us feel when a religious fanatic tries to scare us into conversion. And, like Jena Malone's character, we are upset and somewhat confounded that these fanatics are so blinded by their faith that they just cannot accept that some people are different.

McCauley Culkin is suave and quirky as the wheel-chair bound kid who falls for the ""evil girl"" who apparently is a jewish - turned catholic - teen who rebels under peer pressure, yet has a warm heart for those in need.

It's funny, deals with the consequences of actions, and has amazing performances by much of the primary cast.",1154908800,7,2153,4.5218508997429305

Now I'm sure that a lot of born again Christians might not find this movie redeemable in any way because afterall, it is poking fun at the Christian faith, epecially the ""born agains"" and the ""fundamentalists"". But even before the movie came out, I found that group of people to be particularly entertaining, anyway.

There is a great line in this movie when the Mandy Moore (Hilary) character throws a Bible at the Jena Malone character (Mary) and Mary says to her, ""This isn't a weapon...""

Wow. Wow oh wow oh wow...the Bible isn't a weapon and yet sooo many ""good"" Christians use it that way. They're all about being loving BUT they'll only love you if you believe EXACTLY like they do. They're all about forgiveness and compassion, but only after you grovel and beg for it. Now, I'm sure there are a lot of really wonderful Christians out there and if you're one of them drop me an email at.....what...did you honestly think I was gonna tell you? Yeah, sorry, guys but I did the ""saved"" things years ago...somehow I couldn't swallow it hook, line, and sinker.

Don't get me wrong. I love Jesus. I love his teachings. I think his teachings could totally transform the world. I just don't think it was his intention to be worshipped. Now, I could be wrong but if Jesus was truly ""God"" why would he get upset with that person when he said, ""There is none good, but God alone."" Why wouldn't he have said, ""There is none good but me!""

Jesus was Divine...but so are you...so am I...we don't need a religion to follow to be worthy. Afterall, God created us in ""His"" Image and Likeness. We are not human beings who are having a spiritual experience; we are spiritual beings having a human experience. This is  a very spiritual movie. Its message  that everyone of us is redeemable is very powerful. That all ""sin"" is a mistake and we can always go to God for everything we could ever want or need no matter what because the divine has never ever once refused us. No matter if we're gay, or belong to another religion, or even if we don't belong to any religion. God is with us now and forever.

So, rent this movie or better yet, buy it. If you are a fundamentalist and it ruffles your feathers, good! Maybe you need to question your beliefs. Maybe you need to just follow the two commandments of Jesus (1) Love God with all your mind, heart and soul and (2) Love your neighbor as yourself because your neighbor is an expresion of God no matter what he/she may appear to be.

Mandy Moore does a great job playing a legalistic, ""church-lady"" type named Hilary,  who goes beyond ""witnessing"" in her attempts at converting others by using crisis intervention tactics--like blocking the hallways with her and her friends, or attempting to kidnap the subject and throwing him/her into their van for treatment.  For Hilary, Christianity is all about behavior modification.  She lacks heart winds up with bitterness.  Her only hope at the end comes from her wheelchair bound brother, a nonbeliever, who offers to help her with her problems.  One can only assume that rather than correcting her misperceptions of Jesus, he will instead try to deprogram her of her faith.

Hilary's nemesis, who she constantly tries to convert, is Cassandra, played by Eva Amurri.  Cassandra, a Jewish girl determined not to convert, brings to mind Matthew 13:19.  She has heard the Word and ""understandeth it not"" as a person who received the ""seed"" by the wayside.  She becomes a hero in the end for having a big heart, though she still chooses the earthly path rather than the spiritual one, thinking she only needs to rely on herself.

Mary, played wonderfully by Jena Malone for her innocence, seems to turn against God a bit too easily when in trouble (see Matthew 13:21).  Blaming God when it was she who forgot to bring protection along seems very shortsighted for a girl with such strong willed faith.  But many young Christians do feel persecuted when they don't get what they pray for, a sign of spiritual immaturity.

The problem with this movie is that no one has spiritual maturity, including the writers of the screenplay.  Even the most sinful pastor will answer ""YES"" when asked by a young gay teenager, banned from prom night, if Jesus still loves him.  This one doesn't know what to say.  There are no answers given to the audience of this film, most of whom are young people looking for answers.  So I will give a short one here.

Saint Augustine said something that at first sounds irresponsible when not fully understood.  He said ""Love God, and then do as you please.""  What he meant is that when we really love Jesus intensely for who He is and what he sacrificed for us, our hearts will change.  Sinful behavior we used to commit no longer has the same appeal to us as before.  Being obedient to God brings us pleasure when we have true love and devotion to Christ.  We are still sinners but no longer by desire--not perfect but forgiven.  Would it have been so difficult to include just one character at a Christian school who mentions this?  The difficulty lies in finding screenwriters in Hollywood who have a clue about it.  Don't get me wrong.  All of the characters in this movie were essential!  But they forgot the most essential of all.",1149292800,12,3026,4.719465648854962

It has the usual tropes of teen movies- inept hypocritical parents, teens spouting all of the wisdom of the movie, pranks and prom.  The movie was slow paced and I was predicting lines of dialogue upon the first viewing before the actors got there.  In the end, the Big Message of the movie seemed to be ""I'm okay, you're okay.""

2112850,4,B0002OXRSG,"As a note, ""jesus-centric"" is a word created by the writers of this film which is used by Mandy Moore as a descriptor of a favorite christian rock group - not my creation.  Although I agree with many of the reviews of this film which critique the ""easy-way-out"" ending involving a prom, a birth, a coming out, and a car crash all at once, I think that the rest of the film is so well done and intelligent that the ending can be forgiven.  If you'll excuse the pun.  The film follows a motley crew of high school misfits through their final year at a christian academy. The film focuses mainly on Jenna Malone's character who becomes pregnant after offering up her virginity in an effort to prevent her boyfriend from his ""spiritually toxic"" homosexuality.  Jenna plays this role flawlessly portraying the denial, anger, rejection, acceptance, and devastation of losing one's illusions regarding religion or anything else.  Mandy Moore does a surprisingly good job of playing the righteous but misguided leader of Jenna's circle - the Christian Jewels.  Satellite characters include the hillarious school principal who does punch front flips onto a stage to pray at school assemblies and a quirky blonde who takes Jenna's place as a part of the Christian Jewels after her fall from grace.

2112851,4,B0002OXRSG,"I attended a small Christian high school and can relate to the message that is trying to be delivered through this film.  The truth is that ultra-conservative fundamentalist Christianity is hypocritical and unkind.  These people are so concerned with avoiding any and everything that has been or ever will be construed as sinful and in the process have ruined so many lives.  It is horrible that people view all Christians as stupid, anti-semetic, narrow-minded, and angry; we aren't all like this, and I believe this film (while it doesn't do much to support my cause) gives us a pretty good look at the pharasaical nature of certain Christian ""sects.""

Religian aside, the film was everything that a film of its genre should be.  Dark, sarcastic, and hilarious--Saved was everything I hoped it would be from a strictly entertainment standpoint.

I recommend this highly for those whom it mocks.  The reason for the docked star is the ending.  Some of the social opinions that are implied seemed somewhat uncalled for, and I believe the film could have prosepered in their absence.",1144454400,12,1082,4.972222222222222

2112854,5,B0002OXRSG,"Set in a not-extremely-conservative Christian fundamentalist high school (witness the amusingly-hip ""Pastor Skip""!) this movie is an excellent satire of modern Christian fundamentalism, especially the glaring hypocrisy, and the self-serving and phony hyper-righteousness of some of it's adherents.  The plot unfolding from a crisis of faith that one young woman at the school experiences after her Christian boyfriend admits to her (underwater, no less!) that he's Gay, this movie is very well-produced, filmed, scripted and acted, featuring actors such as (forgive the vague identification of some here!):  Susan Sarandon's daughter;  MacCaulay Culkin;  the young woman who played Donnie Darko's girlfriend;  Mandy Moore;  one of the Arquette sisters;  George Wendt;  Adam Arkin;  and a guy who looks like a friend of my sister Kathy's from high school.

  Funny, realistic, poignant, meaningful, politically charged, sexy and romantic all together, it does not demean Christianity in general (though I'm sure that some people would find it quite blasphemous) but simply points out that life is too complicated to be easily dealt with by an overly simplistic and blindered world view as is -- to be fair -- practiced by not only Christian fundamentalists, but also by Islamic, and Jewish fundamentalists as well.  As one of the characters asks:  ""If God wanted us to all be the same, then why did he make us all so different?!""  I highly recommend it!!

2112855,5,B0002OXRSG,"Rising from the ashes to become so much more than just another teen comedy, `Saved' proves itself to be one of the most well written and genuinely funny religious satires I've ever seen.  Exposing religion for all the hypocrisy, this film may step on quite a few toes, but it's all in good fun and whether you want to agree or not, it's hard not to see the point.

When Mary (Jena Malone) hears that her boyfriend Dean (Chad Faust) is gay she's devastated.  So devastated that she hallucinates Jesus has told her to `un-gay' her boyfriend.  So she does this by forsaking her faith and sleeping with him, trying to force him straight.  This only results in bad things for her boyfriend is still caught looking at gay porn and is sent to a rehab center and Mary is left pregnant and frightened for no one even knows she had sex.

Her best friend, Hilary Faye (Mandy Moore), proves herself to be less and friend and more a self-promoter as she uses Mary's situation to criticize and humiliate her.  And then the new kid moves in, the new pastor's son Patrick (Patrick Fugit).  Both Mary and Hilary like him, but it's apparent that he is after Mary, who while she likes him is keeping her distance for she doesn't want anyone to know of her pregnancy.

As Mary becomes more and more disgusted with her faith, mostly after realizing that the very `married' Pastor Skip (Martin Donovan) is dating her mother Lillian (Mary-Louise Parker), she starts exploring other beliefs only to find that nothing is working, but when a small group of kids find out she's pregnant and accept her she's finally at ease, at least for a little while.

The supporting cast includes Macaulay Culkin in one of his smartest roles in years as Roland, Hilary's handicapped brother, and Eva Amurri who plays the Cassandra, the rebel Jew who joins the Christian school after being expelled from everywhere else.  Hilary has a special vendetta with her, trying her hardest to convert her with some hilarious results.  The rest of the acting is strong as well, with Mandy Moore taking the most of my praise.  She's impressed me before, and after watching her performance here I'm convinced she's one of our most talented cross-over stars!

`Saved' is smart and funny...funny because it's true, and it does a brilliant job of exposing most religion for the hypocrites they really are.  I won't say all religion is corrupt, but most of it is.",1142553600,,2406,4.668246445497631

I do caution though, if you are very religious, particularly of the Christian faith, then you will probably take it personally (which you shouldn't because most movies make fun of everyone at some point or another) and despise it. For anyone who enjoys satirical comedies and is open to new things, Saved is a remarkable gem with too many funny moments to count. I'm dying to tell you all my favorite moments, but I'd rather you see for yourself. The entire cast is just fantastic. I'm not a fan of Mandy Moore's music, but she was an absolutely impressive actress in this film. She has some of the funniest lines in the movie.

2112858,2,B0002OXRSG,"This movie provokes a lot of good questions about the state of Christian culture in North America today.  It does a good job of critiquing some of the hypocrisy many of those who call themselves Christians live out on a daily basis.

However, if the producers intend to critique genuine Christianity, then they have failed.  Their critique ultimately sets them against a straw man of Christianity they themselves have established.  The Christianity they argue against is one in which God becomes a means to the believer's ends.  Mary uses God as a means of justifying her attempt to convert her gay boyfriend in suggesting that Jesus told her to do it.  Hillary Faye uses God as a means of justifying her bullying of those she deems less spiritual than herself.  Principal Skip and Mary's mother use God as a means of justifying their frequent meetings.  The Christianity being opposed here is one where God gets used to accomplish the Christian's ends.  This Christianity is easy to take shots at.  It's not that difficult to set up a straw man and then knock it down.

Not only are the producers guilty of setting up a straw man of genuine Christianity, but the irony of their production comes in being complicit in the very thing they so despise about the faith.  In critiquing a Christianity in which God is used for the believer's ends, the producers have essentially become guilty of the same thing.  Like the characters in the film, they too have used their perception of God and Christian behavior for their own ends.  In the process, they potentially invalidate the very goals they're trying to achieve.  Ironically, they are ultimately no different than Mary, Hillary Faye, and Pastor Skip.",1140307200,7,1700,4.833910034602076
2112859,3,B0002OXRSG,"""I've been born-again as long as I can remember,'' says Mary (Jena Malone), describing her early commitment to Christianity and setting up the audience for the growth her character will experience in ""Saved!""

If you are not sure about whether to watch ""Saved!"" don't be put off by the claims that it is insulting to all ""Christians"" because that is simply not the case (unless there is some hidden agenda hiding under the film's political correctness). The insults are pretty much reserved for the egotistical fundamentalists whose faith is a means to hate and fear anything outside their definition of what is right.

These people are almost too easy a target for satire and Brain Dannelly grabbed at this low hanging fruit because ""Saved!"" is a lazy movie that contains almost nothing original on its subject. Just elicit a feeling of intellectual superiority from your audience, by riffing the feeling of moral superiority the religious conservatives exhibit.

Prospective viewers should know up front that ""Saved"" is the victim of two different Moore curses. The first is the Michael Moore curse where you applaud the concept but cringe about the execution. You agree and support the conclusions but are embarrassed by the ham- handed way they are presented and you wish desperately for a better spokesman.

The second is the Mandy Moore curse. It is not my intention to cast ill will toward the recording artist profession, nor do I wish to give the impression that all female vocalists are bubble-headed idiots with aspirations toward bad acting. I am but a humble viewer with an opinion. The movie speaks for itself.

""Saved! '' fails as a ""funny teen comedy"" because it is not particularly funny. With one exception it is a decent ensemble and many of the characters are entertaining. It works pretty well as a coming of age story told nicely from the POV of Mary who provides voice-over narration. Mary's relationship with her mother, a great performance by Mary-Louise Parker who looks almost too young for the role, is especially well handled. Mary's gay boyfriend gets her pregnant which provides most of the film's humor as she faces the prospect of being an unwed mother by a boy in whose name teen prayer circles have been formed.

Moore plays Hilary Faye, who uses the Calvinist foundation of her personal faith to justify any means that yields a reward. She seems to be trying to channel Reese Witherspoon's frustrated manipulator in ""Election,'' but can't really pull it off. Over-the-top characters like this are the most difficult of roles because the actor needs to convey a subtle element of self-parody, and this takes a special talent. Watch almost anything by Witherspoon, Angela Bettis, Gary Oldham, or Jack Nicholson to see what this concept is all about.

Initially there are two cynics in the artificial environment of the Christian school. Hilary Faye's brother (Macaulay Culkin) is in a wheelchair due to a childhood accident and has a detached perspective because of it. He has hooked up with chain-smoking Cassandra (Eva Amurri-Susan Sarandon's daughter), an outsider because she is Jewish and a rebel because the film needs one.

Culkin is good but Amurri has the impossible task of convincing you that someone who lies, cheats, steals, swears, and treats everyone with disrespect is a hero. This doesn't work, even in this environment, and it almost undermines the whole project because it so obviously reflects Dannelly's underlying hypocrisy. Fortunately Culkin, Amurri, and Malone have enough scenes together that Cassandra's likable dimensions can be introduced.

Mary is being romantically pursued by Patrick Fugit and their scenes together have a lot of charm. He is the son of school's unhappily married pastor (Martin Donovan) whose character is not even remotely believable? He is far too conflicted to ring true, just an implausible character who wavers between absolute extremes. Donovan's stuff should have found its way to the deleted scene bin.

Bottom line, for all its faults ""Saved!"" is better than at least half the movies out there. It has some excellent elements but don't expect a lot of laughs. But do expect to feel a little ashamed and uncomfortable about having someone as clumsy and clueless as Dannelly representing you.

Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",1139011200,,4330,5.050420168067227
2112860,2,B0002OXRSG,"I just had the opportunity to view this nazarene cult-comedy tonight on cable, and was rather repulsed by this presentation, yet both morbid curiosity and evocative meditation beckoned Me on. Having attended Christian schools until Junior High, this proposed satirical film actually contains many truths in the behavior and attitudes exhibited by these subhuman types. The sad dependence on others' opinions, all seemingly administered by the moldy babble according to the personal translation of the particular preacher at the school or church, the sub-par music, the sacharrine niceness, etc. Although the Protestants are much more nauseating and exagerrated than the Catholics.*

Seeking to ""save"" her boyfriend Dean from being gay, a girl named Mary fornicates with him and becomes pregnant from this devirginization, hiding it from the rest of the christian-cult subculture. She claims 'Jesus' told her to do so, after an underwater bump in the head yields a hallucination - the face of the nazarene super-imposed upon the likened visage of the poolboy who also happens to have long hair and a beard.

Finding a copy of 'Macho' magazine, his parents send him to a rehabilitation center for ""degayification"", where he actually finds a gay partner and male prom date.

Cassandra, the resident bad girl, rumored to be a 'stripper', a smoking Jewish rebel, goes about expressing her independence against the christian oppression from lighting a cigarette in the cafeteria, to undulating in a sensual euphoria, jesting at the supposed 'speaking in tongues' glossolalia while tearing at her clothes. I like the way she plays with the sheeps' mind from time to time  - in one instance claiming to want to convert to Christianity, but at the last moment decides to side with Satan instead. In reality, she would have been expelled the second she was spotted with a cigarette in her mouth, even from the parking lot.

Mary's secret is eventually discovered and exploited by smug classmates. I thought the ""drive-by exorcism"" was amusing, as the christians actually consider the bible a veritable 'weapon', as in the so-called ""sword of the spirit"", which Hilary Faye, a very 'Chastity Paraya"" / ""Betty Bowers""-like character takes to a literal extreme and actually throws it at 'Mary' {'coincidence' that she was named such? As she finds herself in a similar position as the fabled 'Virgin Mary'}.

Predictably, Hilary Faye demonstrtaes her hypocrisy at the Prom, as it turns out that it was she who was responsible for vandalizing the school with devil-worshipping symbols such as the inverted cross and a '666', all in an attempt to blame the 'bad kids' and assure her place as the Prom Queen. In another amusing scene towards the finale, in a nervous fit, she actually drives her van into a garish image of Jesus.

Keep in mind that there are actually clonish people who act like this, existing in an entire haze of justified delusion. This film is actually not far-fetched at all, which is probably the most disturbing element herein.

2112861,4,B0002OXRSG,"I haven't had the kind of feelings at the conclusion of a movie in months, perhaps years, that I had when I first saw ""Saved!"", a comic satire set in a Christian school about high school power brokers, Christianity, doing the right thing and questioning your learned values.

The story revolves around school leader Hilary (Mandy Moore) and heroine Mary (Jena Malone), a good Christian that gets pregnant in her first sexual encounter for a good cause. She is then ostracized from her peer group of unChristian Christians, at which point the story becomes a morality play as well as juvenile comedy.

At one point in the film Mary stands before the cross and utters profanities to it, her admission that she tried to do the Christian thing and it resulted in her world going into an abyss of misery, confusion and the frightful unknown instead of absolution. Her role in this movie is the portrayal of every Christian that is hidebound to carry out their learned beahvior while simultaneously living their life as a human and sinner on our planet.

A cast of fine actors incluidng Macaulay Culkin and Martin Donovan contribute to this funny, touching and intimate look at life in a Christian school where all is not as moral and orderly as it appears. It gets a bit formulaic at the end but still succeeds as comedy, morality play and entertainment.

What makes this film sensational is how closely the script mimics the real life of most Christians, who try to do what they're taught but somehow end up doing the human thing instead. In addition, this movie has a terrific soundtrack.

This is a great film for kids and adults although it may be a bit too open for conservative parents with small children. You might want to screen it first before letting the little ones watch.",1138320000,4,1779,4.707395498392283

Does being a Christian mean that you have to pretend that you are perfect?  When something bad happens to you does that mean that you are 'out of God's will'?  Why isn't the pastor sent away to a camp because of his sexual sin?  Why just the gay guy? Why didn't anyone question Hilary's (Mandy Moore's character) angry outbursts and rudeness before they found out that she framed Mary and the other girl?

My last question is, why is it that it is 'speaking out against sin' for Christian groups like Focus on the Family to critisize anyone who disagrees with them but they are suffering 'persecution' because of this movie and other groups speak out against them?

The setting is a fundamentalist Christian Baptist Highschool where everyone in the student body is endlessly praising Jesus and God and stretching their modes of entertainment and socialization to focus on religious concepts.  Mary (!) (Jena Malone) is a sweet kid whose mother Lillian (Mary-Louise Parker) is off in her own world but supportive of her daughter who can do no wrong.  Mary eyes handsome athletic Dean (Chad Faust) who is gay and Mary 'sacrifices' her virginity to save Dean's sinful soul: they bed and she becomes pregnant, but only after Dean is sent away to a de-gaying Mercy Center.  The leader of the student body Jesus group is Hilary (Mandy Moore) who seeks to 'save' every lost soul, especially the sole Jewish 'ex-stripper' Cassandra (Eva Amurri - Susan Sarandon's talented daughter) who smokes, drinks, and seduces physically challenged, wheelchair bound Roland (Macaulay Culkin) who has been in Hilary's keeping.  This set of problems all come to various resolutions at the infamous Prom, just like in all the old movies of the forties.  But in the meantime no variation of normal goes unscathed: the disabled, out of wedlock pregnancies, gays, Jews, and all people outside fundamental religious beliefs (sound familiar?).

While much of the script is clunky and the story irritating to people of open minds, there is some fine work by most of the actors.  It is a black comedy and if taken as such, it shouldn't seriously offend anyone - unless you choose to let it.

2112867,4,B0002OXRSG,"Saved! (Brian Dannelly, 2004)

I've been finding myself quite enamored of the mean-spirited teen comedy recently. First it was Mean Girls, and now I find myself smitten by Saved!.

Saved! Is the story of Mary (Jena Malone of Donnie Darko fame), a student at a strict Baptist school who becomes pregnant while trying to save her boyfriend Dean (The 4400's Chad Faust) from his homosexuality. Faced with what she is sure will be complete ostracism from her former friends, she tentatively befriends the school outcasts, Cassandra (Anywhere but Here's Eva Amurri) and Roland (child star Macaulay Culkin, all grown up). Things start to get complicated when both Mary and her best friend Hilary Faye (singer Mandy Moore) both fall for the new transfer student, Patrick (DeadBirds' Patrick Fugit).

Where Mean Girls tried to hide its mean spirit to some extent, there's none of that in Saved!; the movie revels in its meanness in the same way, say, South Park does. Screenwriters Dannelly and Michael Urban obviously have a bone to pick with religious high schools, and they let out as many stops as they can and still have a marketable movie. The actors here are obviously having a ball with the material, and Dannelly's directorial role, in most cases, is to be as invisible as possible and simply let the drama play out in front of the camera. In the other cases, it's to add all sorts of odd little digs that will probably require multiple viewings to get (for example, having the supposedly uber-Christian rock band playing the prom cover Replacements songs rather than Christian rock standards).

A barrel of fun, though I doubt your fundamentalist friends would appreciate it if you happened to have it on when they came over. *** ",1131408000,2,1732,4.897610921501706

2112872,5,B0002OXRSG,"I went to a high school very similar to the one portrayed in SAVED. Obviously this is an exaggerated portrayal, but the underlying commentary is fabulous. I was a Catholic girl at a Southern Baptist high school and was told constantly how sad it was that I wouldn't be in heaven. Hilary Faye, anyone?

Mandy Moore does a beautiful job of being a completely confused teenage girl who is trying to build herself up by pushing other people spiritually down. She's absolutely hateable, pitiable, and in the end, almost likeable.

Jena Malone is unbelievable. I had never seen her before, but she absolutely stole my heart. Her character Mary is a wonderfully written girl who tries to do what she thinks is right, but it goes all wrong. Jena's acting was beautiful, and I look forward to seeing more of her work.

The supporting cast was phenomenal as well. Macaulay Culkin does a wonderful job as Hilary Faye's brother Roland, a boy stuck at a Christian school who wants something more. Patrick Fugit is the ultimate romantic teen lead as Pastor Skip's son Patrick: he's not airbrushed, he's not a pretty-boy, and he's not wearing eyeliner. He's just the sweet, genuine boy-next-door, and you love him for it. (He also does not overact, which would have been incredibly easy to do in his role.) Eva Amurri plays a very real character as well: she's the Jewish girl at the Christian school, and she's sick and tired of people trying to ""save"" her. She just wants to be who she is.

Other remarkable actors include Chad Faust as Mary's boyfriend Dean, Mary-Louise Parker as Mary's mother, and Heather Matarazzo as Tia, a girl who's eager to fit in with Hilary Faye.

As a Christian, I was not offended by this movie. I thought it was a very well-done commentary on typical human behavior. Religion is fine, but don't use it as a crutch, and don't lord it over other people.",1125446400,19,1868,4.665653495440729

2112874,3,B0002OXRSG,"Hey, we get it, already.  SAVED! (gotta include that exclamation point there) is a comedy about the out-of-control antics of kids attending a Christian high school.  And yes, we get it:  this is no ordinary Christian school, this is a shining Holier-than-thou-on-the-Hill kind of school, where God and Jesus are bounced around like an over-inflated beach ball.

Granted, SAVED! (Amen!) has many cute and cuddly moments, and the cast (accept for MaCaulay Culkin, more on that later) is fun to watch, and even more fun to get to know, yet the movie hits the viewer between the eyes with its satirical message of fundamentalist Christianity in hypocritical overdrive to the point said viewer has a knot on his noggin'.  Kind of like:  Okay, we understand the hypocracy message, thank you very much.  Let's see some more of Mandy Moore in a cute blouse.

Without giving away any of the plot (as I'm too darned lazy at the moment), this flick presents the trials and tribulations of a group of very devout young people as they attend their last year of Super Duper Christian school, and even though all of them are immersed in the Faith, somehow the Faith just don't seem to measure up to Biblical expectations.  There's heartbreak, confusion, anxiety, anger--heck, all of the things one expects from normal teens.  The story is predictable, the ending rather weak, and even though I chuckled a handful of times I still would like to see Mandy Moore in yet another cute blouse.  Maybe a tube top.

SAVED! is a whirlwind of satirical overkill.  Yet it still has its fair share of humorous moments; I just can't recall them right now.  Jena Malone, Mandy Moore (cute blouse), Patrick Fugit, and Mary-Louise Parker headline a very solid cast, with one exception.  MaCaulay Culkin went through his entire annoying role with a disinterested smirk on his face, and that pretty much sums up how SAVED! (Hallelujah!) affected me.  Now, if you'll hand me the Doritos, it's time for some Deuteronomy.

While, in some cases, obviously over the top, it was very right on with how many evangelical communities think and function.  While completely outrageous and hysterical, the first time watching it was almost painful instead of funny.  As stated before, Saved does an ingenious job of bringing to life some of idiotic prejudices in some religious communities.  However, upon second watching, I was much more able to simply laugh at the lives we live.  The writing in Saved is superb, quick, irreverent, believable, go for the punches funny.  This movie would be enjoyable as just a movie to anyone that has a sense of humor.  However, to those of us who grew up in similar situations, it will act as therapy and help you see the humor in things we took so serious.  Highly, highly recommended.

2112876,4,B0002OXRSG,"""Saved"" is one of those films that has actually kept me believing that there is some good that may come from Hollywood studios. Over the last few years there has been remake after remake of older films which comes nowhere near the original or just recycled film ideas which ends up being crappy.

This film has a good cast which includes Mandy Moore and Macaulay Culkin and starts Jena Malone of 'Donnie Darko' fame. The cast works well since there is a good enough mix of star power and lesser known actors in the film. This is probably Moore's best film to date as she plays such a good mean girl. Culkin in this film has risen out of the shadows of obscurity and plays all of the emotions a teenager may have of their sibling. Whether or not one may admit it, anyone in his position may be inclined to at least think of some of the things Culkin's character does to Moore's character.

The film is based around Malone's character (Mary), a teenage girl living in the suburbs of Baltimore, Maryland and her boyfriend Dean wants to be sure that he is not gay, so he end sleeping with her and then Malone ends up pregnant. The movie goes through Mary's ups and downs with dealing with her pregnancy while attending a christian fundamentalist high school.

I don't want to give away the whole plot of the story, but this is an excellent film to watch. I am also glad that Brian Dannelly has worked on a film that does challenge the huge christian fundamentalist presence has in American society. I will admit that this film is not revolutionary in talking about the effects of Christian Fundamentalism, but it's good to see there is something else out there that does challenge the beliefs held by quite a few people in America. The film works well with being simplistic in nature rather than trying to address so many issues found within Christian Fundamentialism.

Even though the ending is a nice, but not everything in real life ends up in such a neat little package and it would of been better if the story at the end reflected it that a little bit more. But overall this is one of the best films of 2004, a must see.",1121472000,4,2121,4.458762886597938
2112877,5,B0002OXRSG,"My g/f picked up this movie and I thought oh no another one of those corny teen movies.  But we started watching it and it was really good.  The acting was great, the plot was great, and the broader message that the film was trying to convey was very revealing.

Basically the movie illustrates the rampant hypocricy and narrow mindedness of the Christian Right/religious fundementalist who say one thing and do another.  At the same time, the movie presents religion (at least what it should be) as a dynamic and encompassing entity.  The plot is very believable up until the final stages of the movie, but that's not the point.  On the whole, I highly recommend this movie to everyone.",1121385600,2,687,4.683333333333334
2112878,3,B0002OXRSG,"Saved! was portrayed in trailers as a teen drama that mocks Christian fundamentalism.  Unfortunately, it's not much more than that.

The cast consists of several familiar faces: Devout Christian Mary (Jena Malone, from the far superior Donnie Darko) discovers that her ice-skating boyfriend, Dean (Chad Faust), is gay.  When she has a vision that Jesus tells her to ""help Dean,"" she takes that to mean she should ""cure"" him of his ""affliction.""  So she does it the way any red-blooded teenager might, which is how she gets pregnant.

Of course, Dean can't possibly be cured, so he's shipped off to a...for lack of a better word, ""de-gay-ification"" camp.  If you think this is a joke, Google ""love in action"" to see a real life example of such a camp.

In the mean time, Mary's in trouble.  She attends a Christian fundamentalist school (""American Eagle"") and is part of the Jewels, a girl gang led by the blonde and tanned Hilary Faye (Mandy Moore).  Hilary takes obnoxious fundamentalism to new levels, hosting prayer groups for Dean and shunning anyone who doesn't adhere to her own agenda.

Unfortunately for Hilary, she has a disabled brother (Roland, played by Macaulay Culkin in his best role to date) who hates her.  I don't mean normal dislike between siblings.  In fact, it's difficult to believe they really are siblings.  Roland hooks up with the only other rebel (and Jew) in the school, Cassandra (Eva Amurri).  The inevitable ostracism that comes about from their differences binds Roland, Cassandra, and Mary together.

Plot points continue to spin out from the main thread, including Mary's crush on the principal/pastor's son (Patrick, played by...Patrick Fugit) and her mom's crush (the delectable Mary-Louise Parker) on the principal/pastor (Skip, played by Martin Donovan).  These two side plots distract from the film's message.  In fact, both crushes are patently unbelievable.  The adult romance happens almost entirely off screen.  Conversely, Patrick pursues Mary against every deterrent, including rejection, the fact that she's pregnant, and that a hot chick (Hilary) is always after him.

It's unfortunate that this film is considered so revolutionary, in that American media has a very difficult time openly criticizing Christian fundamentalism (especially these days).  The concepts here have been handled with much better directing and a tighter plot in Donnie Darko, Napoleon Dynamite and American Beauty.  Given that the plot bounces ahead from holiday to holiday, it's sometimes hard to follow what's going on.

The main villain, Hilary, is a one-dimensional caricature.  It comes as no surprise when we discover that Hilary has a dark secret, but the secret's really lame.  What's worse is that her brother betrays her in such a horrible fashion, acting decidedly un-brother-like.

On the other hand, the film shows Roland as a real teenager who happens to sit in a wheelchair.  His character develops throughout the movie and he truly comes of age, realizing that he doesn't want to depend on anybody (including his girlfriend) if he wants to respect himself.

Throughout all the teen and adult angst is the persistent theme of Christianity being abused and used in ways that are borderline ridiculous. Or, it would be, if these schools didn't actually exist.  But they do, so it's not quite as amusing and a little disconcerting.  Can anyone use pseudo-speak words like ""gangsta"" and ""for the Lord"" in the same sentence without cracking up?  If you think this is a joke, Google ""Christian fundamentalist high school"" to see a real life example.

Indeed, there's quite a bit of cult-like activity that takes place in the school, from the aforementioned hybridized speech to dozens of kids with their eyes closed, hands up, swaying to Christian rock.  Which sounds suspiciously like regular rock only with the words changed. The requirement for good girls to lust after boys is their connection to Christian groups, not their actual morality; so it's okay to want the bandleader of Godflight or the pastor's son.

The director, Brian Dannelly, obviously has some issues he's working out (see the IMDB entry for his other film, He Bop).  His style is a little too heavy-handed for my tastes, smashing the audience over the head with Christ symbolism, the likes of which I haven't seen since Mimic.  The movie culminates in a prom, clumsily tying all the loose ends together in one neat, tidy package.  And we're expected to believe that the pretty, popular girls don't have dates-oh what sweet, unrealistic revenge this movie is!

And that's the problem. Saved! is alternately too contrived or not vicious enough.  The characters aren't all convincing in their sins or their zeal, and sometimes it just feels like the film is a moral parable masquerading as a movie; a dumbed down liberal version of a Jack Chik rant against the perils of fundamentalism.  We get it: ""Why would God make us all so different,"" asks Mary,"" if he wanted us to be the same?""

If the worst Saved! can point out is that Christian fundamentalism makes everyone boring, then that's a very mild chastisement indeed.",1121040000,2,5123,5.058402860548272

If you understand the concept behind the movie and not spin off into Never Never land it makes you feel good, being content with being Spiritual, reminding us that the concept of God is bigger than any one faith without getting preachy and boring.

2112881,4,B0002OXRSG,"My fiancee wanted to see this farcical comedy/satire and she tends to get what she wants from me.  The movie is about a teenage girl (Jena Malone) who is brought up in a fundamentalist Christian home and goes to a fundamentalist Christian high school. She fears her boyfriend is gay, and after bonking her head in a swimming pool accident and becoming delirious, has a vision of ""Jesus"", which she interprets as Jesus telling her to try to cure the boyfriend by doing more than just kissing him -- ultimately they had sex and the girl got pregnant.

Then the craziness ensues: including hiding the pregnancy, the actions of the nutter fundamentalist Miss Perfect friend, the Jewish misfit girl in the fundamentalist Christian school stirring things up against the school administration and befriending the pregnant girl, etc.

All told, funny unsubtle satire. Jena Malone starred as the teenage girl and unlike most 17-year olds in Hollywood, she looks like a high schooler. She was OK, more a leaf in the breeze of the movie than anything else. Mandy Moore played the Miss Perfect, Hillary Faye with some giddy excess.

Better still, Eva Amurri as the Jewish troublemaker who stole most of the scenes she was in, and Macauley Culkin as Hillary Faye's embittered paraplegic brother. Years ago some movie reviewer, in his review of The Good Son, wrote that Elijah Wood was a better actor than Culkin, but Culkin had a better role. Today, that's simply not true. Culkin is at his best when understated and not given the melodramatic lead role -- see My Girl. In Saved, he was very good as the sardonic and quietly anti-establishment unfavored sibling and easily the most sympathetic character in the whole bit.

Sure, it has a semi-cheesy ending that wraps things up a little too neatly.  But Saved is a humorous movie that should be approached as the satire it is and enjoyed for that.",1119398400,2,1884,4.817337461300309
2112882,3,B0002OXRSG,"""Saved"" presents us with about an hour of juicy satire, deliciously mean and sometimes hillarious observations about the trappings of fundamentalism.  Then inexplicably, with the finish line in sight, it wraps up in such perfectly trite teen soap-opera pablum that not even John Hughes himself would admit to having penned it.

Mary (oh, the symbolism!) is a perfectly innocent youth at a fundamentalist Christian high school, and is dating an obviously effeminite closet homosexual Dean who figure-skates for Jesus.  When he finally comes out of the closet (in a pool - baptism - oh those clever filmmakers), she is so confused that she strikes her head and has a vision of Jesus.  Jesus advises her to save her boyfriend at any cost, so Mary, desparate to drag Dean away from his gay porn magazines, chooses the LEAST responsible solution to restore his masculinity and has sex with him.  Dean is found out soon thereafter and banished to ""mercy house,"" which is sort of a wayward home for banished troubled teens from Christian houses.  And Mary's troubles are just beginning, as she is destined to be saved by uber-Christian Mandy Moore, playing fast and loose with her good-girl movie image as the delightfully hateful Hillary Faye.

Needless to say, the comic possibilities are endless from this point on and its surprising that the filmmakers don't pursue them more pointedly.  Its as if they are afraid to risk the ""R"".  There are some great moments, such as the scene where Mary symbollically questions her faith by using up all of the PG-13 cursing allotment in front of a church, or the Jesus-themed high school pep rally, complete with group prayer and Glossolalia.

I think in the end the movie suffers the Hughes curse more because there are lots of characters who are interesting or potentially interesting, and not enough screen time to devote them the attention they deserve.  The relationship between Pastor Skip and Mary's mother, or Culkin's character Roland and his romance with Cassandra (played by Eva Amurri),  need to be juiced out more.  When the denouement finally arrives, it is resolved so perfectly and neatly that nearly destroys any of the precious or absurd insights these characters have.  When Pastor Skip gets dressed down, or Hillary Faye gets her comeuppance, it's not because of any sort of genuine insight, but we note its the end of the movie, and according to the teen movie playbook its the time where these plot elements are *supposed* to get wrapped up.  That the juicy dilemmas are reduced and everything is made okay damages the impact of the movie's liberalized pseudo-christian agenda and somewhat nullifies the insight into the mindset of a teen in a genuine crisis of faith such as Mary.  Note to the filmmakers: we're not asking for Citizen Kane every time you roll out the celluloid, but take a chance once in a while and tell the damn happy ending gnomes to take a hike.

Still, this movie is not at all bad.  The movie's basic Christian message -  respecting other folks for who they are - may be a ""common"" observation, but let's be honest here - its one that bears repeating.  Survivors of fundamentalist christian internments like American Eagle High will probably have a good laugh and shudder at the same time.  As others have noted, the soundtrack is definitely up to troubled teen movie standards and then some (was that *REALLY* Paul Westerburg at the senior prom?) And while the movie saves most of the best barbs for Hillary Faye, it is generally respectful to all of its characters and their viewpoints, and the uneven script occasionally resonates with uncanny intelligence.  But for those of you (Christian and non-Christian alike) looking for a more insightful and powerful deliberation on religion and humanity, try Scorcese's ""The Last Temptation of Christ"".",1118016000,4,3829,4.940717628705149
2112883,2,B0002OXRSG,"Saved! is advertised as a scathing satire against Christianity, and almost up to the end it seems as if it might keep its promise (despite a ""preacher's son"" character who seems to give a voice to liberal Christianity).

There is a lot of unsubtle but solid performances by its teenage characters, especially Heather Matarazzo as a rebellious Jewish girl of loose virtue, and Macaulay Culkin as a handicapped student who falls in love with her, both getting all the best lines.

The movie promotes individualist values with gusto, all the way to the last scenes, where the movie gives in and betrays its entire premise in favour of a homily of Christian submission, liberal smugness and a feel-good ending. What could have been a brave little movie becomes cowardly treason against all that it stood for.

For rational, individualist values featuring teenagers in prominent roles, look to American Beauty (where Birch and Bentley's relationship provide one of the backbones of the story) or Ghost World. Skip this Christian love-fest.",1116979200,2,1104,5.127777777777778
2112884,5,B0002OXRSG,"I remember when this film was released there was strong backlash against it by conservatives and it never got much in the way of promotion from the studio. Too bad, because it ought to be must viewing for all Christians (and even most non-Christians).

I've read through some, but not all of the reviews to date. Most are positive about the film, but I came across more than few that were negative. One reviewer even referred to it as ""Disgusting!""

And I can tell you why that reviewer said that. Because this film turns a mirror on the hypocrisy that far too many Christians engage in, espousing ""love and forgiveness"" out of one side of their mouth while breathing ""hate and vitriol"" out of the other.

But, back to our film. In a nutshell, Mary is a devout Christian who learns her boyfriend is gay. For reasons best explained by watching the film, she believes Jesus wishes for her to have intercourse with her boyfriend to make him straight. Naturally it doesn't work and backfire when it turns out that her first and only encounter with sex has resulted in her being pregnant.

From there the film follows her travails as she tries to hide her pregnancy but has her eyes opened to the fact that the world isn't as black-and-white as she once thought. In fact, it's filled with a lot of gray.

As is often the case in this type of film, the bad kids at the school turn out to be the good guys and the school's supposed good kids are either bad or just blindly following the lead of others. And as you might expect, everyone learns a lot about tolerance and the true meaning of Christianity by the end of the film.

In fact, in its rush to have a nice, tidy happy ending, the film has its only real failing - everyone pretty much gets a happy ending. It's even alluded to that Mandy Moore's character, who is obstensively the villain, has had her eyes opened to a less closed mind view of Christianity.

The film is filled with humor, actually rarely at the expense of anyone, and rye observations on the viewpoints of conservative Christians. As a Christian myself, I have to say I am frequently bothered by how closed minded so many conservatives are ( a problem that is growing and being fed by the current political environment in our country).

It features a minister who could easily be turned into a caricature, but thanks to good acting and an intelligent script, it deftly sidesteps that potential pot hole. The preacher is one all Christians encounter at one time in their lives, the minister trying very hard to be ""cool."" But this is a minister with a few problems of his own, and the film doesn't allow him to descend into being yet another windbag preacher that we can all make fun of and judge harshly for his actions.

All of the acting is first rate. In her role as Hilary, Mandy Moore is gloriously the pain-in-the-arse popular girl that haunts every high school in American; and Jena Malone deftly maneuvers from a simple, devout young girl to a young woman who questions her faith and ultimately reaffirms it.

You'll love the ending, but in hindsight you'll probably feel (as I did), it ends a little too neatly.

Like I said, this should be must viewing for all Christians. It won't be. And many of those conservative types who see it will decide it's a ""Hollywood"" attack on both their religion and their values. It's not, but it won't be the first time that a closed-mind group fails to ""get the logs"" out of their eyes and see the truth (for you non-Christians, the ""logs"" comment is a Biblical reference).",1116028800,7,3536,4.5266457680250785

It clearly pokes at the evangelical Christian community that often rushes to judge, devalue, denounce, and ostercize those different in society from their own conservative view.  Which IMHO is the exact opposite of God's teaching of compassion, understanding, personal reflection, and openness.  The overall message is that everyone is different and everyone has flaws and differences.  Those flaws and differences do not make you any less of a person in God's eyes and shouldn't in other Christians too, if they are truly followers of Christian faith.

All religions can benefit from watching this movie.  It will really help you question your own opinions, stereotypes, prejudices, and values to determine if you are truly being a person of faith.

I saw it thinking it might be nasty or funny or both, but it was none of these things.  ""Saved"" began as a film that thought it was going to expose and satirize a certain kind of upper middle-class, white, suburban Christian but it ends up being both moralistic and smug.  But it's not bad because its smug, it's bad because its unintelligent and predictable.  We get all the exaggeration of other high school, teen-movie flicks, except this one takes itself seriously, which makes it doubly obnoxious.

One girl finds herself in a morally ambiguous situation and runs into trouble.  She tries to hide her ""mistake"" but can't, thus isolating her from her ""friends"", ultimately to be forced to the darkside.  Her allies on the darkside, symbolized by (holy bejesus!) smoking and recklessly driving old primered cars, seem tough at first but accept the fallen girl.  This leads to the final showdown where the the outcasts gain thier humanity as they forgive, as does the former judgemental villian, who is forgiven.  All this is peppered with some nice, moral catch-phrases (at one point, while hold up the Bible, one character says ""this is not a weapon""!) and everyone learns to ""Live and let live"". Hasn't this theme been played out?

I don't fault the actors for the movie's problems.  While Mandy Moore's role as the villian feels a bit premeditated, she at least has practise playing the perfect, nice girl.  Culkin is good and street wise (I hope the Culkins play something other than this role), and should have been in the movie more, as should have Patrick Fugit (from Almost Famous). And you can't dislike Jena Malone, she's so helplessly...uh... helpless.  Too bad a good cast didn't get a good script.

Maybe a few scenes in the film will hit home for some, there are certianly a few witnesses and confessors who have reviewed the film here.  But, let me confess myself, I too have lived amongst the believers and, while I sometimes thought the hand raising a bit bizzare, what appears in the movie are mocking cliches, not satire.  Ultimately, I find that denigrating moralizers, only to turn around and moralize on behalf of all things warm and fuzzy, is utterly unconvincing and annoying.  There's no expose here.  Unfortunately, there's not much humor or insight either.  Ultimately ""Saved"" is that which it ostensibly skewers: preachy.

(As a side note, I noticed that Michael Stipe co-produced the film.  Now he makes movies as boring and predictanle as his music!)",1114732800,3,2796,4.803347280334728
2112889,4,B0002OXRSG,"I was nervous about seeing this as I hate to see any religion treated with disrespect -- however, I thought their comments were right on target and this film could be a useful basis for a discussion of what constitutes ""moral"" behavior.  But don't think this is a serious movie -- it's not, it's quite funny, and too true at parts.  My favorite line was when a character says ""You don't know what love is.""  Too true of too many people who proselytize their faith rather than simply love the people around them.

The story tells the story of a senior at a Christian (evangelical) high school who gets pregnant (believing in her own tortured logic that she is ""saving"" her boyfriend from something worse by having sex with him).  Rather unbelievably, she gets through her senior year without anyone noticing, but in the course of the year, becomes increasingly disenchanted with the oppressively evangelical group she had been hanging out with (the Christian jewels, as they call themselves).  She begins to move into the crowd of ""outsiders"" at the school, who are actually far more interesting and kinder -- not to mention being more authentically themselves.

The end was too over the top for my taste, otherwise I think I would have given this film 5 stars.",1114041600,3,1260,4.752293577981652
2112890,5,B0002OXRSG,"Well I went to a ""Christian"" school in my youth.  I remember a teacher wrote a note home to my parents because I mentioned that one fidgety child had ""ant's in his pant.""  What sickness must have been present in this teacher's mind to think that my mind could ever have been as dark as hers?

I also remember one daring group of Seniors went to see a Van Halen concert and they were promptly suspended.

In highschool we were told about Satanic music to avoid.  The teacher was trying to tell us how bad Led Zeppelin is - but instead of refering to Zeppelin as a band, the teacher would say: Yeah, Zeppelin, his music is really bad.""  They didn't even know a thing about Led Zeppelin, kind of like a lot of people here who profess to be Christians - yet clearly they are not being honest about having watched this movie.  The funny thing is many of the negative reviewers seem reminiscent of characters right out of the movie itself. HOW FUNNY!",1113523200,7,944,4.36
2112891,5,B0002OXRSG,"So there are two types of reviews on this movie: reviews from Christians and reviews from non-Christian.  Typically, the non-Christians love it and many of the Christians hate it- although I'm seeing a few positive reviews here from Christians...

I'm a very conservative Christian.  I take the entire Bible to be the inspired word of God.  That said, I loved Saved!- the characters were lovable, the dialogue was witty, and nearly everything just worked.  I do take one issue with the movie, which I'll get to later.

The movie parodies Christian society very well.  I've never attended a Christian school per se, but I've seen many of the absurdities portrayed in the movie, and I've even been a lot of them, myself.  It's very healthy to be able to laugh at yourself or something you're a part of, and Saved! gave me ample opportunity.

The parodies of Christian society are also useful because they show Christian viewers how utterly foolish we must look sometimes to non-Christians.  That's not to say that we should compromise our beliefs (at all!), but we have PLENTY of room to lighten up.

Meanwhile, the acting is fantastic.  I absolutely loved Jena Malone (she's awesome in everything), Culkin, and a couple others in their roles.  If the message of the movie to Christians is that we need to stop loving just fellow Christians and turn our attentions outwards to others, then the characters alone accomplish this mission.  I strongly cared for all of the non-Christian or doubting characters by the half-point of the movie.

OK, let me mention where I take issue with the movie.  This is a long explanation here, but this isn't a simple matter.  The movie ultimately gets into a theme of accepting everybody as they are and uses homosexuality as the prime example of society's inability to accept everybody.  I say there is a great difference between 1) loving everybody regardless of orientation and 2) accepting homosexual behavior.  (Certainly you've heard ""love the sinner, hate the sin"".)  The NEW testament is actually very explicit that acts of homosexuality are sins.  Saved! seems to want to ignore the Bible, itself- and that one thing I can't accept.

On a practical level of treating people better, though, it has a point.  Homosexuality may be a sin, but so is robbery, lust, and the common lie.  Even though these are all sins, society tends to treat homosexuals as lepers rather than as people that Christ would love just as much as any other person.

I must add, though, that loving those who are sinning (that's everybody) sometimes requires warning them that they are sinning and helping them through it- it may sound hard and mean, but love isn't always the fuzzy thing we've been taught about.  The movie does make a point, though- certainly the characters in the movie don't take this loving path- they want to hide problems rather than deal with them.

But I digress...I didn't want to talk about that issue too little because it is a complex issue that Saved! gets half right.

If you're a Christian wondering whether this movie is too hostile to your faith, then I encourage you to give it a try.  I found it thoughtful, touching, and thoroughly entertaining.",1113004800,10,3195,4.832412523020258

It starts off with wicked satire and insight ('I've been born again all my life') into American evangelical culture, but it loses its edge as it falls prey to the middle ground, to affirming a vague liberal message of 'living and let live'.  The issues are not followed through; the lure of the teen comedy genre starts to overwhelm it, and the script is not so concerned with satirising this part of American culture.

It's still a good film.  Its strength is its understanding of the comic potential in evangelical culture, its smug certainties and hidden darker sides.  (And I say this as an evangelicalish Anabaptist).

That said, this movie is not just a comedy, especially if you've gone through teenage Christiandom. I cried. I admit it. I cried because the ending was happy, and the ending would not be happy in real life. I cried because if any professing Christian saw this movie, they'd dismiss it as sacreligious bunk, and completely lose the message. I cried because the message was that Jesus still loves you, even if you're gay or weird or handicapped or even fundamentalist, but I'm not so sure it's true.

If you want to see Mandy Moore portray a character who demonstrates much that is right with Christianity today, then go watch her play ""Jamie"" in ""A Walk To Remember"".

If, on the other hand, you want to see her play a character who symbolizes everything that is wrong with Christianity, then watch her play Hillary Faye in ""Saved"".

It's quite an education, and yes, Christianity is full of persons much like Jamie, and it's also full of people exactly like Hillary.

All in all, this is a thought-provoking film that ultra-conservative Chrisitians are sure to loathe ... and everyone else will love.  Enjoy!

P.S.  For fun, figure out for yourself why Jamie is what's right and Hillary is what's wrong.  I could explain it to you, but I'm sure you'll be more satisfied with your own answers.  Have at it!",1110931200,3,834,4.657534246575342

Basically, when they wake up to when they sleep - everything in their life is about Christianity.

The first half is more bright and vivid and you feel the movie is going somewhere. The second half, the movie begins to slide. Personally, I thought that Mandy Moore did the best acting. She carries the film on her shoulders. I took off two stars because I thought the other actors were mediocre, the second half of the movie was ok and of course there has to be a ""prince"" who loves a girl even though she is pregnant and he takes her in a limo.

In the end, let's just say, everything is good after that.

Mandy Moore played the brat to perfection, she was pretty good, considering her resume of movies. Maclulay Culkin gave a decent performance and really didn't impress me, He really is well beyond his years. The satire of the movie was equal to Kevin Smith's movie Dogma, which was also brillant.

It is to my mind the most genuine expression of Christianity that I've seen onscreen.  It deals with doubts, mistakes, forgiveness, love, tolerance, humor, rebellion, fright, anger, and ambiguity.  Wryly, ""Saved!"" contrasts people's real, living, questioning faith against hypocritical outward appearances.  There are no ""good"" or ""bad"" characters in this film, only real human beings who are each wonderful and flawed in their own ways -- all with questions, all with doubts, all with faith.

It shows in wonderful and heartwarming ways the real truth of Christianity:  that the faith of Christ is not and never has been a religion of ""easy answers"" and harsh judgment; it is a religion of mystery, paradox, Faith, and love.

2112903,5,B0002OXRSG,"The movie is a realistic yet comical portrayal of the problems of teenagers and criticisms of exaggerated religiousness. The characters are likable and the story flows well. Even the music is well suited for their scenes. The DVD release gave audiences a variety of extra features as well.

The script is witty and genuine. Although the story seems outrageous, the other aspects make it an excellent movie. The music chosen is excellent; Mandy Moore sings ""God Only Knows,"" a version of Depeche Mode's ""Personal Jesus"" plays and Chantal Kreviazuk's ""In This Life"" plays during a particularly pivotal scene. The amazing young cast is very realistic in the roles.

The film touched on controversial issues that others refuse to address.

I love the scene where Mary comes back from her appointment with a doctor sure that she is pregnant. She stops by a church and holds out her arms, and in her swearing questions God for the first time. It is a very powerful scene. The prom sequences were also powerful as the climax of the movie.

The story could be examined as an attack on Christianity, but that is far from the truth. It is instead an attack on hypocritical Christians. Scenes that show Pastor Skip trying as hard as he can to use teenage language to reach out to the students is in many ways admirable. His bursts of, ""Who's down with G-O-D?"" and ""I was thinking of something a little less gangsta'"" are funny, but they in no way degrade his character. Conversations in an extended scene included on the DVD about whether convicted felons who are saved just before execution go to heaven over those never taught of Christianity are never really solved and are thus left to the viewer to ponder and decide. The biggest attack is on Hilary Faye who means well through most of the movie but often uses her religion to put herself ahead of everyone. The character is commanding and hypocritical. She condemns Mary because Mary stands up for her boyfriend and Hilary frames Mary's group of new friends to get them expelled from the school. Then she lies about it. The whole time she acts as if she is a perfect person and has the right to judge other people for making mistakes. Eva Amurri played the Jewish rebel of the school extremely well and ironically embodies the spirit of a true Christian. She helps Mary when she needs a friend most. It is easy to see why Mary is the one that is happy in the end. The theme reflects humanity; it is living a life as best as a person can while knowing they cannot be perfect. As Mary says, ""No one fits in one hundred percent of the time.""

The extras on the DVD are abundant. Two audio commentaries are added, one with the crew and one with two female cast members. Bloopers, deleted and extended scenes, a featurette, a trailer and subtitles are also included. The commentary featuring Jena Malone and Mandy Moore displays interesting personal opinions and secrets of production. The rest of the extra features, though abundant, are not as interesting. The bloopers are not very funny. The deleted and extended scenes were cut out for obvious reasons. The featurette is short and the trailer is not the one seen on television. Part of the reason for lack of quality in the additional features is the short shooting schedule. The movie was only filmed in twenty-eight days. However, this is yet just another reason why the movie itself is so wonderful.

Women might like the movie more than men because of the love story involved, but they can be promised at least a few laughs. Overall, this movie appeals to everyone.",1109635200,14,3564,4.685303514376997

2112909,5,B0002OXRSG,"It's been a very long time since I have enjoyed a teen comedy. I was relieved to finally see a teen comedy that's smart, funny and wicked. Director Brian Dannelly does a very impressive job here delivering a new and fresh teen comedy with a perfect cast.

Finally, Mandy Moore has stepped up from playing innocent good-girl roles as seen in ""A Walk To Remember"" to playing the exact opposite here as a vicious over-the-top Christian girl.

This movie is different from other teen comedies and its clearly known by the setting of the movie, a Christian high school.

Many Christians protested this movie saying it mocks the Christian religion and that it is extremely blasphemous and irreverent. But I disagree. The strength of this movie is in its message; We shouldn't belittle others for being different and for doing things that we don't agree with. One of my favorite lines from the film is when one of the character holds a bible and says ""this is not a weapon"".

The story revolves around good-girl Mary, played wonderfully by Jena Malone, a Christian and one of the members of the Christian Jewels (a Jesus cheerleading group led by Mandy Moore's character Hilary Faye). Mary has the perfect Christian boyfriend, Dean (Chad Faust). Or so she things he's perfect.

Dean reveals to Mary that he thinks he's gay. At that moment, after Mary bumps her head, she thinks she sees a vision of Jesus who tells her to save Dean. Mary decides to give up her virginity to save Dean and in exchange, God will restore her spiritual virginity. But Mary becomes pregnant and Dean is sent to Mercy House, a place that deals with drug abuse, pregnant teens and de-gayification.

Believing that God has betrayed her, Mary losses faith. Her best friend Hilary Faye believes that Mary is ""back-sliding into the flames of Hell"" and tries to save her by praying for her. Hilary Faye even goes as far as trying to perform an exorcism on Mary in a hilarious and emotional scene.

Mary, now an outcast, befriends the other outsiders: The lone Jew (played by the perfect Eva Ammuri), who's also Hilary Faye's foe, and Roland (Macaulay Culkin), Hilary Faye's handicapped brother. Mary also begins to have feelings for Patrick (Patrick Fugit), the son of the Pastor Skip (the hilarious Martin Donovan).

If you have a sense of humor and could see this movie as a satirical comedy, then I recommend you see this movie. This film is not an attack on Christianity; it is an attack on intolerance. There hasn't been many good teen comedies that portray teens the way they should and that tackles real life issues. That is why I appreciate this movie for its strong messages and for being daring.",1107302400,6,2669,4.724731182795699
2112910,4,B0002OXRSG,"Writing a satire about Christianity is something like writing a satire about the American South -- you can't just toss a few ""y'alls"" and a reference to fried foods and smugly call your work ""done."" Yes, here in the South we do say ""y'all"" and you'll be hard-pressed to find a restaurant without deep-fat-treated chicken, but the reality of the culture is infinitely more complex. So too, Christian subculture is much more than the sum of its parts. I simply was not convinced that a two-hour movie could tackle the subject with anything more than a slap-dash spirit of disdain.

Therefore, you must imagine my surprise to find Saved! a funny, true, rather touching and not altogether unsympathetic snapshot of Christian adolescence.

Many of the complaints I'd heard about this movie revolved around what amounts to a misunderstanding: people who were not raised within this subculture watch Saved! and sneer at what they perceive to be a gross exaggeration. However, the crowning glory of this movie is not its elaborate caricature, but its restraint. If the writers had wanted to go over-the-top with their portrayal of a Jesus-centric culture, it would have been terrifically easy ... but they didn't.

As I am prepared to attest, before God and everybody, Saved! gets it just about right.

All the congregation archetypes are present: the dorky/hip late thirty-something youth pastor, the single mom who dresses too sexy for her reputation's good, the band of pretty-and-popular/hyper-sincere teenage girls who have their own Christian music group, the token ""outsider,"" the good-looking athlete who is probably gay ... and even a few of the more subtle, less obvious characters appear as well. I was particularly impressed with the home room teacher -- a woman you only see a couple of times, but you get a pretty good sense of who she is. She's a well-educated, down-to-earth woman who is probably the best quiet ally the girls could have.

Overall, Saved! is an exceptional study in superficiality of all kinds, not just the expected ""Oh, Christians are so shallow."" This facet is present, sure, but it's not the focus -- and for the most part the film makes it abundantly clear that the prejudices of these people are very much their own, merely bolstered and buttressed by a social culture that permits them the freedom to close their minds.

The ""moral"" of the film is not the easy ""Christians are scary and weird,"" but ""socially-imposed religion tends to set standards that are well-nigh impossible to live up to."" During the final ""confrontation"" at the school prom, the gay athlete insists -- completely without irony -- that he's pretty sure Jesus still loves him anyway; and Mary demands to know why, since God made everyone so different, Christianity wants everyone to be the same?

And best of all, at the end of the picture there is no catastrophic anti-religion walk-out. The oddball kids shine as true examples of acceptance and tolerance without abandoning their respective faiths; and if anything, they come out the other side more thoroughly convinced of God's benevolence than when the story began. Saved! does indulge in the requisite ""unmasking of the class phony,"" but the broad label of ""phony"" cannot be applied across the board.

2112913,4,B0002OXRSG,"This teen drama is set against the inventively hilarious background of a Christian community in which the main characters struggle to reconcile their actions with their faith; in some cases, their faith is subverted by the types of high school social politics that are the focus of so many other teen movies.

  Mandy Moore is fiercely cheerful and devout as the popular and powerful student who loves Jesus the most, and who uses her faith like a weapon to keep other students in line. McCaulay Culkin plays her wheelchair-bound brother, who is ejected from Moore's inner circle when he falls in love with the school's lone rebellious Jewish student. Jena Malone is similarly ostracized when she gets pregnant and disillusioned (after hitting her head, she sees a vision of Jesus telling her to have sex with her gay boyfriend in order to convert him to heterosexuality).

  Viewing the sometimes-affected and sometimes-sincere attention to worship is extremely funny, and those scenes are the ones in which the movie makes a genuine unique contribution. The actors all do a terrific job; Malone seems younger and more baby-faced than she has in previous roles, and Moore reminds us of the Reese Witherspoon character in Election (in a good way). Culkin's quirky character is interesting, but nothing about his performance can distract us from how little his features have changed since his Home Alone role.

  Unfortunately, after a promising beginning, the movie moves inexorably towards a wholly predictable ending, involving a comeuppance for the class snob at the annual prom. If the plot had stuck to a level of originality suggested by its premise, the movie would have been golden; as it is, it's still well worth watching.",1106265600,6,1732,5.070422535211268

I watched it with one of my friends who is an ex-pentecostal and grew up attending a Christian high school, and she said that this is actually an understatement of how rediculous things got - which drover her sister to atheism and herself to becoming a confessional Lutheran.

It demonstartes several realities about the legalsim of the charismatics and findamentalists: how by duplicating everything in American culture there no longer is a visisble or experiential difference between what it means to be or not be a Christian, the hypocrisy of their legalistic morality, and the fact that the central theme of Christianity - Christ's sacrifice for sins - is nowhere to be found in their understanding of Christian life.

Unfortunatley, rather than the characters recognizing that they can't be some perfect little angel but rather taht they are sinners in need of forgiveness, the entire Christian faith is thrown down the tubes.  The saddest thing is that charismatic-based fundamentalists, with their hypocritically strict legalistic moral code, have become what people think of when they think of Christanity, and not any form which rests its hope solely upon the Crucified Christ.  To say the least, whoever wrote this movie has been through the system, at least according to those who have seen it that I've spoken to, all who are disaffected members of this sub-culture in North America.",1105920000,5,1475,5.129166666666666

Jena Malone stars as Mary, a student at a Christian high school.  When her boyfriend comes out and tells her he's gay, she is determined to save him, to the point that she has sex with him.  It doesn't work.  He's carted off to a special facility that's supposed to fix wayward teens, and she winds up pregnant.  Finally she realizes that Jesus was never there for her at all, and that the only ones that can help her are the ones who think differently from the masses.

While not exactly mean-spirited, this film does make fun of dogmatic Christians mercilessly, though they aren't likely to realize it if they watch.  With the climate in this country the way it's been lately, I found this very refreshing.  I haven't laughed as hard at a movie in a very long time.  An overly saccharine ending where we are expected to coo over a baby and marvel at the ""miracle"" of childbirth mars it only slightly.

The DVD features two commentary tracks; I didn't get to listen to the director's, but the one by Jena and Mandy Moore is entertaining.  There are also several clips of extended and deleted scenes, bloopers, and a short promotional featurette.

The plot goes like this, four friends (Macaulay Culkin) all go to this zealous Christian school.  However, God's plan is not obviously laid out for these teenagers.  And they soon end up deeper and deeper in controversy, as they try to protect one another from downfall.

The story is funny and very well done.  This is not a Catholic school stereotype so that's a nice uniqueness, and Jesus hating isn't the name of the game here either.  Instead, we all realize that the question of What Would Jesus Do? is a complex one, and deserves some thought.

Macaulay Culkin does a nice job as the handicapped brother (long time no see in the acting world.)  However, I especially liked the acting of Jena Malone, (from Life As A House and Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys)  Jena's character, is contrasted really nicely to Mandy Moore's character too.

The only major flaw I found with it was the ""feel good"" ending that harkened back to John Hughes movies of the 80s, prom scene and all. Even though it's somewhat a black comedy, it doesn't quite go into that territory all that much.

I didn't think that they attacked Christianity (like some of the people who protested the movie had said) as much as they were attacking intolerance, mixed messages, and ""holier than thou"" types.

I would recommend this one more as a rental than a purchase, unless you know someone who had actually gone to schools like that or were around the type of people that are portrayed in the film. Even if some of it seems cartoonish (I do think the director and the cast did make an effort to try to keep them realistic and sympathetic as possible), people like Hilary Faye do exist.

The cast was definitely as good as you can get. Jena Malone's been in ""Donnie Darko"", ""Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys"" (which Kieran Culkin was in) and ""Cold Mountain"", and Eva Amurri's been in films with mom Susan Sarandon (as well as watching step-dad Tim Robbins from the sidelines...Sarandon was also in ""Stepmom"" with Malone as well as Malone's mom in the film Mary Louise Parker being in ""The Client""..).

I feel the film is the proving ground more for Mandy Moore (who is proving herself more in film than trying to compete with Christina Aguilera and Britney Spears in the music stores, and she manages to do a song in the film... although listen to the closing credits, she duets with REM's Michael Stipe on a Beach Boys classic) and Macaulay Culkin (who had been in ""Party Monster"" which had more to do with him coming back into film as an adult after years away..the last one being ""Richie Rich"") than anything else, both having to grow up in public more than any of the others.

The movies revolves around a pregnant teen Mary (Jena Malone) who becomes pregnant when she has sex with her gay boyfriend. The stories backdrop is a strict religous christian school with various characters: the beautiful and judgemental Hillary Faye (Mandy Moore), her disabled but witty brother (Macaulay Culkin), the rebel Jewish student (Eva Amarri). Moore shines as the villian (she plays it well) and Culkin also stands out as smart and charming. The movie's ending does falter as it tries to press its point of tolerance instead of letting comedy serve the topic up for discussion amoungst viewers.

Yes, for the first five minutes or so, we hear Jena Malone's character Mary narrate about her fabulous Christian life and it's almost enough to make one wince. But soon, that all changes.

The storyline has been repeated before: When Mary realizes her boyfriend is gay, she tries to save his soul by sleeping with him, supposedly because she saw a vision from Jesus. Her wanton behavior makes her end up pregnant and the rest is basically trying to hide such a ""shameful"" fact from her friends (including Mandy Moore as Hilary Faye), all while making new friends with the school's only Jew and [...] chick, Cassandra. Along the way Mary also catches the eye of the principal's son, Patrick.

""Saved!"" is unapologetic in its writing; it pops you with edgy satire and out-of-nowhere hilarity. Jena Malone also happens to be one of my favorite actresses, also shining in other great films like ""Donnie Darko"" and ""The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys.""

It is a spot-on satire of teen flicks from 'Carrie' to 'She's all That': complete with a prom scene.  The fact that these are Christian teens immersed in a confused jumble of both fierce and feel-good fundamentalism is the heart of the satire.

It has all the teen flick requirements: sensible, sensitive brunette lead, horrid popular girl with fab hair, bad girl, wannabes, and of course, the cute, sincere bad boy.  The brilliance of this flick is the subtelty and grace with which the teen stereotypes are placed in a Christian context.  Hiliary Faye is as vain and horrible as the Rose McGowen character in the wretched 'Jawbreaker'-and it's a hoot to watch.  The cast quirky and wonderful.

A lot of the criticism of this movie is that it is portraying a negative view of Christians.  This misses the point.  This is a movie about power struggles, mistakes, and earnestness and ambition turned to bitterness.  These things don't happen in Christian school?  They happen everywhere else.

Jena Malone is cast as another high school girl who also loves Jesus and Christianity.  She's such a true believer that when her boyfriend thinks he is gay, she sacrifices her virginity to prove he is normal.  Of course this leads to a pregnancy.  But that's just one of the subplots here.  There are several more.

Eva Amurri (who, in real life is Susan Sarandon's daughter) is cast as the only Jewish girl in the school who everyone is trying to convert.  She's outspoken and sexy and not afraid of being different.  She even starts a romantic relationship with Macaulay Culkin, who is wheelchair bound.  This is a good role for him and brings out the many challenges that physically disabled teenagers have to face.

The inanities spouted by the wishing to be so hip Principal (expertly portrayed by Martin Donovan) e.g., ""Who's down with G. O. D.?  or ""We're gonna kick it Jesus style!""  cannot help but provoke torrents of laughter.

If you grew up in a Fundamentalist Christian household and felt  you never belonged there, this movie will resonate strongly, hilariously - with just the right touch of unease.

Every performance rings strong and true and is cast to perfection. The normally intolerable Mandy Moore here is magically delicious, cast perfectly as Hillary Faye.

Though in essence an ensemble comedy, Jena Malone gives a standout performance as Mary, the high schooler around whom ""Saved!"" logically revolves.  Sacrificing her virginity (Jesus told her to) to save her gay boyfriend she finds herself alone and pregnant, her perfect Christ centered teenage life unraveling faster than a fishing line with a 50 pound hook.

The cameo by Valerie Bertinelli starring in a Lifetime (""television for women"") movie sendup adds just the right touch of creepiness to this delightful comedy.

(Be sure to watch the blooper reels, deleted and extended scenes where you also find out how wheelchair bound Roland (a hilarious McCauley Caulkin) is ""healed."")

Even through all of the laughter, ""Saved!"" addresses a myriad of legitimate societal issues: teen pregnancy, single parenting, friendship, adultery, homosexuality, bigotry and makes some very strong points about tolerance and acceptance.

Mary sums up the theme of the movie (and what is so very wrong with extreme fundamentalism of any stripe) ""Why would God make us all different if He wanted us to be the same?""",1102032000,8,1799,5.204861111111111

More importantly, although there are a few times when the movie becomes too sweet, not everyone in the movie gets a happy ending, which makes Saved more realistic than one might expect.",1101600000,4,718,4.752

It's a nice message, but I felt like I was a grade-schooler watching Free to Be You and Me all over again.

insiders to Jesus becoming outsiders during the course

of grad year in a Christian high school, and all the

biblical lustings of the flesh against the Spirit. The

outsiders to the faith, however,turn out to have the biggest hearts, strongest convictions, and greatest redemptions.

The movie, in typical Hollywood inclusiveness of all religions and sexual orientations, conspiciously leaves out Islam and Asian faiths, and has only passing references to African and native Americans:""Of course Jesus is White"". Great performances by all the cast, especially the photogenic Mandy Moore, in her role of the misguided over-achieving group leader.

2112949,5,B0002OXRSG,"Smart, thought-provoking movies haven't exactly been rampant these days. There are few films that have made people raise an eyebrow or think about the point for more than two seconds. Over the summer, a film came along and resurrected the name of cinema as well as its distributor, MGM Films.

Opened first at Sundance and then into select theaters (in larger cities), a movie with a young but talented (which is hard to come by) cast and a hilarious and tight storyline proved itself as the best comedy of the year. The film is called Saved! and is hailed by Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times as ""A sassy and smart teenage comedy.""

Saved!, directed by Brian Dannelly and produced by Michael Stipe (yes, of REM fame), starts out as a simple story of kids at a super-fundamentalist Christian high school called American Eagles. The main character and narrator, good girl Mary (Jena Malone), is headed in the right direction in terms of faith with her best friend Hilary Faye (Mandy Moore) and boyfriend Dean (Chad Faust). In a harmless game of ""secrets under water,"" Dean confesses to questioning his sexual orientation to Mary.

Stunned, Mary tries to ""save"" her boyfriend after a blow to the head and a ""vision"" of Jesus Christ... and ends up pregnant.

Through the serious twist the film takes, the jokes are plenty-many of the sidesplitting lines come from Hilary's ""differently able"" wheelchair-bound brother Roland (Macauly Culkin-yes, the Home Alone kid!) and Jewish rebel Cassandra (Eva Amurri), whom everyone wants to ""save.""

The story continues as Mary becomes ostracized by probably the only friends she's ever had-but finds that there is always someone who is willing to support her, even if they are a little off from everyone else.

More important is the fact that the film is a satire of fundamentalist religious beliefs and how interpretation is, and should be, open to anyone. All the way to the breathtaking ending, it also asks people to leave their minds open and to look for gray areas because black and white doesn't always necessarily hold true-especially in current times.

The cast is strong and well-picked. Malone, Moore and Amurri butt heads with the best of them and Culkin's Roland steals almost every scene he's in. The film also stars Heather Matarazzo (Welcome To The Dollhouse), Mary Louise Parker (Red Dragon, Angels In America), Patrick Fugit (Almost Famous) and includes a hilarious cameo by Valerie Bertinelli as a cheesy TV-movie actress (such a stretch!).

Although the film is a comedy (and will make you laugh... a lot), it tackles a severely serious issue that does apply to the youth of today's culture-finding oneself and questioning everything that's been taught. It should be watched by anyone and everyone willing to have an open mind.",1101081600,3,2787,4.965665236051502
2112950,4,B0002OXRSG,"Sometimes the truth can hurt.  In ""Saved!,"" fundamentalist Christians get a healthy dose of this fact.  Now before somebody jumps on me for attacking Christians, let me tell you that I grew up in a fundamental home.  When I went to college I became a ""Bible-thumper"" for a couple of years.  I'm not saying that that is a terrible thing, I'm just saying that many Christians, especially younger ones, can take their beliefs to an extreme level that not only discourages others into finding out about their faith, but can run people off completely.  I did the exact same thing whenever I got caught up in the Bible-study groups and the youth concerts.  I spouted ""truths"" that I had no basis for.  I attacked the heathens who didn't believe what I thought was the truth.  But when I started to take a hard look at my faith, I noticed that there are some things that can cause a rift between ""good"" Christians and those who go against the grain.  I was given the cold shoulder for some of my beliefs, which I now came to through the use of the Bible and not just what I was told by my so-called friends.

I saw a lot of similarities in the characters portrayed in ""Saved!"" in myself during my college years, as well as in many of the people that I have interacted with during my life.  Mandy Moore's character is, unfortunately, one of the most realistic characters in this film.  She might have good intentions, but behind her fake front is a multitude of failures, weaknesses, and selfishness.  I would lose count trying to figure out how many people I know like her character.  Jena Malone's character reminded me a lot of myself in college.  I trusted everything that I was told until I made a decision on my own.  Granted, it wasn't a decision as extreme as hers to help turn a gay boy into a straight one, but it was a decision that alienated me from many of the people that I had befriended.  I chose to become Catholic.  Other than being a Satan worshipper, becoming Catholic is probably one of the worst things that a kid growing up Baptist can do.  Macauley Culkin turned in a grand performance as Moore's wheel-chair bound brother.  He seemed to be the most level-headed kid out of the bunch.  The ""only Jewish kid at the school"" represented, to me, all of the people on the outside looking in who can't understand what all of this is about.  Unfortunately, these types of people usually get confronted by people like Moore's character, who can do a great deal of damage.

In the end, all of the characters presented in this film give us an extreme glimpse at fundamentalists and the way people see them in real life.  The sad thing is that this is an accurate portrayal of a lot of these people.  The only character who is a little out of whack is the preacher's son.  In my experience, these kids are usually the most dysfunctional in a fundamentalist church.  In this film, I think the preacher's son represents the average fundamentalist, who isn't out to force their beliefs on people, but wants everyone to know where they stand.  He's a good person, and I honestly think that most fundamentalists are like this.

I'm willing to bet that most extreme fundamentalists will write this film off as a hateful and mean look at their people without even watching the entire film.  They'll say that only heathens will enjoy this movie and that it sends the wrong message to today's youth.  These are the same people who believe that Harry Potter is the devil and that heavy metal played backwards leads to suicide.  The fact is that this movie shows us the good and bad of fundamentalists and that they have problems just like everyone else.  I'll agree with another reviewer that the film does try to impress some worldly views on people, but I think that the overall message of this flick outweighs those views.  So what is that message?  Love one another.

Highly recommended, but if you are a fundamentalist, you'll have to be ready to take a truth pill while watching this one.",1101081600,10,3989,4.545582047685834
2112951,5,B0002OXRSG,"*Note* Possible plot points are marked with ### so you can skip them if youd like.

This movie takes place in a Christian high school where dysfunction abounds.  You have the main character, a pregnant teenager (her reasoning behind getting pregnant is hillarious!).  Her boyfriend who is desperate need of saving in most of the characters eyes.  Her mother whos constantly changing her hair color or something else to regain her youth.  A Jew.  A cripple who doesnt really consider himself a Christian.  The new kid in school who just happens to be the principals son. An uber Christian whos a bit crazy really, and her two hang ons.  Gee i think i got everybody...

The point is, youd think this many characters would make it hard to develop most of them well.  But somehow they do.  Each character is unique and has their own story to tell, which does get told.  The basic story is personal faith versus public faith.  What each person thinks is right and how the Christian public says they're right or wrong.  Everyone ends up going through thier own personal revelations as their beliefs get pushed and shoved.

A very thought provoking movie.  Devout Christians, if they can get past the farce this movie makes of people who just blindly believe what is hand fed to them, probably will have trouble with the last part.  ###Basically one of the stands the film makes is that Jesus loves gay people too, so that would be hard for many people to swallow.###

Even those who ARE devout in their faith should check this movie out.  Might have you rethinking a thing or two.",1100649600,2,1574,4.63768115942029
2112952,5,B0002OXRSG,"When I put this DVD in and the first couple minutes of the movie began to play, my younger sister started to freak out-- she didn't want to watch a movie about ""Bible-thumpers,"" she said, ""They freak me out."" She managed to watch anyway and saw the light. This is a great movie. Plain and simple. This is a GREAT MOVIE!!

With an all-star cast including Jena Malone, Mandy Moore, and Macauley Culkin, you really can't go wrong. The movie is about good girl Mary (Malone) who is a sweet Christian girl attending the perfect Christian high school. She also has the perfect Christian boyfriend. One day, she and her boyfriend are playing a game in the pool where you go under water and tell secrets to each other. Guess what his is. He's gay. She's shocked, to say the least, and on her way back up to the surface, she hits her head on the ladder and gets a vision from Jesus-- she must do whatever possible to rid him of his problem. And she ends up pregnant.

This movie is so brilliant and funny that even when I watch it now (I've seen it at least 10 times now) I still laugh out loud. With an awesome cast (Malone, Moore, Culkin... and also Patrick Fugit and Eva Amurri!) and a great script, this is one of the best films I've seen all year!

2112953,4,B0002OXRSG,"""Saved"" is not a masterpiece but it is entertaining and the actors do a good job in their roles and the film gets its point across with a few laughs along the way.  When I first heard of this movie I also heard that a lot of christian groups were protesting it.  The movie is just trying to make a point that sometimes people are so involved in their religion that they can't look past it.  In fact the main character at the end of the movie does find faith in God and the possibilities of miracles.  The one thing that bothered me about the movie was the subplot with the pastor.  I wish they used his character(and the other character in his story) to show that to be christian doesn't mean that someone has to be a hypocrite and a bigot.  I think if they changed this one part of the movie many people who were offended by the portrayal of Mandy MOore's ""good"" christian character would have been less so.",1100476800,,908,4.25

2112955,4,B0002OXRSG,"I must admit, when I saw ""Saved!"" in the theaters, I wasn't that impressed.  It was amusing, yes, but it just didn't slay me the way great comedies do.  But something about it stuck with me, so I bought it when it became available on DVD and have begun watching it regularly.  With each successive viewing it gets funnier and funnier until I now find myself quoting dialog and cracking up before things even happen.  I'm now convinced ""Saved!"" is one of the best films of 2004.

A wicked satire of born-again Christianity, or the surface-level, shallow version that is so popular nowadays, ""Saved!"" centers on young Mary (Jena Malone), who became born-again at age 3 and attends a Christian high school run by a hipster named Pastor Skip (Martin Donovan).  Mary belongs to a clique called the ""Christian Jewels,"" led by the wicked Hilary Faye (Mandy Moore), a pampered princess who uses her religion as a source of power she wields over one and all, especially her wheelchair-bound brother Roland (McCauley Culkin).  Hilary Faye's chief rival is the school's rebel, and token ""Jewish,"" Cassandra (Susan Sarandon's beautiful daughter Eva Amurri), who delights in tormenting Hilary Faye by being a rude, crude and foul-mouthed chain-smoker.  Rounding out the cast is Mary's mother (Mary Louise Parker), who recently was named the region's top ""Christian Interior Decorator,"" and Pastor Skip's easygoing son Patrick (Patrick Fugit), who just returned from a missionary trip with other Christian ""Skateboarders for Christ.""  Oh, yes, and then there's Mary's boyfriend Dean (Chad Faust), who sets the plot in motion by telling Mary he's gay.  When Mary decides to ""cure"" Dean by seducing him, disaster strikes:  Dean is whisked away to a rehabilitation clinic called Mercy House (after his parents find his stash of gay skin magazines) and Mary ends up pregnant, which causes her to lose her faith and question Hilary Faye's sincerity as a Christian when Hilary Faye (against Mary's wishes) organizes a prayer vigil for Dean.  (Hilary Faye to Mary:  ""You're born again, not born a gay."")  The two friends then have a serious falling out and Mary is befriended by Cassandra, who has begun dating Roland.  She is also pursued by the amiable Patrick, who has a giant crush on her.  And then there's a subplot involving Mary's mother, who has begun dating Pastor Skip--

Buoyed by witty dialog and genuinely funny situations, ""Saved!"" is expertly directed by co-writer Brian Dannelly, who gets uniformly excellent performances from his young cast.  The obvious standout is Amurri.  She is hilarious as the crude and obnoxious Cassandra, who reveals a surprisingly tender side that belies her tough exterior.  In fact, she becomes a much better friend to Mary than Hilary Faye ever was.  Amurri even has the single funniest scene in the movie, in which she feigns ""speaking in tongues"" at a school assembly.  And Culkin, who bombed badly in his adult comeback film ""Party Monster,"" redeems himself with a very funny, wry performance that is immensely appealing.  Fugit is pitch-perfect as a kid of real faith who is also open and accepting of people who are different than he is, and Faust has a few funny moments as the hapless Dean, who is in Roland's words ""a one-man gay pride parade.""  Parker and Donovan perform with the effortless ease of old pros and Heather Mattarazzo (""Welcome to the Dollhouse"") is amusing as a ""Christian Jewels"" wannabe.

As for Mandy Moore, she is surprisingly good as the villain of the piece.  Hilary Faye is hypocritical, mean-spirited, judgmental, self-centered, loud and obnoxious, and seems to think being a Christian gives her a ticket to run roughshod over everyone around her.  (Her scene at a shooting range is a riot.)  Thankfully, Moore doesn't overplay this little gem of a role; in fact, I don't think she could have played it better.

And then there's Jena Malone, who is simply the best young actress working in films today.  Her Mary is a total delight, and she carries the film on her shoulders like an old pro.  She's going to be around a long, long time.

Some Christians will undoubtedly be offended by ""Saved!,"" and that's too bad, because it's not Christianity that's being satirized here, but hypocrisy and the tendency of today's Christian crowd to use their religion as a weapon against others instead of using it to make the world a better, more peaceful and loving place.  But then again, if someone is offended, then the truth must hurt.

""Saved!"" is presented in a widescreen, 1:85:1 print from MGM/UA home video that offers the following extras:  bloopers, extra scenes, a standard behind-the-scenes featurette that was undoubtedly the same promotional feature sent to theater owners, and trailers.  The bloopers are lame, the extra scenes add nothing (which is undoubtedly why they were cut) and the featurette is as vacuous as anything you'll see on Entertainment Tonight.  So count me among the unimpressed.  The verdict:  feature rates a ****1/2 (out of *****) while the extras get a yawn and **.",1100304000,7,5052,4.976162097735399

All I have to say is it's not so nice when the shoe is on the other foot is it?

As a child I was Christian until I turned 15, then I started thinking for myself. I think anyone who has found their way out of that mess called Christianity will find this movie a real side splitter, as I did. The ending was the best. A very positive movie about loving and accepting people for who they are and not using a religion to promote hate and intolerance. It's a shame christians can't see the same thing.

Summary - Mary thinks that her senior year will be great: she has a great boyfriend, good friends, and she is a perfect Christian in her eyes. However, that all changes when her boyfriend tells her he is gay. In order to try and 'save' him, they sleep together, the result being that Mary get pregnant. Knowing that none of her religious friends can help her, she turns to the outcasts of the school for help.

Trust me, its much better than it sounds. I loved how the writers made the good characters bad and the bad characters good. Mandy Moore has a refreshing and working role after her terrible part in 'Chasing Liberty'. That was a waste of her talents.

The only reason this did not get four stars is that I think it could have been a little funnier. Also, I wish they had focused more on Mary's pregnancy. I think the time flew a little too fast. But other than that, this movie was great.

First of all, the cast was great. I have loved Patrick Fugit ever since he played in Almost Famous. Cassandra, who was played by Susan Sarandon's daughter, was the perfect hedonist with a heart of gold. Jenna Malone was wonderful as usual, but I will admit that the best part was played by Mandy Moore. Who knew that she could act?

The movie is focused on many Christian teenagers going to a Christian school where everything seems perfect at the heart of it. Turns out that Hilary Faye becomes pregnant by her gay boyfriend, and all hell breaks loose!

Though I think there could have been a better ending (not so ""Hollywood,"" and a couple of the characters' personalities could have been a little more consistent,) I was glued to the screen all of the way through. Even though it was not laugh out loud funny, there were several lines that amused me.

The soundtrack is excellent, (Replacements songs are performed by a ""Christian rock band) the Travis song at the end was awesome, and if you watch until the credits, you will hear Mandy Moore cover the Beach Boys, ""God Only Knows.""

2112959,4,B0002OXRSG,"I remember nearly not going to see this movie when it opened, albeit too briefly, this summer because one critic said that it lacked ""the wit of 'Mean Girls'"", a movie that in my opinion had little to no wit. But I went anyway, and to say that I thought ""Saved!"" was one of the best teen movies since the John Hughes heyday of the mid-eighties is an understatement.
If you have never gone to a Chrisitan school, then many of the jokes in ""Saved!"" will probably fall flat to you. But first time director Brian Dannelly, directing from a script he co-wrote, balances the films satrical elements perfectly with some of the good old sticky-sappy conventions that its pretty easy to like this movie.
The story centers around Mary(Jena Malone), a devout born again Christian who believes she see's Jesus in a pool and tells her to sleep with her [...] boyfriend. And wouldn't you know that she gets pregnant.
The film balances a group of excellent supporting charactors, led by Mandy Moore, who makes for a surprising good villian and proves her acting talents pretty well, and Maculaly Culkin, who has comic timing that Billy Wilder and Preston Sturgess would've gladly tipped their hats too.
The film was slightly controversial upon its release, but this film doesn't make fun of Christians. It points out how some Chrisitans use the Bible for their own justification. This movie is never as mean, callous or redundently stupid as, oh, say ""Mean Girls"".
The movies has a few flaws, like the deep dark secret Moore's Hilary Faye has hidden away, which is a pretty sad excuse for friction amongst the characters, and the end lacks the wit and satire of the first ninty five percent of the movie, content on being just another typical Hollywood teen movie.
But who cares? Most movies aren't as smart as ""Saved!"", and most teen movies don't have one tenth of the humor that this movie has. For that alone, ""Saved!"" is worth a rental.",1099872000,4,1925,4.6982248520710055
2112960,2,B0002OXRSG,"The director Donnelly tries too hard to cram every white Christian suburb cliche (""Jesus is your CEO,"" cries the pastor at the school assembly) in the first act of this film, which really wants to be a remake of the 1999 masterpiece Election. It takes many elements from Payne's 1999 masterpiece, an ambitious, ego-driven blonde wannabe Queen Bee high school girl who frames her enemies while claiming to love the Lord; a variety of misfits who pray in monologues (also taken from Election) for less than Christian requests; immature parents trying to relive their youth. But Saved is no Election. For one the characters are paper thin. For two, the director, unlike Payne, preaches a tolerant morality whereas Payne doesn't preach at all. In Election he just shows life's problems as they are. Worst of all, by the second and third act, Saved turns into a teeny bopper heart-throb film and looks like a made-for-TV debacle. If you want to see the pains of growing up in high school and dead-on satire, do yourself a favor and see Election instead.",1099872000,4,1048,4.8277777777777775

You reviewers are taking it too seriously. It's a fun movie for teens, it's not supposed to be some ground breaking religious movie.

2112962,4,B0002OXRSG,"The flaw in ""Saved!"" is that in the end Brian Dannelly's film wants to argue that the problem with evangelical Christians is that of hypocrisy. It does not matter that this hypocrisy is embodied by a single character in the film, the holier than thou, Hilary Faye (Mandy Moore), because it is clear Dannelly is going after all such true believers. But Hilary Faye's problem is not that she is Christian; what is wrong with her is that she is another teenage girl, the Queen Bee of her particular hornets nest, who loves to lord it over everyone in her domain. As far as Hilary Faye is concerned, Jesus is just another club that she can wield in exerting her will at the Christian school they attend (Yes, the minister in the movie is also something of a hypocrite, but for the most part the adults in this film are like those in a ""Peanuts"" cartoon, just making noise while the small fry have it out).

Fortunately, where ""Saved!"" is different from other films in the ""Mean Girls"" tradition is that while Hilary Faye veers off into caricature despite Moore's captivating performance, the rest of the cast consists of some of the more realistic characters in this type of film. The focal point of the movie is Mary (Jenna Malone), who we meet at the bottom of the local swimming pool where she and her boyfriend, Dean (Chad Faust), are exchanging secrets underwater. However, Mary was not expecting Dean to announce that he thinks he is gay. Because of a bang on the head Mary has a vision of Jesus and becomes convinced that what he wants is for her to save Dean, which she can do by having sex with him, at which point he will realize that he is not gay, and as a reward Jesus will restore her virginity. This hypothesis becomes moot when Mary becomes pregnant and Dean is sent off to a place where he can be deprogrammed into being straight.

Mary is fated to be an outcast because of her pregnancy, so she gets a head start on her fate by becoming friends with those already ostracized, courtesy of Hilary Faye. That includes Cassandra (Eva Amurri), the only Jewish girl at the school, Roland (Macaulay Culkin), Hilary Faye's wheelchair bound brother), and Patrick (Patrick Fugit), the skateboarding son of the school's principal, Pastor Skip (Martin Donovan). Although Cassandra and Roland have their over the top moments, especially in regards to Hilary Faye and her small circle of friends, the relationships that spring up between these characters seem a lot more realistic than we usually see in movies about teenagers. Of course the big joke is that they are not fanatical Christians like the rest of the kids in school (which does not mean that they might not be better Christians, although that is something everyone who watches this movie can decide for themselves).

It is not like this film is subtle about making its points: the main character's name is Mary.  There are some shades of gray here, but the battle lines in ""Saved!"" are drawn in such black and white terms early on that you might not notice there are such shadings to be seen.  When Hilary Faye and her disciples try to exorcise Mary back into the fold I see it as a statement of the weird way teenagers think and not as a reason to castigate religious belief.  The more ""Saved!"" wants to be about religion, the more I end up reading it as being more of a traditional teenage film, which is why the standout characters end up being the teenage boys more than the girls because for once they are not the total jerks that teenager boys invariable tend to be in this genre.",1099526400,5,3549,4.581102362204724

It deals with teen pregnacy, homosexuality, and passing judgement of others.  These kids however, do want to do the next right thing.  Like real kids its not always clear what it is.

2112966,4,B0002OXRSG,"Saved is very funny satire/comedy-drama on whacked-out Christian fundamentalists.

Basically at a Christian High-School (which is about as narrow-minded, hypocritical and contradicting as my own was) there is this clique of girls called the 'Christian Jewels', which are not to dissimilar from 'The Plastics' in Mean Girls. Every girl wants to be a part of the Jewels, including geeky, desperate Tia (Heather Matarazazazazazo rehashing her role from Welcome to the Dollhouse). I would find her attractive if she hadn't dyed her hair an unconvincing blonde. Too bad she's er...married.

After earning her way into this clique Mary (Jena Malone) is devastated when her boyfriend confesses his massive gayness. Eager to 'cure' him of this ungodly condition Mary offers up her virginity to him, only to get pregnant. Obviously this bun in the over secret threatens to tear everyone's flimsy little world apart.

Hilary Faye, the leader of the Christian Jewels is appalled at Mary's sudden lack of faith and makes it her mission to save her, whatever the method or cost. Obviously Mary doesn't appreciate this and it only drives her to further isolation.

Saved is superior to Mean Girls in terms of relevance and wit. Though I'm afraid the target audience will no doubt pass this over in favor for Miss Lohan as discussion of God and the lack of pink will fail to attract as young an audience.

The acting is great. Jena Malone is more of an actress than Lohan/Duff, Macaulay Culkin was effective as the wheelchair-bound Roland, Mandy Moore is so innocently evil as Hilary Faye she makes Regina George look timid and Eva Amurri is like so totally gorgeous! Seriously! Wow! Too bad she smokes. NEXT!

I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Saved to anyone. It's funny and clever and outdoes all 'teen-comedies' by transcending the genre. A rarity indeed.",1099180800,12,1843,5.046052631578948

I liked the sense of humor, and the (mostly) naturalistic cinematography and casting -- the girls from ""Mean Girls"" would look like aliens here. The kids all looked and acted like kids -- even Mandy Moore had a fairly bad haircut by the standards of movie teenagers -- although it slipped once or twice (the dialogue about the clinic on the Vespa didn't sound like kids, but rather a Morale dropped in by the writer).

I didn't go to a religious school myself (although my mother went to a Catholic school about which I've heard a great deal), so I can't speak to how spot-on the characterizations of the students and teachers is, but my city is VERY religious (40+ churches in a town of 70k), and I was certainly nodding in recognition quite a bit at some of the personality types. The humor wasn't necessarily AT the Christian community -- or, if it was, it was the sort of humor of someone laughing at themselves.

And, of course, one of the all-time greatest scenes in a movie is Mandy Moore flinging a Bible at another girl, screeching ""I am FILLED with Jesus' love!""

Good stuff.",1098748800,3,1127,4.536945812807882
2112969,5,B0002OXRSG,"This gentle and very funny satire is the most positively Christian movie I have seen in years. This movie restored my faith and my sense of humor.

  Mary (Jena Malone) belongs to the ""Christian Jewels"" led by Hillary Faye (Mandy Moore); a high school girl gang for Jesus. But, even though the ""Jewels"" mimic Christian ritual on the surface of their lives, they are not Christians in their hearts. Their hypocrisy is the source of much of the movie's comedy, but this hypocrisy is never confused with real Christianity.

  Mary discovers that her boyfriend, Dean (Chad Faust) is gay. She believes that Jesus wants her to ""cure"" Dean, so she has sex with him. However, Dean is still gay and sent away to ""Mercy House"" and Mary discovers she is pregnant.

  Enter Cassandra (Eve Amurri) and Roland (Macaulay Culkin) into Mary's life. Cassandra is the school's lone Jewish attendee. She is a hell raiser hoyden and her clashes with Hillary Faye are the pivot around which much of the comedy revolves. She is also a wise and loving human being. Roland is Hilary Faye's much-abused brother. He is irreverent, puckish, and wheelchair bound.

  The comedy is fantastic. The scene where Roland is dancing in his wheelchair in the Mall only lasts several seconds, but I will never forget it. Cassandra speaks in tongues, but it is not the message her classmates want to hear--well, not the sort of message ALL her classmates want to hear.

  These two ""outcasts"" find each other and nurture Mary through her pregancy. Principal Skip's son, Patrick (Patrick Fugit) falls in love with Mary. Dean, with his male partner, escapes from ""Mercy House"" to attend the school Prom. Dean is overjoyed to discover he is about to become a father. Add Mary's mother Lillian (Mary-Louise Parker) to this family mix, and Mary and her child become the center of a loving and supportive human circle. It is Mary, from her maternity hospital bed, who admits that she doesn't always know what Jesus wants, but she'll keep trying to figure it out.

  The movie's point, underneath the mischievous and witty comedy, is about the importance of love. Love is the most powerful lesson Jesus taught, and it is sometimes the hardest to understand, which this movie so brilliantly and comically demonstrates.",1098662400,3,2271,4.869791666666667

Further complicating things are Hillary Faye (Mandy Moore), a snobby, stereotypical hypocrite who is the leader of the Christian Jewels, an exclusive ""glee club for Jesus"", Pastor Skip (Martin Donovan), and his son, Patrick (Patrick Fugit), who is enamored with Mary.

Filled with symbolism, such as Mary's red dress at prom, and a bus advertisement reading ""imagine"", this movie takes all that is wrong with the born again set and throws it at us full force, unapologetically, and in a uniquely hilarious manner.

Mandy Moore, pop princess, suprised me with her catty performance, as I had never actually seen her act before this. She was great! Eva Amurri, the one Jew in their school that plays the ""bad girl"", steals the show, however, and McCauly Culkin, as Hillary Faye's wheel chair bound brother, Roland, is outstanding enough to make me forget the taint of ""Home Alone"".

Not since ""Dogma"" has there been a movie that so openly portrays the very real hypocrisy and intolerance of the Christian Right. In the end, and without giving it all away, we learn the true value of morality and the Christian spirit, and it is not wrapped up in living a life of false perfection.",1098662400,3,1390,4.8277310924369745

Instead, I found it to be a fairly straightforward teen comedy (albeit a clever and well-acted one). Although funny and well-written, the script tends to play it a little too safe, keeping the film from living up to its potential. However, the film is redeemed by the terrific, talented cast. The young actors flesh out their characters well, making them funny, deeply flawed and endearing. Mandy Moore is surprisingly great playing ruthless, holier-than-thou Hilary Faye, Eva Amurri (Susan Sarandon's daughter) is adorable playing good-hearted rebel Cassandra, and MacCaulay Culkin is snide and mischievious as Hilary Faye's wheelchair-bound brother Roland. The script does poke plenty of fun at the Christian church's youth ministries, and I can say from my personal experience (I went to church every week till I was 17 and attended plenty of Christian youth events) that it portrays the scene fairly accurately. However, for the most part, the film never really pushes the envelope too far. It almost seems as though the creators were holding back, afraid of offending people or seeming disrespectful. It's too bad. With such a talented cast, a less play-it-safe script may have turned this film into a classic like ""Heathers"".",1098403200,3,1387,5.1415929203539825
2112974,5,B0002OXRSG,"From all appearances, Mary is the epitome of the perfect Christian girl. She attends a Baptist high school; she sings in a Christian girl band (the Christian Jewels) with her friends, the snotty, holier-than-thou Hillary Faye and her ever-present sidekick Veronica; and she keeps a photo of her cute Christian boyfriend Dean in a ""True Love Waits"" picture frame. Mary's world comes crashing down one summer day in the backyard pool when Dean confesses that he thinks he might be gay. In her shock, Mary bangs her head and sinks to the bottom of the pool, prompting the nearby long-haired, bearded pool boy to dive to the rescue. While stunned, Mary ""sees"" a vision of Jesus swimming towards her. He tells her it is her responsibility save Dean. Confused and concerned for her boyfriend's soul, Mary decides that means having sex with him to turn him straight.

The next thing she knows, Dean's parents have shipped him off to a ""degayification"" center and Mary finds herself pregnant. She tries to keep her pregnancy a secret, but news of Dean's homosexuality spreads like wildfire through the school thanks to Hillary Faye's insidious prayer group meeting for Dean's soul. Between hiding her secret and her anger at Hillary Faye's hypocrisy, Mary finds herself ostracized by those she thought were her friends. She finds support from unexpected sources, however--the school misfits: Cassandra, the lone Jew who gleefully rebels against everything Christian, and Roland, Hillary Faye's wheelchair-bound brother. The three outcasts band together, but Hillary Faye isn't finished with them yet.

The movie is quality from start to finish. The script is sharp and deliciously witty, the direction is pitch-perfect, and the acting is top-notch. Jena Malone as Mary perfectly captures the navet, confusion, and anger of a young girl caught in the whirlwind of a crisis of faith. Mandy Moore proves once again that she is a force to be reckoned with, playing Hillary Faye with a ruthless intensity. Macaulay Culkin as Roland steals his scenes with some of the movies best lines and sight gags. In fact, every actor in this movie brings a resonance of sincerity and believability to their characters, from Mary-Louise Parker as Mary's single mother, to Eva Amurri (Susan Sarandon's daughter) as Cassandra, to Heather Matarazzo as Tia, Mary's replacement in Hillary Faye's clique.

Compared to the rest of the movie, I thought the ending was a little weak--sugary sweet and a little too pat--but the strong message comes through loud and clear anyway. It's a message of acceptance and finding your true family in unexpected places.

Some people have seen Saved! as mean-spirited towards the Christian community, but I think those people are missing the true intention of the film. Having come from the world depicted in the movie, I can attest that there is no exaggeration involved. The movie is honest--brutally so at times--but never sinks to the level of simply making fun of Christians. If anything, I think it shows the struggle we all have in reconciling what our religion and our heart tells us--something that is all too often two different messages--and illustrates the true spirit of Christianity. The real theme of this movie is celebrating diversity, something I think we could all use a little more of. I loved this movie and can't recommend it enough.",1098230400,3,3358,5.066907775768535

I tend to like movies about high school when they bring back memories of my own teen years, and this movie is very remniscent of the atmosphere at my high school.  The pressure on students to conform to a specific interpretation of Christianity is very familiar, and - in a very satisfying way - ""SAVED!"" takes this issue and runs with it.  The movie is clever, funny, and for me, quite cathartic.

The acting is outstanding.  My favorite performances are not from the two lead actresses - even though they are both great.  I like Eva Amurri (Susan Sarandon's real-life daughter)best. She plays the lone Jewish classmate that everyone wants to ""save"".  The scene where she is pretending to speak in tongues is worth the price of the DVD.  Macaulay Culkin does a very convincing job playing a free thinker who doesn't accept the company line.  Hopefully, for Macaulay this is a successful step back into starring movie roles.  Finally, I adored (sublimely sexy) Patrick Fugit (from ""Almost Famous"") because of the way his character balances the whole movie.  His love is pointedly pure and free of judgement.

My bottom line for this movie....  If you like coming of age comedies, and you are not a very sensitive member of the religious right, you will like it.  If you have been a victim of overzealous evangelicals, you will love it.

2112983,4,B0002OXRSG,"""Saved!"" is a black comedy, coming of age tale, and a morality play set, fittingly, at a Christian high school, where righteousness and irony abound. Mary (Jena Malone) is a devout young woman who tries in good faith to cure her gay boyfriend by sleeping with him. As her senior year begins, she finds herself pregnant and questioning the values that she once thought indisputable, which puts her at odds with her old friends. Hilary Faye (Mandy Moore), the prettiest, most popular, and most self-righteous girl in school, makes it her mission to save Mary's soul. As everyone strives to find his or her place and decide what he believes, the principal's accepting son (Patrick Fugit) courts Mary, and Hilary Faye's cynical wheelchair-bound brother Roland (Macaulay Culkin) finds a  kindred spirit in the school rebel, Cassandra (Eva Amurri).

The first half-hour of ""Saved!"" is fantastic. The actors' straight delivery of their ardent  dialogue is priceless. This is some of the most brilliant black comedy that I've seen. Unfortunately, the movie then kicks into conventional morality play mode. It becomes extremely predictable. It's a lost opportunity, but I have to say that the characters continue to be interesting to watch, and the story is charming. They become clichs, but they are three-dimensional clichs. The cast embodies them perfectly. Mandy Moore seems to have a lot of fun with her self-possessed but vicious villainess, Hilary Faye. She's the kind of character that audiences love to hate, and Moore eggs us on. She even sings in the movie and on the soundtrack. Mary Louise Parker and Martin Donovan play caring, well-intentioned parents who tend to do the wrong thing when they are at a loss for what to do. And Eva Amurri makes quite an impression as Cassandra, the school's outsider and general thorn in its side. This is the second role in which Amurri's comic gestures have hilariously defined her character. The first was in ""The Banger Sisters"", where she played daughter to her real-life mother, Susan Sarandon. Physical comedy is very much her fort, and I expect she will be a  successful comic actress.

Morality is a little muddled at times, as the rogue students who have our sympathies are occasionally as mean-spirited as their detractors are self-righteous. I wish writers Brian Dannelly and Michael Urban hadn't abandoned irony in favor of hypocrisy as a theme. Obviously zealotry is hypocritical and immoral, but that's not interesting. I preferred the tone of the first third of the movie, but even so, ""Saved!"" is entertaining and has a great coming-of-age cast. Whether Christians will like the film or take offense probably depends on whether they are the type of Christians the film is lampooning. Mainline Christians may find ""Saved!"" quite funny.

The DVD: Bonus features include 2 audio commentaries, one featurette, 11 deleted and extended scenes, 4 bloopers, a theatrical trailer, and 6 ""Saved Revelations"", which are glimpses of what we didn't see in some scenes, such as what Mary was looking at when she slammed her laptop shut. Better not to know, actually. The ""Heaven Help Us"" featurette is a fun 4-minute montage of movie clips and interviews with the cast and crew. The first audio commentary is by writer/director Brian Dannelly, co-writer Michael Urban, and co-producer Sandy Stern. They discuss how they shot the film, remarkably,  in 28 days with less than $5 million, commenting on locations, filming, and story. In the second audio commentary, actresses Jena Malone and Mandy Moore talk about their experiences in making the film. Both audio commentaries are reasonably entertaining. Low and no-budget filmmakers may find the first commentary especially interesting. Subtitles are available for the film in English, Spanish, and French.",1097798400,9,3797,5.154220779220779
2112984,5,B0002OXRSG,"A film by Brian Dannelly

The movie ""Saved!"" is a potentially controversial movie that just sort of slipped under the radar when it was released in theatres.  At first glance, and without putting any thought into what the movie is actually saying, it would seem that ""Saved!"" is absolutely savaging the Christian community.  The Christians in the film come off as hypocritical fools (at best) and the sympathetic characters are those with anti-Christian behaviors.  But that is only the candy coating on ""Saved!""  The heart of the picture has to do with a portion of the Christian sub-culture which shows a public veneer of popular Christianity but has none of the heart or the message of what Christ taught.  That is what ""Saved!"" is truly lampooning.

Mary (Jena Malone) is a senior at a very Christian high school in a very Christian town.  Everything in her world is protected by the ""Christian"" label, from the music she listens to the Christian home decorators, and so on.  The only thing that does not fit into her Christian world is her boyfriend Dean (Chad Faust), who has recently come out to her that he is gay.  Since this is an affront to everything she knows and believes in, and she knows that God does not want him to be gay, Mary believes that Jesus wants her to sleep with him to de-gayify Chad.  She does, and it doesn't.  He is sent away to Mercy House, which is intended to get him the ""help he needs"".  What comes out of this first encounter is that Mary becomes pregnant.

She does not know this at first, of course, so Mary slides into her life in high school where she is friends with the uber-Christian Hillary Faye (Mandy Moore).  Hillary Faye is over the top Christian, but filled with bitterness which she takes out on her brother, Roland (Macaulay Culkin).  Roland has been crippled since childhood and is wheelchair bound.  When the Jewish Cassandra (Eva Amurri) begins school as the only Jew in the Christian high school, Hillary Faye makes it her personal mission to aggressively ""save"" Cassandra's soul.

Initially, Cassandra is the outcast in Mary's eyes but as her pregnancy becomes more pronounced she becomes closer to Cassandra because Cassandra is the only person who would not judge Mary.  Funny how that works.  As the movie continues we see the conflict between Hillary Faye, who has turned her back on Mary when Mary questions her attitude, and the outcasts (Mary, Roland, Cassandra).  The movie builds, showing Hillary Faye's behavior to be increasingly anti-Christian with perhaps the film's signature scene having Hillary Faye angrily yell ""I am filled with Christ's love"" as she throws a Bible at Mary's back.  Mary had questioned whether Hillary Faye knew what love was.

The ending of ""Saved!"" is somewhat over the top, but the portrayal of the Christian sub-culture is only somewhat exaggerated.  Having gone to a Christian college I know that the characters in ""Saved!"" are distorted portrayals of actual people.  The movie exaggerates the behavior, but these are very familiar situations and images and lines of dialogue to me.  But, that is what this film is discussing, and perhaps exposing.  The fakeness that some people can have when the cling so hard to the image of what a ""good Christian"" looks like that they lose sight of what it truly means to be a Christian and about the love that is central to the message of Christ.

""Saved!"" is a movie that has a lot of heart and hopefully will find a home and a following on DVD.  This is a smartly written and well acted movie (especially Mandy Moore and Macaulay Culkin), and one that is worth seeing.

2112986,5,B0002OXRSG,"""Saved"" is recieving some harsh criticism, saying that it's awful to satirize Christianity. And I agree with the fact that sometimes there's a thin line where far is TOO far, but I feel that ""Saved"" is an excellent, smart parody that really has nothing to do with Christianity.

Yes, the plot takes place within the Born-Again Christian community, and I am able to laugh about the isms that the ""Jesus Freak"" people have, simply because I have been raised in a Catholic/Private school environment for more than twelve years of my life. I know what it's like, and I think that it's funny how it's portrayed.

But set that aside, we're not here to talk about Christianity, or ""Saved"" being anti-Christian.

In all honesty, the film truly speaks about tolerance, and not religion. Who are the protagonists of the film? The outcasts: the paraplegic, the pregnant teen, the Jewish girl. What is the film criticizing? How people treat those who are ""different."" And the easiest target is the ultra-conservative, hypocritical Christian population. It just fits wonderfully. Besides, what does Jesus teach anyway? Love your neighbor as yourself?

Also, the performances given by all of the actors are top-notch. It was definitely a smart choice on everyone's part to be involved with this film.

Overall, I give ""Saved"" five stars, because it deserves it, and because it's an excellent SATIRE with real meaning behind it.",1097625600,6,1413,5.021367521367521

2112988,5,B0002OXRSG,"I really did want to see this from the moment I first saw the previews, and it did not disappoint. Satire surprisingly takes a back seat to warm, gushy moments that are actually touching. The plot as a whole is a success, and the actors have much to be proud of.

Malone, although she looks 12, is perfectly cast as the lost Christian girl that is seemingly abandoned by God and looking for her way. Also, Moore is perfect in this snotty role as Hilary Faye, that is somewhat reminiscent of her debut in _The Princess Diaries_ ,  a delightful addition to the cast. Best of all, however, is Eva. She is simply divine and hilarious in her role as the outcast Jew that falls for Faye's brother (Culkin, not bad).

2112989,3,B0002OXRSG,"Can you imagine creating this film about Islam?  Basically this film is an overt attack on a religious belief system held by millions.  While it is likely that there are those of all faiths who are hypocritical and miss the point for the dogma, this kind of over the top attack to misrepresent the values of Christianity is uncalled for.

The film is well produced and acted, and there are some good moments.  Those who have reviewed the film and applauded the message either do not understand the message or are in fact themselves missing the point.  Let me explain.  How Christianity is portrayed throughout this film is clearly not in line with that belief system, however the ""new age"" spirituality that the film tries to replace it with is clearly bankrupt and the kind of pablum Hollywood loves to trot out.

A great film would have held up Christian values as they truly are, while exposing some of the misguided social and cultural issues American evangelicalism is often unfortunately known for.  This film fails on both accounts though, by first being unfair and biased, and second never acknowledging any of the true Gospel message.  Typical of Hollywood, they failed to make a great film, in place of an OK film with a poor message.

Further, Hollywood is far too PC to create a film like this about other religions.  It is part of the liberal double standard in this country.",1097452800,6,1388,4.717842323651452

I rented this movie not knowing what in the heck it was about and I am sure glad I did because it made me think about how so many people try to live the perfect lives and some times things just don't work out how you plan them...It is the only part that Mandy Moore has played that I did not like...she is a bit annoying in this movie...but the other people are great!,1097452800,2,585,4.051724137931035
2112991,4,B0002OXRSG,"i absolutely love this movie.  reason being because there is a movie out there that finally tells the truth about the extreme religious movement that exists in america right now.  the setting takes place in a christian high school, which in actuality looks and acts like any other high school i have ever encountered.  the movie kicks off with a young man coming out to his girlfriend and in turn gives up her virginity to ""cure"" him.  of course the whole thing backfires on her and then forces her to question everything she has so blindly followed to begin with. her boyfriend ends up at a place called mercy house, a place that offers a cure for those afflicted with homosexuality, drug or alcohol abuse, and unwed mothers.  one of the great lines of the movie come when patrick fugit tells jena malone that mercy house really isn't for the people that are sent there rather it is for the people who do the sending.  how true is that statement.  if you send away the problem then the problem no longer exists, and then the place that they are sent to makes people hate themselves and be someone who they truly are not.  mandy moore is also in this movie as the leader of this school.  in the end she is revealed to be the hypocrite most of these bible beaters actually are.  she lies in front of her whole school and exacts revenge on those who have wronged her, and i mean really is that what jesus would do.  this movie really exposes the dichotomy of religion.  there are so many people that feel that religion is only black and white, and anything that falls in between just does not compute.  in the event that something does not compute or falls in the grey area, then it must be cast out or sent away because it does not fall into such narrow minds.  everyone should watch this movie because it offers up an opportunity to see that people are free to believe whatever they want and have the free will to live a life that they see fit rather than a life confined my ideas that are not their own.  thank you for finally making a movie that reveals the truth about the religious fanatics that are trying to take over the country.",1097193600,12,2136,4.385786802030457

2112993,1,B0002OXRSG,"If your view of fundamentalist/evangelical Christians coincides with the stereotypical bigoted views of the film's writers, you may think this film hits home big time.

The one valid point the film makes, that moralistic Christians should be forgiving of others' moral shortcomings -- because we all have large shortcomings -- is muddled because, in the end, the film's point of view is that pre-marital sex, adultery, homosexuality, are just part of the wonderful variety of God's creation, not moral failings at all.

But if you enjoy watching Evangelical Christians -- who believe that the Bible offers us clear statements about moral rights and wrongs -- take jibe after jibe, groin kick after groin kick, this is the perfect diversion for your evening. The character of Hillary Faye is the ""straw man"" set up to represent all judgmental, hypocritical, unloving Christians, who get their just desserts in the end. And after all, aren't all Bible-believing Christians judgmental, hypocritical, and unloving? So it would seem. Sad that the authors never got to know the real subjects of their ridicule.

The writers of this film wield satire as a blunt weapon. If they intend to score any valid points against fundamentalists, they'll have to be cleverer than this.",1097193600,13,1267,5.170731707317073
2112994,5,B0002OXRSG,"""Saved!"" is funny, heart-warming, thoughtful and a pure delight to watch.

Some have obviously thought that this film pokes fun at Christianity.  It doesn't.  What it pokes fun at are those people who have taken it upon themselves to turn Christianity into a man-made rat's maze that human beings are supposed to run through in order to get a piece of cheese while avoiding being eaten by the cat.

Fortunately, ""Saved!"" reminds people that Christianity can be -- and perhaps was even intended to be -- more than a one-way labyrinth in some cosmic Behavioural Psychology experiment.  And that human beings are ultimately far more complex, wonderful and lovable than laboratory rats.  In the end, I think ""Saved!"" hints at what ""salvation"" definitely isn't while gently suggesting what it just might be.",1097193600,5,802,5.037878787878788
2112995,2,B0002OXRSG,"Saved! was a common case of coming in way too strong and using all the good material first, only to allow an ending that seemed like it could fit into any other simplistic teenie-bopper film.  Let me explain.  When I first started watching this film, I was impressed.  I was laughing at the characters, the story, the themes; I was enjoying the brief flashback into my youth as a student at a Catholic school.  I remembered students like the ones portrayed in this film.  I was ready for it all.  I had heard so much about this film, that with the stunningly powerful and humorous beginning, I knew it was going to be an instant favorite.  I was wrong.  About thirty minutes into this film, when Mary starts finding an interest in an oddly developed love interest (Patrick Fugit), I began to see the beginnings of a normal, everyday love story.  Stories where those less fortunate come together to reek havoc over those that are ""too perfect"" or in this case ""too religious"".  Finally, in the end, everyone learns a lesson and we all go home happy ... like God would have wanted.

Where was the raw, dark humor in this film?  Again, the way it started out it could have easily been an interesting film, but then it just went so far down hill it was un-Save-able.  Perhaps it was the acting.  Mandy Moore was so over the top she overshadowed the other characters that we were to care for.  Whenever she was on screen, she seemed to be pushing the other characters to the side, creating a distraction instead of any character development.  Mac ... oh poor Mac, isn't it sad when your brother makes a better religious film than you do?  When was it a good idea to have him in this film?  Honestly, he mumbled through this film trying to give some emotion to his character, but instead acting like he didn't need the money he just wanted to be in front of the camera.  Jena Malone was decent, but just didn't ever seem to fit into her role.  At the Prom, when she was dancing pregnant, it really didn't seem like she was ""acting"" pregnant.  She didn't know how, and I think that was a flaw in her character.  The only other person we haven't talked about is Cassandra, who actually held her role pretty well.  The trouble that I had with her is that sometimes her lines seemed jumbled or cut off well too soon.  Her comment about the Christian surfboard team was funny, but for some strange reason was cut off too early on my DVD copy that I watched.  So, outside of a failing story, we have mediocre actors fighting their way through this film.

What else...?  The overall theme of this film was inconsistent.  I was having trouble with the way that Mary was acting compared to the way that her mother was acting, and overall comparing it to the way that Hilary Faye was acting.  Didn't they all have the same beliefs?  It seemed like they could turn these beliefs on and off with just a quick flick of a switch.  I never truly understood what Roland's feelings on religion were, and why he suddenly found an attraction with the ""rebel"" girl.  Didn't anyone else see this as a foregone conclusion?  They had to get together because they were two characters with ""disabilities"".  That nearly made me gag.  I also felt that the entire connection between Pastor Skip and Mary's mom was unnecessary.  I felt the director put that in this film for more of a dramatic element, but instead it just became an excess vegetable in this already spoiled bowl of soup.

I wanted to like this movie, I really did, but by the middle of the film you could already predict the rest of the movie.  It was clich filled to the very top.  I, having watched several movies in my lifetime, could predict everything that was going to happen before it happened.  Thus making this film predictable, instead of cultishly blasphemous.  There was nothing intelligent about this film, just sex jokes followed by debunked religious humor.  I was not impressed.  I expected to be laughing hysterically with the immense force of the wit and creativity, sadly that was not the case.  Instead, I just watched another Hollywood film that used semi-large stars to draw in the audiences that may not normally see this film.  This was very predictable and dull.  Skip it, or thy Lord with spite thee!

I've noticed lots of people saying that if this movie were about any other religion besides christianity people wouldn't stand for it.  ( ""People would riot if Islam was made fun of this way "" or ""I don't see any movies making fun of Judism."")  Do you know why people don't make funny movies about other religions? Because no other religion is so showy.
Worship shouldn't  be about making sure others see how religious you are.  Christianity is about Love not pageantry.

Set in a overly-religious Christian High School, Mary's pregnancy by a gay (and GORGEOUS) football player, leads her to befriend the black sheep of the school. Among its comedy, this movie teaches viewers not to judge others, and realize that no one's perfect. I give it 5 stars!",1097020800,4,497,4.595505617977528

All the actors and actresses do an amazing job of giving depth and personality to each of these characters that could have ended up becoming caricatures of themselves easily if given to say Jessica Simpson instead of Mandy Moore (for example). Maculey(sp?) Culkin gives an amazing performance that will hush all detractors after his debatable performance of playing a melodramatic queen in Party Monster. One of the best (and personally most surprising) aspects of this film is that it doesn't make fun of Christians it just shows us that they are all people to with the normal problems, temptations, and attitudes just like everyone else. Also the lead character played by Jena Malone really makes this movie as great as it is with an important and powerful performance. This is the best comedy of the year hands down.",1097020800,3,896,4.75
2113000,4,B0002OXRSG,"The only problem with ""Saved!"" is that it has a narrow audience who will actually GET the movie. If you didn't grow up in the Christian culture, the movie will fall flat. And of those who did grow up in that culture, many will be offended by the movie's portrayal.

As a Christian, I grew up in the church/youth group enviroment and went to a Christian highschool. Thankfully, my highschool was no where near that extreme, nor was it a bad experience. My youth group, however, has closer parallels to ""Saved!""

When you grow up, regardless of your faith, you are concerned with popularity and how others see you. Thus, the interests of the majority will dictate who the ""popular girls"" will be... those who most effectively use the majority's interests to their advantage. In my school, as it is with most, people were obsessed with sports. So the atheletic people were popular. In ""Saved!"" the school's interest was Jesus and Evangelism, so the people who were viewed as ""super christians"" became the popular ones.

There comes a point in sports where some people become so desperate to stay on top and in the spotlight that they resort to stooping to levels they would previously condemned. For instance, the Tonya Harding fiasco a number of years back when she ambushed a competitor, taking the competitor out of the competition.

""Saved!,"" while following Mary's story of mishearing God's voice, shows Hilary Fay's treck into the Tonya Harding state of mind... where she will do anything to stay popular, to stay on top of the social game.

While most of what happens is over-the-top (throwing a bible in ""love,"" Hilary Fay spray painting the school), a lot of the underlying aspects can be applied to many youth groups. It's not beyond the realm of possibility for a girl to feel that Jesus wants her to save a gay friend by having sex with him. I could totally see some of the girls from the youth group I went to trying to perform an exorcism on someone and having prayer meetings for a gay aquantence.

When people complain about how genuine faith isn't portrayed in this movie, I feel that they are looking over several key points. The most obvious is Patrick, the son of the pastor/princple/youth group leader, who just returned from a skate boarding mission trip. You can tell that he has a personal faith and belief in Jesus. He is a good character and believable. The other person, while almost a side character, is Mary's gay ex-boyfriend/father of her child. After getting sent to Mercy House he should be bitter and depressed. Instead, he says with a smile on his face, ""I know that Jesus Loves Me."" He says it in a way that you know he believes it and doesn't care what the other people think. He loves Jesus and knows that whatever the other Christians think, that Jesus loves him.

The element I liked best about ""Saved!"" is Cassandra, the Jewish girl. She, like most of the others, had her own sort of masks on, but her true self showed when she reached out to other people. While many may question the wisdom in helping Mary hide her pregnancy, she displayed a true sense of caring for other people that she usually tried to mask. She even opened up toward Hilary Fay in Fay's worst hour instead of saying ""she deserved it.""",1097020800,5,3245,4.642857142857143
2113001,5,B0002OXRSG,"I enjoyed the movie- I thought it presented the hypocrisy shown by too many christian fundamentalists in a clear and open way.

I particularly like Cassandra whose dry wit saves the movie from becoming a bomb. She reminds me of that chain-smoker from ""Romy & Michelle's High School Reunion""

That said, there isn't much chemistry between the actors, and it comes across more of a budget teen flick, albeit with teensy bit more bite.",1096848000,5,591,4.728155339805825
2113003,5,B0002OXRSG,"Saved is a treat, a surprise, and a treasure.  I can't remember how many times I've laughed out loud in a movie theater after seeing this film.

In an era of oppressive ""politial correctness"" comes a movie that spits in the face of all conservative conventions.  The film goes for broke and isn't ashamed or self-conscious of being a biting social satire.

This movie is really portraying a larger truth by satirizing a pedogogy and crippling fundamentalism that chooses to give any human being who isn't  a WASP no chance of hope in our society.

I'll be happy to show this to any pedophile Catholic Priest who abuses his power to the advances of innocent victims, usually young boys.  It shows the hypocrisy that has made fundamental Catholic religion what it is today.  There is a part of me that truly believes that a majority of people use religion the wrong way.  That way is to hurt, embarrass, shame, and use their powers to belittle people who don't necessary agree with their view points.  The film shows the suffocation this mentality can bring upon the main characters of the film.

The film has a happy tone and that is orchestrated through it's director, Brian Dannelly, who said in a recent interview that he was surprised at the controversy that the film has raised.

Christians will scream blasphemy but actually this movie is much more than the teen stars who act in it.

The script is clever, which I am sure most know by now. It's the actring that suprisingly connects the audience with the issue at heart. Jena Malone is wide-eyed and sweet, turning from a precarious teen deeply involved in the christian faith to a disillusioned pregnant mum-to-be by her g*y boyfriend. Mandy Moore plays a religiously indoctrinated girl who's bent on reaching eternal divinity at all costs. Maculay Culkin turns in an unexpectedly sensitive portrayal of a wheelchair-bound kid brother of her evil sister. Props must go to the faboulous Eva Amurri for her stunning portrayal of wayward rebel Cassandra and the real highlight in the movie is when she breaks out in a delirious fit during the school's first Assembly spewing Jewish as if she was possessed by God until Mandy Moore's character reveals that she's talking dirty! Funny!

At the end, this film is much more than teen pregancy, h*mose*uality and God. It's about how many of us pray to the same God but see so many things on our own. It also serves a timely reminder that religion, like most other things, must move with the times without becoming overly rigid.

REVIEWING MOVIES.

While the previous statement might make a great point for a film or sociology class, it has little bearing on the entertainment value of the film.  The fact of the matter is that this is a funny film with many of its stars giving their finest work. (ie Mandy Moore and Jena Malone)  Where this film hit home for me was realizing what I was like in high school, and recognizing how much my faith has matured since then.  It shows how many teens can understand the lessons of the Bible, yet do not possess the ability to apply them practically.  The comparison to Mandy Moore's and Jena Malone's characters show how some people make excuses that allow them to go against their beliefs, while others reexamine those beliefs instead of making excuses.  That is at the center of this film, and it can cause a person (such as myself) to look internally and evaluate my own faith.  While The Passion of the Christ was gore fest with weepy music to make you feel guilty about your life compared to Christ's sacrifice (something no human will ever live up to), Saved! effectivly makes a person look at what they believe and why, and provides a few laughs in the process.",1095206400,5,1393,4.611336032388664

Which is actually quite ironic, considering the movie focuses on the lack of narrow-mindedness of the Christian community. If they'd given this movie a fair chance, they would've had the pleasure of realizing there's more to this movie than the promotional commercials revealed.

Yes, this movie is very satirical, and yes it pokes fun at the contemporary Christian lifestyle - but it's all for a good reason. For a movie that was promoted as an anti-faith production, the film is actually for faith and provokes serious food for thought. It's no Passion of the Christ, because in my opinion, a movie that actually triggers honest and REALISTIC spiritual thought is the most important. Saved! is the movie for the job. At the end of the day, non-conventional forms of spreading faith are FAR more important that popping in a home video of the crucifixion of Jesus.

2113009,4,B0002OXRSG,"There is no easy way to clear up the debate that this film generates for those who are either religious or nonreligious, or religious but not fundamentalist, but I will say this:  I attended a Southern Baptist college, and pretty much everything that one can find in this film I saw in real life.  I was in a play where a girl kissed me on the cheek, to have her parents pull her out of school the next day for immorality.  I knew a host of ""good"" Baptist girls and boys who could have written veritable Kama Sutras on things they can do together without having intercourse.  I have seen so many good things declared Satanic that one would imagine that there is no room left for God.  As one with an extensive evangelical fundamentalist background, I really didn't find anything too extreme.  I even knew some devout Christians who were just as mean in their faith as Hilary Faye in this film.  Overall, I don't think the film is anti-religious or anti-Christianity.  But it is a critique of the narrowness of many Christians, a critique that I personally think Jesus would completely endorse.  After all, in the Gospels, the two groups of people He had no patience with were the wealthy and the overly religious.

The point of the film wasn't to provide a Polaroid of what life in Christian fundamentalist high schools is like.  If so, they would have included more of the really nice people that inhabit the schools.  The point of the film is to highlight something that Jena Malone's character Mary (albeit, a not so virginal one) says to Pastor Skip near the end:  ""Why would God make us all so different, if he wanted us to all be the same?""  I have witnessed first hand the way that many fundamentalist groups want to cut back on diversity, want to limit the number of legitimate lifestyle choices for people.  I think the point of this film is that underneath the rather artificial veneer that many fundamentalist groups impose on people, they still are more diverse than they want to acknowledge, and the individuality eventually comes out, even if suppressed in the short run.

The cast is excellent, and I especially enjoyed Jena Malone as Mary.  She does a great job of combining fragility and innocence and strength.  The humor was sharp and to the point, and I found a host of the situations throughout the film to be thoroughly familiar.

My main complaint with the film is the last half hour, where the narrative starts falling apart, not so much conceptually as visually.  Movies are always told with the camera, and not by the script, and the timing in many of the final scenes is just off a bit.  For instance, where we see the Pastor Skip walking towards the hospital, and then away, and then back.  Or many of the verbal encounters at the prom.  The narrative flow bogged down and didn't match the rhythm of the rest of the movie.

All in all, this is a good movie about being in a teenager in a place that not everyone in our society is familiar with.  With a better-paced final half hour, it would have been even better.",1093046400,238,3042,4.547794117647059
2113010,3,B0002OXRSG,"Saved is an extremely uneven film--it hits its target dead center several times but ultimately falls prey to what the film itself condemns.

Saved is most effective when it presents its satirical critique of contemporary practices of modern Evangelicalism, albeit one given to much exaggeration.

The film effectively satirizes the Evangelical church's adoption of all things pop in order to appear relevant-Pastor Skip's ""Christian"" slang, the chapel service disguised as a pop concert, the Jesus in tennis shoes, etc. . . Instead of engaging and confronting the culture, the contemporary church does, as this film depicts, too often offer up cheap imitations of the most empty elements of our pop culture--the What Would Jesus Eat cookbook and the Christian Wrestling Federation come quickly to mind.

The film also fairly satirizes the parallel universe Christians have created for themselves, living such separated lives, they need not fear contamination from the world.  A Christian shooting range?  A Christian prom? The mention of the ""Christian"" Halloween party?  Christian pop bands?  Christians withdraw into their own subculture and then complain that people outside the faith don't take them seriously.  Well?  When Christians reach out to the non-Christian with inferior copies of what he or she is already consuming, can they really be surprised that the thinking non-believer will scoff at them?

Where the film misses the mark is in the depiction of the inner lives of the Christian characters.

Clearly the filmmakers have made many accurate observations about contemporary practices within Christianity; however their observations about the inner lives of Christians fall woefully short.  The film does little to challenge the presuppositions of the majority of non-believers who watch this film, but rather reinforces stereotypes of Evangelical Christians as small minded, ruthless Pharisees.  The committed Christians are so unbelievably shallow they are mere caricatures of actual human beings.  Characters only become humane when they reject the faith.

The film eventually fails as a satire as it hypocritically portrays the same attitudes it seeks to condemn.

At one point in the film the Christian students display a self-righteous concern for the poor benighted heathen of the world who just don't get the message of the gospel.  The film itself holds much the same attitude toward those poor benighted Christians who just don't get the message of tolerance.  This sneering superiority will warm the hearts of the filmmaker's choir, but as satire the film falls well short.

Evangelicalism is a fair target for satire, but for a truly satiric work on this topic to be successful, those writing the satire need a deeper understanding of their subject matter than the creators of Saved possess.",1092355200,14,2819,5.394977168949771
2113011,5,B0002OXRSG,"Since you already know the story line, i won't repeat it.  I will only say that this movie was the funniest and most original film of the year and people who are not too uptight about their religion should see it.",1091491200,3,213,4.195121951219512
2113012,5,B0002OXRSG,"I hadn't seen many ads for this movie going in, but I knew that Mandy Moore, Jena Malone, and Macauly Culkin were in it. I didn't set my hopes very high, thinking that the film was going to be a bit of a letdown. I was so wrong! This is one of the funniest and best movies that I've seen in a very long time. The story follows Mary (Malone), an oh-so-Christian girl who has never wavered in spirituallity. She has two best friends, the so-good-she's-bad Hilary Faye (Moore), and Veronica (Elizabeth Thai), a Vietnamese girl who was ""saved"" when she was adopted by an African-American family. The three of them are part of a group called the Christian Jewels, and they are a Christian Rock band. Mary also has a boyfriend named Dean (Chad Faust), who is also a perfect Christian... until one day, Mary and Dean are swimming, when Dean tells Mary that he thinks he might be gay. Mary is so shocked that she bangs her head and starts to drown. A kid by the pool, who has long brown hair and a beard, jumps in and saves her. In a delusional state, Mary believes the boy to be Jesus, and he tells her to save Dean. Mary does everything she can think of short of sex to save her boyfriend from homosexualality. One day, while talking with Hilary Faye, they get on the subject of intercourse. Hilary Faye says that, in certain circumstances, like rape, God can restore a person's virginity. Mary believes that, if she is able to save Dean through sex, her virginity will be restored. So they do it. And not only does Dean not become straight, Mary gets pregnant.

 Soon, Mary begins to question her faith, and she is thrown out of the Jewels group, only to be replaced by a nerdy wannabe (Heather Matarazzo). Mary also begins hanging out with Cassandra (Eva Amurri), the only Jewish girl and the only bad girl at the school, and Roland (Culkin), Hilary Faye's handicapped and laid back brother. The two kids, who are fast developping a relationship, help get her through the pregnancy as best they can.

 This movie is about religion gone nuts. The girls at the school, Hilary Faye in particular, are examples of people who use religion for the wrong reasons. Hilary Faye believes anyone who isn't Christian is going to Hell, and it is her mission to save them all. Also, the movie addresses ways of remedying situations. When Dean is sent to a place called Mercy House to get de-gayified, Mary soon discovers that it is not a place for those who are sent there, it is a place for those who do the sending.

 This movie may be offensive to some people. For example, when we are first introduced to Cassandra, we see her pull into a handicap parking space, she is smoking, there are beer bottles in her car, and right away we learn she is Jewish. There are bad girls in every religion, and we needed to know why she did the things she did, but it's almost as if the writer assossiated Jews with evil. Probably not though, because of the film's theme. Anyway, if you can handle religion bashing, you will love this movie.",1091404800,3,3012,4.467272727272727
2113013,1,B0002OXRSG,"Some of the other reviews are laughable, like ""This movie is not anti-Christian, as many people say. It just mocks them"".What do you think mocking is? Being for it? Of course its anti christian. And talking about open mindedness how about making a movie mocking other religions? This movie is just another example of the Intolerence shown to christians in america.",1091318400,9,364,4.983606557377049
2113014,5,B0002OXRSG,"This movie is not anti-Christian, as many people say. It just mocks them. And I'm not totally supporting this. But all those tight-knit conservatives who've been persecuting this movie mercilessly should actually open their eyes to this movie. The main message is tolerance. That is often needed in our society, especially on the religious front.

 Jena Malone ia Mary Cummings, who's just recently found out that her boyfriend (Chad Faust) is gay. In order to ""save"" him from eternal damnation, she seduces him, and ends up pregnant instead while he's sent off to a Christian cleansing camp, Mercy House. This unexpected problem begans to drive Mary apart from her opinionated, devoutly religious influential best friend Hilary Faye (Mandy Moore), who manages to turn the school -- along with her devoted ""disciples"" -- against Mary. It's only then that she finds true friends, other students that her school doesn't quite know what to do with. Ultimately, they nagivate the treacherous waterways to graduation, where they discover the true meaning of being saved.

 Jena Malone is a dynamic actress. All of her emotion is raw and powerful, and she brings much depth to her confused character. Mandy Moore is absolutely hilarious as Hilary Faye, who's so sure of herself when she's obviously so wrong. And Heather Matarazzo as Tia is absolutely genius. She may not have many speaking lines, but she manages to convey the motive of her character so clearly through everything that she does. A must see movie.",1091232000,4,1508,5.068548387096774

2113017,5,B0002OXRSG,"Forget all the hype you've heard about this movie. Forget the critics who consider it a great satire on religious fundamentalism and intolerance. Forget the critics who complain that it's not satirical enough, that it missed a great opportunity and went soft on religious fundamentalism. And forget the zealots who say this movie is nothing more than an attack on Christianity. Go into this film knowing that its foundation is a teen comedy and you'll probably come out feeling the same way I did; that you've just seen the best teen comedy of your life.

When I first saw this movie, I posted a review and gave it three stars. I can't stress how much I regret that now. I don't think I knew what to really make of it. I saw some of the reviews and heard some of the complaints about it, and think I watched it with slightly clouded judgment. Since then, I've seen it a few more times and am no longer hung-up on whether the movie is trying to impart a political opinion on me. I am able to see it for what's really there; a film with more heart than one of this type should have.

You'll be surprised by how many touching scenes there are in this movie. Seriously, they're some of the most moving moments you'll ever see in a teen comedy and they just keep coming. The best one takes place in the school's bathroom where the heroine, a teenager who's alone and friendless, carrying a secret burden many adults can't even handle, is tricked into confessing the secret by an antagonist. She breaks down and starts to cry, and is quickly befriended by the girl. Words can't describe what an unbelievably moving moment that is. It's the best I've ever seen in a teen comedy, and I grew up in the 80's, I've seen them all. After watching movies like this for some twenty plus years, I've been conditioned to believe we're not supposed to get moments like that in movies like these. What a wonderful surprise. It's a scene that caused the theater to grow quiet, except for a few moans of ""Oh"" and ""Aw"", where people suddenly reached for their pop to help wash down the lump in their throat (I'm not exaggerating, an elderly gentleman sitting next to me had to dry his eyes). I'm a guy, and therefore can't admit to getting tearful, but if I were a chick . . .

There are a lot of scenes like that in this movie. Some take place after her boyfriend is sent away; she is hurt and confused, and incapable of understanding how something like that could happen. In one scene, where the heroine first learns a crushing revelation, there is no dialog, we just see the expression on her face (Malone is amazing) yet it's absolutely heartbreaking. There's another, similar to that, near the end of the movie, where her secret is revealed. Or the scenes with her romantic interest in the film, Patrick. He's the good-natured son of the pastor, who tries to court her. He knows she likes him so can't understand why she rejects him. Another, when Mary's (Malone) mom is about to send her away. They're sitting on the bed packing a suitcase when Mary asks if she ruined her mom's life. Her mom leaves the room without answering her question and the camera shows Mary sitting alone on her bed, shaking her head, trying to understand. Wow (I should probably remind you, at this point, that this is a teen comedy).

There's also a surprisingly good scene between the pastor and Mary's mom, Lillian. They're at a Valentines Day dinner and she's staring longingly over at another couple who are sharing a romantic kiss. The pastor feels guilty about their relationship and has difficulty expressing his affection for her. Here was a great idea, a romantic scene between the adults that was just as tender and thoughtful as the romantic scenes between the kids.

There are many other scenes like these, I couldn't describe them all in under 1000 words, but none of them are depressing. Sad, touching, moving, sweet, funny, heartbreaking, romantic: there are a lot of adjectives I could use to describe this film but it always seems headed in a positive and upbeat direction. There is a unique combination of story, acting, direction, and even music that produced something so rare I've never seen it before: a teenage comedy with more heart than any melodramatic, mega production Hollywood will pimp out around Oscar time.",1090627200,39,4299,4.607049608355092
2113018,5,B0002OXRSG,I went to a Christian college and I have to say that this movie hit the culture of Christian schools right on the head.  Everything from the people raising their hands in Chapel to the viciousness of Hilary Faye.  I laughed my butt off for the entire length of the movie.  Anyone that has had any contact with this type of culture and a sense of humor would find it hysterical.  I would so recommend it to anyone.,1089936000,5,413,4.256410256410256
2113019,3,B0002OXRSG,"I'm awesome. When playing basketball with my cousin, I whip out all my moves - dribbling right past his outstretched arms, whipping around him in circles, and then flying over his head when I touch the sky and nearly break the rim when I slam dunk the ball in. Oh wait, sorry, my cousin's seven years old and it's a little Fisher Price basketball hoop. My bad, I didn't tell you that he's an easy target and it requires no effort on my part whatsoever. Kind of like the writing that must have gone into what critics are calling the Anti-Passion.
  And it's pretty clear that Saved! isn't going to be breaking any satirical ground right in the film's first moments: an excruciatingly awful, teeny-bopper rendition of maybe the greatest rock song ever written, ""God Only Knows."" So I wasn't expecting much after that, let me tell you. Cue: Mary's (Jena Malone) narration, the setup that she lives among a throng of Christian zealots and has been brought up as one, and off we are on a steady roll (for nearly the film's entire first act) of low blows and potshots to Christianity that aren't even funny for the most part. Pick a part of Christian worship and Saved! lampoons it - the invitation to 'accept Jesus,' the praise-and-worship tunes, even prayer. So let me warn you: if stuff like this easily offends you, brace yourself. I'm a pretty liberal movie-goer and even I was checking the exits. But why?
  Well, much like Dogville by Lars von Trier (a movie I strongly disliked whereas, as you'll read on, I ended up being lukewarm about this one), the entire crux of Saved! s setup is based on a stereotype. In Dogville's case, it was that all Americans are evil, self-serving monsters who will do anything to demean others. In Saved!, Dannelly so immaturely conveys the idea that all Christians are phony, insincere, unaccepting hypocrites. But let me stop here - are there some Christians who are phony, insincere, unaccepting, and hypocritical? YES! (Attend any local church for a while and you'll believe me) But are all Christians like that? NO! So, Dannelly, strike one against you.
  Let me be non-phony, sincere, accepting, and honest for a moment and say, though, that Saved! does nail some things...and it's often quite funny, not to mention extremely well-done in parts. Jena Malone is well on her way to being a seriously great actress, Patrick Fugit should get more work, and Eva Amurri (Susan Sarandon's daughter, who has inherited a killer rack, might I add) has a feisty glow to everything she does. And laugh-wise, it seems that the less blatantly offensive Saved! becomes, the funnier and more easy-to-like it becomes. I seriously hated this movie for a while, but then it does look it it starts to peek above your average teenage-message flick. A love story subplot with Malone and Fugit is incredibly effective in a cheesey way, the friendship (and more) formed between Culkin's 'differently disabled' teenager and Eva Amurri's Jewish girl provides quite a few laughs, and the more the movie lays off the pot shots the more it seems legit.
  But one of Saved!'s biggest faults is in the movie's most exaggerated and (rightly) annoying character, Moore's Hilary Faye. First of all, putting her in this movie is nothing more than a gimmick, letting the 'Christian Hollywood girl' satirize her own religion. Well, if I were Moore, I wouldn't be too proud of myself right now, first of all, and if I were Dannelly I would have made her more of a character and not a caricature. Her dialogue is implausible, her actions improbable, and a crucial twist in the film that rests on her shoulders crossed a line with me. And Moore should stick with something other than acting - she just can't be serious without looking properly ridiculous.
  So I've talked about some great things and some pretty awful things about this movie, but where does it stand in the end? Well, thanks to Dannelly and Urban, Saved! doesn't cut it. The whole movie feels like they're taking tips they learned in ""Satire 101"" and applying them in an awkward, ham-handed way. Yes, characters do emerge as loving and caring and the movie's overall theme is one of acceptance, but the way it's reached is so sophomoric and mechanical. There's a lot of talent lurking in this movie, a lot of potentially wicked wit, and a lot of potential, but it all comes down to the fact that the writers/director are playing basketball with a seven-year-old. Christianity is, and always will be, an easy target for comedy...so why not aim a little higher, be a little more creative? There comes a point when satire becomes fun-making, and Saved!, funny and occasionally decent as it can be, clearly shows where that point is. GRADE: C+",1089849600,,4706,4.76319018404908
2113020,1,B0002OXRSG,"""Saved!"" was the only movie I *really* wanted to see this summer. It looked funny, and was soppoused to be different from most teen-acted comedies. I even went to see it the night it came out in theaters. After a half an hours time, I knew that it wasn't worth the hype. I wanted badly to leave, but forced myself to keep watching, thinking it *might* get better. It just got worse and worse, and more like a cheesy, everyday teen comedy. The climax even takes place at the big seinor prom. It wasn't funny, either. I don't think I laughed once. The annoying cast of charectors made it all the more worse. Despite my hate of it, I *must* defend it on one point; it's NOT meant to mock Christianity all together. It's meant to mock Chritians who take thier religion out of hand. I noticed that many of the people who have given this a one-star rating all comment on how it makes fun of Christianity, and I want to know; have you ever actually *seen* this movie???",1089676800,11,962,4.35

2113022,5,B0002OXRSG,"A few weeks ago, a friend and I went to see Saved!.  Not because we like Mandy Moore or anyone in the cast, but because a movie knocking the hilarity of how dumb Christians are interested us.  Now I know all of you Passion of the Christ lovers out there reading this probably hate me, but you know I'm right!  I'm Catholic too, but at least I'm honest enough to admit that Saved! is completely true.  If 'God is love,' he would have no problem with homosexuality.  If 'God is people,' then why can't teenagers keep their babies?  The whole religion idea SUCKS!  Just face it.
Enough with my ranting...  Onto the review.  As I already stated, Saved! is true.  It really does portray this lifestyle we've all come to be familiar with.  It shows that it's ridiculous and I'm happy for it.  It's such an awesome film because it's a teen movie with heart.  It doesn't cliche itself with the typical teen movie rules.  I mean sure, it does kind of take steps into other teen movies but at the same to it adds its own... oomph.  Plus, I have to say the whole cast pulls off really great performances.  Yes, even little Miss Moore.  And Jena Malone does an excellent job as the lead character Mary.  What I also liked about it was the controversy it was bringing to town.  My church said if we saw it, and I quote, ""you will rot forever in Hell.""  How stupid are these people?  No movie starring a pop star could ever cause Satan to take me anymore, dude.  Why don't they say anything about us rotting in Hell for seeing ""The Passion?""  Can you answer me that?  I thought churches were against violence?  I guessed wrong, obviously!  Oh well!  Overall, a great film.  If you're an adult, see it.  If you're a kid see it.  But only if you don't have Bible-hugging parents.",1089244800,6,1763,4.368421052631579
2113023,5,B0002OXRSG,"Having grown up in a Southern Baptist environment and having attended a Baptist School from 5th grade through 12th grade I found this movie insanely accurate and hilarious.
My brother (who attended the same school) sat there and we kept comparing notes and having flashbacks to the good old days. (If you could call them that)
I was an atheist in the lions den. I was known as Little Satan because I read Steven King.. I was an outcast.. I was hated.. and I LOVED it.
This movie shows the close-mindedness of the Christian religion in ALL it's glory and even with the Mandy Moore character it isn't exaggerating much. I KNEW girls like her. Almost exactly like her.
The funniest thing was the Pastor trying to connect with the youth by using their lingo. I don't think I ever met a youth pastor who didn't try to seem hip to the kids by talking like them and trying to connect with them by using their language.
Mary Louise Parker was great in this.. as she always is. Wasn't quite the amazing performance she gave in Angels in America but she definitly nailed this part.
Um.. what else can I say.. it's a great movie and I think the fact that it showed christian extremists in a real sense but didn't lose it's religious feel was a nice touch too.
The message that God loves everyone equally was a good one. If you believe in God that is ;)",1088380800,13,1341,4.389558232931727
2113024,4,B0002OXRSG,"Yeah, this movie has its moments.  When I saw it, the theatre was packed and everybody laughed their heads off.  The impressive thing about this is that I saw it in Kansas, where they're seriously considering changing the state motto to ""I Ain't Come From No Monkey.""
Not that there's any reason at all why anybody should get uppity about this film, of course.  ""Saved!"" is perfectly harmless, even bland in its satire.  The characters are all very broadly drawn, the format is 80's teen flick, and the ending wraps everything up in a nice happy package, sitcom-style.  Only people who dispute evolution, picket abortion clinics, lobby against gay marriage, etc., are likely to take offense to anything contained here; and I know better than to argue with lunatics.  The rest of us aren't learning anything we didn't know from this movie.  Relax, Mr. Falwell, ""Saved!"" is ""preaching to the converted"" (so to speak) exactly as ""SuperSize Me"" was, and neither is likely to have much effect on core bases of fundamentalists and the morbidly obese respectively.
Then there are the people who complain that ""Saved!"" puts the emphasis on psycho-Christian Hilary (are we really so surprised that Mandy Moore pulled this off?), and naive, misguided outsider Mary (Jena Malone), but doesn't provide a solid counter-example of a good Christian girl who's devout but not judgemental or confused or manifestly insane.  Well, nice try, but I'm afraid that's only valid as a ""criticism"" if you're Christian.  Sure, most of the reasonable, down-to-earth, open-minded characters in this film are non-Christians; but you know, maybe that's just ""the way it was"" in this one particular hypothetical instance.  Movies have no more responsibility to constantly promote the Christian agenda than they do the ""gay agenda"" (much discussed by Christians), or the Puerto Rican, or the vegan, or ANY agenda other than that of making their backers some scrilla.  Anyway, this is supposed to be a satire, remember?  It doesn't always have to hit above the belt, even when the target is religion - at least in this country.  (Thank God!)
""Saved!"" isn't nearly as venemous or vindictive towards religion as it could've been, especially in light of recent events.  Yes, Hilary is ridiculous, over-the-top, flamboyantly hypocritical - again, that's how you know it's a JOKE.  But about the most ""blasphemous"" thing that happens in the film is that at one point she drives her car into a 50-foot Jesus-shaped billboard in a fit of rage, and the head lands on her windshield.  Compared with what he goes through in ""The Passion,"" that's a cake walk.  The writers are actually very careful to make the point - at the end of the film - that true spirituality is (or ought to be) positive and balanced rather than vicious and bigoted.  They don't insist on denomination, and why should they?  Yet ""Saved!"" has in fact been embraced by a few Christian groups whose faith was evidently strong enough to withstand a trip to the movies.  I daresay the typical televangelist could learn something from them.
I've chosen not to rehash the plot for you in this review because that's already been done.  To me this film is more interesting for the way people react to it than for the content itself.  I enjoyed it, but not as much as I figured I would considering how much certain people hate it.  Still, I like the fact that somebody made this kind of picture, and I hope more follow.  The actors are all OK; Eva Amurri steals the show as obnoxious punk Jew transfer student Cassandra; Patrick Fugit is the Christian skateboarder and oft-overlooked example of a non-insane but religious youth in the film; Macaulay Culkin's in here too as the wheelchair-bound wiseacre Roland (get it), and he can't act, but we already knew that.

2113027,3,B0002OXRSG,"In the new teen satire SAVED, Mary (Jena Malone) - a student at a Christian high school - becomes pregnant after having sex with her boyfriend to ""cure"" his homosexuality. Mary is part of the in crowd, led by Hillary Faye (Mandy Moore), and she worries about what her condition will do to her long anticipated senior year. She finds new and more open friends with two outcast, played by  Macaulay Culkin (in a wheelchair, Hillary Faye's brother), and Eva Amurri.
What's being satirized in SAVED isn't Christianity but a sort of McChristianity that's become popular with the rise of the ""Left Behind"" books and ""The Passion"". That is, Christianity which reduces Christian principles to aphorisms and  encourages people to be so blind to the daily ups and downs of life that they become entrenched hypocrites. Hillary Faye and her friends turn against Mary. Moore lacks the necessary degree of comic self-righteousness for the ""mean girl"" role and too often seems just silly. My central problem with the film, though I agreed with many of its sentiments, was that Hillary Faye is left unredeemed at the end; she's the only one who's really made fun of.
Also with Patrick Fugit, Martin Donovan (a ""hip"" youth minister), and Mary-Louise Parker as Mary's mom. Very funny and observant of teen life, despite some flaws. Recommended.",1088035200,3,1326,4.941704035874439
2113028,4,B0002OXRSG,"""Saved!"" could also be known as comic relief from Febuary's release of ""The Passion of The Christ."" In a way, both films are similiar to each other, but also very different. Christ is being tortured for what he did, which is also what happens to the main character in this film, minus most of the violence. The movies main problem is that it co-stars Mandy Moore, and I don't think she is a good actress. I'm seen two of her movies, ""How to Deal,"" and ""Chasingf Liberty"" and both of those were less than perfect, especially the latter. I thought this was going to be a large problem when I walked into the theatre, but she wasn't that bad in this movie. None of the actors and actresses were bad, but the idea of Mandy Moore in the movie could be a big turnoff.
The movie is about Mary, or the Virgin Mary as said in the film, who goes to a Christian school with her friend Hillary Faye who could be considered the ultimate Christian, always trying to ""save"" people from hell. Everything is going well for Mary until she finds out that her boyfriend Dead is gay. Mary gets the idea that God wants her to save Dean, so she has sex with him. He ends up going to a school for the troubled, and Mary ends up getting pregnant. Mary decides not to tell anybody, and is successful is gaining the trust of Hillary's wheelchair brother Roland, and Cassandra, the only Jewish person in the school. Mary also begins to develope feelings for Patrick, the son of Pastor Skip who runs the school. Pastor Skip is also developing feelings for Mary's single mother Lillian.
""Saved!"" is not a movie for everybody. Some may be offended by some of the Christian remarks in the movie, as well as things that the characters say and do. It was not as great as the other Christian film of the year ""The Passion of The Christ,"" but it was funny, smart, and a good movie. Some of the parts I thought were dull, and I feel that the writer/director Brian Dannelly could have made some better comedic situations without having to use physical comedy. I like physical comedy as well as the next person, but this movie did not need it. I thought ""Saved!"" was good enough to see in the theatre, but those who are feeling nervous about watching it because of its religious views should wait for the video.

2113029,5,B0002OXRSG,I think the advertising for this movie has tried to simplify it too much.  It is a movie about several people who are all trying to do what is right.  Based on the information that they have they believe they are acting according to the will of God.  The movie seems to make the point that the will of God is difficult to interpret and must be thought about and reconsidered in each new situation.  I was very impressed by the depth of thought in this film.  The acting was quite good and I hope to see more movies like this one in the future.,1087776000,3,543,4.133333333333334
2113030,4,B0002OXRSG,"I've heard that fundamentalist groups are lining up to protest Brian Dannelly's ""Saved!"", which is really too bad. This pleasant, charming and altogether rather innocent film provides a painless lesson about what true Christian behavior should be. The plot concerns Mary (Jena Malone), an innocent, earnest born-again girl who tries to cure her boyfriend of his newly realized gayness by seducing him. Her resulting pregnancy scandalizes the ""Christian Jewels"" clique at Mary's fundamentalist high school, led by the insufferable Hillary Faye (Mandy Moore). Some funny and lightly satirical complications ensue, enacted by a talented cast of teen-star royalty--not only Malone and Moore, but also Macaulay Culkin, Patrick Fugit and Heather Matarazzo. The standout, however, is Eva Amurri (Susan Sarandon's daughter) as Cassandra, the only Jewish student at Mary's high school, who sets herself in gleeful rebellion against Hillary Faye's hypocritical rat pack. ""Saved!"" sends up various affectations of both the teen and born-again cultures, but with more affection than vitriol. The film is not anti-Christian at all, just anti-Pharisee. That anyone considers it controversial at all is more a commentary on society (and not a pleasant one) than on the movie.",1087689600,85,1260,5.602094240837697
2113031,4,B0002OXRSG,"SAVED is a good movie even if it's bound to shock or offend some hard line evangelical Christians.  It's a comedy with some dramatic twists, and some interesting points to make about modern Christianity.  The performances are all really good!  The actors play this very real.  Mandy Moore (as the sometimes cruel Hillary Faye) is not pure evil - just self-centered and not empathetic towards others.  Jena Malone plays Mary who becomes heavy with child after trying to save her gay boyfriend.  She makes her innocent and sympathetic.  Mac Culkin plays a handicapped brother, and does it with a wry wit and sly style.  Patrick Fugit is great as the pastor's son - who happens to be a semi-professional Christian skateboarder.  Very moving also is Mary Louise Parker as Malone's mom - who finds the situation with her daughter quite hard to take.
Ultimately the movie is about tolerance - something I think most Christians understand already.  It turns its critical eye on people who force others to feel inferior because of mistakes they make or faiths they have which do not line up with their own views.  They also have some clever bits about the new face of Christianity - where the secular and sacred seemed to have become blurred (rock bands with Jesus messages, WWJD bracelets, etc).  In the end it's a movie with a big heart - just maybe not an orthodox one.  All the characters end up in an okay place, and no one is judged too harshly.  And that seems to be the point - Judge not, lest ye yourself be judged.",1087603200,4,1516,4.629213483146067
2113032,4,B0002OXRSG,"I was anticipating seeing this film since I saw the trailer months ago. I was unsure what to make of it, and the reviews were so strangely mixed, that I knew it was just one of those films that I'd just have to see. And I'm glad I did! It's not a five-star movie (no teen romantic dramedy is!), but definitely four stars.

For an accurate description, read the critics reviews, not the users. Caulkin was actually very good! He was very subtle and deadpan.

Moore was able to poke fun at herself and did a fine job, and the main character, Malone, was wonderful.

The film was funny, sad and romantic. Mostly funny...very funny.

And, yes, the film is didactic, but not forcefully so (other than the scene at the prom). Oftentimes it takes seeing anothers small-mindedness to help foster tolerance in oneself, as is the case in this movie. What we're presented with is a group of different people each with a different problem that doesn't jive with the conservative interpretation of the bible. How does one reconcile their reality (ego) with their ideals (superego)?

Lest I ramble too long, allow me to summarize: the film is good and preaches a good lesson. The film DOES NOT condemn Christianity or religious schools, only the small-mindedness that some of the followers exhibit(as is true of any fanatic).

Plus, who can beat a film with a lesson that actually has a happy ending anymore?!",1087603200,2,1395,4.69672131147541
2113033,4,B0002OXRSG,ok so I saw this movie. It was goood in that weird humor kind of way. MAC Culkin was classic. His halloween costum as a skate is classic.

2113034,5,B0002OXRSG,"A student at a Christian high school wants to save her gay boyfriend by having sex with him. Another student there seems to see herself as God's head cheerleader. Right away, this film shows its irreverence and its outlandish humor.
However, despite what the previews and the first half of the film suggest, this movie isn't anti-Christian at all, but rather anti-hypocrisy and anti-bigotry. Too much prejudice parades around in the cloak of religion, and this little comedy tears that cloak off.
With a brilliant and mostly young cast that includes Jena Malone, Macauley Culkin, and Mandy Moore, Saved! calls us to laugh at our arrogance and ultimately feel more compassion toward those who might not fit into our world view...as well as those who mistreat us.
Some will dismiss Saved! as simply an attack on religion in general, while some others will see it as a specific attack only on fundamentalist Christianity. I wouldn't call it either, and I speak as someone who attended Christian colleges and immersed himself in the culture this movie depicts: a culture of often-tacky Christian merchandising and a culture that centers around the constant politics of exclusion.
I would call Saved! a funny, enjoyable satire that might challenge us to show a little more love. And isn't love the one virtue that Jesus stressed the most?",1087171200,10,1333,5.009009009009009
2113035,5,B0002OXRSG,"Having grown up in the 1970s in a similar environment to the movie (but worse - without the rock music, dancing and girls in sexy skirts) the film certainly hit home.
For six years I had to attend a private ""Christian"" academy. I put the word Christian with quotation marks because what I experienced was reflected in the movie.
As ""Saved!"" shows, there are many Christians who don't follow the Golden Rule. They go around making fools of themselves, pronouncing their piety like teenagers bragging about their last trip to the mall and what they purchased. Far worse, as the movie shows, is the self righteous attitude that turns to hatred of those they deem ""unacceptable"" -- gays, lesbians, pregnant unmarried girls, Jews, people of color, etc.
There are many who have taken offense to the movie.  Some have stated that ""Saved!"" is a form of bigotry towards Christians, that it inaccurately depicts Christians and expresses hatred. But ""Saved!"" is frighteningly rooted in some reality. Yes, there are some stereotypes (it is a movie), but those characterizations are most definitely based on real people. (One of the primary writers attended a Christian school.) So the warped argument then follows: It's hateful to call hateful people hateful. Uhuh.
Ebert and Roeper reviewed this film and argued that it is not against Christianity. It's simply against a certain type of Christian. Some have tried to say that the film argues you have to renounce your beliefs. This is a circular argument. Who's to say that the crowd of ""rejects"" at the end aren't the true Christians? The film doesn't demand that you renounce Christianity, it just appropriately picks out the hypocrites.
 ""Saved!"" is not a great movie necessarily. But it is funny. There were several scenes that rang completely true. And then there were many that came right out a hundred teeny-bopper flicks. Regardless, it is a good movie, one that I hope takes the mirror and reflects back to (some) Christians who use Jesus as a weapon.
That is, in fact, my favorite line from the movie. In one scene a ""good Christian girl"" throws a Bible at another who has supposedly forsaken Christ. The other girl hands the Bible back to her and says, ""This is not a weapon!"" I'd like to scream that sentiment from a few mountaintops myself.",1087171200,23,2292,4.874358974358974
2113036,4,B0002OXRSG,"I was very unenthusiastic about this movie. The only reason I thought I should see it was because I thought I should keep up with the stereotypes that aloof, ignorant pseudo-intellectuals have for Christians. I was expecting loads of predictable dialogue about abortion clinics (""she's planting a pipe bomb?"") and unwarranted cliches. While there was some of this, I was impressed by the efforts of the filmmakers to show the humanity and complexity of all involved, even the ogre-ish character played by Mandy Moore.
The characters are straight-up MTV personas, sort of like a ""Daria"" episode making fun of religion. We've got the snobby, mindless Moore (who does a great job) as the head goon; a youth pastor whose desperate attempts to be hip only accent his hopelessly traditional square-ness; a kooky mother who shelters her child from the secular world; and the protagonist (Jena Malone, lovely as always) who was once influenced by the hyper-fundamentalism of Moore's crew but is now having doubts. Then we've got Patrick, the sweet, sensitive, post-modern influence in the movie, who's more interested in skateboarding than converting heathens. And where would we be without the quintessential cynics, those adorably sarcastic ""others"" who light films up with their free thinking and quasi-anarchic ways (also, in the context of the film, non-Christians). Maculay Culkin does a respectable job as one of these, as does Eva Amurri, who is also Jewish.
Oh yeah, and a recently-out homosexual teenager who provides for plenty of opportunity on the Christian kids' parts to show their ignorance and utter lack of compassion. I guess some things are  inevitable.
Taken as it is, this would be an incredibly lazy film. However, director Brian Dannelly delves deeper, and we see the insecurities and doubts that plague even the most steadfastly (albeit disgustingly) faithful of them all. It's heart-breaking to watch Moore's character praying at her bed, trying her darndest to find out what God wants for her, when she's so close to realizing that she's too involved with her own self-righteousness to even hear God.
Granted, it is just a teen comedy at heart, and the satire is rather light. And it's almost certain that people who don't know much about Christianity will like it a lot more than those who actually can support or denounce the stereotypes with authority. Still, a rather refreshing view of things we don't much like talking about.
Now if only Hollywood could make a movie about REAL Christians, living under foreign governments, under pain of death for their faith, to spread Christ's love in a loving, UNforceful way ... huh, that'll be the day.",1087084800,,2666,5.100686498855835
2113037,4,B0002OXRSG,"Set in a Christian high school and peopled with teenagers that could have been smoking, ingesting or injecting drugs but instead are preaching and crazy-in-love with God and his teachings, ""Saved"" doesn't go so much for the jugular of these people as it does for their heart.
Mary (Jena Malone in another first rate performance) and Hilary Faye (Mandy Moore) are fervent members of the Christian Jewels, an elite girl's club, very similar, in fact to the Plastics of that other teen movie, ""Mean Girls."" Mary is conflicted, though: she is devout but also driven by another demon, her basic urges, to misbehave. And it is around Mary's rebellion that ""Saved"" revolves.
Besides Malone and Moore there is Eva Amurri's slut-in-thought and word, rather than deed performance as Cassandra that stands out among all the other fine actors: Mary Louise Parker, for one.
""Saved"" could have been a savage trashing of the New Christian movement but Director Brian Dannelly and writer Michael Urban have chosen instead to temper their film with empathy and intelligence while also pointing out that this subject, though serious and too many very important, is rife with humorous possibilities.",1087084800,,1180,5.119170984455959
2113038,5,B0002OXRSG,"I was so worried about this summer.  The action flicks, the endless mindless sequels.  Finally, there is a film that is funny, poignant, and has a message that is worth hearing.
The people who gave this movie a negative review have either A) never been submerged in the world this movie describes or B) live in that world and are stinging from the criticism.
First off, this movie is NOT making fun of Christianity, unlike what Jerry Falwell says.  Instead it lampoons selfishness in the form of righteousness, bigotry, and religious insulation.  I too have lived in this world where if it's not Christian or endorsed by Jesus Christ, then it's not worthy to own.  Everyone lives in a bubble.  The only music these kids listen to is Christian music, they only read Christian books, they only talk about God's will, they go to a Christian school and only hang out with other Christians, unless they're trying to convert the ""heathens"" and even then, it's only a temporary visit.  However, certain events pop this bubble for our protagonists: Mary's boyfriend discovers his homosexuality and Mary (Jena Malone) herself becomes pregnant.
What I liked about this movie was that, yes, it is stinging criticism for this insulated and bigoted world, but the last half of the movie is a bit sweeter and more poignant.  Mary is outcasted by the popular Christian girls (including Mandy Moore's character) but she is befriended by the ""heathens"" : the only Jewish girl in the Christian school and the handicapped boy who isn't a Christian at all.  I think what angers Jerry Falwell and his followers off the most is that the said heathens possess the traits of Jesus (love, understanding, compassion, forgiveness) and the Christians do not.  In fact, the adult Christians in this film send the ""problem"" children away instead of dealing with the gray areas of life.  As Mary's gay boyfriend says, ""You've kicked us out of our homes, our schools.....where else is there for us to go?""
In short, this is a hilarious and moving picture and has a message that is best summed up by Mary: ""Why would God make us all so different if he wanted us to be the same?""",1087084800,13,2145,4.754716981132075
2113039,2,B0002OXRSG,"I must admit that after reading several positive reviews and seeing several promising trailers of Saved! I was expecting something much less boring and much more funny than what I got.
I was super psyched at the cast in this movie. I adore Jena Malone from her roles in Donnie Darko, The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys, and The United States of Leland. I also am a fan of Patrick Fugit from Spun and of course, Almost Famous. And I mean, who doesn't love Macaulay Caulkin, the beloved brat from Home Alone 1 and 2. But sadly, this promising cast couldn't save a bland and uninvolving script.
I'm not going to even bother retelling the cliched plot line about a high school and the students in it. Saved! is simply a PG-13 teen comedy retold for the 800,954,545th time. This time  satirizing the hypocricy of a conservative Chiristian high school. Saved! is labeled as a dark comedy but i didn't laugh more than a few times. If it's dark comedies you're looking for then check out such gems as the Royal Tenenbaums and Fargo, Saved! is merely a film addressing controversial issues about religion without the dark or the comedy.
In short, the cast is good and seeing Jena Malone for an hour and a half is almost worth the price of admission...almost. But a great movie is judged on how it sticks with you after the credits have rolled and Saved! only left me boggled at how I could've thought it would have been good in the first place.",1086998400,6,1434,4.515384615384615
