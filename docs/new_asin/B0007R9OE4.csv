2238074,5,B0007R9OE4,"I am very happy with my Yoga Mommies DVD -- the session provides enough movement and interaction between myself and my 4 month old son to keep him occupied and content for the most part. And although it is not a particularly complete or challenging yoga workout, the session also provides enough stretching and strengthening to revitalize this mom who can't seem to find the time anymore for real yoga classes. It is a peaceful and fun activity for mom and baby to share, with the added bonus of a tummy massage for baby to aid digestion. Overall, I was pleased with the poses, movements, and relaxation this DVD presents for both myself and my baby.",1152403200,7,650,4.612068965517241
2238075,5,B0007R9OE4,"I'm afraid I have to disagree with the reviewer from Michigan.  I found this DVD to be a wonderful tool for integrating my yoga practice with my baby.  The baby in this DVD seemed very active and the instructor worked around his activity level constantly stressing that it is most important to take care of our baby's needs first and foremost.

If you are looking to resume your yoga practice while bonding with your baby this DVD is for you.  Accompanied by her son, the instructor not so much instructs but guides you through your practice. The soothing music, beauty of the desert, and the inspirational messages will not only transport you away from your worries during your Mommy and Baby yoga session, but will leave you feeling refreshed, empowered, and spiritually connected with your baby.",1139443200,21,798,4.845588235294118
2238076,3,B0007R9OE4,"I had been looking for a DVD that would give me something to do with my extremely active 3 month old. Unfortunately, there is not much to choose from! Mutual activity was first, exercise was second. Yoga Mommies includes the child in the exercise but not as much as I would have liked. The majority of the exercises have your child just sitting on your lap, not participating.",1127174400,39,376,4.544117647058823
8050942,5,B0007R9OE4,"My husband and I are taking care of our new grandbaby for several months.  Our daughter-one-law suggested I do baby yoga with him.  Of course this DVD is ""Mommy & Baby Yoga"" but my grandson and really enjoyed it.",1434499200,,212,4.410256410256411
8050943,5,B0007R9OE4,"This video arrived within the set delivery date, and I couldn't wait to try it out.  It's amazing.  It really helped with my back and neck pain from breastfeeding my baby.  My baby also loves doing it with me, and I liked the fact that there were exercises I could do that center around her (she who loves the spotlight, lol).  Not only did it help stretch out the tension I was feeling and make me more relaxed to deal with everyday challenges, my 7 month old baby who still wasn't sleeping through the night, started sleeping for at least seven straight hours after starting this program.  I would highly recommend this for new moms!",1328572800,2,635,4.48695652173913
8050944,1,B0007R9OE4,I wasn't very happy with this DVD. I think I may have bought it when my son had gotten to old for what they want you to do with your child. Maybe better for a mom with a very young infant.,1230422400,2,188,3.6097560975609757
8050945,5,B0007R9OE4,"I bought this DVD when i was only 2 weeks postpartum.  When I recieved it 2 weeks later (i live overseas...) I was so excited to watch it.  I couldn't do the exercises yet, but i did the baby massage parts of it.  My son LOVED it!  And the meditation portion is wonderful!  After going thru a natural childbirth, then having to stay up in the middle of the night to feed him, the meditations REALLY relaxed me and made me feel so much closer to my baby.",1207267200,2,453,4.1022727272727275
8050946,2,B0007R9OE4,This video was disappointing.  I wanted something that engages my baby a little more.  My baby doesn't placidly lay there like that one in the video.  We need activity!  I also wasn't impressed with the yoga she leads and was looking for something a little more challenging.  Also the part where she does include baby is just awkward with the baby massage included.  It would of been nice to see other moms with babies doing the exercises and other variations of the yoga.  If you are more experienced with yoga and looking for a way to include it in your life with baby try a book and then getting creative.  This video isn't for you.,1206230400,2,635,4.460869565217391
8050947,3,B0007R9OE4,"I practice yoga regularly and did so throughout my pregnancy.  This DVD is fun and good for a short home workout but really not good for the intermediate or more experienced yoga practitioner.  The instructor does not pay much attention to correct form or even explain the poses very well so it would be hard for a beginner to do well.  Some activities (such as lifting the baby up, straight out, and then squatting with the baby) can be very hard on new mommies with compromised lower backs and/or abdominals from cesarean.  As with any home exercise program, you should listen to your body and follow its advice, but I am sure a lot of people feel like they should be able to do everything the way she does--there are no other mommies in the video showing more advanced or more basic modifications to give options. . .I wouldn't buy it again.",1188172800,8,844,4.532894736842105
8050948,5,B0007R9OE4,"My 5 month old daughter and I are enjoying this DVD, there is just the right amount of interaction.  There is also time for her to hang out and play with some toys while I do some of it on my own.  We both appreciate that as she is a very active baby and likes to play..  :)  The location is great to look at for my little girl..  And the music keeps her attention for times as well.  Overall, we are very pleased with this DVD.  :)",1174262400,3,432,3.840909090909091
8050949,4,B0007R9OE4,"This DVD has a section near the beginning that is solely for the infant and the rest is mostly for the mom while keeping the baby entertained.  The workout is only about 30 minutes, but that is just the right amount of time before my three month old gets tired of being on the floor even if I wish it was a little longer.  My four year old also has fun participating.  The focus in this DVD is on all the right places.  There are lots of ab exercises and back stretches along with a good number of arm strengthening poses.  I could do without the positive attitude, you are going to be a good mother speech in the opening meditation.  This is a good DVD to get you back into your practice while incorporating your little one.",1173744000,3,725,4.217391304347826
8050950,5,B0007R9OE4,This DVD was not centered around the presenter and was more instructional with lots of amazing scenery.  The instructor's voice is very soothing and allowed for a relaxed atmosphere for both baby and mommy. My son's demeanor was a lot more relaxed after following the DVD. I found it a great way to start my day ; by connecting with my little one and centering myself for what obstacles I would face that day.,1157068800,4,409,4.527027027027027
8050951,3,B0007R9OE4,"This DVD is a good basic guide to Yoga with your baby, but it stops there.  The baby in this video was a 5 month old, probably the ideal age for performing the few poses in this work out.  I was looking for something a little more extensive and with more direction than what this offered.

The background and music is lovely, and very relaxing.  The few things that I would have liked to see are as follows:

1.  I too, like another reviewer, would have liked to see more integrated activites with the baby. There are only a couple exercises that the instructor shows with the baby not on the mat or sitting in the lap.  I was hoping for something a little more co-active.

2.  While the instructors voice and words are quite lovely, there are many many still shots in the DVD instead of an all over start to finish dynamic work out.  I think that the beginning meditation is an unrealistic amount of time to spend with your baby just sitting and relaxing unless your child is 6 months or younger.

3.  The translation to an older baby is not really present, as I stated previously, it doesn't seem like you can use some of the poses and instruction she offers with a crawling or mobile baby.

All the while, this is a lovely display of editing, music, and visual imagery, it is just lacking a little more depth.  I think that you could find in a book the same kind of instruction, with more extensive poses, such as Baby Om.

Good DVD, solid, lovely, but not quite exceptional.",1155772800,32,1478,4.362637362637362
