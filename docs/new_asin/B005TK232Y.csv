4891784,4,B005TK232Y,"This is an ESPN documentary.  It's really much more about the jockey, Chris Antley, than the horse Charismatic.  It was good, but I was expecting there to be more focus on the horse.",1390953600,2,182,4.484848484848484
4891785,5,B005TK232Y,I THOUGHT IT WAS GREAT BECAUSE I WATCHED CHRIS RIDE SEVERAL TIMES AT SARATOGA RACE TRACK. I ALSO WATCHED CHARISMATIC IN THE DERBY AND PREAKNESS.  I HAVE SEVERAL DVD'S  ON FAMOUS RACE HORSES AND THIS ONE IS A KEEPER.,1372032000,5,215,4.487179487179487
4891786,4,B005TK232Y,"I was a fan of Charismatic during his Triple Crown races and have read ""Three Strides Before the Wire"", about Charismatic's racing campaign.  So when it came time for a DVD of the race series about this wonderful racer, I was happy to get it.  Did Chris Antley spoil Charismatic's chances of winning a Triple Crown but keeping to horse so close to the front in the Belmont?  Was Charismatic just in the bridle?  You will have to come to your own conclusions.  What is certain is that Chris Antley's actions past the wire help to save the horses live so he could go one to a happy Stud career.  What I wish Steve Michaels would have done is to go to Japan and film Charismatic (or get a Japanese crew to film him) in his paddock as he still looks magnificent.
The product arrived in perfect condition.",1358726400,16,800,4.371621621621622
4891787,5,B005TK232Y,Loved the document. It was a suprise to me about the Jockey. I wish I could find more DVD's like this one on Horse Raceing.,1335916800,,123,3.96

4891790,4,B005TK232Y,"I was a big Chris Antley fan and I fell in love with Charismatic during the 1999 Triple Crown season. Their story was so compelling, even before what happened at the Belmont Stakes... but it was the Belmont that really cemented their place together in history. Things certainly didn't turn out the way I thought they would, but I loved them both even more after if was all over... don't want to say more for any newbies who may not know the whole story before watching this. This ESPN film is very good, but I wish it had been a little longer... a lot of interesting little details about both the horse and especially the jockey were left out. Watch this, but also read,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Three-Strides-Before-the-Wire-The-Dark-and-Beautiful-World-of-Horse-Racing/dp/0786886226/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Three Strides Before the Wire: The Dark and Beautiful World of Horse Racing</a>&nbsp;by Elizabeth Mitchell.",1321488000,13,969,5.879432624113475

4891801,5,B005TK232Y,"I thought this was an awesome video. I am an avid horse racing fan. I have always loved the Charismatic/Chris Antley story. I have seen every Kentucky Derby, Preakness & Belmont since I have been alive. I never forgot Charismatic's Belmont & what Chris Antley did to save him. I was so happy when I found out that he was going to be ok & so touched by the story. It was such a shame & waste that Chris destroyed himself with drugs that ultimately cost him his life. I thought I knew the story, but I discovered things in this video that I never knew. I thought this video told a lot of information. I think it was well composed.",1471392000,8,628,4.198347107438017

4891804,5,B005TK232Y,"An honest tribute and the heartbreaking story of Chris Antley, a lovely and extremely talented jockey who fought many demons that ultimately won the battle for his life. I knew him personally, as he often rode horses that belonged to my father early on in his career. I am deeply thankful to Gary Stevens ( one of the greatest jockeys of the 20 and 21st centuries) for his sensitive portrayal of a man I cared for and admired. I firmly believe that he saved Charismatic""s life by his quick action that day of the Belmont and everyone could see that his heart was broken . As Larry Bramledge, one of the greatest horse surgeons in the USA ( who operated on and saved the life of one of our horses) said  ""Horses do breakdown in this sport"",  Many people blamed Chris and Chris most definitely blamed himself. People need to remember that Charismatic survived.",1466294400,17,858,4.564935064935065

8486344,4,B005TK232Y,"More the story of Chris Antley, really.  It is well done and gives a real sense of the life and temptations of a jockey.",1527897600,,120,4.0
8486345,1,B005TK232Y,"This was not what I expected. This is BY FAR no Secretariat or Seabiscuit !!!!! It was more of a study on someone with mental and drug problems. It had almost NOTHING to do with the horse, Charismatic, or horse racing, as there was very little actual horse racing. It was all about the jockey and his drug issues. I consider this DVD to be a waste of my money and time. I did the same thing with this DVD as I did with the movie; Dark Horse. When I finished watching it, I put it back in the case and threw it in the garbage.",1522454400,,525,3.9622641509433962
8486346,1,B005TK232Y,"If I could give this movie a MINUS 5 star rating I would.  I was hoping for a nice horse story; about THE HORSE & his personality and training and shows, etc., etc.  Seems to me it is more about the juvenile actions of the owners than about the horse. I say: don't waste your time.",1516492800,,281,4.0
8486347,5,B005TK232Y,Just as expected. thank you.,1514592000,,28,4.8
8486348,5,B005TK232Y,"Charismatic is in the top five racehorses I absolutely, head-over-heels love - and who knows why we fall in love?. No, he wasn't American Pharoah, or Secretariat (though he had Secretariat as his great-grandfather), but Chari had JUST figured out what to do on the track......and.he broke his legs YARDS from winning the Belmont Stakes, which would've gotten him the first Triple Crown in racing since 1978. Still, with a broken leg, he came in THIRD! Then his jockey, Chris Antley, saved Chari's life by holding Chari's leg till the vet got there. We lost Chris to drugs, and far too young.",1510790400,,591,4.803921568627451
