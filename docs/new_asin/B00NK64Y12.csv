8678764,5,B00NK64Y12,"I watched this film quite by accident this afternoon on HBO LatinoHD. From start to finish, I was mesmerized. It is dramatic and unrelentingly brutal in its depictions of the corruption and violence that is currently endemic in Mexico. A series of interlaced subplots, they are woven together over the course of the film to a very dramatic climax. I was so impressed with this film that I am now going to order it in Bluray from Amazon. If the opportunity arises on any of the cable film channels to view this film, do not hesitate.",1431475200,,532,4.552083333333333
