8202821,3,B000RW5C5O,"For this movie, Jos Daz Morales took Carlos Arniches book (made to film in 1940 ""Que viene mi marido"") and mixed it with ""Ahi esta el detalle"", the result was not so good...

In June 1940 ""Que viene mi marido"" premiers, a very clever comedy of misunderstandings, where a girl has to get married and then become a widow in order to get an inheritance. She loves her boyfriend, so they come up with a plot where she will get married, but with a dying man from the Hospital, that way, she can be a widow and still have time to remarry her original boyfriend and be happy with the money... right? Well... the only problem arises when the ''dying man'' who is Arturo de Crdova, recovers and want his honeymoon! Love is the best medicine after all.

In November 1940 ""Ahi esta el detalle"" premiers where Cantinflas is mistaken for someone who has a lot of kids. He visits his girlfriend (Fraustita) who is the maid, eats a whole chicken in the kitchen. later on, the kids make a mess...

With this ideas, plus whatever came up during the writing process, ""Sobre el muerto las coronas"" is born, now Lzaro (Clavillazo) a good for nothing, poor man, goes to the Hospital due to a common cold. A nurse makes a mistake, everybody thinks he is dying, the girl with the inheritance marries him, he gets well, falls in love with the maid (Dacia), eats a whole chicken in the kitchen, then Amparito with her many kids show up, they make a mess, and so on and so forth..

Nothing new... Well, except Ada Carrasco, maybe, who is great as always...",1316822400,,1530,4.434163701067615
