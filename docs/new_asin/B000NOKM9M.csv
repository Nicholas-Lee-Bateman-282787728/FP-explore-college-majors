My boyfriend's birthday is coming up and i had no idea what to get him. Being that he is a BIG soccer fan and happen to play for Howard for this championship, i was so pumped to find this DVD available! Not bad for a 30 year old game! I can not wait to give it to him- he is going to be so surprised. Thank you amazon!",1506384000,,387,3.8987341772151898
8180253,5,B000NOKM9M,"My husband is a BIG KU fan which is why we ordered this . Plus,it is old and we never dreamed we could find one this good to watch. It is everything they claimed it to be. Very clear and the color is good. We have watched it only once but I am sure we will watch it many more times. As usual, whatever we order thru Amazon.com, comes through for us. We love it. thanks again

8180254,5,B000NOKM9M,"This is very enjoyable, several of the elements in this DVD are not used any more which does show that the quality of the sport is declining rather than improving. Some moves are not attempted now. More is the pity they make really spectacular viewing especially after seeing the drop in expertise in the last Olympic competitions.",1240099200,,331,4.824561403508772
8180255,3,B000NOKM9M,"The game is in it's entirety without commercials. There is no pre or post-game stuff though.  The video quality is so/so, but you probably won't find better since over 20 years ago!

Commentary is from the broadcasters and is good.",1231632000,,231,4.75
