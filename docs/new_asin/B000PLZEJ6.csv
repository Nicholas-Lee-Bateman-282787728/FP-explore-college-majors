2825310,3,B000PLZEJ6,"The DVD is well organized with different scenes and possibility of automatic loop. All scenes have original audio of whatever you are looking at (waterfall, rapids, stream..). I have a 1080p high definition 42"" LCD and unfortunately these footings were compressed not too carefully from HD cameras and artifacts are visible a little everywhere on still objects on the sides of rivers (logs, rocks, plants..). Bottom line is: if you only want to have a peaceful screensaver to look at this DVD is fine, if you want to show off the definition of your TV (HD or not) you will be upset.",1193788800,9,582,4.715686274509804
2825311,5,B000PLZEJ6,These picture/scenery DVDs are just what I was looking for.  treat for the eyes to look away from work and rest on that beautiful scenery.  Stress reliever for sure. Going to have to get a larger TV for in front of the treadmill. So glad I found these. I really like them.,1406937600,4,272,4.211538461538462
2825312,5,B000PLZEJ6,"The photography is great....I love the natural sounds of the flowing waters....I had to watch it a number of times, before I was able to stay awake thru the entire dvd.....I did miss the music option that is on most of Ambient's dvds, but I still found it to be one of my favorite to play over and over again.",1405987200,6,309,4.166666666666667
2825313,3,B000PLZEJ6,Beautiful scenes but the sound is not pleasing.  People walking into the room think the TV is blasting static.  I use these dvds to calm my room of macaws (parrots) and they don't mind noise.  I find that I don't use this dvd much due to the sound.,1405641600,5,248,4.125
2825314,5,B000PLZEJ6,"I can image sitting by the creeks and watching the water flow.
Great video for people who are not able to visit these places.
You can experience the  peace and quietness of getting back to nature.",1395187200,5,196,4.444444444444445
2825315,4,B000PLZEJ6,"relaxing,  Very nice,  I bought a RAIN dvd but had to return it cause I hated it , So I bought this creek DVD and like it a lot, Nice sounds of water and views of rivers, creeks and little waterfalls",1386547200,3,199,3.8292682926829267
2825316,4,B000PLZEJ6,"I like the creek and forest scenes. A lot of videos will go through so quickly from one scene to the next, making you feel ""rushed"". I prefer the length of these scenes, like you are actually sitting there deep in thought.",1379721600,9,222,4.309523809523809
2825317,5,B000PLZEJ6,Just what I need in these stressful times we live in.....magnificent sights and it's so nice to hear the natural sounds of nature......wish I was actually there in person.....will be ordering more in the future......much more!,1377216000,6,226,5.305555555555555
2825318,5,B000PLZEJ6,"UPDATE:  Still love this DVD and every time I play it when I have company over they always comment on it, and want to write down the name of it!  I also have the Nature's Alarm Clock DVD that I love to put on in the mornings when I wake up :)
I started watching these types of videos on youtube for free, but my computer is small and the commercials are annoying.  Then I found this DVD and thought it is a little expensive, but worth the try.  I love it soooo much!  It is real films not something just looped over and over.  One of the creeks even has birds singing in the background.  It really relaxes me and puts me in a better mood.  It looks amazing on our 55"" tv and seems to be hi-def.  I can't wait to have a party and put it on in the background.  My toddler son loves it too.  Some of the scenes have birds and ducks in them and my son especially loves those :)  I'm going to order more of these right now... I'm sold on this guy's videos!!!!!",1375574400,3,955,3.9424083769633507
2825319,3,B000PLZEJ6,"They are great DVDs, I bought Rainforest Creeks, Clouds and Rain, there are a lot of great scenes and most of the scenes are good.

When I bought nature scenes I was only planning to add sound tracks recorded by me (recitations), translation and then uploaded them to youtube not for a commerical use. just like this video [...] And to refer to Tony Helsloot as the producer of the videos.

Even though, I can use the nature video streams which available online without buying them, but appreciating and supporting the hard work I decided to buy them and paid $57.85 however I am very very shocked when I read the warning in the DVD case I already paid so to use them legally.

What the meaning of buying them, if I can not use them, I really feel aggrieved. I am seriously thinking of returning them, unfortunatly.

I appreciate any resonable solution or recommendation DVDs that suite my case.",1348185600,,895,4.575
2825320,5,B000PLZEJ6,"I am a collector of nature and relaxation DVDs, as I prefer to have these on as background when I read and write. I own one or more titles from just about every series ever released, but Isis Visuals has the largest selection of scenery and the most professionally produced titles of any series I've seen or experienced.  I look to reviews form others before I buy when possible so that I know what I;m getting.  Whn people don;t understand that they've bought a title that has no narrative or history, it's frustrating and lowers the review stars for a producer that has delivered what some of us want.

Rainforest Creeks is my favorite title in the Ambient Collection.  The natural beauty of the filmed area is heavenly.  The trees and foliage are so green, it's like being there, and the water is clear and clean.  You can almost feel the dampness in the air.  The camera work is stunning, and not too fast or too slow like other series.  The transition between scenes is natural.  There are a few scenes that show the moss and greenery in the water, and the visual effect is stunning.

I can only image the amount of production work that goes into each title.  It is difficult to find unspoiled nature scenes to film in an uninterrupted sequence, and must be even harder to capture the images without noise interference from man's busy life happening around these areas.  The cinematography is of high quality, and not grainy or clumsy in scene transition as many disappointing purchases of my past have proven.  I always know I'm getting a quality product from this company.  Look for their other titles, some which have music and/or natuire sound options, and you can just about choose to enjoy any type of environment imaginable.",1296259200,20,1736,4.667763157894737
8192354,5,B000PLZEJ6,Another great addition to my Ambient Collection of DVDs.  Vivid color and sharp picture.  Lovely and peaceful scenes.,1506124800,,117,5.444444444444445
8192355,5,B000PLZEJ6,"I really do love it and as you can see so do others, can't go wrong if so many like it.
One thing, yeah there's always a but, the disc has three sets of videos to choose from-
1-Rainforest creeks -with 4 creeks to choose from, or it will play all in sequence.
2- Forest Flow - that cycles through at least 27+ scenes of small forest creeks, rushing waters, a number of falls, some through the water to watch the plants swaying so serenely, and a number of nice picturesque distance views.so much more than one would expect, I do wish that one could choose from one and replay it as an individual scene. The shorts are so well composed that you would never experience these views first hand.
3- Soothing Scenes - That also cycle through a number of visually lovely videos.
A great way to use these is to use them, with the volume low, as a background to a friendly-get-together of friends while having a conversation.
Well worth the modest cost.",1489449600,,944,4.4

8192361,5,B000PLZEJ6,"Wonderful disk.  Not your typical ""3 minutes of video and it loops"" DVD.  Each segment lasts a long time and you always have a chance to see something different each time you watch.  Will definitely buy others.",1421020800,2,210,4.621621621621622
