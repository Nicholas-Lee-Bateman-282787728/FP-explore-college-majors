I have had quite a few exercise dvds in the past and none of them have been of much help to me, this is the first one that has helped me get results and also kept my attention as i lost interest with the ones in the past because they became repetitive. In this dvd you are shown and told in detail how to do the exercises properly, it has so much information and exercises that each time you look at it you learn something new so that it never becomes repetitive. I love the way you can encorporate exercises into your daily life from beginner to advanced and you don't require expensive gym equipment to acheive results, i love the exercises that you can do on steps and stairs, which i do at home everyday when i am going up and down the stairs doing chores and also the information on diet and lifestyle which has been very beneficial for me and helped me to lose weight when before i couldn't lose it. This dvd has been a God send for me and i'm sure it will be for other people too.",1362873600,,1074,4.119047619047619
