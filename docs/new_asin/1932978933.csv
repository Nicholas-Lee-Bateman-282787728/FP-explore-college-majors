8570874,2,1932978933,This is a really well produced DVD and includes some great techniques. BUT it DOES NOT tie in a wing! This was an incredibly rude surprise considering the tying of the wing is the most critical part of full dress flies. Went into elaborate detail on so many other aspects it was just a TOTAL letdown not seeing a single wing tied in. Lame. Sorry. Fail.,1265068800,2,352,4.348484848484849
