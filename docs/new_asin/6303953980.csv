7857257,4,6303953980,"Wrote a full review here: http://www.fandompost.com/2014/09/19/dallos-complete-collection-anime-dvd-review/ But here's a couple points from it:

Audio:
The audio sounds good in Japanese stereo 2.0. No distortions here. Oh, and no, the English dub from years past isn't present on this release. (It wouldnt fit anyway.)

Video:
As this is the very first OAV ever created, the picture still holds up The cel animation holds up fine and colors are vibrant and steady. The nuances of old-school sketch-line animation are still fun to watch. The subtitles are colored and detailed appropriately, which makes them easy to read as needed.

Extras:
The pilot movie is an interesting history about how man emigrated to space following some of the real-life developments in space exploration. It talks of generations building various mining areas and terraforming some sections of Earths moon. It speaks to eventually descendants wondering why they're working for a world theyve never seen as well as the mystery of one station theyve built up.

The Remembering Dallos segment has a lot of info from director Mamorou Oshii and the animation and production team. We come to learn how they decided to do an anime straight for the home video market with the conscious decision not to make anything with higher production quality than theatrical films so as not to hurt that industry. Its an 18 minute video that is very fascinating material for animation junkies.

In Summary:
Dallos is a decent series but not a great one by any stretch. For a historical prospect, this is a very solid release to have in wanting to learn how anime progressed and evolved for artistic techniques and economic profitability during the 80s. On its own merits, Dallos couldve used a re-write during production to clean up a couple screenplay issues, but its still enjoyable for nostalgia of 80s anime style at least in order to understand how the OAV format began to gain traction and viability. Therefore, I do recommend grabbing it when you can.",1450742400,,2015,5.112462006079028
7857258,5,6303953980,"My childhood movie, I finally have it to watch as much as I want!",1444176000,,65,3.7142857142857144
7857259,5,6303953980,"Dallos is by far one of the most impressive and underappreciated gems to fly under the radar. It's gotten no promotion or advertising from Discotek. I was completely unaware of it's release and sales have been subtle to say the least. However this is instantly a recommendation to anyone. This will be one of those titles that go 'Out of Print' and fetch a lot of money in the future from collector's.

For starters the character designs are done by Toshiyasu Okada. This is the same artist that did the Area 88 OVA from 1985. This is why the main character Shun resembles Shinji and the hair is a dead give away. Mamoru Oshii, famous for directing classics such as Ghost in the Shell, Patlabor, Angel's Egg, Twilight Q and Urusei Yatsura: Beautiful Dreamer, is the lead co-director on this piece of work. Oshii is famous for his ambitious, always intrinsically complex storyline telling which demands viewers to scratch their heads and go back for repeat viewers to notice more content, details and undertones. Oshii is simply considered one of the best director's of all time. Dallos being one of his earliest forays, clearly shows some of his genius unfolding in this ambitious project.

Dallos was originally supposed to be a long, successful TV series but the funding got cut mid-way as more advertisers were not secured. The rest of the show, in an almost identical fashion to Megazone 23, could not be animated for this reason. Therefore the first 4 story arcs were bridged together and it was spun together as the very first ever direct to video anime release in Japan. Thus a new type of industry was born but Dallos was the first, it would be later works like Megazone 23 that catapult this style of release into super stardom and the OVA boom period of the 80's would leave an everlasting etch of a golden age and period.

Dallos is a beautiful piece of animated beauty to look at. It's designs and setting are easily recognisable and nothing looks close to it's idiosyncratic beauty. Show any fan a piece of imagery from it and most fans that have seen the show can name it. This is one of the best trends of the 80's period, is that no two shows ever look the same. Being an obsessive anime fan, this adds to it's historical value.

The story is not surprisingly, a very layered and complex space opera about the clash of idealism and seeking to uncover the hope and mysteries that surround the moon, while dealing with a tyrannical and oppressive regime. Will it spill over into civil war as they try to unlock the answers? The story is split over four OVA episodes, each with their own cliffhanger. The last will be the most bitter sweet as only our vivid and constructive imaginations can foresee the possible continuations.

Now for the technical details. The DVD uses the remastered telecline print from the Japanese release in 2004. All the extras have been retained and you will have two subtitled documentaries to watch called 'Remembering Dallos 1983-2003' and the 'Pilot film'. Oshii does speak and gives his insights into his early work. The original 4:3 aspect ratio is retained. No artificial cropping has been done to the mastering. Sound is in Dolby Digital Stereo and is remastered as well for the Japanese track which includes fully translated, English subtitles. Those that may have had a Hong Kong bootleg taken from an old unremastered Laserdisc source with terrible Engrish translations, can retire it happily at last.

Lastly, the English dub is not present for two good reasons. Firstly the Dub was edited down to 83 minutes, losing 40 minutes of content. This show was marketed at a younger audience in 1991 so a lot of the harsh, political content and sophisticated themes were taken out. Also secondly the dub was outsourced by a cheap Hong Kong company and the voice acting is pretty bad to say the least. Since sales of this Japanese with English subtitles release have been low up to now, I can't imagine Discotek taking a chance and authoring a separate remastered, dubbed release since it would mean matching up frames and splicing out content.

In conclusion, this is an essential purchase for any fan that values extremely engrossing, gripping and captivating stories with a affinity for space opera's like Legend of the Galactic Heroes or Gundam Zeta. If you have obvious titles in your collection like Akira and still treasure it's last impression on you then it's time for another dose of exquisite, vintage, delights of the past. Your mysterious journey awaits.

7857262,3,6303953980,"DALLOS (1983) is the 83-minute cut of the four-episode series which constituted Japan's first OAV (Original Animation Video). It was directed by Mamoru Oshii who went on to do PATLABOR MOBILE POLICE, both the original OAV series and the two feature film versions, PATLABOR - THE MOBILE POLICE 1 and PATLABOR 2, as well as the 1995 sci-fi anime classic, GHOST IN THE SHELL.
DALLOS tells a story of armed resistance by worker colonists on the moon against a repressive Earth-backed government. In a strategy that foreshadows PATLABOR, the rebels use construction and mining equipment as weapons against the security forces. The main character is a teenaged boy, Shun, who is taken under the wing of the rebel leader and joins their cause, despite the opposition of his family. Dallos itself is a massive technological structure worshipped by the colonists. Its origin and purpose are unknown but when it's attacked, it comes to defensive life, firing off a series of laser beams at all combatants occupying its interior.
The character animation is somewhat simple and relatively crude, by Oshii's later standards, but the production design is spectacularly rendered, encompassing the sprawling city of Monopolis, the massive interiors of Dallos and other moonscapes, robot combat vehicles, spacecraft, and mining equipment. In addition, some of the battles are quite breathtaking, with fast action and sharp detail, rivaling similar battles in other anime space sagas such as ""Mobile Suit Gundam"" and ""Robotech.""
The U.S. dub is 83 minutes, 37 minutes shorter than the Japanese feature-length compilation of the original four-part series. Many dialogue scenes are cut which might have given key background information about the characters. Action scenes are shortened as well and bits of gore are excised. The English dub job is unusually poor. A new release would be most welcome, with a new dub and an alternate Japanese track with English subtitles.",1026604800,10,1950,5.273311897106109
