8021475,5,B00023P4AG,I am a fan of this series so I have nothing bad to say about any of the seasons! This set is great to get someone started in a DVD collection or to give to someone who has a good sense of humor!,1173571200,,194,3.5348837209302326
8021476,4,B00023P4AG,"If you are a fan of South Park, you will probably not be satisfied with one or two seasons on DVD, so count on getting each season.  This set is great for those who have not purchased any of the DVDs yet.  It includes each season release to date from the classic first episodes through the season that introduces Timmy and the fourth grade teacher Miss Choksondik.  The biggest complaints about these DVDs are the annoying (first two seasons) or lack of (third and fourth seasons) extras.  I, however, would rather have the seasons come out quickly without tons of extras than to have to wait long periods for each to be released with loads of extras I will probably never get around to watching (i.e. The Simpsons).  The one problem I have with this set is the price.  Even at the discount, each set is 40 dollars! Shopping around, even at your local stores, you can probably find these DVDs in the mid 30 dollar range.  Shop around a little more, and you will no doubt uncover even better deals.  It seems to me that if you are going to buy all four seasons at the same time you should get a substantial discount.  These DVDs (especially the first two seasons and the fourth season, as I think the third season is a little weak) are worth it, but if you have waited this long to buy these at least shop around.  You may save enough to buy season five!",1092614400,41,1353,4.354581673306773
