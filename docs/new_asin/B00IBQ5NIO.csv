6256597,5,B00IBQ5NIO,"I wasn't sure if I would like this, as Bruce only performs at the end. There are great covers of his songs here, I really enjoyed watching the entire tribute concert. Awesome Blu-ray picture and sound quality.",1396656000,8,209,4.675675675675675
6256598,5,B00IBQ5NIO,"This was a great show and I'm so glad that they made it available for us fans.  Several wonderful version of Bruce's songs, the Boss himself doing a few songs and we hear his wonderful acceptance speech.  Lots of fun.",1396569600,8,217,4.4
6256599,5,B00IBQ5NIO,"I haven't seen 1 comment yet about Neil Young. He serves a very, very angry jagged dragging chains across the stage during Born In the USA sounding like Alice In Chains. Point made....",1396310400,,184,4.606060606060606
6256600,5,B00IBQ5NIO,"This is a set of some very cool Springsteen covers, with Bruce of course finishing the show by himself. Great stuf!! Quality of the blu-ray audio and video is also very high! We need more HD Springsteen blu-rays!",1396051200,19,212,4.605263157894737

6256602,3,B00IBQ5NIO,"Ghost of Tom Joad is the Standout Cover. Alabama Shakes were unique, interesting, and impressive.

Random Thought : Tim McGraw should be playing at rodeos, not tributes.

Mostly, a great group of musicians, minus McGraw, & the washed-up Elton John, who should have retired after 'Empty Garden' 35 years ago, but the biggest blunder is actually allowing the fat cats into the building in the first place. Even Bruce tried to get them going by exclaiming 'C'mon, Rich People!'.

Also, Jon Stewart needs to stick to jokes, & not embarrass himself by partaking/singing in the closer. Before you all criticize, ask yourself, did Richard Pryor sing harmony vocals at Marvin Gaye tributes? Did Lenny Bruce sing backup vocals at love-ins for Elvis?

Bottom line, Bruce has still got it. Nobody can touch him as a live performer. Perhaps the greatest singer/songwriter in Rock 'N Roll, EVER.",1395792000,7,882,5.02054794520548
6256603,2,B00IBQ5NIO,"As Larry David says - pretty, pretty, pretty...boring. A few worthwhile tracks. So many pedestrian, slick, watered down pop versions. Faith Hill and the McGraw dude still sporting that stupid hat? Puhleeze.

6256628,4,B00IBQ5NIO,"Some great covers by giants. Undeniably great music by a genius. I couldn't help watching it tonight, noticing in the audience more than one billionaire architect of the financial crisis, massively over-nourished porcine either physically or mentally, bailed out by the US taxpayer, fattening their wallets on the suffering of so many, and spending some miniscule fraction of that ill gotten gain on ""charity"" so they could sit and watch a great show of music written by the Boss, who sings of the common man, rocking out to make hundreds of millions. But, at least he does right, as anyone who makes money from the public should, giving back to all those average people spending their money for his music. Bruce sings of the workingman's plight, a guy who has been a millionaire since he was 19 or 20, whose daughter rides horses that cost $4-10 million a piece to try to get a spot in the Olympics alongside other daughters of billionaires who share expensive riding skills, but rise to the top because of the training and skill of the animals their fathers' money has bought. But, separate the man who lives like a tycoon from the tycoons who sit in the audience, because he creates something - joy and beauty and meaning - while they just pillage the financial system and by off the regulators who are supposed to stop them. As he says on the stage ""we are the wrong people"" - but musicians are not... while some in his audience that night were",1428192000,,1448,4.638132295719845

6256649,5,B00IBQ5NIO,"The wife and I caught this when it premiered on PBS a couple of weeks before the holidays and were instantly mesmerized by the performances.  Being a casual Bruce fan, I was not readily familiar with some of the songs, but wow, what a show!

Alabama Shakes, Brittany is amazing.  Ben Harper & Natalie Maines, haunting.  Jackson Brown and Tom Morello totally destroy American Skin (41 Shots.)  I have no idea who Juanes is but the Spanglish Hungry Heart rocks.  Elton John, Sting, Patti Smith, Zac Brown, Kenny Chesney, Tim McGraw, Faith Hill, Emmylou Harris, John Legend, Neil Young AND Bruce & the bandwhat more can you say?

The BluRay made an excellent stocking stuffer and is our new audio demo disc for the home theater.

You could tell he was moved by this whole thing and humbled by the attention! I also bought another as a gift.,1418256000,3,285,4.2
6256654,5,B00IBQ5NIO,"This is a fantastic tribute. From Jon Stewart's comedy to some AMAZING covers from big names in the industry. Highlights include Mumford & Son's melodic ""I'm on Fire"" and Kenny Chesney's solo acoustic rendition of ""One Step Up"" (a song he's covered years ago. Tim McGraw & Faith Hill's version of ""Tougher than the Rest"" is also noteworthy, although Faith doesn't get a chance to sing lead.",1417219200,2,390,4.835820895522388

6256657,2,B00IBQ5NIO,"Much like Springsteen's Kennedy Center Honors tribute this collection of talent covering his songs succeed at doing one thing and one thing only and that is highlighting the one element integral to a good Springsteen song, Springsteen himself. This is never more apparent than when after sitting through dull, passionless covers of great songs (with a few exceptions) stacked between ample camera shots of rich, old liberals sitting at their finely appointed tables, Springsteen himself takes the stage. His speech is eloquent, down to earth and charming and he rightly characterizes the proceedings as a wedding party or ultimate bar mitzvah. He says, ""Gimme that guitar!"" and then implores the wrinkled moneyed crowd to stand up and move in close and then launches into a set that finally gets this pathetic, self-satisfied bunch moving. Ironically Springsteen chooses two terrific populist cuts from Wrecking Ball to begin the set and it is more than sad to see all the white privilege  finally jumping up and down to the angry and unjust lyrics of Death to My Hometown. Springsteen has aged and his peers have aged too, if not as well but some of his best music is still young with an angry and rebellious sensibility speaking for regular people. It plays poorly in these types of settings. Springsteen is plenty rich enough to be comfortable in this crowd but the heart of his music does not fit well with them at all. Host Jon Stewart seems to sense this dynamic and plays on it for laughs. Sting, Elton John, Kenny Chesney, Tim McGraw and Faith Hill are standouts and Neil Young and Crazy Horse do well by Born in the USA. A Spanish version of Hungry Heart is interesting but the rest are only serviceable and none but Alabama Shakes really memorable. Ben Harper and Charley Musselwhite  are completely wasted with Natalie Maines and Jackson (The Pretender) Browne does a weak and pasty '41 Shots' that even Tom Morello cannot save. I hate to imagine what this show would be without Tom Morello bringing some actual Rock and Roll attitude to the proceedings but the inclusion of Alabama Shakes is this programs one saving grace. They were terrific! It would have been much more interesting to see what a mix of young bands and vocalists might have done with these truly great songs or any number of lesser known fantastic songs from Bruce's catalog.  All that being said 'Glory Days' was a perfect closer for the artists gathered around him. Get this only if you are a Springsteenologist otherwise pass it up.",1416182400,6,2516,4.832946635730859
6256658,5,B00IBQ5NIO,"I bought this blu-ray having no expectations at all. I am just a long time Bruce fan somewhat disappointed by the way his career has turned. I played this show and I was hooked since the very beginning. I will admit I usually like covers, and in this case, I did like absolutely all of the tracks. Most of them are 4 stars or higher, and for my personal taste, the only two things I did not like that much were Emmylou Harris 'My Hometown,' and Mavis Staples singing in 'My City of Ruins' (the song, though, is top notch with a great Zac Brown and a very powerful gospel choir and excellent instrumentation throughout). I am sure every viewer will have his/her own picks. For me, the better moments of the night were Patti Smith's 'Because the Night' (so full of emotion, and beautifully sung), Mumford & Sons' 'I'm on Fire' (what a surprise, and what a great quartet these guys are!), Tom Morello & Jim James' 'The Ghost of Tom Joad' (I just LOVE Morello!!!!!). I also enjoyed Kenny Chesney's 'One Step Up' (that song is one of my personal favorites, and he did a great job!), and Juanes' 'Hungry Heart' (I was really surprised how he mixed Spanish and English, and the great rhythm he gave to the song hit). I was not very happy with Neil Young's 'Born in the U.S.A.' version, but I guess people think otherwise, considering the reaction (by the way, it is so freaking funny to see Neil Young 'playing' drums at the very end of the show, with the 'Glory Days' cast ensemble version!).
Because this was a TV show, you get the talking, the Springsteen reactions to his songs (this is very well captured, priceless for example when Patti Smith was on stage), and Bruce's speech, which I knew thanks to youtube and that you can have here for ever. A very good indeed speech Boss!
I give this 4.5 stars without hesitation, and I recommend it to anybody who likes Bruce or rock concerts.",1416096000,6,1883,4.460869565217391

What is really interesting is that lots of the artists are country artists which reinforces the breadth and depth of Bruce's audience and fans. Well worth buying just to hear his speech LOL. Give the man a guitar and he is a god, but as a public speaker it's a hoot.

Highly recommended for anyone who loves good music.",1399334400,7,573,4.296296296296297
6256688,2,B00IBQ5NIO,"I was somewhat disappointed.  There were too many of his more obscure songs performed, and not enough of his hits. Most of the performances I wouldn't watch twice, including some done by Bruce and the E Street Band.",1399334400,2,215,4.657894736842105
6256689,5,B00IBQ5NIO,Hearing other artists perform Bruce's songs made me realize what a great artist he is. This is a fabulous DVD and I enjoy watching it over and over.,1399334400,,148,4.321428571428571
6256690,5,B00IBQ5NIO,"While I would much rather listen to Bruce Springsteen doing Bruce Springsteen songs, the collection of covers here is fantastic!  The BluRay video and audio quality is off the charts, too.  While a few of the performances are FF-worthy, others have been repeated over and over.",1399161600,,277,5.0
6256691,5,B00IBQ5NIO,A nice heartfelt tribute with some excellent covers of Bruce songs plus a great speech by the man himself .,1399075200,,107,4.4
6256692,5,B00IBQ5NIO,Had a lot of solo acoustic very early in his career . Also it featured his interactions with the crowd which gave a great insight into his personality.,1399075200,,151,4.428571428571429
6256693,5,B00IBQ5NIO,"Not always a fan of tributes but this one was well thought through. Some interpretations that truly open your eyes to the incredible strength of these songs apart from Bruce's performance. Bringing in several country players showed influences I wonder if he was even aware of. And John Legend knocked me out (once again not one of my ""go to""  guys although I always enjoy him. As usual John Stewart was spot on and kept it moving. Bruce and families reactions were wonderful.",1398988800,3,475,4.72289156626506
6256694,5,B00IBQ5NIO,"This 2013 tribute to Bruce Springsteen seems almost more revelant because of ""High Hopes"" today than last year. The performances are electric. Jackson Browne and Tom Morello performing ""American Skin (41 shots), Morello's own performance of ""the Ghost of Tom Joad"" has evolved, there is a new ending that takes all the fire of previous performances and adds a slight variation to let the listener come down more gently. Neil Young and Crazy Horse burn down ""Born in the USA"", reminding us Crazy Horse can sing and Neil just goes off on his guitar like no one alive today can do! If you've ever liked anything from Bruce before this Tribute will greatly satisfy. Patti Smith's ""Because the Nightl is worth it alone! Place your order now!",1398816000,3,736,4.803149606299213
6256695,5,B00IBQ5NIO,Fun to hear other artists version of Bruces songs and see how Bruce enjoy their performances. A musthave to your collection.,1398816000,,124,4.9523809523809526

6256698,5,B00IBQ5NIO,"Great from the start to the end of it, low point? For me it was probably juanes (hes ok he just messed the song with his voice a bit) and maybe jackson browne who i totally admire but his presentation here does not get the energy needed, high points go to the alabama shakes, jim james and tom, sting... Completely worth watching from beginning to end!",1398643200,,352,4.348484848484849
6256699,5,B00IBQ5NIO,"Awesome show for any music fan, excellent sound!  A great way to remind you of Bruce Springsteen's fantastic hits over the years performed by an array of incredible musicians and singers. Some of my favorites are Mumford & Sons ""I'm on Fire,"" Kenny Chesney ""One Step Up,"" Elton John ""Streets of Philadelphia,"" and Tom Morello & Jim James ""The Ghost of Tom Joad.""  Neil Young & Crazy Horse do ""Born in the USA"" which is absolutely hilarious! I can't keep from laughing (the cheerleaders crack me up), to much fun.",1398556800,,512,4.677777777777778

6256702,5,B00IBQ5NIO,Love this video and have already played it about four times.  It's just the best of Bruce who never disappoints.,1398124800,,112,4.6
6256703,5,B00IBQ5NIO,The performances in this DVD are awesome. Loved it! The depth of the talent on display is unforgettable. Must watch.,1397865600,,116,4.85
6256704,5,B00IBQ5NIO,"I really enjoyed this Blu-ray of the MusiCares' over two hour tribute to The Boss. In addition to the tributes, you get five songs performed by Bruce. What more can you ask for? The performances by Neil Young, Sting, Jackson Browne, Alabama Shakes, Zac Brown, Emmylou Harris, Elton John and Tom Morello are my favorites after Bruce's.",1397779200,,334,4.87719298245614
6256705,5,B00IBQ5NIO,"The quality of the video and audio is astonishing. Very good engineering. The content is some of the finest blues, rock, country, and folk all in one wrapper. Springsteen does what he does best: taking hold of a crowd with humility and hard work. I especially liked the band constantly evolving with a variety of faces. Jackson Browne was wonderful, demonstrating a bombastic array of talents.",1397606400,,393,4.96969696969697

6256707,5,B00IBQ5NIO,"Some of the highlights of the tributes include: Alabama Shakes opening the show with a blistering note-perfect rendition of ""Adam Raised a Cain"". Elton John on ""Streets of Philadelphia"". John Legend on ""Dancing in the Dark"". And probably the best performance is Tom Morello and Jim James on ""The Ghost of Tom Joad"". Absolutely incredible guitar work.

And then of course, there's Bruce's speech and four great songs by the boss!",1397520000,,428,5.028169014084507
6256708,4,B00IBQ5NIO,"This was much better than I thought it'd be. Usually, these sort of things fall flat and kind of uncomfortable. The performances are pretty damn good, and well-mixed. I especially loved 'I'm On Fire' which really was stark and beautiful in a different way than the original. The highlight, though, for me, was Bruce's fantastic speech, which was funny, irreverent, soulful, and completely inspiring.",1397433600,2,399,5.25
6256709,5,B00IBQ5NIO,"Great sound quality, great performances, great video quality as well.

Some of the boss's songs that I didn't like, these artists have made it sound better. Must have.",1397433600,,167,4.964285714285714
6256710,5,B00IBQ5NIO,"Fantastic event honoring Bruce as the MusicCares Person of the Year.  Great performances by Patti Smith (of course), Tim McGraw and Faith Hill (suprisingly excellent), Neil Young (beyond description), and Kenny Chesney, who sings One Step Up better than Bruce himself.  (You can see Bruce saying ""Beautiful"" after Kenny ends.)  The only flaw in the evening is Emmylou Harris, who apparently couldn't be bothered to learn the words of My Hometown.  Really, Emmylou, I was hugely disappointed in you.

An essential addition to any Springsteen fan's library.",1397347200,,555,5.333333333333333

 There were so many different styles of talented artists, honoring a great musician.
 This is a ""must-have"" for true Bruuuuuce fans!",1397174400,,157,5.24
6256712,5,B00IBQ5NIO,"I am a huge Springsteen fan.  I honestly did not think any other singers could do justice to his work, but this proves me wrong.  The songs were well matched to the singers, was very well done and topped off by having the Boss perform at the end; and to see him get honored with his wife, mother and daughter present was special.",1396915200,7,329,4.2063492063492065

I think we've all enjoyed Patti Smith's version of ""Because the Night"" but I really loved hearing rock, country, and gospel interpretations from Elton John, Mumford and Sons, Sting, Emmylou Harris, Tim McGraw and Faith Hill, Mavis Staples and a host of others. All in all really enjoyable for music fans.",1468972800,,463,4.8734177215189876
