8000874,5,B0000DG058,"Domingo, Domingo, Domingo...what an incredible singer and actor. I've seen the other two Othellos and they are both marvellous. It's incredible how consistently good Domingo is in all three performances. This is definitely a great version to have in your opera collection. Personally, this is my favorite because I really like the way Barbara Frittoli portrays Desdemona. Her Desdemona is defiant and strong. Frittoli has terrific dramatic instincts and is a beautiful lady too. Frittoli plays Desdemona in an ever-increasing state of shock and disbelief which is far more credible than timid Desdemonas popularized by other sopranos. Watch the scene where Othello orders her to ""cry"" and down to the ground. Frittoli's Desdemona fights her pride and very reluctantly lies face down in the slime. In such a humiliating scene, Desdemona still retains her dignity. Now that's great acting! Frittoli definitely can be the next superstar soprano. Her voice is big and ripe - a gorgeous lyric spinto. I thought the costumes and sets were very nicely done.  I'm not as interested in set design - ultimately, it's about the music! Highly recommended!",1203033600,12,1143,5.245901639344262
8000875,4,B0000DG058,"A terrific production with riveting performances from Domingo and Frittoli. The Iago is penny-plain but the whole performance gave much pleasure. Obviously the Scala audience thought so too!

Well worth the price!",1155772800,5,213,5.65625
8000876,5,B0000DG058,"I have seen all four Domingo's Otello DVDs (this, Zeffirelli film version, Covent Garden, and Met).  I can safely say this is overall the best.

  The high quality of the performance is apparent from the opening storm scene.  La Scala chorus and Muti's conducting are electrifying here.  Muti whipped the ""storm"" into such a frenzy that one fears for the lives of those on the ship.  In fact, I have never enjoyed the entire first act more.

  Domingo is once again a phenomenal Moor.  He sings like a man half of his age!  His timber is secure and dark with a ringing top.  Nucci is a true Verdian baritone.  His Iago is nasty and brutal.  Barbara Frittoli is not a submissive, soft, weak, weeping willow Desdemona that has been popularized by the likes of Te Kanawa, Fleming and Freni.  This is a woman who challenges social conventions, and is not afraid to die for love.

  Graham Vick's stage direction is right on the money.  In the scene where Otello hides and eavesdrops on Cassio behind a partition (as in tradition), Vick has Domingo descend the stage which has been lifted up for the purpose.  This underscores the subhuman state that jealousy has reduced Otello into.  A masterstroke!

  The performance is captured in rich color and Dolby digital 5.1 surround sound.  I will be playing this DVD again and again for years to come.",1125187200,27,1342,4.652360515021459
8000877,4,B0000DG058,"This could be Domingo's last Otello, and for that alone, it is worth to have.
Is is better than previous ones? (i.e. Solti's at Covent Garden), well No and definitely not and this for many reasons.
This Otello has been recorded at la Scala in December 2001. To start, La Scala's directions falls far behind Covent Garden's in every aspect. The sets are monotoneous and really boring.
Frittoli's desdemona can't really be compared to Te Kanawa's. Frittoli is really an excellent actress, and also has a nice voice but it just couldn't fit well in here. It is said that her Desdemona at the Met was a success, but it wasn't as good in here.
Nucci's Iago is very nice. He sings like a true Verdian, getting away from all the vulgarity most Iagos follow. With age, he got a darker and darker voice which he uses nicely in this production.
Muti's Otello is one of the most exciting I have ever heard.
And now Domingo, with what has been said his last Otello (at 60 years old). Is he better than he was in Covent Garden about 10 years ago, well definitely not. He sings very quickly at high notes and tries to go slowly most of the time. Is this because of the age, well probably not. It just turned out that during these La Scala performances, he just wasn't at his best. At one performance he had to stop after Ora e per Sempre and excused himself to the audiance, and then had to cancel another performance. Despite all that, his rendition of Otello here is MAJESTIC. He owns the stage. Every ""move"" is exciting, and despite a rather hard 2nd act, he delivers extremely beautiful 3d and 4th act. His ""Niun me Tema"" is one of the most beautiful and most sincere in record.
To sum up, if you ever need an Otello on DVD, I would first recommend Domingo at Covent Garden and then at La Scala. Vicker's movie with Karajan has horrible syncro and acting, but very nice musically and some cuts.",1080086400,19,1884,4.416666666666667
