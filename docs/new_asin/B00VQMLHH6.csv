8710887,4,B00VQMLHH6,"This 1968 daily talk-show focused on one topical theme per episode. Joan would do an opening monologue based on that day's theme.  Guests would include an expert on that day's subject as well as a celebrity guest. Taking on serious topics makes for a bit of a dry show and not as entertaining as her much-later FOX talk show.
While the show only ran for one year, airing on a daily schedule created a whopping 255 episodes.
Produced by Trans-Lux Television (importers of the Speed Racer Anime TV show) and Joan's husband Edgar Rosenberg.  Jim Perry was the announcer.  WNBC-TV in New York City was the production facility for this syndicated show.

These half-hour shows are in COLOR even though a B&W photo is used for the box cover.

Like other Topics releases, the packaging is flimsy & terrible.  The cardboard box is held together by tape, which you have to cut to open.
Inside you will find 4 discs slid into cardboard sleeves, easy to scratch.  Topics calls this ""Dust Free packaging"" but it is beyond me how these open cardboard sleeves can keep out dust.",1432425600,26,2514,4.389247311827957
