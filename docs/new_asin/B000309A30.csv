Candy Christmas does an awesome job on ""Lord Send Your Angels"" (will make just about anyone cry!) and Sandi Patti takes the cake with ""My God Is Real!!!"" Just an awesome video that will make any Southern Gospel lover want to jump to their feet! They really made this video fun to watch and touching as well. If you love the ""Homecoming Videos"" you'll definitely want this one in your collection!",1238803200,3,456,4.376470588235295
8035576,5,B000309A30,"This was filmed/recorded at the Orpheum Theatre in Memphis, Tennessee. You get Bill & Gloria Gathier & lots & lots of ""homecoming"" friends. You get around 120 minutes of good southern gospel music & entertainment. This one includes James Blackwood & Vestal Goodman, along with the rest of the ""homecoming"" stars. The music is very, very good and very ""spiritual"". If you like Southern Gospel, you'll love this one.
I really enjoyed the last song - the Hank Williams classic ""I saw the Light"", the lead singer on this song is Jessy Dixon along with Sandi Patty & some others. It is simply wonderful!!! I highly recommend this one!!!! Thanks, and may God Bless!!!",1235520000,7,661,4.807017543859649
