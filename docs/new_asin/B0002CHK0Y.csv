8026203,5,B0002CHK0Y,"You won't be disappointed if you are fan of Anime! I recieved this one in about 10 days! If you are looking for inexpensive prices this is the place to come too.  What I like is the reviews that I don't get from other vendors. That's what keep me coming back. Yes, sometimes it may cost more but you make it up in support! This Amine is not filled with all the fluff and fanfare. It's entertaining!",1290902400,,398,4.1688311688311686
8026204,3,B0002CHK0Y,"I loved this series, I thought it was done very well in animation and music and the whole picture. This is similar to the plotline of Neon Genesis Evangelion, but not as messy or gory or intense as NGE is.

Watching the first episode, I thought it was going to be a stupid kiddie anime so I didn't watch the second episode for a very long time. When I finally did, it was a little slow but I gave it a chance and I'm very glad I did.

While it is still geared towards the younger groups of anime watchers, the story was universal. A young girl has a dream to help save the world by going to an exclusive school off-world. She gets there, makes friends, does really well and eventually ends up finding love and self-confidence and a way to save the world. There are times where I'm reminded of the age gap I have over the characters, but there's enough in the plot to interest me in continuing to the next episode.

The competition within the school is a worldwide theme and the games and practices for those games are very interesting. The characters everyone looks up to in the series are very interesting. I love the ninja, he is just too cool.

If you are trying to get someone into anime that is younger, or if you're trying to get into anime and don't like lots of violence or gore I would recommend this series. I also recommend this series to someone who loves the sci-fi ""We've gotta save the world!"" type of shows. I am a sci-fi and fantasy geek and I liked it.",1136505600,2,1470,4.258064516129032
8026205,5,B0002CHK0Y,"I am not an Anime fan, (although I am a science fiction fan), and I totally fell in love with Stellvia!

One of the things I liked about Stellvia was that I could relate to it.  The characters are very well defined.  Each one is an individual, and it doesn't take long to catch on to what each person's goals are in the context of the story, and begin to understand why they act in certain ways.

The story is set in a school, which is also something that's easy to relate to, but the situations the characters get into are much more exciting and interesting than anything I experienced at school!

Maybe this is typical in Japan, but I was struck by how characters have so many different colors of hair!  Besides what I would call ""typical"" colors from blond through black, there is green, red, violet....  Whatever inspired it, it's a great artistic choice; it helps tell the characters apart (especially if you're not used to watching Anime), and makes them look cool!

Underneath the interesting characters and cool art is a nice sci-fi concept concerning danger to the Earth.  It's not too complicated, so it's easy to understand, but it's somewhat original so it's not boring.  I only got a chance to watch Foundation I, and I'm so curious about how the story ends!",1116806400,2,1271,4.559471365638767
8026206,4,B0002CHK0Y,"Heinlein's ""Space Cadet"" defined the theme - exceptional young students go into space and realize their potential training aboard a space station. It's a premise that works, and Stellvia - Foundation is a good example. There is a nice mix of characters who have interest and room to grow, and our young female protagonist's personality is a nice combination of hopeless with great potential. Stellvia isn't terribly original, and it's not especially deep, but will suprise you on occasion. For instance, the backdrop is that of an earth once nearly destroyed by the energy from a not-distant-enough supernova... now, roughly 200 years later the heavier particles from the same event approach and threaten the planet and its colonies, a plausible threat which could come from a ""hard"" SF novel and one suprisingly mature for anime. Stellvia is a odd duck, a mix of good science fiction and rather childlike storytelling which in the end combine to make an enjoyable watch for kids and adults alike. You may not be blown away by this title... but I bet you will enjoy yourself watching it.",1109030400,8,1087,4.945355191256831
8026207,5,B0002CHK0Y,"Gunbuster and Battle Athletes are two two of my favorite anime. My first ""real"" anime experience was Sailor Moon. So it should be no surprise that I absolutely love any anime about an anti-hero protagonist (dark and brooding suits me fine but there's a special place in my heart for klutzy and cute) triumphing over impossible odds to become the savior of the planet. I also LOVE the show Martian Successor Nadesico, so when I heard that a new show was coming out that was made by some of the same people...

Stellvia (or Stellvia of the Universe as it is called on some Websites), is similar to the aforementioned classics, but the overall quality of the entire show will be hard to guage until more of the show comes out (as it has been said that it MAJORLY switches into high gear somewhere around episode eight). From what I've seen so far, I don't think I'll be disappointed.

The animation in the show is high quality, and the character designs are clean and attractive, possessing a somewhat cute, yet very sincere appeal. The CGI is quite nice in the space combat scenes, and overall the show is pleasing to the eye (partially due to it's bright color palette). The only downside to the visuals is perhaps the sparse backgrounds of the space stations (no big deal).

The music is of high quality, and only grows on you over time. Everything has a somewhat cheerful, uplifting sweetness to it. The sound effects are up to par, but it's really the voice acting that you'll care about.

I've seen some truly bad English dubs in my time (and especially recently), but some of the best I've ever seen were the ones for Battle Athletes Victory and Martian Successor Nadesico. This show easily matches them in quality thus far. The main characters are played pretty much perfectly, possessing both youthful idealism, playful spirit, and that serious driving force that it's o-so-hard to put your finger on. The voice acting for the adults in the show is...Stellar as well. A VERY pleasant surprise!

The actual show itself starts off a little slow, as the first episode is largely introducing characters, the universe, and the premise of the show. There is a somewhat strange parting between the protagonist and her mother in the first episode that left me scratching my head, but after that the show quickly solidifies.

Really, this show is a nice change from other shows of it's type. Shima is not just a klutz, she is also a genius. And instead of being bratty, she is shy and reserved. Watching her growing confidence you feel yourself getting more and more drawn into her story. Some of the dialog is truly great stuff, as this show has some fun with the very genre it is portraying (the scene where Shima was wearing a bath-towel over her flight suit really cracked me up), and the stereotypes of glasses-wearing wiz-kid and the female stoic (among others) turn end up becoming friends instead of arch-rivals (for now at least).

Overall I found this show to be highly enjoyable thus far, and I look forward to seeing how it is going to progress. After all, the story is just beginning...",1104883200,5,3096,4.680147058823529
