8436752,4,B000M53RG2,"I picked up a copy of this set of DVDs overseas and I was not disappointed when I finally sat down to watch it. Each DVD covers one period of the history of Table Tennis and liberally adds in rare footage of actual games played as far back as half a century ago. The content stops short of the modern era, ending right around the ascent of Liu Guoliang, but it's still incredible in scope.

That said there are several fairly large criticisms with this documentary.

1. It's entirely in Mandarin. If you do not understand Chinese, you'll probably want to pass unless you're really interested in the footage.

2. As you might expect from the title of the series, it entirely focuses on the Chinese development of the sport. There is virtually no content from before the Chinese began to win their first international championships.

3. Being an official production, it's remarkably sanitized. This documentary generally steers clear of the history of repression during the Cultural Revolution. In any event, there are better sources concerning tragic histories of Ruo Guotuan and the others.

Criticisms aside, this remains a great collection of some rather rare footage.",1234828800,2,1170,4.948979591836735
