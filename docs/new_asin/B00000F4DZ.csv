7906891,5,B00000F4DZ,"I've watched this tape every Christmas for as long as I can remember.  Even though I'm only in my 20's and most of the jokes sailed over my head until I grew up, I still found this movie vastly entertaining!  Growing up and getting all the impression references just made it even better for me.  The jokes are cleverly written and the music is actually very heartwarming and fitting for a Christmas movie.  Even if you don't get all the people that Rich Little is imitating or understand all the references, give this movie a chance as a ridiculous and funny twist on an old classic.

I'm so glad to have found this item on Amazon.com so I can replace the aging VHS tape that my family has had for over 25 years.  Without it, our Christmases just wouldn't be the same!",1133568000,7,768,4.373239436619718
7906892,5,B00000F4DZ,"The laugh-track might be a bit distracting.  This is certainly dated...  Imitations include W.C. Fields, Paul Lynde, Richard Nixon, James Mason, Jack Benny, Johnny Carson (my favorite), Columbo, Bogart, Inspector Clouseau, Truman Copote, Laurel & Hardy, Groucho Marx, Jimmy Stewart, Edith Bunker, John Wayne, and George Burns.  HOWEVER, I LOVE IT.  I was born in 67, and I never tire of this show.  I even love the music.  This show has a special warmth about it.  In fact, the only reason I notice the laugh-track is probably because I've watched it so much.",1131667200,4,559,4.946236559139785
7906893,5,B00000F4DZ,"I first saw this on PBS in 1982 and I loved it.  Rich Little brings the classic tale to life with his assortment of character voices.  From W.C. Fields as Bob Crachet to Truman Capote as Tiny Tim, we see a slightly altered version of this classic tale.  It's about 50 minutes long and every bit of the 50 minutes is funny.  It's very hard to find in VHS or Laserdisc and to my knowledge, it isn't availiable on DVD.  Buy it, you won't regret it.",1111968000,,445,4.127906976744186
7906894,4,B00000F4DZ,"There are three things you have to know about ""Rich Little's Christmas Carol.""  First, it is based on ""A Christmas Carol"" by Charles Dickens in terms of the characters and the plot, but do not expect to hear much of the familiar dialogue.  Second, impressionist Rich Little plays all of the parts, except, of course, not as Rich Little.  That means W.C. Fields is Scrooge, Paul Lynde is Bob Cratchit, Truman Capote as Tiny Tim, Edith Bunker as Mrs. Cratchit, Johnny Carson as Nephew Fred, Richard Nixon as Jacob Marley, Humphrey Bogart as the Ghost of Christmas Past, Groucho Marx as Fezziwig, Columbo as the Ghost of Christmas Present, Inspector Clouseau, as the Ghost of Christmas Yet-to-Come, John Wayne and George Burns as the businessmen, and Jack Benny as the boy outside the window (with his violin, no less).  Third, keep in mind this was recorded as a television special in 1978, which means it helps to have been alive and paying attention to the news back then to get some of the references (e.g., why the chains are Marley/Nixon are reel-to-reel tapes).
This one is really more for fans of Rich Little than of Charles Dickens, but there is nothing wrong with that.  Part of the fun of this is thinking about what it would have been like to recast the different roles.  Pick anybody, from Groucho and Columbo to Bogey and the Duke, and imagine what you would end up with if they were Scrooge.  Once you buy into the logic of this comic production it is impossible not to get caught up in the spirit of it all.  I was not sure why Scrooge is now the owner of a Boat and Bottle Works shop (Scrooge empties the liquor bottles and Crachit stuffs the littel boats into them), until the last character in this comedy arrives upon the scene.  Again, if you remember who was popular on television in 1978 going this far out of the way for the joke will make some sense.  But then, if you do not fondly remember Rich Little you are not going to bother to pick this one up.",1071187200,6,1974,4.488826815642458
7906895,4,B00000F4DZ,"Being a fan of the classic traditional Christmas Carol by Dicken's and most other Christmas Carol renditions, I find this a very well done humorous version of the classic story, with a few twists. Rich little impersonates W.C. Fields, Johnny Carson and others. Very good.",1007510400,8,271,5.044444444444444
