THERE MAY BE MORE THAT WERE CUT OUT BUT THOSE WERE THE 3 I FOUND.

I wouldn't have purchesed it if I had know they cut out scenes.",1393200000,,375,3.675
8331445,5,B001OQLFT4,"I have always been a Quentin Tarantino/ Robert Rodriguez fan. These guys knows how to make great movies and these two are not the exception. Deathproof is brilliant with great dialogue, great scenes, and gorgeous women!! Planet Horror is more in the horror, gut slicing, action movie. It has a lot if great scenes and can't go wrong with explosions. Definitely recommend them to anyone.",1379462400,,386,4.953846153846154
8331446,5,B001OQLFT4,"I enjoyed both movies.  You must be a fan of the this ""B Type Movie"" and must ""get it"".  Otherwise, you'll find the none stop, over-the-top acting to be strange and not too interesting.",1294876800,2,185,4.411764705882353
