7101091,5,B00VRJ632C,Fascinating project.  Songs from very talented artists.,1435363200,,55,6.857142857142857
7101092,5,B00VRJ632C,"This documentary on the recording of the album Lost on the River: The New Basement Tapes  the album where musicians Jim James, Marcus Mumford, Taylor Goldsmith, Elvis Costello and Rhiannon Giddens were given recently discovered lyrics from Bob Dylan (which he never completed in 1967) by producer T-Bone Burnett and asked to compose music and record with the other musicians, aired on the Showtime network earlier this year. Its now out on home video from Eagle Rock (I was provide a review copy in exchange for an objective review). If you missed it on TV, I can highly recommend it and  even if you saw it  youll probably want to pick this up for the bonus tracks  six full performances including three songs that that are not featured in the 106-minute documentary as shown on TV. These bonus performances add another 24 minutes to the package.

The film itself provides background on the project from the lyrics being discovered in a box to the final songs being recorded at the iconic Capitol Records studio in Hollywood. There are comments from music critics as well as audio comments from Dylan himself along with archival footage from 1967. But the bulk of the film is watching the musicians  each of who was given a set of lyrics to turn into a complete song = struggle with making it work. The most emotional is Giddens (of the Carolina Chocolate Drops  a group now on hiatus as she pursues a solo career) who is having a tough time getting it so that she feels confident that the other members are impressed. Working with Burnett she changes the mood of her song  Down on The Bottom a few times.

If you are a fan of any (or all) of the musicians involved in the recording Im pretty sure youll enjoy this BD or DVD.  I know I did. Its virtually the same price as the CD of the finished album and you actually get to see the performances.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

7101093,4,B00VRJ632C,"I have to say that I enjoyed the DVD more than the CD, which contained outstanding pieces and then some real downers. I liked the creativity of the DVD and the camaraderie of the artists. It gave us real insight into the stress and spirit that goes into individual interpretation of great material.",1477612800,,298,4.6415094339622645

7101095,4,B00VRJ632C,"I had watched this on cable and immediately knew I had to have a copy.  I am a huge Riannon Geddings fan and was overjoyed with the opportunity to listen to more of her and learn more about her.  I was very surprised to find that I also now have an awful lot of respect for Elvis Costello.  Although I've heard him doing stuff for his entire career, I never appreciated just how talented he is before seeing this.  It's almost impossible to say enough good things about T-Bone Burnett, and I am so happy he decided to take this project on, and do something wonderful and totally different with so many very gifted writers and performers.",1467244800,,637,4.418803418803419
7101096,5,B00VRJ632C,This is something I knew I would watch over and over the first time I caught it playing on Showtime.  Amazing and simply inspiring.  Everything T Bone Burnett touches turns to creative gold.  This is the epitome of that statement!,1462838400,,230,4.7

7101099,5,B00VRJ632C,One of the best rock doc. ever made with five truly talented musicians. T-Bone Burnett is rock's music god and does no wrong. Rhiannon Giddens knocks you out. One can watch this disc several times.,1455753600,,197,4.6571428571428575

7101103,5,B00VRJ632C,"I love this. I watched it about three time in a row when I sat down to watch it the first time. It is really lovely to be able to see some of the behind the scenes collaboration and work that went into the creating of what I also think is a wonderful album. I find it fascinating to be able to watch this conglomeration of extremely talented people melding their talents to reach a common goal.

I was already a fan of ""Lost on the River,"" Marcus Mumford, and Taylor Goldsmith before watching this film, but I think watching the film and getting to have the opportunity to see the work and respect that the artists put into the project provides the viewer/listener with the opportunity to develop a greater respect and appreciation for the project. The background and history that is provided about Dylan and what was going on with him during the time when he wrote the songs and made the original Basement Tapes also provides an added connection to the music.

The long and short of it is that I highly recommend this film. It is full of amazing artists doing what they do best. The production is lovely, and if you are a fan of any of the artists or Dylan, I don't think that you could be disappointed with this purchase.",1444867200,,1223,4.383259911894273

7101107,4,B00VRJ632C,"Very interesting sessions....a must for Dylan fans.  The thing that stood out to me was how useless Elvis Costello was.  He obviously has had some modicum of success as a songwriter... but this show revealed his skillset, or lack thereof--he had no place to hide.  First off he's not really a guitar player--he's ragged and sloppy and it was apparent his musicianship was the weakest of the bunch.  He was also a disaster on bass playing many wrong notes and incorrect bass lines all over the place.  And that's the good news.  His singing....omg is dreadful, off key on almost every verse...and all of his tunes tend to have the same ragged sound and feel.  He contributed next to nothing on this project.  He makes Dylan sound like Caruso or Pavarotti.  He's the luckiest man in the world considering the success and respect he's enjoyed in the music business--as his performing talent level is next to zero.  He's like the drunk, unshaven uncle wearing the dorkiest clothes and hat... trying to be cool and hang in a rock and roll world with people thirty years his junior.  But don 't let my rant on this dork spoil the show--it's actually very interesting.  T-Bone Burnett is amazing and a maestro, a prince of a producer and arranger.  And the youngsters are great, especially Marcus.  Enjoy.",1440806400,,1298,4.736607142857143

7101110,5,B00VRJ632C,"I really enjoyed watching this documentary! I thought I had purchased the CD of the New Basement tapes for my husband's birthday present, but had accidentally bought the DVD instead. It turned out to be a nice family hour of watching the documentary together. I am even more motivated to get the CD now!",1437523200,7,303,4.62962962962963

7101112,5,B00VRJ632C,"A very informative video about the making of the ""new"" basement tapes based upon Bob Dylan lyrics as a start for new songs. Producer T Bone Burnett and the band made up of Elvis Costello, Rhiannon Giddens, Taylor Goldsmith, Jim James and Marcus Mumford have created some great songs. I watched this on HBO and had to have the Blu-ray. As a bonus you get  the full performances of Diamond Ring, Down On The Bottom, Hidee Hidee Ho #16, Kansas City, Six Months In Kansas City (Liberty Street) and The Whistle Blowing.",1435881600,3,514,4.586956521739131

8711000,2,B00VRJ632C,"OK nice sound, looks nice but blah blah blah, some of the Dylan and The Band comments are informative but they still haven't figured out how to use the technology...  12 songs listed in the documentary the majority are edits and talked over.  6 songs are complete so that's great because you get to enjoy them in surround.  Since they were recording this you would think all the songs they did could be made available but nooooo! So not really a winner.  O it's so great to be here writing with these other great musicians,  great Dylan, blah blah blah mostly.. with some music in between.",1509494400,,589,4.518867924528302
