8526755,5,B008CA4JSO,"Unfortunately, I live in America, so having access to high quality Japanese anime is difficult.  Macross titles are often never even in the states, because of legal battles.  The Macross 7 series is one of those series.  I'd never even seen it fansubbed until this summer while I was in Japan.  It made me go crazy with excitement, so I rushed to downtown Osaka to find this set and the other on Blu-Ray.  I found them used for about $350 total.  It's a lot for a series I haven't even seen but two episodes of, but once I saw the animation I knew I'd enjoy it.  I love all Macross series, Gundam, Yamato, and so much more anime, so I'm sure I'll enjoy this one too.  It's really nice on Blu-Ray.  I can't believe the difference from online streaming to Blu-Ray.  There are no English Subtitles, so you should read the episode summaries if you don't know Japanese.  This set will most likely never be in America, so buy the OFFICIAL Japanese version and enjoy it today!",1378598400,,969,4.418079096045198
