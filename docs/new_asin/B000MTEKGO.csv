2746922,3,B000MTEKGO,"I am a traditional Catholic, and I have small children in my family so it's important that the Saint movies are generally clean, show the Church in a good light, and have good examples they can copy.  Even though this movie doesn't really stray too much out of those bounds, I still took issue with it.

The biggest thing that annoyed me is that Saint Rita just didn't SEEM like a Saint. She just seemed like a normal person living a hard life that rose above it as best she could.  Now granted, that's what a Saint is, but I just couldn't get beyond Saint Rita's portrayal. If you watch this movie and see her life, there is nothing that would show her to be a Saint in it, nothing that would raise her above millions of others who have done reasonably well amidst hard circumstances.  One reviewer mentioned that it wasn't historical and that it seemed like a Chick Flick. I couldn't agree more.  I LOVE Saint movies, but this one just didn't feel like a Saint movie, it felt like a secular take on a Saint Rita, trying to bring her to the normal person's ""level"" rather than having us try to rise to HER level.

Secondly, there were some things I did not care for: Saint Rita and her new husband are showed pretty heavily kissing and making out for a few brief moments, where they fall on the bed and the camera moves away.  Not a big deal especially since they are married, but I didn't want my little children to see this, let alone me! We watch very clean movies only and I don't think it's appropriate for a movie about a Saint to be sexually charged, no matter how mild it is. Also, the whole ""family"" thing was out of an Italian gangster movie, it's done horribly, not accurate to the times, and it's an obvious copy of the mafia.  It's just ridiculous. Those are two examples of the ""artists"" taking artistic leeway in this film, and it in my opinion lowers it. There's nothing there for my 5 year old daughter to emulate in this Saint, nothing that I as a Catholic mother can rise to with this Saint. It's really just secularizing a Saint's life to make it more friendly to the general populace, and in my opinion I think they went wayyyy too far.",1196467200,45,2158,4.337468982630273
2746923,4,B000MTEKGO,"I enjoyed the movie-you can tell its foreign made-many scenes would have been cut out as not needed-if American made. It was good,though way too long. It has 2 parts.",1190592000,2,166,4.566666666666666
2746924,4,B000MTEKGO,"I think the Saint Rita movie was nice, but it definitely is NOT a historically accurate telling of what the church knows of Saint Rita. Within todays present day culture and apathy for all things religious the movie is as close to a chick flick as you can get, you almost begin to think that the main character is Paolo and not Rita! All in all I did enjoy it, what I appreciated is the ""study guide"" a small pamphlet included inside the DVD case, it is very informative and gives you a better grasp of what is actually know about Rita and what is legend,this helps the viewer to determine what was an actual fact and what the director took artistic liberty in.",1180310400,15,661,4.338709677419355

2746929,1,B000MTEKGO,"I write very few negative reviews, but it was almost physically painful for me to watch this film. The Rita in this movie bears little resemblance to the woman I have venerated as my patron saint all my life. As other reviewers have pointed out, Saint Rita was a pure soul who felt a vocation to the religious life - she wanted to enter the convent, but married Paolo Mancini out of obedience to her parents. I was horrified by the movie depicting her as a flirty, flighty young woman and then later, screaming at God in anger for taking her sons away from her and then wandering around Cascia like a madwoman. There is very little in the film about the miracles associated with her, even during her lifetime. I am disappointed that Ignatius Press, a publisher I respect for adhering faithfully to Catholic pious belief (or so I thought), would lend themselves to this travesty. The film may be well made and the costumes and sets realistic, but the real story of Saint Rita far surpasses what is portrayed in this film. Her love for her fellow human beings was always illumined by her unswerving love for God and resignation to His will. Pious tradition tells us that it was she who petitioned God to take her sons rather than allow them to commit the mortal sin of avenging their father's death. While we might easily see ourselves screaming in rebellion against a God who permitted our entire family to die, that does not give us the right to project our weakness onto a saint. It is precisely Rita's ability to raise her agonizing, grieving soul to God and see the supernatural good that came to pass in her husband and sons' lives and deaths that makes her a saint and a beacon of hope to us all. Difficult to do? Absolutely! Impossible? Not with God's grace. Is it human nature to want to drag everyone and everything down to our level? Must be - that is precisely what this film, in spite of its cinematographic glory, has succeeded in doing. Unlike the real Saint Rita, the woman depicted in this miserable production is undeserving of sainthood.",1475193600,11,2054,4.569105691056911

2746943,1,B000MTEKGO,"If this were just some generic historical fiction movie it wouldn't be bad.  As an alleged fictionalized biography of Saint Rita of Cascia, it is absolutely wretchedly awful.  It goes on (and on, and on, and on) about her life before she entered the convent (her marriage lasted 18 years) and gives about 32.5 seconds (all right, I'm exaggerating, but not by much) to her 40 years in the convent.  The author of the pamphlet that accompanies the DVD tries to make that a feature rather than a bug, but it doesn't work.

The pamphlet that accompanies the DVD states that the film ""does not purport to be a strict biography"" because there are so few known facts that it wouldn't make for a long enough movie.  Instead, the idea is to ""bring to life Rita's virtues and deeds for a modern audience.  The filmmakers do this first and foremost by creating a personality for Rita that we find appealing.""

They go on so claim that ""in earlier centuries,"" accounts of saints' lives ""tended to emphasize the virtues and supernatural powers of a saint to an extreme degree.""  However, the filmmakers decide that this approach ""no longer appeals to those who seek role models for holiness.  We want our saints to be 'normal':  loving God, but loving life as well.""  So, instead of doing some solid research to see what stories about St. Rita might have been later additions and then setting them aside, what they do is create a modern feminist type (you know the ones:  perky and pushy,  insisting that they have just as much right to be heard as the men do, while the other women around her are just simply scandalized, and we modern folks sit there smirking and thinking how much smarter we are than those benighted medievals).

Other reviewers have pointed out the inaccuracies of the movie; showing St. Rita, for example, as wanting to get married rather than, as all her biographies say, wanting to enter a convent and only marrying because her parents ordered her to do so (even the author of the pamphlet points that out).  It's as if the filmmakers think that no woman could possibly really *want* to enter a convent, and that no saint could possibly really be devoted to God from an early age.  They must have real problems with, for example, St. Therese of Lisieux; or with St. Gemma Galgani, who, by the way, far more recently than St. Rita, had virtues and powers to an extreme degree, and suffered the Stigmata, and all of it documented.

St. Rita's abusive husband is (as others mention) turned into a (frequently shirtless) handsome young man, whose abuse amounts to being rather cranky with her every now and then; a killer, yes, but a real sweetheart of a guy.

The pamphlet says that ""the filmmakers flesh out the other characters, the historical setting, an the political situation...""  That translates to ""completely make up a lot of things.""  It's rather amusing that they complain about accounts of her life being ""based on a core of truth"" but ""embroidered with a great deal of legend.""  There's probably a lot less ""embroidery"" in those stories than there is in this movie.

Yes, the movie is beautifully filmed.  But they shouldn't pretend it's about St. Rita.",1444867200,7,3174,4.699819168173598

2746947,2,B000MTEKGO,"This was recently shown on EWTN in 2 parts.  This film, ""Saint Rita"", is far removed from her actual life story.  People are encouraged to research the saint's life on the internet.  The last 5 minutes shows  the mystical or holy side of the side.  The other  200 minutes (yes 200) are not really about her life as it occurred.

I depicts her husband in a more favorable light than reality,  The acting is very good and the movie is entertaining.

The movie is very similar to ""The Godfather""  movies with gang rivalry, crimes, murders, feuds and even  ""it's just business"" phrases,  except it is set in Medieval days.  I have removed this film from my Amazon wish list.

2746956,4,B000MTEKGO,"I received this movie as a gift and I truly enjoyed it.  It is a very good story line and the acting was very good. It really kept me interested , even though it was quite long.  However, it was not entirely true. That is why I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5.  I was so taken with this movie that I wanted to know more, so I read some short  biographies of this beautiful saint and was surprised that some of the basics in the movie were not even true. I can understand filling in missing details with things that might be fictional, but even some basic facts were distorted. If you like fiction, the movie is great, but I like to know the truth.  There were things that they changed that would not have changed the story line, for example she was born Rita Mancini, and the movie made Mancini her husband's surname.  Her sons were not twins.  And in the movie her parents opposed her marriage, but in reality they had arranged it. She wanted to be a nun from the time she was a child, but in  the movie, she said she wanted to be married and have a family. Also I would have liked to have seen more about her later years as a nun, but it would have made the movie too long.  The story itself had a good message though of love, forgiveness, reconciliation, conversion, and the power of prayer - which was all true about this saint - so it was still a good movie.",1424563200,,1365,4.120754716981132

2746959,5,B000MTEKGO,"Rita da Cascia is a story is about Rita Lotti - a woman with full of conviction and conservative Catholic values imparted to her by her parents. Vittoria Belvedere shines in her portrayal as Saint Rita. The movie was so convincing that you can actually understand the suffering of a wife and a mother in the midst of prevailing worldly concept during her time that even Catholic Priests doesn't share her principle in life of non- violence and peace. Aside from her portrayal,special mention should also be given to Giorgio Capitani for his direction of the film that he did not fall into the trap of turning the movie into a soap opera but a religious experience about having faith in God amidst trials and tribulations in life. Overall,Rita da Cascia,spoken in both English and Italian,is highly recommended for people that are looking for a story about the willingness to change and the power of prayer in softening the hardest of hearts of others.",1417910400,,951,4.804878048780488

She always wanted to be a nun.  She was obedient to her parent's wishes however and married at age TWELVE.  She had two sons.  Her H was a pagan and a brute.  Eventually, through her patient and loving example, he was converted.

It is truly unfortunate that our entertainment-oriented society as well as Catholics who don't want to know the truth of things or watch fairy tales (albeit are good moral stories) and Disney movies and musicals more than documentaries or more than reading lack discernment.  The producers nowadays feel that the true story won't be as exciting nor gain a large viewing and sales.  But I still say, with all their resources at hand to make a movie like this, a truly inspiring movie could've been had.  I won't buy it.  Who's with me?

Even when her husband came back after murdering someone, she asks for forgiveness because for few moments, she has stopped to believe in the Divine within him.  Wow!  This is something we should all meditate on...  Seeing the sufferings of our enemies beyond their mask of violence and cruelty.  This is what the essence of every religion is all about (if we stop focusing on all the unnecessary concepts that only create divisions).

I also love the fact that we feel compassion for the bad ones because we can feel how tortured they are in their mind.  They are slaves of their own violence and it almost seems impossible for them to get deliverance.  But Love can carry mountains and certainly bring Peace to those souls who are desperately looking for Happiness, despite the appearances.

About 9 months ago, I was incredibly blessed to visit beautiful Cascia, which raised my interest in Saint Rita.  However cruel Rita's husband is depicted to initially be in this film, it appears to be an understatement and a romanticization.

She is always being told to be quiet by those around her and not to question how things are.  She abhors violence and then marries a man whose family's name and wealth is built on that.

I love this movie made in honor to favorite patron saint of the impossible - SAINT RITA OF CASCIA.

I can honestly say this for the miracles she has done in my life and continues to do so.

This was a very beautiful well done movie with excellent actors.

My only complaint is that at times is a bit pixelated. But at any rate, if you are devout Catholic to the patron saint of the impossible, you have to own this.

I've watched it several times and no matter how long it is...it like an hour to me and is addicting!!!

Good Job Vittoria Velvedere!!!",1346889600,,641,4.3
2747006,2,B000MTEKGO,"You may want to buy this movie if you don't care whether it's really about St. Rita or not. Aside from being very historically inaccurate and the fact that it's way too long (3 hrs and 20 min), it's an OK movie.
St. Rita is portrayed as quite a rebel. Against her parents' wishes, she marries a non-religious man who has an extremely hostile, bloodthirsty family. Sure, she was marrying him and not his family, but she had to live in the same house with them and take on all the unkindness. That's being pretty short-sighted. Her husband eventually has a conversion and they have twin sons and move out to the country away from his family. Her husband is eventually killed and her sons die from disease, and Rita loses faith and runs around acting like a maniac. Then she enters a convent where she dies years later.
She could have been much more of a heroine if they stuck to the real story.
In reality, Rita was forced to marry, and she submitted to her parents by doing so. Submitting is harder than rebelling. She never lost faith.
You never really see Rita's deep holiness or her devotion to the Passion, which to me is kind of a no-brainer to include in a movie about her life. Yeah, there's some scenes where she prays, but you never see Rita the Saint.
Although the Italian scenery was beautiful, the acting is pretty bad. Many of the lines sound too deliberate and lack emotional connection. It might be better to watch it in Italian with English subtitles.
They should have put Rita's birth in the film. Her parents went many years not being able to have a child and she was an answer to their prayers.
Way too much time was devoted to the family feuds and betrayal. Every time a bunch of guys are in a room together you know that you're in for a long, confusing scene which doesn't directly affect Rita's life. They should have either drastically shortened these scenes or only kept those which directly involved Paolo (Rita's husband) and Rita, or keep moving back between Rita and the guys.
Another thing that was confusing was that the actors who played Paolo's brother and his best friend look very much alike (or at least have the same haircut). I kept forgetting which was which.
As with many of its type, this film lacks a good soundtrack. There are a couple of themes, the most notable being Rita's theme, which is played over and over, often with the same orchestration. It lacks variety and color.
Overall, this film isn't that great. I mean, it does have a good message, but it simply was not made very well. Buy it only if you're looking for a story isolated from St. Rita's actual life.",1346630400,2,2610,4.496842105263158

2747009,1,B000MTEKGO,"I'm not sure where to start with what I didn't like about this movie.  The script was  particularly annoying.  In no stretch of the imagination can I believe that the people of St Rita's time talked to each other the way they do in this movie. It was as if the modern writers had a complete inability to transcend their own experience to create conversations that were realistic.  Then there is the acting.  One reviewer thought that it was superb, but I found it stilted and actually painful at times to watch - as if even the actors were struggling with the absurdity of the scripts they had been given.  There are two death scenes that were so badly done they were comedic - my husband laughed out loud.  Obviously not an appropriate response but hard to suppress.  Then there is the fictionalized aspect of the story that others commented on.  Very, very disappointing when the true story of St Rita is so rich and worth telling.  Flat undeveloped characters, superficial fictionalized presentations of the story, poor acting.  I wanted so much to like it, to encourage more movies about our Catholic Faith and the lives of the saints to be made.

2747011,1,B000MTEKGO,"These two words sprang instantly to mind, as I abandoned watching this film less than an hour in.

The utter misrepresentation of the life of St Rita, that portrays her as a 'mooning' girl in her twenties, looking for a husband (in reality she wished to enter a convent at the age of 12) at the town's social events, in conjunction with a total lack of any religious feeling or conviction shown in her character is an abuse of a holy person - and - is an insult to the great St Rita (who was forced into marriage with a brutal husband, and bore her two children and her suffering as only a Catholic saint would.)

The 'action' scenes are more about her kissing her 'true-love' and their subsequent bedroom intimacies once married, than about any sword-play that the cover leads you to believe. Totally unsuitable viewing for Catholics of any age!

Ignatius Press should bow their heads in shame for promoting and selling such a misleading movie and make a restitution of their ill-gained profits to a suitable charity.",1328400000,8,1018,4.644444444444445
2747012,1,B000MTEKGO,"Do not let the one star deceive you: I am giving this movie a - 3 rating. When I sat down to watch it I knew it wasn't going to be a biography of St. Rita. The other reviewers had made it clear that it departed from the saint's life in important aspects, such as the fact that she was coerced into marriage at the age of twelve even though she wanted to enter a convent (rather than fall in love at +/- 22 with a knight who saved a baby (?) from a slaughter he had taken part in).

I had hoped at least for a reasonably good fictitious plot loosely based on the theme of St Rita's life.

Instead I was served up a smalchy mess stuffed with every C-grade Hollywood cliche imaginable. Main actors who can't act. Watching Vittoria Belvedere portraying Rita in prayer is painful: she looks bored, waiting for something to distract her which - O happy fortune - just happens to be Martin Crewes coming along, with his long, shaggy hair and short beard (Oh yes, very authentic late mediaeval, that). And the supporting cast - Lord deliver us! One is made aware that these are actors trying to act. When watching this kind of substandard performance, I always imagine that the extras are thinking to themselves: 'I'm getting paid for this, I'm getting paid for this.'

And for heaven's sake (literally) can't someone be found to give the director of a movie like this some idea of how a Catholic nun thinks? Or even just how a Catholic who takes his/her faith seriously, thinks? Robert Bolt, who wrote A Man for All Seasons, was an Agnostic and a member of the Communist Party, but he understood the driving force behind the Catholic ideal better than this movie does.

When I watch a movie, I usually get totally absorbed into it, and only rarely abandon it halfway through. I gave up on this one less than an hour in.

This movie opened my eyes to even through dificulty we can all prevail in following Gods will. She had her moment of dispair, but through Gods Grace she came out of it. The book talked more of how pious she was and did not give much detail of her struggles. The book did make it clear that she struggled but left it at that. This movie depicted how her struggle could have looked like. All around the movie depicted her virtues very well, it did not focus on her desire to become a nun early on in her life. It took a real life scenario that most of us face now. I recomend this movie. Don't take it as an actual account of her life there is so much information out there it would be dificult. This is a possible outlook of what her life could have been like, or at least the pain she went through.

However, viewers who are new to Rita's story and those whose lives have been blessed by her favor should explore the information available at the National Shrine of Saint Rita in Philadelphia.  Here, one can learn of latter-day research that not only rehabilitates the character of her husband but also makes a convincing case for her implausibly ""miraculous"" entry into the convent, to say nothing of its various depictions of her astonishing devotion to Christ's passion.  Indeed, Rita's receipt of the stigmata from the crown of thorns--which takes up mere moments in the film--was the indisputable center of her many years in the convent and the origin of her progress to deserved sainthood.

Actually it might be helpful not to know too many facts about St. Rita, since apparently some liberty was taken here.  I am not Catholic and so was blissfully ignorant of the facts and was therefore free to be completely inspired by this film.  At first I was a bit suspicious that it might be sugar coated or shabbilly produced or poorly acted, as a lot of religious films are.  So I was heartily pleased at the level of production and especially the acting.  The woman portraying Rita gave a performance that was deeply moving---as good as many Oscar winning performances, in my opinion.  I think that the subject was so inspiring that it brought out the absolute best in the actress.

The setting and costumes were all well done.  I loved the whole poltical intrigue and could see how the codes of family, honor, and vengeance have passed on down to the present day. I was amused at the scene when Rita was asked to leave the table because she spoke up.  It reminded me of a time when I was touring Italy with an American girl and her Italian boyfriend.  One evening, over dinner, which he insisted on buying, I spoke out and he yelled at me for the same thing. Fortunately I wasn't married to him.  :-)

I can see how some people would be distressed at historical inaccuracies but for me, the spirit of the story is more important than getting the facts exactly right.  I was amazed over and over at the tremendous strength that Rita showed in forgiving over and over and her insistence on love.  I intend to find out more about this wonderful woman!

Now there is a story worth telling.  What a noble soul! Smaltz is a poor way to portray her noble life.

Frankly, when it comes to the lives of the Saints I am tired of being presented with seriously misleading drama.

The life of St. Rita was amazingly blessed with miracles, tragedy, love, forgiveness, beauty, happiness, adventure, and so much more than I can ever describe in one sitting.
It is for everyone to see a movie that brings this incredible woman to each of us in full period ""color"" ~ her loves, her life and her Faith in Jesus Christ, trying to follow Him in all things in her life.
The acting, photography, direction...there is no part of this one that leaves the viewer wanting. It's just too bad that they could not touch more than they did upon her life as a nun, after the deaths of her husband Paolo and their two sons and the peace-making she accomplished in her city of Cascia, Italy.
The Stigmata-Crown of Thorns Wound that miraculously appears upon her forehead is the only part of her religious life that is much talked about, near the end. But she lived with this for many years, and it was not understood by all in the Augustinian convent where she spent forty years.
St. Rita of Cascia is perhaps one of the most well-known Saints since she is the Patroness of Impossible Cases, also known as ""the Peacemaker."" She is also the model for every woman, no matter the lifestyle or vocation ~ she truly lived them all, a daughter, a wife, a mother, a widow, a nun. But there was so much to her life that it would be impossible to tell it all in one movie.

St. Rita married her husband when she was 12 years old.  We are shown someone who is in her 20s, perhaps.

The language of the Catholic Church is Latin.  In St. Rita's time, most of those in the secular life (if not all) neither read nor spoke Latin.  It was not until the heretic Martin Luther undertook to publish the Bible in the vernacular (removing or rewording portions of it in the process) that the Bible was available in the language of the people.  Never mind all that:  we have a scene of St. Rita reading to her sons from Scripture.  Highly unlikely that she would be fluent in Latin.

People in those times did not have forks as we know them--certainly not made of stainless steel.

In fine, I doubt that anyone did the research needed to depict the Middle Ages and way of life as true to life as could have been done.

Lack of research aside, St. Rita was a truly holy woman, who willingly suffered for our Jesus--even to the point of preferring that her sons die rather than fall into sin.  She persisted in pursuing her vocation as a religious:  God was calling, and she was determined to answer.  God rewarded her by permitting her to share in suffering His wounds.

2747036,1,B000MTEKGO,"Having read biographies of St. Rita, I was shocked to see this film.  For instance, in reality, Rita did not fall madly in love and then get married.  Instead, she had wanted to remain a virgin and enter a convent from her earliest years, but she was forced into a marriage at the age of twelve by her parents.  Even the names given are incorrect.  Rita's surname was Mancini from her birth, not Cicchi as given in the film, and the husband she was forced to marry was named Ferdinando, not Paulo.  And the lengthy, ad nauseam business about two powerful warring families who eventually become united because of Rita, is just some screen writer's fantasy.
  Then you have the two prolonged, unnecessary scenes with the handsome, muscular hunk of a husband with his shirt off!  This is just eye candy for romantic fiction.  This is not the way the life of a great Saint should be portrayed.  In reality, her husband was a brute who treated Rita very, very badly.  The Paolo in the movie was a puppy dog in Rita's hands.
  The most wonderful part of her life, where Rita is lifted into the convent's choir by St. Nicholas of Tolentino, St. Augustine, and St. John the Baptist, was watered down to Rita's simply falling asleep outside on the ground and waking up in the convent garden.  As usual, the secular media waters down the miracles.  Well, except for the bogus miracle that was made up--Rita's healing her brother-in-law of the plague.
  At least they did give her the stigmata, but they gave it to her when  she was very old and near death, which was not true at all, she lived for many years with that stigmata.  It even stunk so bad that she had to be kept isolated in her cell.  There are many more discrepancies, but I don't want this review to be too long.

According to the RC Church there is only one determining factor for sainthood; heroic love. Rita of Cascia demonstrated heroic love throughout her life, one grounded in peace, love, reconciliation, mercy and forgiveness for all without regard. The historical background of the time period is dead on, from the warring families to the plague to the costumes and colors. Rita is shown as a flesh and blood woman, in love with her husband and totally devoted to her children. She is a woman and experiences all the joys, sorrows, feelings and challenges that any human woman does. Saints were real people who loved and lived. They were not as the hagiographic biographies of old would have us believe. This movie has a message for all. Would that we all follow it.

The cinematography is outstanding, the music splendid and the performances brilliant. I will use this with my high school classes in many ways.",1212710400,8,1174,4.924242424242424
2747040,2,B000MTEKGO,"I was disappointed to find that they made this movie into a love story, portraying Rita as a woman who always wanted to get married and not join a religious order. There is even one part in the movie where she says something about religious life not being for her because she wants a family. And yet, this is what catholic.org says of her life:

""She was born in Roccaporena, near Spoleto, Italy, in 1381, and expressed from an early age the desire to become a nun. Her elderly parents insisted that she be married at the age of twelve to a man described in accounts of her life as cruel and harsh. She spent eighteen extremely unhappy years, had two sons, and was finally widowed when her husband was killed in a brawl""

Nevertheless, she is portrayed as falling madly in love with Paolo and working very hard to get approval to marry him. Not a good portrayal of what she went through in her life's desires and marriage, in my opinion.",1212364800,38,937,4.410404624277457
2747041,1,B000MTEKGO,"Very surprised that St. Rita's life was completely changed... there are no sacraments in the film, nor any Catholic identity at all. Don't recommend it as the saint's life. Very sad, indeed! A dark commentary on 21st century falsehood presented by film-media.",1206144000,19,259,5.190476190476191

La hemos visto varias veces en familia, es una pelicula de la que se puede sacar mucho provecho, tanto para el enriquecimiento personal, como para el familiar ya que a travs de ella podemos por decirlo asi, tocar el amor humano con las manos. Definitivamente, la actuacin me parece maravillosa, me gusta escucharla en su idioma original porque puedo apreciarla mucho mas.",1200787200,6,491,5.0
2747043,5,B000MTEKGO,"I enjoyed this movie, was inspired to read the book about St Rita, there are many artistic liberties taken with the story, like her husbands' name and the boys (they were not twins according to the account I read).  And the mafioso-like family seems to have been fictionalized.  But perhaps the movie makers had access to more detail about that part of her life than the account I read.  I think they did stay true to the spirit of her virtues, etc.",1196726400,5,449,4.451219512195122
2747044,5,B000MTEKGO,"When I was growing up in the 1940's, there was a statue of St. Rita in every Catholic church.  She was portrayed as a nun, with a wound in her forehead which she had received as a form of the Stigmata.  But what enchants me about this brilliant film is that it gives us the life of Rita before she entered the convent.  We see a saint in the world of marriage and child rearing, contending with the realities of the quarrelsome and warlike Italian families of her time.  We see her struggling to convert and save her husband Paolo, to guide her children away from the code of honor that required of them a vendetta after the death of their father.  We see her moving through the streets of her town as the plague rages, as people cry for bread, or for help in their illnesses and misery.  Of course we go on to see her enter the religious life, and receive the wound for which we so well know her.  But the scope of the tale, and the depth of Rita's accomplishments are what give the film its power.  Production values are excellent; the actress is wondrously convincing and compelling; the script is good.  I recommend seeing it with English subtitles and listening to the Italian voices that give it a greater feel of authenticity.  Ignatius Press is to be commended for bringing us this powerful and unforgettable film. It is absorbing throughout, with excellent sets and costumes, and exteriors. It is beautiful.  It is also a wonderful gift for Catholics who grew up loving St. Rita as I did.",1196553600,82,1497,4.466911764705882
