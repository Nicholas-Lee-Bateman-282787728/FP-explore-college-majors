8460007,3,B0056YMDXW,"I bought this set without reading prior reviews.  From what I now understand from prior buyers the Jimmy Neutron disc is incomplete, as I have now found out for myself.  You get about 1/2 way into the movie and it stops telling you to insert disc two, however there is no disc two.  The other two movies are great, but the Jimmy Neutron movie is incomplete.",1364428800,,357,4.378787878787879
8460008,1,B0056YMDXW,"Extremely disappointed with this collection, Jimmy Neutron movie is incomplete, telling me i need disc 2 but i don't have another disc for the movie. A bit confusing since the disc stops about 40 minutes in then pops up with a screen saying Insert Disc 2. I tried other movie discs thinking maybe they added it on the other ones but no luck. Sent product back and currently waiting for refund. Looked on the net, found out this is a universal defect. Stay Away from this Package!",1325030400,5,479,4.517241379310345
