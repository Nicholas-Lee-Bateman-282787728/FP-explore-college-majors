5040061,5,B006Z94HWM,"After waiting for brand new releases of more Scooby episodes, I was initially excited when I found out this particular DVD included at least five previously unreleased adventures, some from 'The Scooby-Doo Show' (formerly apart of 'Scooby's All-Star Laff-a-Lympics'), and some from 'Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo' (the original series, the Richie Rich episodes from season two, and 'The New Scooby-Doo Mysteries', from season six). Here's a breakdown:

DISC ONE:
1. The Fiesta Host is an Aztec Ghost  (Mexico)
2. The Harum-Scarum Sanitarium  (Canada)
3. The Spirits of '76  (Washington, D.C.)
4. A Creepy Tangle in the Bermuda Triangle  (Atlantic Ocean)
5. To Switch a Witch  (Salem, Massachusetts)
6. A Menace in Venice  (Italy)

DISC TWO:
7. Shiver and Shake, That Demon's a Snake!  (Florida Keys)
8. Lock the Door, It's a Minotaur!  (Greece)
9. The Ozark Witch Switch  (Ozark Mountains, US)
10. Jeepers, It's the Jaguaro!  (Brazil)
11. Moonlight Madness  (Austria)
12a. Ghosts of the Ancient Astronauts  (South America, never specified)
12b. Ghosts of the Ancient Astronauts  (South America, never specified)

The entire first disc contains episodes of 'The Scooby-Doo Show', from season one and season three. The next disc contains almost entirely new episodes from 'Scooby-Doo and Scrappy Doo', 'The Scooby-Doo Show', (season two), 'The Richie-Rich Show', and 'The New Mysteries'; It's a little upsetting that there are only twelve episodes here instead of the advertised thirteen (I don't care what anyone else says: Ghosts of the Ancient Astronauts, Parts I & II, does NOT count as two different episodes. The same could be said for Moonlight Madness, seeing as how it's a standalone segment), but whatever. They also could've picked more exotic episodes, like 'A Highland Fling With a Monstrous Thing' (1978), 'I Left My Neck in San Francisco' (1979), and 'Scooby's Chinese Fortune Kooky Caper' (1978). But beggars can't be choosers, I guess. And if this review doesn't explain much, I'll be back and edit as soon as I get the actual DVD.

UPDATE: 5/21/12
Yep, just as I figured. The prints on the episodes look fantastic for a first time release (not perfect, but fantastic, nonetheless): they're just as clear as the discs they came in (so don't go and scratch it)! For under $20, this is definitely worth every penny. Keep it up, Warner Bros!",1329696000,37,2350,5.158311345646438

I do hope that Warner Bros. releases the first season of Scooby & Scrappy in the near future. All in all, this is a must-have for every Scooby-Doo and/or Hanna-Barbera classic animation fan!!!",1338249600,5,366,5.116666666666666
5040079,4,B006Z94HWM,"Well, first to clarify the number of episodes on this set. Even though they advertise 13 episodes (6 of which are NEW-to-DVD), there's really only 11 and 1/3rd half-hour shows (4 and 1/3rd of which are NEW-to-DVD). And all the NEW stuff is on Disc 2. For those of you who are trying to piece-meal together all the remaining Scooby-Doo episodes on DVD, here are the specifics of what's new and what's not:

Disc 1:

Complete half-hour of ""The Scooby-Doo Show"" syndicated version.

Disc 2:

7. Shiver and Shake, That Demon's a Snake! - (NEW-to-DVD) originally aired during the 1979-1980 Season of ""Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo"". Complete half-hour show.

8. Lock the Door, It's the Minotaur! - (NEW-to-DVD) originally aired during the 1979-1980 Season of ""Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo"". Complete half-hour show.

9. The Ozark Witch Switch - (NEW-to-DVD) originally aired during the 1977-1978 Season of the two-hour-long ""Scooby's All-Star Laff-a-Lympics"". Complete half-hour of ""The Scooby-Doo Show"" syndicated version.

10. Jeepers, It's the Jaguaro! - originally aired during the 1978-1979 Season of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Scooby-Doo-Where-Are-You-The-Complete-Third-Season/dp/B000M2E340/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!: The Complete Third Season</a>. Complete half-hour of ""The Scooby-Doo Show"" syndicated version.

11. Moonlight Madness - (NEW-to-DVD) originally aired during the 1980-1981 Season of the hour-long ""The Richie Rich/Scooby-Doo Show"". (This will appear on ""The Richie Rich/Scooby-Doo Show"" Volume 2 DVD Set if it ever gets released). The Scooby-Doo half-hour portion of the show was composed of three (3) seven minute shorts and later re-run separately as the half-hour show ""The Scary Scooby Funnies"". This short is just 1 of the 3 shorts that made up the Scooby half-hour. However, this release uses the modified 1979-1980 ""Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo"" opening credits created for the syndicated runs, even though the voice of Scrappy from the 1979-1980 opening credits and episodes (Lennie Weinrib) is not the voice of Scrappy from the 1980-1981 (and later) opening credits and episodes (Don Messick).

12. Ghosts of the Ancient Astronauts Part I - (NEW-to-DVD) originally aired during the 1984-1985 Season of ""The New Scooby-Doo Mysteries"". First half of the half-hour show with the opening credits only. (One of the few episodes this season that includes Fred and Velma).

13. Ghosts of the Ancient Astronauts Part II - (NEW-to-DVD) originally aired during the 1984-1985 Season of ""The New Scooby-Doo Mysteries"". Second half of the half-hour show with the closing credits only. (One of the few episodes this season that includes Fred and Velma).

There are no Special Features in this set.

Hopefully, this DVD set is another one of those Warner Brothers test-the-market type of releases, such that if it sells well enough, then we can look forward to full season sets of the remaining Scooby-Doo series, including those with Scrappy. Even back then, I was never a fan of Scrappy-Doo, but contrary to popular belief, back in 1979 and throughout the 80's, Scrappy-Doo actually revived the Scooby-Doo franchise, not destroyed it. Why else would Scrappy be so prominent for the next 10 years from 1979-1988 if he was so despised back then as everyone now claims these days.

So, if you love Scooby-Doo (and love, like, or at least tolerate Scrappy-Doo), there's enough new material for you to enjoy this set. But if you love Scooby-Doo (but absolutely hate Scrappy-Doo), there's only one new episode without Scrappy, so this set is probably not for you.",1337558400,51,5782,6.843537414965986

The only way to play them is to unhook my ENTIRE home theater system and only hook up the DVD player to the t.v. That means no speakers, cable, t.v. converter, game systems, ect. can be hooked up in order to get these stupid DVD's to properly play!

8506834,4,B006Z94HWM,"i am tired of those 50 ft tall monsters and the episode ghosts of the ancient astronauts is one of the worst cartoons that i have ever seen. Here is the rundown of the episodes. The great- the harum scarum sanitarum, a creepy tangle in the bermuda triangle, to switch a witch, a menace in venice, shiver and shake that demons a snake, and moonlight madness. The okay- the fiesta host is an aztec ghost and lock the door its a minotaur. The bad-the spirits of 76, the ozark witch switch, jeepers its the jaguaro, and (ugh)ghosts of the ancient astronauts. This set has some really good episodes. Shiver and shake that demons a snake and moonlight madness really stand out as good notable episodes. If you can stomach ancient astronaut and deal with a couple more monotous 50 ft tall monsters, then i recommend this set. P.s.
