8310283,2,B000X8L9HC,"I rented this movie years ago and bought it because it was less than a dollar plus shipping.  Bottom line is that it is below average in almost every criteria I can think of:  cinamatography,  plot line and dialogue.  I am a semi fan of Bai Ling and know that she has made a career out of low budget independent films.  I also know that she can act well enough to pull a lot of films up to the level of being  at least "" worth watching "".  Not this time.  If you are a collector of her playing the asian hooker roles  Then you might wish to add this to your collection.  Other than that I would suggest that you try her in "" Gene Generation "" or "" Beautiful Country ""  Both are inexpensive and better choices.",1350172800,,709,4.028776978417266
