It's better to show this to a seasoned, well oiled team.  Especially since there is some unlearning too.

I highly recommend it.",1223769600,,183,4.65625

8069730,5,B0009XMV50,"There are a million sales trainers out there with a million different ideas and views and opinions, etc. Gitomer is the straightest shooter that I've ever come across. There is no BS w/ this guy, he tells it like it really is, as opposed to how it should be or how any particular ""guru"" tells you it really is.

Gitomer focuses on the big picture. Gitomer tells you that if your not a likeable person, then get the hell out of sales! He focuses on attitude and frame of mind. If you focus on the big picture, the details will work themselves out. And most of all - have fun. My company has officially done away w/ other videos from other trainers, and now we've begun to show this DVD (and other Gitomer DVDs) to our sales reps during training sessions.

Young reps of this generation can easily relate to him - he's not terribly attractive to look at, he doesn't wear a $2000 suit, and guess what - he's not cheesy, and he knows what he's talking about.  We used to show this video of a guy who had a fake tan, a Brooks Brothers suit, and obviousy had more work done on his face than Michael Jackson - and the reps laughed at at. The message was lost because the presenter wasn't credible. Also, older reps/ managers find his attitude and advice very representative of the sales environment we're all working in today.

I have 4 of his books and this DVD and they've all helped me a great deal - not to necessarily to just become a better sales manager, but to help my attitude and overall mind set in order to do many things better, including being a better sales manager. Highly recommended.",1183593600,,1594,4.356902356902357
8069731,4,B0009XMV50,"Exciting, informative and well organized. I liked the concepts presented. If you need insipration and are lacking motivation this is a great tool to refer to.",1162512000,2,158,5.115384615384615
8069732,2,B0009XMV50,I didn't realize this is simply a taping of a live event.  This is not what was advertised and he simply didn't deliver much of any value.  Simply seems like a way to generate revenue from another product.  Thin on content and value for me.  I returned the DVD.,1155686400,8,261,4.26530612244898
8069733,5,B0009XMV50,"D. Loved HOW TO NOT SUCK IN SALES, a Better Life Media

CD (and DVD) starring Jeffrey Gitomer . . . it has the

NEW YORK TIMES bestselling author giving a live

seminar about what works in selling--and what

doesn't . . . the latter encompasses much of what

is presently being done, including giving out crappy

business cards . . . he actually encourages those in

attendance to rip up what they are using.

What's so great about this program is that you can

watch it, then for reinforcement, listen in the car

while you drive to work . . . my only disappointment is

that there wasn't an accompanying manual/summary

sheet that summarized all the great ideas.

Among them:

* You could put the words ""up yours"" on your brochure and nobody

would ever find them!

* Sales is all about having fun.

* The best way to get a referral is to give one.

* The secret of selling is engagement. Three words must precede

it: Intelligent, emotional, friendly.

* People don't like to be sold, but they love to buy.

* Liking leads to trusting. And if you're not likable, get out of sales.

* The customer doesn't care about you [the salesperson]. They care about

themselves.

* To find out motive . . . ask your best customers why they buy. It is not

about your selling skills.

* There's a three-word definition of cold call: waste of time.

* Power questions make your customer stop and think; e.g., what

would you do if you lost 2 of your top 10 customers? And what

are you doing to keep them?

* Your job is to have 25 such questions.",1151539200,6,1537,4.309859154929577

2. Very funny = got lots of laughs and was a FANTASTIC thought starter for reviewing the function of relationship skills in sales.

3.  Also, Made it easy for me to dart out for a cig....

4.  The Video made me whole.  I am now one with the universe. Buy it!!!!!!!  BUY IT NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!",1129420800,4,357,4.161764705882353
