8583153,4,B00CLRA42Y,"High school senior Andie Walsh (Molly Ringwald) is a working-class girl and Blane McDonough (Andrew McCarthy) is one of the rich, preppy boys in their Illinois school. When Andie and Blane try to get together, they encounter resistance from their respective social circles. Andie lives on ""the wrong side of the tracks"" with her underemployed father, Jack (Harry Dean Stanton). Andie's best friend, Phil ""Duckie"" Dale (Jon Cryer), is in love with her, but plays it off as a joke in front of her. In school, he and Andie are harassed and bullied by Blane's friends, the arrogant so-called ""richie"" kids, specifically Benny (Kate Vernon) and her boyfriend Steff McKee (James Spader). Steff is especially interested in Andie, but she finds him repugnant and continuously brushes him off. Andie works at TRAX, a new wave music store, managed by her older friend and mentor Iona (Annie Potts). Iona advises Andie to go to her senior prom despite not having a date.

Blane makes a move, chatting with her in the computer lab, and Andie is smitten. Blane ventures out to the area at school where the punks, metalheads, and New Wavers hang out and asks Andie on a date. On the night of the date, Andie waits for Blane at TRAX, but he is late. When Blane finally arrives, Duckie and Andie argue. Duckie tries to convince her that Blane will only hurt her. After a few harsh words, Duckie storms out, and Andie goes on her date. Blane suggests going to a party Steff is throwing but the party is not what Blane expected, and Andie is treated poorly by everyone, including a drunk Steff and Benny. Andie, in turn, suggests going to the local club, where they discover Iona sitting with Duckie, who never gets in. Duckie is hostile toward Blane, and as he and Andie start walking out of the club, Duckie kisses a startled Iona to make Andie feel jealous. Blane offers to take Andie home, but she refuses, admitting she doesn't want him to see where she lives. She eventually allows him to drop her off and he asks her to the prom. Andie accepts and they share their first kiss. At home, Jack surprises her with a pink dress he bought for her at the thrift shop. Questioning how he was able to afford it, Andie discovers he has been faking going to a full-time job. The two fight until Jack breaks down, revealing that he is still bitter and depressed about his wife having left him.

Meanwhile, Blane, pressured by Steff, begins distancing himself from Andie. Finally, Andie confronts him for avoiding her at school and not returning her calls. Blane then claims that he'd already asked somebody to the prom but had forgotten, and Andie calls him a liar. She then accuses him of being ashamed of being seen with her because his friends would not approve. She runs away while Blane protests that she does not understand, and it has nothing to do with her. As a teary-eyed Blane leaves, Steff again offers criticism of Andie. Duckie overhears this and attacks Steff in the hallway. The two fight before teachers break them up and Duckie runs off, tearing down a prom banner in the process. Steff callously remarks, ""Nice, huh?"" and spits on the floor.

Andie finds Iona preparing for a date. Iona is already thinking about marriage. Iona's newly found happiness inspires Andie. She decides to attend the prom, to ""show them they didn't break me."" Using both Iona's prom dress and the thrift shop dress her father bought her, she creates a new pink dress to wear to the prom. When she gets to the prom, she has second thoughts about braving the crowd on her own. Just as it looks like she may back out, she sees Duckie. They walk into the ballroom hand in hand. When a drunk Steff begins mocking the couple, Blane finally realizes that Steff resents Andie because she had turned down Steff's advances, something he was not used to. Blane confronts Steff, and approaches Andie and Duckie. He shakes Duckie's hand and tells Andie that he always believed in her, he just didn't believe in himself. Duckie concedes that Blane is not like the other rich kids at school and advises Andie to go after him. Andie catches up with Blane and Duckie finds a girl smiling at him (Kristy Swanson), telling him to come over. Outside the prom, Andie finds Blane in the parking lot, and they kiss passionately in front of his car.

Pretty in Pink is a 1986 American romantic comedy-drama film about love and social cliques in 1980s American high schools. It is one of John Hughes' films starring Molly Ringwald, and is commonly identified as a ""Brat Pack"" film. The film was directed by Howard Deutch, produced by Lauren Shuler Donner and written by John Hughes, who also served as co-executive producer. It has become a cult favorite. The film was named after a 1980 single by the band The Psychedelic Furs.

The film's soundtrack has been rated as one of the best in modern cinema. It features a rerecorded sax-heavy version of the title song by The Psychedelic Furs. Additionally, Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark's ""If You Leave"", which plays prominently during the final scene, became an international hit and charted at #4 on the Billboard Hot 100 in May 1986.",1468108800,,5135,4.675884955752212
