8291670,1,B001D5DQGG,"I did not open this as soon as I got it.  Then, I got very sick.  When I checked I found
the item is defective as the cd is rolling around inside the unopened case.
Apparently I cannot return this DEFECTIVE item as I missed the ""window"" for returns
by two days.  I am a long time Amazon customer and this is the first problem
I have had - loyalty apparently doesn't count.  Be careful and do not get sick or they'll close the window on you.
I had hoped for humanoid contact by writing this review....still waiting.  I wonder what a CD tastes like?",1392249600,,547,4.171428571428572
8291671,5,B001D5DQGG,"I have this video on VHS, and now I own it on DVD!! As the first of the MD drum videos, this is a instant classic, and lends itself to showing the early careers of some great drummers, including Tony Royster Jr.",1368230400,,211,4.0476190476190474
8291672,2,B001D5DQGG,"I bought Modern Drummer festival 1997.
It was wrapped and all but when I took the DVDs out I noticed they were scratched and had fingerprints on them. This something I never see in new products. The video plays fine up to what I have seen, but still its kind of weird that it came out all scratched and used even though it was wrapped... This is something you might want to think about if you buy from Discount Media... But I really don't know what happened so I don't even know what to think.",1303603200,3,493,4.2
