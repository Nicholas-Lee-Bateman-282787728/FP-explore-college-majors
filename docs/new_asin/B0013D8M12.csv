8249939,3,B0013D8M12,"Corporate Affairs was definitely an entertaining movie. To get the negatives out first, the movie seriously lacked substance in its plot and the situations were mostly unbelievable.

Now, for the good stuff: Breckin Meyer is always fun to watch in his movies, he has great delivery and seems to be able to fit any role, as long as there is some humor to it. Also, while some of the situations Meyer finds himself in are unbelievable, it is not hard to understand that people end up in situations like his, where they are away from home often and lose track of what is important in their lives, like family, friends and morals. Meyer loses his way throughout the film, but struggles against it, and ultimately, comes out a good guy that actually seems to regret his mistakes.

Overall, this is not a great film, but it is not a bad one. If you enjoy comedies with characters that become flawed and find ways to beat their flaws, watch this movie, it is well done in that respect; otherwise, I would say this is little more than entertainment for a rainy day.",1236211200,5,1057,4.528795811518324
