5261107,5,B0094AH366,"This production of Rigoletto is simply superb. At last we have a new recording with cast and direction that would have pleased the composer Verdi, the librettist, Piave and the author of the novel from which it was taken, Victor Hugo (""Le roi s'amuse"" - ""The king amuses himself"") Changed by Verdi to a duke for political reasons.
So much of what passes these days as ""new"" opera and ""modern' approach is nothing but trash. No I don't want to see Romeo & Juliet in the back alley of a butcher shop in Brooklyn. Nor do I want to see Rigoletto done in a Las Vegas gambling parlor. Give some credit to the composer and the poet and what they had in mind. Part of the magic of opera to me is that the work takes you out of reality to a time and place where a tale unfolds with the music bringing all the diverse elements of story and stage to one satifying all encompasing experience. This presentation fulfils that definition.
Rigoletto was about Verdi's fifteenth opera. Before he had been one among several talented Italian composers vying for the publics attention. After Rigoletto (the miracle of Rigoletto!) he would be the best and ever after. He had some dozen or more operatic masterpieces yet to come.
The stage setting and costumes by Pierluigi Samaritani are just right for suggesting the time and place of the drama. This was from an older production and was revised for the present presentation by Alessandro Cimmarughi. The cast here is ideal for bringing the drama to fruition. First and foremost is the Rigoletto of Leo Nucci. He is a consumate artist now in his 70s but still commanding a pliant effective voice combined with his superior acting skills to be a truly great Rigoletto. He is still recording several productions in the C Major Verdi series and the ones I've heard are all excellent.
The Duke as done by Fracesco Demuro is a wonder. He is gifted with a strong secure lyric tenor, a handsome face and facile body so that it is totally believable that the ladies would fall all over him and that one would die in his stead. With the new upclose camera in this age of DVD the days of the 300 lb. tub waddling out to bark his aria and then waddling off are gone; this goes for the park and bark fat ladies also. As one other reviwer noted, my first Rigoletto recording was Jussi Bjorling (greatest Italian tenor of the day though born in Sweden), Robert Merrill and Roberta Peters. I can still hear her ""Caro nome che il mio cor"" aria. I also wore out that set. In my youth I went to the Met on tour in Detroit and Cleveland and then forty years at Chicago's Lyric Opera so I've heard a lot of Rigoletos. (The best in the past was probably Leonard Warren).
In this production the Gilda is the very good coloratura soprano Nino Machaidze. She is charming and a good actress and has great conrol over her beautiful voice and her singing.
Not often noted but unforgetable in this production is Sparafucile as done by Marco Spotti. Who can forget that smile on his face when he describes his cutthroat business? The only weak voice in the main cast was the Maddalena of  Stefanie Iranyi.
All in all, a wonderful production with a wonderful cast. The best now available.",1366934400,13,3188,4.506044905008635
5261108,5,B0094AH366,"Rigoletto was my very first opera recording, way back in late high school; it was a mono recording with Bjoerling, Peters, and Merrill. It captivated me then (I wore out the records) and it still does. Berger (""Verdi With A Vengeance"") refers to it as a ""miracle ... a dramatic masterpiece whose musical ideas unfold swiftly, seamlessly and furiously"". The score is rich, with an overabundance of melodies which, when well performed, have brought audiences to their feet in theatres all over the world since its premier in 1851.

This performance is a tour de force from curtain up to the final curtain down; it is literally a nonstop roller coaster ride with brilliant performances from every singer, the chorus and the orchestra combined with a technically flawless DVD.

Recorded in the fall of 2008, just months after her huge success as Juliet in Salzburg, Nino Machaidze provides a Gilda that is stunning in execution. Much has been made of claimed lack of coluratura skills in the seemingly endless ""this soprano vs. that soprano"" debates, but, gentle reader, if there is anything missing in this interpretation, I don't know what it is. Musically and dramatically, despite hearing many Gilda over the years, I cannot recall hearing and seeing a better one.

Leo Nucci continues to amaze. Born in 1942 (!), his work in the C Major Tutto Verdi series is consistantly of a high level. Here he is absolutely spot on from start to finish: his is a rich and solid instrument, generous with the upper voice, with no sign of dryness or wobble. He totally deserved the outpouring of applause from the audience in Parma, which I have noted previously, is a really tough venue. ""Pari siamo"" brings down the house; ""Corteggiani, vil razza"" brings down the house and the vengeance duet brings down the house for a well deserved encore. Mama mia!! gentle reader, now THIS is what operatic excellence is all about!

Francesco Demuro is a tenor I had not hear before, but while Bjoerling remains my favorite Duke, Demuro's is another first rate performance. His is a lyric tenor, light and bright, but when dramtics are called for he does not disappoint. In fact, optional (unwritten by Verdi) high notes are perfectly and thrillingly executed at the end of ""Possente amor"" and ""La donna e mobile"". Yet the bottom is secure and audible. I'd like to hear more from Demuro.

""But wait!! There's more!!""

Bass Marco Spotti is spot on as Sparafucile: vocally he's quite good but his acting puts the meat on the carcass for this small role. Stefanie Iranyi makes us all understand why the Duke is chasing her around the house (I would rhapsodize on her legs, but do not wish to offend any ladies who read this). The chorus acts and interacts! I have noted in other C Major Tutto Verdi reviews that the lack of dramatic involvement by the chorus seems to be a symptom of small budget regional Italian theatre, but not here. They do an excellent job!

So does the orchestra under Maestro Massimo Zanetti!

This traditionally staged version is nearly complete, with the exception of the second round of ""Possente amor"". There is a brief bit of frontal female nudity in the first scene, which I felt was unnecessary; though I am an admirer of the fair sex in all stages of dress, this just seems out of place here. Just sayin' ...

As noted, picture and sound are excellent. I was able to pick out some nice instrumental detailing, and the DTS surround really did give me the sense of a live performance.

Gentle reader, buying this one is a no brainer. It's ""guaranteed to amaze"".",1365120000,12,3564,4.74313408723748
5261109,5,B0094AH366,"This is a gorgeous, traditional production (Parma, 2008). You can watch it on youtube instead of reading this long-winded review. I usually have a hard time really getting into the drama of a work as familiar as Rigoletto. Another problem is that the memory of so many great singers haunts every line. So you watch and listen, taking in the gorgeous tunes with mild weariness and dutifully noting every deficiency or failing of the performers, until it can become an exercise in self-fulfilling disappointment. The exact moment I snapped out of this attitude and into the heart of the tragedy was when Nucci cries out in act II ""Io vo' mia figlia!"" (""I want my daughter!""). This confrontation with the courtiers is particularly poignant in this production. The courtiers at this point realize that it is Rigoletto's daughter, not his lover that that Duke is defiling in the adjacent room. ""Cortigiani, vil razza dannata,"" follows, where Rigoletto first curses and threatens the courtiers and then is reduced to pleading and groveling, concluding in ""Piet, signori, piet"". Nucci pauses before the last ""piet"" and two courtiers shove into his hands a jester's cap into one hand and a jester scepter into the other, i.e., the courtiers response to Rigoletto's heartbreaking pleas is ""you may think that you are a father defending his daughter - you are nothing more than a clown, that's your job description"". This directorial touch sums up in one gesture Rigoletto's predicament and kicks it straight into your guts: trapped between a lecherous playboy of a master and the cruelty, cold indifference and inhumanity of the court, the jester is the ultimate victim, clinging to his daughter because of his extreme loneliness, etc., etc. You experience the drama from the inside out in this production; every musical line, figure or chord becomes embedded in the drama with a specific and clear meaning. In a way I recaptured the wonder of discovering this work for the first time. Any relative shortcomings of the singers, real or imagined, become irrelevant within the totality of this experience. The rest is nitpicking.

Now for the nitpicking. Nucci's Rigoletto does not need my endorsement, enough said. I think even the naysayers will be won over this time (his interpretation here is different from the one in the antiseptic Zurich blu-ray from 2006). Nino Machaidze (Gilda) was twenty-four here and her Duke (Francesco Demuro) was 30 years old. Their youth, charm and good looks are a big asset. Nino Machaidze is an utterly convincing Gilda, with a rich, full tone and secure passagework (she trills). Francesco Demuro has a small, focused voice; it sounds as if this role is a stretch for him. The Duke is dangerous, but Demuro's Duke is as dangerous as a puppy. His dynamic amplitude (from piano to forte) is limited, but his tone is sweet, his phrasing is elegant and exceptionally graceful and his diction is just superb even for an Italian (from Sardinia). Demuro and Machaidze conclude their act I duet on a high Db; She sings a high Eb in ""Caro Nome"" but ends it on a high C; he ends his cabaletta ""Possente amor"" on a high D. Machaidze ends the ""Si, vendetta"" duet on a ringing high E-flat with Nucci on the A-flat below - they repeat the duet (""Bis! Bis!)"" at the footlights. Demuro ends ""La donna  mobile"" on a high C (and these are just the notes that Verdi did not write).

Even though Demuro is more of a tenorino, do not underestimate his talent; he casts his spell insidiously. I found myself searching for his clips on youtube. A few clips were enough to breach my resistance and soon enough una furtiva lagrima negli occhi miei spunt (I'm not referring to the aria) and I reached for the hanky. I'm sorry, I'm only human, I have feelings, what is it about this Demuro, or am I getting soft in the head? This dolcezza e innocenza, this grace, effortlessness and understatement, not English understatement but an Italian one - check his entry in Wikipedia - he has been performing in public since he was ten. His operatic debut was as Rodolfo in Luisa Miller in 2007 - there is a DVD. At the final curtain call, a complete unknown, he was the only cast member who was showered with flowers (from both sides of the house) - even the soprano did not get any - this is the kind of charmer he is. He is also featured in the ROH Trittico blu-ray as Rinuccio, where you can see another side of his charm. According to his management he is scheduled to sing Alfredo at the MET - that would be a bloodbath, the Met is way too large for his voice, and he does not project like Florez. Even diminutive Parma is too large for him (his body mic saves him), but the future of his career is secured, not only in opera. He already has a Japanese fan club.

This blu-ray seems just perfect on repeat viewing. The biggest credit for the success of this production goes to the director(s). This production is based on a 1987 Parma production by Pierluigi Samaritani, who also designed the magnificent sets and costumes. They are works of art in themselves - their traditional style, opulent beauty (achieved with simple means in the court of Mantua) and signature hyperrealism reflect Pierluigi Samaritani's experience as assistant to Franco Zeffirelli, to designer Lila De Nobili and to the painter Giorgio De Chirico. He died in 1994. His student Stefano Vizioli updated that production with some scene changes, smoother transitions helped by modern technology, and above all wonderful psychological work with the actors-singers resulting in a vividly flowing dramaturgy.

The rest of the cast is first-rate. Video and sound are good despite the use of body mics.",1362960000,21,5667,4.79038854805726

Also featuring ... ah, well, I can't seem to find her name.  Strange that artists who really give it their all, and I mean their ALL, can't even get credited.

But something seems to be amiss.  I am looking at the Schirmer score, page 35, sixth system, 2nd measure.  And I do not see any stage directions as to Rigoletto stripping a young lady down to her bare goodies as a gift of goodwill to the court.  Nor do I see anything to the effect of the duke spreading her lower extremities and positioning himself against her exposed bush to perform a mock-boning in public.

It is such high art, but I do not see it in Schirmer.  They are so backward.  I shall have to check Ricordi ...

I know it couldn't be they just interpolated the scene, in Verdi's hometown theater no less.  If so, I'd have been sorry to spend money to support this garbage.  I'd be less inclined to overlook the pisspoor sound, and the pisspoor tenor.  That's my opinion.

Stunning yet spare staging, offset by sumptuous costumes and youthful singers with the looks and the voices for a total operatic experience.  Leo Nucci is a perfect Rigolettothough the golden means is still Gobbi.  Ill be listening to MacNeil next, in the Mets 1977 production with Cotrubas and Domingo.

I can hadly think of better singers, The Duke (Francesco Demuro) och Gilda (Nino Machaidze) are youthful, act well, and have attractive voices. Nino Machaidze must be counted as one of the best Gildas on record. Leo Nucci too gives a magnificent performance of the title role.

8535673,5,B0094AH366,"I am a great fan of this Verdi masterpiece.  Leo Nucci is about the best singer in the title role - there are numerous great Rigolettos, but Nucci not only sings the part, but also looks and acts the part to perfection.  He has not less than three commercially available DVDs in this role over the years.
However, in THIS particular production, good old Nucci is finally blest with the most EVEN vocal cast, and the most superb period production.
We must count ourselves lucky having this video from Parma's 2008 production, of which I saw live that spring in my city, though unwittingly, I missed Francesco Demuro and went to Valter Borin's shows instead (hitting myself now).
Nino Machaidze was only about 25 or 26 in 2008 (may be even younger), and she is the perfect Gilda, even more convincing than Diana Damrau in the 2005 Dresden DVD with JDF.
I never considered Sutherland an ideal Gilda, not just visually but also vocally.  Outstanding though she was in this sort of repertoire, she lacks just one bit of youthful vitality and bite in the earlier Acts.  Similarly, the very capable Mariella Devia is a bit too full-throttled for Gilda (though she's the greatest Lucia of the last quarter of the 20th century). That Machaidze has since hardened her voice is nowhere to be found in this early performance, which is rightly considered perfect.
Francesco Demura is a very good Duke, but not yet perfect.  Even so, his Duke works tons better than Juan Diego Florez's, and more elegant than Piotr Beczala's.  At times, his phrasing and nuances are reminiscent of Alfredo Kraus. Overall, a suave and callous Duke of Mantua, full of youthful sexual energy. A very convincing protrayal it is. What I like so much about this young tenor is that he is shorn of any ego-trip that so often lets down young hopefuls in the field.  He is able to deliver his part with concentration, with care and with real musical and vocal expertise.
The supporting roles of Sparafucille and his sister are also well undertaken, and the male chorus of courtiers is very effective, just as I heard them live that spring.
Zanetti conducts with youthful vigor throughout, quite unlike Nello Santi in the Zurich production (with Nucci). The direction is also fantastic.",1375747200,7,2245,4.785529715762274
8535674,5,B0094AH366,"Rigoletto is the first of the ""Tutto ( Complete) Verdi"" operas I have listened to. I was unfamiliar with the Teatro Regio di Parma where this DVD was recorded. I wondered what the other twenty-five Verdi operas produced in commemoration of Verdi's 200th birthday would sound like.

Based on this DVD of Rigoletto, I believe that the ""Tutto Verdi"" opera series will prove to be a magnificent tribute to the great Verdi. The production is at once powerful and beautiful. Leo Nucci's performance as Rigoletto is astounding. The rest of the cast, as well as the orchestra, are excellent. I look forward to experiencing more of the Tutto Verdi series in the future. I give this DVD five stars.",1373068800,2,688,4.781512605042017
8535675,3,B0094AH366,"I bought this after reading several long reviews on amazon that gave it great praise. Rigoletto is my favourite Verdi opera and I have bought most DVD and Blu-ray releases in recent years. Whilst I must agree this is generally very well sung I was not impressed by the Blu-ray transfer. Its great strength is the outstanding visual and vocal performances of Nucci and Machaidze. Nucci has done this before on Blu-ray from Zurich and here he is even better. His little limp and shuffle is perfect for the pathetic jester. As Gilda Machaidze not only sings wonderfully but looks the part too. In my view the best overall Gilda on disc. Demuro is good as the lecherous Duke but not I thought exceptional. The minor parts were well sung but not that well cast, as an example the sexy Countess of Ceprano is very mature and overweight and could not possibly have attracted a sex-crazed lout like the Duke with so many women to tempt him! The other small parts all look the same and have little to distinguish them - such a strong point in the outstanding Las Vegas production.
The video quality is really quite poor. Most scenes are dark and gloomy and the HD cameras struggle. Skin tones make everyone look like Indonesians and the subtitles are very hard to read as they are too small, too dull and are often distorted by strong backgrounds. Unlike Las Vegas where the subtitles have been jazzed up and are consequently much easier to read, here they are in the old stilted style and together with the technical issues do not flow. I was not very happy with the microphone performances, the sound was not as rounded and luminous as I had expected.
This would have been a great performance in the theatre with a pair of opera glasses but this Blu-ray transfer is a big let down. One advantage for Asian viewers is that it has Chinese, Japanese and Korean subtitles. The Chinese translations are better than the English.
Buy this with caution. If you can accept the Las Vegas version that is the best version on offer at this time in my view but for a perfect traditional view I am still waiting.",1372032000,8,2091,4.5638297872340425
