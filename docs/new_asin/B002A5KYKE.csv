3883411,3,B002A5KYKE,"Not exactly a film noir classic. It is mainly worth it for Rita and Glenn although their reteaming isn't as passionate as it was in Gilda. Glenn is good at playing a tough, yet vulnerable policeman as he is supported by his young wife incarnated by sexy Elke Sommer - the real 'femme fatale' is Rita who shines even in a less advantegeous role as this one -. Ricardo Montalban is good as a weak cop who falls into the Money Trap together with Glenn Ford. All in all, except for the actors and the soundtrack, not an unforgettable experience.",1304380800,4,541,4.42

8358959,3,B002A5KYKE,"Interesting little tale of a honest cop turning to crime with the encouragement of his partner.  Glenn plays a cop with a beautiful young wife, Elke Sommers, who likes to spend money.  They exist in their lavish style thanks to the dividends on her stock inheritance, but this year the company isn't giving out any dividends and their way of life looks to suffer.  When he learns of a safe full of criminal money, he and his partner set out to steal the money.  In film noir style things don't go as planned.  Worth watching for an evenings entertainment, but not a memorable film.",1411430400,,581,4.548076923076923
8358960,5,B002A5KYKE,"Rita and Glenn are just  wonderful in this very good plot. Both, very distant from the glamour years deliver a mature, secure, sef confidente interpretations. But, believe me, they are still thrilling",1379462400,,200,5.25

8358962,2,B002A5KYKE,An attempt to give rita Haywood a last chance at movies!  She shouldn't have done it.  The glenn ford connection they had with gilda is gone.  Plot was thin and predictable.  Even poor movie for glenn ford and he usually gave a good performance.  Time to quit!,1377216000,,260,4.446808510638298
8358963,5,B002A5KYKE,I saw this movie on TV; went looking for it on DVD and found it.  I ordered it and received it as  promised and in great condition.  I will enjoy this for many years to come.,1355961600,,174,3.7777777777777777
8358964,5,B002A5KYKE,"This is more of a Glenn Ford movie than Rita Hayworth.  I have seen all of Rita and Glenn's movies' dialogue between the two is interesting specially when she said "" You should have married me "" On second thought perhaps it would have been good if they married, this would have given credibility for the chemistry they have on the screen and avoided the string of divorces that happened.",1349568000,,387,4.5285714285714285
8358965,5,B002A5KYKE,"This film is enjoyable to watch. Glenn Ford, is at his star power best. I also enjoyed watching an ageless Rita Hayworth and Ricardo Montalban, Ford's detective partner. With an interesting twist, the movie pulls you in to Glenn Ford's overall marriage situation and his ultimate concern for his future and marriage. The movie ends with the film watcher on the edge of their seat.",1333411200,3,380,4.861538461538461
