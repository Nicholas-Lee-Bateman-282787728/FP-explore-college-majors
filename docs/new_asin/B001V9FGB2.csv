This film reminded much of an old musical ""La corte del faraon"" because of all of the sexual jokes. In the translation with the English subtitles some of the jokes (although perfectly translated) lost their meaning. They didn't sound ""dirty"" like the meaning was implied in Spanish. Still I haven't laughed this hard in a very long time. Just to let one of the laughs out of the bag.......the plot involves a 30 years war between Athens and Sparta. Lisistrata (a woman) has convinced the rest of the women of Athens taht if they lock themselves up in the Acropolis (which is also where the towns treasury is store. The war will finally come to an end. The belief is that the men without women to love and money to fund their battle will decide to make peace. While this is going on a homosexual transvestite who goes by the name of Hypocrites dresses himself as a medical doctor and tells the general and his men that they can practice improved homosexuality until the women return. When the women realize that the man are calmer, they can wonder the streets and not be raped and that the majority of them are not carrying visible erections, Lisistrate goes out to discover why. She goes to the only gay gathering in Athens called ""Adonis"" and disco music is playing in the background. It's hilarious, it's a hoot, it's a good time that doesn't offend anyone. Extremely well written, well acted and displayed, this movie should be seen my anyone that loves satire.",1262217600,,1556,4.620938628158845
