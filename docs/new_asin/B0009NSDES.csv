2303591,5,B0009NSDES,"We just had our first baby and someone gave us this DVD as a gift. We thought it was wonderful. I've had my parents watch it, and I've even asked our babysitter to watch it! It goes over everything you need to know at a smooth pace. We were so nervous, this really helped ease our stress. It's great to know we could pop it in the DVD player at any time for a quick reminder. I plan to make this THE baby shower gift for all my friends!",1152057600,3,436,3.9101123595505616
2303592,2,B0009NSDES,"We were disappointed in this DVD and thought it was a waste of money. We did not learn anything new.  They went through things quickly, everything was so basic, things that are mainly common sense.  I felt this was a big huge waste of money, and is now in the trash.",1151625600,7,266,4.196078431372549
2303593,1,B0009NSDES,"This newborn care DVD is strictly for caring for a newborn infant, in other words, what you learn here won't apply after the first 3 or 4 weeks.  My biggest beef with this DVD is that it totally just skims over all the basics, such as how to breastfeed properly, how to bottlefeed properly, how to swaddle properly, how to calm a baby properly, etc.  All the stuff you want to know about looking after a newborn, each is given about 5 seconds of screen time.  Instead, the bulk of the program is wasted on things like ""pre-birth preparation,"" which interestingly appears toward the end of the program, and how the mother should take care of herself.  These are important things to know, but not for a ""ultimate baby care DVD.""

The DVD packaging is also very misleading.  It says ""over an hour of hints""... but that includes 1 minute of copyright warning and another 30 seconds of ""you should always consult your doctor"" warning, plus a long end-of-program credit.  The actual content is about 55 minutes.

I've seen this DVD and the ""ABC of Newborn Baby Care"" DVD and even though the latter is not great, it's better because it goes through the important topics step-by-step, and the nurse/midwife demonstrates the techniques clearly.  Between the two DVDs, I definitely recommend the latter.

BTW, you can likely find this at your local library.  It's also available from Netflix.  It's just not worth the price of the DVD, not even 1/10 of the price.",1151193600,62,1453,4.699604743083004
2303594,5,B0009NSDES,"Bringing Baby Home is fantastic. They use actual newborns and parents (versus actors which we found in other videos). The doctors and specialists are straight forward and direct, and the information covered thorough. They talk about the basics, feeding, hygiene, sleep, car seats, possible illnesses, first doctor visits, and have segments on how the mom will possibly feel - how the dad will possibly feel - and sex after childbirth...and many other topics. Of the three videos we purchased, this one by far exceeds the others in quality and information. Highly recommended.",1134172800,24,575,5.260869565217392
2303595,5,B0009NSDES,"A great DVD for any expectant mom.  It has so many things...I always worried about jaundice and it covered that too...now, I even know the safe way to buckle my baby's car seat.",1124841600,5,177,4.363636363636363
2303596,5,B0009NSDES,I saw the Parents Seal of Approval award winner stamp and I knew it would be great and it was. I bought this for my sister and we watched it together.  Now I now how to take care of my niece.  I finally understand why a baby's head is so soft and why we should be careful holding it.,1124841600,3,283,3.7796610169491527
2303597,5,B0009NSDES,"Thank you LIANDREA Company for a great DVD.  I'm a first time dad and was so nervous.  I watched this DVD with my wife and I felt like I could handle this...and I can.  I learned about how to hold my son..I never had a baby in my family before.  There's even a family therapist that talks about how dad's are going to feel...it's usually all about the moms, but this DVD had stuff about helping the dads too...",1124755200,10,410,4.151898734177215
2303598,5,B0009NSDES,"Bringing Baby Home is the perfect gift.  I received it and couldn't be happier.  It has everything you'll need to know about your baby, from 0-6 months.  Everything is in little segments and there are even re-caps.  From  the hospital to home, this DVD is full of information.  They show you how to bath and change your baby.  They even give a step-by-step account of the first doctor's visit with an expert Pediatrician - Dr. Denis Leduc, President of the Canadian Pediatrics association.  I love it!  It's the perfect shower gift for any mom to be.",1124755200,5,550,4.645833333333333

2303600,4,B0009NSDES,"After ordering every DVD I could get my hands on, because my husband won't read a book, i found them all to be so short and didn't spend enough time addressing each item.  Of all the DVD's I ordered, this one has to be one to the best.  Its long and thorough enoughso you feel informed....not to say that you might not have a question afterwards, but I thought it did a pretty decent job",1346025600,,387,4.1466666666666665
2303601,5,B0009NSDES,"Very helpful! I was sooo nervous, as an only child, without any experience with babies. This DVD definately provides lots of useful information. It enabled me to feel like I knew a little bit before my daughter was born :O)",1291939200,,223,4.6
2303602,3,B0009NSDES,"I bought many newborn care DVD's and this okay but it is not my favorite. It has alright content for first time parents, but it drags on a lot. I still prefer (Starting Out Safe and Sound: A Guide to Newborn Care and Safety) which has more concrete information on newborn care and safety.",1276128000,,288,4.351851851851852
2303603,3,B0009NSDES,"This video is pretty good. They do go through things rather quickly, but this is far better than ""Laugh and Learn."" The 2 are not even comparable to me. I still feel like some of the basic books and just taking free classes offered through our hospital have been far more beneficial, but if you truly know nothing, this can be useful. I will say, it was a bit text-book like.",1246752000,,375,4.295774647887324
2303604,2,B0009NSDES,"Expecting our first, my wife and I have bought several DVDs related to childbirth, etc. We first chose to purchase ""Bringing Baby Home"" rather than ""Laugh & Learn"" because the reviews and descriptions made it seem much better. But we found ""Bringing Baby Home"" somewhat disappointing. We really liked the other DVDs in the ""Laugh & Learn"" series, so we came back and bought the Newborn Care one. ""Laugh & Learn About Newborn Care"" is much better than ""Bringing Baby Home"". More comprehensive and better presentation. Very well done like all the ""Laugh & Learn"" series.",1238198400,,568,4.927083333333333
2303605,5,B0009NSDES,"My wife and I have been going over plenty of books and DVDs.  Even with all the overlap, Bringing Baby Home brought up a few new details that others had not included.  It is a good Survey video.",1231286400,,194,4.078947368421052

2303608,4,B0009NSDES,I found this dvd to be very informative.  The format was laid out well and the actual demonstrations on the video were very helpful to see for a first-time mom.  A lot of my questions were answered and I liked the fact that there were excerpts from an ob-gyn and pediatrician.  I would recommend this video to a friend.,1175299200,,319,4.372881355932203

8063742,4,B0009NSDES,"Helpful to have this information at the ready for when we bring our baby home from the hospital.  It covered roughly the same content as an ""Expectant Parents Class"" I recently paid a lot of money to attend at a local parenting center.",1458086400,,235,4.465116279069767

8063747,5,B0009NSDES,"Awesome video to teach you the absolute basics of newborn baby care. A must watch for first time parents. Helpful in getting you through that 'How the hell do I take care of it after the hospital?!' feeling.

Some people won't get anything out of this. If you're not a first time parent, or you've spent time caring for a newborn before, a lot of the stuff in this video may seem like common sense. Also, if you've made it past the first few weeks with your baby, you've probably already figured all of this stuff out. For a lot of other people who don't know the first thing about newborn care, this video assumes you know nothing and will give you the absolute beginner information that you need to get through those first couple of weeks after bringing the baby home from the hospital. The video answers a lot of questions that you may feel embarrassed to ask, and information that other people may forget to tell you because they take it for granted.

I'm about to have my first baby, so it was super helpful for me, even answering questions I hadn't thought to ask. My wife had two kids from a previous marriage, and she said her first would've been so much easier if she had been able to watch this video then.

Some of the facts/information in this video is dated, and they could stand to update those parts, but it was not enough to knock off a star. Most of it is fine.",1433462400,2,1378,4.333333333333333

8063750,3,B0009NSDES,The video is ok. But not really necessary it's basically common sense. It was nice for us to see how to give a newborn a bath but you could just go on babycenter.com and watch that! I guess would recommend if you've never been around kids at all.,1376092800,,246,4.145833333333333
