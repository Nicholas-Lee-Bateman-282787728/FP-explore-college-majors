8214724,5,B000UTMKBS,"this drama is one of my top five all time favorite korean dramas.
while it sometimes falls victim to the typical drama ruts,this one stands out from the ordinary. and while one of the themes is death, it is more an afirmation of life, about making those around us happy, then it is about death. and there are some very funny, sweet moments throughout.
when i watched the first episode i thought i would hate it but the drama grew on me, and i found myself loving the charecters in the end.
this one is well worth buying.",1228176000,,520,4.316326530612245
