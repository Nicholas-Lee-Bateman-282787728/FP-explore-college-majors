8044656,3,B00074TB3G,"Although I am in agreement with the first few reviews (what's the point of a DVD format conversion without the chapters and the restaurant setting is not so comfortable to watch), this DVD is a great pro for an aspiring dancer who would like to see how it's done in a restuarant setting with small space. Also, while all the dancers in this video do have great technique and skill, I have to admit that it I found most if the performances boring. Belly dancers on a tight budget, the $40 isn't a great investment in my opinion.",1142553600,7,527,4.387755102040816
8044657,4,B00074TB3G,"Whilst this DVD is good value for money with almost 2 1/2 hours of performance, it is pretty annoying having to skip through the disc manually as the disc is not broken down into chapters. The venue could have been better (narrow aisle in a restaurant) but I have to admire the dancers who used veils in such a setting!",1126051200,7,319,4.333333333333333
8044658,1,B00074TB3G,"While I applaud anyone who can dance up and down a narrow restaurant aisle, dodging service people and customers, I don't care to see dancing in that venue.  The constant distractions were more than annoying.  As for the dancing, with just a couple of exceptions (and they were wonderful), it was boring!  No fire, no life, no joy.  Some interesting costuming, which I enjoyed, but some were down right vulgar!  So if you enjoy the skill and passion of belly dancing, stay away from this DVD.",1124668800,13,492,4.674418604651163
