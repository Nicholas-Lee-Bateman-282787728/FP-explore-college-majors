""That's very nice of you."" The counterfeiters work in a hidden basement. One man doesn't want Dr. Carter around, he could be recognized. John shows his marksmanship. Three men ride and shoot at the medicine show truck. John rides after them to stop them. The medicine show finds a place. John is invited to meet a man, Curly Joe, who offers him a deal, or else.
