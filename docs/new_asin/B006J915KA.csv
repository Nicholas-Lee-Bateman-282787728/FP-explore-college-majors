4992815,5,B006J915KA,"Lucky for me I'm able to attend Mike's class in the ATL.  But for those of you who can't, I HIGHLY recommend this video.  It's doable and easy to follow.  Although I'm not a dancer and never took dance lessons growing up, this DVD has allowed me to step up my game and feel more confident about learning hip hop.  You gotta get this!",1333756800,,333,4.15625
4992816,5,B006J915KA,This DVD is funky!!! I absolutely love Dance411 and Mike Peele.  Mike Peele will blow your mind.  Thank you so much Dance 411 and Mike Peele for delivering an amazing DVD.,1333065600,,171,4.483870967741935
4992817,5,B006J915KA,This dvd is 40 minutes of incredible hip hop energy.  The instructor has a gift to teach those that are beginners or advance.  I saw all levels of talent successfully comprehend the choreography as he continued to breakdown the different counts and techniques throughout the instructional.  I suggest it for all levels of dancers.,1332979200,,330,5.074074074074074
4992818,5,B006J915KA,This DVD is the best..there is never a dull moment.  Its full of energy and kept my attention the entire time.  As a former professional dancer it really made me feel like I never skipped a beat.  I'm not surprised because I love taking class at Dance 411.  You definitely won't be disappointed.,1332979200,,295,4.509433962264151
4992819,5,B006J915KA,This is such a cool video!  I love that it really feels like you are in class with Mike and that some of these dancers are truly recognizable...I love Jungle Boogie!  I would definitely recommend this video to all of my friends.  I'm not the best at catching on to hip hop moves but after watching this video I felt like I was dancing like a professional : )  Happy I bought it!,1332979200,,378,4.136986301369863
4992820,5,B006J915KA,This DVD is SO Helpful. It really makes me feel like I'm right there in the room! There is never a dull moment! It kept me up and moving. Thanks to Mike Peele and Dance411 I not only get a great work out but I have fun every time I do it!,1332720000,,238,3.5961538461538463
4992821,5,B006J915KA,"Love Dance 411 and Mike Peele!  This is HOT!  I want to take class at Dance 411, especially after seeing this.  I am a big fan of Mike Peele on YouTube.",1331251200,,152,3.838709677419355
4992822,2,B006J915KA,"I really like Mike Peele and his choreography and I was excited to find this video, but the camera work was horrible and it was hard to follow. I thought there might have been some hope in the breakdown sequences, but the camera would never focus on the whole body in one shot so you can see the flow of the whole move. Too many quick cuts and shots of the students. I wanted to see Mike's class as if I was in the front row. Instead, it was like being forced to watch from the back corner. Super bummed.",1391299200,,504,4.05
4992823,5,B006J915KA,"I love to dance, but I am no pro. I've taken Hip Hop classes through my high school 3 years ago, but other than that, I haven't taken any. I am currently on the 3rd 8 count and love it so far. Sure, I have to pause it and review a few times, but that comes with any good choreography. I feel the ""breakdown"" sections are pretty informative and the choreography is clear to me. I would definitely rent/ buy further choreography from Mike Peele.",1388620800,,443,4.223529411764706
4992824,3,B006J915KA,"Does anyone find it strange that all the reviews were written in the spring of 2012, a few days apart, and they are all roughly 2-3 sentences long and have the same sort of generalized positive tone about them?  No one breaks the video down or offers any real personal input about the video as people typically do in reviews.  I'm still interested in the DVD, and watched Mike Peele on Youtube and liked his moves.  Still, these reviews seem sketchy and I wish someone would give a genuine, in-depth review.",1371513600,16,507,4.549450549450549
4992825,3,B006J915KA,"Pretty good workout with pretty good choreography. I wouldn't say it was worth the price, I would rather attend a hip-hop class in-person.",1362700800,,138,5.043478260869565
4992826,5,B006J915KA,My son wanted to learn how to dance hip hop he loves it. It arrived on time and I would recommend this to anyone,1360281600,,112,3.7083333333333335
4992827,2,B006J915KA,I just bought the instant streaming version of this... and will prolly never complete it - simply because the vocal - where mike is screaming out the commands to his class... is about 4 times as loud as the music....  awful awful awful,1352592000,,235,4.465116279069767
4992828,4,B006J915KA,"<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dance-Hip-Hop-Now-Clean-Style-with-Mike-Peele/dp/B006J915KA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dance Hip Hop Now! Clean Style with Mike Peele</a>&nbsp;I see a few mixed reviews on this DVD, mostly about the camera angles.  I have to disagree with those reviews.  Maybe these people who gave those negative reviews did not watch long enough to see the ""breakdown sections"".  There are seven of them throughout that really go into good detail, but they don't begin to show until after the first 8-count.

The choreography is really good and clear, and I felt that it was easy to learn using the video the way it was presented.  I don't understand why people feel like all angles are all from the front, or that the video cuts away from the choreo.  Having watched it, I don't think this is true.  The choreo is repeated so many times that I knew it cold without problems (and I am just a novice dancer).  I saw plenty of varied angles that shows the steps clearly.

I give it 4/5 for good content and presentation and ease of use.  I like this video and recommend it.  I would like to see more titles coming from this company.

Viewers should really watch the whole thing (not just the beginning part of the video) and comment on the whole thing.  The video will go over everything many times and show various angles. Definitely enough for me to pick up the steps and fell pretty confident with it.",1348444800,,1458,5.025
4992829,1,B006J915KA,Horrible video! The way that it is shot and edited they will pan off in the middle of the combination to show how many people are in the class or random other things and you miss the choreography instruction. Don't waste your money or your time! It is going to leave you frustrated and doubting your abilities! I didn't even finish it!,1348185600,,335,4.419354838709677
4992830,5,B006J915KA,I loved the choreography from this DVD! It definitely boasted my confidence in learning how to dance Hip Hop. I can't wait for the next one.,1335916800,,140,4.423076923076923
4992831,2,B006J915KA,"The camera angles are shot from the front - all upper body shots -
Should be shot from behind and showing all of the body movements.
Learning it backwards is tough - not seeing the steps makes it almost impossible-
Disappointed - I was so excited to learn",1335744000,,255,4.333333333333333
8499266,1,B006J915KA,That was dumb..,1466380800,,15,4.333333333333333
8499267,4,B006J915KA,fun takes practice wish I could go to an actual class. great for beginner but not so much for the two left feet,1464739200,,111,3.869565217391304
8499268,3,B006J915KA,its ok but not impressed,1451260800,,24,4.0
8499269,1,B006J915KA,"As someone trying to learn how to dance hip hop, it has dance moves that are too complicated and goes over them way too quickly. If you're starting from 0, look for another product. If you have been to dance classes for a few years, this will work for you.",1451174400,,256,4.14
8499270,1,B006J915KA,Not what I thought it was.,1445472000,,26,3.5
8499271,1,B006J915KA,"It's not at all what you expect to have from such a dancer and choreographer: a very short choreography not even interesting (7x8) and a basic warm-up, and that's all. I don't recommend it at all. I was very disappointed !",1432425600,,222,4.439024390243903
8499272,5,B006J915KA,"Excellent video! Mike Peele please make more! I will buy them all! I want to get back into dancing again, but have a toddler and am a full time student so it's difficult to get to a class. This is an amazing video, great workout, great moves, not for beginners though!!",1424563200,2,269,4.294117647058823
8499273,4,B006J915KA,Love the fact that this cheap rental is for seven days. Yes it is one short dance routine but my teenage cheerleader daughter loves the fact that she can learn the dance and the squad can pick it up quick for use when all the other schools are using the same NCA dances. It is a relativity easy dance to learn and lots of fun. Mike breaks it down in counts of eight with many examples to bring the routine together.,1406764800,,415,4.135802469135802
8499274,2,B006J915KA,"It was just okay, it isn't really a teaching dvd",1405468800,,48,3.9
8499275,1,B006J915KA,If all you want to do is to learn 1 full routine & not get a work out then buy it. If not don't. I'm a fairly good dancer & I couldn't get the routine down.,1391904000,,156,3.361111111111111
