8302224,4,B001FPEH0S,"Some people may find the characters in Amos n Andy racist. As a performer I realize that without characters like Amos, Andy, King fish and Hattie MacDaniels we would  not have the opportunities in film and theatre that we do.
The episode about the Christmas present was excellent and could have been presented by a father and daughter of any race.  Overall I found the tape to be very well presented.",1235088000,6,400,4.619718309859155
