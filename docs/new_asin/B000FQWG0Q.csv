was a cover version of Chuck Berry's famous ""You never can tell"" from 1964.
The whole set-up was wonderful and I immediately started searching where
this clip was from and it appeared to be on a (obscure) DVD from 1985 called
Wllie & The Poor Boys. I purchased it from Amazon hoping the rest of the DVD
would be similar to that one song. Wrong!! The rest is horrible not only be-
cause of the songs chosen but also of the poor poor quality of the filming.
It only holds a few songs and the rest are commentaries on the benefit show
to come with a.o. Ringo Starr who does not participate in the music.
I won't play it again and decided to just import the the song from i-tunes.
Please don't spend your money on this.",1293148800,,786,4.143790849673203
