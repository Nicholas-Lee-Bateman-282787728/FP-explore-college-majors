8617135,3,B00FN8WO8A,"Poor quality video, terrible sound recording, lousy acting. Not worth the price unless you are an old fan which can't do without Daee Jaan Napelon!!",1409356800,2,148,4.96
8617136,5,B00FN8WO8A,"For any generation of Iranian , this series is mandatory to watch. I know it sounds a bit harsh and funny but I mean it. Every time you watch it, you will find a new thing. The story is just some how relevant to many of our lives. Each one of us has (or at least knows) one ""Daee Jan"" in the family. The actors are not only great but also beyond natural. Seems that it was their life story too. Have fun watching it. I'm sure you will and you will watch it again and again.",1399680000,2,473,3.88659793814433
