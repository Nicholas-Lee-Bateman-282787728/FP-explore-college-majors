6791728,5,B00PBE2H6U,"This was an amazing movie. I have always watched this series and when I saw that this movie was coming out it was a must buy. I wished it was longer than an hour and a half. However, I did enjoy it and if you enjoy the series than this is a must have. If you enjoyed the series, than you will love this movie.",1421280000,,309,3.769230769230769
6791729,3,B00PBE2H6U,"This movie has no impact on the series. As typical with movies for anime series the movie just uses the character and creates a new plot to introduce and conclude. It was nice being able to see the characters of a series I enjoyed, but I guess I hoped for more from the movie than what I got. It was good as a stand-alone movie, but does absolutely nothing in way of character development or the ""A Certain Magical Index"" series plot. This could have been called ""The Miracle of Endymion"" with completely different characters and it would have been the same to me.

So, I took 1 star off for not having any impact to the ""A Certain Magical Index"" series.
I took another star off for it not having the option to switch to Japanese audio with English subtitles. Nothing against the voice actors/actresses but I watched the series in Japanese for 96 episodes and all of a sudden switching to English threw me a bit off. Especially the songs, with Japanese they just sound a lot better. The English version of it just sounded like someone speaking in a tone.

Overall, you can skip this movie if you're looking for some story continuation, as there is none. If you like the series you may enjoy watching the characters in action again, but for me personally, as someone who really enjoyed A Certain Magical Index and A Certain Scientific Railgun I was a bit disappointed in this movie.",1421280000,3,1381,4.52
6791730,5,B00PBE2H6U,"Awesome is all i can say. This movie is freaking epic.
The HD visuals are nice and crisp, the sound is great and the action and bits of comedy tie it together well.",1421280000,,164,4.0
6791731,4,B00PBE2H6U,"Just thought I'd write a snippet about how great this movie is (in line with the rest of the franchise, anyway). It functions like an extra-long episode of ""A Certain Magical Index,"" so I would refrain from watching it unless you've at least seen the entirety of both Index and Railgun, or else you might be kind of puzzled as to the states and relationships of some of the characters (specifically Accelerator). Also, since this story happens last chronologically, you sort-of owe it to yourself to do so. The animation is positively eye-blowing, and the story is a rather intriguing one. The music is especially emphasized, and for good reason since one of the newer characters introduced is a pop idol. Even so, the characters are what make this piece. Sure, you've got Touma's self-righteousness blowing off all over the place, but that's nothing when you consider the heart and passion the voices behind the art put into their roles. Of course, how you feel about the characters has probably already been determined in the series, but I digress. Unless you've watched the entirety of Clannad about sixty times, you might even shed a tear towards the end as the movie actually pulls out a tiny twist that plays a big part for one character. Intelligent, entertaining, beautiful, euphonious...It's certainly a must-have on the shelf for any Index fan, and perhaps any anime enthusiast for that matter. It's not perfect (certainly no Studio Ghibli production), even though I give it four stars and a heap of compliments, but I think these imperfections will vary depending on the viewer. I give this extra-long Index episode my hearty recommendation; take my word as you see fit.",1421193600,7,1681,4.922535211267606
6791732,3,B00PBE2H6U,"Meh is the best way to describe how I felt while watching this movie. Also not going to say who, but one character jumps from space and falls to earth, and there is zero explanation as to how that character was fine. It wasn't even a moment of worry that the character was falling to the earth it was just like hey I'll talk to you later. Now if this character ever falls in the series off of anything shorter than the distance from the moon to the earth and gets hurt, my brain my just explode trying to comprehend it.

On a good note of the movie we get to see Touma dish out loads of justice all over some girls face for not living their life correctly.",1421107200,,656,4.0852713178294575

6791741,3,B00PBE2H6U,"Not a bad movie, but the plot is weak.  I agree with previous comments that they were so focused on bringing every significant character into the story that the plot suffered.  That being said, as a great fan of the ""Certain"" series, I enjoyed it - but this is not the way to introduce anyone else to Index or Railgun.",1429228800,,318,4.283333333333333

6791743,3,B00PBE2H6U,"Not a bad movie overall.
It does stand alone from the Index and Railgun Series so it is enjoyable without having seen the series.
However having knowledge of the events and who the characters are definitely helps on plot development.

I'd say rent or stream unless you are a fan of the above series.",1428796800,,299,4.537037037037037
6791744,2,B00PBE2H6U,"I binge watched every episode available in the index/railgun series prior to watching this. Honestly I believe in the saying curiosity killed the cat but satisfaction brought him back. Meaning that if you really like the dual series by all means watch this movie but only if you can stream it. Sadly this movie offered no satisfaction at all. The plot was generic and seemed so forced. The singing in the dubbed version was horrible. I literally cringed whenever she screeched like a harpy in its death throes. Usually I watch anime subtitled but for some reason I watched the first season of Index dubbed and liked the VA. So I don't know if the singing is good with the original Japanese VA. Some people have said that this is less a movie and more like a long episode and I agree... It was a long boring episode. I wish that Kamijo would have lost his memory again so he could be rewritten. He's become so one dimensional and boring. Repeating the same thing over and if I have to hear him say ""I am going to destroy your illusion!"" Any more I am going to destroy.... Something. Huge, huge let down of a movie.",1427500800,,1113,4.434146341463415

6791751,4,B00PBE2H6U,"Best described as a decent movie for the fans of the Railgun and Index Series that acts more like a 90 minute episode. I would highly suggest it to anyone who has seen both seasons of both series and enjoyed them. Majority of the appeal comes from being jam packed with fan-service moments and character cameos, however the plot isn't so complicated that someone who hasn't watched the series wouldn't be able to follow it. As long as they knew that the basic premise and plot of the franchise is that their is a heating political cold war between a scientifically advanced city developing psychic powers and theologically based magic. At the end of the day any complaints or praises would end up being superficial, it was designed to be a celebration of the franchise by being 90 minutes of fan-service and that is exactly what it is.",1425600000,,835,4.648648648648648

6791758,5,B00PBE2H6U,"A certain magical musical movie would be the correct term to describe this movie. The soundtracks on this movie are superb and has excellent plot story involved.

8687282,3,B00PBE2H6U,"The music just didn't fit with the American lyrics. The singer was overpowering compared to the music, but it blended well in the Japanese version.

The VA's were great, especially for a Funimation dub. Unfortunately they have a habit of screwing up meanings. Shut-aura is subtle but an obvious take on the character, so where did they even think Shitara was a fit?

That's almost as bad as taking a character called Grim-jaw and... long story short, Funi has a history of messing up meanings. 5 star movie",1514592000,,506,4.738636363636363
8687283,3,B00PBE2H6U,Ok movie but the series is better in my opinion. Voice acting is good and the commentary is good to. The movie just does not do the series justice and my opinion could have been written better and the j pop idol feels more like a weird plug in. Ya if your a fan get it. If not there are better movies to be had.,1512691200,,311,3.8
8687284,3,B00PBE2H6U,Was a huge fan of the Certain Magical Index series. The movie did not really satisfy me though. But I'm not the biggest fan of OVA's or ONA's. Watched it once and now it's collecting dust.,1502668800,,188,4.25

8687288,5,B00PBE2H6U,"I've probably watched anime longer than most of you (I watched&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Astro-Boy/dp/B000E3LGDI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Astro Boy</a>&nbsp;in first run on a B&W TV!), and there are certain things I like more than other things: I like heroes who lay it on the line, who accept the challenge, who stand between Danger and Everyone and Everything else.  (Similar stories can be found in the old TOEI classics of my youth&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Horus-Prince-of-The-Sun-Little-Norse-Prince/dp/B00PEA6K0A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Horus, Prince of The Sun (Little Norse Prince)</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Wonderful-World-of-Puss-N-Boots/dp/B000F48DAA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Wonderful World of Puss 'N Boots</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Animal-Treasure-Island/dp/B000BLI5Q4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Animal Treasure Island</a>.)

Normally, when you hear that a movie addition to an adapted anime TV series has been specially written as opposed to being adapted from existing material, that's a warning sign; hearing that it focuses on an idol singer is another.  However, this movie was written by the original creator of the light novel series, Kazuma Kamachi, and, clearly, he didn't phone it in.  Set basically between the first and second arcs of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Certain-Magical-Index-II-Season-2/dp/B01EIW2RLU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Certain Magical Index II: Season 2</a>, (episodes 7 & 8), this is a story that was never told until now, yet it has all the heroism and the twists we've come to expect.

Note: As near as I can determine right now, the series should be watched in the following order:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Certain-Scientific-Railgun-Season-1-Blu-ray-DVD-Combo/dp/B00OLII9RI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Certain Scientific Railgun: Season 1 (Blu-ray/DVD Combo)</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Certain-Magical-Index-Season-1-Blu-ray-DVD-Combo/dp/B00MP2G3C0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Certain Magical Index: Season 1 (Blu-ray/DVD Combo)</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Certain-Scientific-Railgun-S-Season-2-Blu-ray-DVD-Combo/dp/B01711CI7S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Certain Scientific Railgun S: Season 2 (Blu-ray/DVD Combo)</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Certain-Magical-Index-II-Season-2-Blu-ray-DVD-Combo/dp/B01EIW2RLU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Certain Magical Index II: Season 2 (Blu-ray/DVD Combo)</a>, and this set.",1476403200,6,2831,9.749049429657795
