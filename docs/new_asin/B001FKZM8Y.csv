8302126,5,B001FKZM8Y,"This is an Awesome series! I would love to purchase it! My child has Autism. They are enamored with the word of God..they are begging me to purchase this VHS series for their upcoming birthday in July. Unfortunately, the seller has the price set astronomically high ($257.01) it is out of my budget to afford this gift for my child. It disheartens me to have to make this comment and to tell my child that Mommy can't afford it right now. We should not have to pay so much money to be comforted by the word of God.....",1495324800,,518,4.295918367346939
