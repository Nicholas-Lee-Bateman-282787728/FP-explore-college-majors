I've followed it all the way to the end and still watch the reruns on Oxygen, KDOCTV, and on Nick@Night. I've even introduced my 17 year old niece, who's never watched Roseanne before, in joining me.

I've waited for sooo long for the DVD, constantly doing searches to see if it's in the works. I hope it does come on DVD soon or I'm going to die of boredom from all the shows they have on TV now! I can't wait for it to be released! The dvd collection will be passed from one generation to another. It will fast become a family treasure.",1091750400,6,667,4.2936507936507935

I would love for this to be released on DVD soon so that I have it all the time and I can take it on the road with me, as well.  I love the Connor Family and I look forward to watching everyday.

Amazon is an amazing company and I just don't have any complaints .I do wish that when I purchase these episodes and seasons that the shows would not cut off before their finished the last minute or two of the show like a punchline it gets cut off on every single episode and I would be thrilled if there someway you can go in and fix that .thanks so much .......,1466640000,4,529,4.135922330097087

1591829,5,B00005JNF7,"I watched this with my family growing up, this was the first show that had a family like mine. They had trouble with money and jobs and made it funny. There isn't one person on this show that wasn't funny. I grew up with an Aunt Jackie and really wished the one from this show was mine rather then the one I got! I always loved John Goodman he is so funny. All the characters on this show are great and you can relate to them in one way or another. Especially those of us who grew up watching this show. Even the part time characters are funny. George Clooney as Booker was funny and really cute to boot! Estelle Harris who played Blanche Barrow in Bonnie and Clyde movie is really funny on this show. I can't think of her name but she plays Bonnie on this show. I found out she really was a singer and even toured with Eric Clapton. Even Tom Arnold is funny on this show, and I haven't seen him be funny in years!! Every time this show is on we watch even to this day. This show is an A+ with us!",1451952000,,997,4.015075376884422

1591834,5,B00005JNF7,"The family and lifestyle portrayed in this sitcom is completely different from how I grew up, yet I found this show incredibly insightful even as a kid when it first aired. The first three seasons are, in my personal opinion, the best ones because they're unpretentious and down to earth. I also personally HATED when they replaced Lecy Goranson with that horribly inept, ill-suited fake Becky.

For me, this show made me realize at a young age that not everyone has the same opportunities, the same family life, the same options - and that things I took for granted were much harder to come by for others. At a time nowadays where there's seldom if ever, it seems, any kind of moral content in tv shows, I still relish watching this comedic relief that gave you a dose of reality without being too somber. Truly a classic, no matter what anyone says.",1444003200,,851,4.598684210526316
1591835,5,B00005JNF7,"You can say whatever you want to about Roseanne. Yes, she is bawdy. Yes, she used the tabloids to the hilt. Yes, she has said and done some strange things. But her sitcom is one of the best ever, and I am a HUGE sitcom fan. _Roseanne_ broached subjects in the 1980s that, while fairly common today, were ground-breaking. Masturbation, abortion, teenage birth control, homosexuality, and even her own life were explored in a highly humorous yet thought-provoking way. The first Lesbian kiss on TV was on _Roseanne_. While everyone else watched thirtysomething and went into massive debt trying to live up to that image, _Roseanne_ presented a lifestyle most of us can afford and identify with. Roseanne deserves her spot as an American icon for this series alone, if nothing else. This is a sitcom not to be missed, and I'm so glad Amazon sells it as streaming video. I will always have it to enjoy again and again. (Of course, it helps that I think David & Darlene are the best couple ever. The end of the episode in which their baby is born always makes me cry with joy, and I've seen it at least a dozen times. ""We are not bodies with souls; we are souls with bodies."" Amen, Rosie. Thanks for saying it and demonstrating the miracle of knowing it.)",1442102400,,1250,4.56

The original release was from the current product you see on today's TV with several minutes edited out due to the expansion of commercial time.

1591963,5,B00005JNF7,"I don't remember this DVD collection being edited for syndication. I thought they were complete episodes especially with the credits at the end that changed in every episode during the first season. My DVD is perfectly fine and I remember watching the series when it aired on television so I can't tell if these are the edited syndicated version. Still I'm happy with it, I had a grand reliving memories of my youth watching Roseanne.

I remember how Roseanne Barr first captured my attention while she was on the Hollywood Squares game show in the mid-eighties. When she got her sitcom deal, I knew instinctively that it was going to be successful. Roseanne's personality comes through in the character and in the show. Roseanne was nothing like anything else on television. The house wasn't spotless and Roseanne was no June Cleaver nor Clair Huxtable but she was Roseanne Connor who was a loving wife and mother and sister and even daughter at times and friend.

Roseanne Barr started a revolution in the late eighties with her view of how real families are and the Connor were more working middle class family with a lot of laughs and love all at once. You can't help but laugh and enjoy the show. You see yourself in one of the characters. The supporting cast included talented John Goodman and Steppenwolf actress Laurie Metcalf as husband, Dan, and sister, Jackie. The children actors also did a very believable job in their roles. Lecy Goranson played feminine Becky; Sara Gilbert played tomboy Darlene; and Michael Fishman was perfect as DJ.

Their interaction among the family and the cast was more realistic than most shows. The first season had Dan working as a contractor and Roseanne working at Wellman Plastics. George Clooney played Booker, Roseanne's and Jackie's manager, in the first season. The supporting cast also featured Chicago based actress Natalie West as family friend, Crystal. Guest stars included Ned Beatty as Dan's dad; John Randolph and Oscar winner Estelle Parsons as Roseanne and Jackie's parents.

If you want love and laughter, please enjoy the first season of this beloved family sitcom that forever changed television in the late eighties.",1416960000,,2179,4.978021978021978

1592037,5,B00005JNF7,"Let's face it, Roseanne is the greatest American TV comedy of all time, on par with I Love Lucy.

The early seasons of this show were, in my opinion, unparalleled. When they originally ran, I remember loving them because they reminded me of my own family (I was about the age of Darlene at the time). No other show was brave enough to show a family with a house that needed work, parents that needed work, and a family dynamic that had warts but at its core was all about love and concern for one another. The relationship between Dan and Roseanne was so real and believable that you forget you're watching a TV show. And John Goodman's portrayal as a loving dad is so on-point that it's hard to believe he wasn't even a parent for the first season or so (thanks, Wikipedia!).

In its later years, this show jumped the shark (the lotto? for real?), but the first couple of seasons of Roseanne are my ""desert island"" pick for TV.",1396137600,,928,4.3895348837209305

But the packaging! Horrible! This isn't a snap-in DVD case like every other DVD case on the planet. It's pretty much just a plastic box made to look like a DVD case. The DVDs are held in flimsy paper sleeves which are set in the case. But you get what you pay for and that explains why they can sell 3-disc sets for such a low price.",1392076800,,504,4.25

1592179,5,B00005JNF7,"Roseanne is my all-time favorite show, for many reasons. I was deployed to the Middle East when Anchor Bay began releasing Roseanne on DVD...and let me tell you, receiving these DVDs as each season was released provided me with that comfort I so desperately needed to escape an oftentimes harsh reality. That being said, I became livid when I realized that not every season was completely unedited. Being an avid fan for 20 some years, I knew each episode inside and out for the most part...but it wasn't until I bought Mill Creek's TRULY unedited release of Roseanne Season 1 that I realized how much had been cut out of the episodes Anchor Bay released. It may not always be much, but a good 20 seconds or so of additional character interactions in a scene is fun to watch, especially now that I know I've bee missing out! Even though Anchor Bay's DVD packaging is of better quality, the quality of Mill Creek's actual uncut episodes is what's important. Save yourself some annoyance and money and buy the Mill Creek releases instead of Anchor Bay's...they have honored this groundbreaking and relevant show, as well as the loyal fans, by giving us the opportunity to see EVERY second of these episodes...without having to worry if the smallest wisecrack or glance was left out.

Amazon has decided to jam the reviews of the four disc edited set in the same place as the three disc unedited.

1592349,4,B00005JNF7,"Roseanne - what a great show. Acerbic, rapid-fire jokes, at its time ground-breaking by being firmly grounded in blue collar reality. John Goodman's Dan is one of the great, heroic, no-holds-barred sitcom performances that deservedly won him a Golden Globe. It's wonderful to have the first season on DVD, uncut for the first time. Hours of nonstop laughter for the wife and me.

Now, the packaging seems a bit odd at first. It looks like a regular DVD case, but it houses three black paper sleeves for the individual discs. I'm sure that makes it cheap and easy to produce, so if that were all, I couldn't really care less.

However, I'm amazed that no review has mentioned the smell. The inside of the packaging, the paper sleeves and the discs themselves emit a very strong odor - like burnt electric circuitry. The kind of smell that lingers after a house fire, the kind of smell that generates mental images of seriously unhealthy conditions in the packaging plant, the kind of smell that makes you think ""That can't be good"" and wash your hands very thoroughly every time you handle the set.

My first thought was that something was seriously wrong with the copy I got, but the same parcel contained seasons 2 and 3 as well. Both ""feature"" the same stink. I shall ditch everything but the discs themselves and hope that the aroma dissipates over time.

Five star content, one star off for whatever smelled up the box set.",1349308800,,1427,4.673306772908367
1592350,5,B00005JNF7,"What can I say about Roseanne and this show that hasn't already been said. It was groundbreaking for its time but still endures today.

Roseanne and her family often had a lot of troubles and bad times just like anyone else at the time but even through it all they loved one another and were there for each other when it really counted.

I would have to easily count this among one of my favorite shows all time and am looking forward to getting more of the seasons.

While I wouldn't necessarily recommend younger kids watch the show because of some of the language and what not but I think it would be OK for PG13 and up. It could even be used with some kids as a springboard to discuss family issues, ""growing up"" topics, and even things such as depression.

I recommend that you find it on TV check it out and then buy the seasons because you won't want to miss an episode and they tend to play certain episodes more than others on TV.

The only thing that kinda dissapointed me, which i knew before i bought it was the way the disc are packaged. i wouldnt have minded spending alittle extra money for them to add alittle more plastic for the disc to connect too.

1592354,3,B00005JNF7,"I'd been waiting for these to be released on DVD for a while, but perhaps due to rights reasons, Mill Creek kind of did a B job with this release. Flattering as it was that this finally came out on DVD uncut, there are a few things that kind of irked me. For starters, there were several reviews from you, Amazon users, who claimed that all of the special features transferred over to the DVD set. The one thing that people overlooked were the awesome introductions that Roseanne gave on the first DVD set to a handful of episodes. Discussing her dislike of the show before Lovers Lane, or her ex husband's cameo in Saturday were sadly missed. Also, when the seasons were first put on DVD, you could tell that Betacam SP preservation copies were made of the 1"" masters for syndication. The 1"" masters have deteriorated over time. The image was vibrant and much sharper in these syndication masters. The previous releases of uncut episodes (seasons 2-8) would use these higher quality syndication masters and insert shots of the deteriorated 1"" tapes in missing pieces. Miller Creek, on the other hand, opts to transfer everything from the 1"" masters. The audio is obviously warped (noticeable in the laughing) and the image is dull, with dropout lines visible throughout. Some don't even appear to be masters, but from broadcast tapes probably in a leaky closet at ABC (who includes the ""In Stereo Where Available"" logos on some episodes but not in others?!?!?!) Finally, you'd think they'd do something, anything, with the special features to liven them up a little. Nope...not so much.

Glad the little moments in my favorite season are now available, but I should have just gone to the UCLA archive and watched them and been sated with my original DVD set.",1330992000,3,1759,4.767213114754099

1592411,4,B00005JNF7,"First of all, I must give big kudos to Mill Creek for releasing this season uncut. Finally, there's a proper release for it. I just wanted to point out some technical issues this set has.

*The case this set comes in is a joke. It's an odd, over-sized case with each of the three discs put in paper inserts and jammed into this little square thing... very strange. I own about a gazillion dvd's and I've never come across such an odd case.

*Although the video/audio quality of this set is consistently adequate, it is not as good as the Anchor Bay release. But at least it's the full episodes.

*The one exception with video quality is the episode ""Bridge Over Troubled Sonny"". The video quality of this episode is HORRIBLE. I don't understand why it's not consistent with the rest of the season. Trust me, most of you will notice the difference. Maybe the original print of that episode is damaged or something. It's very dark and blurry/fuzzy.

*The other strange thing about this set is that there are brief technical glitches in the print, noticeable in two or three episodes. It happens three or four times during the episode ""Mall Story"". It looks like several dots appear on the screen, but they only last a second, fortunately.

*Speaking of ""Mall Story""... this one episode is the EXACT same length as the Anchor Bay syndicated version! There is virtually no difference between the two. Was this one episode always that length? I don't understand why this one would be shorter than every other episode when it originally aired. I wonder if anyone could come forward and point out if anything is missing.

If you want to purchase this set, good luck finding it in stores. I went to all the major chains and NONE of them carried this title. I went to a Best Buy and someone told me that this show is too ""dated"" to be carried in stores anymore. I would just get it online.

Carsey-Werner messed up big-time back in 2005 when Anchor Bay released S1 that August with cut episodes. I am just very grateful to the wonderful people at Mill Creek for releasing such a reasonably-priced set with all the S1 episodes uncut as they originally aired on ABC. While this was one of the weaker seasons IMO due to the fact that Roseanne was still in ""stand-up"" mode and would crack a big grin right after delivering a punchline, Goodman, Metcalf and the kids are already running on all cylinders here. To boot, we get a young George Clooney as Booker, as well as a terrific season-finale where Roseanne in full Norma-Rae mode, leads a revolt against the system as she and her friends walk out on their dead-end factory jobs.

And while I was hoping for cover art featuring a S1 pic (Rosey with the long curly hair and sweatshirt with the sleeves pushed up), at least they used a S2 pic, which is better than the S4 pic Anchor Bay used on their original S1 set.

The discs themselves are housed in black paper sleeves, like most budget-priced Mill Creek releases, in a black snapcase. It's not the greatest way to package them, but at this price one can't complain.",1309392000,7,1253,4.589285714285714

1592461,5,B00005JNF7,"Rosanne revolved around the trials and tribulations of a working-class family, living in middle America. Rosanne Arnold starred as the main character, Rosanne Connor. She and her husband Dan, were forever trying to manage, while holding-down marginal blue-collar jobs.

When Rosanne premiered, the TV landscape was littered with sitcoms starring Yuppie characters, such as Seinfeld, Friends, Murphy Brown, etc. It was so refreshing to finally see a comedy like Rosanne, that was about the average working-stiff. Many more Americans, could identify with the down-to-earth issues that the Connors faced, than with the glamorous lives of the characters in the Yuppie-sitcoms.

The considerable comic talents of the cast, were the main thing that made Rosanne such a brilliant sitcom. Rosanne Arnold is the most bombastically sarcastic comedienne, in the history of television. Female audiences were glad to finally see a sitcom matriarch, sound-off about her troubles in the gloriously uninhibited way that Rosanne did. John Goodman as Dan Connor, was the perfect foil for Rosanne's abrasive style of comedy. They were like a modern-day version of Ralph and Alice, in the Honeymooners. Only Rosanne was much more outspoken, than Alice ever was.

Rosanne will go down in history, as another one of the great classic sitcoms. Watching this show is a must, for those that like comedies that star sassy, sharply funny female characters.",1261958400,,1429,5.3991031390134525

I don't know;  I'd rather get uncut versions if I can, so I'd been holding out for either when it's on sale at a very low price or when it's re-released in an uncut edition.  I found out unexpectedly that it's on sale with a price so low I decided to order it.  This set arrived within days, all ready to play.  I enjoyed the episodes, all under 22 minutes each, especially one I don't ever remember seeing before: 'Father's Day' (ep. 14 on disc 2).

It's true that all episodes here are edited similar to what's been shown in syndication.  There's a scene I remember in the one with Darlene finding her newspaper job more than she can handle that was omitted ('The Monday Thru Friday Show', ep. 12 on disc 2): if I remember right, after the commercial fadeout midway through, Darlene reports to her boss for not delivering all the newspapers.  The boss goes into lecture mode, but before he's finished Darlene interrupts him and asks him point-blank if she's fired.  The boss says yes... Anyway, I don't remember everything from this season as I wasn't into back then.  Nonetheless, I got to see everything and enjoyed it.

Box art dressed in McDonald's colors look nice.  I like the trivia questions listed inside the cases.  Ditto for the extras included.  Not just that but the extras as well as the commentaries are closed-captioned (no subtitles).  Most other shows on DVD can't claim this fact.  Thank you, Roseanne and everyone responsible for putting it together.

Would I recommend this product?  Yes, but considering the edited content you might want to wait until it's on sale or when it's re-released in uncut form.  Don't know about the latter, but at least it's an idea.  Enjoy...",1211328000,4,1778,4.655948553054662

1592525,5,B00005JNF7,"My five star rating refers to season one of ""Roseanne"", not the cut version of the episodes offered on this DVD. I agree with the outrage everyone else has expressed over this treatment the series received in this regard.

I would say that this first season of Roseanne was a 5 star season, that seasons 2-4 were six star seasons, and that seasons 5 and 6 went back to mere 5-star quality. In the first half of the season you can really tell that the characters are struggling somewhat to figure out exactly who they should be. Even Roseanne herself seems to be struggling to translate her stand-up comedy routine into a half-hour show that involves character interaction.

To me, the first show that really had the characters clicking on a macro level was ""Lover's Lane"" in which the Conner family along with Booker, Crystal and Jackie, decide to spend an evening bowling. Becky gets all dressed up to impress a boy she likes that works at the bowling alley, but is afraid that Roseanne is going to say something to embarrass her. Roseanne does keep Becky guessing all night long, but ultimately, she doesn't do or say anything to hurt her daughter's chances with the young man. Jackie and Booker make a bet on the game: if Booker wins, Jackie  spends the night with him, and if Jackie wins Booker cleans her apartment. It really is a series classic even though nothing special really happens. The magic is in all of the little moments between characters, not in the event - in this case bowling - that has brought them together.

""Nightmare on Oak Street"" is another great episode in which Darlene goes into puberty. Dan's reaction to the news is classic - he punches Darlene in the arm and says ""way to go."" Darlene is upset about the whole thing because she figures she will be expected to leave her tomboy stage. Roseanne has a talk with her and explains to her that being ultra-feminine is Becky's version of womanhood and that Darlene will find her own unique way of expressing herself that may be nothing like her sister's. This is groundbreaking stuff for almost twenty years ago.

One of the more puzzling episodes in retrospect is ""Dear Mom and Dad"", where Roseanne's parents visit. This is the only episode in which Roseanne's father appears, and he comes across as an annoying yet harmless man. In later seasons he is described by both Jackie and Roseanne as having been an abusive father, which seems wildly out of character considering his demeanor during his sole appearance on the show. Particularly funny is the very end of this episode in which Bruce Willis makes a surprise visit to the set, jumping into bed with Roseanne, planting a kiss on her, and telling her that he figured he'd visit since he ""no longer has anything to do on Tuesday nights"". Younger viewers probably won't realize he was referring to his show ""Moonlighting"" that had been recently cancelled (1989), and that he and John Goodman were the best of friends in real life.

The series finale has some real surprises in it that sets up taking the show in a completely different direction in season two, and as a result this is the first and last season for a few recurring characters that were not regular members of the cast.

I highly recommend the first season, but not this particular DVD set. Maybe someday it will be re-released with the missing footage restored.",1156204800,3,3357,4.67005076142132

1592562,1,B00005JNF7,"""Roseanne"" has been my favorite show for years, no, not just sitcom, it's my favorite all time show.

""Roseanne"" was groundbreaking, influential, brilliantly written, amazingly acted, and hilariously funny for the majority of its run (any fan will tell you that the series slipped in its final two seasons).  While the first season is far from my favorite (due to several episodes that seem to fit the style of cheesy shows like ""The Cosby Show"" or ""Full House"") it does have a number of excellent episodes, including ""A Bride Over Troubled Sonny,"" ""A Nightmare On Oak Street,"" ""Workin' Overtime,"" ""Dear Mom And Dad,"" and especially the season finale, ""Let's Call It Quits.""  For years, I anxiously awaited the day when this brilliant show would be made available on DVD, uncut and commercial free, to be enjoyed for years and years to come without the hassle of grainy, syndicated reruns polluted by ridiculous editing and long commercial breaks.

Around November 2004, the news came that my favorite show would be on DVD, and soon!  I was so excited, I literally jumped up and danced for several minutes, and I didn't care how ridiculous I looked.  A few short months later, I read the official release date of the COMPLETE first season:  August 30th, 2005.  I ran upstairs to my calendar and marked the date in big black letters.

August came, and it was pretty late in August when I happened to read the official Amazon.com review of the series.  The review went into good detail about just what made ""Roseanne"" such an amazing show, and I could barely contain my glee at the idea of owning it!  Then, I reached the end of the review, where it was noted that the episodes in the DVD set were the syndicated versions, edited by 2-3 minutes.

My heart sank.  I couldn't believe it.  How could they do this to me?  How could they do this to the millions of ""Roseanne"" fans around the world?  It was ridiculous and unfair and I couldn't understand the logic.  One thing was for sure, though.  I would not be buying this set if my life depended on it.  Edited episodes are unacceptable for ANY show, but the notion of putting inferior episodes of ""Roseanne"" out on DVD is a million times worse.

So, that's why you see a one star rating above this review.  You can watch the syndicated versions of this classic sitcom at least four times a day, on various stations.  Why pay good money for the same thing?

There is good news, though.  I wasn't the only person angry about the butchery of this set, and the other fans joined me in being very vocal to the company about our displeasure, and because of this (and the low sales of the first season, as well as the amazingly large number of preorders that were cancelled), the second season was released December 6th completely uncut, and the same treatment will be given to seasons three, four, five, six, seven, eight, and nine.

You may notice some reviews were people say, ""Get a life!  Who cares if the episodes are edited?""  Well, the people who did care managed to get the next eight seasons put out uncut and unedited, which I think any fan would be grateful for.

This does not make this set good, though.  This set is still disgraceful and the fact that it remains for sale in stores is an insult and a disgrace.

Do yourself a favor.  But the second season and the third season which will be released March 26th, 2006, and then the seasons that come after that, but avoid this edited garbage until it is rereleased in its proper form, as audiences across America got to see it in 1988 and 1989.

1592622,5,B00005JNF7,"Of all the TV shows in recent years to deserve a season DVD release, Roseanne tops my list of personal favorites. Not only is Roseanne Barr iconic for the 80's, but her TV show chronicling the white collar antics of the Conner family and their friends earned a place in many an american living room. Set in Lanford Illinois, Roseanne became a show many of us could identify with. Her brash reality is something that the TV mothers of the 50's, 60's and 70's were never truly allowed to be shown on network TV and was much closer to the lives of middle America than the June Cleavers of the world. For me, I think Roseanne is one of the bravest and most well written of the 80's sitcoms, tackling topics that were taboo until Roseanne dealt with them. Spousal abuse, alcoholism, homosexuality, sexual harrassment in the workplace are just a few of the topics that earned network respect among the shows peers. Definately worth a second look and always guaranteed a laugh - I recommend this DVD set whole heartedly. I actually took mine to a performance that Roseanne Barr was giving, and she graciously signed it for me! Check it out - season two is due to be released in December of 2005.",1129680000,,1188,4.530232558139535

I like how the DVD is a bit more personal, like showing her thoughts of an episode ( certain ones ) right before it airs. I just think it's a very well thought DVD!

The cast appeared on Larry King Live and someone called the show asking about the DVDS

Heres a transcript from the LarrykingLive website

CALLER: I bought the season one DVD of ""Roseanne."" And I noticed that you guys used the edited syndicated version.

BARR: I know everybody is so mad. You guys, I don't know if you guys have heard.

GOODMAN: I wouldn't know.

CALLER: How come? And are you going to fix that for season two?

BARR: Yes, we ...

KING: Explain what he means.

BARR: Well, they, I don't know, they -- for season one for some reason they accidentally put out the syndicated, edited ...

GOODMAN: OK. Yes. So ...

BARR: But they have assured me today that from season two on, it will be the regular network.

GOODMAN: I'm sorry, I thought all that stuff was at the, like the bumpers at the end and stuff like that. Remember we'd go to -- I'm sorry ...

BARR: We didn't start that until third season.

GOODMAN: OK.

KING: What did they edit out for syndication?

BARR: They always take out two minutes when they syndicate, for more commercials. But, so they went ahead and put that in, but people are mad, the fans. So we're making sure, you know, that from the second season on, it's the original run.

So there! You heard the truth from ROSEANNE herself! Still don't believe it? It's because of the REAL fans of this show complaining that we will get the real UNCUT episodes from now on!

1592665,5,B00005JNF7,"I love Roseanne.  I'm 24 years old and grew up with this show.  It was so fun to see a family on TV I could relate to.  The Conners did not have a perfect cookie cutter home or kids or clothes.  It was great to just see a typical family.  Granted, they were a bit more crude than my family, but that's why they were a funny sitcom family and my family was not, hehe.  Anyway, I definitely recommend this show.  However, if you want to hold out and wait until they rerelease the first season completely uncut, then I think that's fine.  I couldn't wait, but based on Roseanne's comments on Larry King, I know they will never release an cut season again and will most likely rerelease an uncut version of the first season in the future.

Well - that scene is gone. The ending credits at the end of the episode where the family has it's picture taken, show the series of pictures that are so beautiful and charming. If I remember correctly - on this DVD you don't even see the closing credits of that particular episode - because they ran out of time or something. And I remember all that after about six years of not having seen a single episode of Roseanne! (Back then we got the original network shows - not the syndicated versions).

Roseanne was one of the earlier shows to show middle class families as they really are.  From sibling rivalry to holiday gatherings, the show captures a real family in its true light.  The humor is relatively 'PG' and due to the almost non-existant bad language, Roseanne S1 can be viewed by the whole family.  While season 1 wasn't my favorite season, it definately got the show off to an awesome start.

I just knew she was destined to be on a ""Where Are They Now"" episode, look how wrong you can be. She gets her own show and it was the most annoying and just down right mean spirited show in television history.  All she did is bitch and moan about something and people including(I'm sorry to say)my wife loved it! See if this doesn't sound like a typical episode. She gets mad at Dan for not doing something and whines about it,then he does it and it's better than what she would have done and she gets even madder and whines even more. And here's another one, her kids(which I would've gave up for adoption by the way.)get mad and decide to be mouthy and disrespectful to both she and Dan. What's so great or funny about that? Nothing!

The studios forget that the fans have been watching this show for years. We've seen the original versions and can recite the script word for word. These awful, cut to shreds, versions of this incredible show should be recalled immediately and a proper release made. Many of the jokes/lines don't work on the DVD as the `set up' is missing. You can't simply hack away at a programme and expect the episode to have the same impact. When you cut lines you affect scenes further into the episode. Many wonderful comedy moments now just fall flat, as you haven't had the build up to that moment properly.

Anchor Bay should be ashamed of this item. I feel let down and, as a fan, cheated. I've given them my money but they won't see a single penny more until this fiasco has been sorted out. If you love this show and know it as well as most fans do then do not waste your cash on this inferior box set. It isn't worth spending your money on this much sought after release as it has been totally ruined.

All 23 episodes are missing at least 2 minutes of footage from the versions that originally aired on ABC.  How in the world can a studio feel that there is nothing wrong with using syndication prints of television shows to put on a DVD box set that consumers are paying good money for?  If we want to see the versions of these classic shows that have missing footage for more commercial time, we can catch them on umpteen independent satellite/cable stations!  We have a right to expect that something WE (as opposed to sponsors) are paying for will be the original, complete and uncut network versions!

With this set you get all 23 season one episodes, and many great extras. There are interviews with Roseanne and John Goodman, bloopers, season one highlights, a segment called Wisdom with the Domestic Goddess, and Roseanne even does introductions on a few of the episodes.

Roseanne is one of the most real shows in history, and everything that happened to the Connors over the years is very believable. The show centers on a family of working-class people in Illinois. The cast, including Roseanne, John Goodman, Laurie Metcalf, and Sara Gilbert, was amazing.

This set is a must-have item if you are a fan of the show, or a member of the wonderful cast. I am EXTREMELY happy that this show has finally gotten released on DVD, and will be in my collection forever.

I, for one, will not be buying the DVD version. Just yesterday, they started airing Roseanne on a Canadian channel called CMT. I watched it, it was the pilot episode for the series, and it was the original UNCUT version, not the syndicated episodes they used to air on TBS. Any Roseanne lovers who are able to get this channel, do yourself a favor and tape these episodes instead of springing the $30 for the DVD. This is the only way they will learn their lesson and hopefully not make the same mistake of putting the edited versions of episodes in later season releases.",1125878400,13,713,4.409090909090909
1592793,1,B00005JNF7,"This set could have easily made the Top 10 on the Amazon DVD sales chart, yet the highest I saw it climb to was #59. It looks like the powers that be at Carsey-Werner and Anchor Bay have shot themselves in the foot. Cutting corners to save time and money does NOT pay off in the long run, people!

The only reason I am giving this set 1 star is the for the bloopers, which were fun to watch. The interviews with Roseanne and John Goodman were nice too, but it would have been better to hear comments from the entire cast (ie. the fabulous Laurie Metcalf, and the kids).

This first season was never my favorite as Roseanne was often still in ""stand-up"" mode. She would deliver a punchline then sort of hold there for a second with a big grin on her face while staring at her fellow actors. Her acting style improved greatly over the next few seasons as the show really found its footing, and no doubt she was influenced greatly by the undeniable thespian talents of Goodman and Metcalf.

It is a disgrace that this set is plagued by its selection of syndication edits (even the opening theme is the shorter version; the original longer one had Dan eating the chip dip and kissing Roseanne, who wipes off her cheek with the back of her hand before letting go with her trademark cackle at the fade-out). Another give-away is the 1997 copyright at the end of the closing credits, which I recall from when the show began running on TBS in the fall of that year. True Roseanne fans can only hope that susbsequent seasons will indeed be composed of original network prints. Rumour has it that Carsey-Werner and Anchor Bay were disappointed with the sales of the Cosby Show's first season which suffered the same treatment and will indeed feature full-length uncut episodes from this point forward, so hopefully future releases of Roseanne will also be treated with the same loving care it deserves.

Another minor beef I have is that they used fourth season promo photos on the box cover and menus. I do wish that the people in charge of DVD art/graphics would do their research. Rosey's ever-changing look was another trademark of this show, and this season should have featured her 1988 look, with the long curly hair and sweatshirt with the sleeves pushed up. Sorry to nitpick, but I'm a stickler for details!

In conclusion, thanks to all the disgruntled consumers who voiced their dissatisfaction with this issue, we DID make a difference! Roseanne herself, who was always championing the underdog, would be proud!",1125878400,21,2513,4.650900900900901

Anchor Bay also released the series Titus on DVD, and it was completely unedited. What makes everyone think that these episodes for Roseanne are?  Looks to me like everyone's making a giant assumption, and you know what happens when you assume. You make an a$$ of U and ME.

The episodes themselves are as funny as I remember, with guest appearances by a freakishly young George Clooney, Ned Beatty (Homicide: Life on the Street) as Dan's father, and former Tennessee Senator Fred Dalton Thompson, now playing District Attorney Arthur Branch on ""Law and Order"".

The performances from Roseanne and John Goodman are so plain-spoken you can almost see your own parents talking this way, when they're in a good mood. The kids are so young here that they're kinda hard to recognize.  Take a look at the pilot episode, and you'll see it's a different kid playing D.J.  Why he was recast, I don't know.  Rounding out the cast was Laurie Metcalf as Roseanne's sister Jackie.  After nine years on the show, I wasn't sure Laurie would be able to break out of Jackie, but then she appeared in ""Scream 2"" and proved me wrong!

I'm pleased to add this DVD set to my collection, and don't intend to miss any of them! I'll be spending time watching a good show like Roseanne, instead of those trashy reality shows that are polluting the airways now.  Hopefully, you'll follow my example, and boycott Hollywood's idea of what's good now.

Roseanne gave us REAL people with REAL problems instead of too-cute and precocious kids, a mom vacuuming in pearls, and a father who never takes off his tie. We saw real issues presented with humor, and parents who did their best and never stopped loving their kids even when life got messy.  We could all relate. When ""Roseanne"" went off the air, its fans felt they'd lost a family member. Relive the memories, and share them with a new generation.

After all the times I've seen these shows I still find myself laughing and enjoying every minute. Also the picture is so clear and crisp it's much better than what you see on regular t.v.

1592875,5,B00005JNF7,"To those thinking Im not a real fan, think again.  I bought Season One, loved it, AND wrote to the proper people about the edited versions being released.  Now that Cosby Show seems to have a bright future, its most likely that Roseanne will too.  But, Cosby Show Season One probably won't see an unedited version...goes the same for Roseanne...so if you want that complete collection, you're gonna have to buy it anyways. Bottom line is this and Everyone should think about this.  If you are not in support of this DVD release, thats fine.  But, if DVD sales for this release are horrible because you refuse to support your beloved show, chances of getting what you really want are slim..future realeases of any kind are less likely to happen if the dollars are not there.  You can purchase it and still make your opinions known, because most likely they will not re-release this set.
 Now my review: I remember the premiere night of Roseanne.  It was the first of many many many Tuesday nights I spent watching one of the best shows on tv.  It was so much more real than any other show on at the time and the comedy was great.  Well, last night I watched the first episode for the first time in several years.  And I still love it as much as I did in its original broadcast.
  I say, who cares that the show is edited a few minutes.  This is classic tv at its best.  The bloopers and interviews are great and you won't be seeing those on Nick at Nite.  Yes, it would be preferred to have the original cuts .. but Im taking what I can get.  If everyone stands by this ""we're not buying edited versions' business, then you risk the chance of no future seasons coming out.  If a DVD set tanks, they're not gonna go forward with more. I, for one, hope every season comes out, cut or not.
  Voice your opinions with Anchor Bay, but don't refuse to buy this and miss out on one of the greatest shows out there.  Great sales and plenty of feedback, together, will hopefully be enough to get what everyone really wants.. but for now, Im happy to be owning Roseanne Season 1.",1125446400,12,2068,4.361256544502618

First off, who says they'll even release more if this set sells poorly? Second, WHY do they have edited episodes? What if they never release the full ones for some reason? No one knows exactly what's going on, it's all speculation at this point. Maybe everyone should email Anchor Bay Entertainment (google it) instead of just writing reviews on here. Somehow I doubt the execs are browsing Amazon to see what everyone thinks.

The reason they are using syndicated episodes is not only copyrights, but the fact that they needed to beable to synch in other languages with the music and sound effects for other countries. This is sad I realize, but we deserve much more, and companies who do this are just revolting.

The first season was the way Roaseanne was meant to be, just like her stand up routine, With that Whining voice and her big fat Butt! as the show went on, she lost that voice, started losing weight, started getting face lifts and married that Tom arnold guy and the show just went downhill from there.

1592915,2,B00005JNF7,"Ok, so I got this dvd set free from work today and here are a few thoughts.

Interview with roseanne - Thought it was pretty good, although it was kind of short.  I think it ran like 9 mins or so. She had some interesting things to say but you can tell the interview was chopped up and edited also. She noted that the girls bedroom was not built until after she quit the factory and that was went in place of the set. I don't really want to give anything away so I'll let you watch it for yourself.  I was surprised by how close she was with everyone... at least the cast. She was not a big fan of the production crew I guess. You can see it in the bloopers. She talked sweet to the children and then you can here the guy in the backround just being a complete jerk. She kind of snapped on him a couple times.

Interview with John Goodman - Ehh, it was ok. Again, they chopped it up and edited it. Why? Who knows. He had some cool things to say also.

Roseannes take on the domestic godess - Or whatever it is called. It was just clips from episodes, nothing special.

Bloopers -  These were just halarious. My favorite blooper was when the phone rang and Roseanne went to answer it. Darlene came running down the stairs and completly leveled roseanne. She took a spill and was crying she was laughing so hard. DJ seems like a nice kid. There are quit a few bloopers between Roseanne and him. You can tell she was almost a mother figure to him.  Watch the one when Darlene and Roseanne can't say their lines towards the end. Listen to the production guy. (not sure of his technical name) He get's pissed off and roseanne snaps on him. Good stuff.

The quality of the Episodes is pretty good. You can tell they attempted to restore it, but remember it was made in 1988. The sound just wasn't right coming from my tv, but I tossed it in my computers DVD and it sounded fine. Must just be my TV itself.

Ok, the reason I am giving it 2/5 stars is because of the edited episodes. Its just completly wrong to not release them in their full length versions. I give it two because I really liked the extras and am looking forward to the ones on season two.

I would not buy this DVD set in the end though. I had planned on ordering it until I found out they were edited and then changed my mind. Luckily I was given the set for free. I still say hold out, DO NOT buy this until carsey-warner and anchor bay get off their money hungry butts and release the full length episodes.",1125273600,19,2470,4.1572327044025155

I had to double check today because after looking at the store sale ads in the Sunday Newspaper, I saw no mention of this being available Tuesday.  Usually Circuit City or Kmart has the upcoming CD's and DVD in their circular.  I held off on pre-ordering from Amazon until I saw some of the competitors prices.  But after reading about the edited episodes, I find myself in a large group that will NOT be buying this DVD set.  Why would you edit material that you want to sell to individual citizens?  We are not networks that will air the program on TV?  If material is considered unsuitable, then include it anyway and put a label on it.  I was so looking forward to seeing the original cuts of the show just to see what has been edited off of the re-runs.  Now I find out that there is even more edited material.  I seriously hope this set gets re-released in original un-cut version (how about extra scenes).  If not buying this set will help to expedite that, then you can count me in.

Please: Don't get this set, even if you absolutely feel you have to. The studios expect us to pay, for a 15 year old TV show in a crappy format, twice as much as they charge for a brand new movie with a million extras. This has got to stop.

No way, am I paying for edited content, even though I think ""Roseanne"" remains one of TV's finest comedies, and one of the few that holds up under repeated viewings. Yes, the final season was dreadful--though the series finale episode was redeeming, if not spectacular--and there's no denying the content slipped from 1994 on (the horrible ""Gilligan's Island"" take-off and endless OJ references spring to mind), but, for me, ""Roseanne"" remains the ultimate ""comfort food"" TV, no weight-related pun intended. Even though I've seen the episodes so often I know many of the lines by heart, I still laugh every time I watch an old episode--which, thanks to plentiful reruns, is almost daily. There is no other show, ever, that I can say that about.

And, as soon as they release unedited versions of the episodes on DVD, I'll buy the complete set. Until then, I'll be content with TV replays.

UPDATE (2014): Many of the reviews, mine included, were made for the original 2005 DVD release of the Roseanne show (see:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Roseanne-Season-1/dp/B00005JNF7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Roseanne: Season 1</a>), where the season 1 DVD did feature edited episodes.

These episodes are identical to those being shown in syndication right now (in my area, Roseanne airs for at least six hours - 12 episodes - every single day) on various stations, so it was a huge waste for me to buy this set since I could have just recorded the seasons on my DVD recorder/Tivo.  And, I wouldn't have to wait years for them to get around to releasing them.

Carsey/Werner, the owners of the license this and the recently released and similarly CUT UP Cosby set, really need to wake up to what fans want.  We don't want the same episodes we've been watching on TV for the past decade or two, we want the original, uncut airings that we haven't seen since the episodes were first run.

When a show like Roseanne is on constantly on TV throughout the day, we need more than edited, identical to what we can see on TV now versions.

1593049,4,B00005JNF7,"Roseanne was, in it's prime, one of the best sitcoms ever made. In an era where Cosby ruled the airwaves, it was refreshing to watch a sitcom family that experienced the ups and downs of a REAL family, like ours. They had financial troubles. They fought - sometimes over trivial (but immediately recognizable to anyone with a family of their own) issues, sometimes about big things that threatened to tear them apart. These weren't always resolved within half an hour. The show tackled some heavy issues - domestic abuse, teenage pregnancy, mental illness, but didn't preach. They also covered the lighter side of family life, with episodes chronicling a day at the mall, or a teenaged daughter's first date. When it was good, Roseanne was very, very good. But when it was bad... Unfortunately, like many high rated television series, Roseanne did wear out it's welcome. The entire last season (as well as a fair amount of the other later seasons) was atrocious. The final episode, where we learn that the entire show's run was actually a novel written by Roseanne Connor about her family (with much creative license), was lame. The show really should have bowed out gracefully while on top of it's game several years earlier. The final years get zero stars from me, however, the earlier ones get five. It probably averages out to more like three stars, but I enjoyed the show too much overall to rate it lower than four.",1124841600,3,1421,4.8040816326530615

Hopefully after an uproar from DVD collectors, studios who are putting out shoddy sets featuring episodes shorn of 3-4 minutes will realize that we're COLLECTORS. If we wanted to watch the syndicated, chopped-up versions, we can watch them on regular TV. We buy these sets to keep the pristine versions and for the extras. Considering that Roseanne was very vocal about wanting her series to come out on DVD and that she'd be willing to do commentaries to every episode, its shocking that there are NO COMMENTARIES and that the episodes are edited. Fans should take a stand and just wait. If we protest, the second and third season may come out UNCUT and the first season reissued will full-episodes. (Hey, look at how CBS tries to gouge I LOVE LUCY fans with a huge season one box set for $100 and later reissued it at less than half that price and in a managable box set.)

I cannot understand charging upwards of thirty or forty dollars for what are NOT the complete episodes. If you watch the DVDs of ""M*A*S*H"" and ""Friends"" and then watch the same shows on TBS and Hallmark, there's quite a bit missing in those syndicated airings....some of it in the case of those ""M*A*S*H"" shows is quite noticeable. I agree with the folks who've gone ahead and recorded the syndicated shows from Nick at Nite or wherever. The fans of ""Roseanne"" deserve to have the DVDs of the complete original airings of the show they made such a huge hit, and without the annoying banners (very distracting on all those channels) and logos in the corner through the entire shows. I loved this show...but unless Carsey-Werner allows the re-release of the DVDs with truly complete episodes, I've got the shows complete and uncut on VHS tapes from beginning to end.

That's the power of such companies...stopping at nothing to make money. For TV shows, their best customers are the younger folks (teenagers or younger) who have never seen the show in its original run. They don't have a clue about the 2-3 minutes of missing footage that they're missing out on in syndication. Often times, those 2-3 minutes are just as funny, if not funnier than the 21-22 minutes that you DO see. The whole point about buying TV shows on DVD is to have the episodes of shows as they were meant to be seen...uncut and unedited. Why else would we, the customers, fork out our hard-earned money for some of our favorite TV shows? If all DVDs were edited, we'd be better off watching them on syndication.

Of course, there are some cases where a company has no other choice but to release something edited...whether it be a music change, or the original episode being damaged/lost.

1593172,1,B00005JNF7,"First and foremost, I have to say that 'Roseanne' ranks as one of my all-time favorite sitcoms.  It's one of the few shows I never EVER get tired of.  Dating back to 1987 when it first aired, right through syndication, I still watch it constantly.

That being said, I was literally ecstatic when I heard this great show was coming to DVD.  I swore, I'd be amongst the first to purchase it upon release.

This was until I found out that this set has suffered the same fate as other TV/DVD releases (most notably 'ALF').  Carsey-Werner has taken it upon themselves to give us SYNDICATED EPISODES.  In other words, a number of minutes have been shaved off of EACH and EVERY episode contained within this set.

Now we're not talking about useless footage.  This is a sitcom, and as such, every minute is intricate to each storyline.  We're not losing scenes such as Darlene being lost in thought, or Dan making his way from the living room to the bedroom.  Sitcoms are fast-paced, and as many will tell you, each minute DOES count.

So, to the naysayers who claim that this shouldn't be an issue, let me ask you this?  Would you purchase a book missing 1/10 of the pages?  Would you accept a paycheck missing 1/10 of your earnings?  If your answer is NO, then why on earth should we accept this box set when each episode is missing 1/10 of the footage?

For those who love this show, I emplor you.  Don't succumb to this mediocre product.  By purchasing this, you're telling these companies that it's ok to release products containing missing footage.  And by doing that, they'll be under the impression that it's ok to do it with future seasons.......and ultimately, future shows.  I for one don't want to see that happen.

Now why would I want to BUY something that was designed for paid advertising? If they were to give me the DVD's for free, I'd be fine with that, but they aren't. When we are paying for these sets, it is extremely insulting to offer us a product that (by it's very nature) was designed to make the TV stations more money.

1593251,1,B00005JNF7,"I can't explain the anger and frustration I'm feeling at this moment.  I have waited literally YEARS to get ""Roseanne"" on DVD, yes, YEARS.  I know people can exaggerate and say stuff like that, but for me, it's true.  Waiting for the greatest show of all time to come to DVD has been one of the most frustrating experiences of my life.  I went through a phase thinking maybe it would never happen, and I'd have to settle for my crappy edited syndication versions for the rest of my life.  That made me sad.

Then, one day, I read that the show would be coming to DVD, and soon!  I was so excited, I almost cried out in joy, and then I ran upstairs and marked on my calendar, ""August 30th:  The fateful day when ""Roseanne"" finally comes to DVD!""  And that's exactly what I wrote.  I was so excited.  I just wanted to, as Bev says, ""dance a jig of glee.""  I couldn't possibly wait for the show to finally arrive.

Now, let me take a moment to explain why I was so excited about this coming to DVD.  The versions we've all been watching in syndication for the last several years are heavily edited from 2-3 minutes so they can add more commericals.  This is one of the main reasons why TV shows on DVD have become so popular.  We can finally watch them uncut, as they were seen when originally aired!  Well, just today, in fact, I was looking through this page again, and was happy to see one of those ""officail"" Amazon.com reviews had been posted at the beginning of the page.  Of course, it talks about how great and inspirational and great (did I already say great?) this show was, but then, in the very last sentence, I felt like I was hit in the gut with a cannon, for this is what I saw:

""Caveat: the set uses the episodes as they were shortened for syndication, not the originally broadcast versions that were 2-3 minutes longer.""

And I couldn't possibly believe it!  How can this really be happening?  I wondered to myself.  What kind of horrible, horrible DVD company would ever treat its fans like this?  If I wanted to watch the stupid edited syndication versions, I'd tape them off of TV!  The reason I never did this is because I didn't want those versions!  I wanted the REAL ""Roseanne!""  And guess what, that's not what's going to be in this DVD set!  So, after my years of waiting, it looks like I'll just have to continue to wait, because this is so NOT the product I was waiting for.  I am confident that if the company realizes that this is not what the fans want, they'll rectify their horrible mistake, but until then, we'll just have to wait, and how many more years will we have to wait?  I am so disgusted!

1593253,1,B00005JNF7,"Anyone who thinks the episodes on this DVD set are uncut obviously did not read the Amazon.com review above. Let me quote the last line for you, ""Caveat: the set uses the episodes as they were shortened for syndication, not the originally broadcast versions that were 2-3 minutes longer."" Don't believe me? Scroll your browser page up and read it for yourself.

Anyone who knows about television sitcoms knows that there are 2 versions of every episode. The original network version (runs about 23 to 24 minutes for Roseanne) and the one shortened for syndication (runs about 21 to 22 minutes for Roseanne). The parts that are missing on these syndicated episodes have absolutely nothing to do with commercials. Any novice TV show fan can tell you that. If the episodes for Roseanne were completely unedited on this set, they would run around 23 or 24 minutes long (and I'm not including commercials - I'm talking actual footage). Anchor Bay has confirmed that indeed they used the cut versions for this DVD set that run an average of 21 minutes long each. That means every episode is missing 2-3 mintues of actual footage - yes, story lines & jokes, not commercials. I repeat, an episode being cut or uncut has NOTHING to do with commercials.

Let me give you an example. The 1st and 2nd seasons of Home Improvement have currently been released UNCUT on DVD. If you were to view a particular episode on those DVD sets and compare it to the version you'd see on television, you would notice that several scenes have been shortened or cut on tv. That's because episodes of any show shown in reruns on television are the cut versions (syndicated). For this 1st season DVD release of Roseanne, you would notice no difference between the episodes on this DVD set and the ones you'd see on television today because both are cut for syndication. For Home Improvement DVDs, there is a difference.

Secondly, I don't think we have to resort to name calling here. We are just trying to inform the public before they buy this DVD set that the episodes on it are cut. For some people, this is a negative thing and would result in a non-sale. This is what a review is for, to state your opinion to others. You too are free to state your opinion. However, if you want to lower yourself down to name calling, there are forums on the net for that.

Lastly, please do not review this DVD selection unless you know what you're talking about. The episodes on this release ARE CUT and it has been confirmed by Anchor Bay themseleves and countless others who saw the original network versions in 1988 or have them on tape (taped from 1988 ABC airings). The only way you could have the original network versions on tape is if you taped them back in 1988 on ABC because they have not been shown since. Episodes taped off of Nick-at-Night, TBS or any other channel other than ABC during 1988 ARE CUT.

Hope this helps settle the discussion over whether these episodes are cut or not.

So, why do I prefer unedited episodes over edited ones?

Edited episodes are NOT cool! Very disrespectul to the fans that made this great show so popular to being with. Recently I purchased the 2nd season of Home Improvement on dvd featuring fully uncut episodes. Now, I had watched every episode of Home Improvement countless times in syndication before buying the 2nd season dvd set. So, it was such a treat to see scenes I had never saw before. One particular scene had me rolling on the floor laughing so hard. Other shows on dvd like Cheers and I Love Lucy all feature uncut episodes as they were originally broadcasted. Roseanne deserves this same respect. As pointed out by another fan on another forum: this dvd set is missing about 2 minutes of footage per episode. This is 2 minutes x 23 episodes for a total of about 2 episodes worth of missing footage this season. If this continues, that's 2 episodes worth of missing footage x 9 seasons for a total of about 18 episodes worth of footage we'll never see. That's almost an entire season missing, which is significant. Let Anchor Bay & Carsey-Werner know you want uncut episodes and maybe future seasons of Roseanne will be uncut.

Reviews condemning this set, though, do come from verified sources that confirm that this set does use syndication versions of Roseanne, which do cut out a couple of minutes per episode.  Similar complaints can be found with the recent set for The Cosby Show.  Both shows have been put out in this manner because of Carsey-Werner, not Anchor Bay or Urbanworks Entertainment.  The title is in particular misleading for this set because it is titled ""Roseanne: The Complete First Season"" when it is in fact not the complete first season.  As much as I want this set, I have to pass because it is simply not what it advertises itself as.

On a side note, to those who insist on criticizing us who dislike the syndication versions of Roseanne for DVD, keep in mind that A) some of the people you are questioning are TV DVD enthusiasts, such as myself, who know what we are talking about; B) contact Anchor Bay yourself for proof if you don't believe us; C) while syndication cuts are a growing concern for the TV DVD market, it is not common.

I found the Season One Set of Roseanne at a local Used CD/DVD shop and I guess it was a preview set but anyhow mint condition and I have been dying to see this show on DVD forever. After watching it etc I noticed seems they are the cut shorter syndicated episodes. It includes the newer opening title sequences stating Roseanne Arnold and NOT Barr which it was at the time and the last closing title card even indicates Carsey Werner - 1997 - copyright for syndication. This is really tremendous disappointment and I have watched the first two episodes and I don't feel like watching any more of them at all. I think that it is very unfair that a show that had really great ratings and a strong following up until the last few years got such vulgar treatment. I realize it may not be fully in Anchor Bay Entertainments hands and may be in the production companies hands but I have been doing a lot of online searching w/ Roseanne fans and they all seem to be really angry and have said they are NOT buying the DVD set. I was wondering why the set seemed to be cased in such a typical fashion as opposed to your release for Third Rock on the Sun which I thought was more lavish.

The sells are gonna not be so great on August 30th for this release and could in fact hurt as more Seasons are being released. Sales will falter and go downhill I think everyone needs to ask themselves how hard REALLY HOW HARD would it have been to get the original prints for these episodes? Was it too hard to warrant actual financial losses from poor sales?

Who ever made these decisions I would again say not so much Anchor Bay Entertainment but the daft heads at Carsey Werner should in fact lose their jobs for these errors not only on Roseanne but also for the Cosby Show. Some may think this is a bit much but it is selling an incomplete product especially when the box art reads the ""COMPLETE"" first season this is in fact a LIE and is FALSE Advertising. It is taking money from others from a job done poorly. I think the transfers on the episides looked fine but as I watched Only Two episodes I was more angry of what I was missing than trying to really wnjoy the show. I didn't want to watch anymore after that.

I think everyone involved in this release would and if NOT should agree for the sake of their revenue make some changes to get the sales for this release back up.

1593297,5,B00005JNF7,"Roseanne is an awesome show and I for one intend to still purchase these DVDs because:

a)We do not know for sure that they will be the ""edited"" versions.  Just because some idiots are claiming that they e-mailed Anchor Bay and got a response doesn't mean it's true.  Production companies rarely reply to public e-mails, so I find this very hard to believe.  I also took some time to check both Anchor Bay and Casey-Werner's websites and in their descriptions of the DVDs there is nothing about them being the syndicated versions.

b)  Even if they ARE the edited versions, they don't edit anything important from the shows!  They edit music leading into a scene and little miniscule bits of non-dialogue at the beginning of scenes.  Dialogue is NOT cut and the storyline is unaffected!  They even leave in the jokes at the end after the credits roll (speaking of which, some of what is edited is also just credits).  My point being is, you don't notice the edits at ALL.

c)  Also IF they are edited versions, there is NOTHING we can do about it--absolutely NOTHING.  They will not redo the DVDs just because a few people cancelled their pre-orders!!  The only thing you're doing by not buying the DVDs is depriving yourself of having one of the greatest TV shows ever on DVD!!  Plus you'll miss all the cool extras!!

Listen, I wasn't happy when they released ""Roswell"" on DVD and changed the music, but I'm still going to buy the DVDs, because they're the only ones they'll release and I love the show and want to have it on DVD.

We as consumers can whine all we want, but some things will never change!!  :)  That's just my opinion on the subject!!  I say if you liked the show, buy the DVDs.

Now they say several complaints?? If that is true (not likely- i am sure there were more then that!!)- then we need to get on Carsey Werners tail on this one!!!!!!!!!!!  Do you realize if they don't hear us- every season will be edited!!! RIDICULOUS! It is in the contract!!  Do you guys recall this:

Anchor Bay Entertainment fit that need all the way.""

Robert Dubelko needs a slap- so much for the ""most cherished programs""  Call him up people- this needs to stop!

I just got the horrible news ! This set is going to be the edited/syndicated episodes!! We know Roseanne herself was very anxious to have her show released on DVD, and we know she likely would not approve of this set- but this is not in her control.  I LOVED this show from the start and it brings back great memories and I was completely thrilled to know the DVD set was coming out.  I will NOT be buying this now.  Why? These same episodes cut to shreds are on TV.  2-3 minutes per episode DOES add up- and it DOES effect the episodes. Some may not think so but think about a 26 minute show running 23 minutes after the cuts! They don't cut the credits! So you ARE losing actual footage. Example- LOOK AT THE I LOVE LUCY DVD'S WHERE PARAMOUNT ACTUALLY REINSERTED LOST FOOTAGE AFTER IT WAS CUT...SO YES THIS MAKES A DIFFERENCE.  Technically this is NOT the COMPLETE FIRST SEASON- Rather then false advertising it should be noted as the First Season. The packaging should also reflect these are SYNDICATED versions.  Look what happened to all the COSBY fans that are in an uproar now.  I am really pissed about this....There will be fans who buy this set- and others to follow- but what happens say in a year- if they re-release the UNCUT versions! Is it all a money thing? Why cant they get the original prints? They were able to dig up BLOOPERS for crying out loud- they cant get the original episodes??? Carsey Werner need to get the act together- this is NO way to TREAT some GREAT TV SHOW!! SHAME ON THEM.  We need to contact Carsey Werner- this should be fixed.  Again, Roseanne was from the 80's..you cant tell me Carsey Werner could not supply the unedited prints- I Love Lucy was from the 50's COMPLETELY restored with the lost footage edited back in!!  Someone made a great point - so to the reviewers who think we are ""whining""- would you buy say the syndicated versions of ""The Wizard of Oz"" , ""Gone With the Wind"" - think about that..............

For once a tv show actually portrayed what it was truly like in a home behind closed doors. Roseanne Barr did a phenominal job as ""Roseanne Connor"". And John Goodman and Sara Gilbert also did an awesome job as Dan and Darlene. This showmade normally very sad things very funny. Eveerything my family has went through they went through(except the whole lotto thing). Even though the shows last season wasn't as spectacular as the other seasons it was still funny. They still crossed borders that no one had ever dared to cross. I will never forget watching the episode where Dan is in the hospital and Roseanne is in the hallway. She talks to God and says that she cant go on without him. Its true there was not only a bond between her and Goodman but also a bond between her and the world. The last episode was the hardest to watch. I cried. I have never cried during anything before, but somehow this last episode made me cry. It also made me realize something.

1593304,5,B00005JNF7,"Cosby Show producers Tom Werner and Marcy Carsey took a second responsibility in 1988 with this ABC sitcom,premiering on October 18 that year. The 1988-89 television season began late due to a writers' strike just like it delayed the 1981-82 season for many shows. With The Cosby Show still #1 in the Nielsen ratings,Werner and Carsey ended up with another immediate hit(TCS was just that when it premiered on NBC in 1984). There's nothing like a stand-up comic with a sitcom of his/her own. Roseanne Barr is Roseanne Conner,a Lanford,Illinois woman whose husband Dan(John Goodman) owns and operates Lanford Cycles,which he would shut down later in the series. Roseanne's sister Jackie Harris(Laurie Metcalf) is an aspiring law enforcement officer(she'd join the police force later in the series). The Conners' children are Becky(Lecy Goranson),Darlene(Sara Gilbert,Melissa's sister) and Dan Jr. aka D.J.(Michael Fishman). Becky is age 15 or 16,Darlene is 12 or 13 and D.J. is 6 or 7. Another actor played D.J. in the pilot episode(I don't remember his name). At one point in the series,Goranson left and Sarah Chalke resumed Goranson's character. Then Chalke would leave and Goranson would return. In the opening montage,the Conners and Jackie are at the dinner table about to dig into Chinese food. At the end,we hear Roseanne maniacally laughing(in future openings there'd be a new versions of the theme song,and of course,a new version of Roseanne's laughing).",1121212800,2,1464,5.28755364806867

1593358,5,B00005JNF7,"`Roseanne' was a groundbreaking show on so many levels that this DVD release is practically mandated. Based on the stand-up-comedy routine of Roseanne (then Barr) it critiqued the `domestic goddess' role that women were supposed to fit themselves into. Instead, Barr was a self-described `domestic goddess from hell'.

 In the glam 1980s, this show dared to present a working class family whose female lead was loud-mouthed, and overweight. Then, audiences were supposed to identify with the lead character, her family and the struggles they went through. We were intentionally supposed to like Roseanne exactly for who she was---rather than hoping she would change or feeling sorry for her family.

In doing so, it upped the emotional ante from shows like All in the Family, Maude, and Good Times. Those series also had purported to show `tough lives' through the sitcom but the mothers on them were slim or somehow remained sweet-natured even after everything they went through. `Roseanne's' genius lies in that it made no such trade-offs. Roseanne is liberated because she has so many strikes against her.

Both Roseanne Connor and husband Dan (John Goodman) find themselves frequently out of work. Although they love their family very much, they also don't hesitate to publicly vent steam when the kids drive them crazy during the 23-episode (1988-1988) season. The kids frequently have minds of their own, thus being a far cry from other television children who never misbehave badly.

Favorite episodes include ""The memory game"" because Roseanne finds out that Dan had something with her high school nemesis, subsequently dredging up old feelings and creating tension in the Connor household. I also like ""The slice of life"" Darlene's emergency appendectomy concerns Roseanne who had yelled at her daughter earlier, affirming that family comes first. ""Death and stuff"" has the Connors in a brief panic because a door-to-door salesman has keeled over in their kitchen; wishing these people were dead is different than actually having to deal with it. Finally, ""Dear mom and dad"" is memorable because Roseanne's parents drive her family up the wall when they come over for a visit.

Important episodes are ""Workin Overtime"" because Roseanne escapes her hectic life to muse in a dinner, and ""Let's call it quits"" because a tough new factory supervisor grates on her nerves. In later seasons, Roseanne leaves the plant to instead work at a dinner.

In the first episode (""Life and stuff"") Sal Barrone was cast as David Jacob ""DJ"", the Connor's son. Apparently he and Sara Gilbert (Darlene) did not get along. He was replaced in subsequent episodes with Michael Fishman.

Extras in this DVD release include Bloopers, Roseanne on Roseanne: a new candid interview, Season One highlights, Wisdom from the domestic goddess, Interview: John Goodman takes a look back. This with the uncut/non-syndicated episodes should satisfy the most ardent `Roseanne' fan.

This season perfectly captures the magic of this series and should be purchased by people appreciating good sitcoms.",1120348800,12,3072,5.240325865580448

I WAS SO HAPPY THINKING THAT THIS GREAT SHOW WAS AT LAST GOING TO BE REVIVED BY DVD, BUT NOW I SEE THAT THIS BOX SET IS ABOUT AS GOOD AS TAPING THE RERUNS OFF OF NICK AT NITE. DO NOT BUY THIS SET. [...]

The following review was written in May, before I knew that these discs contained cut episodes. The review praises the show, not the crappy DVDs Anchor bay has put out.

So at long last one of the greatest (and certainly the most down to earth) sitcoms of all time finds a new home on the keepsake format known as DVD. A format which is popular with rerun addicts because the episodes are as fresh as the day they aired, free of syndication editing for time, and, better still, they are now free of commercials, particularly those horrible promos they now run during the course of the shows themselves. ROSEANNE comes from a better time when networks did not have the gaul to soil a show with pop-ups that sometimes take up half the screen and even have (shudder) sound effects. But then, ROSEANNE's time was a good old time anyway, the late eighties running through to the late nineties.

After making a name for herself as a standup comedian, ROSEANNE finally got her own television show and got to do it her way. The series was centered on a working class mother and her family and gave most viewers a warm feeling of being right at home themselves with the shows original mix of real-life drama and sarcastic quips.

The true crowning achievement of the show was it's ability to portray female characters as leads in a comedy and yet make them diversely different. Roseanne herself is a loud, bossy, control-freak with a heart of gold. Her sister Jackie (played with brilliance by Laurie Metcalf) is a neurotic, wishy-washy woman who can't keep a relationship or a job for long. Roseanne's daughters, Becky and Darlene, are total opposites and watching them go through puberty, marriage and life in general throughout the course of the show helped shaped them into important, well-developed characters. The show managed to have four female leads without being a hen-fest. Part of that can be attributed to the testosterone put on screen by the character Dan, Roseanne's husband and real man's man(played with equal brilliance by John Goodman). But more so, the show's success can be attributed to the fact that all the female leads are not banal, cookie cutter clichs. Roseanne, in particular, broke the mold of pleasant female leads. She was likable, but not always pleasant. Her bitterness is what made her so funny, but her inner sweetness is what made her such a lovable Mom figure.

Smart writing, rich character development, realistic plots, sometimes deep drama, and all around laughs carried the series for years until the last season or so fell apart in a zany mess. Once the family won the lotto it was all over. The show totally lost it's way and disintegrated in a horrible bastardization which mocked what had made it so great for all those years. But many years of greatness makes up for a sour ending, and the release of season one is more than welcome by legions of fans.

Like most shows, the First Season of ROSEANNE is not the best. The characters had not grown into themselves yet  (DJ is even replaced). Roseanne and Jackie work in a factory and the episodes, while good, are more about getting the feel of the environment as a whole rather than getting deep into each individual part of the whole. But the first season is nonetheless hilarious and is a milestone in situation comedy and in the construction of female roles which differ from the  dull mainstream of ""the sex interest"", ""the sweet little girl"" or ""the wise old granny"".

After a few seasons the show really came into it's own. Roseanne starts to job-hop, Dan and Darlene's bond starts to struggle because she is becoming a woman, the girls enter their teens and boys come into the picture (including the characters of Mark and his brother David, which become important male characters on the show that will stay until the series ends), Jackie becomes more neurotic and fickle which is sometimes hysterically funny and is at other times profoundly moving in it's realism, and Roseanne's shrew of a mother enters the picture, adding delightful insanity.

It's a shame that this show died out the way it did. We could have grown old together with The Conner Family, or at least could have had a more realistic goodbye. A reunion show would be nice if they just ignored the plot which unfolded post-lotto. Unfortunately though, the actor Glen Quinn who played Mark died a few years back, which would make a reunion show even more complicated. John Goodman continues to make great film appearances (particularly in THE BIG LEBOWSKI, his best work), but the rest of the cast sort of vanished into obscure films and television appearances, including Roseanne herself. Her wild personal life aside, the woman is funny, and it is baffling that she could make such big mistakes after this show ended. First she did her talk show, which, to no one's surprise, bombed. Then, for about two episodes, she had that obnoxious reality show which revolved around her real family which were nowhere near as likable as the fictional Conners.

ROSEANNE, like the roaring 90's themselves, are behind us now. But the memory of them both linger, and watching Roseanne is kind of like doing the time warp. You not only enjoy the show all over again, but you feel transported back in time, just like you would watching In LIVING COLOR or MARRIED WITH CHILDREN. Those shows have been on DVD for a while now, and rightly so. But ROSEANNE has been put off for far too long. I'm glad to see this original, groundbreaking series hit store shelves, out of the vaults and back into our hearts.

She's certainly suffered a quiver full of slings and arrows of outrageous fortune for being a tough woman in a male dominated industry. Thank God she didn't let 'em squash her.

The Roseanne show is a watermark in television because it dares portray women's lives more realistically. There's a lot of humor, but there's also a lot of misery, confusion, love, fear, misunderstanding, loyalty and guts all mixed together in this panoply of a sitcom. It isn't a show about nothing; it's about real people with real problems, a family, struggling to stay afloat in our treacherous often precarious society. What makes the show even greater is that the central character is a smart-ass, strong, loving, savvy woman who's a mother, wife, sister, daughter, friend and individual who remarkably remains true to herself, not sacrificing anymore than she is willing to sacrifice. She remains true to herself, something women in American society often find difficult to do. Bring it on! We love Roseanne!",1111968000,8,1261,5.033492822966507

How packed?

Is Anchor Bay going to hold her to it? We hope so!

Anchor Bay Entertainment fit that need all the way."" Here's more from the press release, about the show itself:

  Roseanne debuted in 1988 and is one of the most successful and beloved series of all time, remaining on network television for nine years. The multiple award-winning series starred comedian Roseanne as Roseanne Conner, John Goodman (""The Babe,"" ""The Big Lebowski"") as her husband Dan and Laurie Metcalf as her sister Jackie. Each week focused on the struggles of a working class family facing everyday problems: money, children, marriage and of course, in-laws. Roseanne was nominated four times for an Emmy Award and five times for a Golden Globe. She won both awards in 1993. The series had a total of twenty-five Emmy nominations and four wins as well as three Golden Globes, four American Comedy Awards and a Peabody.

(jakie getting abused by fisher, roseannes mother being gay, david moving to chicago with darlean, becky moving into a trailer house, dans mother going insane etc) but no matter how bad situations got Rossane would end these problems with a smile or at least resolve the situation

 Though the plot of Roeannes show is simple to say that things never got complicated would be a lie. Like when dan leaves Roseanne for a time is a good example of a complex time in the show, but the saddest, darkest, and worst times in the roseanne show where twards the middle to the end of the series. One thing I absoloutley hattttttttttttttte about the show is the finaley  holy crap that was the worst final episode of a tv show ever, it ruined the characters we grew to know and love and in my oppion pushed the message of the roseanne show way over board.

 The final episode is my only problem with the series, and i dnt care how many channels roseannes show is on or how many times a day the channel plays the show it is time for this frigan amazing show to come to dvd. Hell if they can put the ellen show and giligans islad on dvd then they can put roseannes",1106524800,3,2191,4.342298288508557

1593521,5,B00005JNF7,"I rarely watch the telly, but this is one show I used to watch on a regular basis.  It's one of the most realistic, honest, funniest, yet touching shows ever to grace the small screen.  Roseanne is loveable with her funny little one-liners; Dan's a realistic husband; Jackie's the loving, loyal, often bumbling, yet loveable kind sister and aunt.  Roseanne, John Goodman as Dan and Laurie Metcalf as Jackie really carried the show thru all nine seasons.  The part in the ninth season of Dan straying from the marriage was a bit out of character since all throughout the series Roseanne and Dan have a strong, stable marriage.

Although the show is hilarious and witty, there are nice poignant moments added here and there...I think the one episode I will never forget is when poor Jackie is beaten by Fisher and with Roseanne's help breaks up with that creep.  I loved how Roseanne really told Fisher off!  I also won't forget the touching and rather teary episode where Roseanne sees Jackie off to the police academy and they both cry together before Jackie leaves.

I like the bond that Jackie and Roseanne share throughout the series and how they stick by each other thru thick and thin.  Roseanne stands by Jackie thru her boyfriend troubles and when Jackie has trouble standing up to her parents while Jackie stands by Roseanne whenever Roseanne or Dan or both of them are unemployed and whenever the kids get to be a handful.  Jackie is also a very loving aunt, the aunt every kid should have.

I do wish that Darlene and Becky hadn't gotten married so soon; I'm glad that later Becky does go back to school since she is very intelligent; I suspect she and Mark aren't exactly compatable.  They actually did a good job with the Becky actress replacement; Sarah Chalke does look very much like Lecy Goranson (who had to leave for college).  Very few shows manage to pull it off so well.

I'm sooo glad Laurie won those three Emmys; way to go, Laurie!  Laurie, I'd say was the best actor and that's a tough choice since all of the main actors are excellent.",1102377600,3,2061,4.608219178082192

There are multiple shows that are still showing on TV that are releasing seasons. I could understand if it had just ended, and there was a thought to wait and let the desire grow, but c'mon! It's been over a decade now! I used to watch the show on Nick-at-Night, but no longer can afford satellite. Why has this new medium of releasing episodes of our favorite show from yester-year become so elitist? Please give us what we want. It's not like there would be a lack of interest.

I don't want Sex in the City. For that matter I don't want any farce of real life with model figured women showing us how tragic their lives are while shopping with endless credit and having to stave off men. I want Roseanne! It's the closest sitcom on television to resemble most of our realities.
