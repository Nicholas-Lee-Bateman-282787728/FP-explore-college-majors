3666277,1,B001KKU9C8,"This series puts the world of eco terrorism right into your living room.
You can watch as Paul Watson directs his ""crew"" to attack whaling vessels conducting legal lethal research withing the Inernational Whaling Commision guidelines. The will throw butric acid (they try to claim it is only rotten butter but one visit to the SSCS forums and you will see they even call it by it's real name there) and methyl cellulose that when mixed with water make the surfaces of the ship slippery and dangerous to the Japanese crew who are only employees of a company doing a job trying to support their families.
You will also see PW direct 2 crew members to board a whaling ship only to then claim they are being held hostage after the Steve Irwin abandons them on the ship. Later they were returned without incident thanks to the help of the austrailian coast guard.
Also PW will claim to have been shot and then produce a questionable lead slug that looks more like an old musketball than a bullet from a modern high power rifle.
When I first saw the advertisement for this series I thought this would help get the message that lethal research whaling is not needed. Now that i have watched this series I still believe that, but now I see the dangers of leting an egomaniac Like PW run roughshod in international waters attacking innocent people working well within the law and IWC charter guidelines.",1232668800,11,1394,4.625
3666278,5,B001KKU9C8,"""Whale Wars"" is about a new generation of committed people who reject the destructive concept of only profit orientated and human centred thinking and acting.

Anyone who has seen a whale struggle for his life and has heard his screams of agony after being shot by a whaler's harpoon, being forced to drown in his own blood, and still calls people who try to prevent this inhumane slaughter extremists and terrorists, lacks two significant human traits: rational thought and, more importantly, empathy.

""Whale Wars"" is not a documentary about whether it's legal or illegal to kill whales.  It's about the fact that the intentional, profits motivated killing of innocent life can never be morally justified and will no longer be accepted. The late German poet and writer Manfed Kyber put it that way: ""Never can a true culture be pursued by human beings who see in animals only objects of exploitation, who slaughter them, who eat them or sudue them in any other way to their self-interest in the lowest sense."" ""Only small souls display the arrogance of their supposed superiority over animals."" This is what some reviewers here are incapable of understanding, because their thinking obviously centres around profits and anthropocentric arrogance solely.

The anti-whaling activists shown on ""Whale Wars"" are part of a new generation of people who care, who act, and who oppose the morally low self-interest of their own species. Certainly, they are neither perfect nor superior human beings, which can be seen in the documentary, but they do try to make a change on behalf of innocent life while risking their own. Therefore, I strongly recommend this DVD-set.",1232668800,13,1662,5.076923076923077
3666279,4,B001KKU9C8,"Whale Wars tells of the controversial 'War' going on between the Sea Shepherd and Japan over what constitutes legal whaling. Animal Planet has made no secret that they did not attempt to document this issue from the Japanese side, simply because they thought they would not even been granted the access. They decided to document the issue from Sea Shepard's point of view and in doing so show the passion, dedication and what the crew go through to stop the Japanese from killing these whales in the name of research.

The show starts off with the alleged shooting of Captain Paul Watson of the Sea Shepherd (a blatant move to get the viewer to watch what happens next). This opening scene is shown in chaos and confusion on purpose, frankly no one really knows if Paul Watson was actually shot by the Japanese. Even though Animal Planet could have easily slanted this event to make the Japanese look like killers, they did not. In the last episode the tell the story exactly as they saw and in my opinion were very fair to both sides. They show the events that led up to the 'shot' and what happened afterward. Though the Japanese were not directly interviewed on the show, the narrator did tell the audience that Japan released a statement stating they did not have a rifle on board their ship or shoot at anyone. This is confirmed by the crew of the Sea Shepard as no one saw a Japanese crew member with a rifle.

This is not the only instance that the producers stayed very neutral even though they documenting this from the Sea Shepherd's ship the 'Steve Irwin'. They show how core crew members are trying to show volunteers who have never worked on a ship the ins and outs of navigating through some of the most dangerous waters in the world. The first time they launch the zodiac, they flip it and if not for the specialized suits they were in case of emergency, they all would have died due to hypothermia. In the process they damage their helicopter. Later, when they dock for repairs, they change out some of the crew members and the new group fumble their way again with trying to launch the zodiac that it results in a lost 'mission'.

For those that claim Animal Planet did not tell the viewers what the law is and how Japan is following the law as it it is currently constituted are 100% incorrect. They do. In fact through out the entire season they remind the viewers what the law is and that Japan is only killing whales within the established quota for research. They tell the viewers that all the meat must not be wasted or discarded. Admittedly, not as much time is spent on this subject as there could have been. Its not as sexy as showing people illegally boarding ships or hard hitting as showing the Japanese dragging dead minke whales into the 'Mother Ship'. I would have liked to have seen interviews with Japanese citizens describing their thoughts on what their government is doing. Whether or not they care, who is eating the meat and why. It would have given them more credibility as a third party observer.

The Sea Shepherd clearly are not saints and their tactics should be questioned. The Japanese are clearly not saints and their research practices should be questioned. Animal Planet clearly is not a saint and this show as a documentary should be questioned. The one thing you can not question after watching it, whether or not you agree with the Sea Shepherd methods, what the Japanese are doing is wrong. The Sea Shepherd have a direct impact on the amount of whales that are lost to 'Research' and the governments from around the world should be doing more to stop Japan so that the Sea Shepherd are not taking the law into their own hands.",1232496000,13,3680,4.562783661119516
3666280,1,B001KKU9C8,"The Animal Planet series is not on rerun, been pulled from cable tv, and now on video for you to waste money on.  If you enjoy being lied to by a bunch of extremists who justify crimes in the name of the environment, then this DVD is for you.
It is a one sided ""war"" seen from the unrealistic view of an extremist environmental / animal rights group.  The DVD is about Sea Shepherd's follies on board their ship, their illegal tactics and rationalization to use them, and the spinning and twisting of events for media attention. One of the shows is dedicated entirely to returning to harbor to fix repairs, sell t-shirts and the need to replace half the crew who quit.  Their ""enemy"" is the Japanese sailors, and you are never told they are legally harvesting non-endangered whales and have a permit for a limited number.
My recommendation is to wait for reruns rather than invest in the video because you won't want to watch a second time.  The picture on the box is all you'll see of whales. If you rely on comments that it's the best thing ever seen, you will be extremely disappointed to have wasted your money on this DVD.",1232409600,10,1127,4.456310679611651

3666282,3,B001KKU9C8,"I caught a couple episodes of Whale Wars on Animal Planet. I was initially interested, but ultimately disappointed and a little surprised. There's a good documentary to be made about what is going on in the southern oceans, but this isn't it.

I have heard how the Sea Shepherds are supposed to be masters of public relations, but they did not come across that way to me. I don't think the crew would last five minutes with Captain Phil on Deadliest Catch. I saw a lot of poor organization, a lack of leadership, and a startling amount of inept seamanship. One attempt to launch two boats to pursue a factory ship involved delays and confusion in launching the boats, a failure to follow basic communication protocol, a broken thumb, a broken pelvis, and, in the end, a failure to intercept the whalers.

This is the Sea Shepherd's show, so self-promotion and spinning the story figure big in this series. I expected that. But I was again surprised to see it carried as far as an obviously faked shooting incident in the season finale. (It was about as believable as the word ""Research"" painted on the side of the factory whaling ship.)

Animal Planet makes a token attempt to be impartial in the midst of all this, by briefly presenting the Japanese whaler's version of events. But I felt no sympathy for either side and in the end just felt sorry for the whales.",1230422400,3,1364,4.604938271604938

They track down fleets of Japanese whaling ships. It is stated that international law allows for 1000 wales a year to be harvested. The whale ship crews hold up signs (in English) saying they are doing research. (?)

The crew of the Steve Irwin aspire to prevent the whaling by throwing stink bombs and tossing rope under the propeller to stop the hunt. Then, they decide to board a ship in an effort to get media attention.

On board they eat vegan meals. As I watch I wonder, ""What does whale meat taste like and where can I get some? How does a person prepare that? They are willing to risk their lives for animals!

Some pretty scenery, brave camera men. Appears to be actual real life adventure! Occasional cheesy attempts to ramp up the drama.

The views of the whales are incredible and at one point in particular, especially moving.  (The scene was in the final episode, so I don't want to spoil anyone by saying what it was exactly.  Trust me, you'll see it.)

It will make you think about your stance on animal rights.

I only gave it four stars because there were times that I wished they would educate the viewer more on the life of these whales and life at sea.

Well, on behalf of all the sea creatures saved from exploitation by Watson and his antics, thank you Captain Watson.

Whale Wars is one attempt to give viewers a taste of these efforts during one ""whaling season.""  technically, there is no whaling, but a loophole in an international whaling treaty allows for whales to be killed for ""research,"" and that same loophole then requires all parts of the whales to be utilized.  The whale flesh ends up for sale in markets in Japan... hundreds and hundreds of whales, mostly minke whales, as I remember.

Whale Wars is admittedly one-sided.  You won't really hear from the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society's critics (there is a brief comment from Greenpeace).  You really won't hear much from Japan (this separates it from, say,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Cove/dp/B002PLMJ74/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Cove</a>, which allows all sides to make their point without extinguishing the passions and hiding the actions of the marine mammal advocates).

It's not all fun and games.  Yes, the Animal Planet exaggerates the drama like viewers expect in shows such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ice-Road-Truckers/dp/B000UP8822/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ice Road Truckers</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Deadliest-Catch/dp/B00187FPCW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Deadliest Catch</a>.  But you see the human tension, the boredom, the danger, the injuries, the action, and the disappointments.

From what was presented, it is hard for me to agree with the crew of the Steve Irwin that they saved perhaps 400-500 whales from harpooning during this season, but they certainly kept some whales from being killed.  Yay for them!

The ending of this season with Watson being ""shot"" was really a let-down.  Clearly, forensic analysis of the spent bullet and the reconstruction of the ""attempted murder"" would have been very ""CSI-esque,"" and worthy of this type of show.  The fact that it wasn't done is telling.

3666352,5,B001KKU9C8,"I have been aware of the Sea Shepherd Society for nearly 20 years now.  I routinely introduced them to my environmental studies classes as we reviewed prominent environmental and conservation NGOs (non-governmental organizations).

The Sea Shepherds are a self-proclaimed direct action organization whose main agenda is the protection of marine species from illegal commercial exploitation.  Their highest profile work is the protection of whales in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary.  This is the focus of the reality series ""Whale Wars"".

The founder of the Sea Shepherds, Paul Watson, was one of the co-founders of Greenpeace, but he was eventually voted out of that organization because his tactics were generally viewed as being too confrontational and even counter-productive to the mainstream conservation organizations' efforts to lobby governments to take legislative and enforcement action against whaling and other marine crimes.  Paul Watson and his organization are, however, of the opinion that since governments are not stepping up to take legal action to stop illegal marine activities that NGOs have the option to do that.

The Sea Shepherds use a U.N. mandate and International Whaling Commission total ban on commercial whaling in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary (the waters off of Antarctica) to justify using non-lethal and non-injurious methods to harass and interdict the efforts of the Japanese Whaling fleet to whale in those waters.  At the same time, the position of the Japanese government is that they are carrying out legal lethal whale research, and that they are therefore not conducting commercial whaling.  The stipulation of the lethal whaling regulations are such that all parts of any whale that is killed for research must be used.  The Japanese fleet therefore allegedly takes scientific measurements on the allowed number of Minke and Finback whales they capture each season.  The Japanese fleet includes a factory ship where whales are processed and packages for shipment back to Japan.

This whaling is officially carried out by the ""Institute of Cetacean Research"" which, though an organization independent of the Japanese government, receives millions of dollars of subsidies from that government each year to carry out whaling.  it is this connection between the institute and the Japanese government that leads many governments to view Japanese ""research whaling"" to be little more than thinly disguised commercial whaling.

If the Japanese fleet (including a factory ship, three harpoon chase ships, and tanker/supply ships) were unharrassed they would be able to harpoon and kill nearly 1000 Minke and Finback whales each season.  Of course, the Japanese assert that they are not engaging in commercial whaling, but as many whale products as possible, including whale meat, is sold on the open market.  it is estimated that each whale may yield a minimum of $150,000/whale, and perhaps as much as $500,000 or more apiece.  During seasons when the Sea Shepherds were taking action against the Japanese fleet, they were able to slow whaling activities enough that by the end of the season the Japanese fleet was able to capture and kill only about 1/2 of the just under 1000 whales allowable under the scientific whaling quota.  So they are making a significant difference in that regard.

That's the stand-off.  Sea Shepherds are willing to put themselves at personal risk to stop whaling, with their own interpretation of the law that legalizes their actions, while the Japanese use their interpretation of the law to justify whaling in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary.  And so the stage is set.

Regardless of your personal position on whaling, you have to be intrigued by this war that takes place in the southern ocean each season, and is the focus of this video series.

I found this series to be fascinating.  While I am not generally an advocate of this kind of direct action, I am in complete sympathy with the basic idea that research involving lethal capture (harpooning) is no longer necessary, and is, in my personal opinion, a practice whose day is done.

FYI - my professional background is in marine biology, and I have spent my career teaching at college and university levels, with teaching assignments including environmental studies, marine biology, field marine ecology, and related courses, so I'm not completely in the dark on this issue.

I highly recommend taking a look at this series.  Like I said, it was fascinating, and I look forward to watching Season 2!

5 stars for being  a timely topic.  It is, after all, time to leave the whales alone.

Mr. Watson (I refuse to call him Captain) continuously puts his crew in danger by his lack of management skills and over sized ego.  As a career Navy man I laugh at the bungling crewmembers as they try to undertake the most basic of seamanship duties.  Early on Mr. Watson decides to do some crew training by launching of one of his inflatable boats while underway.  This training exercise was doomed from the start and almost resulted in the death of 4 crewmembers.  Not only was the exercise done incorrectly, Mr. Watson had no idea how to retrieve the crewmembers from the freezing water.  And to make matters worse, the helicopter tail rotor was damaged by a crewmember attempting to throw a grapling hook toward the overturned inflatable.  The crewmembers were evetually rescued thanks to the quick action of another officer on deck.

It seems like each and every time a tough decision needs to be made, Mr. Watson excuses himself from the bridge, or is sleeping in his quarters.  His idea of being a Captain is to initiate eco terrorist acts and then let the crew attempt to execute this plan while he is on the phone drumming up media interest in his zany attempt to save whales.  I'm sure that real Captains were stunned by his decision to attempt to transit through an ice field that could easily have sunk the ship, and his reckless navigation that caused minor collisons and near misses that could have resulted in the death of numerous mariners.  This man is deranged and should not be allowed to operate any type of vessel.",1266796800,10,1614,4.647887323943662
3666355,5,B001KKU9C8,"No matter how reckless, irresponsible, or whatever you may want to call the action's of the Sea Shepard's ultimately it is their passion, compassion, and that verve shine through. These people all signed on knowing the risks for doing so and yet were willing to put themselves in harms way not only to do the right thing but at heart out of love for these whales.

Whales are incredibly intelligent with a high capacity to feel such emotions as the agony of being shot in the head with a harpoon and writhing in pain for 20 minutes straight before they finally die a senseless death. What people don't understand is its one thing to watch such things from the safety of your cozy living room but to actually have to die that experience is pure hell. And for what, basically the greed of money under the guise of ""Research"".

I applaud what these brave, compassionate, heartfelt men and women are doing. If the world had more of these I'm positive the world would be a better place.",1266537600,4,981,4.536723163841808
3666356,5,B001KKU9C8,"I always thought that whaling was a thing of the past. The fabric of legend found in the pages of ""Moby Dick"". It wasn't until I came across Whale Wars that I was shocked to discover that it's still being practiced, unchecked and ""illegally"" in the Antarctic. Whale Wars follows the rag-tag crew of the M/V Steve Irwin(flagship of the Sea Shepherds) and her Captain Paul Watson(a founder of green peace who was kicked out do to his radical tactics)the only people dedicated enough to take action. Both sides of the conflict use loop holes in the law against each other. The whalers claim the law states that they are allowed to kill a set number of whales as long as it's for ""scientific research"". A law that they break in pretty comical ways. Japanese whaler ship simply write ""research"" on the side of their ships and hold up signs that say ""We're taking tissue samples!"" if they see that they're being videotaped. The ""Sea Shepherds"" are wise to this and take it into their own hands to stop the whaling in protected whale mating waters. It's one of those tricky things we're both sides are wrong and right at the same time. The show grabs your attention on the first episode when one of the launch boats breaks off a crane and nearly kills four of the crew. The show continues to keep its pace as we see the crew deal with faulty equipment,ice burgs, kidnapping, poor judgment and of course, the wrath of the whalers that they tick off. Whale Wars is a very fascinating show that sheds light on a subject that not many people are unaware of. Though their methods continue to be controversial, The Sea Shepherds strictly use non lethal methods and are non violent. I don't consider myself an environmentalist but by watching this show I can't help but have great respect for the Sea Shepherds. It's nice to see a group of people take action when lazy diplomacy fails, to have them act as a buffer against unchecked consumption and greed. I can't wait to follow the Steve Irwin crew on their upcoming adventures or more precisely, what the new volunteers are going to mess up. Whale Wars is a very enjoyable show and I'm sure Paul Watson and crew will find new and imaginative ways to give the whalers headaches as the show goes on.

In the last episode captain Paul Watson reveals himself as a more clever liar than I initially suspected.  He is a self-proclaimed ""student"" of The Art Of War and certainly applies premise #18: All warfare is based on deception.""

With a smug smile like a little fat kid in front of a news camera getting undeserved recognition, Watson attempts to deceive the American public into believing that he was actually shot.  I know a fair amount about what bullets do and I feel safe asserting that he fabricated that evidence ahead of time.  He was not shot by the Japanese.  Of course if people believe he was shot then that gives them reason for continued or increased violence...

What an amazing disrespect to Mr. Steve Irwin to ""justifiably"" attack others in his name.

Scruffy incompetent men with dreadlocks, veganism, poor hygiene, massive disrespect of the ""replaceable"" crew, hidden drug use, irresponsibility, begging for donations after neglecting equipment, poor safety procedures, ...

The documentary's camera work and imagery is reasonably well done, no complaints here.  Pacing can be a bit off.  Some episodes don't really accomplish much while others are action-packed and full of suspense.  Great personalities, the activists act and seem like real people, each with their own unique outlook and with plenty of political squabbling, breakdown in the chain-of-command, total inability to handle or think clearly in a crisis situation, 'activist logic' that does not really make sense to a typical observer, etc.  Most of this show plays out like a cross between a Shakespearean morality play and a reality show, but on occasion they find the whalers and confrontation of one type or another results.  These are the best parts, where we see the activists try to put their bizarre plans into action, often times with lasting consequences to the crew and/or their own morale.",1260144000,3,989,5.111801242236025

3666360,5,B001KKU9C8,"After hearing about the Sea Shepard Conservation Society, I didn't know too much about it and wanted to know more in detail of what they actually do out at sea. I purchased this video for that reason and was amazed at the hardship they go through. Most of their work is risky, but it is worth it when it comes down to saving the life of an innocent creature. I'm a marine life artist and I'm crazy about sea life. Especially whales and dolphins. They are very gentle, intelligent and magnificent beings of nature. Simply beautiful, and graceful. Never have I heard of a whale or dolphin hurting a human being intentionally. They are loving and kind creatures. I call them gentle giants of the deep sea. They are more curious of us than we are of them. They should not be treated in this cruel, brutal, barbaric and inhumane way. The Japanese whaling ships have the word ""Research"" written clearly on the side in English. Of course not in Japanese because they know what they are doing-really. But now they know that we (the rest of the world)know EXACTLY what they are doing. They are ignorant fools. They know what they are doing is wrong and illegal. They don't care and will never quit. It saddens me deeply every year around this time to know that thousands of whales and dolphins are being brutally murdered under my nose and there's not much I or anyone els except maybe the Sea Shepard crew can do about it. All we can do is send donations in order for the crew to continue their fight. It takes a lot of funding to upkeep their ship and all but when it comes down to saving the earth's whales, it's all worth it.

I appreciate what Captain Paul Watson, his shipmates and volunteers are doing. I highly admire and honor them. I wish I could go on his ship and stand up to the Japanese, to fight for what I believe in. Maybe, someday, hopefully I will by the will of God. Unfortunately, I think nothing will stand in the Japanese way. They will stop at nothing to keep on doing what they are doing and think is ok. They will always search for another way and keep on killing until there is not a single whale or dolphin left in our ocean's. We all fear the day when our school children will only read about our whales and dolphins in texbooks. Animals that they will never get to see. I know it is a terrible thought. No matter how terrible but we must keep it in mind. It's the only thing we have to keep us strong and motivated enough to try our best to save them from extinction. No matter what, we must never give up. Never give up hope. Never stop fighting until the Wars over. Just like Captain Watson. Even if it means your own life. To give your life to save another-animal or human, it is worth it. The battle may never end I'm afraid.

Japanese say this is legal and are doing this for scientific research. Is it ""legal"" to harpoon a whale, drag it by the tail out of the sea onto the deck of a ship only to be immediately chopped up into pieces and packaged as just another meat product before being shipped off to Japan's fish markets where it can be bought to be served onto someones dinner table? I CERTAINLY DO NOT! This is NOT reasearch! It is OUTRAGIOUS! Japanese and some other countries such as Denmark, Iceland and Sweden are also whaling. They wish to kill 50 humpback whales within the next few weeks or months. All these whalers are ignorant fools. They do not want to listen. They know that whale and dolphin meat is contaminated with extremely high levels of murcury. It is highly toxic to both humans and animals. It is a poison, they only care for profit and taste. They don't care if they get sick! I think they're already sick in my opinion. Sick in the mind!

Captain Paul Watson is a hero in my eyes but I wish he can find some better ways of throwing the bottles of stink bombs and slippery goo onto the Japanese ships. By hand it takes a lot of practice and to a newcomer(volunteers)it can be a tricky and a lot of hard work. Sometimes not too effective if a throw has missed the whaling ship. Maybe he should have some sort of machinery to do that, or like an old fashioned cannon like device? I know it would cost more funding, but if he really wants to save the whales anything is worth a shot.

I was very impressed by the video and would recommend it to anyone who is unaware with the killings of whales today, and who loves whales and other marine life as much as me. I give it a 5 star rating! Excellent. I wish to purchase the next video Whale Wars Season 2 when it is released.",1255478400,6,4525,4.301289566236811

These guys are to the global eco movement what Critical (M)Ass is to cycling rights: totally counterproductive. Clowns. Is anybody really surprised at just how inept these guys are? What a supreme waste of money, time and resources. Clowns that give 'activists' a bad name.
Please tell me nobody buys these dvds! There is entertainment value in watching these fools dig themselves deeper into a pit of embarrassing ineffectiveness.
Considering the misguided tactics of eco-terrorists counter-productive does not make me ""anthropocentric, pessimistic or self-righteous"". NO, I DO NOT HAVE A BETTER SOLUTION!  I watched two episodes last night including the penultimate installment of season 2... My opinions remain unchanged about the crew or their tactics: juvenile and inept. At one point there is even a self-realization that their actions are totally ineffective and purely employed to make themselves FEEL better. I am confused by the arbitrary guidelines of engagement... I mean why can the butyric acid not be launched with slingshots made from surgical tubing? Bottles of stink MUST be THROWN? Who writes these rules anyway? The whalers have outsmarted them at every turn... In the end, the ""shepherds"" rely on pity as you really do start to feel a bit sorry for them. What IS moving and affective is the documentation of the horror of the whale slaughter that FINALLY becomes very, very clear near the end... So now I assume they will get real upset and ram their boat into the Niishi Maru... we'll see. These people lost loads of credibility simply by not acting like adults...of course their ineptness didn't help either.

I can't believe anybody has the gall to criticize their efforts. The Japanese whaling industry has no credibility. They call their killing ""research"", but all they do in this research is weigh and measure the poor beast before slicing it up into steaks bound for high-end Japanese restaurants. Each whale is worth up to a million dollars in Japan. They fire these exploding harpoons into the whales and the things explode inside of them - not very ""humane"" killing in my mind. These whalers kill every whale they can find; that's been the way of the whaling industry all along. They used to go after only the biggest whales, the Fins and the Blues, leaving the much smaller Minke whales alone. But by now all the big ones are mostly gone, so NOW they are happily harpooning the little Minkes. And when they are all gone that will be it.

3666367,4,B001KKU9C8,"This seven-part documentary following the anti-whaling group Sea Shepherd is interesting, but not, perhaps, in the way you might expect.

The cover of the DVD, as well as the intro to each episode, suggest that ""Whale Wars"" is a high-adrenaline thrill ride showing the risky business of challenging Japanese whaling boats on the high seas. In fact, that's really only a small part of the documentary.

What we mostly get is an inside look at the dysfunctional Sea Shepherd team. They squabble, they bicker, they back stab, they blame one another. It's a bit like a reality show with each member trying to get someone else voted off.

They're also frequently incompetent. In trying to launch one of their small boats, it's mishandled, flips over and dumps several people into the freezing water. Later, they twice lose contact with a small boat sent out from the main ship because no one apparently has explained when and how to use the radio. In another instance, the launching of boats is bungled so badly one crew member breaks a thumb, another breaks her pelvis, and they have to call off a raid.

To be fair, they do have some successes in harassing the Japanese whaling boats, so if you support Sea Shepherd you will have something to feel good about. It's just that anti-whaling groups tend to widely publicize those events, so it's eye-opening to see the backstory.

The head of Sea Shepherd, Paul Watson, contends that the group is focused on physically stopping Japanese whalers, but the documentary reveals that much of their time and effort is spent on manipulating the media.

Maybe that`s why some people call them ""radicals"" or ""eco-terrorists"" but don`t be fooled ,all the tactics that they use are in most cases absolutely harmless. Well these are the good guys . The bad guys  are the japanese. Every year they intend to kill about 1000 whales for ""research"" purposes but we all know that`s a humongous lie. In reality all that whale meat goes to asian markets and restaurants , they even have a factory ship  to process and pack  the meat in site.
This series take you inside the Steve Irwin where you`ll meet CPTN. Watson and his crew of volunteers. you`ll see how they live , how they prepare for battle and most importantly you`ll see how they try to sabotage  the whaling ships in order to disable them and prevent them from killing whales  which is  absolutely exciting (the sabotaging).

I agree with  all the things they do  but I think they do need more training , organization and safety assesment because in some cases they did take stupid risks.

Not only to themselves by sending out untrained crew into dangerous waters but in the terrorism that we support. As a sailor who worked for NOAA for 5 years and got to spend 2 months tied alongside this boat when it was the Farley Mowat (before the renaming) and to see the incompetent crew doing VERY dangerous things.  They are ramming ships on the high seas and boarding vessels, that's called piracy!  And we say it's ok because it's for a good cause? How is celebrating these terrorists any different than buying the trading cards of Hammas suicide bombers? They did what they thought was necessary (misguided and wrong) and were willing to die for it.  I believe that is the pledge these crew members make before sailing, that they are willing to die to save a whale.  Yes the Japanese sell the meat from the whales they study.  Would it be better if they just pushed it over the rail and let it sink like NOAA does with the fish we catch to study? And I have met many whale researchers and not a single one has said that the whale species that are being taken are endangered and could not thrive with a managed hunt.

3666370,5,B001KKU9C8,"Animal Planet picked an interesting subject to try to compete with Discovery Channel's popular ""Deadliest Catch"" series.  This series documents the international whaling business, one that is both politically controversial and not well understood by the general public.  Most people seem to think that whaling was stopped all together at the start of the 20th century as most species of large whales were driven to near extinction, but that is not the case.  Whaling is still a multimillion dollar business in some countries.

This series analyzes the international legal interpretation of research vs. commerce and whether commercial whaling for profit is being hidden under the guise of science.  Whether this is true is left up to the viewer, but the Sea Sheppard organization does a good job making its case.  I have seen several complaints that the show only portrays the Sea Sheppard's side of the story.  Although the video footage only came from the Steve Irwin vessel, as cameras were never brought onto the Japanese whaling vessels, the Japanese side of the arguement is presented in the story as well.

I felt that most of crew members of the Steve Irwin come across as self righteous.  However, this is very understandable given the circumstances.  After all, if you believe in a cause enough to risk your life over it, you would be self righteous as well.

I applaud Animal Planet for producing this show.  They took a big chance which is obvious by their disclaimer that the show does not necessarily reflect the views of Animal Planet.  The Whale Wars show brings to public spotlight the controversial subject of international whaling and whale's plight for survival.  I am looking forward to season 2.",1235088000,6,1717,5.0

They have never hurt any one at sea, but the whalers have lost 2 crew member at their own faults for this line of work. The Japanese whalers will use any means necessary, including extreme violence against protesters to protect their very cruel and greedy whale killing industry.

If you need more information about whale killing and the laws go look them up. The truth is out there. Don't just take the hate comments, that have given this series 1 star just to lower the rating of this series. They are paranoid and follow around everything that Sea Shepherd posts on the internet including youtube videos and anti-whaling clips just  make and post comments about Sea Shepherd being so called ""eco-terrorists"" a label given to the conservation society to make people think they are some how crazy extreme violent group, which they are not.

Sea Shepherd have the highest level of integrity. I have followed the whaling industry and the Sea Shepherd and compared both sides. Sea Shepherd have proven to be the on the side of the law. Japanese have exploited a loophole in order to kill whales for food under the guise of research but all they actually do it gut the whales and weigh them. No real data is given. What information is given is used to justify, the restart killing of other species of whales like the humpback. But because the loophole exists, they continue to kill.

The Japanese had also been invited to contribute to this series by offering their side of the story but they refused. SO if the series seems one sided, it is at the fault of the whalers.  Not Animal Planet or the Sea Shepherd.

As for the series, when I watched it, my opinion is that it is extremely exciting. I was on the edge of my seat wanting to know what was going to happen next.  I have learned a lot about the Sea Shepherd conservation society and what they have done for seals and other marine wild life and had been impressed. But when I watched this series, the depth of their willingness and compassion for whales is so deep, to risk their lives just to save whales is amazing.

I truely felt that no one is so brave to actually stand up for what they believe to that extent in this world any more or at least there are a very rare few. It also gives the human side of being cramped into a small ship, and having to be with a bunch of other people who at times made mistakes. I felt this series is well made. I love the music samples to used for the series Smashing Pumpkins, the world is a vampire. It fit perfectly.

So don't turn away just because this has gotten low star rating by a few who just hate Sea Shepherd.

 It is an exciting series. This is true reality show!!!!! I can not wait for the second series to come out. The Japanese whalers have increased their violence by using LRAD Long Range Acoustical Devices (LRAD's) and high powered water cannons against the Sea Shepherd crew.

So stay tuned!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1234051200,12,3018,4.487226277372263
