8413730,4,B0034PJWGG,"This is my first review for Amazon.  I felt it necessary to respond to the previous review, which is the only one here, in order to provide an alternate viewpoint.  The perfectionist tendency of collector-reviewers is basically a good thing because it helps to keep (one hopes) the dvd manufacturers on their toes.  There comes a point, however, when such a tendency becomes counterproductive.  I am currently studying the films of Raul Ruiz, and those who are doing the same know how difficult it is to see much of this great filmmaker's extensive oeuvre.  Only his late work, during his French commercial art film (that seems the best way to describe it) period, is fairly easy to find on dvd.  YouTube has been a great, though mixed, blessing:  I've been able to see much of his early and middle period work, including most of the films he made in Chile (!), but much of it is unsubtitled.  I can read more than a dozen European languages (which helped on a couple features, which had Italian and German subtitles), but I can't get very much out of the spoken languages.  I tried watching DIALOGUES OF THE EXILED on YT unsubtitled, but I gave up because I was getting so little out of the dialogue, and there is a lot of it in this film (the title says as much).  I had decided not to buy this dvd because of the bad review here, which was echoed by an entry on Criterion Forum, but I finally gave in and ordered it from Amazon.  Lo and behold, it was VERY watchable, quite beautiful in many ways (yes, I noticed a couple of slight instances of video jiggle in the opening scene, but that's it)--and it was well subtitled in English.  I was very happy with the purchase.  The film itself is excellent, one of Ruiz' better films, and one of the best of his films available on dvd.  It's complex and very interesting, both aesthetically and thematically, further confirmation of his greatness as a filmmaker.  If you are at all interested in Ruiz, don't put off buying this edition (unless you are fully fluent in French and Spanish).  Sure, a Criterion Blu-ray edition will improve on this--but don't hold your breath for it to appear.  This edition is fine for the price--and thank you Facets for rescuing this and other worthwhile obscurities and releasing them on sometimes less-than-perfect dvds.  And thank you Amazon for making them easily accessible to collectors.",1404950400,2,2373,4.649880095923262
8413731,1,B0034PJWGG,"This is probably a good film, perhaps a great one (Raul Ruiz, the filmmaker, is one of the great ones), but the DVD transfer is so poor that the film is unwatchable.  Whenever the camera moves, the characters fluctuate and shake.  It's almost like a strobe effect whenever a character walks through a room or on the street, and the effect/glitch is highly distracting and disorienting.  Your eyes begin to ache.  I could only tolerate 15 minutes of this before it became intolerable.  Facets DVD are highly variable, and from strictly a technical standpoint, this is the worst one I've ever seen.",1350691200,2,596,4.803921568627451
