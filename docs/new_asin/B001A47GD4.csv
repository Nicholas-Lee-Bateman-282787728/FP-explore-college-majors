8275977,5,B001A47GD4,"An obvious classic Doctor Who masterpiece, made so by accomplished director Christopher Barry, one of if not THE best for the entire series!
This story has a very natural and easy flow.
Barry is an excellent storyteller, his talent truly shows here.
The Brain Of Morbius is basically a 1976 Sci-Fi Fantasy update of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein concept.
It has the same morbid gruesomeness but with Alien body parts this time.
The original script was more Sci-Fi oriented as written by Terrance Dicks, veteran Who writer but budget constraints dictated a change. An unhappy Dicks removed his name from the project.
His robot mad scientist would have been more interesting and challenging, I think.
The reworked script by Robert Holmes (Robin Bland, an inside joke) is much more traditional horror.
Some of the scenes are a bit disturbing, especially for young children.
Personally I was most offended by the use of exploding fake blood squibs when Condo, the new Igor, was gunshot by his Frankenstinian master, Solon. Unnecessarily realistic.
But violence is common in this story.
An alien loses his, or its head early on thanks to Condo and his sickle hand. I think this creature is recycled from the Jon Pertwee era story The Mutants, 1972, also directed by Christopher Barry.
The villagers of the original Frankenstein have been replaced by a curious group of women who call themselves The Sisterhood Of Karn, the planet where all this takes place.
They make for some interesting interaction between the Doctor and all other characters in this story but they come across as goofy and isolated. Comic Relief, almost.
Anyway, Morbius is an infamous Time Lord who everyone thought was executed long ago but NOT so!
The fourth Doctor is diverted to the planet of Morbius's death, Karn, to investigate and rather reluctantly. This sets up some great scenes understandably.
Upon first meeting Solon develops a covetous affinity for The Doctor's Head. A constant worry throughout this story.
At some point Sarah Jane is afflicted with blindness temporarily so that intensifies the danger and suspense element.
The overall look and feel of this production is something like a cross between a Hammer horror and a Tim Burton film, even though the year 1976 was some time before Burton's career began.
This truly is a sophisticated production, very intelligent and extremely well done.
Very impressive!

The included documentary extra, Getting A Head mentions Peter Cushing and Vincent Price were considered for the role of mad scientist Solon. I could see Cushing, I think it would have added some needed creepiness but Price would have been too obvious. I think he would have clashed with Tom Baker.
Philip Madoc, the actor who portrays Solon is decent but not exactly personable, if that makes sense. He comes on a little too strong, like Vincent Price would have but without the personality.

I do enjoy The Brain Of Morbius very much, it reminds me of an old E. C. horror comic book.
An essential gothic masterpiece for Doctor Who.
