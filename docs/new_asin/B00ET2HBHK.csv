8609176,5,B00ET2HBHK,"While it's always been common sport for we older ones to disdain the younger generation of teens as rude, lazy, obnoxious and self-centered; I think that we often fail to realize the role that biology plays in coloring our perceptions. After all, were we older ones THAT much different at one time? Through an expose of research and thoughtful interviews with psychologists, educators, parents and teenagers themselves; this video shows how adolescent behaviors are largely shaped by biological factors concerning brain development. Highly recommended to people like me who are interested in psychology and brain science, as well as, parents and professionals who deal with teenagers!",1480809600,,684,5.462264150943396
8609177,3,B00ET2HBHK,"I was reading an article and it suggested purchasing this video to get an in depth look at how the teenage brain works. The writer suggested teachers, parents and teens and anyone who deals with teens should view this video.  I started viewing this video and found it to be very technical, in fact too technical for teens (as suggested  by the writer of that article).",1434931200,,368,4.5606060606060606
8609178,5,B00ET2HBHK,"The Frontline video concerning the developing teenage brain is a must have for parents, guardians, and educators, who have ever begged the question, ""Why does he/she do that?"" This video provides several answers to that and other questions by providing an in-depth look into the neurology and psychology on how teens process information, in addition to the causes behind their sometimes erratic decision-making behaviors. I instruct parents, guardians, and educators, alike, and use this video in my workshops. As with other PBS/Frontline series, this video was well thought and produced using science and technology interwoven with personal accounts from several families, who allowed producers to video their daily lives of raising their teens in the 21st century. I highly recommend this video.",1424995200,2,797,5.540983606557377
8609179,5,B00ET2HBHK,"Not sure what and can't seem to fathom why you or your teenager can't seems to process situations the same way? Just as we suspect that we are very much the same yet believe that each individual is unique in their experiences, well your teenage experience can't begin to help you understand the complexities of how the teenagers struggle to make meaning of what goes on today. At least for you and I, times were a lot simplier then.",1312848000,,432,4.481012658227848
8609180,5,B00ET2HBHK,As a high school teacher I found this video great for my Anatomy and Physiology class during the nervous system unit. I also played to a class full of sophmores.,1299715200,4,161,4.4
8609181,5,B00ET2HBHK,"This is a superb 60 minute program. It combines brain science with behavioral psychology to explain now just how teenagers function, but why.

""It's the mystery of mysteries -- especially to parents. Now the experts are exploring the recesses of the brain and finding explanations for why adolescents behave the way they do and how the new discoveries can change the way we teach, or perhaps even understand, our teenagers.""",1256256000,4,424,5.057142857142857
