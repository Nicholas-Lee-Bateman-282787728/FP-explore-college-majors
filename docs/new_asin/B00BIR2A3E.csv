5623276,5,B00BIR2A3E,I stumbled across season 1 and watched it all rather quickly.  I have to say I am missing it and am excited to see a Season 2 coming out in June!,1364947200,,145,3.6774193548387095
5623277,5,B00BIR2A3E,"I am so excited that CALL THE MIDWIFE has received a second series!  My friends and I fell in love with the show from the very first episode.  My only problem is that we also watch THE AMAZING race, and both shows air at the same time.
I also find it completely appropriate that CALL THE MIDWIFE will air the first episode of the new season on Easter Sunday.  It is a show about birth, life, and death in Poplar, East London after all.  I like to focus on the births in the show.
I'm not too worried if I miss series two because I can always catch it through our cable's on demad service.  And it's already being released to DVD and blu-ray in mid June?  Fantastic!  I'll be pre-ordering it as soon as possible.
The Christmas episode literally broke my heart.  At the same time, it's one of my favourites, so I'm no less than thrilled to see that it has been added as bonus material for series two.
My high regards for the cast, as well.  Jessica Raine won me over from the get-go.  These ladies are supurb in their craft.  I look forward to seeing what they manage to bring to series two.
Fingers crossed and prayers breathed that there will indeed be a series three!
How sad I am to know that Miss Jenny Worth passed away only two weeks before the filming of series one began.  I so wish I could have met her.  At least the world was blessed for having her here.  We can get to know her though her memoirs and the series.  Thank God!",1364256000,36,1435,4.186131386861314
5623278,5,B00BIR2A3E,"Hot new season 2. Young nurses assist older charitable nuns in East London poverty squalor. The birthing of a new generation. Action comes out of the Nonnatus House, but births take place in the dwellings of the pregnant women, or worse. Less than hospitable for a newborn, but whatever it takes, the nurses are up to the task.

Romance tickles the non-nun nurses adding a sub-plot, as do other medical conditions, and community situations. Episodes have multiple story threads at the same time, like contemporary novels. Viewers quickly learn personalities of regulars. Sometimes events are heartbreaking, sometimes heart warming. Sadness to LOL joy. Births and sometimes death. A lady's 1st child to 25th, literally. Triplets? Father's optional. Secrets and rampant gossip. It's all a part of the lives of these street nurses of the late 1950s. The settings are perfection, but not always idyllic. Many births are shown, with discrete use of camera angles. Delightful fifties Rock-n-roll music accompanies the episodes in all the right places. Beginning, ending, and other narration, given by the aged voice of the primary character, Jenny, is Vanessa Redgrave. The young girl, Jenny, is played by the lovely Jessica Raine, her first large role. Done well. She carries on through the first 2 seasons.

This show may give Downton Abbey a run for its historic sterling money. Ten cast members are in all (or just missing one) episodes of season 1 and 2. Season two is as good as one, always leaving viewers desiring more. There may never be an end to the series, as long as poor women continue to have babies. They call the midwife, and the midwife arrives, usually riding a bike.
Pam Ferris & Judi Parfitt (both of `Little Dorrit') are nuns.

Series two contains 8 new 50 min episodes, no episode titles, just numbered.
The Series 2 DVD adds the 2012 Christmas special.
SDH SUBTITLES provided for those needing that.
Series one had 6. The concept and beginning episodes are based on the memoirs of Jennifer Worth. That knowledge makes the scenes seem more relevant and historic.
A certifiable MUST VIEW.

I'll bet a case of disposable diapers that there will be a season three.",1362873600,106,2178,4.958904109589041

The only reason I didn't give it a five out of five was that I didn't care for the Christmas episode.  It seemed drawn out for some reason.  Yet you take the other Christmas episodes in the series and I like them, especially season six with the trip to South Africa.  Go figure.

It is utterly amazing how some of the very controversial and delicate subject matter is handled in such a way that not only is the viewer not offended, but ends up empathizing to the point where the ""controversial stuff"" has no bearing at all on the emotions.",1469577600,,503,4.419354838709677

The power of love is so beautifully portrayed in this series. The midwives unconditionally accept each person because they know that being judgemental is not part of their work--which is to help bring life into the world. Life is born in many ways--both physical and figurative--in each episode. Love is given in the toughest of situations. This series give ME life every time I watch it!

From the first rate acting by the entire cast to the outstanding production values and well-written scripts, this show soars. Based on the memoirs of Jennifer Worth, it focuses on  Jenny, a young nurse and midwife, as well as  on her colleagues, in the teeming and impoverished East End slum of Poplar in London. Working with the nuns in a local convent, these dedicated young midwives provide necessary health  care to those in the neighborhood, with the focus being on those women who are pregnant.

This show takes place in the late 1950s, and the authenticity of period transports the viewer to a bygone time. It is the dawning of the national health care system in England, and  in late 1950s England home births were still the norm. So, historically, this show is fascinating. It certainly makes the viewer appreciate the comforts and medical marvels of today. Moreover, the personal triumphs and travails of each and every one of the  characters are totally engrossing. I am so hooked. I totally love this show and have just begun TV binging on season three!",1453507200,,1129,4.854166666666667

Perhaps my favorite series ever, besides MAD MEN and DOWNTON ABBEY.
This remarkable series will stay with you, from its amazing set , costume, and musical evoking of the 1950s to it's splendid actors to it's tragicomic brilliance.
Yes, it's about an East End midwife
and her clients and colleagues in post-war  London;
but it's riveting for men, too.
What a gem!

The main characters are there in each episode but there is a complete story in every one. They are all heartwarming and some will make you laugh  while others will leave you with tears in your eyes.
The language has boardered on course a time or two but it's not bad  Social issues are addressed so parents need to decide if they want their children to watch.
I could sit down and watch all eight episodes at once but I force myself to do one at a time.  I have alrady placed season 3 on my wish list.

5623481,5,B00BIR2A3E,I love all of this series. You love & care for each of the characters as they appear in turn. This was before the pill and when women had children at home. All the acting is terrific. Sister Monica Joan is so funny. I have just watched series 4 several times i never tire of it. I want to watch series 5 instead. For some reason i have 3 of series 2. I decided to buy 2 of series one as i have many of my DVDS in containers whilst i rearrange my home. The call the Midwife series is all together except series 1 is obviously in a diff. container so i decide to re-order it and buy 2 so i can give a friend series 1 & 2. I have the rest. You will not be disappointed. I remember first seeing Chummy in series 1 and you fall in love with her. Actually this happens with all the characters in this series. The writing is fantastic as is all of the production. I just can not wait for series 5 and it appears the pill is about to come out but i hope they do not move through the decades too fast. There must be many stories they can develop. It was at first based on a book of Memoirs but i believe it is very commercially viable. BUY you will not be disappointed.

The acting, the sets, the writing, the costumes, all perfect! The character are people you will love forever. Just good, clean entertainment. Do not let the fact that a lot of the show takes place in a convent fool you. Or that there are several lead characters that are nuns. This show is NOT about religion at all. It is about women caring for women and children. It is about the late 50's, early 60's in the dodgy end of London. It is about the people there, how they lived and loved. How they took care of their own. There is a fare amount of, uh not comedy, but amusing antidotes, too. So, you get it all, tears, laughter, tender moments, tragedy, suspense, feel good moments, heroes and heroines, bad guys and gals. It is just a good show, about  great subject matter. Midwifery and babies are a bonus. There is a lot of grunting and moaning (labor and delivery.) So much so, I felt the need to let my husband know I wasn't watching porn on my computer. LOL. If you could only hear this show,  and not see what is happening, it might sound a little like porn.",1431302400,3,1224,4.364035087719298

5623526,5,B00BIR2A3E,"This is unquestionably one of the very best dramas on television. The show is about ordinary, poor people in East London and the challenges they face in just living, and especially having babies. The midwives are a group of young women who work with some Anglican nuns to provide health services to pregnant women. The acting is first-rate, the writing sparkles with just the right balance of pathos and mirth that one finds in daily life. The realism of setting is outstanding. Here, you will find no polished soup spoons, or men in white ties serving aristocrats, but rather people that we can all relate to. It is ultimately an uplifting show, without coarse jokes about body parts or profanity of any sort.

I liked watching these on public TV when I happened to come across them and now wish that I have kept it that way instead of just getting all three seasons on DVD, but that, I guess, has it's ""plus"" side, too ...

5623548,5,B00BIR2A3E,"I guess most memoirs are tinged with the most poignant memories, those that remain with us longest, and it's pretty much the same with this series. Call the Midwife tugs and drags on the heart, both joyfully and painfully. The programme itself is a dramatic depiction of the young midwives and nuns that help care for the local Poplar community in the 1950's. Full of great characters and life lessons that we should value all the more now. Yes, life seems a lot simpler then, though I doubt many that lived through that era would agree that life then, in London, was by any means simple. More truthful..probably. The acting is top notch with a stellar cast. Miranda Hart ditches her comedy alter ego for the role of Chummy and by God, you love her. Jessica Raine, as the voice, eyes, ears and heart of the series is simply stunning (this is her first role) as Nurse Jenny Lee. In fact, everyone is outstanding.
Each and every episode juggles multiple storylines effortlessly, managing to wring every ounce of emotion out of me, without ever feeling staged or 'set up'. You will laugh and cry (and maybe more than once) in most episodes. 1950's East London breathes into life as the backdrop to this very human series. If you are reading reviews to decide whether to watch this series or not, I plead that you do. It's a life affirming set of stories that will make you feel glad to be alive on this spinning planet.
Finally, I have read many comments that say 'you will love it if you love Downton or British TV'....and I will politely disagree and simple say that you will love it. Period.",1419638400,2,1591,4.547038327526132

5623590,5,B00BIR2A3E,"I consider myself to be a sensitive guy... but the nuns and nurses of ""Call the Midwife"" have a way of reducing me to tears like nothing has in a long time (at least when it comes to a TV show!)  Jenny Lee and the other nurses and nuns are back for more tales of love, fear, hope, and bringing babies into the world of the 1950s in the poorest parts of east end London.
Series 2 picks up very nicely from the excellent first series in much the same vein of stories and tales of human spirit in the midst of great poverty.  Big issues (as relevant now as they were in the 1950s) are tackled including cot death, contraception (or lack thereof), abortion, and spousal abuse.  There's a spot of ""daring do"" between Trixie and Sister Evangelina of all pairs involving a pregnant girl on a Swedish cargo ship that is both entertaining and suspenseful at the same time.  Jenny's relationship with Jimmy goes through some interesting twists and turns, and we have to say a short goodbye to Chummy who volunteers to be a short-term missionary to Africa.  Just thinking about the beautiful farewell she is given by her friends makes me... oh my... here come the tears!!  She is ""replaced"" for a time by Jane, a painfully shy medical orderly who warms to me only gradually, but she is just as beautiful as the other women.  The final episode is harrowing and maybe a little melodramatic, but I still cried so much I couldn't see straight!
It's hard to know what to praise more with ""Call the Midwife""... the excellent writing, the beautiful women (no matter how quirky, tough, or sad they may be they are all fine specimens of womanhood), or the exquisitely rendered 1950s setting.  Whatever the secret is, I hope it continues for a good while to come!",1409270400,,1742,4.507936507936508

The personalities of the midwives, the sisters, and others connected to each episode are engaging. As they deal personally with life and death, and even find themselves in strange or funny situations, I find myself feeling as though I were joining them, trying to deal with each challenge. Call the Midwife is one of the better series, different than the usual for British entertainment. I hardily recommend it.",1401580800,,510,4.806818181818182

5623683,5,B00BIR2A3E,"Call the Midwife:  Season 2.  Absolutely love it.  From a medical point of view, the nurses did a wonderful job with what they had to work with.  Important for making us aware of past history, albeit some very negative things.  Wonderful to see the developments implemented little by little for a viable healthcare system.  The character relationships are so well done.",1395964800,,369,4.967213114754099

5623687,5,B00BIR2A3E,"Although the complete opposite of Downton Abbey, which showed us the affluence and glam of WWI-era estate-living England, Call the Midwife shows us what life was like in the East-end of London after WWII.  The visuals of tenement housing, ""the docks"" and bombed-out rubble is amazing.  For entirely different reasons than the Grandtham gang, the characters of Midwife are equally defined and endearing. There's the young nurse midwives...Nurse Jenny, the main story teller, who harbors the secret of a unrequited love; Chummy, the awkward but lovable one who finds unexpected romance; Nurses Trixie and Cynthia, and the sisters of Nonnatus House...especially Sister Monica Joan with the Alzheimer's and petty thieving tendencies.  A wonderful cast.  And the supporting cast with personal stories each episode truly create the sense of life in the East End of London in the 40's and 50's.  Period music adds to the authenticity.  Each episode contains at least one fairly graphic birthing scene, complete with screams and wet newborn babies. But it is always very tastefully done.  A fascinating (and I imagine, realistic) look at midwifery and home deliveries before modern techniques and procedures.
I am really enjoying Call the MidWife.  I purchase an entire season at a time, and must force myself not to ""binge-watch"" and get through an entire season in a weekend.  Rather, I limit myself to only 2 episodes a week...always eager for the next one.
I HIGHLY recommend this series.",1395360000,,1484,5.201680672268908

5623689,5,B00BIR2A3E,"I love the series as it is a look at what some would suggest were ""kinder, gentler days"", however it is a kind reminder that suffering and the ""daily-ness"" of life circumstance, provides opportunity for each generation to triumph. An inspiration and tribute to those who had a most intimate task. Witness to the challenges, joys and sorrows of life in an unheralded helping profession capturing the essence of the value, gift and miracle of life.",1395273600,,446,4.881578947368421

5623693,5,B00BIR2A3E,A gal pal of mine recommended this and I really love it. I like true life stories and this is taken from an actual journal for a mid wife in post world war 2 London.

I think that the only down side to these are worldly definitions of love, pragmatic manipulation of circumstances, the narrated story is often convoluted in it's philosophy. Many episodes are left unresolved and a bit fatalistic.",1394582400,,308,5.4375

5623708,5,B00BIR2A3E,"Definitely not a lived happily ever after series. Is supposed to be based on the main character's memoirs which I have not read, so I don't know how true it's stayed. Some ups, some downs. Captures the harsh realities of life before birth control but also demonstrates the determination of getting on with the job of life regardless of what gets handed to you. The characters all have great chemistry with each other. Some of the actors and actresses I've never seen before but they've made me care what happens to them.  The sets are fantastic and the extensive details are staggering. Some of the birth scenes are simply amazing, no idea how they're done they're so realistic. Portrays the very human side of the Midwife but also exhibits the importance they had in Great Britain in saving lives of mothers and babies and sidelines of being visiting nurses as needed for general medical care. Watched Season One in 1 day and ordered Season 2 that evening. Received Season 2 during the week but watched it on Saturday. I've pre-ordered Season 3 and can't wait.",1393113600,2,1061,4.735135135135135

The actors are so believable and the scenery so realistic that it was a delight to watch.  I found myself laughing out loud and crying with sadness over the episodes.  The bonus section on the third disc about midwifery is a not-to-be-missed behind-the-scenes look at how the filming was done and how nurse-midwives really worked during that time period.  Altogether an excellent series!  I look forward to the third season, and already have placed my order for the DVD set when it becomes available.",1392163200,,613,4.8

5623718,5,B00BIR2A3E,"It reminded me of my own life in the 50's.  My mother and father  were humble blue collar parents of 8 children who somehow made ends meet without health insurance most of the family's life. We live in a neighborhood much life the south  end of London, roe houses, lots of children playing in the street, big church influence, men in and out of work and lot of babies.",1391817600,,368,4.304347826086956

5623722,5,B00BIR2A3E,I love this show. It is my favorite show on PBS. I can't wait every March until it returns. I recommend it to everyone to view. You will love it!,1391385600,,145,3.8666666666666667
5623723,3,B00BIR2A3E,"This was highly rated, but I wasn't all that excited about it.  It was average as far as acting and story line in my opinion.",1391040000,2,125,4.0

5623725,5,B00BIR2A3E,"I hadn't heard about this series but fell into it by chance. What a lucky break for me. Call the Midwife is one of the best PBS programs ever. Although it seems more Dickensian it takes place in 1950's London and the background music is of that time.
This series is so compelling you simply want more. It is not the soap opera that Downton Abbey is.
I have one problem. The last episode seen on TV is not on this disk.",1390694400,,418,4.109756097560975
5623726,5,B00BIR2A3E,I LOVE this show. I'm OBSESSED with it. The second season didn't disappoint and left me  pining for the release of the third..,1390521600,,126,4.478260869565218
5623727,5,B00BIR2A3E,The choosing of 5 stars was due to delvery time and the nature of the story which appeal to my English roots and the time period during which the story happened coincides with my age.  I would recommend the  DVD to anyone who likes human interest stories.,1390348800,,255,4.404255319148936
5623728,5,B00BIR2A3E,This series helps to remind me why I chose to be a labor and delivery nurse for over 30 years.  I love this series.,1390348800,,115,3.7916666666666665
5623729,5,B00BIR2A3E,"My wife and I have thoroughly enjoyed this series.  I lived in London in the mid '50s.  Though a decade after this series is set, it does remind me of life in those times, though there was far more challenges with shortages and 1,000,000 young British men dead and 1,000,000 young women faced with the challenge of rebuilding a great nation.

Partly there is a personal touch.  We are blessed with 3 fine daughters, 2 grandchildren, and a granddaughter to be delivered soon.  The path has not been without risk or loss.  While my role has been largely to anxiously drink coffee, I have always appreciated my wife's and daughters' special nature and capability to bring new life to an aging world.  This series brings an added dimension to that.

Finally, the series also illustrate that while humanity has made progress, we still fall far short of opening our arms to all who are born into this world.  We fall short of building communities that offer opportunity and the discipline and kindness necessary to sustain them.  We can do better the old-fashioned way.  We simply do better each day, and each day that we don't, we lift each other up, and do better the next.

I wish the series success in the future.",1390348800,3,1211,4.633802816901408

It tells some difficult historic truths without being excessively preachy.  Those two sentences are really the highest praise for a television program.",1390089600,,284,5.1521739130434785

5623732,5,B00BIR2A3E,I love everything about this series! The midwives in training are so sincerely portrayed.  The nuns are such characters but understanding and wise.  The doctor and other minor characters form a real community.  Each session teaches a valuable lesson about caring and treating everyone with respect.  This would be a great teaching tool for an adult or teen education program.,1389830400,,375,5.2

5623737,5,B00BIR2A3E,"Great DVD..second season of the nurse and Anglican nun midwives in a very poor section of London in the fifties.  Acting is great, music is very nostalgic, and the stories are down to earth.  This is the kind of TV that makes you feel good.  Crazy about Chummy and Sister Monica Jean!",1389571200,,284,4.423076923076923
5623738,5,B00BIR2A3E,"When I saw the promos on PBS for the first series of Call the Midwife I thought ""obstetrics in an East London slum in the 1950s, yuck!"", but I happened to catch the first few minutes of the first episode and was hooked immediately.  This beautiful dramatization of the memoirs of Jennifer Worth is one of the most spellbinding series I've ever seen on television.

I'm glad to say that the second series is as wonderful as the first.  Most of the regular characters are back, starting with the heroine Jenny Lee, her fellow lay midwives Trixie, Cynthia, and Chummy, and the Anglican nuns who run Nonnatus House as a charity in the East London neighborhood of Poplar: wise Sister Julianne, practical Sister Evangelina, sweet Sister Bernadette, and of course the ethereally batty Sister Monica Joan. There are some new faces as well, most importantly Jane, a timid workhouse survivor who comes to Nonnatus House as a servant and finds love there when an overly talkative vicar becomes a chaplain.

The seven episodes mostly focus on various aspects of midwifery, though one does show Jenny seconded to a large London hospital, where she discovers one of her patients is an old friend and former romantic interest. There are some heartrending stories that involve a ""ship's woman,"" a woman so desperate to end her ninth pregnancy that she seeks an illegal abortion, or a West Indian woman who has to face racial prejudice. There's love and laughter mixed in with the drama, too, and in the end we see new happiness for Chummy and Bernadette and possibly Jenny, too.  Each episode is about 70 minutes long.  If you saw them on PBS be aware that, like the first series, there was some editing of some of the more ""vivid"" material done before broadcast.",1389571200,,1747,4.768211920529802
5623739,5,B00BIR2A3E,"This is such a down to earth and wholesome series.  They deal with some very difficult subjects in such a profound, sensitive and nonjudgmental way!  Since the series is based on true experiences, the value is even greater.  Wonderful writing, acting and delivery!",1389484800,,264,5.093023255813954
5623740,5,B00BIR2A3E,"It's a thoughtful series with well developed characters, well written scripts, and situations that are moving and thought provoking.  I think this is one of the best BBC series out there.  It also gives me a glimpse of the 1950's, the era I was born, and the kind of work my mother, who was a nurse, might have done.",1389484800,,316,4.338983050847458

5623744,5,B00BIR2A3E,"I love this series!  In a time where there is so much ""junk"" on television, it's so nice to have a series like this one to count on.  Can't wait for Season 3!",1388793600,,158,3.757575757575758
5623745,5,B00BIR2A3E,"Join Chummy and her fellow nurses in season of Call the Midwife. Once again the nurses including Jenny Lee make their rounds caring for their patients. In one memorable scene two nurses (one was a Sister) had to climb a rope ladder to care for a sea captain's daughter who was in the throes of labor.

Capping off season two was the labor and delivery of Chummy's baby.

If you enjoy well-written television shows you will love Call the Midwife.

Highly recommend.

5623750,5,B00BIR2A3E,A great series - very informative and a beautiful series.  I love the interaction between the midwives and the families that use their services.

5623751,5,B00BIR2A3E,"I grew up in East London in the 40-50s around the corner from a ""Nurses Home"" like this one, without the nuns, so it strikes a strong and nostalgic chord I my heart.  The setting is incredibly authentic, even includes a snatch of an old radio show called ""The Goon Show"" heard when Chummie turns on the old radio set.  The characters are beautifully acted and show real people in real situations dealing with extremely difficult lives with dignity and beauty.  The occasional prayers, chanting and singing of the nuns is beautiful!",1387497600,,531,4.75

5623836,5,B00BIR2A3E,"Once again another great BBC series.  I loved the kindness and the understanding that they incorporate into the script. It does show a broad spectrum of situations a midwife would face in a poorer class environment, but I like how they show the joy and happiness that the families experienced despite their circumstances.  The characters are delightful and they continue on in the second season.  Loved both the 1st and the 2nd season of this show!",1378252800,,448,4.868421052631579

5623842,3,B00BIR2A3E,"I did not enjoy season 2 as much as the first season. This season seemed to have a soap opera feel to it. It was nice to have chummy return but I didn't care for the turmoil one sister was going through. I also wasn't that crazy with the cliff hanger, will the place close or will it stay open? Some of the cases the mid wives were sent on was a bit much. Lets hope season 3 gets back on track.",1378166400,4,394,3.817073170731707

I hesitated watching it a year ago because I thought it would focus solely on midwifery, but that is but a small portion of the plots. Much more centers around the interesting history of that era and the circumstances of people's lives in East London in the 1950s, as well as the personalities and adventures of the winsome main characters. We thought that nothing could top Downton Abbey, but this series may just edge it out!",1378166400,,504,4.549450549450549

It appealed to me because I was born in 1952 and I could see what it was really like in that time for expectant mothers and what they went through. Every episode dealt with a different situation, which made it interesting. There is something for everyone. Loved it!!!",1377820800,,431,4.4

The characters are developed well, I feel as if I know each one of them personally.  New characters have been introduced, and the storyline changes, not always revolving around the main character.  The 'background' of England going through changes after the war adds to the story, it shows the growth of socialized medicine in England, the good and the bad.  If you like mystery and surprises, this is not for you--it is not very 'deep'.  I do not sit on the edge waiting for the next episode, and for me, in this series it is just what I want--simple stories, mostly 'feel good', but always feeling real.

5623876,5,B00BIR2A3E,I've been saying for decades now.... why so many war movies and tv shows about killing?  Why so few shows about having babies?  Women have them every day but for us having a baby can be a live and death matter and surely it is as important to women as fighting is to men.  This show is not only about the battle of reproduction but also about the battle for reproduction rights.  It doesn't take sides but it is clearly compassionate and informative.  And I love the characters.  I hope they will make dozens of series.  The only thing that was mildly disappointing is that the first season only had 6 shows and this 2nd season only had 8.  So many shows have 20+ shows per season.... it seems like the really good television dramas are always short on episodes.,1376179200,,762,4.392857142857143

5623878,5,B00BIR2A3E,"I had heard that this was a good show, but was a little hesitant because of the name.  I didn't think I would be that interested in a show based on the home delivery of babies. How wrong I was, the show takes place in the 1950's with a group of young nurses who live in a convent and help the sisters deliver the babies of the east London residents, but the show is more about the girls friendship and relationships than about the delivery of babies.  Also Vanessa Redgrave as narrator is a joy to listen to. Give it a try!",1376179200,,523,4.117647058823529

5623894,5,B00BIR2A3E,"First of all I want to say that British television is absolutely spot on ( as they would say) when it comes to original series and excellent acting.  I have enjoyed so many - Upstairs Downstairs, Bleak House, Forsythe Saga, Bramwell and the more recent Doc Martin and Call the Midwife.  I feel ashamed of the sort of shows that we produce in America.  There have been some excellent sit-coms but they were all in the past.  Mary Tyler Moore, Dick Van Dyke, That Girl, All in the Family and others.  But now, we are treated to Duck Dynasty and  Honey Boo Boo and the like.  What must the Brits think of us!!  I am a loyal citizen but I cannot help but feel embarassed by our current television entertainment.

Now, about Call the Midwife.  I have watched every episode over and over and the thing that touches me the most is the nuns and their incredible faith.  Sister Julienne is such an amazing woman.  She is kind and caring but firm when it comes to patient care.  I have found myself looking for a stronger faith and feel changed since watching the series and these strong Catholic Nuns.

I also love Miranda Hart, Chummy!  She isn't a nun but her strength comes from her faith in God and to me it is obvious that she has found her true calling as well as true love with Peter.  Miranda Hart has done an incredible job portraying her.  I love all the characters in the show.  The acting is superb.  I have read the book as well and I am sorry to say that these two series have covered most all of the stories in the book and so I guess there will not be a series 3.  But one can hope that some excellent writers out there will be able to come up with ideas that would reflect the feeling of post war London and the East end.  There must be thousands of stories to be told.

Thank you Amazon for making this (and other) programs available online.  Carry on!!!!!",1376092800,6,1865,4.265714285714286

Season two picks up where the first one left off, with the nurses and nuns delivering the babies of Poplar, London. The acting is brilliant, especially the birthing scenes. I'm glad they didn't try and sugar-coat those, or any of the poverty.
The series handles difficult topics such as abortion, prostitution, and death wonderfully. In the first episode, a girl gives birth in an abandoned building, thank goodness she didn't kill it, like I thought. In the third memoir, Mrs. Worth says there weren't any abandoned babies at Nonnatus. Kirsten, the captain's daughter, gives birth on a ship, attended by Nurse Franklin and Sister Evangelina. In the book, Nurse Chummy does it alone. And Sister Bernadette doesn't marry a doctor. These differences do not stop me from enjoying the show, however. It's still a good show, and I'm looking forward to season 3.",1375574400,,968,4.837349397590361

5623926,5,B00BIR2A3E,"After the introduction to the series last year, I didn't think it could be topped, but with it's sometimes gritty, always touching stories Call the Midwife, Season Two has proven the series has staying power. It's easy to see why Call the Midwife is so popular in the States and abroad. Stories of sisterly bonds among friends and the miracle of childbirth never get old.

Following the life of young midwife, Jenny Lee, this series is set barely a year following her arrival at Nonnatus House in London's East End. Judging by the title you may guess that this is a series about midwifery but it is so much more. From episode to episode, there are a variety of themes from poverty, to love to faith, family, and friendship. The stories have a nostalgic feel but each episode has themes that are relevant to this day. While there IS a lot pertaining to maternity care and nursing and the hardships that come with it, there's always an unflagging sense of hope.

Each of the characters, the nurses, the nuns, and the residents of the East End; have their own special charms which are brought to life by a fine cast including veteran actors Jenny Agutter, Pam Ferris, and a personal favorite, Stephen McGann. Jessica Raine is a brilliant actress. It has been a joy to see what she brings to the role of Nurse Lee in each episode. She plays the competent, confident midwife well. She's evolved from the rather innocent and naive girl in season one. Having seen her in other brilliant roles outside of Call the Midwife (Doctor Who, etc.) she's fast becoming one of my favorite young actresses.

While the series centers around Jenny Lee, my favorite character by far is Camilla Cholomondley-Browne -- also known as Chummy. She provides brilliant comic relief. Kind of uncomfortable in her own skin in the first season, it's lovely to see her come out of her shell and bloom while still keeping her ever present sense of humor. Actress Miranda Hart truly brings Chummy to life in all the best ways. For Chummy, this second series represents more than just a changes that affect her life and Constable Noakes's life but also huge changes for all at Nonnatus House. There was more than a couple romances that unfolded, one being a total shock! Since I'm such a hopeless romantic, it did my heart good to see all the love in the air.

There is so much more to this series than I ever expected. It's drama, it's heartache but also about laughter and finding one's true calling. All in all, this series is unbeatable and refreshing in every way. With three additional episodes, including a Christmas special, up from last years six episode tally, this series is sure to please fans of the show and hopefully bring new fans on board. If you enjoy ""extras"", the Blu-ray and DVDs feature fun cast interviews and stories about how the series came to be and the best part -- 10 additional minutes per episode that didn't air in the US! This series is a must own for British TV fans and anyone looking for a superb, feel-good show to add to their DVD collection.

I thought that there would be more tragedy considering it was dealing with childbirth in the late 50's in a poverty stricken area of London, but it is a very pleasant series to watch.  It dealt very cordially with different subjects and issues.  The reason I am giving it a 4 star rating is that I had to use Closed Caption to watch as the accent was a bit thick, but that was through no fault of theirs, they ARE British!!!!",1374624000,,518,4.255102040816326

When you just cannot imagine a character played by any other actor, you know he or she is perfect for the part, but how often can that be said of practically every actor in the show?  The second season of BBC's ""Call the Midwife"" brings many changes and surprises to the friends of Nonnatus House, but the tone of the show remains the same.  Any fan of the first season will thoroughly enjoy the second; if you've never watched this gem of a show, buy the first series (season) first.

5623945,5,B00BIR2A3E,This really a great show. I can hardly wait for next season. I love the fact that you learn so much about what it was like to be a woman in the 1950's while sharing the girls lives. I had heard of the work houses in England but this show really shows you the reality of it. The episode where the woman went for an illegal abortion really hit home because i live in NC. and the legislature here is trying to limit women's access to abortions here.,1374537600,,446,4.079545454545454

5623949,5,B00BIR2A3E,"I adored the first season of Call the Midwife.  I was a bit concerned that season two might fall short, but it did not!

We're back with Jenny, Chummy, and the rest of the gang as they deliver babies and other primary care to London's poorest working class members.

The squalor, the question of birth control, the romances, and of course, the women giving birth all make for riveting storytelling.  And the cast is as superb as ever.  I can't but wonder if these actors auditioned for Downton Abbey and were turned down?  Well, I say it all worked out for the best as I can't imagine anyone else in his or her respective role on either series.

My mother loves watching the series as well, as she was in London during part of the time referenced in the series.  I often turn to her ask questions such as, did people really leave their babies in their prams outside?  Yes, they did.  Quite a different world!

I have always loved English television drama, but this has got to be one of the best. Every character is real and lovable in their own way, and every situation draws you in on a deep level.  It is not for everyone, as the birth scenes, while tastefully done, are quite realistic.  There are also some situations, such as domestic abuse and prostitution, which are part of the reality that this show conveys.  Another aspect of this show that I love is that the nuns of Nonnatus House are respectably devout without being preachy or self-righteous.  Their faith is genuine, and their devotion to helping even the most despicable people is apparent.  Every episode is heartwarming and inspiring.

Unfortunately the preview on that disc couldn't be more different from the inspiring Call the Midwife subject matter. The film advertised is obviously super sleaze with little story and lots of nudity (and it's a long preview).

I don't know if their servers were overwhelmed by usage or were just not working, but their feed to me while viewing my last episode could not keep up.

5624024,5,B00BIR2A3E,"Arriving in stores today on DVD & Blu-ray is the critically acclaimed BBC series Call the Midwife: Season Two. The series is created & written by Heidi Thomas, which is based on the memoirs (Call the Midwife, Shadows of the Workhouse, and Farewell to the Eastside) by the late Jennifer Worth.

Call the Midwife is set in the poverty-stricken East London in the 1950's, where Jenny Lee (played by Jessica Raine), works at the Nonnatus House, a convent that serves as a hospital for the poor. Along side her are her fellow nurses Trixie, Cynthia, Chummy, and the Sisters, Julienne, Evangelina, Bernadette and Monica Joan, who are all midwifes, but attend to other medical situations that occur around the poor neighborhoods.

Season two brings many more challenges to the midwives as each patient comes with their own problems which eventually become the midwives' problems. Nurse Chummy and her husband PC Noakes head off to Africa for missionary work, but they later return with life changing news. Sister Monica Joan's age is quickly catching up with her. Sister Bernadette has a health crisis as she struggles with her feelings for Dr. Turner. Jenny's best-friend, Jimmy, is getting married, which stirs past feelings for her.

  Midwifery Adaptation & Detail

I loved watching the first season last year on DVD and I eagerly watched the Christmas Special on PBS back in December, but I missed out on watching the eight episodes of season two, mostly due to a family emergency. I was looking forward to watching the Call the Midwife: Season Two DVD, which I received free of charge from BBC Home Entertainment in exchange for my honest review.

I never would have thought a television show about midwives would be interesting to me, but just like season one, I was hooked from the very first episode, which each one plays out more like a mini-movie. The cast is excellent, all giving wonderful performances; even the guest-stars are great. Heidi Thomas has creatively brought Jennifer Worth's memoirs to life. I highly recommend Call the Midwife: Season Two to everyone.",1371513600,2,2268,5.013440860215054

Nothing is out of place, life has its imperfections, and once in a while one of the babies doesn't survive. I recommend this to any viewer.",1371081600,,304,4.545454545454546
5624028,5,B00BIR2A3E,So glad a friend recommended it to me. It shows life is not always peaches and cream. Also gives a new prespective on the invention of birth control.,1371081600,,149,4.357142857142857

5624034,5,B00BIR2A3E,"In my opinion, I much prefer Call the Midwife for its uplifting story line.  Each story told has its ups and downs, but the strength of the human spirit and all that the women of the East End went through is amazing.  We are so spoiled, and I don't think many of us could make it in the conditions of the 1950's tenement housing.",1370736000,,329,4.125

5624039,5,B00BIR2A3E,"What makes this series so wonderful is not just the evocation of a not-long bygone era but the three-dimensionality of all the characters. Like the best of drama, the nuns and nurses and others have become virtual members of the family.",1370649600,,236,4.780487804878049

5624050,5,B00BIR2A3E,"Well written, well played, it's a wonderful story of midwife nurses in the late 50s in London's East End..  While London is still righting itself from WWII, the East End was probably the toughest part of it.  Every character in this story - and I mean every character - is likeable.  How nice it is, to watch a show and care about them all.  There isn't another show on television,  be it network, cable or PBS, which, this one is,  that is as good as this one,  Although it's a British production, it's none of that Downton Abbey snobbery.  It's real, and I just love this show.  It touches my heart.  And I can't wait for Season 2 to come out so I can watch it all again as I have Season 1.",1370476800,,692,4.135338345864661

5624054,5,B00BIR2A3E,Love the girls and the nuns and the action. It is a look into a time so far away but so close to our hearts. Birth is hard and took a strong team.,1370390400,,146,3.4545454545454546
5624055,5,B00BIR2A3E,By comparison the quality of British television programing is is vastly superior to  US TV (mostly stupid reality shows and some bad comedy series). This series is one of the best current British TV offerings. Fred Friendly had it right years ago when he called American TV a vast wasteland.,1370390400,,291,4.82
5624056,5,B00BIR2A3E,"I am a doula (childbirth coach) and I loved this not only because it is related to my passion of being present at the moment of birth but also because it addresses the issues of those impoverished by lack of education, religious interference in their choices about family size, and the rich cultural heritage in these lesser known areas of London during the 1950's.  I also enjoyed it because even as these stories were taking place, the dawning of a new era was imminent - the arrival of the birth control pill - that altered the lives of many women and their families.  I thought the casting was superb! and I just loved every moment of each episode.",1370390400,,652,4.516949152542373

 stories are finely woven in and around the Midwives lives in the 1950's and the challenges they face both in their private and

I have read the books by Jennifer Worth and loved them. If you loved this series I really suggest you read the books. There is so much more to the stories and they give you quite an education as to what life was really like for the generations of families of the East End in those days and in the the times before. There is an entire book on how the workhouses affected the people of this area. If you think of the story of Frank and Peggy (Season 1) and how the workhouse affected them this book gives you a real insight as to how the people were treated and what life was like for them while they were in the workhouse and what happened to them when they were released. And imagine the contrast between the East End and areas like it  to the privilege of the Royal Family and the wealthy. The ""times"" of ""Downton Abbey"" comes to mind.  I so admire the women and men that made the changes in care for the families of the East End and all of England where poverty affected their health care.

My one issue with the show is that there is a bit of what I call revisionist history in there. A catholic convent where you hardly hear a reference to God or faith?  An episode in which a self induced abortion attempt is seen as heroic in that time period?  In spite of this and a bit more, the show redeems itself because it is just so darned heart warming and well done. I love it.",1369440000,,515,4.34375

5624108,5,B00BIR2A3E,"I have loved this series since the first episode and hope it continues. The characters are believable and it covers
a period in British history I wasn't familiar with. It is heartwarming to see the young midwives begin as inexperienced
women and gain confidence in their skills.",1369267200,,278,4.9361702127659575

5624110,5,B00BIR2A3E,There are a few racy spots in this series and lots of sad moments in the lives of the east end of London folks but there is so much heart-felt care given to each patient and the nurses are so full of personality.  The nuns - I absolutely love each one of them.  You must watch this series if you like British shows and the medical field.,1369180800,,337,4.014925373134329
5624111,5,B00BIR2A3E,"Never have I seen a TV series with this much raw power and emotion. The characters develop so that you fall in love with each. This is one of the few instances where one can say, the show is better than the book. The characters are better drawn. The humor is on mark and provides much needed comic relief. If you can get past the screaming, groaning, and grunting that is a part of childbirth, this show is sure to engage you in a way few others have the capacity.  Recreating London in the 1950s is done so well, I feel like I know it as well as Dicken's time or that during the American civil war, created by Bruce Alexander in his Blind Justice series of books. Watched entire 1st season on Netflix, then purchased each new episode on Amazon. I truly hope they continue the series, but it looks bleak, sorry to say.

For much the same reason, I absolutely love this series, Call the Midwife.  Hearing the music, the different traffic sounds and the east end accents with the more polished of the nuns and nurses completely transports me back in time, making it a most satisfying and warm television viewing experience.",1368921600,6,480,4.714285714285714

I was a newly graduated registered nurse, working labor and delivery at my training hospital in the early 1960s.  The parallels (Lutheran Deaconess Hospital and School of Nursing, in the USA, rather than nuns in Britain) are so similar that it reinforces my gratitude over being born when I was.  Life was so much more real, back then.  I'm not sorry for today's streamlined technology that helps to save lives, but I fear we have lost some of the personal-touch humanity revealed through this midwife's memoirs.  I simply love this story, and would welcome more of it.",1368921600,32,648,4.758928571428571

The show is about life in the 50's, and it shares intimate moments from peoples lives without being over the top Hollywood. I believe we should pay more attention to the great shows coming out of England, with all the money being thrown around in the theaters here we produce very little greats any more.",1368835200,5,464,4.470588235294118

And I was sad when I ran out of new episodes to watch.  (Although the new season is on PBS as I type this in May 2013.)  I can't speak to how authentic it is although I suspect most of it is based in fact -- with the exception of the maternity clothes.  Somehow I doubt everyone in the 50s wore clothes that showed their pregnant bellies.  IIRC, from photos in the family albums, pregnant mothers wore something that looked like super-sized tents.  I think that is the only thing that bothers me when I watch.  I'm a stickler for clothing authenticity.  However, that small point shouldn't really detract from the overall content of the show which is quite fascinating.  The characters are honest and real and they make you CARE about them.  The stories are always emotionally engaging and I admit to shedding more than a few tears over some of the stories.  Don't know what to watch this weekend?  Try this series.  You'll be glad you did.",1368144000,,1087,4.424242424242424

But the characters are as quirky as cynthias goofy bangs, they make it impossible to change the channel. Also they balance the happy and the sad wonderfully. Like that they deal with what is like to deal with a person with dementia on a regular basis. Both from their view and ours. It is written extremely well. I liked when the vicar and jane where talking about why he talks so much and she is almost mute. Also when the girls try to find little things for Sister Monica Joan to do so she will feel useful and not get herself into mischief. There is a theme for every episode and all the characters seem to be dealing with it some way each week. And the plots are really unique and inventive like the twins married to the same dude who end up with twins. And the swedish ship captain's daughter having a baby on a ship. And the lady who is actually pretty quiet while she gives birth and wants her dying father to meet her son. The music and the bright colors contrasts beautifully with the drab slummy part of England where the ladies work as midwives. May have to check out season one.",1367193600,,1179,4.1982378854625555

5624173,5,B00BIR2A3E,"Our entire family watches ""Call the Midwife;"" we all love the series! It shows the East End's gritty side, while somehow also capturing the hope and love of a rapidly evolving community just after WWII and up to the 60s. You can see reality sink in when these idealistic, nurse midwives arrive at the convent where they'll be working. They're hit with the reality of young, poor families grappling with one pregnancy after another; elderly shoved into flea and rat-infested tenements; girls forced into prostitution.

Gradually, the nurse-midwives become members of the community, not just witnesses of its challenges. That's when the fun begins!

5624185,5,B00BIR2A3E,"Never thought I would find a series about midwifery to my liking, but I was wrong.  The way they have crafted this production based on a true account is genius.  The character development and the acting is first rate.  I like all the characters, particularly Jenny.

I purchased Season 2 because I had missed some early episodes and now I am up to date.",1366761600,,353,4.46875
5624186,5,B00BIR2A3E,I enjoy this show as a study break from law school. It has a great story line and is pleasant to watch.,1366761600,,103,3.727272727272727
5624187,5,B00BIR2A3E,"It is the most real television that has been on in years. It is a touching, lovely piece on women and babies and what both go through in childbirth, before and after. What a wonderful memoir Jenny kept and how lucky are we to be able to see it on the screen! The historical accuracy is also amazing in East End, London! On every level it is a fabulous show and will re-watch over and over! I can't wait for more!",1366761600,,412,4.098765432098766
5624188,4,B00BIR2A3E,"I'm addicted to this show.  Most of the stories are derived from Jennifer Worth's books on her experiences as a nurse and midwife. Some address issues of the day, like the lingering effects of the workhouses, but many touch on issues still relevant today.  All will pull on your heartstrings.  The series does a good job of blending humor with drama, though, so you will laugh as much as you cry.",1366588800,5,396,4.549295774647887

5624191,5,B00BIR2A3E,"If you nursed in South Africa or Europe, it brings back so many memories. Amazing to learn how these women without the technology and advances to so what hey did. Unfortunately, all nurses today do not get the respect and admiration they deserve!",1366329600,,246,4.744186046511628
5624192,5,B00BIR2A3E,"Truly entertaining and educational - uplifting because it is based on the actual experiences of a real midwife.  If we had programming like this available to all ages - to replace even 20% of the mindless, totally unbelievable, murder and other negative, destructive behaviors the base side of humans are capable of, the world would take a turn for the better.  If you want to positively impact the conscious evolution of the human species, programs such as ""Call the Midwife"" will promote the effort.  Thank you.",1366329600,9,513,4.941860465116279

5624196,5,B00BIR2A3E,Season 1 and so far season 2 are fantastic.  Takes place in England after the war and the midwife works with the nuns to deliver babies.,1366156800,,136,4.230769230769231
5624197,5,B00BIR2A3E,"This is one of the best of all BBC productions since I began watching Masterpiece Theater in the 1970s.  Although I had zero previous interest in the work of midwives and what I had envisioned the birth process to be, observing the work of these skillful, brave ladies in the face of life and death decisions has been fascinating and uplifting.  The acting and writing have been first rate.  Also of interest is the depiction of the first decade of the National Health Service in the UK where many health care services were finally available to people of modest means and the poor.  The selfless dedication of the men and women who made this new system work is finally being recognized.  --  The main criticism I have is that the dvd for the USA won't be released until late June -- several months after it started airing on PBS.",1365897600,39,829,4.530201342281879

Thanks Joy",1365811200,,126,4.291666666666667
5624201,5,B00BIR2A3E,"I really enjoyed midwives season one! This is not just a show about having babies lol. It is deep and emotional, and shows a glimpse back in time when women really showed what strength was (opinion). I will say the 1st episode of the second season had me a little, well very uncomfortable, but that was mostly the shock of the plot and if you watch it you will know what I mean. In this 1st episode, I will say, the midwife characters did a great job with love and understanding. A lot better that I would have done! I hope episode 2 is a bit more light hearted!",1365811200,,562,4.165137614678899
5624202,5,B00BIR2A3E,"My wife and I became fans of this show by watching season 1 on DVD.  Season 2 continues on with the heart rending stories about life in the poor side of London in the 1950's.  This series is based on a book by Jennifer Worth about her real life experiences in east London after the war.  The series is filled with drama, suspense with storylines that contain love and sadness mixed in together.

One of the unique parts of the show is the set of young midwife nurses living with nuns at the Nonnatus House.  It is a clash of cultures and generation gaps that is comedic and entertaining.  Season 2 starts off with a culture and age clash between Trixie Franklin and one of the older nuns.  They are kept busy dealing with all of the children being born and in trying to provide the best conditions and health benefits that can be made available to the mothers and new born children.

I love the role of Nurse Jenny Lee played by Jessica Raine and of Chummy Browne played by Miranda Hart.  The acting in the series is just outstanding and the storyline is rich with culture and history.  The settings and background for the show are just perfectly done.  We find it entertaining and enjoyable to watch.  It is one of our favorite series to watch on TV.

Season 2 is every bit as good as Season 1 and the season kicks off with a distressing set of births in the first episode that set the stage for the rest of the season.  I don't want to spoil it but be assured that if you liked Season 1 then this season will be just as enjoyable for you.

My wife and I rate it as 5 stars.",1365552000,22,1575,4.2207357859531776

5624204,5,B00BIR2A3E,"I started watching this series online and from the first scene I have been hooked.  I have started watching Season 2 and am totally crazy about Jessica Raine.  She is undoubtedly one of the most talented and beautiful newcomer to come along in a while.  You don't usually see a performer with that Deborah Kerr quality, however, she does have it.",1365465600,2,346,4.639344262295082
5624205,4,B00BIR2A3E,I would advise you to upgrade to the HD version for the better picture quality...it is definitely worth the extra dollar.,1365465600,,121,4.809523809523809
5624206,5,B00BIR2A3E,"The British do a great job of telling simple stories.  They have a way of understating their acting with real believable actors. Chummy is fantastic in this series she is not beautiful as Kate Beckett in Castle on American tv but she is a great heroin tough, brave real.  American tv is filled with reality crap we are migrating away from American tv.",1365292800,,351,4.555555555555555
