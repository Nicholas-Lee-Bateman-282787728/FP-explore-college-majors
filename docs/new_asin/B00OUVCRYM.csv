6764580,5,B00OUVCRYM,"I like movies that are outside the norm. Ones that play on societies flaws but do it in a way that is not obvious or overdone. This movie met that criteria fully.
We meet Warren, a very sweet ice cream man. He is socially awkward and painfully aware of it. As life slowly strips away at his humanity, we witness it. You know things are going to go off the rails but you just are not sure exactly when. When it happens it is almost poetic. The metaphor of the ending is raw and beautifully ugly.
I can say I enjoyed this movie thoroughly. The quirky nature of the characters were played very well by the actors and the unraveling of the plot was methodical and odd.
I highly recommend it for anyone who is not just after slash and gash horror, but enjoys the nature of a well acted (and very weird) mental oddity of a movie.",1466726400,2,823,4.215189873417722
6764581,4,B00OUVCRYM,"Wow this was a very strange bizarre movie. Finally got a release here in the USA. This came out a few years ago in Australia. The main character was incredibly creepy and played the role well. Basically about an ice cream man that goes nuts and is obsessed with an actress he watches on tv. I really enjoyed the music in this one too, great soundtrack. I would definitely recommend, its on Amazon Prime as well. 4/5",1466035200,,415,4.402597402597403

8685065,3,B00OUVCRYM,"This review is for the Blu-Ray edition of 'Chocolate, Strawberry, Vanilla' released by Wild Eye Releasing in 2017.

'Chocolate, Strawberry, Vanilla' is an Australian production that was made in 2014.

I wanted to give this movie a higher rating and it wasn't that far away from being a 5 star release. But a few things end up detracting from the release and I end up with a 3 star rating.

PLOT: The story is quite simple but nevertheless it is interesting. Warren is a lonely bachelor with a relatively low IQ but is not mentally retarded. He has his own business, an ice cream truck that he parks in the same place in a seedy neighborhood every day. At the open of the movie, he accidentally runs over his cat. He is tremendously distraught and continues to leave food for the cat every day. Warren also develops an obsession with an actress, Katey George, who stars in a local TV serial or soap opera. He looks forward to each and every episode. One day the actress shows up at his truck and shows up sporadically thereafter. Warren also has a problem with a local drug dealer/pimp who works across the street from where he parks his ice cream truck. The drug dealer beats on Warren and takes ice cream whenever wants. Warren seems to get along with a girl named Ruby who works at a local store he frequents. Warren never makes a move on her and continues with his obsession over Katey George. One day he learns that Ruby has been let go. Katey shows up at his truck and tells him she won't be shooting in the area anymore. Warren asks her out to dinner and she accepts. She tells him to show up at the studio after work one day and they will go out. Warren shows up and Katey behaves much differently and doesn't know who Warren is. We now know Warren is not just simple but is psychologically disturbed. After this incident he returns home and goes over the edge.

THOUGHTS: If you didn't know that this movie was kind of like a horror/psychological thriller type of story before you watched it, you might think it was meant to be more of an inspirational story. At least for the first half of it.  Just the cover art would let you know all is not well. Also a few other things which I will elaborate on just below would let you know otherwise.

Warren is a sad almost tragic figure. You root for him in much the same way you root for a 'dweeb' or a 'nerd' in a teen drama. He is hopelessly lonely (at least he thinks he is) and gets picked on as an adult much the same way he was picked on as a kid.
In reality, the movie offers him a few chances  at curing his loneliness. A mom stops by his ice cream truck and recognizes Warren. She was the first girlfriend he ever had. She appears to flirt with him but Warren doesn't take the bait. We don't know if she is divorced or single but the movie seems to imply that she is waiting for him to ask her out. Ruby, a cashier at a local store that Warren frequents, is overly nice to Warren. She is fairly attractive and once again, he doesn't make a move. Warren seems to care about Katey George only. Also, Warren does not replace his cat. Getting a new cat would be an obvious way to relieve some of his loneliness.

We are never really sure if the actress is showing up or he is imaging her appearances until much later in the movie. Once again, if we didn't know this was a horror movie we would have no reason to think otherwise.

Let me be clear here, I am far from what you would call prudish. Nor would I claim never to have never watched pornographic material. I felt that some of the scenes in this movie were gratuitous. I felt that it really wasn't necessary to depict multiple scenes of masturbation. Once was good enough to get the picture. I get it, he is lonely and sexually repressed. We see him wake up with his flagpole up. We see him reading adult magazines. We see him grab his Vaseline every time he watches tv. We certainly didn't need to see him 'squirt' on his TV set. If this was a pornographic film or a movie about sex addicts I could understand this, but in this movie it is out of place. It is inconsistent with the rest of the movie as there are no real sex scenes. This is not an X-rated film or anything even close. If they cut out just a few of these minor scenes or just toned them down this movie could be rated pg-13.
Also, was it really necessary to show Warrens private's flopping around in the final seconds of the movie? I could have done without being left with this final image at the end of an otherwise pretty good movie. They could have just given us a shot from behind or the waste up.
Once again, I am not one to complain about nudity or sex scenes in movies, but the older I get the more ridiculous some of these scenes are. When I was a younger man, movies were specifically made to contain nude scenes in order to generate a bigger audience. I get that. But today, where any person can see all the nudity or pornography they want with just a phone, tablet or computer it is mostly unnecessary.

The cover is a pretty impressive piece of art. I just don't like the way Warren is depicted. It shows him in with an obviously 'evil' look. It gives the appearance that this movie is straight horror. But really it is a tragic story and doesn't turn horrific until the final minutes of the movie.
I feel like this movie would be more shocking and leave more of an impression if you didn't know from the get go that Warren was going to be evil.
But I get it....if you want sales you need to let me people know what they are buying.

RECOMMENDATIONS: I'm recommending this movie for most fans of horror/psychological drama. It is an interesting movie. It movies slowly for awhile but nevertheless it keeps you interested.
I would rate this 3 1/2 stars if I could or a 7/10.
I would have bumped it up a notch if not for the scenes I describe above. Also it could have gotten another star if there had been some extra's. There aren't any. If there had been a commentary or a making of documentary I would give it another star. Take away the masturbation scenes and I'd bump it another half star. Then you would have a 5 star release.",1512691200,,6125,4.271551724137931
8685066,3,B00OUVCRYM,Just be aware this movie is nothing like what it is described in the blurb. It's an ok movie about a man that has a complete breakdown. I probably would give this a 2.5.,1480032000,,169,4.0
8685067,4,B00OUVCRYM,It's a slow burn for sure. But any man's journey into madness will be. Great movie with a great story. Kind of the Taxi Driver for the modern age.,1479772800,,146,4.068965517241379

8685073,4,B00OUVCRYM,Pretty good flick. Not as scary as I would have liked. More of a psychological horror in a sense than a scary horror.
