2581308,4,B000FP7MHO,"A tale of teen (or rather pre-teen) love. In a very traditional school in England (where corporal punishment is still practiced), a boy and a girl (both about twelve) fall in love. Relatively realistic during most of its running time, during the final twenty minutes it falls into anarchist fantasy, as the children in the school thwart the attempts of the parents and the school masters to prevent their elopement and marriage. Unlike other people, I didn't watch this as a child: it's not filtered by childhood memories, so I think I can judge it better as a movie. It's a good romantic story, sometimes demagogic, sometimes overwrought in its criticisms of traditional England, but it's still irresistible. The actress playing the girl, the beautiful Tracy Hyde, is fantastic (unfortunately, and despite her obvious talents, she never became a major star) The screenplay was by Alan Parker (the director was the unknown Waris Hussein, who would never made a major movie again). There is a great soundtrack, mostly by the Bee Gees, but the best song is probably is ""Teach the Children"" by Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young. The fine color photography is sometimes reminiscent of a 70s commercial, but it also let you see the ravishing London of almost forty years ago (one of the best scenes have the young lovers skipping school and sightseeing around the English capital). A relative failure in England and the United States when released, this nevertheless became a huge hit in Latin America and the Far East (specially, Japan). Incredibly, this movie has been very seldom shown in television, and the DVD is unavailable in many countries (including the US).",1215302400,5,1660,4.996389891696751

2581311,5,B000FP7MHO,"Melody is a film about two 10 year school children who fall in love, then face constant adult opposition, as well as nonstop harassment from the other children. The two main characters, Daniel Lattimer (Mark Lester) and Melody Perkins (Tracy Hyde) are seeking someone to love and to provide companionship. Daniel is largely ignored by his trendy, upper middle class parents, while Melody longs for something other than her existence in a poor, lower end housing project. The story is a tender, sweet story of innocent love between two children, backed by a great music track by the pre-disco BeeGees. It contains no objectionable language, no sexual content, and no violence. Melody is a thoroughly entertaining film, one which will grab your attention from the opening, and hold it throughout the movie. This reviewer would give it 10 stars and a thumbs-up.",1194566400,13,858,5.049295774647887

The Bee Gees songs are good for the most part, and the inclusion of Crosby, Stills & Nash's ""Teach Your Children"" was a perfect coda.",1466985600,3,432,4.280487804878049

2581352,5,B000FP7MHO,"I'm not reviewing the DVD product so much as I'm reviewing the film itself. 1971's Melody is one of the most uplifting British youth love stories out there. It's very much a film from the early 70s, and one of the most unique things about it is that the story is told from kid's point of view rather than through the parents and teachers, which was very unusual for a film of that time. In that respect, the movie on many levels deals with rebellion against the older generations.

On a side note, this film seems to be virtually unavailable/know in the US, but for some reason was a hit in several non-English speaking countries.

The story concerns two 11-year-old English school children, Melody Perkins (Tracy Hyde), and Daniel Latimer (Mark Lester, of ""Oliver"" fame), who meet and instantly fall for each other. Much to the dismay of their teachers and parents, the young lovers spend alot of time together, even to the point of skipping school and going to a seaside amusement park. They both then decide to get married. With the help Daniel's friend Ornshaw (Jack Wild, also of ""Oliver""), the couple is able to escape school again and have a ""wedding"" ceremony. All adults from the school find out, and attempt to stop it, which results in a final battle between the kids and the teachers. Ornshaw then helps Melody and Daniel escape on a railway car.

The soundtrack is filled throughout with music by the Bee Gees, with songs such as ""To Love Somebody"", ""Melody Fair,"" and ""First of May"", which add to the film's overall uplifting feeling.  Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young's ""Teach Your Children"" plays out the final scenes.

While some of the dialog and situations may be considered ""corny"", or unmemorable, the film nevertheless has a heart-warming plot with lovable characters, and a good example of British cinema from the 70s.",1342310400,,1839,4.770440251572327

The characters were kids I knew (maybe even kids I had been at that time in my life!) It is a movie that anyone who has been in love, but especially those who fell in love when they were younger, will identify with. It is not a perfect movie. But it still works. It is too bad that there hasn't been a major re-release with a quality video format for the US and Canada. The print available is scratchy and of poor quality.

Ok, now for my comments:

I first saw this movie soon after I finished school and was absolutely captivated by its charming story and brilliant music. This is probably the best soundtrack the Beegees ever made and that includes Saturday Night Fever. Teach Your Children remains among my top three CSNY songs (The other two are Judy Blue Eyes and Carry On).

I always wondered why I could never get a decent print of this movie and thanks to Canal that finally has happened. I wish they would remaster the soundtrack though, the mono track is a bit disappointing. But the picture is so sharp that I could feel my heart strings being tugged at all over again.

Lovers of the movie will rejoice, but I think there'a a whole generation out there who would discover the movie if it was marketed cleverly.

Finally, even after all these years, Tracy Hyde remains as lovely as she was all those years ago.

This may not be the best movie I have ever seen but it is certainly somewhere high on my list. Viewers from India would be interested to learn that the director is an Indian.",1297296000,4,1409,4.773662551440329

And there was one part, when Melody and Daniel are eating in the graveyard, that there is a big white line down the center of the screen. The sound quality wasn't very good, but I expected that, too. I'm a huge Jack Wild fan, so I don't really care about the quality as much as others might.
I don't know what this movie is rated but if you want if for a family movie, There are a few things you should be aware of: 1. some school boys (early in the film) look at some pornographic magazines. 2. A boy is also found by his mother painting naked women's torsos. 3. A group of boys are smoking outside briefly. 4. a group of girls talk about kissing. 5. a teacher asks a boy is he's been drinking. 6. a couple of boys try to get into a girl's restroom.

For someone who still holds a pretty big cult following, he has one of the worst DVD production rates of any former child actor. If I were him, I would buy all the prints of my films and release them myself. But, I digress, which leads me to this movie.

Truthfully, there is not much to this movie at all. Boy meets best friend, boy meets girl, boy and girl fall in love, best friend shows a brief flash of jealousy, boy and girl decide they want to get married, best friend marries them with the whole class watching. Along with this distinct lack of meaty plot comes a HORRIBLE DVD transfer which made me feel like I was watching an old kinescope on a bedsheet. Now, that would be the minuses. But you know something? I was utterly charmed from beginning to end and was certainly not sorry I bought it. It is an awesome little time capsule of working class London circa 1970, and seems to have been filmed with very few extras. Scenes at the beach and at a school athletics competition feature onlookers who seem to have been pulled in off the street, which adds a lot. Mark Lester is charming as usual, and Jack Wild, the Artful Dodger himself, is a riot at times playing the best friend as a cheeky boy who always gets into trouble. And then there is the soundtrack. I knew a few of the Bee Gees early songs, such as To Love Somebody and First of May, but this film also includes overlooked gems such as In the Morning and Give Your Best. Put simply, the movie would be worth buying for the soundtrack alone, but with Mark Lester along for the ride and a few amusing scenes here and there, it was well worth buying in my humble opinion.",1259366400,26,2048,4.2378516624040925
2581380,2,B000FP7MHO,"I got my eagerly anticipated copy of the DVD a few days ago, and I have to say that they did a really lousy job. From the amateurish packaging done by someone who knows nothing about graphic design to the printing on the disc which is merely labeled with a single word ""Melody"". That's nothing compared to the quality of the actual movie print though. I don't know where they dug up this print (somebody's dusty attic?), but it has really been through the ringer. It has scratches and marks that never completely go away, the colors are completely washed out, it's grainy, and the sound is not very sharp. Several splices are obvious. Besides this, the only extra is a ""slide show"" of grainy screen captures from the movie with lame dissolves between the pictures.

It is also FULL SCREEN. Beware!

The packaging says ""digitally remastered"" and ""enhanced audio"". I don't really see how this can possibly be true.

The ""unofficial"" copy I bought off eBay is much, much better quality, AND it's in widescreen format.

So it's a huge disappointment, but at least it is officially released now, people can easily get it, and more people will see it.

Maybe Criterion Collection will pick it up and do it right!",1258761600,47,1206,4.669811320754717
