Dont get me wrong its quite entertaining but your ready to move on, it finally starts picking up the pace towards the last epsiode, its still good, enjoy.",1009670400,,277,4.148148148148148
7874357,2,630458430X,"The fight between Vega(balrog in Japanese) and Ken were great in the Jap version. In the american dubbed one, they sound like high pitch people who are like surfer dudes and such. Whats worse *spoiler* when Ken gives the Shoryuken to Vega it sounds so retarded. In the Jap version, he sounds truly like a fierce rising dragon. Another bad thing is that the american dubbing will annoy the hell out of you with scenes like Bison(vega in Jap) choking Chun-Li. Whatever you do, just get the original version. American Version is not worth it.",982368000,,539,4.684210526315789
