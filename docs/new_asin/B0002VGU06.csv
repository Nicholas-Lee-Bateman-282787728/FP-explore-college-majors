2126399,5,B0002VGU06,I really enjoyed watching this DVD.  I loved Fraggle Rock when I was in school and never missed an episode.  It would be nice if more episodes would have been released on this DVD...we have to wait until Spring of 2005 for the next installment.  But still it's great that it's finally being released on DVD.  It's so much better than all the garbage that's out today.  It's actually educational and fun to watch!  As more Fraggle DVDs are released I will buy them!  Fraggles are so COOL!,1098662400,11,487,4.465909090909091

  The DVD is great. Only bad thing is its not the complete set. If it comes out as a Set, or just a few episodes at a time, I will purchase them. My kids love them.",1097280000,8,236,3.588235294117647
2126402,4,B0002VGU06,"This DVD first came out as a Wal-Mart exclusive that contains the first three episodes of the series, and a bonus episode of a Swiss claymation-style show called Pingu.  But this version will also include new extras like a featurette called ""Fraggle Songs: A 45 minute Musical History of Fraggle Rock"", plus an episode of the 1987 cartoon version of Fraggle Rock called ""The Great Fraggle Freeze"". All told, the features and the supplements are said to run 170 minutes together.

Personally I'd give this 5 stars, but I really want a season set.  Or even split season sets like Lost In Space.  At this rate we'll have 32 DVDs to buy...96 episodes.

The video is good as is the audio.",1095638400,90,683,4.6115702479338845
2126403,5,B0002VGU06,I just bought this today from a retail store and i must say its awesome. I have seen every episode of fraggle rock and consider it the best work Jim has ever done. I agree that it should be released as a season set but there are alot of old shows that need to be released that way. Fans unite we want more fraggle rock.,1095552000,11,319,3.923076923076923
2126404,5,B0002VGU06,"I also purchased this nearly a month ago from an online source and I LOVED my dvd.  I have many fraggle episodes on VHS tape, but would like a more cataloged and lasting copy to share with my own children one day.  I really hope that many more of these DVDs will start being produced.  You will love the DVD if you get it and if you are a Fraggle Rock fan you should get it to support the effort of other fraggle rock fans to have these hard copies!  :-D

2126405,5,B0002VGU06,I bought this DVD a couple weeks ago from another online source.  So I have watched it and must say it made me regress back to my childhood.  It was amazing watching the three episodes included on this DVD and actually enjoying them as much as I did when I was kid.  It was funny watching them and realizing much of the adult content as well.  But I guess that is the magic of the muppets!  Thank you Jim Henson!!!!  I just wish they would go for broke and release them as season DVD's.  I don't think they realize how many people want to buy this show in it's complete form.  *sigh*  Please hurry.,1094515200,14,598,4.175438596491228

Then, I saw this at Wal-Mart (the trial run version, Wal-Mart only).  I bought it (being very skeptical), and fell in love with the show all over again.  I saw the first 2 episodes for the first time, and that alone reignited my ""Fraggle Flame,"" what I call my love of Fraggle Rock.  In fact, I now have a Fraggle Rock poster in my dorm room and everytime I look at the poster, I think of my friends the Fraggles.",1128902400,9,601,4.182608695652174
2126487,4,B0002VGU06,"I was so happy to see some Fraggle Rock DVD's start popping out at Amazon. I grew up watching Fraggle Rock when I was younger on HBO and then again on reruns then they seemed to disappear into pop culture history. I even collected and still have all of the books. I just wished I had saved all the McDonald toys as well. This childhood favorite never grows old though it might with today's generation or those who haven't grown up to love and enjoy the works of the amazing, brilliant, and creative mind of Jim Henson.

The episodes included are the first episode where Uncle Traveling Matt discovers the human world (Outer Space) and leaves Fraggle Rock. We have a nice introduction to the Fraggle world and even the Gorgs and Marjory The Trash Heap. The second episode Wembley and the Gorgs, Wembley thinks he's a friend of the Gorgs until he realizes that he really belongs with The Fraggles. Let the Water Run is the third episode which features my favorite Fraggle Red.

It's really fun to watch extremely old episodes. If you watch carefully you can see the strings holding some of the puppets throughout the episodes. And of course I'm forgetting the loveable Doc and Sprocket the Dog who are the Fraggle's link to Outer Space, plus the very cute Doozers who also live in Fraggle Rock.

The only reason's I'm giving it four stars is I understand why a great majority of people today may not get the imagination of puppets and the world of Fraggle Rock. It's extremely old and that's very easy to see; however, that's why I love these DVD's. I love hearing the music and the credits all over again which brings me a lot of fun childhood memories. I would mainly recommend this and Dance Your Cares Away to very young children or fans who remember Fraggle rock!

I almost forgot to add there are cute extras throughout these DVD's. Such as the Fraggle Rock cartoons and Trivia Games!",1120608000,10,1888,4.56047197640118
2126488,4,B0002VGU06,"When I saw this DVD on the shelf I almost cried.  I have been wishing for years to see Fraggle Rock on DVD and I was not dissapointed. The quality and sound is great.  Some have complained of the quality of the image (Betacam) but it looks as it did 20 years ago, and that's how I like it.  It has three great episodes and some cool extras. The animated episode is a great bonus since I loved them as well.  Also the 50 minute compilation of Fraggle songs was a great surprise! That was one of my favorite VHS. I do wish they had included alternate languages and subtitles, but I assume those will come with the season DVD's.

For this new generation Fraggle Rock is a must. It is children's show that is not dumbed down. It gives deep messages of peace and friendship.

Fraggle Rock forever.",1117065600,12,792,4.281879194630872
2126489,1,B0002VGU06,Watched this DVD hoping to be entertained... but show was boring and unimaginative.  Not the best for kids.  Any parent wishing to introduce threir children to quaility entertainment or relive their youth should check out Kroft Superstars especially Land of the Lost.,1116547200,,267,5.333333333333333
2126490,5,B0002VGU06,"In my years as the webmaster for a popular 80's cartoons site, I've re-watched a lot of shows that I remember as a child.  A lot fall quite short of memories and expectations, and, while it's fun and satisfying to see them again, I put them aside and never watch them again.  I'm very happy to say this is not the case here.

When my husband and I sat down to watch it, I was excited, him skeptical.  He had barely ever seen any of it before and was expecting a regular puppet show.  By the beginning of the second episode, he was singing along to the theme and wanting more.  He even suggested going out to find the next DVD!  I wasn't disappointed, either.  This is the first show in ages that has lived up to my memories and then some.

And the extras.  We now turn on the Musical History extra while doing things like cleaning the house or making dinner so we can sing along.  You can't help but feel good when singing along with most of these songs.  As something of an 80's animation historian/collector, also having the animated episode in the extras is a big plus.  The animated show is actually rather good.  It's not quite as creative or voiced as well as the original show, but it's still darn good for a cartoon and makes a good extra.  There's also a Japanese clay animation short called Pingu.  Very cute and imaginative.",1116460800,5,1335,4.34412955465587
2126491,4,B0002VGU06,"It's about time this show came to DVD!  I remember watching this show when it was originally on HBO, and it used to be my favorite.  It gave me a reason to look forward to Monday nights when I would see a new episode.  Now my 3 1/2 year old son loves it, and I love watching it with him.

The show's main characters are Gobo (the leader of the group), Mokey (the poet), Wembley (Gobo's best friend, whose job is being the siren for the Volunteer Fire Dept), Boober (a superstitious worrywart) and Red (the athletic one).  Wembley and Red were always my favorites.  Wembley, because of his indecisiveness about everything and Red because of her supposed ""bravery"" (she chickened out trying to go into Outer Space by herself to get the umbrella so she could have water for her swimming show).

The first three episodes here are ""Beginnings"", ""Wembley and the Gorgs"", and ""Let the Water Run"" and are all from the first season.  I only gave this four stars because I would love it to have more episodes.  Oh, well.  I guess you can't have everything.

What I love most about the show is the idea behind it--that all creatures could live together (there are the Silly Creatures (humans), the Fraggles and the Gorgs).  Toward the end of the series run, they started to get along with each other--they didn't really do that in the beginning.  Doc didn't notice the Fraggles, the Gorgs were always trying to catch the Fraggles.

I only hope that there will be more DVD's to come soon!  I'll definitely buy them!  If you don't have them and are a fan of the Muppets, buy them.  You won't be sorry you did.",1113609600,2,1596,4.467128027681661
2126492,5,B0002VGU06,"When I saw the first and second dvds at Wal-Mart, I just could not resist.  I have always loved the Fraggles, and in fact, I still protected the old video tapes when my mother wanted to throw them away.  When she asked me why, I told her that I wanted them for whenever I had kids, which is true . . .

Artistic Mokey and paranoid medic Boober always were my favorites, as I thought Red and Gobo spent too much time shouting at each other and Wembley couldn't shout at anyone.  Still, they were great as a kid, and to my surprise, they're still a kick today.  I can't wait for the third.",1113350400,2,587,4.114035087719298

2126494,5,B0002VGU06,"This DVD has been on my wishlist since before it was even announced!  (I put a rare VHS episode on my wishlist and included a comment that I wanted to find a DVD collection).  I kept checking back Amazon and everywhere else for more Fraggles, and finally saw that the first DVD would be coming out and took just a fraction of a second to add it to my wishlist.  I've anxiously waited through get well soon's, holidays, and finally my birthday, but never got the DVD of my dreams.  Finally, the day after my birthday, I saw the disc at Target, and much to my surprise, a second volume too!  I begged and pleaded with my wife to get it and after promising her a Pirates! video game and my 1 year old son two Wiggles DVDs, I was allowed to get them BOTH (it ended up costing about $100, but worth every penny!).

Early the next morning, I cranked up the volume on the TV and introduced my son to the best TV series ever made.  We sang and danced in front of the screen until my wife yelled to turn it down, she was trying to sleep.  I could hardly imagine that anyone would want to sleep when the magic of the Fraggles was in action, but I did as requested and we sang quieter.

We had to spread it out over several days because my son isn't allowed to be a couch potato like daddy, and I just finished the last of this first disc.

The songs are as good as I remember, and I was surprised how many I've remembered after 20 years.  The characters are lovable... Gobo and Wembly, Boober, Red, and Mokey are the main characters, but there's also the Trash Heap, Uncle Travelling Matt, the Doozers, poor Sprocket the Dog, and all the rest of the menagerie.

Wembly used to be my favorite character, being so uncertain about everything, right down to which of his identical banana print shirts to wear, he makes you want to feel sorry for him.  But after watching these from a much more aged perspective, I think I'd have to vote for Mokey, the serene hippy-esque matron of the clique.  Her expressions are adorable when she's singing her wise advice, and then going off and taking it far too literally.

I got to the end of the three episodes, and decided I'd see what the bonus features had.  I'm rarely impressed by the bonus features on discs, but this was awesome.  The 'musical history' track is a whole 45 minutes or more of the best songs I do and don't remember all strung together with Matt's intros between.  I got to sing and dance till my feet were raw, my son was hungry and my dog was very confused.  All through, I was wishing I could copy this to a CD to play in the car.

After that, I tried the Pengo track, and am still puzzled by why it was there.  It was kinda cute in a slightly French humor sorta way.  No singing, no dancing, no muppets, no speaking, and almost no story.  Why was a short animated story about a penguin being a pest included on a Fraggle DVD?

The remaining track, an animated Fraggle episode (The Big Freeze) more than made up for that disappointment.  I expected a mini-episode, dumbed down for the Saturday morning crowd, but what I got was a full episode that felt and sounded much like the real shows.  The pace of the show was a little faster so they could cram even more story into it (apparently you can animate an action easier than you can make a puppet go through those same motions; Isn't physics a pain?).  Some of the voices sounded a little off but close, probably the original voice actors weren't available, but other than that it was an excellent episode, with a story I'd never seen before.

I have only a few minor complaints about this DVD.  The picture quality was a little low.  This could be because the tapes it was from were pretty old, or the show was never filmed in DVD quality (it's just puppets), or they tried to fit a bit too much content on the disc (I don't like to complain about that!).  Second, each episode didn't have the opening and closing credits.  I love that song so much I missed hearing it over and over again.  Third complaint, Wembly's banana tree shirt episode wasn't one of the episodes included.  I've waited 20 years to see my favorite episode, and I'm still waiting.  This rolls into my fourth and final complaint...  I want more episodes.",1106179200,49,4228,4.3346055979643765
2126495,5,B0002VGU06,"This show is pure magic.  From the muppetry, to the writing, to the songs, every element is magic.  This show is an excellent foundation for any child and was highly reccomended by child pschologists back in the day.  It really was high time for a DVD release. This first DVD gets the ball rolling with several plot and character establishing episodes, including the pilot.  Bonus features include a documentary about the music of Fraggle Rock, plus an episode of the 1987 animated version of the show.  It's a good a start for hopefully a larger collection of DVDS.  Volume 2 is scheduled for a Janurary 2005 release.  Do yourself and your children a favor and purchase this DVD.",1102464000,8,680,4.711864406779661
2126496,5,B0002VGU06,"I was so excited to find this at a local store, and can hardly wait to share it with my kids for Christmas.  My husband and I are considering breaking the seals to watch it before then!

Fraggle Rock encourages young children to use their imaginations, look at the world around them, and ask questions.  The variety of characters and catchy tunes makes for a show that I have to believe most children will love.  These are timeless in my opinion, but best for children 1-4 and their parents.

I will also purchase all of the DVDs that come out, but I think this one, ""Where it all began"" is a logical first step for an entirely new generation of fans that can be engaged in this series thanks to the DVD releases (some of us now refuse to buy videos).  An entire season worth of Fraggle Rock, to a child that's never seen it before, might be kind of overwhelming.  A few episodes at a time is the way most of us learned to love it, and I'll gladly share it with my children the same way!
