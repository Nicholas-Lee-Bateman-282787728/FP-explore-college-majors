They were fascinated by the work of Dale Chihuly. The video shows installations of his work and provides interviews as well.

8014666,5,B0001ME5AI,"In a devastating car accident in 1976, a young artist loses the use of one eye. In the years that follow, Dale Chihuly's talent for leading a team flourishes as he orchestrates glassblowing of a complexity previously unthinkable. His 2001 retrospective exhibition at the venerable Victoria and Albert Museum marks his triumphant return to London after years of study and development.

Set in 2001 at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, this film follows Dale Chihuly as he fulfills his lifelong dream of exhibiting at the V&A and sets up this stunning show. The exhibition begins inside the rotunda with an extraordinary Chandelier commissioned by the V&A. Moving into the Medieval Treasury, an exuberant Persian Pergola is displayed alongside a fascinating and educational survey of Chihuly's glass series and drawings. Finally, venturing outside into the Pirelli Garden, large, site-specific installations fill the grounds with vivacious colors.
