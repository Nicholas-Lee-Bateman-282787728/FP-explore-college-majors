8263204,5,B0016MJ6EM,Very fast shipping and my daughter loves it.  Cute.,1409529600,,51,4.666666666666667
8263205,5,B0016MJ6EM,"This is the best Sesame Street DVD in my opinion. Our 18 month old boy loves it and dances to the music. He also does the stretches with Bert and Ernie. They got a great cast of athletes for this one and isn't as dated as some of the other SS DVDs. If you're in the market for a new DVD, this is an excellent option.",1407974400,,316,3.803030303030303
8263206,5,B0016MJ6EM,"I bought this and other Sesame Street DVDs to send to my grandkids in Japan. Before I sent this one, I thought I'd go back in time and savour some Sesame Street. It was so hilarious and well-done that I probably enjoyed it as much as the kids! I would highly recommend this DVD. Funny, clever and adorable. ... Grandma G",1376784000,,320,4.262295081967213
8263207,5,B0016MJ6EM,This is one of my daughter's favorite dvd's.  It can brighten her mood when she is having a bad day.  It is fun and teaches math concepts without the child realizing they are learning such things.,1331942400,,196,4.416666666666667
8263208,5,B0016MJ6EM,Both my grandsons (2 1/2 & 3 1/2) love it.  The story has a great flow and pace is reasonably fast. Ernie and Bert hold the act together.,1331424000,4,137,3.892857142857143
8263209,5,B0016MJ6EM,"This is another great Sesame Street video. Nice messaging, catchy songs and great match for our sports loving household. It was one of the earliest ways my now three year old son and my husband began bonding over sports.",1320710400,,220,4.666666666666667
8263210,3,B0016MJ6EM,I have purchased several Sesame Street videos over the past year.  Our favorite is Bert and Erine Play on Word DVD because it is full of music skits and does not contain any scenes with people( my son prefers just watching the puppets). This video does not come close to be as entertaining. This video is still cute and my son will watch it but it does not capture his attention like the Play on Word DVD.,1304294400,,405,4.259740259740259
8263211,5,B0016MJ6EM,This is a great DVD.  My husband and I love this as well.  We find ourselves popping this in the DVD player over my son's other Sesame Street DVD's.  My son will only watch TV if one of us is watching with him so can throw in our two cents as well.  You can't go wrong with this one!,1246752000,2,283,3.7457627118644066
8263212,5,B0016MJ6EM,My son is almost two and he loves watching this video almost every night while he gets ready for bed.  He loves all of his favorite Sesame Street characters as well as the variety of sports depicted throughout the film. An added bonus?  It's funny for Mom and Dad too!  The scenes between Ernie and Bert are classic and funny.  It's nice that some truly great things stand the test of time!,1232582400,,390,4.375
8263213,5,B0016MJ6EM,"I checked this DVD out from the library to see if my son would like it.  He is mesmerized.  He usually doesn't like Sesame Street videos that aren't super heavy on Elmo, but he loves this one.  It is all about math in sports (counting, shapes, sizes, etc.).  It stars Bert and Ernie and has appearances by Elmo, Prairie Dawn, Grover, Zoe, and Murray.  It even has bonus features of 3 Bert and Ernie's Great Adventures clips, and Elmo playing football with the Jets.  We will have to buy this one!",1224460800,6,496,4.395604395604396
