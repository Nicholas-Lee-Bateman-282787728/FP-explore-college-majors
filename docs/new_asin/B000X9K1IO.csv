8227421,1,B000X9K1IO,This stuff was a waste of money. It contains Androst chemicals which are steroids. There are safer products on the market too. I tried Instinto Sensual. It is safe and works great too.,1304553600,,184,4.606060606060606
8227422,1,B000X9K1IO,The above writer is absolutely correct.  I wish I had read his post before I bought this DVD.  This is such a short clip that once I started it I realized that I had seen it on YouTube but thought that maybe I would be getting something a little more involved than the clip I saw on YouTube...by the time I was finished thinking about it...the damn thing was over....HAhahaaaaa!  What a bust....I thought it would go into a lot of extramarital issues involving swinging and married people....NOT....!,1220227200,,500,4.659090909090909
8227423,1,B000X9K1IO,"When you buy this disc, you're thinking you're either getting a full documentary, or a fill erisode of the show. It's not either! It's nothing more than a ten minute segment and that is it! A waste of money & plastic.",1215907200,,217,4.317073170731708
8227424,3,B000X9K1IO,"I was a bit disappointed with this DVD.  I have read Tamar's book and want to use her information to train a puppy in the near future.  I wanted to get a visual on how her training works -- some of it is in the video, but what I wanted most was to hear her ""dolphin"" like sound that shows displeasure and she didn't do that once.  It's just a news clip, not really a training video.",1197331200,4,382,3.935064935064935
