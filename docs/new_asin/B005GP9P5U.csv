4692879,2,B005GP9P5U,"Why forgotten? Well, most fans and even the creator of the series would rather forget about it - and when even the creator admits that it quite frankly sucks, you're not off for a good start.

Hokuto no Ken 2 represents some third quarter of the original manga, and some ten years have passed since Kenshiro finally defeated Raoh for good, and the little peace he managed to bring upon the wasted earth is in ruins once more as various mad conquerors-to-be are once again repressing the poor old working class...basically, things are just as bad as they used to be, but this time things are a little different. Bat and Lin, the children of the original series, have now grown up and lead an entire army bearing Hokuto's name to fight the oppressors, but they still wait for Kenshiro's return...which eventually happens, naturally.

The Imperial Capital under the rule of cowardly Jakoh is out to destroy the little legacy North and South stars still have upon the world, and helping him is a powerful new warrior, Falco, who is the master of Gento Koken - Fist of the ""Source Star"" or Polaris - or rather humorously, the *actual* North Star. One event leads to another and soon Kenshiro finds himself sailing off to the land of Shura where strength is everything and we are revealed more of Hokuto Shinken's mysterious past.

And that's where things start to go wrong with this show. While the Imperial Capital arc is somewhat watchable, most FotNS fans will agree with mee that the series, both the manga and the anime, goes downhill after the timeskip. The revelations about Hokuto amount to massive retcons and frequently blatant contradiction to what we have learned in the past; while even the original series had a habit of doing this, Hokuto no Ken 2 cranks it up to eleven (along with a lot of other things), resulting in a story which is often difficult and sometimes almost impossible to follow. Even the primary antagonist is a rehash of Raoh, down to sharing the same voice actor, and he still comes off as a lesser character because of his ridicilous backstory. There is also a lot of filler, particularily towards the end, although it does introduce some interesting concepts (such as a group of Magnificent Seven-inspired freedom fighters). With the exclusion of Bat after the Imperial Capital arc, Lin is reduced to a bit player and the entire plot goes to a direction that isn't ""anyone can die"" but ""everyone WILL die"".

HnK2 isn't absolutely terrible though - there are some impressive fight scenes, the battle between Kenshiro and Han in particular comes to mind, and I personally find ""Kill the Fight"" to be far more effective than ""Heart of Madness"" when it comes to getting me all pumped up.",1322956800,3,2714,4.74364406779661
4692880,5,B005GP9P5U,"Fist of the North Star 2 has just been released today, one of Toei's most sacred properites. It only took 24 years for it to arrive on US shores but it's finally here, all 43 episodes in their original, uncut glory.

Fist of the North Star 2 has a lot of things going for it, despite the negative review underneath. The show is set many years in the future and gone are the annoying little kids, they are now mature adults with real feelings and you can really feel attached to their pain and suffering this time. You also delve more into the past of Kenshiro and you understand why he is the person he is and the hardships he's suffered along the way. There are alot more flashbacks in this series. One of the coolest features is he rides around on Roah's horse, it makes him look dark and dangerous, a very nice touch.

Because the series aired later, the character designs are much more detailed and realistic. The animation is very striking and it looks completly different, almost futuristic feel to it. If you don't believe me check out a custom music video on youtube called 'Fist of the North Star 2 - No Easy Way Out'. The perennial question is, will Kenshiro ever find Yuria? I've not watched the end of the show yet but I'm praying to god he does. I got really depressed when I thought she might be gone forever when I first saw episode 22 on the first series many years ago. I'm so far really engrossed and watching about 5 episodes a night, still got 10 more to go.

The video quality as with all Discotek releases is amazing. They use the remastered Japanese print and progressive scan for the picture. Colors are vivid, the picture is very detailed and the sound quality brilliant for a show that aired in 1987 to 1988 in Japan.

In conclusion, Fist of North Star 2 is more than worthy successor to original Fist of the North Star. If you've already bought collections 1-3, this is a must buy. All the unanswered questions from the first series finally get resolved, no stone is left unturned. It's only took 24 years but it's been worth the wait. Also remember supporting this release early on will also encourage Disotek to license more lost shows from this decade.",1320710400,3,2182,4.461152882205514
4692881,2,B005GP9P5U,"Just like the manga, Fist of the North star's true ending comes with the resolution of the final conflict between Kenshiro and Raoh, and also just like the manga, what follows is mostly ill-advised filler. The story skips ahead by several years and finds Kenshiro's kid companions, Bat and Lin, grown-up and leading a band of revolutionaries against an oppressive empire. Just as things look their most dire, Ken returns and puts considerable foot to ass -- as one would certainly expect -- but the initial run's narrative thrust and key conflict is no longer to be had, so the remainder of the series is essentially a series of tired tropes -- long-lost twin relatives and retconned history for Kenshiro and his brothers, among others -- and it all just fizzles out after growing yawn-inducingly tiresome. The series didn't even bother to finish adapting the manga and the sad thing about that is that it's no great loss. Even the manga's co-creators have publicly stated that the stuff they came up with after the series'intended ending was so bad, they now consider the subsequent parts of the series to have never happened.

The episodes found in this set do offer a few elements that may be attractive to fans, particularly a greater explanation of the origins of Hokutu Shinken and the true family connections and origins of Ken (which were retconned yet further in the prequel manga, Fist of the Blue Sky, and some of the super-powered fights and new characters are interesting (the conflicted Falco being a standout), but the real narrative magic is gone and what remains is just a case of going through the motions. I say all of this as a hardcore Fist of the North Star fan who first watched it religiously when it originally aired on Japanese TV (obtained sans subtitles on VHS during the mid-1980's on a monthly basis from Japan, and then later via Chinese-issued DVD boxed sets of the full series), so I'm not posting this as a hater. If you enjoyed  what came before and don't want to have your opinion of it possibly colored by the mediocrity that followed, I suggest very strongly that you stick with the first three boxed sets and move on.",1315526400,4,2156,4.7313829787234045
8471970,5,B005GP9P5U,"This is the final box set of the FOTNS. It takes place like 10 years after the season 3 boxset. This boxset is like volumes 2 and 3, and are English subtitle only! The last 3 box sets tv series were not released in the USA. However, if you are a huge FOTNS fan then the subtitles won't bother you. I absolutely love this series, and thoroughly enjoyed just reading the language subtitles.

This series finalizes the relationship of Kenshiro and Julia. It also has Bat, and Lin, back but older. I don't want to tell you the plot, but Lin's love for Ken, and rescuing her play a huge role in this boxset. Lin wants to be with Ken in this boxset, as she loves him.

New characters: good and bad, make up this entirely new volume. It is obviously different from the first 3, as the only returning characters are basically Ken, Lin, and Bat. However, this volume shines just as much as the first 3. Who wants the same old rehash, not me. I want a brand new story, and plot, and that is exactly what you get in volume 4.

I have enjoyed this entire FOTNS series immensely, and am sad to see it finally end. I wish it could go on longer. I will cherish watching these series again, in the future. I will remember this series for the rest of my life.

Lastly, this is definitely ""still"" not for kids due to vulgar language, intense fighting, blood and gore, and tons of murder.",1523664000,,1369,4.274131274131274

8471972,4,B005GP9P5U,"Alright. I bought all three of these box sets. I am a HUGE fan of Fist of the North Star but it is not because of these box sets.  I own the ""Manga"" DVD's with the English voice over and apparently unique approach to telling the story.( These are in Japanese with English subtitles which is charming if your a fan but, makes you rewind and review the subtitles to understand specifics.)  If you are expecting the catchy one liners Kenshiro is known for...If you are expecting screen pausing super Hokuto Shinken moves that emphasize the sheer brutality of the man with the seven scars that cement his place in anime history...then you will get none of that.(i think maybe one charming one liner...in about 18 dvds)
These dvds are for serious fans who can not get enough of the story, characters, SETTING and emotion that makes this series perhaps one of the best animated television programs in the history of the medium. I would start with the MANGA dvd's and then buy these to finish the story...It is the GREATEST(not exaggerating) television experience I've ever had and will remember it for the rest of my life.",1443398400,,1116,4.659898477157361

8471977,5,B005GP9P5U,"This is it, the final journey of the 2000 year old martial art Hokuto Shinken will end. Fist of the North Star box set 4 or Hokuto No Ken 2 had finally come out for America for the first time. WARNING! This show is violent and graphic like all of the first Hokuto No Ken episodes. This box set had nice, sharp, beautiful, and violent graphics. Hokuto No Ken 2 shows about Lin's past, how Ken, Raoh, and Toki escaped from Asura, and how Hokuto Shinken was established. HNK 2 had new villains like Jako, a corrupted man who pretended to be the Celestial Emperor also a coward who feared Raoh in the past and Raoh's and Toki's true brother Kaioh. Kaioh is the most powerful villain that Ken ever faced also he is one of the 5 successors of a brutal martial art called Hokuto Ryuken which rivaled Hokuto Shinken. If you are a true fan of Hokuto No Ken, I recommended that you buy all of the box sets, Fist of the North Star 1988 anime movie, Fist of the North Star Legends of a True Savior, the manga, video games, and the action figures.",1368144000,,1034,4.253807106598985

8471979,5,B005GP9P5U,"Discotek did a great job bringing over all of hokuto no ken.  The main series, Hokuto No  Ken, is summed up by their first three dvd volume sets which contains episodes 1-109.  Hokuto no Ken 2 is the sequel, not as memorable as the first, but as a fan of HnK I still loved these 43 episodes.  Episode 152 not only marks the conclusion of HnK2 but of both series combined as well.  I say get it if you loved the first series.  I got into HnK about 5 years ago when I stumbled upon a youtube video and I still love it to this day.

Now if we got the manga released in the states that would be awesome as well, Gutsoon I'm looking at you ;)",1323129600,2,637,3.9296875
