4661485,3,B005DR64QE,"Trespass was doomed from the beginning. Set to play the antagonist, Nicolas Cage walked off the set only to return a few days later to play the protagonist. The studio, showing little faith in the finished product, opted to give the film a limited release in theatres with a release to video-on-demand the same day and, to top it all off, set a home video release date before it even hit theatres and VOD. It doesn't help that the film reunites one of Hollywood's most misunderstood actors with director Joel Schumacher, who still can't escape the wrath of film critics and audiences for directing Batman & Robin. Trespass is another home invasion movie; a sub-genre that has been done very well (Panic Room) and has been done decently (Hostage). It is neither Cage nor Schumacher that is to blame for how this film turned out, but screenwriter Karl Gajdusek, whose only previous credits include episodes of the television show Dead Like Me. The idea and execution is derivative of home invasion movies that came before it and offers nothing new or exciting to the premise. Everything is by-the-numbers, full of clichs and idiotic plot twists, resulting in a predictable climax. Even worse, Trespass has stupid criminals and stupid victims making it hard to root for either one. With a brisk 90-minute running time it doesn't waste time jumping into the core of the plot though.

Nicolas Cage plays Kyle Miller, a diamond dealer who lives in a lavish isolated mansion with his wife Sarah (Nicole Kidman) and daughter Avery (Liana Liberato). Soon after Kyle arrives home, Avery has snuck out of the house to attend a party in an attempt to set up the suspense that she'll return when everything goes awry. Only 12 minutes in, the Miller home has been invaded by four criminals. The apparent ringleader (Ben Mendelsohn) wants Kyle to open his safe, which is believed to contain hundreds of thousands worth of diamonds and cash. The criminals plan to be in and out of the house in twenty minutes, but matters grow difficult when Kyle stubbornly refuses to bend to their will. Meanwhile, Sarah notices something familiar about one of the criminals (Cam Gigandet) while the emotionally unstable female of the group simply wanders around the house.

Trespass is 90 minutes of ""open the safe,"" ""I refuse"" dialogue and overacting, the latter of which makes the film a bit more tolerable than it should've been. There's not much suspense because you can see it coming a mile away and when the illogical plot twist is thrown in all you can do is roll your eyes. Joel Schumacher has directed his share of great, average, and bad films and even if you look at the ones that linger somewhere between bad and average, he's a competent director that knows how to maintain suspense when necessary. Unfortunately, it never occurred to him or the two Academy Award winning actors leading the cast to demand a rewrite of the script. The set-up and execution is so generic that I can't believe anyone involved took part for anything other than money. Cage has done little to keep secret that he's not opposed to renting himself out if the fee is right. With such poor characterization and stilted dialogue, credit must be given to the actors for not sleepwalking through their roles. Mendelsohn brings to mind a young Gary Oldman, but anyone familiar with Cage's filmography will admit that Trespass may have been a better film if he had played Mendelsohn's role. Kidman brings nothing noteworthy to the role of Sarah, but there's nothing noteworthy about the character. Liberato is playing the typical daughter, who just wants to rebel against her parents and go to a party. The role is thankless, but the actress may actually have some talent that could be put to better use in a better movie.

Thankfully Cage is always reliable to make something entertain if all else fails and his performance doesn't disappoint. Cage has a tendency to go so over-the-top in bad movies that it's like he's satirizing the ridiculousness of everything; this tendency is often mistaken for bad acting. If you watch Deadfall or The Wicker Man, it becomes apparent that Cage is totally self-aware of the ridiculousness of what he's doing. Cage overacts in Trespass but handles the material more seriously than usual. His performance is fun to watch as he doesn't play it straight (he's attached a barely noticeable accent and plays Kyle in a very pathetic manner), but it doesn't save the film or add enough to boost it to cult ""so-bad-its-good"" status. Few actors play perpetually on edge as well as Cage does and he makes the film marginally better.

Trespass is not offensively bad; it's not a film that anyone will kick themselves over wasting 90 minutes of their life on. It's just a forgettable thriller that is so derivative of other films in the genre you may confuse plot elements of other films with this one. It's not an insult to the intelligence of the people watching it, but an insult to the intelligence of those involved. It's never boring, but it fails to create any plausible suspense and lacks the substance necessary to recommend it. It's not that better home invasion films have come before it; if this were the first, it would remain a mediocre effort.

4661489,3,B005DR64QE,"The first half of the movie runs tight and suspenseful.  But the trick with these kinds of movies is that once the hostages escape, the movie is pretty much over. This leads to some pretty lame developments which I won't reveal. But here's a hint:  You know those horror movies where the victim escapes the attacker and runs upstairs instead of downstairs?  It's kind of like that.  It's like an episode of The World's Dumbest Criminals or The World's Dumbest Hostages.  The ending somehow doesn't feel satisfying, because everything that comes before it just gets lamer and lamer.  It is well-filmed and directed, though.

4661491,4,B005DR64QE,"There's something oddly quaint about watching a movie like Trespass in this day and age. The thriller, starring Nicolas Cage and Nicole Kidman, is a perfectly self aware piece of entertainment with no greater ambition in mind than to just give the people a good old fashioned white knuckler, and to hell with all that CGI, shaky cam nonsense. It's about time. Trespass truly is the perfect sorbet for those wishing to cleanse the enamel-stripping, syrupy sweetness of summer from their palate. While still a Hollywood genre picture top to bottom, Trespass feels so far removed from the past season's onslaught of absurd bombast (which I'm not ashamed to say was pretty awesome) that it feels as refreshing as a crisp autumn breeze.

The story opens with Kyle, a spitfire diamond broker played by Cage in what may be his most convincing everyman role to date, returning to his opulent gated home with an attach case ironed to his wrist. Apparently this is all routine for Kyle who, after casually greeting his lovely wife (Kidman) and dodging an argument with his precocious teenage daughter, Avery (Miss Liana Liberato, one to watch), deposits the case safely into his office's fittingly high-end wall safe after uncuffing himself. The household is quiet and mostly empty. The wife feels her dwindling beauty goes unnoticed by her ever-busy husband, the daughter feels trapped within her own house and just wants to party it up with older boys. So, aside from the affluence, we have ourselves a pretty average family dynamic rife with tensions both unspoken and exhaustively discussed (by the daughter).

Director Joel Schumacher frames these early scenes with an almost Spartan efficiency, drawing attention to little things that  the audience just knows will soon become key pieces in a chaotic game. Schumacher knows what the people show up for, and he wastes not a moment in setting up Kyle's home as a ground zero waiting to happen. And soon enough, some questionably uniformed police officers arrive at the front door and... insist on coming inside.

Without giving too much away, Kyle's safe becomes the trespassers' center of attention and what ensues is a battle of wills and wits, with Cage supplying the will and Kidman the wit. The antagonists of the film become surprisingly layered in their characterization, though sometimes succumbing to clumsy archetypes, they provide the story with an invaluable dose of unpredictability as their hazy motivations and plans are slowly unraveled. The film never gives away too much to soon, always keeping a card or two under the table, and allowing the audience to pile on questions as to how it's all going to play out. The movie is not above telling the audience outright lies, but the ploy works for the most part, saving one last ""ahah!"" moment for the end.

The trespassers and their victims are all played expertly, with no glaring weak links in the cast. Kidman's role is on the thin side, but she keeps a level head amidst the chaos and convinces in her ""mama bear"" moments. Cage's character is saddled with some strange motivations, but he delivers on portraying a man who acts far more in control than he actually is. He also gets a fine monologue, punctuated by fits of stressed snorting.
The surprise standout of the cast is Cam Gigandet, one whom I'd previously written off as a wooden pretty boy. He convinces as a deeply conflicted thief, torn between allegiances as events teeter out of control. The entire motley crew of thieves is well cast, and though their lack of professionalism as criminals is at first off-putting, as the situation escalates their in fighting and instability only adds to the tension so expertly arranged by Mr. Schumacher.

The camera work is solid across the board, making even Kyle's massive estate feel stiflingly claustrophobic. When things (inevitably) escalate to violence in the climax, it is all shot carefully and with urgency, never devolving into a chaotic mess. Set design also deserves special recognition, as the house looks both realistic and ravishing, even as it disintegrates around the cast.

Though it bears all the markings, Trespass does not feel like a modern Hollywood film, perhaps because the director is still caught in his own 90's style filmmaking  sensibilities. Regardless, the film is refreshing not because of innovation, but because it is a throwback to a time not so long ago when the script and the actors were the most important elements in crafting a good crowd pleaser. This is the right kind of movie at just the right time; sandwiched comfortably between the arduous spectacle of summer and the equally arduous pretension of award season. While at the end of the day, Trespass is no more than a good flick, sometimes though, that's more than enough.",1317168000,8,4784,4.963795255930087

4661494,2,B005DR64QE,"Nicholas Cage is not a bad actor, but rather a terrible one. In 2011's TRESPASS, he goes the absolute distance in showing just how dreadful that he can be as a so-called performer. If Joel Schumacher is attempting to salvage what remains of his directorial career, he had probably best pick projects in future that actually have scripts attached to them. This film is little more than loudness, screaming, continual swearing, and unnecessary twists that make us think that someone cared enough to point out how absurd that they actually seem and then just left them in the film anyway. As distracting as Nicole Kidman's lips are here, I still think that she is a sensationally beautiful and photogenic woman for all time, but having to watch her next to Nicholas Cage actually hampers both her performance and her on screen sex appeal. Barefoot and forced into a myriad of awkward positions, Nicole is never less than intensely watchable. But if Cage had taken his performance a bit more seriously yet, it might have gone down in history as one of the funniest, most ridiculous acting jobs ever. As such it just seems annoying and unbelievable. Nicole is the only saving grace in the film, and even she cannot save it this time. It is truly a mean and unpleasant movie that adds nothing new to the home invasion thriller genre. It frustrates me when so many smaller films sink beneath my viewing radar, but in this case I almost wish that this one would have gotten away from my attention. Sadly, it did not. Millennium ended up distributing this one, but that's no points for their company. Picture quality on this DVD is quite mediocre, but the sound is quite good. But if you want a really watchable thriller for the evening, try looking elsewhere. This one simply doesn't deliver anything other than frustration and clich. Ugh.

4661505,4,B005DR64QE,"Has Nicholas Cage ever made a bad movie? Granted that some haven't been as good as Trespass, but when you see Nicholas Cage's name, you know you're always going to be entertained. Teaming up with famed Director Joel Schumacher and the always intense Nicole Kidman, Cage stars in a type of film we've all seen before. Trespass has a common storyline, but it's done in an unexpected way, with an ending that will leave you speechless. Kyle Miller (Nicholas Cage) is a wealthy diamond merchant, who has finally built the mansion he's always wanted. It has also made him a target for a sophisticated team of thieves, who want their share. Surprised at home one night, the Miller family is held hostage. Positive that if he gives them what he wants his family is dead, Kyle refuses their demands, leading to an epic standoff. Nicholas Cage shows a different side in Trespass, as he's not the cunning hero that saves the day, but rather a family man, trying to protect his family. He's paired with Nicole Kidman, who while being a terrific actress, usually makes films I have no interest in seeing. An action thriller is also something out of the norm for her, but she handled it like a pro and her chemistry with Nicholas Cage was outstanding! Finally, the cast is rounded out by OC star and teen heartthrob Cam Gigandet. I've made it clear that I feel a lot of these ""heartthrobs"" only get jobs because of their looks, and if that's the rule, Gigandet is the exception. Playing both sides in the conflict, the young star does an outstanding job. Gigandet's character is easily the most complex, having to play the good and the bad guy. It's his role and the twist associated with it that makes the whole film rise above similar films like Panic Room. On the surface Trespass is just another copycat, but the story turns out to be far more complex than a home invasion. A unique cast of characters with terrific chemistry, combined with one of my favorite Directors, make for what can only be called a must see movie!",1411171200,,2012,4.607242339832869

It is a film with alot of promise,as Cage is quite convincing in his role,as is Kidman,but as the film rolls on it becomes just another average watch,typical of its type.
The story finds Cage as a diamond buyer/seller. As he rolls home to see his wife and daughter whom he hasn't seen in a few days,he is on the phone to a potential client for whom he must dash out later to clinch a deal. After a fairly brief stay he is going out when the ""police"" show up at his gate wanting to see them about burglaries in the area. When they open the door three men and a woman burst in and the game is on;they're there to steal his stash of diamonds and/or cash.
As the heist progresses we learn that one of the burglars has more than a passing interest in his wife and in fact was in the house posing as an electrician of sorts and casing the joint. While they think they know Cage's m.o.,it eventually comes out that Cage is in fact broke. He lost his permanent job and has been just eking by with little sales now and again which barely keeps their heads above water. After much torture and threats Cage finally opens the safe to them and nothing is in there. By this time the group are starting to get antsy and time is running out,as it seems one of them owes their boss almost $200,000 from drugs that were stolen off of him.
The end of the film comes down to a confrontation in the still under construction part of their new house. A well placed scuffle later and a hidden wall is opened which reveals a huge amount of cash Cage hid,so if the bank repossessed the house they would have at least something. But now one of the men is going to shoot Kidman and the other shoots him dead. A fire breaks out and the last man is burned to death. Kidman holds onto Cage for dear life who has two gun shots in him. Fade to black.
The cast is certainly a good one and as I mentioned Cage and Kidman both did good jobs in their respective roles,but it just wasn't good enough to offset that been-there,done-that feeling. There just was nothing distinctive enough and/or atypical to elevate this flick above any others of its genre.
Technically speaking the film is crisp and clear in its 2:35:1 w/s a/r. Extras include three featurettes and a cast a crew interview.

This movie ought to be categorized as a COMEDY!

I'm giving this a pass grade because of the seemingly intense emotions that the actors displayed in this movie. Nicole Kidman may have saved this movie with her good looks, but she deserves better than to star in a cheap movie like this one.

I'm not surprised that those robbers didn't get what they wanted as they were  disorganized incompetents. Imagine the ""Home Alone"" robbers wanting to go pro right after snorting some coke!

There's movies that he fits in perfectly too like Bad Lieutenant, Gone in 60seconds, etc. and then there's movies that our buddy Nick just doesn't belong in. The Wicker Man, National Treasure, THIS MOVIE! This movie is a terrible waste of Cage. I kept cringing at every seen just hoping they would shoot him and put him out the misery of being in this film. I mean I already saw a film like this called Hostage a long time ago and that was a waste of Bruce Willis. These rich people getting robbed movies sure have gotten old. Well at least in this movie the guy is actually broke (Post Bush era I guess). I enjoyed that particular twist in the film but that was about all that was interesting. I just kept watching the film hoping that Nicholas would put on his Cage powers and make the movie become worth watching but to no luck the movie just sort of runs on with him just getting beat up like a rag doll and then it just ends? I don't get the ending. Did they run out of film budget? Did they not think of a way to do a 5months later theme showing him and his family happy and smiling together? No, it just turns to black and role credits. Ultimately that also made me feel like I wasted my time if the directors were too lazy to even finish off their bad movie properly. It's like they realized no one was going to make it to the end of the film so they just cut it off. I get the feeling that this film is really some rich Hollywood director/writers attempt at some political message that only the 1% get. As for the rest of us 99% this was just an all out bad film. I knew it was going to be bad as soon as I saw Nichole Kidman in it. Batman,The Others,That movie with her and Tom Cruise I forgot the name of. She seems to have the luck of being in movie that suck.

I used to say a movie I hated was the worst one I've ever seen, only to be surprised by something even worse.  On that premise, the only thing I can safely assure you of is that this is a top contender for biggest stinker of all time if not the ultimate one.

Another thing I would like to point out is that I was never interested in seeing this movie because Nicole ""Ice Queen"" Kidman and Nicholas ""Ought to be locked in a"" Cage are known for their ingenious knack of being in stinkers.  Well, combine the two with a cast of inept robbers who act as bad as most of the cast in Malevolence, and you get yourself one toxic waste of a stench that would make you want to clear the room if not for the stop button.  The only good thing I can say about this movie is I didn't choose to watch it.  Unfortunately, Sweetie Pie Dearest realized his blunder in choice less than half-way through, and I made the choice to finish watching it, truly amazed at how bad it was.  How much worse was it going to get?  LOTS!

The robbers were stupid, the dumbest one being the guy who had the hots for Nicole. Guess his freezer was broke and he needed something frigid to rest his beer on.  Cage's character was the worst, his character doing the most nonsensical things witnessed on film in a long time.  No matter what this idiot gets threatened with, no matter how much violence and bad language ensue, he refuses to give up any money.  If he'd have given the creeps anything at all right away, we wouldn't have had 90 minutes of bad over-acting and the world's most pointless plot.  No, he won't do it, so we have to watch the worst character of all outdo Cage's awful delivery running around strung out in a purple dress and torturing a young girl.  In fact, the only character with any brains in this movie was the daughter.

I'm so angry with myself for choosing to finish this horrible flick that I can't even bear to get into the absurdities of a guy with a gun, a needle, a wife rape, removing a daughter's kidney, and a kook obsessed with the Ice Queen staring him in the face being uncooperative at every turn, so all I can say is if you still think this movie sounds appealing, you are more easily entertained than a little kid watching Teletubbies.  It's on almost the same level, except Teletubbies has less foul language, makes more sense, and isn't an insult to the human race regardless of age.",1344124800,,2512,4.312765957446809

Makes me wonder why these film ""experts"" aren't out in Hollywood themselves and writing and directing movies that meet their own obviously higher standards - instead of so arduously ripping into the work of others.

With respect to ""Trespass"".... if you enjoy Nicholas Cage's acting in general, you'll probably enjoy this movie.  Although it's pretty much an ""average"" movie all the way around, it does have entertainment value.  If you're in the mood for something profound, just find another movie to watch tonight.

4661536,2,B005DR64QE,"""Trespass"" is a home invasion thriller that is not so much terrible as mediocre. Director Joel Schumacher (""Falling Down"" ""Time to Kill"") keeps the ball rolling, and there are some nice twists and turns along the way, but before the film reaches its halfway point, I think most of the viewers would lose interest in what is going on. In other words, we just don't care when we don't know what these characters really want to do, whose motives remain unconvincing throughout. In short, everything in ""Trespass"" looks very silly.

A diamond dealer Kyle Miller (Nicolas Cage) and his wife Sarah (Nicole Kidman) living in a lavish lakeside house are taken hostage by a group of robbers. The masked criminals think this is an easy job until Kyle refuses to open the safe, even though seeing his wife held at gunpoint. The battle of wits and wills begins.

But does it? ""Trespass"" starts out pretty good, but quickly becomes generic and predictable, with several familiar plot devices that have been frequently used in this thriller subgenre. To make matters worse, every time characters are given a chance to escape (or do whatever they want), they miss it in an inexplicable way. Expository flashbacks that attempt to add more mysteries just do not work, especially when the main plot about the robbery is uninteresting, not knowing where to go.

Realizing that the film's story is not getting any better, I thought the stars Nicolas Cage and Nicole Kidman would do something to make it better. I was wrong. No charisma, no ""star power."" While Cage overacts, Kidman remains unmemorable. The two Oscar-winning players add nothing to the film that remains mostly unoriginal. So what can I expect?

It is not that ""Trespass"" is awful. I just don't know why the film had to be made.",1340841600,,1774,4.8256578947368425
4661537,5,B005DR64QE,"Nicolas Cage stars as Kyle Miller, a rich successful diamond dealer with a home safe bigger than my bank's. He doesn't have time for his family. Nicole Kidman plays his wife Sarah who struggles to keep the family together. Liana Liberato is their daughter Avery, who is at that difficult rebellious teen stage. She is not allowed to see Kendra (Emily Meade) who is a bad influence on her.

Once the characters are quickly established the movie turns into a home break-in film. Avery is not at home because she disobeyed her parents to go to a party with Kendra...a party that has the forbidden older boys!

While Kyle and his wife are being bullied and threatened, Kyle is attempting to figure out who these people are from indirect clues they give him. Cage manages to cause disharmony among the thieves. There are flashbacks as Kyle and Kidman think they know who these people are. As it turns out they both have their dirty little secrets. Excellent job by the actors. Fairly decent script for a home break-in which is normally a ""B"" movie. Good script with multiple twists and they weave seeming useless things from the beginning into the mesh. One of the better home break-in films. If you liked this one try the new version of ""Mother's Day.""

When watching a bad movie, you notice it all too well as you sit through the tortuous experience of it. This film falls into the latter category, and at only 90 minutes, it feels twice as long, if not longer.

This film was bad enough in just the first 10 minutes, seeing the leads not fully committed to their roles, but when the home invaders show up, it only gets worse. There are 4 of them, and 2.5 of them are useless: squeamish leader, coldly efficient muscle, leader's delusional brother and leader's drug addict girlfriend. They present no united front at all; whenever the leader or the muscle starts to step up, the leader's delusional brother steps in (he thinks he and Nicole are destined to be together) or the drug addict girlfriend starts to wig out, forcing the leader or the muscle to deal with them and giving the protagonists plenty of opportunities to fight back.

4661544,4,B005DR64QE,"Say what you will about the number of recipe films whose basic ingredients are rich people in beautiful houses who are raided by gangsters and held hostage in their own home only to turn the stakes on the perpetrators, but in the hands of director Joel Schumacher it is a pretty dependable fact that the intensity of the film will last from the opening titles to the closing credits.  TRESPASS is not a brilliant or unique film, but it is a quality piece of work. It has a script By Karl Gajdusek with some fine lines and quality twists that keep the audience guessing and enough innovative bits of action that make the film seem fresh (even if the behavior of all concerned is not to swift!).

Kyle Miller (Nicholas Cage) appears obsessed with his business life - marketing diamonds - and comes home to his mansion (designed by his wife) where wife Sarah (Nicole Kidman) seems to be needing more than an income to make her life complete. They share a teenage daughter Avery (Liana Liberato) who is typically making her own decisions about socializing despite her parents objections: she sneaks out of the highly security guarded house to go to a naughty party. In the rush of all this there is a call at the door which when opened shows us four masked bandits who are there to rob the safe. The thugs are a strange assortment: the main speaker is Elias (the talented Ben Mendelsohn), his druggie girlfriend Petal (Jordana Spiro), Eiias' young brother Jonah (the hunky rising star Cam Gigandet), and the heavy Ty (Dash Mihok). The crooks want the safe opened but Kyle refuses, beginning to bargain with the thugs until the truth of his financial situation is made known. Sarah wants Kyle to open the safe, attempting to hide her own secret that involves Jonah.  Avery sneaks back home to find her parents beaten and held as hostages and all the secrets of all the cast are gradually revealed  - secrets that lead to an unexpected resolution.

Nicholas Cage is Nicholas Cage, and it works for him.  The real star turns in the film are those by Ben Mendelsohn and Cam Gigandet.  Nicole Kidman provides solid support in her bifurcated role.  The movie is no great shakes, but it is a tense evening's entertainment. One surprise comes in the closing credits: they are rolled with some very soothing and beautiful movie music by David Buckley instead of the usual hardrock noisy song that most of these movies select to bring the film to a close.

That being said, this was not only poorly conceived; the acting was lazy and boring. I attempted to look to the set or costume design, or maybe the special effects or story subtext that might give the movie hope, sadly there was nothing.
I would like to see this movie executed properly. Clean up the plot slop and give the ending a face lift and of course, some 'better' actors that appear committed to the film.  THEN, maybe this could make it worth a Wednesday night rental.
Nicole Kidman has the talent to pull off any role she sets her mind to. Ive seen some dynamic and genuinely moving work from her! What happened?
Nicolas Cage is PERFECT if the action and story line can carry his 10 lines throughout the film. He just cant carry a film in any context.

Helmed by Joel Schumacher and co-starring Nicole Kidman, Trespass follows a wealthy young family who are taken hostage in their mansion by extortionists looking to score on a home invasion run. Unfortunately, the film simply relies on too many familiar elements from other similar films like Panic Room, rendering the tension ineffective, and is far too nasty and aggressive to be entertaining.

Like others have commented, it is like watching an episode of World's Dumbest Criminals.

I am not sure if this was supposed to be silly or suspenseful because the whole film comes across very goofy and comical.

Cam Gigandet is as sexy as ever as one of the masked men who invade their home.
The four men that break in are desperate to get money because they owe a big drug dealer and their lives depend upon getting it.
The movie does venture into the scenario of good home invader,bad Home invader and really really sociopathic home invader.
The rest I really won't elaborate on because it would be spoilers.
I can tell you there are power struggles and that this family is not going to take it lying down. It isn't by any means in the same arena as 'Last House on Left or 'the Strangers',but a good home invasion movie all the same.",1319932800,,870,4.477987421383648

4661576,5,B005DR64QE,"Nicolas Cage stars as Kyle Miller, a rich successful diamond dealer with a home safe bigger than my bank's. He doesn't have time for his family. Nicole Kidman plays his wife Sarah who struggles to keep the family together. Liana Liberato is their daughter Avery, who is at that difficult rebellious teen stage. She is not allowed to see Kendra (Emily Meade) who is a bad influence on her.

Once the characters are quickly established the movie turns into a home break-in film. Avery is not at home because she disobeyed her parents to go to a party with Kendra...a party that has the forbidden older boys!

While Kyle and his wife are being bullied and threatened, Kyle is attempting to figure out who these people are from indirect clues they give him. Cage manages to cause disharmony among the thieves. There are flashbacks as Kyle and Kidman think they know who these people are. As it turns out they both have their dirty little secrets. Excellent job by the actors. Fairly decent script for a home break-in which is normally a ""B"" movie. Good script with multiple twists as they weave seeming useless things from the beginning into the mesh.

One of the thieves, Jordana Spiro, for some reason feels she must look around the upstairs in her bra and panties. Thanks.

4661577,3,B005DR64QE,"I thought the fact that this movie wasn't going to get a wide release in theaters meant that it was going to be a complete disaster. After all, as good as Nicolas Cage is he has done some real garbage lately.

The good news is that the movie is a step above some of the cheesy movies Cage has become known for the past few years (I'm looking at you Bangkok Dangerous, Season Of The Witch, The Wicker Man, Next and Drive Angry). Cage plays the lead, Kyle, and plays a sleazy businessman with his trophy wife (Kidman) who on the surface lives the life of luxury. Kidman plays Sarah, the sexy repressed trophy wife who wants her husband with her instead of the road. They also have a rebellious teenaged daughter named Avery.

Their home is broken into and they are attacked by four masked kidnappers who demand Kyle had over his nest egg and the diamonds he transfers for his sleazy clients. This is the best part of the film as the kidnappers try to just muscle there way to the money and then begin to brutally torture the leads when Cage doesn't go along with them and fights back to protect his family. The film is relentless as the kidnappers will go to whatever lengths they have to get the money they came to get. Kidman does a good job as well although her role is a bit underutilized as she spends large blocks of the movie standing off to the side screaming during violent scenes.

The third act is primarly where the film's weaknesses are located. It is when the film becomes more about the kidnappers instead of the family. You get a lot of backstory as the kidnappers start to argue and have conflict amongst themselves. Unnecessary twist after twist is revealed about their individiual motivations for going after this particular family. All the while this is going on Cage, Kidman and the daughter are laying in the background like extras.

That said the film really teases you and you want to see the family take out the kidnappers so badly that you are really hoping to see some violent revenge at the end of the movie.

Its not a great movie, or even an original story, but Nicolas Cage and Nicole Kidman don't phone it and are believable enough that they make for an entertaining movie.",1319241600,,2203,4.470149253731344

4661579,1,B005DR64QE,"Wow what a horrible cliched film. How many breaking and entering movies have you seen just in the last five years or more? Firewall(which was great), Hostage, The Strangers, Panic Room (great), Funny Games, and the list goes on. This movies is basically a parody of itself. The F word flies around like a swarm of locusts, killing any chance of any kid of meaningful, creative dialogue. And a premise? Wow, breaking into someones house who really has no money, seriously? I don't think Joel Shulmaker has really made any ""stellar"" films, but he is (was) a decent director. Why big stars like Cage and Kidman are in such a hideous picture, basically straight to DVD, is beyond me. I just hope a lot of these stars aren't getting the Cuba Gooding Jr syndrome. It seems a lot of older actors are being pushed into crappy straight to DVD films these days. And some good ones as well, but few. All this movie does is really irritate the viewer, other than the foul language there is not a quiet moment, or emotional one in the whole film. Everyone rants around like they forgot to take there meds, just screaming and yelling at each other till you get a headache and say ok enough. Don't just kill the hostages, just kill everyone in the movie! This is definitely Cages worst performance, although he has had a few bad ones in the past. He actually uses words like $$#thole and A##F%$k, real great dialogue there. Also he whines like a little girl through most of the film, trying to fend off the bad dudes, but the girls overpower him and end up kicking more tail than he does. He mainly lays on the ground bleeding and/or crying or both.

So sorry it contains spoilers, not that anyone is ""dying"" to see this film, but it's really as bad as the critics and audience says it is. Which usually might or not be true. In this case it's painfully true, don't let this movie ""trespass"" into your movie collection. The other blu rays will skoot off the shelve just to avoid it. I think you should too. Later. :)

Not a problem with the movie plot; we like the action and felt like seein it to see how these particular ppl wouild get out of their situation (Harrison Ford starred in one lately, as well: ""Firewall""). With that said, we noticed the rating was an ""R"" and when I heard the credits begin to roll I was certain this movie was going to be good. Not all ""R"" ratings are the same and this one did not describe in detail or even in partial(that I can find) that the language was pervasive...strongly pervasive. When words like this are so repetitive they actually destroy the picture. I don't know a single person who goes to a movie and says to himself,

""hey buddy, I can't wait to see that new picture showing this weekend that is loaded with pervasive foul language.""

On the other hand, I HAVE heard ppl say to themselves, ""I've heard the story line (or plot, etc) is really great and I want to see that movie this weekend!""

Film Directors and Producers: do the world a favor and produce some movies with a few less lines of the foul stuff that is so over done that one groans and has to leave the theatre or take their DVD back and ask for a refund.

While trying to buy time Kyle begins to question the robbers and secrets are revealed and the break-in becomes more tense. This is a movie that had a lot of potential to be great and exciting. The big problem with this one is that it was a good half hour story that is drug out for 90 minutes. It is a good movie that is worth a watch, but it seems to get a tad repetitive and because of that it loses some of the edge that it needs to get the effect it needs. For those that know me know that I am not a Nicholas Cage fan at all and I am also in love with Nicole Kidman, so this was a very personal movie for me. I will admit that Cage didn't bother me in this as much as he usually does. From me that's a huge compliment. Overall, definitely worth watching, but like most movies lately this was missing something to make it really great. I give it a B-.
