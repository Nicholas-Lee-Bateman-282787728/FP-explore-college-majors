8033431,5,B0002VYPGW,"This series looks good--the music & art set the mood well. The stories aren't gross-out horror as Hollywood often goes for, but are quite horrific in their own way. In this volume, we get cannibalism & necrophilia, but wonderfully dealt with. I love the character development. In Volume 1, Momosuke is pretty much horrified at the actions of the trio, yet in Vol. 2, he is being sucked into their world with little-or-no protest(thanks to Ogin), even aiding them, seeing no more wrong about the situation than those the trio enact their vengeance upon find any wrong in their lives.",1105574400,5,582,4.83
8033432,4,B0002VYPGW,"This series is a step up from the usual series anime retreads. THe artwork is minimal and beautiful, and the 'Tales of the Crypt' style stories benefit from being placed in a Japanese historical setting. Worth watching.",1103587200,4,219,4.945945945945946
