4982392,5,B006BFK4CM,A Must for any San Francisco Giants Fan has lots of nice extras and incl Visit to The White House with The President of The United States Barack Hussien Obama. I highly recommend the dvd.,1325721600,,187,4.371428571428571
4982393,2,B006BFK4CM,"I haven't watched the whole series yet, but a couple things right off the bat (pun intended) really turned me off from this DVD.
1)  DVD is the only options available (really, no bluray?)
2)  No subtitles (wife is hard of hearing, have to turn it WAY up with a lack of subtitles)

These are two things that showtime really should have handled as they are pretty standard these days.  Poor execution on what I am hoping is a great series.",1325376000,3,437,4.3580246913580245
4982394,5,B006BFK4CM,"I first watched this series as it aired on Showtime and it is a must-watch for any San Francisco Giants fan, and I'll even go as far as recommending it for any baseball fan. It's a great in-depth look at the 2010 World Series champions and come on, it's full of Brian Wilson's antics. Every episode keeps you wanting more... and I hope this series continues with the Giants or with other baseball clubs, for that matter. This series has great cinematography and great interviews.",1324339200,3,479,4.647058823529412
4982395,5,B006BFK4CM,"I watched this on Showtime this summer and it was EXCELLENT! I'm so glad it's finally available so I can delete it from my DVR. In the first hour, I both cried and laughed so hard I cried. Tip: don't stop or fast forward through the end credits of the first episode, Brian ""The Beard"" Wilson will have you rolling on the floor laughing. As funny as he is, I think Ryan Vogelsong's story is the best. Overall, I think this was a fascinating inside look at the Giants organization; a must have for any fan. Even the bandwagon ones like me. :)",1323907200,,540,4.252427184466019
4982396,5,B006BFK4CM,"I regretted not taping The Franchise when we watched it on Showtime. So glad it's coming on DVD.... Christmas List... Winner! Looks like great special features and extras too. You really get to know the players and get a taste of what it's like to be a professional sports player. There is a touching segment about 2 ballplayers anticipating getting home to see their families, they miss pratically all aspects of their kids growing up. Yes, they're millionaires, but you can't buy seeing your baby walk or talk for the first time. Wonderfully photographed and edited. With a touch of baseball to keep the guys interested and behind the scenes stories of a wide variety. I love the Giants but would watch this regardless of the team. Really well done Showtime!",1322611200,5,760,4.809160305343512
4982397,5,B006BFK4CM,"As a die-hard Giants fan, I do love this!",1415923200,,41,3.6666666666666665
4982398,2,B006BFK4CM,Not particularly a good read.  It was like reading yesterday's newspaper.,1404432000,,73,5.636363636363637
4982399,5,B006BFK4CM,"Really wish they did this in '12 but still was super cool to see the players and behind the scenes. With roster changes and all that it would've been a tad more interesting had they waited a year. Albeit, buy it. Great production.",1392940800,,230,4.372093023255814
4982400,3,B006BFK4CM,"For the sports nuts in your family this is the movie for you.

I recommend it to those people who really enjoy a sports story.

The story is a little slow but gets the point across.",1391040000,,181,4.0
4982401,5,B006BFK4CM,AWEEEESOMMMMMEEE!! absolutely love my Giants and watching this is just so awesome. Thank you for the fast fast shipping and the DVD. Love it.,1386633600,,141,4.916666666666667
4982402,5,B006BFK4CM,"As a long time Giants fan I was looking forward to the series on Showtime.
When it aired I wasn't disappointed.
The series aired the season after the Giants won their first World Series since moving to SF.
 I was eager to see how they would come back the following season.
Unfortunately, they didn't make the playoffs in 2011, but this DVD is worth the cost.
Highly recommended to any Giants fan..",1383091200,,397,4.513888888888889
4982403,5,B006BFK4CM,"This is a must see production. I borrowed this from a friend, and watched it all in one sitting. Loved it so much, decided I needed to own it. Came in the mail promptly. Now I will begin teaching my kid sister about the legendary SF misfits. BTW great for all audiences, die-hard baseball lovers and not.",1375833600,,304,4.350877192982456
4982404,4,B006BFK4CM,Bought as a xmas gift for a friend. Shipping was fast & that is what I needed.  I haven't heard anything so I assume it worked.,1373241600,,127,3.8846153846153846
4982405,5,B006BFK4CM,"Although a disappointing year for the Giants, this was done well. It highlighted some of the athletes personal life as well.",1360886400,,124,4.9523809523809526
4982406,5,B006BFK4CM,This was such a great purchase! My husband and I just wish that it was longer- we wanted to see more of the footage that they got and we just had so much fun watching it!,1357948800,,170,3.75
4982407,5,B006BFK4CM,I love to watch and relive the world series all over again! It's over 50 yrs since the Giants won the WS! This is a memoribilia for me and my kids down the road.,1356825600,,161,3.764705882352941
4982408,5,B006BFK4CM,Enjoyed the 2 discs so much!  It was nice to go back to 2010 and go behind the scenes with the Giants.  Lots of good laughs too!,1354838400,,128,3.7037037037037037
4982409,5,B006BFK4CM,"Big SF Giants fan, loved this. Can't find on netflix so was happy i could order and keep for my collection",1353888000,3,106,4.095238095238095
4982410,5,B006BFK4CM,"I bought this DVD twice.  Once for my husband and he liked it so much I bought another one for my father.  He loved it.  Both men are life-long Giants fans and, since 2010, so am I!  If you like the SF Giants, you will enjoy this DVD.",1352246400,,234,3.8125
4982411,3,B006BFK4CM,Will only buy when offered in an HD format. Does anyone not have a HD TV at this point? C'mon already!,1352073600,,102,3.9047619047619047
4982412,5,B006BFK4CM,"As far as MLB teams are concerned, I'm a Dodger fan and hate the Giants.  I saw someone post how good this series (""The Franchise"") was so I went ahead and ordered the DVD even though I hate the Giants.

I ended up liking the Franchise - a great look behind the scenes of the players.  It won't mean I will like the Giants, but I do enjoy what the players are like when they aren't in the middle of playing the game.

The slogan could use some fixing - ""A season with the San Francisco Giants"" should have been re-done as ""Most of a season with the San Francisco Giants"".  I hate how the DVD ends with August and doesn't follow the Giants through the end of the season.  Good news is that I remember how their season ended and I'm happy with that result!",1334534400,2,754,4.13013698630137
4982413,5,B006BFK4CM,"I watched this on Showtime and loved it! It was great watching the chemistry between all the players. There were some heart-breaking moments (Buster Posey & Freddie Sanchez) as well as funny moments (joke played on Aubrey Huff). It was nice to see a personal side to the players all of us Giants fans have come to love.

Although I'm not a Marlins fan, I look forward to watching season 2.",1332460800,,389,4.47887323943662
4982414,5,B006BFK4CM,"A season with the San Francisco Giants. Even though the Giants didn't repeat as World Champs this DVD was a great winter time watch. For those of us who love baseball and need a winter time dose this was just right. This DVD showed the inter workings of the clubhouse, homes of some of the individual players. It also showed the players' and their families' thoughts about life in and out of baseball. This DVD showed the devastating injuries that befell the 2011 Giants and what the front office thought and how they tried to work through the adversity. I will give the DVD a thumbs up.",1331424000,9,587,4.4953271028037385
4982415,5,B006BFK4CM,"It's a great DVD and I recommend it not only for San Francisco Giants fans, but for any baseball fan!",1327104000,2,101,4.1
8496044,3,B006BFK4CM,"If you're a Giants fanatic then of course you have to have this.  But if you're a little more sane then you can probably give this a pass.  There are some entertaining moments, and some interesting insights into various players and the team as a whole.  But there is also quite a bit of filler, and it dragged frequently.  Maybe it would have been more interesting if the Giants had been hot that year and were clearly on their way to the World Series, but sadly they were not, and this TV series sputters out as if some network executive had pulled the plug without warning.  Having watched it once, I can't imagine watching it again.",1478476800,,635,4.439655172413793

8496047,1,B006BFK4CM,"Over-produced nonsense. And I'm a huge Giants fan.  I just want the real story, not some hyped-up glossy pulp.  Poor production decisions all around.  Bad editing, narration, music, you name it, it's all bad.  Avoid, and send these productions a message.  We want substance, not gloss.",1445990400,,285,5.108695652173913
8496048,4,B006BFK4CM,Very interesting TV series about the Giants and how difficut it is to repeat as champions.,1436140800,,90,4.6875
8496049,5,B006BFK4CM,"The Franchise: A Season with the San Francisco Giants, exceeded my expectations.  It gave insighst into the workings of a MLB team.  There are places that are hilarious. Iif you like Brian Wilson this is a must.  It focuses on the players and their interaction with each other. I've watched it several times and bought a copy for my grandson, a die hard Wilson fan.  This is timeless and belongs in every fans DVD collection",1425081600,,424,4.613333333333333
8496050,5,B006BFK4CM,This was a great DVD.  It goes behind the scenes of the Giants and gives you never before scene footage of the players.  Its a great watch for any baseball fan out there,1424217600,,169,4.090909090909091

8496053,5,B006BFK4CM,"It's great watching this video again now knowing this franchise was entering its ""Golden Years"" with (at least) another two World Series titles on the way! ;-)  And four of the seven people on the cover are still with ""The Franchise"".  Gonna miss the Panda though.",1418860800,,264,4.717391304347826
