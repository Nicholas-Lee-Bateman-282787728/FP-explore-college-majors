8504880,5,B006V3T9PM,"This DVD is pure awesome. I owned the VHS years ago and over time it was lost. The DVD is put together extremely well and is worth every penny. Raven-Dreamer is one of the most epic rivalries in wrestling history. If you're a fan of ECW, Raven, or Dreamer this DVD is a must own. Don't miss out; I swear you won't be disappointed!!",1451692800,,331,4.1875
8504881,5,B006V3T9PM,"I was pleasantly surprised by most of the video an audio quality as it is a VHS to DVD deal, it was better than I expected. If you are an ECW fan this is a must to have in your collection. The only down side to it is there's no chapters so if you have to stop it you're left searching for the spot you left off at.",1443484800,,314,3.6323529411764706
8504882,4,B006V3T9PM,"After watching RF Video's awesome set on Raven vs. The Sandman, this collection was next on my list. This 6 disc set covers the entire 2 year fued between the two, with all matches, angles, interviews, and fan cam matches included. If your a classic ECW fan, this is a must. Unlike the WWE ECW releases, these matches are unedited, so you'll hear the original music entrances and whatnot. Video quality is good to very good, as these are basically VHS recordings dubbed to DVD. If you're a Raven or Dreamer fan, pick it up!",1393545600,2,523,4.515789473684211
