5886801,4,B00E3G1G46,"On the job takes place in the Philippines where a lot of crimes occur. This movie opened my eyes more and i just saw how corrupt politicians are in Philippines, its a must watch for those who love foreign movies.",1394582400,3,212,4.325
5886802,5,B00E3G1G46,"Very nice movie, a true to life depiction of present day corruption within the government and what's funny is? it is still happening at this very moment.  Corruption is everywhere and is most common on third world countries.",1393718400,5,224,4.894736842105263
5886803,1,B00E3G1G46,There should be a warning on ANY MOVIE that is not in English.  I do not care to watch any show with sub titles.  I would not have rented this had I known it was NOT English speaking.,1393200000,,183,3.789473684210526
5886804,4,B00E3G1G46,"This is a Phillipine film from 2013 that first showed at the Cannes film festival.  Nominally an action-suspense film, it is actually about systemic corruption in the Phillipine government, with the government, military, police and organized crime all in bed with each other.  In that sense, it could probably stand in for a number of other countries around the world.  Oh wait--this isn't supposed to be about the US, is it?

There are a number of principal actors and actresses in it although probably the leading dyads are two male pairs: an older and a junior hit man who work indirectly for a drug lord, and two police: one who married an officers daughter and an older career officer who suspects that hes just as corrupt as everyone at the top.  Also getting screen time are the spouses/girl friends of both killers, the up & coming detectives wife, her father and a politician running for President.

The film runs just short of 2 hours long.  Though most of the dialog is in Tagalog, there are English subtitles and some phrases are in English.  It is moderate on violence, theres virtually no nudity (though brief suggestions of sexual activity), and no drug use.  Also very little swearing [at least in the sub-titles].  For a film with quite a bit of killing involved, it is not excessively gory.  Lastly Ill say this: some of the characters die and some live.  If you DO watch it, just try to figure out which one of the major actors lives to the end.  I give it a B-.",1438041600,,1481,4.585551330798479

5886819,5,B00E3G1G46,"For the price you cant beat. Really good movie, very gritty,brutal and little bit funny.  Reality of corruption and power on any government.",1401667200,2,140,5.086956521739131
5886820,3,B00E3G1G46,"I've seen some number of films set and/or shot in the Philippines but, if I've ever seen one produced there, it was nowhere near this caliber.

Here's the scoop. Two prison inmates routinely ""escape"" prison and perform assassinations. They then re-enter prison so as not to be detected. An upcoming presidential election brings the assassinations into focus. A good cop is brought in on said investigation and the waters get murky and dangerous.

This is way far ahead of any Philippino movie I've ever seen. It's directed more like something out of Hong Kong. The camera work, editing and such are a solid step up from the usual fare. The music score is also very cool. It has a 70's-ish flavor to it. The story is also rather clever. Again, more like a Hong Kong crime thriller.

As good as this is on the face of it, for my dollar, the script could have used a Hollywood sensibility to it. The plot points are there but needed punching up and smoothing out. For instance, there is no clever detective work in finding out who's performing the assassinations. They get the info through an informant. And the political/familial aspect of showing the difficulty the lead investigator has working the case could have been better. Also, said investigator's relationship with the aging sergeant needed work. Hollywood has done this better any number of times. I don't always fly the Hollywood flag but they do this sort of thing really ell. It isn't supposed to be good art. It's good craft and those roads have been well traveled.

This is well worth watching and I'd bet Hollywood IS working on their version. I hope they are and I am interested in seeing the results.",1398902400,,1666,4.714776632302406
5886821,5,B00E3G1G46,"Bought it for my wife who is Phillipino, Good action and great ending. Wont spoil it for you so watch carefully.",1398816000,,112,4.380952380952381
5886822,5,B00E3G1G46,"To be honest I had really low expectations for this movie, as most Filipino action movies are mediocre at best.  However this movie was done amazingly well, and the cast was amazing for this movie. The movie was beautifully shot, definitely on par with most Hollywood action movies.  I highly recommend this to any Asian-movie enthusiasts or action movie fanatics in general.",1396396800,,375,5.032258064516129

8600577,5,B00E3G1G46,"Mario is a hitman and he is getting on in years so has a back up man and that comes in the shape of the much younger Daniel. The thing is they are also both inmates in a not so high security Filipino prison. They work for a mysterious  if ruthless  Madame called Thelma and she works for whoever has the cash to pay for these exclusive services.

They get day release or rather night release to go do their thing. We also have their back stories of how they ended up where they are and what is going on outside the prison confines. No crime story would be complete without some cops  and we have them in spades; they, though, are mainly the sort that fit into the convenient pigeon hole marked corrupt. Enter suave good looking cop Francis Coronel who is connected and he ends up paired with an ageing Sergeant whose career has entered a cul-de sac, but they actually want results.

Now this is a full on thriller with action where needed and performances that evince the gritty realism that some crime films can only dream of. The film has an air of poverty versus wealth running throughout and the corrupt seem to be only separated from the poor by degrees of honesty and bank account balances. To say this is a brilliantly accomplished film is an understatement. In Tagalog and English this is one for those who appreciate World cinema and like their films to be as unflinching as real life can, sadly, be.",1459209600,,1409,4.424710424710424
