8048952,2,B0007MU2YA,Mother always said if you have nothing good to say - don't say it.  Enough said - don't waste your money purchasing this DVD.,1288742400,,125,4.208333333333333
8048953,5,B0007MU2YA,"So, I have never been a fan of workout dvd's because I feel that I do not receive a good workout and it doesn't yield the results I am looking for. Well, Jeanette has turned me into a fan! I first learned of Jeanette Jenkins when Queen Latifah made mention of working with Jeanette and I also heard from several people(who look awesome)that they use Jeanette's dvd's. I am addicted to these dvd's. I am so excited to come home and workout to them because I actually receive a really good workout and it's challenging as well. I am sore the next day which for me is great because I know I received an excellent workout. I also break a sweat with some of the routines. I also love the fact that she guides you on breathing exercises to assist with the exercise routine. They work for me and help me to keep going. Definitely worth it, glad I made this purchase!",1259884800,3,859,4.308641975308642
8048954,5,B0007MU2YA,"These are some good workouts.  A lot of times I find workout DVDs really easy, but these were pretty challenging.  My favorite is the Ab Blast... really good!!!",1225324800,2,160,4.678571428571429
8048955,4,B0007MU2YA,"I used to watch the Hollywood Trainers show on cable Lifetime channel and was disappointed when the show was discontinued, so I decided to find any tapes that might be available on line.  I was happy to find the 7 DVD set sold by Amazon.  It works for me.  It provides a good workout in different areas - abs, yoga, pilates, cardio, etc.  Since I have worked out all my adult life I find them more challenging than the usual lite workouts for mature adults.  Jeanette Jenkins is upbeat and does pretty well in guiding you through the exercises, letting you know that you should take a break if you need it, not to work through pain, etc.  It's a good deal for the price.  I'm satisfied!",1202428800,4,686,4.354330708661418
8048956,5,B0007MU2YA,I have tried 5 out of the 7 so far and they really give me a workout.  No confusing dance routines.  I tried them for about 10 days and saw dramatic results.  Jeanette will certainly challenge you and get you in shape.  You should give it a try and you will see what I'm talking about.,1192060800,10,285,4.035714285714286
