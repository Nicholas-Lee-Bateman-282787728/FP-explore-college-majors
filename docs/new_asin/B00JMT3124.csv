8652507,4,B00JMT3124,"(Film buff and Kimberly Elise fan here.)  Ghanaian-born director Leila Djansi's award-winning 3rd feature film starts low-key, on a modest but adequate budget, with a doctor posted to a village clinic that is far from city life and badly needing repair; meeting an old classmate; contending with locals uneasy without traditional fears, beliefs and folk remedies; sorting out her troubled relationship, with help from new friend Kimberly Elise, expatriate American anthropologist; trying to make a difference.

This is before the main subject comes, harrowing most of the characters with the rawest pain most woman could face: loss of children -- here, in several ways and with different consequences, each more heartbreaking than the last, put across with shattering grief from some perfect actresses.

That said, do not be put off: these women have survived by compartmentalizing, even burying, their miseries and pushing on, ultimately toward confronting their reverses, and with hope.  The tone shift is welcome (it even includes a brief comedy-club scene); and reflects life as most people live it, with few really prepared to let their lives fall completely apart.  This story is well worth telling, especially to Westerners, so that we may recognize kinship across what separates us, after starting in a foreign place and culture where we feel like safe spectators; Elise teases her local friends for readiness to believe in ghosts, and will wear African garb while everyone else is in Western dress.  And don't imagine we can sneer at the harsher local values seen here -- not today, with a growing cohort abandoning traditional American beliefs in science and progress (remember that word?) and going all in with rumor, political superstition, and rage.  Only details differ; the dynamics don't.

(For those who care, the two minor white characters are both good guys.)

(My not giving 5 stars reflects nothing wrong with the film, only a very high bar.  I save 5-star reviews for absolutely world-class artistic masterpieces, such as Julie Dash's Daughters of the Dust, Michael Radford's version of The Merchant of Venice, Federico Fellini's La Dolce Vita, etc., etc.  I look forward to acquainting myself with more of Leila Djansi's work.)",1494806400,,2250,5.256983240223463
