8425367,3,B004DJ1JX6,"""Hillbilly Bloodbath"" and ""Red River"" are the same film. In fact the actual ""Hillbilly Bloodbath"" DVD says ""Red River"" on it and the film hasn't changed any titles.

Roland (Dave Haney) speaks through a voice box microphone and has deformed son. He is religious and kills people, mostly women whose tops go missing. Kids go camping in the woods...and need I say more?

Filmed in Kentucky on a low budget featuring locals. The movie is campy and bloody. Bad acting, some intentional, some not. Tucky Williams as Ranger Darcy ab lib her own lines...campy but entertaining.

Beautiful topless coeds ?  Yep.  If you liked Wrong Turn, or any of the killer in the woods genre, you'll at least like this.  Give it a try.",1334188800,,316,3.967741935483871

8425372,4,B004DJ1JX6,"is Red River a low budget movie? yes
is Red River a good movie ?  YES
This is a sharp little movie set in the back woods from director Jacob Ennis, I admit this is the first film from this director I've seen, it might be his first and it might not. but as far as a low budget films goes he's on the right track. he has taken a low budget
and turned out quite a good flick. It does not remind me of any horror movies I've seen, (and I'm a rabid horror fan) it holds it's on
without ripping off other films. The acting is good, the camera work is good, editing, soundtrack, special effects all work together to
make this film work. All the actors are very good, and do a great job! (my fave being Jackey Hall (Cyborge Conquest,Chainsaw Cheeleaders, Swamp Creek) she's a fine actress and a wonderful person. All in all this is not a dust collector, was it worth the
$14.95 ?, yes, will I watch it again?, yes! as far as low budget movies goes this is at the top of my list. I think anybody who
watches it won't be disapointed. If Jacob Ennis ever gets a big budget to work with, Watch out! a **** movie, Catch it if you can!!",1296864000,9,1122,4.054054054054054
