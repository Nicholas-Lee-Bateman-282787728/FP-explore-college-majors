8631957,5,B00HENYA2K,"This limited edition DVD was finally released in 2012, The DVD entitled ""Pay Up Cheaters! The Story of the Beat Farmers"" traces the history of one of the most historic bar bands to ever grace a stage. Drawing on the huge personality of Country Dick Montana (who sadly was lost to a heart attack at age 40 on stage in November 8, 1995), the Beat Farmers created a musical pleasure ride that will never be duplicated. The DVD is available at the Country Dick Montana website and is in very limited supplies.

From their first musical ""experimentations"" on customers at the Spring Valley Inn in 1983 to the end of the band in 1995, this one and only full-length documentary blends archival footage and television appearances with new interviews and clips from the band's 20th Anniversary Reunion Concert held in 2003 at the Coach House in Southern California.

The documentary includes interviews from the likes of Mojo Nixon, Dwight Yoakam, Harry Shearer (Spinal Tap, The Simpsons), Dave Alvin, Steve Berlin, Johnette Napolitano (Concrete Blonde), Peter Case, Dennis Diken, and the one and only Dr. Demento.

If you are actually reading this review, you are probably a fan. If you saw their live shows, this DVD will bring back many memories. If you never had the chance to see the Beat Farmers perform, then this DVD is a unique experience into the band and will make you aware of the giant musical talent that was on stage. This band was one of a kind. To have 3 people in a band that can step up to the microphone and carry a song in front of an audience is unheard of. The twin guitar sound that Jerry Raney and Joey Harris made was outstanding. Great songwriting followed up by great musicianship.

I took a friend who was the lead singer and songwriter from a band  to see the Beat Farmers. He thought that they were going to be a fun, novelty type of show and was looking forward to having a few beers and enjoying the night. After the show, he told me that the Beat Farmers were one of the tightest bands he ever saw and that they were amazingly talented. As you know, musicians are the harshest critics. I will always recall that evening because it validated what I felt as a non-musician- the Beat Farmers were a GREAT LIVE BAND. PERIOD!

To all those  fellow maggots - have a shot of Jgermeister for Dick! Enjoy this DVD!",1387324800,7,2330,4.559808612440191
