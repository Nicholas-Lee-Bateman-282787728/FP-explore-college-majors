7690356,5,B01CUMITSA,"Very beautiful film, great cast!  Adams Greaves Neal is most convincing as the young Messiah.  Sara Lazaro is equally convincing as the Virgin Mary and the actor playing St. Joseph conveys the strength that a good father must have in caring for and defending his family.  Yes, the violence by the Romans may not be suitable for very young children but it is not gratuitus like so, so, many films these days and is entirely plausible.  I am not ashamed to say that the beauty of the film brought tears to my eyes and a good deal of reflection. I would love to see it again in blu-ray.",1461283200,63,583,4.37037037037037
7690357,1,B01CUMITSA,Gnostic from start to finish - Infancy Gospel of Jesus Christ and such.  It does show the root of some of the heretical teachings of the catholic church.  Nothing of Christian value in this movie.,1460851200,11,196,4.571428571428571
7690358,5,B01CUMITSA,"Best ""current"" movie on Jesus that I've seen. It's a good way to introduce children to Christ IMO.
With satan as on of the cast always dogging Jesus and killing a boy making Jesus look responsible.
As a teenager myself, always being blamed for everything that went wrong I really liked this movie.
Praise Jesus!",1459209600,38,311,4.672727272727273
7690359,4,B01CUMITSA,"Tells the story of Jesus as a youth. While in Egypt Evil Incarnate follows him, he does some miracles. (?)

Due to a dream it is learned that Herod the Great has died so they plan to return to Israel, chronicles their trip and the events surrounding them. Jesus wants to know more about his life (see 'Superman The Movie' to compare as his parents are tight-lipped.)

Herod JR has heard of a young boy about seven doing miracles and sends a centurian out to find the lad. A different angle is taken on his trip to the temple where he faces off with the solider. Insightful, filmed in Italy, al the characters speak in British accents. Watchable.",1459123200,22,645,4.4576271186440675
7690360,5,B01CUMITSA,"Wonderful movie. Based on a novel written by ""Vampire Chronicles"" author Anne Rice, we the audience are taken on a journey of destiny and mercy starting in Egypt and ending in Palestine.

 A young Christ goes through his youthful trials & errors, realizing his family needs to return home to Palestine when word of King Herod Antipas's death hits Cairo.  Youngster Jesus and his family go through a series of dangerous pearls on the journey home, as actor Sean Bean (Patriot Games, Sharpe's Challenge, Game of Thrones, & Lord of the Rings) commands a Roman legion assigned to serve Herod's disgusting corrupt son in a vicious campaign to hunt Jesus down.  Many are condemned along the way as the boy finds his holy calling to the temple in Jerusalem, where a leading Rabbi along with a blind wise man realize the child is more significant and special then other boys his age.

 Anne Rice's stories always seem to enjoy providing us integrate details on characters based on witch, or Demonic imagery. For if you are a fellow fan of ""Interview with a Vampire"", one will recognize very similar themes exhibited in her warlock depiction of Lucifer.

 So far this film at least for me has been the best I have seen in 2016, for so many numerous reasons but one solid rock of the movie is both the young English boy actor who plays Jesus, and veteran actor of excellence Sean Bean in one of his best performances since ""Patriot Games"" & ""Thrones"".

 With the exception of the brutal ancient Roman violence depicted in the movie, I would have rather given this movie a G rating because it's simply a film kids, teens, and adults throughout American society really should see.  no other movie or show in my memory has depicted a tale of Christ's boyhood, for in tradition we go from the Christmas Nativity birth in Bethlehem with the trip to Cairo, and skip to his 30's where he is baptized by John (Ultimately where the Gospel of Mark begins).

Movies and tv shows that display scenes that provoke both thought, historical Biblical insight, and deeper emotional appeal seem to lack drastically compared with the more popular art of the modern era.  Teens and adults who are fans of Anne Rice should see both ""Interview with a Vampire"" and this movie, because so far these are the best adaptations of her novels, despite the huge time gap between them (& just skip ""Queen of the Damned"" which was horrible).

 I give this film my absolute highest rating with an A+ & two big thumbs up.",1459036800,62,2477,4.64908256880734

7690364,5,B01CUMITSA,"I could watch this over & over. I'm not religious, & to be honest , I only watched it because of Anne Rice. BUT, it's a great film! It made me feel good. The production quality & casting is fantastic...coming from someone who grew up in & around the entertainment industry. It's a realistic setting and view of what it might have been like for Jesus as a child. The little actor who plays Jesus is so beautiful and a really good actor! I like that it was not trying to convert anyone. It's a simple, mostly non violent, happy but exciting, look into the life in that part of the world. I wish there would be another one just like it... a sequel.",1534118400,,645,4.209677419354839

7690386,5,B01CUMITSA,"What an amazing movie! What got me was how well it was acted. Yes, by the young lad who plays Jesus, truly he has to be a future huge star, but also by every single person in it! They all did such a wonderful job, and it was like you were watching real events in people's lives back in time. I don't know how well it did at theaters, and I don't care!

7690389,3,B01CUMITSA,"This is an interesting take on Christ. I enjoyed the relationship between young Christ and the Virgin Mary best. Historical insight into the Roman persecution of the Jews was another plus point in this film, even though it isn't a historic epic, the Jewish persecution in Rome shown is based on real history. I liked the way they made Jesus and his family look Jewish, with brown eyes and brunette hair, while the version of Lucifer shown in the film looked like a velvet painting of the blonde haired, blue-eyed Jesus which we know looks nothing like what Jesus or any Jew of that era would have looked like. The Lucifer in this movie is understated and terrifying. The pacing was a little slow.",1523836800,,696,4.620967741935484

7690407,3,B01CUMITSA,"This film was very interesting purely for entertainment value. I would never recommend it for learning about the Life of Christ. While entertaining, and interesting, none of it can be based on Biblical fact. It is not backed up by scripture. So take everything with a hefty grain of salt.

While it probably held true to the violent times of Roman occupation during Jesus' life, I didn't anticipate that it would be this upsetting of a movie to watch with a young child.",1515283200,,455,4.481927710843373

7690426,5,B01CUMITSA,this is such a beautifully written movie. I enjoyed ever bit of this movie from beginning to end and have always imagined what Christs life was like as a child - this is a beautiful portrayal of that.,1512000000,2,200,4.2894736842105265
7690427,4,B01CUMITSA,"Many films based on the various Gospels simply fail. There is little in the way of suspense or plot development and, thanks in large part to the writers and the directors, the actors are often too stiff and wooden. Many movies based on the Gospels try too hard to play it safe and end up being, at best, underwhelming.

The Young Messiah avoids this trap. Based on Anne Rices Christ the Lord: Out of Egypt"" Cyrus Nowrasteh co-wrote the film with Betsy Giffen Nowrasteh and he also directed it. The film focuses on Jesus as a child, mostly avoiding scenes from the Gospels and showing how the Holy Family returned from Egypt and tried to adjust to life in Nazareth. All the while, young Jesus tries to uncover the mystery of His birth and why the family had to flee Bethlehem. The film adds more supernatural elements than the book, including giving Satan an expanded role (yes, you read that right, the movie has more supernatural elements than Anne Rice of all people included) and taking the focus away from Jesus extended family (including some nice scenes with a young John the Baptist). The movie also adds a more immediate danger with Sean Bean playing a Roman centurion with orders to make sure the Christ child is dead.

While it does not hit a home run, The Young Messiah gets on base. It keeps the viewers interest and follows enough of Rices book to offer a nice compliment to the Gospels without actually portraying them. The cast is excellent with Bean excelling as a soldier torn between his duty and his conscience. Adam Greaves-Neal does a fine job as the young Jesus while Vincent Walsh and Sara  Lazzaro do solid work as Joseph and Mary. Christian McKay is up to his usual high standard as Cleopas (admittedly, one of the best characters from Rices book) while Jane Lapotaire is charming as Sarah. Fans of the great 1980s Sherlock Holmes show will be happy to see David Burke in a nice cameo. The Italian scenery certainly works for this movie. The directing is solid if unspectacular.

The Young Messiah didn't exactly shine at the box office which is unfortunate. This is one of the better biblical themed (if not based) movies in recent memory and is worth rolling the dice on. I would give this film 4.25 stars if possible. Recommended.",1510272000,,2258,4.6375

are shown, as well as the evil that follows him.

7690450,2,B01CUMITSA,Very disappointed with this movie. It did not follow the bible. They portrayed Jesus as a pitiful kid. I couldn't even finish watching it,1501372800,,137,4.75

7690453,5,B01CUMITSA,Totally awesome movie!,1499990400,,22,6.666666666666667
7690454,2,B01CUMITSA,Here is a movie based purely on a man's imagination. If we were supposed to know about Jesus as a young boy and man then it would be recorded in the Bible. Christians should avoid movies like these as they are using the Lord as a means to make movie off of Christians. Apart from it being unsupported by scripture it is also poorly acted and over the top dramatics. Christian movies have come a long way and some are very good but this is not in that group.,1499644800,,457,4.146067415730337
7690455,5,B01CUMITSA,"I understand that this is a completely fictional portrayal of a time when little is known about the life of Jesus, but the movie is thought provoking.  What happens in the life of a perfect child?  Is that child curious or energetic or protective or adventuresome or .  .  .  .  I enjoyed the beautiful photography and the sets which gave me insight into the conditions of the time.",1499472000,,382,4.463768115942029
7690456,5,B01CUMITSA,"I was so surprised by this one, since it covers a portion of Jesus' life that is largely undocumented.  The filmmaker manages to make it inspiring and uplifting without resorting to crazy miracles.  Jesus begins to learn His history and who he is.  Highly recommended",1499299200,,267,4.888888888888889

7690464,1,B01CUMITSA,"Heretical and biblically inaccurate, does not line up with the character and nature of Jesus Christ as reprinted in the word of God. A complete waste of time and money. Did not watch more than 20 minutes of this awful movie because it was so bad.",1495756800,11,246,4.369565217391305
7690465,5,B01CUMITSA,"This film relies on biblical fact and adds imagination to guess what it might have been like to live with the 7-year-old Jesus.  It even imagines what the 7-year-old Jesus might have felt and thought.  I loved the movie because it showed how God might have grown the baby Jesus into the knowledge of who he really was.  It shows how God might have made Jesus just live the  human experience and yet, still remain pure, good and wonderfully himself.  The film shows the little Jesus hurt and a little confused by human evil, by satan's appearances and even by his own powers.  It shows how Joseph and Mary stumble around trying their best to figure out how to tell him who he really is vs. allowing God to do it in his own time. It also delves into the possible relationship little Jesus might have had with his brother James.  I won't spoil the movie for you, but it relies on scripture that relates the fact that during adult Jesus' early ministry, all Jesus' brothers were embarrassed of him and wanted him to leave their home.  And yet, we know that James, one of his brothers, ends up writing two of the most beautiful and powerful books of the Bible.  This film spends a good deal of time showing how this type of relationship might have developed between the two boys when they were little and why.  I think most people who love Jesus wonder what it must have been like for Mary and Joseph to have raised him. Non-offensive to Christians.  A truly wonderful and respectful treatment of this subject that anyone would enjoy.",1495411200,,1529,4.503623188405797
7690466,5,B01CUMITSA,"I tend to like ""clean"" movies, but Christian movies are tricky because they're so often cheesey. I mean I'm a drama buff so I don't like bad cinema.

7690467,5,B01CUMITSA,"A gem!  This little movie is one of the most excellent of its genre.  It stays generally true to Scripture (actually fewer departures than other movies of its kind) and it can be viewed by any family without fear of what will be encountered-- children as young as five can certainly understand part of the message, while everyone older will go away having gained a great deal.  The acting is quite good, historical verisimilitude has been maintained, and the treatment of the character of Satan is innovative but true to Christian belief.",1494547200,,538,4.826086956521739

7690471,1,B01CUMITSA,"I only watched 15 to 20 minutes and gave up on the movie. It does not begin to match scripture. Yes, Jesus is 100% human, but He's also 100% God. He is all knowing, so nobody needed to explain anything to Him! The Bible clearly describes the beginning of His ministry and miracles, and they did not happen as a child. There is clearly plenty I don't know, but this movie will misinform people. The truth is twisted every day. We don't need movies like this twisting it further!",1493424000,7,477,4.370786516853933

7690473,4,B01CUMITSA,This was a great movie.  I will watch this one again.  What I wanted to see was a happy little boy growing up with beautiful and caring parents.

7690480,5,B01CUMITSA,"I was excited to add this to my video collection especially since I wanted very badly to see it, yet our local cinema chose not to show it.  It was very well produced.  Scripture doesn't give much hint as to the childhood of Jesus, so it's left to us to imagine it, based on His humanity/divinity.  This adaptation does not disappoint.",1490745600,,335,4.459016393442623
7690481,5,B01CUMITSA,"Intriguing movie about Christ when he was a young child. It seemed to be based on some historical facts, like the slaughter of infants after Christ was born and the persecution of Christians in Rome.
  The acting and script were excellent. It was film in Italy. So the setting seemed realist. Loved seeing Sean Bean who was a Roman soldier in this movie. The little boy who played Jesus was superb. He could even stand up to Sean's acting abilities.
  Usually I can't wait for a movie to end, but with this movie, I didn't want it to end.  I usually don't read fiction but maybe I will read Anne Rice's book. The movie was based on her book. She became a Christian after she wrote her vampire books.

7690489,3,B01CUMITSA,"While an enjoyable movie, very well done, and not directly in conflict with how I would envision the young Jesus from what we do actually know,
this has to be described as a work of fiction.  That being said, I don't know how I feel about it.  I was a little freaked out by the 'Prince of Darkness' character and wish he was not included.  Prior to watching I didn't know it was Anne Rice inspired but when I found out it made sense.
I must say I did enjoy it and am a great fan of 'Risen' which is also a work of fiction but has a special something to it that has made it a favorite.  It is very difficult to find movies on this subject that are up to par.  For that reason, you can enjoy this one as long as you don't take it as fact and have no qualms with Anne Rice's hand in it.  I probably won't watch it again myself.",1489449600,3,824,3.904191616766467

7690542,5,B01CUMITSA,Wonderful depiction. Insightful and inspiring.,1483228800,,46,8.4
7690543,1,B01CUMITSA,"What a waste of money. I watched this movie after someone insisted that it was the best movie ever and a very touching documentary on Jesuss early years in life.
This movie has nothing to do with the truth depicted in the Bible, as most of it is altered and made fiction.

First of all, Jesus Christ is presented here as a 7  year old kid, who is already a miracle worker and continues to be followed and threatened with death by the romans that are instigated by the son of Herod to Great.

Secondly this movie came up with the idea, to present Jesus Christ, as if he is still yet to discover who he is and also that he continuously persuades his mother Mary and some cousin James to tell him who he is and why he is a miracle worker. Toward the end of the movie, followed by some emotional pressure and pity for the clueless child, Mary is making a huge effort to tell young Messiah about his miraculous birth and how he is the son of God.

Thats not what the Bible teaches. Jesus Christ, who is the King of Glory, Son of the Most High God, Creator of the Universe and the Lamb who was slain from the creation of the world, (Revelation 13:8), this meaning that all that was prophesied about Him in the Old Testament, was foretold and planned in detail, for God knew when he created mankind that it would not be capable to stand on its own, but fail, therefore the plan of salvation was laid out in detail with the purpose of Jesus Christ incarnation and specifically lay down his life. Now given that fact, its obvious the young Messiah knew all along whom he was and what he came for.

For those that want the truth, the Scripture is very precise even about the childhood of Christ, which is depicted in the messianic Psalm 69.
- Verse 1and 2, His consciousness of the conception in the womb of Mary
- Verse 3 His infancy,
- First part of verse 4 outlines his fleeing to Egypt for King Herod the Great wants to kill him, the second part of Verse 4 Jesuss sadness is expressed for his poor family, which has to use the gifts they received from the Magi and pay the costly trip to Egypt,
- Verse 5 tells of early childhood, as Jesus undergoes the inability to act and talk like who he really is, but humbly plays and acts, as the pears of his age,
- Verse 6, He continuously intercedes to the Father for the humanity he came to save and that He might keep humble and wait until its the right time to reveal his mission and purpose
- Verse 7, Him very conscious of becoming human in order to do Gods will and fulfill the purpose of salvation.
- Verse 8, Jesus the young child despised by his own family, as to the mystery of his birth and rumors of false accusations, see John 8:41,
- Verse 9, His trip to Jerusalem and the Temple, at the age of 12.
- Verses 10 through 12, His adolescence, whereby he is being, obedient, prayerful, fasting and not giving heed to the scoffing of his birth legitimacy, see Mark 6:3 and John 8:41,
- Verse 13 through 16, Jesuss ministry at the age of 30 through 33 1/2 to bring the truth of His salvation and his continues prayer to the Father to be prevented of a premature death during his ministry, as Gods plan was the cross, for it had to be shedding of blood for the remission of sins and not pushed off a cliff, see Luke 4:29.
- Verse 17 through 21, His suffering and crucifixion
- Verse 22 through 28, His death and taking dominion over the kingdom of darkness
- Verse 29 through 31, His resurrection
- Verse 32 through 36, the fruitful results, where a multitude of people receiving forgiveness, salvation, healing and eternal life through the sacrifice of Jesus Christ.

Last but not least, if you are wondering, why the Scripture does not provide more details about the childhood of Jesus Christ, its because God the Father chose to do so by purpose, for the Gospel is the essence, so you and I would have a chance for forgiveness and eternal life. He was delivered over to death for our sins and was raised to life for our justification (Rom. 4:25)",1483142400,3,3992,4.287798408488063

7690545,1,B01CUMITSA,I'm only 15 minutes into the movie and can already see that it's not biblical...... It's just giving me a weird vibe and I don't have the desire to finish it.  I'm finding it slightly offensive actually.  But I'm very sensitive when it comes to things not lining up with scripture.  If that does not matter to you then you may enjoy this kind of movie....  I'm going to pass... .  Only out $2 for the rental so no biggie.,1483056000,6,421,4.2125

I guess I never really imagined what His life was like as a child because the Bible doesn't say much about that time of His life. This movie stays true to the Word of God and gives us a glimpse into what 7-year old Jesus' life might have been like and what He might have experienced during His time as a child.

7690556,2,B01CUMITSA,"We rented this movie before buying. While the cinematography was great, it started out with a lttle girl drawing paramids (triangles) in the dirt--there is lots of hidden imagery.  Satan's spirit lurking around incidences,  a half eaten apple (false doctrine imposed) tripping a troubled boy who fell and subsequently died, Jesus being blamed.  While I don't expect warm and fuzzy in spiritual warfare to be depicted, I felt they took alot of freedom and crossed doctrinal lines. A snake stabed and struggling about 15 minutes in, confirmed for us to shut it off.",1482624000,,563,5.032258064516129
7690557,5,B01CUMITSA,"I went into this movie with a lot of doubts about what it was going to be. It was one of those ""Here's another Jesus flick to capitalize on people's faith"". About 10 minutes into the movie I got a feeling that this wasn't your garden variety ""Jesus flick"". Even thought they took some liberties from the Bible, and changed a couple of things I was very impressed. I also did not know how true they were going to stay to Anne Rices book. One thing I was very upset about was the promotion of the movie didn't mention that it was based on her novel ""Christ the lord out of Egypt"". I understood what they were doing, but still didn't agree with it. I really did enjoy this movie greatly especially the casting of a young Jesus. I would recommend this movie to everyone as it is a great story told without being too ""Preachy"".",1482192000,,822,4.2756410256410255

7690583,5,B01CUMITSA,"Beautiful and imaginative, yet very true to the underpinnings which tell us that Jesus Christ is the Messiah and the Son of God. For believers this is a touching film - touching the human heart strings since it deals with a very unusual young child and how he grows up among the good and bad. I found an undercurrent among the most beautiful currents in this film: What does your Mother and Father tell you when you are the Son of God? The need for parents to answer questions persist even in the case of the Son of God...this Movie balances the divine and human aspects of Jesus in a very delicate and convincing way. Mary and Joseph see the reason for their existence in their child - even though Joseph understands that this child is not really his - but is God's own Son. In the final analysis, and on another level,  is this not true for us all who are Parents: Our children are on loan from God...and this child is the only one able to put the human race back together again.

It's not that I feel it is remarkably accurate, but then, how is one to know exactly what happened to him during that time.  It doesn't fly in the face of my own ideas, yet it doesn't completely satisfy, either.  It doesn't bother my own beliefs too much.  I am so glad for Sean Bean's presence in the film.  To demonstrate my own vanity, I had said to my husband at the end of the movie that it was a good thing he had been in it; otherwise it would not have carried the weight the movie needed--at least in my own eyes.  I was quite moved by his performance.  The innocence of the boy who played the Young Messiah was beautiful, he had a purity to his presence that seemed to fit to well.

I think this is one of the best films ever made about the infancy of Jesus.  I believe that there are writings out there about the child Jesus that were more of tall tales or legends, or accounts full of minor miracles on which this film might be based. If it was so, they producers did a great job putting a story line that could be credible.  The Young Messiah is well done from the cinematographic point of view.

7690649,2,B01CUMITSA,"The cinematography and acting in this movie are good. The plot takes a lot of liberty, a fine thing as long as it serves to bring out the essence of the characters and story (Jesus of Nazareth, for example, does a great job of employing creative imagination while respecting the scriptures). But a lot of the action in this movie felt gratuitous and left me feeling flat. In the end, I had spent some time watching a story about Christ, there were some interesting scenes depicting what must have been difficult years raising Jesus in a hostile environment and his parents trying to feel their way through the daunting task of raising the Son of God, but the film had not left me elevated in any way.

I came to this film because I found the trailers to be absolutely extraordinary. But the movie falls far short of their promise. Considering some of her real-life statements in the political realm, this will probably be the last Anne Rice project I will exercise any interest in.",1472169600,,981,4.605714285714286

But most importantly,  as a Christian believer,  this movie was very moving  and  very emotional.  If you liked Child Jesus in that classic movie,  Jesus of  Nazareth,  well,  this movie should be a very good experience for you.  The young actor who plays child Jesus is really amazing.

7690662,5,B01CUMITSA,"The Young Messiah (2016). Rated PG-13. Single-Disc. Running Time: One hour, 50 mins.
From Focus Features, Ocean Blue Entertainment and 1492 Pictures.
Directed by Cyrus Nowrasteh. Written by Cyrus Nowrasteh and Betsy Giffen Nowrasteh.
Based upon the novel, Christ the Lord: Out of Egypt, by Anne Rice.

This is an imagined story of one year in the life of Jesus at the age of 7.

This movie begins with the child, Jesus (Adam Greaves-Neal), at the age of 7, as he is with the girl Salome (Lois Ellington), whom is teaching him about animals by drawing in the dirt, but Jesus is keeping a watchful eye on three boys, especially Eleazer (Jacopo Alaimo), the bad child. A man with blond hair (Rory Keenan) eating an apple watches on.
  Eleazer bothers Jesus about ""playing with girls"" and then beats up on him. Salome beats Eleazer with a stick to get him off of Jesus, then Eleazer goes after Salome. Jesus tells him not to touch her. The Demon throws the apple purposely on the ground and Eleazer slips on it and he hits his head on a stone in the ground. He is dead. The demon persuades an older boy to say Jesus killed the boy. This news spreads throughout the village of Alexandria.
  Later, Salome remembers when Jesus brought a dead bird from the sea, held it in his hands and brought it back to life.
  Jesus sneaks in to see the dead body of Eleazer in the parent's home. He touches the face of Eleazer and tells him to ""wake up"". The father catches Jesus and tells him to leave, but suddenly the dead boy opens his eyes and then starts beating on Jesus again.
Joseph (Vincent Walsh) decides it is time for his family to leave Alexandria and go back to Galilee. Herod is dead.

Also in the cast: Sara Lazzaro, Finn Ireland, Sean Bean, Christian McKay, Jane Lapotaire, Clive Russell, Jonathan Bailey, David Burke, Lee Boardman.

Option of Language: English, Spanish, Descriptive Video Service.
Option of Subtitles: English SDH, Spanish, French.

Bonus: The Making of The Young Messiah. Feature Commentary.

Wonderful movie and it did not offend me in anyway. Little is told about Jesus as a child and the Holy Bible (King James Version)  tells us Jesus did not perform any miracles until his adulthood when he was in Nazareth. His first miracle was transforming water into wine for a wedding feast.
  However, I did enjoy this thoughtful story written by Anne Rice and whom is to say there may be some truth to it?  This movie was carefully written.",1471219200,,2504,4.64172335600907

7690708,3,B01CUMITSA,"Well, since this is a fictional movie, it has some good scenes in it. This is someone's imagination as to how Jesus Christ lived on this earth, but it's just that; a person's imagination. God has chosen to leave out His Son's childhood and teenage years in scripture for a reason, however, we get SO much information of His ministry, miracles and Magnificence as our Lord and Saviour! I was looking forward to watching this movie, BUT, I knew it was not based on actual events, so I went knowing that. The movie was okay, but not what I expected. The boy was awfully cute, though.",1469923200,,580,4.481132075471698
7690709,4,B01CUMITSA,"We have no way of knowing anything about the life of Jesus as a boy. But we can of course speculate about what his life might have been like. And that is what this movie does. Many of the events in this movie may have happened the way is was imagined. We don't know that they did not. And some of these things rang true for me. I think Jesus did grow in wisdom and that he grew to the realization of who he was. The movie does a good job of portraying this as Jesus interprets the events happening around him in his boyhood. I do think however when Jesus arrived in Jerusalem as a boy and spoke to the scribes and doctors of the law he then had complete awareness of his mission. That was my only real difference with this movie and that is just my interpretation. The acting was good, the musical score was excellent. I enjoyed the movie and would recommend it.",1469923200,,862,4.167664670658683
7690710,3,B01CUMITSA,This film was well done but not very uplifting. After watching Jesus of Nazareth (directed  by Franco Zeffirelli) all the Jesus films are disappointing. Jesus of Nazareth is truly the greatest film ever made about the life of Christ.,1469923200,5,233,4.9743589743589745
7690711,4,B01CUMITSA,The only reason I gave this a four-star is because it didn't follow the Bible accordingly .Christ did not go to the temple until he was 12yrs old. I know this could not have been hit the real life of Christ but it should've been according to the Bible . It was very good acting extremely good acting . I found no need to squabble over that . The little boy played perfect portray of what we would imagine Jesus would've looked like a child and I realize you only had him until he was seven years old that I was surprised when he had him going to the temple at seven.,1469923200,,566,4.0625

7690713,5,B01CUMITSA,"Extremely well done.  Great acting.  Young Jesus was believable as was the story.  There is a lot we don't know about Christ as a child and this really made you think about how it may have been for him, and for Joseph and Mary.",1469923200,,227,4.113636363636363
7690714,3,B01CUMITSA,"I liked this movie. It was well done and the filming was beautiful. Jesus, as a child, does miracles throughout. The conflict in the movie seems to revolve around when his parents should tell him he is the son of God.  This reminded me of ""Smallville,"" where the Kents have to decide when and how to tell Clark who he really is. It does raise a question, however, which is wouldn't the son of God already know who he is? I believe he would have known.",1469923200,,451,4.244186046511628
7690715,5,B01CUMITSA,It was a very inspirational movie that I found moving in the Bible scriptures used to add reality to the story posed,1469664000,,116,4.318181818181818
7690716,4,B01CUMITSA,"Very personal insight into the life of Jesus as a child. While much of it may not be 'Biblically correct' (he did not perform His first miracle until at his Holy Mother's request at the Wedding at Cana), but it does provide good food for thought.

If I were to criticize the Actors, we are always perplexed as to why primarily Actors with British accents are used when, of course, that would not have been the case at all during the time of Jesus. It's quite maddening at times to see this type of portrayal frequently in movies about the life of Christ.

However, the blood, sweat and tears (years) put into this production are obvious in the way the Holy Family is portrayed and how Our Blessed Mother Mary and Saint Joseph dote on their only child Jesus. It extremely touching and endearing to watch and would highly recommend this film especially to families with young children. I believe it would help them gain a whole new perspective on the 'mystery of Jesus'.",1469664000,5,968,4.557471264367816

7690720,5,B01CUMITSA,"I was skeptical at first of a movie about The Lord Jesus Christ as a child. There is not much biblical basis for a factual representation of his childhood. But happily, this movie  wonderfully  and skillfully depicted what the early  life of Jesus  may have been like, at least  for a small portion of the time. It was honest and accurate biblically  in many ways, including family life, Jewish tradition, Jewish law, customs and  lifestyles, yet had enough emotional connection and intrigue to keep me entertained. In my opinion, it was a great movie, a great message and a thought provoking educational experience. I will  watch  this movie again and recommend it to all.",1469491200,3,673,4.833333333333333

I did like this movie because it is not very lengthy and love how it shows Jesus as a young smiling and at times funny, regular little boy. My 8 year old daughter loved it. I think sometimes society makes it hard for children to see Jesus as a child and just like any other child or boy but with a real exceptional spiritual walk through life. It is worth seeing and held my attention. I have to really be liking a movie pretty much to sit through the whole thing. I did watch this from start to end.

7690755,1,B01CUMITSA,"The Bible clearly states only a little background on Jesus childhood, and what He did as a boy. However, how these movie writers portrayed  young Jesus, blew me away. The script had the boy play as if he knew how to talk to the elders in the church, answer all of their questions one minute, and in another segment, the writers had the boy act confused about who he was, and why was he here? Asking his mother! In the Bible, Jesus tells His mother ""He must be about His father's business."" And, the first lie in the film, young Jesus so-called healed a bird, and a few other people. Hm!

James is presented as an set brother which might seems controversial hinting at the fact that Joseph and Mary had other children.

And as a Bible believing Christian, I found much of it to be blasphemous at times and offensive at others.  Some folks don't care about such things, but I do.  However, I only deduct one star for this reason.  The other three star deduction is explained above.

In the end, the only thing this movie serves to accomplish is to breed confusion and misinformation about Jesus Christ into the minds of unwary viewers.  It certainly did not serve to entertain.",1468540800,15,726,4.550387596899225

7690785,5,B01CUMITSA,"Great movie. Good casting. Good script. Good directing. Great music. Good costumes. Please more more more of the same. Hoping for a sequel. Rich teachings within the movie...even though the young life before He was 30 years of age was never recorded in the gospels with the exceptions of the narrative of His birth and  where it is written in the gospels of His parents finding Him in the temple. Other than that it is a fictional novel...But to me not really...with all we know about Christ in the gospels...they infused it into the child of Jesus in the movie. Each time something would happen within those times that are not written in scripture...i would say to myself...its possible! We do that all the time while reading the regular gospels ...for God is always challenging us with one question: ""Do You Believe its Possible?"" This movie is good for one reason ....especially...its that it stirs your imagination and faith in God. And that's good when a movie does that. . If it means anything.... I got chills three times and cried once. I got a couple of personal revelations for my own soul. The acting was very good. The directing great. The script was moving too. Many impressive times in the movie. There were very many touching scenes as Jesus, even as a young child demonstrated, wisdom, compassion and tender mercy toward all those around him. His gospel that he taught later was interwoven throughout the movie. I could see foreshadows of his future. The last scene with Mary and Jesus was so wonderful. Oh if all parents would speak faith, courage and love into their children like both parents did. The movie is a a good role model for parents all around the world. In this extremely distracting world often times parents forget to teach their children the spiritual lessons that would strengthen their character and heart against the harsh things of life. This is indeed a family movie. Little children under 7 won't understand it that well...but if your child is prepared first before he watches the movie about the real Jesus...then the movie will make sense to them. I am an ongoing student of the bible and a certified teacher from a bible institute and I highly recommend it. I would not recommend this movie if its the first movie you see about God. I would first expose your self and your children to some true bible stories about Jesus as an adult first. Adults should watch movies like Jesus of Nazareth and children can watch bible stories just made for kids. I am going to watch it again with my young granddaughter who already has been taught about Jesus. This movie i know will enrich her and her parents. It did me. i was very touched and it opened up doors to all the possibilities of what the child Jesus had to endure, suffer and grow into throughout his young life, as he grew and matured in wisdom, integrity and love, as God's only Begotten Son. I highly recommend you watch it first...and then again with your kids. Explain a little about what it would be like to be a child with a heart that was very kind and a child that could perform miracles of the kind that would make one a better person. Lastly pray before you watch it that God may reveal to your heart...what you personally need to know about God's character and plan for your life.",1468108800,4,3282,4.61025641025641

I have watched the film a number of times and have delighted on how well this film has depicted Jesus as he most likely was as a child  full of love and compassion for all. If I had to paint a picture in my minds eye of what Jesus would have been like as a child, this is what I would paint. Gods hand definitely played a part in the production of this film. Young Adam was selected unanimously to play the part of Jesus by the producers of the film.  The film was shut down for 2 1/2 years for lack of funding.  Actually, Adam who played Jesus would have been only 4 1/2 years old at the time.  He had to grow into the part.  Definitely the hand of God.",1467676800,8,723,3.9517241379310346

7690813,3,B01CUMITSA,"I was actually surprised by ""The Young Messiah"" because I actually enjoyed it, especially the music soundtrack and the sets and costumes. The sets and costumes were phenomenal. This film came out last year right at Easter, and given the subject matter I felt it odd that they would be releasing this movie for Easter when in my opinion, it would seem to fit better around Christmas.  Therefore, I didn't bother to see it.  Also, ""Risen"" came out in mid February, and although I thought it was odd that ""Risen"" came out so early, I thought it a better fit for the season we were going into.  Thus ""Risen"" trumped ""The Young Messiah"".  I bought ""TYM"" because I did want to see it. I was intrigued with what they were going to do with the scarce, almost nonexistent information that there is on Christ's childhood.  I assumed that they would be taking their information or basing the film on information gathered from the infancy narrative in the ""Gospel of Thomas"" and the ""Protovangelium of James"".  Although some of that is in this film, it seemed mostly another Hollywood version based on obscure information for entertainment value.  I don't think that a lot of people in general are familiar with ""The Gospel of Thomas"" or ""The Protovangelium of James"" as they are gnostic manuscripts written almost a century after Christ's death and are not part of the Synoptic Gospels. As I am slightly familiar with those manuscripts (if indeed they were basing the film off these manuscripts) I knew where they were going with it and understood what they were doing, and just enjoyed it as entertainment.",1467158400,7,1596,4.760869565217392

7690820,5,B01CUMITSA,"Nothing is known about the personal actions of Jesus himself until he is twelve years old. And then only a brief incident is
described in the Bible which takes place in the temple in Jerusalem during Passover.  The movie is based on Jesus' twelveth year of
life. And though it is primarily fiction, the story line includes actual details (some by flashbacks) of His conception, His birth in Bethlehem, the
Magi who came from the East seeking ""him who is born king of the Jews,"" and Joseph and Mary's relocation to Egypt because King Herod
sought to kill the Christ child. As the movie opens, they are in Egypt, but are preparing to return to Israel. Although there is no
indication in scripture as to Jesus' ability to perform miracles, according to the movie he can and does perform an occasional
one.. Herod has died but his son Archelaus reigns in his stead and the Romans are still in control of their country. Word reaches
Archelaus' ears that there is a child who can perform miracles, and he seeks to find and presumably kill him. The remainder of the
story is based on the efforts of a Roman Centurion to find Jesus and what happens when he does.",1467072000,2,1154,4.548076923076923

7690844,5,B01CUMITSA,"I think many of those who take Jesus bar Joseph seriously have wondered what those first 30 years must have been like in addition to the few verses in the Gospels.  And I appreciate the creative insights of my fellow travelers, even when they may not coincide with my own.  And while we all can read the same Scripture passage (e.g. ""He was like us in all things but sin,"") what the words mean is always open to a deeper understanding.
I appreciate that several of the concrete incidents in the movie are symbolic rather than historical, as were many of the parables of Jesus.  And I am grateful for yet another quality expression of lived sharing of faith and talent to help me (us) to find our own true answers and a worthy path of life.",1466726400,,739,4.37956204379562

7690846,4,B01CUMITSA,"I personally found the novel ""Christ the Lord Out of Egypt"" upon which this movie is mostly based to be much better, and frankly much more respectful of the subject. The movie screenplay took extreme liberties with the novel and the subject It made too much of the Devil/ Satan character
It seemed to try to make it sound like Jesus/ Yeshua  could keep saying ""The Devil made me do it."" It also made Jesus/ Yeshua into some kind of ""wunderkind""  There were many other changes that I found a little unusual to day the least. Like other reviewers I found the babel of British dialects a distraction. I'm glad I bought this film and watched it, and will do so again. I would also recommend ""Risen"" as a choice to watch too.",1466553600,,720,4.406015037593985
7690847,3,B01CUMITSA,"The childhood and adolescence of Christ's life is, with few exceptions, undocumented in the Bible. So, in order to render a portrayal of those times and events understandably requires an appropriate amount of dramatic license. How much license can remain in the appropriate category is an issue affecting this film. Some sequences, such as the scene when Christ was questioned by the clerics, and to whom he answered with knowledge and wisdom that shocked, impressed and even convinced many who heard Him speak, were portrayed with veracity and faithfulness to the scriptures. At other times, though, there seemed to be obvious pandering to the imagination. What else explains the non-scriptural scene of young Jesus bringing his tormentor back from the dead years before the Biblical account of Him performing His first miracle by turning water into wine? All in all, though, the movie was interesting and not offensive. It speculatively presented Christ as a boy., and those around Him as they grappled with the reality of His divinity.",1466553600,2,1038,5.184523809523809

Although the initial scene offers its appropriate disclaimer-- that the film is an imaginary year in the life of the boy Jesus-- the historical, geographical, and even theological errors and assumptions only compound as the movie progresses. (There's no room for creativity there.) The opening scenes (playmate of Jesus dying, healing of bird) also smack of the apocryphal Gospel of Thomas.

7690885,5,B01CUMITSA,"This film is based on the novel ""Christ the Lord: Out of Egypt"". I understand that there are many people out there who are hating on this film for its so-called Gnostic insertions. However, take into account the rich symbolism that is found in the film in which Jesus sees a foreshadowing of his future life. For example, there is a scene where he sees a Jewish rebel dying, and he has blood on his right hand. I believe this is a beautiful symbol of the suffering he was going to have to endure. He was going to be despised among men, and seen as nothing but a common rebel who needed to die. Apart from the beautiful symbols throughout the film, what astonishes me most is the humanity of Christ you really get to see. For example, there is a scene in the temple in Jerusalem where Jesus talks to a rabbi who tells him about what happened in Bethlehem when he was born. He explains about the massacre of the infants, and Jesus begins to weep, and you see so powerfully that Jesus, even being God, was also a man like us, with human emotions. This scene helped me understand Philippians 2:7 in a most amazing way! Most of all, this film helps you understand how beautiful the doctrine of the incarnation of Jesus Christ. If you are not happy with what you see in the film, let me comfort you by saying that I believe this film was created not so that you would stop learning about the life of Christ from when he was a child, but you should read the Holy Scriptures and discover Christ's humility in taking up the form of a man while still being divine. I thank all who helped this film come into being for their reverence towards the Christian faith. Soli Deo Gloria!",1465948800,54,1669,4.335463258785943

7690897,5,B01CUMITSA,"I had not heard about the book nor the movie so I was curious. I, like so many people, want to know how the young Y'shua Ben Joseph lived as a child.  Now we all know we can not be 100% positive about this part of history. The bible does not give us much to work with. However, the Lost Books of the New Testament gives a a glimpse of his life.  I may not agree with all of it, but being Jewish and learning about Jewish history (mandatory in my home) I can honestly say that most of what I learned I found in those books.

We can't even give a clear picture of the grown man but since we have eye witness testimony we can pretty much say this was His life and this is how He died.

This movie filled me both body and soul and even now as I am writing this I still feel Y'shua around me.  If I had to paint a picture in my minds eye about Y'shua as a child, this is what I would paint.  Many of you are critical of the movie and reading your criticisms I have to shake my head, not because you do not believe in G-d or His Son, but you just do not understand what the movie was trying to say.

7690906,1,B01CUMITSA,"This movie is just more of the same:

A movie to help the Christians feel good about the myths and fables of Jesus Christ.

Imagine this:

You're walking through your neighborhood on a warm day in April and you're humming the chorus of ""Hotel California"" when you suddenly hear a loud voice from above: ""Hey, you!""

You look up at once and spot a bearded man in his late 50s or early 60s. He's dressed in white robes and he shouts down at you from his second-story balcony: ""Yeah, you -- the one humming that old Eagles song!""

You stop, not quite knowing what to say. ""Me?""

""Yeah, you!"" he says while pointing. ""I heard you humming.""

You shrug dispassionately. ""Yeah, okay. I -- I like classic rock. Eagles, Deep Purple, Led Zeppelin -- Boston, Chicago, Tom Petty -- but not necessarily in that order -- ""

""Youre a sinner,"" he interrupts.

""A what?""

""You heard me,"" he says. ""You're a sinner -- and I'm angry with you."" His expression looks grim -- and also deranged -- and he holds this expression while he waits for you to respond to his accusation.

""Yeah, okay. I mean, I'm not perfect -- ""

""But don't worry,"" he says confidently. ""I have a solution for you.... I'm going to send my only son down to my basement...and some angry Rotarians are coming over in a few hours...and they're going to torture and kill him.""

Your brain farts -- but you respond with three little words: ""What the heck...?""

""My only son,"" he says -- this time with more emphasis. ""I'm sending him to the basement. Some Rotarians are coming over and they're going to whip him and beat the crap out of him -- and then they're going to make him carry some heavy lawn equipment -- and then they're going to nail his hands and his feet to some plywood thats hanging up down there.""

You're speechless.

""Youre a sinner,"" he repeats. ""And that's why these Rotarians are going to torture and kill my only son.""

You close your eyes in an effort to reject your current time and place in the universe. (It doesn't work.)

""I'm doing it all for you,"" he says. ""You're welcome. These Rotarians are going to torture and kill my only son so we can forgive you from all of the sins that you've committed in your life -- and then you have to believe twelve of my son's friends when they tell you that my son broke out of his casket and rose up from the ground -- three days from now -- and if you believe them, and if you do what they say, I'll let you into my grand amusement park in the sky after you die -- ""

Your fight-or-flight response finally kicks in -- and you're immediately power walking from the scene.

The old man shouts down at you while you're on the move: ""Hey! Come back here! Don't leave!""

But you don't look back -- and you don't respond.

He keeps shouting: ""If you don't believe my son's friends, you'll never get into my amusement park! Oh, and I forgot to mention that my son can cure cancer -- and his mother was a virgin!""

You keep moving.

""I'm gonna hunt you down and burn your damn house to the ground -- while you're still in it!""

Christianity is built on the premise that a child's ""sacrifice"" is our only ""solution"" -- and that an angry God (that created the ""problem"") will only forgive his ""sinful creations"" because his ""Only-Begotten Son"" was tortured and ""sacrificed"" for the ""sins"" of those ""creations."" (Its really just a loophole when you think about it). Christianity, therefore -- regardless of the brand, the movement, the good intentions, the ""feel good"" dogmas, or any of the desperate claims to higher moral standards -- is both ludicrous and immoral.",1463529600,2,3571,4.440184049079755
7690907,4,B01CUMITSA,"In this mostly fictional account, Joseph and his family constantly stay one step ahead of danger. A watchful and determined demon (unnamed but understood to be Satan) manipulates people and circumstances to try to bring harm to the child, Jesus. A Roman centurion, Severus, has been ordered by Herod Antipas to find and kill the young boy and he tracks Him to the temple of Jerusalem, leading to the films climax.

My wife and I and two of our granddaughters went to see The Young Messiah at the theater last Sunday and we all enjoyed it very much. The film is loosely based on Anne Rices, Christ the Lord Out of Egypt. Scripture actually says very little about Jesus childhood but weve all wondered about His life growing up with Mary and Joseph in Nazareth. Being both human and divine, what did He know and when did He know it? Traditions and legends abound but well never know the truth this side of eternity.

The story, acting, and sets are all well done. Adam Greaves-Neal shines as the loving, empathetic, young Jesus and Sean Bean gives a fine performance as the grizzled soldier. The writers took a bit of a Catholic approach by depicting Jesus as Marys only child with young James as His cousin but I don't mean to make a mountain out of a molehill. It also struck me as specious that a Roman centurion would take direct orders from and be threatened by the appointed tetrarch of a conquered territory, but I quibble.

Some Christians object to all Hollywood portrayals of Jesus and other Biblical characters and events. I agree that people should not get their theology from Hollywood scriptwriters but I also believe the Lord can definitely use films like The Young Messiah and Risen to spark an interest in spiritual matters and draw people to Him. I pray the Lord will work in many hearts through The Young Messiah.",1462233600,14,1830,4.6419753086419755
7690908,5,B01CUMITSA,"This is a beautiful and well done movie. The story is based on someone's imagination as to what the life of Jesus might have been at 7 years old. If you are looking for biblical accuracy, you are not going to find it. We don't have much biblical info on Jesus' youth. This story though is a beautiful work of a writer's fertile imagination. It is very entertaining and the movie is tastefully done! I can't wait for it to come out on DVD!",1461974400,14,438,4.226190476190476
7690909,5,B01CUMITSA,"Truly beautiful and touching - one of the best movies I've seen.  We do not really know the life of Jesus as a young boy, and this respectful handling is one possibility and a beautiful, life-affirming one.  Regardless of whether it is true other not, it touches the soul and made me think a lot.  I really loved it.  It made my Easter all the more meaningful.",1461801600,30,360,4.3283582089552235

8754222,1,B01CUMITSA,"In the new testament, the first miracle of Jesus was at a wedding reception where, at the urging of his mother, he turned water in to wine.

In this movie, Jesus was troubled at seeing a dead bird on the beach so he brought it back to life.

His second miracle was to raise to life a young bully who had beaten Jesus - either the devil or a demon had killed the boy, but the blame had been placed on Jesus.  To escape blame and possible physical harm, Jesus heals the bully.

Two miracles within the first few minutes totally out of character for the Jesus of the Bible - raising a dead bird or any animal (not that Jesus lacked empathy, but during his time sacrificial offerings were common) and then raising a dead boy to escape retaliation?

That was enough for me.  New age spiritualism is anti Jesus.",1537056000,,805,4.298013245033113

8754226,1,B01CUMITSA,"The notion that The Lord has to 'journey' for a self-discovery 'epiphany' of whom He is, and seldom His destiny, rises from the typical novelties and deformation of the reality of who Jesus Christ indeed is as it is shown in Our Sacred Traditions per 2nd Thessalonians 2:15.
I find this notion of Christ to be a romanticised idea at is best. Fortunately, we have His witness in His Word in His Catholic Church, also depositary of His prerogatives through His Apostolic Succession. We know the Lord did not need to come to terms with His destiny, nor the gnostic ideas that implied that He was not GOD: In 180 AD, Saint Irenaeus opposed Gnosticism in ""Against Heresies."" The Church condemned Gnosticism.
Films like this are confusing. Moreover, that which does not serve to edify The Church is not of GOD +",1536451200,,805,4.676056338028169

I would recommend watching it once, but don't know that I would sit down to watch it again.",1535673600,,278,4.365384615384615
