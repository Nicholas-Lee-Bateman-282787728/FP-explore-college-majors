8451474,5,B0050N0VCE,"Though BBC America presented the first three mini-seasons of this excellent British crime series about tough undercover cop Tommy Murphy, the network, to my knowledge, dropped the ball on the final two. It would be hard to imagine that anyone seeing the former would choose to ignore the latter. Granted, the plots aren't quite as extraordinary as during the first seasons, but they're no less intense. And star James Nesbitt continues to impress as the tough, uncompromising and humane copper Tommy Murphy.",1373328000,,507,5.195121951219512

8451477,1,B0050N0VCE,"Series 3 ends with a bang, Series 5 grinds to a thud. The only standout is the intense acting of Brian McCardie as Billy Johnstone in Series 4. James Nesbitt has a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jekyll/dp/B000QXDEH2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jekyll</a>&nbsp;moment in a nursing home that's good, and the suspense is well played in said nursing home, as the worlds of work and family collide. But overall, Series 4 is a weird mix of sloppy grotesquery and improbability, of political correctness mixed with voyeuristic brutality.

Series 5 is so bad that we're donating the whole of Series 1-3 to charity, discarding 4 & 5 so as not to share junk replete with ugly clichs and stereotypes. The production notes state that producers used American crime-drama for inspiration, but that did Series 5 no favors, it's as dated as 1980s polyester. Few want to watch derivative, claustrophobic head games that imitate the worst of American television. No wonder the show was cancelled. The gratuitous and exploitive narrative offers nothing. The hopeless dismal dullness that Murphy winds up in is simply not worth bothering with, and makes re-watching previous episodes unrewarding. The entire show is a dead end.

What a treat to turn to the marvelous Brenda Blethyn as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vera/dp/B0050N0US4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vera</a>&nbsp;after this self-indulgent debacle. The rumpled and caustic Blethyn is believable in mysteries set against landscapes as filled with light as Vermeer's paintings.

8451478,4,B0050N0VCE,"In Seasons four (4) and Five (5) of this marvelous British Murder/mystery series with a heavy Irish accent, the viewing audience gets a far more tense "" Murphy's Law"" on two (2) discs with three (3) interrelated episodes on each disc.  Those episodes are really very well written and directed with the star performer, James Nesbitt, per usual, being outstanding just not as humorous as in previous seasons.  I am sure the lack of ""humorous banter"" in Seasons four (4) and five (5) is mainly due to the fact that Murphy is going through some ""not so fun times"" in his own personal life , (his beloved mother is committed to a nursing home--to name one thing) plus the episodes are really gritty--not circumstances that are too frivolous with some characters that are very unsavory and with Murphy , as an ""undercover cop"" facing some extremely dangerous situations even his secret identity being ""blown"" (his dealing with that makes for some super tense viewing).  All that I know is that Seasons four (4) and five (5) kept me highly entertained.

The seasons on these two (2) discs are the last of this series.  I am very sad to see the last of Murphy's Law"" because it has entertained me greatly as did these seasons.

Be advised that all of the episodes in these seasons are very good especially the last one on the second disc--Nesbitt's acting is overwhelming.  What an ending.",1317427200,13,1381,4.7053941908713695
8451479,2,B0050N0VCE,"I thought seasons 1 and 2 were pretty much your average British crime drama, albeit with a charming, and often quite funny, performance by James Nesbitt and I liked the interplay he had with Annie. Then season 3 came along and utterly knocked me down. It has to be one of the best pieces of work in this genre, Nesbitt underwent a total transformation into a hard boiled utterly determined cop. The story was also masterfully written. In contrast seasons 4 and 5 fell somewhat short in my view. Season 4 is the weaker of the two in this set, Murphy looking after his senile mom while an illiterate psycho Irish Loyalist who has a brother that has converted to Islam tries to kill him verged on the ridiculous at times. Seasons one and two had there share of joke episodes but the earlier seasons were meant to be humorous. I was expecting another season 3 and just didn't get it...as for season 5 we have a far more grim story revolving around human trafficking and child prostitution but it seemed a bit too cliche. Eastern European gangsters, Murphy going out of his way to rescue his female comrades ect...its all been done many many time before. I also felt the budget was much lower and got tired of seeing Murphy sitting in trailers, that said it was much better than season 4. So if you are a fan of Nesbitt and the series check it out but if you want to see the it at its very best stick to season 3.",1315526400,6,1408,4.357414448669202
