346893,5,6301720555,"For the 1950s, a surprisingly frank and adult treatment of the often messy business of life, love and marriage. Peck's natural inwardness suits him well in this role, as Tom struggles with memories and feelings he'd like to avoid. Jones is solid and sympathetic as Betsy, but March nearly steals the movie as Hopkins, a man who's built his life on his business, and regrets, too late, all he's had to sacrifice for it. An incisive, intelligent drama, skillfully mounted by writer/director Nunnally Johnson.",1125964800,3,506,5.035714285714286
346894,5,6301720555,"On the surface, The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit offers a captivating drama where a man struggles with his memories from World War II while trying to be a strong father at home.  Yet, the film submerges into a much deeper dissection of the American society, which offers amusement, drama, and contemplation.  Much of the film is obviously shot in a studio, however, this seems like a minute detail when the story begins to take form.

Hard work, dedication, and courage are the corner stones of the American Dream, which should help people build a prosperous future.  In the backdrop of the American Dream, people of the 1950s also strived to achieve the perfect family through a number of intriguing methods.  Many moved out of the cities into the suburbs where they sought a relatively easy life style without much hassle and stress.  This notion was superficially padded with a perfect little house with a nice car and all the amenities that comfort requires.  In order to gain these items, many had to work harder and sacrifice more of their personal life in order to make the monthly installments.  In addition, many had to use the public transit system to and from work while time with the family continued to decrease.  Nunnally Johnson uses the same name as Sloan Wilson's novel The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit to illustrate his vision of the American Dream.

After the soothing music during opening credits the audience is thrown into the hectic and stressful life of New York City shortly after 5:00pm on a weekday.  People are venturing home on a train after a long and rewarding day of hard work.  Among the passengers, the main character Tom Rath (Gregory Peck) sits down at his usual seat together with Bill Hawthorn (Gene Lockhart) who asks him how his wife is doing.  It leads into a discussion where Tom's explains his financial predicament of not making ends meet.  Bill informs him about an opening at USB (no, not the computer port).  However, Tom who has become settled in his position in life is first hesitant while using his complacent persona to avoid unnecessary risks by starting a new career.

Throughout the film, the audience is introduced to Tom's children, his wife, his work, and his boss while also being able to see into his past through extensive flashbacks.  Through these parts of Tom's life a colorful illustration of how his persona was shaped emerges, as the film displays numerous situations in his life.  It is evident that Tom is a righteous and dedicated person who has shown much courage and hard work throughout his life.  However, some incidents in his life caused him to create a complacent attitude towards life, as he no longer has any aspirations for prosperity.  This is one of the things that bothers his wife, Betsy Rath (Jennifer Jones), who desires a better home and a more stable economy that does not trigger any financial stress on their lives.  It leads Tom to seek the open position at television network USB.

The film goes into great depth to suggest how the quest for the American Dream sometimes can change people, as opportunities of short cuts to success and prosperity materialize.  Through Tom's job, the audience can witness how he deals with situations in the corporate world, where he faces the corporate politics.  He must make decisions whether to corrupt his character in order to secure his future, or take the risk of loosing it all through honesty.  It is fascinating to see how it can be harmful to achieve the American Dream, as it hurts the society, the family, and the individual.  The hurtful aspects of the American Dream also emerge through Tom's boss, Ralph Hopkins (Fredric March) who gained great success and vast prosperity through ceaseless dedication to his job, but never obtained the perfect family.

The brilliant performance by Gregory Peck helps develop an intriguing persona, which is honorable and devoted.  Yet, he is not perfect, which brings to mind the notion of human imperfection.  Johnson goes even further than the American Dream with this film, as his film deals with both aspects of life - joy and pain.  It is through these two opposite facets of life where Johnson reveals the idea that the American Dream is merely a mirage of perfection, as life cannot be without misery.  Nonetheless, people continue to hunt for the American Dream, the illusion of no suffering, but as Johnson proposes these people loose themselves in the illusion of happiness where bad things rests.

It is within the story the audience will find a meaningful tale, which has something for every viewer to ponder from any part of society.  This is due to Johnson's cinematic treatment of a social issue through an interesting philosophical approach, as he presents several different viewpoints on the issue.  It is also what makes the film so interesting while it leaves the viewers thinking and reflecting of their own lives.",1123632000,6,4911,4.841916167664671
346895,5,6301720555,"This film has been one of my all time favorites for years and years.  I agree with the other reviews posted and will not repeat them.  I would like to summarize my view-point of the film.  The story depicts a man who is struggling to regain control of his life, in a world of people who are all too willing to take advantage of him (The wife nags about his career, A former servant is trying to take his inheritance, and he is pressured at his workplace).  Sound familiar?  Even though this film was made in the 1950's it is very easy to apply its foundations to today.  In the end, the Man is successful in reclaiming his life and does things his way.  I am inspired each and every time I watch it!  Gregory Peck is awesome in this movie, by the way.",1119398400,5,751,4.166666666666667
346896,5,6301720555,"Catch the anonymous face in the crowd and consider the bright lights and dark shadows of that fellow's existence. This is Peck's performance in The Man in the Grey Flannel Suit and he is brilliant. Several reviewers have noted ""the Look"" of the film and its quintessential Fifties style. This is true, I felt I was gaining a peak at a long lost world: Post-war America, advancing economically, but struggling morally. The flashbacks make this half a War movie and give it a shared history with its adult intended audience. This was a time when adult movies did not mean pornography, but dealt with mature themes such as honesty in relationships and integrity in your profession.

Gregory Peck has some great scenes, many in which he doesn't seem to do much. The look on his face on the train when the man in the coat in front of him triggers a repulsive memory from the war is worth pages of dialogue. The uncomprehending shock from when he accidentally kills his best friend is a real tearjerker. I don't know what other American actor at this time could be so effective.

The plot was a surprise to me, I really had no idea this was such an engaging story. The title implies a dull, plodding story, and I have to admit little prior knowledge about this movie except its one of those I'd always heard about. This has got to be one of the best movies out of the Fifties and that is saying a lot. There is poignancy, humor (the kids always glued to the TV and oblivious to the real drama around them), and above all, a slice of life that is absorbing and realistic. This is definitely an overlooked gem needing full DVD glory. Have the popcorn ready, once you start it, you won't want to get off the couch.",1110931200,90,1705,4.461538461538462
346897,3,6301720555,"One of the most interesting movies of the 50s, and one which accurately portrays the rarely-approached subject of ordinary men trying to fit in their contemporary workplace. Peck is a little miscast (too tall and striking to possess the ""ordinary"" quality necessary for the role) and Jennifer could be a little more varied in her characterization (she needs a ""light"" moment or two) but they are both as usual fun to watch.
Peck's interview lunch is one of the best scenes, as is Ann Harding's plea to Frederich March. The other reviewers have not mentioned how the color and Cinemascope really add to the feel of the Fifties , and this cannot be stated enough - see it on a big-inch TV if possible. I think the wardrobe is one of the best in cinema history - it looks exactly as if it came off the racks of the department stores during the period. A great story, and one which anyone who has been employed in the business world as a white-collar worker, and who has aged thru their thirites, will identify with.

A tad on the lengthy side (at slightly more than 2-and-a-half hours), but worth the excursion.
Mr. March is a standout here (IMO), as the head of a major TV network which employs Peck.  March's role here puts me in mind of a similar character he portrayed two years earlier in ""Executive Suite"".  He is much more likable, however, in this film.",1018656000,9,587,4.782178217821782
346902,4,6301720555,"Gregory Peck stars as a Madison Avenue executive whose life reaches several crises at once.  His wife, Jennifer Jones, is pushing him to make more money and to be more successful, but without losing his ideals or honesty in a business that values neither one of those.  His experiences in World War II are coming back to haunt him, and his ownership of his grandmother's house is being challenged by her former servant.  Fredric March co-stars as his new boss, a man who put his business before his family, a decision whose consequences he must now live with.  There are a lot of lofty ideas being bounced around in this story, and they tend to center around the importance of family and being true to one's self and ideals.  Peck is his usual solid self, probably the perfect choice for this kind of role.  Jones gets the big emotional scene in the film, and she plays it to the hilt.  March gives a very moving, sympathetic performance, while Ann Harding as his distant wife has a couple of good scenes.  Although this is very much a film of the Fifties, the basic message of the movie still has its impact today.  It's honestly presented, well acted and written, and well worth watching.",991526400,93,1190,4.5754716981132075
346957,2,6301720555,"Review of The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit
Hot Toasty Rag, August 8, 2017

Ten years after their fantastic, steamy pairing in Duel in the Sun, Gregory Peck and Jennifer Jones reunited in the adaptation of the successful novel The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit. During the golden age of the 1950s, it was pretty daring to make a story about life in suburbia that isn't perfect. Greg and Jenny are married and live a perfectly normal existence, and its nice for audiences to see them in a normal, far from tumultuous relationship. But why is Greg so unsatisfied?

Well, as he commutes to his job in the city, he flashes back to his time in the war, before he returned home and donned the stereotypical gray flannel suit. Hes still haunted by his memories, both on the battlefield and in the arms of the woman he had an affair with while overseas. I know; why would you cheat on Jennifer Jones?

While it was a groundbreaking movie to make in 1956, it doesnt really stand the test of time very well, since Hollywood has now made thousands of movies about a mans dissatisfaction with his seemingly perfect life. This one can feel a little slow and anticlimactic, so unless you're really into old movies or Gregory Peck, you might not like it that much.",1502150400,,1247,4.484581497797357

The admiration he shows the couple for taking responsibility for an overseas child is amazing....as is his unmasking of an attempted fraud with respect to Peck's house.

In my opinion, most of the problem was Gregory Peck being miscast, he just isn't believable as a two-timing con man of a business man. After his turn as the icon of integrity in To Kill a Mockingbird, he just isn't able to seem self-serving and slimy enough for this role.  However, Fred MacMurray would have been perfect.

Post-World War II novels owe everything to Sloan Wilson's accurate and unrelenting depiction of the challenges and risks of men and women working in post-WWII businesses. Power became everything and to survive, one had to demonstrate creative courage.

Great novels are based on everyman characters who, when faced with difficult and sometimes impossible options, are able to overcome challenging adversity and dangerous adversaries and carry the day for what is right and just.

347091,2,6301720555,"My biggest issue with `The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit' is that the film itself seems to suffer from a serious identity crisis.  It doesn't know what story it wants to tell, and if it does it doesn't understand the best way to tell it.  The life of Tom Rath is an intriguing one, but the film's structure is a mess to be honest and it takes away from the impact one would expect to get from the film.  The flashbacks are too lengthy and distracting and the subplot involving Fredric March and his teenage daughter is unnecessary and time consuming.

The film tells the story of a business man struggling to provide for his family.  He's haunted by his time overseas during the war and is harboring a deep secret from his wife, which threatens (in the film's final chapter) to expose itself.  In the meantime he's fighting for a new job (and bigger pay) and in the end fighting his moral conscience as he tries to win over his new boss.  A subplot concerning property and a disgruntled for employee of Rath's mother makes for a LOT of stuff going on in this ill formatted film.

The lackluster performances don't really help much.  I've yet to be truly wowed by Gregory Peck.  I understand that he's beloved by many, but I find him sort of stiff.  Jennifer Jones opens and closes this film with her hideous facial expressions (DRAMA) and Arthur O'Connell clich&eacute;s up his every scene.  Fredric March is actually very good here, but he can't save the film when his subplot is one of the worst aspects of the script.

Profound?  You said it.  Peck is miscast here, as he always is when asked to play a man with an emotion that requires more than a raised eyebrow and a lowering of the voice.  Frederic March is impeccable as always as the boss who has become boss by sacrificing everything and everyone on the altar of his ambition, but yet retains a heart of gold.  Jennifer Jones has a thankless role as the ever-nagging wife - hers is the only character with any dimension at all - the rest are strictly one-dimensional cardboard cut-outs.  I was waiting for the scene in which Peck's character begins wearing the halo he has spent his life earning - he is the epitome of the suffering saint - most saints of course were once human and so exhibited (one would presume) emotions - emotions which Peck has too fine a mind to allow to enter his cranium.  No cliche goes unturned here.  The disaffected wife, the rebellious daughter, the always lovable children (so loveable and well-behaved that one forgets they are there from time to time), the underhanded and envious supervisor.  The wife is at first understandably upset at learning her husband betrayed her with another woman, but after a few minutes of soul searching she accepts it.  She accepts it because she, like the audience, knows that Peck is a well-intentioned monolith of morality who merely made an unfortunate misstep which keeps him earthbound with the rest of us. It is not a bad film; it's simply inconsequential.  A good director would have cut the thing down to an hour and a half without any loss whatsoever.",1377302400,,1801,4.667721518987341
347141,5,6301720555,"Gregory Peck has always been one of the best actors of his time. I saw this movie as a kid and it always struck home with me with him being the dedicated, but confused, husband of Jennifer Jones. They make a good pair like they did in Duel in the Sun. For a man known for action films like The Guns of Navarone, this movie demonstrates how Gregory Peck can play just about anything.

His role is a businessman complacently working in a small firm in New York. He earns $7,000 a year at a time when that was considered good money, but not enough to grow on. Through a recommendation from a friend on the train, he accepts an interview for an AD agency with the potential of earning more money. His wife, played by Jennifer Jones (herself a great actress), pushes Greg Peck to earn more money so they can move to a better neighborhood. Despite having two children, a beautiful home, and a stable income, they are not happy. She tells him, ""I can't stand living in this home!"" I'm left to wonder why considering how nice it is. Greg's character is plagued with memories of his experiences in WWII. In Italy he had an affair with a local woman. In the Pacific he loses his close friend in combat. Both have extreme influences on his character as he tries to understand how to keep his family happy and together.
At the same time, his work in the AD agency is taking off. The president likes Greg, and we see hints how Greg may remind the president of the agency, played by the great Fredric March. We also learn about other characters in the film that play a significant role in the film. Fredric March is clearly the successful AD-man and head of a powerful agency. But his personal life is a wreck. His wife kicked him out of their home long ago, and their daughter refuses to go to college and is planning on marrying a much older man as a way of getting away from them both. It is heart-wrenching when we see Fredric March try and reason with his daughter and wife. He even explodes on Greg's character about what he sacrificed to get where he is.
In the end, Greg Peck must choose between his family and work-life. Although this film was made in 1956, it still rings true today by focusing on the important things that make a family strong and happy.",1377129600,7,2251,4.359523809523809

Tom is 33, a Harvard graduate, and was a WWII paratroop officer with flashbacks of an overseas affair and his combat experiences. Betsy believes he's not paid enough and urges him to interview for a higher-paying position as a speechwriter, which he gets. He's then torn between game-playing (telling the boss what he wants to hear) vs. telling the truth. Meanwhile, another issue pops up - should he tell his wife about the affair, now that the woman in Europe needs money to support his son. Tom and her work their way through that stressful situation as well. En route, he realizes that he's not a company man, but a family man.",1376611200,,726,4.6796875
347145,4,6301720555,"""The Man in the Grey Flannel Suit"" is one of the more subtle and telling melodramas to come out of the 1950's.  It compares favorably with the movies of Douglas Sirk in the manner that it exposes the shaky underpinnings of the decade characterized by the ""green fairways of indifference.""

Gregory Peck's ""Tom Rath"" is haunted by the horrors he experienced in WWII, as well as a passionate affair with an Italian girl whom he knew he left pregnant with his child.  He has returned to the US, married his sweetheart Betsy (Jennifer Jones), and is doggedly pursuing the American dream while trying to keep his integrity intact.  His wife is more materialistic than he is; his kids are mesmerized by shoot-'em-up Westerns on TV.

When he pursues a better job with a large corporation, he finds favor with an executive whom he reminds of a lost son.  He begins work on designing a campaign for his boss regarding mental health initiatives, and is encounters obstacles in the form of office politics.  At every step of the way in his attempts to better his life, he is beset by difficult ethical questions and determined adversaries.  The subtleness of the movie comes in the awareness of how thin the blade is that his chances of happiness rest upon.  The executive/father figure (played byFredric March)  is also plagued by personal problems, including a threatening heart condition.  Should he die, Tom Rath would lose his most crucial supporter.

The one minor detraction to this otherwise fine movie is that as ""Tom Rath's"" marital problems finally begin to heal, the movie abruptly ends and leaves the other issues hanging unresolved.

Nevertheless this is a satisfying portrayal of the difficulties of living a moral life, with good performances all around.  There is also a nice score by Bernard Herrmann with echoes of the music he would later use in films like Hitchcock's ""Vertigo"".",1376611200,2,1888,4.89622641509434

The Bernard Hermann soundtrack is an extra treat. I was surprised at how the extensive flashbacks were interwoven with the main plot, but it all worked. Certainly this film captures the post World War II zeitgeist in America, where a decade after the conflict many veterans who had transitioned into civilian life were still traumatized by their experiences, trying to balance marriage, family, business, etc., in their lives. One really wonders what it was like to be living the humdrum existence of a nine to fiver commuting to NYC from Westport, Connecticut, and then getting abruptly yanked out to serve in Europe and the South Pacific, only to return to the same routine as a completely changed person. There are many complex levels to the narrative, ethical, philosophical, psychological that are all pertinent to our time, and a lot of good lines. They don't make them like this anymore and anyone interested in American cinema should see this film.

347178,5,6301720555,"Gregory Peck seemed to get such thoughtful roles. This is one of his best. He plays Tom Rath, a WWII veteran who has been working for a non-profit foundation when he is recommended for a job as a PR man for a broadcasting company. The boss, Ralph Hopkins (Fredrick March) wants to start a big program to improve mental health care. As part of working on this project, Rath becomes involved in the melodrama that is the Hopkins family life.

Through a series of flash backs, we learn a good bit about Rath's time in the Army, including a six-week period in Rome with a beautiful young woman. Yes, he was brave, and really a hero, but he also accidentally threw a grenade right in front of one of his men, and then carried the body to the nearest medic outpost, unwilling to believe he was dead. It's clear the war still has had an effect on his mind.

His wife Betsy (Jennifer Jones) worries about what has changed him, but of course he has told her very little. They have three children and live in a house she absolutely hates at the time he gets his new job. But his grandmother has recently died and left him her white elephant of a house, so they go to live there. There are sub-plots about that which have the benefit of introducing us to Judge Bernstein (Lee J. Cobb), a crusty old gent with a very practical turn of mind about the law.

Much of the story centers around honesty, the keeping of secrets, and the habit of yes men to try to tell the boss what they think he wants to hear rather than the honest evaluation for which they are paid. Rath may have to be prodded into being honest with the boss by his wife, but when it comes time for him to be honest with her, she freaks out. Fortunately, she gets over her freak out and her practical side asserts itself in the end.

It's an excellent movie with many subtleties, several intriguing sub-plots that help to convey the inner life of the main characters, and very much what a Gregory Peck movie is supposed to be.",1336608000,2,1978,4.32345013477089

347180,3,6301720555,"Time has not been kind to this film. That's unfortunate, because its central issue -- should one be honest, or ""play by the rules"" to keep your job? -- remains pertinent.

The problems must be laid at the feet of Nunnally Johnson, who wrote, directed, and produced. There's a lot of pretentious, wordy dialog. (It's embarrassing to see a fine actor like Fredric March given such a poorly written role.) Most scenes lack momentum. Attempts at humor largely fizzle. The acting never rises above ""acceptable"", with Ann Harding as March's wife particularly bad.

The main problem, though, is that Johnson fails to energetically dramatize the story's conflicts -- in particular, Tom's eventual decision to tell March what he really thinks about the latter's plan to start a national crusade for mental-health awareness. The story and the characters just sort of lie there, without doing much to engage our interest. The sequence in which Peck accidentally kills his best friend and tries to get medical help for the corpse is particularly weak. (We do, however, get to see DeForest Kelley inform Peck that the man is dead.)

The film's perceived weakness might actually be the result of the way its observations about the soullessness of business have become part of the common social vocabulary. But I don't think so. It is a thoroughly mediocre film.

Bernard Herrmann's score is one of his lesser efforts -- though Fox does him the honor (as it did in ""The Ghost and Mrs Muir"") of letting his title music replace the Fox fanfare. There are some excellent sequences -- particularly the one in which Peck and two other soldiers kill Germans to get their warm clothing -- but the music ultimately demonstrates just how difficult it is to write a distinctive score for a conventional, contemporary drama. (I am of the opinion that serious dramas should have little or no scoring.)

The transfer is excellent. The sound (both music and dialog) appears to be real stereo, typical of Fox's early CinemaScope films. (I will confirm this later.)",1330473600,,2034,4.935672514619883

His wife has hoodwinked him and fled. She drives recklessly in this emotional upheaval.

347202,4,6301720555,"Growing up in one of New York's commuter suburbs in the 1950s, I often heard the phrase, ""gray flannel suit,"" from the title of the novel by Sloan Wilson and this film.  The phrase was shorthand for conformity, consumerism, and the deadening qualities of the corporate rat race.

Peck gives a good performance as a young executive in public relations.  Fredric March's portrayal of a broadcasting CEO is particularly fine.  Jennifer Jones plays some overwrought scenes.

The movie also offers a window on some things past:  the New Haven Railroad, early television, World War II PTSD, judges who cared for character and honor, and indeed, gray flannel suits.  They dressed handsomely on Madison Avenue.  On the other hand, one wonders what the interior decorators of the time were smoking.  This is the decade when Betty Freidan was doing a slow burn on the discontents of suburban women, and it strikes me there could be feminist readings of the film that support her view of the decade.

When I watched the film recently, I thought it might sermonize on conformity and consumerism.  I found, however, that the movie is driven more by its subplots -- psychological aftereffects of the war, a wife's ambition for her husband, and corporate politics.  The larger themes don't reach out and punch you.  Rather they are implicit.

Yes, the film takes you back to the 1950s, but after you've watched it, think it over.  More than half a century has passed since the film was made, and America is a different place.  Yet we still need to think about conformity, when to run against the grain in an organization, the balance between the job and the family, and how marriages need honesty.

347203,5,6301720555,"After having read all other reviews and just watching this wonderful movie again, I want to write about my opinion on this film.
This film definitely did stand the test of time very well.
First of all why is the length of the movie such a big deal? I just don't get it. Movies from the nineties and after are usually at least 135 minutes long, so 153 minutes is only 18 minutes longer. Not much of a difference.
Then there is the great soundtrack by Bernard Herrmann who made the score for 8 Hitchcock movies and for ""Cape Fear"".

I also believe that Tom Rath is not only haunted by his war time memories, but that he sometimes thinks that Maria, his love in Italy, probably would have made a better wife, because she was giving and caring, but Tom's wife Betsy is not giving at all and expects too much from Tom (instead of getting a job and contribute to their life style of which she is so unsatisfied). She comes across as very greedy.
This is an excellent film from the fifties, at least as good (if not better) as ""Strangers when we met"", ""Peyton Place"", ""A Summer Place"", ""All that Heaven allows"", ""Susan Slade"" and ""Imitation of Life"".
Watch the film first, then read the book by Sloan Wilson (who also wrote ""A Summer Place"", another wonderful novel). You won't be disappointed. Sloan Wilson also wrote a sequel to ""The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit"" and Douglas Kennedy wrote an even better novel about the same time frame in Manhattan (starting in November 1945 though) called ""The Pursuit of Happiness"". I can whole-heartedly recommend Douglas Kennedy's bookbto everybody who wrote Wilson's novel.

Gregory Peck made some unforgettable movies like ""To kill a Mockingbird"", ""Roman Holiday"", ""Twelve O'Clock High"", ""Gentleman's Agreement"", ""Cape Fear"", ""Mirage"" (finally available on DVD) and ""The Bravados"" (his best western), but ""The Man in the gray Flannel Suit"" will always be my # 1 Gregory Peck movie.",1306022400,,1917,4.719402985074627

Small businesses keep the wealth locally, large businesses drain wealth away to New York and other financial centers. Tom's decision says something about small businesses. An owner-operator does not have to choose between family and business because they are about the same. The wife and children help to run things on a farm or family business. Everyone who works for a corporation has to decide about family and business.

347243,4,6301720555,"THE MAN IN THE GRAY FLANNEL SUIT, based on the acclaimed novel by Sloan Wilson, resonated quite heavily with many men and their families in 1956.  Some fifty years later, this movie still holds a powerful lesson about the balance of work commitments and family duty.

In post-war New York, working-class family man Tom Rath (Gregory Peck) tries to provide as much as he can for his young family, despite the limitations of his income.  Tom's wife Betsy (Jennifer Jones), always trying to find new ways to make money, suggests they move from their Connecticut house into Tom's dead grandmother's mansion--an idea that later backfires when it's discovered that the mansion has been willed away from the Rath family.  Tom's life is complicated still by his recurring flashbacks about the War, and the young girl he left behind (Marisa Pavan).  Tom's boss, Ralph Hopkins (Fredric March) ended up destroying his own family for the very same values and ambitions that Tom is now striving for...can he help Tom avoid the same fate?

It's such a treat seeing Gregory Peck and Jennifer Jones, the violent young lovers of ""Duel in the Sun"", teamed again in this outstanding family drama.  Their chemistry was outstanding.  In the character of Tom Rath, Peck managed to convey all the frustrations, fears and aspirations of the average working man.  Jennifer Jones compliments him well as Tom's wife. Fredric March adds lots of gravity and wisdom to his role of Tom's mentor, Ralph.

THE MAN IN THE GRAY FLANNEL SUIT was truly producer Darryl Zanuck's prestige picture for 1956.  Though at times the lush CinemaScope visuals clash with the intimate nature of the story, the production values are high and the entire film is a treat to behold.

347244,5,6301720555,"I had heard about this film for years but never saw it.  It is very much of its time--the 50's--post WWII when Americans were settling into prosperity.  I had assumed that this would be about some man's climb upward in an ad agency or something.  It is so much more than that.  And although it describes perfectly the dilemmas of the time, the basic human elements are told so well that people today can surely relate to the film.

Gregory Peck is his usual magnificent self.  He is almost too handsome for the role but it helps to have someone so beautiful to watch for such a long film.  Besides his looks and natural elegance, he reeks of character and integrity, which make us pull for him through the long haul.  His ""lapse"" of marital fidelity is certainly shown in the most sympathetic way.

Jennifer Jones, as his wife, was a little disappointing to me.  It is mentioned elsewhere that she was nicer in the book.  She is a complex character here in the film, who, at times seems selfish, shallow and materialistic, while, at other times, berates her husband for not having enough courage to tell the blunt truth to his boss (and thereby risk the steady income which she so desperately is counting on). I didn't find her particularly beautiful here, either, although she has been stunning in many of her other roles. In sum, she isn't as sympathetic a character as Peck's but perhaps she is that much more human.  The 50's were a time of people wanting to forget the horrors and hardships of the war, rationing, and death and fell in love with refrigerators, cars, tvs and all the good things that money could buy.

The script is intelligent and both sides of many issues are thoroughly played out.  This may seem maddening and slow to some viewers who are used to faster action films withless dialogue, but I found it satisfying.  In many of the scenes, such as the one where Peck discloses the fact of his war time affair to his wife, I could agree with each one of them, in turn.

It is heartening to see a film tackle such moral issues and to show the difficulty most people face when trying to live a decent life.

I enjoyed the costumes and especially the decor.  So many film sets from the 50's show the tackier elements of the style of that era  but some of these places---the offices and the Connecticut home of the boss's ex-wife were quite beautiful.

The subplots of the boss' family problems and the problems with the inherited house were all interesting.  The scenes in Italy were touching and charming.  All in all this is a first class film, definitely worth watching.",1193270400,,2591,4.538793103448276

Are we obligated to commit economic suicide?  Alas, we all must compromise in the real world.  The only real question is how far can we go before betraying our ultimate values. Tom Rath (Gregory Peck) is a WWII veteran trying to make it in the Big Apple.  Should he dedicate his whole heart and soul to the company?  Is there any room for Rath's family?  Where must he draw the line?  The only serious negative is that women are treated as stay-at-home moms.  Still, this is a well done movie and worthy of your time and interest.

This movie will almost certainly resonate with those viewing it even in the distant future.  Its central themes are eternally relevant.  However, there is one scene that reminded me that The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit is a fictional account of the mid 1950s.  Tom Rath is informed by his wife that they must purchase a new washing machine.  It will cost $250.00.  Please note that this is an era when a $10,000 income was considered to be far above average.  This clothes cleaning appliance, for all practical purposes, would therefore retail at about $2,500 in our present era!  Do we really want to return to the past?  I don't think so.

347264,4,6301720555,"Lushly photographed and intelligently scripted, ""The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit"" is an engaging and often bracing look at one man trying to make it in the world, both on a personal and professional level.  As pointed out by one or two other reviews on this site, the issues faced by Gregory Peck's character aren't too different than those faced by any working man or woman today.

The one difference is that Mr. Peck's character is still very much affected by the ominous looming in the recent past of the most dramatic event of the twentieth century up to that point, World War II.  He at one point asks himself how it's possible for a man to see and take part in all manner of horrendous activities during that war and then go back to quietly taking the train to work while reading the morning paper.  That line of thinking still resonates today, and it certainly adds a layer of complexity to a movie that's already interesting just dealing with the handful of relatively minor domestic and business issues that form its centerpiece.

To quibble a bit, the movie takes a little more time than it really needs to cover its subject matter, but on DVD that isn't much of a problem.  Just take a short break here and there and you'll do just fine.  The movie isn't an ordeal at all to get through.  Just sit back and enjoy the classy script, acting, and direction, and the excellent widescreen image, which was recently restored.

But before I conclude, let me throw out a quick question to all you amateur psychologists and armchair critics out there:  how come in every scene involving the children playing together or talking to their parents, the otherwise cheerful kids bring up the subject of dying, death, and/or getting killed?  It's not just one or two times, but every time there's an extended scene with the kids.  I found that interesting, so I just thought I'd put the question out there.

The movie revolves around three dilemmas facing Peck: 1) how to be honest with his boss while still toeing the line; 2) how to get clear title on a house left to him that someone else is trying to swindle from him; and 3) how to do the right thing when he learns he has a son in Rome by a woman he met during the war. None of these dilemmas is treated very carefully or seriously - in fact, all three are settled to the good with a minimal amount of effort or time expended: a neat little package. There is a lot of pondering over dilemma #1, which takes up much of the long (150+ minutes) movie's time, way too much of it. There are a lot of flashbacks of Peck in the war as well that don't add very much to the overall effect of the film. Just a very flat production.

347266,4,6301720555,"THE MAN IN THE GRAY FLANNEL SUIT (1956) is writer/director Nunnally Johnson's ambitious film version of the popular 1953 best-seller by Sloan Wilson.  It is set in suburban Connecticut and Rockefeller Center, linked by trains full of commuters.  One of those commuters is Gregory Peck, who does advertising for one of the big television networks run by his boss, Fredric March.  Johnson is setting up contrasts here.  Peck is married to Jennifer Jones and has three kids; March is married to 1930's actress Ann Harding and has a daughter named Susie.  Both March and Jones seem unhappy at home, happier at work.  But Peck is haunted by his past, in the Army in the Pacific in 1945 after World War Two is over in Europe.  Peck has an affair with lovely Marisa Pavan, who gives birth to his child.  What Peck will do with that Italian child covers the last half hour of the movie.

I like the film a lot because it gives us the clothes and cars and job world of my early childhood in the suburbia of 1950's San Francisco.  And the cast is incredible, including Lee J. Cobb, Henry Daniell, Arthur O'Connell, Gene Lockhart, and Keenan Wynn.  The brilliant use of CinemaScope, almost all in long shot with characters standing or sitting at opposite ends of the wide screen, is by Charles G. Clarke.  A magnificently knowledgeable audio commentary has film scholar James Monaco comparing movie and book constantly, often talking about his own life during this early 1950's period, the cars his father owned and the hats worn, and the stunning use of CinemaScope for a movie that simply could not withstand pan and scan treatment.  Maybe that is why it is not shown that often on TV, wonders Monaco; the only network that would always run it letterboxed, Turner Classics, does not own this Fox movie.  Thank God for DVD.

THE MAN IN THE GRAY FLANNEL SUIT runs a long 153 minutes, but maintains interest throughout and was a pet project of producer Darryl F. Zanuck.  This is from an era when a high-powered Production Chief could dictate that a movie run long to do justice to a long novel.  Monaco keeps saying that Jones' wife character is much nicer in the book and does not harp all the time on the quality of life she and Peck have in Connecticut.  She seems only a bit too unpleasant on screen for me, and the house they move out of is quite beautiful to me also.  That is a director's choice-or maybe Zanuck's choice.  Monaco also mentions the kids watching TV a lot in a darkened living room as not being in the book.  This is contrasted against a television network office at Rockefeller Center that only has two TV monitors and not the logical three, something I never would have picked up on, like a man wearing the wrong hat or driving the wrong year model car.  It is a very illuminating audio commentary by a movie lover and knowledgeable reader for a very good movie.  (REVIEWED ON LETTERBOXED DVD.)",1131062400,14,2907,4.591085271317829

347269,5,6301720555,"This review is for the 2005 Twentieth Century Fox DVD.

The movie is set in the mid-1950's where Gregory Peck stars as Tom Rath, a former World War II army captain, who now has a white-collar job in New York and has three kids, a home in a small town, with a caring, but socially ambitious wife.  Like all family men, Tom is pursuing ""the American dream"" but the reality is that there are plenty of obstacles.  Overall, the home life seems good, but in spite of having a pretty good job, a better one would solve a lot of financial issues on the home front.  Tom eventually takes on a new job working on Madison Ave.  His boss is an extremely successful businessman, but his home life is in shambles.  Tom has to walk a fine line between appeasing his new boss who seems lost in a new project and being a productive worker who gets results.  Also, something from Tom's past turns up unexpectedly and that's another issue that he has to deal with.  This sets up the rest of the movie with many issues for Tom and the people in his life to deal with.

`The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit' is a hard hitting commentary of life in the 1950's that historically seemed like an age of wholesomeness, prosperity and social bliss.  In an era of ""Father Knows Best"" and ""Ozzie & Harriet"" where the only problems in the world seemed to be nave kids getting into harmless trouble, but without exception, always received brilliant guidance with the wisdom and understanding of the seemingly perfect parents.  But in addition to a thorough examination of middle class life in the 1950's, a significant portion of this movie focuses on an army captain's social and combat life in World War II.  Unlike a typical WWII film where the good guys win, the bad guys lose, and main character is a hero, this film ventures in a completely different direction and deals with the consequences of a soldier's indiscriminant actions plus acknowledges the disturbing mental anxiety that person carries with him due to action in combat. In short, this film shows a dark side to all the pretentiousness of 1950's life in America.  Even though it's over 2-1/2 hours long, it's an excellent movie that pushes a lot of buttons and with plenty of realistic social commentary without being exploitive or preachy.

As for the DVD, the color widescreen presentation is superb.  The colors are bright and vivid with no signs of deterioration or stray artifacts. The DVD bonuses include commentary by author and publisher James Monaco, plus some minor features such as a trailer and some still photos.
