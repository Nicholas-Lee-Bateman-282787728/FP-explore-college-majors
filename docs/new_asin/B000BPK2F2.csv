8090606,3,B000BPK2F2,"The typical boy/girl relationships insue. Good characters good comedy. The shows run 12-15 minutes each so they are like little shorts. the story progresses kind of fast due to this, and some explanations are left out which is really ok for my taste. I give the series a thumbs up, though it is far from the best I have seen, ( it was not as good as say *Bludgeoning Angel Dokuro-Chan which I thought was hilarious!)it was worth watching and I would recomend it for the romantic comedy genre. Enjoy!
*Note if you like comedy and don't mind a lot of blood and guts ""in a good way,"" get Bludgeoning Angel Dokuro-Chan before this one.",1346025600,,631,4.495652173913044
8090607,5,B000BPK2F2,"This anime was completely adorable! When a little of shonen conjoined with shojo comes to life its amazing! I am disappointed on how its sound is though. Other than that this anime was beautifully made! The characters all adorable! There should have been more excitement in it though. I believe at least. And I agree with the review below mine (from cpuwizard), her attack was very, I don't know it wasn't as good as it should have been and every time she went to attack she screamed at the top of her lungs, that didn't go well with me it was very annoying. Other than that it was all amazingly made! Although I talk about all that stuff the story line was beautifully done, kudos! I stumbled upon this anime from Amazon when I was looking in my email and saw an email that said ""OVER 50% PERCENT OFF ON SELECT ANIME!"" so knowing me (anime is my calling so this was SHOUTING my name!) I clicked on the email and went straight to the page, with only thirty dollars left on my visa I bought it! I am very glad I did too! I recommend this anime to people who like GoKuSen or Samurai Deeper Kyo or Mirage of Blaze because those are rare anime shows in the United States. I also recommend this anime for the people who like to watch rare anime shows because this is one that's never been heard of until I opened that email and saw it and I knew I had to get it! Thank you Amazon!",1222732800,7,1375,4.212121212121212
8090608,4,B000BPK2F2,I feel this product is a good buy.  I only gave it a 4 because the girls power is a little on the weak side which offsets the batttles to much.  The plot is very good. The special effects are good also. I thoroughly enjoyed this series.,1208649600,6,236,4.0
