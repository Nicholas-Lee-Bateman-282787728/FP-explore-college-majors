8344650,5,B001UPO294,"When I first saw a screening of this film last year in San Jose, I wept for joy and decided on the spot to become friends with the film maker Brenden Hamilton and help him not only to promote the film but promote citizen diplomacy and peace with Iran. I did his interview for Payvand News, Pejvak of Persia and soon to be published in Persian Heritage Magazine. Brenden is the very best that American youth has to offer us, his kindness and compassion are obvious as is his instant love and appreciation of Iranian culture and youth. His casual technique of interviewing young people all around Iran is very effective as is his way of dispelling lies and propaganda in the West about Iran with subtle but firm and non controversial ways... as effective as passive resistance. He comes by it honestly as his late mother was a great activist and advocate for the Navajo especially the women, on Big Mountain Reservation in Arizona. In the film I saw my friends Jerry Dekker and Farzaneh Khademi, who also starred in the film Bam 6.6 by another person who has become my dear friend who shares our love and passion for peace.

I really want to thank Brenden for making this wonderful film about Iran and the kindenss and generosity of the Iranian people and my thanks also go to Mehdi Ghafourifar for helping to produce it. I highly recommend this DVD for anyone interested in peace.",1244332800,9,1379,4.582995951417004

This is a grass roots movie offering a perspective not yet seen in America.",1242345600,5,234,4.441860465116279
8344652,5,B001UPO294,"Iran: Hot Tea, Cool Conversations
is a insightful, unfiltered, and lighthearted look into modern Iranian culture. This film brings a much needed understanding of Iranian people and their views of Americans and vice versa. If you are looking for in depth information on Iranian government and it's relations to America this documentary doesn't have it. This film is more informing of the difference of impressions Americans have on Iran and iranian people, and how Iranian people really are.",1241136000,5,490,5.294871794871795
