8262426,4,B0016GOJWM,"I am an obsessive fan of Bollywood movies. The films of Gurinder Chadha (Bend It Like Beckham, Bride and Prejudice) were my gateway drug. As an avid devourer of Hindi movies, I felt my collection could not be complete without a copy of ""Amritsar to L.A."", the Hindi version of ""Bride and Prejudice."" I enjoyed watching this familiar film dubbed into Hindi. I know the film well enough that I could follow easily (although there seems to be additional footage in the Hindi version. After all, the American version would be much too short by Indian standards.) The songs, in my opinion, sound even better dubbed into Hindi. However, in my addlepated mind, everything sounds better in Hindi.

I'm glad I bought this film. Although it's not that great of a film, it is fun, and an important film to me. It's worth having in the collection, for sure.",1260576000,2,845,4.671140939597316
