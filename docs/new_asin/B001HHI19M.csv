This is an absolutely wonderful DVD for anyone who has balance and/or mobility issues and wishes to learn how to use trekking poles (also called Nordic walking poles and Nordic ski walking poles) to assist them in being able to walk better and thus be more active and independent.

The DVD is done primarily by Jayah Faye Paley, author of ""Poles for Hiking, Trekking, and Walking"". She is assisted by a physical therapist and a medical doctor in this video. To find out more, visit her web site at polesformobility.com. It is important to note that techniques for mobility are different than those for fitness and hiking, and the challenges are vastly different.

The Benefits section of the DVD discusses the scope of problems people can have (e.g., MS, Parkinson's, surgical recovery, Alzheimers) who may be helped by the poles, and in what ways they may be helped. Basically anyone who wants to retain mobility, and who checks with their physician would be a candidate for poles.

The Equipment section discusses care of use of the poles. Jayah uses the Leki poles, which are adjustable, but she demonstrates several other adjustable types of poles as well. I myself use non-adjustable poles for sturdiness and security, but I still found much useful information in this section.

The Balance and Mobility section is actually a complete demo class with actual pole users who are all people with various medical issues. It includes warm-up exercises for pole use, and covers straps, gloves, baseline length (if using adjustable poles), how to adjust poles, standing and sitting, strap progression (learning to use straps), stagger stance, resting, turning, two finger swing, reciprocal gait, gait issues, plant push (uphill technique), handling curbs, ramps, freezing, foot drop, sample learning progression, driveways, walking on sand, and wet terrain. It also covers pole care basics, caregiver tips, and exercises for mobility to ensure good technique.

The Tips and Exercises section is given by Dr. Jerald R. Gerst, MD, MPH, a physician who treats musculoskeletal injuries, and Diane Kern, and physical therapist. This section contains a review of certain principles and exercises.

The entire DVD was pleasant, informative, and interesting---a great value. Throughout the DVD, modifications and demos are done by people with actual medical issues. Problems are also addressed. Incorrect examples are demonstrated with corrections. Interspersed with the instruction, there are very encouraging and motivating testimonies by the various participants in the class.

This DVD was very helpful for me in modifying my routine to accommodate my knee issues. I had previously used poles for fitness, and was thrilled to find that I could, with extensive modifications, still continue by walks outside, albeit shorter and slower. I am delighted to still be able to participate in a fitness program, even with physical issues; I could not have done this without the safety and technique instructions from this video.

Highly recommended.

I highly recommend taking one of her classes if you're out in the Bay Area. I never suspected that there could be so much to learn about using poles. I had a cheap pair (no internal shocks, no padded wrist straps) that I bought years ago. They just gathered dust. Jayah helped fit me to a new pair and I use them all the time now. They are such a wonderful addition to exercise and make walking so much more fun!!",1227916800,5,534,4.35

3630351,5,B001HHI19M,"This is my first ever review. I stumbled on the DVD when looking for trekking poles. I didn't know anything about using poles and I decided to get the DVD. On the DVD, there is excellent demonstrations by Jayah Paley of proper techniques in all terrains, and advice about poles. Guess what? That's not the best part. You can email Jayah Paley and get personal advice. I sent her an email not really expecting to get a timely response or any response. I got an email the next day, and she suggested we chat on the telephone. I called her the next day, and she went over my physical limitations. She then explained the advantages and disadvantages of each pole set. We must have spoken for 30 minutes. Now, I can't wait to get my poles, and get started hiking again.",1327017600,4,764,4.425531914893617
3630352,5,B001HHI19M,"I appreciate what Jayah has done with this DVD.  I am a Personal Trainer who works with many people with mobility issues.  Jayah discusses several different mobility issues ranging from M.S to post-stroke and more.  I found this DVD to be informative, helpful and inspiring.  I am excited to see her other DVD ""Poles for Hiking, Trekking & Walking"".  I just purchased it an am looking forward to the tips and how-to's that I know her other DVD offers to hikers.

Jayeh really knows her stuff.  If you ever have the opportunity to attend her class you will find she is committed to the success of every individual in meeting their maximum potential.

The DVD is easy to follow and great for reference to make sure you are using the best technique.  I would highly recommend using poles and this DVD.",1293408000,,508,4.6
3630355,5,B001HHI19M,"The poles are very helpful in getting around, for those of us whose difficulty with balance make walking tricky.  But more than this technique and the equipment involved, which is excellent, is Jayah's spirit, enthusiasm and steady encouragement.  She is truly inspiring and conveys a real sense of caring.  I greatly appreciate the opportunity to work with her.

3630356,3,B001HHI19M,"""Jayah Faye Paley, the creator of the only comprehensive education available on how to use poles for hiking and walking"". This may very well be true, but it does nothing to improve this production.

 Like many aging adults, I am facing the common problems of impaired balance and reduced mobility.

 For a few years, I have been using a hiking pole, finding that it makes walking in general more endurable and enjoyable. With the onset of another Chicago winter and its promise of icy sidewalks, I decided to try a pair of trekking poles, as they are now called. In the course of my research, I learned about Ms. Paley, was impressed by her website and ordered the DVD.

 ""POLES for Balance & Mobility"" is marred by a lack of focus. When Paley actually describes how to use the poles to improve balance and mobility, she does well in an amateurish, camera-conscious way. The presentation is hokey, though, as she uses a group of elderly people marching around a stage to demonstrate her points. Frankly I thought this was not instructive, merely demeaning to her students.

 The most annoying part of the video is the interviews with way too many people talking about their problems with balance and mobility and how Paley and trekking poles proved beneficial. Perhaps the interviews are intended to be motivational. I don't know: I just felt that they took away from the main thing, teaching me how to use the trekking poles in everyday life, a subject that ultimately either get shortchanged in this video or isn't all that difficult to learn.

 The parts of the video dedicated to instruction were good and Paley clearly knows her stuff. Her instructions cover  many aspects of using poles that are not obvious and might never be discovered by the user going it alone. But the lessons are disjointed and in far too many instances, subjects are glossed over too quickly.

 On the whole, I am disappointed. However, this is the only game in town when it comes to using trekking poles expertly for ordinary daily balance and mobility challenges and until something better comes along, this will have to do.

3630357,5,B001HHI19M,"As a person who has participated in sports all my life, I was concerned when I was diagnosed recently with Parkinson's Disease that I would be unable to enjoy the benefits of vigorous exercise ever again.  Viewing Jayah's video was uplifting and inspiring for me.  Before I could purchase my poles, I attended a Parkinson's symposium and was delighted to find that one of the breakout sessions was a physical therapist introducing walking poles as aids for those with mobility issues. I tried pole walking for the first time there and was delighted with the confidence and stability I felt.  As a former marathoner, I was elated that I could walk faster than I normally do these days. I began to envision myself hiking again!

A highlight of this video which features not only technique and care of poles, is watching persons with mobility issues, in a classroom setting<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/POLES-for-Balance-Mobility/dp/B001HHI19M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">POLES for Balance & Mobility</a>&nbsp;learning to use their poles. Their testimonies are very encouraging.  Jayah is an awesome teacher, her instructions are clear and detailed. It is obvious that she is sincere in her mission to improve the lives of people with mobility challenges.  I am so thrilled that I happened on her web site and ordered this video.  I feel like pole walking will change my life!",1276300800,6,1412,5.420091324200913

8308755,5,B001HHI19M,"I was fortunate enough to take Jayah's POLES for Balance and Mobility class in person. She is very knowledgeable and skilled and I learned a lot. Everything I learned in class is on this DVD and I like that the DVD takes it at a slow enough pace so that you don't have to stop and rewind repeatedly. Plus there are helpful mobility tips that you might not think about until it is too late, such as: the ""foot painting"" technique to stimulate the nerves and muscles in the foot, ankle, and leg; and the suggestion to practice taking a step backwards so that you don't loose your ability to do so (a more common occurrence in people with balance/mobility concerns than an able-bodied person might realize).

I have chronic Lyme disease and it has affected my nerves making it difficult for me to walk without support. Learning how to use my hiking poles has made a huge difference in my life. I hated the canes I purchased at Walgreen's. They were bulky, drew attention to my disability, forced me to lean over and unbalance my center of gravity, forced me to put painful pressure on my wrists and shoulders, and took a lot of energy to use. I constantly felt unbalanced and in pain. Using the canes was barely better than not using them at all. As soon as I learned to use hiking poles correctly, I ditched the canes. I am more confident in my walking ability, have better balance, have no pain or pressure on my wrists and shoulders. And the hiking poles actually help me conserve energy.

I was an avid hiker before I got sick and thought I knew how to use hiking poles. I was wrong. Don't believe what the sports store people tell you. They don't know either. But Jayah does know! This DVD teaches you how to use hiking poles correctly and how to use them to assist with balance and mobility issues. (Check out the amazon review from O. Merce Brown for a list of what is covered on the DVD.) Now, I can safely and confidently step off a curb, walk a hill, use the stairs, and get in and out of a chair without worrying about falling. The hiking poles have given me a freedom I thought I had lost!",1464998400,5,2098,4.3631713554987215

8308760,5,B001HHI19M,"The DVD is well laid out and very informative. It is broken into sections so that one can quickly review the areas of interest with ease. I especially liked that Jayah included people, who like me, have difficulties with their balance and mobility. I could relate to their challenges.

Among the many areas covered, her DVD includes how to handle curbs and going up and down inclines, two areas that have been very difficult for me lately. I must add, correct placement of the straps is really important so really pay attention to her instructions. The poles feel like an extension of me when the straps are done right.

Jayah helped me select the right poles for my needs and I couldn't be happier with them.  What a difference my new poles make with my balance and mobility. Going up and down my slanted driveway is a breeze now.....something I was avoiding before Jayah's DVD and my poles.

Thanks Jayah for taking the time to make this DVD for us with Balance and Mobility issues.",1402272000,,984,4.605714285714286
8308761,5,B001HHI19M,I have perpherial neuropathy and arthritis in my feet and osteoarthritis in my knees and have trouble managing walking Europe's cobbled streets.  At the suggestion of a physical therapist I bought walking poles but was not able to get clear instructions on how to use them for balance.  This DVD answers these questions for me.  Next month I go to Croatia and Slovenia so I'll see how the poles and the instruction help.  Thank you!,1394668800,,432,4.72
