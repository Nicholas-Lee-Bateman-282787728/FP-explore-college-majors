8213620,4,B000UL61E8,"Goes from one extreme to a complete defferent extreme(pitbull fighting to pit bull dog shows), but worth it if you are interested in pitbulls.",1311206400,,142,4.958333333333333
8213621,2,B000UL61E8,"In the ocean of APBT DVD's exposing their kindness in front of those myths created by the media, this documentary barely cross the line even of simple entertaintment and information. Lousy archives and even worst explanations. Pass away if you can.",1246233600,,248,5.073170731707317
8213622,2,B000UL61E8,"Although the cover looks very interesting, the DVD seems a cut above a homemade video...",1243641600,3,88,4.933333333333334
8213623,5,B000UL61E8,"My family is not comprised entirely of Pit Bull people, but this DVD had even the non-APBT people sitting down to watch the whole thing.  It is the first APBT-related video I've viewed that makes an attempt to talk to dog owners from various walks of life, wheras the majority of alternatives out there seem to focus solely on dog fighting.  (Dog fighting is discussed, yes, as it is part of the breed.)  It includes interviews with people I've known about for years and respect as knowledgeable breed enthusiasts.  The production is professional-looking, and the music fits well with the video.

As with anything related to the American Pit Bull Terrier, I don't agree with every statement made in this movie.  At one point I snarled at my TV, 'they do NOT bite at 3000psi; that's a myth!""  But that's the beauty of a documentary that went to great lengths to talk to different people; you're going to get different perspectives.  Part of the DVD discusses this breed in the inner cities, part of it discusses weight pull, French Ring, breed-specific legislation, the bully-style dogs, and so on.  There's a little something for everybody.

I would absolutely recommend this DVD to anyone interested in learning about the breed.  Even if you feel you already know everything there is to know, this is still a worthy addition to any collection.  Braverman productions did an excellent job with this one, and I hope they see fit to do another in the future.",1215302400,11,1456,4.78
8213624,5,B000UL61E8,"I believe this is a very educational documentary. If you have an open mind, and want to educate yourself on this breed, this will be an excellent choice. I truly believe that after you educate yourself on this breed, you can't help falling in love with them.",1203292800,5,258,4.51063829787234
8213625,4,B000UL61E8,Highly recommend this DVD to all american pitbull terrier lovers out there. Buy this DVD you won't be disappointed. Shows what the true story and facts about this noble and misunderstood breed.,1202083200,5,193,5.0625
