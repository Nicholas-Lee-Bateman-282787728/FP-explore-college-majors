4949138,4,B0064E8EQ8,"Being American, I have very little nostalgia for Tintin.  I never read the books growing up, never watched the cartoon series.  Over the years I have picked a few books up and learned to love Belgian artist Herge's most famous creation, but I am watching these episodes of The Adventures of Tintin for the first time.

Obviously, it is the big-budget The Adventures of Tintin (which I also haven't seen) that prompted the release of these season box-sets of the 1991 Canadian production.  Despite their worldwide popularity, adaptations of Tintin are fairly rare.  The only previous series was a 1960 Belgian animation Herg&eacute;'s Adventures of Tintin that is somewhat despised for re-writing and re-working Herge's stories.  By contrast, this Canadian series is said to be so faithful to the source material that the animators actually transposed pages from the book directly onto the screen.  There were a few cuts made here and there--mostly cutting down on Captain Haddock's taste for whiskey or softening the violence and death--but even then these cartoons have a harder edge than your average American animation from the same era.

Even if you know nothing about Tintin these stories are still good fun.  You will soon become familiar with the characters; Tintin himself is a brave boy adventurer in the tradition of Johnny Quest and Rusty Venture. Tintin never really steals the show or makes himself the star, but is instead a somewhat blank character that allows all of the wild personalities around him to shine. Thomson and Thompson, the two bumbling yet oblivious detectives, were my favorites in the series.  They could always be counted on to do something ridiculous to get the story moving. Captain Haddock and Professor Calculus were excellent when played off of each other.

There are thirteen episodes in all, most of which are two-parters telling a continued story over two episodes.

The stories are:
* The Shooting Star
* The Broken Ear - Parts 1 & 2
* King Ottokar's Scepter - Parts 1 &2
* Tintin in Tibet - Parts 1 & 2
* Tintin and the Picaros - Parts 1 & 2
* Land of the Black Gold - Parts 1 & 2
* Flight 714 - Parts 1 & 2

I can't say that I really had a favorite episode; I loved them all.  Everyone is a classic adventure tale, taking Tintin all over the world.  I am a sucker for desert adventures, so seeing Tintin in full Bedouin garb for Land of the Black Gold was cool. The stories don't follow the order that Herge wrote them in, which means you get the cynical Tintin of later episodes like Tintin and the Picaros mixed with the young fresh Tintin of The Broken Ear.  Even though I haven't read all of the books,  I noticed the difference in characterization--Tintin refusing an adventure? Unheard of!  It wasn't until I read a bit more about Tintin that I knew that his personality changed over time.

The one complaint I have is that these DVDs are completely barebones.  There is nothing here but the episodes.  I realize that these were probably made for a quick sale to capture parents whose kids enjoyed the movie, but a bit about the original books, or something about Herge himself, would have been appreciated.

I never watched these as a kid--and to be honest, I wasn't what people would call a ""kid"" in 1991 when they were originally released--but I am watching them all as an adult.  There are three seasons in all, for a total of 39 episodes, and you can bet that all three box-sets are going to be in my collection.",1334016000,13,3467,4.647540983606557
4949139,5,B0064E8EQ8,"The adventures of the young journalist and adventurer Tintin have been thrilling European and American audiences in many languages for over half a century in graphic novel format, yet the stories remain fresh and exciting for each new generation of fans.  The release of the big screen production ""The Adventures of Tintin"" has prompted the release on DVD of this early 1990's animated Tintin television adaptation.  Tintin and his faithful dog Snowy are joined in some of the adventures by Tintin's good friend Captain Haddock, the bumbling detectives Thompson and Thomson, and the absent-minded Professor Calculus.

Season Two contains seven stories, six of them arranged in two parts, for a total of 13 episodes.  The episodes average just over 20 minutes, just right for the attention span of fans too young for the movie.  The animation style very closely imitates that of the original comics, while the stories have been minimally edited for the episode length.  The voice actors were British, but this should not be a distraction for viewers.  Tintin's boy scout ethics are TV-safe for any age.

Season Two contains ""The Shooting Star"", ""The Broken Ear"", ""King Ottokar's Sceptre"", ""Tintin in Tibet"", ""Tintin and the Picaros"", ""Land of Black Gold"", and ""Flight 714"".  ""Tintin in Tibet"" in particular is considered one of the very best Tintin stories.  It and Season Two are very highly recommended to fans of Tintin of any age, including those fans wishing to introduce Tintin to their younger children.",1332806400,9,1509,5.122448979591836
4949140,4,B0064E8EQ8,"I got turned on to The Adventures of Tintin in fifth grade, which was about 20 years ago.  I remember that alot of kids in my class wanted to read the books, which were available to check out in the school library.  And there never were any copies available when i wanted to check one out.  It used to make me mad, I'm laughing right now thinking about it.  We were all so obsessed with wanting to read those books that year.

And now, they have made a Tintin movie.  I'll have to see it sometime.  This DVD set here is the second series of episodes they released for the cartoon series, from the early 90's.

The episodes in this set are:  The Shooting Star, The Broken Ear, King Ottokar's Sceptre, Tintin in Tibet, Tintin and the Picaros, Land of Black Gold, and Flight 714.  Six of those are two-part episodes, which makes a total of 13 episodes in this set.",1325635200,48,861,4.291925465838509

4949255,3,B0064E8EQ8,"After I saw the recent CGI reboot of Tintin, I fell in love with the Indiana Jones-style Adventures of Tintin as the protagonist searches for long-lost artifacts and treasures.  Tintin and Snowy are delightful characters, and the always volatile Captain Haddock and bumbling brothers Thompson provide amusing color.

The biggest complaint I have about this season is that the plots have moved away from historical artifact hunting and have moved more generally into political detective work.  Perhaps it is unfair to want a continuation of the animated Indiana Jones stories that characterized the first season, but the Tintin theme song seems composed to evoke the comparison.

I will also say that the two-episode format gets a little repetitive.  Most of the story lines span two episodes, and the second of these spends a good five of 23 minutes recapping the previous one.  Clearly this weekly serial television format has not translated well into the marathon-season viewing of the digital age.

Personally, I enjoyed the first season of the show much better.  I still watched all the episodes from this second season, and I found the stories entertaining and the characters endearing, but the political adventures intrigue me less than the archeological ones.",1371859200,2,1266,5.232673267326732

4949275,4,B0064E8EQ8,"Tintin films have now branched into two different modes.  There is now the amazingly lifelike Tintin theatrical movie (by Steven Spielberg) that was created using ""Motion Capture"" techniques similar to those used in the excellent ""Polar Express"".  The other branch is more of a cartoon-like format done by the folks at Nirvana.
I believe both branches are worthy of one's consideration; especially if you are a tried-and-true Tintin fan.
The Nivana branch was a series especially created for TV and the animation is excellent.  Somehow they were able to capture the look of Tintin & Co. that is amazingly faithful to Herge's original books.  There were two seasons created and include most (if not all) of the Tintin book stories.  The two outer space adventures (""Destination Moon"" and ""Explorers on the Moon"") were especially well done and are included in the Season One set.  On the other hand, the Spielberg movie combined serveral of the Herge' stories into one film; but it was also exceedingly well done.  Therefore I heartily recommend both this Nirvana set as well as the First Season set and, of course, the Tintin movie.
P.S. The Season Two set also includes the UFO adventure ""Flight 714"" and the Alien Meteor adventure ""The Shooting Star"".  Enjoy",1339200000,2,1259,4.990430622009569

4949278,4,B0064E8EQ8,"Back in 1929, Belgian artist Georges Remi aka ""Herg"", would create a comic book series titled ""Les Adventures de Tintin"" (The Adventures of Tintin) which was first published in the Belgian Newspaper Le XXe Siecle.

The comic book series would prove to be successful that it was made into several books, led to a Tintin magazine and also received aptations for film, radio, television and theater.

In fact, the comic book series was so popular that it appeared in many countries worldwide in more than 80 languages and over 350 million copies of the books were sold worldwide.

But for many people who were not familiar with the comic books or other adaptations, in America, many were introduced to ""The Adventures of Tintin"" through the animated series that aired on television back in 1991-1992. A total of 39 half-hour episodes were created and are based on the best-known stories from the book. And now the second season (episodes 14-26) of ""The Adventures of Tintin"" was released on DVD courtesy of Shout! Factory.

In order to appeal to a younger audience, there were some changes that needed to be made. The key change was toning down the violence, the number of deaths and also the use of firearms. Especially how the series would approach the use of alcohol, which Captain Haddock drinks a lot of. Each time that Tintin is injured, he is able to bounce back to recover fairly quickly. So, a few liberties were taken in order to appeal to children. But certain elements such as the threats on Tintin's and Snowy's lives are still intact to a certain degree.

""The Adventures of Tintin"" features an adventurous Belgian reporter named Tintin who goes on adventures with his white fox terrier named Snowy. The cases he takes on are typically dangerous and is often seen saving the day. Joining Tintin is his best friend Captain Archibald Haddock, a respectable character who does things without thinking at times.

Other characters include the half-deaf Professor Calculus, who many international thieves are after his inventions. And there are the two bumbling detectives named Thomson and Thomson who are the comical relief of the series that are often after Tintin (as he is always in the middle of a crime scene in some way or form) or somehow find themselves treated as criminals.

The following is a spoiler free synopsis of each story arc:

DISC 1:

  EPISODE 18 - King Ottokar's Sceptre Part 2 - Tintin investigates the stolen scepter of King Ottokar IV.
  EPISODE 19 - Tintin in Tibet Part 1 - When Tintin and Captain Haddock read about a plane crash in the Himalayas and that his friend Chang was on the plane. Tintin has a dream that his friend Chang is alive and Tintin and Captain Haddock go to find him.

  EPISODE 26 - Flight 714 Part 2 - Can Tintin and friends are being held captive.  Can they escape?

VIDEO AND AUDIO:

It's important to note that ""The Adventures of Tintin"" was created in the early '90s and is an older series that was never fully detailed compared to popular American animation series. But it fit the context of the comic book series quite wonderfully.

The series is presented in full frame and while the animation does show its age and looks a bit washed out, the animation still manages to hold up quite well 20-years later and is highly watchable. As one would expect on DVD, you will see some ghosting but for the most part, the DVD looks good.

As for audio, the audio is presented in English and Spanish Dolby Stereo 2.0. Dialogue is clear and understandable and didn't hear any major hissing or any audio problems while watching each episode.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

There are no special features on ""The Adventures of Tintin: Season Two"" DVD release.

JUDGMENT CALL:

With the film version of ""The Adventures of Tintin"" from Steven Spielberg having been released in theaters, there was no doubt that Herge's classic was going to attract old and new fans of his work.

Before the more grown up animation that we see today, during the 1990's, many series were created to boost the sales of popular toylines such as ""Transformers"", ""G.I. Joe"" to name a few. And many animation on television were primarily targeted towards younger audiences.

While, superhero animated series such as ""X-Men"", ""Spider-Man"" and ""Batman"" were popular and introduced elements of mystery, what makes ""The Adventures of Tintin"" so accessible is that he's a normal guy. Granted, he must work for a wealthy publication that can send him to exotic locations for his research but nevertheless, he's a regular guy who goes on investigations with his terrier Snowy and his friend Captain Haddock.

Also, what makes this series different from other animated series is that he is often the target of kidnappings and even assassination attempts. Because he always covers these cases that are typically dangerous, he manages to get himself into quite a bit of trouble. Or more like, trouble finds him quite often!

He's not a superhero with any major fighting skills, he's not a detective nor does he carry a weapon. He's just a persistent journalist that happens to be successful in uncovering and solving cases. And because the stories tend to feature him in a variety of locations all over the world, ""The Adventures of Tintin"" is an animated series that manages to be exciting, adventurous, full of action and a lot of fun to watch!

If you are nostalgic for this series or wanting to watch the upcoming live-action film and want a bit more background on the classic adventures of Tintin, ""The Adventures of Tintin: Season Two"" is definitely worth watching!

With the second series which coincides with the books (with slight differences), the adventures of Tintin continues as he and his dog Snowy, Captain Haddock and even Professor Calculus get involved in quite a few adventures where their lives are constantly in danger (suffice to say, Tintin always finds trouble but he always finds a way out and help others along the way).

For the second season, the stories are a bit far out as Tintin comes across adventures that involve a meteorite, a stolen scepter, a yeti and throw in an extra-terrestrial as well.  But there are a lot of action-packed episodes as Tintin and Captain Haddock find themselves in a warzone, climbing the snowy areas of Tibet in order to find a good friend that Tintin believes is a live and also in the middle of the desert as Tintin tries to find a child who was kidnapped.

Once again, you get 13 exciting episodes and it leads to the final third season of ""The Adventures of Tintin"".

It's important to note that although this series is animated, because of the violence, it's not a series that you may want to buy for younger children or have them in the room watching.  While the death count was nothing like the first season, parents should know that this series maybe a bit too mature for children to understand and a little violent for them to watch.

Overall, if you are nostalgic of the series or have never heard of ""The Adventures of Tintin"" and are interested in seeing the upcoming live-action film, the animated series is accessible and for the most part, a welcome addition to the animated library from Shout! Factory.
