7830588,3,630276498X,"SUDDEN THUNDER (1990) - Patricia Merrill (Andrea Lamatsch; BLOOD RING - 1991) is an undercover Miami cop who we first meet singing some bad disco tune at a nightclub and she immediately blows her cover by getting caught planting a bug in a back room where a big drug deal is going down. This leads to a big shootout, where Patricia and her fellow officers shoot all the bad guys (some in the back!) and nearly destroy all the drug evidence in a hail of gunfire. On a totally unrelated note, Patricia's father, a sheriff in the small jerkwater Florida town of Wilbury County, is killed when Mike Gray (Mike Monty; LAST FLIGHT TO HELL - 1990) and his men run his car off the road and set it on fire, burning him alive. Patricia goes to Wilbury County alone to investigate and is captured by Mike, who orders his men to take her into the woods and kill her. The men, of course, decide to rape her first (Goon #1: ""Harlan, you got crabs, so you go last!"" Harlan: ""I got them from your sister!""), but Patricia escapes and is saved by her late father's black moonshiner friend, Jake Stokes (Jeff Griffith; FINAL REPRISAL - 1988), who nurses her back to health (Alert: gratuitous skinny dipping scene and it's not bad). When they don't hear from Patricia in a few days, a quartet of her Miami cop buddies, Tom (Corwyn Sperry), Tony (James Paolelli), Jack (Ernie Santana) and Max (Ned Hourani), head to Wilbury County and run into the new sheriff: Mike Gray! The four Miami cops get into a barroom brawl and are forced to kill the shotgun-toting bartender. Mike arrests them and tosses them in jail, where the crooked mayor, Bob (Anthony East; FAST GUN - 1987; here using the pseudonym ""Albert Bronsky""), orders Mike to kill them all, but Patricia breaks them out before Mike can carry out the order. Patricia brings them all back to Jake's shack, where Jake tells them that something illegal is going on, but he doesn't know what it is. What he is sure of, though, is that it is going on at an abandoned plantation, so Jake takes them there, where they overhear Mike and Bob talking about a major cocaine shipment coming in tonight by plane. Also on the plane is Alfredo Strocssner (Robert Marius; FIST OF GLORY - 1991; here using the pseudonym ""Edward Burnett""), a ""half-Nazi, half-Brazilian"" drug lord who is responsible for killing Tom's partner in the past and getting away with it on a legal technicality. Our heroic Miami cops wait for the drug deal to take place, steal the shipment and try to fly back to Miami, but Max is shot and injured (not to mention almost being killed in a pretty impressive plane explosion) and they are forced to escape into the woods. Alfredo becomes mightily ticked-off that his cocaine is gone, so he brings in a lot of his own men to search the woods. When Max dies of his injuries and Jake sacrifices himself, Patricia and the two remaining Miami cops get vengeance on Mike, Bob and Alfredo.  Technically, the film is a mess, with a lousy sound recording mix (the music drowns out most of the dialogue) and some hinky editing and camerawork, but director/producer David Hung (here using the name ""David Hunt"") and screenwriter Steve Rogers (both responsible for the comedic actioner TRIPLE IMPACT in 1992) still manage to wrangle some suspense and good action set-pieces on a paltry budget, including the aforementioned plane explosion; a tense situation involving an overturned pickup truck with Jake's leg trapped underneath it; a helicopter/motorboat chase; and plenty of gunfights and explosions. Thankfully, the acting talents of Andrea Lamatsch (who sounds like she is channeling Arnold Schwarzenegger) takes a back seat to the action and while there is very little blood or gore (just some bloody bullet squibs and a nifty bullet-to-the-head shot), it's nice to see a bunch of American expatriate actors like Corwyn Sperry, James Paolelli, Ernie Santana, Ned Hourani, Jeff Griffith, Robert Marius, Anthony East and Mike Monty get some major screen time for a change instead of playing their normal secondary or background characters (Monty gets the best death scene here, as Paolelli shoves a stick of dynamite in his mouth and blows him out a window). Not a bad way to spend 95 minutes as long as you don't set your sites too high. Shot in the Philippines by Davian International Productions. Nick Nicholson puts in a cameo as a disco manager and Henry Strzalkowski puts in a quick appearance as ""Harvey Scruggs"". Released on VHS by A.I.P. Home Video. Not available on DVD.
