7964287,5,B000068M9Y,"Sailor Moon R is my favorite season

In the first 13 episode of the season, during the Doom Tree part of the season, I enjoyed the story most of all. I found the relationship, the love square, going on between Serena, Darian, Alan, and Anne to be amazing. I had never seen anything like it before in my life, mostly because I was young when it started. It was probably what made me think Love Triangles and Love Squares where a great idea for writing in my own future.

The second half of the season was great but it had several episodes that I found unappealing because the story line of those episodes was lame. Still, over all, the whole season was amazing, the entire story lines, both of them, for start to end were great. The Crystal Tokyo part of the story was amazing to.

I would suggest that everyone watch this season.",1372550400,,829,4.37012987012987

7964292,4,B000068M9Y,"The Doom Tree Strikes is a terrific DVD for Sailor Moon fans of all ages.  Six episodes feature the wicked couple Alan and Ann, who are seeking energy for their beloved Doom Tree, which is also the source of their own lives.  Alan and Ann enroll at Serena's school.  Despite their mission, Alan immediately fixates on Serena, Ann on Darien.  But Darien doesn't return Ann's affections.  In fact, he doesn't return Serena's affections either, for Darien has lost his memory of the Sailor Scouts, Tuxedo Mask, and the recent battle with Queen Beryl.

Although Tuxedo Mask is AWOL, the Scouts do have a mysterious ally in the gorgeous, Lawrence-of-Arabia type ""Moonlight Knight.""  Serena immediately thinks the Moonlight Knight is Darien, but Darien says he has no idea who that guy is.

Serena's lovely lavender-haired mother makes a rare and beautiful appearance in the episode ""Cherry Blossom Time.""  Each of the scouts stars in an episode, except Mercury, because Serena is featured in two episodes.

The dubbing is very good.  Don't waste time - buy this DVD for your collection.",1129939200,6,1081,4.983240223463687
