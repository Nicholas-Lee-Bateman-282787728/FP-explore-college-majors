3788748,5,B001TCL1D8,"I just saw this film and must say that Fangoria hit the mark by describing
it as one of the best independent horror films to come along in quite some time.  For those individuals who criticize the movie for for sub-par dialogue and acting, then I would ask them to show me any horror movie
where the actors are up for academy awards--it's the nature of the genre that defines the style of the acting.  For those who criticize it on the basis of being stupid, I would like for them to point out a horror movie that is ""intelligent.""  The horror genre is designed to scare, make one feel uncomfortable or uneasy, present elements of the grotesque, attempt to present something a bit different, have some unexpected twists and turns--Plague Town does all of this on some level.  Moving forward in the horror genre, there will probably never be anything new invented under the sun, what has been tried will probably be re-tried in a director's own way.  If one is looking for something completely new, unique, and never done before in the horror genre, then one will be consistenetly and forever disappointed.  If the horror masters--Stephen King, Clive Barker,
John Carpenter, George Romero, Stuart Gordon, etc. can't come up with something novel in the horror genre, then it probably can't be done.  It may be that critics of the movie Plague Town and films like it have lost the sense of what horror is supposed to be all about.  The criticisms of horror always seem to be the same--it doesn't have this, it doesn't have that, and it doesn't have the other thing--what the heck are you looking for anyway?  Will anything please you at all?  Anyway, Plague Town is a very good independent horror movie and well worth watching.  Although I would like to hav seen more to the ending, I understand that they were probably working with a low budget and commend the director and cast for what they were able to accomplish.  Even high-budget horror movies are still disappointing to many, so maybe it's a mute point.  If you want to see something a bit different in horror, then give Plague Town a watch.",1243641600,7,2096,4.64769647696477
3788749,2,B001TCL1D8,"The movie was okay and had somewhat of a plot.  You need to think a bit how the first scene related to the rest of the movie.  Acting was so-so.  Make-up was so-so.  Actually, much of it was pretty bad.  One of the main characters (the British guy) was incredibly resilient, as you will see if you buy or rent this movie.  It's incredible how tough people are in movies versus in real life.  LOL

A big disappointment was both the transfer and the sound.  The picture was really much more grainy than it should be for Blue-Ray.  I would say save your money and get the standard DVD, but, as of this writing, the DVD is actually more expensive than the Blu-Ray.  That is, if you actually want the movie.

The sound was also pretty bad.  As another poster states, it's retro; Implying front-stage only.  Your surrounds will definitely get a break during this movie.  I actually thought that they stopped working for awhile.  The authors were kind enough to donate some bass though.

My recommendation would be to rent this movie first before buying.  I have a feeling it's readily available at your local rental shop.  Had I done that first, I would have not purchased.",1243036800,,1167,4.524038461538462
3788750,5,B001TCL1D8,"I mean when people discover it on DVD and Blu-ray.

A path less slashed, style wise. Travelers meeting very weird locals, is a point of departure. Good looking, moody and shot on film. You may notice that this is not a big budget Hollywood Studio release and it's direct to video; But!... Let's call it a soft opening. It's a real horror movie. This is a 'must be a hit by Halloween Film' because I've found a new film for that tradition.  Slow creep outs, surprises and fresh horror ideas with power; and it just keeps geting better; and a mild but deviant erotic element pushes the envelope!  More 70s style shocks that reverberate into the  now and maybe into next decade. A great horror fiim; not to miss.
A/V on BD is a treat. Sound mix is almost retro style also but will activate a booming bass, a crackling treble and everything you want from DTS Masterless. The filmmakers were into sound and there's an extra about that.",1242777600,4,930,4.485207100591716
3788751,1,B001TCL1D8,"This is my first Amazon review ever. I just didn't feel like writing one before. Why now? Because watching this DVD really annoyed me.

This is by far one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. It's simply dumb. Bad acting (sometimes very bad...), an absolutely uncredible plot (to be honest: there isn't even a plot), no atmosphere, no thrills, no scares. The whole movie is strictly illogical and absurd - from beginning to end. Watching it is a complete waste of time. I've seen amateur horror films that, in retrospective, seem like masterpieces compared to this sorry effort.

Gore just for gore's sake, lots of children with cheap monster-makeup and a crude, tension-free ""story"" is what you get if you buy this movie.

Just don't.",1242604800,2,744,4.751937984496124
3788752,5,B001TCL1D8,"I saw this movie back in November 2008 and absolutely loved it! It does have that 70's horror feel to it, like the director took you back to how a real horror movie is supposed to be, or he was showing us this is why he fell in love with horror. The story does not go flat and keeps you wondering how they're all going to die... of course death in inevitable when you're lost in the middle of nowhere as the day is fading away (hehe). From opening scream to the ending shocker, I don't want to sound too cliche but this movie was good to the last drop!

Now that it's out on DVD, I've got a copy & have been recommending it to my friends as well as my fellow amazonians. If you like 70's horror i.e. Texas Chainsaw Massacre, you'll like this one, guaranteed!",1242086400,4,758,4.121621621621622
3788753,1,B001TCL1D8,"As a horror fan that can find some merit in almost anything (I liked the Black Christmas remake for Christ's sake), I am here to warn others not to buy into the hype for this movie.  First off, the entire budget must have been spent on paying people for good reviews.  I know film is subjective and as I said I actually love movies that I know are bad, but they are entertaining.  This movie is by far the worst ""horror"" movie I have seen in a long long time.  I actually blind purchase films and lately I have been very lucky with movies like Martyrs, Eden Lake, Inside, Splinter, etc..  but my lucky strike ends here.

The acting, OMG, it makes Tara Reid or Paris Hilton seem like Meryl Streep.  The cinematography, the sound editing, the lighting, the continuity..it is all so amateurish and boring that I cannot believe people out of High School worked on this!

There are no scares, the atmosphere is non existent (unless you like listening to 5 people fight non-stop for an entire hour in the most un-realistic manner possible).

I am sorry for the bitter review, but out of 1000s of bad movies I have never felt this ripped off.  I wanted to warn those of you who go by the reviews to seriously RENT this if you must, but I am telling you that these reviews on here have to be fake or planted by the studio.  Any publication associated with this mess I will never trust again. Hands down the worst ""horror"" movie in ages.  Troma couldn't even make something this bad if they tried.

Heck, the Grudge 3 which was released today is infinitely better - if you can imagine that.

PS:

All the good reviews for this film?  If you check the reviewers other reviews - you won't see any.  These are their first.  PLANTS.",1242086400,5,1719,4.386075949367089

3788755,5,B001TCL1D8,"Captain's log...Star date March 6th 2009

Dear Fellow Customers of Amazon.com --

I have a special film to review for you this time. It comes from the new face of horror, David Gregory. For a master of horror he has quite an brilliant, young, honest little face. Somebody better get Mick Garris on the phone! Wow, what a show! If you are a fan of horror and the supernatural, look no further then this creepy little number.

Just when you thought it was safe to have a fancy on the Irish countryside, depraved little children force you to play a series of parlor games in a 'ring-around-the-yourdead' style manner. This film is all about things being menacing. If you are a fan of menacing happenings, then please goddamnmit, don't look anywhere else then right here... right here in PLAGUE TOWN (And what a trip it will be! Just watch out for the children! lol) The children are menacing. The town is menacing. The girl with the creepy eyes is menacing. MENACING.

The film channels fear as a shape. Something 3d. Something you can hold in your hand, but at the same time nothing your mind would let you hold in your hand. Think DEATHMACHINE meets DEADLY SPAWN. A shape like that. Gregory, as shaman, crafts such a spell of nightmarish qualities that it shall leave each opposing horror-sorcerer with all his mana drained.

And I know this because most of my friends in my life have been female and I've only had a few male acquaintances. And the men have definitely turned me off - the majority of them because they are rude, crude, and inconsiderate..causing wars and such. But, women are so kind and sweet...and you don't have to look at any of them in bikinis or in the nude to fully appreciate their inner beauty.",1236297600,6,1719,4.586319218241043
3788756,1,B001TCL1D8,"Great Gertie's Nightgown!  What in the world was THIS all about?  I'm given a cast of characters who are so full of loathing you can't stand a single one:  Two sisters that constantly b*tch at one another; a milquetoast step mom, a father who needed to be slapped until someone's arms got tired, and a ""local"" who is simply there for ""boinky-boinky"" purposes.  Lord, this was like attending a family reunion.  The viewer is never told why all these children are cursed...with bad makeup...and why--after being stabbed with a piece of broken glass by one of the local darlings--the father didn't have sense enough to just get the hell out of Dodge.  Let's just say this amounted to 85 minutes of my life that I'll never get back.  And, as one previous reviewer pointed out, I'm glad I rented this before I decided to buy it.  BIG change of heart there...",1301875200,,853,4.602649006622516
3788757,4,B001TCL1D8,"Plague Town is about an American family who visits the countryside areas of Ireland.  Most of the film takes place in the dark but luckily -unlike MOST horror films that focus on night scenes- you can actually SEE what's taking place most of the time.

It starts off with the two American sisters constantly fighting with each other by cussing and criticizing each other every single chance they get, but then the family eventually splits up after missing a bus by merely seconds.  From here... the scares begin.

I personally found most of Plague Town pretty unsettling thanks to the creepy dark setting inside an Irish forest being the center of focus for the majority of the time.  Throughout the film, the American family was running through this forest filled with children who were apparently possessed and trained to kill any and all outsiders.

The film is definitely not shy with the violence.  You will witness a lot of violent deaths, blood, guts flying, people being tortured unexpectedly, etc.

One thing I found interesting is that in most horror films like this one, there's usually some normal people around the town area somewhere willing to help the innocent people and try to help them escape, but Plague Town doesn't really have any completely normal people running around.  Everybody seems a bit odd.

The ending is a bit shocking too.  Let's just say, when I *thought* it was going to be over, a little surprise came along after that.

Not a bad film by any means, and perhaps even a tad underrated because most people fail to find anything interesting about it.  The storyline may be weak, but the actual violence seems pretty good to me.",1291680000,,1661,4.7859649122807015
3788758,2,B001TCL1D8,"Plague Town (David Gregory, 2008)

I sometimes wonder what the guys who write movies like this are thinking, and why they decide to do it. You take a dash from movie A, a dash from movie B, and paste them onto the structure of movie C. You make no changes, you don't deviate from the formula, and it should be no surprise that you end up with derivative crap. And yet movie after movie just like this gets pumped out year after year, and with the advent of direct-to-video about twenty years ago, the number of movies put together just like this exploded. I've seen hundreds of them, but you have to dig through a lot of swine to find the real pearls. Plague Town is swine through and through.

Plot: ever-so-typical dysfunctional family heads to Ireland to try and reconnect with its roots, and maybe heal their wounds in the process. Our intrepid group consists of dad, Jerry (Follow the Broccoli's David Lombard); stepmom, Annette (Enjoy Yourself's Lindsay Goranson); and two sisters, older Jessica (18-Year-Old Virgin's Erica Rhodes), who's picked up a local boyfriend, Robin (In Flanders Fields' James Warke) along the way, and younger Molly (Brutal Massacre: A Comedy's Josslyn DeCrosta). They wander the countryside after being dropped off by a bus, looking for... something. They end up in the wrong, wrong place, however--a village full of evil, deformed children who love nothing more than trapping and torturing unwary travelers. Though they have something very, very different in mind for the sisters...

Yes, you've seen it all before. Take the bones of Village of the Damned and drape them with trappings from Eternal and every Lifetime Original Movie drama about dysfunctional families ever made and you've got the idea here. Needless to say, familiarity not only breeds contempt, but predictability as well. Why bother renting this one? The synopsis will give you all you need to know to rent better-made movies with the same basic ideas. * ",1288742400,,1957,4.939209726443769
3788759,1,B001TCL1D8,This was more like a badly made (Hills have eyes or Wrong turn) set in the English country side. The family unit walks around aimlessly in the woods waiting to die. Meeting badly made up mutant kids with an extreme mean streak and a bunch of crazy parents. To make it even worse no one fights back or even try to protect themselves while being beaten and killed. Another waste of our hard earned money.,1288742400,2,402,4.373333333333333
3788760,3,B001TCL1D8,"A family's idyllic vacation turns into a terrifying nightmare when their last bus home leaves them stranded in the Irish countryside. They soon discover that they are not alone when a group of deformed children begin stalking them through the woods. PLAGUE TOWN is bogged down by weak dialog and robotic performances that make the first half of the film a difficult watch. Things pick up immediately once the children set in on their victims and the family stops talking and starts running. It makes up for its many difficulties with an increasing sense of dread, moody atmospherics, and an ample amount of gore. The dimly lit forest setting and fog-laden sets call back to the supernatural 60s and 70s, bringing to mind films like LEMORA and LET'S SCARE JESSICA TO DEATH. Most horrifying of all are the children's twisted make-up designs that resemble fiendish porcelain dolls. David Gregory's first feature film provides plenty of disturbing imagery and haunting sound effects, but unfortunately his skills as a director do not carry over into his writing.

There were a few creepy parts involving the ""eye"" girl, but there really was not a whole lot of explanation for what the hell was going on. I love a good independant horror flick as much as the next guy, but this was pretty bad. Rent first before you decide to make your purchase.",1256515200,,415,4.135802469135802

3788764,2,B001TCL1D8,"Freaky and weird and the potential for this movie was never discovered.  The ending ruined the movie for me (as so many times happens unfortunately so don't look too much into that).  It's not necessarily bad acting, but the actors/actresses seem really uncomfortable or even new to the profession and it shows (except for Rosemary).  The more I think about it, the actors/actresses seem to be my biggest problem with the film.

As a B movie it was not a flop but didn't live up to the potential I saw (mostly the actors/actresses I think).  Many, MANY things seemed way over the top.  The characters don't really fight back, and then all of a sudden they go berzerk with sharp objects; but then they can kill one minute and the very next they are not fighting back at all.  So it's pretty erratic how the characters will react.  At times they are just being slapped with little branches and sit there and take it.  Then someone comes and starts to beat them up and they still just take it.  People trying to get away once they know what is going on spend too much time pausing and thinking instead of running.  The missing ""common sense"" of the characters in their situations just adds to the poor acting.  A wire being pulled by two kids (not much strength there) in opposite directions causes enough tension to cut through solid bone and being shot point-blank in the face with a shotgun is not enough to kill someone.  Unbelievable.

But, believe it or not, this is a movie you could watch more than once just for the fun of it (maybe that is because you know it's a B movie and not a failed A-list movie).  I was interested from start to finish of the movie and considering how many issues I had with it I'm even surprised at my interest throughout the movie. I would suggest renting and not buying the movie though.",1250121600,,1821,4.459214501510574

The story follows a family that is visiting Ireland and misses their tour bus by seconds (don't bus drivers use their side mirrors). This leads to the family fighting for the next half of the movie with forced acting by all. The two sisters fight the most going so far as to dropping the C word bomb! Basically we laughed through the whole thing, especially while watching how effective a plastic hubcap can actually be used as a murder weapon (who knew????)

3788766,2,B001TCL1D8,"Taking the horror genre to Ireland for a change, I was looking forward to seeing what they had done with Plague Town. The answer was ""not much"" - aside from some effective imagery (the few scenes with the blindfold girl were well done) the film plays out like a re-hashing of any of the recent ""torture porn"" films, such as The Hills Have Eyes or Wolf Creek. The acting on some cases is bad, even by low-budget standards.
Sadly, with all that Ireland has to offer a horror film - from gorgeous lanscapes to castle settings - the producers of this film gave us just another cottage in the woods, and some people who are so hard to like, you don't care by the time they die.",1248739200,,672,4.299212598425197

This just might be the worst horror film or any film I've ever seen. The story was written by a child, the so called actors couldn't get a job doing dinner theater, the special FX were weak and low budget to say the least and the direction was non-existant!!! The only redeeming qualities of the movie, and this is by a long stretch, are the shooting locations and scenery. It was set in Ireland but was shot in Connecticut and the locations are the only saving grace in this film. At least the DP shot great scenery and captured the beauty of Ireland.

3788768,4,B001TCL1D8,"First I have to say that I wasn't bored while watching ""Plague Town"" it held my interest and had some very creepy,scary moments in it.
It was reminiscent of ""Wicked Little Things ""from the first batch of 8 films to die for.

""Plague Town"" was somewhat original but it's not like kids haven't been used many times in the past to frighten or shock audiences, a few good examples being ""The Bad Seed"",""The Good Son"" and ""Who Can Kill a Child"".

It's the brutality and shock value of using something that personifies innocence,hope and goodness that gives shock value to a film like this and others that portray children as ""monsters"".

The film used very dim lighting in places and that didn't really bother me because it lent to the dark feel of the film. There were quite a few grisly scenes but they let you see just enough to let you know what happened and just enough to let you're imagination run wild as well.

The character of Rosemary was particularly creepy and well played,her bug eyed look very disturbing.

 I would recommend it to a horror slasher fan.

Second, when walking through a field the camera shows you a prolonged shot of the back of peoples shoes in the grass. Third, lots of jumping scenes e.g. walking in the woods one moment to eating lunch in a barn the next.
(4.) Nothing new, same old stab someone with something except that the effects were so bad they kept the movie so dark you couldn't really see how bad they were. Also used darkness as the standard cheap filming scare crutch.

The movie actually starts out pretty good - the first 30 minutes are so are actually pretty great - That's what is so irritating about this movie.

You might get some enjoyment out of this disc, if you turn it off right when the ""crazy grandmother"" shows up and starts swinging for the fence in the overacting world series. That's when the whole thing falls apart.
Wait, wasn't there an actual story a few minutes ago?

On the plus side - Interesting, but ultimately pointless makeup for the ""rosemary"" character.

On the negative, pretty much everything else.
Huge plot hole dealing with the prologue setting up events 14 years ago - doesn't fit with the current age or number of the killer kids. Also, movie is chock full of stupid cliches that weren't scary when they were worn out years ago. Sudden reveals of sinister mute characters standing still behind the protagonist? Check. ""Spooky"" nursery music? Oh yeah, it's here too. Main character knocked out, waking up in a worse situation? Not once but TWICE! I was amazed when somebody got in a car and it actually started on the first attempt.

I'm guessing the filmmakers came up with the poster image and then tried to write a movie around it. At some point during the production, they probably just figured that since they had already paid for the camera rental anyways they might as well keep going..",1243641600,,1474,4.67953667953668

8341013,1,B001TCL1D8,"Amazing.......Ly bad.  This film plays out like it was directed by a 13 year old and edited by his spaztic younger brother.  The violent scenes are cut so quick and close that the action is not watchable.  The acting is of the worst caliber (special mention to the world's stupidest father, and worst actor of all time who (thankfully) suffers the most creative death-though completely impossible).  Entertaining only if you enjoy really stupid movies with really bad makeup and under the floor acting.  Did i mention i didn't care for this movie?",1348444800,,547,4.9021739130434785
8341014,1,B001TCL1D8,"Complete and utter garbage Dont waste your time or money! Says it all for me but have to use 20 words in review.

Probably the worst film with some of the most lame special effects I have ever seen I could not believe it was made so recently.

I know everyone is different but surely anyone giving this more than the one star that is the lowest possible rating must need some kind of psychiatric help...........

I watched it for free on sky and still felt I'd been ripped off!

As another reviewer pointed out it's ninety ish minutes of my life I will never get back..........

I have never felt driven to review anything before but if I can prevent even one person from wasting a portion of their life watching this drivel my own sacrifice will at least not have been in vain.",1315872000,,778,4.337931034482758
8341015,3,B001TCL1D8,"I've read the other reviews and I agree with both the good and the bad.  This is not a great film.  I doubt that it will ever be even a ""cult classic"".  However, I have seen a lot worse.  The characters are decently drawn, in that you probably dislike all of them. The story is interesting if a bit unexplained.  The acting is at the worst decent and at the best competent.  Lindsay Goranson does a good job with the stepmother and Josslyn DeCrosta is competent as the main daughter.  On the bad side, some of the effects are less than wonderful, there are sudden lapses in acting by several characters, the story line is not developed well and there is no explanation for whatever happened in the Irish village to cause this curse.  Still, all the main female characters are attractive and at least competent, the faux Irish scenery is nice and there is enough action and gore to keep most people interested.",1311897600,,909,4.5
