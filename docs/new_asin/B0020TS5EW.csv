3830525,2,B0020TS5EW,"I looked at the reviews for this movie, thought it'd be worth a shot. Terrible--I just didn't find much of anything funny. Maybe some of the themes in this movie are played out and has become dull. Only a small number of parts were funny. The chicks were hot though. Nicholas D'Agosto did a good job, I could care less about his partner. What's his name in the movie again?",1246060800,,373,4.3428571428571425
3830526,5,B0020TS5EW,"My husband and I just love this movie and actually have watched it several times. I'm 40 and he's 42 and yet we thoroughly enjoy the high school cheerleading comedy. We love it even more than Road Trip, Harold and Kumar, Bring It On and the likes. We also enjoy the soundtrack immensely. The lead characters have such a good rapport and are quite hilarious. What a great way to forget life and laugh for a while.",1245542400,4,412,4.363636363636363
3830527,4,B0020TS5EW,"2 playboy football players decide that they will go to cheerleader camp to have what Maverick in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Top-Gun-Widescreen-Special-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B0002WZTOI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Top Gun (Widescreen Special Collector's Edition)</a>&nbsp;would call a ""target rich environment"" from which to score with young babes with hot bodies.  Plus, they'd really like to skip out on 2-a-day-practices at football camp.  So, they ""join"" the all-female cheerleading squad from their school in order to punch their ticket to the cheerleader camp.

Unfortunately (not to mention predictably), the head cheerleader (Sarah Roemer) guesses their true motivations for wanting to go to cheerleader camp, and she's very distrustful of them.  Roemer is not the hottest babe in the flick, but she does have a good on-screen charisma.

The cheerleading scenes in the movie were pretty impressive, especially as they turned actors into cheerleaders, rather than the other-way-around.  While they used some stunt personnel from time-to-time, much of the cheerleading is pretty authentic.  Eric Christian Olsen & Nicholas D'Agosto are both athletic enough to pull of their roles without coming across as fakers.

There are a few holes in the plot.  First off, this is supposed to be a film about high school kids, but the whole flick had more of a college-aged feel to it.  For starters, at the beginning of the movie they have a football intra-squad scrimmage.  I don't know of any HS in the country that holds Spring football practices!  That is 100% a college thing.  If they had simply said that they went to a college instead of a HS it would've been far more believable.

The timeline is also off, even if we are to overlook the HS Spring football issue.  Ostensibly within a matter of weeks after the scrimmage is the cheerleader camp, and it's supposed to be @ the same time as football camp.  Having a cheerleader camp during the middle of the summer is plausible, but having a (team) football camp during the summer is not.  Football camp (and I'm not talking about college mini-camps for recruits here) starts in August.  Hence, that did not add up.

Of course, this is probably too much nit-picking for a movie that's meant to just plain be fun.  On the upside, this was the funniest & funnest party movie I've seen in quite some time.  It had 2 of the main characteristics I look for in party movies;  it was humorous & it left me with a good feeling when the closing credits started to roll.  If it had scored higher on the skin-o-meter (sadly, we only see one cheerleader topless) it would have been a perfect 5 stars!  In any case, if you're anything like me & you believe utopia = a universe ruled by omnipotent cheerleaders, then this flick is for YOU!",1245542400,,2823,5.11353711790393

3830529,4,B0020TS5EW,"Ok, now I know what' you're going to say. ""Another Cheerleader flick??"" Yes, but this one is different than the Bring it On's and other brain-eating films we've been subjected to throughout the years. One, it's actually funny, and two, it's from the guy's point of view. The two main characters work together beautifully, and are pretty hilarious. ""Dr."" Rick is my only major problem with this film. He simply just looks too old. All in all, this film is great for a quick laugh.",1244851200,,479,4.647058823529412
3830530,4,B0020TS5EW,"I think the best way to see this film is to know they had fun making it, producing it and to get something out of it like the commentary says: ""...they will be studying this for years to come at USC film school...""

Let's get all of the hate mail out of the way. Yes - the leads are all over 30, yes - it is another dang cheer film, yes - it has nothing new to add to the comedy plate this year, and so on. But I still got some good laughs out of it and plenty of fit people to look at. The main thing that struck me was the chemistry between the two main actors, they were actually believable and funny. The supporting cast had some great moments, especially John Michael Higgins as Coach Keith and Philip Baker Hall as Coach Byrnes - they both showed awesome chops in doing their corny roles.

The film quality was excellent, the sound was a fun 5.1 and the impressive long-takes actually looked good. Whether you love or hate this film, that one take when the crew arrives at camp showcasing the 178 ladies on the steps - was impressive. The unrated is only a few seconds longer and contains some nice (and natural) upper body nudity in the night swimming sequence.

The special features give this 2.5 star film the last 1.5. There is a 15 minute making-of, a 7 minute clip on the ""stunting"" involved, and 8 minutes of unrated outtakes - which if anything are hilarious because of those damn peacocks. The quick press junket shows Eric Olsen in meltdown mode and the commentary with the director and two leads is worth it. Even if to hear little tidbits on how the main cast got each other sick from the kissing scenes or how everything was actually filmed in LA and not in Hinsdale.

Plenty of people hate this film, but I fell into the category of liking it and laughing. I suppose it will be mandatory for the cheer fans out there, but this will actually keep the guys interested also.",1244073600,29,1891,4.303370786516854

3830604,4,B0020TS5EW,"Released to video in 2009, ""Fired Up"" is a teen dramedy about two popular high school football jocks (Eric Christian Olsen and Nicholas D'Agosto) who decide to go to cheerleading camp in the summer instead of football camp in order to score loads of babes. Their plans go awry when one falls in love with the captain of the cheerleading squad of their school (Sarah Roemer) and they both find themselves sincerely wanting to help the squad win the camp competition.

The purpose of a movie like this is to entertain and elicit laughs; the great ones avoid too much raunchiness, etc. and offer strong subtexts (like 1995's ""Clueless"" and 1982's ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High""). The good news is that ""Fired Up"" is surprisingly funny from beginning to end and it does have heartwarming elements. Despite being direct-to-video, it's obvious that a lot of thought and effort was put into the film. For it to work Olsen and D'Agosto have to work well together and they do. By the way, Olsen was 31 during filming and D'Agosto was 28, hardly high school age, and - while they do a good job of appearing high school age - their overall demeanor give 'em away. As for the females, Sarah is striking as Carly and there are quite a few curvaceous beauties, including the brunette cheerleading coach.

I would easily give ""Fired Up"" a grade of 'A-' if not for some unnecessary coarseness, implied raunch (in other words, there aren't any overtly raunchy scenes) and way too many gay-oriented jokes. These aspects remove it from the realm of greatness, as far as I'm concerned.

The movie runs 90 minutes and was shot in the Los Angeles area.

Actually, no, that's not correct, a stoned writer would have been far more imaginative.  This is the most transparent, horribly-written movie I've ever seen.  It's so bad that it's close to being a parody without actually getting there.

Only thing that saves it is the 2 lead actors; they did a good job (within the restraint of the material).  But I have never before seen a more pathetic excuse for a script.  Any teenager who's seen the American Pie series could have turned out this crappy copy.  Watching it, the movie just screams ""you liked the other teen movies (the ones that were actually original), any room for me?""

The football players become cheerleaders.  The loser boyfriend gets dumped.  They try the Fountain of Troy and fail.  And there's a lot of relationship stuff that other movies have already done 100 times.

3830653,5,B0020TS5EW,"Few films rival Goodfellas, On the Water Front, or Raging Bull...

Only one movie blows them out of the water. That movie is Fired Up!

Never before has a director captured the spirit of American film like writer and director Will Gluck does in this underrated tale of teenage angst, the dark side of American cheerleading, the consequences of dating pre-med students, and the hidden code of American cheer.

An instant classic that transcends time and space, Fired Up! is an emotionally charged whipsaw exploring the chaotic lives of high school sports stars Shawn Colfax and Nick Brady. Eric Christian Olson, who plays Brady, mesmerizes audiences with his thespian range, magically evolving into a hormone-charged teenager who questions not only his lot in life, but also the depths of his sexuality when he meets Downey.

The best supporting actor role of 2009 should have definitely been given to David Watson for his epic portrayal of Dr. Rick. This performance was so translucent that the manuerisms and monologues will most definitely be studied by students at Tisch School at NYU for generations.

I wish the universe were larger so that I could give this film infinite stars. Just thinking of the performances by Phillip Baker Hall and John Michael Higgins moves my soul in a way that no touch of another human being ever could. If you don't buy this film for yourself, then you are cheating yourself out of an experience that only sex on a chocolate waterfall with Zues himself could rival.",1355961600,7,1500,4.913043478260869

There is very little in the movie of what I call ""raunchy"" humor, and I wouldn't be averse to letting my kids watch it because the context of it is usually ""pun-ny"" or in laughable taste.  You can enjoy this movie as a family, as the adults and the kids will both find things to laugh about; the situations and the lines display elements of both slapstick and intellectual comedy!

3830665,4,B0020TS5EW,"Fired Up is honestly just another typical teen comedy movie despite what the storyline might suggest.  Two teenage boys go to a cheerleader college... to become cheerleaders themselves!

Yes, their ultimate goal is to actually spy on the cheerleaders because their obsession with girls is a bit stronger than most, to say the least!  Ah, to be a teenager again.

Anyway, once they get to the college, there's one (or perhaps two) girls in particular that the boys have a serious crush on, and these girls take up a huge portion of the storyline.

Now while the actual laughs are few and far between (because to be perfectly honest, most of the jokes featured in this movie have been done a thousand different times by this point) I can't help but crack a smile every once in a while.

Perhaps I'm simply won over by the pacing of the storyline- it's always moving fast and never really lets up at all, allowing all the missed jokes to simply sneak by harmlessly.  The writers did a smart thing there.

Well, it's a typical teenage movie.  Boy meets girl, girl falls in love with boy, boy and girl eventually get into a fight, etc, etc.  You KNOW what to expect.  There's definitely nothing radically different about this film that others haven't already covered.  Whether this movie succeeds or not is simply a matter of personal preference, I guess.

For what it is, it's a decent way to waste some time.  Plus there *are* a few actual laughs such as when the two teenage boys use cheerleader moves to reach higher areas (by one of the friends standing on top of the other ones shoulders).  Some the boys roommates are funny too.  Decent enough for a rental.",1278892800,,1659,4.591836734693878

If, however, you're in the market for an endearingly mindless, good-natured sex romp, then you could do a whole lot worse than this low-budget teen-movie parody, written by Freedom Jones and directed by Will Gluck and featuring a cast of high-spirited youngsters who make up for in energy what they lack in marquee-name value.

Nicholas D'Agosto and Eric Christian Olsen play two high school football jocks who are clearly more concerned with scoring off the field than on.  To that end, they sign up for a cheerleader camp where they'll have all the hot young babes they could possibly want just for the asking.  Before you know it, however, along with perfecting their lifts and splits, the two horny lads have discovered a sensitive, caring side to their personalities that they never knew existed before.

There isn't much to be said about ""Fired Up!"" except that it manages to be racy without being raunchy, inane without being flat-out stupid.  Indeed, in the final analysis, it's the open-hearted innocence and lack of smarm that make this one enjoyable.",1260057600,,1288,4.912442396313364

After scoring chicks all year long, Nick (Olsen) & Shawn (D' Agosto) decide to skip football camp for the summer to join their high school cheerleaders for 3 wonderful weeks at cheerleading camp in order to score with more chicks. Once they arrive at camp, both guys are able to score with the majority of the girls there until Shawn eventually falls for the head cheerleader, Carly (Sarah Roemer).

While Shawn is trying to win the affection of Carly's from her undeserving current boyfriend, Rick (David Walton), Nick is trying his hardest to score with the head cheerleading coach Diora. During all this mess, the cheerleading team is trying to figure out how not to come in last place again. They soon figure out the only way to not come in last place anymore is to pull off the most difficult cheer move ever, ""The Fountain Of Troy"".

After the 3 weeks come to an end, Nick is ready to leave camp and go home but Shawn rather stay because he really wants to win not only the cheer competition but also Carly's love. Being the great friend he his, Nick decides to stay with Shawn at the camp.

As the movie comes to a close, Shawn gets the girl and the team is able to pull off ""The Fountain Of Troy"" which prohibits the them from coming in last place again (19th to be exact). Also, Nick is able to hook up with Diora so in the end everyone is happy.

needless to say i loved it. funny, yes. predictable, yes. has a happy ending where they get their girls, yes. it was a well rounded funny movie. the one liners and combacks that the writers have in this had me laughing alot during the whole movie.
