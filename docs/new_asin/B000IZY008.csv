8148205,2,B000IZY008,"not that much information I found in this DVD, you can find more free movie about ski tune up on youtub.",1358380800,,104,4.0
8148206,1,B000IZY008,This DVD is terrible.  The section on sharpening is only 3 minutes long and waxing is 4 minutes.  It doesn't give much info.  You're better off finding videos on YouTube.,1331078400,,170,4.6
8148207,2,B000IZY008,For the price I was disappointed with the dvd. It is too short. Just shot in some store . Did not answer too many of my tuning questions. Good for really basic basic tuning.,1238025600,,173,4.117647058823529
8148208,1,B000IZY008,"Imagine buying skiis/snowboards and asking what you might do to keeo them in shape. Then imagine a brief conversation in the back room of a ski shop...sort of a ""well, dude this is what I do..."" that's all this video provides. The Tuning kit hasn't arrived yet, one can only hope that ""it"" is worth $19.",1171584000,3,303,4.428571428571429
