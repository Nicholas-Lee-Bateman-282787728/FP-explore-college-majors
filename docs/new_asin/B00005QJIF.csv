1648526,4,B00005QJIF,"Man, what a trip! Usually, if a movie tries really hard to be campy and funny, it fails miserably. This one hits it just right. Hilarious, fast-paced, great-looking, and creative. Love those flourescent nun zombies!",1008288000,3,215,5.171428571428572
1648527,1,B00005QJIF,"I was really excited about this movie and had heard about it for a long time, it just didn't have an American distributer. Well, I finally seen it and I must say I'm a little disappointed.
The concept of demon nuns and lots of gore sounds pretty cool.  But why must all new horror movies have to be funny? Why must all new horror movies have to have ""in-jokes""? Why must all new horror films have to look like Marilyn Manson videos?(You know, with the zombies/demons/ghosts doing that twitching thing)
As for the gore, why is it neon colors? And what's with all the black light stuff? While I must admit the wanna be goths in the movie are absolutely hysterical because it's so true, I wanna see a good gory, straight frightfest from an American film. It reminds me of Dead Hate the Living meets the remake of House on Haunted Hill(and that's not a good thing because both films did the Marilyn Manson video/in joke thing which is becoming tiring.
In short, yeah it has funny parts, yeah there's some gore(with neon blood), but if you wanna see some *** kicking gory zombie movies, America isn't making them. Not even the Italians are making them any more. Japan is doing the genre with some real awesome fresh movies in the likes of Junk, Wild Zero, and Versus.  Look for them because other than Romero and the Evil Dead series, America is useless when it comes to zombies/demons and gore.",1008115200,4,1390,4.53386454183267

Let us not forget THE DOG who acting skills can be compared to: HOUCH (TURNER AND HOUCH 1989), JERRY LEE (K-9 1989), AND CUJO (CUJO 1983). The college kids did what college kids do ""SOMETHING STUPID"". They went to a ""Deserted Convent"". Those two words alone should have made them rethink the plans. The goth chick was cool (why? why?

Here's what I tell my friends about it: (spoilers. Maybe?)
The first thing you see is a woman carrying a bottle of liquor, a sawed off shotgun, and a can of gasoline. She swigs from the bottle, tosses it. Approaches a building- a convent. Starts pouring gasoline everywhere. Flicks her cigarette- flames. Enters the building. Begins picking off flaming nuns with her shotgun.

The stereotyped characters, the plot, and the dialogue are all perfect in their mockery without sacrificing the movie. This is a flawless laugh fest of a horror flick. Mike Mendez is awesome.

1648544,4,B00005QJIF,"I understand that we all have different opinions, and that's actually a good thing. If we all liked the same things, the world would be a very dull place indeed. But several people who have given this film a one-star review don't seem to understand that it's a spoof. It's SUPPOSED to be comical. The gay jokes are not offensive whatsoever (they're done in a satirical fashion), as well as the anti-religious content and the racial jokes. This is a SATIRE, folks. ""South Park"" and ""Family Guy"" are edgier and more ""offensive"" than this. It's supposed to be a horror comedy. That's why the demons look and move the way they do and that's why the characters are caricatures of your typical ""old dark house horror film"" kids.

The movie is bad overall. It's cheesy,but the bad cheese. The film starts out good maybe 30 minutes into the film,but goes down slowly.
The acting is overall bad, the casting for some parts is stupid, and even though I love cheesy scenes. Some of these cheesy scenes weren't good.
Now, I can't complain because a friend gave this movie to me for free after he thought it was terrible and so I knew what I was getting into. If you want to watch it then I recommend renting it first.

1648546,4,B00005QJIF,"This movie has the perfect balance of horror movie cliches and being able to laugh at itself. The characters are bad caricatures and stereotypes--the goth pretentious throng, the jock and cheerleader, the stoner, etc--and the plot is laughable. The Convent is great in that it's so terrible, and it is a great film for watching in a group setting, such as at parties.",1274313600,,367,4.841269841269841
1648547,4,B00005QJIF,"THE CONVENT may be the most fun I have had with a low-budget Indie Horror film since PLAGA ZOMBIE. It combines elements of CHILDREN SHOULDNT PLAY WITH DEAD THINGS and the classic 80s demon flicks DEMONS and NIGHT OF THE DEMONS in a crazy, gory throwback flick that is sure to please any genre fan! A group of college co-eds head to a haunted convent to screw around, when their drunken debaucheries unleash the evil spirits of the devil-worshiping nuns that were killed by one of their students decades earlier. Director Mike Mendez uses simple make-up appliances and creative use of neon paint with black lighting to bring the demons to life, and though the FX work and techniques are clearly visible, they are equally effective. Though each of the characters are pure stereotypes, they function perfectly in the film since it is entirely self-aware and played up. There is also an excellent balance of horror and comedy that genuinely had me laughing the entire film. The film is also set to a booming electric score that energizes the action sequences and gives the film a much larger feel. If all that wasn't enough, the gore is absolutely over the top and absurdly awesome, with countless decapitations, head explosions, face-ripping, and gut-munching. 100% enjoyable from start to finish, a highly recommended and grossly underrated gorefest!

1648550,2,B00005QJIF,"The Convent (Mike Mendez, 2000)

I really should check these things out before I decide to watch them. Mendez was responsible, six years after this, for the execrable After Dark movie The Gravedancers. And what a surprise, he resurrected a lot of the cast from his earlier, even stupider movie, The Convent, for that one. Had I known this before I decided to try watching this dog, I would probably have not felt like I just killed, tortuously, the last seventy-nine minutes of my existence. At least The Convent does have a bit of humor, but it's not nearly enough to save this.

The story: the opening scene shows us a young woman walking into a convent, pulling out weaponry, and going to town. We skip to forty years later, and one of those hoary old horror film clichs--the college students breaking into the haunted building to do some partying. All is your typical brand of creepy until one of the partiers, Mo (Megahn Perry, one of many here who came back for The Gravedancers), runs across a band of amateur Satanists (led by the counter guy at the local Dairy Queen, no less; he provides most of the film's laughs) who are looking for a human sacrifice to initiate a new member. Of course, the ghosts are perfectly happy with a human sacrifice as well, and everything kinda blows up from there...

I am convinced, as I was when watching The Gravedancers, that somewhere within Mike Mendez there's a decent filmmaker straining to get out. There were so many places where this movie had potential and failed to live up to it (though it does succeed more than The Gravedancers managed to). A lot of this has to do with Chaton Anderson's script, which never does manage to do anything remotely unpredictable. The actors, for what it's worth, do the best they can with the material they're given, and some of them manage to do something close to shine here, if you take into account the material they're working with. (Again, I hasten to remind the reader that I'm comparing this to The Gravedancers rather than any other horror film I've seen this week.) Mendez looks sometimes like he's going to do something fun, but ultimately sticks with convention from start to finish. This could have been a much, much better film than it ended up being, but, as Mendez' more recent effort shows us, this could have been a whole lot worse as well. * ",1233964800,,2346,4.618705035971223
1648551,4,B00005QJIF,"A group of wacky college kids decide to explore a local condemned convent building. It just so happens that, according to legend, a massacre occured in this very convent 40 years earlier. Our zany bunch of scholars simply must enter these accursed halls so they can party more effectively. Well, a group of rather un-sinister satanists are already inside, looking for a virgin to sacrifice to their dark lord. Uh-oh! Real demons emerge to spoil everyone's good time! The rest of the evening is spent trying to stay alive. Much blood and goo is sprayed. Enter Christine (Adrienne Barbeau!!!!), who is the same gal that slaughtered a sanctuary full of nuns and a priest on that fateful day in 1960! She is one tough babe, complete w/ motorcycle, a machete, and a huge cache of guns! Together w/ the sole surviving coed, Christine chops off many demonized heads and fires innumerable bullets. Her prayer near the film's explosive climax is what I want chiseled on my headstone! It's my favorite part of the movie. If a splendiforous gore-tacular w/ a goofy sense of humor sounds tasty to you, then THE CONVENT will fill your meat-wagon. Ms. Barbeau is still mighty fine... P.S.- Coolio is hilarious in his small role as a cop...",1221091200,,1225,4.783018867924528
1648552,1,B00005QJIF,You ever hear of a bad movie that people say is so stupid it is good? Well... THIS IS ONE OF THEM.,1200528000,,98,3.5
1648553,4,B00005QJIF,"A group of college students (cheerleader, goth, stoner, jock, virgin) decide to visit the old convent that was shut down due to a nasty incident that occurred. The goth chick, Mo, is captured by wannabe devil worshipers and they unwittingly unleash demons. As demons take over the bodies of nice girl Clorissa's boyfriend and friends, only Adult Christine (played awesomely well by Adrienne Barbeau) can stop them.

The opening scene sums up what is to follow. A beautiful babe in a school girl outfit and leather jacket with a cigarette hanging out of her mouth slaughters nuns and priests with a baseball bat, shotgun, and matches while ""You Don't Own Me"" plays. If you like this sequence, you will like the rest. Nuttiness ensues involving drugs, virgin sacrifices, forced abortions, gay Satanists, ditzy cheerleaders, and a pugnacious pug. Oh, and Coolio and Bill Moseley make appearances as no-good coppers.

It should be noted that this is one of the earlier works from The Gravedancers director, Mike Mendez and won the Audience Award at Fantafestival.

I have to say that my favorite scene (other than the opening) was set to the song ""Dreamweaver"" where stoner Biff gets high off shrooms and weed, hears Jesus talking to him, and tries unsuccessfully to mate with a demon.

There were incredibly likable characters you watched run around. Goth chick Mo (also in The Gravedancers) is adorable, Stoner dude Biff was hilarious, and Young/ Adult Christine oozed coolness. Unfortunately, none of these great characters get more than a half hour screen time. Instead, we are stuck with the good girl Clorissa.

As for the religious undertones, or in this case, way overtones, it is not preachy or sacrilegious. Mendez comes across as showing what is scary about the idea of having to conform within the confines of a convent.

I saw that the SFX received bad comments in other reviews, but I felt was okay overall. The make-up was a tad silly in some parts like glow in the dark veins and neon blood. However, the prosthetics used to raise the demons foreheads looked realistic and the ""blood shower"" scene was cool. The ""Antichrist birth"" scene was especially good considering this was low budget and it was only on screen for about one minute.

Favorite Quote: Satanist asks, ""Are you the spawn of the Devil?"" Nerd replies, ""No, I'm a Lambda.""... Or when Clorissa says, ""My brother's going to be the next Antichrist? Mom's gonna be pi*ssed."" DVD Extras: Audio Options (inc. Spanish Subtitles), Commentary, Behind the Scenes, 1 Deleted short Scene, and ""Gore on Demand"" which showed the death scenes up close and in slow motion.

Bottom Line: A very goofy, fun film with lots of gore. Reminiscent of Night of the Demons or The Evil Dead.

Rating: 7/10

1648554,5,B00005QJIF,"I wasn't sure what to expect with this one but the plot sounded interesting and anything with Adrienne Barbeau is worth the price of admission.

  Some of the acting is rough and the plot is on the skimpy side but once you get into the movie, who cares!  This was a hoot and a half.  Interesting effects and characters and of course upon the first glimpse of Ms. Barbeau as Christine, you feel like you're seeing a familiar friend.

  This is a fun romp that gives you a taste of horror, comedy, drama, and is good old fashion popcorn movie.  I'd like to thank the writers, producers and actors for making a quiet evening at home much more interesting.

  I recently met Ms. Barbeau before seeing this movie and when I mentioned it she told me I'd enjoy it and she was on target.  (I also must mention that it was a dream come true to meet this acting Icon and she was an absolute delight!!!).

  If you want a great movie with a dash of everything this is the one for you.  And you had to see the ending coming a mile off!!!  (Wink, wink, nudge)",1157328000,4,1046,4.223350253807107

I think some people who  gave this bad reviews missed the point that it doesn't try to be a horror movie, but a spoof of the slasher/ demon movie genre.

All the characters are appealing in thier own way. I could have watched the Goth girl more...she was too funny! And the sight gags...like a possesed nun throwing up on a student...it sounds gross, but to see how they filmed it, it wasn't. It looked like they threw green PlayDough on the student.

1648557,3,B00005QJIF,"I'd give it 3 stars.

I was looking for a decent 'bunch of sexy young people head off to a secluded place and get slaughtered' flic last night and thought i'd try this one.

I loved Adrienne Barbeau since Swamp Thing so when i saw her name on the box it was decided.

The opening was good as others have said but i was kind of disappointed that they dumped the horror potential of the dead nuns and went straight to the schlocky demons so soon.

Anyways the cast was fresh and worked together well which is half the battle in these movies.

Some things made me laugh out loud like the flashback to her days in the convent 40 yrs ago when the nuns became demons and punished the students with paddles.

There were other little moments of great dialogue in the movie like the scene between the 2 virgins that are tied up together at the end.

Adrienne was ok but could've been a little more over the top .

Convent shouldn't be decribed as being in the same league as my sacred Evil Dead 2 but it's not bad at all.",1113091200,,1012,4.180412371134021

Adrianne Barbeau may tempt you into thinking that this will be a serious movie, and she certainly whoops some zombie behind, but this movie is about making well-educated fun of stereotypes.  Plus, the special features are better on this DVD than any other movie's;  they include slow-motion blue-screen shots of exploding heads and in-character commentary from the Prince of Darkness and his faye minion!!!

At this very moment, I am buying it for the second time!",1109289600,,585,4.81
1648559,2,B00005QJIF,"Wow.  I would have given this flick 0 stars, but the opening scene is so incredibly cool I was compelled to give it 2 stars.  It opens with a girl calmly walking into a mass, then bludgening, shooting and burning everyone within to death.  Awesome!

Then we skip to the present day.  The cast of characters is a bunch of jackass frat/sorority kids, including the dork who will never get laid, and the kissass pledge.  We also have a goth chick and her former goth-chick turned sorority girl friend.

They go into the convent, but leave when the campus cops call them out.  all except the goth chick, who has a police record and bribes loser buy into keeping her presence silent by giving him her panties (cue 16 candles jokes).  She gets knocked out and later wakes up tied to a pentagram, about to be sacrificed by a bunch of loser satanists.  Meanhwile, outside, one campus cop, played by Coolio, is a psycho.  Get this, a girl, covered in blood, runs screaming towards him yelling ""help me officer, they're being killed"".  What does he do?  He PULLS HIS GUN ON HER and yells ""stay back creature of the night!"".  What?

Then, later on, we are told that the girl who killed all the nuns actually did it to drive away the demons that had taken over the convent.  Get this, the nuns all turned into demons, and started writing ""Hail Satan"" on the blackboard, and NO ONE notices and keeps their kids home.  OOOOoh, that sounds good.  Gee, didn't the nasty, glow in the sark faces and fangs at least make people think maybe there was a problem?  Oh, I forgot about the dumbass satanist wannabes who summon up the evil.  They are lead by a wimp with a highpitched voice.  His followers say wonderful things like ""Am I worthy, master? And, I would die for you, son of Satan"".  Luckily, he gets stabbed in the eye and dies.  I would go on, but I think you get the point.

1648561,2,B00005QJIF,"You know, it was really hard for me to dislike this movie, because I really wanted to like it. I first heard of it having trouble finding a distributor a few years ago, and heard it was outrageous, wild, gory, stylish - and so much more. I thought I was in for something new, but after a rousing start (nice, nice), the film becomes stunningly mediocre. Cardboard characters that have been in every teen fright flick since the late 70's populate the picture, and even the one character who should be original - the goth girl (who is absolutely beautiful) - is basically Angela from the Night of the Demons series. In fact, the echoes of NOTDs are everywhere from the makeup to the gore (yes, NOTDs 2 even had decapitated nuns).
At a trim 81 minutes, you'd expect the sensational subject matter to pack a wallop, but outside of the opening and a neat flashback sequence, its all really rather contrived. At times, it seems the filmmakers were trying overly hard to be un-pc, and it does feel a bit juvenile. With such a short running time, there should be no pointless scenes, but instead of wall to wall carnage, we get a couple of scenes in a diner, some inane chatter amongst the teens to establish 'character', and a really cheesy ending.
It does have its moments, some good gore, a bit of stylish photography. Pitty more wasn't done with the effort.",1073088000,,1353,4.549180327868853

Oh hunny, buy this flick, it shant disappoint you.
If nothing more this movie is worth its price for the witty one liners and unique special effects.  Such as ""I'm a virgin, I'm saving myself for Marilyn Manson."" and ""My brothers going to be the antichrist?  My mom's gonna be piss!""

The producers had fun with the script by adding all the ingredients that make a good horror film entertaining to watch.",1050019200,,395,4.430555555555555
1648565,4,B00005QJIF,"Mike Mendez has definately got it going for him.  First Real Killers one of the best twisted horror flicks ever and now Convent...you can't ask for anything more twisted and trippy than his work.  it's different it's interesting it's humorous its fantastic art.  convent is awesome the whole neon color thing, the crazy noises and everything that happens in the movie is awesome.  I totally recommend this to people who know good horror....no one else makes 'em like this anymore!",1041724800,,480,4.9625
1648566,3,B00005QJIF,"Now you have to give this movie some credit. There's nothing that stands out in the acting. The characters are stereotypical and, if you ask me, redundant. What stood out to me was the effects. First of all, the fight scenes were rather entertaining. For all you knew, you were watching a John Woo shootout (okay, maybe not John Woo). I'm not one for comparing movies to see how they portray possessed people. But you really gotta give these guys props for their effects and portrayal. It wasn't the typical Linda Blair. It was more like a special effects upgrade to the usual demonic possession.
 So if you watch movies just for effects, you'll probably get a kick out of this. The r-rating is for sexuality (no nudity), language and graphic violence. Don't take it seriously. Just enjoy it for what it offers.",1035244800,11,811,4.671328671328672
1648567,4,B00005QJIF,"This movie is everything the people who keep giving it bad reviews say it is. Its cheesey-stereo typical charactors. Its horrible acting. What these people are missing is, thats what made 80's horror such a great thing. It didn't matter if the cast were all your bestfriends. As long as you could keep people entertained it was a good horror flick. I was almost comforted by this movie. Reminded me of how much I enjoyed old Horror ""B"" movies. I laughed til I cried in parts and I jumped in parts and for a small film like this thats impressive. Lots of this movie reminded me of Evil Dead and a line ""You mean my brother's going to be the antichrist....mom's going to be pissed"" that brought back Lost Boys memories. Its definatly worth watching it'll keep you entertained the whole way through.",1032825600,,796,4.573426573426573
1648568,3,B00005QJIF,"It is 1960.  A red car stops before a church, and a girl wearing sunglasses gets out.  Background music, Lesley Gore's hit song, ""You Don't Own Me.""  And she takes out a shotgun, kills all the nuns there, and torches the place.  Ugh.
40 years later, as you expect, a group of college students breaks into this now deserted convent for fun.  And you know what happens next, with demon worshippers and massive attack of zombies.  ""The Convent"" is, in fact, a knowingly cheezy B-horror film that is meant for fun, fun like sitting back and drinking beer.  So, there's no point in saying that the story is hackneyed, the characters are caricatures -- a cheerleader, a Goth girl, etc.  If you're in good mood, you may enjoy the film's sheer stupidity.  If you're not, just stay away.
For film fans who loves to have any knowledge, trivial or not, the following might be useful.  Coolio appears as a crazy cop, but, remember, his part is just a cameo.  And another special appearance is by Adrienne Barbeau, who is cool clad in black lether jacket, chopping off the zombies' heads.  And Ms. Barbeau's character, an adult released from 40 years' hietus after murdering those nuns (she got some reason, she says), is named ""Christine"" ... the director's obvious homage to one Carpenter film of the same title, and his ""Escape from N.Y."" in which she also appeared.  (And as you know, she is ex-Mrs. Carpenter.)  Brief as it is, her screen presense gives a good stimulant to this film.
As to the film itself, the scare is scarcely found, but sometimes it certainly is funny.  The special make-up is very good, and gives precious power to the entire film that tends to sag sometimes.  This is for those who likes the types of films like ""Creepshow"" and ""The Evil Dead.""  But Sam Raimi's outrageous energy somehow lacks here.",1020816000,5,1814,4.654088050314465
1648569,1,B00005QJIF,"This movie was bad, but I'm wondering if it was even supposed to be good. It was funny at times (ie one night stand with Joey Ramone, that made me scoff) and I was exepecting a very terrible ""film"", but not this bad, worse than I thought. So I have come to the conclusion that it must really be a comedy. In which case it is amusing, minus the homophobia. There are some funny targets here, cheezy wimpy satan worshipers, dumb sorority and frat boys, psuedo goths, sex crazed misogynists (come on now, if you've been to high school you know the earlier mentioned, if you've been to college you know all the rest.)So for that factor, I scoffed here and there.  And really, I'm only reviewing it because someone gave it 5 stars. Where is their brain at? Obviously not in thier head.",1017619200,,780,4.416666666666667
1648570,3,B00005QJIF,"This movie is a horror/comedy mix that sometimes works and sometimes doesn't.  The humor at times is hilarious (at one point the main character says ""You mean my brother could become the antichrist? My mom's gonna be PISSED!"") and sometimes it's just annoying.
Adrienne Barbeau is awesome as the nun-killing ""psycho""...she reminded me of an exaggerated Sigourney Weaver from the alien movies...she is the reason this movie somewhat succeeds.  Other than that, the gore factor is pretty high (lots of blood, head-chopping, etc.).  The main low-point of this movie is the bad acting of ALL the main character teens except the main girl.  Some of their humorous lines would be a lot funnier if they knew how to deliver them.
But, if you can look past the bad acting (and the pointless and confusing cameo of Coolio as a pot-smoking cop), this movie does have some redeeming qualities.
The DVD has not much to offer except widescreen and a very short, pointless deleted scene.  This isn't a movie for everyone, but it would probably be fun with a group of friends.  Recommended.",1014508800,,1074,4.873626373626373

It was hilarious because it was sooo STUPID! Geez, where is horror going these days?! Was the director trying something new with the whole black light effect and the weird moving demons??!! This movie had a lot of funny lines and the goth girl was an excellent actress, she would be hilarious in a comedy, why she picked this stupid movie to be in I have no idea?! RENT, don't BUY this movie. You have to see it to believe how stupid it is!! P.S.

1648573,1,B00005QJIF,"I'm serious -- don't be fooled by the other reviews here that give this movie five stars (FIVE stars?!?!?! Inconceivable!) No, do not be fooled -- this movie sucks. It starts off okay, and it even builds to some modicum of suspense, but once people start turning into demons, this turkey becomes a hyper-active, ultraviolent, shoot-em-up, Tarrantino wannabe and takes a nosedive straight into the ground.  And all that jiggy camera work with the demons?---bad idea.  It comes across as a superficial MTV-style music video (and a lousy one at that).
It was depressing to see Adrienne Barbeau cussing and sneering through the last thirty minutes of this crud.  Not that she's one of our best actresses, but, still, couldn't she have just gotten a job at Taco Bell if she needed the money?  And Coolio--well, he just kinda mugs his way through his disposable scenes.  Unnecessary and unfunny.
Please, trust me. Don't waste your time. Avoid this mess. I want the 90 minutes of my life I spent watching this pile of junk back.",1011225600,,1021,4.811428571428571
1648574,1,B00005QJIF,"Whatever drives you away from ""The Convent"" -- the low-end ""special effects,"" the horrible acting, or more troubling factors  (the homophobic gay subplot), avoid this horrific piece of schlock at all costs.
Certainly underdeveloped plots and characters are not unique in B-grade movies.  In fact, there's something endearing about it that turns these films into the ""cult favorites"" mentioned in another review on this site.
However, hesitate to even consider this film ""B-Grade.""  Are there ""C"" and ""D-Class"" horror films?  Apparently so.  The characters in ""The Convent"" are such stereotype, so one-dimensional, they disappear if they turn sideways.  The ghoul-affects of ""vibrating"" looks like a shaky-handed cameraman is at work.
Poor Adrienne Barbeau.  And Coolio . . . This is no ""Gangsta's Paradise.""  By the final ""plot twist"", you'll find yourself praying that these actors never fall to this level again . . . and praying for absolutely NO SEQUAL!",1010966400,,957,5.333333333333333
1648575,4,B00005QJIF,"The Covent has been called on of the year's best independent horror films and deservedly so. This has one of the best openings for a horror film ever. A car pulls up in front of a boarding school and out walks Christine armed with a baseball bat,a shotgun,and a can of gasoline. Upon entering,she opens up a can of whoopass on a group of nuns and a priest with the bat before blowing them away with the shotgun.(Pretty damn cool,huh?)
  The rest of the film is fantastic with a great cast including rapper Coolio and Bill Mosely(better known as Choptop from Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2)as 2 crooked cops. It also features Adrieanne Barbeu who played one of the most annoying characters ever in Creepshow. This movie also features the gorgeous Chanton Anderson. The Convent also has gore galore including plenty of decapatations,eyes gouged out,faces being ripped off,and heads being smashed. However,this film is not without its flaws. Some of the scenes don't make sense like when the female lead runs up to a cop screaming for help and covered in blood. What does the cop do?He shoots at her. What the hell?I thought policemen are supposed to help people not shoot at them. Then there's the oral sex scene which,in my opinion,could have been more grapic and violent. I'm assuming it wasn't more graphic because of those bastards at the MPAA(may they all burn in hell).And finally,this movie could have used a lot more T&A.With all the cast members,you'd think there would be more sex. About the only T&A scene is the bloody shower scene with Chanton Anderson. How she keeps those big beautiful melons of hers in that top,I may never know. The only reason I'm giving this movie 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the lack of T&A.Still,this movie is well worth the price. I'll never grow tired of watching this movie.",1010966400,3,1815,4.7405063291139244

Adrienne Barbeau must be hard up for acting parts or they paid her a lot.  As for the rest of this cast you won't see them again except maybe in the unemployment line.
