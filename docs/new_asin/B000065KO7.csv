7961024,5,B000065KO7,"I wish there were more episodes in the series!  The story lines keep the imagination and innocence of children.... not to mention, teaching the respect of parents/authority, having the diversity of friends and tenderness to take care of animals. Great animation and bright colors to keep toddlers (or older children) interested.",1389052800,,328,5.431372549019608
