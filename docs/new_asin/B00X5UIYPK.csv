7158719,4,B00X5UIYPK,"I love 2 Broke Girls. It's my current favorite sitcom because it's a show that you can watch and you know they'll be guaranteed laughs, always. The show stays consistent through all the season, with great performance by the two leads Kat Dennings and Beth Behrs, we still get pop culture jokes, sexual jokes, and good situations for our ""2 Broke Girls"".
But this season the show seems to struggle story-wise, because the first half of the season the characters stay focused on the cupcake business while they get involved in crazy situations, but by the last few episodes, the focus changes a LOT, and it gets lost and characters like Oleg or Sophie, or ""The High"" storyline outshine Caroline and Max's cupcake venture. The show was still funny during the whole season, but some of the last episodes were to watch and forget, my reason to give it four stars.
I still love the show and I hope it bounces back in season 5! ""2 Broke Girls"" is a delightful sitcom that delivers laughs and great performances.",1432857600,4,1004,4.646067415730337

Actually, let me rephrase that question: are there seriously that many people on life support watching tv because you'd have to be hooked up to a ventilator to find this even remotely funny. It's crude, it's hackneyed, there is zero comedic timing, and I'm trying to understand how it made it to season four. Seinfeld this is not.",1439942400,2,440,4.7272727272727275

7158817,3,B00X5UIYPK,"I have watched this show since season 1 and have the first three seasons on Blu-ray and dvd. Unfortunately, all the sidetracking in season 4 ruined it for me. All of a sudden it is the Sophie and Oleg show, leaving little room to further the storyline of Max and Caroline's dream of owning their cupcake shop. Even the little shop they have in back of the diner was put on the back-burner. It is not till towards the end of the season when the girls realize they already have their own dream and that is you guessed it. In my opinion, Season 4 has lost the magic from the first two seasons. Sure, the season's still funny, but let's stay focus.",1439164800,3,644,4.286885245901639
