6481583,5,B00LEW3IPC,"Ok. So there are two different Andy Williams Christmas DVDs on Amazon. My mom loves Andy Williams so we have both. This is the difference.
If he has WHITE sweater on the cover, it is the disc from PBS,  where it is all the old footage from his Christmas specials.
If he has a YELLOW sweater on the cover, it is clips from his old show, and his live Branson Christmas show from the late 80s/early 90s.",1512172800,11,400,4.194805194805195
