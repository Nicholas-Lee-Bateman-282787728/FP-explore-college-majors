8282234,4,B001B8E3TO,"This is a taut small-screen psycho-drama about the heartbreak and loneliness
of a middle-aged lace curtain twitcher. Set in small-town suburban England, our heroine
sets out to make her ideal man notice her.

 Along the way, we are presented with apt questions about the nature of desire
and the difference between getting what we want and that most obstinate aspect of daily
reality - where we end up NOT wanting what we get. There is plenty of humour and pathos
in this movie, where the smallest aspects of the life of a suburban housewife are drawn
in intricate detail. The movie revolves around the monomania of the heroine, and the
camera angles and sound fully capture this in all its claustrophobic detail.

 The music is inobtrusive and effective throughout, quietly moving the plot
along while counterpointing the dramatic tension (with the exception of the forgettable
song which plays during the closing credits - nobody watches these, so perhaps moot).
In fact, the music - along with the stunning performance of Paola Wigmore in the title
role - is perhaps the strongest part of this soon-to-be cult classic. Also memorable
is Ali Chadwick as Carol, her closest friend and neighbour. Carol, or 'er across the road,
is her 'frenemy' (best friend / enemy), who she both spies upon and despises. Despite the
cattiness of their exchanges, Carol does seem to be an actual friend rather than just an
acquaintance, but perhaps her behaviour indicates otherwise.

 This is a chick-flick from beginning to end; there are no car chases, explosions,
violence or nudity. There are one or two adult scenes, so this is not for children, but
fairly tame otherwise. It needs to be watched with a woman present to both appreciate
the humour and irony - as well as to explain the darker aspects of the female psyche. As
a man, I found there was a huge squirm/cringe factor, plus the rewind button on the remote
got a good work-out as the finer details of the facial expressions and dialogue are easily
missed. This isn't a Hollywood opus, so the plot points are not telegraphed or explained.

 Even so, both my [female] friend and I enjoyed this movie hugely, as well as the
many talking points. Here's a single line of dialogue:

 Cristine [to camera]: Why do we work so hard to impress people we hate?

 There are some memorable scenes, including some nice footage of the many canals
that still transect England. Plus there are plenty of false leads and red herrings, so that
we were kept on tenterhooks until the final denouement.

 I think subtitles are an option, but completely unnecessary.

 Recommended to anyone who doesn't mind movies that make you think. You may wish to
watch this more than once, there is plenty here, in fact probably too much for one viewing.",1280275200,,2768,4.80801687763713
