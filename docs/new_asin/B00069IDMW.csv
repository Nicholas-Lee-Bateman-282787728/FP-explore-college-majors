Although the description lists the episodes included, there are a few bonus ones added ""into"" the others as well.  Includes the intro of live action mixed with cartoon as Chip & Dale sing and dance with record player to kick off the show, then appear for shorts between a couple of the cartoons.

1. Two Chips & a Miss
2. Farmyard Symphony.....3. Chicken in the Rough.....4. Donald's Applecore (all go into each other, no credits or shorts between)
5. Chips Ahoy......6. Up a Tree (go into each other)
7. Lone Chipmunks

8040611,5,B00069IDMW,"I just visited my family for Christmas and found this VHS at their house that my siblings and I watched growing up.  Not only did we watch it over and over again as children, but when I showed it to my nieces who are 2 and 5, they wanted to watch it again and again.  This is very impressive for such an old cartoon when the cartoons nowadays are so different from that.  The music in this video is very well-done, probably contributing to kids wanting to see it again and again.",1325376000,,479,4.184782608695652
8040612,5,B00069IDMW,This was a VHS that my children watched all the time.  I have been wanting to show it to the grandchildren but my tape was bad so finding one in good condition to use was exciting.  Thanks.,1292371200,2,189,4.081081081081081
8040613,5,B00069IDMW,"The fact that The Adventures of Chip n' Dale has no ratings or no reviews on Amazon saddens me.  This is not an anthology special that should fade into obscurity.  Cut in 1959, the show includes new ""animated on real life"" skits to open and close the included classic Chip n' Dale cartoons.  Chip and Dale fill in for the role that Walt Disney would traditionally take in introducing the cartoons.  The selection of cartoons was excellent, including:

Two Chips and a Miss (1952)
Chicken in the Rough (1951)
Donald Applecore  (1952)
Up a Tree  (1955)
Chips Ahoy  (1956)
The Lone Chipmunks  (1954)

The clever cutting techniques and the inclusion of some segments from other shorts created the illusion that much of the show was one continuous story.  This works especially well with Chicken in the Rough and Donald Applecore which are similary thematically.  The animation was very lush and vibrant, and while it pales in comparison to the phenominal DVD transfers we have today, the cartoon still looked very good.

Considering the original segments as well as the presence of a few cartoons (Donald Applecore and The Lone Chipmunks) which have yet to appear on a Disney DVD, this tape would be a lovely edition to anyone's collection, provided you still have the necessary equipment.

Clocking in at just under 50 minutes, this special is fun, funny, and demonstrates perfectly Disney's ability to craft excellent animation for children and adults.  It is a pity that it isn't available (along with some of its companion pieces) on DVD.",1200268800,9,1538,4.906976744186046
