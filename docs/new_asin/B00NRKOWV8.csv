8679886,4,B00NRKOWV8,"I know it's from the '80s, but I love it's message. It makes me smile and even laugh. It also gives me a good-natured kick in the pants.",1453680000,2,136,3.892857142857143
8679887,5,B00NRKOWV8,"This is a very dated little movie that has a powerful message of sharing the joy of the Lord.  It's fun sitting with my friends (especially those who were born after 1980) and listen to their running quips and comments only to be confronted in the end (in parabolic form): Am I sharing the the joy of the Lord with those around me?  Which leads to the question, do I have any joy in my Lord?  This is a delightful little reminder for all believers.",1433548800,2,448,4.247058823529412
