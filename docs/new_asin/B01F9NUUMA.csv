8760504,5,B01F9NUUMA,We always enjoy Buddy Ebsen. He didn't disappoint us on this one.,1496361600,,65,4.5
8760505,1,B01F9NUUMA,All episodes were edited by at least 5 minutes.  I knew seasons 2 and 3 were edited which is why I won't buy them.  I put my faith in season 4 due to excellent rated reviews (Only 4 of them) and got cheated.  No more Barnaby Jones for me until all seasons are complete and not edited.  Its so disgusting that I stopped watching after 4 episodes.  Don't buy any Barnaby Jones seasons until they stop editing them.  Only Season 1 is worth buying.,1490572800,8,444,4.226190476190476

8760509,5,B01F9NUUMA,"Barnaby Jones one of the best detective shows ever made. Hollyweird can't touch this show for it's originality and writing and directing and
of course acting by Ebsen and all the great actors. This is as good as the first 3 seasons with some of the better episodes and before JR
joined the cast which was and is not as good but still worth adding to collection. Can't wait to watch this along with first 3 seasons! It's
sad that CBS didn't take the time to restore these properly and took so long to release them! glad to get rid of my horrible bootlegs.",1466553600,2,554,4.336538461538462
