The graphics are so amazing... i can't believe that every issue this thing looks better and better.  If you are a shorts lover, don't miss it.  If you aren't, I bet you'll become one.  FilmFest has some great selections of shorts and interviews... check it out!",980467200,5,418,4.506666666666667
8394214,5,B000050ICJ,"This is a cool DVD magazine with behind the scenes stuff and video articles from Cannes and the South By South West Film Festival.  There are interviews with Willem Dafoe and John Waters that are pretty interesting but the best thing about this DVD is the hour of short films.  In particular, Five Feet High And Rising (which won Sundance and Cannes last year) is amazing, raw filmmaking that is sure to be nominated for best short film in the Academy Awards.  There is also a student animation called Luz which was nominated for a student Academy Award last year.",980294400,4,564,4.62

8394216,4,B000050ICJ,"I got this DVD though Amazon. This is a dvd magazine dvd that covers diffrent film fest. The first 4 are much better then this last. That not to say that this is bad but if you can not all 5 this is a good one to skip. You can get a sub. to this dvd magazine off each dvd. The plus to a sub is that it will sent to you at home without having to check when the next will come out. The plus from getting here is that you can skip one if you do not think you will like it and save yourself some money.
I get mine here because you really do not save alot of money getting from the film-fest sub.",974419200,2,591,3.661417322834646
