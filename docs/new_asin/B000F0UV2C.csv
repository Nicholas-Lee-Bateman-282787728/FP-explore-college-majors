8116310,2,B000F0UV2C,"Its poorly made. And  its a wannabe Muppet movie,  Very disappointing, It might be entering for a four year old",1384473600,,111,4.5
8116311,3,B000F0UV2C,A good basic western story that is worth the time to watch. It is a nice story that you can easily watch and understand,1383091200,,119,4.0
8116312,5,B000F0UV2C,These films were funny and hilarious to people of all ages! If you loved Shari Lewis and you love Veggietales you should love these!,1334361600,,132,4.541666666666667
8116313,3,B000F0UV2C,"The acting in this movie is not very good, but my younger elementary aged kids really like this, so that is what counts.  As a very conservative mom who vigilantly keeps track of what my kids watch, I am glad they like it and it is one of the very few movies that they are allowed to watch on their own (since I previewed it first).",1280707200,,332,4.03030303030303
8116314,5,B000F0UV2C,I highly recommend all of the videos made by this company! Great to use in VBS for your church or in other Children's Bible programs! The stories are memorable and teach lessons that children will remember their entire life. There is a great need for decent Christian viewing options that teach character and good morals. Our kids LOVE the puppets! Great buy and addition to any Christian family library!,1255651200,,404,4.869565217391305
8116315,2,B000F0UV2C,"I thought this movie was weird and boring. The kids hate it. Its got a little moral to it, but its pretty cheasy and the acting is very bad. Its almost like a bunch of neighbors got together and said ""let's make a movie"". I think this film is a waste of money and a backyard production. I was not impressed.",1212364800,,307,4.049180327868853
