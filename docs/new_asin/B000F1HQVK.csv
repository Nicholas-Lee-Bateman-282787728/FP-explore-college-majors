8116427,4,B000F1HQVK,"Home Birth: The Spirit, The Science, and the Mother is a 46 minute DVD produced by Sage Femme with interviews of doctors and mothers who have given birth at home. The film also includes two home births amongst the interviews with much joy and siblings present.

I was pleasantly surprised by this film. I didn't expect it to deliver anything I hadn't heard or seen before and yet, because every woman's experience is different and nearly every professional that loves mothers and babies has some wisdom to add to the subject, I walked away from watching this film with a new dimension added to my respect for home birth. Marsden Wagner, MD opens the film and is always engaging with his stories. I got a lot out of his explanation of the MotherBaby dyad and the physiological proof for the safety of home birth. Just for his interview that lasts a few minutes, I would recommend this DVD to all women and parents to be.

Next, Jeanine Tgettis, a chiropractor and home birth mother is interviewed and tells of her home birth experience, and how she chose a traditional midwife as her birth attendant and how she came about the decision to have a home birth and the blessing it was to her. Jeanine has such a sweet countenance and I enjoyed this part of the film very much.

Fred Duhart, a family practitioner and osteopathic physician, is an interesting addition to the film as he does home deliveries based on his experience from learning to attend home births with midwives in his student days. A rare thing now a days, I appreciate the thought that attending a woman in birth opens the relationship for becoming her families physician from that point on. During the interview, a home birth mother tells her story of how she came to have home births, her choice to use Dr. Duhart for her fourth baby and includes the birth of one of her baby with thoughts from her other children on witnessing their new brother's birth. I give this movie four stars because I felt like Duhart mumbled a little bit and was harder to understand than the other people who were interviewed.

Home Birth: The Spirit, The Science and The Mother offers a perspective on home birth that many do not come to until they have seen many births, like the professionals interviewed, or until a bad hospital experience leads a woman to consider home birth. I think that this film is something that many people should watch in order to deepen their understanding of home birth where they might not otherwise. It is definitely an opportunity to learn from the wisdom of those who have gone before. Won't you take the opportunity?

This film is available as the first disc in the attending birth set from love delivers: [...] The attending birth set can also be purchased from Your Water Birth:[...]",1358726400,,2766,4.6482617586912065
8116428,4,B000F1HQVK,"This is a good video for those contemplating a homebirth.

There are 2 doctors who give clear and convincing evidence on why a homebirth is safe, more personal, fulfulling and beneficial not only to the mother and baby but the rest of the family as well.

There are also several women who recount their experiences with homebirth and having a midwife present as being a safe, normal and natural process than a hospital birth.  The one woman's daughters also talk about their experience at being at their mom's homebirth as being very positive.

This is not a video showing births after births, if that is what you want.

However, there is beautiful water birth included in it that was videotaped by a daughter.

Buy this video if you want excellent reasons as to why you and your family should have a homebirth.",1166313600,2,811,4.676056338028169

No matter how small the home or house or apartment or whatever, home IS our Castle.  It is where we feel the best and most relaxed and sure of ourselves to do everything...Well, almost everything.  Too bad more families don't stay home for birth.

We have another Arab saying, ""Ask someone who tried and ask an expert.""  As I watched HOME BIRTH:  The Spirit, The Science and The Mother, I realized that in this one DVD, there were both experts and women who had tried both homebirth and hospital.  The doctors all encourage homebirth.  The women would never consider the hospital after a homebirth.  The doctors say homebirth is safer and more empowering.  The women and families appear ecstatic.  There are no drugs and medical interventions in homebirth.  So why don't more families JUST STAY HOME for birth?

Great thanks to the women and doctors in this very instructive DVD.  I advise everybody to listen to them.",1162684800,2,1066,4.6310160427807485

I am thrilled to find a film which inspires women to step past fear

and allow themselves to enjoy the process of their children's births.

Homebirth: The Spirit, The Science and The Mother by Diana Paul is rich

with human experience and scientific facts which are not commonly shared.

 This film will assist in teaching parents about options for birth beyond the hospital.  The awareness of midwifery is slowly growing.  In California we have faulty midwifery laws.  Laws that have needed to be changed.  Hopefully, this film will help to raise the general consciousness about this issue.

Thanks to Sage Femme for the making of this surprising and instructive film.

8116431,5,B000F1HQVK,"This was a very moving and inspirational movie. For any woman who is considering a home birth and still has reservations, this is a 'must see'. It brings it all back to basics and reminds us that birth is a natural and beautiful thing and something to be savoured and enjoyed. A home birth can be a very fulfilling experience for both parents and this dvd captured that perfectly. Well done for keeping a simple and natural experience just that!",1160438400,3,445,4.575

This movie will be of great use to any parents-to-be, their families, doctors, doulas, nurses, midwives & any one else with intrest in the joys of childbirth.

Thank you so much for sharing and spreading the word that natural births are just that....natural!",1158537600,3,412,4.942028985507246
8116433,5,B000F1HQVK,"This video starts with Marsden Wagner, MD, a neonatologist and World Health Organization expert on maternal health.  He makes a compelling case for returning normal birth to the province of the midwife as an expert in providing the best possible care for the mother/baby dyad.  He also does a nice job of explaining how American maternity care has gone wrong by chopping up the care into unrelated fields of obstetrics and newborn care.  It is refreshing to hear him railing against unnecessary separation of mother and baby as doing ""all kinds of harm to the mother and the baby"", including epidemics in the newborn nurseries.

Although I found the second and third segments inspiring, I'm concerned that their focus on the quality of the mother's birth experience and the spiritual aspects of birth might give the wrong impression that these aspects were considered more important than basic safety.

Overall, this is an excellent addition to the library of any midwife or childbirth educator.",1152662400,2,995,5.079754601226994
8116434,5,B000F1HQVK,"Homebirth:  The Spirit, The Science and The Mother is an outstanding movie. It shows step by step how the homebirth alternative is not only safe and humane but can also be a window into a deeply transformative spiritual passage for the whole family.

As a holistic childbirth educator I am thrilled to have this film available for my classes.  I will also be recommending it highly to my associates in the birthing community.  It is beautifully executed with a refined artistic eye and is filled with lovely images, photos and music.  It is a meaningful contribution to the work of anyone who wants to see safe, humane, and loving birth accessible for all mothers and babies.  For those of us who dream of a shift in the paradigm of assembly line high tech births cranked out at top speed the testimony of the authorities in this film ring convincingly there are alternatives available.",1149552000,4,886,4.758169934640523
8116435,5,B000F1HQVK,"Review of  HOME BIRTH: THE SPIRIT, THE SCIENCE, AND THE MOTHER

by Uva Meiner, Homebirth Midwife, San Jose Costa Rica

First we have Marsden Wagner, M.D. and Consultant of the World Health Organization on issues of Maternal and Newborn Health. It is wonderful to hear this man, doctor, and authority on this subject, speak so clearly, informatively, and logically about the reality of the American birthing scene. He compares it to countries in Western Europe, which have a more humane approach to Birth, Mother, and Baby and better outcomes. It is uplifting for women and families to hear him say and appreciate, what most mothers already know in the inner wisdom of their bodies. I particularly appreciate that he does not consider himself being God in Scrubs, but is in Awe of Nature and the birthing process.

Then we have soft, feminine Jeanine Tgettis, D.C. talking about her home breech birth. Telling us what is possible when we take our life and birth into our own hands and home by not letting the fear machine and programming take over our lives. Thank you Jeanine, your gentle and powerful body language rocking your baby while you talk transmits joy and a deep security in your body, which is your gift to every baby to come into this world.

In the third part we have Fred Duhart, Family Physician, sharing his work and life with mothers and babies and birth. Laurel, one of his clients (I prefer to call a birthing mother a client, as she is neither sick nor does she normally need to be rescued) a very strong and spirited woman, tells us about her negative experience at the hospital birth of her first child where she literally locked the OB out of the delivery room to avoid a c-section. Now she lets us share the sacred moments with her family, birthing her fourth child at home in the bathtub, assisted by Fred Duhart. Her daughters sharing, her husband supporting, the mother birthing, this is as pure, powerful, and good as life gets.

At the end we have Diana Paul, the producer of this video, sharing the waves of the sea, and the waves of her family and births, leaving us with a sense of belonging, a belonging to Mother Earth and Life.  As she says:"" Love delivers!""

A beautiful, powerful video, confirming the miracle and wisdom of Mother and Baby, and the deep respect and trust we caregivers need to find before we approach them.",1149465600,3,2361,4.658653846153846
