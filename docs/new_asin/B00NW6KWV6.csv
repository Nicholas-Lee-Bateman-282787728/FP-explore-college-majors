6682176,5,B00NW6KWV6,"I waited to buy part 2, then marathon watched LH 1 & 2 over a weekend. Frankly, I couldn't get enough! I know there are tons of haters of the series for whatever reason but I loved it. Like any series there are some minor flaws here and there but nothing at ALL that would prohibit me from calling it a great show and a LOT of fun to watch. Some, actually most, of the humor had me laughing aloud in my house, watching all by myself. Akatsuki was a riot and I loved her right from jump street - but the rest of the cast and crew were truly amazing and did an outstanding job throughout.

If I had to pick anything to be ""upset"" about, it'd be the wrap up to part 2 because it made me itch for season 2 (hopefully we'll get that soon!!!) like nobody's business!!! Still, for those who enjoy anything along the lines SAO, or magic-ruled / sci-fy oriented series - I don't think you can go wrong with Log Horizon. Plus it's heavily embedded with humor just as much as fighting, mentoring, learning the new world, and more - there's pretty much something for most anyone to latch onto in my opinion. Definite, 5 star series!!",1428364800,5,1121,4.238317757009346

6682179,5,B00NW6KWV6,"This was a very solid second half to the first season. It started off great with the gravity of the situation the characters were now in and the sudden appearance of the Goblin King and all the danger it poses to both themselves and the People of the Land. It was a well needed diversion from the whole 'People of the Land' storyline that had absorbed the episodes previously. However the season petered out towards the end, almost dismissing the Goblin King arc entirely despite the fact it was clearly not fully resolved to make room for what I expect to be the main conflict/focus of season 2. Which is fine, I enjoyed every minute of the show, but for overall story progression, it seemed to stagnate until the very end, and then it was over. Left me wanting more, but I had no doubt I'll get all collection volumes for the second seasons as well; the characters are well written, acted and realistically portrayed. (with some exceptions - Marielle) Great show and can't wait to see where it will take me next!",1425859200,,1014,4.546448087431694

6682181,2,B00NW6KWV6,"I'd like to state first that this is a good series and I like it very much.  Otherwise, you wouldn't be buying the second volume of the said series.

That said, Log Horizon Collection 2 blurays do not work in my bluray player.  I have a Panasonic bluray player I bought it from Wallmart just a month ago.  When I pop these disc in, I see this message:

""LICENSED SOLELY FOR USA AND CANADA.

THIS DISC, ITS CONTENT, AND FEATURES ARE NOT LICENSED FOR SALE AND VIEWING IN THIS REGION.

CONTENT AND FEATURES ARE UNAVAILABLE IN THIS REGION""

Then all I see is a black screen.  I checked my bluray player with other anime bluray with Sentai and Funimation.  This is the only set of discs that does this. Even Log Horizon Collection 1 blurays work without problem.

I am very upset.  What am I to do if I can't watch a bluray with a player I bought in US soil?  No, WHY WOULD YOU PUT A REGION LOCK AT ALL ON BLURAY DISCS MARKED AS 'ALL' REGION RATING?",1422748800,3,944,4.206703910614525
6682182,5,B00NW6KWV6,"I watched this series on Crunchyroll was thoroughly impressed. Many people are quick to compare this and SAO, and while i did enjoy SAO for its own reasons this anime totally BLOWS it out of the water. Well paced and mature throughout with fantastic art episode after episode left me wanting more. I fully admit that I'm a biased fan when i say this, but right now i truly can't find anything bad to say about this movie. As a gamer i appreciate the accuracy and true to form world that they created, and while i can see how it might be overwhelming for someone with no background in MMORPGs, i feel like i can safely say it still handles the knowledge gap in fans very well. Truly a cut above, this is DEFINITELY a must see anime",1417305600,25,730,4.297101449275362

6682204,5,B00NW6KWV6,"WARNING! READ BEFORE BUYING BE INFORMED

I like this series and its great and all but in this case the licensing securities policies embedded in the blu-ray disk that I bought. It takes away part of the viewing experience of the series because the blu-ray says region A blu-ray and for some strange reason a licensing pop up came on telling me it can not be played in this region.
The blu-ray player is zone A that I own what I found out it(blu-ray player) has to be with manufactured in dvd code zone 1 that is Canada and U.S.A.if your bluray zone A is manufactured with other zones not region 1 dvd it will not play any  zone A blu-ray with (geo-blocking) or worse country code manufacturing code embedded.
In this case was the Log horizon season 1 collection 2 series bluray  and putting it on a blu-ray pc won't help.

6682206,5,B00NW6KWV6,"In a popular anime and manga subgenre that includes Sword Art Online, Log Horizon stands out because instead of being Yet Another story about how do they escape from a computer game gone insane, this is the story of how do they make their online life better until they figure out how to escape it and go home.  More importantly, as ties binding characters to this world increase along with the time spent there, how many of these gamers would choose to go home rather than stay if they eventually get the chance?

Note: The two seasons of this show have been released on four DVD or Blu-ray sets, with each season split at about the halfway point, episodes 13-14:

Following the Catastrophe, the update that traps them in the game, the characters of Log Horizon distinguish themselves from all of the other such characters in such shows by concentrating on building and improving their world, and it is fairly remarkable when one compares the time spent in battle with the time spent in something else.  In particular in this second half of season 1 a lot more effort is put into arranging the politics and the allies for the battle against the Goblin King than in the actual battling itself, particularly the role of the Princess.  Also of particular note is the training of and separate adventures of the low-level brigade of player characters.

Defects?  About the only noticeable one is the overused Harem Plot Device: the main hero, the virginal Shiroe, acquires something approaching half a dozen of ladies in various levels of love for him of which he is totally clueless, and let's not even bring up Soujiro Seto's West Wind Brigade.

My title reference?  Well, I was not much surprised to learn that the previous Manga/Anime for which Mamare Touno was famous for was&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/M-A-O-Y-U/dp/B00IOFDKAK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">M.A.O.Y.U.</a>, a course on Medieval macroeconomics and geopolitics disguised as a fantasy adventure.

6682209,5,B00NW6KWV6,"I love anime, and I enjoy ""trapped in a game world"" stories. This isn't the first anime to tackle the theme (.hack//SIGN, Sword Art Online, many others), but it holds its own against those and it is my favorite of them all. (And one of my all-time top favorite anime, period.)

The premise: when a multi-player online role-playing game launches an expansion, everyone who logs into the game that day finds themselves trapped in that game world. And the world itself is subtly different from the game world. For example, the characters that had been programmed for the game are now sentient and self-aware, and can freely move about in the world. The story is about creating a new, civilized society of player characters, many of whom want to fight each other or take advantage of each other, while also trying to forge alliances with the game-world characters. All while trying to figure out what happened to trap everyone, and what the rules are in this world.

This anime stands out because the world is complex, the characters well-rounded, and the story interesting. It is also good-natured without being sappy or unbelievable. Even minor characters have dimension and substance. And instead of being fragile, helpless, and one-dimensional, the women, even the female children, are as strong, resourceful, brave, and fully realized as the male characters.

Even if you are not a gamer, the characters do such a good job explaining game mechanics that you will understand the game-related references. And it isn't all about game mechanics. The interactions among the characters, and the changing dynamics of the world situation, are the main focus of the story.

This DVD, which is the second half of season 1, offers both subtitled versions of each episode with the original Japanese voice cast, and dubbed versions with English voice acting. I recommend watching this anime subbed rather than dubbed; the English voice actors are okay, but not nearly as good as the Japanese cast.",1459036800,,1985,5.006060606060606
