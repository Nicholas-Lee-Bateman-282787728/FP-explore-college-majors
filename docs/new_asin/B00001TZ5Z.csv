1246239,2,B00001TZ5Z,"A rip-off of Swingers and Kevin Smith movies. It's painfully obvious from the director's and writer's commentary that these guys know nothing about making films or storytelling.  One is a bad film editor and the other  writes comic books and ""Star Trek"" journalism. Very little was  actually funny, and the drama was filled with false notes and awkward  dialogue.  Go rent/buy Swingers or Chasing Amy instead!",949363200,3,409,5.136363636363637
1246240,5,B00001TZ5Z,"This movie is about the lives of sci-fi fans.  It truly reminded me of how my friends and I act, including amassing huge movie collections and making obscure references to sci-fi.  About half of the lines of dialog contain  some kind of reference to other movies and TV shows, so many in fact that  there is a subtitle track that explains all of the references.  The many  extras on the DVD are terrific, including commentary, making-of  documentary, and a glossary of terms used in the movie.  I laughed  throughout.  I completely enjoyed it.",948153600,4,543,4.741935483870968
1246241,1,B00001TZ5Z,"In MY HUMBLE OPINION: This film stinks.  Sorry I can't jump on the bandwagon, but I truly hated it.  I found it to be poorly acted & executed, amateurish and very unfunny.  Not to mention BORING.  I spent  more time looking at my watch in the theatre that I did at the screen.  Shatner is completely wasted in this film, so much fun could have been  mined from him playing himself, but instead the filmmakers swerved the  narrative line into an oh-so predictable love story.  Also, the ""Star  Trek"" and comic book geeks portrayed in this film couldn't be farther  from the real thing.  Don't waste your time with this one.  Instead check  out ""TREKKIES"" a truly funny look at ""Star Trek"" fans.",947721600,12,693,4.528455284552845
1246242,5,B00001TZ5Z,"I rented Free Enterprise on a whim, expecting little or nothing, hoping at least to garner a laugh or two from the notion of William Shatner playing himself. But I was shocked to find a film that not only accurately captures  and parodies a real-world sense of just how pervasive the science fiction  lifestyle can be, but also manages to do so in an intelligent, witty, and  completely captivating manner. The dialogue is well-written and delivered,  the directing is professional, and there isn't a weak actor in the entire  production.
I enjoyed the film so much, I had to buy it.

1246243,5,B00001TZ5Z,"I've watched this movie 5 times. I still laugh so hard my head hurts. If you've ever been in a comic book shop, owned an action figure, or even considered attending a con, you will be doubled over with laughter. This  movie targets Sci-Fi fans with sniper-like precision.
Ultimately, this is  a love story. And even if you don't pick up on most of the myriad ""in  jokes"", the movie works. The whole cast is great. Audie England is  simply stunning...and Bill Shatner does a marvelous job of lampooning  himself.
Do yourself a favor and watch this movie.",945475200,4,553,4.6020408163265305

1246245,4,B00001TZ5Z,"I bought this film partly because of Shatner, pertly because Mark Altman (Producer) writes for Cinescape and had piqued my interest in the film, and partly because I was able to purchase the DVD for $7.50 with a coupon.
I  must say, I was pleasently surprised!  First of all, this is a top-notch  DVD, especially for such a film- no one took any notice of it at the box  office.  There are some very funny deleted scenes, a very interesting and  informative audio commentary, and even making-of goodies like a documentary  and screen tests.  My favorite extra was a sort of glossary that explained  some of the more obscure sci-fi in jokes it the movie.
Which brings me to  why I probably enjoyed the film as much as I did- I am a pretty big  sci-fi/movie fan.  I was rolling on the ground at some of the quotes and  references (my favorite: the group is on a roadtrip to Toys R Us.  As they  near the parking lot, someone says, ""Almost there!"", and another  retorts with, ""Stay on target!"".  If you don't get the reference,  it is from the first Star Wars movie- my brother and I caught it  immediatly- the inflection was just right.  A good example of the movie's  humor.)  But the movie is not just for genre fans.  My mom liked it a lot  too- it has a story in there somewhere, albeit a thin one.
Overall-  entertaining movie, wonderful DVD.",943833600,12,1345,4.413934426229508

1246259,5,B00001TZ5Z,"This movie has no real purpose.  It is avante garde and surreal and parts of it take place in a mall in western Los Angeles--the movie making district (whatever)--which is why it is such an enjoyable movie for ex-Californians who grew up on Star Trek and Star Wars and Ferris Buehler/Breakfast Club, and had real contact with that mall and movie stars at grocery stores or the beach, restaurants, and clubs--and don't have any of that contact any longer (our lives are droll by comparison--but more real, clearly!).  This is an area of the world where nothing is real--even when you're living there, your own life takes on a kind of unrealness.  And after all these years to be reminded of your past life's un-real-ness in such a fun (oddball) way is simply a treat.

And it's not really a party movie--is it?  It's about the real work behind the party (including the dreaming about the real work behind the party).

Bill Shatner is one of the greatest actors of the past 50 years and I have had the pleasure to have him work on many of my projects (which include the likes of Katharine Hepburn, Julie Harris, Kirk Douglas, Jeremy Irons, Gary Oldman, Michael Caine, etc.).

1246268,4,B00001TZ5Z,"Independent movies are a dime a dozen, always trying to be self exporative and deep in thought since more than likely they are slim on budget and substance.  They usual come off so obvious and lame, that you get bored...see Eraserhead...actually don't!  Clockwork Orange is overrated too.  I was not a fan of Star Trek, that doesn't mean I hate it...it means I can tolerate it...I just am not in the know of every facit of the series and I will not be dressing up like one of these goofs at a convention.  My friend Josh is a huge fan, this movie came on Cinemax and was a independent movie blatantly thru production.  However this movie didn't try to be anything but a basic story with two guys stuck in the mid life crisis we all eventually end up.  Where youth meets old and the in-between was moreless forgotten or ignored until one day it hits you in the face.  Oddly these two dorks...and I say that because everyone has friends that they can be dork around and not the rest of the world, be it a variety of subjects for which you dork too.  Anyway these two dorks are having relationship woes, one is a career guy, one is a bum, both experience the same thing, but the bum surpases the career guy because he is loose in affilation and not as tight wound articulate as the latter whom shuns the notion of a womans place as it seems its a mere object for which he is employeed by - who really hasn't felt like that before?  William Shatner...their god...comes into play when they meet him at a books store...where truth be know the biggest dorks...and usually best chicks reside (I should really get out of the bars and find ones there).  Shatner is there buying a adult magazine and the forthcomming friendship they spark with him destroys not only their perfect image of him, but also gives them realization.  Both my friend Josh (a treky) and myself enjoyed this movie.  Maybe there is hope for us all and I am not a generation X guy!",1266451200,3,1942,4.408963585434174
1246269,3,B00001TZ5Z,"June of /99 saw the original US release of Free Enterprise. This special two disc edition was released in 2005 with added additional footage to the original version. It is a smartly done spoof on pop culture and the lives of those that are wrapped up in it.
The story involves two good friends Robert(Rafer Weigal) and Mark(Eric McCormack).Robert is the Yin to Mark's Yang. Robert's work life(in film editing)is inconsistent and sporadic at best while Mark has a steady job(film writing and conception).As a result Robert is usually broke while Mark is not. While Robert has relationships(even though they don't last long),Mark has never had a meaningful relationship. One common thread running through both is their common knowledge(some may say obsession) of pop culture references especially pertaining to movies and more specifically to the world of Star Trek. Another commonality resides in their love lives in that neither,for different reasons, have been able to find a partner that truly understands both for who they are.
One day while in a book shop who should the guys spot but William Shatner,their idol,in the flesh. They try and act cool and almost end up scaring him off. They somehow manage to find out that Mr Shatner is having a writing block and when Mark mentions his writing abilities and contacts in that field,a friendship is struck;much to the guys amazement. As the film progresses Shatner pops in and out of the picture drinking with them and playing pool with them,while all the while trying to pitch his idea to do a musical of Julius Caesar;with Shatner playing almost every part! Shatner they find out,is not only a human being like them,but also quite the flake!
As the movie progresses we see the guys interacting not only with themselves but their many friends. All can spout off a line or scenario from their favourite movie and/or TV show at any given moment. The quotes and references come fast and furious throughout,along with the dope on the latest collectible or movie,which again gives a commonality to them all;they're pop culture geeks. It's the birds of a feather,flock together scenario.
As the movie winds down Robert springs a surprise birthday party on Mark. At this point things finally come around for the main characters. Mark and Robert finally settle in with women that are on their level of understanding;ones that ""get"" them. Shatners' ""crazy"" idea of a musical Julius Caesar,not so crazy after all, comes to fruition as he(impressively)does it in rap(!)style to end the film.
Not only is this film a send up of the pop culture idiom there is also a lesson here to not create false ""idols"" out of ordinary human beings;William Shatner being the case in point. The film does this in a marvellously entertaining way and all involved play it straight and infuse a recognizable realism into each character. There will very few people that watch this that won't be able to relate to what they see on the screen,especially if they're well versed in movies and the Sci-Fi genre;I know I could....maybe way too much! While ""the rest"" of society might consider these people geeks or even morons for their so called obsession with movies and collectibles,there is something else working concurrently on another level here;these people are smart,they are not idiots. To be able to flip off the date of a TV show,or quote a Kirk soliloquy at a moments notice,or to know a lines nuances and dynamics and its connection to the greater wholetakes alot of grey matter. These are no dummies,they just have a different point of life reference than the rest of""normal""society. And what's wrong with that,as long as it's not in the extreme?
Technically the transfer of the film onto DVD is quite well done. This was an indy film so the grade of film stock while not consistently the best is certainly not bad by any stretch. It is presented here in a nice widescreen format.
Special features are here aplenty....and I mean aplenty. There is commentary from the director/producer,commentary from some of its' stars including Mr. Shatner,an over hour(!)featurette on the making of the movie,numerous deleted scenes,screentests,the trailer and TV spots,the music video of the Julius Caesar number with Shatner and a 20 page booklet.
In conclusion while this isn't OSCAR material,this indy film is quite refreshing in its' self deprecation and one MANY of us(maybe too many?)can easily identify with. It takes an affectionate look at pop culture immersion and the false ""idols"" that are created as a result,but never takes it all too seriously. The leads played by McCormack and Weigal are bang on in their portrayals for their realism and immediacy. This certainly was a leap of faith for its' main star William Shatner and he too is to be praised for his portrayal and the guts to do this film at all. It's indy ""slip"" may show from time to time but this is a great example of ""from small acorns,giant oaks grow"".And with all the material available on these two discs,you are certainly getting alot of ""oak"" for the buck. I recommend it.",1258675200,2,5070,4.917152858809802
1246270,5,B00001TZ5Z,"Although this might not be everyone's type of humor, William Shatner is always wonderful, especially when he's laughing at himself and allowing us to laugh too...
There are so many quick references to all things 60's, 70's, and 80's, that many people wouldn't catch the inuendos, but I thought this was hilarious...
Highly recommended to anyone who can remember all of the tv series and music and games from that era...",1231286400,,419,4.915492957746479
1246271,4,B00001TZ5Z,"So let me just say that this movie is NOT going to appeal to the mainstream. If you're not a sci-fi/horror movie/comics geek you will probably loathe this movie to the core of your very being. In fact, even if you are a geek you may not like this movie for whatever reason. There are parts that make me squirm, like with Moaning Girl faking an orgasm on the answering machine for like 20 minutes and I could have done without the threesome scene. The production values aren't alway fantastic (direction, acting in some scenes) and sometimes it's maybe just a bit too self-conscious and clever.

However, let me just say that when I first watched this movie in my late teens it was like a life-changing epiphany for me. I was like holy crap, these are my people. They do exist out there in the world. I'm not the only one. (I was a bit sheltered growing up.)
I don't love everything about this movie, but I do love most of it. I love Eric McCormack's manic monologue at the beginning about his idea for the Bradykiller movie (serial killer kills women named Marcia, Jan, and Cindy) and his pitch-perfect Shatner impersonation. I love how Rafer Wiegel tells off some snotty bimbo who makes fun of his action figure collection, by pointing out that her fifty some pairs of shoes aren't much better. I love how Shatner plays himself as a bumbling, goofy kook. I love how when Claire spouts off the list of comics titles that she reads I have this urge to pull out a pad of paper and take notes so I can check out the titles she references. I love any movie with the line ""you're as transparent as Wonder Woman's invisible jet"", as well as the Aliens reference ""bad call Ripley, it was a bad call.""

All in all this movie seems like an affectionate love letter to geek culture. It really captures the dynamic of a group of friends who have bonded over an intense passion for sci-fi and comics, so much so that they have their own vocabulary and verbal shorthand for certain situations--just like groups of close friends in real life. An entertaining, weird little indie movie that I recommend to fans of Star Trek, science fiction movies, and comics.",1208131200,5,2145,4.5115681233933165
1246272,4,B00001TZ5Z,"There were good parts to this movie, but overall I wasn't that thrilled with it. The whole rap thing at the end everyone raves about was not that funny. I did like Shatner however and found him to be honest and realistic in his portrayal.",1195171200,,238,4.311111111111111
1246273,5,B00001TZ5Z,"One reviewer here marvels at Shatner's ability to make such good fun of himself, and wonders if it's because Shatner has no ego at all, or an ego so big that nothing can touch it.

Others have given a synopsis of the film; I watched it for Shatner. Some are just born with the ""American cool"" gene -- McQueen had it, Bogie had it, Bugs Bunny had it (!), and shocking though the comparison may be, so does Shatner. It defies logic, but there it is. Some people are just ""cool"" without trying -- they have an instict, they can't help it. This movie is a kind of documentation of some of Shatner's ""cool"" in action. The whole story is hilarious but honest, about two Star Trek geek sci-fi professionals coming of age and being disillusioned but growing from it. I originally watched it for Shatner, but rewatch it now for the whole story because it's all good.

As for the size of Bill Shatner's ego, I figure it's as big and impervious as the universe he explored as Captain Kirk, and that's a good thing. Probably my favorite line in the movie is after Robert finally confronts Bill with the fact that Bill's dream project of a 6-hour musical production (three intermissions) of a one-man Julius Caesar titled ""William Shakespeare and William Shatner Present: Caesar"" is ... well, pretty crazy, Bill blinks. Then he acknowledges that of course it's completely insane! No one would sit through that -- ""But I think I can do it!"" he enthuses.

It's an odd combination of humility and infinite ego, and maybe gives insights into the mystery of ""cool."" Who knows. One thing I do know: this movie is great watching for anybody who appreciates William Shatner.",1194739200,4,1653,4.615646258503402
1246274,2,B00001TZ5Z,"Set up in part as a parody of Star Trek, comic books, Science Fiction and Horror movies and series, Free Enterprise brings to the screen the story of two geeky friends nearing their thirties as they go about their life with their every day problems, until one day they meet their number one hero, William Shatner, by chance and their whole world comes undone...
As a major fan of comics and Science fiction, I was rather disappointed with the film in that the actors' performances are not that great, the plot and the music are mediocre, while the dialogues/humor could have been a LOT better.
One good thing that comes out if it is Audie England who was delightful as Claire; let's see more of her!
The potential for a good movie was definitely there, but it somehow fails to take off.  A shame really...

1246275,3,B00001TZ5Z,"Free Enterprise has it's moments, but it goes from straight out Trek comedy to a romantic drama/comedy with little references to Star Trek. The movie starts off with one kid trying to get into the theater to see Star Trek: The Motion Picture, while another kid in school is fighting a bully who is picking on him for wearing a gold Starfleet uniform like Kirk's. These two people grow up and become friends, and their dream comes true when they accidentally meet Shatner at a bookstore. After all of that, the film goes into drama mode when they start to fall in love with girls they meet and the movie feels like it drags since it can't live up to the beginning of the movie.

I liked the drama and romantic comedy, don't get me wrong, but with a name like ""Free Enterprise"" you would think that it would have more things related to Star Trek in it. The best scenes of the movie are the scenes with Shatner, he definitely steals the screen because no one can parody Shatner better than Shatner himself! Overall, this is a good movie that Trek fans of the original series will appreciate more than non-trekkies. The best parts of the movie are the beginning and end, the middle just leaves me asking myself ""what?"" It is almost a completely different movie, but all of the Shatner scenes are great!",1176940800,2,1298,4.5

1246278,5,B00001TZ5Z,"In 1987, in that infamous Saturday Night Live skit, William Shatner shocked his STAR TREK fans by admonishing them to ""get a life"" and to ""move out of (their) mother's basement."" In the very funny FREE ENTERPRISE, the undermining of Captain Kirk's mythic status continues and the re-invention of William Shatner begins. The back story to FREE ENTERPRISE was that William Shatner, initially, adamantly refused to take part in the film because he found his role, as originally written, to be too embarassingly iconic. He then collaborated with the movie makers, Robert Meyer Burnett and Mark A. Altman, to make over the role of ""Bill Shatner"" and add in more human foibles to the character. The resulting end product will leave you in stitches.

FREE ENTERPRISE follows the travails of two Los Angeles Star Trek-obsessed filmmakers: the self-contained, egotistical but going-nowhere-in-his-career Mark (Eric McCormack), whose 30th birthday is imminent, and his best friend, the irresponsible womanizer and slacker Robert (Rafer Weigel), who, in 6 months, will turn 30 himself. Mark had just blown a sales pitch (of his film opus, called BRADY KILLER) and Robert had just been dumped by his gal and accused of lacking commitment. Mark and Robert venture to a bookstore and bump into their longtime idol, Captain Kirk...I mean, William Shatner.... Initially put off by the duo's attentions, Shatner is soon imbibing with them in a bar and regaling them with his projected, mostly one-man show - a 6 hour long, musical play, titled WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE & WILLIAM SHATNER PRESENT: JULIUS CAESAR. Mark and Robert, thru the course of the film, discover that their hero is in fact a somewhat pathetic, aging fella who may be innately likable and may be down with the homies but still is someone who feels the pangs of self-doubt, especially when around women. As Robert wails to Mark, ""The man that we just met is not the man who invented the Corbomite Maneuver or the man who almost died defeating the Doomsday Machine!"" Most of the film, of course, chronicles Robert and Mark's attempts to find meaning in their lives as they deal with love, friendship, job fulfillment, and the horrors of turning 30. ""Bill"" Shatner sporadically pops in and out and, on occasion, even imparts wisdom when not falling down drunk or prattling about his musical play. It all culminates, of course, with Shatner's lively performance of ""No Tears for Caesar.""

I'm kicking myself for waiting so long to see this movie. This is a perfect complement for the tongue in cheek documentaries TREKKIES & TREKKIES 2. FREE ENTERPRISE is an independent film that reeks of irreverence and hipness. It delights in wallowing in in-joke pop cultural riffs, to which your inner geek will rejoice. Personally, I got a kick out of the various sci-fi film references (did you know 1982 was the best year ever for sci-fi films?). And, along the way, this flick also taught me the proper usage of the adjective ""Wagnerian."" Needless to say, STAR TREK references remain resolute in their frequency and consistency. There certainly isn't a shortage of witty, clever throw-away lines, some of which admittedly necessitates a disturbingly steep knowledge of nerdy pop culture trivia. I love how Mark and Robert, two intelligent, well-educated dudes, are still so influenced by their childhood obsessions. Captain Kirk's iconic hold is so strong that when Mark attempts to fix his best friend's romantic woes, he adapts a Kirk monologue to convince Robert's erstwhile girlfriend.

Rafer Weigel and Audie England are perfectly fine as Robert and his geek goddess soulmate Claire, while Eric McCormack is excellent as the acerbic know-it-all who actually suffers from well-camouflaged insecurities. But it is William Shatner, gleefully satirizing himself, who shines the brightest. Shatner channels his inner ham and somehow triumphs with a strong and surprisingly touching performance. With his fearless, full-on commitment to the role, I don't doubt that he won back many of the Trekker fans he alienated way back in SNL.

The special features highlights for me are: the Film Commentary by Writer/Editor/Director Robert Meyer Burnett and Writer/Producer Mark A. Altman; the 14 deleted scenes, running over 30 minutes;  ""Ebionics"" - a glossary of FREE ENTERPRISE terms aimed to help non-pop culture folks make sense of the otherwise indecipherable dialogue; ""Where No Fan Has Gone Before"" - the making of FREE ENTERPRISE; Screen Tests of Audie England, Mark's ""midget"" date, the sexy blonde in the car, and the green-painted girl; and, naturally, the ""No Tears For Caesar"" Spoken/Rap Video.

This was a project of love by Robert Meyer Burnett and Mark A. Altman, the writers of the film. These two, who also direct and produce this indie, are, not too shockingly, the basis for the fictional Robert and Mark, and, throughout the movie, their love of STAR TREK and science fiction shines thru. Somewhat masked behind the cool premise, the wit, and the hilarity is that FREE ENTERPRISE is, at the core, a study in Gen X dysfunctionality, as well as a sensitive and thoughtful depiction of two friends striving to find purpose while eking out a living in the outer peripheries of Hollywood. This is a very, very good movie, which served to lengthen Shatner's career and make him fairly relevant again. Good going, Captain Kirk. But I wish we would've met Mark's phone orgasm girl.",1164412800,8,5422,5.093363329583802

I watched it just after seeing a Shatner biography on Star channel (an embarassing admission ), which probably made it even funnier. Just one additional point to make- Logans Run was a really really bad movie, despite the presence of Jennie Agutter.

Long before his current renaissance and current appreciation, this movie captured the wit and talent of the man who is a cultural icon, but ""much, much more"" as his says on the wonderful Ben Folds' produced ""Has Been.""  The film is rated R, which is great as it's not for kids with plenty of great eye candy.  By far the best performances are Rafer Weigel as the cooler of the two nerds and Eddie Deezen who we haven't seen in far too long.  The creator of ""Sledge Hammer"" does a funny cameo near the end which is sort of like what Tarentino did when he was in a movie telling his theories about ""Top Gun"".

Even thought I liked it the movie was way too long so I was curious about this new special edition and was startled to see that they took an already overlong movie and lengthened it to the point of ridiculous.  Well over two hours!  The unrated version of THE 40 YEAR OLD VIRGIN is way too long but that was a better movie.  This was tough to get through.  The commentaries were pretty annoying especially Eric McCormack who seems to think he's as famous as William Shatner.  By far the best part of the disc was an unsold pilot of real sci fi geeks sitting around talking and both Dan Webber and Darren Docterman were terrific.  There was also a deleted scene with Allan Spencer making up his own words that was funnier than the dialog in the movie.  It's too bad they didn't include the original version along with this new super long one.  FREE ENTERPRISE is longer than a real STAR TREK movie but is not as good as GALAXY QUEST.,1142208000,4,1053,4.304568527918781

However I found this movie to be entertaining non the less. Its just not about 2 Star Trek fans, but rather 2 guys not having a direction in life and are already 30 years old.

1246287,5,B00001TZ5Z,"I, Like a few others have expressed, discovered this movie on accident late one night on a movie channel. I was flipping through, close to change the channel wheni realized the characters were talking in a comic book store and a rather attractive girl mentioned a Sandman Hardcover.

The prospect of girls reading comic books, much less hot girls reading comic books intrigued me. Lettign myself stray from the remote I was treated to pop culture references that I felt as if were tailored just for me (I didn't know another 16 year old at the time who knew what Logan's Run was).

I love this movie for its references and writing, foremost. The wit is so thick you'd need a Bathlet just to swipe through it. From hilarious one-liners about favorite cinematic hotties, to the state of modern science fiction in the eyes of today's youth. ""I like Men in Black!""

Of course such wit could never be so golden if not portrayed in a skillful manner. This brings us to the talent of Free Enterprise.

First and foremost, the film features of the ""true American actors"", Will Shatner. Shatner has the uncanny ability to make fun of himself and still seem unscathed. His portrayal of the lonely celebrity is so well-done, you pull for him to findd love more than the main characters.

Robert (Rafer Weigel) and Mark (Eric McCormack)are two lonley geeks in California that have drastically different views on women. Robert sees them as beautiful companions that should be cared for, Mark, sees them as little more than sex objects.

You might recognize McCormack from his titular role on Will and Grace and thus peg him as the star. While McCormack does an excellent job, hitting every mark (heh) needed, it is Weigel who is portrays his role in such a way that most geeks can look at the screen and find themselves bumbling through his problems. Weigel proves his spot as star of the film with perhaps one of the best deliveries of ""F--- You Both"" in the history of film.

This movie is the epitome of what geek films should be, obscure references, humor and well written, well acted characters. Do not, pass this one up.",1141776000,,2113,4.663978494623656

They face being responsible and more serious, and try to figure out how their childhood loves can continue to be a part of their adult lives.

While not the laugh a minute one might assume when hearing this is a comedy, it is a great view that leaves the viewer with far more to think about than they might expect.",1141776000,2,518,4.329896907216495

Free Enterprise is a somewhat of a biography of the film's writer and director's obsession with growing up ""Star Trek"".  It is nice to see that they don't take themselves and the ""Trek"" phenomenon too seriously. Though on the surface the film may appear to be about Star Trek fanaticism, it really is a charming triple romantic comedy which will certainly appeal to a wider audience.",1133136000,6,544,4.891304347826087
1246298,4,B00001TZ5Z,"I picked it up at the library and I just had to check it out because it looked so bad - but I was pleasantly surprised.

Here's what the back cover says:

""Free Enterprise is the first film about the so-called ""Star Wars Generation,"" the thirtysomethings who are neither Generation X or Slackers. They are the baby boomers who grew up with Captain Kirk on the tube and Luke Skywalker on the big screen.""

""It's a dysfunctional story about 2 avid ""Star Trek"" fans...who meet their idol, William Shatner, and discover he's nothing like his fictional counterpart. With their illusions shattered, the two friends must face their fears about the future in this contemporary comedy that combines the hip, L.A. romantic milieu of ""Swingers,"" with the knowing pop culture sophistication of 'Clerks.'""

So, after reading that you know I had to check it out. It was a good little movie - not life changing, but funny for all of us who have ever referred to the person in the shotgun seat in the car as ""mr. Sulu"" because he has to be navigator. Fun things to watch for include: Kiss Action figures, Space 1999 spaceships hanging from the bedroom cieling, grown adult men looking at Star Wars dolls in the store, references to ""Logan's Run"" and William Shatner rapping.

Shatner plays himself and constantly pokes fun at his reputation as an arrogant, bombastic goof. Either the man has no ego, or his ego is so large that he doesn't mind being the butt of the joke.

If you watch this movie - be sure to watch during the credits - there's more, even though it looked like the movie was over.

In the credits it also says, tongue in cheek, to watch for the upcoming sequel ""Willaim Shatner vs. The World Crime League."" Now that sounds like a movie!",1104537600,11,1737,4.601941747572815
1246299,5,B00001TZ5Z,"There are probably many of you who have never seen or heard of this film. Well get out there and get it because this is a modern classic. This is a film for those of us who love Star Wars, Star Trek, comic books, toys, laserdiscs (DVD had not caught on yet when this film was made), Movies, and a good time.

The plot is a little strange. It's about two guys who are big film buffs and Star Trek fans. One day they get to meet their hero, William Shatner (played by William Shatner), and they find out that he is nothing like his fictional counterpart. In fact he is more screwed up then they are. William Shatner is GREAT in this movie. However, don't think that just because William Shatner is in this film it must be only for Trekkies. I give you my word. It is not.

There is more to this story but I am not going to go into all of it. Just think of this film as a Clerks meets Swingers kind of a thing. This film is funny and easy to watch. But what I really loved was all the pop culture references. The dialogue in this film sounded like so many conversations that I have had with my friends.

There are so many references to Star Wars, classic films, comics, and toys that I had to keep rewinding the film to catch them all. Let me just say that watching this film was like watching a big slice of my life. I believe many of you out there will agree.

For example there is a line in the deleted scenes were one of the guys, Robert, wants to borrow money from his friend, Mark, so that he can buy some new laserdiscs. Mark comments that he already owes him money and besides the power to his apartment has been turned off so what good is it to have new laserdics. In which Robert replies ""Sometimes it's enough just to know their there""

1246303,5,B00001TZ5Z,"In this hilarious indie film--very loosely based on the real-life experiences of scripters Mark Altman and Robert Burnett--STAR TREK's William Shatner is cast in the role he was born to play--William Shatner.

Mark (Eric McCormack of TV's WILL & GRACE) and Robert (Rafer Weigel) are 20-something science-fiction geeks employed at the fringes of the movie industry--Mark edits a movie-fan magazine that is an obvious take-off on FANGORIA and STARLOG; Robert is a film editor at a direct-to-video film studio called Full Eclipse, a blatant parody of the real-life studio Full Moon--who one day run into their childhood hero, William ""Captain Kirk"" Shatner, at a purely chance meeting in a second-hand bookstore.  But their mental image of Shatner is shattered when they see that the STAR TREK icon is not like his on-screen persona but is, in reality, just another egocentric actor with numerous human foibles.

Nonetheless, Mark and Robert are still smitten enough to pursue a friendship with ""Bill"" and promise to use their influence in ""the industry"" to help him get his pet project off the ground.  And that project is?  Well, it seems that Shatner wants to create a musical version of Shakespeare's JULIUS CAESAR in which the actor will play all the parts himself. (When Mark and Robert point out that playing both Caesar and Brutus means that Shatner will have to stab himself in the back, the actor replies, ""So? I've done it before."")

Along the way, all three ""boys"" do a bit of maturing and start to grow beyond their prolonged childhoods.  Robert gains a love interest (played by beautiful actress Audie England) and starts to take his career seriously; Mark gets over his ""mid-life"" crisis and accepts the fact that his 30th birthday draws nigh; and Bill's romancing of a pretty club owner (Deborah Van Valkenburgh, of TV's TOO CLOSE FOR COMFORT) helps deflate his ego a bit.

The script for FREE ENTERPRISE is well written and witty, the talented cast delivers humorous yet warmly empathetic performances, and the high production values make this indie film look like it was produced on a larger budget and at a mainstream studio.  The film has also won numerous awards, including Best New Writer(s) and Best Director at the 1998 AFI Film Fest, the Audience Award at the 1999 Newport Beach Film Festival, and the Saturn Award for the year 2000 from The Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy & Horror Films.  Yet FREE ENTERPRISE has never had a massive following and, consequently, has never fared too well financially.  On one hand, it's not too hard to understand why this feature never became a MAINSTREAM hit. The dialogue is replete with SF, Fantasy, Comic Book, and Horror references that are too esoteric for non-genre viewers, and William Shatner's outrageously self-deprecating performance will mean little to anyone unfamiliar with the STAR TREK mythos.  On the other hand, that specificity is what makes the film so thoroughly enjoyable and endearing to hard-core genre fans.  So it is reasonable to conclude that, being geeky fanboys themselves, Burnett and Altman created FREE ENTERPRISE not as a lucrative commercial venture--despite the capitalistic title--but rather as a gift to all the other geeky genre fans out there.

Hard-core genre fans will get a real kick out of watching FREE ENTERPRISE, and the DVD from Pioneer Video is a must-own for any serious collector of SF and STAR TREK films.  Although the widescreen transfer is letterbox and not anamorphic, the transfer is nonetheless beautifully crisp, the colors appear accurately balanced, and very few, if any, digital artifacts or filmic artifacts are noticeable.  And the disc is packed with cool extras, including a feature commentary from filmmakers Burnett and Altman, a making-of featurette, and the outrageous Bard-inspired rap video by William Shatner and hip hop artist Rated R.",1080604800,54,3871,5.10126582278481

The outsider sci-fi culture clashes with the aspirations of Bill, lampooning Bill.  His attitude of 'been there / done that' contrasts with those wishing to have been where nobody has been before, and most probably never will.  The plot spirals into a surreal, yet down to earth vision of Free Enterprise - no, not the starship.  The title refers to the free enterprise system of making a buck in a post-Star Trek world.

1246307,5,B00001TZ5Z,"This is mostly a dialog-driven film, laden with science-fiction in-jokes, and it will be a delight for any die-hard Trekkie or Star Wars fan.
It revolves around two someone silly and neurotic single guys who are also BIG Star Trek fans. They idolize William Shatner, while also worrying about their dysfunctional love lives. Also, one guy frets about his ""advancing"" age. (When he turns 30, will he ""renew""?)
The storyline is interesting and fun, but the real gem of the film is William Shatner. He plays ""Bill,"" a little loopy but basically good-natured fellow, who flits in and out of this movie. He's very funny. I can only say that my utmost respect goes out to a man who will mock and satirize himself to such a level. It's absolutely, screamingly hilarious! The music video at the end of the film is especially endearing. It is so mind-numbingly AWFUL, and obviously deliberately awful--I hooted all the way through it. Shatner, who sometimes has been accused of taking himself too seriously and of being too pompous, blows that all out of the water here. The man has a true sense of humor and he has no shame! What a refreshing thing--to see someone mock themselves in such a manner. Few actors would be brave enough to do the same.
This movie also has some language and a little bit of nudity and sex, so if you are sensitive to that sort of thing, (or if your saintly mom tries to watch the movie with you, like mine did) be warned. It is rated R for a reason. Small kids and saintly grey-haired moms may want to give this film a pass. But for everyone else--it's a scream! A must-see for any Star Trek and science fiction fan!",1067990400,8,1636,4.530405405405405
1246308,5,B00001TZ5Z,"As other reviewers have pointed out, this is a dialogue-driven film, and it's very funny.  The main characters are aged 30-something (in the year 1999) and grew up watching sci-fi and reading comic books.  They effortlessly quote Star Wars, Star Trek, and many more obscure shows, but have some problems with the ladies (surprise surprise!).  The plot, if there is one, centres on the character played by Weigel, who meets a girl with similar tastes (in the comic store!), and their courtship.  Basically, though, it's mostly these men hanging out in L.A. bars, trying to score, and yacking about relationships and laser discs.  At the same time, they have befriended William Shatner, but he's not quite the person they thought he'd be.....
Shatner has always been at the forefront of Trek lampoonery - witness his ""Get a Life"" sketch on Saturday Night Live.  In this film, he plays a parody of himself - he pompously informs the heroes he's planning a musical version of Julius Caesar wherein he'll play all the parts (""except Calpurnia"").  When it's pointed out that he'll have to stab himself in the back, he replies ""I've done it before!""
Even though the film was called ""Free Enterprise,"" and even though Shatner is in it, it is not a film for Trekkies only - Star Wars and Logan's Run references equal those from Trek.  Certainly, people that grew up at the same time as the characters will appreciate the more subtle jokes, but it's really quite accessible generally and fun for anyone.  Granted, there is a lot of incidental sex and alcohol consumption, which may turn off some viewers.
The DVD contains lots of extras, especially some explanations of various inside jokes, a making-of featurette, and some neat deleted scenes.",1062720000,10,1735,4.8941979522184305

It's a quirky romantic comedy built around a quirky, distinctive hook, and I suspect even the creators never dreamed it would work so well.
And the rap version of Marc Antony's speech is sheer and utter cinematic delight. Kudos to Shatner for the effort!",1057536000,5,422,4.794520547945205
1246310,4,B00001TZ5Z,"I loved this movie. Other spoofs are great, don't get me wrong; Galaxy Quest was awsome, and Trekkies was a little disturbing to be honest, but *this* movie got me where I lived. I *know* these people - I am one of them.
The 2 central characters have lives, but their lives are so intertwined with fandom that trekkisms are completely amalgamated into their world views and speech patterns. Strangely enough, they fit. It's very realistic, and intensely amusing. And the wacky hijinks that ensue after they meet Bill are worth every moment.
This is a movie for every hard core SF fan, every 30 something who was a 'geeky Trekkie loser' in high school. We are the ones who will get it. Everyone else will probably just scratch their head and wonder what's up with all the Star Wars action figures.

The only thing that I really enjoyed was the final scene which had William Shatner doing a rap/hip-hop version of Marc Antony's funeral speech from Ceaser. I enjoyed it so much I bought the soundtrack. My dislike is probablly because Im a generation behind all the characters.

It's jam packed with references to the show and to sci-fi in general, so being a fan would seem to be helpful to appreciating 90% of the film. Shatner is hilarious simply taking his over-the-top personality a bit more over-the-top. This would make a good gift for a Trekker who has a sense of humor.",1032998400,2,444,4.36144578313253
1246313,4,B00001TZ5Z,"I loved this movie-- saw it on one of the cable channels and bought it just the other day because I must share it with my other Trek-obsessed nerd-buddies.  Shatner plays himself with much humility-- making fun of your quirks is not something most Hollywood types seem very good at.  We all know the legend of Shatner, all the feuds that supposedly take place backstage, the arrogance.  We also know that the actors supposedly think Trek fans are crazily obsessed to know what episode and scene things happen in, and quiz the stars on why Kirk did this or that.  We know all about the rivalry between Old Trek (classic) and New Trek (TNG etc).  All of these details make the film a must-see for those of us obsessed enough to call ourselves Trek Fans and to hoot ""Shatner is a GOD"" even when we see him in those dopey Priceline commercials.
But there is stuff in this film you'll love even if you're not a Trek-fan. Eric McCormack's performance is great-- if you only know him from Will & Grace, you'll find him both funny & jerk-y sometimes (his character is the arrogant, faux-intellectual type who actually says ""I know people""! but who actually obsesses over getting older in a believable way, turning  what could be a caricature of a sci fi fan into a real-seeming person).
Even if you're not the type of person who has collectible merchandise lining a shelf in your house, you know someone who is, and will find the characters in this film entertaining...
The movie is about Trek fans and how their lives progress (or fail to) after meeting an idol (who turns out to be a human being who steals pick up lines and sometimes fails with women)-- but it's also about friendship, and growing up, and the way movies can sometimes change your life.",1026691200,14,1747,4.565495207667731
1246314,5,B00001TZ5Z,"A friend dragged me to a sci-fi convention where the guests of honor were the guys who wrote this movie. i have never liked Star Trek, especially the William Shatner stuff, but i watched this movie anyway. The two biggest things i learned: First, this movie is not a sci-fi movie and has nothing to do with Star Trek. They really should have changed the title. Second, this movie is absolutely awesome. i love this movie!
What's the movie about? It's semi-autobiographical in that the two stars are based on the writers, their friends are based on the writers' friends and the anecdotes are all true stories. The characters happen to be sci-fi fans, but that's not terribly important to the story. If you're into movies (sci-fi, horror, oldies, foreign flicks, etc.), you'll enjoy the references. If you hate sci-fi and old movies, you'll still love this movie because the sci-fi part is just background noise and easily ignored
The stars are two guys living in LA who work in the movie industry. They date a lot, have sex a lot, get dumped a lot and spend the whole movie wishing they could meet Ms. Right (yes, this is a relationship movie). They've idolized William Shatner since they were kids and one day actually meet him, only to learn that a)he's insane and b)he's also having relationship problems
The plot of the movie? It's all about relationships. They look at the relationships of almost every character in the movie, but the big ones are the relationship between the two best friends and between one of the friends and a girl he's met and lost
If i had to compare it to anything, i'd say it's a lot like Kevin Smith's Chasing Amy, only with a really happy ending rather than Amy's depressing one. It's also a little like 20 Dates, another movie about a guy trying to figure out why his relationships never work
i think this movie would have been a minor hit if it had been promoted more when it came out (i had never heard of it) and if they had dropped the silly name. Free Enterprise? i thought it was some kind of Trekkie movie, rather than the dialog-heavy, relationship-oriented, borderline-chick flick that it is",1026432000,7,2132,4.627968337730871
1246315,4,B00001TZ5Z,"William Shatner. The names conjurs up many things. Captain Kirk, over acting....books, TV and recently a lot of roles in major motion pictures. (Miss Conginiality, Showtime.)
This movie is a little different. He is in it but instead of a playing a real or fictional character he is playing himself. I must say he does a brilliant job of it too! With all the imitations done of him - nobody can do Shatner like Shatner.
The best part is that Bill doesn't take himself too seriously and it looks like it. As a result of this - he is having fun. In turn, the audience has fun. (He even sings again! Yikes! Raps even! Double Yikes!)
The writers and directors had orginal written this piece and a reverance to William ""Captain James T. Kirk ""Shatner, but when Shatner read it..he insisted that it be made to show his flaws and failures. That's where it works best. It shows Shatner can be scared, shy, greedy and even horny!
The supporting roles are well cast and the two main leads are great together. The chemistry is real. I think everyone had fun on this one.
The DVD extras include behind the scenes interviews, outtakes and the story behind getting this project done.
The real cool thing for me was that it was shot in a book store very close to where I live. Fun! I think the non Star Trek fan will enjoys this - but the real Star Trek fans will love all the science fiction references and dream sequences. It was cleverly done!",1023926400,4,1430,4.44106463878327

1246321,1,B00001TZ5Z,"Free Enterprise is a film about the kind of sci-fi fans that embarass sci-fi fans.  The two main characters are Robert and Mark, who respecfully are a pathetic loser and a narcissistic jerk.  Robert is a film editor who blows off work to spend time with his girlfriend.  Robert is portrayed as a man who is extremely childish who gets legitimitly upset when his girlfriend implies he likes Star Trek: TNG over classic Trek.  She, with good reason, leaves him. He descends into a depression and continues to blow off work. Now Mark is his extremely smug best friend.  Mark constantly makes obscure references to 70s sci-fi that apparantly are meant to be funny.  His dialog is designed to sound clever, simply because he references sci-fi from his childhood, but it actually has zero content.  One of Mark's extended speeches is about Logans Run meant to convey his fear of aging, it is totally incomprehensible and I've read the book and seen the movie!!!  There's another scene in a Toys R Us where Robert chews out a kid for not having seen old films like Forbidden Planet.  I don't understand how we are supposed to find these people even remotely appealing.  From time to time I've seen one of the writers, Mark Altman, on the Sci-Fi Channel.  Altman, like his movie, come off as abrassive and aggressively unpleasant things to be around.

1246323,5,B00001TZ5Z,"This is a romantic comedy centered on two Star Trek fans that now work in the film business. Robert (Rafer Weigel) is the less responsible of the two friends and spends most of his film editor's paycheck on action figures and laserdiscs. Mark (Eric McCormack) is constantly loaning Robert money and bailing him out of financial trouble. Audie England shines as Robert's love interest and seemingly perfect woman. The hook here is provided when the two ""Trekkies"" meet their idol William Shatner (playing himself). However, instead of being a god as they imagined, Shatner is a bumbling, incompetent fool who can't get a woman.
Free Enterprise is presented in a clean and clear transfer with very good sound although as a dialogue driven film that is not a major issue. I found the extras on this disc to be extremely well done and a cut above the ordinary. First is the commentary of writer/director Robert Meyer Burnett and producer/writer Mark Altman who are the inspiration for the two lead characters in this autobiographical work. The two men talk almost non-stop about their experiences as first-time independent filmmakers in a witty and fascinating manner.
Next are the deleted scenes that comprise over 30 minutes of screen time. One thing I enjoyed was that each scene is prefaced by an explanation of why the scene was deleted and the place where it would have appeared in the film. This is a great way to get inside the heads of the filmmakers and really enjoy and understand the process they went through. The deleted scenes are generally of higher quality than many I have seen and are well worth watching in their own right.
Another innovative feature is a trivia subtitle track that explains the many references in the movie. This is a real boon for those who might be unfamiliar with sci-fi and ""lets them in"" on the jokes. For myself, I got about 80% of the references the first time around but it was still great to be able to pick up what I did miss and believe me there are some subtle things here. Also included and well done are a documentary, screen tests, glossary, and the original music video with Shatner as a rap artist (believe it or not).
This is a very enjoyable film that will be sure to delight Sci-fi and Trek fans everywhere with its multitude of references to that subject matter. The actors are great, especially Shatner in his self-effacing role and Patrick Van Horn who plays a womanizing sidekick.

If you have ever thought about writing or producing science fiction of your own then I'd definitely recommend it because you will get a kick out if certain parts, don't expect Bill ""flatten-her"" Shatner to be a major star either, his role is small but sorta funny in a yikes sorta way.",975801600,2,746,4.702290076335878
1246326,5,B00001TZ5Z,"Chase Masterson recently attended the Annual Saturn Awards, forwhich ""Free Enterprise"" won Best Home Video.  Chase has asmall role in the movie, which is about 2 would-be writers inHollywood, trying to live up to their childhood expectations.  Theironly problem is that growing up, they idolized William Shatner, andreal life is not always like an episode of Star Trek.

I wasfortunate enough to see the movie on the big screen with a packedtheater at the USA Film Festival in Texas.  This movie is forTrekkies, by Trekkies.  It never makes fun of them, but does hold up amirror for us to see ourselves.  The two heroes of the movie, Mark andRobert, bump into William Shatner and of course are awe stuck, only todiscover that Shatner is not the hero they worship, but just a regularguy with regular problems like the rest of us.  ""People arepeople,"" Shatner says, and he's right.

The movie is certainlya reflection of the average male Trekker's life, getting beaten up inhigh school for wearing your Starfleet Uniform, failure with girls,job trouble, but it also shows the value of true friendship andloyalty, lessons the crew of the USS Enterprise taught use long ago. After I saw the film the first time I said to Mark Altman,""That's my life up there."" He laughed and said, ""Minetoo."" but was quick to point out that even though the characterswere named Mark and Robert, they bore little resemblence to him andDirector Robert Burnett. Uh-huh...

It's not hard to see why thisfilm won a Saturn Award.  It was made by two guys on a shoestringbudget.  They had never made a movie before, but just like thefictional Mark and Robert, they followed their dreams and saw theproject through to it's wonderful conclusion.

Its not the  best plot in the world, parts of the film are poorly timed, but I've  watched it 3 times now, and I never get tired of it. Sometimes, its ok for  a movie to just be fun.

I watched this movie in awe that there are really people out  there like me!

It's  amazing that my girlfriend and I still have arguments that almost exactly  mirror those of the characters. When I first showed her the scene of Rafer  and his girlfriend argueing, she got a chill. At one point Rafer stands up  to walk away and his girlfriend asks ""where are you going?"" To  which he states ""It looks like I'm going nowhere"". She then gets  angry and yells ""Don't quote Star Wars to me!"". It gives me  chills too. It makes me a little angry to hear Shatner on the late-night  talk show circuit blasting this film by saying ""The movie was so bad,  we were just trying to think of something to make it better"". Well I  loved it, and my girlfriend loved it too. In fact everytime I run into a  financial problem yet find money to buy DVDs, she instructs me to watch  Free Enterprise again because I haven't learned it's lesson.

The film is  basically about a group of 4 or so friends, who are science fiction  junkies.  It talks about their jobs, their girlfriends, and their obsession  with science fiction memorabilia and movies.  They bump into Shatner, who  turns out to be pretty messed up, and they discuss Shatner's obsession with  the play Julius Caesar.  Trek fans, be warned-Bill Shatner's appearance is  minimal.
This film was very needed, mostly to help people like me  understand that I'm not losing my mind.  This is a constant danger if you  quote, revel in, and fantasize about too much science fiction.  The main  characters of this film do exactly that.  And, even though they are not the  most likeable people, they are likeable enough, and reasonably complex  characters.
I loved the incessant references to various science fiction  shows and movies.  Logan's Run could possibly be the best Sci-Fi movie of  all time, and there were just about as many references to each of Logan's  Run, Star Trek, and Star Wars.  However, there are references to dozens of  other science fiction movies.

I had enjoyed the  Swingers/Clerks category of movies, and this one had Shatner . . . why  hadn't I heard about it?
As I said, it turned out to be the best way to  view it!  I had no idea what was coming, but when young Robert defeated his  hulking junior high opponent with a flying drop-kick, I had to pause the  tape to get all the laughs out before I could go on.  It was pure love from  there on in.
I quickly recommended it to everyone whose phone number I  could remember.  A close friend (with whom I have a very Robert/Mark-type  friendship) told me what features the DVD had, and there was no question at  that moment that I would be spending a good chunk of money on some A/V  equipment.  Folks, I loved the movie THAT MUCH.  It's very hard to believe  that the DVD, with so much more than VHS could ever have, costs about a  third as much.
Hardcore fans of the Original Series who feel alienated by  the current Next Generation-dominated fan culture will certainly get some  satisfaction out of this movie.  Yes, there are still some of us out  there!

While the  DVD seems to have a lot of extras, it also seems to have bugs so that it  does not play on some DVD-ROM's and DVD players, so CAVEAT EMPTOR.",950745600,3,584,4.142857142857143
1246347,5,B00001TZ5Z,"Free Enterprise is really two stories woven together.  One story is a romance about a couple of hard core sci-fi fan trying to find true love, despite the handicap their passion for sci-fi seems to be with most of the  women they meet.  The other story is about the same two hard core sci-fi  fans meeting their life-long idol, William Shatner.  This is a truly funny  movie that also works very well on several other levels.  As viewers, we  quickly are engaged by these fascinating, multi-faceted characters and the  complexities of their lives.  There is a large cast of supporting  characters and they are quirky and engaging, also.  The story is fairly  predictable but the outstanding performances by all involved, especially  Shatner, makes Free Enterprise thoroughly enjoyable.
The DVD is a  marvelous example of what the medium can do.  The video and audio are  exemplary.  The video could only be improved by being presented in an  anamorphic transfer.  What makes this DVD special, however, is the huge  variety of extras.  The story's dialogue features a constant stream of pop  culture references, most of them to sci-fi like Star Trek, Star Wars, and  Logan's Run, but also other movies, television shows and science fiction  books are referenced, as well.  Spotting these references adds a whole  different level of entertainment for fans of sci-fi.  The DVD assists by  providing a subtitle track that explains the references and a glossary of  terms.  Other extras include a very informative ""making-of""  featurette with extensive interviews with the producer and director (who  served as models for the two lead characters), an extensive selection of  deleted scenes, screen tests, and the full music video of William Shatner  and Rated R doing ""No Tears for Caesar.""  The  writer/director/editor (Robert Meyer Burnett) and the writer/producer (Mark  A. Altman) provide a fascinating and informative audio commentary track.  You will want to watch this movie at least three times, once by itself,  once with the terminology subtitles turned on, and once with the commentary  turned on.
I highly recommend this DVD.  It is an affectionate but funny  look at sci-fi fans, a highly entertaining movie, and a great DVD.",950313600,10,2233,5.120111731843576
1246348,1,B00001TZ5Z,"5 Stars Ha! Are the reviewers all friends of the directors? Sorry, I thought it was a bomb. I just thought it did not work at all. Save your money and buy some real StarTrek DVDs because there is nothing here for  StarTrek fans here. This is the last time I buy a DVD going on the reviews.  :-(

Hey I found a good review of this movie -- quote: ""A horrible, unwatchable piece of garbage"". I 100% agree.",949622400,6,403,4.075949367088608

7914751,5,B00001TZ5Z,"This is a great movie for dyed-in-the-wool sci-fi fanatics and space-fantasy geeks, as the script is inundated with Star Trek, Star Wars, Logan's Run and many, many other related allusions.  The great majority of the dialogue is hilariously, unrelentingly couched in sci-fi and space-fantasy metaphor, and the characters are pure geeks, dysfunctional children not quite grown into dysfunctional adults, fumbling relationships and life in general as their spacey childhood dreams collide with maturity and responsibility.  Shatner plays a parody of HIMSELF as the ultimate geek, which is nothing less than side-splitting at times.  I can see where the uninitiated would scowl at this film, because it requires an arcane knowledge of sci-fi and space-fantasy films and television going back decades just to appreciate the characters and to GET the humor.  But it's in there.",1522540800,,872,5.485074626865671
7914752,3,B00001TZ5Z,"It was okay if you grew up in the 1980s and you missed William Shatner for a while.  This is an interesting movie that kind of made fun of the Star Trek fans itself.  William Shatner played himself in this movie, while all other characters are movie/tv producers/writers.  Story-wise, this is a boring movie, but there is something nostalgic about this movie and convoluted that it was making fun of itself as fans of Star Trek in the 1980s.",1516147200,,441,4.556962025316456

7914758,1,B00001TZ5Z,"Unwatchable. Hateful characters just talk and talk and talk. One overlong and clumsy scene after another. Painfully bad flashbacks. Weak performances. Superficial.

I would prefer a movie that incorporates motion and favors subtlety and thoughtfulness over this aggressively bad garbage. A book or comic book recounting the tense yet plotless tale of these rude characters would not work. I can't understand why the ""story"" of disconnected events had to be told cinematically.

Amazon Prime's presentation was bizarre. It was in 4x3 but appeared sharper than standard definition video. The intended aspect ratio was 1.85:1, and the extra space above and below the characters looked odd.",1490918400,,686,5.523809523809524
7914759,5,B00001TZ5Z,"One of my favorite movies.  For a small budget production the acting is pretty good.  I like that you have ""Trekkies"" who aren't just fat nerds who live in Mom's basement.  Basically you could think of this as a forerunner to ""The Big Bang Theory"" only with no laugh track and Shatner rapping Julius Caesar.",1490400000,,307,4.545454545454546
