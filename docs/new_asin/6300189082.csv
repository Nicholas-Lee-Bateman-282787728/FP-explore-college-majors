This is an old but I hope not forgotten story; at least it has not been forgotten by me. Having seen it years ago it stuck in my movie memory ""slot"" and I have tried to find it again and again and FINALLY DID! I thought it was going to be a DVD  (my mistake, probably) but it came in post-rental, VCR form. It worked! and that's all I cared about!!!

The haunting tale (and music, also) of love, soulless,unspeakable slaughter and revenge in 1944 occupied France interplays the ""labyrinth"" ( a word used on the cover) of the avenger's old castle and the ""labyrinth"" of a mind weaving in and out of his memory and now his focused and methodical determination to seek and destroy.

He is a doctor who sends his wife and daughter, the lights of his life, to their country home where he assumes they will be safe only to later find that Nazi soldiers have moved in. His wife and daughter ( among others on the properties) are slain and his wife (probably ravaged) torched....and a heart-searing scene it is, too.
As he brings himself under control in order to find a way to workout some form of justice for his family and to find some release from his overwhelming grief ( and probably guilt) he navigates through the secret passages and rooms of the huge home and remembers an old hunting gun which he will use to slay and to survive. The Nazi's are having a gay old time whooping it up with his food, his liquor and even his old home movies. He can SEE them and they do not know anyone is there ......until the first one falls.

The English is dubbed but works. My only real complaint is that I would have liked English subtitles for the German soldiers as I think it would help in following the story more closely rather than just getting the ""gist"" of what was happening. Actually, I wish I could speak French AND German but that's another story.

Maybe not for today's action-overloaded audiences but one of the most riveting, not to be dismissed or forgotten movies of my old lifetime and I would highly recommend it. Really would like to know others thoughts about it, too.",1310947200,5,2242,4.405797101449275
224209,5,6300189082,"I watched this movie only once on TV when I was a little kid in Taiwan. I did not remember every details of the movie, but the killings were so shockingly brutal to me then that I still remember them vividly 35 years later. That's why I bought this DVD to refresh my memory. The title was translated in Taiwan as ""An Old Gun"".

To people who are desensitized by today's fast pace actions and special effects this movie will be boring. I like the main character using his wits to revenge the killing of his family on the Nazi soldiers one by one with the flashbacks of his fond memory with his family.

The DVD comes with three spoken languages: German, English, and French. It is made for the German population; so, the menu is written in German, which took me a while to get used to.  English subtitle is not provided with German and French but only for English.  Even with English spoken the English subtitle only appears when German spoken between Nazi soldiers and French spoken between French actors occasionally (very strange).  I wish the English subtitle would appear following every conversation because the English of French actors/actresses with French accent is very hard to understand sometimes.",1306627200,3,1208,4.733333333333333
224210,5,6300189082,"This wonderfull film is, strangely, hardly available in Europe. It is a famous film, it is an intriging and fascinating story. A wonderfull Romy Schneider! After this film, you can understand, the greatness and the sheer beauty of this actress. Phillipe Noiret is so convincing in his role, the script so good, no wonder this film is so highly rewarded! It probably won't be long and there will be a new, Hollywood version, with Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. But it will never beat this version.

With a sublime Romy Schneider and a touching Philippe Noiret. During the last days of WWII in France, a doctor avenges his wife and his daughter killed by the Germans.

7804915,5,6300189082,"""The Old Gun"" (1976) is Robert Enrico's most accessible movie, although he is the director who won an Oscar for the short subject, ""An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge"""" and did several other short adaptations of works by Ambrose Bierce.  Other French films he has to his credit include ""The Adventurers"" (AKA ""The Last Adventure"") starring Alain Delon, Lino Ventura and Joanna Shimkus which strikes people in different ways, but is an amazing movie even if one does not try too hard with it.  It is worth repeated viewings.  Another less successfully well-done movie was ""Le Secret"" with Phillipe Noiret and Marlene Jobert and Jean-Louis Trintignant.  ""The Old Gun"" features a standout performance by Noiret and Romy Schneider,is also lacerating in a story of the Nazis killing his entire family and his, an old gun, with an old gun, exacts revenge on them in in an uncompromising tale of revenge.  Written by Pascal Jardin and Enrico and Claude Veillot with music by Francois De Roubaux, the film certainly needed to be brought to American audiences as it has by MGM Limited Edition.  The widescreen presentation is in color and runs 102 mins.  A German blu-ray is also available, but I found this MOD edition economical and the transfer is excellent.",1464393600,3,1251,4.928571428571429

7804917,5,6300189082,"This classic film of the '70s is really amazing in its plot and acting, although it's not well known. A French surgeon (Philippe Noiret) tries to save his family sending it to an old chateau far from their resident town of Montauban while German resistance is crumbling in France in the summer of 1944 and the Nazis are in full retreat under the pressure of the Allied invasion. Romy Schneider plays the surgeon's wife and she is really wonderful. Alas the family survival plan goes terribly wrong and the peace loving ageing doctor is transformed into a merciless avenger stalking the SS soldiers inside the chateau and exterminating them one by one with an old shotgun he used as a child while hunting with his father (thus the original title ""Le vieux fusil""), but also with the older weapon man has invented: fire, in the form of a German flamethrower. The film won the 1976 Csar Award for Best Film, Best Actor and Best Music and was also nominated for best director, supporting actor, writing, cinematography, editing and sound. It features some unforgettable scenes, never repeated in other movies before or since. Well worth watching!",1451520000,,1142,4.861538461538461

7804922,5,6300189082,"This French-German production is inspired on a tragic episode at the last year of the WW2, better known as Oradour sur Glane killing.

One of the most versatile actors the world had ever known, the alluring unforgettable and talented Rommy Schneider, plus the agile direction of Robert Enrico made of this movie one the most famous and well reminded artistic gems of the French cinema during the middle seventies.

Winner of three Cesar awards, for Best Film, Best Actor (Philippe Noiret) and Best Music. He received the 1985 Cesar Award for Csars only given twice - at this movie, and Cyrano de Bergerac.

So with all these laurels would dare you to give up not having in his valuable collection?",1314316800,3,2223,5.0353260869565215
