8231352,4,B000RNMBS4,"Recca Hanabishi is a massive ninjaphile -- which isn't surprising, since he seems to be from a past era himself.

Based on Kentaro Yabuki's longrunning manga ""Flame of Recca,"" this solid little anime series is a heady little shonen story, with countless fiery duels and strange ninja artifacts. The storyline and writing are pretty well done, although the second half is overshadowed by a constant string of one-on-one fights.

Recca is badly hurt rescuing his sweet-natured classmate Yanagi -- only to be miraculously healed when his ""princess"" touches him. Impressed by her kindness and special power, Recca pledges to be her personal ninja.

But then a shadowy woman named Kagehoshi appears, and attacks them both in an effort to make Recca show his ""fire"" -- and when she tries to kill Yanagi, flames appear on Recca's hand. She further enrages Recca by manipulating his classmates -- tomboyish Fuko and icy swordsman Tokiya -- into attacking him with their ninja ""madogus,"" but then a mysterious pair of thugs kidnap Yanagi.

To get her back, Recca, Fuko, Tokiya and lug-with-a-heart-of-gold must infiltrate a vast mansion and fight an escalating string of madogu bearers. Unfortunately the most deadly is Kurei, a masked man who reveals a secret connection to Recca. And after that, as the group begins training to become stronger, Kurei invites them to the Underground Death Tournament.

There, the four teenagers must triumph in the tournament to keep Yanagi from going to Kurei. They're forced to fight a series of other teams whose madogus control paper, hair, flesh, size, a beast-man, plant matter, sound, and many other things. Even worse, most of the teams are on Kurei's payroll. But Recca and his friends refuse to be beat -- and Recca's right arm holds an ever-expanding power that may give him victory...

The biggest problem with ""Flame of Recca"" is that it starts chugging along nicely for the plot-heavy first third, slows down somewhat into the Death Tournament's sequential fights, and then.... stops. It doesn't even come close to finishing Kentaro Yabuki's storyline, and it doesn't really get a conclusion of its own. It just stops.

But it's a fun ride up until then -- loads of action involving increasingly sinister madogus, and some fire duels with very unexpected combatants. Even in the less violent episodes, we get glimpses of terrible things like Tokiya's tragic, bloody past, or the ghastly fate of the Hokage ninja. And the last two thirds are a string of dramatic fights between various teams, with plenty of flashy ninja magic and the occasional dirty trick (such as a trap door leading to a drowning pit) by Kurei's loyal goons.

Fortunately things are somewhat lightened by But it's worth noting that the animation is not that great -- hair and faces often shift and grow, and some of the hand-to-hand fights are awkward. And the voice actors range from brilliant (Domon, Tokiya) to nails-on-chalkboard annoying (Kaoru Koganei).

What keeps this interesting is Recca himself -- he's a likable kid with a big heart and a short fuse, who learns greater wisdom as he starts unlocking his new fire powers. Yanagi is a suitably sweet love interestung, but feisty Fuko and the big-ugly-punk-with-a-heart-of-gold Doman are nice counterpoints to Recca. And haughty, beautiful Tokiya is Recca's complete opposite in every way, but his tragic past and fondness for Yanagi keep him from being too unlikeable.

And since every series needs a Big Bad Guy, we have a crazy-eyed megamogul and the slightly insane, masked Kurei (""This is getting kinda fun,"" he chuckles as Recca sets of fireworks). Most of his goons aren't very likable, but a few are such as the chirrupy boy-warrior Kaoru, or the melancholy ninja Raiha.

Though the plot grinds to a halt in favor of one-on-one fights, ""Flame of Recca"" is a solid action anime with some surprising twists. Definitely worth seeing.",1234224000,,3907,5.03250773993808
