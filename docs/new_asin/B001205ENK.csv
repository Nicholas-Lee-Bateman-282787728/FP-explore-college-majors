It's the next best thing to having a friend come over and teach you. As a matter of fact, that's exactly what it feels like. Very useful.",1455753600,2,304,4.62962962962963

8243252,5,B001205ENK,"If you watch this video, you'll quickly realize that quilting & quilting frames have become both absurdly complicated & expensive. Joe shows, in detail, how to construct the legs to support an old fashioned 4-stick C-clamp frame. Total cost? Maybe $50. Last year I spent $60 because I opted for hardwood ""sticks"". No rolling on this pole then that pole & etc. Pin the backing then the batting & quilt top & you're good to go. No basting. I mounted a 90"" square, alone in under 2 hrs, SITTING, with frequent stops to review the video. What size quilt? Any size that lumber comes in. Try & find a commercial frame, at any price, that will truly accomodate a king size, 120"" square, quilt.

The video continues on to cover mounting a quilt & using the frame. Very detailed & easy to follow. At the end Joe demonstrates how HE hand quilts the stitch & knotless starts & stops.

There's gotta be a downside, right? To use this frame for hand quilting you need room. A lot of room at least to start. That 120"" square quilt is going to take up a 10' square plus walking around room. Eventually it will shrink as work progresses.

However, even if you don't have the room for a frame this size to be permanently set up, you can use it for basting. Move the furniture to the walls, set up the frame, SIT down & baste. Even a king size quilt can be hand basted in a couple of hours. No more ridiculous crawling around the floor, or hanging on a wall, or breathing unhealthy fumes by using an aerosol adhesive. When you're done, take it apart, re-position the furniture, & you're ready to quilt in a hoop or on a machine. I can imagine sitting under a tree on a beautiful day basting away. JC also includes basting instructions.

As always, Joe The Quilter is entertaining & somehow soothing. I also appreciate the references to quilting as a ""folk technology"". Recognizing there are many ways to quilt none more valid than another. Quite a relief from most current day rules based instructions.",1346284800,9,1984,4.487534626038781
