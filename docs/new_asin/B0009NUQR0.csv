2302937,3,B0009NUQR0,I bought this and other workout videos for my mother per her request and as far as I know they are collecting dust!,1365897600,,115,4.043478260869565

2302939,5,B0009NUQR0,"I don't like most aerobic workouts - e.g. machines (I've been through the gamut: rower, ski track, stationery bike, and others I can't remember).  As I've heard from many other people, after a few weeks or months they become coat racks, things on which to hang towels to dry and other useful but very expensive pieces of equipment.  The problem is boredom.  What I like abut the tape is that it is fun, and has varied movements, and being 61 years old, the era of the music, and the fact that it is live, is a real bonus. I don't admit this to just anyone (at least with my real identity) but i love Richard Simmons.  Although I find him annoying at times, I also find him funny. I like his spirit of encouragement. I believe he is sincere in his desire to help people.  Another aspect of his workout tapes I like is that the class is populated with regular people, i.e., people of all sizes.  This eliminates the usual tendency I have towards comparing myself, unfavorably of course, to the perfect bodies I see on other exercise programs. When I do this workout, I sweat a lot, have fun, and i know my heart and legs in particular have worked hard. That's my goal, and it gives me a good feeling to boot.",1314576000,,1206,4.337777777777778
2302940,5,B0009NUQR0,While many exercise fads have come and gone I find this workout quite invigorating and fun as well. I highly recommend this workout which lives up to its name and is an enjoyable way to get in shape or stay in shape.,1257120000,,216,4.166666666666667
2302941,5,B0009NUQR0,"I am 72 years old and had triple By-pass surgery two years ago. It is a matter of life and death for me to exercise at least 30 minutes each day. I have always hated exercise and that's probably why I had a heart problem.  I grew up to fifties music and Richard Simmons plus the music make my exercise time a blast.  I have all four of the ""Sweatin To The Oldies"" videos and never get bored with them. Today I was having so much fun that I put a second video in and exercised for over an hour. Now that's amazing for someone who has been a couch potato for most of his adult life. If you are over 65 and inactive buy them, you'll be glad you did.",1250035200,2,646,3.9236641221374047

8063643,5,B0009NUQR0,Love it......this is best one besides Sweating Two and the fat is going to hate YOU!!!,1411516800,,86,4.4375
8063644,1,B0009NUQR0,"Richard Simmons has more energy than a child after Halloween candy!  If you need ""upbeat"" to exercise, with the energy & enthusiasm, he fills the bill.
However, unless you're highly coordinated & find learning dance steps easy, this is NOT a tape to follow!  Even before the Warm-up, the music & his moves are very fast!  What subtle ""cues"" he gives to the next move is useless because by the time you shift, they're already into another move!  I had his 1st over a decade ago & used it a lot, but now they seem to get jazzier & fancier--too much for me.",1384041600,,554,4.349514563106796

8063647,4,B0009NUQR0,"I have Sweatin to the Oldies 2, 3, and 4.  I have not seen video #1.  I purchased #2 years ago and did it a while then stored it away.  When I retired, I got the tape out and decided to give it another go as I had plenty of free time. After a few months of working out with #2, I decided I needed to move up.  I purchased #3 and #4.  I immediately loved the music in video #3.  The dance moves are fast paced, and it took me a while to learn them. I would rewind over and over until I got them down.  I did try video #4 a couple of times, but don't think I'm quite ready for that one yet.  The music in #4 just doesn't motivate me like the music in the #3 video.  By the way . . . I have lost 20 lbs. over a time period of about 9 months.  I was walking 3 miles a day, but was not seeing any benefit. These exercises got the weight off.",1369008000,,836,3.6201117318435756
