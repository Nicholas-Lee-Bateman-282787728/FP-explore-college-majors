8128824,3,B000G2O8CI,This book is small but has pretty good information. I've had a hamstring issue for 2 years and have not been able to run. I think this will finally get me started again.,1355702400,,169,4.151515151515151
8128825,5,B000G2O8CI,"Even though the title is The Injured Runner, the great stretches would be great for all athletes. Right now, I am indeed an injured runner. This dvd is really great and perfect for me. I honestly haven't done much yet. I would suggest having either the aerobic step or something firm for the calf stretches in Level 1 to get the optimal stretch.  I started the stretching section which is also excellent but stopped when the calf stretches were on a slant wedge for optimal stretch. I am going to physical therapy for my hamstring tendonitis and this slant is used as part of my treatment there. The instruction is giving my a physical therapist with very clear detail and instruction to help with the stretches. When I had 2 questions, Bryan immediately emailed me with suggestions (like for the step, anything 4"" off the ground and sturdy can be used. For the wedge, a sturdy cutting board against a cabinet. He gives excellent and immediate customer service.)
Core stabilization is so impoprtant so the section on this is valuable.
This dvd is a fabulous bargain;
The foundation - principles of core stabilization and balance training is 13 minutes'Level 1 - exercise for recovery following an injury and injury prevention - working each muscle group from foot to the abdomen is 37 minutes
Level 2 is advanced exercises for complete recovery and performance enhancement usesing weights and resistance bands is 1 minutes.
There is a 6 minute warmup'The stretching section has 26 stretches - 38 minutes.
This is an excellent stretching dvd.",1321488000,,1541,4.8816793893129775
8128826,5,B000G2O8CI,"I recently received The Injured Runner DVD and plan to continue using it for injury prevention.  I am a 'maturing' runner who hopes to continue running for a many years. I have had an ITB injury as well as a stress fracture and this DVD is exactly what I need to help me do the stretches and exercises necessary if I want to continue to run injury free.

  The introduction (Principles of core stablization and balance training) is thorough and after the first viewing I felt comfortable moving on to directly complete the Level 1 exercises.  The recommendation-to keep a remote handy in order to skip through the background information- was good and doing that I can complete Level 1 in a short time period (approximately 35 minutes.)

  The exercises are very basic, uncomplicated movements requiring very little space or equiptment.  The slow and focused movements as well as the number of repetitions make it  very effective and I have been pleasantly sore after my workouts.  I tend to rush through exercises and the DVD has really helped me to pace myself effectively in order to get a much better workout!

  There are 26 stretches modeled and I look forward to learning  more as I focus on different areas. I really like that I have the ability to pick and choose which stretches from a master list so that I can customize a program that is right for me.

  My husband and I plan to use the programs and stretches weekly and I would recommend this DVD for any runner who wants to stay healthy and running.",1153008000,10,1513,4.602996254681648
