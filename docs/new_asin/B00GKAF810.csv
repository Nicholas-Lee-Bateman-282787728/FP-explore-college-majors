I love that it includes the biographies aswell it's very informative if your a true fan of boxing then u should buy it. I look foward to the Holyfield, sugar ray leonard and Robinson DVD sets but please if you can make a joe Louis and tommy hearns DVD set I'd b stoked thankz again!!!",1439078400,2,433,4.2926829268292686
