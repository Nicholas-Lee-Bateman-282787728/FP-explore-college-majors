2378018,5,B000A7LR6Y,"It's All Gone Pete Tong was realeased theatrically in the US starting April 14, 2005, and for some reason it never found much of an audience, though everyone seemed to have heard of it. I suspect that it's because the majority of the people who will most enjoy this film are not generally theater-goers and prefer watching movies at home. That said, however, everyone I know who did see the film in the theater couldn't stop raving about it.

I can't wait to see this film again once it's on DVD. I saw it three times in the theater already and totally loved it - I couldn't stop raving about it to everyone I know and taking people to see it!

And Paul Kaye and Mike Wilmot deserve tons of award recognition for thier performances in this movie, come the season.

I hope this movie willl not continue to be overlooked!!!",1121731200,13,821,4.423841059602649
2378019,5,B000A7LR6Y,"On the surface, ""It's All Gone Pete Tong"" is simply another Go / Groove / 24 Hour Party people that lends itself to sophomoric and often visually disgusting humor. However, in the spirit of The Family Guy and The Simpsons, the movie is more than meets the eye. The film is told as a biopic of the European ""King of Ibiza"" DJ Frankie Wilde (Paul Kaye), a man who has risen from obscurity to booze and drug fueled DJ sets on the party island of Ibiza. Frankie has everything: the fans, the trophy wife, the villa. But, what Frankie doesn't know is that his ears are failing him, and every drink and line that he takes brings him closer and closer to losing it all. For the first 30 minutes, the movie presents Frankie as the obnoxious partier who deserves little or no sympathy for his hardships. Even Frankie's manager, the egotistical Max Haggar (Mike Wilmot), has little tolerances for Frankie's mischief. The movie suddenly turns dark as Frankie loses his hearing and loses everything that is dear to him. He's abandoned, and at this point, the viewer has to decide whether we care. The director, Michael Dowse, does a fine job of quickly making the audience empathize for this character as he struggles to overcome (and eventually embrace) his deafness and try to resurrect his career and his life. Paul Kaye is wonderful as the tortured hero. Mike Wilmot does what few actors do: make us despise his character. The soundtrack is incredible, from the Beach Boys to house music to classical. The cinematography is beautiful.",1121644800,5,1526,4.719101123595506
2378020,4,B000A7LR6Y,"It's All Gone Pete Tong is not about Pete Tong(one of the giants interviewed in this film), but it's about the ups and downs of an internationally succussful DJ named Frankie Wilde, whose life both personally and professionally had gone ""pete tong"" completely when he became deaf at the top of his game. This docu-biopic chronicles the heydays, fastlane lifestyle, and self-destructive times of Frankie Wilde, and to reinventing and reviving his passion and ability as a deaf DJ. It's a great film about one man's journey to spiritual and emotional rebirth at the most hopeless times of life.

Paul Kaye delivered a very captivating performance as Frankie, and his character had to endure quite a rollercoaster ride. When he became almost totally deaf at the top of his career, he started to lose a grip of himself, and behaved like a madman at one of his gigs in a club. He was told by the doctor that he was not to expose his ear to anymore loud noise or he would go deaf completely. When he insisted on producing a new album with the assist of hearing aid, an accident occurred and rendered him totally deaf. His wife Sonja(Kate Magowan) abandoned him, left him devastated, and he fell into a dark hole of cacaine and alcohol abuse. He spent months ""killing"" himself, until one day he finally pulled himself together for a new beginning.

He meets Penelope(Beatriz Batarda),a speech therapist for the deaf, and they soon became lovers. He eventually learned how to use his feet as a substitute to sense the sounds, and combining with the computer technology, he managed to mix a phenomenon comeback album that took the club scene by storm. His comeback success as a deaf DJ was an overwhelming experience for him and Penelope, and they mysteriously vanished from the music scene.

The film has footage of numerous interiews on various industry pros and they shared their inputs on the life and times of Frankie Wilde. This film is quite funny and entertaining, and it's more worthwhile for clubbing fans.",1119916800,4,2007,4.794797687861272
2378021,3,B000A7LR6Y,"Two topics of conversation arise immediately from this movie festival darling: the facts that Frankie Wilde is not an actual person, while Pete Tong (Cockney for ""gone wrong"") is real; and the brilliant performance of Paul Kaye as that ""giant among geniuses"", DJ Frankie Wilde. Kaye gives a very, very good performance. Director Michael Dowse has shot a good little movie on digital, with real artistic feel.

It's a small movie, and will stay a small movie, is my bet. I don't think it's going to catch on as some kind of general audience ""sleeper"" hit, except among those who find the DJ club scene wildly entertaining; the movie is too raw and too audience-specific. It certainly makes a mountain of the ""mockumentary"" film, although instead of a ""molehill"", there's a ""coke badger hill"", the largest amount of cocaine I've ever seen depicted for one individual's use in a film.

The first part of the film is an amazing portrait of someone functioning on some animal level, out of his head on drugs, alcohol, the music club scene, and fast-lane living, without benefit of connection to his rational brain. It wasn't, for me, a pretty picture of that scene, although set in beautiful Ibiza, Spain. Wilde is wildly successful, but toxed to the max. Too much hard living and hard music, plus a congenital predisposition, render him deaf.

However, if only as a set up for one of the funniest politically incorrect one-liners in film, every bit of that first half was worth it.

The second half of the movie, which has been described by other critics who liked the hardness of the first half as ""too soft"", was the far more contemplative part of the movie. Freddie rages and rebels against his deafness, retreats into despair, then cleans up, hoists himself up and off to a speech therapist, and begins to listen for some resonance in his life. The tabloid reports contrasted with scenes of his life as he makes his comeback are hilarious.

I hope that a soundtrack will be released in the US, despite initial reports to the contrary. (If you liked this movie, I highly recommend ""Rory O'Shea Was Here"", alternatively titled ""Inside I'm Dancing"", a better movie, soon out on DVD.) Overall, I liked ""It's All Gone"", but wasn't ""blown away"". Much of our preview audience was pretty enthusiastic afterward. Somewhere between a B- and a C+.",1115942400,3,2336,4.800995024875622

2378101,5,B000A7LR6Y,"I got this for my sister who LOVES this movie. She generously let me preview it before I gave to her as a present. It's an enjoyable movie, for sure. It's feel good but not in the usual Hollywood fake feel good style. Still as far as being unbalanced by too many drugs and alcohol it's pretty tame. I prefer Terry Gilliam's take on medicinal imbalance. The main actor plays his part convincingly. The movie has a very even plot tempo. At first I thought that the hallucination was cheap and they could have done better with animation or CGI. Once the film completed I understood why they went with the cheesy outfit.
This is not a movie you should show kids. Too young they'll think it's a puzzling comedy, too old and they'll possibly think it's a drug glorifying mess. It's good enough that I went and looked it up to see who it was based on. I think you'll like it unless you're one of those humorless religious people.",1323216000,,922,4.39766081871345

We watched it together the other night and I must say that he was right.  I am not a DJ, but love music and dancing.  My boyfriend is a DJ, so could relate to the main character.  I loved the storyline, and the ending of the movie.  The main actor did such a fabulous job in making us believe in his character, from his coked out binges, to his recovery, and finding meaning in music again.  Highly recommend.",1294272000,,581,4.043859649122807
2378103,5,B000A7LR6Y,"This movie is funny, dramatic, sexy but most of all, inspirational. For anyone who is familar with Trance/House music, this is a great mockumentry based around DJ Sammy. Most Americans are even familar with DJ Sammy, so this is even a great movie for one who may not be particularlly interested in techno music. The movie opens with interviews from electronic music greats such as Tiesto, Paul van Dyk and more.
Most of the movie takes place in Ibiza, the Mecca for House/Trance music. For anyone who has never been to Ibiza, there is a great inside view of the these world famous clubs located in Ibiza (the real life, modern-day Studio 54).  A great sound track goes naturally with this movie. Coping with his hardcore drug problem, the main character is also going def. What does a world famous DJ do with his life when he can no longer hear, lose all his fame, lose his family and all love for life? He makes a #1 selling album, whats what he does.
Some of the best ""one-liners"" in any movie I've seen. You've got to watch this movie, it is so inspirational that when the movie ends, you will feel like you can do anything in the world you put your mind and heart into.",1292544000,,1173,4.430555555555555
2378104,4,B000A7LR6Y,"""It's all gone Pete Tong"" is a derogatory statement meant to criticize electronica and modern dance music.  Here it's used as a double meaning for someone also encountering a frightening, nightmarish disability that directly affects his craft (add the comma).  It falls somewhat short in representing real club/EDM culture and the tranced quality of ""the moment"" in a big venue.  It never quite draws you into the intoxicating vibe that removes the perception of time, leaving just the combined mood of the audience and the sound system.  At 90 minutes or so it's perhaps too short, with club scenes that were shot with too much light and limited music selections until the credits.  Oddly enough, Blade and Code 46 have more ""truthful"" club sequences... uh, sans the vampire frenzy, of course.

While the film is clearly not directed by someone who cares much about the music, the skill/knowledge set, or the culture, particularly with the ridiculous, over-the-top club sequences, heads bopping in the car like an SNL skit, awful generic music made into a music video early on, and the very simplistic & continuity-problems-riddled mixing scenes... I found it hilarious, touching, and beautifully photographed.  This in spite of its flaws.  As a mockumentary it pulls it off well enough, in no small part due to a fantastic cast and sharp dialog.  I'll admit the Austrian's lyrics were embarrassingly representative of much of the lesser music out there.  Paul Kaye's agent and the record label exec have equally remarkable comic timing to him.  I can't really think of a single performance that didn't fit just right.

The future is big, and it's disabled.",1286668800,,1658,5.055147058823529
2378105,1,B000A7LR6Y,"i had heard good things about this film so rented and watched it. i thought it was a total waste. every cliche from vh1 behind the music rock star biographies is here, only w/ the tiny transposition to the DJ/rave world: the huge star with fame and fortune. the subsequent over-indulgence in loud music, sex and drugs. the fall from grace. and then, you guessed it, the redemption! aided of course by the new woman who appears in his life to right his course, gorgeous naturally, and coincidentally - available.

there's 3 or 4 good laughs in the film, tops - hardly making it a worthwhile watch. i strongly recommend skipping this one.",1271462400,2,636,4.628318584070796

Instead of just the typical drugs, music, sex, etc that you expect in a clubbing movie it actually delivers an uplifting story of someone who hits rocks bottom and then lifts themself out of the darkness. Whenever I feel down and blue I can just watch this movie and it makes my day just like I first time I watched it.

2378110,3,B000A7LR6Y,"It's All Gone Pete Tong certainly is an unusual title for a movie; and that's certainly one of the reasons I chose to watch and review this film. We get a mock biopic of a young DJ on the Spanish island of Ibiza. Frankie Wilde (Paul Kaye) is a DJ who lives for the club scene where he is a prominent, wildly successful DJ--and surrounds himself with friends who only like him when things are going his way. Yep, he gets married to a model who works with him in one of his music videos and they adopt a son; but his happiness and the wild ride of fame only lasts so long.

Things change radically for Frankie when he goes deaf after too much loud music in night clubs and a wild lifestyle that his doctor tells him didn't exactly help, either. Frankie's so-called friends rapidly abandon him; even his wife supermodel wife Sonja (Kate Magowan) and their son leave him for one of Frankie's friends! The record companies and the discos soon abandon him also because, after all, when you're deaf you just might not stay on top of the heap as a hot, hot, hot DJ.

Frankie slips into total despair and fantasizes about being chased by a bear in a apron when he is on one of his countless drug trips; and it is only when he thinks to learn to read lips does the possibility of making a comeback seem real to Frankie. With the help of a woman who works at a lip reading school for the deaf (Penelope, played by Beatriz Batarda), Frankie regains his ability to be a top notch, in demand DJ once more.

Questions remain, though--will Frankie want this lifestyle back? What happens to him and Penelope--or will Sonja come back to him once again now that can make tons of money? No plot spoilers here, folks--but there's an ending that I admit did make me smile.

To its credit, the movie uses real life DJs and people in the business to make the pretend biopic as realistic as possible. However, although this film purports to be a comedy, I just didn't laugh that much when I saw it. It's not really all that funny except for a few chuckles here and there; and the disability issue Frankie copes with detracts from any true comedy that they may have tried to produce.

There are a few extras but the best is the ""making of"" featurette.

Overall, It's All Gone Pete Tong is a movie you can watch when nothing better is on TV. No, it's certainly NOT the worst flick I've ever seen; but it just didn't strike me as being that funny. The acting is just OK and the cinematography was average. Save this one for a rainy day when you're bored with nothing else better to do. It's just average, folks!",1227571200,2,2583,4.337474120082816
2378126,4,B000A7LR6Y,"I did love the story, and overall the entire production of this movie. With the exception of the audio. So I had to ding it down to 4 stars.

When I went into the audio setup to find it had only basic Dolby 5.1 Surround I was surprised. Half way through the movie I was desperately wishing that this movie with a story with such a large emphasis on sound and music would have something better to offer such as Dolby TrueHD or DTS-HD Master Audio.

I certainly don't find myself wanting HD audio on every movie I watch, but this movie would have been so much better with it.",1223424000,,573,4.2
2378127,5,B000A7LR6Y,This movie is a great movie if you are into the whole Rave culture but also if you just like music.

2378128,4,B000A7LR6Y,"I was actually able to find DVD of this movie in my local library.  It is a story about DJ who at the peak of his successful career turns deaf.  Typical things happen shortly thereafter:  his wife leaves him, his friends bail out, drug dealers swarm to feed him coke in his moments of personal weakness, the music industry executives do their best to write him off and move on to the next DJ guy.  While the documentary style of the movie was boring for the first half of the movie, the second half is the best.  It is filled with comedic moments about what is means to be deaf and adjust to the new environment by a person who was not born with such disability.  But the end is all too predictable and sappy as our main character Framkie Wilde falls in love with a deaf girl, they have a child together and after ovecoming his disability in the most unusual and unique way they both elope in the world of ordinary, anonymous people.  This is not a traditional ""ovecoming - the - life -of - hardships"" kind of movie, it is raw and sincere.  But as I said it's main weakness is that it is produced as a form of documentary, which sort of makes it boring.  It is almost like listening thru narations thru a half of the movie.  The actor portraying Frankie Wilde was great.  I never saw him in any movies before, but this guy can act....",1214784000,,1334,4.253968253968254
2378129,4,B000A7LR6Y,"OK, this contains no spoilers.

It is a fictional film about a superstar DJ, who like many others from the UK, plays nightclubs in Ibiza during the summer.  It shows what happens to him as a result of his lifestyle.

Mainly a drama, with some humour.

It is an uplifting film, and a believable one, capturing the Ibiza culture well.

I recommend it to all who regularly go clubbing or to gigs, to whatever genre of music, or anyone who is in a band.",1213747200,,449,4.2976190476190474
2378130,4,B000A7LR6Y,"The cover markets this film as a mockumentary.  While I've enjoyed films that use the format, I've grown tired of it over the years - with filmakers insistent on making a work of fiction seem not only plausible, but real.  The fun of this film is that it blends the format with some fun scenes of comedy and drama.

The first of act of the film shows Frankie Wilde's fall from stardom.  He is a popular DJ who has succumbed to all the pitfalls of fame: sex, drugs and overall excess.  These would be the signs of any star's downfall.  Frankie falls a bit further though once he loses his hearing.  While some if it is shown, we can only guess how bad it got when we see a long haired Frankie in a filth filled room filling himself full of drugs.  Interspersed we see talking heads being interviewed about Wilde's rise and fall.  There's also a giant bear that occaisonally comes and tries to attack Frankie.  The image of the bear stands for something, but I'll let the viewer figure that out.

The drug and depressed filled first act meanders a little bit, with familiar fall from fame montages.  But whatever's lacking there is totally made up for in the film's harrowing second act.  Frankie befriends a deaf girl and tries to somehow find a way for his life to be filled with music.  Sounds pretentious?  This film makes it so believable that you can't help but cheer on Frankie during his plight.  What I really loved was the remarkable shift in tone from the first part of the film.  Frankie sinks deep.  That the filmakers are able to recover our protagonist with such vigor is amazing.

Besides a great story, the film also boasts a great soundtrack, from the dance music of the many DJs featured in the film, to the Beach Boys' classic Good Vibrations, music plays a prominent role and is something of a character unto itself.

There is one seen in the film which is almost the MOST disturbing 2 minutes I have seen in a long time. This movie is what you and I wait for all year. My favourite scene in the film involves the central character (F.W) and the time he discovers his own worthlessness without ears. Massively inspiring. The kind of film one quotes.

Besides just having a great story line and premise, the direction is great, the use of music and sound creates lasting emotion. The way they edit the sound to toggle between Frank's deafness and what is just normally happening from scene to scene is so well done that you'd have to concentrate on how they do it to understand it, because it flows so seemlessly and naturally to let the viewer feel what he's going through. This movie is funny, dramatic, original and so well made in every aspect that I would recommend it to everyone. Own this movie and pass it on- people will thank you.",1162684800,,749,4.474452554744525
2378135,5,B000A7LR6Y,"Consumers love IRONY!  I can sum up this film in one sentence: DJing, drugs, hummus and sex...silence...newfound appreciation for life.  What makes this film great is not the fact that Frankie Wilde does drugs, rather, its HOW he does drugs (see it and you'll understand what I mean).  Same thing with his DJing.  The fact that he DJs is well-and-good, but you have to see HOW he DJs (pre- and post-deaf).  Frankie is a special character and Paul Kaye nails this role (as he says in the DVD extras, ""God, I've waited a long time for this job."").  Speaking of DVD extras...WATCH THEM.  Frankie the spokesmodel for Oman Whiskey, Frankie on a cooking show, Frankie on an interview with a news anchor, Frankie's Rabbi (played by Paul Kaye), among other gimmicks...classic.  In regards to credentials...WINNER GEN ART FILM FESTIVAL, WINNER U.S. COMEDY ARTS FESTIVAL, WINNER TORONTO FILM FESTIVAL.  And the soundtrack...exceptional club music.  Particularly, Reflekt's ""Need to Feel Loved"" (Seb Fontaine & Jay P Remix).  I guarantee you will RE-WATCH this film over and over again.  Maybe you'll even take a step back and have a look at your own life?

Note: THIS FILM IS A WORK OF FICTION.  IT IS A ""MOCK""UMENTARY.  DON'T BE FOOLED.  The fact that the directors and actors deliver such a compelling final product, where consumers actually believe it is real, is testament alone that this film is a keeper.

Please feel free to disagree with my opinion; let us compare opinions, invite a few more points of view, and debate, like the humans we are.",1160006400,2,1542,4.846743295019157
2378156,4,B000A7LR6Y,"I've watched this movie twice.  The first time I believed the first frame of film which reads something like ""This film is based on a true story"", something like that.  It was hard to watch for me because it brings out a lot of emotions.  I sometimes didn't know if I should laugh or feel bad about the guy's situation.  Then I read these reviews here on Amazon and saw that someone compared it to Spinal Tap and that it actually is not true at all.  I watched it a second time and for some reason knowing that it was not true it really allowed me to just laugh and I did that much more than the first time.  The tennis scene with the humus was hilarious and really remined me of Spinal Tap.  If you like Spinal Tap you should like this, although this is a lot darker.  Just remember that it isn't true.",1149897600,,803,4.135483870967742
2378157,3,B000A7LR6Y,"A wildly uneven (is it a satiric comedy or a 12-step drama?) but curiously involving ""mockumentary"" about a fictional Fatboy Slim type DJ superstar whose self-destructive tendencies are brought to the fore when he realizes he is going completely and utterly deaf. Star Paul Kaye gives a sometimes irritating (but never boring) performance as the lead character. Movie plays like an oddball cross between the 1974 rise-and-fall-of-a-rock-star-film ""Stardust"" (or perhaps an episode of VH-1's ""Behind The Music"") and ""Children Of A Lesser God"". If you can make it past the first 45 minutes (which consists mostly of gross and repetitive scenes of excessive substance abuse accompanied by unintelligible zonked-out proclamations by our runny-nosed leading man) you may be intrigued by the 180 degree turn in the film's tone, as it suddenly becomes an almost sweet tale of unconditional love and redemption. In the hands of a more accomplished director, I suspect this transition would have been handled in a more subtle fashion (if you forgive my analogy, what we get stuck with is equivalent to a bad segue). The most ironic thing about ""Pete Tong"" is that it is so beautifully photographed (in wildly saturated primary colors)-in stark contrast to its largely ugly and dark subject matter. Fans of the rave/techno club scene will probably be more tolerant of the film's excesses (and its backstage drama cliches) more than the casual viewer. The film is somewhat redeemed by its energy and engaging lead performances.",1146528000,3,1516,5.217213114754099

2378159,5,B000A7LR6Y,"There isn't too much left to say about this movie that hasn't already been written in previous reviews.  Having any type of involvement in the electronic dance music (edm) scene will help you understand the basis of the film but it is not a prerequisite for grasping the main idea.  The movies starts by actually mocking the status of superstar dj's in the edm/club/rave scene.  The main character is extremely arrogant and egotistical, but that doesn't change the fact that he is one of the most amazing dj's the world has ever scene.  When he loses his hearing, you really start to empathize with the character, who by the way is played brilliantly by Paul Kaye.  I found myself asking:  Could I do my job if I lost the main things I needed to do it?  Could I even move on with my life enough to get to that point?  Could anyone?  Frankie is a character that you will probably dislike at the beginning of the film, but at the end you will be cheering for him.  The mockumentary really seems like a true story, especially with the brief interviews of some of the world's most famous dj's such as Paul Van Dyke, Tiesto, and Carl Cox saying how great the man's dj'ing is.  This is supposed to be a comedy, but it is a rather tragic one at that.  There are parts you will laugh at, and parts that will make you want to cry.  At the end of the movie though, your perspective on humanity will be altered, and that's what makes for truly great art.",1137110400,6,1443,4.33955223880597
2378160,5,B000A7LR6Y,"It's All Gone Pete Tong is really a rather extraordinary motion picture that has all the earmarks of a cult indie sensation.  I guess we should cover a couple of things right off the bat, however.  Who is Pete Tong, you ask?  Well, he's a DJ, and he is in this movie - but only for a few moments.  You see, this movie isn't about Pete Tong at all.  It is actually about Frankie Wilde, a wildly successful DJ (and I mean DJ as in music-mixing genius and not ""and that was the latest hit from so-and-so, and it's 52 degrees here at 5:00 on a busy traffic day"" radio voice) who overcame the tragedy of deafness to make a huge and mysterious comeback.  These movie fellows do a great job of making this mockumentary appear to be a real-life biopic, but Frankie Wilde and his incredible story are purely fictional.  That fact doesn't really change anything, though, as this is still an inspirational film that will surely captivate you.

It's an oddly powerful story built around a less than likeable fellow who eventually wins you over with his intense suffering and his courageous efforts to finally put his life back on track.  In his prime, Frankie Wilde is a celebrity who lives every bit of the high life - drowning his liver in alcohol, snorting bagful after bagful of cocaine, entertaining many a lady, and generally doing everything in a disconnected, vainglorious fashion.  The movie pulls no punches in showing us Frankie at his most disgusting.  Once he begins to lose his hearing, however, you can't help but feel sorry for him.  He covers it up for as long as he possibly can, but - obviously - a man in his profession can't cover up such a devastating truth forever.  Once he learns that he is indeed going completely deaf, his life hits rock bottom.  He basically loses everything, including his wife and son along with his career.  It's not a pretty sight at all, and he eventually holes himself up in his own pitifully constructed rubber room for months on end, basically surviving on drugs alone.  His cocaine addiction is presented in a most forcible way - the monkey on his back is actually a disgusting large badger in a fairy tale outfit that isn't above smacking Frankie around when he threatens to cut back on the snorting.  It sounds ridiculous, but the imagery works frighteningly well.

In time, Frankie decides to accept his disability and try to reenter the world; he gives up the drugs (but not the booze), finds someone to teach him the art of lip-reading, and eventually rediscovers his music.  In essence, he develops the ability to feel and see music all around him and to channel it all into some righteous grooves that fuel the most improbable of comebacks.

This movie isn't just about Frankie's amazing story, however.  It also seems to have something to say about the music industry and the callousness of greedy managers and promoters who care about nothing apart from the money their stars generate for them.  Frankie was a star, but no one stuck around to help him through a tragedy that almost and probably should have resulted in his death.  The ending of the film, which doesn't follow the path you would normally expect, strongly but quietly reinforces this critique of the shallowness of success.

The scenes of Frankie's emotional breakdown truly are dark and disturbing, and there is much in the film as a whole to justify its R rating.  The film also has its funny moments, but this is a true dark comedy.  I have to say that Paul Kaye is spectacular in the role of Frankie, lending a vitality and brute strength to an unforgettable character who will disgust you, amuse you, and eventually inspire you.  I don't know how else to say it: It's All Gone Pete Tong is just a uniquely extraordinary film.",1134777600,22,3746,4.627836611195159
2378161,5,B000A7LR6Y,"Watch this movie!  For all its shock value and gross-out humor it is also shockingly sweet - heartwarming - inspiring - and thought-provoking.  Really entertaining, even for people who don't give a ___ about club scenes.",1132444800,5,220,5.083333333333333
2378162,4,B000A7LR6Y,"""It's all gone Pete Tong"" is Cockney rhyming slang for ""It's all gone wrong,"" named after British DJ Pete Tong (who appears in the film and is a producer). This mockumentary by Canadian Michael Dowse (Fubar) follows the rise, fall, and resurrection of Frankie Wilde (Paul Kaye), a resident Ibiza god of the turntables who has the club crowd drooling at his feet. Frankie is losing his hearing due to a combination of drugs, working the clubs, and a congenital hearing defect, and instead of heeding his doctor's advice, he drowns in more booze, more coke, and self-destructive behaviour. In a studio blowout, he loses the rest of his hearing and becomes a drug-addled hermit. Finally kicking the drug habit and pulling himself together after two failed suicide attempts, Frankie seeks out a lip reading teacher and discovers how to beat mix using vibrations.

As many have noted, this is a film that walks a very narrow line between humour and mock-seriousness in the style of ""This Is Spinal Tap,"" with the prerequisite talking-head interviews with real-life DJ celebs, including Tiesto, Paul Van Dyk, Carl Cox, Pete Tong, Sarah Main, and more. The problem is, ""Pete Tong"" can't decide if it's a mockumentary biopic, rave epic, or love story, and loses its cohesion along the way. Much of it is played up for shock value, with excessive amounts of projectile vomiting, graphic sex, drug use and filthy language. The Coke Badger wasn't funny at all: a six-foot stuffed badger wearing a dirty apron, complete with dangling white snot, chases Frankie to snort more coke.

Where ""Pete Tong"" does shine is in its soundtrack (available as ASIN: B00097HDOU) and its club scenes, shot inside the legendary Ibiza palaces of Cream, Amnesia, and Manumission during actual theme nights at full capacity of 10,000. The ""interviews"" with ethnic tourists (Spanish transvestite, Polish flower seller, German guys) and on-location photography of restaurants, villas, and clubs really lend the film an authentic feel. The behind-the-scenes making of, which clocks in at almost an hour, details the grueling shoot that almost didn't happen: no money, no line producer, no extras, no cars, no water, etc. Another nice extra are the featurettes that were originally available on several websites to promote the film. These don't tie directly into the story, but serve to flesh out the characters.

This is NOT for sensitive viewers, but when all is said and done, I'm glad I finally had the chance to see Frankie in action after waiting since the film's release last April. Fans of rave, house, techno, and Ibiza veterans will have fun with this.",1132272000,8,2626,5.018348623853211
2378163,5,B000A7LR6Y,"Paul Kaye is one of the underappreciated joys of British pop culture.  He starred in the critically-acclaimed series 'Two Thousand Acres of Sky', which has finally seen airtime over here in the USA on some PBS stations. In this movie, however, he manages to take the story and character of Frankie Wilde from near-total repugnance and make him into somebody you can't help but root for.  The first half of the movie is almost too intense, and may be tough going for some, but will truly prove rewarding if you hang in there. Words like 'triumph' and 'inspiration' have appeared in other reviews, and for good reason. An extra bonus is the brilliance of Mike Wilmot as Frankie Wilde's agent, Max Haggar. Stellar casting, biting commentary, and over-the-top production in the party scenes are all icing on the cake. It's a feelgood movie with unexpected turns and twists, and I hope people appreciate it for the brilliant satire and very human story that it is.",1128816000,10,959,4.806060606060606

Human Traffic, Trainspotting, Better Living Through Circuitry, PETE

TONG is a mash-up of the Spinal Tap mockumentary and Aviator biopic.

Second-time director Micahel Dowse rides a thin line between faux and

flake, mashing up a dance, booze, drug addled first act with a sweet,

romantic second act. Brit Paul Kaye is deejay maestro Frankie Wilde,

based loosely on deejay icons Pete Tong, Teisto, PVD, and others, who

parties until the sun rises on the grand island of Ibiza. Everything

is perfect, his gorgeous wife, his career, his foul-mouthed manager

(played by a hyper-throttled Mike Wilmot), until his hearing starts to

deteriorate. When his life and friends escape him, Frankie must cope.

Has he been reduced to half a man or is this an event of empowerment?

For anyone who has a disability (mine involved reading), this is an

inspiring and sweet story. Kaye is fantastic, as is mysterious

stranger Penelope, played by Beatriz Batarda. Lol Hammond is a genius

working the music and Graham Massey's score is sublime, as usual.

Lots of drugs, brief sex, but balanced with top-notch visuals, acting,

and music.",1127260800,7,1200,5.0717948717948715
