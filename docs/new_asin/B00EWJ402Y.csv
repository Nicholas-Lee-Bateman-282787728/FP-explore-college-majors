8610050,2,B00EWJ402Y,"This is one of my favorite Euro-chillers.  Dripping with Gothic atmosphere.  The picture is a tad better than the old Alpha DVD, but the sound track is horrible.  Audio is muffled throughout, you can hardly make out what anyone is saying and half the score is practically muted.  So disappointing!",1511740800,,297,4.88
8610051,3,B00EWJ402Y,"Best quality so far for this title, but no where near definitive.",1454371200,,65,4.5
8610052,4,B00EWJ402Y,"OK Italian-made, English-dubbed early 60's horror film.  A young woman, with her friends, returns to the family manor and finds creepy goings-on with gawd-awful screams, sleepwalking, and ghastly-looking madmen lurking about.  The Retromedia/Bayview DVD release is very good.  Far better than the Alpha DVD release.  Recommended for fans of the genre.",1422144000,4,351,5.823529411764706

8610054,4,B00EWJ402Y,"Im into Gothic horrors like Nightmare Castle, Castle of Blood, etc so this fits right in. Its a great crisp black and white murder mystery film with all the Gothic elements that I enjoy so much.",1386028800,5,194,4.416666666666667
8610055,4,B00EWJ402Y,"When I first saw this listing on Amazon as a 50th Anniversary release of Director Alberto Di Martino's Italian gothic 'HORROR' aka 'THE BLANCHEVILLE MONSTER'- 1963, I was really excited but there was no image available of the DVD cover.  When it arrived, I was taken aback.  The release information stated that the company was Bay View Entertainment/Widowmaker but after seeing the DVD cover, it's none other than a Retromedia Entertainment release.  The story has all the gothic settings of a red herring murder mystery with the disfigured monster being a family member fulfilling the family curse resembling Director Roger Corman's Poe films by inserting a premature burial sequence at the film's climax. It also boasts a great group of character actors featuring Gerard Tichy and Leo Anchoriz who were in many releases at that time.  The added attraction is Helga Line, one of the most beautiful genre actresses of her day who steals the show with her icy presence.  Available for many years on the budget Alpha Video label in a splicy full screen print probably culled from 16mm, this transfer is a much needed improvement. The print seems window boxed from 35mm in a 1.85 transfer and the gorgeous black and white photography by Alejandro Ulloa finally gets its just rewards but it is not a digital transfer so it's the best we have for now.  The only extra is a second feature 'THE FACELESS MONSTER'  released by Retromedia about eight years ago and long out of print which is non other than Director Mario Caino's excellent 'NIGHTMARE CASTLE' aka 'AMANTI D'OLTRETUMBA'-1965 starring Barbara Steele and which was released in 2009 in a gorgeous transfer by Severin Films.  Helga Line is also featured in the film and practically steals it from 'Babs'.  The transfer is just OK in a 1.66 non-digital transfer culled from 35mm. If your a fan of the film, stick with the superior Severin release, however, if you do not have it, then this double feature package is worth the price.  To see two great Gothic Horrors from the Italian golden age together and seeing the underrated Helga Line strutting her stuff in both features,  its a must for Euro Horror fans.",1385078400,9,2162,4.863760217983652
