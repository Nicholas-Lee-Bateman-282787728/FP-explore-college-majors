1946429,1,B0000UJL50,"My girlfriend started watching this while I was in the other room. I walked in, watched one scene and said,""What, for the first scene of this did they flash the definition of anarchy?""  Yes, this pedantic piece ... reads like a none too subtle right-wing rebuttal of Fight Club.  The leader is caricatured as a pedophile, and the idealistic young rebels soon descend into drug use, petty crime, and eventually jail time.  Fortunately the main character is redeemed by a ... young republican co-ed, and he rediscovers the joy of borgeouis sterility just in time.  This is a pedantic, stereotype-ridden ..., rent it if you feel like doing your own humorous critique, but for god's sake don't waste your money buying it...",1077494400,4,719,4.868852459016393
1946430,3,B0000UJL50,"This is a light, feel good movie, not to be confused with American History X or any other movie in the same genre with seious subject matter to be interrogated. It is a kitch representation of USA high school life. What the film lacks in complexity it more than makes up for in bubble gum viewing. At times stereotypically painfull the plot and subjects are shallow and obvious but all play their parts well. Lacking gusto and clout to be anything other than another very well put together formulaic 'post teen movie'. Anarchist cook book is fun, thats all unfortunately!",1075420800,2,571,4.72
1946431,1,B0000UJL50,"I tried so hard to give this movie a chance.  Right away, I noticed similarities to movies such as 'Fight Club', 'SLC Punk', and even 'Suburbia'.  I recommend any of these three films, but can't do so for this one.  Now that I think about it, it even features a basketball game that smacks of a scene from 'American History X'.
  From the first couple of minutes on, this film offered nothing original.  From a technical standpoint, the shots are static and seem to go on too long.  The writing is pitiful.  The dialogue is unbelievable and made me roll my eyes so much that I memorized the inside of my eyelids.
  The extras are scarce; only a commentary from the director.  I'd be willing to bet that there were enough goofs to warrant a gag-reel.  With one of those, this may have scored two stars.
  Bottom line: the movie is distant, plodding, and predictable. The actors bring nothing original to the table. Some scenes seem meant to shock but fall short.",1075075200,5,961,4.511627906976744
1946432,3,B0000UJL50,"This independent film, directed by Jordan Susman, gets its title from an infamous book from the 1960s which advocates every conceivable kind of rebellion against authority. This film, on the other hand, is basically apolitical, despite its title and theme. It starts off in an extremely lighthearted manner, showing a group of ""anarchists"" who are more like a harmless hybrid between hippies and slackers. They live communally in a large, rundown house in Dallas. The cast features Devon Gummersall as Puck, a likable, mild-mannered sort who seems to have drifted into this lifestyle by accident and John Savage (the only well known member of the cast) as an older veteran of the counterculture.  The anarchists start out as a comical group who could be members of a fraternity. The story is rather unfocused and not very much happens for the first two-thirds of the film. Puck leaves the community for no apparent reason and  later returns; an improbable romance between Puck and a girl who belongs to a Republican group fills some space; there is an amusing but familiar sequence of Puck and a friend working in a Starbucks-type cafe and, naturally, getting fired promptly. When a newcomer named Johnny Black  (Dylan Bruno) challenges the group to do more than talk and protest, the film takes a turn into darker territory. Johnny Black joins forces with some right-wing militia groups, which raises some interesting questions about political ideology --questions which the film ultimately abandons. If The Anarchist Cookbook has a message, it is a very vague one, especially considering  its provocative title. Even when the anarchists discuss politics, there is an avoidance of anything too controversial. Although the film was apparently released in 2002, there is no indication of the actual contemporary atmosphere --e.g. 9-11, War on Terror, Iraq, etc. It seems to be taking place in a more innocent era. The film seems to be saying, in its very indirect way, that when you take the idea of anarchism to its natural conclusion, you end up with someone like Johnny Black, who turns out to be violent and amoral.  At the end, Puck makes the heavy-handed observation that ""freedom without responsibility is a myth."" This may be a valid message, but this meandering film does not back it up. I have to give it some credit, however, for being, at times, interesting and thought-provoking and for at least having the courage to tiptoe around material that other films would not touch with a ten-foot pole.",1073606400,15,2507,5.016826923076923
1946433,2,B0000UJL50,"Although the movie did have a few redeeming qualities, I found it disappointing.  As a student at Susman's high school and a memeber of the scene that his movie tried to represent, I was upset with the way it was portrayed.  This is not because it was portrayed in a negative way, but because it was simply false.  If it had been set in a different city with a different scene, I might have reacted differently, but it seemed horribly unrealistic and shallow.",1070755200,2,459,4.506024096385542

1946435,3,B0000UJL50,This movies is almost exactly like SLC Pink same style with the voice over and goofy characters. Except its set in Dallas Texas instead of Salt lake city utah.,1206576000,,159,4.517241379310345
1946436,1,B0000UJL50,"Jordan Susman's debut black comedy centers on a Dallas, TX youth commune which is disrupted by the arrival of nihilist Johnny Black, who totes The Anarchist Cookbook.  The movie purports to portray anarchism, yet the characters are social leeches who are wholly uneducated in politics, history, life, purpose, everything.  The ""nihilist"" tries to unify people into a movement, which would be ironic if the director intended it as such.

I did enjoy seeing Devon Gummersall of My So-Called Life fame in a leading role.  His portrayal of Puck, taken alone from the rest of the film, is fine acting.  If you want to see a outstanding movie about genuine youth disillusionment with anarchist leanings, go rent SLC Punk.",1202860800,2,715,5.02542372881356
1946437,1,B0000UJL50,"This movie is so, so bad. Particularly the ending, which gave it an after school special kind of feel. The only reason I can recommend watching this is so you can marvel at how ridiculous it is.",1186531200,,194,4.27027027027027
1946438,1,B0000UJL50,"Yes, this is truly a terrible movie with a plot as pointless and forgettable as the movement that it is supposed to represent. The characters are very stereotypical, and, in terms of my own observations of anarchists, the actors look as close to the genuine article as I do Beyonce. The one thing that does give the production value is the hysterical way in which it unintentionally savages the absurd ways of the self-righteous leftist fringe. The most self-righteous of them all is a sixties wash-out who loves Sweden and little boys but definitely not in that order. Viewers will soon find that the main characters are a group of fools who stand for nothing and are against everything. They then admit to their being against the idea of being against everything. A great line is that in their clubhouse everything is allowed except smoking--great, so they're trendy too. They even do a performance of radical street theatre that includes the axing of fake minks. At that point, I was actually laughing out loud. Yes, I got a kick out of this movie but I can't pretend that anybody else would.",1182211200,,1095,4.738219895287958
1946439,4,B0000UJL50,"Alright, so this movie isn't ""really"" about Anarchists because most of the characters who refer to themselves as Anarchists aren't really. They are more like hippies than Anarchists, and the only character to actually realize this is the main character of Puck. It follows the same formula as Train Spotting, with a similar ending, but I would still reccommend it.

Regardless of this, it is still a good movie. The point of this movie is not to show that Anarchism sounds good until you actually meet a real anarchist. Johnny Black is the natural progression of anarchisitic ideas, and that is what the movie is really about. The end of the movie isn't about ""giving into the man"" or ""betraying who you are""; Puck's final decision is about doing the right thing because it's the right thing and not because anyone says you should. What I think the movie is trying to say is that this isn't any ""right"" ideology, and the best we can do is try to be good people.",1165104000,,961,4.587209302325581
1946440,4,B0000UJL50,"Dallas, Plano, and the suburbs are what Puk thought he despised the most.  He believed in freedom, no order, and self rule.  Then life changed when Jonny Black came into the picture. Full of hidden little puns and quirks (Jonny Red vs. Johnny Black) ect... this film tells a tale of cautionary woes on who to value as friends, and what to truely believe in.  I think this movie was a bit ahead of the times, poking fun at the republicans and the way that they were stearing the country at the time (look at the election results), but it also reminds us to not go to far the other direction either, because both extremes can have problems.

""Take A Hit"", see this film,  interesting enough to kill some time on a cold winters day.",1163289600,,729,4.37037037037037
1946441,2,B0000UJL50,"It's kind of a goofy movie. Nothing like what I expected. It's neither a comedy or a drama. A little of both. It follows a group of young people (well except the leader is old) who want to change the world but really just living haphazardly. More like hippies than anarchists. It's a group that looks out for each other...until Johnny Black comes into their lives and remakes the group into his idea of how it should be. Which is very destructive. Most leave. Puck doesn't like the changes and leaves but returns to take care of the remaining original members.

I really disliked the ending. It was interesting in a mildly entertaining way but I can't recommend this movie.",1155427200,5,673,4.608333333333333
1946442,4,B0000UJL50,"I think those that gave this film a bad review genuinely don't understand it.  I rented it, and was blown away.  If you thought the Matrix was brilliant, you won't like this film, but then again, you would not understand filmmaking.

This film was created by people that understand the medium.  If you truly understand and appreciate film, you will appreciate this one.  Definitely a must see for those interested in exploring the edge of filmmaking.",1125187200,7,450,4.868421052631579
1946444,2,B0000UJL50,"This movie to me really just felt like a new version of the movie SLC Punk. Besides having the nihilist in the Anarchist Cookbook, there are countless parallels between the two movies. Best friends, tragedy, group of counter-culture hacks, counter-culture hacks disappear, etc. etc.

It was ok I guess and mildy entertaining, but not something worth purchasing. If you can rent it or buy it used for under $5 then sure, it might be worth checking out.",1117152000,5,451,4.857142857142857
1946445,1,B0000UJL50,"Oh, the things I heard about this movie. One of my friends told me that this was the worst movie ever made. Then later I read reviews of this movie and decided that I might, just might, give it a try. I mean I have been surprised before. I have seen movies that I thought were going to be dreadful, but they turned out to be perfectly acceptable. This was not one of those movies: no the inept directing and script writing relegated this movie to the lowest level of the rubbish bin.

Puck is a follower. He just wants to be part of something. The script etches out this point again and again, lacking any subtelty in the delivery. Instead of having to actually think about the characters and decide whether they did the right thing or the wrong thing, the movie spoonfeeds us the answers and deeper meanings. So, here he is, his anarcho-pacifist group taken over by a radical sociopath. What is he to do? Follow the path of his Republican girlfriend or blow up building alongside with neo-nazis and gun weilding McVeighites?

Apart from entirely lacking subtelty, this movie was hackneyed rubbish. Now, I understand that every movie steals from other movies. That in and of itself is not a problem. However, this movie is nothing but a sampler of: SLC Punk, Trainspotting, American History X, Fight Club (its there believe me), and a plethora of other such movies. Yes, its all been done, but the story of a young misguided man breaking off from the underground and into the mainstream has been done more times than even the multiple personailty cliche.

So what have we got? A movie that is a patchwork of cliches and exhibits the subtlety of a sledgehammer. I'll go on. The script is terrible. Yes, terrible. None of the actors in this movie were that terrible, no, but being forced to say those horrid lines you would sound coerced too. For example: Double D says, ""What am I going to do without you."" In full seriousness. It sounds stupid. Really stupid. The plot, being little less than a string of cliches is horribly predictable. Sitting in front of the screen you will be able to tell what will happen in the next five minutes at every point in the movie.

However in the end you supposed precognition will become more obvious. You will enjoy not watching that film. Any viewer will be able to predict that.",1106697600,5,2316,4.573493975903615
1946446,3,B0000UJL50,"First of all i really do not see the whole ""right wing propoganda"" that everyone else sees. I do believe that democrats are against anarchy as well. The only reason that this movie does not get a higher rating is because of the simple point that anarchist were represented very wrong, they are not hippies (well not totally, they are like angry hippies). And i don't think anybody should be represented in bad fashion (hippies). The plot did linger a bit, but the story was there. The reason it gets a 3 is because entertainment value was good (but only for a rental). If your looking for a good movie to buy about anarchy i would suggest SLC Punk, very well done. As for the ending, anybody who didn't like it is probably just some sad teenage anarchist that wishes they could live this life forever and not grow out of it. The fact is that anarchy will get you nowhere grow up and deal with it. Puck did.",1097366400,3,906,4.366863905325443
1946447,1,B0000UJL50,"This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life (and I'm one to usually get into just about any movie).It confuses the viewer of what anarchy truly is. It's contradicting. Then it tries to make it seem like being right wing is the only way of life. Not to mention it's boring. There were a couple of intresting scenes,other then that it's boring. The ending makes it stupid,just like how it did in ""SLC Punk"" (which at least, was decent compared to this movie).Don't even waste the $3 it takes to rent this movie.",1096848000,,523,4.346938775510204
1946448,1,B0000UJL50,"I have to agree with the previous reviewers who ""suspect"" there is a right wing propaganda message in this film. I don't suspect, I know there is a right wing propaganda message in this film. This film is a wretched waste of time for anyone who isn't a George Bush loving, right wing Christian/Republinazi. The film isn't true to anarchist philosophy or intent. Sure, there are fanatics in every group who want to do crazy, destructive things. But there are plenty of intelligent, sane anarchists out there who believe in non-violent change. I'm not an anarchist, just a liberal who thought I might see an interesting film about anarchism gone a little too far. Instead, I was hit over the head with a right wing propaganda piece about how anyone who's different is bad. As a previous reviewer stated, the moral of this movie is: don't deviate from the mainstream, go get a corporate office job and marry your Christian Republican girlfriend and life will be great!

 Apart from its revolting message, this isn't even a well made film. The lead actor in the role of Puck is completely unconvincing as a young ""anarchist."" He looks like a boy scout/yuppie/hipster who had his hair slightly tousled with some styling gel. The editing and storyline are terribly done. Disjointed editing creates a story that at times makes no coherent sense and doesn't explain how things have transitioned in the plot. The story itself doesn't go very deeply into how these characters came to be who they are, their motivations, etc. To sum it up, this plays like an Afterschool Special created by focus on the family. I would give this film zero stars if I could. At total piece of crap, don't waste your time unless you are a rabid conservative. Ugh.",1091318400,4,1733,4.754152823920266
1946449,1,B0000UJL50,"This movie is a complete misrepresentation of both anarchy as a philosophy and I hope it also misrepresents the way anarchists think. I'm not familiar with such a subculture as the one portrayed in this movie, but the logic employed by these characters is totally contrived, frivelous and ridden with cliches. Simply put, the writer is not smart enough to write to be writting about this stuff. I assure you that my hatred for this flick is not rooted in personal politics...its rooted in anger because I lost about 6 dollars to blockbuster and 2 hrs of valued leisure time. Anyone beyond a prepubescent brain capacity should NOT enjoy this movie. If anything, it has marginal comedic value as being a completely ridiculous joke but if that's what your looking for its still not very entertaining. That so many adults appreciated this film makes me very cyinical with regards to the general population and their capacity to think.",1087084800,3,930,4.8924050632911396
1946450,5,B0000UJL50,"This is a uniquely fun and original movie. But it requires an open mind. The thing that made it so good was that it subverted so many expectations. Instead of being a mindless manual on how to blow stuff up, the movie is about one guy coming of age in a hilarious and harrowing way.
PC people will probably not dig it. But anyone with a brain and a sense of humor will.",1082073600,5,369,4.068493150684931
1946451,3,B0000UJL50,"I originally watched this movie as was recommended by a friend, and was sometimes humored by some parts. However, I was horrified by the ending, when suddenly this militant convinces everyone into a violent attack, and how he turns everyone in. I'm currently researching into the directors and the film more for evidence of a right-wing propaganda message within. There's skepticism towards the real Anarchist Cookbook (the book itself), and it would be no surprise if this movie was yet another anti-anarchism piece targetted at an anarchist/activist audience.",1081468800,,561,5.386363636363637
1946452,3,B0000UJL50,"I loved this movie.  maybe it wasn't as good as SLC Punk, but it was still good.  but the only thing bad about this movie is that is goes against true anarchist because in this movie a few of them are hippys or what ever there called.  and they hate disctrution and stuff.  what is up with that.  if you really want to know what a real and true Anarchist is then watch SLC Punk, maybe you'll learn something.",1079740800,,408,4.113924050632911
1946453,1,B0000UJL50,"We began watching this movie with the hope of being inspired into being better activists than we are today.  However, after finishing this flick my husband and I both felt duped into watching it.  Its fairytale ending, reeked of right-wing propaganda: anarchy can get you nowhere, go to school, fall in love with a republican christian girl and live the 'proper' life.  I was disgusted and want everyone to know that this movie speaks nothing of activism.  It praises Bush at one point, assocaites activists with nazis, and is just a huge dissappointment for all it could have been.  I suppose the fact that you can rent or buy it and it hasn't been blacklisted should be enough proof that it has no content whatsoever.",1078876800,3,719,4.72

This film is closer to Fight Club than the legendary comedy gem and even then, the distance between the two films is substantial.  Where Anarchist Cookbook succeeds is in tapping into and highlighting the frustration of youth, where it fails is in the acting (it's average), morose humor and general non-direction of the film.

Then one day enters Johnny Black. Johnny Black uses the popular ""Anarchist Cookbook"" (which the group outside of Johnny Red have never heard of it) to generate bombs, drugs etc. in order to bring down the man. He also uses cyberspace attacks. Johnny Black takes over the group.

Meanwhile Puck gets involved with a young Christian Republican woman who is everything he is not, but ironically seem to have the same core values.

The central protagonist/antagonist is a manic character who focuses his life around the book of the name of the movie.  Well, since it's fiction he didn't kill himself in his teens drilling into a pipe he'd packed with explosives first...

Anyways, it's a really hilarious movie if not taken too seriously.  Non-radicals who like to joke about radicals should love this.
