8299973,5,B001EZ8IMC,"A great series that was ended by taking the smurfs from their element and placed them in time travel .  The smurfs visit places such as Ireland, Egypt, and the era of Dinos just to name a few.  Many inconsistencies take place in this final season but due to its charm and world wide love from its fans it is still hailed as a classic even if the final season didn't appeal to everyone .
Its still worth a try, and if you haven't purchased the Ultimate Collection 1 and 2 than and want to know how the series ends than this set will do justice for you.",1393200000,,551,4.092592592592593
8299974,1,B001EZ8IMC,"I have a Region-Free DVD Player and was able to watch this (although I wish they would release more of the later seasons of SMURFS on DVD in the USA, or at least air them on Cartoon Network or Boomerang).  This was the ninth and final season of SMURFS, in which the characters became lost in time and traveled to different times and places.  This would be a great DVD collection if not for one major flaw:  On Disc 2, the second half of the episode ""Smurfs of the Round Table"" is missing!  After you watch the first half of the episode, it just skips right over to the next episode ""A Fish Called Snappy"".  The seller sent me a replacement disc, but it did the same thing, which leads me to believe that this is a manufacturer's error and must be on Disc 2 in every DVD set.  It's a shame, because it ruins an otherwise good collection.  So, if you're buying this, just be aware that half of one of the episodes is missing, so it's not really the ""complete"" series.  I just hope that the manufacturer is aware of the problem and will release a corrected set.  If they also released it in the USA, that would be very Smurfy!",1318896000,,1123,4.234741784037559
8299975,1,B001EZ8IMC,"Unfortunately, this is a REGION 4 DVD and can not be played in most DVD players.  I was really excited about this DVD and could not wait for it to show up but upon putting it in my DVD player(s) and computer just to find out that it is a REGION 4 and is NOT compatible with US DVD players. I wasted my money so please beware before buying this item.",1233792000,,349,3.915492957746479
