8394679,3,B003D3Y67O,"I bought this because I love medieval history and castles of course, This DVD on castles is OK, not bad but not great either.  It is too short for one thing and has a cheap production feel to it. As well as not enough castles are shown from Europe, though there are some interesting things about castles I did not know about and that was interesting to see. If you like Medieval history you will still like this DVD for what it is. And there is so little out there on the topic that this DVD is still worth having .",1414713600,2,515,4.099009900990099
