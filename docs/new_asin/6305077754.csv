961736,3,6305077754,"""They Live"" is a low-budget John Carpenter film that has a wrestler staring in the title roll (a roll tailor-made for Kurt Russell).  Surprisingly, Roddy Piper is not at all bad in this roll.  ""They Live"" is  an interesting film about the subliminal seduction of the human race by  aliens who live among `us' without our knowledge.  Now comes the part that  stretches the imagination just a tad.  It seems a group of freedom fighters  have developed glasses that can see through their mind control techniques  and can expose the aliens to anyone who wears them.  I found the general  premise of alien mind control fascinating, however, the film is uneven, and  boasts one of the longest and most ridiculous fight scenes ever filmed (all  over wanting his friend to look through the glasses).  I can't believe  anyone would even want to film a fight scene half that duration! (my  apologies to those who liked it--maybe I missed the humor in it)  All in  all, ""They Live"" is certainly worth the price of the rental.  Between 1 and  10, I give the film a solid 6.",924048000,3,1061,4.602150537634409

Their manipulation consists of a wide spread strategy to appear like a human being while not informing all the members of the human group that they are in fact aliens.

Over the years, John Carpenters late-80s film has attained a cult following and a lot of respect for its anti-consumerism message.  I appreciate that aspect as well, but thats about all.  I found it to be long and fairly dull.  The premise is not explored very effectively, instead being merely the background for a pretty implausible this-happened-then-this-happened-then-this-happened kind of story structure.  Loved the big fist fight, though, and it did have some moments.",1517356800,,649,5.333333333333333

Now, while I'm sure we can all agree (at least most of us) that these messages aren't created by an invading alien menace, They Live still makes you question the messages from magazines, ads and television you see every day.

962246,4,6305077754,"There is a reason this is a cult classic. This movie was low-budget and hokey even for it's time in the '80s, but the story-line is as prophetic as Orwell's 1984 and should be re-visited if not seen for the first time because of it's relevancy to our current political climate. In much the same way that Margaret Atwood's ""A Handmaid's Tale"" exposes the outcome of nationalizing extreme religious ideology, ""They Live"" examines how the parasitic oligarchy controls the masses into compliance with greed and ignorance. And as you watch it to it's conclusion, consider the monopoly that current Media companies, (i.e. Clear Channel, Sinclair, FOX News, etc.) have on rural America and it's manipulative efficacy with scripted bias messaging.

The fight scene will go down as one of the most realistic in any film, even with the choreography, because of Piper's natural ability and Keith's boxing background. The lovely Meg Foster's ice-blue eyes are even better on the blu-ray version and I loved her interview regarding her character. Still one of the best early 80's scifi offerings, with a smattering of dystopian futuristic overtones. Carpenter is, has been and will always be a genius at film-making. Thanks to Carpenter for giving us the great extra bonus features. An absolute must-have for fans of this genre. It doesn't get much better than this.",1509235200,4,828,5.095588235294118

but I can't knock any stars off for that.

Rowdy Roddy Piper is the man,
and shows it here!
When he passed a couple years ago I thought about how great it would have been to have met him.

RIP Mr Piper.

Back to the movie,
great story line, great pretense,
it's probably a love it or hate it thing since there is a little cheesyness to it,
but even that is to be loved and delighted in all its 1980's goodness!

Back story and feel is in a ""1984"" dystopian fashion that still plays out in 2017 (maybe even more so than it did in 1988).

Character drama is good at times, a bit cardboard at others,
fight scenes are similar,
there's some very good stuff here and some places to criticize for anyone who doesn't like the movie.

As someone who really likes this film I loved and enjoyed every bit of it, warts and all.
Steelbook edition is very good as well,
unfortunately it's ""not eligible"" for disc to digital scanning under programs like Vudu.

Also there's maybe a dozen F-bombs,
and one upper body nude shot towards the end of the movie,
so keep that in mind for teens

If Matt an Trey, consummate piss takers, show this kind of love for the source material maybe, just maybe there is something here you should lay your eyes on.
Aside from the fight, I have a soft spot for anything made by John Carpenter, three of his films are in my personal top ten list.

962525,5,6305077754,"Was this film made by time travelers?  Can anyone prove it was NOT made by time travelers?

John Carpenter's science fiction horror film (or documentary?) seems even more timely today than it was in 1988, with a tightly focused story (only about a dozen characters have speaking parts, and the hero never gets a name) and some memorable visuals.  I won't spoil it, but it really is a striking satire of the 1%, media, and advertising.

The ending is generic action movie stuff, every good guy bullet hits, every bad guy bullet misses.  Which is a shame because up until the final reel the action was a lot more realistic and at times brutal.

Bottom line, it's a clever film, it's an interesting film, and it well-deserves its status as a cult classic.",1503532800,4,752,4.616541353383458

Too much to list and the thing's a classic no matter what.  It's a must-see in most geek and nerd circles.

I would have gladly returned these or refused them had I been given the opportunity, but my complaints went into a graveyard where customer satisfaction lies buried and ignored.

963261,5,6305077754,"A great movie. Rowdy Roddy Piper, noted in his role in Hell goes to Frogtown and Always Sunny in Philadelphia Is pushed out of work by outsourcing and illegal immigrants.
He finds work and housing in a local tent city and remarks to a new friend that he still believes in the American dream. That by working hard and staying out of trouble he can still find what he needs to be happy.
However a rigged system is exposed when Piper finds sun glasses which filter the worlds matrix and shows it what it really is.  A world where the elite are space aliens and human sellouts.
Piper goes from working man to a man who must fight back against the system which has oppressed him.

They Live is a beautiful movie which becomes more relevant as time goes on. Most films as they age become less relevant and become a snapshot of life during that time period. But the movie They Live could easily represent this generation.
Enjoy this movie, study this and show it to your children. Educate them in the lessons of this film. Consumerism, work ethic and living life in a culture with a dying middle class are all covered In this epic tale.  And of course They Live teaches us life's greatest lesson. Sometimes it's time to chew bubble gum and sometimes you gotta kick ass but when you run out of chewing gum there is only one option left. Kick ass. Now why are you reading this?

I flat out didn't like The Fog the first couple times I saw it but thought there were great things about it and now I'm addicted to it. Third time really is a charm. While they're both not quite as great as most of his other classics they're pretty damn close and highly entertaining (especially The Fog which is a near masterpiece but it's only flaw is that it's not scary like it wanted to be). Roddy Piper and Keith David were perfect casting choices and I love its mixture of 80s and 50s sci fi styles. As usual Carpenter does another excellent score as well.

Buy it and put it alongside Hell Comes To Frogtown and John Carpenter's Vampires. You won't be sorry. Is it a ""great film""? A ""cinematic masterpiece""? Nah.

In its time, the movie must have been mind-boggling, even though the ideas of devoting oneself to The Organization and being programmed to mindlessly receive subliminal messages had been around since ""The Organization Man"" and ""The Hidden Persuaders.""  But the message needed repeating in the 80s, when greed was good.  The whole work-eat-buy mechanism  was really taking hold, driven by ever-more-intriguing technology. That trend has continued.

 The powerful political themes still resonate strongly today much like Robocop (1987) seemingly timeless movies but looking back now it does feel a bit rushed and I think the premise could've been stretched out over either a longer run time or even sequels. Once Roddy dons the sunglasses and sees the world for what it really is the movie comes to it's conclusion too quickly.

 But it was a low budget movie and obviously there are limits and Carpenter does very well with what he had and I enjoyed the bonus 15 minute interview with him in the special features where he makes it explicit that the aliens were a metaphor for Republicans. The imagery and anti-consumerist billboards in the movie are very similar to those used by Australian electro-industrial artist David Thrussell aka Snog aka Black Lung aka Soma on his album covers and in his music videos who took some inspiration from They Live.",1463702400,,1108,4.525

The movie deals with the discovery by a group of people that the Earth, and mankind, are being exploited by a race of extraterrestrial aliens and their human collaborators for  --  what else?  --  money.  At the time the movie was made, in 1988, Carpenter was going after the ""yuppies.""  Substitute ""the 1%"" and the conspiracy theory (Just because it's a theory doesn't mean that it isn't true.) of the existence of a ""shadow government"" and Carpenter's parable of greed and exploitation rings as true, today, as it did nearly three decades ago.

Two, we can see that aliens who seem to look like us and r all around us and they are secretly taking over our country. This is something an experienced person can understand.

964269,4,6305077754,"I loved this one because of its subject matter.  I warn you up front....It is dated.  The special effects are poor. The characters aren't well drawn.  Normally, I would give this one a two or three stars.  However, John Carpenter's ""They Live"", is a masterpiece of conspiracy theory brought to film.  It perfectly portends the world of today.  It is a truly prophetic piece of cinema, demonstrating how beguiled we are as citizens and how corrupt our value systems have become.  He predicted it and it came true.  Ignore the cheesy lines and focus on the content.  Perhaps he even tried to make it cheesy to pass by those who would stop us from seeing it.  Unfortunately, it didn't work.  Interestingly enough, this film did very well when released.  It was ready to be one of the first to go to ""rental release"" when it was ""disappeared"" by TPTB and it remained ""gone"" for quite some time....until the ""buzz"" evaporated.  So, put on your ""super"" glasses and ""see the world"" as it has truly become.  Can you handle the truth?  Carpenter thought you could.  So do I.",1450656000,2,1065,4.614973262032086
964270,5,6305077754,"It would be amusing in a really, really tacky way if it weren't so gut-level depressing that John Carpenter, macabre/horror master (who used a surname in the credits juuust in case it turned out to be a wrestling advertisement) would be the director to read the social substratum of the 1980's-- the ever widening gap between the rich and the poor--with such accuracy. This movie is comical because of Rowdy Roddy Piper! and his ""you pretend to hit me, I'll pretend to hit you"" scenes that last for an inordinate amount of time with the always sinister Keith Davis, an accidental buddy in the movie who wants nothing to do with Roddy's sudden insight via alien intelligence: capitalist society exists only for the continued procreation of the population and to buy things.

Putting on his alien sunglasses, he suddenly sees that things aren't all of all colors and the people at large aren't aiming for diversity. Things are more black and white in the financial and, well, Darwinian social sense. Everywhere Roddy looks, there is a sign that says: ""CONSUME"" ""PRODUCE"" ""PROCREATE"", and, of course, ""CONFORM"".

What I love is how honest Davis' character is. When Roddy--playing a character named Nada, appropriately enough--asks him to try on the sunglasses, even jestingly. Davis tells him to f**k off. ""I don't want no trouble, man,"" he says, and they get into another fight as phony as Donald Trump and Million Dollar Man Ted DiBiase once had in a WWF match. (""Everybody's gotta priiiice!"")

The implications by Carpenter aren't very subtle. Nada and Keith are human. The aliens they see when they put on their sunglasses--really corpselike, skeletal looking things--aren't human, but they have a definite purpose; to continue the cycle of money making and procreation.
You might even put this in the league of ""The Thing"", especially considering the ending. A must watch.",1450569600,,1874,5.019292604501608

If you're just getting into Carpenter's work or are mulling over which older sci-fi films might be deserving of your attention then this is a solid entry to start with. The sci-fi/action/horror THEY LIVE easily scores 4 STARS from me.

THE STORY (contains spoilers): Grotesque-looking extraterrestrials infiltrate American society and use subliminal messages: (stay asleep, no independent thought, don't question authority, reproduce, obey, consume, etc.), printed on everything from huge billboards to chewing gum wrappers in order to stealthfully, steadily, slowly condition mankind; turning us into mindless simpletons they can easily control. A small but growing human resistance movement has developed a special filter that can see the aliens' true form AND their mind control messages and these rebels begin making filtered sunglasses. A homeless drifter (Roddy Piper) accidentally ends up with a pair of the special specs, and the alien resistance movement suddenly finds itself a brand new leader... and wouldn't you know it - he's all out of bubblegum. LOL.

THOUGHTS: John Carpenter's thinly-veiled, stinging commentary on consumerism, capitalism and Reganomics. The movie's main character, John Nada, is an out of work jack of all trades who only wants to find an honest job and live a normal life. Pro-wrestler ""Rowdy"" Roddy Piper makes a surprisingly affable, engaging everyman as Nada. Piper's natural charm and goofy lug looks aid the film's narrative tremendously. They also help add to the realism when things turn sour and he has to open up a can and tackle the space spooks head-on. Some of the action is typically over-the-top 80's macho BS, but it's done well; most notably the memorable five+ minute backstreet brawl between Piper and his equally ham-fisted new friend, Frank, played by Keith David. The not so subtle message behind the film is still every bit as topical today, (and perhaps, sadly, even more so), as it was when the film first came out way back in 1988.

THE BLU-RAY: Another outstanding high-def release from the gang at Shout! Factory. Very clean transfer with sharp focus, solid blacks & mid-tones and a well-represented color palette. Little in the way of artifacting or pixelation. Presence of film grain is joyous evidence of restrained use of DNR. Sound mix is strong, level & clear. Some terrific bonus goodies round out this great release, including an audio commentary with Carpenter & Piper, a new ""Making of"" featurette, Theatrical trailer & TV ads... and more. THEY LIVE also sports another of Shout! Factory's slick, reversible slip covers; the original poster on one side and newly-commissioned artwork on the other. A nice touch.",1448150400,6,2795,5.234375

Basic story is Aliens have been among us for a long time, keep humans docile, brainwashed & in the dark about the truth through subliminal messages. Piper plays Nada, who comes across sun glasses that can see the truth. Keith David is also great in this. Its got it all, action, suspense & sci-fi. One of the 80s best sci-fi films to me. So much about it from beginning to end is enjoyable, the fight between Piper & David in particular is great. Special features include commentary, trailer, interviews. If you like Carpenter, sci-fi, 80s films or just great, fun movies in general then absolutely watch They Live, you won't regret it.",1446940800,,799,4.633802816901408

May very well have fueled additional conspiracy details on its own. The Hoffman lenses may have been named after the inventor of LSD (according to DVDTalk,) but more likely they are a reference to E.T.A. Hoffman's tale of The Sandman (wherein Coppola is a lens maker/seller.)

Kinda goofy, and Roddy Piper's take doesn't really help to take things any more seriously.
The alien makeup, not always effective, remains memorably ugly.

964448,5,6305077754,"John Nada is a middle-aged, unemployed drifter, wandering without meaning of his life. Soon after he finds a job as a construction worker in downtown L.A where he almost immediately befriends a fellow construction worker. While having lunch at a shantytown soup kitchen one day, Nada discovers a series of strange happenings around a local church that include a man constantly complaining about his TV signal being interrupted by a man who's warning the public about ""those in power"" and even a blind preacher loudly telling others to wake up.

That night, the police come and completely bulldoze and destroy the shantytown. The following morning, Nada snoops around the church to find it completely empty with only boxes hidden in the wall. He opens one of the boxes to find it filled with sunglasses. He takes a pair and soon finds out the glasses have a high-tech ability to them that show the world for what it really is. Not only do they have black and white vision but they reveal a shocking truth. A vast majority of the media is compromised of subliminal messages to keep society in the dark about the truth? What is the truth you ask? That many of the social elite are in actuality skull-faced aliens underneath the human flesh, hellbent on taking over the world. With this shocking discovery, Nada arms himself with guns and goes to war with these aliens in disguise to expose their vile secret and save the livelihood of mankind

Overall: They Live starts off with a particular eerie mood and atmosphere to pretty much drill into the viewer's mind from the get-go that something bad is going to happen. After John Nada becomes aware of what's going on, it's carnage for the rest of the movie to keep the action part of the movie constantly at a high. Fights, aliens getting blown to smithereens in a bank, gun fights, and more gun fights. Oh hell yeah! WWE's late Rowdy Roddy Piper (God rest his soul) gives off a fascinating performance as the alien slaying, no fooling around, borderline anti-hero, John Nada. The aliens looked pretty freakin creepy for having emotionless skull faces. Some people even believe there's a deeper meaning to the story with a real life lesson to it. I'll leave that part up to you. Overall, They Live is a 5/5 fun and exciting little adventure to add to your collection. If for nothing else, buy this to hear Piper give his infamous ""all out of bubble gum"" line.",1446336000,,2405,4.696682464454977

The political satire is (unfortunately for us) more true now than it was when the film was first made. Keith David and Roddy Piper share a macho chemistry not unlike Riggs and Murtaugh from Lethal Weapon if it were soaked in testosterone with a dash of 'roid rage for good measure. The simple plot is mostly just a vehicle for the ever-poignant message of distrust for the unholy alliance of media and politics that subverts the free will of the masses to keep them docile and compliant (for the benefit of their alien overlords in this case).

Some thing is wrong with authority, something feels wrong about the focus and direction of those in authority....oh, yeah, they're aliens!  And we must defeat them in the most ridiculous of ways, fighting to the top of a building to stop their signal.  The last scene is so 80s I can hardly stand it, but Rowdy somehow makes it all work.  The fight scene between Roddy and Keith David drags on and on, but we remember Roddy for the WWF wrestling behavior that launched his career.  Watch it, listen and enjoy, there are some serious and valuable truths in the flick, interlaced with lots of 80s damage.

965665,5,6305077754,"This is a classic B-movie that establishes a real sense of atmosphere and is honestly a lot of fun.  The fight scene between Roddy Piper and Keith David, I feel, was a great way to show a break through between two men who don't know each other but will become brothers-in-arms.  But this was made in the late eighties, so the scene goes on all day and is pretty hilarious when it refuses to end over and over again.  Also, notice how Keith David's character mentions the equivalent of corporate bailouts leading to the recession they're in.  This was made 20 years before the bailouts from 2008 happened en-masse.  Metaphors for real life society abound in this flick.",1432944000,3,668,4.627118644067797

Piper is the perfect leading man in this movie and does a great job of portraying the working man who is struggling to find steady job.  The movie has a 50's vibe to it and reminds me of ""It Came From Outer Space"" and ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"".  I love most of Carpenter's work and this one is one of his best (right up there with ""The Thing"" and ""Escape from New York"").

965793,4,6305077754,"John Carpenter's 'They Live' is a film that had trouble finding an audience at first, but in the 18 years since its release has shown to be a film that has aged very gracefully with a story that, at it's heart, contains a fair bit of truth about the world we live in, and in turn weaves a pretty interesting tale.

The plot is fairly simple - a drifter known only as Nada stumbles upon a group of small time revolutionaries bent on exposing the reality of life as we know it. With the help of special sunglasses, Nada is able to see that the world we live in is nothing like we perceive it. There is subliminal advertising everywhere and certain people who look human, are in fact, aliens. Nada makes it his mission to find out the source of this charade and destroy it, thus exposing the aliens for what they truly are to the unaware public.

The story, although a pretty straightforward Sci-Fi script in some respects, has many undertones aimed at the Reagan 1980's - mainly the perception that the rich get richer and the poor get poorer and that the upper 5% forces the lower classes to stay lower, living paycheck to paycheck while the upper 5% get wealthier and live more and more extravagantly. The story explores this concept by introducing the aliens as the upper 5% (with some humans allowed to bask in the wealth as well in return for their silence) who use subliminal advertising and a satellite signal to effectively render Humans into a state of conscious hypnosis, masking the true world around them and fooling them into believing the world to be normal, when it is anything but - in fact, it's my belief that the Wachowski brothers expanded on this very idea for their Matrix films.

What Carpenter was able to produce was a solid movie, with a strong script, and surprisingly good acting from Pro Wrestling Legend 'Rowdy' Roddy Piper and a good supporting cast including Keith David, Meg Foster, Peter Jason, and George 'Buck' Flower. 'They Live' is a film that will live on and on thanks to these components which Carpenter was able to weave together so masterfully.",1428278400,9,2085,4.599462365591398

It is also marred by inconsistent performances that prevent it from being either serious or campy.

THEY LIVE: Carpenters working class paranoid fantasy is satire as dark, funny and violent as his Escape From New York. Its a throwback to grade-Z sci-fi flicks of the 50s, but with a modern twist: a parody of simple minds searching for concrete, simple-minded solutions to the complex problems of a crazy economy and a society gone insane. What simpler solution could there be than evil aliens conspiring with the greedy, traitorous human power elite to sell humanity out for a Rolex and a taste of the Good Life? Any literal-minded xenophobe can understand that! And of course the lower-class cattle have to be kept sedated with hypnotic TV and subliminal advertising.

966291,5,6305077754,"Released in November of 1988, director John Carpenter's They Live may be the film of its generation. Well, if it's not then it's pretty close. John Carpenter is mostly known for the box office smash hit Halloween (1978) and as great as that film is (it's my favorite film), They Live is proof that the horror master had more to offer, along with a lot of other gems like Escape From New York (1981), The Thing (1982), Big Trouble In Little China (1986), In The Mouth Of Madness (1995), Escape From L.A. (1996) and Vampires (1998), They Live ranks on the list of his best films. What makes Carpenter so unique is that he really understood where Hollywood was heading during the late 70s and most of the 80s and for a short period of time he got his taste of Hollywood. He then realized that it simply only cares about making money and he spent the rest of his career as a true independent, not following any rules and making movies the way that he wanted to.

Carpenter was riding on the success of Halloween, which was in its day the highest grossing independent film ever made. Escape From New York was another hit movie and by this time he was getting major studio offerings. He then directed his first big studio picture The Thing. This film was expected to be a commercial hit but unfortunately, the film was a disaster and was even considered one of the most hated films by critics and audiences alike. Although The Thing has found a cult audience over the years, it was the film that launched a series of commercial failures from the director.

Carpenter was feeling frustrated with the way the studio system was heading so he decided to make a film that expressed this which is where They Live comes in. This film may be one of the bravest movies in its day. During the 1980s, we were being told to do nothing but consume. This film is a study of the world being corrupt by the media and how it tells us to simply not care and just make tons of money. The middle class are portrayed as villains in the film and that being rich and successful is the only way to be happy while poor working class people are being treated as useless. We all believe that fame and fortune is what makes us somebody but Carpenter wasn't about to become a sell out and instead he dealt with his frustration by making this film and when you look at it now you can't help but think what an honest direction that was to go in.

But this movie isn't just for deep thinkers, it is also a kick ass sci-fi action movie and it's a lot of fun too. Sure, the movie is goofy at times and very B movie material but to me that's a positive aspect, I think that was the perfect way to portray the story. I would put this movie up there with A Clockwork Orange (1971) even, as pretentious as that sounds.",1419292800,29,2774,4.320537428023033

966540,5,6305077754,"Great cult classic sic-fi film.  I think this film was ahead of its time, but also timeless in many ways.  The overarching plot, themes, undertones, and overtones all match up with things people are just beginning to piece together now, in fragments.  At the same time, there are very memorable segues containing action and very classic one-liners that have been paid homage to in many TV shows and Hollywood films ever since, but you probably didn't realize they came from this film.  With such a low budget, they had to be very creative, and you would never guess this from the visual/AV production, which looks as good as anything big budget.  But through that creativity a lot of novel ideas appeared in this film before their times.  A film, ""Branded"", which fell through the cracks and received poor reviews, did similar things, nearly 25 years later.  And yet, this film was on average highly praised by critics.  Like most great films, it's best watched if you don't watch trailers, don't read about it on the internet, and don't spoil it for yourself; just go wit the flow.  And a great flow it has.

In some ways, perhaps in another universe, you can easily see from his sci-fi work that Carpenter would have been a top notch director for big budget films of the time, like Terminator 2, etc; but he stuck to what he wanted to do and the messages he wanted to get across.

One other analogy that comes to mind when watching this film, not so much in content or plot, but conceptually, is Idiocracy.  If you enjoyed that film, you will probably dig this a lot.  Idiocracy made such great social commentary that it was well finished, and a great film, but ultimately the studio dropped all marketing money and efforts, because they feared alienating their core (masses) base of TV viewers.  In other words, they thought the film was too intelligent to show.  You get that feeling here; the film did well (made a profit), got great reviews, etc, but is scarcely heard of.  Definitely worth a watch if you are a sci-fi fan.  Some of the best stuff came out of the very late 80s going into the big progressive world of the 90s (especially for sci-fi; Star Trek: TNG, anyone?); a time which is only really paralleled in recent history by the 60s.  This film may have fallen through the cracks, but thankfully, Amazon has it available in its catalogue for rental!",1414022400,3,2366,4.619617224880383

But *They Live* is uniquely creative ~ with deep angles of political economy, metaphysics and horror entangled with a sci-fi type theme. I would go so far as to class this film with the classic book *Man in the High Castle* for being entertaining ~ while being at least as enlightening as to deep aspects of reality. They both seem *surreal*~ yet maybe just because being *so real*l.

966989,5,6305077754,"What an incredible allegorical fiction.  This is a masterpiece, and should be required viewing for every student in school.

Don't let the B-grade acting throw you off.  The plot and the symbolic breakdown of how the world really works are unmatched in insight and accuracy, and make this movie one of my all-time favorites.

The central concept is brilliant: ""Putting on glasses that let you see reality"".  Looking through them at money, and seeing the words ""This is Your God"", show a deep understanding of the Great Slavery Religions (Money, and Authority) used to control us, through our belief in them.  It also highlights the shadow world of the controllers, hidden but among us, as well as how they keep the masses in line - through subliminal messages, television, spying, drones, police and laws.

John Carpenter was clearly in-touch with Truth and what is really going on in this world, and it shows in this timeless masterpiece.",1405728000,6,939,4.942675159235669
966990,5,6305077754,"John Carpenter wrote and directed his second and last feature in the ill-fated Alive Films deal. This flick was a fun alien invasion, Sci-Fi/Action flick based on the short story Eight O'Clock In The Morning by Ray Nelson. Carpenter also mixed in some deft messages about class warfare and how the rich and powerful manipulate the government and media to reduce the rest of us to little more then slaves... a message even more relevant today then it was in 1988, with big corporations running our media and, to be honest, our government... but I digress...

The story focuses on unemployed construction worker John Nada (Roddy Piper) who through a series of events comes across a pair of special sunglasses that let him see the world for what it truly is, an alien run society where humans who collaborate and cooperate are made rich and powerful and those who don't, are coerced by subliminal messages placed in all the media to basically follow orders and do what they are told. If you're not one of the haves, you're little more then a have-not slave. Nada has nothing else to lose so, he decides to join a growing underground rebellion and fight back, taking reluctant friend Frank (Keith David) and accidental hostage Holly (Meg Foster) along for the ride. But, the aliens are everywhere and so are the traitorous humans that have sold out and John Nada and Co. have some pretty big odds to overcome if they are to find and eliminate the beings' hypnotic signal and wake the world up from it's alien induced slumber.

They Live may not be Carpenter's strongest work but, it is still a fan favorite and a lot of fun. The film moves fast and there is a lot of suspenseful action including a now classic fistfight between ""Rowdy"" Roddy Piper and The Thing's Keith David and the gunfight finale inside a cable TV office building. As usual Carpenter gives the film a nice look on a low budget with Gary B. Kibbe once again filling former Carpenter DOP Dean Cundey's shoes nicely with some beautiful camerawork. The political messages are a little heavy-handed but, there is enough action and aliens to even it out and the film has some really nice SPFX for a very modestly budgeted film especially those that portray the real world as seen through the signal blocking glasses. The film has some clunky dialog and it could have used some more time within the workings of the rebellion to get us a bit more endeared to the freedom fighters before they clash with the invaders but, the focus is on Nada and Frank and it is they who are left with the task of taking the bizarre invaders down and the film does have some very uniquely designed extraterrestrials to act as our villains. It is both one of Carpenter's lighter films and yet, ironically, one of his most politically and socially critical. As, despite the dire message, the film also has a very satirical sense of humor as well and that helps us past some of it's flaws as it doesn't take itself too seriously that we don't have a good time watching Piper run out of bubblegum and kick ass.

And as for our leading man, Piper does OK here. Carpenter hired him because he felt he had a look of someone who has lived a hard life and that works in the case of down on his luck Nada. Piper isn't the best actor but, he holds his on especially during the action scenes and only stumbles a little in some of the more dialog heavy moments. Kurt Russell would have been prefect but, Piper works better than expected. Keith David is good as always. He makes Frank a likable and honorable man but, one who we believe doesn't take any crap from anyone. Foster is a little stiff as Holly but, since she plays a woman thrust into a very surreal situation, it almost fits the part. There are also some solid small roles from frequent Carpenter collaborators like Peter Jason as the rebellion leader Gilbert and George `Buck' Flower as a homeless man who discovers the benefit of playing nice with the ruling alien elite. Carpenter and associate Alan Howarth again deliver a memorable score to support the film.

They Live is now considered a cult classic and I certainly agree. While it may have some familiar elements and common themes, it still comes across as a unique little movie and one with an important message that still resonates well over two decades later. And despite it's message being a large part of the film's plot, Carpenter wraps it with a fun, Action/ Sci-Fi coating to make it easily digestible. Piper may not have been the strongest actor to cast in the lead but, he does carry the flick and it's fun to watch him have a good time with the part even if he stumbles a bit in the film's more serious moments. Not Carpenter's best flick but, still very enjoyable and once again another film that has found it's audience years later. Again John Carpenter proves he is a director who is well ahead of his time.

In any case, it is a very interesting movie and worth at least one viewing if you are at all into sci-fi, John Carpenter or Roddy Piper.  The basic premise is that Piper plays a character name Nada, a drifter who comes to Los Angeles to find construction work; he ends up falling into much more.  He eventually finds a box of special sunglasses near a homeless shelter he frequents.

 The glasses give him the extraordinary ability to see what is actually real, since in this movie aliens have inhabited the world and have blinded every human by making themselves appear human-like and hiding other things(such as their space-ships and hidden subliminal messages in normal advertising).  Along the way he meets a character played by David Keith or Keith David(one is black and the other is not, I forget which is which) and forces him to put on the glasses by beating him in an awesome eight minute street fight.

They both decide to gather some weapons and somehow find out the truth and possibly take down these aliens.  In between, there are scenes of Roddy Piper using the glasses to rob a bank and rough up some police officer-aliens.  Along the way, they find a resistance group that gathers in secret and attempts to manufacture and distribute the sunglasses to anyone willing to accept.

Overall, the movie seems like a twilight zone episode which is good and bad.  I enjoyed it and found it entertaining so I didn't mind the somewhat campy style.  I felt the story was interesting, a parable of 1980s America, showing the not so great side to Regan era policies, showing the effects on the street level folk.  It's a fun type of 80s style movie, typical of John Carpenter.  If you're a fan of him, Piper of the story, then give it try.",1402099200,2,1807,4.588785046728972

967415,4,6305077754,"John Carpenter's ""They Live"" is the most fun of his science fiction movies, featuring Roddy Piper in a movie role that actually fits him like a Malaysian toboggan. I actually felt that with ""The Thing"" Carpenter was losing his way, but that film actually shows that he understands how to do remakes successfully and add something unique to them along the way. ""They Live"", despite its obviousness and striving for a social message, is a restoration of respect for Carpenter, who pulls out all the stops here. Not nearly as insulting as its reputation would suggest for a ""sci-fi"" programmer, the script plays with ideas about subliminal messages and red herrings and shows that not all action-spectacle movies have to be completely idiot. There isn't much of a message to his ""message"", but Carpenter has fun with the actors, the set pieces, and the film's paranoid sense of humor. This is not an essential film, but it's another interesting curio of Carpenter's.
The Shout! release is the typical extraordinary work that they usually display, and the interview with Carpenter is enjoyable (he produces a unique response after being asked if any efforts were made to trim the ridiculously over the top ""fight sequence""). Overall, this is a light film with some interesting ideas going on in it, but there's enough entertainment value to keep one watching. B-",1392076800,,1358,4.986784140969163

It kind of reminds me of some of the old Scifi movies

967577,3,6305077754,"They Live, sadly, is one of my least favorite John Carpenter films.  It is a shame because, like with most of his films, They Live has a great premise.  The problem is that most of the characters, save one, I do not care for.  The main character especially got on my nerves half way through the film.  The way it ends is a bit anti-climactic as well.

The film stars a drifter named Nada, played by Roddy Piper.  He comes to this out-of-the-way workplace looking for a job.  There he meets a man named Frank, played by Keith David.  Nada then comes across a group of mysterious people lurking around with boxes filled with sunglasses.  After a riot breaks out he puts on the one pair of the sunglasses, and through them he sees an entirely different world.  He comes to realize that aliens have enslaved humanity without them even realizing it.  They can only be seen in their true form with the sunglasses.  Nada then tries to get Frank on his side but he thinks he is crazy at first.  However, Frank eventually joins up with him and, together with a group of resistance fighters, they must free the world.

There are many good things about the film.  The premise is interesting.  The makeup effects for the aliens themselves look fine.  I also like Keith David in the film.  He is a great actor and has a great voice.  I like that over the years he has grown in popularity a bit.

However, the rest of the cast I do not care for.  I liked the main character, Nada, in the beginning, but later on he kind of annoyed me.  Roddy Piper does a so-so job acting wise.  He was not bad but he was not that good either.  Once he finds out about the aliens and their takeover he does the dumbest thing ever.  He breaks into a bank armed and shoots all the aliens disguised as humans painting as a crazy maniac, and now everyone is after him.  I understand that he is in shock, but he should have handled everything with more of a cool head.  When he confronts Frank again and Frank thinks he is crazy I do not blame him.  If Nada had handled everything with a cool head he could have made everything easier on himself.

The other characters are not even worth mentioning.  The effects are not bad, but they are pretty subpar.  They are nothing compared to the effects in The Thing or Starman.  While the makeup effects were good, I do not care for the design of the aliens.  The ending was a bit anti-climactic too.

Overall, They Live is not bad.  I think that, if you are a fan of John Carpenters other films, then this is worth at least one viewing.  However, compared to most of his other work, I felt that this was subpar.",1385769600,,2619,4.305954825462012

The underlayer, the message at the core of this film demands attention & earnest consideration.
You won't quite look at your town the same again, likely to be disgusted by the maelstrom of consumerism and blind devotion to it surrounding you. Whatever happens with the plot in the movie, we have no Roddy Piper to subvert the powers that be, from imposing this superficial, artificial and disparate societal edifice we pulsate in. And that should frighten us.

If society were truly free, we'd screen ""They Live"" instead of Schindler's List or Forrest Gump during grade school lunchtimes. But we're not free, we're indoctrinated by an increasingly dense and suffocating social mechanism, the strings of which only the soulless class move by their design, for their own motives. Yea, the film is violent (with one fight scene lasting what feel like 10 minutes), but rebellions usually are--it's not to take away from the message: wake the F* up!!

The youth should see this movie to develop a healthly repudiation of consumer-culture and it's unerring influence on impressionable minds.

So, following this extended character development, when the plot turns to a scene in which city authorities openly escalate their crackdown on the homeless camp with bulldozers and helicopters--he expected that we should be appalled at the callousness shown these many victims that we now know--and we are.  Further, Carpenter established those hopeless conditions as a backdrop for a strong friendship between the two main characters (Piper and David)--this relationship needs to be solidified because things will get worse from that point.  Once the film begins moving, however, it tends to keep the intrigue/suspense level high.  After an epiphany (involving the infamous glasses) and a decision to directly confront the ""bad guys"" (no spoilers here), Roddy Piper delivers easily the best line of the movie.  Soon after, you hope Roddy has a few more brilliant deliveries to give--but, the movie writers fail to provide a follow up.  The rest of the movie has action (ex., wrestling moves!), suspense, reversals in fortune, and a final plot twist.  Hence, it is still watchable all the way through.

An interesting, primary theme of this work is the constant tension between freedom and control--the question:  is the more perfect society the one that offers the most freedom (but more chaos and more poverty), or the one that establishes order and peace (at the cost of independent thought and action).  How the director visually presents these themes and what the characters representing each side say (and how their statements provide clues into whether those allegiances are motivated by self-interest or altruism) are redeeming qualities of this film.  That and other themes present like alienation and belonging, social stratification, etc., make this movie hard to place in a particular box.

""They Live"" is often classified into the horror genre because Carpenter directed it, but it is much more than that.  I thought ""they"" were not intimidating, but kind of funny; my wife, on the other hand, was very grossed-out by the appearance of ""them"", but she enjoyed the fighting and gun play (she's a Bruce Willis fan).  Then, there was an unexpected and brief gratuitous sex scene of a few seconds long (well, that may seem to move it back toward the modern horror flick class); it occurred near the end of the story and it seemed somewhat out of place compared to the rest of the film--IMO, it should have been cut and left on the screening room floor even though the scene was an attempt to lighten up the mood--or to ensure an ""R"" rating.

Anyway, after writing this much (too much), I think I will stop and go watch the movie again.",1374796800,3,2932,4.975409836065574

Rowdy Roddy Piper proves that you can take the wrestler out of the ring, but you can't take the ring out of the wrestler in this 1980's cult-classic. His is one of many silly performances found in THEY LIVE, along with the consistently bad fight choreography and cheesy one-liners that only add to the film's overall charm. If there's one thing fan's know, it's that Piper has ""come here to chew bubblegum and kick ass... and [he's] all out of bubblegum."" John Carpenter brings the eerie dystopian future of Ray Nelson's short ""Eight O'Clock in the Morning"" to life using a frequent shift from color to black and white as Nada (Piper) puts on his specially-designed sunglasses. Suddenly, the billboards and signposts are exposed to reveal the aliens' subliminal mind-control devices that command their human cattle to ""OBEY"" and ""CONSUME."" In this way, THEY LIVE is a perfect reflection of the consumerist culture found under the Reagan era, with social and political implications that also recall INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS from both 1956 and 1978. Although THEY LIVE has a much lesser impact than the aforementioned films, the dark comedic undertones make it easily-digestible and light-hearted.

968584,3,6305077754,"John Carpenter had his tongue firmly planted in his cheek when he came up with his satire on government control and consumerism, even going so far as to cast wrestler (and Frogtown ""Hell-bringer""), Rowdy Roddy Piper in the lead role as ""Nada"". Nada is a drifter who finds out, with the aid of a pair of special sunglasses, about a bunch of aliens that are secretly controlling humanity for their own gain. Along the way he enlists the help of the always watchable Keith David, after some knuckle persuasion, and together they try and end the aliens grip on mankind.

While there's an awful lot of Carpenter in the film, 'They Live' is really a mish-mash of a couple of other stories, 'Eight O'Clock in the Morning' by Ray Nelson and a comic book story called 'Nada'. But it was Carpenter's growing hated for rampant 80's consumerism that really fueled the film.

Piper does fine in his role and sort of suits the type of picture that 'They Live' is. His delivery is sometimes off and some of his lines are really silly, but coupled with Keith David, the pair carry off their duties well enough. Also included is Meg Foster and her weird eyes, but there's not much for her to do here and there's some of the usual Carpenter regulars, like Peter Jason ('Prince of Darkness', 'In the Mouth of Madness').

Made on a budget of $3.000.000, the effects are economical and the decision to film the ""reality"" viewed through Piper's special sunglasses in B+W was probably a wise one as I'd imagine that the aliens make-up wouldn't stand up to too much scrutiny.

I have to admit, for years I disliked 'They Live' intensely, but like all of John Carpenter's film it rewards subsequent viewings. It's as preposterous as it is stupid and the film, as a whole isn't very tight. But over the years, I've come to really like it and now rate it as one of my favorites from that particular director. Although, I really wish that he would get back to the brilliance of 'The Thing'. But I won't be holding my breath on that one.

Even with the negatives though, 'They Live' remains a witty, very enjoyable picture and it doesn't outstay its welcome.

The radical preacher warns us of carbon emissions and global warming that are making the world less habitable for humans but more habitable for the aliens, who have come for our resources in a thinly-veiled attack on colonialism.  Of course mindless entertainment -- via TV -- keep the populace in line and blinded to the truth of the alien takeover.

We seem to live in the wealth oriented and dazed society reflected in the movie even more now than before.  Less values, more mindless involvement with even more technology, it goes on and on.  And now the ""aliens"" have the added benefit of the divide and conquer element to count on.
Not meant to be a social commentary, but the film is a true gem and I'm ordering the Collector's Edition once I wrap this up.  In the not so serious vein....the fight scene between Keith David and Piper is priceless and must have been demanding on them to film as well as great fun!  David and others who are staples in Carpenter's films due their expected best and the whole thing is just a blast to watch!  I have all the Carpenter Films and personally his version of ""The Thing"" is my personal favorite film of all.

What if an alien civilization, who has infiltrated Earth and have devised a means of putting messages inside everyday things: advertisements with subliminal messages--but designed to serve alien purposes, magazine articles, and even people, who walk among humans are seen to look like humans, but they are really aliens.

What if you suddenly wear special glasses and see all things alien?

That is the problem of Nada (Roddy Piper), who is a construction worker and comes across one of these glasses and becomes determined to save humanity.  Along with a fellow construction worker, Frank (Keith David) and a grassroots movement, they set to save the ""developing planet"" from alien invasion.

There is one fighting scene between Nada and Frank that ought to be classic in history of movie making. It is very well choreographed, and very long, but you don't really get tired of watching. They fight because Nada wants Frank to wear a pair of glasses :)

There is comedy, horror, violence, and many other human behaviors.

This release of They Live goes way beyond putting things right; firstly let me say that the print is stunning. It looks like it was shot yesterday. Colours are clear and vivid but not overblown. Detail is excellent and whilst some pleasing film grain is present it does not take over the picture.

The sound is similarly good throughout and you get a commentary carried over from the laser disc and DVD versions.

The extras are interesting - and best of all is a short but fascinating monologue by actor Keith David - the first time Ive seen him as himself and my only regret is that the piece is not longer as he comes across as charming and interesting. THere's some other new material although sadly not featuring Roddy Piper.

Its worth the price of admission for Carpenter's interview and his reaction to the question ""Did you ever consider cutting the duration of the fight? "" ""*$@* No!"" is his brilliant reply.

Luckily, the film doesn't force any politics on the viewers. If you're looking for an entertaining sci-fi action flick, that's exactly what you'll get.

The HD transfer looks good - I'd give it a 3.5 out of 5 - and the extras are top notch. Only complaint is the star Roddy Piper only participates in an audio commentary with Carpenter. I would have loved an on-camera interview with him.

968970,5,6305077754,"I've been holding off on getting the bare bones DVD of They Live for years now as it's been known that Carpenter and Roddy Piper recorded a commentary track for an upcoming special edition release nearly a decade ago.  The film looks as good as it ever will.  The fact is this was a film made on the cheap, and at times it shows, but thankfully the low budget actually adds to the B movie feel of the film.  To my untrained eye the transfer looks great on my LG 55"" running through a PS3.
  This is not a jam-packed Special Edition as there's just not that much vintage material available, but what material is on the disc is great.  New interviews with Carpenter, Keith David (Frank), Meg Foster and many behind-the-scenes crewmembers offer some great insight into the film, but oddly Roddy Piper is totally absent.  This is odd for the fact that he did take part in the commentary track and does make himself available for interviews, but again the commentary track was recorded many years ago while the new interviews look fairly recent, so maybe he just wasn't available at the time.  Edited throughout the new interviews are some vintage making-of and behind-the-scenes footage.
  Overall this is the best Special Edition for this film we could have hoped for.  Finally, the blu-ray features a slip-cover with newly made design art.  It's got that wonderful B movie feel to it, and to top it off the makers poke some fun at retailers HORRIBLE habit of placing advertising stickers all over slipcovers with a simple white BUY sticker, a wonderul touch.  My only true complaint is that I wish the original poster art would make been on the actual blu-ray case under the slipcover.  An extremely minor complaint, just a personal preference.  Overall this a great package that I can't recommend enough.

968978,3,6305077754,"John Carpenter has an interesting track record of films. Many are considered cult classics like ""Halloween,"" ""The Thing,"" and ""Escape from New York."" Others are held in high esteem by some and shunned by others. I'm referring to ""The Fog,"" ""Prince of Darkness,"" and ""Vampires."" A select few are seen as outright disasters. One prime example everyone would agree on would be ""Ghosts of Mars."" A film that seems to fall just a little shy of being considered a shining example of his work is ""They Live.""

Two drifters try to make ends meet while working construction and living in a shanty town. One of the men, Nada (Roddy Piper), begins to notice suspicious activities occurring in the church across the street. He investigates and finds a small group of people who discovered aliens have taken over the world and dominate us subliminally through hidden messages delivered via television, billboards, newspapers, and magazines. The only way someone can see who is or isn't an alien is by putting on sunglasses that act as x-rays and expose the otherworldly intruders. Nada must find a way to convince his friends and fight back against the evil beings.

It's obvious that writer Frank Armitage is using aliens as a representation of corporations, the government, and the controlling upper class in ""They Live."" He clearly has issues with anyone trying to oppress the ""little"" guy or the less fortunate. His story works beautifully as a sort of parable exposing this idea.

Where the movie breaks down is in its pacing. The set-up, beginning, and end of the film move along quite nicely. Things start to drag a bit in some middle spots, but it doesn't completely ruin the viewing experience. It redeems itself every time the sunglasses are put on and we get a glimpse ""behind the curtain.""

The age of ""They Live"" is clearly seen in its visual effects. The alien faces look like rubber masks but still look good for a low-budget sci-fi / horror film in 1988. This doesn't make it unwatchable. If anything, it adds a feeling of nostalgia and appreciation for this genre masterwork.

The high-definition transfer gives viewers a chance to see the movie in a way it's never been watched before. You get a clean picture which still holds on to its authentic film glory. The audio presentation is 2.0, which will disappoint many fans who would like to utilize all the speakers in their home theater with a 5.1 surround sound mix.

John Carpenter enthusiasts will be happy to see the director has provided a new interview for the Blu-ray release of ""They Live."" Audio commentary by director Carpenter and actor Roddy Piper will have fans salivating over the special features as well. There's also a ""Making of 'They Live'"" featurette, theatrical trailer, TV spot, and more.

Although I wouldn't put ""They Live"" on the same level as ""The Fog"" or ""Halloween,"" it still deserves a mid-range spot in John Carpenter's repertoire. This will surely be a welcome addition to any Carpenter fan's home entertainment library. Its elegant video transfer and disappointing yet acceptable 2.0 audio combined with some great bonus material makes this new ""Collector's Edition"" Blu-ray a worthy purchase for any sci-fi or horror aficionado.",1353369600,,3217,4.935304990757856

When drifter Nada (former wrestler Roddy Piper)discovers a pair of specially treated sunglasses he also uncovers a conspiracy by creepy looking creatures to control humanity and lull us into conplacency so they can rule over us. Nada gains a reluctant partner in Frank (Keith David from ""The Thing"")when Nada forces him to wear the sunglasses and ""see"" the world for what it really is.

Unfortunately this deluxe Blu is Region A locked for those overseas however if you have a multi-region player, you can enjoy the movie just be aware of this prior to purchasing. I suspect that Universal either plans on releasing this overseas at some point (""They Live"" was much more popular overseas than in the U.S. both during the initial release and on DVD as it got a deluxe 2 DVD release about a decade ago)or that they have licensed it so another company.

Shot for under $5 million ""They Live"" is an amusing mixture of social commentary, action and science fiction.

John Carpenter's cult classic ""They Live"" arrives with a really good looking Blu-ray and, although it's not perfect (grain is inconsistent in some parts of the beginning but, on the whole, it looks pretty good. There are some bits of dirt here and there, some noticeable use of digital noise reduction, edge enhancement, etc but that's usually fleeting and not on the screen for very long. Overall Shout Factory has done a superb job of bringing this edition to Blu-ray (I suspect that Universal already had prepared the film for high definition and that Shout Factory was given what they already had).

We also get a (I'm assuming) newly remixed 5.1 lossless presentation of the soundtrack. It isn't quite as active as a more contemporary film but it's quite good. We also get the original 2.0 presentation in lossless audio as well. There are English subtitles for the film.

We get a number of very cool extras for this set including the commentary track for the overseas DVD (we never got it here in the U.S.) as well as the original featurette produced for the film back in the day, new interviews with actress Meg Foster, Keith David (both of whom talk about the political undercurrent and satire in the film which evidently most critics somehow missed back in the day or felt was too broad) and John Carpenter. We also get an interview with Gary Kibbs who shot the film for Carpenter, stunt coordinator Jeff Imada and co-composer Alan Howarth all reflecting on the making of the film and, yep, making the accurate obersvation that it's even MORE relevent NOW than in the 1980's (or as Carpenter comments in his interview ""we're still in the 80's"").

The cover is reversible with the specially commissed garish (in a good way--it fits the feel of the film)cover on both the cardboard sleeve (with a clever ""Obey"" sticker on it)cover on the outside and one that uses the original poster (and DVD cover for the U.S.) in the inside. Kudos to Shout Factory for doing such a superb job with this set and doing more than just a bare bones release as happened in the U.S. previously.

For those who haven't seen the film but want to pick it up based on its reputation I would keep in mind that Carpenter uses a deliberate pacing creating a sense of suspense and almost a slow burn by the conclusion. Keep in mind also that although it has great production values with every dollar on screen, this is a low budget affair compared to other Carpenter films so the scale is reduced accordingly.

Piper is fine as the lead and projects an innocence that works for the character but I can't help wishing that Kurt Russell had played the role. Keith David is, as usual outstanding. Why David didn't receive more work after ""The Thing"" and this (he's still working by the way) is beyond me as he's an intelligent, powerful actor that easily matches someone like Samuel L. Jackson for his confidence and skills as a performer. Meg Foster is quite good but I do wish that her character had been fleshed out a bit more and it would have been nice to discover more about the underground movement. I suspect that the underdevelopment of the underground movement has more to do with budget constraints than anything else. These are all minor criticisms for a film that, on the whole, is exceptionally good.

Highly recommended for fans of John Carpenter and science fiction fans.",1352332800,6,4460,4.69309462915601
969044,5,6305077754,"So we watched it this weekend.

Few things.  Above everything else, the movie looks so fricken amazing! The conversion to Blu-Ray is remarkable.  It literally looked like it was filmed on an IMAX camera.  Ok, maybe not THAT good, but amazing for a 30 year old movie!  I kept saying, look at Roddy's facial scars!  Look at his manny, it's so amazingly flow-ie!

The bonus commentary by Carpenter, Keith David (best of the 3) and the girl with the funky blue eyes was pretty cool - I'm just bummed that Roddy didn't do an interview.  He must have wanted too much money or something.  I'm really sad he wasn't in there - the only disappointment I have.

It was really interesting, my buddy said he'd stay to see like the beginning, he thought he had seen it already and wasn't too stoked on it.  That alone almost cost him a friendship, but we carried on despite his rude blasphemy in mine own house!  But, by the time Roddy started shooting people at the bank he realized that he hadn't seen it at all.  After that he was hooked!  He was like, holy ****, this is a great, aliens?!  He's also in the movie business and was like, that scene where they repackaged an entire store to have the subliminal messages all over the place, ""that must have been a major pain"".

I watched this movie when it came out in the theater and didn't pay attention to the messege then as I do now. You see, I was asleep back then but I stopped watching TV about 15 years ago. In this movie the Aliens are the controllers of the human race. This is so true today how government controls you. When you are a infant they start with mandatory ""immuization shots"" and then your ""recommended"" anual follow up flu shot. I call these your ""stupid shots"" which expains the rise in autism since immuzation started. Then you continue your life through the mandatory government ""indoctrination"" or ""the government screwling system"", it totally lacks training of critical thinking and individualism. Now after you feel you've had enough screwling you continue your life as a peon worker for the government. So watch plenty of government controlled media TV, waste your day on Facebook and other social sites, Play video games and for heaven's sake, don't use your brain !",1348358400,4,1157,5.362637362637362

9/12: Rowdy Roddy Piper stars in They Live. If you don't know who is that, obviously you aren't familiar with the WWF. If you don't know what's that, forget it. I wonder if he might have made a good second choice in Escape from New York. Anyway, I do like a lot of the interesting concepts presented in the film. In a philosophical sense, it is like watching Invasion of the Body Snatchers meets The Thing minus the gore. I read somewhere that The Thing, Prince of the Darkness, and In the Mouth of Madness comprise John Carpenter's Apocalypse Trilogy, but really, They Live should be considered. On the other hand, the reason for the loss of points in my rating is that some of the scenes, most notably the fight between Piper and David Keith's characters, took a lot of energy away from the film. Moreover, I see Piper robbing a bank, packing an arsenal of guns, yet he gets away with it? It will never happen. Consider the number of mutants in the world, killing a few of them isn't quite going to solve the problem. It should have been done by a mass effort worldwide. Finally, John Carpenter solves the problem by taking out the link between two worlds. However, is that subject to one region?

969187,5,6305077754,"They Live (1988) is among a series of cult classic films directed by John Carpenter in a 12-year stretch from the mid 70s to the late 80s. This one feels like his best. Made for next-to-nothing, with a cast of virtual unknowns, and cheap-looking (yet somehow cool!) special effects, the movie on the surface seems like any other 80s campfest. But from the start, it paints a very bleak picture that the world is in dire straits, being slowly drained of it's humanity and individuality due to rabid consumerism and capitalism. A street preacher and pirated broadcast are the 2 main voices of doom, warning the world that the apocalypse is near.

Enter our hero, a character whose name we never know, played exceptionally well by former wrestling star Roddy Piper. Piper's character is homeless and drifts into the big city looking for work. He gets a job as a construction worker and is befriended by a fellow down-and-out compadre (effectively played by Keith David). The 2 men develop a convincing connection as they can relate to each other's plight. Pretty soon Piper's no-name character discovers a secret underground that is battling an almost invisible enemy....aliens walking around looking like humans. The only way to really ""see"" them is through special sunglasses created by the underground rebels. Also, we ""see"" subliminal messages everywhere: on billboards, in magazines, on street signs....everywhere!

Our hero immediately investigates and jumps into the fray, taking up arms, going on a one-man alien-killing spree before he escapes and joins the rebels in hopes of defeating the alien threat. Along the way he meets a beautiful woman (well-played in ambiguous fashion by 80s stunner Meg Foster) who works for the local newstation that is the key to exposing the alien threat to the world.

Carpenter injects this tongue-in-cheek tale with a real sense of doom and dread that underscores it's B-movie atmoshpere, which is all too apparent. Thankfully, it is the satire that wins out in the end, leaving all the cheapness in the dust! The energetic lead performance by Piper, the in-your-face direction by Carpenter, the solid contributions by an inviting supporting cast, and most importantly, the core message behind this 80s cult classic make it immensely appealing!",1345161600,4,2285,5.137096774193548

Fr viele, die trge und desinteressiert an ihren eigenen Problemen und besonders, denen der anderen geworden sind, bedeutet die heimische Glotze das, was heute das Internet darstellt. berall ziehen ""Wanderarbeiter"" ber das Land. Einer von ihnen ist der arbeits, - und, meitens, auch obdachlose (Roderick George Toombs, - niemand anderes als der Wrestler ""Rowdy"" Roddy Piper) John Nada.

Dieser verschafft sich, in Los Angeles, Aushilfsarbeit auf einer Baustelle.

Abends nimmt ihn ein Kollege (Keith David) mit in eine kleine Barackensiedlung. Als dort aber noch in der Nacht pltzlich die Polizei auftaucht, und den Platz mit Bulldozern rumt, flchtet Nada in eine, nahegelegene Kirche. Dort im Keller angekommen, beobachtet er gerade noch paar Menschen, die sich jetzt auch sehr verschwrerisch benehmen.

Er mu mit ansehen, wie ein blinder Priester drauen brutal von der Polizei zusammengeschlagen wird und es Massenverhaftungen, vllig ohne jeden ersichtlichen Grund, gibt. Weil er keinen ""rger"" mchte, verhlt er sich aber zunchst selber noch ruhig, hlt sich zurck. Neugierig ist er allerdings (geworden) ... und so, inspiziert er allein am nchsten Tag nochmal diesen Ort.

Als er wieder die Kirche verlassen will, entdeckt er jetzt einige Kartons voller Sonnenbrillen. Er nimmt sich davon eine mit und versteckt auch den Rest vorsorglich erstmal in einer Mlltonne.

Zurck in der Stadt, setzt er sie auf und ... von nun an bekommt er sehr verblffende Dinge zu Gesicht: die Werbeplakate z. B. zeigen ganz pltzlich keine Produkte mehr an, sondern, nur noch scheinbar ominse Befehle wie ""konsumiere"", ""gehorche"", ""schlafe"", ""sie fern"" oder ""keine unabhngigen Gedanken"" ...

 ... das gleiche in Zeitungen und, vor allem, im Fernsehen. Noch dazu, sehen einige Menschen pltzlich auch ganz anders aus. Sie alle haben auf einmal ganz fahle, wie verfault wirkende, graue Gesichter, die an Totenschdel erinnern. Aber, auch das Geld trgt Botschaften (""das ist euer Gott""). Farben verschwinden, - alles erscheint nur noch lediglich in schwarz - wei.

Auf den Laternen und Ampeln befinden sich kleine Parabolantennen, die ebenfalls einlullende Parolen permanent ausstrahlen. Die gesamte Bevlkerung ist also quasi unbemerkt manipuliert worden ... und wird wie in einem allgemeinen Dmmerzustand gehalten.

Nada erkennt, langsam aber sicher, da es sich hier um Auerirdische handelt, denen sogar manche Menschen anscheinend konspirativ dienen (und so bevorzugt behandelt werden). Doch diese entdecken ihn nun natrlich auch, da er sich aufllig verhlt, und machen Jagd auf ihn ...

Mehr, mchte ich bis hierhin erstmal nicht mehr verraten, da diesen Film aber ohnehin - fast - jeder kennt, ist sowas auch nicht notwendig.

Lange, sehr lange habe ich gezgert, eine wrdigende Rezension zu ""sie leben"" (aka ""they live"", - so lautet der Originaltitel dieses Carpenter Film's aus dem Jahre 1988) zu schreiben. Allerdings, auch stndig, immer wieder den Wunsch danach versprt. Ja, maches mal, kann ich mir selbst nicht meine derartig groe Faszination an diesem ansonsten recht simplen Streifen erklren. Aber, sie ist eben einfach da.

Und, war es bereits, gleich nach dem allerersten ansehen, damals schon, noch auf VHS. Aber, gerade hier, geht es ja, so wie mir, nun wirklich etlichen anderen ;-)

Was Regisseur John Carpenter hier, bereits lange vor ""Matrix"" usw., geschaffen hat, ist mehr als nur mit vergleichsweise einfachen Mitteln einen sehr guten Film abzuliefern. Es ist richtig, tauscht man dieses Alien Thema hier aus bzw. sieht die gezeigte Verschwrung mal als Metapher, oder auch, einfach nur als Parabel ... bleibt eine 100 prozentig, lupenreine Gesellschaftskritik brig !

Jeder mu, oder besser, sollte sich fragen, ob ihm hier nicht - zwar mit einem Augenzwinkern und ja, durchaus ironisch gemeint zu verstehen - recht subtil ein Spiegel vorgehalten wird. Das der Film damals floppte, scheint m. M.n. auch damit ganz besonders zusammen zu hngen !?

Although a little plodding at times, the execution is decent, as the level of action ramps up to excessive levels at the finish.

A man named Nada (Roddy Piper) drifts into the city, and finds work at a construction site.  With no place to stay, he hooks up with co-worker Frank Armitage (Keith David), and goes with him to a settlement of homeless people.  That night, Nada notices some odd activity at a nearby church.  Investigating the following day, Nada learns that some kind of secret meeting is taking place inside, and also discovers some boxes hidden behind a false wall.

That night the police arrive, wreck the church using a bulldozer, and attack some of the residents.  Nada recovers one of the boxes from the rubble, and finds that it contains dark glasses that allow him to see alien invaders who are living in disguise among the humans.  He can also see alien propaganda intended as mind control.  The invaders soon discover that Nada can see them, and take steps to eliminate him, so Nada gets hold of some guns, and starts blasting the aliens.

Nada kidnaps Holly Thompson (Meg Foster) a TV producer at Channel 54, and forces her to drive him to safety.  Nada is hiding at her place, when Holly propels him through a window, and he is forced to flee.  He eventually gets hold of another pair of the special sunglasses, and after an epic battle with Armitage, manages to convince him that the alien threat is real.  Making contact with an underground resistance group, the pair eventually mount an assault on the Channel 54 studios which is broadcasting signals used for mind control.

Ex-wrestler Roddy Piper doesn't have Kurt Russell's talent as an actor, but he brings to Nada some of the same brooding persona that Russell brought to Snake Pliskin and R.J. MacReady.  Piper excels in the action scenes, and seems very comfortable blowing away aliens with a shotgun.  Keith David, who worked with Carpenter in The Thing, is another physically imposing actor.  The fight between Nada and Frank while overlong, is one of the high points in the film.  The pair manage to escape capture, and get a lucky break, gaining entrance to the television station.  Upon discovery, there is wild chase and cartoonish gunfire in the corridors, leading to a battle on the roof of the building.

With aliens engaged in a secret takeover of the earth, They Live harkens back to classic flying saucer science fiction of the 1950's.  The story isn't sophisticated or developed to great detail, but is still pretty engaging, with a few twists and some decent action scenes.  Roddy Piper makes a lively if unpolished action hero, and Carpenter ends his tale on a climactic note.  Final rating: 3.5 stars.",1330128000,,3226,5.2578125

969266,4,6305077754,"They Live was a smart, cult film from the late 80s.  The protagonist is a honest itinerant worker who stumbles upon a cabal of resistance fighters who provide him with special sunglasses which allow him to see that some humans are really hideous aliens.  The aliens are in conspiracy to plunder the planet and promote crass materialism.  The basic plot device of the sunglasses derives from Dean Koontz's 1985 book Twilight Eyes, wherein a boy is born with the power to see that some humans are really goblins who are plotting something.  The aliens of They Live may represent the Illuminati, or some other group, but the film is probably just a satire of 80s materialism and globalization.  All in all, the movie has a smart social message and is relatively entertaining for a low budget film with unkown actors, but at least one star has to be subtracted for its obvious derivative character and for a protracted, pointless fight scene in the middle.

One other movie also borrows the plot of Twilight Eyes, I think from the early 90s, starring Matthew Mcononhay.  Come to think of it, Twilight Eyes may also have an allegorical significance, if the goblins derive from George MacDonald's Princess and the Goblin, wherein a boy fights against goblins who are ""plotting something"", where the goblins have unmistakable symbolic value!  These same goblins later take up as bankers in the Harry Potter series. (vindictive, hate poetry, want our sun women; maybe they're not as smart as I thought)",1317081600,4,1494,4.900793650793651

This film came years before the Matrix films were even a thought. The acting is superior and no one could portray the lead character better than Roddy Piper. The alien conspiracy is actually believable when one takes a non-veiled look at human society and what we think is a relatively free nation. I admit that previous statement is up for debate...especially today. What makes the film great is the dialog between all of the central characters. Also, the fight scene between Roddy Piper and Keith David. The basic premise of the story is that we ,as humanity, are not free like we think we are. Mass media, advertising, and money and it's accompanying conveniences are what secretly enslave us all. We are willingly consuming mindlessly in a pastel prison of profit.

969291,4,6305077754,"After successfully haunting audiences with stone-cold boogeymen and sub-zero aliens, director John Carpenter decided to take a new direction with 1988's ""They Live."" Inspired (or perhaps disgusted) by the failing economy and growing commercialism of the times, Carpenter used greed and control as the antagonist in the film, creating an all-new and all-too-real villain. Sure, there's also an alien sub-plot at hand, but what sets ""They Live"" apart is its unique blend of cynicism and dark comedy which has ensured the film's status as a quotable cult-classic that is surprisingly just as relevant today as it was some twenty odd years ago when Carpenter first put pen to paper.

Pro-wrestler Roddy Piper stars as Nada, a peaceful (and surprisingly well-kept) drifter (read: hobo) who stumbles into Los Angeles in search of his piece of the American Dream. He gets more than he bargained for when he stumbles upon a pair of sunglasses that reveal the world for what it is. It turns out aliens are using subliminal messages to manipulate and control the masses. Like many conspiracy theorists, Nada struggles with credibility, eventually converting a co-worker (Keith David) and a beautiful but feisty woman (Meg Foster) to his cause.

Surprisingly, Piper certainly has the charisma to tackle the film, more-so than the average wrestler turned actor, as a matter of fact. In fact, even though somebody like Kurt Russell could just as easily stepped into the role and made it work, Piper turns out to be an excellent and engaging action hero who keeps things fun and light, but never loses human touch. You'll root for him and his one-liners as well as chuckle and cheer when he engages in a lengthy back-alley brawl with his co-star (one for the books and certainly worth checking out the film just to see). It's a shame his career went south in the following decade to make room for the likes of Hulk Hogan (?!) and The Rock (ugh).

As for Carpenter, he delivers in classic form. Despite the cynicism at hand, he keeps the film fun and fast-paced. Like his best films, it swells to its conclusion, creating a rollercoaster ride effect that few directors can pull off as well. Sure, there are flaws in the film if you look close enough (the narrative takes a backseat to over-the-top action bits and humorous chunks of dialog) but while it entertains it also makes you think a little, which is the genius of Carpenter. In the end, ""They Live"" is worth re-living again and again and you don't need special glasses to see that little nugget of truth.",1306454400,4,2547,4.850574712643678

There are literally thousands of websites today that believe this very idea of humans being infiltrated by an alien race to become subsurvient is actually occuring right now. As shocking as this sounds there might quite possibly be some truth to it. Just check out David Ickes website. Funny alot of people Ive forced to watch this film didn't like it,more like didn't get it. But then again its nearly impossible to try and have a realistic conversation about whats really going on in this country and the world with said friends. I think as fun as this classic is it actually wanted its audience to think just a little while being entertained and thats what turned most people off. This movie for me is right up there with The Thing,District 9,Alien,Matrix and all the other top Sci-Fi flicks of all time. Come to think of it its probably a bad idea even writing this review,""Ive got one that can see!""J.K.!.....Maybe",1303948800,4,1075,4.575129533678757

The author probably find out about it and decided to write a screenplay to portrait and maybe make sense of what he discover.  And from the way the movie portrait that they do not know how long the Aliens been around, I can tell that the author does not know as much as I do about these secret societies.

It is a very good depiction of secret societies.  All you have to do is replace ""Aliens"" with ""Secret Societies"" & the ""Sunglass"" that allow the wearer to see the Aliens with a ""Secret Message Translator"" that allow you to understand these Secret Societies and you are pretty close to it.

When I saw this movie over 20 years ago, I sense some truth to it but was not able to grasp the whole truth.  After 20 years I was able to put it on the review mentioned above.

If you watch this movie and like it, then I would recommend you read my review mentioned above to further stimulate your mind from the stimulation you already got in this movie.

This movie is one of those movie you would want to keep in your movie collections.

Update 4/16/2013

I finally got the Blu-ray Version of ""They Live"" from Amazon on Feb. 12, 2013.  I tried to get it a few years back but the Blu-ray version was out of production and the only one available was costing $50-$60.  I wanted it as a collection because of the story and what it represents, but the movie itself was not really extra-ordinary.

The quality of the pictures is excellent.  But that is to be expected from a release this later version where they have perfected the Hi-Definition transfer of film.  If you get earlier version of Blu-ray of any movie, sometime it is not all it crack up to be because they were still new in adapting and perfecting the Blu-ray technology.

After watching the movie, I notice that this is not the director cut version.  And that the ""They Live"" movie that I saw originally on television must have been a director cut version.  An example is that on the scene where all the humans who had the gadgets to see the aliens assemble at a meeting and they were raided by the police, this Blu-ray version only has the aliens having prune faces.  But in the director cuts, the aliens had prune faces but some also look like monster with tentacles sticking out of their heads like Medusa.

And this movie looks so much like what I review on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Secret-Messages-Concealment-Codes-and-Other-Types-of-Ingenious-Communication/dp/0756762812/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Secret Messages: Concealment, Codes, and Other Types of Ingenious Communication</a>.  The following are some example in this movie of the uncanny similarity:

1) the aliens are said to be extra-terrestrial businessman just exploiting earth.  Where as in real life, the secret society also consider themselves to be businessman.
2) In the liquor store where Nada (Roddy Piper) put on the sunglasses and see these aliens, the aliens said ""we have one that can see"".  But in real life, when I notice the secret coded language of the secret society, they say ""He understands"", not knowing that I understand the general ideas & concept and not the nitty gritty. As my brain is too busy thinking of what kind of plausible deniability tactics to deal with these people who practice plausible deniability, with this gibberish they call a language/code, according to Newton's 3rd Law. And the last thing on your mind is communication when you see a rattlesnake.
3) In the bank when Roddy Piper were shooting and killing these aliens, an alien in the bank can just disappear, which we later find out by using his special watch.  But in real life, these secret society members can just disappear and blend into society by using the coded word, not in the coded meaning, but in regular language whether it is English, French, Spanish, Chinese, etc.
4) When Roddy Piper discovers the existence of these aliens, he was so disgusted with them that he kills a whole bunch of these aliens.  And in real life, when I discover the existence of this secret society, I was so disgusted with them, from the troubles, attitudes, lies, slanders & problems I experienced from these trouble makers since elementary school, that I write the review of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Secret-Messages-Concealment-Codes-and-Other-Types-of-Ingenious-Communication/dp/0756762812/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Secret Messages: Concealment, Codes, and Other Types of Ingenious Communication</a>&nbsp;to expose this secret society.

However the writer of this movie portraits that they don't know how long the aliens have been around, demonstrating that the writer just learned about the secret society recently or not long enough to know more details about them when writing the movie script for ""They Live"".  Where as in real life, the secret society claims to have been around during Jesus Christ existence and had fellowship with Jesus Christ. Due to similarity item #3 above, attempts to eradicate this secret society/underground society for over 2000 years have all been in vain.  Like a hydra, once you cut off one head, two more will grow in it's place.  To the present time where they are all over the world in almost every continent on Earth.

One might think that this is just a coincident that the existence of the secret society and this movie is similar.  But I am sure that the author of this movie writes this movie script as a way to express his discovery of secret society.

This is a movie that everyone must see at least once, if not to keep as a collection, whether they believe this is a cult classic or not.",1301702400,,6173,5.337461300309598

Going where even the biggest Hollywood directors feared to tread, John Carpenter delivers a thoroughly enjoyable popcorn movie that's more subversive & scathing than a dozen big-budget Serious Films. His relentless vision of America as consumerist Yuppie hell, run by & for the bottomless gullets of the rich & powerful, remains as relevant today as the day it was released.

When Rowdy Roddy Piper puts on that mysterious pair of sunglasses, amusingly reminiscent of those X-ray specs in the old comic book ads, he sees the contemporary world for what it is: a resource & playground for greedy, soulless ghouls in Armani suits, the evolutionary apex of the vulgar, the self-centered, the one-dimensional man (and woman). In that regard, nothing's changed since the 1980s; if anything, it's only gotten worse. God knows what those sunglasses would reveal today!

True, it's made on a low budget, and it's often quite rough around the edges -- but you don't want anything too smooth & polished, especially if it means watering down the message. It's one that needs to be shouted from the rooftops. Those greedy, soulless ghouls are still here -- and they don't come from some alien world, either! Although the worldview that drives them is certainly alien to anything truly human & humane.

969393,5,6305077754,"In my opinion , film director John Carpenter may perhaps be the most beautiful soul to emerge on the scene in the latter part of 20th century film production who has been born in the United States that I am aware of , of the many beautiful and not so beautiful souls that enjoyed the period of that recently emerged chapter in the history of lost civilizations.
Now that New America is approaxing , with the old New World Order dying , and the European Union collapsed , it is understandeable that the powers behind consumerism and mass production and capitalist greed , will find it rather difficult to accept the challengers that are coming now who will return numinously to the country , and create a more productive and creative period that will have more to give for people than the things that they have as of present lost. As a viewer of John Carpenter's films , I must say that he is a giver. While George W. Bush may be a decider , and myself a provider , he strikes me particularly as being a giver. It took the entire human race over 2000 years to produce the brilliant mind of creative genius John Carpenter. But it took only a few centuries to create Socrates. While we may have some doupts as to whether or not Socrates existed (he most probably did) , we are 100% certain that John Carpenter does. When I saw They Live for the first time , I loved it. I didn't have to talk much about it because I knew it was going to be talked about anyways and because I had recently as of them decided to construct a philosophy of not talking much with uninterested people about the films I had been watching. Now I can share my enthusiasm for this movie with others and especially those who have come to be known as the reptilian resistance.
The aliens of They Live strike me particularly as being some kind of parasite - carrying bipeds who have been infected by collectivism. It is possible that they could have been infected with something like toxoplasma gondii , explaining their behavior or that they could have been breeded to carry certain genetic memories of aggression , much like as of today's foxes. If you can tell a fox to be aggressive genetically , imagine if you stumbled across a being like this , and you knew they are aggressive , and you could exploit it. That you could turn their civilization it's head on and create two diverse populations - one aggressive , the other one being not so. As John Carpenter puts it; to end capitalism , you have to simply reverse it's unseen commands , and to end capitalist consumerism , you simply have to do the same. Once you know what those commands are , after you have introduced yourself to logic and the study of common sense realism and so on , you can simply reverse them and try to live your life that way - for example by staying awake. I did not violate John Carpenter's right as the author of this production since I decided to use original sentences for my mag which will be used to enhance peoples'senses (much like this film does. Likewise , it took 2000 years to produce Christianity , but one interview with Ernst Zundell for the whole world to hear him say that Jesus didn't have a degree in Christianity. I'd dare say that rather than attempting to remake this film , Hollywood should let John Carpenter produce a sequel - if he becomes interested in producing one. It could be one where one faction of the aliens decides to rebel and aid humanity in fighting back against the other aliens now that everybody is seeing what only a few people could see once........I have felt for some time now that a sequel for They Live is definately a possibility if John Carpenter would be interested in considering it.
For those who oppose the removal of glasses in the remake , I'd like to inform them that in the short story upon which this film is based , Eight O'Clock in the Morning , the aliens are called Fascinators , and are not seen by glasses , but rather detection comes as a result of one person waking up who manages to wake up another one........",1294185600,4,4029,4.416666666666667

They Live in my opinion should be preserved in the National Film Archive at the library of congress as being culturally significant. Even if you are not 1. A deep thinker 2. A person who believes in conspiracy theories 3. Anti-government (1 applies to me), I have a feeling you will enjoy the film. There is plenty of action in this movie and the concept is really cool. Aliens are controlling our minds through subliminal messages making us sheeple so they can take over our planet. Although they look human, a drifter discovers a pair of spectacular shades that allows him to see the appalling truth. It May seem like an out there movie but do yourself a favor and watch it! As for the DVD no extras on it (kind of a disappointment since it would be cool to have some behind the scenes stuff or interviews.) I have heard rumors that John Carpenter is doing a Remake of They Live, which if he keeps to the same concept and it is his baby he is tending I would gladly pay to see it. I just hope that nobody else in Hollywood does it just to milk off of a great movie and produce something that is bubble-gum (To all reading this know about movies that should never have been remade or were remade and turned out horrible.)

As a kid, I might not have picked up on everything John Carpenter was trying to say, but as the years have passed, I have even more appreciation for this film. Yes, on the surface, it seem just another sci-fi action film, but its a lot more than that. The subjects of social decline, over-commercialization, politics, etc. are the underlying themes that make the film that what it is. To me, this movie gets far less credit than it deserves, and it ranks up there with some of the best work Carpenter has ever done. Not only is the overall storyline really good, but Roddy Piper does an excellent job as the main protagonist, and looking back, its hard to imagine anyone else portraying that character so well. Another thing I enjoy is the ghoulish look of the aliens. True, maybe its not the most ""special"" of special effects, but that look has always seemed creepy to me, and I think the black and white aspect adds to that as well. The reveal when Nada (Piper's character) first puts on the glasses is my absolute favorite scene. I love seeing all the subliminal messages..""Sleep"", ""No Independent Thought"", and my personal favorite the money that says ""This is Your God"", which rings so true for so many people today. In fact, a lot of people today are doing exactly all those things...except ""Marry and Reproduce"", I think its more just ""Reproduce""! And speaking of which, I thought it seemed interesting that the aliens would say ""Marry and Reproduce"", and not just ""Reproduce"", maybe they don't believe in sex before marriage! Now I may get into some trouble when I mention this next thing, but you can't talk about this film without talking about the epic fight scene with Piper and Keith David. I've read how so many people love this scene, and yes, its a really good fight scene, but my problem is its a bit over the top for me. Maybe that was the point Carpenter was trying to make, but a 6 minute fight scene over putting on some glasses kinda seems a bit ridiculous. Again, the fight itself is great, its just the premise of the whole fight that gets me. Every time I watch that scene, I'm saying ""Would it be that hard for the guy to just put on the damn glasses?!"" But as far as that goes, that's the closest thing you'll get to hearing a complaint about this movie from me. I'm not saying its some amazing masterpiece, but like I said, its not just some average sci-fi movie to me. It has something to say, and says it well. And this is definite purchase for anyone, even if you just like the action aspect of it and you just wanna see some guy kill aliens, its still worth the buy.

969469,5,6305077754,"The setting in the movie They Live is rather simple. The world's economy is going downhill, middle class is nearly gone, and either you're doing very well or living a very hard life. This movie follows a single man in his quest for a job. I say ""man"" because in the movie, the ""man's"" name was never revealed. The actor is Roddy Piper, who is probably most famous for his role as a wrestler in the 80s and 90s.

The movie starts off with Piper's character coming into the city. Apparently he's married too because he has a ring on his wedding finger, but it was never revealed in the movie. Also, it appears he had some love interest in another character, but yet it was never really fully developed nor was a wife ever mentioned. Well anyway, Piper's character does find a job doing construction and living in a homeless camp.

While living at the camp one day, Piper discovers that a church is sending out broadcasts explaining that some alien race is taking over the planet and is the sole reason why the economy is going downhill and middle class going. Obviously, Piper didn't believe it until he put on some sunglasses that revealed that people who look normal are really hideous aliens in disguise. He also find that a lot of subliminal messages are placed around televisions, advertisements, and money. Knowing that the aliens are taking over, Piper's character suddenly goes insane in the membrane and begins shooting up the aliens. He walks into a bank saying the famous line of, ""I'm here to chew bubblegum and kick ---, and I'm all out of bubblegum.""

After the big shootout, Piper's character goes into hiding, and he has no friends other than one person he met during his job at the construction. Piper tried to explain to his friend that aliens are taking over and he has proof with a pair of sunglasses. His friend is not too impressed and isn't willing to put on the glasses and tells Piper to leave him alone. However, Piper isn't ready to leave until he proves to his friend that there are indeed aliens taking over and he's not an insane gunman. With this in mind, the next scene is probably one of the greatest fight sequences of all time. Piper starts landing blow after blow of intense, skull crushing blows to his friend in an attempt to force him to wear the sunglasses. His friend isn't willing to comply and returns some of the massive blows to Piper's face. After about five minutes of fighting, they're both exhausted, and Piper manages to force the sunglasses on his friend and then found out that indeed aliens taking over. Now Piper has a friend who believes him.

Afterward, Piper and his friend goes on a rampage. They find out that there is a single point of failure that would cripple the alien's silent takeover of earth. All they have to do is blow up one satellite dish, and the disguise that is making the aliens appear human will be gone; thus revealing their hideous form for all to see. You'd think that an advance race of aliens that are capable of intergalactic travel would think that having a single point of failure is a bad idea. Besides an obvious strike against them by someone finding the weak point, you'd think they'd take into account of the fact that an electrical storm, bug infestation, or something as simple as a power failure would cripple and jeopardize a critical element in their take over.  With that point aside, Piper and his friend goes on a rampage of shooting aliens with their sunglasses on. At the end, it is found that simply sticking up your middle finger at a helicopter tends to explode an entire satellite thus revealing the hideous alien race for all to see.

I personally loved the movie They Live. I suppose one can look at it sort of like a satire or some sort of social commentary. If I recall, at the time of the movie, the economy was taking a massive recession and a lot of people were becoming poor but at the same time, consumerism was in full swing for those who had money. As such, this movie sort of plays into that by saying that we're being taken over by an alien race because the poor just keeps getting poor and the rich keeps getting rich despite cut backs and other things. I suppose looking at the movie then, you can definitely say that this movie's core story can be applied to today's economy and world.

Besides the commentary of the movie, I felt that the movie is a real classic in terms of what the 80s and early 90s brought about in terms of movies. This movie had a lot of great one-liners and a cheesy plot. In today's movie, they try to make things more complex but at the same time the complexity is so ridiculous that it's not totally believable. In movies like ""They Live,"" I felt the story was more in line of simple to understand, but yet not so simple that it feels elementary and/or insulting. I think anyone would love this movie.

Most people are blind to what is going on in the world today, with new world order politics being snuck into daily living. Just like in the movie, but instead of having to use special glasses to view what is going on, you just need to go online! Especially prophetic is the invisible 'spy' plane type things that are floating around, monitoring people without their knowledge. The military are actually working on cyborg insects that are implanted with tiny cameras. Horray for nano technology! Thankfully there are many heroes out there like Roddy Piper in the movie that are helping to expose these evil bug eyed bilderberg NWO types to the world.

969538,4,6305077754,"The year was 1988. Reagan was still in office. Mass consumerism and greed were now the fashionable way of life for most Americans.  Was there a reason behind this?  What was making our country become a cesspool of apathetic, materialistic slobs?  If you have seen the sci-fi cult-classic They Live you may already have a theory.

John Carpenter, the writer/director of cult hits such as Halloween and Escape from New York decided to give us a possible answer with his visionary tale about a nameless nomadic construction worker, played by former wrestling star Roddy Piper, who stumbles upon a special pair of sunglasses which reveal high-society and dirty politicians as aliens who are controlling the human population through subliminal messages written on nearly every form of media.  For example, the sunglasses reveal money to actually say ""This is your god"", and a billboard advertisement telling people to ""get married and procreate"".

Now the film itself is quite hokey in a campy sort of way in terms.  The fight scenes are cheesy and drawn out far too long.  The script has some great one liners, for example the often imitated classic line ""I have come here to chew bubblegum and kick ass, and I'm all out of bubble gum.""  And the acting from Piper is downright laughable at times.  But these things don't take away from the satirical, yet eerie, conspiracy theory that Carpenter is nearly force-feeding down the viewers throat.

Thus, They Live has a great balance of social satire, chills, and comic relief to keep an audience tuned-in for it's brief 95 minute run.

There have also been rumors flying around about the possibility of a remake in the works under the umbrella of producers Marc Abraham and Eric Newman(2004's Dawn of the Dead, Slither)

Turns out it's a front for terrorists fighting alien creatures bent on our submission.  Somehow these aliens have created a ray or some treatment that makes us see them as human, and the subliminal messages are a riot.

Is that a Woman's Day magazine?  Not really.  Ads that subliminally say ""Obey"", ""Marry and Reproduce"" and ""Sleep"" are all good ones.

A parody of sorts of our consumer culture -- more fun than science fiction.  The gun battles are fair, but very one-sided.  What Roddy's character has to do to convince people to wear these special sunglasses is interesting as well.

Lots of plot holes dragged the movie for me.  I can buy humans cooperating in order to make money, but why so few really know and how widespread the alien influence is not made clear.  And their transport technology and other scientific marvels, why do they even need the Earth?

Anyway, too much thinking.  Enjoy this piece of shoot-em-up fluff!

969544,4,6305077754,"Here's a bare-bones DVD of a good Carpenter flick.  20+ years later, They Live actually looks better, perhaps more quaint, more retro than I would expect after all this time.

What is this movie?  Basically, it's Carpenter's 'ode' to Reaganism, which would make it very relevant today (I do expect a remake, over-budgeted and over-produced, but the themes beg for one).  In what is supposed to be the 'near future', times are tough, the economy is bad, the poor class is growing and society is becoming more polarized between the wealthy and everyone else...sort of like what's always happening in the USA.  A drifter shows up in town (looks like LA), and he finds some construction work.  Soon enough, he notices something strange going on at the local church, where some kind of underground movement operates.  Inside, he discovers special sunglasses that 'reveal' what is really going on: a race of ugly, skeletal-faced aliens is living among us, and all advertisements are really veiled commands to 'OBEY', 'CONSUME', 'BUY', and have 'NO THOUGHT'.  This matches the message in some pirate broadcasts where a man talks about the subservience of the masses, the permanent sleep-state that allows the owners to turn everyone into 'livestock'.

Carpenter's movies definitely changed when he lost cinematographer Dean Cundey, but this one still looks very much like an earlier Carpenter entry.  In a lead role one can easily see written for favorites Kurt Russell, or even Tom Atkins, Carpenter uses WWF icon 'Rowdy' Roddy Piper.  And you know what?  For the most part...it works.  (Today, they would use The Rock, er, Dwayne Johnson).  This is not an actor's role, and Piper's face is perfect for portraying the beaten down 'everyman' laborer.  In fact, he'd have been a good choice for The Running Man, which this story resembles in some ways (setting and theme).  And Keith David, who literally needs to be beaten into 'seeing' (oh, the metaphors), is reliable as always (and as tough as Piper).

The effects can be cheesy, yet there's something plainly effective in those black-and-white sunglass POV shots---dull matte paintings depicting the landscape (BUY, CONSUME, KEEP SLEEPING) that reminds one of a 60s painting.  There's a lot of action, too, as an enraged Piper looks to take revenge of the monolithic aliens by blasting them on his way to subverting their all-powerful signal that masks their 'ugliness'.  And the ending is pure, bittersweet Carpenter.

I think the movie holds up well and is relevant today, even if we've taken this for granted and have accepted the 'new cynicism' alluded to in the film (spoken by a politician-alien).  The themes would have gone over a youngster's head back in the day, yet the basic story was appealing.  Now one can appreciate Carpenter for being a quasi-Hawks-out-of-time figure in Hollywood.  Born too late, as he said.  The film is not overly preachy, and not overly talky, either.  There's a long fight scene between Piper and David where they really do look like they're beating the crap out of each other.  That metaphor, like the others, is not difficult to read.

The DVD?  The DVD is absolutely bare-bones.  Nice to have this movie in the format, but no doubt this needs a proper version, perhaps when they get around to asking Carpenter, who always does good commentaries on his films.  You can find this very cheap, and for Carpenter fans, a no-brainer.  Actually, for anyone who enjoys angry commentary on 80s Reaganism, highly recommended.  Am waiting for the super box set with Blu Ray, DVD, VHS, video disc, and a pair of those sunglasses.  And maybe an 'OBEY' shirt.",1251417600,2,3634,4.9635761589403975

969604,4,6305077754,"John Carpenter wrote the screenplay and directed this 1988 Science Fiction/Horror film that is based on Ray Nelson's 1963 short story, Eight O'Clock in the Morning.

With elements of the common hero versus a corrupt society - with ample amounts of wit tossed into the mix - it packs a punch from that time period - the ""me"" generation and the ""greed is good"" of the 1980s - but with a twist;  the elite are aliens who are managing human society through the use of subliminal media advertising and the manipulation of economic opportunity.

Roddy ""Hot Rod"" Piper is the hero - Nada - who finds the truth while in Los Angeles by viewing things through a pair of sunglasses. His quest then begins in earnest to convince others of what really propels life.

There is a timeless message in Carpenter's work and Piper turns in a strong performance. ""They"" may be around in different disguises, but Carpenter shows how the puppeteers can make many shake their hips to the greed twist.",1224201600,,977,4.662790697674419

This is one of those eighties movies that borderlines on silly and cheesy at times but overall there is so much to enjoy that in this case it barely stands in the way. Basically this is a story of an accidental discovery by a construction worker down on his luck. Trying to find some work, Nada arrives in LA and quickly makes some ""friends"" and gets in trouble on his first day of work. Eventually he tries to settle in but things seem strange, how strange he has no idea until one day he stumbles on a whole box of black plastic sunglasses. He soon finds out that they are made by a resistance group that send out announcements on TV channels about aliens and warns people that things aren't as they seem. Deem lunatics, they hide and act in secret, but when Nada puts those glasses on he discovers just how much what he believed in is true.

Driven by money and power, people will do anything to have more, even sell out their own species to aliens who are willing to exploit and use them. Those special glasses let Nada see the real aliens, disguised as human to unprotected eye and upon looking at TV shows, magazines and billboards he sees the true message that is meant for the average human; to buy and to obey. One has to see this movie to get the full gist of the idea, but it's something that I have actually felt about today's world for a while. Everything revolves around money, ways of making it, using people for it and luring others to spend their. This movie does a fantastic job of shedding some light on real life and mixes in some ultra terrestrials with incredible twists.

Nada is soon discovered by those who pretend to be human and chased through some really fantastic adventures. There are a few more secrets that make this movie so fun but spoiling them would be a shame, it's best to watch it without knowing too much. I highly recommend for a few hours of shameless fun and the ending is super, very well driven to the point.

With this in mind, your suspension of disbelief will be pushed to its limits. But if you hang on loing enough, it just might change the way you view the world.

Orwellian in theme, the film utilizes repetitive and primitive symbols, words and simplistic character sketches to portray a world in the throes of succumbing to brainwave manipulation [think subliminal advertising, which works, by the way], set up by extraterrestrials as a humane way of getting what they want from earth without actually killing anyone.

Everything - except for the aforementioned jeans worn by Nada - remains relevant today. Commercials that attempt to manipulate perception of reality. An overwhelming and omnipresent federal government. Capitalism gone arwry. Selling out everyone for personal gain. The list goes on.

969725,4,6305077754,"They Live was the last movie of the 80s made by John Carpenter; in many ways this was the end of an era. From 1976-1988 Carpenter had quite an impressive run of what are seen now as classics. The 76-88 era is very much Carpenter's golden era and he actually wrote or co-wrote most of these movies, which makes it even more impressive.

What I love about They Live is the movie is mindless entertainment that isn't so mindless at all. There is a heavy does of social commentary and it's not subtle at all. John Carpenter doesn't hide his feelings at all. He had something he wanted to say and he doesn't hold back. Every movie becomes dated, but some hold up well. They Live is probably one of those movies that will almost always remain current. Even to this day the message delivered in They Live holds up to what's going on in the world.

The screenplay was written by John Carpenter under the name Frank Armitage and overall the script was quite well done. What I love about Carpenter as a writer is his scripts have a simple idea and they work so well. Also I really love the characters in Carpenter's movies regardless if he wrote the script or not he really knows how to bring characters to life. They Live has a good script, though maybe weaker than some of his past ones, but overall it's quite well done. About the only real complaint I have is the first 30-minutes almost seem like fillers.

While there is character development you can actually lose the first 30-minutes and not lose any of the plot or any of the character development and the movie would still work and not feel like anything is missing. That's not to say the first 30-minutes were bad or boring. They do work, but I just feel like some of the scenes were sort of filler scenes.

As director John Carpenter creates a really fun movie. His scenes are well paced and like I said before he really knows how to bring characters to life. The action scenes are great and highly entertaining and the comedy in the movie also works quite well. When it comes to Carpenter's career he's always talked about how much he did for horror, which he did. But sometimes I feel people forget what a great action director he is.

As a kid I was a big wrestling fan and Roddy Piper was one of my very favorites. With really only a couple of exceptions most wrestlers that went into acting really didn't fair well. While some may have had a hit or two they weren't very good actors, while Piper may not be an Oscar worthy actor he does deliver a great performance here. He really knows how to entertain and the much underrated Keith David is great here as well. These two guys really work great together and help elevate this movie.

As I stated the first 30-minutes or so can be a little slow and you sort of get to that point and wonder ok where is this movie going? Once Piper puts on the sunglasses its non-stop excitement until the end of the movie; the biggest highlight of the movie is probably the fight scene between Roddy Piper's character and Keith David's character. The scene runs at about 5-minutes and some people complain it was too long. Ok, yeah I suppose it was on the long side, but I don't think I have ever been more entertained by a fight scene like I was in They Live.

They Live also features some of the best one liners; they are the type you can keep quoting over and over again. This really was an excellent movie, while again the first 30-minutes do sort of feel like filler scenes at times it's never boring and once it gets going the movie is just non-stop fun. I suppose this could sort of be seen as the last great Carpenter movie, but I do enjoy his 90s work; they may not be as solid as his 70s/80s work, but not as bad some people make it out to be, but They Live was probably his last great movie.

They Live is mindless entertainment that isn't so mindless; despite the heavy dose of social commentary They Live is a blast!",1202342400,59,3919,4.344262295081967

We have to give it to Piper on this one, he totally fufilled all expectations. His acting was so pitiful, spouting tough quotes like, ""I came here to chew bubble gum and kick [butt]."" He went on and on with these gems for the first half of this one. He found his magical ray-bans and went to work taking out every alien in sight. Just like in his old ring days, he was an absolute one man wrecking crew. Only instead of being in the Scottish kilt wearing form we were used to, he portrays a flannel wearing, mullet sporting drifter. Which actually fit him quite nicely.

So, the basic plot was that Piper stumbled upon these shades. And when he put them on, he could tell who were normal people, and who were the brainwashing aliens. Piper and George 'Buck' Flower, a charter member of the all-time ""That Guy"" team, let the real people live and figure four leg locked the aliens into submission. The goofy factor jumped at least 5 spots because the loser who wrote it was trying to get across his tortured view of our twisted society. And if you're trying to do that, who's your vehicle baby?....You got it, ""Rowdy"" Roddy Piper. I think he even had a Piper's Pit about the very same topic once. Anyway, one hillarious thing about this one was Piper getting smashed over the head with a beer bottle, getting pushed out a window, rolling down a hill, then getting up like he tripped over an untied shoelace. And another was a totally unnecessary 20 minute awful fight scene in the middle. Both were prime examples of the B powerhouse that this film was.

Piper plays an unemployed drifter, who is looking for work. Unfortunatley there aren't many good paying jobs available, because of corporate outsourcing (a problem which is killing the middle class and increasing poverty). However, nobody seems to notice or care that their fellow Americans are suffering, because they are caught up in materialism.

Piper discovers a pair of glasses that expose the truth. With the help of a few greedy individualistic elites, an evil race of aliens are slowly enslaving the human race.

Pipers acting is great, and there are plenty of memorable one liners.",1177200000,,709,5.2105263157894735
969879,2,6305077754,"I'm a HUGE fan of Carpenter's early work, everything from ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13, CHRISTINE, THE FOG, and his magnum opus, HALLOWEEN. So when I picked up THEY LIVE and saw that Rowdy Roddy Piper starred, I knew I couldn't call myself a Carpenter fan without popping this in for a viewing. I sat back and looked forward to taking in more Carpenter goodness.

The result? A movie that takes a long time to get going, has only one standout acting performance, and displays some really lame effects.

We watch Piper's character drift into town and apply for work, shelter up in a homeless community, chance upon a construction job, chat with the homeless residents, go back to the job, etc. Some 30-40 minutes later the movie finally kicks into gear. It was hard for me to stay interested for this long without anything really happening, but the promise of aliens and action compelled me to persevere. The highpoint in all of this was Keith David, who plays Piper's fellow homeless/construction worker friend. The man acted circles around everyone else in this movie. The other actors, however, come off as wooden, more like actors TRYING to act. Because they couldn't imbue their characters with much of any real emotion, I didn't sympathize with them nor really care what happened to them. And the effects are pretty low-grade, more of the B-movie variety. There's not a whole lot of difference between the effects in ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13 (1976) and THEY LIVE (1988). As you could guess, the lack of more sophisticated effects sets this movie back to, well about 1976.

I must say that I loved the ending (which I won't give away), but my investment in the finale was lessened by the slow beginning and poor quality of the movie's middle. If you like cheesy B-movie fun, then rent THEY LIVE. If you want serious action and fear, rent something from the beginning of Carpenter's career, like HALLOWEEN or CHRISTINE.",1174953600,,1914,4.77643504531722

It's obviously not a high-budget sci-fi movie, but it's not Mystery Science Theater trash either.  It just works.  You've got an anti-hero sort of main character, some good supporting characters that reappear throughout the film and provide continuity, and a soundtrack that sets a mood and holds it all together.

What if someone told you that you could look through a pair of glasses and see everyone who is pretending to be someone that they're not, or everyone who has a hidden agenda?

And I'm not giving this a one star rating, it deserves a full five stars! This is the kind of film you'd wish was on Mystery Science Theater 3000 (I only wished MST3K had rights to even more films, or wasn't cancelled when it did).

The film was obviously a satire on the yuppie movement of Reagan-era America, this movie having been released in 1988, just as the Reagan-era was coming to an end. Of course, what makes a cheesy movie is to have a WWF wrestler as your main actor. In this case, ""Rowdy"" Roddy Piper, who, in the previous year was also in another really hilariously bad film called Hell Comes to Frogtown. Are you disturbed by the widening gap between the rich and the poor? Do you think the yuppies are self-centered, materialistic and status-obsessed? Do you think there's little future for the poor and working class? Wonder why there's so little regard for the environment, or why there seems to be a mass of mindless consumers? Well, in this film, you find out, just by wearing a pair of special sunglasses, which reveals them to be alien zombie yuppies! (I could only imagine if this film was done a decade later, and one puts on those sunglasses while at a Wal-Mart). And when you wear these glasses, you get to see the true meanings behind those billboard signs and advertising (""Obey"", ""Consume"", ""No independant thought"", etc.). The violence in this movie is the most unbelievable I ever seen in my life, including an extended fistfight (many of them including professional wrestling moves like bodyslams, which is no surprise, given Piper's background in the WWF), and tons of machine guns. You know life couldn't be as easy as this film in knowing who your enemies are. Carpenter wanted a scene where Ronald Reagan was one of them, but he backed on that idea, knowing that would be too controversial. But there was a scene in the health food store where Nada (Piper) was watching the television and there was a politician (that was an alien), who way saying, ""It's a New Morning in America"" that had Reagan's hairdo, said the same kind of things Reagan would say, but sounded absolutely nothing like him.

Unfortunately the DVD really don't feature anything new if you already own the VHS. There's no outtakes features, no interview with John Carpenter in regards to the film. The only reason you might need this DVD is the convenience of DVD (no having to wait an endless period of time to get it rewound, none of that wear and tear that VHS would have through the years of play, and the scene selection feature making it easy to get to your favorite part).

This is a truly unbelievable film, it really deserves to be seen.",1165795200,3,2820,4.647294589178356
969943,4,6305077754,"I say this because this film is not about communism at all.  I'll bet you that Collatine probably thinks the same way about the Matrix.  If you are so paranoid as to think this movie is ""Pro-Communist Garbage"", then you probably also think that the movie The Thing (another great John Carpenter Film"" is nothing but Propaganda on the AIDS Virus and that those infected must be from another world and are not human.  That sounds ridiculous right?  Well so is Collatine's claim about the movie They Live.  They Live is a great Sci-Fi movie that targets paranoia similar to his.  I normally don't reply to comments made by other reviewers, but this statement of stupidity infuriates me.  Now I shall continue on with the review of They Live.

They Live is about a drifter who finds a pair of sunglasses that lets him see certain people as aliens and subliminal propaganda in magazines, newspapers, billboards and basically anyplace a human would read.  The drifter quickly finds a group of freedom fighters who plan to stop the aliens from furthering their control on the human race and the time to ""chew bubblegum and kick a**"" begins.

It's a very enjoyable and original film; I would imagine that the creators of movies like The Matrix got some of their ideas from here.  John Carpenter does a wonderful job as a director (again) and there are only a few flaws contained within the movie.  The first one that comes to mind is that the music is simple and very repetitive.  The second is that there is a fight scene that might annoy some people as it goes on for about 5 and a half minutes.  I personally loved it and found it to be hilarious, but not all people will.  It actually took three weeks to rehearse.  The third problem is that I was hoping for a little more action as I found the middle of the movie is a little boring.  The fourth is that the ending left a little more to be desired, but it was still a good ending.

As for the DVD, the extras are minimal.  They don't even list them on the back of the case, but I expected as much because it was being sold for $10.  This is the only version available and because it wasn't a big hit, I doubt a Collector's Edition will be released anytime soon.

If you like Science Fiction, Horror, B-Movies, John Carpenter or anything along those lines, then this movie is for you.  If you share a similar view such as Collatine, then move along, you have nothing to see here.  And for the people who are neither; watch it sometime, you'll enjoy it.

969944,5,6305077754,"Roddy Piper, a top pro wrestler, happens to star in a movie classic.  I'd place this movie on my all time list of the 100 greatest movies ever made.  And it's carried by Roddy Piper.  He's not just the star.  He's the movie.  He, and the director, and the writer, and the costume designer.  He carries every single scene on his shoulders.

It is a 1984 type story, about an evil repressive government that just needs to be overthrown.  Your good guys and bad guys are very easy to delineate, if you have the special sunglasses.  Put them on, and your bad guys look like who they really are - ugly space aliens.  I love it.

My very favorite scene is the closer, the one they shock you with just before blacking out and going to the credits.  A whore is in bed with one of the space aliens.  She sees him as human.  Then all of a sudden the matrix-like illusion is gone and she sees him as he really is - an ugly giant bug.  It's great.

I think it would be fun, if you were an ugly giant bug yourself, to take over a planet as they did.  However, the writing is definitely from the point of view of the Earth creatures that we have taken over, hahaha.

My favorite character in Men In Black is ""Egger"", the giant bug who is the villain and is pestered unmercifully by Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith.  When will we stop being so one-sided in these movies, these Earth-centered propaganda flicks, and let our hair down and have some fun taking over a planet for a change.  In a few hours I have to get up and start another work week.  Is that really a way of life worth preserving?  Earth be damned, let's root for the space bugs.

Obviously this movie is dark with criticism of the wealthy capitalists who rule our planet.  We learn, here, that they are really extra terrestrial space bugs.  Okay.  I think Bush is the Earthling who collaborates with them in this movie.  I see a resemblance.  They are both slick talkers with a southern twang, and I wouldn't buy a used car from either of them.  I would typecast George Bush in that role.  As for the Roddy Piper part, who would be better than the macho and colorful Ralph Nader, or Al Gore.

To briefly sum up the film, sinister aliens that appear human  have complete control of the world and all of its governments.  Money hungry humans working as minions have sold out the planet and their own species to these invaders.  A small militant resistance group knows what is happening and has developed optical lens that reveal the aliens and their propaganda messages that lay subliminal to the naked eye.  Roddy Piper's character is an unlikely hero who accidently stumbles into the war.

Wow, pretty deep stuff.  This has much in common with the ""V"" miniseries from the 80s.

You will want to show this to all of your close friends, but be warned the first half hour is a tad bit slow and the ending seems to arrive too quickly.  These factors slightly dampen a film that could have been perfect.

I would love to have had this film be another ten or fifteen minutes longer if it would have provided more action and suspense.

Even though this film was made in 1988, its themes of greed, deception and nepotism is more potent today living under the newest Bush's America where the middle class is gradually becoming extinct and the wealth gap between the rich and poor has never been so vast and troubling.

In the film, you see people using cardboard boxes as umbrellas and a community of people living in a dingy hamlet that resembles something you would expect to see in a third world nation, but not in America.  These people have been largely abandon by the powers that be to fend for themselves.  The whole thing eerily reminds the viewer of the Bush Administration's slow and pitiful response to the Hurricane Katrina disaster.

970031,4,6305077754,"The world in ""They Live"" is infiltrated at every level by hostile aliens, and it's not a future or parralell world, but our own.  When a homeless drifter - one of a forgotten legion of society's citizens who in this case moves around from town to town and city to city looking for temporary work wherever they'll hire someone who doesn't have the benefit of a fixed address - accidentally comes across a special pair of glasses that allows the wearer to see that which is disguised by a grand alien technology, the true state of the world and its rulership begins to be revealed, to the movie's characters and to the viewers.

Roddy Piper does a great job in the lead role, and the idea of making a couple of members of the neglected homeless the catalysts for uncovering this worldwide conspiracy and beginning a resistance is an inspired choice.  The scale of events going on unseen right in front of the world's eyes is enormous and might seem implausible if not for how masterfully the movie is done.  The scene in which Piper's character looks through a selection of newstand magazines with the aid of the glasses is extremely effective, and the secrets revealed when looking at another form of widely circulated paper material immediately thereafter is one of the most authentically chilling in science fiction history.  Some great, full-out action scenes too.  Definately recommended for all fans of ""The Arrival"", ""The X-Files"", ""Millennium"" and ""Body-Snatchers"".",1132099200,10,1471,4.911290322580645

Down and out, unemployed Nada(Roddy Piper) stumbles on to a plan of complete take over and domination of aliens from another planet posing as humans. Piper does an admirable job of playing the tough, working class hero. Keith David and Meg Ryan are also great in their respective supporting role.

While the movie drags along for the first half hour or so, the action picks up at a dramatic pace afterwards, including one of the greatest fight scenes in movie history between Piper and David.  Producer Shep Gordon, of Alive Enterprises, ensures the story has a concise dialogue and a straight forward story line of alien invasion of earth.

970115,4,6305077754,"An unassuming blue-collar construction worker comes into possession of a pair of sunglasses which reveal the truth behind society's mental manipulation strategies upon the common herd. Aliens with skull-faces appear through the frames, and covert messages on just about every commercial product become revealed, with statements such as ""Sleep"", ""Obey"" ""Do not question authority"", ""submit"", ""conform"", and ""No Imagination"" array everything from magazines to billboards, to televised programs - to propitiate a soma on the human populace.

Seems they are integrating into earth culture in order to provide a sort of vacation spot for themselves, end up buying out the whole media, and consider current society to be likened a third-world country.

""John Nada"" {stunt-wrestler Roddy Piper} seeks the alliance of a fellow proletarian ""Frank"" {Keith David}, and end up in a scuffle which includes a suplex and a back-breaker, patented show-wrestling moves, all because he just would not wear those glasses, but he finally does, and the veritable ""scales"" fall from his eyes as well. The fight lasts a bit too long, even thtough it is understandable considering the profession of the actor.

They join an underground rebel organization which is itself eventually destroyed by alien forces. With their newly-acquired contact lenses, Nada and Frank go about as a two-man rebel crew to blast every alien they perceive and eventually stumble upon their cloaking device - a ray broadcasting the holographic deception upon the world, thus revealing the scheme to humans. Earlier on, while escaping from his initial realization, Nada placed his confidence in a treacherous woman who at one point actually knocks him out of a two-story window, yet he persists placing his trust in her ingratitude, to tragic results in the conclusion of the film, taking the life of his best friend. Turns out she was on the aliens' side all along.

I thought it was interesting how the messages are in black & white, as in duality, and the aliens seem to represent thanatos with the skull-head death {totenkopf} connotation. This reminds Me of the ""invisible war"" Dr. LaVey discusses in The Devil's Notebook.

Overall, They Live is an Orwellian film displaying certain subtle truths present, even in the media today, the new god of the masses.",1121904000,2,2314,5.226415094339623

While watching CNBC I often think of this film.  Where do these philistines come from and how is it that we watch the decline of our country like some deer caught in the headlights of an oncoming car at night?  I am not suggesting that they are extraterrestrials but they sure as hell aren't patriots, I don't care how many American Flags they wear on their lapels.

970118,4,6305077754,"This is one odd movie Carpenter has given us here.  Ridiculously blunt social commentary piled on top of the most deliberately 'B' movie you're likely to have seen in a damn long time.  It's tough for me to say exactly how we're supposed to take this as some of the weirdness approaches parody.  I can't say for certain, but I'm presuming this is intentional, seeing as how I find it tough to imagine that the director of movies like 'The Thing' 'Halloween' and 'In the Mouth of Madness' could make a movie this silly on accident.  But, intentional or unintentional, this is a very amusing film.

Rowdy Roddy Piper plays the massive Nada, (oh you are a clever one John!) a drifter come to wherever this movie takes place (LA, maybe, I dunno) in search of work.  He ends up in Justiceville, a modern day Hooverville, and becomes acquainted with the equally massive Frank.  Times are hard all around, apparently, and it turns out that bad aliens and yuppies and conspiracies are the reason why,which eventually discover Frank and Nada and join the fight for good.
This movie is more about concepts and scenes then it is about plot, so there really isn't a whole helluva lot more to the plot then what I just said.  Thus, the film seems to have a sorta long build-up to a very trunucated climax.  But, the buildup it plenty fun.

Obviously, this is a highly political/social film, as it is highly critical of the upper classes and big business.  Frankly, these politicals aren't much in line with mine, but it's vague enough that you can take it however you want.  Maybe Carpenter is a commie, who wants to break down the capitalist system and have us live in a happy commune, or maybe he's just disgusted with the squanderous tendencies of much of the elite, and those who place value of money above people.  Take it either way you want.  I'll go with the latter.

Carpenter is mostly associated with horror films, but `They Live' doesn't fit into any single category that clearly.  Mostly it's a drama, though it's got a fair bit of action towards the end, a decent amount of humor, plenty of satire and a bit of mystery too.  Obviously, it's got aliens but I don't think the sci-fi tag really applies, as the sci-fi elements are just used for satirical purposes.  But, whatever, it's just definitely a pretty weird melange of styles.

This movie has got some cool ideas.  The black and white world of subliminal advertising that is revealed when Nada wears the sunglasses is really quite intriguing, and the basic premise of aliens invading via subterfuge and economic manipulation is fairly nice too, though it probably isn't all that original to this.  I've always enjoyed the whole paranoiac, everyone is in on it mode, and I think it works pretty well here, despite the strangeness and B-movie trappings.

Though many seem to like him, I think Piper is pretty terrible in the lead.  He's kinda awkward and goofy, with a rather silly voice.  Too bad Carpenter didn't have Kurt Russel be the lead again.  He'd a worked.  Keith David is better, and more likable as Frank.  Nobody else has all that big of a role, so they don't matter that much, other than Meg Foster as the potential love interest, who is most noteworthy for having scary, inhuman eyes.

Yeah, the aliens do look pretty silly, but I think they were meant to, and they're kinda cool and fun too.  The action scenes are generally pretty decent, with the exception of the big fist fight and wrestling showdown between Frank and Nada towards the middle of the film, which is flatly awesome.  It's about the most ridiculous thing ever, and just goes on and on and on, and doesn't have a damn thing to do with anything.  Very amusing.

Carpenter shot this in widescreen, as per usual, and he doesn't use it all that effectively, but it gives the whole film a nice, classy feel, contrasting with the weirdness of the whole project.  It's also got a bluesy, slow going score, which fits the general tone pretty well, I think.

Well, I don't think I've said much of consequence so far, so I'll just cut myself off.  It's certainly not Carpenter's best film, but it's definitely fun and watchable, and not without some interesting ideas.  Check it out.

970119,5,6305077754,"With inventive storytelling and style, John Carpenter's They Live addresses the issue of media manipulation and semiotic deception. In his film, Carpenter allegorically depicts the power elite as a hostile alien race quartered among us. To these invaders, Earth is analogous to a developing country, another third-world. Humans are cattle, capital goods of flesh and blood. Through the subliminal seduction of electronic media, these aliens control the herd. In fact, their mind control apparatus is so effective that it veils their true appearance. They look just like you and I.

Donning a special pair of sunglasses called the ""Hoffman Lens,"" the film's protagonist pierces the semiotic mirage and glimpses reality. Through the ""Hoffman Lens,"" our hero discerns the brutally honest world of connotative meaning. The super models on billboards, the cigarette ads in magazines, the politicians spewing rhetoric on TV... all are but indexical signs referencing the paradigms of the elite. For instance, the restaurant advertisements, replete with their images of families enjoying high-cholesterol food, reference a single mandate of the ruling class ethos: ""CONSUME."" Likewise, when observed through the Hoffman Lens, the Great Seal of the dollar bill is replaced by the statement: ""THIS IS YOUR GOD.""

What is most elucidating, however, is the appearance of the elite when viewed through the Hoffman Lens. They are walking cadavers, the proverbial ""whitewashed sepulchers"" mentioned by Jesus in the Gospels. Beneath the cosmetically altered exterior is death.

That the chief means of deception is technological in nature is intentional. The word ""technology"" is derived from the Greek word techne, which means ""craft."" Moreover, the term ""craft"" is also associated with witchcraft or Wicca. From the term Wicca, one derives the word wicker. Examining this word a little closer, researcher Michael Hoffman (author of Secret Societies and Psychological Warfare) explains: ""The word wicker has many denotations and connotations, one of which is `to bend,' as in the `bending' of reality."" This is especially interesting when considering the words of Mark Pesce, co-inventor of Virtual Reality Modeling Language. Pesce writes: ""The enduring archetype of techne within the pre-Modern era is magic, of an environment that conforms entirely to the will of being."" Through technology, the media creates an environment that conforms entirely to the will of its masters.

The Druid magicians of antiquity used to carry wands, which were made out of ""holly wood."" Sound familiar? The famous Hollywood sign is but an enormous semiotic marker for an industry that specializes in illusion. Through the alchemical sorcery of electronic media, individual consciousness is immersed within a psychocognitive hive.

They Live exemplifies the underlying theme of broadcast criticism. In one scene, the main character discovers some graffiti that reads: ""THEY LIVE, WE SLEEP."" Indeed, those who do not engage active critical analysis while viewing electronic media are asleep. Meanwhile, a parasitic elite lives.",1114473600,8,3094,5.588486140724947

Then after he goes through a series of strange events involving a fake church that is actually the headquarters for an underground group of people that pirate television signals and try to broadcast ""the truth"" to people, he stumbles upon a box of sun glasses inside the church.

He says things like ""Beat your feet"" when he wants this dude to run away.  And ""Get set to sweat"" when about to enter some action scene.  Ri-g_d-d_mn-diculous.  The dialogue is insane.

I guess the premise is pretty cool.  This drifter comes to a big city looking for work because there were no jobs in his home town. He ends up living in this shanty town where he discovers some magic glasses in a suspicious church which is really a cover for a group of people that are trying to debunk a conspiracy.  The conspiracy goes like this:  aliens have taken over the upper eschelons of business and politics in order to turn humans into greedy slaves that do anything to make money.  Apparently all the ills of society can be attributed to this scheme of theirs.  Global warming, the poverty rate going up and the middle class shrinking, air pollution, social complacence.

So the glasses allow our ""star"" to see things hidden from normal view.  Advertisments turn out to say stuff like ""Consume"" and ""Buy"" and ""Watch TV"" and ""Marry and Reproduce.""  The glasses also reveal who is alien and who is human.  Eventually he and a few others try to stop the aliens.  But the story takes some of the lamest turns ever produced for mass consumption.  The fact that a decent premise was wasted on giving Rowdy Roddy Piper a vehicle to display his ""acting"" talent is a pity.

All in all, its a really entertaining movie for the pure hilarity of how sincerely Rowdy and his co-stars take the performance.  I kinda hope that someday another director or producer decides to remake the original short story into a better movie.  The story really has potential.

Well, look no further than John Carpenter's cult classic They Live.  Wresting superstar Roddy Piper stars as Nada, a drifter that stumbles upon a pair of sunglasses that show him the truth about his society and the world he inhabits.  He discovers that humans are not the only beings to be living on the planet Earth.  Nada also knows what he must do to save the human race from complete invasion of these creatures.  Does he have enough time and manpower to stop these culprits of communication or will Nada only help them enslave the human race?  It will all teeter on the amount of ""bubblegum"" that he carries with him!

Visionary director John Carpenter creates this world that is not unlike today's society.  Glued to the television and void of independent thought, he shows us a human race that resembles cattle in the fields waiting for the farmer's next decision.  Created well before The Matrix, Carpenter uses aliens to demonstrate the power of the media and the superpowers behind the scenes.  In a world where we gather our truth from others and in the comfort of our own home, this film carries themes that are still relevant today.  Carpenter shows us that we can live in a world, even a city, and not realize what is happening around us.  How hidden are those subliminal messages in our culture?  He also prods at the notion that only the wealthy can create the supposed truth, and that eventually the lines between wealthy and homeless with be much defined.  There will be an elimination of the middle-class and humans would be at the bottom of the social order.

This was a beautiful film that carries with it a heavy burden of showing us the truth of our world.  While we may giggle and laugh at this ""created"" society, there are some truths to what Carpenter is showing.  He gives us warnings and answers if we choose to listen.  I was not expecting such a high caliber of emotion to go into a film like this, and was utterly surprised by the experience.  Perhaps it is the packaging, perhaps it is because our culture has not adapted well to the horror/sci-fi genre yet, but everyone should experience this film once.  I recommend it for anyone that enjoyed The Matrix and want to see more about the structure of our society.

Masquerading as a routine invasion story, it portrays a society whose members blindly accept all of the implicit materialist/capitalist messages thrown their way; the only resistance is offered by those who don't fit in that money-oriented mold - a blind preacher, the poor, some dissident intellectuals. Many religious and philosophical grids can be used to read this movie - Hinduism's doctrine of maya, Plato's cave, Gnosticism: an unlikely visionary (Piper) realizes that the 'real world' is in fact full of illusions; convincing others of his discovery proves to be difficult (witness the famously extended fight scene, at once hilarious and revealing), and a battle soon begins between two secret fraternities - one determined to maintain the illusions, the other eager to dispel them.

(Appropriate for 1988--after all, Quayle was vice president at the time.) Piper's efforts to alarm the general public and infiltrate this conspiracy make up most of the middle third of the film, and it ends, appropriately, with guns ablazing and things exploding.
Fortunately, this movie doesn't take itself too seriously, otherwise it might have been disastrous. (In mood and tone, THEY LIVE is first cousin to 1989's TREMORS.)

This movie is not so much about aliens who are hiding among us, but instead it taps into the deeply submerged suspicions of most of us that we are being manipulated and taken advantage of by the elite of American society, by our leaders, by the rich, etc. Also, we sometimes feel that we are manipulated and programmed (in a subtle way) to respect hierarchical authority ( e.g., the ""OBEY"" subliminal command from the movie).
Some leftist thinkers might say that human societies are in a way being parasitized by the elite of their societies, and that the elite operate as a parasitic sub-society, living off of the lower classes. America might be said to be operated more in such a fashion (i.e., parasitized by the elite) than are the countries of western Europe. Obvious examples of this parasitic behavior are the ""golden handshakes"" and backscratching exchanged between corporate CEO's and the Boards of Directors of their companies. But it is far more pervasive than just that.
_They_Live_ uses the invisible alien elite as a proxy for our suspicions about how we are all being exploited by the elite of our real-life society, and how these elite are subtly programming us to accept this exploitation.
So, the major theme of the movie is not, as another poster correctly pointed out, about being manipulated to be good little consumers in a crassly commercial world. No, it is far more profound than that. Instead, it is more about how the working class Americans in _They Live_ are being exploited by the elite upper crust, who, in the movie, happen to be aliens.  Also, this movie is not relevant ONLY to Reagan's time, or to Reaganomics, but it is more relavant today than it was when it was released.
Unfortunately, this movie only explores this exploitation theme in a somewhat superficial way, and the movie itself has an unintentionally comic air to it sometimes. Still, the exploration of that theme is so rare in pop culture, and that theme is so profound, and reaches so far into what American society is, was, and is becoming, that this movie is a Must-See for anyone with an interest in politics and sociology.",1088208000,8,2221,4.891246684350133

All the aliens are disguised and look like real people but he can only see them with the sunglasses on. He can also read secret messages on every sign and on every cover of the magazines when he has the glasses on. The messages are a little weird though, kind of freaky.
Whats funny about it is that he just walks into a store or any other place and starts shooting whoever is an alien but the regular humans don't know whats going on. What else is wierd is that all the aliens start coming toward him and get closer and closer and speak into a little walkie talkie thing when he shoots an alien because then they know that he can see them.

In many ways, he's very similar to Quentin Tarantino, who basically does the same thing.  I think They Live is the most B movie-esque Carpenter ever got, and that's not a bad thing!  Sure, there are people out there who hate it, but I suppose they were expecting another Starman or something.  I must say that Roddy Piper did quite well in his acting debut.  No, he's no Lawrence Olivier, he's basically playing a tough guy hero, but I think he does a really good job.  He's able to carry the whole film.  Maybe Hulk Hogan should watch and learn a few things.  His ""Put on the glasses"" fight with Keith David(a great actor who'll probably never get his due) is classic.  Carpenter was also trying to pound home a message in this film, moreso than any of his others.  His little response to the ""me"" decade.  Personally, I love it.  You can pretty much take from this one whatever you want coz it does work on a couple of levels.  If you want to chuckle at an amusing  satire of the Reagan era, you can't go wrong.

970260,5,6305077754,"After spending the last few months expanding my collection of John Carpenter DVDs to the best of my ability without plunging into bankruptcy, I've come to the inevitable conclusion that, despite his inactivity and supposed ""downfall"" over the last ten years, he is still one of our best (and unfortunately most underrated) directors. With a classic film like ""Halloween"" on his resume, it's easy to overlook the rest of his films like they could never possibly measure up. Truth be told, what could? ""Halloween"" was, is, and will forever be the alpha and omega of slasher film horror. That being said, ""They Live"" is probably one of the best corporate satires of the past twenty years. Made in the latter years of Reagan's eighties, John Carpenter's film, based off the short story titled ""Eight in the Morning,"" is a fun action ride that moonlights as a biting satire of the stranglehold of greed in America.
Roddy Piper (how perfect is that?) stars as the man with no name (credited as ""Nada"" at the end), a drifter who finds work and friendship among a small habitat of homeless dwellers. He's also the man who eventually begins a quest for the truth behind a pair of special sunglasses that reveal the existence of alien lifeforms. Keith David plays the construction worker with a heart of gold who befriends Piper and they have some very interesting conversations.
""It's all a big game. The name of it is 'Getting Through Life.' Everybody's trying to finish first and do you in at the same time. They put you at the starting line and now, here we are: You do what you can, but remember, I wanna do my best, too... blow your a$$ away...""
Piper's laugh in response to David's diatribe about life in economic America might be simple in its form, but shattering in its true meaning. People do try and laugh it off when someone says something they may or may not agree with. Or suppose we just have a different point of view, we would rather laugh and pass it off as understanding than comment with our own opinion; just let the conversation end. Such is the attitude of people at the time. Heck, it still might be.
Half the power of ""They Live"" lies in its complete, focused attention on inattention. Or our inability to accept reasons for our plight that go outside our views. The fistfight between Piper and David around the one-hour mark in the film is one of the best in cinema (and it's real, I might add, minus the blows to the head). And while it is silly and over the top, there's an honest message in there about how we will fight to be blind to a painful truth. If ignorance is bliss, I will fight Roddy Piper to remain that way.
The aliens in ""They Live"" serve as a device for the satirical undertones to function. They are also responsible for triggering sequences of shocking intensity, such as when an entire Hooverville of peaceful people is bulldozed to the ground, its inhabitants beaten senseless. Nonetheless, they are the corporate leaders that we all feel like are aliens, peering out at us with their skeletal faces safely behind their podiums. Carpenter sees them as they are meant to be seen, and with some truly awesome matte-designs accompanied with black and white photography, shows us the true messages behind the endless bombardment of advertising we are subjected to each day.
Stay asleep, no independent thought, marry, reproduce, consume, and don't question authority. To quote another Carpenter film, ""Welcome to the human race.""",1074124800,71,3464,4.7272727272727275

In particular no one else could have shot something so monumentally daft and ended up with something worthwhile. And worthwhile it is though, if I am honest I must acknowledge, it's the sort of movie you'll probably enjoy a lot more if you're a bit the worse for drink.

It one of that endless succession paranoid alien takeover movies along ""Body Snatchers"" lines in which it turns out many of what appear to be our fellow humans are really horrible alien monsters bent on evil ends. It stars Roddy Piper who is not the film's strong point. He plays the sort of role Carpenter usually casts Kurt Russell as and he has none of Russell's on-screen charisma. He's a construction worker who finds a pairs of shades that turn out to be rather special and allow him to see who the evil aliens are as well as to read the subliminal messages they have plastered all over the world. These are hilariously crude: ""OBEY"", ""CONSUME"", ""MARRY AND REPRODUCE"". Etc: you get the idea... The high point is the line: ""I came here to chew bubble gum and kick ass and I'm all out of bubble gum."" Which would be enough to make any movie worth seeing whatever else it was like. The low point is the most tediously protracted fight scene in cinema history. (If you watch this on telly live the start of this is a good time to go make the coffee: you'll miss nothing).
It is, I repeat, monumentally daft. It is more funny than frightening. But it is not intended to be frightening the way ""Alien"" is frightening. It's a comic strip and for the most part it's a highly entertaining one.  I'd say, in Carpenter's film corpus, it ranks somewhere in the middle. It's nowhere near as good as say ""Escape from New York"", ""The Thing"" or ""Precinct 13"" but miles better than his more disappointing outings like ""Village of the Damned"" or ""Escape from LA"". While it's flawed in a bunch of ways it has, dud fight scene aside, that wonderful cinematic rhythm and directorial sureness of touch that makes this prolific director of, on the face of it, rather silly sci-fi and horror B-movie-style fantasies one of Hollywood's most likeable and distinctive film craftsmen.",1071014400,5,2209,4.575757575757576

With the help of a few skeptical friends and an underground movement, Piper decides that ""he's through be Daddy's little boy"" and declares war on the unwelcome visitors.
""They Live"" mixes social commentary on the ""rich get richer, poor don't get a f--king thing"" economy of the late 80's with the paranoid science fiction tales of the 50's for a good little film. It's all in good fun though as our hero takes on the alien visitors with more ammo and one-liners than you can shake a snake at. In one of the most memorable scenes, Piper and Keith David have a fist fight that literally goes on for what seems like forever. Carpenter's musical score is simple but it gets the point across. The violent finale ends with a humorous conclusion that certainly makes for an entertaining pay-off.
While I have enjoyed Carpenter's work since, I can honestly say this was probably his last truly effective pic. He has since more or less stuck to making fun but predictable genre films and re-visiting the plots of films he already made years before. Much of the same can be said for Piper who after turning in a brilliant performance with dialouge tailor-made for his unique sense of humor has been stuck on the straight-to-video roles ever since.

Despite what seems a very limited budget, this film comes off as fun, exciting, and interesting all the way through.
The plot is short, which actually does not detract from the film - rather, it's appropriately simple for the idea behind this.  I don't want to spoil it for you - just don't expect ""Lord of the Rings"" here.  When it is all said and done, this is a fun action film that is on par, quality-wise, with a lot of Schwartzenegger's movies, and has Carpenter's flair for decent science fiction.
If you decide not to buy, this would at least be worth the rental.

For instance, many horror films are outakes on Christianity.  Typically the dead guy (Jesus) is gonna get you (send ya to hell), and you make it happen because you were having sex in the first scene.
This sci-fi gem is a look at imperial capitalism and consumer culture.  It depicts life in a colonialized nation.  The freaky thing is that it is also kinda like life in the USA (other than it simply being set here in the future).  Other films have used similar alien plot devices, but TL provides the most insight into how free markets are subverted and people are cowed.

Roddy Piper (the main character) finds out that the world is being consumed by a whole bunch of aliens, which send subliminal messages using billboards or books and TV saying ""SLEEP"" ""CONSUME"" ""NO FREE THOUGHTS"" and so on. Now, how this relates to real life. I'm sure you will agree that products these days are using so much propaganda, it seems as if we are being forced to buy them. ""They Live"" points that out, for common people are being ""tricked"" into buying things. Also in the movie, money actually has printed on the phrase ""THIS IS YOUR GOD"". Money is the centre of our lives. How do we eat, have shelter, education, and everything we need that is vital to life without it? The answer is no way, unless you live in some primitive island in the middle of no where. Carpenter clearly makes that point with the film. There are other things too---how the aliens use little cameras to watch the humans (the U.S. currently does have cameras everywhere watching us), how the aliens are the ""rich"", etc..But there is one final point that Carpenter probably wanted to make. In the movie, they are aliens. The closest thing they are in real life though, is the government. Taking over. Almighty power. Taking over our lives and using us; must be things that were hinted. I do not know if that is really true myself...but it's definately something to think about.

Corny, yes.  Horribly too long and mostly unnecessary ""fight"" scene in the middle, yes.  Somewhat questionable plot, yes.  But still one of the best movies that has been put on film.
Most of the things I have ever seen on this movie only talk about the bad actors that wrestlers make.  Personally I would like to see Roddy Piper do more.  I was impressed with the performance he put in this and I think it shows that the ""characters"" that wrestlers play in the ring are just that, characters.  Badly written characters perhaps, but it is still acting and it takes at least a little talent beyond overpumped biceps to play them well.  A few instances of his WWF character leaked through into this movie, but for the majority of it he was totally believeable.  He gave what I would consider to be an excellent performance regardless of his status as a pro-wrestler.  He didn't just give a good peroformance ""for a wrestler"" he gave a performance that *any* actor should be proud of.
Yes the movie was a bit on the cheesy side.  It was supposed to be.  This isn't some deep thoughts movie that the brie and beret set would go see at Sundance or something, it was intended as an entertaining way to spend 94 minutes of your time.  It isn't a large philosophical treatise on the state of the human condition, it is a cool story that lets you escape to another place for a while.

This might not be the best sci-fi movie ever made, and our economic/class separation reality isn't quite as harsh as portrayed by the movie, but sometimes to critique something you have to exaggerate it a bit.

It gets better if you read the conspiracy books by David Icke, who states explicitly that our rulers are just aliens or alien hybrids that took over the Earth in ancient times and have been running the show since then.

If you buy into this or not, the movie is semi-entertaining, but is not for those who get spooked really easily because the thought of these ugly aliens being your next door neighbors is very creepy.
This movie does raise some issues of why humanity is so easily controlled and where humanity might end up if people don't wake up to the fact that they are being controlled by forces that are not easily understood.

970592,5,6305077754,"This is certainly the most discussed Carpenter's work today. And one of his best films. A unemployed, homeless man, named John Nada - Nada for nothing - and played by wrestler Roddy Piper, arrives in L.A. from Colorado and discovers, thanks to some special sunglasses, that the top levels of our society (politics, business, show-business, police, army, medias, etc.) is ruled by infiltrated aliens who have turned the earth to their law - the law of money and profit, through the annihilation of any human conscience. The first reflex he has is shoot any of them, as many as possible, no matter if he's wanted by everybody after that. Soon, he and a big Black guy (Keith ""The Thing"", ""Platoon"" David) he succeeded in opening his eyes after a famous long fight sequence, are the only ones to be able to break the situation and give the Earth back to the human kind.
The most disturbing aspect of this tale, is less that fact than the attitude of many humans (including the main female character, the only real 'bad' one created by Carpenter in his career, along with ""Christine"", the living car with a girl name, able to have deadly feelings) who know about the presence and purpose of the aliens, and collaborate with them (sell their souls to the Devil) in order to make personal fortunes, with a complete despise for their own kind. So we can say that this movie is also a version of the Faust myth, as well as a hard, modern version of Jack Finney's ""Body Snatchers"" (the infiltrated aliens) and George Orwell's ""1984"" (the subliminal messages invisible to the human eye, that Big Brother'd have appreciated).
But finally, Carpenter has certainly made this movie to show his very pessimistic vision of the human being, only interested in making as much money as possible, no matter how (the hell with dignity), and to ask a big question: does this alien society really exist? Do we really live in a system ruled by strangers from outer space (assimilated by Carpenter to the republicans) and encouraging non-stop consumption and race to money and fake happiness? Much stronger - and better - to ""The Matrix"", eleven years before, and very, very disturbing. Big John's anger at its top.",1023321600,5,2189,4.7631578947368425

The story revolves around a drifter (ex-wrestler Roddy Piper) who stumbles upon X-ray specs that reveal the literal ugliness under the skin of upper-class Americans.  As it turns out, everyone is 'selling out' in an effort to snuff out the lower class, until Piper and fellow struggler Keith David join up with a resistance movement to tear down the system.
""They Live"" shows Carpenter in top form.  He takes the material in many different directions, dabbling in action, sci-fi (the black-and-white POV shots are creepy and effective), and even physical comedy (the drawn-out streetfight in the middle of the film is a riot), all while keeping the underlying satire the main focus.  If this film was misunderstood upon its initial release (which Carpenter says it was), now is the time to rediscover it, seeing as how the issues it addresses (television as a form of mind control, the increasing importance of wealth if you hope to survive in the world) have only snowballed into the 1990s and will no doubt continue well into the future.",997574400,6,1294,5.0093023255813955

970600,4,6305077754,"The concept behind this movie--that space aliens in disguise run this planet & enslave working class humans--may be harder to swallow than Marx's class-war scenarios, but I enjoy the way it unfolds throughout the first part of the movie. The genius of taking a social situation and explaining it with a bizarre conspiracy fires the dynamo of this movie's appeal. I dare you to look at politics today & tell me grotesque extra-terrestrials in disguise don't run the nation! We're living the sequel: THEY LIVE 2, How Space Aliens Stole Election 2K!
This movie is set in the great Reagan/Bush Era worker displacement & recession. The Wise Republican Presidents had lowered taxes, increased government size, increased government spending (duh!), and grossly increased the national debt (DUHHH!!!) While this created great contentment among the upper crust, it also produced lots of unemployed & displaced workers, ready to do anything for a buck.
Our hero wants to work, but can only get day labor, off the books. He lives at a homeless encampment & notices a brutal raid by the LAPD on a small church with an ensuing dragnet through the homeless encampment. He follows clues and comes to see the world through new lenses, lenses that reveal a stark contrast between appearance and underlying reality. Once the blinding dazzle of consumer society has been blocked, the hero can better see the how the media controls the populace. I found this metaphor brilliant--appealing to both mind and heart. Without it, the movie would have lost a star.
The first part of the flick is innovative and original. I like the way the underlying premise is slowly revealed. But once the secret is out of the bag, the movie deteriorates rapidly. My son, age 12 when he first watched it with me, kept saying ""Dad, why doesn't he do ______?"" Sure enough, a few seconds later, the hero would do exactly that! Although the basic premise and some of the underlying metaphors deserve 6 stars, the predictability, and gradual erosion of creativity throughout the movie knocks it down to a four star flick.
There are good reasons why this movie never won any awards at Cannes. But it's still fun to watch at least once, and then maybe again with your kids. If you're a 12-year-old boy, it's probably fun to watch every weekend until you're 13.
This movie does have one of the most memorable bad lines of any movie in it, one nearly worth the price of purchase:

Let me tell you that Roddy Piper does a very good job acting in  this.  He had no experience in any feature film before (Unless you call WWF  REALLY acting! )  And that fight seen with Keith David is worth the price  of the DVD alone.  If there is any problem it is that there are no extras  on this DVD.  Sound are picture quality are decent but the best you find on  anything that is out there.  This movie is a cult-classic so buy it... you  won't be disappointed!,963100800,7,912,4.252941176470588
970675,4,6305077754,"The film has one of the best choreographed - and quite lengthy - fight scenes between stars Roddy Piper and Keith David.  The guys really pulled no punches, and, obviously may have connected a couple. Movie: 3. Fight: 5",962409600,2,219,4.615384615384615
970676,5,6305077754,"In this Carpenter entree', Rowdy Roddy Piper is a drifter who comes to town looking for work.  He ends up in a homeless camp, where some strange doings are going on in the abandoned church next door.
  When he  investigates, he finds some sunglasses and snags a pair.  When he puts them  on, shocker!  There is a strange black & white vision, which reveals  hidden messages in the advertising, and that the rich are really aliens  subjugating the humans.
  The only part of this film I didn't like was  the extremely ridiculous and drawn out fight/wrestling match to decide  whether or not his friend will put a pair of the sunglasses on.
  Don't miss the classic ""gum"" line, when Piper enters the bank!",962150400,3,703,4.6016260162601625
970677,5,6305077754,"This is not 'Bycycle Thieves'. It hasn't any real depth of  characterisation and doesn't really ewoke any deep feelings. This is not  what this film is about. This film is information, period. Yuppies are  revealed as coming from another planet, using human beings as cattle. Of  course, this is not so in 'reality', but the metaphore is most accurate.  After having seen this, I marvelled at how it was ever allowed to be  produced. When You look at John Carpenter's career after this movie, it  seems as if he was heavily punished for doing this film. This film is his  testament and it is a very brave one. No other director has ever been that  brave with the possible exception of Barry Levinson doing 'Wag the Dog'.  Have You heared anything from Barry after 'Wag the Dog'?",961372800,3,778,4.613138686131387
970678,5,6305077754,"My favorite director is named John Carpenter. And this is his Sci-Fi/Thriller in which I've grown up with and been gripped with. The ideas in this film are amazing, aswell as its main plot. It seems  buger-head aliens have taken over the planet, and we don't know anything  about it. Roddy Piper gets down and dirty with the skeleton-like E.T.'s.  Giving us movie buffs, such memorable lines! Carpenter will never get the  respect he deserves. But us fans, will always let him know...he rules!",949449600,3,493,4.833333333333333
970679,5,6305077754,"I thought this movie kicked but.  Roddy Piper did a nice job outside the ring. The aliens were the coolest though, how they lived among us is the creepiest thing about them.",949363200,,173,4.40625
970680,4,6305077754,"I agree that ""They Live"" is a wonderful, sharp film, and this has already been stated within these pages. So, I wanted to voice my enthusiasm for this great DVD transfer in its original theatrical aspect  ratio of 2:35:1 . The film is crisp and colorful, and although the disc  contains no extras (not even a trailer!), the great transfer alone makes it  a must-have for any fan of this great film.",947289600,6,398,4.5
970756,5,6305077754,"This movie works on a number of levels,  it is an excellant satire of greed and the me me culture of the 80's, and on another level it is a great sci-fi movie including all the much used and much loved sci-fi standards of  alien invaision and control and thanks to Roddy Piper who surprises all  with the quality of his acting the fight scenes have an extra bite which  helps alot.
This movie will appeal to anyone with a interest in politics  as it is a classic example of the true nature of capitalism and the way in  which its true goal is to set people against each other and to control the  masses with consumerism.
Anyone who likes action movies, sci-fi and sharp  satire will think this movie is a blast, miss it if you dare.",945129600,10,732,4.253623188405797
970757,4,6305077754,"I saw this movie whilst tripping out on some crazy mushrooms.  It blew my f***ing mind!  Aside from the silliness of having the lead actor a pro-wrestling star, the concept of this movie is beautiful.  The  sunglasses-thing was mad cheesy, but the idea about the aliens integrated  into everyday society was awesome.  The part that really won me over was  that once he had the sunglasses on, billboards would no longer read what  they originally said, but instead commands from the aliens.  The epitomy of  this was the dollar bill that read ""This Is Your God"", also the  music was mad freaky as was the whole thing with the bums and the tv  static.  Good cult flick, albeit 80's inspired cheesiness knocks off a  star.",944870400,3,719,4.648
970758,5,6305077754,"Most has already been said here. This is an example of special subset of 'recent' sci-fi films in which we discover our reality is not so real! Other examples are: The Matrix, The Truman Show, and Dark City.
My main  addition to this topic might be the observation that, while I also find the  fight scene a bit too long, I finally came to realize its length and the  rediculous amount of beating each of the participants takes is a spoof on  professional wrestling! And who better than Roddy Piper to drive this home?  This is possibly the 'inside joke' that makes this a valid part of the  movie (IMHO)...
By the way, to give you an idea how good I thought Roddy  was in this role, when I first saw it in the theatres I noticed his name at  the head of the credits, and then it was about half an hour into the movie  that I finally recognized him as the star! He was so natural in this part  it didn't even occur to me it could have been him!

970759,5,6305077754,I was reading some of the past reviews that I saw for this movie. Most of them were good except for one that stated that the movie went to slow. Well all I can say to that person is that if the movie went to fast then you  would have complained that it is to fast. The fact of the matter is that it  is a very good movie and I would reccomend it to anybody who wants to see  an interesting si-fi movie with a twist.,939081600,,415,3.7471264367816093
970760,2,6305077754,"It takes abourt 45 minutes to lay out one of the more intriguing premises of a film, and then the final 45 minutes to knock it down with a weak shoot-em-up plot that doesn't ring true at all. Good acting by Roddy Piper  (surprise, surprise) and Keith David. My fave line: ""I am here to chew  bubblegum and kick ass... and I'm all outta bubblegum!""",936921600,,347,4.323076923076923
970761,4,6305077754,"The plot is original and very clever. Carpenter's knack for thecheesiest s dialogue, unknown actors, and the ridiculous fight scenedeter slightly from a great story. The story tells of aliens living among us, silently controlling us with subliminal devices. Only through special eyeware can one see the aliens for who they are, politicians mostly. The story is great, action is decent, acting is so-so and the ending is killer! If you like Sci-fi you definitely want to rent it. I know I'm putting it in my DVD collection!
