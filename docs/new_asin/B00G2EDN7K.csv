8620172,1,B00G2EDN7K,This production is full of misrepresentations formed by the Leftist collectivist mind.  It is full of double standards and lies.  Only watch this if you want to be indoctrinated in the Leftist victim mentality.,1519516800,,210,5.147058823529412
8620173,5,B00G2EDN7K,"Every U.S citizen and member of the U.S. government needs to watch this film.  In fact, every person in the world who is concerned about people in the Middle East, especially the people in Israel and Palestine, needs to watch this film.  People supporting human rights for Israelis and Palestinians are left wondering why the Israeli people continue to support policies that dispossess, oppress, and dehumanize Palestinian people.  Israelis need security, but the Palestinians need security too.  It's shocking that the U.S. Congress funds Israel's apartheid policies and that Americans know so little about how Israel is oppressing the Palestinians.  Israel's oppressive policies will only lead to more conflict and victimization on both sides.  The white ruling minority in South Africa were persuaded to end their brutal apartheid policies after a decades-long struggle.  How long will it take Israelis to realize how much harm they are doing, both to themselves and to the Palestinians, by systematically oppressing the Palestinian people?",1468627200,2,1043,5.48125
8620174,5,B00G2EDN7K,this is so powerful yet hard to get and expensive when found.  I smell censorship by the likes of APEC or mosad.  It should be shown in schools and libraries.,1429833600,,158,4.233333333333333
8620175,5,B00G2EDN7K,"Virtually all Americans know very well about the apartheid in South Africa, but very few Americans know about the apartheid in Israel.  And it appears that many refuse to even find out.
I hope my fellow Christians will watch this film, investigate the issue for themselves, pray for the truth NO MATTER WHERE IT LEADS, and read their Bible instead of listening to ""Christian"" Zionist ministers who either don't know the Bible or have an agenda.

""Do not be deceived: God is not mocked, for whatever one sows, that will he also reap."" (Galatians 6:7)",1428883200,2,549,4.768421052631579
8620176,4,B00G2EDN7K,"This video hightlights the parallels between the way minorities were treated in South Africa and the way Christian and Muslim Arabs are currently treated in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. There is input from Israelis, Palestinians,
and South Africans. There is so much history here that I think they should have made this at least two hours. I can't
really argue with the points they are trying to make though. Short but effective.",1413763200,4,439,4.866666666666666
8620177,5,B00G2EDN7K,"The images are indelible. This is a skillfully and deftly illustrated comparison of apartheid in South Africa and Palestine. If you think you know all there is to know about this subject, or/and man's-inhumanity-to-man, you will be amazed, saddened and gratefully better informed after viewing this DVD. Gracefully, poignantly and delicately narrated by  Alice Walker.",1413590400,3,368,5.6909090909090905
8620178,5,B00G2EDN7K,"Recommended by WBAI-FM radio in New York City, I have never seen such a comprehensive comparison of the situation between the Palestinians and Israelis, and the apartheid regime in South Africa. For the first time, I really understand what has been happening to the Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank. This film is highly relevant at this time for those who seek to understand the recent intifadah between Hamas in Gaza and Israel.",1410307200,5,435,4.891891891891892
8620179,5,B00G2EDN7K,"Roadmap To Apartheid exposes the brutality Israel exacts on the Palastinians in a way that was hidden from the world - until now. Compounded with the recent indiscriminate bombings killing children and civilians, I recommend everyone to watch this video because it expels the, ""We Are The Victim"" propaganda Israel uses as its mantra. I remember participating in the divestment movement of Apartheid South Africa when I was a student. Now, I believe, is time to mobilize the same movement against Israel if it does not change its Apartheid policies.",1409184000,5,549,5.111111111111111
