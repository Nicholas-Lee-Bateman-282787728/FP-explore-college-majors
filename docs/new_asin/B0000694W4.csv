1733037,3,B0000694W4,"This movie is hokey, but since so few companies want to spend any money making film about public speaking, we have few choices. This one film is pretty watchable and has good, practical information that can help students better understand how to develop and deliver speeches.",1362182400,,275,5.0
1733038,5,B0000694W4,I use this in my classroom of middle school students. I think the format is excellent mixing meaningful info with humor.,1357344000,,120,4.761904761904762
1733039,1,B0000694W4,This whole program was nothing but people being silly.  I understand they were likely trying to take a boring topic and make it more interesting but it just seemed that they were making fun of everything.  Don't waste your money!,1346457600,,229,4.7
1733040,4,B0000694W4,All of the Standard Deviant stuff is good but is very fast-paced so it is not introductory material but review.  The video is packed with great information but you almost have to stop it ever few minutes to take notes because you are so overwhelmed by all they present.  I'd rather do that than not have any meaningful content though.,1257984000,2,334,4.55
1733041,5,B0000694W4,"This is a very balanced program on public speaking. It cover almost all the basics you would need to make a speech . From writing and organizing the content for a speech right down to the mechanics of delivery. It is an excellent resource for beginners as well as experienced speakers to really lock down the basics of public speaking.  Although the cover and the standards deviants style can be quite corny , they do quite well for themselves on this instructional dvd. And at  such a low price , its almost a sin for someone interested in public speaking not to buy this dvd.",1255132800,3,577,4.485714285714286
1733042,5,B0000694W4,"Everyone is terrified to speak in public.

Most public speaking educational or training materials are formal and boring.

This video make learning to speak in public both fun and interesting.

I would recommend this video for almost all age groups.",1224115200,4,248,5.15
1733043,5,B0000694W4,This DVD is excellent for preparing for a Dantes public speaking review.  I used this DVD and passed my Dantes public speaking test.  Highly recommended!!!,1215734400,5,155,5.16
1733044,4,B0000694W4,This was a great video for helping novices with making presentations. It was presented in a very light format but contained valuable information. It was most helpful and held my attention throughout the video. Well done!,1171238400,8,220,5.138888888888889
1733045,4,B0000694W4,"The main menu consists of a min or two on faking confidence in communication apprehension, using supporting materials, organizing your presentation (comparisons, persuading the audience including Monroe's), delivering the speech, style of speech (clarity, rhythm, parallel wording) & the delivery, the moment of truth closing (body apearance, language, eye contact, vocal varation.)

I did learn a few things since I did not take public speaking in high school nor in college. It was very easy to follow with included exadurated almost silly presentation examples to every point they taught, but never allowing it to be too moronic.

I rented this at my library, be sure to check yours.",1150070400,16,686,5.342592592592593
7965678,5,B0000694W4,"This dvd was very helpful to my Speech 101 students. It's jammed pack with information about various components needed to write any type of essay. It even breaks down the types of essays.  I liked how it went right along with the textbook. Please have an open mind and sense of humor when watching. I liked the waves of humor. For the price, this dvd does deliver. And I will continue to use it for this class.",1520640000,,410,4.324675324675325

7965681,5,B0000694W4,"This recording makes public speaking, and public speaking instruction, fun.",1471564800,,75,6.6
7965682,5,B0000694W4,"Very handy, not as funny as many of their presentations but good solid advice.",1469491200,,78,4.642857142857143
7965683,2,B0000694W4,"I tried to show my Effective Oral Communication class this video, but they grew irritated by the screeching music continuously playing in the background. They begged me to turn it off. I rated it 2 stars because before I shut it off, the troupe does offer some good tips, but it was too unbearable to continue.",1400630400,,310,4.553571428571429
7965684,5,B0000694W4,Standard Deviants always have great educational DVDs and this one fits the bill.  It was the perfect DVD to learn about Public Speaking.  We even showed the DVD to some of my son's friends so they could learn about public speaking as well.,1399507200,,239,4.534883720930233

7965686,3,B0000694W4,It's an OK product. I purchased it for my 9 year old son and wasn't very engaging or interesting for him.,1373414400,,105,4.0476190476190474
7965687,5,B0000694W4,I am not sure about this series so hopefully Std Deviants is a good series of educational dvds to own,1371859200,,101,4.1
