8572921,5,B001B34N3A,I love this workout video! I can really feel the difference in my body after a short while.,1456876800,,91,4.111111111111111
8572922,5,B001B34N3A,"I purchased this video because I like the instructor, Jonathan Urla and wanted a different Pilates workout. It does not disappoint! Jonathan does not have an annoying style like some of the other instructors & the workout is somewhat challenging. After I do this workout, I feel that I have accomplished something as opposed to feeling like I am just going through the motions. More importantly, I feel like I have gotten a good workout! The weights are definitely a plus and take a Pilates workout to a new level. I think that the length (60 mins) is just right. I would highly recommend this video for anyone who is interested in a good Pilates workout.",1398384000,3,655,4.655172413793103
8572923,5,B001B34N3A,"I am Pilates instructor and find the incorporation of ankle weights as extremely beneficial in linking the matwork with the equipment.  Joseph Pilates used weighted shoes when teaching mat therefore, the user is performing the work closer to the original ideals of Mr. Pilates.  Excellent job Jonathan keeping the work diversified!  The standing free weight section is excellent for building upper body strength while incorporating balance, a necessary addition to any Pilates practice.  While some exercises with the added weight may be challenging, do not become discouraged.  Pilates does not require extra reps and your body responds quickly and you will see noticeable difference with each workout. I highly recommend this dvd to anyone looking to add strength and a bit of cardio to your Pilates routine!",1246147200,12,810,5.346456692913386
