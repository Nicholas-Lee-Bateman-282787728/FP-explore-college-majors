2559965,5,B000FBSN76,Lo Meng is really a stand out in this. It features most of the Venoms and has some great fight scenes.,1478304000,,102,3.9047619047619047
2559966,4,B000FBSN76,"Great movie. The Kung fu was superb. Love the Venom mob. What can I say, its a Shaw brother production.",1472860800,,103,4.2
2559967,1,B000FBSN76,Low rating is because this movie isn't in English.,1463961600,,50,4.666666666666667
2559968,5,B000FBSN76,Perfect! This is what I was looking for! I'm pleased that the movie was in the original Chinese language and not dubbed and had the subtitles this time. The last few movies I purchased from Amazon instant video didn't say whether or not they were subtitled and in the original language and others said subtitled but were dubbed so I was happy with this one! Classic kung fu movie starring 3 of the venom mob.,1459209600,3,408,4.453333333333333
2559969,4,B000FBSN76,Excellent movie!,1456963200,,16,7.5
2559970,1,B000FBSN76,"This version is a Red Sun bootleg, buy the newly remastered ""Sword Masters"" edition and support legit Shaw Brothers releases.",1231113600,,125,5.3
2559971,4,B000FBSN76,"Two Champions of Shaolin combines some great elements: four of the six Venoms, lots of action and a variety of weapons.  The combination makes for an enjoyable kunf fu movie.  The plot is basically shaolin vs. wu tan.  As usual for the Venom flims, Lu Feng plays the major villain and does not disappoint.  Lo Meng plays the protagonist with support from Sun Chien and Chiang Sheng.  Some other faces appear to round out a great cast and a somewhat interesting plot (for a kung fu film).  Two Champions of Shaolin delivers lots of action and great fight scenes.  Venom fans should enjoy this one.  The only major thing missing from this film is Philip Kwok.",1208736000,,657,4.603448275862069
2559972,4,B000FBSN76,"Though this movie was made prior to ""5 Deadly Venoms"" and only has 4 of the 6, it still rocks, although Wei Pai and especially Philip Kwok are sorely missed.

After graduating from the 36th chamber, Lo Meng looks to find some of his Shaolin brethren to do some scrapping with the punks at Wu-Tang.  After surviving an attack by some knives with scoliosis (on loan from the House of Flying Daggers), he is nursed back to health by Sun Chien and his sister, who teach him how to defend against future attacks.  Upon recovery he runs into fellow student Chiang Sheng and after disposing of the knife guy and company they are invited to a scrimmage against Wu-Tang.  The two are victorious, Chiang Sheng especially, and the Wu-tang decide to exact some serious revenge...which will likely elicit some further Shaolin revenge.

This movie is VERY similar to ""Showdown at the Cotton Mill"", with Lo Meng and Lu Feng replacing Chi Kuan Chun and Dorian Tan Tao Ling, respectively; though in this, the supporting cast is given a lot more depth.  I'm assuming the characters are based on real people or legends of Chinese folklore.  San Te and Pai Mei are both mentioned in this one too.  I'm not sure which is the better movie either.  They're both solid flicks.

The presentation is marvelous.  Crisp and lovely is the remastering.  The story is nothing sensational, but come on.  I thought the fights in this are actually quite a bit better than ""5 Deadly Venoms"" though the movie, on a whole, is not quite as good.  Recommended.

1980.  aka:  Two Champions of Death",1195862400,4,1558,4.669117647058823
8120432,5,B000FBSN76,"This is a Shaw Brothers sleeper. Not the best story wise but some of the best martial arts- action sequences you'll ever see hands down. A lot of well known successful big budget filmmakers could learn alot from Shaw Bros. kung fu flicks. As a special note, I wish Christopher Nolan would've studied the combat in these films before making his Batman Trilogy.",1525737600,,359,4.714285714285714
8120433,4,B000FBSN76,"We absolutely love watching these hokey films from the seventies and eighties; what with their fake weapons, ridiculous costumes and talented acrobatics. Not the type of film you want to watch if you actually expect high quality production values, but very viscerally enjoyable. My favourite part is the bright pinky red blood they always use.",1513814400,,343,5.254545454545455

8120435,5,B000FBSN76,Excellent Venoms Film. Kuo Cho is out but still great.,1503446400,,54,4.5
8120436,5,B000FBSN76,"Philip Kwouk didn't show up, but the rest of the Venom Mob got together to make this fun little number about a battle between the pro-Ming Shaolin and pro-Qing Wudang clans. Some really good fights in this, plus some crazy dagger-throwing action, and the story isn't bad, although occasionally it tries to veer into the serious more than I'd like. Chiang Sheng gets to fly around doing crazy stuff and Lo Meng gets to be superhuman again; Sun Chien doesn't stick around that long, and Lu Feng doesn't show up until late, but both have their moments. A very solid offering from the studio, as one would expect from the Venoms and Chang Cheh.",1498521600,,640,4.62280701754386
8120437,4,B000FBSN76,"One of my all time favorite Chang Cheh films!  I would've given it 5 stars but since it wasn't dubbed, I'm only giving it 4 stars.",1495497600,,130,4.0
8120438,4,B000FBSN76,"This movie is in Mandarin with English subtitle.  Good story and excellent kung-fu choreography.  Young man comes to town to rebel against the new emperor's government officials (bad guys) while the government is trying to destroy the Shaolin temples (good guys).  While new to town, the young man meets two professional dagger fighters, a brother and sister team.  The young man befriends the brother and marries the sister.  However, government officials take revenge against the family because one of their own bad guys was killed by the young man and brother.  This in turn forces the young man to take revenge against the government officials.  In the end, the good guys fight the bad guys.",1493942400,,695,4.991304347826087

8120440,5,B000FBSN76,"Many skillfully choreographed and executed fight scenes.  Good story.  Very enjoyable.  Glad it is subtitled and not dubbed!

Also there is a cool dragon painting in one scene.",1484265600,,176,5.178571428571429
