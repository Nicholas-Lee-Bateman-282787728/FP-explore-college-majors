8389188,5,B0035Q639S,As advertised. Played well with only one minor glitch that was quickly resolved. Shipped quickly.,1460851200,,97,5.533333333333333

8389190,5,B0035Q639S,"Both of these are smart, sometimes cynical but ultimately heart-warming movies, that are also hilarious.  Little Miss Sunshine probably appeals to an audience in a wider age range since it's about a multi-generational family, while Juno is probably best suited for teens and young adults since it centers around precocious, sharp-tongued, unrealistically witty teenagers; I would expect most adults over the age of 35 to find it kind of obnoxious.

TO ALL THE PEOPLE WHO WERE SHOCKED ABOUT THE LANGUAGE/ADULT CONTENT OF EITHER/BOTH OF THESE FILMS:  They *are* rated R; it says it right in the description (the part where it lists format, run-time, release date, etc).  A movie about teen pregnancy (Juno) is probably going to have some adult content, don't you think?  What makes it an especially good move is its different take on the issue--what happens when indie, intelligent, self-described dorks make a ""dumb"" mistake.  And Little Miss Sunshine, a sometimes bleak but overall touching and just plain simple, cool movie, centers around a gay man who has lost his college teaching job and his lover and subsequently tries to commit suicide, then is is thrusted into the care of his quirky but well-meaning family facing their own hardships.  The language and content aren't quite as strong as Juno, but let's face it, teens are largely rebellious and foul-mouthed while they explore their blossoming adulthood.  All in all, though, I don't think Juno is all that vulgar; I would recommend it for older teens, and I would not recommend either film for children under 12.  Adults: have at it!",1390521600,,1594,5.0534351145038165
8389191,5,B0035Q639S,"daughter favorite, i did think Little Miss Sunshine would be the clean version, Juno is a very very good movie",1377475200,,110,4.55
8389192,5,B0035Q639S,These are two great shows! I assn so glad they were bundled together. Fast delivery and both shows are one you can watch over and over.,1371081600,2,135,4.230769230769231
8389193,5,B0035Q639S,"Loved these movies to begin with, but this combo pack is very inexpensive so it's even better. Good buy, would recommend to anyone.",1364774400,,131,4.739130434782608
8389194,1,B0035Q639S,I bought this on the recommendation of a friend thinking it was a family  film. She had seen it on TV which had edited it for TV. I was really disappointed in the language used in this. I would not let my grandchildren see it. I don't understand why they ruin an adoreable film with language you don't want the children to hear.,1356998400,,328,4.2063492063492065
8389195,4,B0035Q639S,"Very pleased with the product.  I think the prices for mailing fee's is a little high especially since it's almost the cost of the purchase of the video...I know ""bookprice"" mail fees are not that much...but thanks anyway",1290988800,,221,4.815789473684211
