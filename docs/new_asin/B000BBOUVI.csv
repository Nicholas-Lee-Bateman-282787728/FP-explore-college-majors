2411621,2,B000BBOUVI,"I LOVE this show, but I think it's ridiculous that you have to spend more money to buy the seasons all together than if you buy each one on its own.  Save some money and buy each one separately - you still get free shipping.  Enjoy!",1141516800,3,232,4.021739130434782
2411622,5,B000BBOUVI,"The quick, witty dialogue of Gilmore Girls is an homage to screwball comedy films like His Girl Friday and Bringing Up Baby.  It works surprising well, largely because there are different levels of speed talking: Some characters can keep up, others get lost, and some try on certain days and prefer to be normal people on other days.  References and allusions abound as well.  Some of the cultural references are highly obscure - that is, even with your ability to pause and rewind the world of Gilmore Girls, there are times when even the viewer can't keep up.  This is all part of the fun of a dialogue-driven comedy that serves its main characters far too much coffee and a hilarious amount of food.

When the plot turns serious and the dialogue slows down, the sparkling planned community shimmers away as the stuff of real life creates drama.  I appreciate that the writers understand the need to feel drama slowly.  You can't banter through it, because only happy people relish in clever games.

It's hard to explain how a show about mostly white, middle class people living in a crime-free fantasy has become so popular, especially on the WB, which has been one of the few channels to embrace all of America's cultures, races, classes, and so on.  I think the answer is that the relationship between a single mother and her daughter and an absentee father is highly translatable to many Americans.  There are many conversations detailing Lorelai's struggles to provide for her daughter.  Viewers also empathize with the weird and uncomfortable encounters with rich, elitist people, namely, Lorelai's parents.

The DVDs are somewhat lacking in extras - a making-of video and some extended or extra scenes are all you get.  I think fans of the show would enjoy a dialogue dictionary of all of the references the characters make, a list of the books Rory and Jess are always reading, a map of Stars Hollow, a coffee cup, and Sookie's recipes.",1141430400,8,1946,4.807807807807808
2411623,5,B000BBOUVI,"Never heard of the gilmore girls before. My my where do you come from? :-)

Its the perfect series for the whole family - something to laugh with, something to cry - to think and love but be warned: there is a very VERY high chance of you falling in love with it and finding it hard to let go.

Enjoy!",1140739200,2,301,3.918032786885246
2411624,5,B000BBOUVI,"I can't say strongly enough how great this show is. Gilmore Girls is witty, funny, true to life, creative, and educational. Each episode fits more dialogue into it than any other show I've seen. I don't know how the actors learn all those lines! My sisters (in Montana and Oklahoma) and I (in Virginia) call each other long distance just to talk about a certain episode we've just seen. Some of the lines from various shows have become a part of our normal conversation because the wording is just so perfect (ex. ""Spry and accommodating"" referring to Luke). I love having the first five seasons on DVD (from Amazon) and can't wait to own season 6.",1138492800,3,648,4.594827586206897
2411625,4,B000BBOUVI,"Gilmore Girl's is by far one of the wittiest shows today that manages to incorporate both drama and comedy.  The story that continues through the first five seasons is simply about a mother and daughter that are best friends and are, in their own ways, maturing together.  It shows real relationship dynamics and that families are not just what you're born into, but what you create as well.

  The cast from Gilmore Girl's is very refreshing.  Lauren Graham, whom has also performed in ""Bad Santa,"" plays Lorelai, a single mother in her thirties.  Alexis Bledel, who has appeared in ""The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants,"" plays Lorelai's daughter, Rory.  What makes this show so unique and popular is the rapid dialogue and pop culture references that permeate each episode.  The writer Amy Sherman-Palladino outdoes herself by writing an entertaining, funny script that can also be educational.

  The range of characters, the dialogue, and the individualistic yet realistic portrayal of each character and each of their relationships are just some of the qualities that make all five seasons intoxicating.  Each character has traits that make them distinctive and memorable, and each relationship is painted just as uniquely.  Every role leaves an impression.  There is no magic or over the top drama.  It is the laughter and tears of real life, along with all the struggles and fun that accompany it.

  Each season comes with a synopsis guidebook to each episode, and enlightening extras.  The guidebook is a quick reference point if you're looking for a favorite episode or if you just want to know what's coming up next.  Each season has an episode in the extras that does pop ups for each reference made in that season.  Wonderful behind the scenes footage and fun interviews can also be found in the extras.

  Everyone, not just mothers and daughters, can enjoy all five episodes.  Anyone who loves witty conversation and a realistic and interesting group of characters would love this series.  If you like characters that you can relate to and that really pull at your heart, then get ready to fall for the Gilmore Girls.",1137888000,5,2134,4.954802259887006
2411626,5,B000BBOUVI,I LOVE Amazon. It just took 5 days to get to Aruba. I was really surprised how its was shipped so quick to me. I just have to say its a really treat to have all of the 5 season at home. I am just dying to get my hand on season 6 which it has not been made yet but for sure I will  buy it from here again.,1137369600,2,304,3.342857142857143
2411627,5,B000BBOUVI,"Might as well save you money and buy all the seasons at once! Gilmore Girls is a must have!!!! Witty with a cap ""W"". Can not get enough. Great to watch with my young teen children also. They love the wit and learning the Gilmore-isms(Insert labeled with each episode). My kids and it will pull a Lorelai & Rory by vegging out in front of the t.v. with junk food and watch episode after episode. It may not be wise for one's diet, but it a blast for all! I have lost some sleep by my kids asking me, ""One more episode, please!"" But they do not have to twist my arm that hard. :)

You love wit and charm...you do NOT want to miss this!!!",1136851200,5,635,4.0396825396825395
8084829,3,B000BBOUVI,"I was really happy when I found this set at such a good price. I bought them for my mothers birthday and she was so surprised and happy! The shipping was super fast which was nice since I waited until the last minute to order :) Last night though, my mother told me that one of the disks was blank. I'm not very happy about the fact that we will be missing those shows and will probably never see them since we do not have cable or dish network. I would think that before selling an item to someone, that person would check the product to make sure it was functioning correctly. Ecspecially since the product was used and already open. Ive never ran across a product that did not function like it should from Amazon. Im not sure what to do about the blank disk. I just hope other people don't get the same problem I ran across.",1322956800,,827,4.2075471698113205
8084830,3,B000BBOUVI,"I received the shipment timely.  I ordered the ""new"" dvds, but the first season (the only one we've watched so far) seems to have a lot of glitches.  I can't tell if the dvds are defective, but it is nearly impossible to watch due to the poor quality of the dvds.  We are going to try ""repairing"" the dvds, but if that doesn't work, we'll have to return them.",1231200000,,359,4.173913043478261
8084831,5,B000BBOUVI,If you buy them seperately it is $180.  You save $60+ by buying them individually.  BUY them individually!,1146614400,5,106,4.833333333333333
8084832,5,B000BBOUVI,"I love Gilmore girls, don't get me wrong, but getting the five season boxed set doesn't make sense!  Add up the pirce of each of the individual seasons (from Amazon) and your total comes to $159.52, plus each of them qualifies for free super saver shipping.  Why spend the extra money?

Get the shows though, I have gotten my entire family hooked just from watching season 1!",1143590400,5,375,4.567164179104478
8084833,5,B000BBOUVI,"A must for all Gilmore Girls Fans, all episodes are included, obviously comercial free and each set comes with many bonus features and unaired scenes...absolutly great, would recommanded to anyone. Great Family Show, gets everyone together!",1143072000,,240,5.694444444444445

8084835,5,B000BBOUVI,Superb!! I am in OZ and they have stopped us 3 episodes into season 5!! and skipped heaps from the other seasons!! Worth every cent!!!,1142467200,,134,4.4
8084836,5,B000BBOUVI,Really enjoyed viewing the first 5 series in correct sequence without missing a second. (Australia has yet to complete series 5 on free to air and pay tv stopped half way through too!!) The Gilmorism booklets referencing quotes used on the show are great fun to browase through. Looking forward to Series 6 becoming available!,1142380800,,326,4.945454545454545
8084837,5,B000BBOUVI,"Great series, great actors.

The only thing that I would change would be to have more special features.

Love the little Gilmorism books to each series, hated that season 5 didn't have one though.

Any fan of the Gilmore Girls will be delighted to own this set. It is more than worth the price.",1141948800,2,294,4.407407407407407
