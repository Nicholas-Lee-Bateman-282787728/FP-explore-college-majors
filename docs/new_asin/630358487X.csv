7851964,1,630358487X,"I have a 2 1/2 year son who loves Thomas.  We have 'Thomas & the Toy Workshop' video which is appropriate for his age.  The characters are friendly and encouraging, and the lessons are uplifting.  The 'Special Letter' has a different tone.  Toppum Hatt & the engines seem grumpy & frown more often.  The lessons are also disappointing. In one episode, Scruffy the truck learns he shouldn't make fun of engines after an offended engine pulls so hard that Scruffy is pulled apart.  The scene frightened my son.",1227830400,,508,4.715909090909091
7851965,5,630358487X,"Thomas & the Special Letter was great. We got to see lots of the little engines including Skarloey, Reneas, Duncan, Rusty, Sir Handle and Peter Sam. Stories are great, they include:

Thomas & the special letter A: When Sir Topham Hatt gets a letter from a child who lives in the big city, all the engines are very excited about going to the big city. But could Thomas' accident cause him to miss out on the trip?

Rock 'N' Roll B: When Duncan gets stuck in the tunnel because of his rock 'n' roll, Skarloey, who hasn't met Duncan yet, must rescue him.

Home At Last B: All the Engines are looking forward to seeing Skarloey as he comes back from the works.

Steam Roller B: All the engines tease Sir Handle about his wheels but soon enough, Sir Handel gets a chance to show the other engines that his wheels are very special indeed.

Toad Stands By A: Toad and Oliver teach the freight cars a lesson they'll never forget.

Bowled out B: See how all the engines get rid of a smelly diesel.

Final Score: 8 out of 10",1096329600,10,1014,4.277486910994765
7851966,5,630358487X,"One of the things I really like about Thomas the Tank Engine is the little engines. This video along with three or four others, has a lot of these stories containing the little engines. Lately they've put one or two little engine stories every other tape. Rusty's face sure did get bigger. Home at last makes you wonder why Skarloey's repairs took so short and he gets back and Rheneas still isn't home. And appartently there were so many changes while he was gone so he must have been gone awhile. Oliver had a good episode in this one too and so does Stepney. The Diesel from Bowled out reminded me of a combination of Daisy and Diesel becasue he didn't lie or make so many insults but he was still very rude. Duncan pretty funny because he's so stubborn. Peter Sam is innocent and friendly to others unlike Sir Handel but he hasn't been even mentioned in any recent ones. They also discontinued his train so I wonder if he's not on it anymore. That would be a shame becasue Rock N Roll was pretty good. This tape has no bad episodes and I would recommend it to any Thomas lover.",1076630400,3,1081,4.356435643564357
