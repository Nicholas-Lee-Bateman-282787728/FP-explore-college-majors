8530973,1,B008VJPBP6,"We had to order this dvd twice: the first disk was unplayable due to the noise it made; the second disk was playable but it froze and ""stuttered"" in places about halfway through. The movie itself was quite good?  We like both Anthony Spall and Imogene Poots (what a name!).",1453161600,,273,4.46
8530974,3,B008VJPBP6,"Seems a lot of folk are championing this flick and I can't say as I see why. It's not a bad yarn but there are any number of hostages flicks have been done better.

Here's the scoop. Sam Smith (Craig Roberts) is a go-for at a very high end hotel. He's all plans and no action but wants to hit the big time. He starts his assertiveness by going to an exclusive jewelry shop on an errand for his boss where he will try to hit up on the beauty that works there. While there, two thugs enter to do some robbing. Things go south and Sam, the girl and the shop's owner find themselves hostages.

Hostage flicks are nearly as old as film itself. It's great fodder for drama and exploring the human condition. One of the problems with this flick is that not much happens. It all seems so quiet. There are some outbursts and postures of defiance but I never felt enough tension. Then there's the main perp. Seems to me that a guy with such an awful stutter shouldn't have chosen a life of crime. You can pick him out of a crowd. Then he furthers his stupidity by choosing a dim bulb partner. And what's with his nearly losing it while listening to ""Madame Butterfly?"" This guy is way too vulnerable to be a hood. But I digress. As I said this just seemed so lackluster. I didn't care enough about anyone or their personal situation. They tried with some expository passages to add character depth but it fell flat to me.

The acting, editing, music and such were all decent enough. This, for me, fell flat at the script level. It's not a painful watch. I just need more meat on the bone.",1396915200,,1578,4.270903010033445
8530975,4,B008VJPBP6,"This movie isn't for the impatient. The plot moves slowly, there are maybe four settings total, and some of the conversations drag a bit. Also, the movie is fairly predictable, which detracts a bit from the overall enjoyment. Some subplots were underdeveloped and should have been ignored altogether.

But, I was pleasantly surprised. The chemistry between the actors and the subtleties were enough to carry it.",1388448000,,411,5.2272727272727275
8530976,5,B008VJPBP6,"Wonderfully entertaining.  One of, if not the best films I've seen this year!  Why haven't we heard more about this?",1372550400,2,116,4.75
8530977,5,B008VJPBP6,"I absolutely loved this movie. I had no idea what I was getting into when I turned it on, and was pleasantly surprised. ""Comes a Bright Day"" is a bank heist movie that is not told like a typical bank heist movie. Sure, there is action and violence, but there is so much more. The film centers on five main characters (two robbers and three hostages) who are thrust together after an attempted heist of a jewelry store goes terribly wrong.

The story focuses more on the characters than the dangerous situation they find themselves in, yet you are never allowed to forget that their lives could end at any moment.

I was caught up in the direction--the film was wonderfully shot. It was also hard to not get caught up in the beautiful Imogen Poots, who I hope to see in many films to come. She was stunning -- both in beauty and in her quiet, powerful performance.

""Comes a Bright Day"" has it all -- action, crime, humor, love, loss, and coming-of-age romance. If you are looking for ""Ocean's 11,"" this ain't it. If you are looking for a more cerebral thriller that focuses more on the characters than convenient plot twists, I highly recommend this movie.",1362441600,4,1156,4.521531100478469
8530978,3,B008VJPBP6,"This movie needed more development of its characters. Kevin McKidd created an interesting character and his performance was excellent. His character hinted at an interesting past. However, other than having problems communicating with people because of a stutter, we never know what led his character to be the  person he became. I wanted to like this movie more but couldn't help wanting more depth to the characters.",1358208000,2,418,5.2388059701492535
