234140,5,6300213897,"This is one of my favorite movies!  All though I was 13 when I saw this (when it was released) I just found it very funny (and I still do).  Burt Reynolds was over looked for an Academy Award for the best performance he has ever given!  His lady co-stars did get nominations!  Just think of this ""Burt Reynolds"" plays a man with very little self-esteme. He play a quite college teacher who loves his wife but finds himself single when he was happily married!  The introduction scene to his new love interest is one of the funniest moments ever on film!  ( If you have only seen this on Free TV your missing alot) To say anymore would be a crime!  However anybody who has human heart will relate to  this!",1114473600,,704,4.28030303030303
234141,4,6300213897,"""Starting Over"" is one of the most true to life movies about break-ups and new relationships that has ever been filmed. Burt Reynolds proves that he can truly portray a painfully human role in this 1979 classic. His character is likable, realistic and at the right times, humorous. Jill Clayburgh is a delight as a seasoned and sensitive single gal. Candice Bergen is the emotional and selfish ex-wife which she plays to the tee.

In the first few minutes of the movie it is evident of how well this movie was cast and produced. The movie was intended to be a romantic comedy which it acheives very well. As an added plus it takes a very realistic approach to the pains of divorce, dating, and everything that comes with being single again.

For those of us that are past 35 and have experienced the ""starting over"" stage of life, or are currently experiencing it, this is a movie to see. The crazy things we do, the scary and the just plain strange is all here. By watching this we can find a little solace in our feelings and laugh at ourselves as well!! Enjoy!!",1113868800,,1064,4.479381443298969
234142,5,6300213897,"This is one of the great cult classic romantic comedies, right up there with ""The Heartbreak Kid.""  The writing by James Brooks is, as always, smart, dry, and very funny; and Alan J. Pakula gets great performances from everyone in the amazing cast.  (I've always thought Charles Durning is one America's best character actors.) I have to disagree with one of the other reviewers who thought Jill Clayburgh was miscast.  Her performance is charming and droll, a perfect match for Burt Reynolds, who gives a great performance that works particularly well because he's playing against type -- a macho star who gets big laughs when, during a love scene with Clayburgh where she's groning happily, says ""I'm not that good.""

I have only one complaint about this film -- it's not available on DVD, and I can't figure out why.  Wake up, Paramount!",1092268800,18,840,4.846153846153846
234143,5,6300213897,"As a marital therapist I recommended this film to many couples struggling with their own issues throughout my professional career.
Burt Reynolds, in one of the best black comedies ever filmed,  hit a high in his career.  I have seen him with new appreciation for his tremendous talent as an actor and for the 1st time as a comedian of unequalled talent.
He is so believable, as a beloved but very bewildered newly separated male thrown into the dating world, with all the emotional baggage that accompanies everyone who's been there before.
He was so pitifully vunerable, experiencing  loneliness, regrets, second thoughts, and misery in the ever changing single world around him.  As true today as throughout the past 30 years.
This film is as meaningful today as it's ever been.  It remains the same emotional roller coaster today, leaving me emotionally drained every time I see it, yet,  again and again....
Through this film, I've become one of his most admiring fans....",1077753600,2,976,4.957055214723926
234144,5,6300213897,"This movie is an absolute delight and one of the most welcome pleasant surprises I've witnessed in watching films.  Burt Reynolds gives the best performance of his career (the fact that he didn't receive an Oscar nomination is dissapointing)as the newly divorced man trying to find his way.  The fact that he's still hung up on his wife doesn't help matters.  Jill Clayburgh is great as Burt's new woman, and Candace Bergen is a hoot as his ex wife.  Other wonderful performances by Charles Durning and Austin Pendleton, make this film worth seeing.  So many romantic comedies get it wrong, but this charmer of a film continues to hold up 25 years after it's initial release.",1069113600,4,675,4.7844827586206895

234146,4,6300213897,"I first saw ""Starting Over"" in the theatre when it first came out in the fall of 1979 and then many years later on home video and I still  find it enjoyable. It was directed by the late, great Alan J.  Pakula(""All The President's Men"" from 1976,""Sophie's  Choice"" from 1982)and the screenplay was written by James L.Brooks(one  of the writers on The Mary Tyler Moore Show in the '70's,""Terms of  Endearment"" from 1983,""Broadcast News"" from 1987, ""As  Good As It Gets"" from 1997), and starred Jill Clayburgh and Candice  Bergen and the underrated Burt Reynolds. Ms. Clayburgh was nominated for  Best Actress for her role as the school teacher looking for love,(Sally  Field won for ""Norma Rae"").Ms. Bergen was nominated for Best  Supporting Actress in her role as the aspiring songwriter(Meryl Streep won  for ""Kramer vs. Kramer"").Burt Reynolds wasn't even nominated for  his role as Phil Potter. He was  a superstar at the time and the No. 1 box  office attraction in America and it seems he was snubbed by the Academy. It  was too bad because after all he was the lead role in the picture as the  just divorced man who was starting over in a new life. The Academy did  finally give him a nomination nearly 20 years later in 1997 for his fine  performance in ""Boogie Nights"",(Robin Williams won for ""Good  Will Hunting"").At least the Academy finally recognized his work.
  ""Starting Over"" features funny supporting roles for Charles  Durning as Phil Potter's older psychiatrist brother and Frances Sternhagen  as his sister Marva Potter. The movie has many funny moments,like when  Candice Bergen,as Phil's ex-wife breaks out in song and Phil's reaction to  this musical moment.""Starting Over"" was a hit at the box-office and Mr. Reynolds was the No. 1 Box-Office attraction at the time,according to N.A.T.O.,(The National Association of Theater Owners).Mr. Reynolds was  No. 1 for four years in a row,tying Bing Crosby's record. I don't know if N.A.T.O. is around anymore and they still keep track. Burt Reynolds has said in interviews that Phil Potter  in ""Starting Over"" was his personal favorite film role. I can see  why.",966124800,25,2126,4.946175637393767

234230,4,6300213897,"I won't say this is a great film but it's a movie that is worth enjoying. I am a great fan of the director Alan J. Pakula.
I own most of his movies <Presumed Innocent><Klute><Pellican Brief><All The president's Men><Sophie's Choice><The Devi's Own> and this one.
I love them all. The great thing about this director is he is both good at romantic and action movies.
This one is a small story about Burt Reynolds who just got divorsed and meets this woman Jill Clayburgh  who lives alone. She is kind of a unique lady that sometimes hard to deal with. She is like a climate that always changes so easily.
On the other hand, his ex-wife even though had divorsed with him, she kept contact with him. I think she wants him back.
The other problem with Burt is he is afraid of a new relationship.
He do loves Jill but is afraid of sleeping with her which makes her angry. She thinks he doesn't love her because of that.
He goes to a group meeting where divorsed men talks about their problem. That meeting is funny as well. Some of the actors are quite well known in that meeting and I enjoyed that meeting very much.
But the biggest thing I laughed at was But Raynolds' laughing. It was so funny when he laughs. I don't know why but it just was so funny that I laugh out loud too whenever he laughes.
When Burt reunited with his ex-wife I was kind of sad but after all when he ran into his girlfriend and confesses that he truely loves her and the movie ends as a happy ending, I was relieved.
As I said, the movie was not a perfect one and I don't even know I will watch this again but for this once, it was quite enjoyable. Especially because there was Burt Reynolds.",1459209600,,1665,4.268987341772152

234351,3,6300213897,"Released in 1979, ""Starting Over"" is a romantic dramedy about a recently divorced man, Phil Potter (Burt Reynolds), who tries to get back into dating and finds a new potential mate (Jill Clayburgh) while the ex-wife still hovers (Candice Bergen). Charles Durning and Frances Sternhagen are on hand as the protagonist's brother and sister-in-law.

Who knew Burt could do drama? This movie proves it; and the first hour is quite entertaining, as far as romcoms go. Bergen is stunning and it's hard to see Phil settling for Clayburgh's character. In any case, amusing moments abound. Unfortunately, the last 45 minutes morph into a slow-moving bore. It's almost like they hired someone else to write the third act. If it weren't for the dull third act I'd easily give this a grade of ""B"" or 7/10. Still, this is a must-see if you're a fan of Reynolds (or Bergen, even though her role plays second fiddle to Clayburgh).

The film runs 105 minutes and was shot in the Boston area.

""Starting Over"" is a play on words because it is unclear, until near the conclusion, with whom Reynolds wants to begin again - his ex-wife or his new girlfriend played by Jill Clayburgh.  The three main characters are fabulous.  They are joined by superb character actor Charles Durning as Reynolds' older psychiatrist brother.  Members of Reynolds' divorced men's support group also give the movie a good realistic touch.  Bergen is most appropriately annoying in her role, Clayburgh is delightfully warm and sweet, and Reynolds is understandably confused and sympathetic.

Her wonderful self-centered character is supposed to be a rotten singer--and her scenes with Burt Reynolds are comic gems.  As for Mr. Reynolds, he's never been better--not even in ""Boogie Nights"".  This is his best performance.  You really feel for his character in this film as he tries to start a new life after he and his wife (Ms. Bergen) break up.  And then there's Jill Clayburgh, one of my favorite actresses of all time.  She's delightful as an insecure woman looking for love.  Both she and Candice Bergen were nominated for Oscars--and Mr. Reynolds should've been, too.  And in effective supporting roles Charles Durning, Frances Sternhagen and Austin Pendleton add their talent to this terrific film.  I cannot say enough great things about ""Starting Over""--you need to see it for yourself.  So what are you waiting for?  Go watch it right now.",1190851200,4,937,5.012987012987013
234584,3,6300213897,"It's part of movie lore that Burt Reynolds' career hit the toilet the moment he decided to do Stroker Ace instead of Terms of Endearment, but what people forget is that his previous collaboration with James L. Brooks, on the Alan J. Pakula-directed Starting Over, didn't exactly set the box-office on fire. At the time industry pundits claimed it was because he shaved his `tache for the film (no, really) but in retrospect it's probably more because this often feels a bit like a superior Lifetime TV movie, the kind of film you won't mind watching if it's on and you have nothing better to do but which you wouldn't actively seek out. There are good moments and good performances (both Candice Bergen, who delivers a trio of memorably awful songs with unashamed - intentional - incompetence and Jill Clayburgh were Oscar nominated as the ex-wife and new woman in unwilling divorcee Reynolds' life, while Charles Durning is on good understated form as his psychiatrist brother), but for all the care with which its made it just never quite catches fire.

234585,4,6300213897,"I must admit, I've had this DVD for well over a year sitting in my very small Burt Reynolds DVD collection after picking it up in a 4 for $30 offer being unable to find anything else. I finally decided to watch it and what a surprise this turned out to be. This is a very low key performance from Burt Reynolds. I can't say much more about this movie that has not been said below. I will say that the chemistry and comic timing as noted by other reviewers is seamless. Whether it was a decision by the director to restrain Reynolds from his usual good old boy performances or whether Burt Reynolds decided to play the character as he did lead to Reynolds giving a performance that I don't think has fitted him more at any other time in his career. This is a well written, well acted character piece with a light sprinkling of humor throughout. I love the scenes involving the divorced men's club that Reynolds character attends with some great scenes in Charles During's home who plays Reynolds older brother in the movie. I only have time for a handful of Reynolds movies over his career, 100 Rifles, fuzz, Deliverance, Shamus, White Lightening, The Longest Yard, Hustle, Semi-Tough, Sharky's Machine and Breaking In. I have yet to see Best Friends and Stick. Watching some of the stuff Reynolds is involved in now makes it hard to believe that it is the same person or actor that was involved in some of his best early 70's work. Smokey And The Bandit, his greatest success is also an enjoyable movie but I have always felt that it was probably more than all the flops Reynolds made in the 80's the movie that ended his career because it type cast him in that type of role. In Starting Over, Burt Reynolds showed that he was capable of much more given the right material and a good director who knew what to do with him and it's a shame more people have not seen his performance in this.",1169683200,,1889,4.415472779369628
234586,5,6300213897,"This well crafted comedy features stellar performances by its 3 top-billed stars, Clayburgh, Bergen and Reynolds; the true surprise here was the low key acting by Burt Reynolds, who plays a humble, insecure magazine writer, recently dumped by his spouse, and testing the dating waters with Jill Clayburgh, among others. Supporting roles by Charles Durning, Frances Sternhagen and Austin Pendleton round out the cast and (they) contribute to the warmth and pathos of this comedy. Phil Potter (Reynolds) has just discovered his aspiring songwriter-wife Jessica (Candace Bergen in a funny, self-deprecating role) has been having an affair with his boss and she wants out of the 8 yr. marriage to pursue her songwriting dreams. Stunned, he retreats to Boston to begin a new life with the encouragement of his psychiatrist brother Mickey (Durning) who sets him up with love-shy Marilyn Holmgren (Clayburgh) and enrolls him in group therapy. Just as Phil is finding  his footing in a relationship with the insecure Marilyn, Jessica shows up to try and woo him back, which includes a funny offkey serenading by Bergen, now a successful songwriter.

Both Clayburgh and Bergen were nominated for Oscars, but it's Reynolds (whose performance was inexplicably ignored by Oscar) who shines in a role against type - no macho, mustachioed, testosterone-laced good old boy posturing here. He plays the wounded middle-aged Phil Potter trying to make a new life for himself in an understated , sympathetic un-reynolds manner and is totally charming.

This 1979 flick was superbly directed by Alan J Pakula, and is highly recommended; also good to view around the christmas holidays.",1162512000,4,1665,5.2518796992481205
234587,5,6300213897,"I didn't realize how young Burt Reynolds is in this movie....but I love all of his romantic comedies, and was happy that amazon.com had this one.  Jill Clayburgh is well cast as the love interest and Candace Bergen is hysterical as Reynolds' soon-to-be ex-wife. No wonder she was so great (later on) as ""Murphy Brown."" The story is hilarious and yet has its warm fuzzy moments.  Great songs, too (when Bergen isn't trying to sing them herself)! Thoroughly enjoyable.",1140998400,5,466,4.886075949367089
234588,5,6300213897,"This film is a perennial favourite with me.  It's  funny, warm and charming every time.  Burt plays a man who is reluctantly splitting from his wife (Candice Bergen).  His brother, (Charles Durning) and sister-in-law (Frances Sternhagen) set him up on a blind date dinner with potential love interest (Jill Clayburgh) who tells him to look her up after he is over his break-up.
There are many funny scenes, thanks to the script, by James L. Brooks. I liked the divorced men's workshop in the church basement, the dates Burt went on and the familiar feelings of being elated or trapped during a relationship. Burt played this convincingly as a lonely, vulnerable, loveable man who is unprepared for change.
I highly recommend this film as a feel-good romantic comedy.",1140307200,3,766,4.9609375
234589,4,6300213897,"Just coming off producing and writing the classic sitcoms, ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"" and ""Taxi"", James L. Brooks wrote the screenplay, his first, for this 1979 divorce comedy. Even after all these years and finally out on DVD, it remains funny, perceptive and thoroughly engaging in a way that later crystallized into Brooks' filmmaking trademark in ""Terms of Endearment"" and ""As Good As It Gets"". Fortunately, the director is the accomplished Alan J. Pakula, who shows a flair for romantic comedy coaxing excellent performances from the three stars.

The plot centers on Phil Potter, a magazine writer-turned-writing teacher who has been informed by his beautiful but flaky wife Jessica that she wants a divorce. Without much recourse, he seeks solace from his bear-hugging psychiatrist brother Mickey and sister-in-law Marva, who eventually set him up on a blind date with Marilyn, a mild-mannered, rather dowdy nursery schoolteacher. The movie then becomes a clever seesaw of Phil vacillating between his wife and potential new love interest. What remains fresh about the movie is how Pakula and Brooks keep the focus on the flawed characters and less on the predictable cliches about the awkward consequences of divorce.

Even taking into account his comeback turn in Paul Thomas Anderson's 1997 ""Boogie Nights"", I doubt if Burt Reynolds has given a more subtle, genuinely humane performance than he does here. Cast completely against type (he was in his Smokey/Hooper/Sharkey action phase at the time), he makes Phil's uncertainty feel real - even at the risk of losing audience sympathy in the way he treats Marilyn no matter how inadvertently. In the afterglow of her brilliant work in Paul Mazursky's ""An Unmarried Woman"", Jill Clayburgh again demonstrates the malleable quality and fierce intelligence to make her deglamorized Marilyn an attractive and credibly cautious woman. In a revelation before her long, successful run as ""Murphy Brown"", a deadpan Candice Bergen breaks free from her heretofore vacuously decorative roles and supplies the movie's biggest laughs as the narcissistic Jessica, especially when she sings with uproariously tone-deaf panache to seduce Phil in her hotel room.

There is also a terrific supporting cast - Charles Durning bringing out all the unctuous support that Mickey can muster; a scene-stealing Frances Sternhagen as Marva, more than anxious to provide Phil emotional support when he is down and out; Austin Pendleton as a needy member of Phil's divorced men's club, who keeps remarrying his ex-wife; and Mary Kay Place in a funny cameo as Phil's aggressive first post-marital date. Other than Marilyn's unflattering outfits (the orange down jacket is hideous), Marvin Hamlisch's seventies-lite pop music is really the only significant element that dates the movie severely. The divorced men's club meeting scenes are hilarious, and you can see Jay O. Sanders and Wallace Shawn as fellow members. Unlike other romantic comedies of the period full of I'm-OK-You're-OK pop psychology, this one is still well worth viewing. The 2005 DVD has no extras.",1136764800,2,3097,5.316326530612245
234590,5,6300213897,"I wish there were more movies like this one. Three great performances from Bergen, Reynolds and Clayburgh, who show perfect comic timing and real chemistry. The humor comes from real, often poignant situations, and every scene, from the more intimate scenes between Reynolds and Clayburgh to those at the group therapy sessions, are the real thing. The supporting players are also terrific. It's got one of the best endings ever. Listen closely or you might not hear the last line uttered by Clayburgh because the credits are already rolling. It's a beauty.

It's great that they've brought this film out on DVD. Now if someone would just release another great Clayburgh film, An Unmarried Woman, on DVD, I would be first in line to buy it.",1127865600,10,740,4.873015873015873

In other words, no car chases, no good old boys, no explosions, etc., and Burt Reynolds gives an excellent performance as a recently divorced man starting over. The film is both touching and funny, with many exceptional performances. Charles During and Francis Sternhagen are wonderful in supporting roles, and both Candice Bergen and Jill Clayburg were nominated or Academy Awards for their performances. This script is excellent and the film well directed. All in all, a delightful little comedy.",1525651200,,599,5.315789473684211
7805544,4,6300213897,"Candice Bergen displayed her gift for comedy in her performance as an aspiring singer, Jessica Potter, in this mature romantic comedy with Burt Reynolds and Jill Clayburgh. Burt Reynolds played Phil Potter, a Boston publishing executive. Phil and Jessica split up so Phil moves in with his brother, Mickey, and sister-in-law, Marva, (Charles Durning and Frances Sternhagen) in the film. Phil meets Marilyn Holmberg, a wacky, dedicated school teacher who is earning her Master's Degree. Marilyn and Phil hit it off but Phil can't keep his mind off of his ex-wife, Jessica.

Candice Bergen earned an Academy Award nomination in the supporting actress category while her co-star Jill Clayburgh was nominated in the lead category. Burt Reynolds, Bergen and Clayburgh were all nominated for the Golden Globes as well. Burt Reynolds comes across as a mature, thoughtful man in this role unlike other performances. He played a complex man between two very different women. The story was based on a Dan Wakefield novel. The film is a gentle romantic comedy with mature developed characters. Burt Reynolds was at the height of film career at the time. Alan J. Pakula directed a fine film about mature love.

Sadly, there are no special features in this DVD. It would have been nice to have seen a retrospective since Candice Bergen, Burt Reynolds and Jill Clayburgh were huge stars of the late seventies in the movies. Candice would go on to become famous for her comedic wit. Burt Reynolds would go on to do movies. Jill Clayburgh sadly passed away a few years ago. The film was shot mostly in New York City for interiors and on location in Boston for the exteriors.",1522108800,,1658,4.917857142857143
7805545,5,6300213897,"My wife was bemoaning the fact that they don't make good mature romances anymore and she had a point.  Hollywood nowadays seems to be focused on the bottom line which are big-budget fantasy flicks geared toward adolescents of all ages that make beaucoup bucks.  The few alleged romance flicks are Nicholas Sparks yawners, ""Fifty Shades of Grey"", or teenage weepies.  I remembered having seen this film years ago but I was probably too young and inexperienced in the vicissitudes of love to truly appreciate it.  The thing about ""Starting Over"" is it's driven by the main performances and the script.  Director Alan J. Pakula, best known for ""Klute"" and ""All the President's Men"", wisely and unobtrusively allows the actors and the story work their magic.  The script was co-written by James L. Brooks who later came to prominence with ""Terms of Endearment"" and ""As Good As It Gets"" and it is absolutely brilliant.  Yes, people don't really talk like this and a lot of it is wish fulfillment but, hey, it's movie escapism.  This is the essence of reality and the script captures it brilliantly.  The performances here are nothing short of wonderful.  Burt Reynolds', better known for popular vehicles like ""The Longest Yard"" and ""Smokey and the Bandit"", had never been better as Phil, the vulnerable recent divorcee.  Reynolds never demonstrated the gamut of emotions that are on display here certainly not with the cocky good old boy roles that he was associated with.  Reynolds wasn't nominated for an Oscar, some wrongly dismissing his work here as a cynical attempt to gain acceptance with the mainstream critics.  Dustin Hoffman won that year for a lackluster turn in the forgettable ""Kramer vs. Kramer"".  Jill Clayburgh was nominated probably as a consolation prize for being ripped off the year before by not winning for her stellar work in ""An Unmarried Woman"" being bypassed for a ho-hum Jane Fonda in ""Coming Home"".  Clayburgh is quite good as Madeline, a woman devoted to Phil but wary of falling for someone on the rebound.  Candy Bergen was nominated in a supporting role as Phil's neurotic ex-wife.  Some thought Bergen was nominated because they didn't think her at the time being capable of good work which ignores stellar performances previously in films like ""The Sand Pebbles"" and ""Carnal Knowledge"".  Bergen proved quite worthy of the plaudits making human a character who would on paper seem unsympathetic.  This is not forgetting the terrific work offered by Charles Durning and Frances Sternhagen as Phil's brother and sister-in-law.  ""Starting Over"" is an intelligent intuitive work that deserves to be recognized.",1512259200,,2637,5.060185185185185
