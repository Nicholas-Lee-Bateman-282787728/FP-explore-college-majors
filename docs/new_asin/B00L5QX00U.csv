6470722,5,B00L5QX00U,"Okay, I was a fan of The West Wing, so I like political workplace comedies. But it's not just the political satire that's razor sharp on this show. It is just continuously laugh out loud funny. The ""Clovis"" episode got some especially good digs in at the tech sector, but there wasn't a bad episode in the bunch. It's possible that this is the funniest season of the three. I've loved them all.",1428969600,6,394,4.410958904109589
6470723,4,B00L5QX00U,"While it's not as sidesplitting as the previous two seasons, it's still hysterically funny with its excellent use of popular and obscure cultural reference and its scathing political satire, all helmed by the downright brilliant performance turned in by Julia Louis-Dreyfus.
If you haven't checked out Veep yet, and you're not sure if it's for you, try out writer and director Armando Iannucci's very similar feature film, In the Loop. If you love it, you're going to love Veep.",1422316800,6,478,5.063291139240507
6470724,4,B00L5QX00U,"It takes a little time to start enjoying the zany, quirky show, but it becomes entertaining and humorous.",1410912000,3,105,4.888888888888889
6470725,5,B00L5QX00U,"This show is tremendously funny with wonderfully comedic actors offering outrageously
humorous play on American politics with a mixture of quirky, neurotic and ambitious
characters. Julia Louis-Dreyfuss is the queen of sophisticated comedy while also being
able to inject a fun physicality and appealing femininity to the role of the under-achieving
while over-reaching lady VP of the U.S.",1409011200,18,389,5.724137931034483
6470726,3,B00L5QX00U,"Somehow this goes on Digital before a DVD or Blu-Ray date is even announced.

HBO can do this for Veep and yet they cant for Game of Thrones",1406937600,3,140,4.0

6470729,4,B00L5QX00U,Funny - but gyp that they only do a few episodes per season.  Modern Family does 20+ per season.  Oh well.  Funny though,1487635200,,120,4.130434782608695
6470730,5,B00L5QX00U,"Best VEEP Season so far.  Especially the last five (5) episodes.  This Season has schadenfreude and synergy with Campaign and Election 2016.  It delivers a genuine insight into how dysfunctional our governmental and electoral system really is.  It is really a wonder that America has lasted 240 years.  The only thing we need a national government for is our military defense.  Everything else from A to Z can be administered by each individual State.

Great artwork on the slipcover and jewel box for this Season.",1487548800,,514,4.976470588235294

6470732,5,B00L5QX00U,Interesting show about a woman vice-president and her staff.  Humor abounds if you like to see the relationships between people.,1485820800,,128,5.4
6470733,4,B00L5QX00U,"The politics had been in the news a lot. With the campaign seasons and all.  I did not understand it very well, so I had to watch this VEEP cable tv series.  It may have helped clear up some miscomprehensions.  All I can say is I am less idealistic than before. After watching this, I laughed a little and did not worry about being less idealistic than before.",1483142400,,360,4.264705882352941
6470734,1,B00L5QX00U,"Not funny, just one cruel joke after another.  The first year was somewhat funny, but second and third just got worse.",1480464000,,118,4.619047619047619

6470753,5,B00L5QX00U,"If you like satire or politics (or political satire), you will love Veep. Louis-Dreyfus is impeccable, but so are the supporting cast members. The ensemble really makes this show and each character brings something different to the table.",1455580800,2,238,5.2894736842105265

6470772,5,B00L5QX00U,The best comedy on television bar none. Selina Meyer has seen me thru some dark days. Julia Louis-Dreyfuss and Tony Hale should get awards for the bathroom scene alone.  No spoilers I promise. But I cry laughing every time.  Brilliant show!,1444262400,3,240,4.829268292682927

6470795,5,B00L5QX00U,Brilliant show. Using a lot more curse words this season but is still is as face paced as ever and super funny. The Veep's ego makes Donald Trump's look like a piece of popcorn.,1435104000,,177,4.235294117647059

6470811,5,B00L5QX00U,VEEP3 met my very high standards for a laugh fest. I couldn't turn the tv off so watched the two discs over two evenings. Fortunately all the episodes are eminently rewatchable. I would vote for this crew to run the White House any day.,1431216000,,236,4.386363636363637
