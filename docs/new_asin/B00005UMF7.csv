1665920,5,B00005UMF7,the best road picture. songs great comedy even better.  Ann,1479254400,,59,4.9
1665921,5,B00005UMF7,"Hope and Crosby are two childhood fighting pals, first on a raft at sea, then reaching a desert shore. A camel finds them and they ride to Morocco. With no money, Crosby sells Hope into slavery (without the latter's knowledge), only to find him with the local princess, who he now wants for herself. Rivalry and treachery ensue.

Yes, the movie is old, silly escapist entertainment for a worried wartime audience, but still works today thanks to broad if crazy humor and great performances by the leads, who also take jibes at their employers and government censors without overdoing it. Classic songs also make the experience enjoyable.",1478563200,,637,4.953271028037383

You watch a film like this and realize just how much has changed in the movie-making industry since the days of Bing and Bob, but you also realize that a film doesn't have to contain offensive language, nudity, CGI, or a billion dollar budget to be extremely entertaining. Bing and Bob, if you didn't know, made several films in the ""Road To"" series, and while I haven't seen them yet, I will. If you watch this film, I'm sure you'll want to do the same.

It was (incorrectly) prophesized that her first husband would be killed after only a week, so she didn't want to marry anyone she actually liked. She's actually engaged to a sheik-type dude, but she throws him over when she meets Bing. And then all you-know-what breaks lose.

You can tell Bing and Bob had a blast filming Road to Morocco. I would swear that they ad-libbed their lines at times. The movie is entertaining and a good place to escape with a bowl of popcorn. Enjoy!",1376179200,,730,4.53030303030303

1665971,5,B00005UMF7,"1942 and the boys Bing Crosby and Bob Hope continue their comedy films!  Much of the film is unrealistic and at times makes fun of itself but that's what is so charming and silly about this film.  ""Moonlight Becomes You"" is featured.  The film won an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay!

The film starts with a large explosion of a ship.  Then we see several foreign correspondents talking into large microphones in their own language (at least it might be -- Hollywood at this time did not portray foreign languages in appropriate ways -- who would know?).  The Chinese correspondent had a badge on him that said 'I am Chinese', the Russian one had a picture of Stalin in the background, things like that.  Quite silly.

Amazingly no one gets killed in this horrific explosion, caused by Bob smoking in the Powder Room.  Oops.  Just when Bing is considering eating Bob for dinner, they discover land.  Morocco!  Land of Arab shieks, hot bellydancers (but carefully not showing the navels) and marketplaces selling all kinds of stuff.

Most of the film is quite silly.  They note that crazy people get free food because they've been ""touched"" by Allah.  Then Bob acts crazy but unfortunately the first place he goes to the store owner also is nuts.

Once in a while they will make fun of Paramount, or ""I have to remind the audience of what's happening in case they walked into the middle of the picture.""  Or they'll say ""maybe we'll meet Dorothy Lamour!""  Duh, you think??  (All the ""On the Road.."" films featured Dorothy Lamour, so it was a given.

The craziness moves into high gear when Bing sells Bob to a princess.  She found a horoscope that says her first husband will be killed in a week, but her second husband will live with her forever.  Marrying the American means he'll live only a week!  Oops.

Anthony Quinn plays the crazy jealous Arab who is supposed to marry her as the second husband.  The boys get thrown into the desert -- mirages of hamburger joints ensue!

Interesting effect of the three of them lip synching each others' voices!

Best song for me was ""Moonlight Becomes You"" by crooner Bing Crosby.

Example Silly Quotes (from [...])

[Turkey is played by Bob Hope -- Jeff is played by Bing Crosby]
Quotes
Turkey Jackson: A fine thing. First, you sell me for two hundred bucks. Then I'm gonna marry the Princess; then you cut in on me. Then we're carried off by a desert sheik. Now, we're gonna have our heads chopped off.
Jeff Peters: I know all that.
Turkey Jackson: Yeah, but the people who came in the middle of the picture don't.
Jeff Peters: You mean they missed my song?",1309478400,,2612,4.605206073752711
1665972,5,B00005UMF7,"This is undoubtedly the best of the ""Road"" motion pictures starring Bob Hope, Bing Crosby, and Dorothy Lamour.  It has a few somewhat zany moments, and the usual competition between the Hope and Crosby characters.  The two are shipwrecked on the coast of Morocco, and make their way with the help of a princess (Lamour).  Anthony Quinn has a supporting role as the powerful sheik who was supposed to marry the princess.

It is significant that this was released in 1942, just before the invasion of North Africa.  It was probably a favorite film for the troops.",1279497600,,561,4.742268041237113
1665973,2,B00005UMF7,"I saw this movie for the first time tonight and it's the first ""Road"" picture I've seen. I was expecting waaaaay better. Robert Osborn says this is the best of the Road movies. If that's true I needn't bother to see the others. The best thing about this movie is that it has a lot of songs in the first half, but that's balanced out by only one production number with dancing in the entire movie.

I didn't like the movie. Neither Hope nor Crosby came across all that well, their characters weren't very charming, the movie was not funny at all, most of the dialog was just lame filler, there wasn't much action, there wasn't much spectacle.

The movie wasn't what I expected. I was expecting more ""Road,"" but there isn't much. They quickly make it to the palace and then most of the movie takes place there, until the end. I was also expecting a lot more of the famous ""road"" style of breaking the fourth wall, wherein the characters talk directly to the audience or comment on the plot. There was only about 4 instances of that. One of those is an example of the non-funny humor of this script:

<Hope recaps the plot up to now to Crosby>
Crosby: I know all that!
Hope: Yeah but the people that came in half-way through the picture don't.
Crosby: You mean they missed my song?

Those are two weak punchlines, but at least they are actually jokes. Much of the rest of the script doesn't even have any jokes. An example is:

Crosby: Remind me to throw you a piece of cheese in the morning.
(Indirectly calling Hope a rat).

That's not funny at all, it barely even qualifies as a joke, but that's the kind of non-joke dialog that carries most of the movie. Many of the scenes don't even come that close to a joke, just using generic uninteresting dialog like:

Crosby: Hey, whadda ya' take me for? You think that you can just throw me to the dogs?
Hope: Well why not, you did it to me didn't you?
Crosby: Yeah but that's because I was lookin' out for us. You're not lookin' out for nobody.
Hope: Oh yeah? Well then why did I pay the check?

(the above is just from my memory. It's not exact but it illustrates to you what I mean).

And so on....just generic dialog with no jokes at all.

My grade: A waste of time.",1266192000,,2213,4.298076923076923

1665975,5,B00005UMF7,"The ""Road"" series with Bing and Bob were landmarks in realm of funny movies and Road To Morocco is, to me, by far the best of the bunch.  The ""boys"" had really hit their stride in this one and they obviously had a lot of fun filming it.  Lots of good clean laughs, a bunch of inside jokes and some plain old-fashioned fun.",1247270400,,322,4.095238095238095
1665976,4,B00005UMF7,"THIS MOVIE IS DREDFUL.

I mean, those two so-called ""heros"" are dirty almost the whole time. They smoke dope. They steal food. Is that funny? And their idea of ""humor"" is to mock old people, Arabs, women, judges, dead people, geese...even fleas.

I mean, were fleas funny in 1942?

1665977,4,B00005UMF7,"The thing about these Bing and Bob road shows is that if you've seen one, you've seen them all and so it makes sense to just get the best one of the lot to see what you've missed; that one would be ""The Road to Morocco"".  I have to admit that I didn't really like this very much the first time I watched it but surprisingly upon second viewing, I found myself appreciating the jokes a lot more and although not all of them age very well, I was pleasantly surprised when I found out that most of them did!  It was also refreshing to see good acting for a change and the screenplay was deservedly nominated for an Oscar.  Released at the start of World War II, you could see that they were working on a shoestring budget and rationing for scarce resources required for the war effort and so much of the ""special"" effects are pretty lame but I still found myself enjoying this movie overall and I can see myself watching this again and again.  The picture quality is good but not great as at the beginning of the film we get lots of shots with that irritating white spots problem but these seem to reduce in frequency as the movie goes on.  The sound quality is Dolby Digital Mono and so is nothing to shout about and it would have been nice if a 5.1 surround option was made available but as far as mono recordings go, the sound quality was acceptable.  I also liked the bonus features and especially ""Bob Hope and the Road to Success"".

Low budget, low tech but high on entertainment.",1205625600,,1483,4.293906810035843
1665978,5,B00005UMF7,"This old movie is priceless.  It is most likely the best of the ""Road"" shows with Bob Hope and Bing Crosby.

1665980,4,B00005UMF7,"Perhaps offered the breakthrough role for the great Anthony Quinn. Surprising to think this picaresque romp was made in 1942. The picture quality is excellent. If a buddy movie like this were made today it would move a lot faster, contain several nudes, probably a few porn scenes, and every third word would start with F. Also, everything would be dirty. Just before, and during, WWII, everything was clean. The boys were clean, their clothes were clean, the desert was clean, and the girls were sweet and beautiful, and clean. Have we really progressed? Watching this is nostalgic. Many of the lines are witty and funny. We're off on the Road to Morocco is a great song, and memorable. I've always remembered it, anyway. But the whole atmosphere is now a thing of the past.",1161993600,,775,4.7481481481481485
1665981,5,B00005UMF7,"One of the best of the seven ""Road"" movies (this is the third) in the series starring Bing Crosby, Bob Hope, and Dorothy Lamour. It's totally nonsensical - the boys are shipwrecked off Africa and chase after Lamour, who's the princess of Morocco. The jokes fly, some good (many of the best gags are self-deprecating and refer to real-life instances or routines from previous movies), some not, and Crosby sings a few songs (""Moonlight Becomes You"" is probably the best). These movies were a whole mind set, and it helps a lot to buy into the sheer goofiness and fluff of them. Let your mind go free and the picture can be a lot of fun to watch.",1145404800,,644,4.466101694915254
1665982,4,B00005UMF7,"I'm not going to go into why the Hope & Crosby ROAD films were so much fun--enough folks have done that already.

I will say that ROAD TO MOROCCO features one of my favorite bloopers:

It's right at the beginning.  Bing and Bob are stuck in the Sahara desert when a camel takes turns licking their faces.  When they see the camel, they're thrilled at their good fortune, exchanging lines while the wary camel keeps leaning back--

Then--PTOOEY!  The camel spits right in Bob Hope's face.  Unscripted.  Right in the middle of his line.  And Bing laughs out loud.

And they left it in the film!

Priceless!",1115596800,,604,4.5514018691588785
1665983,4,B00005UMF7,"I've never been a big Anthony Quinn fan for some reason, and, for me, his presence in Singapore and here, in Morocco, hampers the fun a bit.

Another fun-to-watch rollicking beginning ... and then the pace slows down when they hook up with Dorothy Lamour ... and make the rounds in the palace.

Both Bing and Bob are in good form.  Bing looks like he dropped a few pounds for the part, and he has a nice little song and dance (""Ho Hum"").  Bob is his usual zany self ... especially when he learns Bing has sold him for $200.  And having Bob act like an idiot so they can get free food (""Such ones are sacred to us"") is a classic bit.

It seems like the farther the movie gets away from Bing and Bob, the duller it gets ... and there's a lull here at about the three-quarter mark.

But a good road picture ... with plenty of laughs.",1106265600,,830,4.118012422360248
1665984,5,B00005UMF7,"This was my first ""Road to"" film, and I can only hope the other three are as funny as this one.  Of course, you can hardly go wrong with the terrific tandem of Bing Crosby and Bob Hope (and Dorothy Lamour certainly doesn't hurt, either).  I have never really thought about Bing Crosby as a comedic actor, but he and Hope have an incredible chemistry that leads to constant hilarity.  They really ham it up, sometimes playing directly to the audience, and Hope's facial expressions never seem to stop.  This is a movie that does not take itself at all seriously; it's a refreshing breath of fresh air blowing through today's climate of over-produced Hollywood extravaganzas.

Jeffrey Peters (Crosby) and Orville ""Turkey"" Jackson (Hope) are a couple of swells who find themselves shipwrecked (thanks to Orville).  Soon they are off (singing) on the Road to Morocco with nothing but food on their minds.  Since they have no money, they are in a bit of a pickle about how to pay for their meal - that's when Peters solves their money problems by selling Orville to an Arab.  After dead Aunt Lucy (yes, it's Hope in drag) appears to him and makes him feel guilty, Jeffrey decides to rescue his friend.  Orville, though, doesn't want rescuing because he is being primped and pampered in the palace of Princess Shalmar (Dorothy Lamour).  The idea of Orville marrying the beautiful princess doesn't set right with Jeffrey, and he starts crooning in her ear himself.  The princess is supposed to marry Mullay Kassim (Anthony Quinn), and he (and his party of gunmen) has something to say about what goes on here.  Naturally, Jeffrey and Orville end up in hot water, but they are surprisingly resourceful (they also obviously sent off for all the nifty gadgets listed on the back of old comic books as kids).  Need I say it?  Hilarity ensues.

Almost every joke and one-liner lands solidly in this film, and a good many of them are laugh-out-loud funny.  You also get the treat of hearing Bing Crosby, the ultimate crooner, sing a few numbers (actually, Hope's singing isn't that bad, either).  In what is probably the most famous scene from the movie, Hope, Crosby, and Lamour sing Moonlight Becomes You in each others' voices - it's a priceless bit.  The Road to Morocco is classic slap-stick comedy at its very best.  Thank goodness we have all these old movies available to us because they certainly don't make 'em like this anymore.",1095033600,,2426,4.747016706443914
1665985,5,B00005UMF7,"This movie is brilliantly quick-witted fun and is thoroughly unpretentious.  It's about as serious as a jelly bean and only a fatuous, pseudo-intellectual would use a review of it as an opportunity to spout post-modernist drivel such as interpreting the audience inclusive familiarity in which the movie undeniably and hilariously indulges as an example of that sorry philosophy.  Then again, though this movie would have to be warped to illustrate the point, there may be some validity to the claim ""postmodernism has its roots in vaudevillian comedy"", because there is no doubt that from its foundation up post-modernism is a joke.  Nonetheless, to those of you who haven't seen this film, please don't let the backhanded compliments of some keep you from enjoying this wonderful movie.  It is what it is - irreverent, joyful goofiness - and it will hopefully outlive the largely bankrupt ideas which have currency among contemporary Western intelligentsia.",1066435200,,959,5.2894736842105265

Crosby and Hope demonstrate that postmodernism has its roots in vaudevillian comedy!  Film has plenty of what postmodernists love to call the self reflexive: mugging at camera, inside jokes, and unabashed self parody.
In other words, if you appreciate the humor of The Simpsons, you will probably laugh a lot during the Road to Morocco.
Silly jokes and gags come often enough that pace never lags, levity never lets up.
Now that the world's roads are easier for the rest of us clowns to travel, the film does reveal America's ignorance and insularity that is hopefully becoming a thing of the past.  But the silly jokes and physical comedy stand the test of time.
Bonus appearance by a rather handsome young Anthony Quinn as desert chieftain / rival for the affections of Dorothy Lamour.",1064448000,,912,4.993421052631579
1665987,5,B00005UMF7,"This movie is really great. Bob, Bing, And Dorothy are, once again, in a strange world. This time it is a world of wealthy sheiks, desert princesses, and men who will buy a guys pal so you can pay for lunch. (The guy being Bing and the pal being Bob). After selling Bob, Bing's conscience gets the better of him, and he sets of in search of his friend. He recieves a note from the missing party telling how he is being horribly tortured. This hardens bob's resolution. Imagine his shock when he finds out the Bob is being treated like a king, and he is going to marry the beautiful Princess(Dorothy Lamour). The rest is history. It's full of chases, inside jokes, ad-libs, and a hilarious song where the boys and a mirage of Dorothy sing 'Moonlight becomes you' in each other's voices. My favorite song was 'Road to Morocco', And the scene where Bob becomes a ""Full-fledged american idiot"" Is priceless. A teriffic movie.",1053302400,,921,4.554216867469879

If you look at his history, the ""disgruntled Dominican"" gave ""Chopper Chicks in Zombie Town"" five stars. I think that's all you need to know. This is a light, funny entertaining film that holds up well unless you're a disgruntled Dominican buckethead.",1052784000,,340,4.590163934426229

1665990,5,B00005UMF7,"The classic 1942 comedy ""Road to Moroco"", the 3rd in the ""Road"" series, starring Bing Crosby, Bob Hope and Dorothy Lamour.  This is my favourite- great songs and zany comedy.  Decades before Monty Python, the top-of-their-tree talents combined here created an outrageously original and sensationally surreal comedy! Crosby and Hope were two of the biggest box-office draws at the time, and they enjoy themselves immensely in ""Morocco"", with in-jokes aplenty (they even make fun of the Road series itself!) and double-and-triple crosses in abundance, as they try to get themselves out of trouble and into romance, Bing the smooth, crooning charmer and Bob the cowardly (but loveable) wanna-be.  Dottie is beautiful as ever, as are the sets and the support cast includes a menacing Anthony Quinn.  The Johnny Burke-Jimmy Van Huesen score includes ""Road to Morocco"" (Bob and Bing on a camel- ""Where we're goin', why we're goin', how can we be sure?  I'll lay you eight-to-five that we meet Dorothy Lamour!""); ""Ho Hum"" and ""Moonlight Becomes You"" (a classic Bing number, which he solos and reprises with Hope and Lamour).  They don't make `em like this anymore!",1015632000,,1157,5.127659574468085
1665991,5,B00005UMF7,"A top moneymaker in 1943, with an Oscar-nominated  screenplay, ROAD TO MOROCCO is perhaps the most satisfying of the series in which the public loved from 1940-1962.  Here, Hope and Crosby often step out of character to comment on the fictional situation and the processes of film communication.  Hope and Crosby sing to the camera, and the lyrics include ""I'll lay you eight to five we meet Dorothy Lamour"" and ""For any villians we may meet we haven't any fears - Paramount will protect us 'cause we're signed for five more years"".  Other illusion-breaking instances are those which refer to the earlier ""Road"" films.  At one point, Hope and Crosby attempt the ""pattycake"" routine they had used in ROAD TO SINGAPORE and ROAD TO ZANZIBAR to get the best of their adversaries; but when it fails to work in this case, Crosby comments ""Yessir Junior, that thing sure got around""  After they escape from Kassim and are onboard a ship bound for America, Lamour remarks to Crosby, ""I get the strangest feeling we've been through all this before""  to which Crosby replies ""I trapped you again.""  The film lapses into total artificiality at the end, when they are stranded on a life raft.  Here, Hope goes into an overdramatic ""mad"" scene and when Crosby informs him that the New York skyline is in the background, Hope remarks, ""You had to open your big mouth and ruin the only good scene I have in the picture"".  ""I might have won an Academy Award"".  The subsequent ROAD pictures were even more blantantly artificial.  Only in ROAD TO UTOPIA did Hope winover Lamour.  In general, Hope's contributions to film comedy have too long been disregarded.  As a stand-up comedian, he is a show business institution, and his timing and delivery have often been acknowledged as an influence on other such performers - most notably  Johnny Carson.  Crosby's presence provides an added dimension to the series.  His casual underplaying is the perfect counerpoint to Hope's rapid fire gag lines.  The bantering between the two obviously owed much to their long personal friendship; it always seems spontaneous and unrehearsed.",1003968000,,2107,4.903954802259887

1665993,5,B00005UMF7,"This is Bing and Bob's finest and funniest road picture by a wide margin. Their interplay and chemistry together is shown to its best advantage here. Bing's two songs, ""Moonlight Becomes You"" and ""Just Found a  Hole in My Shoe"" are catchy and wonderfully sung. Bob Hope is, as  always, absolutely hilarious. His comedic timing is seriously under-rated.  It's no wonder Woody Allen thinks he's the greatest movie comedian in  history.
There are a number of inside jokes in this movie, and younger  viewers will not understand the references to Bob's Pepsodent radio show,  Bing's lousy horses and the Kraft Music Hall. But it's fast-paced,  genuinely funny and a blast from first to last.",962496000,,687,4.973684210526316

They have many more  great songs in this movie  like..... ""moonlight becomes you""A hole in my shoe"" and my  personal favorite ""Were of on the Road to Morocco""I think  the  best scene is when Bing and Bob are in the desert, and they see a Dorthy  Lamour mirage, and all three of them sing ""moonlight becomes you""  and they all exchange vocies. It is a utterly slap-happy picture. I advise  anyone who like Bing and Bob to buy this movie!  not to rent because you  can't ever see it enough!",961027200,,661,4.0859375
