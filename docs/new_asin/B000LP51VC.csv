8284759,5,B000LP51VC,Highly recommend this video for any practitioner of Xingyiquan.  Traditional 5 Elements applications/form (Xiang Ke Quan) demonstrated in great detail.,1414281600,,151,6.55
8284760,3,B000LP51VC,"Never seen anyone do this form in America, but have read about it and was looking forward to seeing it.  Nice that they broke it down step by step slowly. Presents 2-person choreographed Xing Yi (Hsing I) set that helps bridge the gap in training between doing solo forms in the air and unrehearsed fighting.  The English subtitles are a little hard to understand-- without a solid grasp of Xing Yi basics or speaking Chinese fluently, viewers may miss a lot of the subtleties that make this more than just a 2-person dance.",1336262400,,524,4.623655913978495
