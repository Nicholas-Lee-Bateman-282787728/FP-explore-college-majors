8097786,5,B000CCZR9U,"This is one of the best series on World War II Pacific.  There are other series about the Pacific War and in
my opinion this one is at the top of the list.",1388102400,,155,3.696969696969697
8097787,5,B000CCZR9U,"This is a fantastic set if you want to learn about the war in the Pacific, which tends to be overlooked in many of the comprehensive sets that cover both campaigns ETO/PTO. It takes you from the root causes and the Japanese political situation and it's Manchurian campaign...right through to occupation of Japan and the Korean war. It covers many areas that are neglected in most WWII documentaries. The chapter on the New Guinea campaign was footage I've never seen and have been watching WWII documentaries for 35 years. Coverage of the Aleutians and the China Burma India theater was also rare. The one fact that Both my father(WWII VET, Bouganville)and I appreciated that chapter for the fact it covers the entire Solomons Campaign where most documentaries lead you to believe Guadalcanal was the only battle if the Solomons!

A Suggestion if you want this series that covers the Pacific AND the series that covers the War in Europe...Do a search for Great WWII Campaigns, when I bought that set it was $2.00 less than the Pacific by itself.

A WARNING- This set is sold under MANY different names (I actually unknowingly bought it twice).The names I've seen it as (and I'm sure theres more)War in the Pacific-The Crusade; Crusade in the Pacific; Crusade in the Pacific:A War that Shook the World; Great Battles of the Pacific; War Classics: Crusades in the Pacific; Great WWII Campaigns (covers both PTO and ETO); Campaigns of the Pacific....I'm sure there's more but if you cant find chapter listings to compare (I used Google to find most)...you can tell by the run time...ususally 570-600 minutes",1276041600,11,1604,4.915129151291513

8097789,4,B000CCZR9U,"My 84 year father, a WWII vet of the Pacific Theater, was mesmerized by these episodes.  The Pacific is a neglected aspect of WWII history in comparison to the European Theater of Operation so I was glad I came across this.  ""Crusade in the Pacific"" is thorough and knowledgeable.",1239062400,4,280,4.6938775510204085
