953904,5,6305042772,"My 2 year old loved this video! Refreshing because of its lack of dialogue, it allows children to think for themselves. Missing too, are the usual awful songs and cacophony of noise infused into childrens videos these days. You won't regret this purchase.",1019865600,12,255,4.953488372093023
953905,5,6305042772,"I don't think these reviews really give the impression of how simply beautiful this film is. In 1998 when the film premiered on Channel 4 I was fourteen - there is no age barrier for The Bear. The visual imagery is in a class of its own, and Howard Blake's score must surely rate as one of the most heartfelt and beautiful of the last decade.
It's really hard for me to convey my enthusiasm for this picture - suffice it so say that, in my opinion, it surpasses The Snowman.
Do buy this film. Whether you're eight or eighty it will enchant. I'm off to watch it again.

953906,5,6305042772,"This short, animated film is about a girl who befriends a polar bear, and how they find a way for him to return to the North Pole during a magical night's romp with Ursa Major.  Each character is portrayed by a song, as  well as through the wordless story.  The girl is voiced by Charlotte  Church.  If you enjoyed ""The Snowman,"" you will enjoy this.",942192000,,350,4.323076923076923
954146,5,6305042772,"I like the way these stories are animated.  Not digitalized, but a more simple drawing style.  My 3 year old really likes The Animal Train and will request it often.  I think he likes the drama of it more than actually getting the message of conservation, which will come when he is older.  Personally I like The Bear better... because it is both silly and sweet.",1322611200,,363,4.454545454545454
954147,5,6305042772,"I ordered this video for my granddaughter who is 2 1/2 yrs. old.  I had previously gotten her Raymond Briggs' ""The Snowman"" which she plays over and over.  She loves this one equally well because the story line is very easy for that age level to follow.  I would highly recommend either one of these.",1268956800,,300,4.418181818181818
954148,4,6305042772,"We had borrowed an old VHS version of this movie from the library that my daughter (2 years old) absolutely loved - it was a version just like the Snowman movie that she loves, that only has music and no speaking.  She will sit and watch these all the way through, they are her favorite movies.  I assumed this Polar Bear movie was like the copy we had gotten from the library, but was surprised to find that it was narrated by Judy Dench.  While I don't mind the narration or the story, my daughter seems less interested in the film now.",1266364800,,538,4.254901960784314
954149,2,6305042772,"When we first watched this as VHS with my daughter (several years ago) it was wonderful! The images and music combined to tell the story and also let her figure out what was happening on her own, using her imagination. In this version, the narration tells the story for you, so kids don't have to think, but not only that - it ruins the soundtrack and is very distracting.  At some points it's hard to hear, so it sounds like someone talking just loudly enough to be disturbing. The vocals, so lovely during the skating scene, are now shortened and relegated to the background, barely audible, and the narration continues as someone talking over the music. I wish it had been left alone with just the images and the music as it was first made.  It was much better then.  If I could return this one, I would. Very disappointing!",1239667200,4,827,4.5
954150,5,6305042772,"Raymond Briggs' ""The Bear,"" originally released in 1999, is a delightful holiday spectacle that is unfortunately often overshadowed by the popularity of the previous Briggs' masterpiece, ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Snowman/dp/B000HIVIOW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Snowman</a>"" (1982).  It is true that there are many similarities between the two films; both take small children into the adventure of a lifetime in a magical winter wonderland, neither one relies on dialogue but instead on a lovely musical score, as well as a beautiful original song.  Still, this is no reason to put ""The Bear"" aside because, as much as I loved ""The Snowman"" and as much as I believe that it is nothing short of a masterpiece, I somehow find parts of ""The Bear"" to be stronger in some ways.

Shortly before Christmas, a girl named Tilly drops her beloved Teddy Bear into the polar bear exhibit during a visit to the city zoo.  That very night, Tilly practically cries herself to sleep as she misses her friend, and no other can replace him.  Later that night, an enormous polar bear appears inside her very bedroom.  The two become fast friends, but keeping such a large creature hidden from her two parents proves difficult.  Tilly bathes the bear and offers him some food, in return, the polar bear carries her away into the streets of her own city, which are now empty and turned into a magical wonderland.  Together, Tilly and the bear wander the streets, witnessing magical displays of lights and dancing and sliding on the ice at the park.  The two are then joined by the enchanting apparition of the Ursa Major.  When danger comes near, the polar bear is there to save Tilly, until the two must part; the bear leaves on a voyage to return to his home, at the North Pole.  The Ursa Major is there to take Tilly home, who holds on to a small star shining bright in memory of her adventure.

""The Bear"" is simply a delight.  I personally found the visit to the lonely city streets during a cold winter night more magical than the snowman's visit to the North Pole in the 1982 film.  The animation in ""The Bear"" is also as magnificent as that in ""The Snowman,"" with its soft and warm storybook-like drawings and vivid colors.  The story is very touching, and the ending manages to feel both happy and sad, once again, just like in the 1982 film.  I found the musical score to be wonderful and very nicely combined with the action and animation.  The song, ""Somewhere A Star Shines For Everyone,"" beautifully sung through ""la-las"" during the ice dancing scene, is bound to kindle a Christmas heart and give it that magical holiday feeling, at least that's what it did for me.  I should also point out the direct reference made to ""The Snowman,"" as Tilly and her family sit to watch that particular film on TV, and viewers of ""The Bear"" are rewarded with a small bit of its lovely theme music.

So in conclusion, ""The Bear"" is definitely worthy of a full-score rating, because I believe it is all it could have been, if not more.  It is definitely a holiday treasure I'll cherish as much as ""The Snowman,"" and a number of other holiday classics.  After several viewings, I've never been disappointed and have not found any flaws with it, so I'll just say that ""The Bear"" is definitely one to add to the Christmas film collection.  Highly recommended!",1226966400,2,3386,4.801724137931035
954151,1,6305042772,"The original cut of this video was breathtaking, and a magical part of my children's early childhood.  We lost the original in a move, and were so happy to find it again in DVD format.  Well.  Somewhere over time, it was decided to add a narration that utterly ruins it.  Now we have Dame Judi Dench in a voiceover that made my daughter groan, ""it's like adding a sports announcer to a beautiful ballet"".  The music and animation told the story in a simple and artful way that is now ruined for us.  What a shame.",1200614400,9,513,4.291666666666667

954154,5,6305042772,"This is a wonderful short animated film, perfectly enjoyable for a six year old girl and her old Dad. Mom likes it too. The story is cute, clever, funny, poignant and magical.  I think its wordlessness allows a subtle complexity not seen (or noticed, anyway) in most videos directed at kids.  (I have not seen The Snowman:  is that the show Tilly and her family are watching when the bear sneaks into the room?.)  I find the soundtrack, by Howard Blake, to be quite fine as a tone poem, independent of the visuals -- try turning off the picture, and hear for yourself.  This score belongs on the programs of pops concerts everywhere;  bass and tuba players  might like the exposure.  It is the music, really, that makes it all so magical; it carries the story much higher than the book itself was able to go. In fact, this is the only case I know in which the movie is better than the book.  That's the most rare praise I can give it.",1106956800,2,934,4.3526011560693645
954155,4,6305042772,"My children 4 and 5/1/2 loved the Raymond Briggs' movie ""The Snowman"" so much that I bought this one without viewing it first. Although the story is sweet, the music is not as good. I always turn down the ""singing"" when the bear constilation (Ursa Major) appears. Instead of being beautiful and adding to the story, to us it just sounds grating. The part I love the best is when the girl and family watch ""the Snowman"" on T.V. it shows to me how much better that sound track was. Still, a good movie, and one we watch often.",1096934400,,524,4.303030303030303
