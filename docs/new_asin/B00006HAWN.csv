1756343,1,B00006HAWN,"This movie was terrible.  Not even worth one star, if you ask me.  I only went to see it because I'm utterly obsessed with Noah Wyle (who's only in a few scenes, SO DISSAPOINTING!).
Here's the deal though....this movie has an ok premise.  There are points in the movie where I was like, ""gee, this could be a good movie.""  The thing is, they take every last LITTLE plot point and they serve it to you like a smack over the head with a 2 x 4.  Nothing at ALL is left to suspense or to the imagination.
I read in the Chicago Sun Times that this movie completely parallel's Julia Robert's 'Sleeping with the Enemy' and that all the details are like completely the same.  Maybe SWTE is a better movie...
For what it's worth though, save your money and DON'T see this movie unless you like really tacky, cliche, all-too-long movies.",1022371200,11,827,4.372549019607843

1756345,5,B00006HAWN,"Jennifer Lopez's latest movie ENOUGH is a must see movie. She plays the role of Slim, a woman who meets Mr. Wonderful and everything in her life seems to be perfect. Then she finds out her husband is having an affair with another woman, and she takes a stand. She won't put up with it. The relationship becomes abusive and violent, so with the help of her friends, she escapes with her daughter. As they find different places to live, she realizes she can't keep running because he always has a way of finding her. In the end she decides to take action and protect herself, becoming the aggressor. ENOUGH has a talented cast including Jennifer Lopez, Juliette Lewis, Noah Wylie and more. Overall they all turn in commanding performances, this movie will leave you on the edge of your seat wondering what happens next. This is a must see movie, go out and see it!",1022284800,3,862,4.532051282051282
1756346,1,B00006HAWN,"Slim thought she had it all, a loving spouse, a beautiful daughter and a wonderful home, that is until she discovers her husband's true nature.  A determined and ruthless man, Mitch believes that since he provides for the family, he alone makes the rules around the house, and Slim should just play the role of an obedient wife.  When the relationship becomes abusive and violent, she finally chose to leave him.  Taking little Gracie with her, Slim quickly found herself in a cat and mouse game as Mitch pursued her relentlessly everywhere she went.  Tired of running and being afraid for her safety constantly, she decided to fight back and be the aggressor this time.
Well, against my better judgement I went to watch Enough anyway, and after sitting through 2 hours of hackneyed and preposterous story, I can safely say that this is one of the worst movies of 2002.  The script was poorly written, the characters were flat and undeveloped, the acting was horrid and the dialogues were terrible.  The scary thing is that Enough actually featured a talented cast, with Juliette Lewis, Noah Wyle and yes, even Jennifer Lopez, yet none of them were watchable, the performances were uninspiring and boring.
Let's face it, domestic thrillers have been done numerous times before, unfortunately Enough didn't do anything new to set itself apart from the others in the same genre.  The direction was uneven, and the pacing was jerky, all of the obligatory gimmicks in a suspence movie were there.  ...",1021248000,45,1497,4.8893280632411065

1756394,5,B00006HAWN,"INTRO:
For any of those B-movies that show a woman overpowering a physically healthy prime man through normal methods, NO! YOU CANNOT EXPECT THAT TO HAPPEN! To sum it up, I just watched a movie where it was great; UNTIL, they decided for some reason to allow a barefooted woman to kick a man with her forefoot(NOT THE BALL OF THE FOOT) and do another kick move in close quarters against a man to end the fight where she could not possibly get the power for it! Then, she defeats her self defense trainer without any extra training besides that that he gives her! ""Enough"" is not like that at all!

REALISM IN THE ENOUGH MOVIE:
1. Slim(Lopez) had self-defense training, rings on her hands, and steel toe boots. Some 7th grade bullies could do major damage to an prime male adult with those things to maximize the impact of their blows without self defense training!

2. Then, Mitch(Slim's Husband) was rich and had connections to wazoo! But, he was a ""politician"" in comparison! She used this as well as her aforementioned skill and her intelligence to defeat him.

3. Still, Slim's a pacifist despite all of the bad that has happened to her, but--when it comes to Gracie(her daughter) and when she cannot fight through any other means(she tries everything passive that she possibly can)--she transmuted from scared animal into just wild enough to get the job done! SO, SHE HAS MOTIVE SPARKS HER INTO ACTION, TOO!

Add those 3 things together, it all makes perfect sense!

PROBLEMS: 1. Her BIRTH dad had almost as many connections or more than Mitch. When you watch a movie like this, you want a realistic ""Rocky"" story(someone moving from bottom or lowly to triumph) and this fact(convenience) takes away from that. Most poor children don't have a long lost rich father, so, like I said, it is a lightning strike of convenience for him to be in the story. She did have 2 rich people to steal from(Mitch or his mom) to get money so that they could eliminate her dad taking away from this story. 2. There is a pretty good lull in the action about 2/3 of the way in.",1517270400,,2063,4.564864864864865

1756396,1,B00006HAWN,"Although the topic is one that should be talked about more (abusive relationships) this is just a bad movie.  The acting was horrible, except for the child, the plot needed a lot of work, characters developed more and the ending less predictable.  This was more about her trying to prove that she is better than her husband and not about what women actually go through in abusive relationships.",1515888000,,394,4.779411764705882

1756401,5,B00006HAWN,"I think this is a very good film. The script and storyline are excellent and believable. I almost always like films when the underdog wins against all the odds. Jennifer Lopez is perfect in this role. I think she's a very good, underrated actor - I've liked her in every film I've seen her in (especially Selena). In this film, she portrays a woman who is physically and emotionally abused by her husband, an all too often tragic situation that women find themselves in. In this case, she is desperately trying to protect her daughter first and herself second. All the supporting cast members are very good as well. I especially like Tessa Allen who plays Jennifer's young daughter. This was Tessa's first film and she's now twenty-one years old; still doing commercials and acting. Kudos!

I've seen this movie many times on TV and I finally ordered it today for my DVD collection.

The filmmakers decided to use Aimee Mann's song ""Today's the Day"" in the film. I bought the song as an mp3 a couple of years ago. The song is modified for the film but the modification is appropriate for the film. The song is not on the soundtrack. It's from Aimee Mann's ""Lost in Space"" album.",1512604800,,1178,4.604761904761904

1756439,5,B00006HAWN,"Jennifer Lopez is great in this film. She acts very well and the plot is very good. As a lawyer handling divorce cases, I heard many tales like this one. In the movie, Lopez is a waitress who is picked up by a man who appears to have saved her from a predator. The two marry and have a daughter, and life seems ideal until Lopez discovers that her husband has a girlfriend. When she confronts him with what she discovers, he becomes vicious, hits her, and tells her he will continue to see and have ex with other woman and she should accept it. He says he will not let her go, she must remain his wife. When she tries to leave, he becomes even more vicious.
The husband has connections with police and gangsters. Thus, when she does find a way to leave, he has her pursued and makes her life miserable. He insists that she return to him. She changes her name and the name of her daughter and moves from place to place, but he is always able to find her.
Finally, she has had enough. And what she does is very interesting.",1502841600,2,1021,4.187817258883249

1756442,5,B00006HAWN,"Just a tad unrealistic but I really think every woman should watch this to learn self defense and that it is NEVER okay for anyone to hurt you or your child(ren).

1756446,4,B00006HAWN,This is a very good movie.  The way she handles things though in the end I do not think that was good though.

1756547,5,B00006HAWN,"It's been 26 years now, since I escaped from my husband at the time, with our little boy, who was only about 2 years old and proud to say he is now an attorney :)

There were several red flags after 8 months but I was young and green, innocent christian at the time, not exposed to drugs and lies. We were married one year later after we met. We found out the morning of our wedding day, we were pregnant. It was such a happy day with family and friends.

The first week we had our son, it started. The same question asked of me, about each week to each month...""If there was a fire, who would you get out first if there was a fire, me or the baby?"" I would say I would try to get you both out but the baby first. He would respond with the same way response ""Why, we can have another baby but you can't have another me!""

Eventually his drug use became known. I even paid for 3 months of rehab. But around this time started his physical abuse. Each time I would call the police. Each time the police would tell me this statistic ""By the 7 time a woman is hit she will be dead."" See I was never even hit as a child. It was shocking to witness his behavior.

After the relocation to move away from our home area for his sake and to be near his family, on the way of the move, he chose to be back on drugs. I was encourage to do counseling when I learned about speaking up for myself more. When I question him about us staying together he threaten me again with the same statement ""Don't ever think you can leave me with our son"" so I finally had the nerve to stick up for myself and say. ""No judge would not let me have our child""  Well ... I had the worse beating from a man 6'2 220 pounds, which was the 6 beating. He picked me up and threw me from the hallway into the living room. Our son ran over to me, crying over me, when his father pushed our son away into a wall to hit me. That's when I should have picked up our son and ran out.

But no I came up swinging. Eventually we were all in the bedroom and as he was about throw another punch at me, I picked up my drinking glass next to the bed to block his hit. His fist hit the glass and landed still into my jaw with our son crying and witnessing this. The blood from hand/wrist went everywhere.

I called his parents who live down the street and 911. During this period he grab our baby and left with him. He ended up needing surgery. The police came but this time the threaten to arrest me because he was injured. I guess my jaw and bruises were not visible enough yet.

For 30 days this man kept our baby with him and with his parents so I couldn't leave with him. For the sake our son we gave this toxic relationship another try. But after just weeks, he decided to stay out all night with my car with another woman. That was it for me. But it wasn't over. I went to his work early the next morning to exchange cars but he found out. I raced home with our son to pack up and go away for a while back home we moved from for 6 months, where my son was born and I had lived for nearly 20 years. We lived in apartments. We had a neighbor who did child care but I never had spoken to her. I took our son to her and asked to hold on to our son and if I didn't come back in 90 minutes to call the police.

I raced to our apartment gathered the things I had gotten ready during the night. Just as I finished up,  he comes and confronts me outside in the apartments. A neighbor came out with long extension line of her phone calling 911 but he snatched the phone away from her. He ordered me inside our apartment many times threatening if I didn't. I didn't listen. The woman ran inside her home for safely and I ran into my car. He chased after me. But out drove him and lost him.

I quickly came back when I was sure he wasn't following me any longer and retrieved our son. I know for a fact if I had gone back into the apartment that day with him, I wouldn't be typing this right now. I also know if we had a gun in our house, I would have shot him when he hurt our son and I wouldn't have been able to be with my son.

When OJ Simpson case happen, it so resonated with me. So many similarities. But she didn't make it.

It cost me financially dearly this divorce. But lived to create a better life. No one should live with threats or physical abuse. It was difficult to get away from this man. Eventually my teenage son wanted to have his father in his life again. So I allowed it. My son was used and con as well. My son finally came to know who his father truly was. His father did attack him twice and finally he was arrested for assault. My son has no relationship with his father due to this. Nor does his son. So sad. What a loss.

This movie was therapeutic to witness. How brave she was to go back and face him. There is no way that could have happen for me.  Over the years I have watched many movies about abusive men hurting women and in the end the women freeing themselves from their attackers. It is empowering. Over the years for me, the fear left me and I became stronger not fearing him any longer. We live in the same city now. He is crippled from so many back surguries and lives in the misery of his own mind, in prisoned.",1475193600,9,5197,3.969319271332694

1756583,4,B00006HAWN,"Billy Campbell's performance in this film is frighteningly accurate.  I really don't like the interviews he gave after making this film- he seems really stupid and ignorant of the repulsive misogyny extant in the world, and in his role, oddly, while he is actually portraying it.  Perhaps he likes his wife-beater character.  In interviews he certainly seems to.  He mentions nothing of the hortors of misogyny and child abuse and He states in one interview"" it was a really fun role"" what a psycho! Who does that?

I am the child of a  child abuser.  I don't know which is more disturbing to me, the fact that Campbell is so realistic in the role or the fact he has done NOTHING for domestic violence and child abuse after playing the role.

Child abuse represents a  major problem all over the world as well as violence by men towards little girls.

Why hasn't he bothered to do anything  for awareness to tell people ""my character is a very dangerous man based on the reality of misogynist wife beaters and child abusers in real life. "" Instead he states""it was a lot of fun playing the villain"".
 It IS his DUTY to do something as someone perpetuating this horror in film.  I won't be watching him in anything else -not that he's in anything interesting;) .

Now imagine someone picking up those strips of paper and gluing them onto a sheet of paper. Now imagine lots of sheets of paper all together and someone dim witted enough to think this was a script.

Now add in people who can't act, a stock ""cute child"" from central casting, unimaginative direction and... you either have a really funny parody or, in this case, a tedious waste of celluloid that takes far too long to come to the inevitably clichd ending with the inevitably clichd credits song.

1756952,4,B00006HAWN,"""Enough"" (2002) is a drama/thriller starring Jennifer Lopez as Slim, a woman who is beat up by her husband, Mitch (Billy Campbell), when she catches wind of his infidelities. She then tries to flee from his egomaniacal clutches with her daughter and no help from the law. Will she prevail? Juliette Lewis has a peripheral role.

This is a solid drama/thriller that explores the topic of spousal abuse. It's not great, but it's certainly entertaining for what it is. Lopez confidently carries the film while Campbell is very effective as the pompous bastage. The final act takes a ""movie"" turn, like 1998's ""A Simple Plan,"" which I generally don't like, but here it's actually satisfying, so why complain?

Roger Ebert lambasted the film for numerous reasons. I think Ebert's one of the greatest movie reviewers ever, but I can't fully agree with his assessment of ""Enough."" Roger calls it ""tacky"" simply because it shares plot similarities with the infamous ""I Spit On Your Grave"" (1978) in that a woman is brutalized and she ultimately turns the tables. Exactly WHY does he consider this tacky material? It's a great plot for a movie because so many women have been taken advantage of by arrogant men around the world throughout history and it's nice to see the abused woman go on the offensive.

Ebert complains that Mitch is ""an unlikely caricature of hard-breathing sadistic testosterone that he cannot possibly be a real human being."" Really? I've met these kinds of guys. One held a gun to my sister's head and, on another occasion, blew up her car! Roger criticizes that ""he has no existence beyond the stereotyped Evil Rich White Male."" But the very reason stereotypes exist is because there's SOME truth to them. Ebert also complains that Mitch's change is too sudden and unexpected for both the viewer and Slim because it doesn't happen till 3-4 years into the marriage, but this presumes that a movie is obligated to share every detail of its characters with the audience. The answers are in between the lines: Sometime after the honeymoon phase wore-off Mitch acquires a mistress because he arrogantly feels he deserves one and f*** what his wife thinks. Besides, he's the bread-winner, he thinks, what say does she have? Up to this point Slim was obviously blinded by love and when she discovers the awful truth she's in shock.

Roger also denounces the film for sometimes being melodramatic and over-the-top. Like ""Fatal Attraction"" wasn't? Even the aforementioned ""A Simple Plan,"" which Ebert praised, has it's utterly contrived ""yeah, right"" moments.

While Ebert's objection to the movie's simplistic moral color-coding (evil white guy contrasted by the good black trainer and lawyer) is somewhat legitimate, it isn't entirely. After all, apart from Mitch and his hired heavies, all the white dudes in the film are respectable citizens. Roger laments that we won't see a movie where the evil husband is black and the self-defense instructor is white in our lifetimes. While this may be technically true, what about 2001's ""Training Day"" where the ultra-corrupt cop is black (Denzel Washington) and the noble rookie is white (Ethan Hawke)?  What about the righteous white instructor in 2006's ""Peaceful Warrior""? These are just two examples off the top of my head.

Lastly, Roger refers to ""Enough"" as a ""cartoon of a movie."" While it's true that ""Enough"" contains SOME over-the-top elements it has the same general tone as ""A Simple Plan,"" not that it's as good. If you want to see a true ""cartoon of a movie,"" see 2005's ""King Kong,"" which took the classic adventure movie and morphed it into a veritable Road Runner cartoon. Ebert gave ""King Kong"" an unbelievable perfect rating. You might argue that ""King Kong"" is an adventure movie with a colossal gorilla, but it was also a drama/thriller that takes place in the ""real"" world, a world not far removed from the one presented in ""Enough.""

Disregarding profits, the main purpose of a movie is to entertain; the secondary purpose is to convey a message, overtly or covertly. While not great or deep, ""Enough"" delivers the goods on both counts. Ebert missed this in his review.

The film runs 115 minutes and was shot in California and Washington (state).

1756953,5,B00006HAWN,"Spoiler Alert: Please make no mistake; THIS FIVE STARS IS ENTIRELY FOR JENNIFER LOPEZ'S AMAZING ACTING!  The script is implausible to a fault; and at the end after the fight of the century Jennifer Lopez winds up without a scratch.  The entire film is filled with unrealistic situations even though the premise of being married to a macho bastard is based in realism.  The choices afterward basically aren't and while it worked beautifully in reality it's a bit of stretch that you are going to be alone with your ex husband and prepared to kick his ass.  I don't know; it could happen sure but how often?  The choices Jennifer's character made were to put it mildly risky.  Everything went according to plan which is perfect but in real life, well, the best laid plans can fail and often do.  The film was never boring and Jennifer was both credible and beautiful.  Watch it if you aren't expecting a whole lot but if like me you love Jennifer Lopez it's worth it definitely and she really proves how wonderfully she can perform as a believable actress.

1757024,1,B00006HAWN,"I'm going to be brief because there aren't enough adjectives in the English language to explain how awful this movie is. So I'll just stick with the facts and leave it at that.

This movie is supposed to be about domestic abuse. I thought at first I'd selected the wrong title on Netflix, because despite the plot summary and thriller-esque video cover, this film opened up with all kinds of frills and silliness. The scripty font and lighthearted music in the beginning actually made me think this was a romantic comedy. Then I couldn't decide if it was comedy or some kind of thriller parody flick, because Juliette Lewis is saying to Jennifer Lopez, arguably one of the most beautiful women alive, that she's so plainly she'll never get a date. And Lopez looks put out and mopes around because she seems to take her friend's words to heart and believe they're true. Then some customer at the restaurant she's working at starts hitting on her, only to soon reveal it was all a game to see how fast he could get her in bed, because she's so homely she will sleep with anyone and he thought he could win an easy bet.

I'm sorry... Jennifer Lopez, playing a ""plain Jane"" with no hope for any man really wanting her? They didn't even try to make her look anything other than stunning and glamorous; from the get-go she's got highlights in that gorgeous honey-blond hair, and her makeup is perfection. If that doesn't warn you what a farce this flick is going to turn out to be, there's nothing else I can say that will dissuade you from getting your hopes up. It might have worked if they chose an actress who A.) can act and B.) isn't drop-dead gorgeous, but...well, that was their choice and it just didn't play out the way it was supposedly meant to. Unless this was a parody film. I am really still not even sure.",1424131200,,1815,4.480362537764351

1757142,3,B00006HAWN,"The movie Enough came out in 2002 and I remembered it as being decent but reviewing it the second time I wonder what I saw in it the first time. This was a bad movie. Not because of the acting or filmography but it takes a very serious subject and provides false information that people will absorb.

Jennifer Lopez's character Slim meets and falls in love with a conniving, two timing, lying abuser. He is a strong willed, charismatic personality that is used to getting his way. The abuse starts when Slim finds out about an affair that he is having and confronts him. He slaps her and when she says You can't hit me, he hits her. She makes plans to leave, and he catches her and beats her worse. Eventually with the help of her friends she makes it out of the house. From there, it is a stalker plot line where he finds out where she is and she's desperate and doesn't know what to. She ends up going to a long lost father who is a powerful something or other and gives her money and a trainer.  Then there is a 10 minute montage of her training in what looks like Krav Maga in anticipation of an upcoming family court cases.
We learn during the movie the husband has a friend in the police department who is running addresses and credit card monitoring to help him keep track of her. A lawyer advisers her the family court case is simply a ruse to get her to show herself publicly and from there will try to tail and track her.
She trains for about a month and decides to kill her husband by setting him up. She breaks into his house by picking the locks, sets up a cell phone blocker, puts on rings as brass knuckles, hides his guns, plants fake letters and is ready to go.
So the husband comes home, there is some back and forth banter and the fight is on. She hits him and kicks him and knocks him out using her superior fighting skills but doesn't have the will to actually kill him. The fight continues and she ends up kicking him over a balcony where he falls to his death.
Here are the issues  I have with the movie and some comments:
1. The domestic violence just seems to pop up out of nowhere with the discovery of the affair. The truth is that domestic abuse is often times there from the beginning of the relationship and grows continually worse. It is progressive bu this movie doesn't show that.
2. She has a strong support system with her friends and the long lost dad who saves the day with the money and trainer. Most DV don't have that support.
3. Slim says emphatically, I'm not going to a shelter yet cries when she has no support, money or legal avenues. DV programs are there for her situation !
4. She becomes somewhat of a badass in 30 days. Training in hand to hand stuff, lock picking, and attitudes yet during the training montage they never show her sparring or getting hit, just training. Sorry, not realistic.
5. I did like that the movie showed many aspects of DV abuse situations where the husbands says things like "" I make the money, I make the rules. "" and  "" You want to fight? I'm a man, its not contest."" It clearly shows him controlling and possessive.  He also controls the money freezing her out of her accounts. It shows him using his daughter as a weapon in the fight.
6. The movie portrays her decision to take his life as rather mechanical and pretty unconflicted when she has no experience with combat, fighting, warrior philosophy, etc.
7. It gives the impression that she has tried everything and nothing has worked and she's had ""enough!""

1757297,5,B00006HAWN,"I disagree with the review that said the character's actions were stupid. It was pretty realistic. It took her a while to realize how bad the situation was. But given the reality of our legal system, dealing with someone that crazy and dangerous, her actions made complete sense. It really highlights how little help women with abusive husbands actually get. They are very much on their own.
The scene where she went to the police and found out how things would go was totally realistic. Reporting it to the police would do no good. First offense CDV is almost always a misdemeanor without bail or jail. All it does is make the perp angrier. That is why many women drop charges. Shelters are often full, or offer inadequate protection. That is the first place abusers look even if they are supposed to be secret.. Attorneys can't do anything, it is a matter for the prosecutor. Victims don't benefit from an attorney in a CDV hearing. Protective orders are worthless. Most women who are killed in domestic violence cases have them. All they do is make the abuser more angry. Violating a protective order is almost never prosecuted. She didn't have any choice but to run with little money unfortunately, since he immediately cut her off financially as was clear in the movie. Sbe didn't have enough warning to acquire savings. Going out of state - as far as possible was the only way to make it more difficult for him to locate her. Most women  would be far better off if they could prepare to physically protect themselves from a batterer. The movie made it clear that he had the means and the malice to find and kill her where ever she went. There is no way he would have gone to jail unless he actually did kill her and given the way his money would work for him in court, that wouldn't have been for long. Given the situation, it was pretty realistic that if she hadn't killed him, he would have killed her. And in real life, in similar situations, that is exactly what happens to hundreds of women every year. The uncommon grasp of the reality of her problem, and her courage and determination made her such a compelling character and it such a great movie. The legal system does essentially nothing to protect or help abused women who are truly the underdogs embroiled in a dangerous situation, They are truly alone when it comes to protecting themselves. it is nice to see one who does what she has to do in order to survive and protect herself rather than live in fear. Great tight plot. Each scene was important in telling the story, with nothing extraneous.",1397865600,5,2566,4.578260869565217

1757344,1,B00006HAWN,"I'll just admit right off the bat that I only watched this movie for one reason: Billy Campbell.

Sadly, he was the one actor that kept this movie above water for me. The little girl was OK too, but Campbell was the star in an otherwise crappy film.

Fist of all, J-Lo should *really* stick to music because she's a terrible (over)actress, not to mention 5 times more annoying than when she's singing. Secondly, the entire plot felt ridiculously forced from beginning to end; especially that opening scene where Slim first meets Robbie in the restaurant. I don't know if I've seen a more awkward scene than that in a long time. Besides the plot seeming to be forced upon the viewer, the actors' performances didn't seem believable at all. Again, the only performance that I felt was believable was Billy Campbell. The rest of the cast just seemed like they were bored to tears or reading from cue cards.  Also, what was Noah Wyle thinking when he took this? He's so much better than this little part shows. Real shame.

Sticking to the subject of believability, I just cannot understand why a woman would go through the amount of crap Slim did and not do anything to help herself and her little girl. Now, I've never personally been in an abusive relationship and I get that fear is often a reason why a woman would go back to her abuser, but saying ""Oh, no, no, no!"" and not taking some measure of protection against said abuser instead of simply escaping to a new place every time he tracks you down? Bogus. What's more, is that I can't believe that her family and friends didn't do more to help her, despite knowing that Mitch was beating her. Even when she refused help, the could've done a little more than just say ""OK then."" and wait until the next beating.

Most frustrating, crappy movie I've watched in a while.",1386979200,,1821,4.539634146341464

1757500,1,B00006HAWN,"This movie is ridiculous.  There are a hundred things to say about why this movie sucks, but the worst part is the ending.  She breaks into the father of her child's house with the intent of murdering him and making it look like self defense.  She pummels this guy while wearing gloves, destroying the house, and doesn't have a mark on her when the cops show up.  I love how the movie just jumps from the cops telling her she's one of the lucky ones to her embracing her daughter at the airport. The cops are just going to say hey,""She said it was self defense, the guy was really big and she is a woman so it must be true, so let's go get some coffee.""

  That's BS after seeing her hands were completely scar free, no one is going to beleive she beat this guy with her fist on her own in a spur of the moment self defense action.  Also regardless if it actually was self defense it is still a homicide which I would hope would involve some sort of investigation. There is only one living witness to this action which I would hope involve a polygraph.  Any claim of self defense or even why she came to the house would hopefully be detected.  Once she is caught in one lie, which she would, her whole plan would come tumbling down.  She would probably be arrested and tried with first degree murder.  Once they put this woman on trial and proved that she beat her ex husband to death, I think she would probably face the death penalty considering how much trauma you have to inflict on someone to beat them to death.  I don't think the defense is going to buy a self defense case against an abusive husband, when he really only was abusive to her once in all their years of marriage. I want a remake of this movie where JLO gets thrown and prison, loses her daughter, and is brutalized by butch female inmates.",1320278400,,1811,4.260233918128655

1757502,2,B00006HAWN,"I won't deny the fact that `Enough' has its moments.  In fact, the first watch through will most likely leave you riveted; completely glued to the screen.  This has a lot to do with the fact that Jennifer Lopez is extremely watchable, no matter what kind of garbage she is starring in (I mean, seriously...why can't she pick up a decent script?).

Abuse is far from a funny subject, and I'm not saying that `Enough' takes pot shots at the problem, but it doesn't do it justice.  Instead of feeling like a deeply rooted study on the issue, `Enough' feels more like a melodramatic Lifetime movie.  It's ridiculously constructed to produce characters that don't feel human.  Billy Campbell alone (who is far better an actor than this movie would lead you to believe) is nothing but a stereotype; a laughable caricature.  Laughable is not something you want to associate with the villain of your movie, unless you're Quinton Tarantino.  Sure, you'll be rooting for Lopez in the end, but who wouldn't.

The direction is standard fare for this breed of `thriller', so nothing to really write home about there.  The final showdown is just as intense and brutal as you would expect; maybe even more so.  I just hate that such serious subjects get such treatment.

I shows that women who are domestically abused in some way don't have an easy way out, that fear plays such a huge role and part in their life. People always say,""Why doesn't she just leave the guy or call the cops?!"" Well, in this movie that question is answered - in the real world it may not be the same, but the underlined problem is still there!

If you're going to make a movie like this, don't just make it worth our while, develop characters we actually care about. The violent husband was a cliche who becomes dangerous all of a sudden out of the blue, and the way he meets up with his future wife is so contrived. The saddest thing is that they had a chance to really make his character complex and they threw it all away. Such a waste. It may not seem necessary to develop the character of a wife-beater, but I have two things to say. One, if you make them look so inhuman nobody would ever be able to admit to themselves that their abusive spouse has a problem. Two, you might as well make another Twister because either way it ends up with a frantic character running for his/her life with a faceless blob swirling after them.

Mitch appears to be the perfect husband; he's a wealthy contractor who adores his wife and his young daughter.  But when Slim discovers that Mitch has been having affairs - so much so that he codes them numerically - she confronts him about it.  Suddenly, Mitch becomes a cruel, abusive mad-man, telling Slim, ""Look, I'm just a squirrel...""  Honestly, Mitch tells her that he always ""gets what he wants.""  So, naturally, Slim comes to the preposterous conclusion that she shouldn't report the problem to the police or a lawyer.  She doesn't take pictures for evidence.  She basically just kidnaps her child and runs out of state to hide out in hotels and a friend's house.  Smooth move, Mitch'll never find you now. (roll eyes)

Overall I thought the actors did a decent job.  Many say that Lopez can't act, but I happen to think that she's actually quite compelling - as is the rest of the cast.  I'm sure that if the movie showed a LOT more flesh, she'd be received more favorably.  Nothing else is all that impressive about the movie; everything else is just a matter of going through the paces.

Notes on the ending (Spoiler Alert!): It's incredibly stupid and insulting to anyone who has ever been in a real fight - Mitch would have destroyed Slim.  You don't take a few months of self defense and suddenly wipe the floor with someone who possesses every possible physical advantage.  Sorry, not gonna happen.  Not only that, but movies in which there is an obvious flaw in the criminal law process, glossed over simply because it advocates the weak premise within, is lazy and irresponsible (especially considering the delicate subject matter).  Had situations been reversed, this movie would have been lambasted by womyn groups. What I want to know is: Where is the outrage at blatant murder?  I'm not trying to minimize battered women, but Slim is clearly guilty of murder.  Instead of the you-go-girl, J-Lo ego-enhancing beat-down as the finale, it would have been better to see Slim on a chain-gang in west Texas, teary-eyed and reminiscing about a now teenage daughter who has to visit her mommy through a grimy plexi-glass wall in a viewing room.",1246406400,3,2485,4.79764705882353

Having been in an abusive relationship and very afraid for my child, I gave up everything to keep him out of our lives. ""Enough"" is a perfect title. It is a story of a determined, courageous mother on the run from a vicious and very successful husband who had the assets to find her repeatedly.  Jennifer Lopez was an underrated actress until she won a role in ""An Unfinished Life"" with Robert Redford and Morgan Freeman. As well as the film with Jane Fonda ""Monster In Law"". ""Enough"" is riveting and shows that there aren't enough options for battered women. Thank you for considering my opinion.",1221436800,,785,5.87719298245614

Jennifer Lopez carries the movie as Slim an abused wife who decides to fight back. Lopez gives one of her best performances since The Cell. Micheal Apted shows J-LO's beauty as a sweet innocent waitress, then a loving/battered housewife to a woman who has had Enough . Billy Campbell gives one of the best villians performances of the year as the husband and Noah Wyle is great as a supporting villian. Juillete Lewis, Dan Futtermen and Tessa Allen as Slim's daughter all give good performances also.

1757605,3,B00006HAWN,"In ENOUGH, Jennifer Lopez recreates a perpetual Hollywood genre, that of the abused woman in peril.  We have seen this before most recently with Julia Roberts in SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY.  And as with all such movies, the director has to define the line that separates the creepy and clammy feeling that one gets when one sees a dangerous and homicidal man trying to kill his wife from the vicariousness of revenge that one gets when the weirdo husband gets his comeuppance.

Lopez is Slim a decent and caring woman who falls for a rich cad (Billy Campbell) and thinks that she has found a story book marriage.  She has an adorable girl (Tessie Allen). When she finds out that he is a serial cheater and wife abuser, she leaves him.  Up to this point, ENOUGH is a realistic drama of The Woman in Peril.  Following her hasty departure, Lopez shows a breathtaking lack of brains that sets the stage for the inevitable cat and mouse game that quickly morphs into a Hollywood revenge fantasy. Women who see this film will surely react on a visceral level that eludes men.  Most of the latter half involves the transformation of Lopez from helpless victim to remorseless avenger. Even though there is a decided predictability built into the scenes that depict this morphing, one cannot help but be carried along by Lopez's plight and then her counter strategy. By the film's end, the women in the audience have learned what they must have suspected from the first--when you are in danger of abuse GET OUT OF THE HOUSE AND GET A LAWYER. What men feel about the plight of abused women is hopefully the same.  ENOUGH succeeds in resonating with an audience what a woman must do as a natural right in a time of mortal peril.",1197763200,,1714,4.5967213114754095

1757608,1,B00006HAWN,"This is just as vain and self-stroking a vehicle as the Julia Roberts' project about the abused wife with the attractive but alas violent hubby that I suspect this movie was based on.  Apart from Out of Sight, Jennifer Lopez picks movies that she feels creates an image of her that ingratiates her with the public and strokes all the class insecure hyper-ambitions of a true sellout.  I'm seductive because I'm hot yet vulnerable.  If you want that kind of hot, Rosanna Arquette in Desperately Seeking Susan still holds the crown and she didn't have to get on a soapbox about being from the barrio but I'm a princess on the inside or I'm so hot that my husband can't forget me because ultimately its not about the spousal abuse, oh no, its about being the most unforgettable gal in the world.  This  movie, Maid in Manhattan along with Julia Roberts' Pretty Woman, Julia Roberts' abused wife swims away from Patrick Bergen movie and yes, definitelym Erin Brockovich are just reasons for calling out Janeanne Garaofalo because I didn't take any feminist studies classes but I know the bull when I see it.  Sic 'em, Janey, sic' em.

So nevermind if female secretaries, nurses and interns just want to go home to their families at the end of the day - what these kinds of movies say about you is that you want your bosses.  It doesn't matter if there's no boss luring explicit in the story. This is about how she wants you to know that she is good enough and she wants you to see it and do something about it.  Nasty stuff.

p.s. I don't completely hate Jennifer Lopez.  I did like her all too brief but lovely appearance in Mi Familia and wished that I would see more of this authentic beauty.  She just ran off the integrity rails, made a lot of money and is of no interest to me whatsoever now.  I just don't want to see anything she is in.  If her character is commendable in any way, it just makes me think granted harshly how uncommendable her career choices have been and the effect that has had on impressionable young girls if only to add to the current lexicon of what qualifies as acceptable conduct  by girls and how they can be judged at the outset.",1180915200,,2159,4.444162436548224

And those who love quality film won't waste too much time even recognizing that this movie even exists. Guilty pleasure, indeed! One thing you have to admit about J.Lo, she's consistent. She sings bad, acts bad, and is merely eye candy, for thoe who find her appealing.

1757613,1,B00006HAWN,"Enough takes the formulaic made-for TV battered woman story and actually makes a big screen movie sillier than its cheesy small screen counterparts. Another entry into pseudo-feminist category, Enough is a hypocritical movie that preaches empowerment but constantly shows its heroine being objectified and degraded. I hope by reading this review you'll avoid this horrible movie.

Enough follows Slim, a waitress working at a Seattle Diner. (Strange she won't identify herself with her real name but objectifies herself by calling herself a shape) We never learn about Slim or her goals in life, she's just a beautiful woman in need of rescuing from her dead-end job. At work She meets up with a Mitch, a handsome rich customer. He woos her; after only minutes of screen time they're in love. Her unassuming ""Nice Guy(tm)"" boss warns her that Mitch bet him that he could get her into bed. He has the hots for her, too but Mr. Insecure doesn't say anything outside of that passive-aggressive(tm) warning. Despite OBVIOUS WARNING SIGNS about Mitch's CHARACTER Slim continues dating him. Golddigger is just happy to have a rich man sweep her off her feet and save her.

So Slim marries Mitch Charming and he decides to buy some guy's house just because he can. Oooh. POWER ISSUES. They have a child, but he won't let her hold her after giving BIRTH to her. Oooh. CONTROL ISSUES. Slim, distracted by Mitch's money can't see BIG RED FLAGS in front of her. It's not until five years later when she gets a call from another woman that she learns he's cheating on her. Instead of quietly taking money out of the joint account, and filing the divorce papers THEN, she confronts him. This leads to Mitch becoming abusive although he's never displayed this behavior previously. Psychology books say batterers have a PATTERN of behavior with women they date, but this movie follows Bizarro logic. He beats Slim down and slaps the kid around for good measure so we can hate him.

Slim goes to the cops with a huge bruise on her face but decides to NOT have him arrested or take out a restraining order, fearing he'll take her daughter. She actually believes the malarkey a desk sergeant tells her about the legal system instead of consulting an attorney. Scared, she makes a run for it in the night. But Mitch thwarts her escape plans. After another beatdown, he menaces her adoptive Dad and friend with a gun saying they're trespassing. When she tries another run for it, he freezes her financial assets. So with borrowed money, Slim takes her daughter to a motel. There, Mitch makes a threatening call saying he's everywhere. You'd think after being beaten TWICE she'd keep a tape recorder on hand to record moments like this for EVIDENCE. Making TERRORISTIC THREATS over the phone is a FELONY. Mitch breaks open the hotel door and Slim has to escape. They head up to Seattle where her ""Nice Guy(tm)"" friend lets them stay with him and puts his passive(tm) moves on her. Cop friends of Mitch pose as FBI. They rough him up, knock down stuff and cut up a sofa. Stupid Mitch doesn't know that ""Nice Guy(tm)"" would be a WITNESS and these cops would be facing charges from IAB and FBI because Mitch's pockets aren't fat enough to protect them from FEDERAL CIVIL RIGHTS CHARGES. Yes, Mitch here was STUPID enough to cross STATE LINES to commit his crimes. But Slim never keeps a RECORD of these incidents for EVIDENCE. She goes to real dad in San Fran for help, but gets none. You'd THINK she'd go to a library and study those wonderful Federal and state laws on the books and would be preparing her case with prosecutors.

Not wanting to endanger her friends, Slim heads to another city. Detroit, Orlando, they all somehow look Like San Francisco in this movie. Turns out Mitch has friends even in THIS city to help him do his dirty work. Mitch may be a rich, real estate guy, but I don't think anyone is THIS well connected. He coincidentally knows cops in EVERY city Slim goes to? Come on. The cop he enlists to help him is aware that he's committing a crime, but follows orders. Mitch makes more terroristic threats over the phone that Slim isn't smart enough to record for EVIDENCE. This leads to a silly car chase where Slim is SMART ENOUGH TO EVADE HIM ON ROADS SHE KNOWS BUT NOT SMART ENOUGH TO CALL 911 DURING THE CHASE. Terrified, Slim heads back to San Francisco. Dad now decides to help out with his money and connections.

Under Daddy's protection, Slim decides to FINALLY get legal advice from an attorney. She also decides to become ""empowered"" by training to kick Mitch's butt. I'd rather see her train to kick his butt in court with all the evidence shown throughout the movie, but she decides two wrongs will make right. Committing First-degree murder is far more satisfying to her than seeing Mitch and his colleagues go to prison.

Final act, Slim breaks into Mitch's house. She plants signal jammers and shuts out the lights. ""Empowered"" in her belly baring cleavage-exposing black spandex outfit she prepares to confront him. She throws down with Mitch in one of the stupidest fight scenes ever filmed. It's never smart for a woman to take a man on in a fistfight because: A MAN IS EIGHT TIMES STRONGER IN HIS UPPER BODY THAN A WOMAN. He could have KILLED Slim with ONE PUNCH. It happens all the time in real life. Seriously. But following the Bizarro logic of this movie, Slim not only beats the crap out of the s Mitch, she KILLS him. After committing murder, (a handwriting expert would have easily figured out her letters were forgeries during the investigation), Slim goes on to live happily ever after with her ""Nice Guy(tm)"" diner owner friend, not knowing that he's just like man she just murdered. (Read my review of The Last American Virgin to learn why ""Nice Guys(tm)"" are dangerous.)

Like its contemporaries The Rich Man's Wife, Gang of Roses, and Catwoman in the Pseudo Feminist genre, Enough makes a mockery of feminism with its sexist message of ""empowerment."" The wrongheaded ideas in this movie tell women to overcome domestic violence with violence, not seek counseling to deal with the emotional trauma or plan a legal strategy. It's interesting to note like in those other mentioned movies, the more ""empowered"" Slim becomes, the less clothing she wears. We never get to see Slim's face during the movie, only her body parts. This segmenting of her body takes away from her humanity and prevents us from connecting with her emotionally.

Production values on this movie are not ""Enough"" considering the talent. The poorly written screenplay has dialogue that comes from the first draft of a Learning Annex student. Scenes don't transition into each other smoothly leading to a disjointed uneven story.

Plain and simple, the acting is downright wretched in this movie. Jennifer Lopez is horrible in the role of Slim. She plays her character with no emotion in most scenes and is over the top in others. Billy Campbell is ridiculous to watch as the batterer. He is a cartoon character who gets more over the top with each scene.

I agree that J.Lo is not the cream of the crop and I doubt she'll be up for an oscar anytime soon but her performance here is far from the trash that some reviewers would lend you to believe.  There are some minor plot problems here.  My sister was in an abusive relationship and so I've seen it first hand.  The fact that it took Mitch YEARS to ever hit Slim is kinda rediculous.  Most abusive relationships start before the marraige with signs of controll and jealousy and the abuse usually starts shortly after the vows are said.  That aside, once Mitch starts hitting he doesn't stop.  Slim fights back of course and leaves him, stuppidly in the middle of the night.  I mean, the guy is sleeping around all the time so why don't you pick a time when he's gone...ANYWAYS...after she's out of the house the intensity starts as she tries to stay one step ahead of the man that wants her dead.  THe film is gripping and does well to show the self hatred and loss that an abuse victim can go through but it failed to show the confusion and devotion that the abused usually feels.  My sister would hate him and then defend him over and over.  The problem with abuse is that the abuser manipulates the woman into feeling worthless and dependant to the point that they feel they don't deserve any better.  J.Lo never showed that side of the story.  I do have to say that it was nice to see a woman stick up for herself and her daughter, but it just wasn't realistic to me.  All these issues really raise no bar against the fact that this is entertainment and with entertainment it doesn't need to be realistic, just enjoyable, and Enough is enjoyable, all except for the annoying overacting by Noah Wyle...They should have cut his charactor out of the film!",1144022400,2,1827,4.431137724550898

The flawlessly beautiful Lopez is completely believable as the trophy wife. Mitch (Billy Campbell) as the husband does a slow transformation from gallant hero to maniac that is truly creepy and terrifying.  The movie is a metaphor for the way a loving partner can slowly change. Perhaps that is why it chills to the bone.

Mitch is obscenely rich, and that wealth has both spoiled him and corrupted him. He is like a selfish, spoiled two year old. He has no morals. He is as implaccable and faceless a foe as those after Gene Hackman in the Conversation. Imagine having Bill Gates on your tail sparing no expense to make your life a terror.

The last part of the movie was pure cold-blooded, gory revenge fantasy, almost a separate movie, totally different in tone. The final fight scene could not even be described a fight &mdash; more a premeditated murder.

The weakest part of the movie was Tessa Allen as the young daughter Gracie.  The movie treated her like a precious little doll without a thought in her head about the heavy drama going on around her. She seemed zonked on valium.",1131580800,2,1288,4.672566371681416

The girl I was with got really into it and wanted to kick the bad guy's a$$ after he lied to Jennifer Lopez and all.  Not exactly a date movie but it really gets the blood boiling.

Columbia TriStars English Dolby Digital 5.1 mix has a handful of moments that really made me sit up and take notice, but by and large the story and  its predentation don't lend themselves to much in the way of exceptional noticeable sound cues.

Jennifer Lopez also proved she had dramatic acting ability in ""The Cell."" Wow, what a waste of all involved. All of them seem to be slumming it.

Following a formulatic, but tolerable rising action, the film quickly falls apart when Lopez's character goes on the run with her daughter from her abusive husband.  Plot holes and quickly executed fragments of the story ruin an otherwise predictable but entertaining film.

While the point of the film is a woman's power to protect herself and her children, the film seems to just be gearing towards the mass of girl power films of the last few years.  Nothing original or engaging happens in ""Enough"" and the finale sequence is pretty laughable.

1757746,3,B00006HAWN,"Boy howdy, the fems are getting pretty rough these days.  I suppose after generations of being dominated by the male sub-species that once the ladies decided to strike back they meant just that:  strike back.  A perfect example of estrogen TNT in a can is Jennifer Lopez swingin', sweatin', and kickin' in ENOUGH.
Let's face it, we all know where ENOUGH is headed.  J-Lo plays a greasy spoon waitress (yeah, like that's believable) who happens to fall for a smooth-talking swell (Bill Campbell) who turns out not to be the nicest guy on the block.  Er, the planet.  And when J-Lo confronts Hubby about his flagrant infidelity, Hubby responds with some fisticuffs and then refuses to let his wife out of the marriage.  Granted, Campbell is ultra-creepy to watch. . .he's so revolting and disgusting that even my dog knew he was going to get the ultimate comeuppance at the end of this flick.
With the help of friends, J-Lo and young daughter flee and relocate thousands of miles away, yet Hubby is relentless in his pursuit.  Once it becomes obvious that a custody showdown is inevitable, J-Lo does the only logical thing:  She enlists the aid of a martial arts dude and learns how to fight like a tiger.  Tigress?  Then, it's back to California to sneak into Hubby's new flat and extract a pound of posterior.  And, of course, predictability reigns supreme as the film rolls to its conclusion.
I've had the luxury of viewing this film with other ladies, and their reaction has been somewhat universal.  Not a one of them would have put up with the guff J-Lo did; in fact, the first time a punch was thrown Hubby would have first been looking at the floor to find his mountain oysters, just before he would feel the piercing pain of buckshot.  But, perhaps justice is swifer in my neck of the woods.  Anyway, in ENOUGH J-Lo kind of blindsides her husband during their kung fu match.  Ain't fair.  I demand a best two-out-of-three.

1757747,4,B00006HAWN,"Jennifer Lopez stars as Slim in this thriller about an abused woman who flees her rich and well-connected husband Mitch (Bill Campbell).  At stake is not only Slim's well-being but also the psychological and physical protection of their young daughter Gracie (played adorably by little Tessa Allen).  Although this flick has the trappings of a feminist fight-back story with its theme of domestic violence and custody laws, make no mistake:  this is a thriller through and through, with twists and violence and personal peril at every turn.  Women will delight in the training scenes where J-Lo prepares to fight back, and men will hardly mind the sight of the buff actress learning to defend herself.
Yeah, the premise as it unfolds is a little ridiculous, especially as Mitch seems to have a GPS system to track his fleeing wife, but the escapism is pure adrenaline-rushing fun.  Jennifer Lopez is naturally appealing and solid in her performance, although the emotional range of the role seems to demand only fierceness and fright.  Still, the chemistry between her and young co-star Allen is unmistakable, even poignant.  Noah Wylie does a fantastic turn as Robbie, a character I won't describe for fear of spoiling the plot.  Juliette Lewis has her usual on-screen charisma even though she's not given much to work with.
This film was much better than I expected.  Viewers hoping for something new or even substantial on the theme of domestic violence will be disappointed since it only serves as a plot device to put Lopez's character in danger.  This would make a great date flick since men will appreciate the constant action (not to mention the lead actress) and women will be drawn to the subject matter.",1089590400,47,1714,4.961538461538462

The movie likes to fancy itself as a feminist picture, but I don't buy it for a minute.  Plausibility is thrown out the window, and in its place are a predictable script and cliched dialogue (""If I can't have you, then no one else will."").  When this movie came out in the summer of 2002, it totally bombed at the box office.  Gee, no small wonder when you consider the plot: boy meets girl at diner; boy marries girl; boy loses temper and slaps girl around; girl takes child and relocate to get away from boy; girl takes fighting lessons and beats the crapola out of boy.  Quite frankly, for a real movie on domestic violence, I'd stick with ""The Burning Bed,"" starring Farrah Fawcett.  True, that movie had some of the ingredients of a Lifetime feature presentation, but it had something ""Enough"" doesn't have: believability and depth.  I'm also curious as to why Jennifer Lopez, a fairly decent actress, and director Michael Apted, an otherwise capable filmmaker, would bother with exploitative trash like this.  My hunch is that they did it for the paycheck, which is the only thing this film had to offer them.  For the rest of us, it's 2 hours of your life wasted.",1085961600,2,1366,4.658333333333333

Although not as hideous as Gigli, Enough tries to pass off the usual segmenting of the body and booty shots, with a feminist cover.  This movie has made many claims about its modern, feminist messages, but in reality it defies the messages it sets out to portray by depicting JLO's character as it does.  The very name of the main character, ""Slim,"" is a commentary on the nature of the film.  Slim is the surveyed.  She is constantly being viewed and judged by her male counterparts.  The film also ignores other aspects of Slim's life.  Her race, economic, and social class are ignored for the better part of the film.  She is seen in only one role until her husband finds her, and that is the role of a waitress.  A father figure later appears in the film to help the character, however this only serves to reassert the fact that a woman needs male intervention to survive on her own.
I think this film is severly lacking in the areas that it claimed would be the strongest.  Enough is an anti-feminist view of the world in which we live.",1084233600,5,1087,4.472081218274112
1757783,3,B00006HAWN,"Enough is the story of a woman who marries a man and has a daughter with him, only to realize he is an abusive, insane killer who will stop at nothing to bring her down. Jennifer Lopez's character, Slim, is the mother who wants to protect herself and her child from her dangerous husband. However, Slim seems to have trouble with dealing with her problem so she insists on consistently running and hiding away. Though the general idea of the movie is female empowerment, there are reasons to see otherwise. For example, Slim lets herself be chased from her home, her friends, her life, by her vicious husband. Then she proceeds to hide away with another man, seeking protection and housing. Furthermore, she finds her biological father and receives money from him to start a new life, and for training in self defense from yet another male, in order to take care of her little problem, her husband. Her husband throughout all this always has his eye on her, and she knows it. She is forced inside his panoptical view, and must always be on her toes.
J Lo in this case plays a `damsel in distress' waiting for her knight in shining armour, who comes in many forms until Slim, herself, can get out of this drastic situation. And being J Lo, of course the camera must frame itself on specific parts of the female body, just to prove how hard she worked to achieve her freedom from the madman that is her husband.
Overall, it sparks thoughts about female empowerment, and male dominance in Hollywood films.",1084233600,,1502,4.608208955223881

As Slim discovers her husband's secret mistresses, she also discovers his hidden demons and rage.  The plot thickens as she and her daughter escape from his abusive tendencies to live a new underground, secretive life.  Slim recognizes her ""maternal-animal right"" to protect her child which pushes her to train to become the ultimate woman fighter and defeat her abusive, arrogant husband.
 In this film, Slim's character is made out to be a strong, independent woman finally liberated to run her life the way she wants to.  However, she is nevertheless played by Jennifer Lopez, who carries her own outside persona as a singer/dancer/powerful Latino woman.  It is hard to see past J. Lo and perceive Slim as a real mother fleeing an abusive relationship.  Slim is still a stereotypically, beautiful, Hollywood-modeled woman in a strong Hollywood woman role.  Fractioned camera angles and close-ups of J. Lo's body emphasize her outside persona even more.  Therefore, objectifying her character as a sexy woman.  She is a spectacle for the mass of viewers to watch.  This idea relates to John Berger's concept of the male surveyor viewing the female surveyed in his book, Ways of Seeing.  J. Lo creates the desire in Slim's appearance and femaleness for a male perspective to take pleasure in.

But Mitch continues to persue her, until Slim desides to take a stand because she has had enough. Enough was a suspenseful thriller with very good acting by Jennifel Lopez and Bill Capmbell. I would suggest this movie to anyone.
 This movie for the most part, was shot through a male cinematic gaze. At some points during the movie, it is clear to see the objectification of Jennifer Lopez is. In a scene you will see a close-up of certain portions of her body for no particular reason. I like the way that the film Enough kinda of critiqued a couple of existing stereotypes about women. The first was that women want this ""perfect"" life with a house in the suberbs, the perfect loving husband, and an adorible child. However, for the most part in life, the ""perfect"" life does not exist. In Enough, Slim's perfect dream life turned into a nightmare. Also, this film address the idea that women are weaker then men. During the course of the movie, Mitch says things to Slim like ""What are you gonna do to hurt me?"" or ""All I have to do is hit you once"".",1084233600,,1769,4.510903426791277

Slim has a daughter Gracie (Tessa Allen), and decides for both their safety to leave Mitch. After Slim and Gracie leave, Mitch relentlessly pursues them wherever they run to, and Slim is then faced with the reality that she could either be on the run the rest of her life, which would be totally detrimental to Gracie's life, or face Mitch and put an end to this conflict.
Through most of this movie, it portrays a stereotypical situation where an abused wife is on the run from an abusive husband. We see a typical portrayal of the woman being afraid in Slim and the typical portrayal of the abusive, not afraid husband in Mitch. Although the end of the movie sort of strays away from this stereotypical setup, for the most part it is thrown in our faces.
We also can take note as to some of the camera angles throughout the movie. When Slim is shown throughout, the general angle is that of her entire body. This is definitely an example of objectifying the woman character because showing the whole body is saying that we (the viewers/surveyors) want to see her entire body (surveyed), not just her face.
Overall, this movie is not the greatest of movies as it presents a stereotypical situation while objectifying Slim's physical appearance. Although the ending gives a sense of retribution, we see that Slim's appearance is still objectified in her tight clothing that she wears that just highlights her figure.",1084233600,,1686,4.777397260273973

1757829,1,B00006HAWN,"Michael Apted's 2002 movie 'Enough', though being marketed as appealing to a 'feminist' audience through it's plot, rather shows and affirms prevailing stereotypes of woman- and motherhood as well as class and race.
Even though the 'operative' character is a woman, her motivations and actions are ultimately dependent on men.
The heroine, portrayed by J. Lopez has no upward mobility whatsoever and is 'rescued' into better circumstances by an, of course, far wealthier caucasian man.
When he turns out to be violent, she acts against him not on her own, but on her childs behalf. Furthermore, in order to achieve anything against him, she requires male council and financial support.
Thus the supposedly strong female character is the bearer of a naive morality, lacks economical aspirations and insight and is powerless in society in comparison to the male characters. J Lo's character far from being independent and empowered, re-confines 'woman' to Kinder/Kueche/Kirche.
On top of this, J Lo is framed throughout the movie in a commodifying manner that supports the unlike distribution of power between the sexes in this movie. Her body is rarely shown as a whole but always from compromising angles with focus on her bosom and behind.
Overall the film advertises desirable feminitiy through visual traits while omitting to comment on women's capabilities outside of traditional female space.",1084233600,,1397,5.32579185520362

However, when things go awry she abandons her role of a perfect wife and begins to form a new image as the protector of herself and her daughter.  In her transition she goes from the weak and defenseless wife to a powerful and independent woman capable of taking on her husband.  The metamorphosis into a dominant woman consisted of Slim cutting her hair short and training to be a fighter.  Slim is no longer objectified by Mitch or any other man as she was at the opening of the movie.  When Slim worked as a waitress at the onset of the movie she was unknowingly being watched by Mitch.  Through Mitch's surveillance of Slim, he determined that she would be his wife.  This is a portrayal of a society where men choose whom they want and how she will be treated based on physical attributes.  Enough is a dramatic interpretation of an ideal family going tragically wrong.  It is also a representation of how it is possible for mistreated women to overcome their typical obedient roles in a male dominating world.",1084233600,,1561,4.595667870036101
1757832,2,B00006HAWN,"In many ways, Enough is a stereotypical Hollywood escapist type movie.  On the surface level, it's a reasonably entertaining movie about a woman fighting back against an oppressive husband.  However, As is the case with most escapist type movies, under a critical lense the plot shows some serious flaws.  Despite the guise of female empowerment, the plot fails to show any genuine resistance to the patriarchal system.  In many cases, there are many scenes in the movie that seek to highlight Jennifer Lopes's sexual attractiveness, all in the typically male gaze of Hollywood  All of the authority figures are male, and Slim is constantly dependent on them in order to resist her abusive husband.  Slim only resists one man, her husband, while she leaves the patriarchal system virtually unchallenged.  The appeal is not to a social betterment of women, but a single isolated event of resistance.
 In the end, if your looking for a powerful movie relating to empowerment of women and resistance to the patriarchal system, there are far better movies.  However, taken in the context of a simple escapist movie centering on a tale of revenge, with the twist that it is women against man, it is probably not a terribly bad bet.  Some amusing moments, a reasonably exciting end, numerous plot holes, but in the end it is defiantly not the worst movie ever made.  But it is nothing terribly ""special"" either.",1084233600,,1405,4.9361702127659575
1757833,2,B00006HAWN,"Enough  A Review by Ashley McBride
In this film the character of Slim played by Jennifer Lopez finds herself with a child and married to a husband who has undergone some dramatic and unexplained personality change and begins to beat her.  Overall, the plot was easy to guess as well as incredibly over the top and somewhat difficult to watch.

This film puts on a faade of being a feminist revenge film, however fails miserably with its male cinematic gaze and compartmentalization of Slim's body.  What purpose does a tight black outfit and numerous full screen shots of Lopez's million dollar bottom serve? Though this looks like a feminist film, it is misleading-there are simply too many shots of pieces-of-woman verses shots of the whole woman.
Throughout the film, Slim is objectified by the panoptical view from her abusive and threatening husband.  She is chased down and ""always being watched"" by her husband, even when she is not.  Slim subjectifies this panoptic field of view of her husband and this terrorizes her-driving her to martial arts which turns into revenge driven ploy to drive her husband away, yet not to kill him.  Though I really do not know what she would have done if she had not killed him, would anything have changed, especially with his evident drive to pursue her?
This film recreates certain stereotypes as well, with motherhood, class and color-coding.  The color coding issue is that it is a Latina mother that is so driven to protect her young from danger.  Another example is that both the lawyer Slim sees for advice and the martial arts instructor are black, and the abusive father is white-rarely, if ever, in Hollywood mainstream for this situation, do we see these roles reversed.  Another stereotype is that Slim is not of high economic class (she is a waitress)-a major myth in Hollywood is that a middle or upper class mother would not protect her young as undoubtedly as lower class.
Though the film offers a terrorized wife/mother her independence and control-it also makes it seem that she is driven by social, economic, and racial issues to do so.  This intersected with the compartmentalization of Slim's body and the fact that she had no other choice by the time she did something about her husband, add up to create not a feminist, but rather anti-feminist film shot with a cornerstone male cinematic gaze.",1084233600,,2360,4.860349127182045
1757834,2,B00006HAWN,"Enough, directed by Michael Apted and starring Jennifer Lopez, was advertised as a movie about an abused woman's revenge on her evil husband.  One would guess, then, that this movie would be inclined toward feminist principles; however, there is evidence of sexist representations of both men and women, and instances of the objectification of women.  Before her husband is proved to be an unfaithful and abusive man, the film unfolds like a fairytale.  Mitch, a wealthy contractor, meets Slim at her waitressing job and rescues her from her blue-collar world.  They have the perfect wedding, the perfect house, the perfect daughter, and the perfect life.  This first section of the film reinforces the stereotype that working-class women need a strong man to save them and give them the life they want.
 The first dose of reality hits when Slim discovers Mitch is cheating on her; she protests, he hits her, and she determines to leave him. The fact that Slim is very strong in her decision to not wait for him to hit her again certainly sends a good message to women and girls about abuse.  It seems for a moment that the stereotype of the fairytale romance will be subverted and that the woman will triumph.  The reality of what happens next is just as questionable as the fairytale beginning to the story; Mitch becomes completely evil, like a villain from a comic book, while Slim becomes the self-sacrificing mother who would do anything for her child.
 On the surface, Lopez's character appears to be a strong, independent woman who is capable of taking care of herself.  However, throughout the film she proves to be dependent on men.  Her adoptive father helps her escape from Mitch's house with her daughter and she turns to her biological father for financial help.  She seeks shelter and support from her close friend, Joe, and she finally seeks training in fighting techniques from a man.  Ginny, played by Juliette Lewis, is a female friend who does help her a great deal, but most of the people that helped to `save' her were men.  This reinforces the stereotype that women cannot really be strong on their own; they are never really safe without the help of men.  Another stereotype of women supported in this film was that of the mother.  Slim does absolutely everything for her daughter, Gracie.  Never does she speak of leaving Mitch for her own good; Slim always speaks of the safety of her daughter.  In other words, the filmmaker is essentially saying that women must remain mothers above all else.
  In addition to the female stereotypes we see, the idea of a woman being surveyed by the male surveyor is seen several times in Enough.  At the very beginning of the movie, Mitch sees Slim and finds her attractive; he is a wealthy man who observes a beautiful woman and wants her for his own, so he takes her.  Later in the film, when Slim has changed her name and moved to the west coast, we see Mitch's henchman staring at her through the window, simply watching her sleep and get dressed.  Then, when Mitch arrives to `take back what is his,' he also observes her like someone watching a movie.  He looks at her from afar like a man surveying his land; he clearly sees her as his property rather than an actual person.",1084233600,,3243,4.699115044247788
1757835,1,B00006HAWN,"I don't think that too many people will argue that ""Enough"" is high art or a deeply thoughtful and complex film. Even the Amazon.com review refers to it as a ""guilty pleasure"", so I'm not going to break any new ground by criticizing it. But I'll do it anyway because I'm a jerk like that.
Enough is not an altogether uninteresting premise, but it takes it in hackey, conventional b-movie thriller type directions. On top of those criticsms, there's also the treatment of Jennifer Lopez's Slim as a female character. Slim is presented as a supposedly strong female character who takes her fate into her own hands, but the film sets forth a different message. Firstly, Slim chooses to stay in an abusive relationship with her husband for a little while, before deciding that she's had ""enough"", rather than leaving at the first chance that she gets. From there, she spends a great deal on the film on the run, completely at the mercy of her rich, powerful husband, until finally taking a vigilante approach to achieving justice. All of this frames Slim as a weak character who is moved by fear for her life and her daughter's life, as opposed to her own wants and happiness.
On top of this, the film commodifies Jennifer Lopez as a sexy action hero, instead of allowing her character to be well rounded. For most of the film we see a weak, scared Slim. In the final act, Jennifer Lopez morphs into J-Lo, the multi-million dollar buttkicking star whol will destroy all that gets in her way (all the while the camera is disecting her and...accentuating certain parts of J-Lo's body). At this point she ceases to be a person, but rather a product.

Slim, played by J-Lo, is an orphan whose father abandoned her and her mother when she was born, causing her to have a distrust of men and lack of relationships.  However, while at work one day, Slim is swept off her feet by Mitch, the seemingly perfect gentleman.  Four years after they are married with a child, when Slim has transformed herself into Mitch's idea of the perfect wife, Mitch's true colors are revealed.  Slim discovers his philandering ways and he undergoes a dramatic transformation from a compassionate husband to an aggressive, dominating, evil one.  At the onset of the marriage Slim is shown as the perfect wife and mother; she is passive, loving, and stays home to take care of her husband.  As Mitch's identity is revealed, Slim's transforms to a dominant, strong mother fighting for her and her daughter's life.  Slim breaks the stereotypes of what a wife should be as she gains control of her life and leaves Mitch, however, she holds onto the stereotypical mom qualities.  She travels cross country to protect her daughter and tries her hardest to give her a good life.  She acquires a nice house in a seemingly perfect neighborhood and tries to learn how to be a good cook in order to keep her daughter happy and be a good mother, while at the same time she hires a trainer to learn how to free herself from her husbands grasp.

1757878,1,B00006HAWN,"Jennifer Lopez's character ""Slim"" is by no means a representation of an empowered female.  The film frames Slim in a way that boxes her into the stereotypical roles of first a lonely, low-income waitress swept off her feet by a charming, handsome ""prince,"" then a loving, caring mother, and finally a ""fighter.""  The close-up shots of Jennifer Lopez in her tight, belly-baring training outfit completely segment her body and remove the audience from the action.  Instead of focusing on the actions themselves, the camera focuses on the body, forcing the viewer to act as both a surveyor and spectator.  Of course, Jennifer Lopez is infamous for that bum of hers, but how many times must it flash across the screen before it takes on a larger character than Slim herself?  This technique of segmenting Jennifer Lopez's body sends a message to the female audience that it is Slim's physical appearance that develops her as a strong woman and gives her the power to ""fight"" back, not her intellect.  Even though Slim breaks away from the abusive relationship with her husband, she is still dependent on a male character throughout the film.  First it is her fairytale-like father who supports her financially.  Next her new lover, Joe, supports her emotionally.  The scene in which Joe and Slim lie in bed together suggest that Slim is finally settled into her new life because she has a man at her side.  Finally, it is her male trainer who ""gives"" her the ability to fight back.  All in all, the film is a total flop in terms of taking on the serious social issue of domestic abuse and a woman's rise above it.",1084147200,7,1609,4.731182795698925

At first Slim falls into the stereotypical role of many mothers in which she allows her husband to take full control/ power over her life, and she must take it back.  One important point throughout the film is the idea of being watched at all times, the all knowing and all seeing... the Panopticon.  ""Enough"" illustrates the transition of power from Mitch to Slim observed by the idea of the Panopticon.  Thus, Mitch loses his masculine hold over Slim, the ""weak and helpless"" mother, who becomes strong and breaks through the dependency, and domesticity, no longer abiding by the ""rules"" set upon women to act and appear a certain way.

1757880,3,B00006HAWN,"Movie critics always seem to hate three things:Overused plots,good-looking movie stars,and J.Lo. Almost every critic I know hates J.Lo's movies,including this one. Sure,it has all three things,but you can't help but put it in the guilty pleasure category. And,I have to admit that J.Lo does a pretty good job acting on this one,being semi-convincable as an abused woman.

1757881,4,B00006HAWN,"Enough was a movie about the struggle of a woman trying to live her life as the fantasy of the perfect marriage.  Jennifer Lopez plays Slim, who we first see in a diner just trying to make money and survive the middle economic class lifestyle.  She is swept off her feet by a man who seems to be nothing less than the perfect future husband.  Scenes show them happily together on sunset beaches, nothing could be better.  Mitch has a lot of money and is willing to do anything with it to keep Slim happy.  He bought her love and pulled her into his trap, while she had no idea what she was getting into.
 When things get out of hand, Slim decides that the only way out of it all is to run away from Mitch's constant affairs and violent acts.  Slim suffers the theory of the panopticon.  Slim is always looking over her shoulder making sure that she isn't being watched.  Mitch is constantly on her trail and Slim knows this.  She takes her child and runs away to a new place whenever she feels as though Mitch is getting near.  Mitch is afraid of being known as an abusive, cheating husband, so he does anything to keep Slim from talking to friends and family about the problems.  At the same time, Slim will do anything to keep Mitch away from her and keep her child safe.
 The movie starts with Slim being a totally dependent woman.  She needed guidance and a man in her life to fix things and show her a better living standard.  By the end of the movie, Slim's hair is shorter giving her a more masculine look; she learns self defense techniques so that she doesn't have to run from Mitch anymore.

Panopticism is when a person doesn't know if they are being watched, but always have the feeling like they are being watched.  Slim knew that Mitch was looking for her when she ran away, and created a door latch mechanism on the front door, for when Mitch found her.

Well, that was a great movie too, but don't think you have to pass up THIS movie.
What I like best about this movie, besides the great acting performances, is that the movie is really realistic. Like, after Slim (Jennifer Lopez)'s husband Mitch (Billy Campbell) attacked her the first time, friends and family told her to report him to the authorities, but she kept turning that suggestion down because she wanted to keep the marriage together for the sake of her daughter (Gracie, played by Tessa Miller). But after a while Slim takes Gracie and flees, and she eventually goes to a lawyer asking for help. The lawyer then tells her that he can't help her because all she had to do was report Mitch (like her friends said), but instead she let it go on and eventually stole her own child, so to speak.
Overall, this is a very good and introspective movie, and it really gives an interesting tale about the chaos that is domestic violence. And to the anonymous one-star, one-sentence reviewers, if you don't like Jennifer, then who are you to rate this?

1757885,2,B00006HAWN,"Yet another movie that starts with an intriguing, compelling premise and then veers off-course into insipid melodrama.  Jennifer Lopez stars as a woman who meets an apparent Prince Charming (Billy Campbell); the couple are soon wed and start a family.  Everything appears to be headed towards ""Happily Ever After"" until Lopez discovers that hubby has a mistress on the side.  When confronted, Campbell peels off his mask and reveals himself to be, in fact, a chauvinistic wife-beater.  Lopez resolves to take their daughter and run ... and it's at this point that the movie breaks down, with Campbell persuing his fleeing wife with all the mechanized determination of The Terminator.  The plot gets steadily cornier, with the down-and-out Lopez luckily getting financial help from her estranged multimillionaire father (wouldn't it be great if all abused wives just happened to have untapped resources like that?), and then receiving the training necessary to - literally - become a female Terminator herself, after which she engages Campbell in a brutal fight-to-the-death.  (I'll let you guess who wins.)
The two leads give interesting performances up until the time the script requires their characters to turn cartoonish, and they are given able support by Juliette Lewis as Lopez's best friend.  The wonderful and capable Dan Futterman is pretty much wasted in the thankless role of Lopez's loyal former beau.  The best performance in the film is given by Noah Wyle, playing against type as a hot-tempered renegade bad cop with a very bad case of road rage; it would be interesting to see Wyle play this type of role again, but in a better film.  As satisfying as it might be to see an abusive brute get back better than he dished out, ""Enough"" is ultimately way too incredible and far-fetched to deliver genuine thrills.",1079913600,,1826,5.06
1757886,2,B00006HAWN,"Jennifer Lopez gets married. Jennifer Lopez gets beat. Jennifer Lopez gets revenge. If it sounds like a tv movie, you're on the right track.  Domestic abuse is by no means an ordinary subject, but the filmmakers decided on the generic route and the result is two overdrawn hours of clichs. There's nothing to expound on because you already know the formula; Slim (Lopez) and Mitch (Billy Campbell) - nice names - are in love, then he starts using her face for boxing practice. She decides she's had *enough* and, with their daughter in tow, makes a run for it. Slim's not going to take this lying down though, and she learns some hybrid of boxing and karate to combat his abuse. Watch out, Mitch......
So many good things could have come from this film and yet it amounts to little more than two hours worth of dead brain cells. Regardless of her personal life, Jennifer Lopez is a decent actress, given a strong script. As there is none, she walks through the film, looking doe-eyed at times, tough at others, but mostly like she'd rather be making a music video. I actually enjoyed Billy Campbell's departure from his usual cheeky, nice guy role, but again, stretching a wife beater (no pun intended) around him doesn't exactly create character. And that's the problem with this farce of a film; there's no complexity to any character. Noah Wylie makes a brief appearance, coming and going whenever he pleases.
So, some unanswered questions the filmmakers never bothered posing. Is it a drama, is it a thriller, is it a crime film? Who cares?! Slim isn't even interesting enough to elicit our empathy. Why was this film made? Certainly not for profit because it managed a negative dent at the box office. Nor were the writers much concerned about drawing out the emotional and physical strengths and weaknesses of women who suffer domestic violence.

1757918,3,B00006HAWN,"Yeah, I know, it's a predictable, forgettable, trifle. And that it's an excuse for Jennifer Lopez and Bill Campbell to get really dramatic and play an abused wife and an abusive husband, and hopefully score some Oscar buzz. It's also an exploitation flick, utilizing Lopez's rapport with female audiences and her booty-obsessed men as a means of making a few dollars for a film that's been told before. But the movie has a message, guys. Yes, it does. The movie is really a cautionary tale. Yeah, girls will learn much from this film. What, you ask? Well, about being independent, that's what.
You see, Lopez's character, Slim, was abandoned by her rich, unfaithful father, and loss her mother to death. Slim would later go on to attend college, but only temporarily, since she was unable to pay for tuition and everything else that girls love to empty their pocketbooks with. So she works as a waitress for a fast-food diner, wishing that she would one day meet a nice fellah with a bulging pocket.
Slim, be careful what you wish for, `cause you just might get it.
And boy does she get it.
Her ""prince charming"" comes in the form of a handsome, affluent man, named Mitch Hiller, who also happens to have a phobia for monogamy. Most women would cry out-right that he is nothing but a low down dirty dog. Which he is. And like most men, he uses the ""men have needs"" excuse, hoping to maybe calm Silm's embarrassment and sense of self-worthlessness.
Actually, he figures he has the right to do whatever he wants in this relationship because he is the sole provider. Which he is. Slim of course quit her job as a waitress and is now a housewife; as dependent on her husband as she was to her father, and her mother to her husband. Talk about regression.
What's sad about this story is the fact that Slim isn't responsible for the path her life has taken (what, you think so?). Who knows beforehand that their boyfriend or husband has a penchant for cheating? Slim, not some lazy bimbo dreaming of one day living totally off her beau, was actually determined to go to college, get an education, find a suitable, high-paying job, and independently support herself. But as a character reminds her late in the story, ""the universe has a way of working against us."" Which it did.
But I suppose she should have expected at least a wrinkle or two to rear its ugly head, what with her life being so perfect and all, living in a epic lap of luxury. Yes, she should have. But as she says, ""I'm not the sort of woman that men just beat up."" Which is true. Why a guy would want to abuse and cheat on a woman with such a face and bodacious body is totally beyond me.
Ultimately, the film becomes a minor feminist piece about a once weak woman gaining at least the physical strength to dominate her chauvinistic husband. Yes, this is what you all expected, as the film is a product of crowd-pleasing Hollywood and all.
Jennifer Lopez revealed herself to be an effortlessly charismatic, confident, wholly sympathetic, and cool actress in such films as Selena, Out of Sight, and even Anaconda. In this film, she's required to be ten-times more emotional, a thespian calling attention to herself, during the early confrontational scenes between her and her beau. Only as the film continues, where Slim is desperate to escape her hubby's evil clutches and must think up ways to avoid his wrath, does she replace the over-the-top acting for a reserved cool.
Bill Campbell, in the role of the abusive husband, relishes every minute of playing this character. He's kind of effortlessly intimidating and creepily chilly. This actor, too, is playing against type. Television buffs might remember him from the critically-acclaimed Once & Again, where he portrayed, well, a saint.
The film, while not flawless, is certainly better than it should be. Everything you expect to happen happens. But it's only because the heroine is a sympathetic character that her travails mean anything.",1069200000,,3956,4.70995670995671

J.Lo's very famous for remixing her songs now she's also popularly known for remixing her movies.  This is a movie that screams ""Been there done that!""  A simple movie that questions the intelligence of the viewer by having huge captions to let you in on the story line.
I didn't know whether or not to laugh at the bad acting or the exagerrated scenes.  Jennifer's acting abilities make this already bland and unimaginative movie fall short from praise.
It's a movie that many reviewers will say that it ""Empowers Women,"" but really imagine yourself as a woman if you will taking Krav Maga and beating up your husband eventually killing him without any legalities involved?

She shows an inner core of determination from which the character draws self respect and is stirred to action.  Juliette Lewis is good as the ""go girl"" cheerleader friend Ginny.  Noah Wylee is appropriately irritating as the friend of the wife beater who is a corrupt cop and searches out Slim.  Tessa Allen as the daughter is as cute as can be.  Judging Amy's Dan Futterman does a nice guy as Joe, Slim's old flame.  Fred Ward who played Earl Smooter in ""Sweet Home Alabama"" has a strong cameo as Jupiter.  Bill Campbell's bad guy Mitch is not so scary as obnoxious, which works for me as the film builds to the final showdown.  The subject of violence against women is one that pushes my button; so I reacted well to a film in which the woman fights back and wins.  If there were a criticism I might have, it is that most victims do not have a rich father like Jupiter to bankroll their escape.  The DVD version has no deleted scenes.  We see the music video of the title song where Jennifer Lopez appears to be writing the words which were actually written by Aimee Mann.  All in all, this is another great movie.

1758026,2,B00006HAWN,"Jennifer Lopez's latest film ""Enough"" is attacked by most critics as ridiculous and impossible.  At least, the opening 30 minutes of the film is not that ridiculous and impossible, following the life of waitress J-Lo's ""Slim"" who meets a rich, hunky guy in a diner where she works for, marries him, and has a lovely daughter.  So far, nothing is wrong with the movie.
But J-Lo and director Michael Apted, who possibly loves to depict strong women, should have known that when they deal with a delicate matter like domestic violence, they have to be extra-careful about the subject matter.  The issue is, as everyone knows, a very serious one.  When you know that, can you make a crowd-pleasing thriller out of it?  Maybe yes.  But even in that case, you cannot make the battered wife act the way ""Enough"" shows in the following 90 minutes.
I do not write down every detail of what Silm does after she realizes that her husband is no longer an amiable All-American guy, but a wife-beating brute, except this.  Slim knows there are such people as lawyers and the police, and possibly shelters; she has a best friend Juliette Lewis who listens to her, and is truely willing to help; she has plenty of money (how did she get it?  Don't ask me); but every step Slim takes is, I suppose, the worst (or most labored) one we can think of.  In short, she runs, runs, and runs.  The word ""manipulative"" is too weak here when the abusive husband has equally incredible power at hand to track down her, which easily matches that of FBI.  Especially when the husband is portrayed by miscast and hammy Billy Campbell.
I should not talk about the climax, which gives another incredible ride to this revenge story.

1758029,4,B00006HAWN,"I could say I've had 'Enough' of J. Lo - what, with all of the recent publicity revolving around how she can't keep a husband. Well, in this movie, she has a darn good reason to get rid of her husband: he's a cheater and an abuser. And not only that - he's a complete psycho too. I was hesitant to see this movie, mainly because it just looked uninteresting. Luckily, my friend rented it, so I got to see it for free. And you know what? It wasn't bad. Not at all. First, I will say I like J. Lo. She was great in films like Selena, Out of Sight, and The Cell. But after all the recent fluffy films she's been in (The Wedding Planner, Maid in Manhattan) I was a little weary about how she would handle a heavy dramatic role. She did fine. So did Billy Campbell, as her almost too-overly-evil husband. Juliette Lewis was good as her best friend, and Noah Wyle puts in a great, but small, performance as a character none of us are used to seeing him play (Dr. Carter would be disappointed). So the performances are good, as is the action, which for me was at times edge-of-your-seat. However, I will say that, despite the fact that it's good, it would have made a much better Lifetime: Television For Women made-for-Tv movie (they're always showing movies about women running from abusive/psychotic/maniacal men) as opposed to a film on the big screen. That's probably why it will do better on video and DVD than in the box office - stories like this were invented for the small screen.
So, 'Enough' is a pretty good film - especially towards the end when J. Lo decides SHE'S had enough, and decides to fight back. This will have every female who watches it cheering her on with such phrases as ""You go girl!"" and ""Kick his butt!"". All in all, it kept me entertained for a couple of hours, and that's more than enough for me.",1043366400,,1822,4.346041055718475
1758080,3,B00006HAWN,"Some actors and actresses out there can only deliver a good performance if they're given a particular type of material to work with. Some can only act well if the plot is good. Jennifer Lopez is an exception. This girl is a strong, strong actress who is very much believable in all her roles, even if they are crazy ones like the one she played out in ""Enough.""
If you have any idea of what might happen when a good husband turns bad and hits his wife and the wife flees with the child, then you'll probably have a pretty good idea of what to expect in this movie. I think the film tries hard to depict the struggles that a woman faces when she's got a child and her fairy-tale marriage turns deadly, but it's so ridiculous and off-the-wall at parts that it's just kind of funny, almost. For instance, what was with the scene where Mitch (the husband) shows up in their house? Ok, so Slim (Lopez) wakes up and all of a sudden, Mitch is just there. How did he get in? Through the open door? Did he break a window? Oh, wait, I forgot, it's Hollywood. You're not supposed to ask; you're just supposed to go with it.
The best and most commendable thing that Lopez's character did in this film was leave that maniac after he hit her once. Sadly, that's not how it always works in the real world when a spouse starts slapping them around, and somewhere in there was a good example from Lopez. This might be a fun movie if you like thrillers (despite all else, I will admit that it keeps you on the edge of your seat) and you need a Saturday night rental.

1758081,1,B00006HAWN,"Jennifer Lopez, in spite of what her detractors say, is capable of giving a good, skilled performance in a good movie. For those who don't believe me, look at her work in Steven Soderbergh's ""Out of Sight."" It was layered, funny, sexy, intelligent and daring. Since ""Out of Sight,"" though, Lopez has yet to make a movie as good or give a performance as good. Onscreen, even in a weak film, she can be charming, as she was in ""Maid in Manhattan"" or ""The Wedding Planner,"" or better than her script, as she was in ""Angel Eyes"" or ""The Cell.""
""Enough,"" though, is her worst performance and worst film. When I saw this in the theater, having read some bad reviews, I found I could only sit through half of it before deciding that I'd wasted enough of my time. It was awful, offensive, scary, implausible and badly written.
Lopez stars as Slim, a waitress swept off her feet by Mitch, a rich and charming man who always gets what he wants. Years into their marriage and long after the daughter they've conceived has grown into a precocious, annoying little movie child, Slim finds out just how far Mitch will go to get his way. Suddenly, though she's known him for years and never had a problem with him, his character turns from a prince into a psychotic, abusive monster. This happens in marriages, I know, but I doubt it happens this way.
Campbell plays Mitch as a looped, inhuman monster. His character isn't to be believed. Neither is Lopez's. Saddled with an undefined character with an unexplained first name, you never, ever feel anything for her.

Well there is a child involved and also Julia Roberts never wasted time learning to fight hand to hand, she was smart and blew him away. Thats about it. This film is very close, but not as good as SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY. I like Juliette Lewis (Lopez's devoted girlfriend in the film) but she's wasted in a thinkless role not worthy of her talent. The film might have been a little better if she took Jennifer Lopez's role on. Don't get me wrong I do think Jennifer Lopez is a fine actress.

1758142,2,B00006HAWN,"I've had quite enough of predictable ... like this.
As the movie begins we are introduced to a snotty waitress named Slim (Jennifer Lopez) who is in the process of being hit on when another man from a nearby table tells Slim that the man that she is flirting with made a ""bet"" with his friends on slim.
Now Slim has been rescued by this marlboro cowboy (Billy Campbell and a la! Within the first ten minutes of the movie they get married. Well everythings fine and dandy until Slim discovers one evening a few years later that her husband is cheating on her.
That was the first problem I had with the story.
What kind of a guy cheats on Jennifer Lopez? ... .
So when slim confronts her husband about this he ends up slapping her on the face. Idiot. So Slim finaly decides to pack up with her daughter and leave her husband. Ahhh but her husband really doesn't want her to go and let's just say that it's incredibly difficult for slim to finally leave. When she does she goes to her old boyfriend's house. While there so-called ""FBI"" agents knock on the door then basically ranshack the place looking for Slim and the daughter who are hidden safely. But that doesn't stop her mad husband from doing everything in his power to get slim back.
The second problem is that I couldn't understand why he wants her back so bad after he obviously didn't want her there in the first place.
That would end the movie though, we can't have that luxury.
Along the way we have waaaaaay to many coincidences that take place with bad guys spotting slim at just the right moment for them convienently. Eventually by the time J Lo has finally had enough, just about all the audience has too. We know by the commercial that she has to kick her husbands .. in the end. And of course, she does. What were you expecting? All throughout we have spectacularly bad performances from everybody including probably the worst child performance I've ever heard) but Jennifer Lopez who acts (amazingly) halfway believable.

1758144,3,B00006HAWN,"Michael Apted launched his career as a director with an imaginative and winning BBC documentary, ""42 Up"", a continuing account of how certain selected British youngsters of 7 have fared up to age 42 and still counting, updates occurring at seven year intervals.
The British director stakes out more commercial ground in ""Enough"" and therein lies the film's problem.  The commercialism designed to draw patrons blurs what could have been a better overall result with a subtle, more sophisticated story line.  Jennifer Lopez successfully demonstrated she has the emotion and range to handle roles beyond glamour and fluff.  In fact, early in the film her fellow waitress and sidekick, played by Juliette Lewis, exclaims, ""Let's face it, Slim.  You'll never get a guy on your looks.""  As the film's star, Lopez could surely have vetoed that line.  Its inclusion implies assent from a woman trying to make her mark as a dramatic performer.
The story's launching point is when Jennifer meets Bill Campbell, who becomes an immediate knight in shining armor when he puts a wise guy who has made a bet he can sleep with waitress Lopez in his place.  He tells the guy to take a powder and a grateful Lopez is happy to begin seeing him, after which they are married following a whirlwind courtship.  She thinks she has become Cinderella when she learns that he is a highly successful building contractor.  The former impoverished waitress soon becomes a yuppie suburban housewife with a lovely young daughter, having to pinch herself to see if it is all for real.
She soon learns that the relationship is not what it seems.  When she discovers that her husband is having an affair with a French woman who calls on the phone attempting to reach him, his other ogrish side is revealed.  He hits her hard, then coolly reveals he will hit her any time he pleases.
The relationship ends and Lopez strives to retain her child.  Campbell is used to having his way, at one point sending out a team of renegade FBI men to ""make a point"" after she goes to Seattle to live with an old flame, played by Dan Futterman.  The story escalates from that point as Lopez, knowing her ex is attempting to kill her, launches a counter assault after any and all legal avenues are foreclosed by the rich and wily Campbell.
This film makes some good points about the problems women face from abusive spouses, particularly how difficult it is for a woman to attain justice in the face of superior economic power in the hands of a husband.  The area where it could have been better is that Lopez plans to strike back physically, seeking revenge on Campbell's own turf, where he seeks to bully her.  As such ""Enough"" is somewhat reminiscent of Charles Bronson's big hits of the seventies when he struck back at street lawlessness as ""The Vigilante.""  Audiences would cheer approval in theaters as villains were dispatched, reminiscent of old movie serials.  Had this film pursued a more subtle approach, where a wily Lopez finds a way to strike back at Campbell within the system, ""Enough"" would have been a more imaginative and ultimately higher quality film.",1036627200,2,3123,4.775092936802974

1758148,3,B00006HAWN,"I enjoyed this film myself, but like other posters have said, it's a cliche movie. Still, I think Jennifer puts up a good performance as do the other actors considering their paper roles. The one bright light that stands out though throughout this entire movie is the young actress playing J-Lo's daughter. She really steals the scenes whenever she comes on screen. I was pretty much watching this movie for the training sequences as I'm more of a fighting film fan and enjoy those types of movies. However, I found the intro to Krav Maga a bit abrupt with its sudden appearance with practically no buildup. I was also hoping that it was Slim's former boyfriend who was going to be the trainer and not someone new who just popped up. I was also looking forward to see if he'd get into a fight with that jerk of an FBI agent who ruined his coach, but, alas, they let me down there.
  Anyways, the dvd does have both standard and widescreen formats on it. You choose which format you want to view before the selection menu pops up. The extra features are sparse if any. You only get J-lo's video and some filmographies. That's about it including some extra language tracks. No commentaries, no making of featurettes. A very spartan dvd if you ever saw one. Probably not worth the regular dvd price unless you're a J-Lo fan. I'd find a better lower price for this dvd.",1034380800,,1365,4.522267206477733

Here the character played by Jennifer Lopez marries into a life of privilege only to discover 'when it's too late' that her privilege has become her prison.
Saving herself and her daughter from the man she married, the movie plays out to a black leotard climax that is laughable.
Fortunately, and quite unlike Panic Room, not all the men were distilled to the state of limp amebas or classic neanderthals. However this cannot save the film. I like Jennifer Lopez. She is an intelligent and capable actor but this movie gives her nothing but stereotyped mush and ridiculous motivations to work with.
The film gets two stars but only because people tend not to read reviews with only one star. How many stars should it get? 0.",1034294400,10,862,4.753333333333333
1758182,5,B00006HAWN,"I am a fan of JLO , I never miss a new movie of hers, but this one left me wondering (?), after seeing the trailers. I realize now they were quite misleading and I pegged the film as a B rating. I had interpreted them as a typical ""Sleeping with the Enemy"" type of film. Husband beats wife, wife runs. Well, to a point that's the basic plot of ""Enough"".  On the otherhand, Jennifer Lopez as ""Slim"" gives us another advantage point. We see her fall and bleed, we see her run for her life, we see her reach her limit. What we also see is the humanity. (And yes, she makes the Julia Robert's character seem terribly useless in ""Sleeping with the Enemy"")It's not all cat and mouse.  The characters in this drama must play by the rules.  The law is not really on anybody's side.
Slim leaves her abusive husband with her daughter Gracie in tow and with help from friends old and new, lives a life on the run. It's not her daughter who's in danger, it's her. If she is found her husband (played by Billy Campbell)he will kill her.
So what to do? Go to the police?  He'll find her.  Go to a friend?  He'll find her.  She decides to use the rules her own way...she spends one month traing heavily with a martial arts instructor and decides to make the fight fair.
Jennifer Lopez does a fabulous job, as usual, of never playing herself.  She is Slim, the once submissive wife who wants to be happy.  Be we watch her become much more...a tough cookie who knows how to play a man's game.
I enjoyed this movie very much.  Lopez always surprises me with her characters.  Some scenes were very difficult to watch.  Many times heartfelt moments between Slim and Gracie were real tearjerkers.  I am not sure how a movie like this would translate into the real world, but on-screen it seems quite convincing.  My only problem with the movie...I wanted more from the ending.  It left me a little dry. Otherwise, I would say most would enjoy ""Enough"" as a great night's rent.

Such may be the case for Jennifer Lopez who, though a beautiful model and singer, never garners much acclaim for her talents in carrying a film.  Surely with ENOUGH that myth will be put to rest.  Though the story is an oft repeated type of avenger/revenger circle, Lopez manages to pull off this one as a sensitive mother, a product of an unhappy parenting, a woman afraid of commitment until making one nearly costs her life, and in all the aspects of this evolving character she shines. She is becoming a fine actress who deserves more notice. The supporting cast includes Juliette Lewis in a fine performance as her confidant/friend, Billy Campbell and Noah Wyle in uncharacteristic bad-guy roles, and others too numerous to mention.

Perhaps the best asset of this movie is popular exposure to the Israeli self-defense system of Krav Maga. Sadly, it is only touched upon in the story.

I sound like I'm gushing. Not so. When one stops to consider the current talent pool one realizes that there ain't much out there. Few leading women in Hollywood can carry a box office these days by herself.
Filmed, in part, in Seattle and the breath-taking Pacific Northwest, even the Michigan scenes were filmed in the NW; ""Enough"" is a story of a battered wife who has had enough. The premise of the plot is simple enough, abusive-obsessive husband stalks wife. She runs but has a few tricks up her sleeve. It's how she goes about getting even that was intriguing to me.

'Enough' also shows that actress Jennifer Lopez is more than just a pretty face. Here she demonstrated some of her athletic talents. And, yes, there are battered wives from all walks of life.

1758305,4,B00006HAWN,"What is quality entertainment? Oscar-worthy performances? Long, drawn-out storylines that make the movie last 2.5-3 hours long? Big bombs blowing up thirty cars in row? Sure, most of that is entertaining, but there's something else to be added to that list. Any movie with Jennifer Lopez. Some people - well, a lot of people - will laugh at the opinionated statement, but I thoroughly agree with it. I believe the lady can fulfill the shoes of any lead character and be great at it. And it's seen in her most recent movie, Enough.

 Enough is the story about Slim, who marries whom she thinks to be the most perfect man on earth. A couple of years into their relationship, she finds out she was wrong. He begins to beat her and threaten her, while having an affair which she knows about. After finally having ""enough"", Slim goes on the run with her daughter and the help of some friends.
 In addition to my first paragraph up there, I'm not saying that Enough doesn't have its flaws, because it does. First off, the acting. Lopez, Bill Campbell, Dan Futterman, and Noah Wyle were all great. But Juliette Lewis? I dunno, she just didn't seem to fit into the part. It took me a while to get into her character. I also keep seeing her in The Other Sister, so that didn't help me get into her character much either. I'm not stereotyping though. And the little girl who played Gracie, Slim's daughter, was too cute! She annoyed me at first, but after she began to become the humour part of the movie, she grew on me. Another flaw, I believe, were the subtitle like messages that appeared every now and then in the movie. In the beginning, I liked them. They foretold of the upcoming segment of the movie. But at the end, it's just like they disappeared. And oooo, the ending. The showdown between Slim and Mitch (Billy Campbell). The whole movie was worth the ending, which I actually found to be powerful, in relation that Slim actually got to pay back her terrorizing husband for all that he put her and her daughter through.
 Enough may be laughable to some, but I found it quiet entertaining and it never bored me. There were even big reactions to some of the things that happened onscreen by people who were in the theatre that I was in. If you're up for a power-chick flick with many surprises, catch Enough.",1022889600,2,2309,4.516746411483253

1758307,2,B00006HAWN,"If you saw ``Sleeping With the Enemy,'' you may have seen enough of ``Enough.''
The 1991 movie starred Julia Roberts as the wife of a wealthy, abusive husband who flees her palatial Los Angeles home, moves to a small town in the Midwest, and changes her name and her looks. And yet, he hunts her down and tries to kill her.
``Enough'' stars Jennifer Lopez as the wife of a wealthy, abusive husband who flees her palatial Los Angeles home, moves to a small town in the Midwest, and changes her name and her looks. He hunts her down and tries to kill her, too.
The main variable here is that Lopez's character, Slim, is a mother, and she grabs the couple's young daughter, Gracie (Tessa Allen), on her way out the door.
Say what you will about J.Lo -- that she can't sing, that she's ubiquitous. The woman has an undeniable presence. And watching her transform herself from pampered, betrayed housewife to one-woman wrecking machine makes ``Enough'' function on a visceral, you-go-girl level.
The third act -- in which she exacts her revenge with the elaborate skill of James Bond and the brute strength of Rocky Balboa -- is pretty ridiculous if you stop to think about it. But it's entertaining enough that it almost makes up for the inconsistencies in plot and character development that preceded it.
For a thriller, the movie begins more like a romantic comedy, with Slim and Mitch (Billy Campbell of ``Once and Again'') meeting cute at the diner where she's a waitress, and title cards like ``How they met'' and ``Conquering hero'' connecting their early stages.
In no time, they've fallen in love, gotten married, moved into a beautiful house together and had a baby. Mitch, a contractor, seems like the ideal husband, if a bit distant at times.
Then Slim discovers Mitch is having an affair, and when she confronts him, his personality changes completely. He becomes so cold-hearted and cruel so abruptly, it's difficult to accept -- almost comic.
The script from Nicholas Kazan explains his behavior with vague throwaway lines such as: ``I am and always will be a person who gets what he wants'' and ``If I can't have you, nobody else will.''
Slim cooks up a scheme to escape with the help of Ginny (Juliette Lewis), a waitress at the diner; Phil (Christopher Maher), who's a father figure in the absence of her real dad; and ex-boyfriend Joe (Dan Futterman), who provides refuge at his home in Seattle.
Michael Apted, who directed the most recent Bond movie, ``The World Is Not Enough,'' and another female empowerment movie, ``Coal Miner's Daughter,'' knows how to keep the pace moving during the action sequences. But the midsection of the film -- the cat-and-mouse chase, with its requisite cheap scares -- gets a bit repetitive.
The plot problems pop up as Slim and Gracie move from city to city. For a contractor, Mitch has the computer skills of a sophisticated hacker; he immediately freezes Slim's access to her cash and credit, and he tracks her moves effortlessly, with a squad of thugs in every city available to pounce on her and the little girl.
Mitch even has a police officer buddy at his disposal (``ER's'' Noah Wyle, like Campbell, playing against type) who tries to ram Slim's car from behind, even though Gracie is sitting in the back seat. Um, isn't he supposed to bring the girl back ... alive?
As if Gracie hasn't been through enough, Slim sends her away for a month to stay with Ginny and her two kids while she prepares for a showdown with Mitch. She learns Krav Maga -- a fighting form originally developed for women in the Israeli army -- and her eyeliner and lip gloss are perfect during every punch and kick.",1022803200,8,3643,4.7115987460815045
1758308,5,B00006HAWN,"Yes, I enjoyed this movie and I'm not embarrassed to say it. I know it's been getting some bad reviews, but I liked it. I do, however, see where some people are coming from when they say bad stuff about it. As much as I liked it, I do understand where some flaws were. Some of the acting was a little overdone (with the exception of Jennifer Lopez; she was strong and believable in her role) and the plot was not brand-new material, but it still has the potential to be a good movie. Another reviewer on here was talking about how this is a great film for women. I totally agree. Women don't always have to take a back seat to everything, and Jennifer Lopez's character really had something worthwhile to say. If you don't already know that the plot consists of, the movie is about Slim, a woman who marries Mitch, the typical ""no-good"" character who lures Slim into thinking he's perfect long enough for her to marry him and have a child with him. After the little girl is born, it all starts going down the tubes. Mitch starts showing what a scumbag he is, Slim tries to run with the daughter, but she is unable to find a route he won't follow. Finally, she decides to hand temporary care of her daughter over to a good friend while she takes martial arts classes and goes after Mitch for the sake of her own safety and the safety of the child. It's a pretty engaging plot that grabs your attention--sometimes it goes slowly and sometimes it starts rolling, but it REALLY picks up in the final scene. Hmm...considering this movie has not gotten all good reviews, I'm trying to figure out who would enjoy it...well, for starters, it is certainly  not a disappointment for Jennifer Lopez fans, so there's a group of people who would like it. You might also enjoy it if you like a blend of values and horror. Yes, this movie has both of those things. Not very many films do, but this one does. It's not a 100% thriller, which is why I liked it. I don't do well with many horror movies, but I liked seeing the sweet relationship between Slim and her young daughter. If any of this sounds like anything you would like, then by all means go and see it. I personally like that formula, so I loved it. If that's what you like too, then your opinion of the movie will probably be similar.",1022716800,3,2281,4.354460093896714
1758309,4,B00006HAWN,"Jennifer Lopez shows the world again what a great actress she really is. J-LO plays the role of ""Slim"", a waitress in a diner. After literally bumping into her husband  there she suddenly finds herself living in a mansion and eating shrimp scampi for dinner instead of the $1.99 chinese take-out she was used to. The marriage is great for the first couple of years. They have a baby and everyone seems happy. J-Lo plays the typical ""soccer mom"", running errands and making sure her husband has a warm meal waiting when he gets home from work. However, after a while things start spinning on J-Lo. She finds out her husband is cheating on her and is not ashamed to admit it. He says that ""guys have different needs than women."" This is when the movie takes off. J-Lo gets beat up by her husband and in a frantic scene takes the baby and herself out of the house. She then relocates to Seattle and assumes a different identity and look. Don't worry guys J-Lo still looks awesome! What follows next is true cinema magic. Frantic car chasing scenes,games of cat and mouse, and some good natured humor follow.

1758311,2,B00006HAWN,"**1/2 In typical Hollywood fashion, ""Enough"" takes a serious social issue - spousal abuse - and uses it as the pretext for a run-of-the-mill damsel-in-distress thriller.  However, in keeping with our post-modern, feminist sensibilities, this heroine, is, as it turns out, as mad as hell and decides she's not going to take it anymore.  She is no passive victim of her circumstances like her earlier imperiled movie ingnue sisters, but rather a gutsy fighter who takes a proactive role in determining her own fate and the fate of her daughter.  Jennifer Lopez plays ""Slim,"" a woman who starts out looking for a man who will ""protect"" her, but who, after she finds one (the wrong one), winds up kicking that slimy-assed dude's butt all around his swank, multimillion-dollar Marina home before she's through with him.
Your enjoyment of this film will be pretty much predicated on how willing you are to overlook the predictability and implausibility of much of the plotting.  The film starts off well with an impressive twist involving Slim's initial meeting with the man, Mitch, who will quickly become both her husband and her stalker.  Yet, Mitch's conversion from doting lover to psychotic wife abuser is so abrupt and so poorly presaged by any actions or statements on his part that we are forced to question the credibility of pretty much everything else that follows.  Moreover, for a woman-on-the-run who is supposedly so adept at eluding her pursuer, Slim makes some pretty monumental blunders all the way through the story.  Particularly inexplicable is her decision to allow her little daughter to phone Mitch, an action that leads him and his goons in no time at all to the upper Michigan community where the two of them have been hitherto successfully hiding.  I also wonder why characters in movies, after they have knocked the villain senseless and he lies bleeding on the floor, always seem to turn their backs on him, even though we, in the audience, know full well that he will miraculously arise, Phoenix-like, from the ashes, to continue his murderous assault.  The heroine in ""Wait Until Dark"" at least had her blindness as justification for her doing that.  What is Slim's excuse?  (By the way, don't any of these characters ever go to the movies?  If they did, they would eliminate most, if not all, of their lapses into stupidity).
However, given its many flaws, ""Enough"" turns out to be pretty effective entertainment within the prescribed limits of its genre.  Although she still isn't much of an actress, Jennifer Lopez manages to elicit the audience's empathy thanks primarily to the aura of immense likeability she exudes.  In fact, it's hard not to end up rooting for a character caught up in the type of worm-turning vengeance we have going on here.  Director Michael Apted knows how to direct a suspense scene for maximum effectiveness, and cinematographer Rogier Stoffers has done a beautiful job capturing the multi-colored splendors of the film's many and varied locations.  The attractive look of the film is alone worth the price of admission.",1022457600,4,3077,4.98046875
