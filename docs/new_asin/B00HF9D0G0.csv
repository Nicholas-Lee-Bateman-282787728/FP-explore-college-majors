6161372,2,B00HF9D0G0,"I agree with Ms. Deborah Wilbanks' review of the Mystify DVD as a sad event to watch. Not only Michael Hutchence but the other INXS band members seem to have taken this concert with the seriousness of a loose dress rehearsal. The band is either suffering from burnt-out or the jaded indifference some artists have when they have done one concert too many. The overall performance is quite under par when compared to the evident passionate energy and musical precision of the Wembley stadium concert as well as other live events of the band's heyday. The arrangements of many of their now-classic hits were changed for this concert (for instance, the synthesizers were toned down considerably), and most of the resultant versions lack the ""kick"" of the original tunes.

And I guess Michael's erratic stage antics was no source of inspiration for his other band mates. In all my years of attending rock concerts (including one with INXS in  the mid-nineties), and watching scores of concert DVDs, I have never seen a major rock star--no matter how spaced out--take a joint and smoke it and flaunt about it in front of a remarkably well-behaved audience as Michael sadly does in this DVD. He was definitely one of the most visually exciting performers to watch live, and remnants of Michael's body-language charisma are still evident in this Rockpalast performance, but sadly the effects of either the pressures of rock super-stardom, or too much of the devil inside, or substance abuse, or the lure of a witchy woman--or all of the above--make this concert a sorry showcase of why Michael became ""Suicide Blind.""

I would refer potential buyer interested in seeing INXs in better days to purchase either the Wembley concert DVD or I'm Only Looking (The Best of) DVD.",1289433600,7,1764,4.912751677852349
6161373,2,B00HF9D0G0,"All,, i can say, after watching this video, is it left me brokenhearted.  To watch such a superstar as Michael, literaly on the road to ruin was sad.  His voice was shakey, his antics on stage were awful...it was like he didn't care or didn't know where he was.  Sure, in the past he got crazy, but this was just very uncomfortable to watch..the audio was terrible and sometimes it sounded like a jumbled mess.  Michael was a beautiful and very talented man being chased by too many deamons, including that witch Paula.  I don't think  i can re-watch this concert like i do Live Baby Live, its to painful.  Im not comparing this DVD to just Live Baby Live, ive seen many concerts by INXS over the years and this was just wrong.........",1288828800,5,735,4.440298507462686
6161374,5,B00HF9D0G0,"Videos showing up years later are often of poor quality&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Live-Germany-1984/dp/B002VKE0WG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Live- Germany 1984</a>as there is a reason they usually don't see the light of day in their time. After being suckered into the previously noted INXS DVD from 1984 I picked this up with a fair amount of skepticism.

I'm a fan of the group but not a groupie so I can't make tremendous comparisons to different eras of the group etc etc....but I really like what I see on this DVD.  The set opens with the title track for their final CD with Michael Hutchence ""Elegantly Wasted"" so I am assuming  its close to the final concert film we will see and the group is rocking really hard. This incarnation features a couple of very easy on the eyes back  up vocalists in short INXS T-shirts and the band are in their most flamboyant dress..from facial hair to cowboy hats and sunglasses.  The German crowd  are  supportive and its a very energetic show.  The thing I liked about INXS is that they rocked hard but always had great grooves...

The only drawback is the relatively short duration of the concert which is an hour and twenty minutes (but it was a tv concert so I understand). The production values are typically first rate as German and Japanese television usually is.  The bonus tracks are from the previously noted 1984 concert but unlike that terrible DVD these 7 tracks which clock in at 24 minutes look broadcast ready! The 1984 set is a fitting bookend to the main show from 1997....and only months before Michael Hutchence passed away.

I recommend this to INXS fans...after  you buy the other excellent DVDs&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-m-Only-Looking-The-Best-of-INXS/dp/B000286SCE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I'm Only Looking - The Best of INXS</a>and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/INXS-Live-Baby-Live/dp/B0000CDL7N/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">INXS - Live Baby Live</a>&nbsp;which is their ultimate live show.",1288656000,27,2103,5.881578947368421

6161381,4,B00HF9D0G0,"Great concert, good set list, very intimate and just months before Michael Hutchence's death in 1997. Definitely one for every INXS fan out there. Hutchence sure knew how to work an audience and this show confirms this.
The only flaw of this DVD was the directing and mixing of the sound. They seemed to focus way too much on the 2 back up singers which seemed to get as much screen time as the band themselves and there were constant shots of them. There were also many shots of the cameras and camera crew who seem to be in the way frequently.
The mixing of the sound was pretty bad as well with the backup singers louder than Michael Hutchence on some songs which I found very annoying as they were drowning him out.
On the whole enjoyable to watch this concert by one of the best rock bands and charismatic lead singers of all time.",1411516800,2,836,4.365384615384615

6161390,5,B00HF9D0G0,"They were back after 4 years in 1997 with Elegantly Wasted, some promo shows and concerts like this one were played trough 1997 until the death of Michael, this one in special, its an amazing show, Michael Hutchence and Co. played as always, connected and fresh; Michael sings like a god, passionated and making jokes with the members and the audience. After many years of speculation about the suicide of a ""decadent and tortured"" Michael Hutchence, this DVD shows the truth, a man that always love it the music and life, if you like it ""Live baby live"", this one it will don't dissapoint it to you.

INXS its the best!!!",1320624000,4,622,4.603603603603603

6161392,4,B00HF9D0G0,"First, this concert has been available as a boot for several years.  It was actually a very good quality boot, this release improves the quality as it is obviously taken directly from the master tapes.  As a festival type it isn't quite the length of a meant for release INXS concert, it's still quite generous and due to the time limit it is quite tight on ""all killer and no filler"" type programming.  The audio is clear and crisp, the video crystal clear 4:3 aspect ratio...So. basically, it is just a small bit under the regular filmed for DVD release type concert production values.  That makes it slightly raw and I'm not just talking about the look and sound, but also the performance.  I don't think there is any post-production correction or sweetening.  I think no one will miss the usual manic edits where the cameras are cut every two seconds, this is much better for relaxed viewing.

This video is a great peek at later day INXS.  They played with authority and even if the aren't trying to prove anything I would still call this a very good performance if loose.  In fact it is the looseness and rawness that I feel is much more revealing and interesting than a highly produced performance.  It's a bit dangerous and Hutch is a bit ""out-of-control"" in a very Jim Morrison way.  Wow, you can actually see it and feel it. This is heady stuff, and I say this knowing a few others have called it sad and pathetic.  I do see his taking his life as sad, but not this slow-burning impassioned performance.  INXS rocks here.  I sense a bit of angst mixed in with the aforementioned ""out-of-control"" thing.  It powers the performance as I see it, though I understand some may be put off - not this viewer, I see through to the self-tortured artist doing what frees him a bit from all the other stuff.

The added bonus tracks are absolutely the right edit from the many years earlier first time INXS appeared in a Rockpalast concert.  That show has been available in boots too, the quality here is like ""night & day"" higher in quality than that boot with even better sound...this is a great bonus and I can't overstate that they edited down to the best tracks which makes it quantum leaps more watchable.

I'm giving this four stars because the performance warrants it even with ever so slightly less production values than the usual commercial concert DVD.  It is the antithesis of the way too over-produced DVD concerts bands such as the Eagles put out.  The rawness spells dangerous energy in my opinion and if you think you'd like to see INXS this way then I highly recommend you buy this, a video document of a great band turning in a very good performance on the edge of the abyss that came just months in the future.",1299715200,9,2728,4.517311608961304
6161393,1,B00HF9D0G0,"I sent this as a comment to Deborah Wilbanks, but thought others should see before they buy this DVD:

I have to agree 100% with Deborah Wilbanks' review and am giving it one less star than she did. It is so sad and uncomfortable to watch. It brought me to tears and I cannot believe the band agreed to put this out. Some of the numbers are gut-wrenchingly soulful (i.e. Searching) and one can see that Michael Hutchence was pouring everything he had into them. Many of the songs in ""Elegantly Wasted"" tell what MH was going through/feeling at that time in his life. The live performances of some these songs are amazing but that is secondary -- at this concert the man's pain and sadness is palpable and the thing that stands out the most. And maybe that is most gut-wrenching of all -- watching the train wreck happen and knowing what was to come just a mere five months later.  I cannot understand how his band-mates could have mistaken this for the same old, same old MH high on drugs & booze.

If you want to see live performances of the ""Elegantly Wasted"" album go to youtube and watch the Aspen 1997 concert, the extraordinary performance of ""Searching"" in Sept 1996 at the ARIA awards.

RIP MH. The 'Mystify' DVD should not have been put out there, you deserved better.",1299628800,7,1277,4.491379310344827
