Most times I do (2)of the 10 minutes, according to how much time I have but overall this tape really gets the blood going, for sure!!",1337040000,,244,4.304347826086956
4989374,4,B006HFXDZG,"I took one star off because of sound and editing problems but  for the most part these are great 10 minute workouts.  I use these to add a  little cardio when I just feel I need it.
I was looking for little 10 minute workouts to add to my Beachbody P90 series and I didn't want to pay $80 for the Beachbody ones.  These are perfect.  I can add a little cardio to my sculpt days or add a little cardio to my evenings to get a boost.  Way better than a cup of coffee.  I liked these enough to check out all of Billy Blanks DVD's, not so good.
I chose not to buy anymore of his stuff.  This is a good one but the rest of them are terrible.  You can borrow them from you local library or order them on Netflix to review before you actually buy.  I didn't find any and I have to agree with all the negative reviews on those DVD's.

Addendum: This is a review of Billy Blanks Dvd's. I stand by my review. His live classes are great if you live in Los Angeles. These Dvd's need to re-edited unless you can handle working out with lots of gaps, stops and only working your right side sometimes or only your left another time.",1336435200,4,1117,4.009049773755656
4989375,4,B006HFXDZG,Eight great Tae Bo workouts for when you do not have a lot of time.  10 to 15 minutes each workout and there are just as effective as his other recent Tae Bo and Boot Camp workouts.  Billy Blanks shines again!,1335830400,2,209,4.073170731707317

4989377,5,B006HFXDZG,"I realy love all my DVDs from Billy Blanks. This DVD is amazing. 8 different workouts  10 minutes. You can mix and match your own workout. Or just do only one when the tine is tight. Love the Bootcamp Power and the Power Punsh workout.
If you don't have time for an hour workout, this your DVD. Try this and give yourself and Billy a chance.
Five stars for this great DVD.
Thanks Mr. Blanks.",1333843200,2,391,4.213333333333333
4989378,2,B006HFXDZG,I have been a avid follower of Billy Blanks since his first DVD and this one was not worth the time or money since there is no warm up and breaking up to 10 minute segments doesn't work! Too busy with playing with the remote control to get into a flow.,1333497600,7,252,3.9607843137254903
4989379,5,B006HFXDZG,"Tae Bo Express is awesome. Eight different and challenging work outs that you can mix however you want. Billy Blanks is a really motivating and inspiring person, and I like the fact that the people on this dvd are normal looking and some even make mistakes too, which in most other workout dvds the people are annoyingly perfect and too ""smiley."" This dvd is perfect because it is hard to become bored with since you can mix up the routines. A good investment if you love Tae Bo workouts!",1332547200,4,488,4.49438202247191
4989380,5,B006HFXDZG,My mom and I have been doing Tae Bo for about a year now (we both LOVE it.) This makes a great addition to my collection of Tae Bo dvds. It is as described 8 approximately 10 minute work outs. Since it is broken into 8 videos it is very versatile. You can arrange them in the order you want to do them and make your work out longer or shorter. It is also a great way for beginners to start since it features work outs such as fast footwork. All of the work outs were well paced and choreographed. As always a great work out thank you Mr. Blanks!,1331164800,8,545,3.963636363636364

Some are gentle (like the warm up), and others more intense. Either way, they are effective and fun. You can select which one you want to start with, and you can also mix and match the workouts, as well. I love the energy of Billy Blanks and the workouts are very easy to follow.

4989417,5,B006HFXDZG,I love Taebo and I love Billy Blanks.  I have to admit that Billy can be cheesy at times and he often looses count but his heart is in everything that he does.  I own several taebo dvds but the reason why I love this one is the fact that it is easy and you can get a workout in quick.  I was diagnosed with FMS a few years ago and find it hard to work out sometimes but anyone can do 8 minutes.  There is even I chair workout so you don't have to stand.

Just doing 3 10-minute workouts every day , i saw the inches slowly melting off my waist. My mother has being doing Billy Blanks Tae Bo as well and she loves it.

4989435,3,B006HFXDZG,You will definitely get a good workout with this DVD I mean I love Billy Blanks only problem is he doesn't seem to take in to consideration that some people may be on the heavier side or beginners and he doesn't offer moderations to certain exercises that are hard to do for these reasons. I would say get this DVD but expect not to be able to do all of it until you are somewhat use to it but please don't give up.,1463529600,9,415,4.0120481927710845

4989441,5,B006HFXDZG,"I was an avid Tae Bo workout girl about 12 years ago.  As things go, I drifted away from it.  Looking for some workout motivation I returned to Billy and found this DVD along with a few others on Amazon.  I am soooo glad I did! It soon came back to me how much I loved doing these workouts at home.  This DVD Tae Bo Express is my favorite so far.  With each session 10 minutes, there is no excuse not to get a workout in.  If I am running short on time I can do one, if I have more time I can stack 3 or 4 together and can mix them up.  I would say I am an average as far as athletic ability and some of the balance and footwork get me (making me glad I am doing it at home, by myself)  but I think this is a great DVD for a beginner or intermediate workout enthusiast.",1455148800,4,769,3.732919254658385
4989442,3,B006HFXDZG,"I love (really love!) Billy Blanks, and Shellie, his amazing, award-winning daughter to whom he's passed the torch. The original Taebo was fantastic, motivating, inspiring, and happy-making... even while he was kicking your butt with super-intense, sweat-inducing workouts.

I wanted this DVD set to be like that. I looked at the reviews before ordering. People gave it great ratings and had pretty positive things to say. I wonder if that's their own love for Taebo or Billy Blanks talking. We've already done two workouts (Fast Footwork and Bootcamp), and it's pretty disappointing.

** There is NO WARMUP OR STRETCH at all. This is a major problem. In his original 8-minute workout, there was at least a cooldown, though things did get pretty intense pretty quickly. With these, you just launch off into the workout.

** There is NO REAL CUEING. Even his workout team is confused by what he's about to do next, and when he changes moves. Everyone stops for a second or three to catch up to what he's doing now. He'll *tell* you what comes next, but he won't necessarily do it exactly on beat. That's not the hugest deal breaker, but half the time, no one understands what the move he's describing *means* ... so you have to wait until he does it, and then follow suit. But you miss a few beats when you do. It doesn't seem rehearsed.

** There aren't any modifications. Your joints have to be in GREAT SHAPE to do this, and you should have NO INJURIES (or limbs that you favor). If you do, you'll likely hurt yourself as you try to keep up.

** There's no explanation of what the workouts are. Obviously that's not a big deal with the ab ones, legs, etc... even bootcamp is pretty self explanatory. But fast footwork seemed like something other than it necessarily was. (It's basically him ""teaching you"" how to move your feet *while* doing upper body stuff, like jabs, speedbag, etc. I say ""teaching"" because you only end up understanding via trial and error, not because he explains in any way how to position yourself. (My BF was flailing in very different ways than Billy was demonstrating... because he was going so fast.)

It would be much improved if there were perhaps a 2-minute ""instructional"" added to the beginning of all the workouts, to cover all the moves they'll be doing. Then the option to play with or without instructional. Or a separate instructional workout, which covers moves from each workout.

I ended up still giving this three stars because it does give you a workout... just a very disorganized one. My boyfriend seems to be okay with it (thankfully, as I got this for his birthday). Me, I'll stick with the impeccable Cathe Friedrich for cardio with flawless cueing.

Side note, I did see a new workout of Mr. Blanks' on YouTube, wherein all of his team members were in sync, organized, and less frantic. (Billy Blanks Tae Bo Advanced Next Generation Workout) It looks FANTASTIC, well cued, and soooo much fun! We'll try that one to see if we want to investigate further. I love Billy Blanks. I love short workouts (that allow me to build my own, and ward off workout boredom!). I don't love this DVD set.",1454889600,4,3138,4.682395644283122

4989497,2,B006HFXDZG,"I agree with the other one- and two-star postings.  Like another reviewer, I had the old-school VHS tapes back in the day and picked up this DVD to get back into it. It would seem, from the other reviewers, that the DVD titles are out of order. There is no warm-up or cool-down (those would have been nice ""chapters"" to have as an add-on).

More to the point, Billy Blanks seems disjointed, out of whack, and not sure about what he wants to do next. It's like they recorded the first-take of everyone working together and had no practice. The people working out in the video don't know what's coming next; his daughter, Shelley, often is so beat by the workout she just walks around to get the feeling back in her legs.  Blanks doesn't do a good job at all of telling anyone what he wants them to be doing, so you waste precious repetitions just figuring out what he wanted. You also need to be somewhat fit or very forgiving of yourself mentally. I'm chubby and physically this is hard to do and nearly impossible to feel successful at the first few times you do it.",1421193600,,1067,4.378787878787879

I especially enjoy the selection of short workouts that focus on key areas and will usually pick two as a good 20 minute warmup prior to doing a workout with weights and floor work. Some of the lower body workouts leave the arms not doing much, so I add arm punches to add to it. The only problem I've had with most of the workouts thoughout the years is that when he goes into 'fast' mode, the moves are too fast to execute correctly or safely, so I slow it down just a bit in order to do the full range of the movement (and not lose my balance ( :  ).

Finally one day in a angry huff I threw my scale outside in the rain...hoping it would die a painful death for causing me so much pain and feelings of failure every time I stepped on it. So I started doing this video almost every other day. I always  do 3 10 minute workouts.  Its so easy because you tell yourself I only need to make it 10 minutes! And when the 10 minutes are done you feel so good you want to do anther 10 minute work out. In the last few weeks SEVERAL...I mean SEVERAL people have been asking me if I have lost weight. Of course I don't know since my scale is water logged somewhere in my back yard, but it feels great to be asked that question again after all these years!

4989531,4,B006HFXDZG,This workout is great. Especially if you don't have time and can only do a short 10 or 20 minute workout. My only complaint is that Billy tends to rush from one exercise to the next with little to no explanation on exactly how to perform the moves. I'm sure after watching this dvd once or twice more it will become easier. I recommend maybe watching the workout before you attempt doing it because it goes so quickly. I like the workout a lot though. I would recommend this to anyone looking to get into better shape.,1391731200,,518,4.350515463917525

i like that you can tailor it to be as long as you have time for.  i either do one workout or two back to back, depending on the workout.  some are harder than others.  in fact, in a couple of them, i have to take a breather in the middle.

another advantage to me is that not much floor space is needed, which is good because i have a limited area to work in.

it's true that the workouts are not in order on the dvd menu, but once you get that (from one of the other reviews here), you're good to go.

Some of the moves are so ridiculous they are hilarious like ""the Superman"" punch move. You have to see it to believe it. The best part is how some of the cast even look at him as if to say, ""WTF, Billy?"" I found myself declaring ""surely he pulled that one out of his a**"" on more than one occasion.

4989557,5,B006HFXDZG,I truly love TaeBo it really makes me sweat. This dvd is great because you can choose which ever 10 minute exercise you prefer. You do not have to do the same routine everyday. I love that because my kids seem to wake up 10 to 15 minutes after I start my exercise and do not let me continue. So the fact that any routine that I choose from this dvd will finish in 10 minutes is a great accomplishment for me. I begin my day with a sweat and have enough energy to keep up with the kids.,1363219200,5,485,3.909090909090909
4989558,3,B006HFXDZG,"I have quite a few exercise DVDs, including three or four Tae Bo.  I chose to purchase this one because unlike the others that are close to an hour, this one is broken down into multiple ten minute workouts.  It's perfect for days when I lift weights and need a little cardio to get me warmed up.  (Or days when I just don't have an hour to workout.)

The only thing I do not like about this DVD is the drama going on in the background with his workout team.

Since I own a few of Billy's DVDs, I am used to the constant ""eight count"" going on through the workout.  It was annoying at first, but once you do one of the hour-long workouts, it's easier to ignore.

I have also come to accept Billy's daughter, Shellie, yelling out things and ""whooping"".  She doesn't annoy me like she does some people.  (In fact, I wish I had her energy.)

On this DVD, though, she spends a lot of time wincing.  Perhaps she filmed this right after a twelve-hour workout.  Maybe she's injured.  I think she may be ""acting"" a little.  Either way, it gets distracting quickly.

Look, I am far from being fit.  In fact, I am currently about halfway through a 100 pound weight loss.  (So, I guess you could say I'm almost the exact opposite of fit.)  And while Tae Bo is a lot more than a leisurely stroll in the park, it's not that brutal.  Even at my highest weight I don't think it has made me wince.  (Sweat?  Yes!  Feel muscles you didn't know you had?  Absolutely!)

Once again, I'm giving her the benefit of the doubt that she may be injured or something.  But if you can get past that, you will get eight fantastic workouts with this DVD.",1363132800,,1624,4.245901639344262

This is a cheap video.  The people look tired in the video and the even Shelly doesn't seem to be as energized.  No one knew what Billy was doing even the people in the video.  It is so no taebo like for part of the videos.  It was like he ran out of money, made this video with people who half heartedly were doing the moves.  The people looked tired is all I can say.  This was a waste of money.  For a real taebo video check out the ultimate taebo.  Billy has got to do better in the future if he wants to keep his following.

4989563,5,B006HFXDZG,"Wow. All I have to say is wow. I bought this DVD on a whim because I've been thinking about finding ways to workout in the privacy of my living room. I have done Tae Bo workouts before, and was a fan for a while in the late 90's/early 2000's, but somewhere along the line, the workouts, in my opinion, got boring, monotonous, and some were even quite awkward. However, with my recent schedule of returning to work, full-time classes AND being a mom to a 3-year-old, I was having trouble finding the time to make it to my regular kickboxing gym that I have been attending for the past 2 years, so I decided to give Tae Bo a try once again. Let me say that I began my kickboxing classes a year after having my daughter to lose the extra weight and get back in shape. The classes are hour-long cardio-intense sweat sessions--and this little DVD has given me faster and better results than those classes ever did. AMAZING. Recently, after going shopping for new jeans, I found that I was a size down. This was a (pleasant) surprise because I have not been as strict as I should be with my eating lately. The only thing I have done different is add 4 segments of this DVD in the evening 5-6 nights a week (I combine it with 20 minutes of yoga or pilates to get a full hour workout, complete with stretch) to my evening routine. It seriously is THAT good. I was trying to think about why this DVD has given me better results than my 50 bucks a month kickboxing membership, and the only thing I can think of is the fact that for 10 minutes, you're focusing on one muscle group so you really hone in on them. I haven't been able to feel hardness in my abs in years, and I actually am starting to get definition in them. It's crazy. The workouts may be challenging for some, but I think a DVD workout has to be. I love knowing that I'm working towards achieving something; it keeps it from getting boring. I will say that I added 1-lb. Tae Bo weights (that came with another DVD set years ago) to the arm segments. I wouldn't recommend doing this unless you know what you're doing and know how to modify the exercises so as to avoid injury. We occasionally use 1-2 lb. handweights at my gym with our shadowboxing, so it is hard for me to feel any burn without them. Another plus that some may want to consider is the fact that the workout is not a dreaded task because it is actually enjoyable. You can switch up the segments any way you like, AND you only have to get through 10 minutes at a time. This makes the 40 min.-hour go by so quick--it really is a great way to do workout DVD's. Oh, and the best part is, I don't have to be out of the house an extra hour and a half every night to go to the gym and workout. I can do this with my daughter sitting in the room with me. She loves to sit on the couch and watch ""Mommy do her kicks."" :) Very stoked with this purchase. :)",1359763200,27,2868,4.160071942446043

4989567,4,B006HFXDZG,"I used to go to the gym at least 4 days a week for Zumba, Step aerobics, boot camp and 30 minutes on the elliptical.  A little over a year ago I moved to a neighborhood and didn't like atmosphere of the local gym in the same franchise.  I decided to get a Zumba DVD - horrible idea.  I had done Taebo years ago (and still had a VHS with no VCR!), but was reluctant to pick up any DVDs.  I thought it would be outdated since I had moved on in my own regime.  I was wrong!  After one workout, I woke up the next day feeling sore in my abs, arms and back.

Out picking up electronics around Christmas, I walked by this DVD.  It caught my eye and the low price convinced me to purchase it.  In ten minutes I was sweating as much as after 30 minutes on the elliptical.  The DVD, however, isn't for beginners, IMO.  I love that the workouts are broken into 10 minute increments so you can mix and match your workout.  To Blanks' credit, he acknowledges that you can't get a full workout in 10 minutes.  What I don't like is that the segments are out of order; the warmup is actually chapter 3.  The segments themselves also don't have enough warm up and cool down activities in them, so unless you know how to do that on your own you would want to tailor your workout to include something like the following:

the first 5 minutes (at least) of ""Fast Footwork"" to warm up
2-3 other segments
the first 5 minutes of ""Fast Footwork"" to cool down

Anyone can do these, even if you have to pause the video to catch your breath and grab some water!",1352073600,29,442,4.091954022988506
4989575,5,B006HFXDZG,"This is an excellent addition to the collection. I sometimes will do one of these after a longer workout, or, I will do 3-5 of them as is to create my own workout. The abs workout is great. Not too intense to scare you, yet certainly an abs builder. The kicking one covers about everything. The arms workout is good. Combo is a good warmup. The power is insane. It will push you. But by far the best part is the punch and knee. It's 10 minutes that's both fun, challenging, and rewarding. I don't think you'll be sorry about getting this one.",1351123200,,542,4.271844660194175

4989577,5,B006HFXDZG,"I love Billy Blanks Boot Camp DVDs but because I exercise in the morning before work, I wish they were a little shorter due to a time crunch. This DVD packs a HUGE workout into ten short minutes. I usually do 2, maybe 3 of them depending on which they are. The best ones are the Tae Bo Abs and the Isolation Training. A lot of my workout DVDs only touch on abs for a few minutes so I like that I could dedicate ten minutes to them. The Isolation Training was challenging so I liked how great I felt afterwards. Some of the other ten minute segments I'm not a huge fan of - the Fast Footwork, the Power Punch... they're OK. But overall I recommend this DVD to anyone. It's a great workout that you can customize and switch up - I love it!",1346284800,7,737,4.054794520547945
4989578,4,B006HFXDZG,"I think the whole ""10 minute workout"" thing must be a fad because all of a sudden I am seeing them everywhere. The problem is, the workouts just aren't worthwhile ten minutes. This one is. There are days when I don't have the time for a full fledged work out, but I want to do something. This is great for those days. I feel like I got my blood moving and worked my muscles a bit. I feel like the effort isn't wasted. I really like this much better than some of the dance or Pilates ones I have. Be warned though. BB either has no rhythm or he's easily thrown off track. He sometimes changes moves in between sets which can make it hard to follow in places.

If you haven't tried any Billy Blanks DVDs, get this one first. It walks you through the basic movements and can help you keep up when he goes full blast. The others don't have much breakdown and don't move too slowly.",1346025600,,877,4.158823529411765
4989579,5,B006HFXDZG,"I brought this from walmart while shopping because i remember as a child my mom was in love with billy blanks dvds so i said what the hell let me buy it. I really like it but it is way too difficult for my level of fitness. I still give it a try every now and then but I have to graduate to this workout level. I have been doing  Shaun T's  hip hop ABS workout and I love it, so once my body tolerance start evolving to a new fitness level I will do this tae bo more often. Its difficult but I do like the tae bo overall. :-)",1345593600,,525,3.720720720720721

4989581,4,B006HFXDZG,"I gave this four stars because there is nothing in stretching, but if you want to mix it and really sweat this is a great DVD. Billy is so encouraging and I love the fact that he doesn't scream at you. Just think, this guy is in his 50's and is living proof his method works. He does the talk and the walk.",1342915200,2,306,3.873015873015873
4989582,4,B006HFXDZG,"I agree with several viewers that some of these excercises move way too fast for proper form-I really love the dvd but with the Power Punches when he does the punches really fast,its easy to throw out your shoulder or back-I found that out the hard way with a herniated disc in my neck. I really do enjoy the workouts though-it is my go to dvd on the days when I just can't get motivated-Billys energy just gets me moving. I still plan to use this dvd-just not speed up the excercises like he does",1341705600,,497,4.242105263157895
