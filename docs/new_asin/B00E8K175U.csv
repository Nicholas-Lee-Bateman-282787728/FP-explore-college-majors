8602552,3,B00E8K175U,It's a time capsule of the humor of my youth. It explained to my kids why I make such lame jokes. It is a good look at live TV from the era and the cheap budgets that made for cheap TV.,1411257600,,185,3.5365853658536586

8602554,5,B00E8K175U,"Soupy is definitely a performer that inspires great affection in some ... and leaves other completely cold. Many people claim he was at his best in his earliest Detroit shows, which are not represented here. This may be true but I say any Soupy is better than none. Soupy's program was not the sort of thing stations strove to preserve. It was a daily, off the cuff foray into ad-libbed, quickly written schtick and old comic bits. That makes it less than classic much of the time but it is also it's real charm. Soup and his buddies had a great ability to fly by the seat of their pants and put just the right spin on a goofy line. Like it or hate it, there is really nothing like it in TV today and it is certainly worth a try if you've never seen him ... especially the older Black and White shows in volume one. For my money, Soupy is just hilarious and I would love to see every possible surviving show made available.
This is a ""DVD-R, made on demand product"" and perhaps this is the best way to preserve shows that are not deemed highly profitable by DVD producers. I say bring them on. DVD-R works for me ... lets have more Soupy and let's do the same for other old shows from early TV that aren't seeing the light of day.",1403481600,4,1230,4.216101694915254
8602555,5,B00E8K175U,"Well, volume #1 in B&W, circa mid-60's, contains Soupy's usual complement of corny comedy, and well worth the price of admission; As for volume #2, that's a late 70's Soupy revival, in color, that you should also find amusing. All-in-all, I thought the two-volume set was well worth both my time and money!",1400371200,,306,4.7924528301886795
8602556,1,B00E8K175U,"This was the biggest disappointment ever.  I watched Soupy as a little girl, and was very happy to finally be able to see him again.  But these two volumes were awful.  Nothing at all funny.  Quite sad in fact.",1396742400,,210,4.3076923076923075
8602557,5,B00E8K175U,What can I say my husband and I grew up watching soupy  when we got the DVDs we opened and watched all of them still laughing we love them thank you,1394928000,,148,3.774193548387097
8602558,3,B00E8K175U,"These are all New York shows in B&W, so there is no Clyde Adler, who I personally liked far more than Frank Nastasi.  Still, as
a fan of Soupy, there were some good moments.",1386028800,2,173,4.088235294117647
