8564643,1,B001AXZL1E,"I have watched this DVD  three or four times trying to find something redeeming in this opera.  I have read the published reviews of this product, and I disagree with these reviews. The AMS is very comprehensive and well written.  The most redeeming portion of this DVD was the interview with Andrew Wiles.  To say the least, it is very difficult to write a musical fantasia about solving any mathematical problem, that is technically accurate and entertaining.  Fermat was not the skilled mathematician, that Andrew Wiles is.  Andrew Wiles is a genius.  In the same sense that Albert Einstein was a genius, and  Steve Jobs was not a genius.  But Steve Jobs was a very successful entrepreneur.  Mathematics is primarily a non verbal symbolic discipline.  It doesn't translate well to the stage.
  The more you know about this subject; the more you will be disappointed by this DVD.  If you don't know anything about the subject, one will simply be confused.  I cannot recommend this DVD; unless you have spent a thousand hours trying solve Fermat's Last Theorem, and desperately want to laugh at your fools adventure.",1412553600,,1117,4.898395721925134
