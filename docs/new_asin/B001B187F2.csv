8281160,1,B001B187F2,"Dont Believe anybody else's reviews of this film! I don't even know where to begin when listing all the things wrong with this film!! If these people were in a competition to spend the littlest amount of money and make the worst waste of time film ever, they WIN!! I am shocked that even the likes of Tom Towles, and Bill Moseley had ANYTHING at all to do with this waste of time. Especially the gore did not phase me one teeensy tiny bit because it was the PHONIEST looking effects i've seen in my life !  From the very beginning I wondered if they purposely sought out a cast of sedated junkies and purposely put everybody in make up to look like they had dark circles under their eyes too ?!  I  AND anybody else who looks at it, should be paid just to sit through it. I have no reason to make this up, it was the worst! hope u got paid something worthwhile at least, Tom.  I don't see how.",1298073600,,893,4.144508670520231
8281161,3,B001B187F2,Moseley was a joy to watch. He literally stole the film and it was disturbing and wonderful at the same time. The rest of the film was good and followed a good pace. I'd recommend this film to any horror fan because it was not as bad as other independent horror films out there.,1240617600,,278,4.166666666666667
8281162,4,B001B187F2,this movie was ok  . its weird and crazy at the same time .,1237939200,,59,3.2142857142857144
8281163,4,B001B187F2,"Bill Moseley is one righteous dude.  You probably recognize him as Choptop from Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2, or the long gray-haired Otis B. Driftwood in Devils Rejects.  Here he has another spectacularly creepy role as Mr. Suitcase...

""Does anbody know how to get to Hollywood?""

So asks the goofy, uninvited stranger at the house party.  He looks like the cousin of George Mcfly and Lloyd Christmas.  This man then opens his suitcase filled with razors and offers the leery crowd some group therapy.

""Give me the name of someone you hate,"" he eagerly instructs every person, and with each answer he cuts a nasty slit in his own wrist.  Yep, he's straight-jacket crazy.  Maybe this was an attempt to bond and feel another one's pain, but these morbid actions hardly helped anyone unite.  It's some pretty gruelling stuff, self-mutilation with a smile.

Well, Mr. Suitcase soon leaves, and some eerie coincidences start occurring.  All the people that were mentioned during the hate game start turning up dead.  Bosses, ex-boyfriends, etc....it wouldn't be too bad of a deal except someone sarcastically shouted out that they hated everyone in the room.  Ahhh(shoot), be careful what you wish for.

This is a bloody beautiful low-budget affair.  It does have horrid acting and some gaping plot holes, but this is offset by some gruesome murders, unsettling predicaments, and just plain sick developments.  Some of the murders made me think poor man's Argento, because they really are surprisingly well orchestrated and realistic looking.  However, this flick could have been much better if Moseley would have had more than his brief cameo.

Still, a much better-than-expected slasher, sure to appease you sick and twisted(folks).",1236729600,2,1729,5.154676258992806
8281164,4,B001B187F2,"Home Sick (Adam Wingard, 2007)

Of all the movies (the many, many movies, as seems to happen every January) I have seen so far this month, the only really pleasant surprise of the bunch to this point has been Home Sick, a twisted little Adam Wingard thriller best known for featuring both Walter Moseley (of Rob Zombie's Firefly movies) and Tom Towles (who played opposite Michael Rooker in the immortal Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer). There is, however, much more to recommend it than its cult-flick starpower.

The story kicks off when a strange man (Moseley) carrying a suitcase full of razor blades randomly shows up at a party and starts asking the guests--in a rather forceful manner--whom they would choose to kill, had they a choice. Each guest names someone, or so we presume, as we don't see the whole ritual. (Yes, this becomes important.) After each name is named, Mr. Suitcase, as he's known in the credits, uses one of the razorblades to gash his own arm. Now, this is all well and good, and everyone's kind of weirded out. Things really get crazy the next day, when the people named during the party start turning up dead. But when the guests find out who one of them named during the part we didn't see, they head for the protective arms of Uncle Johnny (Towles), a chili-loving survivalist.

As with many films of this type, Home Sick gets a great deal of its charm from its out-and-out weirdness. It's sick, it's funny, and most importantly it never takes itself too seriously. Every time you think Wingard and writer E. L. Katz have gone as far as they can go in the weirdness department, they ratchet it up one more notch. The script is witty, and if the actors overplay it once in a while, that's more than forgivable given how far under the radar this movie ended up. You probably missed this one when it originally hit the video store shelves; reconsider and give this a shot. Quite a fun little piece. *** ",1233964800,,1935,4.583815028901734
8281165,4,B001B187F2,"I am not part of the production company, you can check my other reveiws. The story is original and the gore is awesome! This is not for the squemish! It is one of those low-budget gems that come around once in a bluee moon, so if you come across it, pick it up! And Bill Moseley (House Of 1000 Corpses, The Devils Rejects) is in it so you can't go wrong there!!",1224115200,2,361,4.027777777777778
8281166,2,B001B187F2,"So I bought myself Home Sick the other day because i was bored. I heard about this movie a while ago and kinda wanted to see it because it has Tiffany Shepis in it. (side note: I think I'm developing a girl-crush on her)
This movie is about a group of young adults who throw a little get together for the homecoming of one of their friends. Out of nowhere a stranger walks through the front door carrying a briefcase. Hes sits down and opens his case which happens to full of razorblades. he refuses to leave until everybody in the room names somebody that they hate. For every person named the stranger cuts himself on his arm. The last person to name somebody names everyone in the room and tells them all to get out. Within the next few days these people start to die by some creature in a hoodie.
So yes this is as bad as it sounds and the acting is worse. It almost seems like the characters took the least logical plan of action for dealing with this crazy turn of events and i think they were all on crack. Anyway I almost gave up on the movie, but then I went to the Special Features. There were three really good short films in there. Two of them had a funny little unexpected twist and the other gave me an unrealistic fear of public restrooms. So all in all I still got something enjoyable out of it. The film was crappy gore-porn as to be expected, so if you're just looking to watch stupid people get killed then hey this movie is for you.",1221264000,3,1452,4.207885304659499
