2436979,3,B000BQ7J98,"I wasn't able to watch this in one viewing.  It just didn't hold my interest.  But I finally made my way to the end.  Everyone in this movie did a decent job acting, except for Brooke Shields.  She again showed why she hasn't had any major roles outside of Blue Lagoon and Pretty Baby.",1254441600,,285,4.222222222222222
2436980,5,B000BQ7J98,This is a very good movie.  It kept my attention.  I would recommend this movie to those who like mysteries.,1181433600,6,108,4.35
2436981,3,B000BQ7J98,"GONE BUT NOT FORGOTTEN is based on the best seller by Philip Margolin; another example of the book being better than the movie.

However, this miniseries is effectively produced and features some good performances.

Brooke Shields does okay a defense attorney who finds herself defending a corporate giant on a serious murder charge.  Scott Glenn is the client who we know is guilty and has a horrifying past as well.  Lou Diamond Phillips is the DA who wants to put Glenn away, and Marilu Henner is the cop from Glenn's past who tries to help Phillips.

It's all familiar territory but there are enough twists and suspenseful moments to make it worthwhile viewing.",1170288000,13,665,4.849557522123894
2436982,5,B000BQ7J98,"Gone But Not Forgotten is a first rate mystery thriller.  Brooke Shields as well as the rest of the cast did a great job.  The screenplay written by WGA award nominated writer Steven H. Berman is top notch.  Go get it now, highly reccomended.",1154131200,3,242,4.454545454545454
2436983,5,B000BQ7J98,"This is an excellent murder mystery/thriller that will keep you interested from start to finish.  The cast is uniformly good and the script very well-written.  Everything about it is way above average for a TV-movie.  At first it seems as though it will be a standard courtroom drama, but after the set-up it goes in an entirely different direction and keeps you guessing the whole time.  Watching this movie is like curling up with a good book on a dark and stormy night.  I recommend it highly.",1137283200,24,496,4.655172413793103

2437019,4,B000BQ7J98,"I bought this film a few weeks ago. Never saw it when it came out years ago. Had my kind of cast in it. Grew up watching Brooke Shields, so I'd be lying if I didn't admit she was my main reason for getting it though. I wish she did more movies. Anything with Marilu Henner and Lou Diamond Phillips in it, is always welcome too. Doesn't get much cooler than Lou and it was nice to see him play the good guy. Television needs more mini-series and this worked quite well as one. I thought everyone did a fine job in it and thought it was well produced.",1363910400,2,549,4.045871559633028
2437020,5,B000BQ7J98,I saw this on TV and went on line and bought the DVD I liked it so well.  Great acting and neat story.  I have loaned it to my friends. Nice to see Brook in a movie.,1350691200,2,165,3.4324324324324325
2437021,5,B000BQ7J98,"I know there are very few movies that live up to the books, and this one doesnt do it.  But, it comes close.  The book is one of the best Ive ever read, so that definitely makes this a good review.  I had figured out the book when I read it, so the movie was no mystery to me, but it will be a good one for someone who hasn't read the book.  I also don't normally like Brooke Shields, but this is the rare exception to the rule.",1293840000,2,428,3.7752808988764044
2437022,1,B000BQ7J98,"I thought that this might be a tolerable B movie.  But it was the worst movie I have seen in a number of years.  Scott Glenn, who does have talent, does not prove it in this piece of work.  This was a pathetic attempt at producing a murder mystery.  Don't waste your time.  Play solitare, or take a walk, or even, open a book.  Do NOT encourage the making of REALLY BAD movies.",1262217600,,377,4.095890410958904
2437023,5,B000BQ7J98,"I have to say this movie was on in the middle of the night and usually a tv movie that comes on late is just fodder to put a person to sleep.  But this movie was crazy.  Crazy in such a good way I was more than willing to stay up until 2 in the morning just to see what happened.  The acting of the characters is great in this movie and the suspense is amazing, at every turn you are trying to figure out if martin darius is guilty, and as it goes along it gives a few great clues and scenes that take a person totally off guard which is why it was worth the watch. I ordered the movie, as well as teh book. This was a great watch :) anyone who enjoys mystery and suspense will love this ;) I did.",1262131200,5,697,3.793103448275862

8090999,3,B000BQ7J98,"The first 3/4 of the this movie is good/very suspenseful. It drops off down the stretch. It's still watchable. However some of the acting is dreadful. Phillips is good, Shields - not so much.",1447459200,,191,4.647058823529412

8091003,4,B000BQ7J98,"American readers of bestselling novels do seem to have a taste for rather vicious stories. In a lot of these books, the baddie doesn't quietly do someone in with arsenic as in a lot of Agatha Christie novels. Instead, victims are tortured before the coup de grace, often in some rural setting like a swamp or a barn with implements similar to the instruments of torture used during interrogations in the Middle Ages. Maybe American's taste for the ghoulish shouldn't be surprising given that this country boasts sustaining some of the most gruesome of crimes, such as the Wineville Chicken Coop Murders of the 1930's or the Zodiac killer of the late 1960's and 1970's. The average American could be equally entertained (or repulsed, depending upon your point of view) by devouring true crime books as well as crime fiction. ""Gone But Not Forgotten"" is a novel adapted for cable that chronicles two series of heinous crimes, both 10 years apart.

Scott Glenn, in maybe the most fiendish role of his career, portrays Martin Darius, a Sacramento magnate-developer who may have had a previous life in upstate New York in a small town called Hunter's Point where his wife and daughter were mercilessly dispatched. Fast-forward 10 years. He has now changed his name and swings big development deals in Sacramento, California. There, a serial kidnapper is on the loose who has a taste for young uppity women who are both attractive and rich. The kidnapper snatches each woman and leaves a calling card that says ""Gone But Not Forgotten"" along with a black rose. It is unclear whether these victims are alive or dead. Ten years earlier, there was also a serial kidnapper in Hunter's Point who did the same thing: kidnap a young beautiful woman from society's upper-crust and leave the same calling card with a similar black rose.

When the authorities learn that one of the victims had been having an affair with Darius, he becomes a suspect. He entices up-and-coming crackerjack attorney Betsy Tannenbaum (Brooke Shields) to take his case, partially by offering a $100,000 fee of attainder. Alan Page (played by Lou Diamond Philips) is the detective on the case who also begins researching the crimes at Hunter's Point. He is unexpectedly visited by a detective from New York, Nancy Gordon played by Marilu Henner (of Taxi fame), who had been on the Hunter's Point case. But strangely, the files regarding the Hunter Point case are missing. And then Henner goes missing. Both Shields and Philips decide to investigate further at Hunter's Point, 3000 miles away.

A decent but rather brutal crime drama. At one point, a lot of characters end up murdered. The final solution is interesting if not incredibly disturbing. This may not be as brutal as the recent film ""The Changeling"" but it comes close. Not for the feint of heart. Although I believe in the freedom of entertainment, I do have to wonder what purpose it serves for people to continue devouring material of such gruesome content.",1432944000,2,2983,4.902970297029703
