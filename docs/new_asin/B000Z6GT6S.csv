While the series manages to keep the steady momentum that has driven this series so far, the huge cast is surprisingly draining to keep up with. While it would be nice if this series would finally start to get to the point it's not a terrible thing to get to know the sibyllae of Chor Tempest for a little while longer.",1213833600,,481,4.604651162790698
