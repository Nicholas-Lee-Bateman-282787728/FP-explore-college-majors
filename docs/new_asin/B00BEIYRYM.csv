5589421,5,B00BEIYRYM,"Thoroughly enjoyed the movie.  I am a big supporter of Julian Assange  and a big fan of Benedict Cumberbatch.
I found it fascinating.",1382054400,5,133,4.739130434782608
5589422,3,B00BEIYRYM,"My initial impression of Julian Assange was that he was an egotistical jerk. Because this R-rated, dramatized account of WikiLeaks is from the perspective of his former collaborator Daniel Berg, I found no reason to change my mind. In May, 2013, I reviewed a documentary on the same topic, ""We Steal Secrets: The Story of WikiLeaks"" but it didn't have the luxury of a spooky Benedict Cumberbatch doing a chilly portrayal of Assange.

Depending on your point of view, this audacious hacker and his army of anonymous volunteers exposed states' secrets and confidential information that jeopardized agents and shocked the world, therefore he is either a hero or a villain.

Watch:
  * Benedict Cumberbatch (""Sherlock"") is Julian Assange, a fellow who keeps offering different reasons why his hair is white. In my opinion, this thorny fellow may have a touch of Aspergers.
  * Daniel Brhl (""Rush"") is Daniel Berg, an acolyte and eventually a skeptic who believes in Assange's original premise of total transparency for governments.
  * David Thewlis (""War Horse"") is Nick Davies with The Guardian. He speaks for all of us when he questions the morality of the press exposing undercover agents and their families to reprisals.
  * Peter Capaldi (""In the Loop"") is the voice for print journalism, he expresses the clash between ethics and the need for a profit.
  * Dan Stevens (""Downton Abbey"") is another member of the press. His admiration for Assange comes into question.
  * Anthony Mackie (""Runner Runner"") is another confounded U.S. official. The sheer numbers of WikiLeaks' Internet activity boggles his brain.

This one went up in my estimation when I learned that Assange HATES it! (He is, as of this writing (October, 2013), still hiding in the Ecuadorean Embassy in London.

I didn't particularly like the script, it was too contrived and could have been far more thought provoking, but Cumberbatch gave me the willies and Laura Linney along with Stanley Tucci added class to the mix!

Amazon will notify me when the DVD is available. I always pass this information on to my JayFlix.net participants.",1381881600,6,2106,5.040462427745664
5589512,3,B00BEIYRYM,"The content drives the movie; not the characters. The Fifth Estate is WikiLeaks. It's a new paradigm for disseminating news and information for public consumption. Whistleblowers. The movie did an excellent job portraying that theme as well as the ethics involved. In my opinion, the best moment of the movie was an international paper's news editor-in-chief's realization they (the newspaper business) escalated Assange to the point of unchecked power in which Assange became King and ruled global news. Admittedly, I did hit pause after the first hour; and, while the real life drama of WikiLeak's birth was fueled on high anxiety and mind boggling computer coding, that excitement did not carry into the movie.",1505606400,,713,5.2631578947368425

The previews for this movie looked exciting, and i'm wondering if this is the same film I saw in the previews. With me being a cumberbatch fan and being interested in learning more about Wikileaks, I decided to rent The Fifth Estate. Bad idea! My biggest problem is that the dialog in this movie is unintelligible. For some reason I can only make out about half of Cumberbatch's dialogue and the rest is muttered. I'm not sure if this is part of his character, but it's really annoying. Like others have said in the reviews, his hair really is annoying. And i've never found hair to be annoying in my life. The music in this film doesn't fit the premise of the scenes leaving you scratching your head wondering what is going on. The pacing of the film is totally off and the camera action is confusing. Cumberbatch is a fantastic actor but this movie is total trash! Save your money.",1489190400,4,1005,4.374331550802139

5589614,2,B00BEIYRYM,Pretty disappointing production for what should have been a fascinating subjet matter. This film barely kept my attention as I found myself easily distracted from the movie.

5589653,4,B00BEIYRYM,"The film is quite good, I just could not finish watching it, because I had not realized it was all about Wikileaks, and of course,.the entire plot makes me want to throw up.  The folks who want to adjudicate free speech above all else are dreaming of living in the 18th century, this is today!  It is sad because Benedict Cumberbach is a superb actor, in fact I ordered the movie based on his being in it as well as Peter Capaldi.  By the way, the fourth estate is the media, I had no idea that the fifth estate belonged to the Snowdens and Assanges.",1456099200,,550,4.219047619047619
5589654,4,B00BEIYRYM,"I remember when this movie first hit theaters, I was conflicted about seeing it.  It got generally poor reviews and certainly didn't do well in its initial release.  Before I knew it, gone.  I became interested again as the central figure, Julian Assange was back in the news.  In addition, actors Benedict Cumberbatch and Alicia Vikander have risen high into the A-list seemingly in more films than there is time for.

Director Bill Condon (Mr. Holmes and a couple Twilight Saga films) takes an even keel approach to Assange as he evolves from a teen-age hacker to whom some would call a cyber-terrorist.  Most recognize Assange as the WikiLeaks guy who leaked hundreds of thousands of secret cables and military secrets thanks to army corporal Bradley Manning.  Early on Assange is seen as somewhat sympathetic as his sources leak information involving government corruption, illegal bank money laundering and the like.  Assange, is essentially a one-man show and a computer wizard.  As opportunities increase, he brings on board another interested in his mission.  Daniel Berg (Daniel Bruhl) joins forces and becomes somewhat of a moral compass as Assange is bent upon releasing all documents, even if un-redacted names put his sources in mortal danger.  Ms. Vikander plays Anke Domscheit, Daniels girlfriend and confidant.

I can appreciate the dilemma a director has trying to make material like this interesting.  It just isn't sexy.  But as deadlines and time constraints close in on the big reveal (the massive leaks involving the The New York Times, The London Guardian and Germanys Der Spiegel), Condon and his crew spin the camera in a circle, heightening the confusion and making the viewer dizzy.  Cumberbatch has been lauded for his performance but I was unimpressed.  He doesnt seem to know what Assange is thinking much of the time.  I don't know if this is because the director and writer weren't sure or what.  I just thought he was miscast, although he pulls off the Aussie accent well.  The better performance is by Bruhl who may have more screen time and is certainly more sympathetic.  Assanges ego and seraphic belief of unadulterated information will save the world becomes his undoing.  His coining of the fifth estate (unfiltered free information) is based on the principals of the fourth estate being the press, the watchdog of the first 3 (government) estates.

The Blu ray package (includes a DVD) and comes with a 1080p video resolution with a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  The movie looks great with excellent black levels, proper coloring and accurate skin-tones.  Detail is excellent with plenty of close-ups getting down to the pores.  I found no anomalies or inconsistencies.  Well done.  The audio comes by way of a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track.  It is equally well done, with a surprising use of the surrounds and the LFE channel, all very effective.  Good dynamics and well positioned dialog.  You might have to run the amp up a bit as some of the non-American English can be difficult to understand at times.  Subtitles are available in English SDH, Spanish and French.  There are 3 extras.  Two deal with the technical aspects of filming computer screens and other visualizations.  The other features composer Carter Burwell discussing the very effective musical score.",1455062400,,3302,5.042513863216266
5589655,5,B00BEIYRYM,It was very informative. It was a great movie. I will definitely recomend this movie!,1450396800,,85,4.733333333333333
5589656,3,B00BEIYRYM,"An intriguing film that doesn't quite get its point across, and ends up being more character study than anything else. Which is fine, and it is fun to watch Benedict Cumberbatch on screen immerse himself in the role and that alone makes the film interesting to watch, for though Wikileaks may have been a sensation and a bit of a game changer at the time it first hit the scene, it's mostly fallen off the radar for the general public, losing out to meaningless reality TV and shallow political theatrics.",1449878400,,505,4.622222222222222

5589658,2,B00BEIYRYM,"This film intentionally painted Julian Assange as a screwed up character.  They also insinuated that people were killed as a result of the disclosure, which is false.",1443744000,,166,5.148148148148148
5589659,5,B00BEIYRYM,"I avoided this movie when it first came out due to its lackluster reviews (both film critic and average viewer alike) and due to Mr. Assange being unhappy about the film (I assume because of the author of the story and the falling out he had with him).  I only just decided to watch it out of boredom and curiosity on a rare day with time to myself.

Wow, was this movie good.

I've followed Julian Assange for several years now and avoid the corporate main stream media whenever they have something to say about him.  I obtain information about Julian Assange via independent news organizations (Democracy Now via his various interviews  excellent, btw) and via his own words (published or spoken).  Based on what I have seen of him thus far, The Fifth Estate appears to paint an accurate portrait of his personality.  Though I don't know 100% how true the author (Daniel Domscheit-Berg) tells the WikiLeaks story, I intuitively feel it is a fairly accurate depiction.

Julian Assange comes across as a brilliant, yet personality-disordered purist (perhaps a narcissist).  He seems arrogant, but at the same time noble.  No doubt his early childhood years have something to do with this (his mother being involved in a cult and moving around so much with very little stability).

I won't put my spin on whether I think his actions are right or wrong or somewhere in between for this review.  I will simply say that The Fifth Estate was an interesting, riveting, well-acted story about WikiLeaks and its original founder Julian Assange.  It is definitely worth seeing.",1439510400,,1568,4.8277153558052435

 The Fifth Estate
A review by HieiYYH2

Disclaimer:  I am by no means condoning or praising the actions of the founders of Wiki-leaks I am simply reviewing a movie based on their story.  Now forward and Allons-y (It's french for Let's Go)

""A secret organization that fears information.  Historically not awesome.""  Tony Stark from The Avengers.

The Fifth Estate a movie based on the raise and fall of the infamous information site named Wiki-leaks.  A site that mirrors a much more widely used and sited website called Wikipedia (though the credibility of information on Wikipedia is questionable at best.).  The movie shows us possibly a more monstrous underbelly of the world.  The premise of the movie while based on true events, dramatizes the lengths too which governments and organizations will go to silence those who would make public knowledge the dirty skeletons in their closets.  This albeit extreme case scenarios for a movie leaves open the door to some haunting questions.

1. How can you trust what you read or hear?
2. Is your sources credible?
3. What are those in power hiding that they would silence those who would call attention to them?
4. In a world where truth is distorted based upon the tellers beliefs and understanding.  How than do we know what is truth and what is heresy?

The flow of information has DRASTICALLY changed in the last thirty years.  It has gone from what we are told on TV and Newspapers.  To being able to find information on anything at just a few key strokes.  Information both public and private spread faster than you could ever possibly imagine my humble readers.

But.... As we delve deeper into this.... remember this my friends.

The truth of a matter is lost depending on who you speak to and who has the more convincing information.

The Fifth Estate opens with the downfall of Wikileaks founder Julian Assange.  Moments after his speech to the world about the biggest leak of information in history.  It shows you Julian being driven off in a private car with one of his followers in the backseat.  And than as the car scene fades out we cut to two years earlier in Berlin.

The story starts off with Wiki-leaks meager begins with an auditorium speech to a miniscule sized group at best.  Julian speaks to the crowd while his partner Daniel Berg looks on as Julian lures in a few of the listeners into his web.  ""One Convert at a time.""  Julian says as he and Berg exit the conference hall. At this point in the movie we are slowly being introduced to the magnetic charisma that is Julian.  He has information and knows how to use it to both intrigue and mystify you.  He shows time and again his ability to pull people to his side.  It is truly amazing to behold.

The Story also delves into the progression of Wiki-leaks from minor site to major pain the rear for many governments and companies.  Going even to the embarrassing story of Vice Presidential candidate Sarah Palin using her personal emails for what should have been on her government email.  Amongst many other stories.  As the story progresses it begins to show the darker side of this ripping back of the veil of secrets spun before our eyes by our governments and the companies in which we buy our products and place our money in.

""Give a man a mask and he will give you the truth."" Oscar Wilde

It is in the crescendo of the story in which the real reason to which Wiki-leaks was ultimately torn asunder.  The incident involving a blank CD labeled only with the words Lady Gaga.  An item so unobtrusive was used to leak the biggest information leak in history and turned the world of Berg and Assange upside down and turned them on each other.

For the technical side of this review I have nothing but the utmost praise.  The script is well paced, the dialog between the characters is believable even the parts with Assange's psychobabble.  The music is fitting but doesn't over power or underplay the mood of the scene.  The characters themselves are believable and you feel for them.  You have a star studded cast with Benedict Cumberbatch as the lead role of Julian Assange it is a joy to watch.  The cast also leaves you both sympathizing and thinking on what will become of them as they go down their path.  When a movie can move you to question and think and not talk down to you like you are below the intelligence of the movie.  You know you have found a great film to watch.

I give this movie a 5 out of 5.  I highly recommend you go out and rent or buy or stream this movie.  Enjoy..",1424131200,,4620,4.626847290640394

5589670,5,B00BEIYRYM,"""THE FIFTH ESTATE"" (2103) IS WONDERFUL! 10 STARS FOR THIS GENIUS MOVIE! HERE'S WHY......!

------------

This movie is good for two reasons....

It depicts unusual people working as computer experts using their skills for political and social purposes, and also it shows the strange and exotic world and lifestyle these computer expert revolutionaries live in....mostly a world of night, fog, and ""film noir"" personality. Both of these are worth learning more about.

A 2013 feature length documentary titled WE STEAL SECRETS was made about the same subject area covered by THE FIFTH ESTATE (2013), and that documentary is a good companion video to screen back to back along with THE FIFTH ESTATE. Actual persons part of the story covered are shown and some are interviewed in WE STEAL SECRETS, and parts of the overall complicated story are covered not covered in THE FIFTH ESTATE, but useful in understanding the larger, complex story. Both movies are worth seeing.

This movie was made to be watched AT HOME while the viewer sits alone on a comfortable couch, paying attention to the many important details of the movie and enjoying it's brilliant cinematic presentation, including it's good direction and screenplay, along with the actor work so widely praised, deservedly.

It is a movie made by genius filmmakers about genius characters (I pass no judgment here on whether the genius depicted is used for good or evil.....the characters portrayed are clearly possessed of genius worth studying...and enjoying!).

First, it depicts the strange and exciting night time, film-noir (in color, since it was made in 2013) world of computer hacker criminals who are do-gooder, revolutionary types always praised by poets, always written about by novelists, and ALWAYS subjects of thriller movies made by Hollywood studios which want to make profitable pictures.

Our lives in present days (2015) are influenced by computers, the Internet, and the World Wide Web and its many websites, including ""news leak/ whistle blower"" websites like WikiLeaks. Com and OpenLeaks. Com.

Political and criminal revolutionaries of the present and future will do their work using computers, hacking, and the Internet, and most people have no idea what this is all about, no expertise or understanding of what it takes to use computers, hacking, the Internet to impact the world.

THE FIFTH ESTATE (2013) shows what that world is like (mostly a night-time world where ""the action"" takes place indoors while perpetrators face computer screens which cast eerie blue/green upward lights onto the faces of the down looking hero/villain computer users.)

Normal people, average people never see this world....but they CAN if they watch this movie. A good two hour education in what the world of computer geeks/ revolutionaries looks like. Worth the price of the video for that alone.

In addition, we see a portrait of a driven, genius (for good or ill...I pass no judgment about that here, I repeat) computer expert who is also a politician, excellent communicator, and intellectual to an advanced level.....well read, well experienced at dealing with a broad variety of important people from the top to the bottom of society (all societies).

The Julian Assange character portrayed in this movie is the result of 60's/70's era counter-culture hippie types.....a second generation hippie/revolutionary, but with up to date skills and ambitions.

Similar, if you will, to the TERMINATOR TWO hero child (aged 12 in the TERMINATOR movie) played by Edward Furlong.

This movie cannot be understood (or enjoyed) unless the viewer does his/her homework FIRST.

Read the Wikipedia biog profile article about Julian Assange, and the Wikipedia article about WIKILEAKS first (read it away from the computer so you can think about it, go back to it later....print out goes to 62 pages if you enlarge the typeface so it's easy to read. Worth the money spent in paper and computer ink!).

The population of the world is now 7 billion people (it was 2 billion
plus as recently as World War II years....70 years ago). That is incredible.

The world is now (predictably and logically) CROWDED. Nobody has
privacy in crowds.

Good things have happened due to the population increase and changes to
accommodate it, but privacy has gone and will keep going.

Privacy of the sort people commonly experienced in the past and expected is simply no longer possible, and people better get used to that.

This movie is all about privacy, and the fact it is disappearing (I pass no judgment on whether this is a good or a bad thing).

The world is now filled with many more smart, educated people than ever lived on the world before (just as it filled with more rich people than ever before, more doctors, more plumbers, etc. etc.......seven billion people worldwide means more of every category of people).

This movie is FOR smart educated people (who must do their homework before seeing the movie, and know how due to their advanced formal education), and ABOUT smart educated people (who run everything in the present day world, and are the only ones who can).

The heroes, the villains, the cops, the robbers, the government types, the revolutionary types are ALL smart, educated people.

The movie is filled with the faces of intelligent people saying intelligent things (and making references nobody who fails to do advanced research about the subject and people depicted in the movie will or can understand).

Do your homework FIRST, before seeing the movie.

Bad reviews this movie got were not written by people who did their homework first. Ignore those reviews! This is a 10 star movie for sure.",1421971200,2,5659,5.083153347732181

5589738,4,B00BEIYRYM,"Main draw: Benedict Cumberbatch, in the role of Julian Assange, the founder of the (in)famous Wikileaks.  Also appearing:
Laura Linney, Stanley Tucci, and Daniel Bruhl in a key supporting role as Assange's number-2 man for a significant period of
time.  The film is apparently based primarily on a book published by this number 2 man (and possibly assisted by another
un-named documentary).

When everyone involved on all sides has so many reasons to lie, it's hard to know how closely the story adheres to the ""facts"",
could they be ascertained.  From what I already knew and what I checked after watching, I believe it to be a fairly good
and unbiased account of the Wikileaks phenomenon.  And because (I think) most people have very strong feelings one way or the other about Wikileaks, feelings about the phenomenon are likely to get in the way of fairly assessing the film.  I thought it was well-done.  It provided an impressive list of exposes that Wikileaks accomplished (oh yeah, BESIDES the one everyone in the US remembers), and it also shows the essential narcissism and personal duplicity of the founder.  But then, so many movements accomplish something mainly because they were inspired by a fanatic.

This is a Hollywood story and not a documentary so I understand that a number of plot elements were created for the movie.  Benedict does a very good job of portraying Assange as seen by the documentaries on the man.

The movie clearly indicates the tension between the government's accumulation of data about everyone through the Internet and other means, and the vulnerability of secrets in that data.

5589826,2,B00BEIYRYM,"Benedict Cumberbatch, bless his heart, is a great actor and he does a perfectly serviceable portrayal of Julian Assange, but the movie itself commits the cardinal sin of making what could have been a riveting narrative a dull and plodding slog of a film. THE FIFTH ESTATE is about how WikiLeaks got started and covers some of their biggest leaks up to the release of the Afghanistan and Iraq war logs. Most of the focus is on the relationship between Daniel Berg (Daniel Bruhl) and Julian Assange (Benedict Cumberbatch) and how they have a falling out. While this might have been a critical part of the WikiLeaks story, the way it played out onscreen didn't exactly make for the most compelling drama. There were also some detours into Berg's personal life as well a limited international look at the effect these leaks had in various countries, to include the US. Still, I had hopes that this movie would be this generation's equivalent of something like THE PRESIDENT'S MEN, but it simply isn't. While the performances are all capable, and the ensemble cast that Bill Condon rounded up is fairly impressive, the narrative lacks the proper focus and doesn't adequately portray the gravity of what is being presented. Other issues include pacing and attempts at being current and tech-savvy that just come off as distracting. The material is presented almost in documentary-like fashion, down to the handheld camerawork, but nothing in the central story is given much context, outside of American embarrassment at having their secret diplomatic cables released. There was also little insight given into Assange's character that could have made him more relatable. Instead, we get a portrait of a rather sad and lame individual. As far as the technical qualities are concerned, there really isn't anything to complain about but there really isn't anything that makes it stand out either. The music, which included lots of electronica, was alright but it wasn't anything I particularly loved. Overall, this was a rather disappointing watch due to the pedestrian approach it took. Your time would be better spent watching WE STEAL SECRETS: THE STORY OF WIKILEAKS, a documentary on the material that is dramatically presented here.",1404345600,,2227,5.087431693989071

5589829,3,B00BEIYRYM,"It's clear that because of this story's importance the project attracted some top talent all of whom deliver quality work. The problem with this piece is its choice of source material which, admittedly, is currently limited.

As an analogy for whether or not you would choose to watch this film ask yourself if you are first a fan of what Julian Assange has contributed to society and journalism.  If you think he's a creep, you'll love this movie, which is told from the point of view by a person who was Assange's right arm until Assange kicked him out of WikiLeaks.

A comparison would be: what if a movie were made about Jesus but the source material was taken from a book written by Judas? In such a version Judas would be the hero and therefore Jesus, according to the rules of story telling would have to come off as an egotistical, megalomaniac who cared primarily for glory. Judas, conversely, would come off as the voice of reason who betrayed his master for the greater good.

This is the version of the WikiLeaks story you will see in The Fifth Estate.

Aside from the fact that this is a one-sided telling of the story there are other problems with this piece from a filmmaking point of view. First, it is extremely long and second it is packed with tons of information to which you must pay very close attention. Watch this movie with a large coffee and your finger on the pause button because it is the only way you'll be able to follow the nuance and minutia of detail necessary to understand the character's motivations.

For example: for reasons I cannot understand the filmmakers decided to frame shots that include words you're supposed to read off laptop screens with the laptop framed in a medium-shot. Meaning, it's like reading micro font and because of the fast-paced editing you get mere seconds to assimilate important data.

For this reason I deducted two stars. This is a ok first effort on telling the WikiLeaks story but history will demand a need for more versions.",1404086400,11,1997,4.640226628895184

5589833,3,B00BEIYRYM,"THE FIFTH ESTATE is certainly an intriguing piece of work - not least for the fact that it hasn't made up its mind about how view the central character.  Played with narcissistic grace by Benedict Cumberbatch - in one of his best film roles to days - Julian Assange comes across as both obsessive and righteous, impossible to live with yet possessed of firm convictions, haunted by his past yet dedicated to improving the future.  His relationship with Daniel Berg (Daniel Bruhl) is a combustible one; Assange doesn't want his partner around yet can't seem to operate without him.  Eventually the two of them break up for good, and Assange is quite literally hoist by his own hubristic petard.  Structurally speaking. Bill Condon's film is particularly flashy - full of rapid cuts and awkward zooms.  Sometimes it becomes rather irritating in its attempt to stress the central theme; despite Assange's assertions to the contrary, Wikileaks was not a worldwide organization but a two-person operation.  The repeated shots of office desks, peopled by clones of Assange, emphasize the protagonist's ambitious, if somewhat unrealistic, dreams.  Eventually the flashiness gets in the way of the film's resolution, especially at the end, when the shots of burning books and campfires seem especially unnecessary, and Nick Davies' (David Thewlis') concluding speech is nothing short of tendentious.  Nonetheless THE FIFTH ESTATE remains perversely watchable, if only to witness the extreme yet ineffectual reactions of US government officials (played by Stanley Tucci and Laura Linney), once the extent of the leaks becomes evident.",1402358400,,1625,5.3203125

I know quite a lot about wikileaks and even did some additional reading before the film, which definitely helped with my understanding. The movie is extremely intriguing, and I certainly learned from it. Other than the prerequisite knowledge needed to understand the movie, the only other drawback was that you have to devote your full attention to this movie.

5589908,2,B00BEIYRYM,"Although the script may be lacking in enthusiasm, Bennedict Cumberbatch shines as WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. Cumberbatch is an actor to watch as he consistently puts his heart and talents into his roles. Unfortunately, THE FIFTH ESTATE is an uninspired and uneven film. The film is based on Assange's partner Daniel Domscheit-Berg's book. Berg comes across as the hero with a conscious who wants to bring truth and justice to the world. It seems like he shares this goal with Assange as they join forces to crusade via the media to educate the public on not-so-pleasant doings of various governments throughout the world. They seem to have a high purpose full of integrity and the feeling of doing the right thing. Assange is am amazing technical wiz able to hide and protect his sources (well, at least at first).
Berg always takes the high moral route as Assange seems to fall into some sociopathic dispair as fame surrounds him. His mission of transparency becomes an experiment in self-glory. It's a bit hard to sort of right from wrong in this film though it seems to be fact-based.
Assange feels that ALL information should be released as it. Berg sees the need to redact the documents--leave out information that could bring harm to anyone, especially the innocent. When releasing documents, is it necessary to release personal information, such as home addresses? It's an interesting dilemma in the fight to bring transparency of government policies to the public.
Unfortunately, the film feels uninspired and lacking in direction.",1396828800,,1546,5.066666666666666

5589967,4,B00BEIYRYM,"haha not enough to join a Cumberbitches club though. This movie doesn't quite live up to his other work; however the subject of 'The Fifth Estate' is fascinating.
I love his other roles as well, The Last Enemy, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, of course Sherlock.
This movie jumps around, is rather frantic like Cumberbatch's character. He is definitely not normal; maybe a genius; but we won't find out. I guess the movie moves at the pace of the internet... fact and rumour zooming about. Even digital records aren't quite hard copy, are they?

The reporter he took along for the ride was rather predictable; maybe because he was the other side. A normal reporter first excited, then he starts to doubt. Daniel Bruehl was good in the role,. you can see from the start he doesn't look or act like a risk taker.

5589973,4,B00BEIYRYM,"I missed The Fifth Estate in the theaters, but watching it with pause and rewind was probably a better experience, since some text information flew by fast.  The shock and excitement of many Wikileaks disclosures helps drive the film, and a complex portrait of Julian Assange emerges.  Both hero and villain, hard to like, yet undeniably a world changer, Benedict Cumberbatch's Julian grabs your attention and keeps it even after he loses your sympathy.  The film's approach to dramatizing computer technology works well, conveying the essentially modern nature of Wikileaks without bogging the film down with minutia.

The director took a lot of liberties with the truth about Assange's life and relationship with the co-leader of Wikileaks, but thankfully the main character stays true to the nature and dreams and hopes of the Wikileaks model.

The movie is at once entertaining AND thought-provoking.  Some say it contains the bias of the authors of the two books on which it is based, which is true to a degree, but the film-makers still present it in such a way as to give the viewers room to decide on the issues themselves.  It's still a great view.

It's just an analysis of the start of WikiLeaks and Julian Assange in particular. Benedict Cumberbatch is great as Assange and the rest of the cast is top notch as well. About my only complaint is that we didn't see enough of Assange's perspective. It was mostly told from Berg's point of view.

5590091,5,B00BEIYRYM,"First off, this item arrived to my house very, very, quickly and it was well-packed and in of course, perfect condition.

On the film itself, I saw this film whilst it was in theaters and I thought it was honestly good.
Assange was disapproving of this film, saying it was going to be the anti-Wikileaks movie and frame him to be the bad guy and in some ways, that is exactly what it did.

However, when I saw this movie it actually made me root for Assange and his motives.
This movie is very biased as it is based of the book by the man played by Daniel Bruhl who, as shown in the movie, is no longer affiliated with Wikileaks or Assange.

This film was intriguing and provided and interesting story, regardless of some clearly fictional aspects added to the film to make it more ""juicy"" or whatever they were aiming for.

The soundtrack/score is another thing to be noted.
Carter Burwell does yet another fantastic job with the composition of the film's score and the few select songs in the film are also nice.

All in all it is a good film.
Just be certain you know the whole story before you judge Assange due to this film and sometime, actually stop by the Wikileaks site. You'll be surprised.",1393977600,,1200,4.411764705882353

It made me realize how difficult it must be to report the news responsibly and how ""a little information"" is dangerous.

In the film Daniel is portrayed as  the morally conscious good guy who is deceived and manipulated by the egomaniacal and extremely rude Julian Assange. The more the film the progresses the more villainous Assange becomes. Near the end of the film I felt like I was watching a batman movie where Daniel was suppose  to be the Dark Knight and Assange was suppose to be the Joker.

A history of WikiLeaks and the impact it has had on the world consciousness. As most good we start at the beginning.

I am impressed that the film was able to wrangle in some fair actors quit a few too many to mention in this review. There is no way to tell between what is the real story and what is manufactured to create what is supposed to look like a documentary. Are we also to believe the parallel stories of tensions between the top leakers or the love story between office coworkers or anything thrown in to make a more than one-dimensional presentation?

The presentation includes lots of loud background music that mostly to represent time passing. There are lots of old camera tricks like circling the subject. Scenes were tossed in as metaphors. I watched the Blu-ray version which helped with the aesthetics but probably did not contribute anything to the story. The extras on the DVD try it justify the sea realistic metaphor scenes. There is a section ""Scoring Secrets"" on how to make background noise.

Rising to the occasion is the new hottest ticket, Benedict Cumberbatch who, apart from the jarringly blonde hair, rises to the occasion playing an ego-centric, and increasingly, and justifiably, paranoid Assange.  The best thing about this movie is that it doesn't answer any questions! Was Assange good or bad? Both; Neither.  Should everything be out in the open? Of course not! Maybe.  Sometimes.  It depends.

5590161,3,B00BEIYRYM,"There really isn't anything in this movie that's unavailable in a myriad of documentaries.  The acting is top notch with Mr. Cumberbatch pitch perfect as Julian Assange.  I don't know enough about the other people portrayed to know whether the actors captured them well, but overall I enjoyed their portrayals.  The best scenes in the movie involve the early stages of Wikileaks ensuring their anonymity through shuffling servers around and even purchasing used equipment to help their bandwidth requirements.

The movie ends in the early stages of the aftermath of the 2010 diplomatic documents leak and left me wanting to see more of the blowback.  The movie touches on a few subsequent events, notably Mr. Assange's legal troubles, in the end via excerpts from an interview (not an actual interview but Cumberbatch's portrayal) and on-screen text.

Ultimately the movie proved to be a solid showing of the events but I can't help but think a second chapter would enhance this movie by expanding on the aftermath and better telling the story of what happened to those involved.  Maybe in a few years there will be enough material for someone to consider such a continuation of the story.

I recommend renting rather than purchasing this movie.  It is a good movie but isn't exactly rewatchable material.  I rewatched a few scenes immediately after my initial viewing just to gain clarity on who some characters were but haven't felt the desire to see it again (rented about a month ago now).",1393113600,2,1493,4.959839357429719
5590162,4,B00BEIYRYM,"After seeing 2 films about Asssange on Netflix and his interview on the Ron Paul Channel, I watched ""The Fifth Estate""--twice. I had to watch the beginning of the movie again to catch everything I missed in the fast-moving sequences. Whistle-blowers are admirable in that they take great risks in exposing corruption perpetrated by the rich and powerful--especially in our own nation. If the portrayal of Assange's character is accurate, then he, Iike the rest of humanity, is a flawed individual whose motives for his mission are only known to himself. In shining the light of truth in dark places, that same light will expose our own hearts and shortcomings.  I'm curious to know if Assange has seen this movie and his thoughts about it.  Benjamin Cumberbatch and David Thewlis are very good actors and were definitely a draw in watching this movie.  My favorite role that Cumberbatch has played is the character of British Prime Minister William Pitt in the movie, ""Amazing Grace,"" the life story of abolitionist and MP, William Wilberforce.",1393113600,,1044,5.023121387283237

5590168,4,B00BEIYRYM,"The film opens with a 4,000 year montage history of the fifth estate during the credits leading up to Wikileaks in July of 2010. The story centers on the personality of Julian Assange (Benedict Cumberbatch) and his association with Daniel Berg (Daniel Brohl). Much of the film is dedicated to the nuts and bolts  of the process than the havoc it caused.  The film calls Julian a ""mad prophet."" He is portrayed as an arrogant egotistical a##hole who is mono-focused, psychotic, and more nervous than a long tailed cat in a room full of rocking chairs.

The message of the film is that the free press takes courage, martyrs , and anarchists.  I couldn't help think about Leon Trotsky,  who revealed all the secret treaties held by the Czar, claiming that government secrets are class warfare. They are kept to protect the privileged members of society.  Indeed, this film exposes that aspect of secrets,  but it has a complexity that questions if all secrets should be told when there are innocent lives at stake.

We are certainly in a new dawning when it comes to security of our personal and national data. What they accomplished was to create and give clarity to a whole movement around what used to be called ""whistle blowing"" and that feat is monumental. However, the movie seemed somewhat disjointed because of the number of events it attempts to weave together. Acting was fine but it points out with too heavy a hand, why certain personalities will always believe that they are the ""smartest person in the room"".

The American Revolution resulted in Canada being populated by Tories. I'm sure there were heroes and villains on both sides. And the same rule has probably applied in every revolution since. Strong people generally have big defects of character - simple human calculus. I would be surprised if an individual that fomented a revolution wasn't deeply flawed. And disappointed if the director didn't capture that. His supporters will support him even when he's wrong - more humanity at work I think. Good. But even if the movie took a position based on the books at their disposal, I think they did an excellent job of portraying one of the most profound moments in my life (remember the Arab Spring, world changing indeed). The events portrayed truly represented a world changing phenomenon that I didn't fully appreciate prior to this film, which I thought was excellently done. There are excellent reviews discussing the actors and elements of the film, and I agree with the ones that enjoyed it as much as I did. I also imagine we'll be years figuring out what we lived through. I downloaded samples from both books this film was based on.

All sides scrambling; with very interesting character portrayals; honest & human scale in an international scale problem, fraught with slippery slopes of moral choice.

A very held back & sober, real performance by Cumberbatch; not the steely bigger-than-life Khan of Star Trek nor the peripatetic genius of Sherlock.  He's an utter pleasure to watch.  As is his beautiful --again very different -- portrayal in "" Third Star"".  I highly recommend it ,as well as ""Fifth Estate.""

I've noticed several reviews disliking the movie because they feel he is a traitor. I highly disagree. You seem to confuse blind loyalty to being patriotic. Without checks and balances the system doesn't work. History has proven numerous times, absolute power corrupts and ends badly for the people. The people we have in place to protect us, are abusing their positions. You might even say Julian compromised the safety of informants. But keep in mind, just the WMD lie alone resulted in at least a half million casualties. Julian is a hero, for stepping up to the plate and exposing those that think they are above the law. We need more like him. Instead of viewing our imperialistic/corpo/banker owned military natural resource thieves as heroes, view those who are actually trying to protect you as such, and utilize your critical thinking, rather then letting THE MAINSTREAM PUPPET MEDIA DO IT FOR YOU!",1391472000,2,1047,5.022988505747127

I highly recommend this for anyone who is either a fan of Benedict Cumberbatch's works or has an interest in what has occurred with Wikileaks.

Having seen the film with an open mind, I now have no idea why the film was viewed so negatively. Was it because critics did not agree with Assange as a person? Did they feel the film didn't give enough insight into Wikileaks? Did they have a problem with the pacing? I don't know.

Right from the opening scene - a hugely ambitious montage of human knowledge through the ages, The Fifth Estate establishes itself as stylish and riveting.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Benedict-Cumberbatch/dp/B00499LTLM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Benedict Cumberbatch</a>&nbsp;hits the nail home as Julian Assange! His crazy Aussie cyber-punk bent on transparency and informational freedom is in many ways his most mature, compelling performance.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Daniel-Bruhl/dp/B00H9671DW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Daniel Bruhl</a>&nbsp;is the human centre of the film, giving a relatable, conflicted performance of depth and subtlety. The outstanding cast is rounded off by an excellent David Thewlis, Downton Abbey's Dan Stevens, future-Doctor Peter Capaldi, and an entertaining Laura Linney and Stanley Tucci. When the screenplay gets wonky, Condon's cast brings home the message like a hammer.

Equally impressive is Tobias Schliessler's rich and vibrant neo-noir visuals. Coupled with the fantastic Carter Burwell's score, we have a film that is technically adept AND terrifically acted. Now we come to the screenplay, and this is where I have to disagree with the critics. It is tremendously hard to write a screenplay on WikiLeaks that has a satisfying conclusion, especially considering how the story of Assange and WikiLeaks is ongoing and actually rather anticlimactic. But Josh Singer managed to make his story satisfying and relevant...a feat I give the film credit for.

CONS: Singer's screenplay, while structured well, just doesn't give us enough insight into Assange's incredible character other than through exposition. Who knows how great a film THE FIFTH ESTATE could be if Condon and Co. went all out with a dangerous, edgy look at WikiLeaks? At times the film feels like a globe-trotting adventure as characters hop from Brussels to Berlin to Iceland and Kenya without much breath in between. And as the REAL Assange has so succinctly pointed out, there is something to be desired in the accuracy department here.

But in conclusion, I really enjoyed THE FIFTH ESTATE - much more than I anticipated.

5590391,4,B00BEIYRYM,"In light of it's mixed critical response and box office failure, I avoided THE FIFTH ESTATE for a long time. More fool me. Having seen the film with an open mind, I now have no idea why the film was viewed so negatively. Was it because critics did not agree with Assange as a person? Did they feel the film didn't give enough insight into Wikileaks? Did they have a problem with the pacing? I don't know.

Right from the opening scene - a hugely ambitious montage of human knowledge through the ages, The Fifth Estate establishes itself as stylish and riveting.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Benedict-Cumberbatch/dp/B00499LTLM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Benedict Cumberbatch</a>&nbsp;hits the nail home as Julian Assange!

The outstanding cast is rounded off by an excellent David Thewlis, Downton Abbey's Dan Stevens, future-Doctor Peter Capaldi, and an entertaining Laura Linney and Stanley Tucci. When the screenplay gets wonky, Condon's cast brings home the message like a hammer.

Equally impressive is Tobias Schliessler's rich and vibrant neo-noir visuals. Coupled with the fantastic Carter Burwell's score, we have a film that is technically adept AND terrifically acted. Now we come to the screenplay, and this is where I have to disagree with the critics. It is tremendously hard to write a screenplay on WikiLeaks that has a satisfying conclusion, especially considering how the story of Assange and WikiLeaks is ongoing and actually rather anticlimactic. But Josh Singer managed to make his story satisfying and relevant...a feat I give the film credit for.

CONS: Singer's screenplay, while structured well, just doesn't give us enough insight into Assange's incredible character other than through exposition. Who knows how great a film THE FIFTH ESTATE could be if Condon and Co. went all out with a dangerous, edgy look at WikiLeaks? At times the film feels like a globe-trotting adventure as characters hop from Brussels to Berlin to Iceland and Kenya without much breath in between. And as the REAL Assange has so succinctly pointed out, there is something to be desired in the accuracy department here.

But in conclusion, I really enjoyed THE FIFTH ESTATE - much more than I anticipated. Benedict Cumberbatch gives an electric and outstanding performance, and is supported by an experienced and smart supporting cast.

Blessedly, the portrait of Assange we get here is neither pure sinner nor pure saint. He is a man of contradictions -- he insists on publishing the whole, unvarnished truth, but frequently lies about himself, on subjects great and small -- how many people work for him? what are his motives in publishing leaks? and even, why did his hair turn white?

Other viewers may focus on whether this movie was accurate or not. I admit that wasn't my primary concern -- it's a thriller, not a documentary, and it works for what it is. The movie delivers a mounting sense of danger, and the visuals stayed interesting, in spite of the fact that the action often consisted of people typing and reading messages. (They did have one too many people punctuate a conversation by slamming their laptop shut, for my taste.)

5590416,4,B00BEIYRYM,"Director Bill Condon (Gods and Monsters, Kinsey, Dreamgirls, The Twilight Saga series) directs a film adapted from Daniel Domscheit-Berg's book ""Inside WikiLeaks: My Time with Julian Assange at the World's Most Dangerous Website"" -  along with another similar book by David Leigh and Luke Harding - adapted for the screen by Josh Singer - and in doing so brings considerable clarity to the WikiLeaks scandal in a way that more of us can understand the history and the concept behind this precursor to the contemporary fixation on spying. It may by a bit long in the tooth, and perhaps it is one man's view, but the pacing of the action and the extraordinary way in which the concept developed is enlightening.

The headlining true story begins as WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange (Benedict Cumberbatch) and his colleague Daniel Domscheit-Berg (Daniel Brhl) team up to become underground watchdogs of the privileged and powerful. Without financing they create a platform that allows whistle-blowers to anonymously leak covert data, shining a light on the dark recesses of government secrets and corporate crimes. Soon, they are breaking more hard news than the world's most legendary media organizations combined. But when Assange and Berg gain access to the biggest trove of confidential intelligence documents in U.S. history, they battle each other and a defining question of our time: what are the costs of keeping secrets in a free society-and what are the costs of exposing them?  Perhaps the better way to survey the content is to quote a passage Assange states: `Man is least himself when he talks with his own person. But if you give him a mask, he will tell you the truth. Two people, and a secret: the beginning of all conspiracies. More people, and, more secrets. But if we could find one moral man, one whistle-blower. Someone willing to expose those secrets, that man can topple the most powerful and most repressive of regimes.'

No matter how the viewer perceives Assange, this film provides information in an entertaining and enlightening manner about one of the most talked about scandals of this century - thus far.... The performances by the entire cast are exemplary. Grady Harp, January 14",1390953600,2,2210,5.046575342465753

It's important to remember that this movie is the screen writer's version of what happened based on many different sources but not the man himself. Stories have been created where there were none, while other incidences that happened were not shown. About 35% of this movie is actually true. Seriously though, no American diplomat (especially a white woman) walks into a tea house in an Arab country alone, has a conversation with an agent, and then goes back to Air Force One... seriously!

There are many movies out on wikileaks; this movie tries to create a picture of what Julian Assange is like as a person, his relationships, his issues. In the end, it's important that we not weaken the importance of any of the leaked information by focusing on the personal habits of a middle man.",1390867200,11,879,4.8533333333333335

I do not consider what LaSalle determines a distinct derogatorial as either intelligent or germane.  We do not need a film to decide for us in these matters.  Rather, `The Fifth Estate' takes us on a fascinating journey of discovery, unfolding characters and information along the way that, hopefully, will cause us to be curious enough to investigate the issues and players for ourselves.

It did get me to further investigate the events and players depicted, as Cumberbatch hoped it would, though I can see why Assange felt making this film based on the point of view of one who intentionally sabatoged the organization on his way out and attempted to set up a competing one is completely misguided. The film is centered on the tension between Daniel wanting to aid Julian's cause and being seduced by Julian's cult of personality, and being resentful of that same cult of personality. That Daniel takes an ethical stand there at the end seems largely a fabrication. Love Benedict to bits but gotta say his performance was more of a brilliant impersonation than one of his greatest acting jobs--wonder if the real-life person he is playing is so guarded that's all he could really do. But like I said, not just any impersonation, a brilliant one. Assange tells Daniel flat out that he may have Aspergers, that he has trust issues due to being ratted out by teenage co-hacker friends--most of these reveals are gotten through exposition. Laura Linney impresses as always and I do feel her character's presence helped portray what negative impact the Manning leaks may have had on well meaning individuals within or cooperating with the US government.
  Soapbox: all journalists have bias, even Wikileaks which vows to pass on documents unedited. Protecting sources but refusing to protect names within unedited documents is an inconsistent moral position. Assange has principles but operates in a moral grey area. I feel until he admits his own biases--even by leaking some documents but not others you come down on one side of a conflict or another--he cannot truly be said to be an overall positive force in the world.",1390435200,,1848,4.900958466453674

I do not agree with what he did and because of that I was ready to hate the movie. What I discovered watching this was something I didn't expect. I know the movie is based off two books on one end of the spectrum and doesn't tell the ""whole story"" but for the most part it tried not to take sides as far as whether the site is a good thing or not. What it focused on was Assange and his insecurities and stubbornness which affected the others who worked with him and eventually led to the life he leads today. Going in I didn't like Assange and after watching this my view of the website changed a little but my view of him remained the same. Again though I realize this is only one side of the story.

5590446,4,B00BEIYRYM,"Director Bill Condon (God's and Mosnters, Dreamgirls) does a true-to-life job telling the story of Julian Assange, the man who discovered classified and government secrets from around the world and released the information to the general public anonymously. ""The Fifth Estate"" gives us a look at the man and his reasoning for doing what he did. Many believe it was a dangerous thing for Assange to do and others believe that these secrets should have always been released but governments feel that hiding the ""truth"" is in the best interest of the general public.

Josh Singer's (Fringe, The West Wing) adaption of the two books the film is based on ""Inside WikiLeaks: My Time with Julian Assange at the World's Most Dangerous Website"" and ""WikiLeaks: Inside Julian Assange's War on Secrecy"" was amazingly detailed. The depth and intricacies of the characters and how they developed were amazingly intertwined and complex yet interesting to the end.

Another hats off again to Benedict Cumberbatch (Star Trek, Sherlock) who portrays Julian with such gusto and belief that it's hard to feel anything but envy for this determined, smart, real sharp person - genius - who can technologically beat technology. Benedict does such an amazing job with his dialogue, appearance and intensity it makes all the other characters in the film seem to gravitate toward him.

Daniel Bruhl (The Bourne Ultimatum, Inglorious Bastards) plays another up and coming genius who is confounded by Benedict accuracy, detail and intelligence that ultimately he has the moral dilemma of doing the right thing. Or should he? Should he be involved with divulging information that no one should know to the whole world or should he not? Benedict and Daniel have amazing on screen chemistry and gravitas together.

Of course the film is sprinkled with a love interest played by Alicia Vikander (A Royal Affair, Pure) which tends to slow the films pace a little, but the morality of what to do about information that no one is supposed to know is intriguing to say the very least and her character ads a little more color to the morale issues at hand.

I liked the films detail and energy and except for the love interest aspect, the movie will definitely make you question your own moral center. This is a smart film, smartly made. Very well acted by Benedict, this film might just surprise you in more ways the one.",1384300800,3,2386,4.925373134328358
5590447,4,B00BEIYRYM,"""While the film has been receiving a lot of bad press for its contrived storyline and execution, poor direction, absymal box office record (only $3m in the United States to date) and Julian Assange himself not approving of the script claiming it as fabricated, The Fifth Estate, which is technically a film about Daniel Berg's viewpoint about the rise and sort-of fall of Wikileaks was surprisingly genuine, intense, philosophical, and appropriately complex yet it is no masterpiece and it is not an easy watch.

For starters, the performances all are promising and the increasingly famous Benedict Cumberbatch has performed brilliantly as Assange mimicking much of his accent and his bizarre and witty mannerisms. Daniel Bruhl's character as Berg is humanising and serves as a good counterpoint to Assange's might including surprisingly good performances from f***ing Malcolm Tucker (I mean,...Peter Capaldi) and Carice van Houten. The film works on many levels by presenting a multi-perspective story with plenty of locales, events, and characters present that sometimes it is hard to keep up but the element of immediacy and danger within the scandals, political turmoil, and questionable journalism/press-related activities all make for intriguing and intellectually stimulating viewing yet the idea that some of the actualities are hindered by docudrama or uncertain remove some of its excellence here.

This is reminiscent of the trendy topical films that have come out like The Social Network and State of Play, films where technology is the core centre of the narratives. The idea that Assange was a rogue journalist is one of the reasons why this film looked more compelling as a potential Oscar contender (but with its 38% Rotten Tomatoes score, this will not likely be the case) and the opening scenes which involve a montage of sequences showing the evolution of the press and closing scenes which explain about Assange's refuge in an Ecuadorian embassy in London serve to point the audience at the meta-awareness that journalism, ideas, and the press all have its faults. That, by-and-large, were the best scenes (and probably the most celebratory this year in 2013) in the whole film despite it being too explanatory.

A lot goes on in this film but even the little details, the dream sequences which serve to explain the frustrated psyche of Berg and Assange, the excellent choice of music (Amon Tobin, of all things, is featured in a scene where the guys are in Berlin), and the strong cinematography (plenty of shots of Europe in its murky glory) and the humorous moments and mood is immediate and fierce and prefers not to squander for the usual sentimentality and silliness that exists in some Hollywood dramas/thrillers and especially Oscar-nominated dramas too.

Bill Condon, despite his poor record directing the Twilight films recently, has bettered himself this time round with The Fifth Estate and if you thought the bad press and Assange's cover-up of alleged issues he has had with people is all hocus-pocus, why not give it a try but your best bet is to see it on Sky Box Office or TV to avoid being rejected.""",1384041600,2,3138,5.111111111111111
5590448,4,B00BEIYRYM,"First - this movie is worth the price just to watch Benedict Cumberbatch deliver this extraordinary performance.  The scene at Domscheit-Berg's parent's house alone should garner him a nomination.  Second - it's actually quite a good picture with a flawed opening that presumes the audience is already quite familiar with Wikileaks and the story.  Most Americans aren't that familiar and so, we are a bit lost at first.

It's true that the original intention was to do a hatchet job on Assange.  As most know who followed the film's progress, Cumberbatch refused and that's reflected in the picture.  But whatever BS they tried to get away with, it's totally worth the price for what it does deliver: information most Americans don't have.  Our government tried to ban access to the Wikileaks, they seized the site.  How and why that happened is pretty interesting.  As Assange says ""This is information the world needs to know.""

Note: If you go into this movie with pre-existing judgments about the people being portrayed, you're not likely to change your mind. This, at least, is what I'm seeing from the reviews here.

5590451,1,B00BEIYRYM,"Is it just me or is Benedict Cumberbatch taking over the world?  I meant taking it by storm - yeah, that's it.  At this particular point in time, it's difficult to predict what any given person will say when asked which character Benedict Cumberbatch is most well-known for portraying.  The clear frontrunner would have to be as Sherlock Holmes on the BBC/PPS series, Sherlock.  Of course, Star Trek fans might take great offense with that assessment since Cumberbatch is now the face of the beloved villain, Khan Noonien Singh - featured in last summer's blockbuster, Star Trek: Into Darkness.  Over the years, he's also portrayed Stephen Hawking in the TV film, Hawking, lent his voice to The Hobbit franchise, and also continues to dazzle in nearly all forms of entertainment. It's entirely possible that if his trend continues, he could wind up being the biggest actor - not just in Hollywood, but in the entire world.  In his newest film, Cumberbatch portrays the WikiLeaks mastermind, Julian Assange, in The Fifth Estate.

Bill Condon (The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part 1 & 2) directs The Fifth Estate, starring Benedict Cumberbatch as WikiLeaks founder and activist, Julian Assange.  With mutual interest in online activism, Daniel Domscheit-Berg (Daniel Brhl) befriends Assange and together the two begin working on a website devoted to releasing unfiltered information that they believe the general public has a right to know.  At the same time, the website is also designed to protect the source of the information.  These anonymous sources, called whistleblowers, share their information without the fear of jail or consequence. For years, WikiLeaks goes about their business, releasing semi-critical information - until they are submitted a story that will rock the United States government and the rest of the world.  Laura Linney, Stanley Tucci, Anthony Mackie, David Thewlis, and Alicia Vikander also star in supporting roles.

In a Social Network sort of way, The Fifth Estate chronicles the meeting between Julian Assange and Daniel Domscheit-Berg, which eventually turns out to be quite the combative, volatile partnership - also known as the foundation of WikiLeaks.  Eventually, their continuous work together leads and builds up to what we now call ""Cablegate,"" which was a series of document leaks that took place over the span of nearly a year and a half from February 2010 into September 2011.  If you followed the story or even vaguely remember the constant, almost never-ending news cycle, then you probably remember how big of a deal it was at the time.  The leak of these documents sent the United States government, along with several other news organizations and foreign governments into a nervous frenzy - and is still having repercussions today.  However, the magnitude of the situation is hardly captured in this two hour film.  In fact, by the conclusion of this film - it's nearly impossible to find any amount of entertainment whatsoever.

Unfortunately, the characters simply never hit home in this film, often coming off dry and bland as they feed views far too much information in this delegating story, which horribly fails to sell them as the future's ""Woodward and Buernstein (check out All the President's Men).""  While it's nearly impossible to look at Benedict Cumberbatch the same way with white hair, he is about the only thing that stops this film from falling completely on its face.  His deliveries are masterful and although you most likely need a decent amount of background on Julian Assange before you'll understand this biopic, Cumberbatch pulls off the role of a maniacal puppet master in a commendable, breathtaking fashion.  His character's intentions appear to be noble in the beginning, acting as some sort of anonymous online freedom fighter - but as the film progresses, he's painted as someone that goes rogue and well - crazy.  Obviously, the manner in which this film is written is meant to depict him a self-proclaimed revolutionary, but in his own mind, he doesn't fully grasp the consequences of his actions.  In fact, it's hard to see what he hopes to positively accomplish in the first place.

Benedict Cumberbatch and Daniel Brhl present an interesting partnership from their first initial scene together, and it quickly becomes obvious that Cumberbatch will dominant their scenes, yet Brhl, portraying Daniel Domscheit-Berg, still holds his own.  Having recently starred (successfully) in the auto racing film, Rush, Brhl leaves another positive impression, even though his role in this film is reduced to that of a boring, simple-minded follower.  His character believes in the WikiLeaks cause, but eventually sees this media ""monster"" that he's help build snowball into something he can no longer control.  Sadly, this character is used like a punching bag and basically disregarded when he's lost his ambition for the organization's (i.e. Assange's) direction.  In a film that lacks a clear cut message and direction, it is easily recognizable that Domscheit-Berg is supposed to act as a moral ""line"" that shouldn't be crossed.  Once Julian Assange goes too far, Domscheit-Berg is thrust into action and his mission as the ""good guy"" is to stop Assange.

This film operates under the premise, ""give a man a mask and he will tell the truth,"" which makes sense when these characters attempt to share their vision of the world.  Sadly, The Fifth Estate (which has its named explained in the film) does little to stimulate the eyes, ears, or mind - basically making this film a complete waste of time.  For me, being a media junky, the film is historically interesting - but full of bias opinion and judgments.  I would encourage anyone reading this to do your own research after viewing this troublesome film and come to your own conclusions about the events that took place.  There's no black and white answer to whether this film dignifies a view.  However, if you like current events and follow the daily news - this film might be worth a desperate, desperate shot for an at home view.  Even major fans of Benedict Cumberbatch should be weary and proceed with caution before giving this film any attention.  The bottom line is this subject matter makes for bad entertainment, no matter where your opinion lies.

5590453,3,B00BEIYRYM,"Everyone seems to be mad at this movie because everyone who talks about it comes to it with a strong opinion about Julian Assange, and they wanted the film to depict him as a savior or a monster. I didn't have those preconceptions and I enjoyed the film from the opening title sequence. That sequence depicts hands carving hieroglyphics in Ancient Egypt, illuminated manuscripts, the first printing press, newspapers, computers - the myriad ways humans communicate. It's a title sequence Frank Capra would love.

I found ""The Fifth Estate"" intriguing, fun, and moving. Benedict Cumberbatch is very good as Assange. The movie wants you to be impressed by him at first, but slowly to see his feet of clay, and Cumberbatch does that job. Daniel Bruhl plays Daniel Domscheit Berg, Assange's partner. Bruhl expresses disappointed hero worship very well. Assange is invited to Berg's home for dinner, and he disrespects Berg's polite parents. That intimate, believable scene makes you hate Assange in a way that his secret-releasing shenanigans might not.

""The Fifth Estate"" struggles, as all computer-related films do, to depict life on a computer. It creates a fake office with the sky as ceiling where Assange's ""volunteers"" work. Assange describes his submission process at Wikileaks and pages appear onscreen. These visual flourishes are fun.

The movie is interesting and fast-moving but not very deep. There are very big questions at play here and ""The Fifth Estate"" does not engage them deeply. Laura Linney plays Sarah, an American agent whose contact, Tarek, is endangered by Assange's revelations. There is some tension as Tarek flees Libya. Will he get out before Assange outs him, or will he and his family be captured and perhaps tortured by their oppressive government?

Perhaps if ""The Fifth Estate"" had been more art than docudrama it could have gone deeper. Imagine a conversation between Sarah and Assange. One could argue for the importance, both strategic and humanitarian, of state secrets, and the other could argue against. Other questions - aren't secrets inevitable? Accept it: there is stuff you are simply never going to know.

And, in the end, what difference did Assange make? The US is still in Afghanistan. Guantanamo still operates. People will pay more attention to Miley Cyrus twerking than to documents about torture in a Third World nation. Someone said once of the Cambodian genocide that no one will ever read all the documents the Khmer Rouge amassed. No one cares enough to do so.

Laura Linney is every bit the actor that Benedict Cumberbatch is. I'd love to have heard these two characters have this conversation.",1382227200,47,2651,5.096774193548387
5590454,5,B00BEIYRYM,"Julian Assange has the blood of real peace loving freedom fighters and legitimate revolutionaries on his hands. As an American citizen I believe with all my heart in the freedom of the press and personal freedoms championed and codified in our Constitution and Bill of Rights like a holy man believes in God. They are to me an a self evident truth, an article of faith. But that said in our democracy their are safe guards built in where by the people, the electorate have primacy over all state secrets military, diplomatic, etc. We have elected Senators and Congressman and FISA judges who determine what is to be made secret and kept secret and what is to be declassified. We even have whistle blower statutes written into law whereby a whistle blower, may appeal and make plain to the world, again the electorate, through a democratic process what is disgruntling him. Julian Assange was elected by no one. He acts like a petty tyrant he does not believe in democracy. He acted as if he were the Capo de Tutti de Capo of a cult of intelligence and could dictate at the barrel of a key board what was best for what he condescendingly viewed as the unwashed unlettered electorate and what was best for them. Julian Assange thinks of himself as a revolutionary despite the fact that he looks and acts like an effete intellectual who has never seen war, blood spilt let alone been in a fist fight in his entire privileged life. He is a former cult member who just likes attention, it probably impresses some girls, he just wants power. He is the Joseph Goebbels of his time. He is a lune!",1382054400,,1588,4.555944055944056
8567115,4,B00BEIYRYM,"This movie plays better, four years later, than when it came out.  I think a lot of people were thrown by the ambiguity of Assange's portrayal and the disillusionment of Berg, but with everything we now know about Assange's egomania and his willingness to happily provide assistance to a monster like Putin and subvert democracy out of spite, we are all Berg now.  Assange is shown to be a selfish, charismatic creep who doesn't give a s*** about the little guy.  Some of Condon's directorial choices are ham-handed, but the two lead performances, especially Bruhl's, have aged like fine wine.  The coda at the end seems tacked on as a sop to Assange's criticism of the movie, and looking back, the media/public fell for his personal propaganda to sink the film.",1526774400,,762,4.793893129770993

His portrayal of Assange as a tormented pariah who was raised by a family constantly on the run works at times, but the real star is Daniel Bruhl who partnered with Assange early on.",1509235200,2,417,4.791666666666667
