8151001,3,B000JJRY7Y,I was looking for videos to do with my grandchild who is very interested in dance.  I did not understand this was a video for professionals to use to help with their teaching.  Disappointed by my mistake.,1362873600,2,204,4.486486486486487
8151002,3,B000JJRY7Y,"I ordered this DVD for my granddaughter who is 4 years old. She really enjoyed it. Her brother who has been evaluated as autistic watched some of it. It was not what I expected. It is not the type of video that is fun to watch over and over. At four years old, this is how you know the video is enjoyed by smaller children sometimes. I thought the teacher was very good and sincere. She even addressed autistic children. My granddaughter is not autistic. For the price that I paid, I would not recommend it to a friend unless the friend's child was serious about dancing. Although, the teacher in the film said you can never tell who will become a serious dancer. I enjoyed watching the film with my granddaughter.",1210204800,3,714,4.416666666666667
