8351672,2,B002611ZSC,"I bought this DVD because my 20 month old son loves another from this series (Lots & Lots of Monster Trucks). Since this DVD was done by the same company I thought it would be similar. Unfortunately, this one is a bust because it has too much talking and not enough steady paced action.  It has a lot of narration, is very SLOW, and has boring music and sequences.  My son, who loves the music and action in the monster truck video, has no interest in this one.  He loves cars, monster trucks, etc. but this video is over his head.  The narrator is boring and the DVD has too much discussion of the history of each sport (from boat racing to pick-up truck racing and even a part on race cars in history) and other things a preschooler doesn't care about.  He just wanted to watch fast race cars.  There are too many various motor racing sports included on this DVD. Even though it is titled as ""Cars & High speed racers"" its a bit misleading. This DVD is better suited to 6-7 year olds (even they might find it boring).  Very disappointed.",1287878400,,1039,4.324742268041237
