Both Alfonzo and Aliza certainly have the technical abilities, but Alfonzo's style leaves much to be desired. What's with his left hand's movement? The men's shines are very cliche and stuck in 1990's interpretation of LA style salsa more appropriate for a ballroom show than for social dancing. The turns are equally dissapointing.

Regarding Aliza, that's another story. She certainly has the moves, and her teaching is far more useful (for ladies that is) and pleasant to the eye. I would recommend this DVD for beginners and intermediate LADIES so that they can take advantage of Aliza's teaching. That's why I give it 3 starts.

There are far better on-1 salsa productions out there (Salsa Brava when it comes to LA style or Cultural Explosion for NY style.)",1111017600,2,878,4.885906040268456
8031522,5,B0002T46GI,"This video does a great job in breaking down complex salsa steps. Both Alfonso and Aliza have an excellent way of teaching.  They are easy to follow along, look very professional and look very natural in all aspects. I would definitely recommend this DVD to anyone with great enthusiasm and a strong background dancing salsa.",1102377600,,325,4.909090909090909
