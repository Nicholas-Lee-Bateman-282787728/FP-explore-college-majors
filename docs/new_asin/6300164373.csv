211575,5,6300164373,"Excellent video, quality as good as it gets with the movie buget I guess. Watched this on the big screen sometime in 1976 I think, in W. Germany at U.S. Army base at Heidelberg just after visiting a buddy in Naples, Italy. It was really a trip, seeing many of the same locations that I'd just weeks before been at! Don't know if it was ever release over here in U.S,",1386028800,,366,4.169014084507042
211576,5,6300164373,This is a movie that shows how when dealing with terrorist there should be no leaniancy given or shown to them .They should hunt them down like George Kennedy did In this movie and cut them down.,1368230400,,195,4.297297297297297
211577,2,6300164373,"Not to be confused with the Otto Preminger-Graham Greene-Tom Stoppard spy drama, 1975's The ""Human"" Factor is a bit of downmarket Death Wishery that - Charles Bronson being otherwise engaged - George Kennedy managed to fit in between Airports. No mere architect but an electronics expert at a NATO base in Italy, when terrorists kill his family he's able to track down the killers by using John Mills' unfortunately precipitously named 9/11 computer programme while Raf Vallone's portly cop tries hopelessly to stop him doing something he won't regret. There's an odd mix of British and Italian names in the credits - aside from Edward Dmytryk in the director's chair, Barry Sullivan is the most prominent American in the supporting cast while the presence of Canadian Shane Rimmer offers a sure sign that it's a British film (or in this case an Anglo-Italian co-production) pretending to be an American one, and a fairly cheap one at that. Despite a cheesily misleading poster where all the film's key characters are depicted running and firing handguns despite most of them being unarmed through the film, action is thin on the ground and not especially well executed (it doesn't help that Kennedy's stuntman on a rooftop chase is considerably more svelte than him), the photography poor and one of the most notable things about it is that Ennio Morricone recycled his chase music a couple of years later in Exorcist II. A weak film for Dmytryk to end his chequered career on, it does at least offer proof that it's never a good idea to hit George Kennedy with a shovel - it'll only break and then you'll be sorry.

The US DVD includes a decent interview with Kennedy, stills and poster gallery and TV spot, though the print quality - as with the original cinema release prints - is not particularly good.",1292630400,2,1807,4.829032258064516
211578,4,6300164373,"The only thing wrong with this movie is the poor film quality of its foreign production. George Kennedy shines as the bereaved, vengeful father/husband. It truly illustrates the ""human factor"" that will throw the 'monkey wrench' into anybody's plans. There is a great supporting cast. Its subject, terrorists attacking innocent American families, it hauntingly current. Computer people will love the now ancient computer hardware featured as the 'most advanced' in the movie. It is very worth the purchase price and surprisingly timely.",1221436800,,536,5.548780487804878
211579,4,6300164373,"I was looking for a long time and this movie at last found, in those years we were not very familiar with terrorism and I hit a lot when I saw her.

211580,4,6300164373,"The ""Human"" Factor (1975), not to be confused with the 1979 Otto Preminger film of the same name, was directed by Edward Dmytryk (The Devil Commands, Back to Bataan) and stars Academy Award winner George Kennedy (The Dirty Dozen, Cool Hand Luke, The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!) as a character whose family is murdered and becomes obsessed with hunting down their killers ala Charles Bronson in the film Death Wish (1974).  Also appearing is Academy Award winner Sir John Mills (Ryan's Daughter), Raf Vallone (The Godfather Part III), Barry Sullivan (The Great Gatsby), Rita Tushingham (Smashing Time), Arthur Franz (The Atomic Submarine), and Thomas Hunter (Anzio).

As the movie begins we meet John Kinsdale (Kennedy), his wife, and their three, young children, (don't get too attached to the wife and kids) as they're sitting down to breakfast.  Seems John and his brood, all of whom are Americans currently residing in Naples, Italy, where John works as a computer specialist with NATO.  As John leaves home and arrives at work, we learn his work includes programming computerized war games into a system known as `9-11' (which is kinda creepy if you think about it), in an effort to predict probable outcomes so that if a conflict ever does occur, Allied leaders will best know how to deploy their forces in such a way as to minimize losses.  Anyway, as John returns home later that night he probably wishes he hadn't, as his entire family has been brutally murdered, execution style, by a group of unknown assailants (the authorities, at the present, are stumped).  After dealing with various formalities (funeral arrangements, police inquires, etc.), John returns to work, much to the surprise of his co-workers, bent on discovering who's responsible for the massacre.  To this end he begins using the resources available (the sophisticated computer systems utilized in the war games simulations), along with gathering information from various sources acting under the guise of a special investigator (his co-workers, including a character played by John Mills, go along with John, but are concerned about his mental well being).  Eventually John picks up the murderers' trail and learns they're part of some underground, guerilla network with very specific goals, none of which I'll reveal here (you'll just have to see the film).  Anyway, the closer John gets to the killers, the more his obsession for vengeance grows, eventually leading up to a series of violent confrontations as John turns into a one man, ash kicking, wrecking crew, determined to extract his pound (or two) of flesh from those responsible for his loss...

While there's definitely a `Death Wish' theme present here, the story does change things up enough to make this more than just a derivative, run of the mill copycat of that wildly popular feature (after the huge success of Charles Bronson's film there was a glut of Death Wish clones unleashed upon movie going audiences).  The first two thirds of the film does move along slowly as there's a large amount of time spent detailing Frank's efforts in tracking down the killers.  Given the film was shot in the mid 1970s, the computers, technology wise, are purely of the stone age variety, but what's interesting, if you can get past that element, is the fact the theory is still pretty much the same.  I did find this lengthy portion of the film to be engaging even though it really didn't involve a whole lot of action.  Another aspect I liked was the fact the authorities, specifically a character played by Raf Vallone, weren't portrayed as a bunch of incompetent doofuses (or is it doofi?).  Their investigation closely mirrored Frank's, even though both parties were coming at it in different directions.  Give Frank's technological advantage he tended to find things out prior to the police, but they really weren't that far behind.  So why wouldn't Frank share the information with the authorities?  Because he wants to be the one to put the hurting on those responsible, and his brand of justice doesn't include the perpetrators going through a lengthy judicial process, one that might allow them to escape punishment.  There's a definite build up, and once George Kennedy's character is certain who was involved, he brings on the pain.  One action sequence, near the end, has Kennedy, who's like 6'4"", pushing 250 pounds, driving around, crammed into a borrowed VW Bug, following one of the killers.  After awhile he chases the man down, and the pair engage in a battle royale involving a shovel, a switchblade, and a lengthy piece of chain (at one point Frank slaps the man silly with his ginormous mitts)...a word of advice, if you ever get into a fight with George Kennedy, you better bring a gun as sticking him with a knife and beating him with a shovel only seems to make him mad.  Initially I had some reservations about Kennedy in the role of a ordinary man turned vigilante as he seemed a little old for the part and most of what I've seen him in he's played supporting roles, but I thought he did a great job here, especially when he'd get that wild eyed look when talking about or actually confronting the killers.  Probably my favorite sequence comes at the end as Frank, who's about as subtle as a drunken gorilla, crashes (literally) a hostage situation in an effort to take out the rest of the gang in a most excellent finale.  I thought Dmytryk's direction solid, the story interesting and involving, and the performances strong, especially in terms of Kennedy and Vallone.  Another strong aspect is Ennio Morricone's musical scoring which helped keep things lively.  All in all an entertaining, thoughtful vigilante feature that rises above a lot of the dreck that populates the genre.

The DVD case on this Dark Sky Films release states the picture is presented in widescreen anamorphic with an aspect ratio of 1.85:1, but the aspect ratio looked closer to 1.77:1 to me.  Does it matter?  Probably not, but I was slightly disappointed in terms of the picture quality, which seemed soft and a little mushy.  I've purchased a number of Dark Sky Films DVD releases in the past and I've always found the quality to be high, so perhaps they procured the best possible source element they could (I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt).  The movie is definitely watchable, but some of the long shots lack the clarity and detail I've come to expect with the format.  The Dolby Digital 2.0 audio comes through well, with no complaints.  As far as extras there's a great thirty minute piece with George Kennedy titled `The Kennedy Factor: An Interview with George Kennedy', English subtitles, a television spot, and a gallery featuring promotional materials and still shots.

By the way, for those who've seen the film, Frank Avianca, the performer who played Kamal, one of the leaders of the terrorist group, was also one of the producers of the film.",1162857600,10,6946,4.907692307692308
211581,5,6300164373,"Yes, agree with Gregory Rose 100 percent I saw this movie in mid seventies and I am dreaming to own this to show to my whole family. A nice revenge movie.",1161475200,4,154,4.0
211582,5,6300164373,"First, I would like everyone who reads this to know, and it will be obvious, that I am no professional movie critic. I am going to tell you what I perceived the movie to be, and not what it should have been.

I had seen this movie when it first came out in 1975. I was 15 years old at the time and had gone to the theatre with my mom and dad.

 I loved 'Death Wish' with Charles Bronson, and wanted to see another ""bad guy' get his just desserts movie!! Well, I wasn't disappointed. This movie has it all: vengeance (and rightfully so), suspense, etc. George Kennedy was your 'everyday' kind of family man, until he finds entire family slain by terrorists. He then goes off the deep end, and who wouldn't, and tracks them down using his computer skills, and ultimately decimates them all!! Basically, that is the movie in a nutshell. There may be a slower part here and there, but the movie overall moves quickly and deliberately, and the finale is great!!

  If you like revenge/action movies, then this one is for you!!!!",1153785600,12,1023,4.414893617021277
211583,3,6300164373,"Not the greatest film any of the participants made, but has a gutsy feel to it. Similar to other 'revenge' movies... George Kennedy does what we all would do, were it not for the thin veneer of civilisation. I confess, I like this move, despite the shortcomeings. Rare, interesting, but don't spent too much money on it!",1058400000,,320,4.631578947368421
211584,3,6300164373,"WARNING - CONTAINS A FEW SPOILERS!
The movie's story of a computer expert working under contract for NATO in Italy seeking revenge for the murder of his family by terrorists had a lot of potential to work. Especially the somewhat topical and ahead-of-its-time storyline of the villians being Palestinians attacking American military families living in Europe. The cinematography is great, I loved seeing the location shots of Rome and Naples as well. However, largely due to some slow pacing in places, a downbeat tone, the worst musical score Ennio Morricone has ever written(and very repetitive and maudlin at that), some laughable dialogue and an equally laughable climax, this Euro-pudding, filmed in Italy and Pinewood Studios in the UK, almost falls flat but does manage to hold the viewer's attention. George Kennedy unfortunately overacts and contorts his face like a demented fish in places as John Kinsdale, the aforementioned computer expert turned vigilante. The two best performers by far are Raf Vallone(EL CID), as a police inspector, and Sir John Mills(RYAN'S DAUGHTER) as Mike MacAllister, Kinsdale's fellow computer expert who tries to help him by doing some early form of hacking! Rita Tushingham is also present as Janice, a NATO employee who tries to stop Kinsdale's DEATH WISH style revenge ramage. The final shootout in a supermarket, complete with the worst anti-terror ops in movie history, manages to be bloody but entertaining and unintentionally hilarious. Check out the little boy's awestruck face as his hostage mum kills a terrorist, like he's saying WOOOWW! Talk about poor taste. Watch terrorists miss with stunning inaccurate shooting - they attack the tomato soup display and toilet rolls. Those of you that love to laugh at outdated computer 'technology' will also have a whale of a time.
Sample dialogue: (JOHN MILLS): He's found his killers. He doesn't want them in jail. And neither machine nor I can prove just how successful he's going to be!
What a potentially good but silly movie. But somehow this does work and entertain in many ways, and if you bad movie freaks out there want one to rip into for part of a bad movie fest, then this may be for you.",1047945600,,2194,5.046831955922865
