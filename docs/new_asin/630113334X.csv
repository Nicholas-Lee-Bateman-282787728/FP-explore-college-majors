311956,4,630113334X,"If you read the plot line, this may seem like a corny Disney family film, as the American remake was. The original, however, was blessed by sincere honesty, especially in the performances by all, including the director's ten year old son and the aunt & uncle the boy is deposited with for one summer. The eccentric locals are not overdone, the aunt & uncle's gradually revealed nightmare is resolved, and an at times tormenting tomboy girlfriend is humanised, all through the presence of one ten year old outsider. This is a sweet little gem of a movie, as the French do so well. It will remind one of Francois Truffaut and Louis Malle films like Small Change, Murmur of the Heart and Au Revoir Les Enfants. It certainly deserves DVD release.",1098316800,11,742,4.67175572519084
311957,5,630113334X,"This coming of age film represents typical rural life in a small town in France. Supposedly set in 1959, it seems more like the mid 50's. Filmed in 1986 with the director's son at age 10 it paints a canvas of rural French life, litle changed from prewar
provenchialism. Within the film's framework are most of life's circumstances torn open and closed in a delightful manner. This film is a classic not just for the photographic background, but for the intimate story that is woven between strands of hartfull music. This film is one to be viewed again and again. DVD format would be nice.",1056585600,7,589,4.619047619047619
311958,5,630113334X,"A sweet, funny movie that doesn't go for the big laugh or the big dramatic moment, but instead builds slowly to a satisfying ending.

The main chacter is a adolescent boy who has been deposited at the house of one of his mother's friends in the French countryside for the summer until the some family problems can get resolved.

There are some problems there as well, but his engaging personality sees him and his host family through the summer, with everyone learning something along the way.

Great movie - be a little patient while watching, and you will be rewarded!

It is rare that I see a movie multiple times, but I have seen this movie 5 times - once in the cinema, and four times on video (where is the English-subtitled DVD from the studio, I ask impatiently). As you may surmise, I really like this movie.",998092800,,817,4.5
312017,5,630113334X,"This is one of those stories about children that European filmmakers typically do a better job of than Americans. There's no gloss or phoniness, just real kids in real situations who sometimes observe real adult relationships. There was just one drawback for me and that was the cunnilingus and coitus scene with the young lovers, which was secretly observed by the kids. It was not done in an X-rated fashion but was seen from some distance and was very naturally portrayed. But I'm uncomfortable having it in my library for reasons I'll not relate here. I include the comment just as a heads-up for prospective buyers.",1315526400,,620,4.8584905660377355
312018,5,630113334X,"I agree with the wonderful descriptions and praise of the reviews already written at this website for LE GRAND CHEMIN.
The geographical and cultural settings of this story seem initially so simple and almost uninteresting.  As the story evolves even the characters with minor parts are unique and memorable. The little boy and his hosting ""uncle"" and ""aunt"" come from the 1950's life of France, but they as well as the residents of this small village in the French countryside are - in many ways - many of us. So, how much longer must an eager public wait for a DVD version of this film?!?",1277596800,,589,4.609523809523809
312019,5,630113334X,"The Grand Highway, (Le Grand Chemin)
french with subtitle. A very good movie.  I'm suprised that there are no DVD/s I would give this movie a 5 star.",1252108800,,149,4.321428571428571
312020,5,630113334X,I love this movie. I was delightfully surprised to discover it on cable TV a few years back.  I grew up in France in the 50s and Grand Chemin is absolutely true to that era.  It brought back many happy memories of those years when I was shipped off to my aunt and uncle's house in the south of France where I spent the lazy days of summer making new friends and experiencing  similar adventures as Grand Chemin's characters do.  I highly recommend the movie and can't wait to see it on DVD.,1234396800,4,490,4.236559139784946
312021,5,630113334X,"I saw this film years ago on Canadian TV by accident while a student living in Buffalo. The two children are incredible, and the adults are equally strong.  I found the whole coming-of-age story very touching and completely believable.  One of my all-time favorite films...  I will add my vote for a DVD or HD DVD release as this one is about as deserving as a film can be.",1190937600,5,373,4.3768115942028984
312022,5,630113334X,"The DVD version is available but, unfortunately, it is Region 2 only (Europe) so you will need to have a region-free player or software and, perhaps more importantly for non-francophones, it lacks both English subtitles and dubbing (bien sur!). so you may well struggle with the dialogue. The French can be so indifferent... Beautifully photographed and thus greatly benefits from DVD as opposed to VHS. Available from Amazon.fr",1174953600,6,428,5.3088235294117645
312023,5,630113334X,"I saw this beautiful, touching film for the first time about 9 years ago. I taped it off of cable and have watched it so many times that the tape is worn out. I too am waiting for this wonderful tale of friendship, heart-ache, acceptance, and love to come to DVD. I hope whoever can make that happen, will decide to do it real soon because I'll be first in cyber-line to buy it. This was the first full length foreign film with sub-titles that I ever watched from beginning to end. This movie began my love affair with French cinema and strangely enough, came at a time when I made an aquaintance with a beautiful family in the Alsace-Lorraine region of France. Today, they are as close as my own family and I have taught myself how to read and write French. I still have not managed to finish this movie with-out shedding a kleenex full of tears at the touching ending. While I no longer need to read the sub-titles to understand what's being said, Le Grand Chemin needs no translation. It is a film that speaks loudly of Love in all languages. Don't miss it!..... Please release this one on DVD !!",1135468800,15,1099,4.365853658536586
312024,5,630113334X,"I watch this film continuously....I wish my copy contained English dub, as the white subtitles cover crucial areas of the picture and is annoying.  'Paradise' cannot compare, particularly with the presentation and appearance Vanessa Guedj gives us.

This film is long overdue for DVD, an I would love to obtain a clear, unobstructed copy.

I would like correspondence with fans of this great film.  I have a deteriorated VHS copy, and the film is hard to obtain as it is.

312025,5,630113334X,"Grand Chemin is a great movie. It's a story of frienship, love and growing up. It's about time this movie is brought to DVD, so we don't have to suffer with the American version, ""Paradise.""",1122336000,9,190,4.457142857142857
312026,5,630113334X,"I, also, saw this little gem years ago.  I watched it over and over when it came to cable and then lost track of it.  Thank goodness, I have found it again and as another reviewer stated it is well worth putting onto DVD.

If you've not seen it nor heard of it, it is worth your while to go out of your way to find it.

At 75 I should recognize something extraordinary when I see it.

Please, let us enjoy it on DVD in the near future.",1104537600,8,435,3.842696629213483

7809675,2,630113334X,"This is not about the film it's about the DVD quality.

Subject: DVD of Le Grand Chemin from Editions Montparnasse

The colors are excellent and the sound has been remastered. But it is not widescreen (1.77). The aspect ratio has been chopped down to 1.33 (4x3), diminishing the effect of the films most dramatic scene. And there are no subtitles, not even French. So there is still something to be said for the laser disc issued by image in 1988.",1415750400,2,447,4.575
7809676,5,630113334X,"I'm originated from France and this was one of my best film ever (after Le grand Bleu (Big Blue from Luc Besson) )
The story is amazingly old and surprinsigly so actual.

The pictures are.... wow....

The actors are... wow...

The story is... wow...

This is exactly what movies are made for.

A very exciting journey in a little french family in a little french village.

Prepare your kleenex, you will laugh and cry at the same time.

Pour les nostalgiques de la vie franaise, un petit bijou &agrave; regarder, sans se priver. Un achat que vous ne regretterez pas. (il ne s'agit pas d'un film de science fiction ou &agrave; grand d&eacute;ploiement d'effets sp&eacute;ciaux !)",1405814400,,678,4.793103448275862
7809677,5,630113334X,"This film is a very frank and humorous view life in a French country village in the 1950s, seen from the point of view of two children (age 9 and 10) who are trying to make sense of the adult world they see around them.  The film also has a spiritual dimension because the actions of the two children ultimately cause a badly dysfunctional marriage to come ""unstuck"" and enter into fulfillment.",1394409600,,394,4.472222222222222
7809678,5,630113334X,I haven't seen this movie in such a long time but I definitely remember it fondly. One of the best movies I've ever had the pleasure to have seen.

7809679,5,630113334X,"This movie should be released on DVD in Region 1 so that those of us in the US and Canada can see it.  It's just a wonderful, well acted, well directed and more than that, well shot movie.  I saw it years ago when it was played on French Canadian TV and absolutely fell in love with the story.  Almost everyone can relate to it.

If you can get the Region 1 DVD or see it on a region free DVD player you will understand what I mean.  It's excellent.",1356912000,,449,3.9444444444444446

Really one of the most heart-warming and tear-jerking films i've ever seen.  I've had it on my wish list for a friend (and myself) literally for years.

Please!  Somebody re-release this in digital format so that the Americas can watch!",1354752000,,340,4.435483870967742
