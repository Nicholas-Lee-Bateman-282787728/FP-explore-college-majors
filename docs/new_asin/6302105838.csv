This episode is  known for one thing and one thing only: Data has sex with Tasha. This act  (which takes place off-screen) is so monumental that an entire fandom is  built around its singular occurence. We're talking this is the one where we  find out just what the term ""fully functional"" actually  MEANS.
In short, everybody on the Enterprise is ""intoxicated""  by some sort of space disease that makes them lose control and do all sorts  of things their sickeningly goody-goody selves secretly want to do but  repress. Picard and Crusher get all het up. Wesley takes over the ship.  Troi babbles about being One with Riker's Mind. (Why? I don't know. The man  is as dumb as a box of rocks.) And, of course, Data and Tasha do the Wild  Thing. The Enterprise is then threatened by a Deadly Situation -- the  nature of which is so inane it escapes me -- and Crusher races against time  to find a cure for the intoxication before the ship explodes or the pan  comes for them or something. She finds the cure just in the nick of time  and Wesley saves the day. Of course. Then, repressed and back to normal,  Tasha says to Data: ""It Never Happened.""
Sure, sociologists  write about ""Naked Now"" in clinical terms but we all know why  they REALLY watch it.
A must-own for all Data fans.
Whenever I need a  dose of Star Trek Therapy, I plug ""Naked Now"" into the VCR and  watch the entire crew of the Enterprise go gonzo. Makes me see just how in  control my life actually IS.",951004800,16,1645,4.398671096345515

7820968,2,6302105838,"Really painful redo of the classic episode The Naked Time from TOS. But while that episode was done very well, this one fails in every way possible. I give it two stars because of the effects. That's all. And what really stood out is that this crew has no chemistry whatsoever. And while Patrick Stewart is very good as a commanding figure, he falls well short in attempts at comedy.",1407110400,,383,4.485714285714286
7820969,2,6302105838,"I'm a huge TNG fan, but this show really didn't take off until the third season. But a some of First Season episodes were really good,like Where No One Has Gone Before, The Big Goodbye,The Battle, and Conspiracy. This episode isn't one of them. I gave it some slack for it being the first hour long show, and the actors were still not used to their characters. But still compared with the later episodes, this episode is just weak.",1106006400,,431,4.468354430379747
7820970,3,6302105838,"The third episode, ""The Naked Now"", is the sequel to the Original Series episode, ""The Naked Time."" The story opens with a Federation science vessel, the U.S.S. Tsiolkovsky, studying a star, on the verge of going supernova.  During the mission, the crew of the ship is exhibiting strange behavior, until one person of the crew blows a emergency hatch, killing the Tsiolkovsky's entire crew. The U.S.S. Enterprise is ordered to investigate, and finds that most of the crew are frozen, someone has been playing with the environmental controls, letting the heat suck out into space. Not long after, Geordi complains that Sickbay is too hot. It prompts Dr. Crusher to keep Geordi under observation.
Slowly, more crewmembers fall prey to the same strange feelings, prior to the Tsiolkovsky crew's deaths.",1058054400,,799,5.1461538461538465
7820971,3,6302105838,"A considerably huge misstep for the second episode, this obvious remake of the original series show 'The Naked Time' should have been saved for a later telecast.  We barely get an introduction to the characters in the series pilot and now they are all going to act out of character!  Too many scenes from the original are incorporated into this show as well; the frosted and iced over crew quarters; finding a clothed person taking a shower; crewmembers who appear to have committed suicide; the ship is even commandeered by Wesley who takes over as captain in much the same way Lt. Riley does in the original series episode.  Even though there is an entirely new set of main characters present there is very little variance from the original.
Actually, to be fair, this version of the story is slightly better in that there is more humor present and some of the crew flamboyantly exhibits patently amorous behavior, a sign of the times.  People are shown as losing their inhibitions much more effectively and in a broader sense.  In the mid 60's when 'The Naked Time' aired the censors would hardly have allowed the characters to speak so frankly, specifically the scene between Data and Tasha Yar in her quarters; their conversation would have been completely excised in the earlier version.  On the other hand the flirtation between Picard and Crusher seems almost like a spoof and doesn't come off with the humor intended; in fact it's so tame it seems to belong more appropriately in the original version!
Getting back to my original observation, too many of the first season episodes were either remakes or reworkings of familiar shows from the original series.  Including this remake there was also 'Hide And Q' that was a thinly camouflaged rewrite of 'Where No Man Has Gone Before' and shortly afterward 'The Last Outpost' aired that had plot elements strongly reminiscent of 'That Which Survives'; a few more copycat shows followed that any venerable Trekkie can recognize.  Once they got away from aping the earlier series though ST: TNG succeeded grandly on it's own terms.  And don't get me wrong; it's not that any of those shows were bad - in fact both shows I cited were excellent first season entries - it's just that the creative staff couldn't have been this desperate and lacking of fresh ideas.  The Enterprise was just embarking on a new mission into an uncharted area of the galaxy.  C'mon!  This should be an area of infinite wonders and amazements, not recycled plots!",1045353600,,2493,4.826291079812207
7820972,5,6302105838,"Don't let the fact that this episode was taken from the excellent Original Series episode ""The Naked Time"" fool you!  This is the funniest, and I mean, FUNNIEST, star trek episode of all time, with phenomenal acting involved from all cast members.  The limerick Data gives to Picard about the person from Venus having a big you-know-what is TIMELESS!  Being such a huge Captain Picard fan, his acting in this episode made me think to myself, ""Was he on drugs before he read the script?""  Superb acting!
For example, just look at the scene where he and Dr. Crusher are in the ready room discussing the virus and those infected.  When Picard and Crusher get really close to each other face-to-face, I MUST ASK YOU ALL THIS QUESTION:  what is the sound Picard makes coming from his throat???  You actually see his throat move a bit and something like ""huhuhuhuhuhu"" comes out.  It can't be a laugh because it's misplaced.  The sound just doesn't fit there!!  If anyone can give me a reason for this, I'd LOVE to know!
The only other episode that can compare with this episode is ""Chain of Command Parts 1 and 2.""  Just listening to Picard screaming out, ""THERE ARE 4 LIGHTS!"" is hysterical!  When he gets shocked by the implanted device is also quite classic!
All in all, ""The Naked Now"" ranks NUMBER 3 on my Top 10 TNG Episodes, right behind ""The Best of the Both Worlds"" and ""Chain of Command.""  TERRIFIC!",1041120000,,1404,4.590361445783133
7820973,5,6302105838,"This episode is based on ""The Naked Time"", an Original Series show about the Psi 2000 virus.  It all starts when the USS Enterprise is distracted by a series of distress calls from the S.S. Tsiokovsky, indicating something has gone wrong aboard that starship.  When Geordi touches a frozen woman on that ship, he brings back an undetected virus that spreads at a rapid rate, and soon the crew have to fight their mischevious side and rescue the ship from a chunk of a star's surface.  Will they make it?
You'll find the answer to this question and many more if you watch this exciting episode.",1020470400,2,593,4.5754716981132075
7820974,3,6302105838,"The Enterprise is on a mission to locate the USS Tsiolkowsky. Shortly after they arrive, the whole crew are dead and the cause is soon discovered to be a virus. With similar affects to alcohol, the bacteria is soon loose aboard the Enterprise and it is up to Doctor Crusher to develop a cure before the crew meet the same fate as those aboard the Tsiolkowsky.
This episode was apparently a copy of the Original Series' ""The Naked Time"". I wouldn't know, having never seen it and not really being a TOS fan. However, The Naked Now itself is a sub-standard TNG episode that was a very strange choice for the series first outing to follow the pilot. How can we really care about what's happening to the characters when, as yet, we don't even really know or understand them? The infamous ""fully-functional"" scene between Data and Tasha Yar is one of the only highlights. Naturally, Wesley saves the day and Tasha makes it quite clear to the android that there won't be a repeat of their actions: ""Data...It never happened"" (I was always sorry that Yar was killed off so early at the end of season one - to me she was the strongest of the female characters and her death meant we had to wait five years until the appearances of Kira and Dax in DS9. Besides... she was my favourite character). Apart from that, this is a fairly average episode that is probably more for the collectors than anyone else.

Spoiler Alert!
Data and the crew come under the influence of an alien virus in this episode.  The is the one where Data and Tasha have their wild fling in her quarters.  As in the original episode; all the inner feelings of the crew surface in a retread that's entertaining.  Though the plot is similar to the original; we know that this is not the ship James T. Kirk would captain.  He'd put Data in the brig for insubordination.  Picard proves to be more of a father figure and tolerant of people's differences.",976752000,,538,4.505154639175258
