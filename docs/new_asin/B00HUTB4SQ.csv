6225018,5,B00HUTB4SQ,great tv show....,1411084800,,17,5.0
6225019,5,B00HUTB4SQ,What a great show. They don't make shows like this anymore.,1409875200,,59,4.454545454545454
6225020,5,B00HUTB4SQ,This show is better than I remembered. Eddie has some great lines and Bixby at his best.,1408320000,,88,4.235294117647059
6225021,5,B00HUTB4SQ,This was a great show. It's too bad the didn't give it one more season to have more closure. I was very glad to find this on Amazon for a great price!,1401494400,2,150,3.71875
6225022,2,B00HUTB4SQ,"We didn't care for season 3.  Very liberal views and nine year old school play where the kids are expected to kiss.  Season 1 and 2 were very good, but this season 3 was very disappointing.",1399939200,3,189,4.222222222222222
6225023,5,B00HUTB4SQ,"I grew up watching this cute and funny show. A show about a recently widowed father and his young son. The chemistry between Bixby and Cruz are really what make this show such a treat. Of course the supporting cast is also good with Mrs. Livingston the Asian housekeeper, Uncle Norman and Tina two friends of the two. Even the dated late 60's theme doesn't hurt this show because the real values haven't changed or at least they shouldn't have.

The show holds up surprisingly well and all 24 first season episodes are here on this four disc set. They look quite good too and it doesn't appear that anything is cut out as they run around 26 minutes each. The theme song is also unforgettable and is an important part of the lead in for each episode. Nilsson wrote and performs the catchy number and he adds variations of the theme throughout the episodes.

This is the  weakest season only because Eddie seemed to be growing up fast, but there is plenty to like about season 3.

If you've been looking for this show look no further as this is about as good as it's going to get. WB released the other two seasons, It's a bit expensive, but I really enjoyed seeing this again. ......people let me tell ya 'bout my best friend!",1399593600,4,1225,4.431111111111111
6225024,5,B00HUTB4SQ,"Courtship of Eddie's Father was my favorite television show to watch in the early 1970's.  The friendship between father and son seemed very natural and genuine in the show and I always loved to listen to Mrs. Livingston speak to Eddie and share stories of Japan.  This was a charming show that had a simple message, love for family.  I hoped for a long time they would release this show to DVD and began to doubt it would ever happen.  I urge any fans of the show to purchase all 3 seasons on DVD before they disappear.  This show is one of those gems of the past you want to treasure and keep in your DVD collection.",1397520000,5,618,4.247863247863248
6225025,5,B00HUTB4SQ,"This is without a doubt one of the best tv shows of all time.  The story, character development, acting and especially the bond that is shown between father and son is amazing, precious and all too rare in television or real life.
I can't recommend this show highly enough!  Do yourself a favor and purchase all 3 seasons while you still can. You will not be disappointed.",1396656000,2,372,4.537313432835821
6225026,1,B00HUTB4SQ,"The second disk of this set was bad and does not play properly.  Of course I buy lots of dvd's and sometimes don't play them before the return period expires, so I am stuck with a bad disk.  Very poor quality control.  Do not recommend risking this item, or other items from this manufacturer.",1395964800,2,293,4.388888888888889

6225039,5,B00HUTB4SQ,"This is one of the few great TV shows of all time. Bill Bixby as Tom Corbett Eddies father, Brandon Cruz, as Eddie, and of course the graceful Miyoshi Umeki as the beloved Mrs. Livingston. If you have never seen all three seasons you will want to get them and sit back and enjoy them all.",1445817600,,288,4.160714285714286
