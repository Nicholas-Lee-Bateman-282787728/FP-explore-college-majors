7776565,5,B01H4FJR5W,This movie is awesome and I do believe any fan of Tarzan will walk away with a big smile on their face. I can't wait to add this movie to my collection and I hope we get a sequel to Tarzan!,1467590400,,189,3.6341463414634148
7776566,3,B01H4FJR5W,"Temptation might entice us into dismissing ""The Legend of Tarzan"" as just more century old rubbish trotted out to plump up the dying husk  of some antique pulp fiction phantasmagoria from the prolific pen of word-slinger Edger Rice Burroughs.  Should we just give right in to that temptation?  I argue that the one hundred and eighty million dollars spent on the making of the film grants it some shred of dignity.  But we have other reasons as well.
 The very idea of a jungle boy seems silly in our modern world.  A boy raised by the apes would have all sorts of developmental issues, we think.  But in 1912 when Burroughs wrote the first of 26 Tarzan books that modern sensibility had yet to evolve.  In any case, it had enough plausibility that his readers took the idea seriously, or at least with enough seriousness to plunk down the coins to buy the book, and the next and the next.  If the idea of a jungle boy, an ape man, a king of the jungle has a tired and dusty feel to it, the social phenomenon of Tarzan must be dealt with on an adult basis.  After all, how many super heroes have a town named after him?  Yep, Tarzana California takes it's name from the Burroughs ranch of the same name.
 We also have some well known and acclaimed actors, and also some very attractive actors to play the leading roles of  Tarzan and Jane.  Two Oscar winners  appear.  Jim Brodbent plays a small role as the British PM.  He once took home the gilded gee gaw for best supporting actor.  The villain in the story is played by Christiphe Waltz who did the same, twice.  Samuel L. Jackson and African actor Djimon Hounsou have both been nominated for that same honor.  And Alexander Skarsgard as Tarzan and Margot Robbie as Jane are just about as attractive as it is possible as human beings to get.  Good actors too, the both of them and that always helps a movie.  Skarsgard looks like his body has been created by the special effects people, but no, he suffered months of grueling, painful gym work to get a body that we actually think could swing from vine to vine with ease.
 Another thing we should take to heart when totaling up the reasons to appreciate this film has to be the director, David Yates.  Yates has taken home three Oscars for various Harry Potter films.  Those films also had fantasy novels as their basis.  Yates took that material and did well by the material and by the viewing public, putting out a series of magical films.  The two writers, Adam Cozad and Craig Brewer, both have written interesting and watchable scripts.
 And we almost had a real winner here too.  A lot of stuff, the growing up with apes stuff, the swinging from tree to tree stuff, although impossible we can accept for the sake of the movie.  When we have indigenous people appearing together in the same scene even if they live a couple of thousand miles apart, well ok, Africa is bigger than most people know.  Ditto in having plains animals destroy a town in the rain forest.
 What lost the thread for me, and this not until the end-I was happy to go along with things until the last few minutes- was the stark historical stupidity we were asked to swallow.  In history the Belgian King Leopold established a hell on earth in the Congo.  In the film, a buffalo stampede organized by Tarzan sweeps the bad Belgian officials out of the territory, restoring the land to peace and plenty.  Pish.  The Belgian Congo staggered on for another 70 years with varying levels of horror.  Better we had a real life Tarzan . But better the movie makers to have cast the scale of the story small enough for us to see a smaller victory, a local victory perhaps, but the all inclusive triumph of good over genuine evil on a grand scale just couldn't hold up.  Burroughs wrote 26 Tarzan books, he didn't try to solve a continental sized problem in one episode.  Even if the bad guy did come to a colorful and well deserved end.  Even if Tarzan is really cool and ripped like an Olympic champion.  Even if the mom ape seems to love little baby Tarzan.
 Maybe we have a simple answer.  The Potter books might be thought of by many readers as at least being in the same stadium as literature.  No reader of Edger Rice Burroughs would make that claim.
 The huge effort and great talent that went into making ""The Legend of Tarzan"" results in a sub par two and a half saw blades.  The producers will sweat this one out as it took in only $56 million wold wide (update-final world wide gross is $356 million) on the way to clawing back the huge $180 million budget.  The PG-13 film runs for on hour and 49 minutes.
 On the up side, the actors all do well, Skarsgard and Robbie in particular have some great moments, and will be back again in better films.  The director will not suffer this bump in his career, not after three Oscars.  And the film has an epic, awesome beauty to it that we like.  But the producers, ah those scalawags, the producers will suffer.",1467504000,6,4938,4.431111111111111
7776567,5,B01H4FJR5W,"This movie is awesome!!  My whole family loves it!

The critics are wrong... It is a stunning movie.

I recommend seeing it in a theater on the big screen while you can because the visual effects are mind blowing.

We will definitely purchase this movie on disc when it is available.",1467504000,54,283,4.490196078431373
7776568,5,B01H4FJR5W,"Tarzan is not only a popular character, but his story just so happens to be a favorite of mine. Edgar Rice Burroughs's story has seen many adaptations up to this point, and now, Warner Bros. has given us The Legend of Tarzan.

I feel that movie adaptations can either be really good or really bad; depending on two common key factors. They are: the acknowledging of source material and still being able to maintain a cohesive plot throughout.
 And actually, The Legend of Tarzan does a pretty nice job doing just that. Granted, there are some minor issues that I'll touch on in a minute, but for now, I'll discuss the positives. I wasn't expecting much from Alexander Skarsgard as Tarzan, but he does a surprisingly good job as the character during the movie. His fellow co-star Samuel L. Jackson stars as George Williams; providing the movie with some much needed comic relief. Margot Robbie's talents don't falter here either; she does a fantastic job as Jane. I also feel she and Alexander Skarsgard shared some really good chemistry. Whenever they are together or share an intimate touch, you truly feel as though they are a couple. Djimon Hounsou also does a pretty nice job as Chief Mbonga.

As one might expect, much of the movie is spent in the jungle; and The Legend of Tarzan has nice scenery to add to its positives as a movie. Though the movie is not considerably lengthy, David Yates's directorial talents do not feel wasted; because the movie is thoroughly entertaining.

It is without question that Christoph Waltz is a fine actor; though he admittedly isn't nearly as interesting to watch as he has been in some of his previous films. And though a few scenes did feel rushed, I personally thoroughly enjoyed The Legend of Tarzan. Its well acted(despite a rather mediocre outing from Christoph Waltz), and above all else it is a highly entertaining film. Its safe to say The Legend of Tarzan is definitely worth seeing.",1467504000,35,1934,4.747023809523809
7776569,4,B01H4FJR5W,"Saw this movie in glorious Imax 3D last night with a large number of people, ranging from age 12 to 55, and all of us loved this film.
Beautiful, awesome cinematography, to excellent CGI that rivals the latest Planet of the apes movies, LOT will take you on a breathtaking adventure that we filmgoers have never seen before, despite all the past Tarzan films, and films like it. LOT had the WOW factor going for it sometimes.
Everyone agreed in our group that not only was this top notch quality entertainment, but all of us instantly wanted to see it again, and would love to see numerous sequels.",1467504000,4,598,4.546296296296297
7776570,4,B01H4FJR5W,"I too liked Tarzan it was solid movie entertainment. Critics got this one wrong.  I walked in expecting to be disappointed based on reviews and sat through the movie with a huge smile on my face.  Im planning on seeing it a second time.  All the actors were great and Samuel L. Jackson was a nice surprise.  Story was strong, editing was great, CGI was great and the animals looked AWESOME.  Dont listen to the critics because Tarzan is like watching an adult version of the Jungle Book.  Director David Yates III  made a great summer movie.",1467504000,6,541,4.515463917525773
7776571,4,B01H4FJR5W,"I've loved all things Tarzan since I was a small child. I watched the black and white tv show when I was growing up in the 90s and loved it. The Disney animated movie is still one of my all time favorites, so you can imagine I was extremely excited about this live action movie.

It certainly did not disappoint. I wish the movie had been longer as it seemed a bit short and rushed to me. The acting was wonderful, but I did feel that a few actors (Djimon Honsou particularly) were underused. The visuals were absolutely stunning, and everything involving the gorillas was excellent. My biggest issue was the story. The story was weak and short, and it seemed that the filmmakers were more interested in the look of the film than the substance.

That being said, I enjoyed the heck out of this movie and will probably buy it. If you've grown up loving Tarzan, then you might find something in this for you. I think there is a lot to love here. Margot Robbie and Alexander Skarsgard are the perfect Jane and Tarzan, and they are beautiful together. I believe their love story 100%. Give this movie a try and I'm sure you will not be disappointed.",1467417600,9,1145,4.421800947867299
7776572,4,B01H4FJR5W,"The Good:
You can tell right off the bat this movie was intentially made to be seen in 3D. There are only one or two ""in your face"" moments with the 3D, but the biggest accomplishment of the 3D effects was to add depth to what you see. If you're afraid of heights, you may slightly hold your breath a few times during the great camera angles as Tarzan swings through the jungle.

Rather than giving us the same old Tarzan origin story, this film is a bit of a prequel and sequel all in one. We're reminded of Tarzan's past through periodic flashbacks. It was also nice how the majority of the film takes place with a more ""civilized"" Tarzan about a decade after leaving he jungle.

Alexander Skarsgrd really looks and sounds the part (even though he wasn't given many lines). It's kind of hard to imagine anyone else playing a better Tarzan from this point.  Christoph Waltz (plays, ""Leon Rom"") delivers the great level of acting we've come to expect as the villain.  Samuel L. Jackson (who plays George Washington Williams) served as the entertaining comic relief of the film.

The action and fight scenes were also a highlight. It was cool to see Tarzan display his ""wild"" fighting style against animals or humans.

The Bad:
While Skarsgard and Jackson shared some nice on screen chemistry, there were moments where it simply felt a little cheesy. (Remember those corny lines from buddy-cop movies?) Besides that, we understand that Tarzan has a unique relationship with animals, but the ending seemed to push it a little too far in my opinion.

Now I don't know if this is truly a ""Bad"" or not, so you can decide for yourself. There is a bit of a concern as to whether this movie fell victim to playing the ""White Savior"" role yet again. I won't go into too much detail, but I will only say that IF the African Slave Trade was something that was highlighted in Tarzan novels, then there is no issue here at all. However, if Hollywood interjected slavery into this film, to prop up Tarzan, then that's a bit problematic in my opinion. (I have not read the novels so make of this point whatever you like.)

The Reason:
I thought this was a good adaptation of the classic tale. It's probably fair to say that it's one of the best Tarzan films to date. I can't say that anything in this film necessarily wow'd me, but I was entertained the whole time. If you happen to have a 3D Tv, you'll probably enjoy this the most. I think the film takes a bit of a hit without the 3D element.

The Rating: 7.5/10",1467417600,12,2500,4.452954048140044

It is clear that the writers have the same amount of knowledge about the subject matter as my cat.  They probably saw the animated Tarzan and went from there.  No, I take that back, the animation never did this amount of disservice to the character.  If you like the books, you will find this version truly abhorrent.

As an analogy, lets say someone remade the Terminator, then had the Terminator repeatedly getting beaten up by humans.  That is what you have here.",1512086400,,552,4.639175257731959

Interesting visual effects, albeit too much cd'ed (which is why I didn't 5star), & anyway it's how every action movie is now made...right? Alexander Skarsgard's dry, witty acting abilities were amusing (with/without his shirt) although his British accent was a bit muddled. The rest of the cast were charming, but Djimon Hounsou is always outstanding. This movie, even tho it's an 'action flick', does drive the point home of how we, aka human beings, both in the past & the present still have complete & utter disregard of our planet's environment & its inhabitants. Sadly the song remains the same & has even worsened in the present as we continue to destroy our environment & completely disregard our gift of humanity as we constantly make war upon each other. Now that said, this movie also provides an interesting insight regarding how people (past/present) still interact by revealing our feelings regarding our weaknesses & strengths, our hatreds & fears, yet more importantly, our capability to love.

This movie has strong elements of books #2 and #3. Burroughs never intended for Tarzan to be a one dimensional ""jungle"" character - and by all the approved Tarzan adaptations - he intended for Tarzan to live on in many imaginative stories. JUST WAIT TILL FOLKS FIND OUT THAT TARZAN ACTUALLY BATTLES A LOST WORLD OF PREHISTORIC CREATURES! lol Boy, will amateur critics flip then! Because of Disney, most folks don't realize that 1) Jane Porter is American, 2) Tarzan did NOT get the girl at the end of the original story, 3) Tarzan sacrificed claiming his true identity so Jane could marry his cousin William Clayton - whose life Tarzan also saved for Jane's sake, 4) Jane was always feisty in the books, 5) Tarzan and Jane don't marry till the end of the second book in a double wedding officiated by Jane's father.

7776780,4,B01H4FJR5W,"The movie loses credibility by creating the unnecessary character of an African-American U.S. Ambassador (Samuel L. Jackson) who talks Greystoke (Alexander Skarsgard) into returning to the Congo then accompanies Greystoke & his American wife to the Congo.

In fact Lincoln's son, Robert Todd Lincoln, was Benjamin Harrison's U.S. Ambassador to UK from May 25, 1889 to May 4, 1893.

While Benjamin Harrison was U.S. President (March 4,1889 - March 4, 1893) there was no Negro serving as U.S. Ambassador to the U.K. (aka Court of St. James).  Since President Grant the USA has had Negro diplomats usually to former slave colonies or Africa, but no Negro has ever served as U.S. Ambassador to the U.K.

As a reward for supporting Grant's attempt to annex Santo Domingo aka the Dominican Republic in order to move former slaves there, Grant did make former slave Frederick Douglass his charg d'affaires to the Dominican Republic.

Ironically an Englishman & a European-American woman are more at home & at ease in Africa than an African-American man

Perhaps Samuel L. Jackson's best performance

Alexander Skarsgard performance stands out as does Christopher Waltz",1505347200,,1161,5.209677419354839

7776806,4,B01H4FJR5W,"Every few years I re-read E.R. Burroughs' twenty-four volumes chronicling the astonishing exploits of Tarzan the Ape-Man. This stuff comprises some of the most enjoyable reading experiences I had as a kid. I knew early on that cinema took a harsh swerve in its interpretation of the mighty-thewed Tarmangani. As fantastic as his first few Tarzan movies were, as iconic as he became, Johnny Weissmuller had much to answer for. It was he, more than anyone else, who sunk into pop culture the notion of a Tarzan who spoke like a two-year-old child.

So now here's 2016's THE LEGEND OF TARZAN, a movie that strives to course-correct, somewhat. More than any other film adaptation - yes, even more than the clunky GREYSTOKE from 1984 - THE LEGEND OF TARZAN does honor to the source material. From jump, it presents Tarzan as an articulate Englishman, equally at home whether at his lordly estates or in the deepest jungle. For that alone, the movie gets a pass from me, never mind that I do have some beef with it.

The plot devotes the first 15-20 minutes to getting the now-domesticated ape-man back to the Dark Continent. It also takes the time to establish its historical backdrop. So, check this: At the Berlin Conference of 1884, the world's colonial powers divvied up the African Congo, with King Leopold II of Belgium snatching for himself the vast Congo basin, replete in minerals and ivory. But, five years later, Leopold had ran up enormous debts in the exploitation of his newest colony. To fund his army, he dispatches his envoy, the well-mannered psychopath Lon Rom (Christoph Waltz), to secure the fabled diamonds of Opar.

It's been eight years since the ape-man (Alexander Skarsgrd) left his jungle home to live in Victorian England with his wife Jane (Margot Robbie). In London, he's got it made in the shade. He'd claimed his heritage and, as John Clayton III, had assumed his rightful title of fifth Earl of Greystoke, never mind that the Brits, lords and commoners, had gotten wind of his lurid past. He's like a superhero but with everyone knowing his secret identity. Except he's given up that part of his life. Not even King Leopold's invitation to visit the Belgian Congo can make him uproot himself.

But Leopold isn't as convincing as the chatty George Washington Williams (Samuel Jackson) who airs his suspicions of grave injustice being perpetrated in the Belgian Congo at Leopold's behest, and so spurs Lord Greystoke into sudden activity. And it doesn't take long to detect Lady Greystoke's modern bend. Jane Clayton, she promptly talks herself into coming along, despite her husband's protestations that it's too perilous. Turns out, he wasn't wrong.

What this is, is a glorified B-movie, really. Never mind that a prestige Brit director like David Yates is at the helm. It's an old-fashioned pulp adventure what's gratifyingly absent of too much bloat. There's some stuff here that may trigger those readers who hang their hat on ERB's books. For instance, those flashback scenes that reveal that Jane Porter grew up in Africa instead of in America. There is also the matter of the Lost City of Opar, but, here, diminished of its romantic air for the absence of its beauteous queen, La.

The plot blends in improbable high adventure with a smattering of authentic historical figures of the late 1800s, although I imagine some license was taken in their portrayal. Leopold II, bankrupt monarch, was a real person, as was the despicable envoy Lon Rom. Unbelievably, Samuel Jackson's character was also a real person, except I doubt George Washington Williams, advocate of the natives' rights in the Congo, spoke in such contemporary fashion. My problem is that Samuel Jackson has become such a larger-than-life actor that I don't any more buy whatever role he plays. All I see is Samuel Jackson playing himself. In this movie, the moment he opens his yap, he's instantly this anachronistic presence. His character even references the infamous ""Me Tarzan, you Jane"" quote, which was undoubtedly intended as a wink to the audience but served to take me out of the story. It also beggars belief that G.W. Williams, who is not a young pup, was able to keep up with the hardy warrior natives on the move, let alone the indefatigable ape-man.

For what it is, I enjoyed it. It's not meant to be highbrow stuff. It's popcorn viewing graced with a classic literary action hero and by an assortment of top-shelf actors. Christoph Waltz is equal parts suave and creepy as the big bad. Margot Robbie makes for a feisty Jane, defiant captive who is bedrock certain a rescue's coming but who, nonetheless, tries her durndest to get the job done herself. Alexander Skarsgrd reportedly put on over twenty pounds of muscle for the part, and, oboy, he sure exhibits a ridiculously sculpted physique. Just as important as his incredible frame is that Skarsgrd moves with nimbleness and a sleek animalistic grace. He's convincing. True to the books, his Tarzan remains a man of few words. But when he speaks, it's in complete sentences. Skarsgrd also uses his eyes to project depth and soulfulness and things going on beneath the surface. Skarsgrd is a very good actor.

The f/x work for me. The movie sinks me enough into its narrative that I can forgive the occasionally shady CG, as well as the occasional bouts of melodrama. The action sequences are boss. Tarzan in savage action is a sight to behold. Still, I appreciate that his extended combat with the huge ape went down the way it did, with Tarzan mostly the recipient of a brutal ass-whuppin'. But this is Tarzan in his element, patina of civilization sloughed off of him. He is more man than you, the jungle terror whispered about as ""an evil spirit,"" as ""the ghost in the trees."" See him take on murderous apes and slavers and a devious envoy and a mercenary army numbering twenty-thousand. Let's see you do that, Johnny Weissmuller.",1503273600,,5903,4.860834990059642

Johnny made 15 movies of Tarzan, followed by Lex Barker, Denny Miller, Gordon Scott, Jock Mahoney, Mike Henry, Ron Ely, Wolf Larson and Alexander Skarsgard.  Since 1931 there have been wonderful movies and there have been real duds.  But through it all, the majority of the films have been excellent.  This movie brings together all of the better Tarzan movies.  It is a literate script.  Tarzan starts out as Lord Graystoke.  He is allowed to speak full sentences.  He is athletic and he is romantic and he is perfect for the role.  He is not too muscle bound. He portrays Tarzan as the HERO brought up by apes.  This movie can stand alone.

7776846,1,B01H4FJR5W,"Not Tarzan. Not Jane.

The movie was a complete corruption of the book.

The script was weak and unfaithful.

Everyone was miscast.

Morgot Robbie is too vulgar in speech and manner to be Jane. Her speech and attitude in the film was of a woman of today and not of a woman of the that period. There's not an elegant bone in Robbie's body.

Since when does the hero get his lunch handed to him? Only in today's retarded Hollywood. In the book Tarzan defeats the apes and not the other way around.

This movie was not so much about Tarzan than it was about slavery  and how bad America was concerning the Indians. That's the way the world was and still is. People need to stop focusing and living in the past. There's no future there. I'm surprised they didn't slip abortion into the movie.

I wanted to watch a movie focused on Tarzan and not slavery. If I wanted to watch a film focused on slavery I could have watched ""The Ten Commandments"" or ""Roots"" or Ben Hur or a Roman Epic.

And what the heck is Jackson doing in the movie? There was never any such character.

Anyone who gave this movie more than one star has never read the novels. How Tarzan and Jane met is a thousand times better in the book than how it was so poorly depicted in this laughable film.

The special effects could not save this movie.",1500422400,2,1310,4.284552845528455

7776852,4,B01H4FJR5W,"David Yates's take on the famous Edgar Rice Burroughs' character may not have won many favours with critics or theatre-going audiences, but it may well find its second wind on DVD. Though it's hardly a classic, it's fun and entertaining, with plenty of thrilling stunts, likeable characters, and exciting African set pieces.

The plot foregoes the usual origin story (relegating important details to a few flashbacks) and instead starts with Tarzan (Alexander Skarsgrd) in London, having reclaimed his title as Lord John Greystoke III and enjoying a domestic life with his wife Jane (Margot Robbie). But though he seems content with his new surroundings, Jane longs to return to the African jungles.

Unbeknownst to him, an envoy of King Leopold of Belgium has struck a deal with African Chief Mbonga (Djimon Hounsou), who promises diamonds in exchange for Tarzan's life. Why he has such a vendetta is kept a under wraps at first, though Captain Leon Rom (Christoph Waltz) doesn't care anyway  all he has to do is deliver Tarzan into Mbonga's hands, and the exploitation of the Congo can continue.

Having been talked into returning to Africa by George Washington Williams (a real-life figure played by Samuel L. Jackson) to investigate rumours of the slave trade, John and Jane start reconnecting with their African roots  only for Captain Rom to strike and John forced to team up with George, reclaim his identity as Tarzan, and rescue his wife and fellow tribesmen.

It's a fairly straightforward plot, but epic in scope when it comes to the journey Tarzan takes across the course of the film: one which includes trains, boats,  hostile tribes, wild animals, stampedes, monsoons, and of course  plenty of swinging from vines. Alexander Skarsgrd captures Tarzan's physique and gentleness, while Margot Robbie rises above her damsel in distress role to deliver the most spirited Jane we've yet seen. Christoph Waltz is at his usual smarmy best as the villain, while Samuel L. Jackson manages to provide both gravitas AND comic relief as George, a man with a dark past, personal convictions, and a growing trust in Tarzan's abilities.

But the real fun lies in the adventure. Who wasn't enraptured by the idea of a wild man raised by apes when they were a kid? Someone who could swing from vines and communicate with the beasts as though he was born to it? Yates taps into that imaginative joy as John gradually morphs back into Tarzan, shedding his inhibitions (along with most of his clothing) on the way. Watching him move like a gorilla, swim like a fish, run like an antelope  it's the stuff of daydreams, and the reason why Edgar Rice Burroughs's novel was so popular in the first place.

So ""The Legend of Tarzan"" isn't exactly a Hollywood milestone: but it's fun and exciting and feels like a nice throwback to the pulpy adventure stories of the past. That's enough for me!",1500076800,,2881,4.907407407407407

It's fantasy and like Kong Skull Island, has an old timey feel to it. It's a true popcorn flick that entertains and satisfies. Not Oscar material, but it's a great love story and the animals and the oppressed triumph in the end.

If you've never read the books, you might like it more.  The first book dates from 1912.  Movie writers, producers, and directors should have more respect for a classic like this.  The story of Tarzan is still popular more than 100 years later for a reason, so why so they think they know better than Burroughs?",1497916800,2,466,4.5
7776885,5,B01H4FJR5W,"Who knew anyone could make a movie about Tarzan that doesn't make you roll your eyes to heaven?  David Yates and company have done that and more with The Legend of Tarzan.  We find Tarzan already civilized and in charge of Greystoke Castle.  We are left to overlook how a man raised by gorillas managed to become such a polished English gentleman with a perfect upper crust accent- but who cares?  He looks good enough to eat!  He has been invited by the King Leopold II of Belgium to go to the Congo Basin to review the 'progress' of his nation there.  He reluctantly agrees only because an American envoy named George Washington Williams (humorously played by Samuel L. Jackson) secretly tells him of his suspicion that Leopold is enslaving the entire continent.  The rest of the story is full of action and romance because, of course, you know that Jane is put into dire straits and must be rescued from someone very evil.  I loved the professional look and tone of the entire film.  There was nothing 'Disney' or nonsensical about the movie.  It was sincere and believable.  The CGI was subtle and very realistic.  The characters were relatable and touching.  I especially loved the scene between John Clayton (Tarzan) and the Congo Chief toward the end of the movie.  What a beautiful exchange..

I really enjoyed the actors in this rendition and they did do a really good job with what they were given but I felt the script was lacking and why even have Skarsgard attempt an English accent? It came across as unnatural for his character and came out of him unnaturally as well. Yes, Tarzan was an English aristocrat but he wouldn't have had an English accent....he wasn't raised in England and he wasn't raised by his parents, they died when he was a baby....so why even go there?

Christoph Walz, as always, plays a wonderful villain...and Margot Kidder was perfect as Jane in my opinion. I even loved Samuel L. Jackson in his supporting role which is unusual for me...I just found the story to be lacking.",1496102400,2,848,4.401273885350318

The protagonist has supernatural abilities to communicate with animals as well as moving through the treetops better than most monkeys so you need to go into this expecting the unreal.

I don't watch vampire shows, so I wasn't familiar with Alexander Skarsgard, but I know his dad from Deep Blue Sea. He was a hard character to forgot considering he had such a dramatic death scene (his dad in Deep Blue Sea). I was really impressed with Alex as Tarzan. I grew up watching a lot of Tarzan movies and his role was much different from any I have seen. He made me believe he was really Tarzan. After watching a few interviews on Youtube I learned to like him even more. He seemed genuine, not egotistical or full of himself. Great sense of humor. Margot did well faking an American accent as Jane. She made me believe her character was in love with Tarzan, considering that foxy husband she has in real life was probably on the set watching them both ;)  I love Sam. He is more of the comedy relief, but kind of dated. His character was more 20th century with some of the lines he delivered, but I still enjoyed it. I wouldn't have watched it without Samuel L. It's a story about a white man in an African jungle, during a long period of colonialism and I didn't know how we (people of color) would be represented. Considering the setting was the 19th-century I think it was done really well. I enjoyed it and am kinda sad there won't be a sequel.",1493510400,,1385,4.326923076923077

Literally every spear carrying African man in this film is just delighted to see Charlize Theron as if they grew up as brother and sister (yeah, right).

Only one particular item that I did not agree with: the disrespectful and dismal portrayal of the Catholic rosary as a murder weapon.

I watched it twice (one after the other) because I was afraid I had missed some parts. It was so intense and yet so romantic and beautiful. Alexander Skarsgard was marvelous in his portrayal of Tarzan. It was great that he was played as articulate and sensitive as opposed to the mute but very pretty Tarzan in the Bo Derek film.

The acting/casting was spot on, and I am a longtime fan of E.R. Burroughs.  There is rarely anything more satisfying than seeing a hunk swinging on vines through the jungle and racing through terrain with herds of wild animals to reunite with his brave heroine, while she bravely defies and thwarts the evil-doers at every turn.

Beyond that, this is just another example of soulless CGI masquerading as a movie.  It's boring and rarely emotionally engaging.  Also, Christoph Waltz is wasted as a one-dimensional baddie.

7777020,5,B01H4FJR5W,"Frankly, I'd had my fill of Tarzan movies beginning with Johnny Weissmuller but was more than pleasantly surprised by this modern day re-boot that far surpasses previous Tarzan films. Personally found the movie very enjoyable, well choreographed action and beautiful to watch. Outstanding cinematography and musical score. A very well written, touching story with substance,a human element not yet depicted with bits of humor added. None of those old ""Me Tarzan,you Jane"" scenes likely considered hokey by today's standards.

Legend of Tarzan begins eight years after Tarzan (Alexander Skarsgard) and Jane (Margot Robbie) have left Africa to undertake a gentrified life in London, where Tarzan claimed his birthright of John Clayton III, Lord Greystoke. Samuel Jackson as real-life historical figure, Dr George Washington Williams draws them back to Africa on a quest to save the Congo by exposing the crimes of King Leopold II of Belgium. Christoph Waltz as Leon Rom the bad guy. Fine acting by all characters. An adventure that Tarzan author, Edgar Rice Burroughs, would most likely be proud of.",1491004800,,1097,5.341040462427745

7777041,5,B01H4FJR5W,"Now, this version of the Tarzan story is the bomb!  (This means it was awesome.)  Instead of telling a story of some white guy lording it over black savages of the jungle, this was done eloquently.  The story is about an orphaned white male infant left alone in the jungle, not to be killed, but to be loved and cared for by a female ape.  This John/Tarzan (as he was called) does come to realize his inheritance back in civilization, but his heart remained with the wonderful people and animals of the jungle.  Not to leave out his wonder wife, Jane, whom he also met in the jungle.  John/Tarzan begins his fight against slave traders in the Congo, but he doesn't do it alone.  He wages war against the slave traders with the help of ALL his friends, human and animal alike, because he knew he couldn't possibly have accomplished this feat alone.  In sum, it's a beautiful story about his love and loyalty to his family and the people (and animals) with whom he grew up.  This movie is really heart-warming.  However, it's hard to believe that none of it was filmed in Africa.",1490400000,7,1077,4.476923076923077

Couldn't really keep me hooked on it though, where was the plot? Was there even one? I get that there was a BASIC one, but I didn't really get the feeling of an amazing climax or anything, it was just OK.
Zero rewatch value in my honest opinion.

She's never the same in any two movies. I did find some of the vine swinging scene absurd and ridiculous but hey, it's a Tarzan movie. No more ridiculous than the unbelievable crap Spider-Man does in terms of physics. Over all I loved this movie and hope it gets a sequel. Just good fun.",1488931200,2,617,4.669724770642202

Found that I want to read the original books after watching this movie. Grew up watching Tarzan on tv and this movie is done so well in exceeding those childhood memories. I like how Tarzan is seen as a moral intelligent man with his fellow Africans. They are also portrayed as a loving moral people, a plus for this movie. The main theme deals with the rights of the native inhabitants and their treatment when another nation wants to procure wealth from natural resources. It is never ending. Done well, Mr. Skarsgard. Thanks.

7777205,4,B01H4FJR5W,"I think of all the adaptations of Tarzan I have ever seen, this has definitely many, many things in its favor. The story line is well played out, the acting very good. The visuals - both CGI and natural - border on stunning. Alexander Skarsgrd, to me best known for his portrayal of Sgt. Brad 'Iceman' Colbert in Generation Kill, is awarded the role of John Clayton III, Lord Greystoke.

Going back to Africa with wife Jane (Margot Robbie) and American George Washington Williams (Samuel L. Jackson), Clayton, along with members of a native tribe, take on the Belgium Congolese government to stop slavery. This is a great introduction movie to almost anyone who has never seen a Tarzan episode or movie. Additionally, for those of us who grew up on Johnny Weissmuller, this offers a new spin on an old favorite.",1487980800,,811,4.711267605633803

The film is nothing like the original Tarzan story as this is about Tarzans return to Africa.  The storyline was OK. I rated the film at 4 stars as I thought there were to many flashbacks and it made the storyline choppy at times.",1487980800,,439,4.152941176470589

7777226,5,B01H4FJR5W,"This movie is excellent in so many ways.  Alexander Skarsgard is amazing to behold in a character he was born for. His acting is wonderfully understated and elegant and his magnificent physical presence makes him all the more believable in this role.  He delivers subtle touches throughout the movie, for example his annoyed ape ""chuff"" sound in the stagecoach after the distasteful meeting with the British PM.  The chemistry with Margot Robbie as Jane is perfect.  She is luminously beautiful and you will love how they are with each other.  She stands up in the Jane role like no other Jane you have ever seen.  The African villagers are portrayed with beautiful dignity and their history and interactions with Tarzan and Jane provide a heartwarming ""local"" complement to the global colonial exploitation theme.

I'm not a fan of Samuel Jackson and he is his loud, annoying self, reprising the same role and speeches he does in every movie. There's too much of him in the movie, which is my only complaint.  Djimon Hounsou is magnificent as Chief Mbonga, who pays the Belgian King's representative, Leon Rom, in diamonds to capture and deliver Tarzan to him so that he can have his revenge for the death of his only son many years ago.  The visible pain he bears from his son's death will bring you to tears.

Christoph Waltz as Leon Rom was incredibly interesting, owning every scene he is in.  He projects a subtle malice that is bone chilling at times.

The movie's music is enchanting, and it enhances the overall romantic feeling.  I'm not an expert to analyze the CGI wildlife and other special effects, but it made for fun and awesome viewing for me.

Disregard the stupid media reviews and other negative nit-picking. This movie is incredible!",1487808000,,1754,4.822742474916388

7777333,1,B01H4FJR5W,Very poor picture quality. I paid for HD and got less resolution than standard.. streaming was terrible kept stopping to load. Thought it might be my router and internet but Netflix worked perfectly.,1486598400,,199,5.0606060606060606
7777334,4,B01H4FJR5W,This movie was interesting because SPOILER its about what happens to tarzan after he gets found and goes back to civilization. it is not bad at all and i would recommend it even at bluray,1486598400,,187,4.371428571428571
7777345,4,B01H4FJR5W,I really enjoyed this movie. I think the critics did a terrible dis-service when they gave such awful reviews. I would recommend it as an enjoyable movie.,1486598400,,154,4.7407407407407405
7777346,5,B01H4FJR5W,"I don't know what it is about this film.  The incredible visuals, the emotional and gritty and primal feel to it.  It is just a beautiful film.  It is definitely not a perfect film, but it feels gloriously perfect to me in all its imperfection.  The soundtrack is pure epicness (uplifting to the max).  The story is really terrific.  I really feel people should give this one a chance.  The acting is excellent (in fact maybe the weakest point in film is Skaarsgard, and he isn't too bad at all).  I am a sucker for uplifting epic soaring films, and this one fits the bill for me in every way.  Very well done.  No need to go over the plot as that has been covered by many of the great reviews on here.  Please give this one a shot.  One of my faves of 2016.  Thanks for reading.",1486598400,,779,4.1824324324324325

Once the storyline was developed right at the beginning of the movie, we were glued to our seats the rest of the time. Great action, awesome scenery, captivating animals, and exciting and unique characters kept us enthralled with the story. Alexander Skarsgrd as the Lord of the Jungle and the lovely Margot Robbie as his mate Jane were excellent in their roles, and Samuel Jackson is always exceptional.

7777591,5,B01H4FJR5W,"Great movie! Saw twice in theaters and my roommate wanted to see it here at the house. Paid about $1 on an online movie sale to watch at home and was worth every cent! The quality was good (via Amazon on the Roku 3) and no issues with the speed nor quality! This movie gives a slightly different take on the same story but is very engulfing and you get sucked into the storyline! I was expecting this movie to be more along the whole ""George of the Jungle"" type theme but they made it a little different! My roommate also commented that she liked that Jane wasn't portrayed to be just another ""damsel in distress"" but that she held her own in the movie. Would watch again and we'll probably be purchasing this movie on dvd soon! Check it out if you haven't already!",1485648000,2,765,4.2827586206896555

7777614,3,B01H4FJR5W,"I watched it mainly to ogle Skarsgard, but also for Christoph Waltz and because I enjoy the Tarzan story. It was fine, nothing special. Alexander Skarsgard is a feast for the eyes, and Waltz was his typical villainous character. It's one of only three Tarzan movies I've seen, and it ranks #3 behind Greystoke and the Disney cartoon.

Not a bad movie, and no regrets spending the $ to rent it on Prime, but nothing all that extraordinary to see here.",1485648000,,450,4.555555555555555

7777618,1,B01H4FJR5W,"I find it amusing that this whole movie is about slavery and yet seems to miss the point all together. We all know that the idea behind anti slavery films is that all people are equal no matter your skin color, yet the opening scene focuses on, of course, the evil villian and his rosary used for killing. I wonder when we will learn the lesson that all people are equal, which applies not only to skin color but also to respecting differing beliefs. It is so offensive when the media uses what is sacred to someone's beliefs and is completely disrespectful. Sadly, I would have really enjoyed this movie had that aspect not been included. Come on Hollywood! Have some respect and creativity next time!",1485561600,,702,4.579365079365079

7777620,4,B01H4FJR5W,"It's not as slow as some of the reviewers seem to believe. This isn't suppose to be a non-stop action movie but it is a good Tarzan movie and good ""sequel"" so to speak to the idea of Tarzan. Plus it doesn't hurt that Alexander Skarsgard is in it for us ladies.",1485561600,,260,4.019230769230769
7777621,5,B01H4FJR5W,"As a lifelong fan of the Tarzan books and movies, I was fully prepared to hate this new iteration, as the last several films were so ridiculous.  I was shocked to find that I loved it!  Skarsgaard perfectly captures the spirit of Tarzan, especially the way I imagined he moved - or didn't move.  If you notice, he is frequently very still, taking in the moment around him, even if others are agitated. He doesn't chatter, but utters every word with thought and purpose.  If you've read the books, (which more people should,) you'll understand what I mean.  A real tribute to the Tarzan legacy!",1485561600,,593,4.609523809523809

7777645,4,B01H4FJR5W,"I waited to see this movie until it got to Amazon. So many of these remakes are certainly not worth the price of admission to see. Then, the critics trashed it, but sometimes they are wrong. This time, in my opinion, they were wrong. From a villain you just prayed would really get it in the end, to the action once Tarzen arrives back in Africa, it was well worth buying. Even the character played by Samuel L. Jackson seem to blend in after their initial introduction. It's worth seeing.",1485561600,,489,4.444444444444445

Never really like the Ron Ely series, and the other actors that played Tarzan back in the day didn't cut it for me. I did enjoy Chris Lambert's Greystoke, though. And this.

This movie was almost too noble to sit by the side of that swoon-worthy source material, but Alexander Skarsgard's abs, y'all. No! Seriously, He's got such a long torso it was almost weird at times. Like half the CGI was making sure he fit in the frame?!

7777872,5,B01H4FJR5W,"I didn't think the movie will be good, because you know as most of the disney remake movie are quiet garbage like the cinderella, big yawn. But this movie is surprisingly engaging and not boring at all. The animation of the animals are surreal and really cool. I think they portrayed the animal much better in the movie than the Jungle book which i think is targeting much younger audience.

The story line is little cliche but still engaging. (not nearly as cliche as the other disney princess movie). I love the performance by all the actors and actress, its not overly done. there are plenty action scenes in the movie which is rare for an disney princess movie but it is what made the movie more exciting and fun to watch. The landscape of the jungle is breathtaking.

Overall a very surprising and entertaining movie i believe for the whole family.",1484352000,,853,4.605263157894737

Alexander Skarsgrd, the apes, the animals had the potential to create my favorite Tarzan film. And then there was the script. Why anyone would draw the monstrous King Leopold II in a Tarzan fantasy is beyond me.

I have read speculation about who the next Tarzan might be. I'd suggest they keep Skarsgrd and replace the screenwriters and director.",1484352000,,477,4.746987951807229

7777927,4,B01H4FJR5W,I am a big fan of Tarzan who has read most of the original books.  I have seen every Tarzan movie and most of the TV series. My feeling is that this incarnation of Tarzan more fully embodies the Tarzan that Edgar Rice Burroughs envisioned.,1484092800,,239,4.311111111111111

7777932,5,B01H4FJR5W,"Alexander Skarsgard stars as the latest incarnation of Tarzan, now John Clayton III who is domesticated and living with Jane, played by Margot Robbie, in England, when he is summoned by councilmen to team up with Dr. George Washington Williams, played by Samuel L. Jackson, to stop the trafficking of blacks from the Congo by Leon Rom.  Now, John must go back to the jungle to re-associate himself with the animals, starting with the gorillas, that he abandoned to live among people. In the beginning, it was slow, but it had to be that way to build up to why Tarzan and Jane belong together and to what lengths he would go to protect her.  This version of Jane is no punk and can dish it just as she can take it.  Visually stunning in special effects, it had that flavor that made it believable. This was a flick that was not only worth watching, but lived up to the creation that Edgar Rice Burroughs made.",1484006400,,908,4.457831325301205

7777949,5,B01H4FJR5W,This is the best Tarzan movie I have ever seen.  It tells the story of the adult Tarzan back home in England and then looks back on how he became Tarzan in short clips.  I have watched it several times.  I have grown up on the Legend of Tarzan and Johnny Weissmuller was the first Tarzan I remember and then Buster Crabbe and Gordon Scott.  They were good as Tarzan and for their time.  But this was the very best for me anyway the best movie to tell the story of Tarzan.  Well done.,1483920000,,483,4.085106382978723

7777989,5,B01H4FJR5W,"I was absolutely blown away with this movie. The portrayal of Tarzan's incredible physical strength, his strength of character, his unyielding and fierce courage in facing down anything or anyone who even thought of harming the jungle, his animal family, his native friends and family.
His total lack of fear and his complete acceptance of the way things had to be done in order for him to become one with an incredibly dangerous and harsh environment that was his home.
The respectful, loving, and courageous bond forged with the fiercest, most deadly and most awesome creatures in the wilds of the Congo. The complete acceptance and respect between Tarzan, Jane and all of the tribal members was awesome.
The intense freedom I felt watching Tarzan with the gorillas and native sons flying through the jungle was almost overwhelming.
I know some will read this and think, good Lord lady, it's just a movie, but this is one incredible movie.
I've watched it 3 times in 2 days and am still in awe. Tonight I bought it, and I very rarely buy movies unless I love them so much, I know I will watch them again and again. This is one. Oh, and it should also be on the list of the most deeply moving love stories of all time.
Alexander Skarsgrd was extremely hot in True Blood, but as Tarzan he is on fire!
As another person mentioned, this is about one incredible man who took on the world and saved his home. He played an incredibly brave, insightful, hero and we DO need more heroes like Tarzan.",1483833600,,1492,4.57089552238806

7777991,2,B01H4FJR5W,"Tarzan has been done so many times, that it's refreshing to see his origin dispensed with all together ( except in flashback bits and pieces).  As I'm watching this, I'm picturing all the actors involved doing just about everything in front of green screens. The look of the jungle and just about every set piece looks like the  bulk of this movie budget was spent on CGI. Almost all the outdoor scenes look dark, in that special greenish/grayish overtone so prevalent in CGI. So much for the look of the film. As for the content, it's standard contemporary Tarzan material , with some prostalytizing about the mistreatment of American Indians, of all things, by costar Samuel L Jackson ( who seems to be in every other movie turned out of Hollywood these days).  So, the Evil White Men are at it again - slaughtering the animals, killing the natives and stripping the country bare of it's diamonds.  If you're a bleeding heart liberal, you're gonna love this movie and squeal with delight at all the  politically correct sentiments that infuse the script of this film. If you want an exciting Tarzan movie, the action in the film is of the usual overblown, made-for- 3-D CGI variety. Ho-hum. Ho-hum.",1483747200,3,1200,4.75

I saw this movie at a theatre and like it enough to rent it through Amazon Prime...and enjoyed it as much as I did the first time.  Anymore...I don't pay attention to the critic's reviews.

Tarzan is portrayed as the expected lord of the jungle and he is no one to mess with, so in that sense, it is as expected.  I have watched it twice now and will definitely watch it again.  The acting is well done and the characters are believable.  What I did not appreciate was the extreme brutality of the lead antagonist.

7778145,5,B01H4FJR5W,"I was worried at first when some of the reviews weren't so great. Lately it seems like movies have been kind of a let down after all of the hype. This one however was certainly not a let down! I really enjoyed it. Alexander did an awesome job as Tarzan, honestly I love the man but I couldn't quite picture him in this role after True Blood. Now, I can't think of a better man to have played him! (It doesn't hurt that the man is drop dead gorgeous but now he's a sensitive animal lover too? OMG.) Plus, this is only the 2nd movie I've seen Margot Robbie in (Suicide Squad being the first) and I have to say I'm totally jealous but she's perfect for the role of Jane. I loved her! Samuel did a great job too. I haven't read the book, so I don't how closely it follows but I was very happy with the outcome: the story was great, the chemistry between those two was palpable, the music was good and the filmography was outstanding. This will be one for my collection!",1483142400,,965,4.165775401069519

7778148,5,B01H4FJR5W,"I really love this continuation from the last Disney movie. Tarzan (Skarsgard) and Jane's (Robbie) relationship was touching, and endearing. The storyline was all Hollywood of course, a touch of fantasy, fairytale and make-believe...but oh they do it so well. My favorite moments included the scenes with the Mangani, Tarzan adopted family. Beginning with young Tarzan and his Ape Mother Kala - how she cared for him as he grew up, protecting him from Kerchak and teaching him how to survive.  Also the segments with Akut, his adopted brother who loved him enough not to kill and stood by him against Chief Mbonga and the Leopard Men of Opar.  The cast of characters brought to life Cozad's and Brewer's rendition; keeping with the old Tarzan movies we knew (greed, sacrifice, slavery,  indescribable panoramic views,  swinging from vines and yes..the iconic call Aah-eeh-ah-eeh-aaaaaah-eeh-ah-eeh-aaaaah"") and giving us a glimpse into how Tarzan successfully adapted to his life after returning to England as John Clayton III, Lord of Greystoke.

This was a good interpretation, however my favorite will always be the one closest to Burrough's writing, which was Greystoke, the Legend of Tarzan with Christopher Lambert.

It should also be noted that this movie takes place after Tarzan is 'rescued' and only has flashbacks to his time from the original story we all know. This was actually a refreshing viewpoint for a tired story, which I appreciated. The special effects were decent enough (nothing glaringly terrible) but there are plenty of eye-rolling moments. Would I purchase this if I had seen it before? No. Will I watch it again? No. Do I completely regret watching it? No. Would my mom love it? Yes.",1482883200,,601,4.616822429906542

This movie took itself way too seriously but seemed to me to be a poor George of the Jungle ripoff. I can't recommend this movie whatsoever. They should have just done another George of the Jungle.

The movie was well done, believable and stayed pretty close to the facts from Burroughs first ""Tarzan of the Apes"" came out.  The love scenes were on the steamy side, yet acceptable for even young children. It was all in the feelings portrayed.

Kidding aside, he's very good at being Tarzan and i love the realistic sensitive beginning of his being saved by a mother ape who raises and includes him with her brood.  The nature scenes and swinging in the trees...something out of Avatar paradise...its bonding and moving and its rare today to get good storyline content.  Theres really alot of poorly written junk flung up quickly on the screens today and lots of outsourced computer graphics to make it real and loud!  Most of the time i long for movies with lots of story line, good writing and directing and little graphics but today..that's what sells to the younger crowd.

7778328,2,B01H4FJR5W,"I am somebody who literally never complains about effects being bad in films. Never. And yet I feel compelled to critique the bizarre vine-swinging in this film. The animal and landscape effects are fine enough, and some of the scampering through the branches or miscellaneous action FX are okay. But the stuff on the vines - which doesnt appear with nearly enough regularity so are maybe disproportionately disappointing once those big moments finally occur  it looks extremely shoddy. Example: Tarzans swinging onto a speeding train, so hes uses a single vine that travels hundreds of feet at an insane speed from some imaginary tree thousands of feet tall. Even to a child this would look maddeningly preposterous. Beyond the absurd physics of the shot is the lackluster quality of the compositing and matte work too.

So the strangely inept effects work speaks to the overall quality of this subpar film. Despite the big budget and some decent stars, there is nothing so special about this plodding and dull film. Besides off logic, murky motives, and flat characters, the films draw of action is often shot and edited in a confounding way. Within a fistfight, the picture will cut mid-strike and/or make awkward zooms too, as if the director were trying to obscure the blows.

The films ultimate failing lies in its misguided plot. Instead of a story about a wild warrior in the jungle, the film beings with a tamed Tarzan in civilization, and has recruited a wide-cast of supporting players which nobody ever asked for as he intermittently returns to his natural roots. A simplified version with a man wrestling lions and jumping off waterfalls wouldve been far more glorious than this killjoy films repeated scenes of side characters rousing speeches on liberty or bureaucrats debating commercial trade.",1482192000,,1810,5.046822742474917

What that lacked in CGI, it made up with character portrayal by Christopher Lambert.  This movie opens with Tarzan already back in England, married to Jane, and distancing himself from Tarzan as he tries go fit into his role as an English Lord.  This would have been much better for me if they showed more than a couple of flashbacks that only allude to his beginnings for anyone not familiar with how a white man ended up in Africa raised  by apes.  I would have appreciated more of his conversion in flashbacks go add depth and heart to his character. A bit more on the backstory with Jane would have added to their relationship as husband and wife.",1482019200,,774,4.422535211267606

It had been awhile since I'd seen the Disney animated feature. There were so many aspects of this version that reminded me of it though. Don't get me wrong, this is not a children's movie. Tarzans love for Jane is very ""Grown Up"". Not to say that it is gratuitous in any way. The special effects are stunning leaving you breathless as he glides through the trees, rescuing his love and cutting a swath through anyone who stands in his way.",1482019200,,587,4.4953271028037385

7778399,4,B01H4FJR5W,"I've seen most of the Tarzans through the years and read the books as well.  So many storylines copy each other; this is no exception.  But the acting was surprisingly good and the writing as well - I was aware on several occasions during the movie that I was engrossed and enjoying the movie.  The ending was weak - somehow it was anti-climatic.  Bad guys were done in too easily or something.  Jane was over-the-top athletic - hugely unbelievable especially for a LADY of her era UNLESS history is provided explaining her capabilities.  Five minutes of exposition explaining how she is atypically tough would have been useful.  Being accustomed to jungle hardships is not the same thing at all as fighting, shooting and running around as she did.  Still, very entertaining.  Oh - Sam Jackson's ability to keep up in any way was pure bull.  Repeatedly he ""just made it"" but it was always unbelievable.",1481932800,,902,4.7612903225806456

7778403,1,B01H4FJR5W,The trailer shows no hint of what this movie was really about. Super unrealistic bad acting and the only thing that relates to Tarzan is swinging on vines and the flashbacks. I was expecting a movie about Tarzan but this movie is so far from that. Even the gorillas reject Tarzan. I was team gorilla. plus it seems like everyone read all about Tarzan in the movie..If you want to see a movie about Tarzan and that story skip this but if you want to see a movie that seems to just drag Tarzan into it as it gathers a very predictable plotline and some actors doing poorly then you may enjoy this. Tarzan was basically traded for diamonds to make the guys king rich and to build an army also a lot of slavery added into it which at the time the movie but movie was set in time zone after the civil war. and also is used to get Tarzan angry and motivated to do something after being away from the jungle a long time and it pissed him off more than Jane getting captured. I was disappointed and hopefully someone else doesn't make the mistake of thinking it'd be a movie about the real Tarzan and that story.,1481932800,,1104,4.23696682464455
7778404,4,B01H4FJR5W,"Good movie...However, I felt like all the trailers for Tarzan, gave away most of the good parts.  I would watch this movie on repeat if I could because it corresponds slightly with Disney's Tarzan, yet has it's own unique and enjoyable themes and plots.",1481846400,,253,4.75

Okay, it's a little slow to get started after the initial action, but it builds wonderfully from there.  I was not disappointed and wish now that I had seen the movie on the big screen because of the visually stunning scenes.

To believe that not a bit of this movie was filmed in the Congo is an incredible expectation... but, indeed, it was all special effects. Margot Robbie plays a not so plain Jane. Tarzen, played by Alexander Skarsgard; his story is unique, is utterly superb! Robbie's performance, along with all actors in the film, was stellar! Emotional impact throughout is high. The romance in this film; the love romance between Tarzan and Jane, sizzles. The romance found in the beauty and grandeur of African savannas and forests of the Congo (despite being completely fabricated in the special effects room) is breath-taking and epic. I have watched this film countless times already and keep it in the forefront of my DVD collection. Not just a love story, but appeals to all genders, all ages. Samuel L. Jackson plays a good guy too, with an awesome performance! The soundtrack is just as beautiful as the movie, as well!

7778523,5,B01H4FJR5W,"The trailer for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Legend-of-Tarzan-Special-Edition/dp/B01H4FJQO4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Legend of Tarzan (Special Edition)</a>&nbsp;definitely caught my attention, but after reading a number of reviews, I have to admit I was hesitant. Claims of a poorly scripted movie with bad acting almost scared me away from watching an exceptional movie.

Overall, the premise is different because it is almost a part II. This is the story of what happens when Tarzan and Jane have returned to what would be considered the civilized world. If that was all that there was to this story, the movie would be fairly bland. The story line, in my opinion, is phenomenal. It  grabbed my attention from the first scene.

I knew I was hooked.

The acting was so good I didn't think about the quality of the acting while watching. Not sure if that makes sense. Jane is the strong, yet feminine, main character. Her elegance is evident in her talk and her stance, and she is Tarzan's equal in attitude and personality. I really liked seeing Jane is a strong woman not a ""damsel in distress"".

Tarzan was amazing and everything I thought he would be... but more. He is the half-man, half-beast I expected from books.

Now, I want to say the CGI was amazing! Seriously, I couldn't tell the difference between the animals and the humans.

There are many strong action scenes that left me on the end of my seat. Other scenes left me awed and inspired. I really want to swing through the trees!",1481414400,2,1551,5.155378486055777

Barely past the colonial slave era and he is an international ambassador for the united States? I doubt it. Black people couldn't even vote in that time period.  They just really wanted him in the movie. Plot holes all over the movie. Great actors but a terrible script to work with and CGI that's nearly as bad. Don't hit that purchase button.

7778588,5,B01H4FJR5W,"Tarzan and Jane, a love story. And that is what this is. It is a great adventure after Tarzan, Lord Greystoke, is asked to return to Africa to document the possiblity of a dictator attempting to complete a railway line at the expense of the people by enslaving them. Of course he is reluctand at first but then agrees. Jane of course will not be left behind and convinces Tarzan to take her with him. Of course there is also a sub plot going on that connect to the slavery issue but is also about revenge against Tarzan. Jane is kidnapped but because she is Jane, the wife of Lord John Greystoke and more importantly, Tarzan's mate, she is not the snivling, crying waiting to be rescued damsel in distress; she fights back whenever possible and she will not aqueous to her captors. And I was please to hear in the script the difference between the the Gorilla and the Mangani(I believe it was Edgar Rice Boroughs who created the Mangani as as separate species of ape, which were far more intelligent, stronger and fiercer than the gorilla we are acquainted with for the purpose of Tarzan's story and adventures). Alexander Skarsgard is perfect in this role as Tarzan and Samuel Jackson perfect in his role as forced sidekick/comedy relief. And you will love Margot Robie as Jane. But please remember, Tarzan and Jane have always been about their unending love for each other, the adventure is secondary as Edgar Rice Boroughs always intended it to be. If you like the adventure/fantasy type movies you will like this one. If you are a fan of Tarzan I don't think you will be disappointed either. The cast all fall into their roles with ease and do a great job.",1481241600,,1660,4.573825503355705

The movie starts out with trying to hype this guy as some bad@$$ trying to reinvent himself as a sophisticated business man or socialite, While he just snarls and makes mean faces at the camera. Of course this movie is totally predictable and moves at a snails pace I actually nodded off a couple times waiting for something to happen. However when the action picks up its mostly Tarzan getting his arse kicked in every scene and you think this is the big tough guy they've been hyping up for 1 hour, Im not impressed. In one of the scenes a baddie says to Tarzan after easily defeating him, (The Boss will be disappointed at how easy this was) That's basically the way the whole movie is..Giving this movie 4 stars is like comparing Brittney spears to Mozart",1481241600,,914,4.408284023668639

Unrealistic in the fight between Tarzan and his ape brother but that's Hollywood.  Great love story and the scenery was stunning.  The CGI in the fight scene when the apes showed up to protect Tarzan were not done very well.  You could see the actors were just looking around and it didn't coincide with the ape CGI that was interposed in the movie.

7778721,5,B01H4FJR5W,"Skarsgard as created the most credible Tarzan ever! The film is a CG marvel which has wild creatures and the jungles of Africa inter-acting with the actors in a marvelous way. The story is the same fantastical, romantic adventure story we know from Burroughs books, but re-created with a wonderful sensitivity to the values of our time. Robbie (Jane) is no mere damsel in distress. Skargard's Tarzan is a much fuller character than the typical vine swinging he-man. Humor, danger, pathos, crises are all intertwined. The movie is fun to watch over and over again. Of course, I have always been a Tarzan fan -- this movie is the best yet.",1480809600,2,637,4.747747747747748
7778722,2,B01H4FJR5W,"Not terrible, but doesn't really measure up to the Tarzan of the Edgar Rice Burroughs' novels.  The villain in this movie, for instance, uses a necklace of prayer beads as his weapon of choice.  He is very skilled with this unusual weapon, but I kept thinking if anybody actually tried to fight the Tarzan of the novels with a necklace of prayer beads, they wouldn't last two seconds.  The Tarzan of the novels also relied on his skill with a number of weapons, to make up for his inherent weakness, compared to the other apes.  Those weapons make no appearance in this movie, and when he fights apes, he gets his butt kicked, which was his plan, apparently.

That said, the acting isn't bad, the special effects are good enough to make everything believable.  Just, to a guy who read every Tarzan novel there was to read, back when he was a teenager, it was kind of disappointing.",1480809600,5,881,4.544303797468355

7778724,2,B01H4FJR5W,"This movie didn't know what it wanted to be. It was mostly a war movie, mixed with what seemed like hundreds of close ups of people's eyes that lasted way too long. The music was dramatic and the filming was serious. But then they mixed in one or two comedy scenes, and Samual L. Jackson (who I love) was himself, but that didn't fit in with the theme they had going. You don't bring a modern person into a movie that you're trying to make old fashioned. To make it worse they stole scenes from Jurrasic Park and the forest looked very animated and Jerrasic Parkish only Jerrasic Park was much more realistic and that was filmed a way long time ago.

I was very surprised by just how bad this movie is. The flashbacks were the only interesting scenes and the only scenes were Jane was likeable and had some kind of character.

I will say Alexander did a great job acting. He was a perfect Tarzan. This movie could have been amazing if they had picked a direction they wanted to go with instead of trying to do everything and having it make no sense and have no flow. The story wasn't that good though. They turned Tarzan into The Beast Master so having it be the origional Tarzan story would have been much better.",1480809600,,1214,4.343612334801762

7778788,4,B01H4FJR5W,"I purchased Blu-Ray for $6.99 so it was great value. The movie?  Alexander Skarsgard's acting role was a pleasant surprise.  The scene between he and Jane was best upon their first meeting in the jungle.  The best scene may be considered the climax and heartfelt was Tarzan and his would be tribal foe.  Very genuine by both actors.  Touching.

The special effects was over the top.  Could have been out-of-the-park homerun with better integration of CGI and animals.  Better editing maybe.  I think filming in Africa would have pushed the budget but would have been well worth it.  The special effects could have been more tasteful.

There is not a lot of action in this movie like the trailer implies.  It is story driven.  Realistic attempt of making Tarzan a normal hero, not the iconic untouchable hero.  Displayed vulnerabilities.  The movie had a terrific villain.  The movie could have been terrific with set in Africa, better integration with CGI and animals, and more time spent with other animals in the jungle to show the bond with Tarzan.  Worth the price of purchase.",1480636800,2,1081,4.851648351648351

Its as if a statue is playing the role...no emotion whether good or bad permeates from Tarzan. Jane has full make-up even afters weeks in the jungle! The story itself has a ""who cares"" plot.
People do things they would not realistically do within the fictional scope of Burrows story. Even the animals that help him along the way are bad ""actors"".They do things as if they have a human mind, which is ridiculous. EVERYTHING here you have seen before in a better way!

7778829,5,B01H4FJR5W,Read all of Edgar Rice Burroughs books through HS.  Nothing on film has come close to the books.  Storyline was up to date without going off point.  Tarzan spoke 7 different languages and was a man of few words so critics wanting a more emotional character need to go back and read the books.  CGI was a little rough but did not take away from the storyline or the acting.  This is by far the best adaptation of ERB Tarzan Series.  About time.,1480377600,,443,4.27710843373494

Or is he going to be mega monkey man with the ability to speak with the animals or kick their butts monkey style if need be?  It winds up being a bit of both.  Although, in the end the director leans more toward realism and only goes comic book crazy occasionally.  I was hoping for a more Marvel Studios take on the lore.  Overall I found the film boring.

Gave the whole movie a well rounded feeling to it. The movie told more then just one story, although it didn't leave any of them unfinished.

7778939,2,B01H4FJR5W,"Peer at the lead character's name and a list of participating actors; it's basically just a game of connect the dots from there. Tarzan grows up amidst gorillas and swings on vines. Mean people shoot said gorillas, enslave natives and abduct Jane. Christoph Waltz is a posh, narcissistic, delicate-but-lethal villain. Samuel L. Jackson is persistently incredulous as he shouts lines of comic relief. Many strapping, bare-chested men decorate the fringes of the screen. Bellows are howled, trees are climbed, fires are set, vengeance is exacted, crocodiles are fed. Its most interesting scraps - Tarzan's means of communication with animals and his adult life as a reformed London citizen - are either forgotten until it's convenient for the plot or discarded completely. Watchable but bland, The Legend of Tarzan goes through the required motions but lacks much in the way of spirit or innovation.

The theme can be reduced to the tiresome ""Europeans bad, Africans good"" boilerplate that seems contractually required in mainstream Hollywood these days (a moral rubric that applies to all the characters except for Lord Greystoke/Tarzan who is redeemed by being raised by apes; and Jane who is redeemed by her selfless love of Africans).",1479600000,,554,5.379310344827586

7778950,3,B01H4FJR5W,"Although I had hoped for a bit more of an origin story than the short flashbacks in the movie, this version of Tarzan was better than I expected it to be.  The special effects and CGI was well done especially with the jungle animals.  The jungle scenery was beautiful as well with some breathtaking scenes.

It was a little hard for me to accept initially that Tarzan and Jane were now English socialites but by the time the movie played out, I did feel that Skarsgard and Robbie did a nice portrayal of the roles.  I am a fan of Samuel L Jackson and he is ok in his role of the real life figure George Washington Williams but it seemed like the writers were unsure how to insert him into the movie.  At times he seems to be there to provide some cheesy humor and other times, action-hero sidekick.  To me, the character seemed a bit out of place in the story.

The initial 30 minutes of the story was a bit slow going and kind of dragged a bit to me, but after that initial part of the movie, the story and action was entertaining and enjoyable to watch.  Although I was hoping for a bit more of Tarzans origin story in the film, at least this story is different than just a remake of the same movie over again.

Overall, I think that the story could have been paced a bit better with more of the initial Tarzan story with a few flaws but I do think it was a better movie than I expected with a different kind of story and worth watching.

One of the best tarzan actually, it was different from the others which made it more intriguing and interesting. Made it more entertaining and suspenseful. You didn't know what was gonna happen next.

7779143,3,B01H4FJR5W,"It was entertaining enough to sustain my interest, but I am a life-long Tarzan fan, having viewed all the movies, and read all the ERB books.  I was interested in seeing just how they did with this one.  Mostly I was disappointed.  It reached the height of silliness when T, his aboriginal colleagues, and, finally, T's pal Sam Jackson jump off a high cliff into the jungle trees far below or using vines swing onto the top of a fast moving train.  Are these Spiderman references?  Or maybe to James Bond?  We can argue about whether the impact of Christianity in 19th Century Africa was a net gain for the Continent, but the only Christian in this film is the arch villain who murders with a Rosary given him by a priest as a little boy, and there is a sufficient whiff of depravity for us to get that particular reference.  The T and Jane relationship was painted well.  There were flashbacks to T growing up among the Gorillas that were fun.  This film could have been a really good one, but went at least one special-effect too far and was simply inept in trying to contrive a commentary on the Western white man's exploitation of Central Africa.  I would give this four out of five yawns.",1479081600,,1193,4.456221198156682

7779160,5,B01H4FJR5W,"Edgar Rice Burroughs famous and beloved character Tarzan comes to life once more in this movie. Alexander Skarsgard take on the role and wears it like an old comfortable pair of jeans. I was stunned by how seamless the movie picks up it's own unique story line, sewing with it the original Tarzan story, along with parts of it's distant cousin Greystoke the Legend of Tarzan featuring Christopher Lambert. Skarsgard makes the role his own, and owns the movie and it's familiar but not familiar feel.  This is not your father's Tarzan, nor is it old, stayed out of time. No, this is truly one of the rare gems that got it right and it was an utter delight to watch it with my family. I encourage you to enjoy the movie and relive a part of your childhood within Edgar Rice' famous character, Tarzan!

** a note to parents: There is violence and there is fighting. I wouldn't want a small toddler or even K-2 grader to watch this. I'd say it's safe for 3rd grade and up to enjoy.

7779216,1,B01H4FJR5W,"I really, really wish I'd checked some of the reviews before renting this movie.  Absolute horrific destruction of Edgar Rice Burroughs's great novels.  Completely filled with liberal brainwashed tripe spewed forth to make the writers feel sanctimonious about themselves for not owning a slave or for not killing a wild animal for any reason... as if that's some great accomplishment in this day and age.  I really wanted to like this movie - I have great respect for several of the actors involved... but it was so pathetic that it was all I could do to watch it to the end.

I also regret that I'm forced to give it even a single star.  It doesn't even deserve that much credit.",1478736000,,680,4.586776859504132

I bit on this rendering of the Tarzan legend because my wife loves Alexander Skarsgard and Margot Robbie in particular.  She went out as Harley Quinn for Halloween.  This is an intricately paced film that builds to a crescendo and ultimately is a very satisfying experience.  Kudos to Director David Yates for challenging the audience by not just offering food for thought but visceral thrills as well.  It's a lush film with stunning camerawork and art direction.  The cast is uniformly excellent with Christoph Waltz and Samuel L. Jackson as standouts.

Alexander Skarsgrd as Tarzan matched Weissmuller 's work. He worked hard to shape his body to match the part.

I really hope some of this was filmed in Africa. Samuel L. Jackson, once again takes a strange added part and makes it outstanding. Margot Robbie as Jane, thank god that she is not some whiny help me, help me damsel in distress, although she kinda was in distress but never mind, yay for her. Christoph Waltz is the Belgian bad guy, he plays him with cool distance and disdain and I think he had a bit of a man-crush on Tarzan and Jane too? The entire support cast including the friends of Tarzan in Africa....superb. Now for the biggie! Alexander Skarsgard as Tarzan, thank you so much for doing it and getting it right. The perfect man for this, perfect (not too muscled) physique and just enough of the origin story to not bore us. thank you to all involved and I am hoping for part 2 very soon.",1478563200,10,951,4.409090909090909

7779313,2,B01H4FJR5W,"I am going to do a Top 7 List of why I think this movie is far over-rated on Amazon. Too many 5-Star ratings, IMHO.

Here it is:

SPOILER ALERT!!!

1)Ridiculous Samuel L Jackson comedy relief character. I can't recall his name in the movie, but his character tried to get laughs. I am saying ""TRIED to get laughs'. Terrible dumb jokes attempting to get the viewer to chuckle.

2)Jane acting like a hip mall-rat. She's so tough that being in the jungle alone is just like any other day. Same old, same old. She was raised a spoiled rich girl, but the jungle is nothing. Not scary at all.. predators? Whatever...

3)Terrible CGI effects of Tarzan swinging on vines! Looks like the Ninja Turtles skateboarding through the sewers in TMNT2.

4)Samuel L Jackson saying to Tarzan... 'does he want me to lick his nuts?' He's referring to a 500lb gorilla's nuts! Funny!

Yes, this is the Typical Comedy Bit that is supposed to make you laugh during this masterpiece Tarzan re-vamp.

5)Trust me... You will probably be ready for this movie to end when it ends...

6)Samuel L Jackson knows he just did it for the fat paycheck!!! I can't hate on that... He's a far better character actor than he is portrayed here. This is insulting to his talents, my opinion only. Alexander Sarsgard (True Blood) is decent, albeit as safe and ok as he should be here. Jackson is just filling a spot unfortunately.

7)I think ""Greystoke: The Legend Of Tarzan"" is a far superior Tarzan tale...

Thank you for reading! Muchas Gracias!

I may be right, I may be wrong....

Second of all, why does the "" bad guy "" kill people with a rosary?! A rosary does not stand for murder, I know this because it belongs to my religion.

He and Jane are married and living in England and he asked to go back to Africa for diplomatic reasons and the story then becomes very involved and he must return to his former life.  Great story I really enjoyed the way it was told and the actors were excellent. Samuel Jackson stars in this film and he plays an excellent friend to Tarzan.

7779420,5,B01H4FJR5W,The story of Tarzan has been told many times and in many different ways. Wondering how well this telling would go I purchased it. Much to my surprise and against many of the reviews I found it very well made and the story line very good. Set back and enjoy a good action packed story which really made more sense than many of the ones told about a child born in Africa and raised by a great ape. The events going on the the world in the late 19th century were used very nicely to make the movie often seem like it was historical.,1478304000,,529,4.096153846153846
7779421,3,B01H4FJR5W,I was somewhat disappointed with this DVD.  It was a little far fetched - even for a Tarzan movie.  Some of the scenery was very beautiful but much of the story line and writing was not that great....Loved how Alexander Skarsgard looked throughout the movie and his relationship with the animals.  But Samuel Jackson role didn't make much sense and his wife was pretty but she didn't add much to the scenes acting wise.  Loved Christopher Waltz - he didn't disappoint..but the overall writing was a let down.,1478304000,,508,4.738636363636363
7779422,5,B01H4FJR5W,"There's nothing like a legend to get your weekend off to great start! We enjoyed the movie and appreciated that no one was tortured on screen in a manner that makes you want to cringe and turn your eyes away. Skarsgard was great. I liked how he easily transitioned from society to jungle without so much as a day to get re-oriented. The flashbacks were well done filling in the history along the way for those who may not have the background. In spite of the pain people force upon each other, the movie had a happy ending. I love a movie with clear story lines and easy to follow character development. We will watch this again.",1478304000,,629,4.384615384615385

7779450,5,B01H4FJR5W,"I am thrilled to say that this movie delves deep into the Man/Beast psyche of John Clayton III 5th Earl of Greystroke. I'm also thrilled to say that the acting is first rate, the production values superb and the best Jane since the incredible Maureen Sullivan. Alexander Skarsgard, imbues Tarzan with a wry humor, a intense inner anguish of the conflicting instincts raging inside of him. The desire to be what his parents expected at his birth, with the primal environment that shaped his life is his constant anguish. Jane proves to be more than a worthy mate for him as she loves and excepts all that he is without reservation. I'm almost tempted to say this Jane is better than the books' Jane but I haven't finished them yet. So far, Miss Jane Porter of the books is far too concerned with self-sacrifice for others.

7779465,4,B01H4FJR5W,"'John Clayton / Tarzan' (Alexander Skarsgard) who as a baby had been brought up in the Jungle by the apes now lives in
his ancestral home as Lord Greystoke with his now wife 'Jane'(Margot Robbie)
They have settled comfortably into their new life-style away from the Jungle, leaving the past behind them, however 'John'
will be asked to return via the British Prime Minister by King Leopold to report on the Congo's development, 'John' declines.
A while later American-Envoy 'George Washington Williams' (Samuel L Jackson) who recognises 'John' from the 'Tarzan' stories
he'd read convinces 'John' that he should go telling of the troubles that have engulfed the place he'd once called home.
'George' wants to accompany 'John' on the investigation into the many rumours he'd been told of, 'Jane' insists despite being
told of the dangers on joining her husband on the trip.
After the initial meeting with old-friends including animals, the extent of what is happening becomes apparent....a ruthless
agent of King Leopold 'Leon Rom' (Christoph Waltz) is gathering slaves and stripping the Congo of it's riches in Diamonds.
'Rom' kidnaps 'Jane' in the hope of trapping 'John / Tarzan' ....which is why 'John' had been invited back to the territory by
the Belgian King, it had been intended that 'John' would be taken, however 'George' had foiled the attempt.
'Tarzan' accompanied by a tribesman and  'George' (who will have trouble keeping up) now give chase in an effort to rescue
'Jane' who is held on 'Rom's' steamboat as it steams down river.
There will be encounters with 'Tarzan's' former family 'The Apes' along the way .....
'John /Tarzan' will need the help of his many Jungle-Friends and Tribesmen when it comes too as 'Rom' has a large military
force at his disposal based in the Town at the River estuary....
A very different slant on the Tarzan tale, certainly not as many like myself who have seen countless Tarzan adventures down the
years remember it to be, however, with this new-adventure i wasn't sure what to expect in truth though i knew with the special
-effects at the studio's disposal these days the visual content was likely to be quite a spectacle (as indeed it proved to be)...the
film an action-packed adventure which despite it's faults i did enjoy, though i'm uncertain how it would be followed-up ?....certainly worthy of a glance.

7779491,1,B01H4FJR5W,"This movie is terrible and I wish I had never bought it. There is absolutely nothing redeeming about this version. The story is shallow and predictable. The dialogue is awful. Jane is as 2-dimensional as a character can be. The cinematography is fake. The movie was filed in a studio in England and they attempted to ""back drop"" Africa into it. But it looks awful; meaning the green screen work is so bad. I've seen better work in cable TV. The CG work is pathetic. The scene with the animals trampling the army village near the end looks like little computer generated rabbits. The proportions don't work. And then there is Samuel Jackson. What a terrible casting job. He's old (yeah, I get it, can't say that, but its true), yet he's supposed to be keeping up with Tarzan running through the jungle. It doesn't work. It's not realistic. It looks fake. He looks like he should be in a wheel chair. Combined that with some angles where he's running on air because the green screen doesn't match. What an absolute pathetic attempt. They claim it took 3 months to file. I think maybe 3 days. Save yourself the 2 hours and take a nap instead of watching this tripe. Blah!",1478044800,7,1168,4.540284360189573

Having grown up with Saturday morning re-runs of old Johnny Weissmuller and Buster Crabbe movies, along with a few newer remakes, like the Daniel Day Lewis version, I simply didn't see where else this franchise could go, but I was most pleasantly surprised. The acting was marvelous and completely in character; the cinematics were spectacular, and the special effects nonpareil. Simply splendid, highly entertaining, and I'm convinced Edgar Rice Burroughs would be most satisfied, if not thrilled, with Alexander Skarsgard's interpretation.

7779576,4,B01H4FJR5W,"First things first - this was, for any adventure movie lover, a good adventure movie.  It had fights, trains, vertiginous heights, lost tribes, cool shots of 1800s steamers, close encounters with wild beasts, a damsel in distress, the obligatory bad guy.  For any firearm aficionado you can feast your eyes on m1889 Schmidt-Rubins, Maxim machine guns, Walker Colts, Turk Mausers, etc.  There's lots of high action, killer scenes of Tarzan swinging through the jungle that are easily the best done scenes of any Tarzan movie extant.

For most Tarzan fans who have never really read a Tarzan story - it's a good Tarzan movie with most all the crucial elements you've come to expect except with the bonus of being minus the 'dumb Tarzan' thing that I never understood (although there is a reference made to that).  Inaccurately, he is depicted as being able to speak to all the animals, they're all his friends, etc.  Exactly as any fan of the movie Tarzan might expect.  Except it never happened in the books.

For the Tarzan fans who have actually read some or all of the original novels there were a couple things I would have changed. Chiefly, Tarzan got his arse handed to him on too many occasions.  I know it builds tension when the good guy gets knocked down a few times but finally stands victorious on the field of battle in the end, and that's fine.  I don't wish to add any spoilers so I won't give any specific examples, but there were at least a couple of those fight scenes that, having read and reread the source material (or what I assume would be the source material - considering that this is Hollywood we're talking about that source material might be anything including their own highly inaccurate movies of the past) that Tarzan should have come out more victorious.  This is, after all, the guy that vanquished the savage Kerchak as a teenager - the former king of Tarzan's ape tribe - with his bare hands and his father's hunting knife.  I've never read a Tarzan story where he got his butt whooped so many times.

The Edgar Rice Burroughs fans, and I'm one of 'em,  always tend to be highly critical of every detail that doesn't match up 1:1 to the original novels.  But this is true of any fan of any written work that makes it into film.  We always want to see those things we've imagined from the written descriptions leap to vivid life on the big screen  But when they don't, or when Hollywood perverts them, well - we all know the saying: the book was better than the movie.  I wonder when Hollywood will hear that phrase and take it to heart?  I'm not willing to offer any spoilers for those who haven't seen the film, but there are definitely elements that were changed or left out that would certainly affect any possible sequels based on our favorite novels (Tarzan and the Jewels of Opar for one, and I would dearly love to see La brought to life as Disney did with Dejah Thoris, where Lynn Collins created a mesmerizing vision of ERB's Princess of Helium).  To the true fan you will instantly miss the antagonistic relationship in this movie that Tarzan always had with the cat family, and you will note the absence of all the familiar ape words: Numa, Sabor, Tantor, Gimla, Paco, etc - all conspicuously missing.  And while Tarzan only ever befriended the one lion, Jad Bal Ja, that I'm aware of, you might scoff when he stumbles unaware upon a group of lions feasting on a kill (that he never smelled beforehand by the way since all his heightened senses of hearing and smell and eye sight are also conspicuously missing) and instantly begins communing with one of them.  If anyone is really interested in seeing a scene that perfectly depicts Tarzan's true relationship with Numa the Lion in gripping accuracy google Boris Valejo's cover for Tarzan the Magnificent - that piece of art is a perfect rendition of how Tarzan reacted to Numa.",1477958400,,3874,4.60844250363901

7779581,5,B01H4FJR5W,"This movie employs this popular film technique of mirroring past events with a tie in to what is happening now. By employing this, director, David Yates adds substance to what otherwise would be a campy film. While not an origin story, we learn facts about the life of of Tarzan (AKA John Clayton, Lord of Greystoke - Tarzan's real name and title). In this movie, Tarzan who has been living in England with Jane returns to the African jungle to help uncover what a mysterious man, Captain Leon Rom (Christopher Walz) is doing for the Belgian ruler, King Leoplod. Accompanying Tarzan (Alexander Skarsgard) are his wife, Jane (Margot Robbie) and Dr. George W. Williams (Samuel L. Jackson). The three are joined by others in Africa. When the truth is revealed, it is up to Tarzan to save his wife, his boyhood land/nation and preserve a people marked for slavery. The inclusion of top-notch CGI and eye-popping FX add to the high level of thrills and action. This is a very good film .I am confident that Tarzan author, Edgar Rice Burroughs, would approve of this film version.

So, embrace a ne world of the jungle, Tarzan!",1477872000,,1121,4.719387755102041

7779630,3,B01H4FJR5W,"David Yates, of Potter movie fame, delivers us his interpretation of the iconic literary hero initially brought to life, on the page, by Edgar Rice Burroughs.  Although the tale is no stranger to the film reboot, this venture is a somewhat fresh and stunning take on the Lord of the Jungle.  The cast is stellar, with passionate performances, albeit it's now hard to see Robbie as anyone else but Harley Quinn.  However it's the cinematography and visuals that make this an epic outing, quickly eclipsing an otherwise painfully predictable and bit overtly simplistic script.  If you have seen the recent retelling of Disney's Jungle Book, anytime before this flick, you immediately feel as though this is nothing more than the ""grown up"" version of that.  I'm not entirely sure if Kipling would feel complimented by that or not.  Also, quite disappointing is the action, which in certain scenes, happens too rapidly to thoroughly enjoy.

These were my favorite TV shows as a young child.  Thie Legend of Tarzan movie was the icing on the cake. The last movie I remember was when Tarzan went to New York (I think Johnny Weissmuller) was the actor then.  This movie allowed me to see him in his aristocratic element,but never forgetting where he came from and who took care of him after his parents were killed.  I believe in the original movie, Tarzan's parents were killed in a plane crash.  This movie shows the mother dying from the elements and his dad being killed by some bad apes.  I'm assuming that this Tarzan is a 3rd generation Tarzan because of his age, but then again, Jane speaks of the jungle as her home.  Both Tarzan and Jane are young, which leads me to believe that they are 3rd generation and walked in the footsteps of their parents and grandparents.

Just a good all around Tarzan movie with natives, apes, elephants and lions. The CGI makes him look super hero-ish sometimes, but well done with the animals of the jungle. I liked it. Margot Robbie was good as Jane. I hope the sequel shows them living in the jungle up in the trees together.",1477612800,,466,4.4941176470588236

7779684,4,B01H4FJR5W,"The Legend of Tarzan was a lot different plot to what I thought it was going to be before watching it.  This is not a bad thing, just something to point out if you're expecting simply a remake of past Tarzan movies.  This isn't an how Tarzan becomes Tarzan tale, instead Tarzan is part of British aristocracy, he's living under his birthrite name in London wearing a three piece suit and dining with European leaders.  He has no desire to go back to the African Congo when invited to do so and only eventually decides to from peer pressure from Samuel L Jackson's character who portrays the facts, as how else does a bankrupt royalty function without slaves.  Those slaves likely the very people he grew up with (when not growing up with apes and other African creatures).  So he goes back and of course has to kick the bad guys a to make things right.  Jane also isn't going to be told to stay at home in London.  At one point his character is mocked with the old Me Tarzan, You Jane line, which doesn't really make sense as in this scenario, he is Tarzan so there wouldn't have been a fictional character Tarzan movie the mocker could have watched.

There's a lot of CGI animals interacting with Skarsgrd, who for the female audience's viewing pleasure, once he takes his shirt off, doesn't bother to put it back on.  The CGI animals look quite good, but it's still obvious they're CGI.  But obviously it would be impossible to use real apes, lions, elephants and other animals in these scenarios.  Some of the vine and jumping down into trees landing on thick horizontal branch's without injury is a bit ridiculous and very fake looking, but again you can live with that.  I thought Skarsgrd ohhh oyeay ahhh catchphrase could have used a bit of work as it lacked a bit of the intimidation factor, but overall he did a pretty good job. Samuel L Jackson as George Washington Williams and Margot Robbie as Jane are also very good in their roles.",1477612800,,1945,4.50997150997151
7779685,3,B01H4FJR5W,"The characters of Tarzan and Jane are engaging, too bad that's not what this movie is about.  Tarzan and Jane spend the entire movie apart.  What I liked most about this movie was the flashbacks of when Tarzan and Jane met, wish they would have made that movie.  This movie tries and fails to make a buddy movie with Tarzan and Dr. Williams.  Samuel L. Jackson is completely out of place in this movie, he even ruins the end where Tarzan and Jane are finally reunited.  Hey, director, I don't want to see Samuel L. Jackson grinning and leering, I want to see Tarzan and Jane kiss.  The only reason I gave this 3 stars is because Alexander Skarsgard and Margot Robbie are excellent.",1477612800,,681,4.451612903225806

This takes some liberties with the story written by Edgar Rice Burroughs and begins in the future, where John Clayton III (Tarzan) and Jane are married and happily living at their English estate.  Samuel Jackson plays an American, George Washington Williams, who wishes to go to the Congo to investigate atrocities instigated by Captain Leon Rom, doing the bidding of King Leopold of Belgium.  He convinces Tarzan to go with him.  Along the way, Tarzan must defend himself against Chief Mbonga for killing his son who killed Kala, his ape mother.  In the end, everyone seems to work their problems out and the evil Rom meets his maker thanks to some hungry crocodiles.

The story line is there, though pretty weak.  If it weren't for the amazing Alexander Skarsgard, I probably would've shut if off much earlier.  And you never see Tarzan doing his call of the wild; you hear it from others' vantage point, but never do you see him call the animals, who come to his aide like the other Tarzan storylines.",1477526400,,1018,4.711864406779661

Jane was really good in the show the actress who played her done a great job. And that's the best looking Jane in long time if you don't count Disney's anime Jane.

7779811,4,B01H4FJR5W,"David Yates who is responsible for the direction of the immensely popular Harry Potter series turns that same degree of attention to detail and magic to this retelling Edgar Rice Burroughss tale of Tarzan stories as adapted very well for the screen Adam Cozad and Craig Brewer. Treating the story as more of an historical drama rather than just a jungle movie, this version of Tarzan is smart, well scripted, beautifully photographed (Henry Braham), and boasts an excellent cast of actors.

The film opens with wondrously beautiful images of the African jungles over which is superimposed the history of the story we are about to experience. John Clayton (the magnificently sculpted hunk Alexander Skarsgrd) following his parents' death in Africa was raised by an ape being called Tarzan, left Africa to go to his parents' home in England along with the woman he fell in love with and married, Jane Porter (Margot Robbie). Living in London is asked by Belgian King Leopold to go to Africa to see what he has done there to help the country. Though at first refusing to leave the comforts of England, he eventually agrees when a Black American, George Washington Williams (Samuel L. Jackson) wants him to accept so he can accompany him, stating that Leopold might be committing all sorts of atrocities to achieve his goal of the slave trade: Williams must prove the corruption. Clayton agrees and his wife insists that she accompany him because she misses Africa. The trio goes to Africa, but when they arrive they meet a man - Rom (Christoph Waltz) - who works for Leopold, they are attacked and captured.  With Washington's help John/Tarzan escapes and sets out to rescue Jane by going across the jungle with Washington.

Yes, everyone knows the story, but it is the telling and the timely emphasis on the cruelties of slavery that make the film more poignant. It is beautiful to watch and with a cast that is able to convince us of the veracity of the tale is make a fine film. Grady Harp, October 16",1477440000,,2001,4.777456647398844
7779812,4,B01H4FJR5W,"Not as bad as everyone is saying. I think Alexander was the perfect choice for Tarzan. Margot Robbie (a blond) was my least favorite part about the whole movie. She seemed lackluster and disconnected. Scenery was beautiful, all else was fine. The action scenes were ""blurry,"" and Samuel Jackson seemed out of place. Christopher Waltz was the best part of the movie, he's my favorite villain.",1477440000,,391,4.9393939393939394

7779817,5,B01H4FJR5W,"I really enjoyed the remake of Tarzan, particularly in the way his back story was told in flash backs. Most folks who have watched various actors play Tarzan are familiar with how and who he became. Enjoyed this story as it was told from a historical perspective from that time. Enslaving the congalese people to profit from the killing of elephants for ivory, to work in the mines for the diamonds. In order once again for power and greed. The woman that played his wife was strong and independent of Tarzan. I liked the fact that she was a feminist before her time. By the way I saw it in a theater as well as buying a DVD to rewatch the small nuances I missed in the theater.

You can never please everyone when telling a old story. This is an action packed 5+ movie with a great story behind it. I wouldnt mind seeing a different version where his roots and his upbringing is a bigger part. But that wasn't this movie and some people just don't like it because of that. This is more in the ""Action"" category then a ""Love/Drama"" what some people would have liked to see. The goal of the story and the type of the movie I expected was 100% fulfilled based on the preview. So I completely disagree with the bad reviews this story has gotten and this movie deserved to be in the theaters as a number 1 seller compared to the rest of the movies.",1477353600,,838,4.412903225806452
7779831,4,B01H4FJR5W,"If you don't know by now, The Legend of Tarzan is not the same formula of previous movies.

This movie begins somewhere around 8-10 years after Tarzan and Jane have left Africa, and have tried to establish themselves into English society. I particularly enjoyed the change of pace in the story  telling of Tarzan, and liked the relationship of grown up/married Tarzan and Jane. I thought Alexander Skarsgard and Margo Robbie did well conveying the depth of their character's relationship. I thought the writer), director, and Skarsgard did a believable conveyance of the balancing act Tarzan performs between his more animalistic side and this newly required Anglicized persona he has adopted. As such, the inevitable transition he must make during the movie once back in Africa is believable.

A few criticisms are: the near uselessness of Samuel Jackson's character (seems to primarily serve as the vehicle for the audience to receive exposition), the feeling of a severely shortened/edited storyline (or possible just under developed) of Djimon Hounsou's Chief Mbonga, Christoph Waltz's lines are at times inaudible.

Verdict: Entertaining and worth watching if you are in the mood for an action/adventure movie, but don't look too closely for substance (revelatory or otherwise).",1477353600,,1283,5.3681592039801

7779887,1,B01H4FJR5W,"This COULD HAVE been a very enjoyable family movie. The scenery was often close to stunning, packed full of action and good tensions, the language for the most part clean, and was an interesting take on the basic Tarzan story, BUT Sheesh! It ""looks"" on the surface like a family oriented movie, but is certainly is NOT appropriate for children, and rather irritating and somewhat disgusting, for this adult, anyway. This movie's underlying straight-through theme seems to be animal and aviary sexual sensuality. A female star, right out of modern-day-girl, made it even less appealing.

Great CG and cinematography.  Alexander Skarsgard's portrayal of Tarzan was credible.... just an outstanding performance.  Christopher Waltz played a great villain... the kind you love to hate... as he always does.  I generally love Margot Roby... but her acting in her role as Jane was just a bit on the ""too cute"" side.

Tarzen get a invite to go back to the country where he was raised with the gorillas. The country is not safe no more but Jane wants to go. The invite that Tarzen got to go was a lie. Years ago Tarzen gorilla mom got killed by a tribe leader son. Tarzen killed the leader son. The leader of the tribe wants to kill Tarzen.

In fact, this movie did not do these talented actors any favors! So, I guess you could say that I wasted my time and money.

7780140,1,B01H4FJR5W,"Oh dear, what went wrong here... The director threw away all the romance of the legend of Tarzan, tossed characterization and plot development out the window for the sake of a throwaway story line and some poor CGI. What exactly is the legend of Tarzan? Surely not his few lines of cliched dialogue. Surely not his almost nonexistent relationship with Jane. Certainly not his  barely touched-upon relationship with the gorillas. The only redeeming quality of this movie was Samuel L. Jackson. If not for him, this movie would have been a complete and utter waste. Plot is basically some African guy wants Tarzan killed because he killed his son. When this might have happened we have no idea, because T is back in England at the beginning of the movie, living as a lord. Why should I care about his guy and his son? Why should I care about Tarzan? He's got zero personality in this version. Very disappointing all around.",1476921600,,921,4.720496894409938

BUT FINALLY, we have one who lives up to what ERB envisioned in his books. This movie was loosely based on the Opar book, but had more if a plot. It also mixes historical figures into the storyline, which was refreshing. I loved Skarsgard as John Clayton and when he and Jane get to Africa, he changes into a very believable Tarzan. They, thankfully, redesigned the Tarzan yell and the Great Apes Kala and Akut , were VERY life like! I also loved the idea that as he reverts to Tarzan he gradually sheds clothes, he is only in a ""loin cloth"" at the end.

As you would expect, it is full of action, but manages to bring a human side to both Tarzan and Jane which is explored in a very cool way.  Alexander Skarsgard is made for this role, and presents the character of Tarzan in perfectly believable manner.  Samuel L. Jackson has a very interesting supporting role as representative of the U.S. Govt who accompanies Tarzan on his adventures.  I am old enough to have seen Tarzan movies all the back to Johnny Weismuller, and I can honestly say that I enjoyed this movie the best of all of the previous Tarzans and their movies.

The world had not been charted. Unknown areas existed and the concept of lost races seemed credible.

The movie is somewhat of a mash-up of ""Tarzan and the Jewels of Opar"". Being a fan of the pure, classic stories, I would have preferred a story line more closely resembling the original novel, but this works! The computer assisted and enhanced scenes are breathtaking. The sanctity of Tarzan's relationship with the animals is handled in a touching and sensitive manner. Tarzan's family history and deep love and devotion to his wife is very uplifting.

By contrast, Opar itself, its history and its people are treated in a superficial, cartoonish manner. We know nothing about the inhabitants really except that they have diamonds that the evil, indebted king of Belgian can sure use!

The bad guys in the source novel are Arabs, not Belgians except for the prime antagonist, who is indeed Belgian, but in the employ of a criminal Arab. I guess this central feature was scrapped by the Hollywood PC crowd. This political pandering left me disappointed.

Overall opinion:  See the movie! You'll love it! Read the book. You'll love it too!",1476662400,,1348,4.868995633187773

7780367,5,B01H4FJR5W,"Rarely do I watch a film that I immediately want to watch again.  This is one of those films.  I actually appreciated the fact that Tarzan's origin was explained in well-timed flashbacks versus dominating the main story line.  I really liked seeing more of a final version of Tarzan's character, then loved seeing how he returns to his old life, embracing his wild nature to save Jane and the congo.  Sometimes when you have a character that can swing through the jungle, there's a potential for some pretty corny and unbelievable scenes, but I STRAIGHT UP BELIEVED EVERY MOMENT OF IT.  So well done.  The only scene where I cringed a little was when George Williams climbed onto Tarzan's back and they swing onto a moving train.  But all that was forgiven due to the epic and surprisingly moving score playing during the scene.  Honestly, the whole film was moving.  Loved it.",1476662400,6,877,4.717105263157895

It was good as Tarzan movies go but from Elmo Lincoln To Johnny Weismueller to ......the screen writers took waaaaaaaaaayyy too much liberty with Edgar Rice Burroughs' story lines. These writers tried a little harder, but to be fair to ERB we would need a Peter Jackson repeating his performance of Lord Of The Rings. And, after all, I think there were about 27 Tarzaqn books written so, PLENTY of material.  The CG did, finally, after maybe almost a century, allow Tarzon to swing through the trees as ERB wrote that he did.  That was gratifying.

Where ERB wrote something that, for the time, was progressive...the people of Africa were intelligent and the animals had a true sense of being...this is the first time I've seen a movie that reflects those ideas. CGI was top notch, the scenery was simple, yet amazing, and the linguistics were great. The story line is meant to be more of a parallel reality than a realistic picture, and they did a good job with this. I think using Samuel L. Jackson's character to place this against a historic background that Americans could relate to was brilliant. ERB would have loved this. Keep in mind, he also wrote the Mars series as well as a ton of other early sci-fi works. Everything in those works was about intelligent action in the face of adversity and blending human truths with the world around you whether it was in the deepest recesses of ""the wild"" or the far flung reaches of the galaxy.

The casting was perfection - I was thrilled to see Simon Russell Beale whom we love in ""Penny Dreadful""!!  Skarsgard was the embodiment of Tarzan, a subtle, sophisticated performance, and we loved how he integrated into his life in England and even showed the kids his disfigured hands and his face portrayed his feelings for the animals.  I'd never seen Margot Robbie in anything, and was so impressed - she was Jane to a ""T"", also a beautifully underplayed performance perfectly blending bravery, love for Tarzan and beauty.  Samuel L. Jackson actually made me forget he was Samuel L. Jackson (even with that trademark voice), and had me convinced he was George, evoking a more sharp-shootin' Charles Martin Smith from ""Untouchables"" looking for proof of atrocities by King Leopold!  Christoph Waltz was almost Alan Rickman like (*almost*) of a villain as Leon Rom. Djimon Hounsou shows a great deal of emotion as the chief, perfect casting again.
I was so relieved the movie didn't tear too much at the heartstrings but still respected the tragedies of ivory trade, blood diamonds, and slavery.
Bravo!!  I can see why the stupid critics didn't like it, it was too ""true"" and authentic, like John Carter which they also panned.

I have had movies with good critic reviews fall short of my expectations and as in this movie I loved it. Being a lover of historical pieces I feel the story could have been told in 2 movies and been drawn out longer. It was a bit rushed. I loved that they inserted flashbacks with the trails of being a human in the world of apes and the first meeting with Jane.  I grew up on Tarzan having a father that was a huge fan and also remember the television series. My parents  would have loved it.  Alex really did pull off the persona well and the emphasis on the muscle tone that would have developed had he actually been raised and lived with apes helped this persona. I could really see the result of a human raised by apes which is not so far fetched as some might think. So many movies today fall back on CGI to carry the movie and I do not feel it did that. This is my opinion and each to his own but I would see a prequel and a sequel if they were to write and film them.",1476489600,,1109,3.9419642857142856

7780532,5,B01H4FJR5W,"Ive read most of ERB books and couldn't wait to see this movie but because of the awful reviews I didn't see this at the movies.  Im actually surprised at the ridiculous reviews the critics gave - they missed the mark on this one. Id throw a rotten tomato at them!

This movie isn't perfect but its the closest rendition to ERBs Tarzan  finally! Its overall portrayal was great. There were moments I thought yeah right  jumping off a cliff into the trees and the lengthy vine swings and of course the movie is a bit predictable but thats Tarzan and any other superhero movie  good guy saves girl and kills bad guy!

Skarsgrds performance was excellent. His portrayal of Tarzan had heart and his ability to commune with nature was believable. He really captured the spirit of Tarzan.  I thought he portrayed an accurate rendition of ERBs civilized John Clayton a former wild man who managed to blend in to civil society. I liked the way the storyline starts where  Clayton is living in England as the Earl of Greystoke and events remind Clayton of his home in the Congo. The flashbacks scenes were great and gave you enough to see his early years. I would love to see a Skarsgrd prequel from the early years of Tarzan and his dependence on his mother great ape to him becoming a civilized Earl of Greystoke  - although not another Greystoke

The portrayal of the great apes/ mangani was the best rendition ever.  In the First book, Tarzan of the Apes ERB describes them as huge, fierce, and terrible. the most fearsome of these awe-inspiring progenitors of man. He adds that they're a species closely allied to the gorilla, yet more intelligent. The apes depicted in the movie were just that!

Jacksons role was a little odd & unnecessary. His 21st century dialogue while comical and entertaining, I just felt his character did not quite fit in. Robbies performance was great as a very feisty adventurous Jane.  Waltz, while an excellent actor, I thought his villainous presence weak, maybe I am tired of seeing the same kind of villain. Djimon Hounsous performance was powerful and quite moving.

Visually this movie is stunning with absolutely beautiful cinematography. Im no expert on CGI but to me the animals looked real. I really loved the interaction of Tarzan and the animals and would like to have seen more of this. There is little to no foul language. I wouldnt watch this with very young children the ape fight scenes would be quite frightening.

Go see the movie and enjoy it.",1476489600,,2488,4.674311926605505

7780537,1,B01H4FJR5W,"Anti-climatic, choppy sequencing, stereotypical African people, ridiculous dynamics all put together in such close proximity; village, tarzan's ""hometown"" apes, an enormous tribe of brutish men seemingly living in isolation with no women.  Just like all other remakes of old movies it doesn't seem to be taken very seriously in terms of employing new ideas or plot twists.  The fight between Tarzan and brother defies even fantasy.  They do these movies now because with CGI they can add eye candy to the experience, and that is all that's new.  I must  to stop renting these remakes because they are always a huge disappointment, but there's nothing else on.  Comedy has been horrible for 30 years now, unless ya like pee, poop and sperm movies.  Drama doesn't offer anything new.  Once in a while a gem pops up like Mad Max: Fury Road which had a new twist and wasn't overdone with CGI.  What made the end of Tarzan anti-climatic, SPOILER, was it happened so fast and in a dull manner.  Of course the antagonist, Christopher Walz survived the strafing of a dinghy, and with a rosary secured Tarzan around the neck and to the rail of the boat.  Yes, a rosary.  As Tarzan struggles he squeaks out a call to crocodiles, and they come and suddenly consume the antagonist, or at least that is the idea we are left with.  END SPOILER.  Boring.  I must stop watching remakes with the hopes of new ideas being combined with CGI eye candy.  Oh I almost forgot, sometimes i felt I was watching another rendition of the contemporary Planet Of The Apes movies, since they appeared and behaved like the brutish apes in Planet Of... although those movies were more creative and entertaining.  These remakes don't seem to have any heart in them.  They seem to be an opportunity to apply new SFX to old tales.  Just because the technology can be used doesn't mean it should.  Christopher was wasted.  He was simply abrasive and evil.  His talent is waste as he did not get to use his expertise in subtlety and comedy.",1476403200,,2003,4.679083094555874

7780548,1,B01H4FJR5W,"Boring, slow and predictable. I've seen most of the Tarzan movies (including the Weissmuller Tarzan movies) and this was not one of the best. Had they not included a sidekick who in essence saves Tarzan and more than once, this might not have been as bad a movie. Tarzan should have been able to do it all by himself with the help of the animals and the natives, after all he was King of the Jungle. The other problem is that the movie is very slow at times and I fast forwarded through those sections. Everything is predictable and there really isn't that much action and what there is, is not that good.

However, if you have never seen a Tarzan movie or read any of the books then you might like this one because you won't be expecting some of what happens.",1476403200,,760,4.314685314685315

Tarzan interacted with the animal, he communicated with them he knew them and they knew him it was ever bit the character of old with Johnny Weissmuller and Maureen O'sullivan . I missed the dialogue that Tarzan usually did in the old movies, but thoroughly enjoyed his interactions with the animals and how the Lord of the Jungle called them to his aid.

7780654,1,B01H4FJR5W,"As always, this film loses a star for using CGI to begin with - It loses two more for absolutely abusing the process.

Worst Tarzan yell EVER! The 2016 ""Legend of Tarzan"" is about as bad a film as I have seen in years - Such a slow start - over the top FAKE CGI action - almost no real story. This thing could have been done in 15 minutes.

CGI doing what CGI does, I couldn't bring myself to feel feel any sense of wonder at the visual - there is no sense of any real effort or an honest genuine cinematic accomplishment. It's downright ""cheaply"" made.

BEFORE you try to convince me otherwise, this is MY review and my opinion regarding the use of CGI in film has not changed in over 30 years - it's not gonna change today. If practical effects are harder to do, too dangerous to do, too expensive to do - more than they are worth... write around the scene or do the WHOLE thing as a book - simple. If for no other reason, all the wonderful, talented, FX people, model makers and set designers the industry was once known for, may never work again...that's just not right. For instance MUCH of the background scenery generated by CGI in this movie could have been shot against a well made backdrop, or hand drawn and painted , frame by frame. The action sequences would have been more convincing with well made miniatures or full size mock-ups.",1476230400,3,1346,4.312252964426878

Pulling bits and pieces from several of the books and adding a bit of their own, they still stayed completely true to the soul of Tarzan and Jane, and their relationship.  Loved the action scenes, the visuals, the plot... everything. I laughed, I cried, I swooned, I gasped.  Completely satisfying movie for me, in every way.",1476144000,,552,4.545454545454546
7780667,5,B01H4FJR5W,THE LEGEND OF TARZAN was the second best time I had at the movies this summer. Everything other movie after CAPTAIN AMERICA:CIVIL WAR came up short for me. THE LEGEND OF TARZAN remains true to the spirit of Edgar Rice Burroughs 23 novels. This is despite being set in a time period about 25 years before the character made his first appearance. This is the most minor of quibbles. We have a fine actor in the role in Alexander Skarsgaard. The chemistry between his Jane (Margot Robbie) and his Tarzan is electric. Fine support is lent by Samuel L. Jackson and Christoph Waltz. Director David Yates has in my opinion done a masterful job presenting origin materials without bogging down his plot. The action sequences are exceptional especially the finale which recalls the horrible war Tarzan waged against the Kaiser's African army in the novel TARZAN THE TERRIBLE. It is movie that is enhanced by 3D but can be enjoyed flat as well. Anyone who is a fan of the original novels should love this movie. It is a shame the poor box office has probably precluded any sequels but I am happy to have this in my collection.,1476144000,12,1116,4.613065326633166

When he is approached by George Washington Williams (Jackson) to travel back to Africa in order to investigate claims of slavery. When he arrives they realize it is a trap and Jane is kidnapped. Now Tarzan and Williams must travel to deepest Africa in order to not only save Jane, but save the slaves as well. This is a good movie that I enjoyed but started to get a little board with. The movie starts off decent but slowly began to lose speed. The fact that this was a different look at the same old story that has been told a thousand times really helps make the movie feel interesting and new. That said, this movie contains everything you want in a Tarzan movie and those that love the Tarzan legend will enjoy this.

This adaptation needed more.  More character development; more story development, and more interaction with the animals -- what we all really want to see.

The two stars are for the scenery and costums which were beautiful.  Where ""Graystoke, The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes"" succeeds this fails.  I remember getting teary eye at the older movie, but felt nothing for this new version.  There is just no soul in this movie.  The emotional connection between his mother gorrilla and his gorrilla family is not shown only hinted at.  An integral part of the story, his transition from wildman to civilized is totally skipped.  I had to skip most of the Jane character parts.  There was no chemistry between the actors.  But there were other many problems with the movie.  I so wanted to like this movie that I was even willing to forgo the improbable idea of a man having a fight with a gorrilla and ending up in one piece.

The people and place are the stars for me, and I think that was deliberate on the studio's part. It's not that Tarzan isn't heroic but he isn't portrayed as some lone wolf superhero either. He needs people (and animals, duh) as much as they seem to need him. The plot has some pretty worn tropes and barebones narrative, chief of which is this connection to America.  I feel they were rushed into life and never given space to develop, nor given that depth that allows actors to show without telling. Maybe the casting or the writing, but to a large extent I felt they were archetypal shells to drive the conflict more conveniently but could have really been assets outside of two-dimensions. Skarsgard did right by the title character both in training for the physicality and playing it with quiet minimalism.

In my opinion it lost it's way by way too much political correctness in its attempts to portray the natives in this story. I was however pleased with the stunts and the ape costumes.
I was also very impressed with Skarsgard's Tarzan and Lord Clayton in my imagination that is how I envisioned Burrough's Lord of the Jungle when I first read about him over sixty years ago.
I wish they had gone into more detail of Tarzan's early years in the jungle and his friendship with some of his jungle animal friends and of course his jungle enemy friends.

7780738,5,B01H4FJR5W,"Wonderful cinematography.  Wonderful story variation.  Well acted by Alexander Skarsgard, Samuel L. Jackson and Margot Robbie.  First Tarzan movie to provide a more realistic insight into the brutal, unchristianlike exploitation of Sub-Saharan Africa by many of the Continental European Countries, esp. Belgium, during the Colonial Era.  From that time on, even the leaders of Sub-Saharan African countries have felt free to abuse their countries and their people because of the view that ""No One Cares About Africa.""",1475539200,4,517,5.675324675324675

7780741,5,B01H4FJR5W,"Yes, it's a fairy-tale sprinkled with realism and involving more serious moral issues than Johnny Weissmuller was ever faced with, but that's what made it better than its predecessors.  Skarsgard played the part with grace and convincingly, even though his English accent was a bit of a surprise and Jane's American one even more so.  I loved that Jackson's character was an historical figure who did in fact visit the Congo against King Leopold's wishes and published the deplorable conditions the Congolese were subjected to in the rubber plants there.  Not a complete parallel to this story line, but a tangent that lends interest and an endearing character to the movie.  The tale is interesting, the marriage one of love, the female lead not a ""damsel"" but a strong woman in her own right, and the CGI was believable, especially the gorillas.  The fact that Tarzan survived a physical conflict with a gorilla, not once, but apparently several times in his life based on the bite mark scars that he bore on his neck and shoulders is certainly fiction, but for me was easily overlooked.  Tarzan is a great escape with a happy ending for all except the bad guys.",1475539200,,1164,4.795

This is Tarzan, if not exactly as Edgar Rice Burroughs wrote him, then embodying the heart of that Tarzan; indomitable of spirit if not always of body, and more believable because of it. If only John Carter could have been treated so well!

Adding the historical character of George Washington Williams was an inspired twist on the typical movie treatments of Tarzan. Samuel L. Jackson's portrayal, regardless of historical accuracy, added a depth to the movie and the title character.

I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and would be interested to see what other historical events Tarzan might figure in if a sequel comes along. After all, ERB did have his character involved in the World Wars.",1475020800,,763,4.953125

Alas, I have never seen the movie, Tarzan's Fight for Life, but I made sure that I saw the movies made since then.  I was lucky enough to see Jock Mahoney in person after he made Tarzan Goes to India.  That was a thrill.  Mr. Mahoney was Tarzan after Gordon Scott gave up the role.

The Legend of Tarzan did not disappoint me.  From the opening music until the last scene, I was thrilled.  Watch Tarzan's hands.  He will show you why I mention that at about fifteen minutes into the movie.

7780823,4,B01H4FJR5W,"When I started reading the reviews of this move on RottenTomatoes, I became disheartened at how jaded movie critics have become, some even calling it garbage.  A few negative reviewers even went on to suggest that positive reviews were a plant by those who have some ""connection to the film"".

Not only were they able to capture the spirit of Tarzan, but the film directors and cast applied a great sense of realism to the character paired with real world consequences.

Alexander Skarsgrd was able to portray what I deem an accurate depiction of Tarzan: a wild man who has somehow managed to blend in to 'civil society'.  The movie gave a real enough portrayal of what life was like at the time for citizens of the Congo and their struggle against European colonialism and forced slavery.

The movie had a whole lot of heart on the part of Skarsgrd and the anthropomorphizing of the animals was just enough without becoming cartoon-like.

There were four faults I found with the story itself:

1. Christoph Waltz did not drive home the ""villain"" card.
2. Margot Robbie's character portrayal of Jane Clayton was a tad shallow
3. The vengence plot of the remote tribe (not really a major plot spoiler here) seemed too easily resolved as in an ""Okay.... I'll give up this life-long quest for vengeance because there's a worse bad guy.... and gorillas.
4. The final rescue sequence felt a bit rushed and convenient.

If you care at all about seeing a continuation of the much beloved characters that are Tarzan and Jane, however, you will not be disappointed, especially when one takes into account their ability to commune very well with otherwise insurmountable forces of nature.",1475020800,3,1678,4.822299651567945

7780844,5,B01H4FJR5W,"Finally, they did it!  After years of disappointment, they finally did justice to Burroughs Tarzan.  If you've read any of the novels, they pick up the story after John Clayton has returned home to England as the rightful Earl of Greystoke.  He's ""civilized"" and already married to Jane.  But situations pull Clayton back to the Congo and that's where the story develops.  I thought they handled the necessary flashback scenes excellent.  They didn't spend too much time with each flashback, but gave you just enough to enjoy seeing how Clayton grew up amongst the apes.  I thought Samuel J was a wasted character, possibly thrown in to give the movie some ""star"" clout, but anyone could have handled that character.  But Skarsgard was fantastic as Tarzan.  All in all an excellent adaptation and a thrilling movie.",1474848000,7,815,4.9338235294117645

Alexander Skarsgard is well cast as the mysterious superhero. Disney, and all other previous portrayals of Tarzan have presented him as a dumb brute. ""Me Tarzan, you Jane."" Tarzan was intelligent and spoke several languages. He was loyal, courageous, honorable, yet brutal and lethal when warranted. I look forward to another episode. Bravo.

7780891,5,B01H4FJR5W,"I grew up watching the classic, black and white, Johnny Weissmuller Tarzan movies on Sunday morning reruns.  I absolutely loved those movies.  I couldn't wait to see Tarzan in 2016 and to experience how it could be presented with today's movie making.  This Tarzan is absolutely wonderful!  If there are any critical reviews, it must be from people who have no appreciation for the story, the fan following, or the legend.  The backstory and adventure are presented perfectly with a perfect cast, writing, directing, and production.  The small nuances sprinkled throughout the film of the emotion and experience of Tarzan can only be picked up by fans who appreciate the original stories and the tribute this production has given them.  It was very refreshing to watch a classic story, well-portrayed with the right amount of action and drama.  I imagine the critics have become so used to modern film and the garbage presented as art, that they can't even begin to enjoy and appreciate a classic production of a timeless tale of triumph.  I absolutely loved The Legend of Tarzan, as much as the classic movies of the 1930s and 1940s.  And, I appreciate that there are still movie makers who know the quality of those stories and really know the art of movie making.  Thank you!",1474761600,,1278,4.84331797235023

It is the first movie in a long time that I didn't want to end. The romance was perfect, the dialogue excellent, supporting characters were great. Nothing was over the top or repetitive.

7780913,5,B01H4FJR5W,"As a youngster, I read pretty much everything Edgar Rice Burroughs ever wrote, beginning with the Tarzan stories. And I read them all more than once. Over the years, I've wondered if anybody would ever, ever, ever make a Tarzan story that was remotely like the original books. I had about given up, when I saw this film. Don't get me wrong, it isn't perfect. As a long time ERB fan, I expect my Tarzan to have black hair and grey eyes and a scar on his forehead (yes, a hundred years ago, he had a Harry Potter scar) and walk and talk like a civilized Edwardian gentleman. And speak fluent French. However, this film comes closer than any ever made to the original. The filmmakers adjusted the story and included embellishments aimed at a 21st-century audience. Some of these embellishments are good, but I question whether others are going to hold up over time.
By far, it's the best representation of the great apes described in the original books. Over the years, I've wondered if ERB had a clue what he was describing when he wrote about them, whether they were chimpanzees or a completely different species of apes. There is an explanation about them in the film, that they are not like ""peaceful gorillas.""
Special effects are absolutely beautiful.
Jane has passion and spunk.
And when is watching Samuel L. Jackson NOT fun?
It's about the best Tarzan you're going to get on film, at least until they let a bunch of ERB fans make a movie.",1474675200,27,1444,4.579150579150579

Meanwhile, try to understand everyone's accent, go ahead, I won't wait.  I'm almost going to change this to three stars just because it annoyed me so consistently with jump cuts to scenes where the viewer must instantly grok what's what, or spends attention trying to sleuth out who's who and where's where and why the whys, and misses dialog or important details.  Casting is just wrong.  Don't ask me for a better set of actors, but this crew just didn't fit the Tarzan known-set-of-particulars -- long established.  There must have been a dozen gratuitous moments of CGI padding-out-film-length-without-forwarding-the-plot, and it was often a jarring leap out of the film's pace.  Rush, wait and gaze, rush, wait and gaze....oh look SQUIRREL.  It was painful.  Four stars almost solely because of big budget, next gen conceptuals for the Tarzan meme, and the sheer beauty, but this is an episodic mess that forces me to watch it again just to be sure I understood the story's many side-tales.  Bah!  Me no like.  I gotta stop writing now.....every time I remember this film, it's like burping up something sour.  I'll let this sit awhile and continue this review after the 2nd viewing.

In the book, black people are daft and simple and they are no ally of Tarzan. The whites are shown as superior, Not that it matters as Tarzan is only marginally in human society.

The other problem is the story although set in the 1890s, but it's really set today and its real political correct - evil"" White people and good blacks.

On the positive side, the filming is brilliant. I loved some of the scenes. If you are going to see it make sure it's on a big screen.

The acting is good except for Samuel L. Jackson who I thought did a very poor job mainly because he is acting like a modern black when the role is set in 1890.

7780949,3,B01H4FJR5W,"The release of the mirthful The Jungle Book this spring was proof that a grand adventure could be had without superheroes, spaceships or global destruction (though with no less CGI), and, even if its straining a bit in this sinew-popping attempt to re-enfranchise a beloved character, Tarzan provides a passable return to the study of the wild boy in us all.  You just wish it had unleashed a lot more ferocity.

Its slow to build up steam, but we are mercifully spared the origin story, instead getting brief flashbacks of Tarzans infancy, his ape clan, and his first encounter with humans. Belgiums notorious King Leopold II (historically known as the butcher of the Congo) has his main henchman, Leon Rom (Christoph Waltz, sinking his teeth into another one-dimensional bad guy oddly reminiscent of the Frenchman Belloq from Raiders of the Lost Ark) amassing an army of mercenaries and harassing King Mbonga (played by Hollywoods favorite go-to warrior, Djimon Hounsou) for his lost citys stash of diamonds.  Mbonga wants revenge on Tarzan for killing his son (back before he was housebroken).  Rom sets up an elaborate ruse to entice Tarzan, who is comfortably playing Lord of the manor with Jane in England, to return to Africa.

When Tarzan does agree to return to his old stomping grounds, hes accompanied by the strong-willed Jane (Margot Robbie is entrancing as Jane, even if she clings closely to the border of damsel in distress) and an American diplomat, George Washington Williams (played by Samuel L. Jackson in full-on 90s Tarantino mode).  Jacksons character is seemingly along to uncover the rumors that Leopold has taken Congolese natives as slave labor to build his empire (and is indeed based on a historic figure), but were thinking the story needed a black man to skirt the PC police worries that this would once again be a story of a white man saving black people.  It pretty effectively skirts that problem (you know, history and all), but plunges headfirst into the feminist snakepit of being a story about a strong man continually saving the girl.  But you know what?  Its freakin Tarzan; its what he does.

Theres some compelling action and incredibly convincing CGI critters throughoutTarzan rubs noses with lions, beats down a great ape or two, andoh, right, the new Tarzan yell; Tarzans new yell is less the iconic yodel of the past and more I just passed a kidney stone, but at least it sounds more like a wild animal than a singing Canadian Mountie, so thats a plus.

David Yates, director of a Harry Potter movie or two, overcomes some clunky pacing and odd editing with a gorgeous tableau to feast on, from the grimy, washed-out tones of Greystoke Manor in England to the lush and steamy tropics of the Congo before it was nearly decimated.  As Tarzan, Alexander Skarsgard has plenty of ripped-abs moments and feels the part during the civilized scenes but is oddly restrained during most of the jungle action; they were clearly going for an actor who could portray as much sensitivity as beefcake machismo.  Fact: no less than 24 actors have played Tarzan, not counting the animated versions (big whoop says the 109 actors who have portrayed Sherlock Holmes).

Still, by adhering to Hollywoods law that Samuel L. Jackson must be in every 3rd movie, his presence is hugely distracting.  He swoons over 19th-century gun hardware, and during a crucial wildebeest stampede, I fully expected him to shout how many mother*^$%ing wildebeests are on this mother*$^%ing plain?

KID FACTOR:  Mostly clean action-adventure with one scene of intense body-sniffing (try that on your next first date) and some CGI pixels are killed.
CLICHES: Boy saves girl; girl gets baby.
SURPRISES:  Tarzan doesnt call his son boy.",1472515200,13,3738,4.9536
7780950,5,B01H4FJR5W,"I had seen the previews and wanted to see this (um, Alexander Skarsgard half nekkid?  Yes please) - but when the reviews came out...oy.  However, on a recent crazy hot afternoon I decided sitting in an air conditioned theater with reclining seats and a trough of popcorn hanging from my neck while watching a super hot guy swinging from the trees sounded pretty fantastic - so off I went, despite what the critics said.

Well, the critics are morons.  Maybe I'm not smart enough.  Maybe I don't understand high art.  Maybe I don't look for soul changing deep meanings in my movies or ask for them all to change the world.  But I LOVED this movie.  I love the characters (I have a girl crush on Margot Robbie now) - Jane is spunky but smart, Tarzan is hot and shirtless, and the cinematography was incredible.  Visually, this movie was fantastic - other than Tarzan's abs - the lushness and romance of the Congo...wow.  But what do you expect from the guy who helmed the good Harry Potter movies?  Not even Samuel L. Jackson made me want to punch myself in the face.  His character was cliche - but good for some laughs to break up the action.

Look - if you want a fun, well acted, beautifully filmed movie that's full of action, fun, humor, and pretty people - this would be just what you're looking for.  The touch of romance between the married Tarzan and Jane is just enough to be sweet, but not enough to be sappy and turn men off.  My parents (who are in their sixties) both loved the movie as well - they both found the movie fun, engaging, and entertaining.",1472515200,6,1565,4.423076923076923
7780951,4,B01H4FJR5W,"Some of the online photo stills make The Legend of Tarzan look pretty hokey, so I was a little hesitant about paying to sit through it in the theater. Having now taken the chance, I can happily say that this film is definitely not another feeble disappointment like 1984s Greystoke. Though purists may dislike the fact that its not directly based on any one of Burroughss novels, there is still basic loyalty to his Tarzan mythos, and the way it incorporates some true historyKing Leopolds exploitation of the Congo Free State, poaching of its game, and horrible enslavement of its natives for profitadds a great deal of relevance for a modern audience.

While its obviously intended largely as plain old entertainment, The Legend of Tarzan meshes humor and heartbreak very well, and the many action sequences are riveting without going too far in asking us to suspend disbelief. No, it doesnt all make perfect sense, but perfect sense can hardly be expected of a fantasy of this kind. The visuals and animation are quite arresting; most of the animals look real, the one glaring exception being the Mangani apes. Then again, this film reminds us that the Manganis are NOT gorillas or chimps. As in Burroughs, they are a separate legendary species--a missing link of some kind, perhaps? The script is generally decent even though many of the lines sound more 21st than 19th century. Good acting by all the major players, but those who play the native Africans steal the show.

Some budget constraints are evident, and its an ambitious storyline to pack into less than two hours: The whole pace of the film is a bit hurried. Regardless, anyone whos interested in seeing another Tarzan film in the first place should not be disappointed and may really love ""The Legend of Tarzan.""",1472515200,3,1778,4.845394736842105

I was happy when Tarzan saved Jane. During the movie I dropped a gummy bear that smelled like farts. It smelled like that because I farted on it.,1472169600,5,305,4.186440677966102
7780953,5,B01H4FJR5W,"I've been profoundly affected by the 2016 movie ""Legend of Tarzan"" starring Alexander Skaarsgard and Margot Robbie. When it first arrived in theaters I had no urgent desire to see it, merely a passing interest, something I apparently had in common with the rest of the world, as the film found itself in the budget or ""dollar"" theater shortly after its release.

My father, a longtime fan of Tarzan as it was one of the adventure stories available to him as a child, mentioned his enthusiasm for it, and I thought it would be fun to go together, along with Jake, my 11 year old.  Three generations of men sat side by side (my mother came along too, just to make sure the actor playing Tarzan has performed the proper physical preparation to play such a role) and the movie began.

First off, this is more of a sequel than a standalone movie. It tells the story of John Clayton (Tarzan) now living in England at his family mansion, Greystoke, with his lovely (and perhaps a little bored) wife Jane. From the beginning the two express an undying affection for each other.  This is not the typical passionate, fiery physical lust that Hollywood filmmakers typically depict, but you can sense a deep emotional dedication in each interaction and connection.  This persists throughout the movie and in my opinion, is one of its strongest themes.  Clayton is reluctant to return to Africa but agrees to do so after learning that slavery may be ensnaring the people he loves. Jane determines to accompany him, whether he likes it or not, and as the two arrive in the country it is clear they belong.  The people, animals, and land itself seems to as much a part of them as they are of it.  Regular flashbacks depict Tarzan's origin, faithful to any story you might have seen before, and after a short trek across a vast, beatiful ocean of African grass, Tarzan and Jane find themselves in the village where Jane claims to have ""grown up.""  They are instantly greeted with the warmest affection, and herein comes the second theme which I enjoyed so much: The tribal people are healthy and optimistic, with genuine smiles splayed across their dark faces that cannot seem to be erased, even with adversity. They are not the thin, malnourished people so often depicted in films, but strong, proud, and beautiful.  They act as I wish we all would act, confident and positive, undaunted by misfortune because of a deep abiding knowledge of their place in the ""circle of life."" There's no fear of death, nor do they give their lives uselessly, but throughout the movie they recognize their roles in the conflict and play their parts without complaint.  Each battle finds them standing up for what is right with a smile on their face and a positive expectation of the outcome.  Sidney Ralitiseole especially personifies this amazing optimism, with a smile so infectious and persistent that I find myself smiling back even as I write this.

Skaarsgard is reserved, patient and in control of his emotions at all times. He sacrifices himself for others freely, and uses his influence and strength to right the injustices he sees and save the woman he loves. His devotion to her is never questioned, and her faith in him is just as solid. They are not desperate, they are confident, and as challenges come they never falter in their dedication to each other.  It's the kind of trust and relationship we all should strive for.

The cinematography is beautifully shot, and the soundtrack is the icing on an already delicious cake. My favorite tracks are ""Opar"" ""Togetherness"" ""Campfire"" and ""Elephants in the night"" but the entire soundtrack is a great way to relive the movie in your mind.

All in all the Legend of Tarzan earns itself a place in my top movies, and I crave the opportunity to see it again, whether in the theater or in my own home. It holds the same values I do, optimism, an understanding of one's place in the ""grander scheme"" and a dedication to those you love.  It makes me want to be a better person, something I think we all could use a little more of.  Go see it, I'd be curious to see if you share my opinion.",1471996800,2,4113,4.641873278236915

The film took bits and pieces from various Edgar Rice Burroughs stories, twisted them together, and created a plot that was just poorly thought out.  The acting was okay, the character development was more blatant than subtle, and the character that followed along after Tarzan was just plain pathetic. This was one of those movies those strength was its CGI. Without it, you're left with a weak, predictable storyline.

I anticipated this would be a huge departure from the original stories as most movies are, but even so I was disappointed.

7780958,5,B01H4FJR5W,"The Legend of Tarzan is the Best Version of Tarzan Ever

Have you ever wondered why there are so many versions of Tarzan? I read the original Edgar Rice Burroughs book a decade ago because I wanted to know what the real version was. The book was a Penny Dreadful that was fun as heck, silly as all get out, and pretty skewed from reality.

This new version of Tarzan not only tries to make it as realistic as it can be in the circumstances (it is a super hero jungle guy),  it also incorporates history of the time (turn of the 19th Century) by having the villains be the Belgians in the Congo. The Legend of Tarzan takes the legend and makes it a better story.

The stars of the movie are all fantastic in their roles. Alexander Skarsgard is beyond buff, beautiful and an amazing Tarzan. Margot Robbie is sweet and tough as nails as Jane. Samuel L. Jackson is always good but this part would be less without him. Christoph Waltz was very villainy and believable.

Thank you to all the people who made this movie, for thinking we needed yet another Tarzan. Now I want a sequel.",1471132800,15,1077,4.338308457711443
7780959,4,B01H4FJR5W,"Released in 2016 and directed by David Yates, The Legend of Tarzan stars Alexander Skarsgrda as John Clayton (Tarzan), Margot Robbie as Jane and Samuel L. Jackson as Tarzans American friend. The events take place a decade after Tarzan & Jane leave Africa for England with brief flashbacks to the ape mans origins. Christoph Waltz co-stars as the villain, Rom, who enslaves blacks in the Congo to mine the diamonds of Opar. Tarzan, Jane and Willliams (Jackson) aim to set things aright.

Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes (1984) was the best modern Tarzan movie, and one of my favorites despite a somewhat lethargic second half (and an irritating overuse of the Ooo, ooo, oooape vocalization, which this movie thankfully only does once). Unfortunately, they dropped the ball with the sequel, 1998s Tarzan and the Lost City with Casper Van Dien in the title role, as it was just half-baked, a quickly-thrown-together sequel to presumably steal some of the thunder of Disneys animated version that was coming out the next year.

The Legend of Tarzan comes across as the true sequel to Greystoke, albeit with an altogether different cast and understandably so, seeing as how its 32 years later. The portrayal of the lost city of Opar is different from the books. Theres no hot High Priestess La (a blond white female) or ape-like denizens. The Oparians in the movie are just an intimidating black tribe covered with white body paint, but this is no big letdown because changes are to be expected when transferring to a different medium and, besides, Opar doesnt play that big of a role, at least not the city itself.

In any case, I found this to be a solid Tarzan movie with a serious adult tone mixing drama, jungle adventure and unbelievable action. I was thankful for the thoughtful lulls in the story, which shed insights on the characters or conveyed the wonders of nature, like when Tarzan communes with an elephant at night or when Williams honestly confesses about his past mistakes as a youth where he feels hes not so different from the odious Rom. Moreover, Margot expertly brings Jane to life and is easily one of the better Janes in the movies. The CGI animals are great, especially the powerhouse apes.

The film runs 110 minutes and was shot, believe it or not, in England with aerial shots done in Gabon (West of the Congo).

7780966,3,B01H4FJR5W,"Somewhere along the way studios got the notion in their heads that audiences are clamoring for more Edgar Rice Burroughs. Disney missed badly with John Carter, a bloated sci-fi flop that made Taylor Kitch bounding through space surprisingly dull. Warner Bros. has been developing The Legend of Tarzan for years in hopes that the classic jungle hero could be revived for today's superhero-obsessed moviegoer. And maybe therein lies the problem, as the film seems stuck between the pull of tradition and the need to resemble a super-powered comic book character.

As it stands, The Legend of Tarzan is a perfectly serviceable big budget yarn, made to look sufficiently blockbustery by veteran Harry Potter director David Yates and The Golden Compass cinematographer Henry Braham. There should also be special acknowledgement given to Alexander Skarsgard's abs, which seem to be glistening and rippling whether he's swinging through the trees or standing idle. What the film doesn't do is strike a clear direction for the character. Is this a re-examination of the 19th-century colonialist politics of Burroughs' novels? That's there, but hardly much of a commitment to it. So then what's the purpose for this movie's existence? It seems that screenwriters Adam Cozad and Craig Brewer (of Hustle & Flow fame, and once eyed to direct this, which would have been very interesting) have settled on simply making a summer action movie. Period. Nothing wrong with that, but it's disappointing given the potential of the source material.

For instance, there's real drama in the tale of John Clayton (Skarsgard), the Earl of Greystoke who has forsaken his jungle past as Tarzan for a more civilized life with his beautiful wife, Jane (Margot Robbie). The story rightfully assumes we already know who the heck Tarzan is; he's the guy not named Mowgli who was raised by jungle animals from childhood. He has no desire to return to his home in the Congo, ""It's hot"", he says when requested to go back to Africa on a British diplomatic mission. However he's convinced by Col. George Washington Williams, a real-life African-American scholar, Civil War veteran, and adventurer played by Samuel L. Jackson in all his Jackson-ness. Williams tells him to forget the diplomatic crap and go because of devious machinations by Belgian King Leopold, who has sent envoy Leon Rom (Christoph Waltz) to enslave the natives with the aid of mercenaries. Rom strikes a deal with tribal chief Chief Mbonga (Djimon Hounsou) who seeks vengeance on Tarzan for a past violent encounter.

There are interesting fact-based details woven in and given a fictional, often cartoonish spin, which can be frustrating.  Williams was a real guy who actually did expose Belgium's brutal and inhumane treatment of Congo natives. He was a true hero and a gentleman. Here he's mostly comic relief, struggling to keep up with Tarzan's energetic vine-swinging or having awkward encounters with the natives. The humor he adds is both a blessing a curse for the self-serious film. Rom was far more terrifying in reality than the dainty, mustache-twirling heel Waltz portrays him as. As the head of Belgium's ""Force Publique"" he was known to carry around the severed heads of Africans. In the film he has a necklace which he occasionally uses as a weapon. Eh.  It's hard to take Waltz seriously in these villain roles at this point because they are all variations of the same thing.

As the epitome of ""white savior complex"" Tarzan is an inherently difficult character to make work, especially right now with diversity such a major issue going around Hollywood. That makes his frequent scenes alongside the Congo natives a little awkward visually; here's this perfectly dolled-up white couple coming to save the thousands of African warriors who apparently don't know how to fight back. Good thing Tarzan and Jane are here to be held up (literally in some cases) as  It wouldn't be that much of an issue if saving the African people was Tarzan's priority but it's quickly shunted aside in favor of a rescue mission to save Jane. And once that happens it's really the only thing that matters. ""He's Tarzan, you're Jane. He'll come"", Rom says. And of course he's right. Speaking of which, Jane poses a problem as well. Granted, Robbie is perfectly fierce and strong as Jane, but she's every bit the damsel in distress the film attempts, pointedly, to convince us she's not.

""I need you to scream for me"", Rom says.

""Like a damsel? is her reply.

Well, yeah. Like a damsel. When the entire movie is about rescuing you, that's what you are.

As for Tarzan himself, Skarsgard is excellent in the role. Obviously from a physical standpoint the former True Blood star is a nearly perfect choice. He's tall, lean, muscular, and he captures Tarzan's animal ferocity when challenged, but also his gentle side. When in combat during the film's impressive action scenes, like one in which he battles his ape brother in a WWE-style smackdown, Skarsgard appears to be most comfortable. That fight, along with his showdown with Mbonga, teases a deeper understanding of Tarzan that the film sadly never follows up on, as he's forced to show humility and acceptance of another's superiority. It's the conflict between his animal urges and human qualities that make Tarzan interesting and The Legend of Tarzan doesn't go far enough in exploring that aspect. But we do see plenty of his powers, such as incredible speed, strength to go toe-to-paw with any creature, and the ability to communicate with the animals. He's like Aquaman's long-lost kin we never knew about.

Despite a few curious camera shots, such as a sudden fondness for Michael Bay-style 360 rotations, Yates shows the same grasp for storytelling that took the Harry Potter franchise to another level. He has to contend with CGI that looks terrific in some cases but gets awfully dicey the more animals fill up the screen, and that's quite often. The finale has about a thousand lions, gazelles, crocodiles, and other creatures waging war against those pesky human enslavers. It's an impressive spectacle, for sure, but also serves to highlight The Legend of Tarzan's inability, or unwillingness, to be more than just a standard adventure film rather than a fresh take on the character.",1470182400,10,6284,5.0143815915628

There are a lot of fun adventures through the jungle.  Fights with gorillas.  Chases through the tree tops.  Swinging through the jungle like Spider Man.  Amazing hand-to-hand brawls (with humans).  Flashbacks to catch you up on Tarzan's origins.  A really weird Aquaman-type moment in the end, where a bunch of animals team up like National Geographic X-Men.  And a lot of comic relief involving Sam Jackson.  Jackson killed it in this movie, and he is a lot of fun to watch.

Overall, this movie is a quick homage to a beloved literary character.  It takes a darker view on Tarzan that really works well.  WATCH IT.  Yes, even BUY IT.  It's worth watching again for its fun action scenes.",1470096000,4,1128,4.611111111111111
7780968,5,B01H4FJR5W,"Big fan of Alexander Skarsgrd and it is great to see him in a major mainstream movie role. Also a big fan of Tarzan. All that being said that my fanboy opinion is already tainted, I don't understand the hate for this film when it comes to critics and the ""great white savior"", hate (coming from white critics). Labeling the film as racist. Do you honestly believe so many African American actors would be in this movie if it were racist? Look we all know the story of Tarzan and for anyone to dislike it for not being anything new I really have to question their mindset.

You can turn anything into being racist. You literally can and you can do it for any race. This movie isn't trying to create a political movement or meant to be taken seriously. Tarzan was created over 100 years ago and we all know he is a white guy who in raised in the jungle. What were they supposed to do? Turn him into a Zulu warrior? Turn it into an authentic documentary of violence in Africa? Portray everything as real as possible even though this is a fantasy?

Throwing aside the, ""This isn't anything new."" and ""It's very racist"" complaints. This is a very entertaining movie with a lot of rewatch value. Alexander is great in the role of Tarzan and Sam Jackson is amazing as well. The entire cast is good. The story is very cool and I really enjoyed how they showed Tarzan in regular society adjusting to it. Rather than focusing completely on his origin story. I have heard this movie isn't fun, and the pacing is horrible but I didn't find this movie to struggle with either. For what this movie is, a summer blockbuster, filled with action and adventure I think it is amazing. Can't wait for it to come out on Blu Ray.",1469836800,2,1707,4.381703470031546

This film focuses on the civilized Tarzan going back to the jungle to stop the king of Belgium enslaving blacks in the Congo.

7780974,4,B01H4FJR5W,"This is the best realized Tarzan movie ever, but mainly due to today's better digital effects and good acting crew.
Being a HUGE Tarzan fan from the 60's, having actually read all of Edgar rice Burroughs novels, I have to say that, despite the few problems in this latest Tarzan flick, a sequel with more action, having Tarzan don his loincloth and iconic hunting knife, spear and bow and quiver of arrows, and having Tarzan truly excel in combat, whether it be man OR ape, then I would wager a sequel with THAT in place will create a bigger, better blockbuster adventure film that even critics would embrace. When you have Legend in the title, then truly create a legendary Tarzan o screen. Please not only the Tarzan fans, but non-fans even expect their Tarzan to fully fill the Legendary bill.

But, despite my misgivings, this movie is a HUGE step in the right direction. It IS bold. It has some stunning scenes. Great ensemble cast, although some the screen writers and or director could have challenged more. But, all in all, this is a very good film that could have quite easily been Avatar huge in popularity and box office gold if they would have truly unleashed the beast within the ape-man.

A lot of fans and critics spoke of being bored through the first 1/3 film, due to it beginning with a now civilized Tarzan, who shuns that name and has seemingly embraced his Lord Greystoke of London birthright.

OK, that's cool. I can accept that, because that is somewhat true to the book sources. But what screenwriters and director forgot here, was how to showcase the hidden Wildman within.  Filmmakers forget audiences need fast-pacing to grip them. Why not woo today's audiences with showcasing battling the inner beast in London? Why not devise a couple of ways to excite and show the moviegoers what they want, i.e., a Tarzan eating raw red meat, growling, catching himself while at dinner with London's finest aristocracy? Or climb buildings like an ape to capture a robber? Something akin to these things would have quickly, and more succinctly shown the jungle animal within Tarzan, fighting to get out while in civilization.

I truly believe critics and more broad acceptance would have been accorded to this film if, halfway three the movie, when Jane gets kidnapped while her husband is left being strangled, that if John Clayton would have entered Janes' father's cabin, then emerged as the loincloth wearing Tarzan, replete with iconic hunting knife and war spear, fans and audiences in general, would have been more pleased and excited. THIS would have been the full, clear and concise point in the film where John Clayton, Lord Greystoke, truly digests himself of his civilised persona, and go forth as the returning legendary Tarzan from there on.
Even Jane never called him Tarzan throughout the film. This was wrong. She should have called him as his given jungle title when he rescued her. THIS would have been more satisfying for critics and audiences, trust me!

Overall, this is a very good film, but a sequel could quite easily surpass this rejuvenation of the oldest classic and iconic hero with ratcheting up the action, and Tarzan communing with his mangani apes more solidly than he did in this latest film. Greystoke film of the early 80's did this better, and this film had a chance to showcase the mangani apes with today's CGI to blow away that older film. Which it does....But could you imagine what the first half of that old Greystoke movie could now look like with a bigger and better Tarzan, i.e. Alexander Scarsgard, and bigger and better CGE apes that this latest Tarzan film showed?

Please see this film, just so they can fix the little tidbits they got wrong, and a fully realized Tarzan film can FINALLY grace our movie screens. C'mon, filmmakers! Don't hold back next time. Unleash the full inner beast that we AND the critics expected to get. We are waiting...",1468886400,7,3911,4.785185185185185
7780975,4,B01H4FJR5W,"Director: David Yates

Screenwriters: Adam Cozad, Craig Brewer

Cast: Alexander Skarsgrd, Christoph Waltz, Samuel L. Jackson, and Margot Robbie

Ahhhh AhAhAhAhAhAh Ahhhhhhhh! Tarzan is swinging back into theaters for like the 60th time in the last 100 years.  In the scheme of things with James Bond and superheroes, thats not such a frequent appearance! Still, the problem with most Tarzan appearances is that they are all basically a retelling of Edgar Rice Burroughs first Tarzan novel:  Parents are marooned, child is orphaned, child is raised by gorillas, scientist discovers Tarzan, Tarzan rescues scientists daughter, and they fall in love. So is David Yatess new film, The Legend of Tarzan a different story? The answer is yesand no.

In this film, we are introduced to an already grown Tarzan (Alexander Skarsgrd). Home in England during the mid 19th century, famous world-round, and married to his love, Jane (Margot Robbie).  Tarzan (AKA John Clayton) has adjusted to life as an heir to his parents fortune and lives a most civilized existence, far removed from the one he knew in the jungle. When he is summoned by the Prime Minister (Jim Broadbent) to sit in on a matter regarding King Leopolds hold of a mining encampment in the African Congo, Tarzan is encouraged to use his celebrity and act as an ambassador. The Prime Ministers hopes are that by traveling to the site, Claytons  presence will calm some rumors circling around Leopolds interests and practices in the Congo.  American Historian George Washington Williams (Samuel L. Jackson) volunteers to accompany Clayton and Jane, but his true intention is to investigate his theory that indigenous Africans are being used as slaves to mine the Congo.  When that theory pans out, Williams easily persuades Clayton to join him in exposing Leopolds private slave state, but they are thwarted by L&eacute;on Rom (Christoph Waltz), a Belgian soldier sent by King Leopold to act as administrator of one of the major stations in the Congo.  Rom is devious and maniacal, and when he captures Jane, Tarzan will stop at nothing to get her back and bring Rom down.

So like I said, is this films narrative a different story than were used to? Yes, we are not dragged through a 60-minute plotline about a boy growing up as an ape man.  But no, we are not treading much new ground as Tarzan still spends most of the movie trying to rescue Jane. Fortunately, director David Yates tips the scales in favor of freshness as the story unfolds.  The filmmaking is vibrant, alive, and exciting. Yates takes that smooth, Peter Jacksony style he honed with his four Harry Potter films and transfers it beautifully to The Legend of Tarzan.  The visuals are sweeping and the film benefits tremendously from Yatess touch.

The actors are equally enjoyable. Margot Robbie gives Jane real dimension; she even has a line where she mocks even the idea of being a damsel in distress. Skarsgrd does well as the stoic Tarzan.  He looks the part and shows that he may be able to carry a big-budget action film.  However, as is the case in many films, the supporting cast is where Legend of Tarzan shines.  Waltz and Jackson are together again for the first time since Django Unchained.  This time, however, the roles are reversed and Waltz is the unabashed, racist tyrant, while Jackson gets to play the charismatic hero!  Mostly though, Jackson steals the show, and if you're looking for that one extra reason to persuade you go see this film, Jackson firing off countless rounds from a machine gun turret is that reason.

The Legend of Tarzan is fun, summer blockbuster fare, and its better than the average film in that category. It clips along at a nice pace, and it doesnt pander or feel false or ironic.  If you're looking for something to see this summer that is (mostly) not animated, The Legend of Tarzan is a worthy option. B

Ten years after leaving the jungle, Tarzan and Jane must return to save Africa from Christoph Waltz, who wants diamonds, or slaves, or colonialism, or something.

Just awful. Alexander Skarsgrds Tarzan is entirely without charm and personality. Margot Robbie makes desperate attempts to compensate by being as sassy and vivacious as she possibly can, which is even worse. She aint your grandmas Jane! Am I right, ladies? Christoph Waltz tries vaguely as a pantomime villain in white linen and is the best thing in it with the exception of a CGI baby elephant.

7780982,5,B01H4FJR5W,"There's a moment in David Yates' excellent and emotionally resonant Legend of Tarzan when George Washington Williams', played by Samuel L. Jackson, goads civilized Tarzan, played by Alexander Skarsgard, just a little too much.  Alexander Skarsgard's Tarzan erupts instantly and spectacularly with a combination of physical force and gut-chilling animal sounds and pins the American to a wall,  then growls out the words:  ""They have my wife, and their families.""  In this single small moment,  Yates and Skarsgard put on display Tarzan's utter commitment to the woman he loves while at the same time same evoking the internal contradiction of a man who in adulthood could pass among society as a aristocratic Englishman, but whose feral upbringing has left him with a volatile beast within that can overwhelm the civilized trappings in an instant.  Unlike the filmmakers who have come before him, Yates effectively captures this duality - and in so doing delivers a film that is fresh and appealing to modern sensibilities, yet is faithful to the character of the books in ways that Hollywood has never attempted before. The result is pure pulp poetry with a beating heart.  Edgar Rice Burroughs would approve of it, and 21st century audiences will, if they can be lured into theaters to see it, be intrigued and satisfied by it.

Legend of Tarzan begins eight years after Tarzan and Jane (a luminous and effective Margot Robbie) have left Africa to undertake a gentrified life in London, where Tarzan has claimed his birthright of John Clayton III, Lord Greystoke.  He is drawn back to Africa at the behest of George Washington Williams (Samuel L. Jackson), a black American journalist who is based on the historical figure who led the exposure of the crimes of King Leopold II of Belgium.  Williams recruits him to assist in Williams' quest to investigate the suspected crimes of King Leopold.  Accompanied by Jane, the two men return to Africa where Leon Rom (Christoph Waltz) has laid a trap for Tarzan that, if successful, will result in Rom delivering Tarzan to Chief Mbonga (Djimon Hounsou), who seeks to deliver vengeance to Tarzan for killing Mbonga's son many years earlier.  Mayhem and adventure ensues.

When Edgar Rice Burroughs was firing on all cylinders, his pulpy, emotionally infused adventure novels were able to strike a mythic vein that caused him to become the J.K. Rowlings of his day - the first global superstar pop culture author, translated into 57 languages, his books and characters embedded in cultures from Russia to Turkey and Japan.  At the time of his death in 1950 he was the best known author on the planet with his works selling more than the combined sales of his contemporaries Hemingway, Faulkner, and Joyce. Hollywood tried more than fifty times and although the movies obviously met with success -- not one of them ever captured what the grand old pulp master had created on the page.  Yates is the first to do it; his Legend of Tarzan stands head and shoulders above the Tarzan movies that came before it--and regardless of how it fares in the crowded summer theatrical marketplace, it is assured of a place in cinema history as the Tarzan movie that captured the heart and spirit of Burroughs' creation.

It remains to be seen how 2016 audiences react. Has Tarzan's time on the world stage passed, or is there indeed something mythic and archetypal that can cause the character to come alive in the modern imaginations?  Yates and his team have given it an extraordinary ""best shot"" and have created something of heart, beauty, and lasting value.  The editing of the film by Mark Day is taut and streamlined --not a moment is wasted and the story drives forward with energy and commitment; Henry Braham's cinematography is cool and brooding in London, and lush and earthy in Africa; the production design by Stuart Craig is grand and evocative; and the music by Rupert Gregson Williams is both emotional and pulse-quickening.  Special mention goes to screenwriters Adam Cozad and Craig Brewer who updated the Burroughs material, giving it unexpected historical gravitas, while excavating from the pages of the early Tarzan books the core values that made them unique.  And the CGI wizardry  is seamless, photorealistic, and effective on all levels.

7780994,4,B01H4FJR5W,"Ask anyone who knows me and they'll tell you that I love superheroes and the genre around it. But truth be told, many of them owe their existence to the ""average"" pulp heroes of old, such as The Shadow or The Phantom. But the one that's stood the test of time; the one that everyone and their mother knows, is Tarzan. And over the decades, there's been countless versions of the King of the Apes, from the infamous Johnny Weissmuller portrayal, to, of all things, a Disney animated musical. And even though I'm far from a super fan of the character, I enjoy the stories and films enough that I was excited to see this new movie, and was curious of what (if any) new things they'd bring to the table.

I came away pleasantly surprised. This film manages to take an old concept and breathe some new life into it, and it's a shame the film isn't doing better at the box office, for this movie is a great adventure, both for the casual and hard core Tarzan fan.

As a result of the Berlin Conference, the Congo has been divided up between Belgium and the United Kingdom. The Belgian government is on the verge of bankruptcy, having gone into heavy debt to build a national railroad and other infrastructure. In response, King Leopold II of Belgium decides to extract the Congo's rich mineral deposits, sending his envoy Lon Rom to secure the fabled diamonds of Opar. A tribal leader, Chief Mbonga, offers Rom the diamonds in exchange for Tarzan-- the man who killed his son.  Back in England, an aristocrat named John Clayton is invited by King Leopold to visit Boma and report on the development of the Congo. An American envoy, George Washington Williams, urges John to go, as he knows that John, in reality, is the legendary Tarzan, who, after being orphaned in the African jungles, was raised by apes. Williams also suspects that the Belgians are enslaving the Congolese population, and wants to prove his suspicions. With his wife, Jane, in tow, John returns to his jungle home, and must use all his skills and instincts to free the Congolese people and stop Leon Rom before the Congo is destroyed.

From the above synopsis, one can see right away that for those of you who are used to the loincloth-wearing, caveman-speaking, jungle wild man, you're in for a big surprise. Following much more closely to the books, Tarzan, in this version, has long since adapted to human civilization, and at first, is reluctant to return to the jungle, mainly out of wanting to protect Jane. But the more he helps out his old friends in the Congo, the more he begins to realize where his heart and home truly belongs--amazing everyone with his gift of communicating with animals. And thankfully, we're not saddled with sitting through the old origin story pretty much anyone knows. Rather, it's given to us in bits and pieces via word of mouth and flashbacks, like a campfire story being told (hence the ""legend of"" in the film title). After so many movies with superhuman heroes, it's great to go back to basics, and have an ""average"" guy as the lead--someone who can and DOES get seriously injured, and, while having an unusual talent, it's presented in such a way that it's not completely unbelievable.

As for the rest of the characters, they're all likeable and/or interesting. Jane, especially, is portrayed as a very brave and can-do woman who can take care of herself--engineering her own escape from her captors at one point. And while she does need saving at certain points, she's far from a weeping and scared damsel in distress. Williams serves as the voice of the audience; learning that there's far more to Tarzan than the pulp comics based off him turned out to be. (He's also the primary comic relief and gets some of the best lines, hands down.) Even the slimy Leon Rom, for all his wickedness, gets a few funny moments, mainly for how out of place he is in the jungle, and his comeuppance in the end is nothing short of satisfying.

So for those of you who want to see a good old fashioned adventure story, or for long time fans of Tarzan who are interested to see a new take on the character, while paying tribute to everything that made him great, then definitely give this film a shot. You won't be disappointed.",1467849600,4,4220,4.612516644474034
7780995,4,B01H4FJR5W,"Theatrical review. Possible spoiler. Being a fan of all those old Johnny Weissmuller Tarzan movies from the 30s, I was looking forward to seeing this new take helmed by Harry Potter director, David Yates. Rather than pick up as to how this man from the jungle became Tarzan, the film opens with a grown-up Tarz, now known as Lord John Clayton (Alexander Skarsgard, The Diary of a Teenage Girl) of England. He is being lured into returning to the Congo, now controlled by Belgium, to help them navigate the territory. What they don't know is that King Leopolds Belgium was near bankruptcy. The Congo was known for having vast sources of diamonds, not to mention elephant ivory.

Leopold sends a governor wannabee named Leon Rom (Christoph Waltz) to take control of the country and get access to the precious stones. Rom encounters a local tribal chief named Mbonga (Djimon Hounsou, Guardians of the Galaxy) who agrees to provide access to the diamonds in return for Tarzan, who had killed his son years earlier. Clayton now married to an American, the former Jane Porter (Margot Robbie, Whiskey Tango Foxtrot), reluctantly agrees to bring her along. After all they met in Africa in an old fashion Me Tarzan, you Jane blast from the past. In fact, just to keep us up-to-date, Tarzans recollections once in country, allow us to see how he was discovered and raised by apes and grew to be the hunky man he is today. And while we can debate how accurate Skarsgards impassive take on the King of the Jungle or Lord Clayton for that matter, is, he certainly looks the role.

An emissary from Americas President Benjamin Harrison impressively named George Washington Williams (Samuel L. Jackson, who worked with Waltz in Django Unchained) comes along because he suspects that old King Leopold has evil intent, including enslaving the natives. There is some irony in Harrisons record. While history suggest he was sympathetic to restoring full rights to Americas former slaves, he seem to have no issue with their continued obliteration of Native Americans. Lesson over. It would seem that Jacksons role was to introduce a comedic element, so much lacking in the film. As it is, I think the filmmakers forgot to tell Jackson.

Although the movie is varying amounts of green screen, CGI and motion capture, it looks pretty good most of the time. The animals in particular, are impressive. Except for some aerial shots, the movie was made in various locations within the U. K. Sometimes, thats evident. Once Tarz and Jane get to Africa, the pace picks up and concludes with a rousing final act. Recommended.",1467763200,5,2596,4.868778280542986

7780997,5,B01H4FJR5W,"As other reviewers have stated, the critics are wrong about this movie.....I absolutely loved it!!!  I have been a Tarzan fan for decades.  Having been a True Blood addict and seeing Alexander Skarsgard as the vampire Eric (which he played beautifully), I was having a bit of a problem wrapping my head around him playing Tarzan, but he was magnificent as Tarzan.  I was so glad that they did not try to remake something that had already been done as far as storyline/plot.  Nothing was overplayed and the effects were awesome!!  I can't wait for Blu Ray to be released.",1467763200,13,570,4.66
7780998,5,B01H4FJR5W,"I ventured out to the movies on July 4th to see The Legend of Tarzan, having already been vastly disappointed by another Independence Day blockbuster.  Although I was not really in the mood for an action film, I was surprised to find that I liked The Legend of Tarzan very much.

I was also pleasantly surprised because I am not one to enjoy movies about gorilla-men swinging around on vines and exercising their vocal muscles.  I confess that I cant remember the last time I actually enjoyed a Tarzan movie, possibly back in the 1960s when I was a boy.  In any event, I went to see The Legend of Tarzan fully expecting to hate it.  Boy was I wrong.

The plot was more than engaging enough to keep my interest throughout.  The special effects were dazzling.  The acting was quite good and the primary actors were all most enjoyable.  Chief among these were Margo Robbie as Jane, who is the gutsiest, most feisty Jane I can ever recall seeing.  Alexander Skarsgard as John Clayton / Tarzan was restrained and yet powerful at the same time.  In a nice switch, Samuel L. Jackson gets to play a good guy and Christoph Waltz was appropriately menacing as the bad guy.  All told, there wasn't a dull moment in the whole film and I found myself cheering for the outcome during the climax.  The Legend of Tarzan is definitely a lot better than the critics would have you believe.  In fact, I was so glad I saw it that I pre-ordered the Blu-Ray immediately.  Dont miss this one -- definitely recommended.",1467763200,23,1495,4.5055762081784385
7780999,5,B01H4FJR5W,"I fondly remember the Tarzan novels by Edgar Rice Burroughs as the books that got me interested in reading for the first time., They ignited my imagination  and for the first time I was able to suspend my sense of disbelief, and instead of anallyzing  it and just accepted it for what it was, a simple fantasy that fired my  imagination. Simple is a valid description, but not a criticism. Burroughs wasn't a great writer, but he was a very good storyteller.
 Yes, I was a fan of the Tarzan stories, still am. I have read them a number of times, but the movies are a different matter. They were not Burrough's  Tarzan. The plot lines and stories were repetitive. They were just silly in comparison.  There was no Cheetah, and no chimpanzees. Tarzan grew up among the Great Apes, a fictional breed that was more similar to a gorilla than a chimpanzee.
 Also, there was no adopted son they called Boy.  During the 1930's when the Weismueller Tarzan movies were started, Tarzan and Jane were not married so they couldn't have a child without being married, so the character of Boy was  realized..
 Burroughs' Tarzan and Jane did have a child of their own, a boy that they called Korak.
  Only Hugh Hudson in his 1984 film ""Greystoke, the Legend of Tarzan of the Apes"" actually showed us a Tarzan closer than any other film about Tarzan.  That is until they released ""The Legend of Tarzan""  Now, THIS is a Tarzan movie.  All of the criticism I've read leaves me incredulous. I have been waiting for a large scale Tarzan done using the technology there is now.  They've done it, they showed Tarzan like he's never been shown before: like he was written. The African tribesman were not stereotypes like in most of the older films.
 I sat in awe of  the sight Tarzan actually swinging from vine to vine and running along large branches over head.  This was a real treat for someone who has enjoyed the books for so many years. And now, to have them come to life as they do in ""The Legend of Tarzan"", its like completing an item on my bucket list.. From the figures I've seen, the moviegoers who have seen the movie, give it a higher rating  by about 40 points.
Movies have gotten more and more expensive and we have less to spare for entertainment, so the critic has a function to perform, but we for the most part don't know what they base their opinions on, or if they have the credentials to make that decision for us. I don;'t know if there is one, but there should be a critic directory that tells what their credentials and criteria are.

My take on the Legend of Tarzan, though I am a bit biased, is an honest one. For example I've been a fan of Green Lantern since I was a boy' yet when it came out,,as long as I had been looking forward to it, I called a Stinker a Stinker.. I have no qualms telling you that if you like Tarzan movies or not, this is a good rip roaring adventure story; and regardless to what I have heard to the contrary, the special effects are really good. Alexsander Skarsgard makes a great Tarzan, and Christoph Waltz really stands out as the Villain. Boy, I hated that guy.",1467676800,21,3098,4.4
7781000,4,B01H4FJR5W,"The trailer for this movie showed a lot of action and a lot of scenes I didn't expect to find in a Tarzan movie. So I was apprehensive to give it a shot. But my sister was interested so we decided to to go any way. The trailer does not do this movie the justice it deserves! The story was not the typical re-telling of the origin of Tarzan like so many other movies have been made. This one is told of the now civilized Tarzan (going by his English born name of John Clayton III) and how he goes back to Africa to help the tribes there and also his animal friends.
I loved this take on the movie. I liked that they didn't try and burden you with tons of origin story-line. They had brief flashbacks of Tarzan's origin, but they assumed you knew the origin story so they focused more on telling the present story at hand.
I was surprised by how perfect Alexander Skarsgard played Tarzan. I wasn't sure exactly what I wanted from Tarzan or what I expected. But I was impressed that Tarzan was not this extremely talky, flashy character. He had very few lines and more then anything he just had this presence that was un-deniable when he was on screen. You could feel that he was something more then human, but that he was also not invincible. I was impressed by the connection Tarzan and Jane had. Though they were not in many scenes together, you could feel their strong connection through out the film. I loved Margot Robbie as Jane. She was pretty and earthy, a very strong independent character that felt real, and a good match for Tarzan.
I thought the cinematography was very beautiful and impressive. The score was equally lovely. The movie I felt was a good mix of action and story with wonderful actors that did a really good job playing their characters.
I don't know why the critics were so harsh on this movie, because I was pleasantly surprised by how much I really loved it! If you are at all someone that finds the story of Tarzan intriguing then you will enjoy this new take on it.",1467676800,242,1995,4.365591397849462
